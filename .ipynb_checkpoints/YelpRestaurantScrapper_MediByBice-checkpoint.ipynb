       "\"We are sad to hear of 42 grams closing. We had dinner here November 2016 for Joe's birthday and it was one of the best fine dining experiences we've had. Set up as incredibly intimate setting with chef Jake Bickelhaupt, his sous chef, and Alexa Welsh, dinner consisted of us and 3 other couples that we got to know, engage and imbibe with during the delicious meal. Sitting at the counter, watching the food being prepared, and being able to chat with Chef Jake and Alexa was a rare treat. Hearing the backstory and inspiration for the dishes made each bite of the creative, inspired meal even more enjoyable. The BYOB \\xa0was wonderful with recommendations for the meal suggested on the website. We ended up trying and sharing our beer, wine, and cider with the other couples there with us and and had such a good time we even ended up heading out to drinks afterwards with our new friends. We wish best of luck to Jake and Alexa and hope this closure is temporary!\""
