It looked and smelled fantastic.  It had all of the elements in their proper proportion, but the meats didn't have any heat. It was a decent sandwich,  but not the combination of spicy flavors I expect from an Italian sub.  The ham wasn't cured like prosciutto, it was standard deli ham, which seemed to have a big impact on the finished product.   The Italian beef was juicy, but the texture was a little chewy.  Not in a bad way, just maybe a little sliced a little thicker.  Something didn't jive with this one either.  The flavors weren't blending together.  There was ample giardiniera, which did little for the overall taste of the sandwich (but it added a nice crunch).  The bread was chewier and seemed to absorb quite a bit of the juice - normally not a bad thing, but the flavor of the bread itself dominated all others.   Obviously, everyone has their favorite spot for Italian sandwiches and Conte Di Savoia has no shortage of loyal followers, so they must be doing something right.",-0.4525,0.852,0.068,0.08,0.40841269841269845

In addition to sandwiches there is stuff to take home, you want a tray of meatballs, or a selection of homemade pastas and sauces, go for it. They have homemade lasagna sheets if you want to do something non-traditional, how about pumpkin or some other squash instead of cheese and meat, or spinach and mushroom stuff anything you want between those sheets, easy. The other fun option is ready made pizza crusts, thin crust to bring home and add your own toppings. Tonight we'll do basil and mushroom! Then there is salami, so so good, and cheeses, pair that with some wine from their not huge but well balanced wine selection. They also carry a few varieties of coffee in bean or ground form. Speaking of coffee, their lattes beat the pants off the Starbucks a couple of doors down, and they cost less. That is of course if you can keep yourself from spending the savings on the cookies displayed right there.

Conte is similar to Bari, as it's an Italian grocery.  I took a look at some of the pasta sauces and found them to be around in line with the local big grocers.  They also have all the other ingredients for your Italian cooking needs.  I could see coming to Conte to shop for such ingredients if you're cooking from scratch or in the area and just need a few things.  I don't think I'd go out of my way for these items myself, but I'm not Mother at home whipping up some old world Italian.   So I simply ordered my Italian subs and called it a day.  One ham.  One turkey.  One for now, and one for later.  Great Sunday grub.  The bread they use at Conte is the shorter, wider type Italian bread rather than the long and skinny used at Graziano.  Overall, I loved both subs and would say it's a real horse race between Conte and Graziano.  Conte might even be a smidge better than Graziano, depending on the day.  Two large, delicious subs for ten bucks and change?  I'll be back. As I left Conte, I said hi to Mother presiding over all at the table in the window.  I imagine she had some wonderful old world Italian sauce simmering on the stove top right around the corner for later that evening.  I didn't get an invite, but she smiled and said hello right back.  I like old ladies.   Five stars.",0.9881,0.892,0.096,0.012,0.2713227513227513

As a neighborhood resident, it is also a great place to pop in & pick up groceries.  They have fresh bread delivered everyday - rolls, french loaves, and big Italian loaves.  They always have all of the ingredients for any Italian meal - imported pasta & tomatoes, olive oils, balsamic, wine, etc.  They have great impulse buys here & there too - like fresh figs in season and lots of imported sweets.  And the freezer case has really tasty options as well if you don't want to cook yourself.",0.9938,0.719,0.263,0.017,0.4572463768115941

Thai, Italian, Japanese, Middle Eastern, and so on and so on... they're all so much more fun than your regular food-shopping experience- and I don't get to them nearly enough. I especially love THIS little ethnic grocery store and long-time local business. From what I recall, it's been around since the '40's, so obviously I can't be the only one that thinks they're doing something right. Conte Di Savoia is authentic (I overheard a number of Italian-speaking customers) and the deli and sandwiches are fresh, delicious, and a better price and quality than what you get at most sandwich shops, as is much of what they sell beyond the deli. There are all sorts of goodies that are almost impossible to find outside of a place like this, and browsing the aisles is almost as fun as browsing rare pieces of jewelry and accessories at a boutique (but only if you like that sort of thing, which I do). But really, the cheeses, breads, desserts, even condiments are all delicious. Apparently so are the Italian meats (this according to my brother, picky eater and chef extraordinaire, who also said they are much cheaper than where he usually buys them). However, my veggie-loving self can't give testament to whether that's true or not. But I'd trust him if I were you. Oh, there is also plenty of indoor seating, as well as a few tables outside. It's fun to watch when the old Italian men congregate at the outside tables to chat and argue. They seem as if they've probably been doing this for most of their lives and it's nice to see that even though much of the area has changed in more recent years, some things never do. But, if the grumpy old men bother you or you can't find a seat but want to eat outside, it's also nice to eat on a bench at the mini-park about a quarter of a block East. There's even a DiMaggio statue to gaze at if you need just a little bit more Italian in your life :)",0.9745,0.865,0.11,0.025,0.4188752424046541

I had a romantic idea of finding some great olive oil in a cool can that my friends could never find at the supermarket, but I'm not willing to make such a substantial investment here.  All of their grocery items seem pretty expensive.  I've only actually purchased one item that was not behind the deli counter.  It was instant espresso powder (not for drinking, but for adding to chocolate baked goods) & I have not been able to find it anywhere else.
