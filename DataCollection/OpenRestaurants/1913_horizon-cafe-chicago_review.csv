2015-07-10,5.0,"I came here on a whim while I was waiting for my realtor to show my home. I had passed it a few times and never really thought of trying it. What I expected to be a typical Greek greasy spoon was really a gem. The menu is massive, serving every kind of pancake and waffle imaginable. Not only was the menu large, but it was interesting and full of unique delights you are hard pressed to find elsewhere. The quality was incredible and everything was fresh and came out quickly.  Our server was a rockstar. He didn't crowd, us, and seemed to have a second sense of when we needed him to refill coffee or bring the check. This was some of the absolute best diner service i've ever gotten.  I went out on a limb and got the chicken and waffles, which I highly recommend. Having experienced this dish in it's traditional southern atmosphere, I can attest to it being perfectly on point.",0.9802,0.84,0.15,0.009,0.5600091575091576

Great place to walk in on the weekend, grab a cup of coffee, read the paper and get a good traditional eggs & toast type of breakfast. Only thing I would say is to not sit at the bar if you go alone. I offered to sit there but the workers use the bar as their own work space to serve the rest of the restaurant. Also the stools are locked into the floor so you can't scoot up.

2015-06-12,5.0,"Ahhhhh .....Horizon Café, one of Lakeview's ( and dare I say it ? CHICAGO'S  ! ) little gems!  The Greek Style chicken breast platter is my personal  all time favorite...it comes to you crispy and seasoned to perfection !   My second favorite thing here is the Greek Spinach Pie. O.M.G.   Its advertised as being mom's own recipe and every flavorful bite is a trip to heaven and back.  The light, flakey phyllo is loaded with spinach, feta and other cheeses...I can't get enough!!!   But don't be fooled, this place has an EXTENSIVE menu with something on it that's sure to please everyone.  Feel like breakfast any day, all day?  Order up one of their enormous, fluffy omelets! I'm not even sure how that's only three eggs, but it is !  Or try one of the benedicts, skillets, pancakes or waffle breakfasts!   Lunch? How about a melt in your mouth burger on a pretzel or brioche bun, a turkey avocado wrap or a buffalo chicken salad with a bowl of soup?  Dinner?  Have I mentioned the Greek chicken?  Oh, that's right I did !!  The service is fast and friendly and if you're feeling a little anti-social the best part is they also deliver, including breakfast! I mean who delivers breakfast?  Horizon Café, that's who!   What more could you want from a place that tries to accommodate you in every little way?  THANK YOU !  Stop in and have a bite.  I guaranteed you'll love it like I do and be back again and again!",0.9894,0.824,0.165,0.011,0.515434102934103
2015-06-09,2.0,"My boyfriend and I came here hoping to have an amazing meal, judging by the amount of people that are always in the cafe on Sunday mornings. Unfortunately, the food was not appetizing. I had the custard pancakes which sound amazing, but taste gross. The custard was clearly not authentic and probably came out of a jar. The pancakes otherwise were bland and flavorless. I also had a side of hash browns which were watery and unseasoned. The only good thing I had was their hot chocolate. My boyfriend got a combo plate and also was left with the taste of bland pancakes and watery hash browns. We were very disappointed in our meal. We did get the hot chocolate and coffee taken off our bill which was a nice gesture, but we probably wont be coming back here.",0.7477,0.812,0.118,0.069,0.6759803921568627

2015-06-02,5.0,"I am so glad I finally walked in and tried this place, after passing it so many times on my way home from work. IHOP had a line an hour long this past Sunday, so my brother and I left and decided to walk across the street to grab some breakfast here instead. We definitely made the right choice in leaving IHOP to eat here! Walking up, the outside looks a little uninviting. The sign for Horizon Cafe looks very generic and dingy, and there really isn't much on the outside besides that. Walking in, however, the interior is very homey and quaint. It's clear the if you're a local, you know to eat here, and you also know that they have the best breakfast food in the area. This is definitely a local hidden gem in Lakeview. We got the last table so we didn't have to wait, but unfortunately, it looked like if you didn't get a table, you had to wait 30 minutes. I read on yelp that the banana bread french toast was good, so I ordered that. My brother ordered a ham and cheese omelette. We each ordered bacon on the side, and coffee. Our server was very friendly, and our food came out in about 15 minutes, despite the fact that they were somewhat busy. The banana bread french toast was amazing. It wasn't overly sweet, and it was thick slices of banana nut bread, lightly battered, topped with banana slices. The portion wasn't huge, but the bread was so thick, I got full off finishing two of the three slices. Despite being battered, the dish was surprisingly light and airy. I will definitely be ordering this again. My brother's omelette was huge! He ordered it off the three egg omelette section on the menu, and it looked like there were at least six eggs in there! He got his with diced ham and cheddar cheese. He said it was very good, and I tried a bite and it was. Airy, not overcooked eggs, with plenty of cheese and ham. It came with your basic side of hash browns. Our coffee was always full, and the side of bacon was crispy and perfectly greasy. Talked to the owner, Nick, who was very nice, and told him breakfast was very good. He came over during the meal to ask how it was. I am excited for Nicky Street to open next door after eating here, I will definitely be back to try dinner!",0.9946,0.837,0.138,0.025,0.4585967578520771

We entered the establishment around 12:50, and there were a few people in the diner but it was not crowded. The restaurant was smaller than I expected. Horizon is a typical diner serving breakfast and lunch. My friend decided on the Spicy Jalapeno Jack Burger, which was served with a side of fries and option for soup (he upgraded to the chili, which looked excellent and ended up being so). His burger was cooked medium to his liking. The fries were crinkle cut and the entrée also featured a side of cole slaw. I decided on breakfast fare, which is my go to option at these type of places. I ordered the vegetarian delight omelet (I smell omelette as such, but their menu has it listed the other way). I had it prepared with egg beaters, and I also opted for a side of fruit in lieu of hash browns. There's also an option for toast, but I upgraded to the pumpkin pancakes. My only complaint for my meal was that the fruit on the side was super small! As for the omelette and pancakes... they were fantastic! I prefer baked omelettes over pan fried ones, but this one seemed to be the latter. It still was quite large and loaded with veggies (Spinach, Mushrooms, Onions, Tomatoes, and Green Peppers). The cakes were very tasty as well. Two pancakes, not too small but not overly large either. Aside from the previously mentioned small fruit bowl, our drinks were empty for most of our meal, which was a drag, but it's not going to put a huge damper on my overall experience.

The staff is friendly and positive . Nick and George are always careful about adding great food to an extense menu , giving us even more options,Mr. chef John makes the best soups ever and Mrs Stella's charming and way of embracing her costumers is priceless , this family besides fantastic and loving are people that deserves all my respect and care , because they truly care about us, you won't find great food like that for that price easily . But I also would like to say that I find sad and disturbing that some people go around all over the net trying to bash good places and try to diminish the hard work and dedication that some business owners put into practice to keep their business running. A lot of times even other business owners do that just for jealousy and lack on integrity and a solid character,  Maybe some people have serious issues with themselves and have to go around taking their frustrations  on someone else, for whatever reason they might find convenient or lacking of intelligence to do something useful and productive with their time. One thing is giving your feedback about something , very different than being mean and evil , just remember that what goes around comes around ,  but also remember that  there's nothing that a great psychiatrist,  appropriate  pills or great sex can't fix . Negative and bitter people suck.  Just relax , learn to enjoy life and be positive , that way you'll certainly find your own happiness  instead trying to spread your misery around .

My burrito was pretty outstanding and had that spicy chorizo flavor.  The hash browns that came with weren't bad either.   My roommate was less pleased with his order.  The soup was apparently bland and his chicken fried steak wasn't up to his Texan standards.  Also on the table was a biscuit and honey--not sure whose order it came with, but the biscuit too was so-so and was more of bread shaped like a biscuit.

In my experiences, the waitstaff is very friendly and understands when you need more time to decide on your order, even after the third time they stop by (yes, this happened to me on my most recent visit).  The prices are very reasonable (cheap!), and the portions are very large. My hungover self sometimes finishes the meal, but oftentimes I take home leftovers. Some of the items I've gotten and recommend are: Taco Salad, Lox Bagel Platter, Fried Chicken Benedict, and the Beunas Dias Skillet. I thought the Hot Brown was just okay (the sauce was a bit much for me). All of the dishes seem to have been prepared with fresh ingredients.  My boyfriend often gets breakfast food or a burger (all come on a pretzel bun). I've tried the Sparta burger from him, and it's very tasty! It comes with homemade Tiaziki sauce. The soups are also great and listed with the daily specials. I love that they had Pride themed specials during Pridefest - way to be a part of the community. I've never gone on a Thursday when they offer Authentic Greek platters, but I've always been interested. If it's like the other meals, it's going to be delicious. The only thing that surprises me is that there is no bread baskets. It seems like the kind of place that would serve bread before the meal, but it doesn't.

With such an enormous menu and an always attentive waiting service Horizon has quickly become my first choice when I just want to relax and enjoy a filling meal in a very comfortable environment. If you ever have trouble picking what you want to eat, be sure to ask Nick for help. He always seems to guess exactly what you want, possibly due to everything being delicious.",0.9705,0.777,0.204,0.019,0.5459150326797385

Funnily enough, their taco salad is my favorite non-breakfast choice, better than most Mexican restaurants in the neighborhood. I recently have ordered food for delivery to my apartment because I'm too lazy to get out in the cold. Their service and delivery is fast and, even on crowded mornings, I never have to wait longer than 15 minutes for a table. It has a great diner atmosphere.

2013-01-05,5.0,I have only positive things to say about Horizon Cafe. I love this place. It reminds me of the small town Midwestern diners I grew up before moving to the big city. The prices are great and the food is awesome (omelettes as big as your face!). Love this place!,0.9712,0.669,0.331,0.0,0.5661616161616161
2013-01-02,4.0,"I have to say, this is my go-to delivery place on weekends or basically anytime they are open. Whether it's breakfast, lunch, dinner, or dessert, this place got it covered. Not to mention the huge portions and quick delivery, this is the crème of the delivery crop!  Below are my top 5 picks from the many that I have tried: For breakfast, get the Belgium Waffle. It is perfectly cooked while retaining its fluffy, light texture. There's not much else to really say about it because it is just a big old waffle, but it did have this really sweet flavor that I enjoyed. Definitely way better than Ihop! I wish they delivered the syrup with it. It said they did online, but my order didn't have it in the bag so I had to go out and buy it myself since I rarely use that stuff (kind of defeated the purpose of delivery).  For a starter, try their starter sampler. It comes with mozzarella sticks, fried ravioli, buffalo wings, and onion rings. My favorite was the ravioli. Anyone who knows me knows I hate anything having to do with pasta so they must be good. They almost tasted more like a jalapeño popper than a pasta though. The onion rings were good, I'm not really an onion ring fan, but these were better than most I've had. I was a bit disappointed in the buffalo wings. They were not buffalo enough and I found some weird hard pieces of fat in there. Yuck! Mozzarella sticks were good, but pretty standard and mediocre.  For a light lunch, order the Greek Salad. It doesn't come with your typical Greek salad, but instead a light vinaigrette which is both healthier and tastier. The salad has a bunch of feta cheese and kalamata olives in, just the way I like it. It also has typical salad ingredients like tomatoes, cucumbers, pepperoncini, onions, and red peppers. The menu says it is topped with anchovies, but every time I specify I do not want them and they've been really good about that. The bread crisps on top are absolutely delicious and the seasoning sprinkled over the greens adds immense flavor. For a burger, get the Bacon Ranch Crunch Burger. I am not a fan of bacon, but my gosh, this burger is delicious! It comes on a pretzel bun and is loaded with grilled onions (yes, major downfall, I was thinking thin onion ring when I saw ""crispy onion strings"" on the menu). However, the bacon was not over powering and the burger was cooked perfectly. The ranch came on the side so I could use my discretion. If you order the deluxe, it comes with a side of fries, cold slaw, and the soup of the day. Most recently, the soup of the day I got was a chicken orzo.  If you're not a burger fan, try the chicken parm sandwich. It is huge and loaded with chicken cutlet and cheese. It's not like your typical chicken parm. It's a version of one. The chicken cutlet itself isn't as greasy as a typical one and the mozzarella is a nice alternative to provolone. It comes on French bread which feels like more a ciabatta than an Italian sub roll. Also, the sauce is very sparse which makes it great for leftovers. This also comes deluxe with fries, cole slaw, and soup for about $2.50 more. I haven't tried any of their sweets, but I can't wait to. They have quite an extensive dessert menu featuring things like apple pie, cheesecake, ice cream, and shakes. The prices are great. Large salads and deluxe sandwiches will run you around $8-9 while breakfast ranges from $5-$9. I can't comment on the restaurant itself because I have never been there but for delivery this is the best option in the neighborhood!",0.9991,0.782,0.193,0.026,0.6061293436293437

We were the only guests in the joint, but it seemed like they were making a lot of deliveries.   I ordered their cowboy burger (beef, bacon, and onions....yum!) deluxe style (meaning I'm a fatty and I wanted the fries AND soup.). I got Clam Chowder soup, and it tasted homemade. Little on the thick side, but still good. The boyfriend got the 3-egg spinach and feta omelet.  The portions are massive! There was no way that the omelet was three eggs. Maybe it was three dinosaur eggs. They really loaded it up with spinach! It came with two big pieces of toast and some hash-browns. The burger was good, but super greasy (kind of made the bun soggy). The fries were the generic crinkle cut fries. There was even a pickle and a little cup of cole slaw. Everything came out quickly and hot.  Service was great. They were attentive, and not once did we ever feel rushed. Everything was fairly priced, the burger deluxe style was $8.79, and the omelet was around the same price. I'd say that it's definitely a better environment and experience than ihop, and I prefer to support local joints over chains any day.

Tonight, I decided to dabble in their dinner menu.  I had the turkey with mashed potatoes and my roommate had the grilled cheese.  The turkey and mashed potatoes were fairly tasteless and completely doused with a thick coat of some unappetizing looking greyish-white gravy.  Underneath the heaping mound of mashed potatoes and turkey was some stuffing.  The stuffing was gluey and after one bite I decided that it I had tried enough of it.  The grilled cheese was also miserable.  It wasn't grilled very well and there was some extremely crunchy bits of something in or on the bread, giving me the sensation that the sandwich did--as the name might imply--contain sand.  On top of it all, everything was barely above room temperature.   All in all, very disappointed.  The only thing that saved it from the one star rating was my couple of better experiences eating their breakfast, which, if I decide to go back, will be the only area of the menu from which I will be ordering.",0.169,0.883,0.062,0.055,0.6432330827067669

I've been here during the non-brunch hours, and it was slow, but still good. The food is ALWAYS delicious, and everyone I've ever taken has been very happy with how their meal tasted. Prices are low, but not cheap.  One funny thing I've noticed is that they're really good at giving your coffee a ""warmer,"" always keeping it nice and hot at the top of your mug. As a coffee addict, this is important to me. As I already mentioned, the way that this place is decorated is tickity-tack-tack-tackery.

2011-05-26,4.0,"I must preface this review by saying that my review shows 4 stars, although this review is really based off a 3.5 score, I just need to round up. PROS: 1) Horizon Cafe has some of the best burgers this side of town and very similar to the amazing burgers at The Counter. Honestly, when I got Horizon's Cowboy Burger, I was in awe. It was so absolutely fantastic that I just couldn't get anything else here for a while. 2) The owners are always available for conversation and my favorite is the owner's mom, who is always sitting in the corner booth. She always says hi and if she's busy, she at least smiles and acknowledges me. 3) The menu is HUGE and can even be a bit overwhelming. Another favorite of mine is the hand battered Fish n Chips with Michigan tartar sauce...omgosh, so very delicious! 4) Their Apple Pumpkin pie is very yummy and I really enjoyed it when I ordered it. 5) This restaurant is very into Holiday Specials. Although I have never been to one of them, I can at least appreciate the effort. 6) Horizon has great portions of food and decent prices for MOST of their stuff.  Now you know all good places have some cons. Soooooo,  CONS: 1) It's almost always empty. I live in the area and when I walk by, I only ever see like one or two people inside, while Ihop down the street has ten or so. I guess they just don't do enough advertising to get people inside and might take for granted the fact that they've been at that location for so long.  2) I feel that Horizon has so much opportunity for business (especially in the neighborhood they're in) but they don't really take advantage of it. 3) The stock photos on the wall are really cheesy. I think they can definitely improve the decor a little bit. Come on...you're in Boystown, ask any of us guys for a little bit of advice. 4) They close so freakin' early. Again, this goes back to opportunity. In Boystown, people are out late and want to get some food after a night of drinking/partying - in fact, that's when Horizon's counterpart, Ihop, is at its busiest. Horizon closes at like 9 PM... and really, they lock the doors at 8:30. 5) Going along with the last point, I once went at 8:45, super happy that I made it before 9PM because I was craving a Cowboy Burger. I went for the door and it was locked. The owner peeked his head around, looked at me, and fake-frowned. I pointed to my watch and said ""It's not nine yet!"" and he said ""Oh well,"" frowned again, shrugged, and then walked back into the dining area while I stood there, annoyed. ________________ Horizon definitely has its ups and downs, and I can totally see why people often go to the IHOP instead. I really think if Horizon was open just a few hours later, they'd make bank. Think about all those groups of people that go to IHOP every Friday or Saturday but are sick of it at this point - Horizon has the potential to be that place where people go!",0.9946,0.851,0.128,0.021,0.5364079952968842

Not only do they serve french toast, but they have a vast variety of pancakes and waffles. Snickers pancakes?! Yes please!  If you're in a savory mood, they have a nice selection omelets, skillets, burritos and sammies, and benedicts. I have three words for you: Fried. Chicken. Benedict.

2011-04-06,4.0,"I noticed this spot one Saturday morning after volunteering at the Lakeview Pantry.  Since I somehow get roped into Sunday breakfast/lunch/brunch/whatever with some friends I made a mental note to suggest it the next day.  My suggestion won and, what went from a group of 3 people to a group of 8 people (courtesy of our friend making everything a large production!), we all headed up to Horizon Cafe. Naturally it's difficult to get 8 people in anywhere, any time of day without a reservation, so it was no surprise that when we called a few minutes ahead they told us we would have to wait a few minutes or so, unless we wanted to split tables.  After about 10 minutes we were sat at a square table that was meant for 4 but, when the small, rounded table leaves were lifted, you could squeeze in 6.  We were hungry, so we made 8 work! The menu is overwhelming.  Breakfast, lunch, dinner, 4th meal; whatever you want, you'll find it here!  Some notables include the Biscuits and Gravy Quesadilla (wtf?!), Snickers Pancakes (healthy?), the Chorizo Burrito (it's fun to say 5 times fast with a Spanish accent!), and the Chicken and Waffles (wings!  I wish I didn't give up fried food for Lent).  In case you're super hungry you can go for huge entrees of fish, chicken, pasta, etc., most being under $10.  Steal. The biscuits and gravy (the regular ones) were excellent!  They come with a side of hash browns, too, for under $7.  You'll be full and you're hangover will be quelled. Also, the stock photos and ""inspirational"" quotes on the wall are pretty ridiculous.  ""Soup is love in a bowl.""  I guess so?  It like you walked into one of those poster shops with the ""Perseverance"" wall photo with the guy running through the mountains.   Our servers were friendly and this place has definitely got some appeal with the neighborhood.  Be prepared to wait a little bit (even with a small party) during peak hours.  They do not have a waiting area, so I recommend calling beforehand.  Definitely worth the trip up Broadway if you're as little less local.",0.9955,0.8,0.171,0.028,0.5239038739038739

It wasn't initially crowded, probably because iHop was literally within eye view... but still filled up fairly quick through the early afternoon. I'm not sure what our server's name was, but he was pretty personable and helpful when asking questions on certain items on the menu.  The prices are very reasonable and they have pretty good selections on the menu. I ordered the Double Pancake Combo, of which consisted of two golden pancakes, two eggs, hash browns and two sausage links. In other words, very appetizing!!!   Loved the hometown decor; making me feel as though I was on a road trip and stopped into a local favorite. So, rather than going to some of the other cafes' in the area - who have less than stellar reviews and service - I think I'll stop in more often.  I took away a star simply because after ordering our meal, our server never asked if we wanted a beverage... like orange juice or apple juice or something -- in addition to the glasses of water that was given to us upon being seated. I didn't think about it until our food had arrived, so probably was just our fault to a certain degree; but would have been nice to be given that option upon ordering.

Driving down the street she noticed the sign and so it came to be, we were eating at the Horizon.  Service: I noticed almost immediately that the entire staff had on the wireless headsets that hang off one ear. I noticed that they seemed to have a decent amount of servers for such a rather small place. In light of the technological advancement (headset) and the manpower (abundant staff), it was a little disheartening to see hardly no smiling and table servicing no different from any other establishment.

Product: Lox and Bagle - I am a fan of 25 years in regards to Lox is concerned! Every Chicago based place I have eaten lox at gives you a slice of onions and tomatoe, without fail you will get these items with your lox.

I dont mind picking out the slivers of onions and placing them on my bagle but when I did so, I noticed all the vegitables had some type of oil dressing.

Work travel looms this week, did not even bother going grocery shopping. May have to go get breakfast. Do not want to get out of warm bed. Whine. God, Chicago needs more places that deliver breakfast. Grab BlackBerry. Google ""chicago breakfast delivery"" and Horizon Cafe pops up. Their website is BlackBerry friendly - a rarity. I peruse their menu. I grab my laptop to order. Only a $10 minimum. Score! I see pancakes. Ooooh. I keep looking. I see biscuits and gravy. I was just craving those yesterday. Ding ding ding! Gravy on the side, please. Throw in a side of bacon and a glass of orange juice to hit the $10 minimum. 15% off first time order? Score. Wait, $4 for delivery?! Kind of makes the 15% off a moot point. Total with tip comes to $17. Convenience - and laziness - will cost you. Oh well. Order submitted at 8:06am. Buzzed delivery guy in at 8:28am. Score. Delivery driver is super nice, which is a pleasant surprise this early. Asks me if I'm related to the [my last name] in [some suburb I don't recall]. I am not. He hands me my food with a smile, and because Foodler handles their online ordering and I've already tipped him online I don't have to sign a thing. Took food back to bed. Delighted to see that they thoughtfully packed everything to avoid the dreaded Soggy Delivery Food. Carefully unwrap food so I don't spill gravy on my bed. Take first bite... Meh. The food is just okay. The biscuits look and taste like they came out of a can, which may explain the quick delivery time. The gravy is just okay. Nothing special. Bacon is also just okay. Orange juice is delightful and hits the spot. It also came with hash browns, but I don't like hash browns so I have no idea how they were. Finished meal and am full, but not really satisfied with how it tasted. Bummer. Would have probably tasted better if I had been hungover. I should really drink more. Would I order again? Yes, but not what I ordered today. I didn't love the biscuits and gravy, but I'd be willing to give other things a shot.

I wouldn't mind it, since its raining today and I don't want to go anywhere, if the food was GOOD. What a WASTE! 1. I ordered online through Foodler. I ordered the sensational turkey sandwich, which is basically just your typical turkey sandwich on a croissant. You can order ""delux"", which would include fries, coleslaw, and soup. You can also order your sandwiches plain, which only includes coleslaw. I ordered plain, and put in a special request to substitute the cole slaw for fries. Both items are the same price on the menu. I immediately received a phone call from Horizon saying that they don't do substitutions. Then he proceeds to convince me I should order the delux. Why, on earth, when I tell you that I don't want the cole slaw, would you tell me to spend more to order the delux and pay for MORE things that I don't want (soup)? He tries to tell me that this is the best way to order, and that they don't do substitutions because they want people to order the delux. I declined the delux, told him I am willing to pay the $2 extra for fries, hold the cole slaw. I also tell him I will never order from them again because no where on the menu do they say ""no substitutions"". He seemed completely unphased and hung up the phone. 2. My food was then 30 minutes later than the quoted delivery time. 3. I also ordered the chicken egg rolls, which I typically love from other restaurants. These were soggy, not crunchy at all.

There are a lot of items on the menu, but I was hungry and decided to go with a Turkey Club deluxe sandwich (comes with fries, soup, and coleslaw).  The soup is advertised as top 10 in the city from Citysearch - I had roasted lentil and GF had creamy chicken and rice.  Hers was much better but mine was healthier - take your choice, both were still tasty.  The club was pretty good, I think I will go with a breakfast item next time though.  The fries were a tad under seasoned but still yummy in my tummy.   The GF had the Spanakopita and wow, it was really, really good.  Thick and creamy, lots of spinach, greek salad on the side and some really flavorful rice.  She chose wisely.

Horizon is not a chain and definitely has much more charm being an independent place. I have always received outstanding service and the few complaints I have had - Nick & George (the owners) took care of right away.  When I lived in Park Place Tower and was within stumbling distance for hungover Saturday brunches I was there every weekend. Now being a little farther away - I'm ashamed to say we only get delivery, but that is still outstanding.  I am very wary of getting Lox anywhere - and their lox and bagel breakfast special is always top notch. Their soups are amazing (navy bean and chicken and wild rice are great!).

Now, unfortunately, the bad:  I brought my mom here for breakfast while she was in town in August and had a terrible experience here so I had to take away a couple stars.  I understand that they were busy, but they should be ready to handle everyone that they seat.  I will say that when I order eggs, hash browns and bacon I like them very crisp (and ask for them that way when ordering), so I wasn't all that upset that I had to return it to be cooked more ... but I had to return my food twice and after that it still wasn't that well done!?  We're talking basic breakfast food, which shouldn't be rocket science to a diner that serves breakfast.  To make matters worse, our waitress made us feel like we were one big inconvenience to her with her attitude and rolling eyes.  I already felt bad enough about having to return my food (and I really shouldn't).  Just a side note: I was done eating by the time they even returned my mom's food.  The owner took my mom's meal off of our bill and offered an apology.

Unfortunately it has only reinforced our policy of ""when you want to try something new, try something old"". We should have gone the extra distance to Stella's.  After Dan's hot chocolate (yummy) was delivered, we got a new waiter. We placed our order - poached eggs Florentine for me and chocolate chip pancakes for Dan - and asked if we could start with some pita or something because we were starving (aka, in need of food in our bellies or else we would puke). Our waiter earned points when he said he would bring a bread basket. He lost those points when he said to watch out because the bread was hot as he'd just microwaved it. Umm, why? Also, it was HOT, so hot I had to let it cool for 5 minutes before I could eat it, totally defeated the purpose of bring me something to eat while I waited for my food.  The food came out really quickly, probably in about 5-7 minutes. Odd then, that it was not hot at all. Lukewarm, almost cold. My hashbrowns were cold and my eggs were sitting on a 2-inch thick pile of spinach that was so obviously from the frozen chopped bag you find in the grocer's freezer. It was dry and gross, as was the unbuttered, untoasted, cold English muffin it sat on. Dan also pointed out that for a really busy restaurant they sure poached my eggs fast - usually it takes longer to do so. So he thinks they may have had a stash of eggs ready and that's why they came out so fast, and so cold. Dan's pancakes were equally bad - about 5 chocolate chips in the center of each cake, cold, and bone dry. He slathered syrup on them and they still just tasted dry.  Our waiter came back and asked how things were and I said to be honest, not great. I said the food was not hot at all and he said he brought it out as soon as it was done. He also said ""well I didn't cook it"" and then offered to heat it up in the MICROWAVE. We passed on that grossly unappealing option and just ate the rest because we were hungry and eager to get back home and into bed.  For the rest of the day we would mutter to each other ""those pancakes were bullshit"" and ""that hollandaise had no flavor at all -was that from a can?"" I recognize that sometimes a place just has an off day, but I will never go back to Horizons.

The pancakes were hard, and the hot chocolate was clearly made from a packet and water (not even milk!) The omelettes are good (and GINORMOUS). They seriously must use like 6 eggs. The one thing that they do have going for them is that the people that work here are really nice, and they always have coupons available at the register for the next time that you come. ***Update-apparently the owner's of Horizon keep tabs on what people are writing, and after reading my review, sent me a message telling me that they are working on the pancakes and will take my other comments into mind, so I am giving them another star for responding to customer comments!",0.9818,0.814,0.166,0.02,0.5295833333333333
2007-05-06,1.0,"I went here with my girlfriend on a Sunday morning.  A friend was meeting us there, but we arrived before he did.  It was obvious that they were a little busy, but we were second on the list and quoted 15 min, so we decided to stay.  During that time, the host (owner/manager?) had open tables but refused to seat us because our 3rd person wasn't there yet.  I understand that they need to have tables for people who are going to order and not just sit there waiting for a friend, so this wasn't really that big of a deal. It became problematic after we sat down.  I'll just give a list of our experience, for time's sake: - our server took about 10 or 15 minutes to actually approach the table.  luckily, at this point we were ready to order. - we ordered 2 coffees and an oj.  5 min later, she came back with the coffee but forgot what my girlfriend had ordered (oj).  when the oj came out, it tasted watered down.  we gave it back and then watched as the host struggled with replacing the oj container in their juice machine. - then we waited.  and waited.  a runner tried to bring out our food, but there was a ton of confusion about who was getting what. - ugh... the food.  i ordered a belgian waffle with blueberries and my friend had the same with strawberries as well.  both ""fruits"" were very obviously fruit pie filling out of a can.  he also ordered a bagel (to come out first) that didn't arrive until we were almost done with our meal.  my girlfriend ordered biscuits and gravy.  i don't know what their definition of b&g is, but it is not your traditional biscuits with sausage gravy.  this was a very liquidy white sauce made with ham.  the biscuits looked like they were pan-fried.  it was not good at all.   - our server never came back during our meal.  we ""finished"" our food and waited and waited.  they bussed our table.  10 min (at least) went by with us just sitting there at an empty table.  we had to ask for our bill from our server, and it took her another 5 or 10 min to get it to us.  during this time, we saw her grab a banana with her bare hands, pick up a tip off the counter (because money is oh so sanitary), and then proceed to slice the banana directly onto another customer's waffle.  i worked in food service for years throughout college, and i cannot tolerate blatant disregard of health code. - we went to pay at the host stand, and the host made us wait another 5 or 10 min while he seated people and cleaned tables. - also, this place had some of the rudest patrons i've ever encountered.  i said excuse me to a gentleman, and he completely ignored me and continued talking to the man with him.  he did the same to my friend.  a woman tried to barge in front of us at the host counter to pay her bill, and shoved her elbow in my girlfriend's back. just overall, a terrible experience, bad food, inattentive and spacey service, and rude patrons.  we will never go back.  try melrose or stella's instead.  i'm hoping north coast cafe is better.",-0.5232,0.861,0.066,0.072,0.31054131054131057
2007-04-22,3.0,"Horizon Cafe - it is what it is and that is a diner. A diner that is affordable and close to my house with friendly service, even. If you live far away, there is probably a restaurant of comparable quality closer to you. If you live in Lakeview, it's a perfectly reasonable place to have breakfast.  I did dock them one star because we had to flag down somebody to refill our coffee a couple of times; if there's one area of service in a standard diner on which I refuse to compromise, it's frequent and cheerful coffee refills.",0.8658,0.868,0.11,0.022,0.5209876543209876
2007-04-20,1.0,"Two words sum up this place: Help Me. Seriously, if you want to eat cafeteria food and be entertained by freaks and wack jobs, this place has a never ending horizon filled with them. I couldn't wait to leave. My friend and I wanted a quick bite close to my place b/c we were in a hurry. The place wasn't even half full, and yet a chicken sandwich and a club sandwich took an eternity to show up at our table (okay, about a half hour). We also both had side salads beforehand, in which they took from a fridge and removed the plastic before serving...a real nice touch. I'm praying that the cesspool I discovered at the bottom of my salad was water, and that ain't so great either. The clientele here is halfway senile at best. Imagine taking a bunch of separate people who talk to themselves on the street (you know the kind) and putting them at there own separate tables at a diner and watching the oddities... that's about what you get at Horizon. The kicker was this old man who came in, used the bathroom for about 20 minutes, then came out, went back into the kitchen and just hung out back there for a while, then came and sat at a booth and stared at the rest of us while we ate. Uh, does he work there? Is he the owner? Did he wash his hands before returning to work? Holy Cow!!",0.9251,0.885,0.086,0.029,0.5127450980392156

2006-12-20,4.0,"It's pretty basic diner stuff.  I'm going to give it four stars b/c... 1) convenience to me & good hours. Never a wait! 2) Service. The staff, while maybe not the most attentive or brightest, are always so goddamn NICE. They seemed to recognize me the last time I went, even though it was only my 2nd or 3rd time. I went once and didn't order any food, just coffee oh! and an appetizer plate for like 4 people. I always feel bad about doing that, but they were still very nice and attentive, not rude at all! 3) The Menu. Lots of different choices.  4) Huge omelettes! I think this is going to become a regular place for me. Great little diner.",0.9727,0.761,0.205,0.035,0.588697705802969
2006-12-18,3.0,"I hate to give this restaurant only three stars because my waitress was so attentive and accommodating, but my food wasn't too good(but I ordered roasted sirloin right before they were closing). The soup I tried, which was cream of broccoli, was really good for a diner. My friend ordered something else, and her food was better. I 've been here only once, but I assume their food and service are better than those of a typical diner.",0.9427,0.78,0.192,0.028,0.715079365079365
2006-09-04,3.0,"This place shut down literally a week after we moved to the neighborhood.  we've been awaiting its return ever since!  This is a typical greek-coffee-shop-diner place that serves breakfast all the time but lunch and dinner as well. we came here Saturday, labor day weekend at 10:30 AM.  they were busy but not crazed.  We found the service really subpar and the food only OK.  I feel breakfast food is easy to do, but hard to excel at, and this place was OK at best.   i'll definitely give it another chance, but in the meantime, try North Coast Cafe down the street.  I love their food, it is the same concept as Horizon and does it very well.",0.9911,0.708,0.281,0.011,0.4518518518518518
2006-07-08,4.0,This restaurant has great diner style food.  They shut down in 2004 from an electrical fire which also forced all residents out of the building above them.  I believe they are open again and know that they have good size portions and an interesting menu.  Definitely worth a try and a great place to support.,0.9403,0.619,0.304,0.078,0.42098765432098767
