2017-08-20,3.0,"Came here with two other people since we were both craving sushi and wanted AYCE. This would be my third time here and not much has changed since the first time. We came around 7:30PM and they close at 9PM. It was odd that it was a Sunday night but the restaurant have very few people. On the side of the restaurant they had an open sign that would light up. It seemed like since the second time I have been here, the sign does not get turn on often. The service was okay in a sense. The table had four chairs and was big enough for us but was only set up to be two people. After we ordered, they never gave us a third set and so we had to grab one from another table. When the sushi came out, they did not give us the small plates either but we had to get up to get them ourselves which is strange. They love filling up our water. The sushi itself though, was okay as well. The pieces of nigiri were fill up with rice and not too thick and not too thin of a slice of fish. The rice did not seem like it was actual sushi rice, almost seemed like jasmine rice to me. The rolls seemed to be more worth the AYCE in a sense that they give you less rice in those. When the second round of orders came in, similar to my first experience, the fish began to now taste off and fishy. Not sure if it was because they were closing soon or they knew it would be our last round anyways. I really liked the spicy salmon rolls. *big fan of salmon* I like their white tuna fish nigiri as the slices can be thicker than the salmon. However, it was the white tuna fish that during the second round began to not taste as well. I also enjoy the palatine roll as it combined both eel and salmon together. I would not recommend the tempera as it was CHEWY?! I would come here again for a quick fix of sushi but I do not expect amazing quality and for the price of $20, it will have to do.",0.9887,0.859,0.114,0.026,0.35047222222222224

2016-07-31,4.0,"I know this place is more known for their AYCE sushi, but I have to say it's the stuff that they don't have on the AYCE menu that actually impressed me.  Yes, there isn't really any ambience here, it's bare bones, but the service is friendly, the pace is a little on the slower end, but still not bad. But their attention to detail is pretty spot on and they actually take the time to plate their dishes beautifully! Pretty good for an affordable sushi place! I've gotten the following items here and I've found the majority of them to be surprisingly good: - Hamachi Kama Yaki. They didn't have this the last time I went, but the first time I visited and I was actually able to order this, I was excited beyond words. It's rare that you see this dish on a restaurant menu, I don't know why, probably because it's not one of the more popular Japanese dishes. But it's delicious! It's broiled yellowtail collar (the meat right between the gill and the front fin of the fish), it's got this fresh, mildly sweet yellowtail flavor. With a squirt of lemon, it's juicy, it's tender, it warms you up, it's delicious! Definitely a must try and is definitely affordable here - it's usually a lot more expensive when offered on the menu. They don't have it every time though unfortunately since, again, it's not one of their more popular dishes. - California Roll. This was disappointing. The roll is small. The crabmeat is imitation (which I think is key to a good california roll) and there just isn't that much flavor in it because the crabmeat isn't real. I'd recommend passing on this one. - Tatsuta Age. Japanese style fried chicken. This was YUM! The chicken was moist and perfectly fried. The flavor was balanced, with the sweet sauce it was to die for. A good portion for the price. - Palatine Roll. This was surprisingly good. They were BIG pieces, but there are only 5 of them. It makes it a little hard to follow the rule of eating every piece in one bite. But each bite was delicious - beautifully presented, you could tell they put the time and effort in to roll this one a certain way. The avocado was spread out perfectly, you could see the bits of salmon sashimi and unagi, sliced thin cucumbers. It was a little overwhelmed with the sweet sauce on top of it, but all in all it was pretty good. All in all, I'll definitely be back to eat some more, but will call in advance to check on the yellowtail collar. The AYCE menu is okay, but seems like most everything more worth eating aren't available on the $19.99 menu.

Come to find out when our food comes out all of them have 6-8 pieces each, even the ones we thought were one piece sashimi orders. We had way too much food due to this confusion. Also there is no telling which roll is which when you receive your order. They don't tell you or anything. So we had no idea what we were eating. As others have mentioned, they jam pack the amount of white rice on the rolls to fill you up. I'm sure their goal is to put as much white rice so you don't eat everything that you ordered and then you are forced to pay.

2013-03-29,2.0,My main complaint is the high rice/topping ratio both for nigiri and rolls though this is ordered as part of the all you can eat menu. The sushi comes with double the amount of rice comparing to what it supposed to be. The rice is highly condensed and overly warmed that you can't taste the individual grain of rice. And customers are forced to eat all the rice to avoid charge of unfinished rice. I understand this help reduce the cost as an all you can eat restaurant. But this can be enforced using other method such as smaller sushi or reduced variety. Forcing the customers to eat rice balls is not acceptable. I give them two stars for other OK ingredients in the sushi such as fish and crab.,-0.0526,0.874,0.059,0.068,0.38179487179487176

2013-03-26,2.0,"Wow - I am SO disappointed in Sushi Sai lately.  I've been going here for awhile now because it was a reasonably priced all-you-can-eat deal, convenient location to where I work, and the fish was good and prepared well.  But where I would have gone as far as 4 stars, I'm struggling now to give 2.  Why? Because they've apparently changed their approach to ""all-you-can-eat"" to dissuade you from partaking in this deal.   They are now doubling the rice on any nigiri you order from the AYCE menu.  I noticed this the previous visit to my last one and thought perhaps it was just was an ""off night"".  The cut of the fish was also incredibly thin - so thin that many of the pieces are falling apart because there's not meat left to hold it together. Unfortunately that wasn't an ""off night"" but now appears to be the norm if you're doing the AYCE.  If you look around, you'll see that others who aren't doing the AYCE but ordering off the regular menu are getting fish cut like you see in the pictures on here.  A descent cut and just the right amount of rice.  When you compare that to what you get on your plate if you're doing the AYCE you almost think you're in 2 different restaurants. There's so much rice it's almost uncomfortable to put it in your mouth.  This seems to be the best way to get you full faster and thus order less.  Between the huge amount of rice and the really poorly cut fish, it's not worth it.  Even at 1/2 the price you'd do better getting grocery store sushi.  How sad is that - particularly at a place that clearly _can_ cut and server sushi correctly but is choosing not to for those in for the AYCE deal. So if you're going in for lunch (when they don't have the AYCE menu) or you're going to order off the regular menu for dinner (and thus spend more $$), then it's not bad.   I don't expect the highest quality or widest selection at any AYCE establishment, but this is beyond acceptable.  If you want to spend $25 (tax & tip for AYCE + tea) for a plate of rice, then go for it.  If you would like to have a reasonable cut of fish at an AYCE sushi place, go elsewhere.",0.8558,0.837,0.089,0.074,0.524936174936175

I would recommend it more for AYCE and generally, Sushi Sai wouldn't be on my list of go to options otherwise as I wouldn't consider it to be very fresh or noteworthy. When you order the sushi nigiri, they REALLY pack the rice. I watched the sushi chefs prepare my order, and they were SQUEEZING the poor rice with all of their might - the logical assumption is that they're making the nigiri denser so that you get full faster. And hey, I get it, it's AYCE sushi and that's expected. The rolls are less densely packed since its a bit more difficult to do so without completely smashing everything that's inside the roll. If you want more variety and ingredients that aren't rice, I recommend getting the rolls. Like many other sushi places, I'm always weary of anything that's ""spicy""; spicy tuna, spicy salmon, etc. Sai uses a spicy mayo, and my cautiousness was well deserved..seems like they're scraping the meat and potentially using older fish for these. I'd stay away. But all in all, it's one of the better AYCE sushi joints in the city. A few things to stay away from, but overall not a bad deal for $20. It meets your expectations.

Fast seating, nice atmosphere, and friendly service from the start.  I inquire about the ""all you can eat"" option for curiousity's sake, only to learn that it's active after 2:00 PM, and $18 with a modified menu. Since my boss hasn't had sushi and wants me to take her for her first experience, I figure I'd do some research here and see if it's a good place to start for a sushi virgin: Soft Shell Crab Roll - Fried to a crisp, check.  Fresh vegetables, check.  Rice packed appropriately so that it holds, but not mushy, check.  Slight fishiness flavor to one of the bites, but it was only one piece of the five, and the rest were perfectly fine.  Not bad. Yellowtail Sushi - Smooth, rich, and flavorful.  No fishiness.  Good piece. Salmon Sushi - No stringiness, good sizable cut, and clean flavors.  Good piece. Tuna Sushi - Slightly fishy, texture was pretty much spot on.  Mediocre piece. Verdict:  As the star rating says, this place is A-OK.  It doesn't turn an unforgettable experience, but has good quality sushi at fairly standard prices (my bill came to $15 before tax and tip).  I'd likely revisit as the sushi craving hits, solely due to convenience and respectable quality.

I suppose my first mistake is getting sashimi. Learn your lessons, Amelia: don't expect a sushi joint that caters to the lunch crowd to excel at sashimi. I literally had to spit my crab out. And the red snapper had a weird metallic taste to it. But the salmon and maguro were decent. Still, not an experience I'd really want again. Still, I think that the rolls are the big attraction here. I don't really do rolls--plain tuna or salmon would be the extent. But my co-workers seem to enjoy their fried-tempura-mayo-whatever creations.  Prices are quite reasonable, and the lunch specials provide a good bargain when it comes to sushi.  Service is fairly quick, but sometimes there is miscommunication. Rolls don't come out, or come out in duplicates, and then just weirdness results. I once had a server apologize to me because she didn't really understand English. Huh?! While this place can get nuts come noontime, it moves quickly. If you hit it at 1pm, there are always open tables to be had. A large portion of their business is take-out and delivery, so that helps to free up tables. They will accommodate large groups with reservations, I believe.

Anyway this place is in the loop right downtown and has a nice view on a clear day. Parking sucks but what can you do, so we put an hour in the meter ($5) and then head to sushi sai with empty stomachs. Its 7:30 pm on a tuesday and besides us, there are 2 other tables. We put in our orders, several appetizers and sushi stuffs.  20 minutes go by and we get one order of veggie tempura. We finish the tempura and now its 30 minutes into the meal and we are waiting patiently as now im eating soy sauce out of sheer boredom and hunger. I'm confused. Really confused. Wondering what's going on that we had such a tease of one appetizer and nothing else in 40 minutes (as our meter ticks away down to nothing) so i flag down the waitress and ask if there's a problem. Her response is ""Soooorrrryyyyyy i don't speak english..."" with this goofy smile on her face.  Ok lady, i feel sorry for you, but can i get an explanation that makes sense? At least direct me to someone that does speak english.  My friend is far more agitated than i am and is about to lose it, he doesn't want to have to pay the meter and come back also due to the fact that they were closing in less than an hour. another lady comes by and says ""sorry, we had a big order before you"". But then why the ONE appetizer? and really? one big order and the place shuts down? it was so empty in the restaurant. i didn't really have a chance to ask cause my dining buddy had lost it and said we were paying for the one veg tempura then leaving. I sighed and walked away with sushi dreams crushed. This story has a happy ending though. We ended up at sushi para II and in the same amount of time we waited at sushi sai, we finished our entire meal at sushi para II, and the place was full to the brim when we arrived. Its absolutely perplexing to me. Maybe someone can give me an explanation as to why when these restaurants are supposedly owned by the same people, but there is such a huge difference in experience.

I would suggest substituting the rolls with rolls that you like so you're not obligated to eating only those rolls from the lunch box menu, but of course the price will differ.

That being said, I decided to try Sushi Sai as a result of the reviews in this section. Granted there were some good and bad ones, I figured on the average it must just be ""OK"" - and it was. Their AYCE deal is what we went for and for what we got it was worth the money.  Now for the specifics: We stuck to their rolls and got the spicy tuna, spicy salmon, spider, Pop Up, Rock N Roll, Valcano, and rainbow roll. As the former reviews indicated, the rice was sub par and didn't stick too tightly, some of the rolls fell apart very easily. The spicy salmon and tuna was not bad, though they were both served luke warm - also consistent with the other reviews which wasn't very appealing. Their Pop Up roll was decent, and the valcano roll was not impressive - it did have the exact same sauce on top that you can buy at Jewel (Sriracha). Their Rock N Roll was disgusting, the only one we could barely stomach - it had a musty warm fish smell and taste to it - not appetizing. Their rainbow roll was alright but the fish quality didn't seem as high as some of the more prominent Sushi joints in Chicago (pale in color, much more fat). Their Spider Roll was also just okay - just don't pick apart the shrimp to see what you're eating, lots of poop left in them.  The way they make some of their specialty rolls made them difficult to eat. Some pieces were twice as wide as a regular piece and twice as long - very interesting. So, overall the place was just OK.

Although there was only one other table occupied, and they were finished, it took quite a while to order and then to get my food. The sushi rice wasn't quite right: too dry and not enough vinegar. The best of the many nigiri I got was the unagi; the raw stuff was indifferent, except for the maguro, which smelled bad enough to send back: I'm hoping the wasabi killed anything nasty.

In the past few months, the gf and I have hit several, from Ringo's overrated/overpriced offerings to the serviceable House of Sushi & Noodles and Para II.  The included rolls vary from appetizers to nigiri to the simple (smaller) tuna/salmon/etc up to some bigger 6-8 piece selections, with a few $2-3 ""add ons"" of more elaborate rolls. Neither of us sprung for these ""add ons,"" but maybe next time. Cuts of fish were fresh and flavorful with great texture, and the rolls were all great combinations, from simpler Christmas rolls (tuna/avocado) to the Pop-Up (spicy salmon, crab, cucumber, avocado, tempura flake, and tobiko). And the ""spicy"" ones are actually spicy! Always a plus. They're one of the places that seem to let you order as much as you want at one time (unlike HoS&N's 2-at-a-time), so don't let your eyes get bigger than your stomach because as with most AYCE sushi special, you do have to pay for any uneaten food.

2009-12-17,1.0,"Aaron S. and I wandered down to Sushi Sai on Saturday. It was pretty terrible. I think had this been my first experience with sushi it would have ruined sushi for me for ever. It was also the first time I walked out of an AYCE place still hungry, because yes folks it was THAT bad.  Service was lack luster. We were the only ones in the restaurant for the first fifteen minutes or so of our visit, but were not the first to receive our orders. How does that work out? On top of that the shumai we ordered were at best luke warm. Also their all you can option had a very tiny selection. Big bummer.  First round of sushi was ok. Nothing stood out about it, and it had the quality of about something you could buy at Jewel. I wasn't upset by this but when we got our second round is were things REALLY went south.  We had to wait and wait and wait for menus. Then since she walked away from us in less than two seconds, we had to ask her for pens. Which led to more waiting. Aaron asked for water and his water cup was left unattended even after he got the chance to ask for it.  When the sushi came? I really wanted to complain but was our waitress anywhere to be found? Nope. One of things I ordered was the spider roll, which has tempura crab in it, guess what? They left the shells on the crab legs. I don't know what the hell they were thinking but who in their right mind would leave shells on something in a roll of sushi? On top of it being annoying to eat It had NO flavor whatsoever. Aaron could see that I was just trying to get through it and asked if I was getting full I said ""This just doesn't taste good."" He offered me some off his plate, well It was so bad that it made me gag! It tasted very off, and it was mushy. It took everything I had to not vomit all over the table, I am not exaggerating.  In the end Aaron decided our only option here was to duck to the bathroom with our remaining sushi stuffed into a few napkins and flush it down the toilet, pay and get the hell out. (well we had to finish it somehow seeing as they would have charged him extra for unfinished food).  Also the worst part? I felt ill the next day.

2009-12-15,1.0,"Okay so the food here is mediocre.  So if you're in the mood for mediocre sushi at a high price then this is the place for you.   But I am writing tonight about other issues.  A co-worker and I went one week night after working out thinking that sushi sounded light and yummy.  We noticed that this place (we had been there before) had an all you can eat menu for 19.99 this particular night.  Upon reviewing the menu I noticed there was no sashimi on the menu but there was sushi.  Also, it stated on the menu that ""you can order all you want but you must eat it all or pay for the leftovers.""  Weird.  I have been to other, better sushi restaurants that would limit what you could order with each round but never something that oddly stringent.   Anyway, I order three sushi pieces and two rolls.  My co-worker did likewise.  I ate the fish and left the mound of white rice untouched.  And between the two of us we ate all of the rolls except two pieces from a roll we didn't particularly care for.  When we were finally able to get the waitress' attention I asked for another order form.  She said we had to eat everything on the plate.  I explained that we hadn't cared for the one roll and that I didn't want to eat a mound of white rice.  To make a long story short, she refused to let us order more.  And we paid roughly $22 each. To add to the bad experience, we had ordered an item and when we never got it, we ordered it again. It never came.  We ordered tea.  And had to order it again because she forgot.   The rolls in general were stuffed full of white rice and sloppily put together.   I love sushi and this is the only sushi restaurant near my place of work but ,this being the worst sushi experience I've ever had, I will never return to this restaurant and will dissuade others from going there as well.",-0.8108,0.878,0.052,0.07,0.49994444444444447
2009-12-14,1.0,"Sushi Sai, I REALLY wish this were a better review for you.  Believe me, I'm scraping the bottom of the barrel to come up with anything positive that I can use to look back on and rationalize in my mind making another trip and recommending that others do the same - but I can't.  Believe me - I want to, since you're the closest AYCE sushi place to where I live and just minutes away from where I work.  But it doesn't seem meant to be... The slowness and quality just don't make the price and trip worth it in any way. We were the only ones in the restaurant at around 5pm when we came in on a Saturday evening.  We were shown a table and given the full menus and rummaged to find the checklist for the all-you-can-eat deal.  I was dismayed at the lackluster of the items included.  I was further dismayed to find that the ""special""/""good"" items were at the bottom, in a section where you can pay EXTRA to get them.  Sure, the prices were lower than they were on the regular menu a la carte, but why would I pay $5 for a $10 roll when I'm already paying $19.99 for the privilege? First round: went with the miso, shumai (no gyoza/potstickers, Sushi Sai??) and yakitori - then a variety of nigiri sushi and the Spicy Tuna Roll and Volcano Roll. So let's discuss the speed issue.  We were the first/only ones in for 10 minutes and slowly the place half-filled over the next hour.  We were the first to get our appetizers, but not the first to get our sushi.  It took at least 20 minutes... The miso was okay (hard to ruin miso soup), but the shumai were not hot.  Warm at best, one was almost cool inside.  NOT GOOD.  The yakitori was hot, but the chicken was dry and the sauce was very thin. Then came the sushi.  My first nigiri (tuna) was room temp.  NOT GOOD.  The eel was warm, and the tamago was fine.  My rolls were okay, but nothing great.  The ""chili sauce"" on my Volcano was applied directly from a standard-issue Sriracha bottle.  *sigh* It took five minutes of waiting to catch the waitress' attention with empty plates in order to request two more sheets for ordering.  And another three minutes to flag her down for PENS. Round two I went again with shumai, hoping they got their act together - and thankfully these ones were warm/hot!  The second yakitori though was far drier, no improvements on the sauce.  And then the sushi... Now I'm no fancy-pants sushi expert.  I'm just a fat man who likes sushi in mass quantities.  That being said, even I had trouble with these rolls (Sapporo, Palatine and American Dream).  On this round, the tails/shells on our fried items were not removed - not fun to bite into.  The tuna on top of my roll was (there's no other word for it) ""mushy"".  I have no real knowledge on ""sushi quality"", but when a piece of fish feels like mush - even MY standards aren't low enough to call it palatable! For the first time in a LONG time, I had to resort to the ""scoop-n-dump"" technique of hiding my leftovers in a napkin and dumping them in the restroom.  It wasn't difficult to perform this maneuver, as our server was MIA again at the time. My last take on the delays - I sat with an empty water glass for over 15 minutes.  Nobody carrying a pitcher, checking up on water levels.  No check-up from the waitress so I could request more water myself until 15 minutes had gone by, and then she poured water from a pitcher that was sitting on some random table - all the ice had melted.  Getting the check required a 5-minute wait until I could flag her down again and make the request. The problem is that she was the only one as hostess, server and busboy.  The place was only half-full, but you need more than ONE staff member doing that!  I saw one sushi chef and one chef peeking out behind curtains for hot food.  I may have seen one extra dude sitting on a chair by the phone.  That's IT?  For a Saturday night service? Maybe they're better-staffed during the day on weekdays, but I doubt it.  There are enough complaints about service from other reviewers who have 60 minutes for lunch - me and my 30 minutes wouldn't stand a chance. This all-you-can-eat deal was more about ""can eat"" than anything else.  My GF felt hungry upon leaving and felt ill the next day.  My stomach is made of iron, but it also left unfilled due to taste bud complaints that night. I wish my experience here had been better.  I had hope, Sushi Sai.  And now you have my $40.00+ and the mushy sushi and poor service that led to a low tip.

The first bad sign was when the waitress put me and my husband at a table that literally was a few feet from the door, so anytime a person walked in, our napkins flew off the table. Being in the Windy City, this was annoying and discouraging. My vegetable tempura which I always order anytime I'm at a Japanese place, came out incredibly bad. The frying oil that day was rancid and it made the dish unpalatable. When frying oil gets stale, it also makes everything else worse. The vegetables were undercooked and the tempura fry was oily and the opposite of flaky. The sashimi and miso soup were decent. The sushi that we ordered, however,  was awful. The rice was dry and old. The seaweed was weirdly limp, and there was no rice vinegar!!! The whole thing tasted off and worst of all the rancid frying oil ruined the spider roll by saturating the sushi with old shoe leather taste. I couldn't stomach more than a piece. My intrepid husband tried to eat the whole plate. He suffered for it later. The sole bright spot was the Nabe Yake Udon, which was decent.

The all you can eat menu is pretty substantial, they have about 10 apps to choose from, a few standard maki with 1-2 ingredients, and quite a few of the special maki too.  Then the bottom has items that cost extra, but there is plenty on the standard menu to get you mighty full. Shrimp shumai appetizer - it's 4 pieces of very tiny shumai.  I've had this exact same shumai at home - out of the freezer case from Chinatown.  Pass.   Salmon nigiri is awesome.  Huge piece of excellent quality salmon - not fishy tasting or smelly at all, rice was still warm.  The white tuna is also awesome.  Do not get the crab sushi though, it was about a 3"" pc of imitation crab meat, wrapped in a bit of seaweed, and the rice.  Yuck.  I ate this first so I wouldn't get charged (do they actually charge you for uneaten pieces...?)   I have had mixed service here.  The first few times the service was awesome, pretty attentive, and the maki came out decently quick for it being pretty busy.  But the last time I went with a few friends, I think we had a new waitress. We had to ask multiple times for water and she never brought out the appetizer we asked for, again, multiple times.  The maki also took forever to come out, not sure if it was because the waitress never put the order in, or the kitchen was busy.  I think the former. I think that there was an awesome fish to rice ratio - I don't think they short changed on the fish at all.  I am so anxious to go back and try more rolls!  My fave rolls are: Mountain , Michigan , Spider , Shrimp tempura, Pop Up.  The Spider and Shrimp Tempura are awesome if you like cooked fish - they are humongous.  I could probably eat one roll and a couple pcs of nigiri and be a happy camper. Least fave roll I've had so far is their Philly roll.  Yuck. WAY too much cream cheese, like a 1/2 inch in each piece!

I never visited for lunch so can't comment on service at that time, but it's been a great dinner option for me because I'm close to the loop and downtown empties out, making parking right outside easy. Just a note for those going for the first time - Sushi Sai is on the north end of the building off the street, so it actually opens out onto Randolph. I usually go with a couple friends after work or on the weekend and naturally we get the all-you-can-eat for $19.99 every time, which is a real bargain given that going anywhere else in the city means paying at least $3/piece for nigiri. I've had pretty much every non-premium sushi on the menu, and they're all very acceptable. I also enjoy indulging in their maki, particularly the Green Dragon, Volcano, Michigan, and Chicago rolls. Now, of course not everything about Sushi Sai is wonderful (ah, but if only it could be for $19.99....). For one, the rice-to-fish ratio isn't great. Also, fish quality expectations should be tempered a bit; while the quality is acceptable in my book, it is a distinct level below Chicago's top spots. They also charge extra for certain nigiri and rolls; now of course this is fine, but my problem is that they don't subsidize the cost for all-you-can-eat customers much if at all (for example, the uni price is the same regardless of whether all-you-can-eat was ordered).

The service is usually friendly but pretty slow. The sushi they make sits directly in front of the people eating at the bar until someone comes and gets it, which can be while. It really grossed me out seeing all the people sitting at the sushi bar breath and cough on the sushi before it was brought to a table (I was sitting at the sushi bar).",0.7153,0.844,0.096,0.06,0.5422222222222223

We each had the house salad, I'm a fan of their dressing. Then we ordered 3 different rolls. We've order 2 out of the 3 before and when they all come to the table we were very pleased with the new selection. The under control roll is my fav!  We will be back for lunch again, not to mention I might stop in and take some home, since the sushi place near me isn't nearly as good as this place.",0.9038,0.813,0.147,0.04,0.5068181818181818
2009-04-16,3.0,"Finally got over here yesterday with a few friends for lunch.  Luckily, I had read the other reviews, so I was prepared to wait a bit and knew about the lunch specials not being on the check-off menu.  I went with four different rolls and was totally happy with quality and quantity.  My two friends also stuck with rolls and one appetizer.  Service was friendly, but achingly slow - we got there at 12:10 and at 1:00 were stil getting portions of our meal.  We finally got our check and got out at 1:40.  The spicy tuna roll in particular is really a generous portion and the tempura was pretty good as well.  I also tried the Paul's Roll, which had tempura shrimp on the inside and eel and avocado (they claimed cucumber, but it wasn't) on the outside - yummy! Another thing to watch out for is the cramped space at the tables - if you are not normal sized, you will not be able to fit in these chairs once the tables behind you and in front of you are filled.  I literally had the table so close to my chest that there was no need for a napkin!  Fire hazard anyone? I'll be back, when I have the luxury of a long lunch - but I might also call in an order for pick up as the food was delicious!  Oh, and 10 rolls, 1 appetizer and 3 drinks was only about $75.  Definitely not bad for the Loop.",0.991,0.796,0.177,0.027,0.5972222222222222

While there was a wide variety of options on the menu, I found that the rolls didn't taste as fresh as I would have liked.  The seaweed was on the chewy side and the rice was chewy as well.  Avocado was a bit mushy.   Maybe it was just a an off day, but I'm not enticed enough to try again. Update:  It has been 2 hours since I ate here and I feel awful.  Downgrading to 1 star.  Buyer beware!",-0.5458,0.861,0.053,0.086,0.6422077922077921

Despite the review I'd go back and give it a second chance.  I didnt get a chance to taste their rolls.  Maybe those are better?  The sashmi I had was decent for being pre-cut.  A little thick, but at least it had flavor and wasnt dry.

2008-10-03,5.0,"My star rating may be a little biased but I truly enjoyed my fist experience at Sushi Sai!! First of all, I was cold and hungry as I left work at 4 PM and on a whim turn on my heel and walked on in.  The place was peacefully empty yet beautifully simple - with warm-colored wood chairs and big windows, where I opted to sit.   The miso soup wasn't as full of tofu as Id like but was darn tasty and warming, and at $1.50 - exactly the right price!    Also, when I ordered the large hot sake and the girl looked at me as if I was insane - I now know why! It seems so many places give you a large hot sake and it is not at all large. Not only was *this* sake good, warm, and strong - it was seemingly endless and lasted throughout the duration of my meal! As for the sushi itself - it was hard to pick because so many sounded great! ( I cant wait to go back and try more - I am sure my sis will want their ""Volcano Roll"" ).   I ordered the""Pop Up Roll""  (I mean what a great name!)  which comes with: spicy salmon, crab, shrimp, cucumber, avocado inside, tempura chip and tobiko on top. I love tobiko and the fish was *So* fresh! You didnt even need to add soy sauce to this masterfully crafted roll! (though I did enjoy shoving the juicy, fresh, decadent sushi/cucumber/avocado mixture in my mouth as I used the rice and seaweed separately to soak up my soy sauce/wasabi mixture as well as my red chili sauce!) YUM YUM As a Final note - and as I typically do - I ordered the Unagi on rice as my dessert (tho only 1 to an order) and was so pleased to finally - for the first time in I dont know how long - have a large, sweet, well-textured, soft piece of eel to finish up my meal!!   These people actually still *Care* about the quality of their product!

Why yes I would eat sushi every single day if I could. I had these rolls: veggie ($3.50), asparagus ($3.95), and sweet potato (price isn't on the carryout menu, but I think it was $3.50).

2008-06-09,2.0,"Based on several visits in the past but no visits going forward, Sushi Sai gets 4 stars for sushi and a big fat zero for service. In terms of quality of sushi, this is your best lunchtime option in the loop. I usually get Lunch option C, which is a unagi roll - deliciously NOT doused in eel sauce. And a volcano roll; I forget what is actually in it but it was very tasty. The truly awful: they give you a sheet to check off what you want to order to reduce miscommunication, a great idea except none of the lunch combos are listed. And then the fun begins. First, there's a 20-30 minute wait. then they bring you the wrong order. Or if they brought you the right order, say Combo C, they'd tell you it's Combo B. Then when you tell the waiter that you actually ordered C, he'll say ""oh yes, this is C"".  Then the fun continues with paying the check, which takes another 20 minutes to arrive. Then of course one of my coworkers decide to pay with a credit card. I should've taken his card to the register and swiped it myself.

I had the recommended crazy tuna roll and enjoyed it throughly.  A big piece of pepper tuna (coated in, well, pepper and then lightly seared) with avocado and tuna on top.  Not particularly spicy, but a nice mix of flavors a filling.  The medium fatty tuna was excellent. I went on a Sunday evening and basically had the place to myself.  I kind of wonder if they are just experimenting with the hours right now and eventually this wouldn't have been a time they'd be open. They've also got a kitchen to serve up hot dishes, so if you're shy about the raw stuff, you can still eat here.  It looks as if the whole menu can also be prepared in a take-out fashion, with a menu you can carry out as well.",0.9513,0.829,0.145,0.026,0.5672993672993673

Needless to say, Sushi Sai gets the first star for location, location, location. As far as the sushi...well, there was room for improvement but it was good.  I ordered a California roll and a spicy salmon roll.  The California was fine - larger pieces than I have had at other sushi spots.  The spicy salmon was.....loose.  Very liquidy and kinda fell apart.   So,  I'll give them time to earn more stars - I think they may have only been open since yesterday so perhaps still working out the kinks but this is definitely a welcome addition to a sushi deadzone. UPDATE:  I was so excited about sushi in my building that I ate it two days in a row.  Seriously, the prices are comparable to the nutritional nightmare that is Corner Bakery and its so much tastier.  I ordered a spicy tuna roll and this one was also not rolled tightly and the filling was still liquidy but I am thinking that is just how they do ""spicy""... one more star for you, Sushi Sai.",0.9355,0.845,0.103,0.052,0.6243197278911564
