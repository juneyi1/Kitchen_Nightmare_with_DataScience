How convenient, I was immediately attended to and asked to sit at the bar. They were busy, so it was nice to be sat right away. Johnny the bartender, was really friendly, and informative. He gave us great reccomendations, and also made some great tasting drinks!!! When it came to what I ordered I started off with their roasted beets beets Beet salad. All I can say is amazing, flavorful and it's nice that they give you red, gold and striped beets. Next I felt like indulging in there margherita pizza. It's not a deep dish which was nice, because I needed something light and not too greasy. Its great that Maxwell's offers a great balance of healthy options and indulgent food items on their menu! The manager Katherine even checked in to see if we were having a great experience.

Came here for dinner on Friday with my friend that is also a member: Starters- Shrimp cocktail, nothing to write home about. I only got one of the 2 scratch made sauces for some reason and the cocktail sauce was seriously  lacking horseradish  Oysters - ordered by my friend she said they were delicious  Dinner- Crab cake, grilled asparagus, baked potato - bit into a few shells. Had a lot of crab, tender, potato was something you would get at wendy's. Asparagus was nicely grilled Scallops- my friend said they were good she got 4 normal sized and one tiny which was weird. Dessert- Did not have the ability to order due to missing last call for dinner at 9:30 Service- Took our waiter a good 10 minutes to come to the table.  Water glasses sat empty for 10 to 15 minutes until I flagged the busser. Waiter never came to check on us after dropping the food. Icing on the cake- the waiter brings our entrées to the table drops the food and tells us we have 3 minutes until the kitchen  is closed so if we need anything else we need to order it right now. That would have been nice to know from the beginning so I could have looked at the dessert menu prior to 3 minutes before ""last call"". I have never in my life had that happen to me. Why take 8:30 and 9:00 reservations?  As we are eating dinner they are plopping silverware on all the tables around us and cleaning up the Italian buffet. Really a great eating experience with all of that going on around us.  Finally after having last call when we finished dinner we could not get the waiters attention to get the check to leave and get dessert elsewhere.

It's a perfect place for a business lunch during the week and we meet people there often. The food is excellent as is the service. I like that they give you calorie counts on the menu so you can eat healthy if you want. That being seaid, the flatbread served with each meal is to die for. Their dinner menu is equally enticing.

2014-04-30,2.0,"Based on enthusiastic Yelp reviews and a preponderance of delicious-sounding menu items, I was really looking forward to my lunch here. Boy, was I disappointed. The food was not very good and it was expensive.  I ordered the Brussels sprouts salad and the tuna steak sandwich. My husband got the soup of the day (Manhattan clam chowder) and the seafood tacos.  I would say the salad would be a good choice for anyone who needs to be tricked into eating Brussels sprouts (if you like sprouts, you might feel cheated). The veggies were raw, shaved into a mound of ultra-fine ribbons. I could have been eating any green vegetable, really. The vinaigrette was light, fresh, and citrusy. The salad was just okay. Not something I'd order again, but I'd probably remember it more fondly if the rest of the meal had gotten better.  My tuna steak was unevenly cooked: well done at one end, and rare at the other. It was served on top of a too-sweet Asian slaw (horrible) with a side of standard burger accoutrements: lettuce, tomato, half a pickle, onions. The two sets of sandwich toppings didn't seem to go together at all, and the bun was so soft I ended up eating just the tuna and veggies (not slaw) with a knife and fork.  I guess Manhattan clam chowder is tomato-based? It was pretty ordinary.  The seafood tacos were a massive amount of food (three heaped tacos, mostly fish), but were incredibly bland.  One thing I did enjoy: their dessert menu includes ""full sized"" dessert items ($5-6), and mini desserts ($3). I have always wished that restaurants would offer small desserts for less money. We shared the chocolate mousse cup (chocolate mousse in a little ""cup"" shell of chocolate), and it was delightful.",0.9867,0.849,0.128,0.023,0.518080693815988

2010-11-29,4.0,"This review is based on a one-time experience, having Thanksgiving dinner at Maxwell's in 2010. Maxwell's is the restaurant in the East Bank club. For their Thanksgiving dinner they had a veritable smorgazborg, including: *the most jumbo shrimp I've ever seen *smoked whitefish *an assortment of cold salads and pates *side dishes galore including a delectable butternut squash casserole cooked with pecans, cranberries and butter.  *a honey glazed salmon that melted in the mouth *prime rib, cooked on the rare side, to the elation of one of my fellow diners *leg of lamb *Turkey (dark and white meat, and gravy or course)  *Lots of dessert options--those to be honest didn't look that great to me and were heavy on the non traditional (lots of cupcakes, cookies, and lemon squares--not a lot in the way of pie) but I was too stuffed for dessert anyway. The one low note for me was the brussell sprouts...they were so hard they were basically inedible. But there was so many other nummmy things that it didn't really bother me. Basically there was something for everyone, whether you enjoy traditional thanksgiving foods or not. I didn't pay for dinner--I assume it cost a pretty penny--but could be worth it  if you don't feel like cooking and want to chow down.

2010-03-14,4.0,"If you ever need an idea for a Friday night dinner, I highly recommend checking out the Italian/Pasta Buffet at Maxwell's located inside the East Bank Club. Full disclosure, I am a member of EBC and have close connections to people at the Club and love many aspects of the country's best health club. That being said, it doesn't change or affect my opinion about one of the best deals in town on a Friday night ($28/adults $12/children for all you can eat Italian antipasto and make-it-yourself pasta bar, plus dessert). We started by ordering off the menu a small starter to have with our cocktails, ahi tuna bites. Nice little pieces of tuna served on tortilla with avocado, corn and salsa. The tuna was a bit overcooked to my liking, but the flavors were all a nice way to start the meal and don't leave you feeling stuffed.  The Italian night features a make your own pasta bar, but that is not the only option. Next to the salads, cheese and salami starters you can dive into risotto, shrimp, or turkey. I love their Caesar salad, and the asparagus risotto was the best I've had in a long time. If you like your risotto well cooked cheesy you won't be able to stick to one helping. I added some pieces of salami and asparagus next to my Caesar to make a wonderful plate.  I was craving a healthy pasta dish with lots of veggies so I added everything available to whole wheat linguini. The three other pasta options included mushroom ravioli, zita and penne.  I asked for basil pesto sauce, but there are other options such as tomato, plain olive oil and Alfredo. The chef made a great healthy plate for me without using too much oil or cheese. It is a health club after all.  I enjoyed my creation so much that I could have gone back a couple of more times. I showed restraint, especially knowing the dessert course was around the corner. The options for the final course are gelato, sorbet or cannoli. I went with the sorbet, and it was a fantastic way to clean my palate and leave me refreshed at the end of the meal. Again, I'm quite partial when it comes to all things EBC, but it's undisputed that a $28 Italian night dinner is great value for great food.

The selection was fresh, extensive and as high quality as one could find at any restaurant. The combination of service and value (even if one were to pay) is unbeatable. By the way, we have since gone back for Lobster night and the Italian buffet.  The Italian foods were simply incredible for a buffet.  Get this, the waiter encouraged us to go up to the buffet, grab a plate of food, sample and then decide if we wanted the buffet.  Our choice and no cost if we changed our minds.  The Osso Bucco was as good as Hole in the Wall.

2009-07-16,5.0,"Really stunned not more people have visited Maxwell's.  The theme to most restaurants I've been to lately has been the almighty ""special"".  I first heard of Maxwell's at the EBC from UrbanDaddy b/c of a prime rib special on Thursdays, which apparently has been extended indefinitely. Upon entry, Maxwell's is nice - extraordinary for a fitness club restaurant, definitely not to be confused with a coffee shop, although obviously not quite a high-end dining establishment.  We made reservations per recommendation of the website and were promptly seated upon arrival. Our server was very courteous.  Michael A's review mentioned that Maxwell's only opened up to the public back in May; certainly I didn't feel any less important as clientele b/c I wasn't a member of EBC, although the hostess did inquire.  Our server explained the special(s) without us poking/prodding about it; the 10/14 oz portion was $18.95/$24.95, prepared with 2 carrots (these were some serious carrots, not celery-stick sized) and a side, with options for au jus and a whipped horseradish sauce.   The wine offerings at EBC were quite plentiful...and very reasonable!  Many bottles between $25-40, which made Landmark the previous night seem much more expensive even at 1/2 off.  Seeing as we were eating meat, a full-bodied Malbec seemed appropriate. Our prime ribs came cooked to perfection, no issues with being overdone, tender, but not overly juicy.  Our sides (butternut squash, spinach, brussel sprouts) all tasted decent and healthy, even. A quick glance at the rest of the menu revealed that prices at Maxwell's is, like the wine list, quite reasonable.  Lot of entrees between $15-25.  From the website, there are other ""special"" nights such as lobster night or pasta night, but imo, not as worth it as prime rib night. Our meal was very enjoyable, there was live music (mostly playing cheesy stuff, but engaging) as we ate, service was excellent (our water glasses never reached half empty).  More people should come to check it out!",0.9803,0.866,0.112,0.022,0.5546374458874459

The waiter keeps refilling your bread plate (if you choose) with a selection of fresh breads: sourdough, whole grain (homemade, I understand), and a fantastic herb flatbread. We couldn't resist trying their ""slider"" appetizer (turkey, steak and tuna burgers), which took the lowly burger to new heights.  I ordered the broiled whitefish with toasted almond butter sauce, and boy, oh boy did I call it correctly. My sister had the organic free-range chicken. She received a large piece of perfectly roasted chicken (a thigh and leg), and she also got a side of garlic-mashed potatoes - she said they were the best EVER. We ordered a bottle of organic wine (can't remember the name) that was quite tasty. To cap off the meal, we ordered dessert...and that could possibly be the best thing I've had to eat all year. The chocolate soufflé was heaven, and the coconut-covered ice cream was to die for! Overall everyone had a great time and the night was perfect.
