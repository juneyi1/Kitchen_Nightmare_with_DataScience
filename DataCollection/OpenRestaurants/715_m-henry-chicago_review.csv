There were two layers of pancakes, and the bottom one had blackberries in it. GENIUS. So good. I would feel bad not finishing it (but I did with a little help). It is a lot, so if you shared that would make sense. BUT it's so good that you probably wouldn't want to share. ALSO the fried egg sandwich is good.

My sister and I went on a Saturday afternoon and we were able to get a table pretty quickly. The hostess at the front was super nice and friendly. The pastries at the front looked delicious. We didn't try them, but maybe something to go back for next time.  The food is painfully average and very forgettable. The latte I had was not good--milky, watery and tasted like any generic latte you'd get at a diner. If you're supposed to have a bakery/coffee station in your restaurant, the coffee drinks should be spot on. Disappointing.  For food, I had the dandelion omelette with potatoes and French bread. French bread was good quality. Potatoes were good with peppers, but were just normal breakfast potatoes. The omelette with the dandelion, which I was looking forward to the most, was a huge let down. I couldn't really distinguish any flavor from it; the cheese it was filled with was good but that's all you can taste.  We also got the lemon French toast. It wasn't too sweet, which was good, but again nothing to awe at. It was looked super pretty though.  Overall, an acceptable place to brunch. If you aren't able to get a table quickly, don't fret.

I wasn't sure what to expect from the cakes, but their flavor was not super bean-y and were absolutely delicious. I got my eggs sunny side up - cooked to perfection. The sauce of the rancheros was flavorful and kind of reminded me of a classic enchilada sauce. All the flavors combined were incredible.

My omelet was nicely done. Potatoes were ok, toast was close to burnt. The chicken sausage was overpowered with spices that made it close to inedible.

Parking was a little hard at first, but I was able to find some non metered side street parking a block away. We went for brunch around 11:45 on a Saturday and only had to wait 5 minutes. Once seated our server came over right away and we placed our non alcoholic drink orders (place is BYOB) and an order of the cinnamon French toast to share. OMG that French toast is soooo good! It's comes with sweetened cream cheese in the middle surrounded by fresh fruit. It is a must order. For my meal I had the fried egg sandwich and it was good. The side of potatoes it came with were my favorite cause they were seasoned perfectly. My friend ordered the drunken eggs entree with the black bean cakes and she enjoyed it. What makes this place 5 stars is the quality, portion size of food, and the prices. We ordered a coke, apple juice, and 3 plates (which were all delicious) and our bill came to $40.

The side salad it came with was lightly dressed which was to our liking. It was a generous salad and not just some spring mix thrown into the plate.  The Shrimp and Crab Cake Benedict was so incredibly fresh and each bite sent us to heaven! The cakes were not just full of filler like bread crumbs like at some other places, there were crab meat in each bite. The Pancetta Benedict was topped with just the most perfect poached egg! The creamy egg yolk just made the overall dish so mouth watering. The Pancetta was not overly salty and the slice was generous.  The French Toast was not overly sweet since the tartness of the berries matched well with the sweetness. The portion was generous and great for sharing with the table.

However, I am sharing the reason why I will never return to this restaurant. Went to m.henry for Sunday brunch, knowing that there is always a long wait. When I checked in with the hostess, she said it would be ""at least 30 minutes"". However, after an hour, we still were not seated. Again, we knew the wait was going to be long, but how can she underestimate the wait time by 100%? After waiting for an hour, we were already invested -- so we stayed. So, i said to her -- ""we have been waiting a long time"". She went into a rage, and said: ""THIS IS A BUSY RESTAURANT, YOU CAN GO SOMEWHERE ELSE"".  Wow. After we paid for the check (because we did not want anything for free) I asked to speak to the manager, and when he approached the table he said ---- before saying anything else: ""you waited a long time, but it was not an hour -- what else?"" Double Wow. After 5 minutes of him telling me how busy they were, I asked him whether I could tell him about my experience. At the end, he apologized, and said that he would talk to the hostess. I realize the restaurant is busy (most restaurants would be ecstatic of the popularity). I also know that people have ""bad"" days. However, I can think of at least 7 brunch spots in Chicago that are significantly better than m.henry, where their clients are appreciated, or at least not insulted.

When we sat down, nobody came to wait on our table, or even take our drink orders. We had to ask a busboy to send our waiter. At that point, we ordered our coffee and food at the same time. Our coffee arrived promptly, but the table next to us, that ordered after we did, received their food first.  The food was quite good. We shared the killer fried egg sandwich and the blackberry pancakes. I can't say the food was hot and our waiter never came back to check on us in case anything was wrong.

Our order came out promptly and was on point. I had the quiche with green salad, which had a phenomenal buttery crust and great ratio of goat cheese to veggies to eggs. Very savory. The salad had some special touches like pea sprouts, a few delicious radish slices, and a good dressing. The bliss cakes were excellent!  Not overly sweetened, really fluffy, and the mascarpone/fruit combo was blissful!  The potatoes were also on point- great herby seasoning and melt in your mouth texture.  I was very impressed with how well prepared they were for our table of 4 adults and 2 toddlers. When we sat down, they had covered plastic cups of water with straws ready, and brought a small fresh fruit plate for both kids immediately. When refilling coffee, they took the cup away from the table to avoid risk of burns, and hot plates were put down carefully and strategically away from small hands.  You've earned my business!",0.9977,0.644,0.333,0.023,0.5930224867724868

I stopped by here with a friend this time and we ordered the Pancetta Benedict and the Blueberry Bliss Cakes to share (both were daily special, I believe). The Benedict was honestly pretty average-tasting. Being a brunch addict, I have eaten many, many Benedicts in the past and this one did not stand out in particular. The potatoes on the side had a strange flavor that I couldn't quite identify...in addition, they were a bit too mushy for my taste. On the other hand, the Blueberry Bliss Cakes were absolutely fantastic! The pancakes themselves were extremely fluffy and the addition of crunchy granola on top provided a nice textural contrast. In addition, the dish was beautifully presented and the dusting of powdered sugar on top made for a nice picture. If I am to return to M. Henry in the future, I would most definitely order the pancakes again. I would not order the Benedict again but rather try a different item on the menu. I highly recommend ordering the Blueberry Bliss Cakes (daily special) or the Blackberry Bliss Cakes (a regular menu item) since both were wonderfully delicious!",0.9941,0.751,0.237,0.012,0.49499215070643643

Having the combination of sweet and savory was heaven. So happy we split them so that I could try both. Our food came quickly. We did have to ask each time to refill our waters, but overall ok with that. Being that two of us are vegetarians, this had a lot to offer us. My biggest gripe was in our wait. We checked in and were told a 30-40 minute wait for our party of 3. We saw many, many parties who arrived after us get seated before us. We did question it with the hostess and she explained that the majority of their tables were 2 tops, which made sense. We finally got seated after an hour and 40 minutes, one hour longer than expected. What irked me was that there were 4 top tables that we could have been sat at, as there were parties of 4 that arrived after, but still got seated before us. Just not a good feel from the front of the house. Felt she could have been more accommodating, like explaining this at the beginning, or recognizing our wait time and doing something to speed our time along when everyone else, even larger parties were sat before. We were very close to walking away when we finally got called. Quite disappointing as I was in town for the weekend and we decided not to go to Batter and Berries based off of their wait time.

2016-09-01,5.0,"m.henry is the only brunch spot that not only convinced me to eat the fruit most include as damn near decoration on the side of your dish but championed and renewed fruit breakasts altogether for me. I'm a fan of savory and sweet (chocolate and all of it's friends) breakfasts classically. Usually when you try to sneak fruit into my dish I feel like you're slipping me vitamins, which I prefer upfront and in gummy form. But this.... I had the home comfort brunch plate, my wife had the florentine shrimp / crab cake bennie, and my mother-in-law had the killer fried egg sandwich. The potatoes evolved into their Stefan equivalent. My comfort plate, when dropped in front of me, seemed tiny. Until I ate it down to the last piece of mango and realized ""They sized this portion down to the absolute last bite"" and was satisfied. Which I'm opting for in my old age more than being overwhelmed (no offense Hash House a Go-Go). The eggs we're light and blendt (?) with that polenta probably by way of wand (I'm guessing hawthorn with phoenix feather), plus even after hearing that pork is the slowest protein for your body to digest I think about theirs when a daydream settles in. I finished my mother in laws sandwich (bacon to egg sandwich coverage, check), and after my wife offered me one bite of her benedict (out of courtesy) I never saw it again. Was gonna throw 4 stars on this because the waiter seemed a bit rushed, a bit spread thin, but I respect people who stick with a theme this much. That they went the e.e. cummings route and their art on the walls foreshadowed the best dish of the whole brunch floored me. It was some sort of peach french toast I can't find on their menu, lets call it Peach Amazing. Vanilla sauce amok, roasted peaches, some to soft some al dente, and the toast just the right kind of small to keep the peaches mountainous (queue the 112). We came later, had zero wait to be seated, but we'd have still made the right decision if it was 30 to 45 and we'll text you. (I'm getting old. A brunch spot has to meet the algorithm of availability + deliciousness + space + service at minimum to be amazing. This place hit that AP 4.2 GPA status with the art.) All understand and dead on.

2016-06-26,3.0,"Came with a friend right around 8:30am on a Saturday and they already had a fair number of people there! I love how this place is decorated. They make really great use of the small space by placing different styles of windows all over the restaurant to provide some privacy in between tables and to give an extra charm to the space. Note that they have a specials menu that didn't go up until around 9am and the waiter didn't mention anything about it when we ordered so come after 9 if you're a ""specials"" kind of person.  In terms of food, the coffee is a bit pricier at $3.25 for organic house blend bottomless coffee. The wait for the food to arrive was very reasonable. We saw many more tables fill up throughout the duration of our meal. I ordered the dandelion, shallot, and leek omelette with house potatoes. This came with a side of toast that I thought was damn good lol. Maybe it's a post workout carb craving or just really good bread. The omelette was tasty but the flavor of the ingredients was very subtle. If anything, the fontinella cheese shone through the most with hints of bitterness every now and then from the dandelion greens. House potatoes were seasoned really well and really tasty. Loved the plating and how they added a couple slices of fruit to help brighten up the plate.  While I thought the food here was good, I wasn't super super impressed like I am with other breakfast/brunch places. The menu is pretty small and not too many ""inventive"" and unique items. They didn't have any eggs benedict option which I was disappointed about. Overall a nice place that I'd come to again if other friends wanted to come!",0.9828,0.772,0.163,0.065,0.5999719887955182

The turkey sausage patties are also well seasoned to give an enjoyable and unique flavor.  Price is a little on the high side: around 11 dollars for most meals.

I'm from out of town, so yes I drove here but considering this wasn't in the heart of Chicago, I was hoping for more parking options but its very limited and a bit of a walk. That being said, I really did like this place! We went for brunch cause my friend and I were staying near by and we saw this place on yelp. I called ahead around 1 PM to see if there was a wait because Sunday brunches are usually busy no matter where you are, I was very pleased that they told us to just come in.  When we got there, we stood there for honestly a decent amount of time before someone came up to us and greeted us and seated us. It was busy but by no means full and slammed. It seems to me that there was only one hostess.  I ordered Jorge's black bean cakes with drunken eggs and a homemade lemonade. The food was delicious! The black bean cakes were very flavorful and not at all dry. The eggs I ordered scrambled with soy chorizo and they were AMAZING! I usually hate chorizo because its very greasy but the soy had all the flavor but non of the oil! I would recommend it to everyone! Even if you eat meat, you should def try it! The lemonade was great as well! You can tell it was fresh made and it was not overly sweet but still had a bit of tartness at the end!

2016-06-08,1.0,My wife and i came here looking for good brunch place. We read and the reviews and decided on m henry. What a mistake. I dropped my wife off amd went to park. They wouldnt seat her until i was there. Ok thats fine. But once i showed up it took 10 mins plus to find the hostess to let her know we were both there. And even after i did she was rude and unfriendly.  Our server came right away amd wanted us to order. We told him we weren't ready. He finally did come back about 15 mins later to finally take our order. After receiving our coffee my wife had to ask multiple times for silverware.  Food came out quickly and was just alright. I had to ask for more silverware since i didnt get a fork. And that took another 5 mins to come.  My wife ordered the blackberry bliss pancakes which she said were just alright but not great. I ordered the fried egg sandwich which was ehh. Nothing special especially given the 11 dollar price. The worst part was it came with one piece of bacon on the sandwich. Overall poor quality on the food.  Once ready to leave our server walked by multiple times once we were ready to pay and leave and ignored us. Not the best especially how busy they were and others wanting to take our table.  With so many brunch possibilities go somewhere else especially with the wait times.

The interior is nice, kind of a rustic artsy kind of place. Our server was very nice and fairly attentive for a busy Sunday morning. The food was good and they get an A+ for presentation. I got the cinnamon roll French toast which is exactly what it sounds like, a cinnamon roll on top of a piece of French toast with a little icing in-between and fruit on the side. It was very good although the top of the cinnamon roll was a little bit burnt. Price-wise it was a little high but not too overly priced.

I ordered the drunken chile relleno (I think that was the name) and he ordered the lime curd french toast.  My dish was fine, but was certainly nothing special.  His dish consisted of two measly pieces of  thin bread, about a pound and a half of whipped cream, and some lime curd drizzled around the plate.   The server took our order and then proceeded to go missing for the rest of our visit.  My boyfriend ordered coffee and his cup didn't get refilled once.  The check was finally dumped at our table after we stared at our empty plates for about ten minutes.

I also tried the BLACKBERRY BLISSCAKES which have fresh blackberries in a blackberry syrup and with the granola - mwah!  Delicious. I also recommend the FRENCH TOAST BLISSCAKES which were smothered in a fruit sauce and had the right amount of sweet, cream, fruit, and French toast flavor. I recommend them all! Price- reasonable. You're looking at about $10/person for food.  Atmosphere- fun and they have these cool hanging Windows that adds to a neat ambiance.  Wait - on a Saturday at 10, we waited about 15 minutes.

You'll walk in and there will probably be a line and then you'll be led into a crowded area where someone will point you towards your table instead of leading you and then you'll wait 5-15 min for the waiter. You'll get your waiter and then bam 10 minutes your food comes, that's not long at all right? But, after you eat you are going to wait 25-35 minutes just to see your waiter again so that you can get the check which means AVOID the bottomless drinks you'll only reach the bottom once.

2016-03-21,4.0,"My partner Chris and I finally made it here for Sunday brunch and overall, it was a good time. Both of us feel though that the initial ""waiting for a table phase"" should be improved. The hostess gave off a weird vibe. When Chris first approached her to put our name in, her greeting was, ""Are you with the party of 9?"" He replied, ""No, my name is Chris."" Hostess: ""What? What party are you in?"" Chris: ""I'd like to put my name in for 2."" Hostess: ""Oh, ok, so what's your name?"" Chris: ""I told you my name is Chris."" The exchange quickly brought her discombobulated nature into the spotlight. She did not welcome us into the restaurant which was disappointing. She told us that the wait time would be 10 minutes but it ended up being 20 minutes.  The meal experience was decent. I ordered the Cinnamon Roll Brioche French Toast. The vanilla neufchatel cream between the cinnamon roll and the french toast was oh so yummy. Crunchy granola on top was fun. Loved the fruit (pear and peach slices, cherries and blackberries) that accompanied the dish as well. The mix of savory and sweet was perfect. Also enjoyed the breakfast potatoes. I didn't realize before ordering the French Toast that it was named Food Network's #1 Brunch dish. It was definitely delicious and was the right amount of food but still not sure about it having such an accolade. Chris ordered Fannie's Killer Egg Sandwich with a side of turkey sausage and breakfast potatoes. He was annoyed that the giant sandwich and both sides all came on the same small plate. Everything tasted delicious he said and the egg was cooked very well but bizarrely, everything was cold. He didn't want to wait to eat any longer so he didn't send it back. Flavors were definitely there though. Our waitress was friendly and prompt.

LOL The service here is excellent, as is the food. The waitstaff always made sure we had everything we needed and then some. The menu has your typical breakfast/lunch fare but with a modern twist. They have a daily specials menu that had some pretty cool sounding offerings like a smoked salmon omelette (which my friend ordered and said was good), but I went for the dandelion, leek, onion omelette off the regular menu and WOW! I know omelettes aren't really anything very fancy, but this is one of the best I've had. Very fluffy, and I really enjoyed the fillings. The roasted potatoes that came with it were very nice as well. The portion sizes are nice and so are the prices! They also have a display case full of pies and other baked goods that you can order. My friends and I shared a slice of the lemon pie which was one of the best lemon pies I've had. The filling was perfectly tart and the crust was a very nice graham cracker crust.

The salad had a mix of greens, dried cranberries, and a light vinaigrette that complemented the quiche. After my friends and I finished our meals, we decided to share a slice of their lemon pie. It was really good and different from the typical pie that you would usually eat. The crust was more of a graham cracker crust and the lemon custard had small dollops of cherry.

2016-01-28,3.0,"I am truly writing this review with a heavy heart. After hearing that M. Henry's cinnamon roll granola french toast thing had been voted in the top 5 brunch dishes by Food Network, I was like, SIGN ME UP. We literally went there the next day. It was a weekday morning but during that time between Christmas and New Years so a lot of people were clearly not working as it was very busy. We were seated immediately in the back area near the windows which were a bit drafty on a cold December day, and the acoustics are not great. If you're looking for something quiet this is probably not the place for you. I excitedly ordered my french toast and the BF ordered an omelette. Our server was prompt, polite, and very attentive despite the busy day, which was much appreciated. We didn't wait long for our food and my cup of coffee was always full, so the meal got off to a good start. I personally thought the french toast was just ok. I hate to be that person, and maybe it was because it was built up so much in my mind, but I found the fruit compote to be a bit much and made the dish soggy by the end. The creme was good and nice to offset the texture and sweetness of the dish, but there wasn't really enough of it on my plate to go around. The granola wasn't as much of a crust as it was just sprinkled around, and most of it was soggy from the fruit mixture. I was a bit let down by this as it was rated so highly. The BF's experience was completely different than mine. He cut into his omelette, and it was still runny. Not like sort of cheesy on the inside, but like uncooked egg was coming out all over the plate. The house potatoes were delicious but I told him he needed to send it back if he wouldn't eat it. We politely asked the server to tell the kitchen and he was, of course, so kind about it. He didn't question us at all and took the plate back immediately. A couple of minutes later, he brought what we thought was a new meal, as it should have been especially since undercooked eggs were the issue. Upon further inspection, the omelette that returned was the exact same, just with new garnish placed on top. We could tell by the cut that was made in the omelette where he initially found the undercooked eggs. This was off-putting at best, and at worst, the fact was that the eggs were still runny inside. To make matters worse, it seemed to us that the omelette had not only NOT been remade, it had just been sat under the warmer or a salamander to try and cook longer rather than put back on the grill. We knew this was the case because the house potatoes that were delicious and crispy before were now hard and burned. The entire plate had clearly been sat under a heat source which just ruined the dish.  We decided to give up and I finished my meal and explained our dislike to the server and asked to have the omelette removed from the check. He immediately obliged once again without question and apologized profusely. He even brought us some of the peanut butter gluten free cookies as a peace offering (totally unnecessary but they were SUPER delicious!). We knew it wasn't his fault but the kitchen's laziness that led to this. We paid the check, left him a huge tip, and made our way out.  I hope that this was an isolated incident, but unfortunately I don't think we will be back anytime soon since there are many other choices for brunch in the 'hood.",0.9959,0.803,0.139,0.059,0.47964497920380267

The wait was reasonable for a Saturday afternoon around 1pm, about 20 minutes - my only complaint was the 10-15 minute wait after being seated before we were able to place our order, as we were already ravenous and everything being consumed around us looked SO GOOD.

2015-07-05,5.0,"What a delightful little brunch joint! I just moved blocks away and am a total foodie - especially when it comes to breakfast food. Two of my friends and I decided to check this place out after seeing great yelp reviews.  I arrived before my friends, and they are not allowed to seat people before the whole party is there. Working in the restaurant industry, I understand that, so I bought a bottomless coffee for myself while I waited ($3.01 with tax. Pricey but I drank enough coffee to even out the cost). The host was very friendly, as was the girl who was working the beverage counter. I am a talker, so it was nice that they chatted with me while I waited.  When my friends arrived, we were immediately sat outside at a table in the shade. Inside was pretty busy- it's a small restaurant. Unfortunately, our server was not very attentive. He came to our table and just kind of asked what we wanted - no greeting or anything. Maybe I'm just a tough critic since I'm a server....however, he honestly rarely came by our table.  The good thing is that the food was AMAZING. I ordered the Latina Omeletta and subbed egg whites in place of eggs. It comes with plantains and potatoes- I subbed a fruit bowl in place of the potatoes, and I was not charged extra for any of my substitutions, which was REALLY awesome. The fruit bowl wasn't your typical, boring fruit bowl. It had mango, peaches, kiwi, plum, etc. My omelet was literally amazing. The ingredients were so fresh. It was cooked to perfection. My friends got the hotcakes with berries and cream, and obviously I tried some. They were so fluffy. No words. One of my friends got the fried egg sandwich fruit potatoes and only had good things to say about both, as well.  Regardless of how the service at our table was, I will most definitely be back. I'm sure it was just an off day for our server. He seemed like a really nice guy. We came at around 10:30am on a Sunday. By the time we were leaving at 11:30am, there was a line waiting in the lobby.

If you come early, I believe the pay to park meters don't start running until 9am on Saturdays. Yay for free parking! We walked in and there was a small line...I don't understand why there wasn't a hostess standing there. It was probably a 10 minute wait before someone showed up. I mean, the front dining area was completely empty and the main area in the back wasn't even full. We were seated near the back with the booths. The booth seat is highly uncomfortable for short people like me...legs danging and falling asleep. I really hoped the breakfast made up for it. I know they have specials here listed on the black board, but it really would've been nice if the waitress announced specials of the day rather than what would you like? I really really wanted pancakes so I went with the blackberry bliss hotcakes. My boyfriend got a cinnamon roll french toast. Within 5 miinutes of ordering, the server brings another table's order out by mistake. I was like, that's lighting fast service, only to wait another 10 mins or so before our food came. So the hotcakes were super fluffy layered w/warm blackberries & vanilla mascarpone cream, & topped w/a brown sugar & oat crust. You can totally eat this sans syrup with the delicious berry sauce that gives it the perfect hint of sweetness. Of course I got a side of candied applewood bacon as a savory item to go with it. It's a delicious sticky mess, but I wish it was a tad bit more crunchy. Nonetheless, still good. The house baked cinnamon roll dressed with warm fruit, vanilla neufchatel creme was also topped with a granola crust. It wasn't overly sweet and the mixture of textures was lovely. A very good breakfast option in the Andersonville/Edgewater area. A bit pricey (~$35 w/tips for 2), but the generous toppings of fresh fruits and homemade bakery items justifies quality.

2015-05-13,5.0,"In the area for an appointment and decided to refer to Yelp to look for a brunch place. M Henry was on the top of the list. You walk in first to their cafe, and make a mental note ""check out their baked goods"", before being quickly escorted to the back. Servers are extremely attentive and welcoming. Ordered a bottomless cup of coffee (they have their own blend from Metropolis - excellent!) that rarely was kept empty. Felt really comfortable and space is well decorated. I think the owner is a designer too. You can tell by how well the restaurant is put together.  I ordered the Salmon Benedict which was on their daily specials menu. Prior to eating here I liked Tre Kronor's benedict the best, but now I have a new favorite (sorry, it's not you... It's me.). I get nervous with Benedicts sometimes because I do not like it when the hollandaise is too rich. This one was just perfect. And the egg beautifully poached as the yolk ran down the beautifully created meal. I do like my potatoes a little softer on the inside and crispy on the outside, but that wasn't really a big deal. The two pineapple wedges were perfect too.  The owner, Michael Henry, also rang me up for some of those baked goods I eyed on my way in. Seems like a really nice and friendly guy. Asked me how my meal was before I found out who he was. This place has been open for 12 years yet I have only just ""discovered"" it today? Well, I'm gonna have to make up for lost time.

Today (first time visit) I had the lemon french toast, it was by far the worst french toast I've ever had in my life. I'm a custom to French toast soaked in eggs for lack of the ""gourmet"" terms. It was simply bread with some lemon flavor ""sauce"" on it. The presentation was 5 stars all the way, it looks great but tastes like eating cardboard!! It was so bland and no flavor just bread and  syrup there was no way I can even eat half of because my throat was filled dry with bread syrup didn't do anything to help the dryness . To be completely fair I should not have expected juicy fluffy flavorful french toast. Gourmet aka flavorless food takes all the fun out of a simple dish.

2014-11-16,1.0,"My first impression walking in was WOW! So cute! The pastries as soon as you come in, great decor. This place was recommended by a coworker and I was excited to try it out with my family visiting from out of town. They left it to me to pick the restaurant because I have such great taste, but now I'm pretty embarrassed. But I'm sure the food is good--we just didn't get to taste it! I gave our name and told the hostess it was a party of 6. She told me 20-30 minutes. I thought that was amazing, especially for a Sunday. I've heard of people waiting over an hour for this place on Sunday, and to hear it would only be 20 minutes, I thought it was our lucky day. Boy, was I wrong. I gave our name at 10:50, so I thought for sure we'd be seated by 11:15. WRONG!! Table after table after table after table sat down, then I heard the table in front of us called. Great, I thought, we're next. It had been closer to half an hour by that point, but I understand things happen. One of our party members went to check on the wait and they said soon, we'd be soon. Then after about 15 minutes someone else went up to check, told we'd be next. NEXT, ok--NEXT! Great, we're next! Then they called a table for 2. Well, ok, maybe they were already in the works when they told us next. Then about five more two-tops. Ok...then they called a four-top. Woah. Ok, hold the phone. We'd seen the waiting room empty and refill about three times since we'd gotten there and we were all pretty annoyed. The hostess said the large party at ""our"" table had already paid, but they weren't leaving and there was nothing they could do. If a party is holding up a table at a busy restaurant like that, it's the restaurant's responsibility to kind of suggest the party clear up the table. So the other large party that had already paid and was holding ""our"" table hostage wouldn't leave--so we, the party that was eager to give them at least $100 check, did.  I've looked at some reviews on here and every single negative review cited poor service. Everyone seems to love the food, but after a criminally negligent hostess basically refused to seat us--how should I know? What a waste of time. Too bad they can't comp us that hour we waited. Just for the record, it was 11:45 when we left--so it was only 55 minutes. Thanks, guys!",0.9962,0.726,0.199,0.075,0.5540922619047619

2014-10-18,2.0,"Went in on a Saturday at 12:30pm for brunch (which is served all day) and were greeted promptly and seated shortly after.  We were served ice water by one of the bus staff immediately. The server (whose name I do not know because it was never given) came over about 3 minutes later and asked if we would like something additional to drink--we ordered coffee and OJ. They were delivered about 5 minutes later at which point we placed our order.  I understand that food made from scratch takes time to prepare (and prepare correctly) and am perfectly happy to wait, but I am not happy to wait without being checked on or coffee being refilled.  After our food arrived (eggs Benedict with home style potatoes and baguette french toast to be shared) sans syrup, butter, or ketchup--and still no coffee refill--we continued to wait patiently-ish for our waiter to return. After about 10 minutes (because at this point I'm tracking the time) we'd eaten through the Benedicts and managed to ask the server to bring syrup and ketchup. Another 10 minutes later a different person on staff asked if he could take my empty plate on which I had put the creamer trash (still there from just after the coffee arrived) and I asked him for the condiments previously requested and some coffee. AMAZINGLY he came back with all of them within 2 minutes (two trips).  The food was...good. Not amazing. Not ambrosia. Not even close to good enough to make up for the service. Especially since the french toast still had a significant amount of raw egg mixture on the bottom of it. (It's the only reason they're getting two stars vs. one.) Now to the end of the meal... It's been at least 15 minutes since we've even seen the face of our server. We are not impressed and want to leave...and are now seeking out someone to request our check so we can leave. The hostess was clearly concerned as were other staff that we hadn't seen our waiter and helped to expedite our departure. After paying, the same staff member that was actually helpful early came by again to collect our plates and I tipped him instead because he deserved it.

We tried the fried egg sandwich and the berry bliss cakes :) The fried egg sandwich is so simple, that I feel I could make it, and I probably could, but I don't keep bacon around, or blue cheese. The tomato in the sandwich was perfect, not soggy at all. And the side of home fries were fantastic. (The few slivers of mango were also a nice touch). I was up on the fence between trying a bliss cake or the french toast. The waitress recommended the berry bliss cake, and it was delicious! The dish is made of 2 stacked pancakes, and is actually really filling. The vanilla mascarpone sandwiched between the pancakes really made the dish. The black berry jam was also tasty,",0.991,0.752,0.248,0.0,0.5138095238095238
2014-07-03,2.0,"This makes me sad, but I have to be honest.  First of all, there has been a noticeable downgrade in service over the past year or so, as some of the best servers have moved on or rarely work.  The menu is mostly unchanged - it often feels too small, but at least you know what to expect, with the same exact specials on rotation.  But in addition to sometimes spotty service, there has also been a noticeable inconsistency in the food.  Certain dishes will taste completely different depending on the day.  Often, over-easy eggs come out nearly hard.  An omelet will be fluffy one day, and overcooked the next.  However, up until this past month, I was still eating here weekly.  But both of the last two times I ate here, my order was completely screwed up.  Keep in mind I order nearly the exact same thing every time I eat here, and usually have the same server.  So two visits ago, I was served the wrong food, which included meat.  I have been a vegetarian for 22 years, so it was a bit upsetting, but I could spot right away that the meat was not vegetarian (they do have veggie sausage, tempeh, and yuba here).  I returned the food and eventually got the right food (it was a long wait), but then they attempted to charge me for the meat anyway.  They were kind of busy that day so, as unpleasant as it was, I dismissed it.  But then I went back today.  It was basically dead.  I had the same server I always do.  I ordered one of the same dishes I always do - breakfast burrito with veggie sausage instead of regular sausage.  And unfortunately, this time I did not catch the real meat in time.  So I ate meat for the first time in 22 years, and it was extremely upsetting.  Oddly, the meat had no flavor at all, which is how I realized it wasn't right because the veggie sausage is very flavorful.  I sent everything back and walked out, and I won't be back.  It's really sad because I have been a regular here for 5 years, but I can't trust the service or kitchen at this point (not sure whose fault it is, but if it happens twice in a row, something is wrong).  They are probably making fun of me right now for thinking this is a big deal, but for someone like me, it is a HUGE deal.  I just broke my vegetarianism which is like a religion to me, and I feel absolutely horrible.  I have to break up with you, M.

Parking is free on the street, but rather difficult considering they're located adjacent to residential neighborhoods. Once you secure your parking, secure your seating with the hostess when you first enter the restaurant. Don't be scared of the long line - the turnover is really fast and your table will be ready much faster than you think.  They offer traditional breakfast items - both savory and sweet. I went for sweet with the French toast - cinnamon roll topped with granola, cream cheese, berries, mangoes. Everything was balanced well - the tartness of the berries cuts through the sweetness of the cinnamon roll. This was a good brunch item and I would definitely order it again.

The weekend menu has a few additional options, but the regular one has enough variety. This time I had a grilled poblano pepper stuffed with egg and chorizo. This came with: fluffy rice mixed with peas and beans; thin grilled corn cakes; a small amount of soft plantains; and a couple of bites of mango. All the flavors were good, and I appreciate the thought that went into providing a variety of tastes and also not the usual side dishes (tomatoey rice, bean paste with lard, burned red potatoes, a strawberry, some underripe honeydew, etc.).  The waitress was friendly and efficient. Not only she, but all of the wait staff and all of the bus boys, as they happened to pass by, were very good about asking if I needed a coffee warmup, more water, etc., as if it were their job -- which, of course, it is, but in most restaurants the staff seems not to be aware of it.  Prices are fine, actually something of a bargain considering the quality and variety of ingredients. It was busy and crowded, but not noisy or hot.

Blackberry bliss cakes are an absolute must get if you like something sweet for breakfast. The #1 complaint I have with bliss cakes is that most restaurants skimp on the mascarpone or cream (I'm looking at you Wildberry). M.Henry is super generous with berries and mascarpone. The pancakes themselves aren't to be overlooked either, soft, fluffy and a perfect medium to deliver for mascarpone into your mouth.  Jorge's black bean cakes & huevos borrachos are very tasty as well and comparable to something you'd find in Texas in terms of flavors. Chorizo was spicy and enjoyable, the blackbean cakes were surprisingly tasty and soaked up all that rich chorizo runoff.  Service was attentive and speedy, $$ means you won't break the bank for a great meal. Their pastries look fantastic and will be on my list to try.

For our table of 3 ladies we ordered hot tea, breakfast bread pudding, veggie quiche, and black bean cakes with ""drunken eggs.""  Bread pudding was the perfect amount of sweet and over all tasted very fresh and homey. Quiche (star of our meal) was rich and flavorful; salad on the side had the perfect dressing. Drunken eggs had a lot going on but came together nicely, especially with homemade tortillas. Mmm.  Overall everyone was more than satisfied with their meal and would come back.

We went with a group of four after the main lunch rush and it was not super-crowded.  The hostess had to complete her texting before she looked up to greet us and seat us.  We got water quickly enough but the waiter took almost ten minutes to come by.  No apologies - nothing.  Screwed up the beverage order; again, no apology.  When he finally took our order, it took inordinately long to come and he never came by to explain that.  When the order came up, he banged the plates down with not so much as a word, then walked away.  Never asked if we needed more hot water for tea, or if the food was okay.  Then he disappeared. We looked around for a manager-type and saw someone at a corner table looking like he was doing reports or something for the place; apparently too engaged in that to look up and see the sloppy and poor service.  We hailed a bus boy who found the waiter who - now that it was tip time - gave a faux apology and smiled insincerely.  Too late, buddy.  And it will be for the place if that kind of service persists.",0.7374,0.817,0.107,0.076,0.49232804232804234

2013-09-08,5.0,I just have had brunch here today earlier. This is one of the two places I go to brunch in Chicago. Everything on their menu is awesome. But of course I  go the shrimp and crab benedict. Their food after you eat you never feel gross. The ingredients are always fresh. The only thing I wasn't so happy about today was that our server forgot to give us utensils so I sat there staring at my yummy food for awhile but I won't deduct a star for that since her co worker made up for it. Love the food and always a returning customer.,0.8908,0.846,0.131,0.022,0.6571428571428571

The presentation was lovely, and the cakes were fluffy and light. With the berries and the glaze, it was definitely a sweet breakfast item, but not overly sweet.  Also, I loved the number of dishes that could be served with scrambled tofu instead of eggs. This is becoming more common at brunch places, but I've never seen the option presented on as many dishes as they had here! Metropolis coffee was a plus, and the wait time for six at 11:30 on Sunday was surprisingly short. Definitely one of my top brunch places!",0.9808,0.777,0.223,0.0,0.5607142857142856

2013-09-01,2.0,"I want to love this place.  I really do.  I mean, the food is great and there are a lot of great vegetarian options.  However, a big deal breaker for me is when a restaurant advertises a lower price for food on their website, but then when you go to pick up an order for carry out, you find out that their ""real"" prices are much higher.  An even bigger deal breaker is when the staff is totally indifferent when you bring it up. Such was the case with M. Henry.  When I brought it to the attention of the person ringing me up, he admitted that their website hasn't been updated in ages.  He didn't try to honor the online price or compensate for it somehow.  Instead, he just gave me a copy of their current menu. However, they still overcharged me if you go off the new menu.  I ordered sides to go with my breakfast entrees and the current menu states, ""add the following to any of the above menu items: applewood smoked bacon 2.50, apple maple chicken sausage, veggie sausage, tempeh strips or yuba 2.75,"" but they charged me the full price instead. I mean, come on - update your website.  If you're going to up the prices on your customers, let them know.  If you don't let them know, then do the right thing and honor what you advertise.  If you're going to advertise a pricing special, make sure your employees know so they don't ring you up for a higher amount.  It's not so much about the extra dollars as it is about the principle, and this bait and switch doesn't sit well with me.",0.1041,0.887,0.059,0.054,0.4948157166907167

But this past weekend my fella and I were in town for a wedding in Evanston and I suggested we check it out since we were fairly near to the area. We arrived around 11am on a Saturday and walked right in and got a table. I was shocked. No wait and tons of tables were open. What has happened in the last 3 years since I've lived in you Chicago? It was nuts. But I was grateful since I was starving! Everything sounded fantastic but we decided to try the berry blisscakes and the quiche and split both (sweet and salty, y'all!). I had heard so much about the bread pudding that I recommended we try a half order of that too. So we did! The bread pudding and the bliss cakes both were heavenly. The nice thing about them (or not super nice if you're a sugar-a-holic) is that they weren't terribly sweet. Sure, they had sweetness about them but they weren't give-you-a-toothache kind of sweet. The bread pudding was sweetened by a bit of the custard in the bread and the peaches while the blackberries brought a good amount of tart into the mix. It wasn't also that eggy or custardy which made the dish surprisingly light and airy. I really liked their approach. The pancakes were also light and there was a sweetness to the berry juice/syrup but the blackberries themselves and the mascarpone cheese brought some tartness as well. The granola on top gave it a nice crunch and good varied texture. The quiche was also fantastic. With leeks, bacon, gruyere, and other goodies inside. It was rich and buttery without being heavy. The salad on the side was filled with fresh greens, veggies and fruit and was tossed with a sweeter dressing that had a bit of an Asian influence. It was all very enjoyable! The space is cute, a bit rustic, and bright. Our waitress was really nice and overall for brunch in Chicago that was as tasty, fresh, and sizable as it was (the portions are HUGE) it was a steal pricewise.

We'd wave to grab our server's attention across the room, and he'd walk away not ""seeing"" us. So we'd ask another server for water, who said she'd get our server.

2013-08-02,2.0,"I stopped coming here on Saturdays or Sundays a long time ago because I just don't feel like waiting a long time to receive rushed service. In any case, the two of us made plans to meet a friend for brunch on a Friday so we could catch up with her as well as meet her newborn.  Service has never been m. henry's strong point, mainly because they're usually just so packed and there are so many people waiting for tables that none of the normal marks of good service can be put to use. The Friday we went was not so busy, but somehow service was even worse than it usually is.  First, the hostess just mumbled at us, and then seated us in a section by ourselves outside of the main room, in the back of the cafe part of the restaurant. I have a feeling they did this because of the newborn, out of fear that he would cry or otherwise annoy patrons who are easily offended by the presence of young children around them. Even worse, the spot they put us in was near the dishwashers, and was incredibly loud. Making it an almost comically terrible decision was the fact that this area is also smoky, to the point that even my eyes were red and irritated by the end of the meal. And yet the baby slept through nearly all of the meal... The service itself left a lot to be desired. The server didn't come around for a good long while even to get drink orders, and when he did he seemed to want us to order everything at once. Outside of that he was either obsequious or absent.   As for the food itself, it was much less impressive than it was in the past. I ordered the dandelion green, shallot, leek omelette. In all honesty, I would have rather had an spinach and feta omelette from any random Greek diner. It would have been just as or more flavorful and would have cost around $2 less for a way bigger portion.  Our friend ordered the fried egg sandwich and found the eggs a bit undercooked for her taste, to the point that even the whites were runny. The mangoes on the side were not ripe/not flavorful, and the orange garnish seemed like an afterthought, with little attention given to presentation all around.  Jorge's black bean cakes and egg thing is an abomination. Seriously, I don't know who likes those flavors all together like that, but it wasn't us.

2013-05-28,1.0,"So I have now been to M. Henry three times throughout the past year, and after today, I just can't applaud the place.  Last summer my boyfriend and I decided to give it a try while we were walking around Andersonville.  We sat on the patio and it was so cute and nice.  The food and service was fantastic.  My boyfriend had the drunken eggs and I had the chicken pesto tomato sandwich entree.  The food is so darn yummy and flavorful and has yet to disappoint me. The service the first time was fantastic.  So why not stop in again, right? Well, my boyfriend and I stopped in at M. Henry around November and let's just say... I did not leave happy.  The food didn't disappoint, it was the service.  Our server was EXTREMELY inattentive to us and quite frankly, forgot about us.  He forgot to bring us our drinks, I had a coffee and my boyfriend had a hot chocolate, and we got those over 10 minutes after the food was served. Our waters were only filled once and my coffee was never refilled, even though I asked twice to have more coffee. We waited over 25 minutes for our check to be brought to us, and our plates were already taken off the table during that time.  The restaurant was not busy and so there was really no excuse to be ignored.  It also didn't help that there was quite the language barrier between us and the waiter.  Now like I said, the food was fantastic (this time we got the french toast and drunken eggs and egg sandwich), but the service was TERRIBLE. So today, my boyfriend and I were craving M. Henry because I really wanted some of their house potatoes that are to DIE FOR, and stopped in around 1pm.  The place was fairly empty, yet it took several minutes for my presence to be acknowledged and for me to be seated (the host was speaking to a man in Spanish about working and how he was doing). That turned me off and I didn't understand why I was literally standing there waiting for the host to put his personal conversation on pause so that he could seat me, the paying customer.  A waiter sees me standing there waiting and politely takes me to a table by the window. I sit down and my boyfriend comes in two minutes later after parking the car.  We know what we want so we order our food and drinks.  My boyfriend gets a hot chocolate because the presentation wowed us the time before and it tasted so good.  The food came out within 15 minutes and the waiter asked us if he could get us anything else, and I remind him we never got the hot chocolate.  He said ""oh, you should have gotten that"" and walks away.  He comes back two minutes later and puts down the hot chocolate.  The presentation this time was not good and you could tell he was in a rush making it and that he forgot to make it earlier.  No biggie about forgetting things, I'm a waitress myself, but c'mon, presentation is everything.  M. Henry really presents it food fantastically and this waiter really shouldn't have rushed because that hot chocolate did not have the wow factor it had the first time.  I mean the first time my boyfriend had the hot chocolate a few months back, it was art. The hot chocolate looked amazing and I took several pictures of it.  Today, it looked like a super rushed person made the hot chocolate in under 10 seconds.  Again we waited over 15 minutes for the check and I was rather annoyed leaving because of the service. Just as a side note, the waiter I had a few months back and the one I had today, was the same waiter.  I'm really upset with the service and it's the only reason I really don't see myself coming back. The cooks do an amazing job, but the service in the front of the house is severely lacking. If I return, it is because of the food and definitely not the service. *I cannot say that service from all of the waiters is lacking, but from the server that I have now had twice and from the host today.",0.9076,0.856,0.079,0.065,0.5067102524069739

Service can be somewhat erratic, but they are always busy, so no wonder. Even so, M. Henry s the Real Deal. Footnote: Do not make the mistake of thinking skipping the line by going to nearby sister restaurant M. Henrietta is going to be a good idea.

2013-05-19,3.0,"This place was just okay.  The decor is sweet and it smells heavenly, and since we didn't go on a weekend, we didn't have the wait issues the weekenders seem to have.  Tuesday at 11am we were seated right away and service was prompt.   The plusses: The menu is huge and the food is okay.  They also have Chai Lattes! Yum.   My friend loved her salad bowl, but my grown up grilled cheese was lacking...(I mean, where was the cheese?) The minuses: The tables are packed in there and some of them are unusually tall, but most annoying was how loud it was.  It was LOUD, like have to raise your voice to talk to the person across from you loud, so I can only imagine it would be worse on the weekends.",0.3617,0.836,0.108,0.056,0.7315476190476191
2013-05-16,2.0,"M. Henry is outrageously overrated. Let me break this down for you. Pros: + The charming patio and ambiance  + The good service + The hip crowd Cons: - The food. It is pretentious, over-thought, and underwhelming. It sounds better on the menu than it tastes. It looks better on the plate than it tastes. These yelp reviews make it out to be way better than it tastes. I have dined here twice for brunch, each time disappointing. But it's in my hood, so I gave it another chance.  I had the Dulce Banana Rumba French Toast.  I swear I was eating two pieces of plain bread in syrup. It looked like french toast, but it tasted like warm slices of plain dry bread. How is this possible? I was sincerely baffled. The syrup it was in was delicious, but it was one of the least appetizing meals I've ever had. I'm not hard to please, either, far from it.  And I can't believe I spent 10 bucks on dressed up slices of bread. Never again, M. Henry, jamais plus!",0.9672,0.803,0.158,0.038,0.5584713595583161

2013-05-04,3.0,"This place is so weird. On one hand the food and table service is pretty good for such a popular place, on the other hand it smells like French herbs from blocks away, and almost every savory dish tastes exactly like the place smells. The real problem comes from the guy who's meant to seat you on weekends when the place is a freakin' mess of standing-around-forever-waiting-and-smelling-of-tarragon-and-onions. The last time I ate there on a weekend was a disaster. My wife and I, with our 4 year-old, decided to brave the wait. I inquired as to the wait time and the guy at the podium looked past me out over the heads of the crowd like Adonis and stated flatly, ""30 minutes."" I asked him to put down my name and walked back to my hungry family. Later, when it seemed that the line had moved and left me behind, somewhere around the 25 minute mark, I thought maybe I was missed (I mean, it could happen), so, I approached the man again and asked if he might have missed me. He looked at me, as if seeing me for the first time, asked my name and perused the book, ""Nope, you're not on the list"", and went back to standing and staring. I was flummoxed, after standing there for so long, and entertaining a hungry kid not good at lines, I had assumed I would be coming up soon at the very least, but nope, nothing, nada. So, I went back to my family to explain, and suggest that we leave since I figured there was no way we were sitting in the next 30-odd minutes. They wanted to stay, so I returned to the stoic man. I asked if he could write me down, since there had been a mix up. To be honest, I wasn't yet mad at all, just perplexed, so I was surprised when he raised his voice and said, ""Sir, this is a Sunday morning, we are very busy, you don't have to get mad."" I professed my innocence to him, then walked away sheepishly with all the local haughty-types staring at me thinking I was trying to make a scene and line-jump. On my way back though it hit me...I was not wrong. I had waited, I had done what I was supposed to. I was actually good. So, I marched back up and asked for the manager, because in my mind, we really should be seated by now as about 40 minutes had elapsed. Oh, the huffing and puffing of the man as he left his position.  (now this part you don't have to read, it is an aside about what happened next but it's not really part of the review, as it is only partially about the restaurant, though it is about the clientele. As I was about to go back to stand with my loving hungry family, a young woman came to take the place of the podium man while he was away searching for the manager for me. She came up to the stand and I mentioned to her that I wasn't really trying to cause a fuss, I was just, you know, doing what I thought was right. She nodded, but the big gentleman (maybe 6'  6"", 275 lbs. and oh, god, dude, I hope you read this, you..you...jackass) next to the podium audibly tisked me, then turned to the young woman and said loudly, ""Whatever you do, do not seat me next to THAT guy!"" I honestly, don't know what he was thinking, or why he involved himself.  I assume he was trying to call me out without actually doing it, so I went up to him in front of the whole gloomy wide-eyed crowd, and asked him why he was getting in other people's business. We argued like fools, for a moment, but I was now getting mad to the point of just about having a fit...I mean, how dare people, really...so, I got in a few more words and walked away sulking)  Meanwhile, the manager left his roost, where he was breakfasting, and came up with the Adonis man skulking behind him. I explained what happened, what I thought had happened, and hoped he could accommodate us. He assured us he could, then asked the young woman to write down our names...on the same list of waiting people that we'd been omitted from for nearly an hour now, while the 6' 6"" man smirked. Finally after about 10 more minutes they seated us. No apologies, no fanfare, just seated us. The meal was average that day, and they forgot a major ingredient to my wife's breakfast sandwich, but, you know, that happens, however disappointing. What does not happen, in my opinion, is the guy writing down names forgets to write yours down then seats the entire waiting group of people, then some OTHER people that come along, then complains and demeans you, and STILL DOES NOT WRITE DOWN YOUR NAME.  The worse part though? We were seated right next to the 6' 6"" guy and his party. He refused to look our way which was probably for the best. By the way, my 4-year-old was excellently behaved through the whole event, and my wife doesn't remind me of the time I got in some oaf's face for calling me out in public. Good times. Too bad though, the food is pretty damn good.",0.9925,0.838,0.102,0.059,0.4334955520669806
2013-04-24,5.0,"This place is serving modern farmhouse realness! Okay, seriously, you step into this place and you feel like you teleported to a farmhouse that knows it's 2013 and not 1913. The only downside is that there is a bit of a wait for brunch on the weekend, but honestly most brunch places are in the same boat. If there's a wait, it must mean they are doing something right and M.Henry is definitely doing something right! I love brunch like a fat kid loves cookies but deciding on breakfast or lunch is always a bit of a challenge for me. Since I felt accomplished having run the Lakefront Ten Miler that morning, I decided to not be indecisive and had both! I also decided to throw my paleo eating habits out the window for the day *cough* weekend as well. You won't be let down if you order the All Grown-Up Grilled Cheese (not to be confused with the Neo Classic Grilled Cheese). It had me at caramelized shallots. Need I say more? Well I will anyway because that combo of cheese, pesto, leeks and shallots was so delicious I killed that sandwich and if I didn't have will power, I would have ordered another! Definitely opt for the Asian Slaw. It's simple but very addicting, and provides a nice fresh and light balance to the heavy grilled cheese. Okay so I said I had both breakfast and lunch. Well not to let you down but I only ordered a side of breakfast potatoes. But if you do what I did and order a sandwich, you need these breakfast potatoes! Nice and flavorful potatoes with peppers and onions is a great way to round out your meal. My friend got the Veritable Vegan Epiphany which looked delicious but I cannot testify to it's goodness. However, let's just say that is what she ordered last time. Must be good eh? Because I love food and have a slight bout of ADD, I was constantly eyeing other people's plates. From what I saw, you cannot go wrong with anything at this place. I wanted to order what I believe was a chocolate brownie that for some reason I also believe is gluten free, but I will have to wait until next time!",0.9985,0.723,0.248,0.029,0.505670911775563

The benedict was amazing and I loved the flavor combination from the lemon Hollandaise sauce and seafood cakes. Boyfriend had the salmon benedict which he loved.

2013-04-10,1.0,"No. No. No. I dream of brunch all week long and the husband and I make an effort to try a new place twice a month. I had heard about m. henry 2 years ago from friends and its been on  our ""must brunch list"". We happened to be in the neighborhood and decided to give it a try. It was 10 minutes from when we sat down before the waiter came to take a drink order, give us menus. Our waiter only had 6 tables seated in his section. We didn't even get our coffee's or silverware until we asked about them once we were served our breakfast (35 minutes). Our waiter gave up before he even started, because when I asked for silverware he rolled his eyes at me and said in a very curt tone, ""Uhm, ok, need anything else to enjoy your meal?"" We only received one coffee ""freshen up"". Meanwhile the two tables around us who each had 3-4 people were seated after us both got their drinks and meals before us.  We shared the blackberry bliss cakes, the quiche and a side of bacon (which they forgot and we waited for). The bacon was obviously microwaved, flavorless and they didn't even wipe the grease off. The quiche was served with a side salad and the vinaigrette and pickled cabbage was completely bitter and overwhelming. The crust for the quiche was soggy and completely soaked through with butter/oil. Obviously we ordered a heavier brunch, but it didn't call for the large amount of oil/grease it came with. The blisscakes were the best part of the meal, but were just mediocre. There are so many good places in this city to get pancakes - Meli's, Lou Mitchell's, Yolk, Bakin' and Eggs, I could go on...and this would be my current bottom choice.  Our waiter took the bacon off our bill because after one bite each we couldn't even eat it. How do you mess up bacon so badly?  On the way out, we decided to try the bakery....maybe better luck? We got one cherry granola and one blueberry muffin which we had for breakfast the following day.

2013-04-10,4.0,"A principle of mine is that I don't take away stars for a long wait. It simply wouldn't be fair because you're CHOOSING to wait. However, this was quite the wait. Sunday at 11? You need to be committed or it's going to be a long morning. I couldn't wait to try m.henry and made the journey with Amy F. and Halley W. one Sunday. You can't tell from the front of the restaurant, but there's tons of seating. So things are moving, there are just that many people waiting. We were quoted 45 minutes and it was closer to an hour and a half. Coming to m.henry with two people is the way to go, there are many more tables available for parties of that size. The atmosphere is warm and welcoming, I felt like I could hang out there all day. Once seated, things moved pretty quickly. Our waiter was incredibly friendly, but I got the feeling they're really looking to turn tables here. Halley W. and Amy F. each ordered specials from that day and they were happy with both. Halley's was a stuffed pepper-themed dish and Amy's was a winter sampler which had plenty of creative elements (including an amazing chicken sausage that I snagged a bite of). As a fried egg sandwich aficionado, I had to go with Frannie's Killer Fried Egg Sandwich. It was very good breakfast sandwich, but I wouldn't go with ""killer."" The sour boule was very hard (borderline difficult to bite) and the gorgonzola was a bit overpowering. The potatoes that came with it were awesome.

Another server takes over and takes the specials menu nicely from me stating ""um the other guy gave you the wrong specials menu, the new ones are being printed right now"". ugh come on people. Finally, he states do you guys want something to drink like coffee or something else. DUH!!!!!  We ordered and it took from 8:20 to 9a.m. to finally get our food. I was timing it only because a). it was slow in there & b) it was eggs, house potatoes and pancakes.  Finally the food arrives, he apologizes for the delay. We were cool.

It is a surprisingly pretty big establishment so the noise level is not exactly quiet; however, I have never had an issue hearing people across the table from me.  This is one of the most popular breakfast places in the city so yes, there is quite a wait. There is a small waiting area with a coffee bar - perfect to grab a drink or muffin while you wait - but I would suggest walking around Andersonville and coming back to check in on your party's status. I have seen some people complain about how the wait is never what they are told it will be. Because of the great atmosphere inside the restaurant, people don't just get up and leave as soon as their food is done. While the host/hostess will do the best they can to judge when tables will open up, it isn't always easy to get an accurate reading when parties are chatting after the bill is paid.

I'm usually pretty critical about breakfast potatoes because the ones they serve at m.henry are just so good! Nice and crisp outside, soft inside, hints of herbs and cherry tomatoes as well. YUM! The only thing missing for me are a few eggs benedict options :P The servers are always very friendly and attentive without being annoying.  I'm not usually a sweet breakfast kind of person but I'm a  fan of the pancakes here. I used to live really close to m.henry, live about 20-25 minutes away now but the boyfriend and I still make the drive up every once in awhile :) Also- haven't had the black bean chili but one of my friends highly recommends it-",0.976,0.733,0.219,0.048,0.6260439560439561
2013-03-03,1.0,"Above average food for a fair price but HORRIBLE experience. The good: Food was tasty.  We ordered the goat cheese rotolone, salmon benedict, chocolate brioche french toast and the drunken stuffed poblano pepper from the brunch menu; we recommend all, both the savory and sweet.  Each dish was prepared accordingly and presented nicely.  Our waiter was very pleasant and far exceeded expectation.  I wish I could remember his name so I could give him a 'shout out'. The bad: The wait. Totally fine with this as the place was pretty busy.  I never have a problem with this UNLESS the establishment is not upfront and communicative.  Both of which M. Henry DID NOT accomplish.  We were told 30 minutes.  We waited for an hour and ten minutes.  ***Note: I've seen this in several reviews.  I guess M. Henry does not care. Now for the ugly: The floor manager.  Either he was having a very bad day or he is in the WRONG industry.  Very rude, defensive and combative with absolutely no sense of customer service.  Upon inquiring if our group could be seated together (since we did wait over an hour and the table next to us was leaving), he refused very vocally stating repeatedly, 'you agreed to this'.  I agreed to nothing and he assumed so without even asking.  In the time he spent displaying poor customer service, we could have switched tables twice.  He is a poor representative of your establishment.  It is a shame that his behavior ruined our entire party's experience and opinion of M. Henry. In summary: Until they clean up their act, go eat brunch somewhere else.  There are hundreds of establishments with better food and comparable pricing, that have MUCH BETTER customer service and will appreciate your patronage.",0.4789,0.678,0.172,0.15,0.5829444444444445

When it comes to brunch, I sometimes have a difficult time choosing between sweet and savory. Luckily, I don't have to choose here. You can have a half-order of any of the sweet selections for $6.25 and not break your bank or your waistline. So that made my choices slightly easier. I decided on the bacon wrapped baked eggs with polenta & mixed field greens with a half order of sweet potato pancakes. Both were delicious and not too heavy, a perfect compliment to each other. I'm definitely going back before the seaonal menu changes. WARNING: If you're not going by yourself, I suggest you go early for brunch.

2013-01-29,2.0,"After hearing nothing but fabulous reviews about this famous Andersonville brunch spot, I was rather excited to give it a try when I had an out of town visitor come to Chicago. I was always a little reluctant to try, because as most people, I rarely carry cash on me and from what I recall, this place was cash only... however, that has changed! So after a long wait, I finally get to try M. Henry and much to my chagrin disappointment awaited me. Upon entering the establishment there was a major line with no where to go, so crowding should always be expected Saturday and Sunday mornings. I put our name in with the pseudo-pleasant hostess and we attempt to find a place where we would be out of the way. After a good 30 minutes we hear our name being softly called. Now, on to the meat of the review... the pros and cons: Pros: * Nice menu with a twist from the traditional brunch fair. I ordered the grilled cheese and tomato soup. Though my brunch companion said the soup was too acidic I found it to be the perfect dipping companion to my grilled cheese. * The atmosphere was country and cozy, though a little cramped. I really enjoyed the mixture of table styles and hanging art. Cons: * The service was HORRIBLE. Our waitress not only had the speed of a snail, but the personality of one too. More often than not we had to either flag her down or ask another member of the wait staff to find her. * Expect a long dining experience... in combination to the slow service our food seemed to take forever to get to us from the moment we ordered to the time it arrived on the table.  Over all, I wish I could give M. Henry more stars - but until I decide to try it again, 2 is the best I can award them.

Maybe it's because I'm a huge breakfast fan, but this place didn't live up to the hype or the expectations. The bread pudding was probably the best dish out of the 3 we ordered. It was pretty good, but again, my expectations were really high, so based on all the hype, it wasn't THAAAAT good. I also got the banana french toast. As much as I love sweets, it really was waaaaay too sweet for my tastebuds and the syrup literally felt and tasted so sticky, I felt like the french toast was just drenched in melted caramel. The sweetness of the dish could've definitely been toned down. My friend ordered some dandelion greens omelette and I don't think she liked it very much either, 'cause from what I remember, she didn't even eat half of it.

No big deal - I didn't expect my friends to arrive for another ten minutes anyway. I decided to wait and gave the hostess my name. My friends arrived, we caught up with each other in the crowded lobby for half an hour and were getting very hungry. I asked about the wait and was told we were ""next on the list."" The hostess proceeded to seat about four other parties over the next 15 minutes. When she wasn't seating everyone in Chicago before us, she was spilling half a pot of coffee on my friend. Didn't even apologize. I think she said, ""Oops."" My friend, easy-going as she is, said' "" It's okay. Just get us a table."" Five minutes later, nothing. I asked how much longer and was told ten more minutes and that we were ""next on the list.""  Starving and irritated at this point, I decided to step outside and check the wait at nearby restaurants. Two minutes, I was a block away and got a call from my friend that my name was crossed off the list because members of our party had stepped away for a minute. When I called the manager to explain that we had been waiting AN HOUR and that I could be back faster than my friends could order drinks, I was told that ""policy is policy."" When I complained about the wait - how I was told 20 minutes and it took an hour, he said that its hard to estimate waits. Really? Unless this is your first day on the job, you should have a general idea what a brunch rush is like and how long it takes to get people in and out. A ten minute difference in estimation, I can understand. A 300% difference? That's called lying. Not apologizing for spilling a half pot of coffee on a customer? That's called unprofessional.

To be honest, I was a bit skeptical after reading the most recent reviews.  I was worried that the place wouldn't live up to its hype despite the 1000+ reviews and a solid 4 star rating. We arrived around 11:30 on Saturday afternoon and found the waiting area was relatively full of people.  We were quoted with a 5 to 10 minute wait.  My boyfriend and I were super skeptical and to be honest, a bit put off by her estimate.  We don't even get that short of a wait time for places around our place in the suburbs.   We were seated relatively fast and waited probably closer to the higher end of our wait and maybe even slightly over 10 minutes.  We sat in the main dining room toward the windows at a table top for two.  We were seated next to another group.  We were close to them and could hear their conversation, but we were not sitting on top of them, which was good.   The restaurant was somewhat loud, which was a bit off-putting at first, but then we got used to it so it was fine.  Also, I really liked the decor of the restaurant.  I enjoyed the exposed brick walls and the decor was tasteful.  I also enjoyed how a desk was used as a table. The food was amazing!  The french toast came with three thick slices and had some sliced strawberries and powdered on top of the first slice on the stack.  Blackberries and blueberries were also included.  The vanilla creme was the best thing though.  It was smooth, creamy and not too sweet.  I loved cutting off pieces of my toast and dipping it into the creme.  The portion was too big for me so I took the rest home.  I had some the next day and it still tasted good. My boyfriend got the quiche served with a side salad, which he enjoyed.  The quiche had pieces of applewood smoked bacon in it that I enjoyed.  The salad also had a great dressing.  Oh, and I got the applewood smoked bacon on the side, which came with about four pieces of bacon.  The bacon was delicious. The service was OK.  Our server was friendly, but my boyfriend had to ask about twice before he got his cup of coffee refilled.  The hostesses at the front could also be a tad more friendly.

Here is a lovely little breakfast / brunch / lunch nook in a very safe part of Chicago where if you don't wear lands end, you will stick out like I did in my silver, black & gold Osaka tigers jacket. I also dined alone which had the $500 stroller crowd thinkin I must've either been a homosexual stay at home father, otherwise known as a gay at home dad, or a loser derelict with no scruples about eating alone. A strange combination of both is the case, however I digress.  The food: I wanted to try a savory and a sweet, cuz I saw they had both. Bliss Cakes - WhooOAaoOahOAOH!!! If I was a hot trophy wife in this hood who just got to stay home & do pilates & yoga I would get these on the regular tip.  They smother one in powdered sugar and nuts and the underneath one is drenched in a raspberry sauce that is AMAZEBALLS. And just in case your food boner isn't fully twerked, they cram the middle with a CREAMY SAUCE THAT MUST BE SOMETHING THAT IS NOT OF THIS WORLD.  Its like a delish cream. I don't know what is real anymore.  If I stopped there this place would get 5 stars, but Fried Egg Sandwich - Saw this mentioned in a few reviews, wanted to get sweet & savory, again. So I got this one, meh, it was not bad, but not great, it seemed lacking. It was def big enough for my fat ass, but it seemed like something was lacking. The potatoes that came with it were not very good at all.  Fresh made lentil soup - I got this 2 go, and it was unreal, very awesome and very fresh. But I found a pebble in one, wah. Perhaps a sifter? I would still get their soup du jour again, despite this.  Overall, very awesome and worth multiple trips.

They weren't bad, actually it was pretty good with the vanilla mascarpone. The problem was the cakes weren't ""blissy"" enough. Looking from the pictures others have posted of their dishes, everyone else got a generous granola crust. I barely had any. So my bliss cakes were more so like slight nirvana pancakes.:( The one thing that was amazing were the home potatoes. A lot of times they're plain and under-cooked, but these were spiced heavily and well done. The chicken sausage was okay, and the vegan dish was pretty good, even for a carnivore such as myself.  I wish the portions were larger, or at least the specials came with sides. My pancakes came with nothing, and the vegan scramble came with one side. One thing I must give them credit for is their fruit salad. This damn salad had, and we counted, 8 different fruits included. And none of them were the typical throwaways like melon and cantaloupe.

I forgot what it was called but it was pretty non-typical and it did taste alright, but some things I think could have been done better. For example, the black bean cakes were begging for some more sauce. I think out of the desire to make it pretty they put only a small drop of sauce on the middle, I think the bean cakes would have tasted better and more moist had they provided more. My friend had the french toast which looked really beautiful! I really like how they present the food here. He didn't quite like his french toast though. It didn't really get to try it, but he said it was just lacking. He has ordered french toast in plenty of breakfast places and said that this one just didn't live up to how pretty it looked. We ordered a mocha latte there and it was really pretty, but it tasted too watery. It wasn't creamy at all. I don't think they make very good lattes here.

My dad was sort of iffy on what he wanted and the waitress suggested a dish and basically wrote it down & walked away before he had a chance to agree or disagree. We waited probably 25 minutes for the food to come out and when it did, the dish she'd ordered for my dad was a dry piece of brioche with an egg in it and a big bowl of salad. Not exactly what he'd had in mind for breakfast. The crab cake eggs benedict was fine, but the plate was so full of greens I barely had room to cut my food.  Our waitress had the check on our table before we were even done eating. And the whole time, there was a man standing in the room surveying, scouting for tables and yelling ""3! 2! 4!"" and herding people in and out as fast as he could.  It was pretty much the most unpleasant dining experience I've ever had.

I got the blackberry bliss cakes and the candied bacon, which, the latter is perhaps the greatest culinary invention ever concocted (however, this is coming from a syrup-put-bacon-on-er). The blackberry blisscakes had mascarpone and a brown sugar and oat crust which, say no more. My friend got the killer egg sandwich and normally I cannot stomach runny eggs but when gorgonzola and more bacon and thyme and sourdough toast are in the mix, I can stomach anything. This review is painfully long. So anyways, I texted my sister about what I ordered and her response was ""I just came"" which, yeah, means exactly what you think it is does, so I took her here a few weeks later and it wasn't quite as good, no orgasms at the table but still. In short, I'm obviously a fan. Best brunch I have had in Chicago THUS far (there have not been too many).",0.9865,0.752,0.16,0.088,0.46291564291564297

The berry french toast with creme (from the picture) was the best thing we had. I think if you want a good experience here, your best off ordering their sweet items, instead of their savory items. Learned that the hard way!  My scrambled eggs were over cooked and brown on the bottom, not fluffy like I had hoped :( The breakfast potatoes luckily saved me from returning my plate back to the kitchen, but the potatoes should not be the best thing on a plate. I got the two eggs any style with sour dough. Bread was good... The Latina Omelette with black beans and salsa, was good-but still, we've had similar entree's here in MI that are much much better, and this dish was not perfected or anything exceptional. The chicken sausage was OK.....nothing worth talking about.  The waitress was flustered the entire time, confused our drink orders with her other tables, forgot to give the maple syrup and water refills we had requested until after we'd finished the french toast. Her recommendations were unhelpful too, I mean really--she recommended tuna and the poblano pepper dish...whether we were adventurous eaters, tourists, or not, those recommendations seemed laughable to me.  I wish I could rave about this place, but I would've rather eaten the Marriott's buffet.  Stick to the sweet items, but as a recommendation to the owner-have your chefs watch the newest Master Chef season, there is an episode where Gordon Ramsey explains the correct standards of all types of breakfast eggs.

2012-07-22,1.0,"I am an true fan of Yelp reviews when picking out places to eat, and it's the way I found m. henry.  Unfortunately though there were a series of truly horrible errors made on our visit today.  The wait: 40 min long, but that is to be expected. What was annoying was when a party who came in after us (with the same number of guests) received a table before us.  Not sure what that was about, but we let it go.  We had traveled about 45 minutes to try out this new place and were going to make the best out of it. Service:  We say down at a nice table and our waitress soon came over. As former servers at restaurants before, my partner and I knew that we should check with the server regarding the kitchens timing that day because we had a bus to catch in just over one hour after sitting down.  Our server said things were a bit slow, but reassured us that we would surely be good to go in 1 hour. To be on the safe side, we went ahead and ordered our 1 omelette and side of a french toast slice. We would split... To save on time (and we heard the portions were large anyways). The time ticked on by with no food.  That's okay... Again, we used to be servers so we totally get that this is a kitchen matter and it's hard to catch up if you start the morning behind. Tick-tock, tick-tock... 20 min, 30 min, 40 min. Okay, it was getting ridiculous.  We asked our server how much longer and she said was keeping her eye out. About 3-5 minutes later here comes the one omelette. No french toast slice.  Since we just had less than 10 minutes to eat and pay, we asked her to cancel the french toast. Our first and last goodbye: the next 5 minutes were the cherry on top. Put came some french toast (looked good, but I thought we had cancelled that), I cut open the omelette to split it and what do I find? HAIR. Hair in the omelette! Okay, it was time to go... This was too much, especially for a place with such great reviews.  After 1.5hrs of travel and wait time, we left still so hungry and with no food.  This may have been a fluke incident, but we thought we should still share.  We are sad this happened and it is our first Andersonville restaurant that is going on our bad list. Sad (and extremely frustrating) day!!!   Fortunately I realize it's still a minor inconvenience in the scope of the world's problems, so I am looking forward to enjoying what is left of the day.  Everyday is a holiday after all!",0.9576,0.761,0.135,0.105,0.4737137862137862

I ordered the pancetta Florentine Benedict - hot potato rosemary flatbread topped with garlic spinach, crispy pancetta, crumbled goat cheese, two poached eggs, and hollandaise. Served atop a mixed greens salad. It sounded great, but in all honesty, it didn't thrill me. It was not satisfying on any level. I think it just tried to do too much, and consequently missed the mark...for me, at least. The mixed greens really took away from the dish because the dressing was fighting with other flavors...it was almost as if all the different tastes on the plate were in conflict, not in symphony. I was hungry, but I could easily have left most of it on my plate. I didn't want to let on that I wasn't happy with it, as I was a guest. I would have liked to see more basic, simple menu offerings, along with the more adventurous combinations. A regular eggs Benedict, well made, would have been perfect.

They have a huge, delicious sounding menu and we had to limit it to 2 items so this will not be my final rating as I'll likely be back to try more.  My friend and I came around 10 am on a Sunday morning just as the rush started, but we did get seated pretty promptly since she arrived early (I'm always late). The atmosphere is a cute, Euro cafe type of feel and everything looked really good. They had fresh baked chocolate chip cookies being placed in cellophane bags and small chalk boards on the walls.  We decided to split the crabcake benedict and the mango blueberry & rhubarb cinnamon stuffed french toast. The first dish as really good and they were generous with the crab which is a definite plus. The french toast disappointed me a bit mostly because i had Ann Sather's french toast fantasy in mind. The drawback of their preparation is that it was swimming in some sort of watery sauce that didn't add much flavor to the dish. They should have reduced it or kept it as a dry dish--I would have liked that so much better. Especially since the granola was supposed to add some crunch to it that was neutralized by the sauce. That's really where the lowered rating comes in.  Other than that, I would definitely recommend it if you're in the area. If you're up for a long wait, I'd say that there are plenty of brunch places in Andersonville (Ann Sather's and the recently opened Bongo Room) that may be more worth the wait. Let's face it, waiting for brunch is one of those things that you can't avoid in Chicago. ;)",0.9941,0.807,0.175,0.019,0.5330952380952381

I really like how everything came with so much fresh fruit and veggies because it helps lighten up the meal and make you feel healthier (even if you did just order a huge mound of french toast).  We ordered: - Smoked salmon rotolone: delicious, smoked salmon + egg + avocados = amazing combo - Lemon shrimp crab benedict: eggs were perfectly poached, and I really liked the crab cakes, which didn't seem full of fillers (often the case at many places) - Mango and blueberry cinnamon roll french toast: so good! I was conflicted between getting this or the bread pudding from last time, but finally settled on ordering something new. Really happy with my choice, and this is much much better than their blisscakes which I wasn't a fan of.

They put some beans, veggies and chipotle sauce in your omelet. In the beginning, I didn't want to have this dish because I am kind of tired of Chipotle smell.

Extra bonus that I found parking right in front of the restaurant. The menu has some interesting ideas, like creamy polenta presented in a ring of bacon or crab shrimp and lime cakes. Ultimately, I chose the peasant quiche made up of applewood bacon, asparagus, leeks, and gruyere. Oh my, that was delicious. It was served with a salad of mixed greens with dried cranberries and some fresh blackberries on the side. A nice combo. My friend ordered the black bean cakes with scrambled tofu which was served on  a housemade corn tortilla. I only had a bite, but it seemed tasty. Also, because we could not resist, we ordered the breakfast bread pudding to start. This was one of the most custardy bread puddings i've ever tasted. It's served warm with slightly cooked blackberries and peaches, which compliment the texture and sweetness beautifully. All in all, I approve. It's not a big space and the tables are sort of packed in, but the diners and staff were accomodating to help people get through to their seat.

2012-04-23,5.0,"So I LOVE brunch, especially creative-brunch (since I can easily make my own bacon, eggs, and hashbrowns at home).  However, my fiance loves the more traditional diner-style brunch.  He is not enthused to go to, as he calls it, fancy-brunch.  However, when I brought him to m.henry, I was surprised to see him finish off 2 plates!   If you have a party of more than 2 people, expect a wait no matter what time you go.  We were there at 9am and there were already parties waiting to be seated. I think m. henry is known for their bread pudding which is very delicious.  I've throughly enjoyed their crabcakes and their bacon wrapped baked eggs, as well.  My only complaint is that I don't like that they seat these dishes on a bed of mixed greens.  I'm not personally a fan of mixed greens in the morning.   I think their best dish is their huevos borrachos (drunken eggs).  My fiance ordered this and I was so jealous.  You get 2 sopes with scrambled eggs w/ chorizo and chorizo, cheese, and poached eggs, avocados, and delicious sauce.  It is a mouthful of yumminess.  The Mexican rice they serve with this dish was also one of my favorite Mexican rice preparations ever.   We also got the apple waffles which was very good!   I have one warning though - if you are thinking of getting the LARGE cappuccino, it is HUGE.  You get a bowlful, which is kind of unappetizing!",0.9851,0.761,0.175,0.064,0.6436761904761906

There are many, many, many other places you can go in Chicago that have far better food and have less of a wait (or even take reservations). Not saying M Henry is bad. Not at all. The food is fine. The service is fine. I still think the decor is adorable. But I just think it's nothing special, and certainly not worth all hype and REALLY not worth the long waits. We arrived at 9:30am on a Sunday, which... is early. There was already a huge line. My friend and I were lucky and didn't even have to wait that long (less than 10 minutes), but there were so many people jammed into the waiting area I started to get claustrophobic, and that is not an issue I have.

The place gets back on the weekend, so unless you're an early riser or don't mind a lengthy wait, I'd suggest trying to go during the week so that you can have a more relaxing experience. The quiche is consistently awesome. On my most recent visit, my mom tried it (asparagus, sautéed leeks, shallots, applewood bacon, gruyere and lorraine swiss. served with a hefty field greens salad), and it was delicious -- not stingy on the ingredients nor overly crusty. The French toast is also tasty, especially with the vanilla creme, though, like other places I've been to recently the bread tends to be soggy and there is no discernible difference between the outside and the inside (think I'll to to make a trip soon to Wishbone for their crispy French toast). Anyway, back to M Henry, the omelets are hearty and well seasoned. The service is efficient and friendly. When I went there a few days back, I had my two-year old son with me, and the server promptly brought him a bowl of bananas and strawberries to keep him occupied while the rest of the table ordered.   I'm also a big fan of M Henrietta, M Henry's less crowded sister restaurant on Granville, just south of the Loyola Lake Shore Campus.

I called ahead to ask about the typical wait for a party of five on Sunday around noon and was told thirty minutes, so I arranged for our party to meet at 11:30 to allow plenty of time to be seated and eat before our party had to leave for a play that started at 2:15 in Lincoln Park.  Unfortunately, we ended up waiting for over an hour to be seated, then another fifty minutes for our food, forcing us to race through brunch, which arrived in stages over ten minutes time, with poached eggs (three minutes cook time) being the last dish to the table while the simply hotcakes were undercooked and doughy and the chocolate strawberry french toast was cold, as was the omelet for the salmon rotolone.  At no point between our order and our food service did our waiter check in with us or explain the delay despite the fact that we told him we were on a tight schedule given our long wait to be seated and despite the fact that diners who arrived after we were seated were being served before us. And when we complained to the manager about the wait he did not apologize or explain the wait but rather pointed out the obvious: that they were busy.  He did reduce the check by 10%, but this hardly left me satisfied. A long wait to be seated is one thing, but a long wait once an order is placed only to be served cold, undercooked food brought to table in grossly staggered fashion is unacceptable, particularly for brunch where the cook time for most items is insignificant. If the kitchen cannot serve diners in a more timely and consistent fashion, then management needs to reduce the number of tables.

2012-03-13,3.0,"Blah, blah, the food is great (those bliss pancakes!) the lines are long (avoid them by going early on the weekends)... but what do I have to say that 907 reviews before me haven't already said? The half and half. The half and half! It ruins an otherwise perfect brunch experience. I HATE UHT milk, and have become, unfortunately, all too familiar with it after living in Spain for a year. What is UHT milk, you ask? Quick explanation follows: UHT milk is partially sterilized by heating it for a short time, around one to two seconds, at temperatures exceeding 275 degrees Fahrenheit. UHT milk has a shelf life of six to nine months, and is popular in hotter countries like Spain, where the cost of transporting milk in refrigerated trucks is very high. Consumption of UHT milk in Spain is at 95.7%, in Italy, 49.8%, compared to Great Britain, 8.4%. My theory on UHT milk? Any milk that can last for six to nine months unrefrigerated should not be trusted. Not to mention, it tastes kinda funny... kinda plastic-y. Guess what happens when you order that lovely bottomless cup of Metropolis coffee at M Henry? You also get presented with a bowl of UHT half and half packets... blech. No real cream in little pitchers, here. How does THAT match up to THIS philosophy, stated on their website: ""We prepare all our food from the finest natural and seasonal ingredients available, using locally produced & organic products whenever possible."" So where's the mismatch here?",0.9314,0.811,0.114,0.076,0.4972888888888889

The hostess seemed to be in a weird mood today --almost irritated-- but maybe it was because so many people wanted a table! Definitely a popular place amongst Northsiders. Also, as demonstrated by dozens in the under-2 set, popular amongst babies. Inside, the place can get pretty noisy, but not horrible. I was still able to have conversations with my friends. I've been here several times; the first time I sat outside in the back. I highly recommend that. It's so pretty with the hanging flowers. It's worth the wait. Their sweet brunch items are to die for. Bliss Cake, Mango-Berry Cinnamon Roll French Toast (swoon), and Brioche French Toast with vanilla creme are just a few of their offerings. Their savory selections are equally as good, however I've only eaten off of the plates of others. Today my vegetarian friend had some sort of Latin-inspired rice-plantain-soy dish, which was very tasty. She was really happy with it. I had the Brioche French Toast (without the vanilla creme). It was light and gooey and kinda soggy --but deliciously soggy! I mean that in the best way possible. So good. Although I rarely get tea in the morning (I need more caffeine), they have a fantastic selection of teas, including Rooibos (African red tea) which a lot of restaurants don't typically have. I dig the art on the walls. Bright, cheery, contemporary, not-pretentious. Near the entrance, there are dozens of bakery items. Once I came here with a friend who was born and raised in France and she was bowled-over by the selection. Street parking around the corner was easy to find.

I noticed (while waiting) that many customers orders pancakes with a mountain of fresh fruit on top, it looked so good I was anxious to grab a seat. Finally after the wait we sat down and ordered.  The famous Fruit pancakes is called, ""Bliss Pancakes"", which are 2 pancakes with vanilla mascarpone cheese in the middle like a sandwich over some berry sauce and all over fresh fruit like strawberry, blueberry with granola sprinkle on top of it all. It was so delicious and it was $9.25. My husband order the cinnamon french toast with mango and berries which was one of their special menu items that was $9.25 and it was also good.  I have to say it was a sugar crash after-wards but it was great. It was yummy and satisfying. The down fall is the waiting in line but that is typical for all small good restaurants.

Yet even Big Ben would crawl out of his boudoir if the destination is m.henry.  Why?  Bread Pudding and Egg Sandwiches, my friend.  The coffee and fresh squeezed orange juice are fantastic, too, but really, you haven't had Chicago brunch until you've had the egg sandwich. Mr. Henry's egg sandwich is simply not to be missed, as it is the best in the city, if not the midwest.  Crunchy toasted sour dough bread encases a fried egg, earthy gorgonzola cheese, tomatoes, and applewood smoked bacon that is not too crispy, not too chewy.  Cut the sandwich in half and the egg yolk slowly mixes with the cheese and bacon and the flavors explode in ways which humans probably should not experience.  The smoky and sour cheese notes, the acid of the tomatoes, the fatty crispness of the bacon, and the cream of the eggs are simply heaven on earth.  I eat this every time I visit, because you simply cannot get this level of flavor anywhere else in Chicago. Oh, yes, the bread pudding -- sweet Jesus this is not to be missed, either.  It comes with a plethora of warm fruit topped on warm creamy bread.  It is a perfect appetizer to your egg main course. Like many brunch spots in Chicago, you'll likely encounter a line unless you are an early bird.  I've noticed, however, that if you are merely a pair and not a larger or an odd numbered group that you will get seated rather quickly.  If not, they will serve you coffee while you wait, which, brewed by local favorite Metropolis, is quite good.

I licked my fingers. Really good sandwich. It actually filled me up. It came with a whole mess of delicious potatoes, but I was already too full to eat more than 2 or 3. The Cabana Boy said his pancakes were the lightest pancakes he had ever had. The Sibling said, why didn't I ever think of adding cocoa to french toast? She said, it really looked like a lot, and was totally filling, even though it was only 2 pieces of french toast. I got a bite of the french toast, and it was really good. I was hoping to snag a bite of the bliss cakes, too, but Cabana Boy inhaled them. Were it not for his facial hair, I think he might have picked up the plate and licked it clean. Service is excellent. We had a young waitress with strawberry-blond hair in a ponytail. She was a total professional. Water glasses barely got a chance to get low. My coffee cup was regularly refilled.

Hello, it's in Andersonville. It's really good though. My only complaints is that it can get pretty loud in there, so conversation at a normal decible isn't usually possible. The other complaint is they aren't open on Mondays. My mom and I were really bummed about that the one time we both had a Monday off and were in the area. Sad faces upon seeing it closed. Oh well.

2011-12-27,5.0,"M. Henry is homey and warm. The bakery looks fantastic - I saw several cakes, tarts and pastries that I would love to try. The breakfast was so filling, I couldn't bring myself to taste anything from the bakery case. We did, however, purchase a baguette for sandwiches later, and I have high hopes. I ordered a hot chocolate, and was a little leery about paying $4.50 for it. But, I wasn't disappointed. It tasted fantastic, and appears to be made with chocolate shavings instead of any kind of powder. At least, there were plenty left in my cup at the end. Also, it is finished off with two marshmallows - which appear to be homemade; certainly not a Jet-Puffed Kraft marshmallow. Lastly, while the price seemed high, it came in a huge cup. I had to make sure to swallow down the last bit of the chocolate just before leaving so I wouldn't leave any behind. The cocoa came probably a good 20 minutes before the meal did, and as I mentioned, lasted the full meal. I was thinking I may have to order another hot chocolate at some point, but it was the perfect accompaniment. I had the spinach & chevre omelette, which was great. I don't eat spinach a lot and wasn't expecting to really LOVE this dish, but I did like it a lot. Presentation was beautiful with fresh fruit to garnish, and the chevre was lovely and smooth. I've never had this cheese, and it was similar to warmed cream cheese in consistency. The omelette tasted different than I'm used to - a little tangier, for lack of a better term - but that wasn't really a bad thing. I would happily have it again. The potatoes were fantastic; I added a bit of salt, but with the spices included may have been perfectly seasoned for others. Lastly, the bliss cakes. Oh my. We ordered to share, because I really wanted to taste them but wasn't sure if I'd like it. I rarely if ever have fruit on pancakes, and certainly not mascarpone and oats. What can I say? It was heavenly; it was bliss. The fruit was perfect (even the strawberry garnish - I don't know how they had such perfectly sweet strawberries in December), and the mascarpone added a great flavor element. I couldn't help but be surprised how much I liked the oats added as well. It added a nice flavor to the dish as well as a perfect bit of added texture and crunch. I've never seen pancakes as thick as this, either. This dish was about as perfect as a breakfast item could be - a few hours later, I'm still delighted at how lovely this dish was, and recalling the taste on my tongue. This will definitely be my breakfast dish of choice at M. Henry. Overall, the food was great, the atmosphere was nice (it was not terribly loud but for the fact that the place was packed). I can't wait to go back, and I really would like to try lunch sometime as well. I was debating between four and five stars for them, and I opted for four (to four and a half) because it was a tad on the slower side, as far as restaurants go (not horrible), and the menu is right in saying that your patience will be rewarded. The other thing is that my partner wanted the brioche french toast, but for some reason it was not available today, so while that was a bit disappointing it wasn't horrible. I know he hopes to try them soon, and I hope that the absence of french toast isn't a regular occurrence. I'm glad I have my bonus week off to have the opportunity to try it; I don't know that I'll be able to do the weekend madhouse brunch thing, but I may have to go in to work late now and again to have a special breakfast.",0.9997,0.707,0.28,0.013,0.5732336182336183

Still don't get it? Let me make myself clear: THE FOOD HERE SUCKS. (Yelp, you best not remove my all caps, or I will sue you. That's how badly I need to get the word out on this place.) I recognize that I'm in the significant minority, but I can't fathom why anyone thinks the brunch here is good, especially with so many top-notch choices in Chicago. I'm convinced that people come here simply because they need an excuse to spend more social time with loved ones, which they can get from the ridiculously unwarranted wait time it takes to get a table here. In fairness, I can't blame people for that. Far too often we fail to spend enough quality time with the people we love. On a side note, I really want a dog. I think I'd like to get an Australian Shepherd because they seem so happy, and they're great Frisbee catchers. If you have an Australian Shepherd and would like to give said Aussie to me, I will gladly take the Aussie off your hands, if you agree to always clean its poop, since I'm doing you a favor by offering a loving home.  The first time I ate at M Henry was about a year ago. I ordered the Latina omelette. Nasty, and an embarrassment to anyone who identifies herself as Latina. I don't know what the heck they put in their chipotle sauce, but it tasted like vomit, and believe me, I know what vomit tastes like. I used to be the best puke-and-rally guy this side of the Mississippi.  Even though my first experience here was bad, I'm a reasonable guy. I usually offer second chances, and I did so here. The second time I ate at M Henry was this past weekend. I ordered the omelette special. Admittedly, it was decent, but it certainly didn't leave me wanting more. For a place with such phenomenal reviews, I expect to be awed. I wasn't.  My biggest beef with the brunch I've had here on both occasions is the home fries. I don't know what kind of ""home"" M Henry was raised in, but clearly it was a home where you are rewarded for making crappy food. Seriously, how can you eff up breakfast potatoes? I'll tell you how: By sprinkling entirely too much paprika on them and leaving them undercooked. As for the service... friendly, but rushed. And pushed out as quickly as possible without even a ""Thank you, come again."" Not sure why you'd fail to make such a simple gesture, but I'm just going to assume the staff must have perceived what was going through my mind, so they didn't bother.  I honestly wanted to like M Henry. But I didn't. And I won't be back. I value my taste buds.

I was motivated to post a review because of the excellent service I received yesterday. In the dozens of times I've eaten at M Henry during Saturday or Sunday rush, there had never been an unusually long wait for food to be served. Unfortunately, yesterday our food took about 25 minutes to arrive.  But around the 20 minute mark, our waiter stopped by our table to apologize for the delay and to tell us that some complementary treats would be brought out to us to make up for it. A minute later, a manager brought us a scone and an almond tart, gave us another apology, and explained that their kitchen was short staffed because someone just didn't show up that morning. This is how you handle problems in a restaurant. Every diner knows that things happen and no one expects every restaurant experience to be flawless. What separates good customer service from bad customre service is how the staff reacts to those occasional unavoidable problems. By giving us a preemptive apology and a couple of pastries that probably cost them a dollar, we walked away feeling even better about this restaurant than we already did. And as a bonus, we also discovered that their baked goods rock, and will go out of our way in the future to get some of them.

Pancakes will forever be flat cardboard-like pieces of garbage to me after eating the Bliss Cakes. These are fluffy, pillowy, thick cakes that I dream about when the weekend comes. Suggestion: ask for the sauce on the side or else everything gets all mushy and falls apart so you can't experience the fluffy fluffiness that is this dish. *sigh* My bf really likes their fried egg sandwich and I like to steal the potatoes off his plate because those are so good. They have cilantro on them, which I hate, but that's how tasty they are. I will put aside my distaste for cilantro to eat these potatoes. We also like to share their fruit and yogurt bowl.

Less options. *Weekend/Sunday Brunch: Long wait. More options.

And the freshly brewed, strong Metropolis coffee...SO GOOD! Three or four refills kind of good.  I highly recommend all their Egg Benedicts first and foremost which they only offer for Sunday brunch.

Absolutely fantastic menu; very creative and sophisticated options (where else can you enjoy bacon wrapped baked eggs with polenta or grilled shrimp and lobster benedict for brunch)? There are so many great sounding dishes that I think I sprouted some gray hairs racking my mind trying to figure out what to order. On my most recent outing I opted for the dulce banana rumba french toast (thick slices of brioche french toast with rum infused bananas and coated in caramel and pecans). One of the best breakfast items I have had in Chicago (or anywhere). The coffee is quite good here as well; a must for a satisfying brunch experience.  I have only made it to m.henry a couple of times as it is a bit far from my condo and they are a victim of their own success; the wait time on a weekend here is often quite long. The food here is so good that it is worthy of a long wait, but sometimes one is just not in the mood to stand around waiting for a table.  My marathon training group frequents a different brunch establishment every Saturday morning following our long run and each summer m.henry is generally regarded as people's favorite stop on our brunch tour. m.henry's food is sufficiently better than most other Chicago restaurants that it is worth a drive here from another neighborhood just to dine here.

The couple next to us put us to shame when their french toast dish came out! Piled high with fruit and sitting on vanilla creme... I know what I'm getting next time I go! I definitely recommend M.

I'd like to recommend something specific to eat here but the menu changes frequently and I usually try the specials! :) So, as always B.L., why 4 stars and not 5? I guess I'm not a gigantic fan of ""new"" American food or whatever it's called. I mean I am definitely a fan but sometimes a girl just wants some damn pancakes without something being braised or something being infused or whatever the hell they like to call it nowadays. If they had a few more dishes that were more traditional I'd probably re-review and give it 5 stars.

Also Thyme was on there for a nice spice. The potatoes were also great, and had a great spice to them. The french toast was good, but a little sweet. The peaches were fresh, but this is not something either of us could just eat all for breakfast. We ended up splitting both meals. I would definitely come here again.

This place was really poppin on a Saturday afternoon, but we only had to wait about fifteen minutes, for two people mind you. Once we sat down, our waitress was really nice and on top of things throughout our meal.  We were shocked with how the food came at a decent time considering how packed they were.  Both of our meals were delicious. The pancakes were yummy. The bacon was cooked perfectly.  The fruit salad was very fresh, perfectly portioned, and had a nice variety of fruits: pears, apples, kiwis, strawberries, and peaches.  I was feeling adventurous and decided to order a side of their yuba (the cream skimmed off the top of hot soymilk and baked up). It looks like paper thin sheets of something and has a light brown color to it. I didn't like it, but I didn't necessarily not like it. It definitely had a unique taste to it--almost smoky to the extent that it tastes burnt...

We pretty much roll ourselves out we eat so much.  The last 3 times I have gone have been disasters. I can take one or two bad trips, but 3 in a row? What is going on?!! Trip one: My pancakes had a section of batter that was not mixed, a large section about the size of a 50cent piece. It was just pancake powder. I sent them back and I got no apology or credit to my check. The group I was with was done eating before I got my remade pancakes and they had to wait for me. I was pissed. Trip 2: Service from hell. I ordered a cafe au Iait when we sat down, I got it  as we were paying our bill. I was not given a to go cup and it was on my bill - after I reminded our server several times throughout the meal. Not to mention drinks not getting filled and side dishes not being brought out.  Trip 3: The mother of all  bad trips.  We are seated and we order. She brings me a large juice when I ordered a regular, no sweat. We wait 45 minutes and several people who sat down after us are getting their food before us. My boyfriend is furious, he gets up to find our waitress and food. Our food finally arrives with apologies.  My boyfriends sandwich is on cold, un-toasted bread. The same sandwich he gets every time we go.  His potatoes are also cold. He gets the manager, they take it back. I am eating and voila! A big hair in my food. We get the manager, they take it back. I order something different and less likely to have hair... My boyfriends replacement sandwich is missing ingredients,  my replacement food (one of my favorite standbys) gave me a mild case of food poisoning. Awesome. Just Awesome.

This all went smoothly..but then nothing happened.  I really wasn't asking for a comped meal or anything...but maybe our waitress should have come back and told us that the kitchen had gone through the berries and they all looked ok.  Maybe a manager coming back to tell us that they decided to take the berries off of the menu until they could ensure they weren't serving other customers moldy produce.

The lemon tart was great, light and refreshing with a nice chewey buttery crust. From memory, I had the omelete special with walnut pesto.  When it came out--they forgot my pesto and they also informed us tha they were out of potatoes.  The waitress was kind enough to bring me my pesto, but it seemed that they were a bit skimpy on their application since the guy next to me had more.  Either way, it was tasty.  As we finished our meal, they brought us the potatoes to supplement the side salad.  The potatoes were mediocre at best.  Overall, it is a bit cramped, as I headed to the bathroom I was caught in a mini-traffic jam as a mother was trying to squeeze in with her stroller.

2011-06-25,3.0,"I've been wanting to go to m.henry for a really long time--I can't help but be curious about a brunch place with almost 800 reviews and 4.5 stars. So I finally went there with a friend on a nice Saturday afternoon.  I left m.henry full, but also a bit disappointed. First of all, they only offer their brunch menu on Sundays. On any other day of the week they just have a breakfast and lunch menu. I'm an I-can-eat-brunch-every-day guy, and was really hoping to try a couple of the things on the brunch menu.  That said, I had heard good things about the egg sandwich, so I went with it. It was good, but I feel like anything involving gorgonzola and smoked bacon will probably be good. The sandwich at m.henry wasn't really any more special than that. My friend had the Latina omeletta and seemed to think it was good, but not extraordinary.  The real disappointment were the blackberry bliss cakes that followed. (Hey, don't judge! I had been waiting to try this place for a while.) The hotcakes just weren't very flavorful, and the blackberries and mascarpone cream did not fix that. Maybe one of the French toast dishes could rescue the sweet section of m. henry's menu...

Cons:  Long waits, waiter was so busy we only saw him once after the food arrived.  He was nice but he was also lucky we didn't need much.   The food was fine but I can get better closer to home so in the future that's probably what I'll do.  If I was in the neighborhood again at some point in the future I'd totally be ok with coming here again but I won't be going out of my way to do so.",0.9231,0.803,0.126,0.071,0.5115537240537241

He ended up bringing her a tiny pot of the soup of the day to dip her potatoes in.  Really, really lovely gesture. And it really was a good dipping sauce. I'd go back again in a heartbeat.

Sure, the food is phenomenal and I may have, on occasion, dreamed of the killer egg sandwich, but it creates an experience. The atmosphere transports you into a rustic European cafe. The service is usually stellar (in the maybe 40 times I've been here we only had one slow service).  Typically I like to try a range of menu items when I frequent a restaurant. At m. henry I find it to be quite difficult to break away from the killer egg sandwich (lightly toasted sourdough bread, two medium fried eggs, crisp bacon, sliced tomato, and crumbled gorgonzola cheese) and the French toast (they use brioche). Only once have I wavered from my favorites. I got the goat cheese salad, which was one of the best salads that I've ever had, but it is so hard for me to stray from my usual. Now, if you come here on a Saturday or Sunday and for some reason expect to be seated right away, you are insane. This is a mecca for breakfast in Chicago and everyone knows it (and if they don't they should). No, you are not going to get a table right away, and yes, the waitstaff and hosts are busy. They are able to flip tables rather fast considering the seating capacity and the weekend demands. Personally, I am happy when I see the long lines. This is a good sign, dear people who hate to wait.

After a lengthy half hour wait outside (almost no waiting area inside) we were seated.  Sluggo sat on a bench seat that he complained about being uncomfortable while I sat in a much comfier chair (in all fairness, i volunteered to switch!).  The interior was nice.  Soft pastel colors on the wall with nice art that had a modern flair but wasn't confrontational or in contrast with the surroundings.  They also had a great/inventive way to provide separation between close tables; they hung glass window panes from the ceiling, though they were painted with really stupid pinstripe detailing like you'd find on a pimped out 1987 pickup truck. Sluggo ordered earl grey tea, I stuck with water.  We started with a half order of the bread pudding to share.  Honestly, I wish I had gotten this as my entree.  It was the highlight of the meal.  Covered in raspberries and peach slices, it was sweet, but not overwhelming. I ordered Huevos borrachos and Sluggo had the crabcakes benedict.  My meal was tasty, but the rice was quite dry.  Furthermore, the homemade (or housemade) tortilla was really thick and more of a polenta texture than tortilla texture.  The chorizo was nicely seasoned and tasty.  I found this dish good, but not inspired.  It was not something I'd probably order again. Sluggo's crabcakes LOOKED really tasty, but he didn't seem to be raving about them either.  He didn't like that the lemon sauce wasn't very lemon-y.  His plate also looked like a lot of filler with the salad on the side.

M Henry has become a top contender on my favorite brunch places in the city. There are two major reasons: I love the setting, and I have two favorite dishes (one savory the other sweet, so no matter what I am in the mood for, they deliver).  The setting is comfy and cozy, this is the type of place you want to wear yoga pants and possibly your grandpa's old cardigan. They've created walls with paneled windows that make it still feel really open, on top of that the whole place is really light and airy (as opposed to other brunch spots that are jammed pack with one window). The service is always excellent and each server has a great personality; and get this, they actually interact with their customers, never making you feel like you should eat quick then hit the road.  Now, onto the real reason to go to any restaurant...the delicious food. I have to tell you that no matter what you get, you must have a side of their potatoes. Honestly, I could eat an entire plate. I have no idea what they season them with, but they are un-be-lievable. When I want something sweet, I always go for Blackberry Bliss Cakes. Blissful indeed: fruity, tart, fluffy, carby, creamy, and then with a little crunch. When I want something savory my favorite is Fannie's Killer Fried Egg Sandwich.

My Latina girlfriends all have spice to them! :) My fiancee had the breakfast sandwich- again good, but not great.

Everything was solid top to the bottom.  The service was attentive and on the ball with the coffee.  All that said, worth a two hour wait?  Probably not.  There are lots of good brunches around town.  This is one of the best I've had, but they're not doing anything so unique or interesting that I'm in a rush to go back.  Get there early, have some blisscakes and coffee and get on with your day.",0.9877,0.771,0.191,0.038,0.6027630805408584

That is, until my girlfriend and I found ourselves looking to try something new and I suggested going to Andersonville (because we never get around to going) and picking whatever spot we ended up in front of. That spot was M. Henry. I was disappointed, upon entering, because I realized that I'd gotten my hopes up about a brunch item that wasn't being served because, um, it was a weekday afternoon. Even so, I carried on and dove into the moderate but simple menu. The beverage choices were solid, a selection of teas, coffees, juices, and sodas ample enough to leave almost anyone satisfied. The entree options were straight-forward but tasty. I opted for the vegan epiphany (I'm not vegan, but close enough to enjoy a good tofu scramble) and my partner had the latina omeletta. The vegan epiphany was delicious, though I don't think my yuba ever arrived. The potatoes were awesome, if a tiny bit salty. We traded bites of our meals, and while both were tasty, we each preferred our own.

The bacon was also very delicious. The sausage was horrible.. it didn't have much flavor to it (at all) which was pretty disappointing.

The french toast was made with brioche, and this may have been what made it the best french toast I've ever had. While the bread was thick, it still maintained a light airiness to it.

2011-01-10,4.0,"Pros: Food, Service, Great Atmosphere, Price Cons: Parking, Long Lines/Wait (Especially on Weekends) Honest 4.5 on the richter scale for me... My friends say all my reviews are a bit harsh and at times can be a bit nasty.  This is for the most, VERY true.   I just feel honesty is the policy. This is a review for the most is positive, but I will start with the 2 cons this time around. CONS: M.Henry is a such a great place and well known in the city that one is always going to find a line at one point or another.  This can be a bit frustrating when all you want to do is sit and eat.  The reason, I think the long wait is because most folks just like to hang out.  With such a great atmosphere and food, seriously, why leave?  I am certainly guilty of this as I slowly sip on my coffee and devour the food, but at a slow yet caring pace. Parking.. .LORD knows parking is a big contribution to where you want to go.  M. Henry has ""NO"" parking whatsoever and this for the most can be crucial.  Especially when you have to feed the meters (THANK YOU DALY FOR THAT CRAP) and then you have to wait in line to even be seated to begin with, now you have to worry about the meter and the lines.   That is truly frustrating and wish somehow M.Henry can fix this problem, but being in the Andersonville hood, that scenario is highly unlikely, so now we just have to focus on the good. PROS: FOOD/PRICE ... my goodness, can the food be any more scrumptiliousis (i know; not a real word).  Seriously, always fresh and always so delicious.  Everything on the menu does not seem to be overpriced at all, since the amount of food and preparations and love that goes into it to begin with.   There is a chef back there who is in control and loves what he/she puts out on that plate.  This is not your run of the mill late night ""diner"" that have 40,000 things on their menu and usually all crap.  A decent menu size with great foods.  That is what I like and what I look for.   What I also love about this place is how easily most food can be converted to vegan/vegetarian.  I usually get the egg sandwich but switch out the bacon for vegan bacon.  (I am trying to be more healthy these days in my choices).  This is also great because I have friends that are vegans & vegetarians, so they don't have to feel out of place or go somewhere far to grab a meal.  That is hard enough already. SERVICEis top notch ( i have no idea those other haters are talking about, cough Jessica, Brian etc.)  I have been here so many times that I never had service without a smile.  Even when i can not even make a decision, they are quick to recommend something easily and most likely enjoyable.  This can be a turn off for some, but i find it a positive. ATMOSPHERE, i love this place, it is so cozy even with all the crowds.  I never feel that I am going to be bothered by some folks, even that family coming in with their noisy, overly spoiled and bratty kids.  I always enjoy my stay there and I always feel welcomed. I even enjoy their coffee and I am a snob when it comes to coffee... (Right Peter?) The food here is definitely not for the stubborn who are unwilling to deal with change or even have an open mind.  Who quickly bicker about small things like not enough this or that.  You know what ""SPEAK UP"" if you don't like something.  I am sure they will be more than happy to accomodate you desire/taste.   But it is those folks who can make a real good place bad place to visit. So watch out for them.. and stay clear...  Easily better than most places, even those 5 star restaurants that serves you 1 ounce of food for 15 dollars. and that folks, is my 2 cents...",0.9992,0.715,0.219,0.066,0.6046219521219522

The trick was to find a place that would blow away my brother the egg sandwich connoisseur as well as my (utterly impatient) vegan mom. Even after a 30+ minute wait on a Thursday morning, M Henry won the challenge.  On my last trip to M Henry, I was impressed by the decor and atmosphere, but a little disappointed in the only explicitly-vegan item on the menu.  I don't know what changed, but the tofu scramble was absolutely out of the ordinary and delicious. It was filled with spinach and veggies, it didn't rely on salt for flavor, and the taste was so incredible I didn't even put hot sauce on the potatoes for fear of overpowering the plate. My brother KILLED his sandwich, which was huge, and remarked on its greatness on various otherwise-unrelated occasions throughout the day. For those of you vegans, I found out that virtually every egg dish can be made with tofu. This needs to be made clear on the menu, don't you think?

Today, however, was not the case.  Our server came to the table 10 minutes after we were seated, and took drink orders from my two girlfriends, but walked away before taking mine since I was putting my son in his highchair.  When he returned, he brought the drinks they had ordered and a coffee for me, which was fine since I drink coffee (and lots of it), but had I been able to place my own order, I would have asked for a chai.   He then ran away again, returning 10 minutes later, to ask if we were ready to order.  We hadn't decided yet, but he snarled and started to walk away when I stopped him and asked if we could put in the orders for the kids so as to suppress any tantrums that might be had by 3 hungry toddlers.  He gave me a dirty look and said ""I just asked if you were ready to order.""  He took the orders for the kids and disappeared again. The kids' meals arrived 20 minutes later at which time he was ready to take the orders for the adults.  Our food arrived 30 minutes later, at which time all kids were already finished eating and now had to sit through us finishing our meals.  We had to flag him down for coffee refills, and he brought us our check 10 minutes after the table had been cleared.

My boyfriend had the fried egg sandwich and it lived up to expectations: The potatoes on the side were great as well.  I had the crab/shrimp benedict and it was really good.  I don't normally like crabcake benedict, but mixed w/ the salad, it was great.  Their menu states they serve fresh-squeezed orange juice but a waitress at the bar pulled out a gallon jug of OJ that had a label on it.  Didn't look too freshly squeezed to us.... M Henry serves Metropolitan coffee - huge plus - and the service was really friendly, though we did overhear 2 servers kind of making fun of a table of patrons, which was unfortunate.  The drive north was worth a great brunch: Wish we would have known it was BYOB beforehand!  We'll be back, next time w/ a bottle of champaign.",0.9897,0.771,0.197,0.032,0.5897727272727272

Everyone I know has been raving about this restaurant based on price, service, and the food. After experiencing this for myself, I have to wholeheartedly agree.  We had a table of 5 people, and miraculously we only had to wait 25 minutes to be seated at noon on a Sunday. Our waitress was very courteous and attentive, the food came out quickly, and the coffee cups were always full. I ordered the Salmon Napoleone which was fantastic. It had a kaleidoscope of flavors, none of which was unwelcome. We also had the blackberry blisscakes, the crab and salmon eggs Benedict, the apple and sour cherry blisscakes, and a rosemary and proschuitto eggs Benedict. Everything was delicious and our table left with smiles all around. The total bill for 6 entrées, 1 side of bacon, and 5 cups of coffee was $80 before tip. Truly worth every penny.  The only bad thing I can say is that I was depressed to see they had sold out of fresh baked French baguettes before I had a chance to buy one!

2010-11-27,5.0,"I have to give this place five stars for my first experience there. I should only give four because I usually only give this many stars to places that have consistently provided wonderful service, food, atmosphere but I was truly charmed upon first impression so I guess the five stars are for a singular experience with high hopes that it will live up to it with the next visit. The atmosphere is that of a small country diner maybe a little European in flare. There are windowed doors hinged to provide cozier dining in the larger spaces and smaller adjacent rooms so your not stuck sitting in the middle of crowded cafeteria type spacing. My girlfriends and I were meeting for an emotionally charged reunion brunch, which when you care that much about your company the place and space is almost irrelevant, but the cuteness of M Henry kind of enhanced the vibe a bit.  We had to wait maybe 40 minutes to be sat but there is a bakery in the front where you can get a pastry and/ or coffee and chat while you wait. The food was fantastic. There are plenty of (good) vegetarian dishes on the menu, from first glance, plenty of vegan dishes too.  Two of us ordered  jorge's black bean cakes & eggs which is two spicy black bean cakes topped with chipotle sour cream, two eggs and hash brown type house potatoes. If you decide to try this I'd recommend asking for an extra side of the chipotle sour cream. It's meant for the black bean cakes but it's delicious on everything. The third of our trio just ordered eggs and toast. Nothing exciting but even that looked tastier than usual. Then again that could have just been the space, place, and time but judging by other people's reviews, maybe not. I recommend this place to anyone of any dietary preference who don't mind waiting a bit for non-pretentious mid-range priced creative tasty diner (New American style as they call it) cuisine.

It's a flaky tofu that's fried and flavored with soy sauce. It was a bit weird, quite salty. I thought out of all people I would enjoy eating it, but I think I'll pass on that one.  Service was excellent. The waiter was prompt and came by at the right timing.

I usually prefer the sweet over the savory breakfast, so I was counting on this dish to satisfy my craving. Damn, did it ever! The blackberries weren't too tart, and the crunch from the oat crust gave it a nice texture contrast. I'm all about that little bit of crunch in an otherwise soft/mushy dish.  As for the savory part of the meal, the breakfast burrito was BOMB DIGGITY! I actually preferred the savory over the sweet this day. The ratio of all the ingredients was perfectly balanced. A lot of breakfast burritos are ruined by the high egg/cheese to other ingredient ratio. The corn, black beans, potatoes and whatever else it was that was in there so perfect. Throw in a side of breakfast potatoes and it really was the perfect breakfast. On top of all that, eating outside on the patio on a perfect day in May just made it an even better experience.

This was my first visit to M-Henry and I didn't even know the place existed.  My friend told me that this was her favorite brunch place in the world - which was a bit hard to believe - but since she's been all around the world, I gave her the benefit of the doubt. When I first looked at the menu, I was a bit disappointed that I could not find my usual favorite breakfast items like ""Biscuits and Gravy"" nor  any hearty meat and egg dishes.  So I let my friend order  for me.    We ended up getting blackberry bliss cakes, which came on warm hotcakes layered with delightful blackberries and cream sauce.  And the sugar coated oat bits gave this dish a bit of crunchiness to each bite.   I think I said ""wow"" after the first three bites. The second item was rustic peasant quiche, which was filed with cooked tasty veges (like asparagus and leeks) and applewood bacon. And the flavorful gruyere swiss made me thank the French for inventing a dish called Quiche! The last item we had was called ""Out of this world breakfast bread pudding.""  Again, here is another extraordinary claim, but it was fully backed up by the quality of the dish.  I'm not even gonna bother to tell you what went in there - cause I don't, but  it was amazing!!  See pics. The  bottom line is that I left the place full and satisfied and still felt like a real man.  And M Henry has become one of my favorite brunch places - definitely top 3 in my book!

However, this bread pudding came highly recommended, so my party tried it as an appetizer for brunch last Sunday. I almost wanted it to fail so my rampage against pretentiousness would prevail (I'm realizing a twinge of irony here...). Alas I digress. The bread pudding was THAT good, friends. It's not overly rich or sweet (I dislike overly sweet breakfasts), yet is mighty flavorful. The bread lightly creamy and pillowy accompanied by cooked berries and peaches (best combo ever btw). Seriously, I'm in love with this bread pudding. If I knew how to make it, I would be morbidly obese.  The bread pudding was definitely the star of the brunch for me. Otherwise, I got the pancakes (solid) with a side of potatoes, which are WAY better than I make (and I make a mean roasted potato...). If I could make a breakfast out of the bread pudding and potatoes, I'd be in heaven. Next time.... The boy really liked the french toast and the madre thought her eggs were tasty - although she ordered scrambled and ended up with over easy...no biggie. Every thing was solid, and the bread pudding was of course fantastic. Side note: m Henry is BYOB. We brought a bottle of champagne for mimosas.

I don't require much to satisfy me, and that's why I was so blown away by M Henry.

I felt like a breakfast VIP.  It was the big parties that had to wait. I was pleasantly surprised. My only experience with M Henry breakfast was the food porn displayed in the reviews. I was excited.  I ordered the simply French toast with seasonal berries and cream and a side of bacon because bacon makes everything better. The brioche French toast didn't need the assist because it was great. The friendly waiter gave me syrup on the side, but I didn't need that either. The applewood smoked bacon was a nice addition.  My only wish is that the food lasted longer, but that's a testament to how good I found it. The menu had so many other items that looked tempting, but I'm going to have to wait until next time.

This is definitely going down in the books as one of the best breakfasts I've ever had.  I was worried that the mascarpone would be too rich or that it would be so heavy, oozing out, gloriously mocking me and reminding me that I worked out hard all week so I could enjoy a decadent breakfast. But really, it was just a nice even layer and wasn't too heavy or rich to take over the fluffy pancakes and just added a bit of sweet creaminess. The warmed blackberries were very fresh and added a bit of sweetness as well.  I shiver again thinking of the applewood smoked bacon that was also delicious and added the savory to my sweet breakfast. Coffee? yes please. Hot and refilled often.

2010-08-01,4.0,"I tried M. Henry a few weeks ago after reading Yelp reviews on their French toast dishes. I LOVE sweets for breakfast/brunch, so I decided on the seasonal Strawberry Rhubarb French Toast and a Cappuccino. I opted to have the french toast sans the creme and asked for maple syrup instead. The waitress explained that the dish had a fruit compote, which I understood, but I didn't realize that the compote would be so juicy that the french toast would be floating in strawberry-rhubarb juice. So... I didn't really need the maple syrup! I was worried about the french toast being really soggy because of all the juice, but the bread was really fluffy and thick, so it was no problem sopping up all the fruity-goodness without the toast becoming a soggy mess. The toast was also topped with crunchy granola, so that added great texture to the dish. The cappuccino was huge (as American cappuccinos tend to be), but it had a good amount of espresso and a beautiful foam layer, artfully prepared with a barista's design swirled on top.  I will definitely come back to try some other sweet dishes, and perhaps some savory ones as well. I must mention that I got to the restaurant at about 2 pm on a Sunday and didn't have to wait for a table for one.

I myself had cinnamon roll french toast stuffed with mascarpone cheese, mango, blueberries, and topped with a crunchiness on top that appeared to be like coco crispies. Whatever it was, it was good.

Luckily there were only 2 of us so we were seated immediately. The place was full to the brim with a nice crowd of 20somethings-30somethings some with kids. With regards to children, all of the kids there that day were incredibly well behaved, but this place definitely has a grown-up's menu. The service was great, coffee warmups every 10 minutes with a smile.  I ordered the Latina omelet and received it in a very timely fashion. After how much my girl had talked this place up, i was not really that impressed. I love southwest style breakfast food with a passion and there were some really conflicting flavors on the plate. For instance, the egg dishes, including the Latina, comes with a side of potatoes that are seasoned with rosemary and thyme, which is delicious at dinner with some poultry but I really don't think it belongs on the plate with a southwestern breakfast. The spices were just too overwhelming for breakfast and didn't, in my humble opinion, mesh well with the rest of the plate. Also, I understand that sour cream is great with your spicy southwest breakfast, but the sour cream in this dish was INSIDE the omlette so when i tasted it, the cream was almost hot; it just didn't hold up well inside the omlette, i think it should have been on the side.  Otherwise, all the ingredients tasted fresh, coffee and service were good and they have an expansive menu I look forward to sampling in the future and for 12 bucks a person for brunch, i will be coming back for more, especially the bakery.",0.9934,0.806,0.17,0.024,0.5369444444444443

I can't remember the exact fruit combination that they generously topped their brioche french toast with (it was one of the daily specials, not on the regular menu), but I do remember a perfect blend of sweet and tart. The bread was thick and hearty, nothing like that plain supermarket white bread. I guess I have never been turned onto the joys of brioche until then. It was also topped with their homemade granola adding texture to the soft bread and ripe, juicy fruits.  I also ordered their apple-maple chicken sausage and their house potatoes because I love the combination of sweet and salty. Both were a good compliment to the french toast. I was hoping there would be some combo for  french toast and side of sausage, but there wasn't. I've noticed that most breakfast/brunch places don't offer this, maybe because people don't eat like me. Anyhow, if you're watching your tab, ordering sides a la carte can pump up your bill. Both times that I've been to M. Henry were on Friday's and there was no wait. I heard that weekend waits can be very long so I would recommend going here on a weekday.

On the plus side, the food and decor were good, but the wait was just flat out annoying.",-0.3205,0.853,0.069,0.079,0.5730769230769232

We wanted a place that was good and open early on a weekday. We found it via Yelp and are so glad we did. Since then, this establishment has become a fixture in our daily lives.  - We take family/friends there when visiting from out of town.  - I take clients there for breakfast and it makes me look awesome. - I get my coffee and fresh baked brioche there in the morning (it happens to be very close to my office).  - I had an event at my office and we used them for am and lunch catering. The selection was delivered promptly and the baked goods were still warm as people tore into them. - Last year M Henry even saved Christmas because their homemade cookies, granolla, pancake mix happen to make great presents for far-off family members who can taste a bit of what we can enjoy at anytime.  The food is sublime and way under-priced given the quality, portions, and presentation. If you like bacon, the candied applewood smoked bacon as a side will send you over the moon.  As you can tell I go there a lot and I always try to order something different.

I've walked by M Henry a number of times but didn't pay much attention until I stumbled on the glowing Yelp reviews! So with that said, it was time to make this my brunch stop of the weekend. Walking down Clark, I could see the people spilling out of M Henry and all I thought was...""shit."" I've spent many a Saturday morning waiting on a sidewalk to get basic breakfast food and shot up prices. But the sucker that I am, I went in anyway and checked in with the hostess. Instead of being greeted with a grouchy ""It's going to be at LEAST an hour."", the night lady replied with ""2? I have you down. It's a quick wait and you'll be seated shortly."" How refreshing! Met with my friend and as she said, we were seated right away. The waitress was very pleasant, but I was stunned by how large the place was! I thought it was going to be a max of 10 tables but there was a lot of seating and packed. Loved the decor with the exposed bricks, modern art, and classic glass windows separating tables. I started with a large orange juice and was so excited to see the vegetarian and vegan options on the video! I was torn bewtween a few items but went ahead with Jorge's Black Bean Cakes & Eggs with a side of potatoes and scrambled eggs. WOW. The black bean cakes were outstanding and spicy! The side of potatoes were easily some of the best, I've had too. Unfortunately...this is where the star gets knocked off. I was leaning between 4 and 5 all day and ultimately went with 5. Why was I leaning back and forth? My eggs were done wrong...but as a waiter in my past I understand these mistakes happen. This is ideal brunch in the city The price is right. Wonderful options.

As for the taste. With a little hot sauce on top, the dish was very good. Everything was cooked just right (including the plantaines) and there was a healthy portion where I was not feeling hungry at the end of my meal. The service here was very good as our waiter was always in eye sight if we needed anything and he checked up on us just enough where he was not bothering us every 2 seconds, making sure everything was alright. There is a bakery in the front half of the store which sells fresh pastries for a somewhat reasonable price. I would have given the pastries we purchased a review, but the wife ate all of them before I could get it to it, so I am assuming it was good.

Two blisscakes surrounded by mangoes and strawberries in a sort of light, fruity syrup, covered in pecan and cinnamon granola and powdered sugar and with a delightful middle of creme fraiche.  You know how you take a first bite of something when you're really hungry and you know something's going to be yummy and your mouth is like ""oh my god this is awesome"" but then you get past it and eat like a normal person?

So we ordered from the regular breakfast menu on the Saturday we dined here. I was pleased with the quiche paired with a light baby spinach salad and a few pieces of fresh fruit. I'm always looking for dishes that include greens, and I'm thrilled M Henry does this (instead of making salad a side item).  I tried my friend's blackberry hotcakes, which were heavenly! Surprisingly not too sweet! The crunchy layer of brown sugar and oats on top really gave the dish the most texture and sweetness. Also tried the spicy black bean cakes, which were pretty tasty too. My bf wasn't too impressed with his fried egg with bacon sandwich. However, the roasted potatoes that accompany each breakfast were crispy and seasoned very nicely. Prices are very reasonable for breakfast (~$9 per entree; brunch is a few dollars more), and portions were right - no excess leftovers to take home. Also, the wait wasn't too bad. I came around 10 AM on a Saturday, and it didn't seem like many parties had to wait more than 20 mins.  Besides, the smell of garlic hits you as soon as you walk in, and you won't want to leave until you've eaten here.",0.9856,0.79,0.167,0.043,0.5818799058084771

We arrived at 8:05 and by 8:50, we still didn't have our food. Normally this wouldn't be a huge deal, but we had two children under three with us. We understand that things happen, but when we questioned our waitress about it, she snapped at us that we couldn't possibly understand how busy the kitchen was and how it was the hostesses fault for seating too many tables at once. No apology, no free muffin, no nothing. Mind you, the 3-top that was seated 15 seconds before us had paid and left 5 minutes before our food even arrived. The food is excellent, but it's not worth the stress of schlepping 20 minutes north hoping to arrive there by 8:00 to beat the crowds, only to be treated like idiots.

What happened to ""made to order""?  - The bread on the fried egg sandwich was just plain tough. Not conducive to a relaxing breakfast treat.

It was the summer and a friend suggesting dragging 10 of our best friends to M Henry and me being neither impressed by the online menu nor the over 400 some odd reviews was entirely against coming to M Henry. We got to M Henry and were told seating a party of 10 with nearly an hour to go was near impossible. We left. Today on my day off I decided to sneak off to M Henry and was worried I would run into the same situation again, but was seated immediately much to my delight! I zipped through the specials and the menu and my eyes landed on some eggs benedict on crab cake with potatoes and I was instantly sold. I ordered tea, sat back and relaxed taking in the beautiful art on the wall and the vast amount of sunlight flooding the room - I knew I was in for a treat. As my iced tea arrived and water plopped down on my table, the anticipation for the well-reputed food made the wait all the more bearable. Would I be hungry after I ate? Would I try some blisscake as others who saw my foursquare check-in were suggesting? The possibilities seemed as endless as the universe is vast. In a short amount of time my iced tea was refilled while I enjoyed the company of a friend and the minutes passed by ever so subtly. When the food arrived the internal cheering section roared with adulation as the rubber met the road when the fork stuck into the egg resulting in yolk oozing over a fine layer of crab cake underneath.

They don't have a double-door entry so the waiting area stays pretty darn cold during the winter. Assuming you can fit inside, you'll be keeping your coat on while you wait for your table. The place is pretty cute inside. I like the french door panels as partitions. If you want coffee or sweets to go, the counter seemed to be moving pretty quickly. Anyway, so the food was good. I had the huevos barrachos (aka drunken eggs). Tasty, sloppy, a little spicy...all the things you can ask for in .... a meal. I also tried some of Mary's quiche and some of Keesh's potatoes (it might have been confusing had Keesh ordered quiche) and all were good. I'd say 4-star good. Why the extra star then, you ask? Glad you asked! The extra star is for how well they handled our somewhat discombobulated party and the excellent service and patience our waiter exhibited.

Henry.  Lucky us!   In fact, when we sat down with our friend, he admitted that the ""trendy"" factor had gone up since he'd last been there.  Would it be too cool (and too pricey?) for us?  No!  We found it to be just our taste, style, and price range!  So either we're trendier than we thought (nah), or M Henry is just a good, warm, bright place for a tasty meal and conversation (though it's a bit noisy). -Set up: there's a coffeeshop/bakery/deli thing going on in front, though it might be hard to actually order anything with the crowd waiting for lunch milling around -Wait: we were told 20 minutes, we maybe waited 10.  Win! -Deco/Atmosphere: I like all the fake windows and doors used as partitions throughout the place.  It's warm and bright, but also busy and noisy.  Lots of couples and families.   -Hot bevies: coffee was meh--kind of bitter (and I usually like it strong).  Barely finished my cup.  The tea looked promising: folks at other tables had little glass carafes of hot water--they'd submerge the tea and turn the cup upside down over the top to hold the steam in while it steeped.  Probably just makes regular old tea, but it sure looks fancy. -Food: in general--it tasted even better than it looked (and it looked pretty darn good).  I got the jerk chicken empanada lunch special with soup.  The soup du jour was yellow split pea, so I assumed that's what I was getting (server didn't ask what kind I wanted), but instead I think I wound up with some kind of plain house vegetable soup.  It didn't look like much, but tasted great!  Rich and almost sweet (in a good, interesting way).  Think there may have been some okra in there.  Empanada was adorable, with a little dough in the shape of a star placed like a seal on top.  Filling was sweet and spicy: jerk chicken, carmelized onions, and golden raisins, and really had a kick to it.  SK had the crabcake po' boy and liked it--I had a bite and wasn't thrilled, but then again, I'm not into crab, so I wouldn't be.  SK's only comment was that the bread-to-filling ratio was a little too weighted toward the bread.  They didn't skimp on the filling--the bread was just giant. Our friend DL had the turkey sandwich--came with avocado, pesto, cranberry spread, etc.--he seemed pleased. Price: hey, better than I thought!  In and out for under $10 a person, at a hot spot in the city?  How'd that happen?  Fantabulous.

Luckily my friends and I like to share our food so I got to try a bunch of dishes.  It was hard to choose what to order since everything sounded yummy.  Note:  you can do half orders on the bliss cakes and french toast but portions overall are a good size for one person. Mango and sour cherry bliss cakes - didn't have many actual mango or cherry fruits but you could still taste the fruits and it was delicious.  The bliss cakes (pancakes) were light and fluffy and the granola they topped on there was delicious.  I hate whipped cream and was so happy that there wasn't any whip on the cakes. Key lime and apricot brioche french toast - also delicious.  If you like key lime, you have to try this while it's still available.  The presentation was cute too! M Henry's home comfort plate - nothing to rave about.  There was not much bacon in the crepe; maybe I couldn't taste it w/ the butternut squash; it was just bland.  The eggs w/ the salsa verde was not bad though. The lemon crab and shrimp cake benedict was delicious!  A nice play on the regular eggs benedict.  The hollandise sauce was not a heavy sauce so it complemented the crab/shrimp cake very well. Fannie's killer fried egg sandwich - also good but didn't really care for the cheese inside the sandwich.  It was a bit dry but the overall dish was good. Service was perfect - they were nice and accomodating people. The only reason why I didn't give this place a higher rating was that I found a lot of glasses that were dirty.  They did replace them when I showed them the icky ones. Parking was a bit difficult but we got lucky by parking on a nearby side street that didn't have meters or a residential zone sign!  Go free residential parking!

They raved about the omelette, but were underwhelmed by the bread pudding. I tasted it and concur. It seemed like there was too much fruit or something, so it was a bit over-liquidy (I'm sure that's not a word, but whatever). It still tasted good, despite textural difficulties. I ordered the special, the peach and sour cherry blisscakes. I cannot say enough good things about them. The fruit was warm and just sweet enough, the mascarpone made it creamy, and the brown sugar-oat crust gave it a bit of texture. I normally give up halfway through sweet breakfasts, but this time I made it into the clean-plate club with no problems. I will most definitely be back.

We made plans weeks in advance to see the New Moon movie and he was giddy with excitement. But when the movie night finally came, he was subdued. I asked what was wrong and he said ""I think I used up all my excitement"".  This is a perfect analogy for my experience with M Henry. My excitement is just all kindsa used up.  I've been wanting to try it for years. I read about it in Chicago Magazine. I've read about it online. I've read all the great reviews on Yelp. However, I just refuse to wait more than 15-20 mins to eat at a breakfast spot. Dinner, I can have a martini at the bar... breakfast, I'm just going to a different place.  My Mr. and I found ourselves wanting brunch on Black Friday. I suggested M Henry because finally, we had a weekday off and maybe the wait would be shorter.  I was right. Our wait was only a few minutes. Sweet.  My husband looked at the menu in silent horror and finally said ""if I had known it was ORGANIC I wouldn't have agreed to come here"".  Oooops. I ""forgot"" to mention that.    My opinion of the menu: meh.  I'm NOT a sweets at breakfast kinda gal which limits my options to just a few items. If you like starches smothered in sweets and berries in the AM., you're in luck.  I ended up going with the spinach, onion and goat cheese omelett and added bacon. The Mr. likes to copy me and got the same (well, he isn't a sweets person either and since our options were limited, he almost HAD to copy me).  The good: the breakfast potatoes are some of the best I've ever had. Flavorful, herb-y, well cooked... YUM.  The bad: the centers of our omelets were cold. My husbands literally had a blob of cold goat cheese in the center so he had to open the omelet and spread it around with his knife to evenly distribute it.  The waitstaff were very busy and didn't have time to do things like refill coffee or hot water for my tea.  Our bill for the two omelets, two sides of bacon, a coffee and a hot tea... $29.

I didn't know so many people had the luxury of a weekday brunch. I should befriend them!  We ordered: - Hot tea and iced tea (they have soy milk on the menu - bonus points!) - A cup of soup. Today's was Portuguese Kale. It was incredible - flavorful broth laden with chickpeas, carrots, beans, potatoes, kale, little pieces of sausage. I ended up getting a quart of this at the bakery for the house.  - Blackberry bliss cakes. More like blackberry HEAVEN cakes. This dish really just flipped my brain around. I am not a fan of sweet brunch foods. Too sweet, too much syrup. These hot cakes are absolutely divine though. No syrup required here. The marscapone cream provides a creamy sweetness, the blackberries are fruity and tart, and the brown sugar and oat topping adds a much welcomed texture to this fluffy hotcakes dish. These bliss cakes (they also had a mango/blueberry one today) will make anyone's day better. - Vegan Epiphany. Tofu scrambled with veggies, served with potatoes and yuba. They used a softer tofu than I normally like, but I see that they were going more for the tofu as substitute scrambled eggs. The potatoes were a little overcooked and bland, I should have subbed in fruit. The yuba though! Crispy sheets made out of soy leftovers? They need to package these and sell them in place of potato chips. Delicious. - Single side french toast. It came with berries! I love berries.  - Side of apple chicken maple sausage. Is pork sausage a thing of the past? I like these! Service was great. Our waitress was really sweet and the bussers were so efficient. Teas and waters got refilled, plates got taken away. The counter guy at the bakery was great too. Parking on Clark was reasonably easy at 11:30am on a Tuesday. Not sure about the weekend. I spied their Sunday brunch menu on the way out and even though I absolutely despise crowds, I would be willing to fist fight them for a table so I can get my hands on some more bliss cakes and the comfort brunch plate.",0.9861,0.788,0.143,0.069,0.5821912504839334
2009-11-14,5.0,"If there is always a wait at a restaurant, chances are the food is pretty good.  M. Henry is no exception.  I've yet to have been to this brunch mecca and not gladly waited with dozens of other eager patrons for an impending food coma.  Luckily, the turnover is fast and typically we've waited no longer than 20 minutes for a table.   Once you're seated by the friendly waitstaff, you then have the privelage to peruse the menu.  With sweet and savory options, the brunch is thoroughly satisifying.  Fresh ingredients used to make cook-to-order delights is a running theme throughout this establishment.  The fluffy pancakes with seasonal berries and a vanilla-laced marscapone are only the beginning.  I highly recommend ""Fannie's Killer Fried Egg Sandwich"" which features applewood bacon and gorgonzola.  Also, a great dish to share is the dulce banana rumba french toast with golden raisins and pecans.  They don't serve alcohol but BYOB is allowed and with a liquor store one block away a bottle of bubbly together with the delicious fresh-squeezed OJ from M. Henry makes for mimosas that complement the brunch fantastically. I highly recommend M.

2009-11-10,2.0,"For all the hype, this place sucks. My mom was in town, so my boyfriend and i took her here. It was also our first time. After hearing amazing things from my brother about this place i was super-duper, duper excite!. Oh, M Henry, how you have disappointed me. I placed our name in at the host stand, and they told me 30-45 min. I had no problem waiting 45 min. After all, if the food was as good as everyone has said, it would be well worth it. At around 35 minutes i went up to the host stand just to check to see if we had been called (because we were standing on the other side of the street) and around how much longer we would have to wait. I wasn't trying to be a bitch or anything, but the host-man sure seemed to think so. He told me that i was ""quoted up to 45 minutes, so you still have 10 more minutes to wait."" Touche, host man. I get it, i came up before our quoted time was up, my bad. So i let 30 more minutes go by. I figure, its a nice day and im sure a lot of other people are getting out of the house. I go back up to check, mind you this is after an hour and 15 minutes of waiting. I politely(ok, maybe not completely politely but im freaking hungry!) ask him about our table, and he somehow turns this around to be my fault. He says that ""Its' a busy day, and we cant know when customers are going to leave. So be patient."" My jaw literally dropped. So its MY fault you're an idiot and cant take approximations? Oh, I'm so sorry host-man, i didn't realize when you said 45 minutes you meant an hour and a half. What kind of watch do you have? Because i would LOVE to get one so i can tell my boss I'll have a project done by the end of the day, and turn it in next week. 15 minutes later, we were seated. Bringing the total to 1 hr, 30 min. The hosts told me they appreciated my ""patience"". Patience my ass. Here's an idea M Henry: Get new hosts who can keep track of time and aren't rude a-holes. Food was mediocre. The only reason they're getting 2 stars is because of presentation and price. I've had better eggs. The fruit was fresh and looked great. It was around $35 for 3 of us, which is usually what it is for just me and the boy. Since i was seated in the front of the restaurant, i cant comment on the decor too much. And this one also goes on the list of restaurants WITHOUT grape jelly. So i say again, WTF? I will NOT be back to this place until Mr. Henry gets a new host-man instead of the""I'm a hipster, so i'm too cool to care about you,"" rude, skinny, short one.",0.9253,0.815,0.103,0.082,0.5155603655603656

Wow.  Who would have thought gorgonzola, thyme and tomatoes would make this guy?

It was almost as good as I remembered.  The only difference was that I think in the summer  tomatoes from the garden complemented the flavors better.

2009-09-25,5.0,"I heard about M.Henry just browsing Yelp looking for a new breakfast place. Oftentimes I've found that a restaurant might get a lot of hype that it doesn't necessarily deserve so I looked with a bit of skepticism even though the reviews were almost over-the-top positive. As I continued to browse I was surprised to see that when people's breakfast experiences didn't quite live up to expectation, many were mentioning M.Henry while reviewing other restaurants! I figured it must be worth a visit and that was absolutely the right decision. First of all, the interior of this unassuming Andersonville cafe is very charming and welcoming. The feeling is somewhat like a combination of simple southern hospitality meets provincial France. M.Henry is both a cafe and bakery, and I think they did a fantastic job with the layout, keeping the two aspects of their business separate. Since access to the cafe requires a short walk through the bakery, however, my wife and I were met with wonderful aromas which were instantly reassuring. Upon being seated in the very cute and simply-decorated cafe, a feeling of being relaxed and comfortable came instantly. The wait staff were so nice, kind and respectful and were easily able to detect when we were ready to order, needed a beverage refill or were ready for the check. Coffee was the start of the adventure, of course, and it was delicious-- flavourful and rich without being too strong or pretentious. I saw other folks ordering orange juice which appeared to be fresh squeezed (maybe next time!). My wife ordered the dulce banana rumba french toast which was so tasty and deliciously-sweet. I thought the combination of flavours used was just right so that it wasn't overwhelming or confusing. It was easy to know exactly what's in it and that's one of the things that makes a nice breakfast I think. It was also very appealing, visually, and just begged to be devoured (OK- no problem!). I ordered something from the specials menu-- peach & sour cherry bliss cakes. I don't know if I can say enough about this! ""Bliss"" is a perfect word for this because I really was blown away and I almost never say that about breakfast, even though it might be my favourite meal of the day. When the dish first came out, it looked so beautiful because of the skilled presentation. I thought, however, that it was going to be too sweet for me and I started to get a bit worried.... until I tasted it. The hotcakes were super-light and airy without lacking substance. A smooth, light and tasty marscapone cream trickled out from in between them. A touch of sweetness was added by homemade brown sugar granola and fresh currants. Then the combination of gently-cooked fresh peaches and sour cherries was so delicious that it was shocking and also added just the right amount of moisture. Because of all this, the hotcakes absolutely DID NOT need any syrup or butter. In fact, I think that would have ruined them (something else I normally would *never* say)! M.Henry did something else with this dish that I really appreciated-- on my plate was a garnish of sliced fresh pear. Late summer peaches and sour cherries together on the same plate with fresh pear? That's not only beautiful, but was a very nice, subtle celebration of the changing seasons. Well done! Side dishes of tender, juicy apple-maple chicken sausage and mildly spicy and snappy veggie sausage made our meal complete and well-rounded. Honestly I was amazed by M.Henry and I can now understand why fellow Chicagoans are raving about this place, especially considering you get all this and it comes with very reasonable, right-on-target bill at the end. I believe it's a bit difficult to show innovation and creativity when it comes to breakfast (unless you want to pay a fortune) simply because so much has been done already. These guys are very good at what they do, however, and they are all about freshness and great taste and texture. I was very impressed and will *definitely* be going back again. In my opinion this place has some of the finest breakfast offerings in the city. I don't see how anyone could be disappointed so please go! I want to go back now and check out the lunch menu! M.Henry gets my highest possible rating because of how it compares to the rest of the western-style breakfasts I've eaten all over the city. One thing that I wonder about, though-- today is Friday and it was pretty damn busy considering most people are supposed to be working. I'll bet the crowds on the weekends can be pretty intense.",0.9982,0.817,0.157,0.026,0.611032581453634

I wish I had a charming-sugar person who likes to eat out as much as me to take me to M. Henry every day so I can try it all.",0.9975,0.745,0.223,0.032,0.5697916666666666

I love sweet, but often feel like I need MORE to get me energized than a few pancakes. So we went a little crazy and ordered a bunch of stuff. We both had the berry bliss cakes. Sweet and delicious. The cream is a great addition and without it, these cakes would be just 'eh'. I found our particular batch of cakes to be somewhat dry. But with all the cream and berries, they were really just yummy! The crunchy oats on top add a lot, too. I was FULL after them but I kept going... We also ordered a Latina Omelet. I was not impressed! I'm starting to think it's getting harder and harder to impress me because I cook all the time and usually love my own creations. I found the omelet to be dry- lacking cheese. My main problem with it was that were was SO much going on!! I mean an omelet is a delicate item, so when you throw in basically every single herb it really mottles the nice taste of the eggs. I hate sage mixed into Mexican inspired dishes, it was reminds me of savory Thanksgiving dinner not bean, corn and cilantro dishes.  The potatoes were dried out, yuck.  Just based on the sweet items they have- pancakes and waffles, I'd go back for a nice breakfast. Price is right and the place definitely slows down during the week so I can hear what I am saying! Overall, I think M Henry has a good thing going on but it's mostly just trendy...And maybe I just keep going on when the cooks are feeling tired and uninspired.",0.9964,0.711,0.236,0.053,0.5094267139479904

My friend and I got to M Henry about 9:30 on a Sunday and put our names in.  We were told there would be a 10 to 15 minute wait so we opted to head outside.  The waiting area is really cramped - I'd imagine at busier times and during the winter it could get really uncomfortable.  We waited about the promised 10 minutes before being seated. I ordered the fried egg sandwich and substituted the fruit cup for the potatoes on the side.  You wouldn't expect there would be all that much you could do to make a fried egg sandwich exceptional, but you'd be wrong.  I'm not sure quite what it is, but the flavors and textures all balanced perfectly.  My fruit cup was also really generous and packed with more than just your standard honeydew and grapes.  My friend had the home comfort brunch plate with eggs, butternut squash and applewood bacon crepe, and cranberry cognac chicken sausage.  He reported the eggs and crepe were both good, but I insisted on sampling the chicken sausage myself.   oh.my .god.  It was amazing.  I spent the rest of the day dreaming of cranberry cognac chicken sausage and plotting ways to get more.  It doesn't look as though that's an option as a side on the menu, but do whatever you have to to sweet talk your server into getting you some.  It was hands down my favorite part of either of our meals. There were a few negatives to M Henry, sadly.  It's really, really loud in the dining room.  I think that's simply because it's pretty well packed (though I suspect their cutesy glass window panes make the noise even worse).  Our table was tilted sharply to one side, so much so that I was afraid we were going to lose glasses or plates off the edge.  And though I appreciate that it's organic, I wasn't a fan of the coffee served. M Henry ran us just shy of $40 after tax and tip for two breakfasts, the substituted fruit, a small orange juice and two coffees, so it's definitely not cheap but it's well worth it.  After years of staunchly refusing to set foot in M Henry, I now can't wait to go back.",0.9935,0.796,0.143,0.061,0.5375360750360749
2009-08-26,4.0,"Adorable space; awesome service; solid, but slightly disappointing food. My book/brunch club met here this month to discuss our most recent read (Julie & Julia) and get our brunch on. Normally, we meet early, 10ish, but decided to try to come closer to closing, 1:30ish, since there were 9 of us. Maybe it was a fluke, but meeting later definitely worked in our favor, we only had to wait 10 minutes for a table. Our group was escorted to a table out back, on the way there I got a quick glance at the interior. Upon entering there's a cute little area with a coffee bar/bakery case and some small tables. There were a few larger dining areas off to the side with antique windows hung from the ceiling to create a sectioning effect (v. cool). The window theme extends onto the back patio, which has a large, retractable awning covering 2/3 of the large patio. The patio has tables of various sizes and those not under the awning have umbrellas. When we got too hot the busboy tilted our umbrella to better block the sun and moved another empty table closer to give us a little more shade; no worrying about sunburnt necks while dining. Our table got a bunch of different menu items and presentation-wise everything looked amazing. However, many people, myself included, were satisfied, but not gaga over their meals. My friend who raves about the mango and sour cherry blisscakes, was a bit disappointed in the black bean cakes she decided to try. I ordered the simply hotcakes with the fresh fruit and creme anglaise (on the side for Ms. Picky) and a side of breakfast potatoes. I was a bit disappointed with my food, I found the pancakes to be fluffy, yet dry, but the fruit and creme were fresh and quite amazing. The potatoes didn't do it for me, I found them to be quite bland. Service was excellent, someone was always coming by to check on us and refresh the various beverages at the table. When our check came out nothing was itemized, each plate simply said food, beverage or side making it hard to determine who owed what. When we requested a menu to sort it out our server graciously wrote the dishes next to each entry on the receipt for us.

I am not sure if she was ignoring me or just didn't hear me, the latter of which I find hard to believe as I repeated myself at least 3 times. I was seated on the patio, which is beautiful btw. My friend arrived, and our meal began with some awesome Iced tea. I went back and forth between the fried egg sandwich and the breakfast burrito on the specials. My dining mate, and M. Henry regular suggested I try the breakfast burrito as the sandwich was fairly small....hmmm size is definitely not the reason to go with the burrito. It was kinda tasty but honestly pretty bland (I had to add hot sauce) and the size left much to be desired. Especially for over 9 dollars! The accompanying potatoes were bland and chewy, it seemed they had been sitting for quite some time before being brought out. Also, does this place advertise at local daycares? More tables than not had very young children at them. This wasn't really an issue until two little snot nosed diners decided that our table would be a great place to play, their parents were oblivious to this and I actually had to get up and walk across the patio to where they were seated to inform them that this was a restaurant and their children were using out table as a playground. Now I know this isn't the restaurants fault per-say, but it is Unacceptable! All in all I really wanted to like, no love this place, and I left feeling ripped off, hungry, and overall disappointed.

We came here for brunch and my first impression of the restaurant is that it was really fucking adorable. The pastry case was filled with tiny little pastries. There were flowers and benches and windows hanging from the ceiling to separate the booths. Although it was prime brunch time, it was only a 10 - 15 minute wait, and our food came out promptly. And my sandwich was faaaaantastic. I got the fried egg sandwich because I am physically incapable of resisting anything with an over-medium fried egg on the top, especially if that anything also involves gorgonzola cheese, fantastically fresh tomatoes, thinly cut sourdough boule that nevertheless held up to that drippy yolk very well, and chunks of spicy potatoes studded with peppers and fried onions and scallions... I would eat this every morning if I could. Didn't hurt that the coffee was great either, and the scrambled eggs and bean cakes that my dining partners got also looked delicious.

2009-08-10,5.0,"Blog for pics in context. Arriving shortly after 9:30am we found the place bustling and busy - but only a 20 minute wait - reportedy - Taking our seats at a small back table in m.henry after only a 12 minute wait I was instantly reminded of Over Easy in decoration and Griddle Café in efficient hustle/bustle.  Waiters, plates, and patrons everywhere our friendly server stopped by to get drink orders - coffee, tea, oj, oj.  Within minutes he returned with our beverages and was ready for orders. Arriving first, a cinnamon roll - shared by the table and ever so fluffy, albeit somewhat bland compared to the stellar version at Yolk.  While appropriately cinnamony, the overall essence of butter was lacking and the frosting was somewhat too sweet.  While certainly not bad or grainy/low quality like Cinnabon, it wasn't Yolk's.   The second arrival was essentially the reason we came in the first place, the bread pudding.  Thick cut brioche, milky custard, blackberry, peaches, raspberry - M. henry calls it 'amazing' and I can't say I disagree too much.  Sharing this around amongst 4 people the helpings were still quite ample.  Having had only a few versions similar to this selection I can't say it was the ""best"" I've ever had, but it is undoubtedly a great representation with the heavy notes of butter, cream, and egg custard coming through beneath the wonderful fruits. Arriving soon, the main events - first for myself the Cinnamon Raisin French Toast with Peaches, Raspberries, Cream suggested by our server.  Featuring house made and THICK-CUT cinnamon raisin bread that would've been awesome on its own and absolutely loaded with fresh sweetened cream, incredibly plump and flavorful berries, plus a crunchy granola with accents of apple and cinnamon - this blew the bread pudding out of the water.  Crispy on the outside yet pillowy and fluffy on the inside the bread actually stood up well to the cream throughout the indulgence - though admittedly this didn't last long. The second dish, again ordered by my mother because she didn't want something ""too sweet.""  Bacon wrapped baked eggs with polenta & mixed field greens - well, I admit I like bacon, baked eggs, and especially polenta - and this was really good.  While I personally would've preferred the yolks a little runny, that would not have been ideal for my mother and as such this dish was very much a crowd pleaser with its rustic feel presented in a totally unique way - essentially a bacon cone filled with the two organic eggs and atop a creamy polenta mash.  Topping the salad, to note, was a wonderfully tart fig vinaigrette that m.henry should sell or publish the recipe too - it worked really well with the savory bacon tinged dish. Back to the sweet stuff with my aunt - Heavenly Four Berry Hotcakes - Raspberry, Strawberry, Blackberry, Blueberry.  M.henry refers to their pancakes as ""blisscakes"" and I can't really say that description is too far off.  Similar in texture to Dennis Leary's absolutely mind-blowing souffled strawberry pancake at Canteen these cakes were wonderfully light and fluffy and then topped with more fluffiness in the form of powdered sugar and a thick and airy strawberry cream sauce. The final dish, ordered by my sister, may have been the best of the bunch.  Key lime & apricot brioche french toast - quite honestly, you have to taste it to appreciate it, but suffice it to say this was better than any Key Lime pie I've ever tasted and I think a lot of that was due to the complimentary flavor of the Apricot, but also to manner in which the buttery and sweet brioche interplayed with the creamy and nearly panna cotta thick lime cream - the apricot reduction didn't hurt either.  Like the cinnamon bread, I imagine this bread is only modestly presoaked and then cooked on a very hot griddle as the interior was still bready while the outside was flawlessly ""French toast crisp."" High end ingredients, wonderful preparations, a staff with great suggestions, and a really cool little setup with good prices - I really can't ask for too much more than that.  Not as childishly decadent as Bongo Room yet every single dish hit it out of the park.  A much longer wait here than Yolk or Over Easy, but to be fair I'd wait 3x as long at M.Henry than either.  When it was all said and done we walked out of M. Henry realizing exactly what all the hype is about - ""Chow for Now"" is their slogan, but this Chow will easily withstand the test of time.  Free parking, another HUGE plus in Chicago.",0.9994,0.792,0.194,0.015,0.5371201814058956
2009-08-09,5.0,"I am surprised that it has taken me this long to write my review for M Henry.   Maybe because I do not want to let the secret out and keep the wait nice and short on the weekends (yea right)!  The one letdown for me is that there is always a decent wait on the weekends.  If you get there at 8 with two people, you may be able to sneak in, but after that even just two will people will wait for half an hour.  For some reason, they have designed seating to accommodate so many more tables of two than tables of four.  One of my first times coming here, I brought two friends and we waited for over an hour until a 4-top table opened up around 11 am.  Now I know better. So to summarize: come with two people or be prepared to wait for a long time.  Now that the weather is better it is less of a concern.  You can get coffee/cappuccino while you wait too, which is nice.  That brings us me to the food, which is incredible. To call this restaurant the best place on the north side to get breakfast would be a special kind of understatement.  After eating here, it is hard not to wonder why every other restaurant that serves breakfast cannot emulate this food. Sunday brunch is the best day to go, because they essentially double the available treats on the menu; other days they have a breakfast and a lunch menu.  Whether I am in the mood for sweet or savory, I know that anything I order will be a creative concept with prefect preparation.  Aside from how great the food actually is, there is great value to never getting your meal come out over/under cooked or in some other way undesirable.   If that sounds like nitpicking, think about a time when you ordered French Toast somewhere, only to have it come out tough and chewy, unwilling to absorb the sauce that is served with it.  This even happens at upscale breakfast restaurants on occasion.  Compare that to the Raspberry Rhubarb French Toast I had last week, with vanilla creme sauce and brown sugar glazed oats.  The bread was perfectly cooked, with a great balance of fruit flavor and rhubarb, and the oats on top were a great touch.  The egg sandwich is not your run-of-the-mill bagel with scrambled eggs and sausage.  Their version involves their fresh-baked sourdough break, over medium eggs, Gorgonzola, applewood smoked bacon, and plum tomatoes.  Obviously, this is a great gourmet version of a classic. While the bread pudding is arguably the best item on the menu (sometimes I cheat and order something else, only to take a bread pudding to reheat the next day), the egg sandwich, blackberry bliss cakes, and ever-changing French toast offerings are my favorites.   I really cannot say enough good things about M Henry.  I can look back at my life and identify the first time I ate here as a life-changing experience.",0.9983,0.789,0.179,0.032,0.49318783068783073

Henry is my favorite breakfast spot in the city.  I moved to the south loop and I still make the trek up here to have breakfast.  The ingredients they use are fresh and most of the time organic. You can really taste it in the food.  It also tastes like the dishes are made with love and care.  My favorite dish is the blackberry bliss cakes.  And they are what they claim to be-blissful.  The berries are always so ripe and juicy.  Lunch is stellar as well, the veggie dagwood is awesome (and I am not even a veggie).   In addition to the great food, the service is very good.  The waitstaff is always very friendly and accommodating.  They truly understand what good customer service means.   The decor is great-I have always had an obsession with old windows and mirrors so eating here is like coming home.   The only downside is that the wait can be grueling.  But if you come on a weekday it is not as bad.  Although sometime you have to go on a Sunday just to have their brunch.  They make the best bread pudding ever.   Once when I first started going here, like 5 or 6 years ago, they were still working out the kinks of the dishes and I got some potatoes in my bread pudding.  Well, they looked like peaches and I didn't even notice the first one because it was soaked in peachy goodness.  When we pointed it out to the waitress, more to see what they were and have a good laugh about how we just ate them all anyway, she apologized and took the entire dish off our bill!

2009-05-09,3.0,"Again, I may not go to church every Sunday (or ever), but I never skip on brunch.  If you tell me about a brunch place, I will go and try it at least once, or twice, or I may just become that person who walks through the door and the staff recognizes, but that's not this place. Let me start by saying that had I reviewed this place two years ago, I probably would have give it 5 stars.  The problem is, it became a celebrity, and all of a sudden it stopped wearing a hippie shirt and started wearing designer. So maybe I'll start with the good stuff, because I don't want to give the impression that you should never eat here.  The food is fantastic!  When you get your food you always hesitate for just a moment before you touch it, because it's like a piece of art.  I have wanted to take a picture of every dish I ever ordered here.  And if you think it's just looks but no personality, you'll be surprised, because the food tastes delicious.  I can't even start to list what is good here, because I'd probably list everything on the menu.  But make sure if you go there in the fall you get at least once something with the flavor of the season, e.g., pumpkin pancakes, or something like that. Now that the good stuff is out of the way, let me dive into the not-so-good stuff.  Once you're seated, after around an hour wait, yep, sometimes it's an HOUR during weekend brunch time, the staff is nice and polite.  But this is one of those places that drive me crazy, because they won't seat you until EVERYONE is there.  If there are 10 of you and you're waiting on one person, they won't seat you.  Drives me up the wall and away.  Then last time, we put our name down for 6 people, but we failed to mention we had a baby with us too, and they freaked.  Literally, FREAKED.  We were told in a very stern tone: ""a baby IS a person.""  Then we had to wait another 20 minutes.  Absolutely ridiculous! Last, but certainly not least, while Andersonville is one of my favorite neighborhoods because of the eclectic population, somehow this place attracts the most yuppie pretentious crowd in the neighborhood.  They're not so bad when diluted among the normal crowd, but they seem to come in a higher concentration here, which can be a little bothersome. If you can put up with this ""bad"" stuff and the long wait, then the food is just fantastic.",0.9873,0.8,0.131,0.069,0.6067049808429119

My only issue with M.Henry's is two-fold: the Fannie's Killer Fried Egg Sandwich and the Banana Rumba French Toast.  Those two dishes are simply incredible and subsequently it is really difficult to select anything else from the menu.  It's kind of a problem.  One is sweet, one is savory.  So pretty much no matter what mood you're in, you will likely see your eyes repeatedly glancing at those two options on the menu.   Sure, the staff seems a bit hurried on the weekends, but I remember what it is like being a waiter - it's hard not to be when you have that many tables CONSTANTLY filled with people.  Overall I've found them to be very friendly and the owner is also very personable.",0.9321,0.81,0.137,0.054,0.6468253968253969

Judging by the steady crowd, this seems true for much of the neighborhood  The French country décor - pale yellow walls, beadboard, fresh flowers and plants - creates a relaxing atmosphere as the waiting masses sip free coffee in the entry way and servers move between the closely set tables. Water pitchers in deep reds, French blues, and saturated greens line shelves and walls.  The Florentine crab cake benedict was delicious - the eggs were gently and perfectly poached, and the crab cakes, topped with shrimp, were crisp without being greasy. The crusty brioche base stood up flawlessly to the sautéed spinach and eggs.  My friend had the spinach, onion, and chevre omelet with house potatoes. The portion was so generous that she couldn't finish her meal. The house potatoes were amazing - the rosemary and red pepper flavors were complimentary without one dominating the other.  Service was quick and calm, even in the midst of the Sunday brunch rush. Our waiter had his share of tables, but never let a coffee cup or a glass go unfilled and was happy to adjust my order so the hollandaise was on the side.

We were told that the wait was about 50 minutes, and we waited for about 30. This was not terribly surprising because it was...y,know, Valentine's Day. However, we did get there at the later end of things. So by the time we were finally seated, we were one of the last groups in the waiting area, and while we took our seats, the amount of diners thinned out considerably. Which is why I was a little sad that the wait for pancakes and breakfast potatoes was as long as it was. There weren't a ton of people in the dining room when we ordered, and in the time we were waiting for our food, more than half the seated tables got up and left. So we hung out for about 40 minutes, waiting on pancakes.. But, it was also a holiday, and restaurants tend to implode a little on holidays and I get that, but there didn't seem to be a legit reason for the wait. Anyway. We both ordered the ""blisscakes"" - he got blackberry, and I got raspberry/peach. And frankly, I liked his better. The tartness of the blackberries went really really really well with the vanilla marscapone cream - better than my raspberries and peaches did (mine was still awesome, I just wish we'd swapped plates midway through). But the pièce de résistance were the breakfast potatoes. Sweet merciful crap they were so fucking good. Potatoes + Onions + A little bit of red pepper + rosemary + I don't know what else = AMAZING.

(usually comes with potatoes), a bottomless coffee (I always get my money's worth out of those! ha!)...and my dining companion the Latina omelette with fruit. Everything was fresh, well served/portioned...and quite delicious.  Coffee refills: Hot and plenty. Good sturdy mug (I not only despise paper, but flimsy mugs as well. A thick rimmed mug is heaven).

Ultimately, a dining out experience - to me - has to be a combination of really good food and really good service.  Since I believe managing how long it takes to get people into a restaurant is part of good service, and since many people like to go out in larger groups for weekend dining, I think it would behoove the folks at M Henry to figure out how to manage larger party reservations so as not to have 50 people crammed into their relatively small waiting area.  It would also be nice to have a smiling server who acknowledges that you've been waiting since Tuesday to be seated for Sunday brunch and seems to care about the service provided.

I went out and had one great workout. First phase was to prepare my body for the onslaught of not so healthy but rather yummy food it was about to ingest. The next phase was to avoid the long wait by getting there around an hour before close. As planned, I got seated right away and had a very good cup of coffee in minutes. The last phase became the most difficult as choosing between sweet and savory is always a battle for me. I've been here before so I know both options are great but watching lots of sweet options head for other tables gave me the sense of joining this bandwagon ... I went with Mango-Blueberry bliss cakes. Bliss was a well chosen word for these bad boys! Holy shiznit these cakes were damn good. How good? I always to a fault need syrup yet not this day. There were enough fruit and creme to go around that I even had some left over.  So on this trip to M Henry, I went at a more optimal time for an easy experience which paid off.

2008-09-29,4.0,"After hearing my best friend go nuts about this place I decided to give it a try. I spent 10 years working for a restaurant so I'm going to be very picky...sorry! I can't help it. The ambiance was rocking at 9:30 on  Sunday. The staff was friendly and approachable.  The waiting list was not too bad. Although you guys might want to consider something for older folks and couples with kids waiting outside. Maybe benches.  Hey...! what about up-selling and offering a cup of coffee for people on that long wait list? Let's start that tab right away.  The bakery items all looked good and tasty unfortunately I was waiting for the waitress to offer them after my meal, instead of dropping the check as soon as the speedy buss boys picked up my plate. ( I told you I was going to be very picky)  The food was good. OK..It was actually above my expectations. Food is food and the more creative you get the better. This place does a good job at presentation and whomever thought about putting slices of mango on the dishes deserves a star in holywood..or...somewhere in Andersonville. But don't stop there. I was reading the menu and they like using local and fresh veggies/fruit. How about other fruits like Melon slices, grape fruit, peaches or star fruit? now you are going to send a more powerful message. The waitress took a bit long to get to my table and the food took even longer. That was understandable since the place was rocking.  I had the Huevos Borrachos and they were good. The description listed rice and beans and me being Latin though: ""Now that sounds like my kind of breakfast"" unfortunately the rice and beans are probably the idea of a non-Hispanic cook/chef because it was mostly rice and about 7 grains of beans. Make your job easier and tell the Mexican compadres in that kitchen to come up with a better rice and beans combo. The dish deserves it! The place is well decorate and the waitress was great for the most part. I was going to give the restaurant 3 stars but decided to go with 4 because the buss boys were right on top of things (water refills and coffee) and there was an older gentleman (maybe the owner) by the exit door acknowledging the guests as they left the place. Keep that up.  The prices are just where they need to be. But if they went up a dollar by next week, I would not complain. The portions and presentation would make up for it. I can't wait to go back and try the eggs benedict and the pudding. I have been reading some of the reviews and I hope I don't get disappointed. Please don't disappoint me!

M. Henry is one such place.  On the weekends (especially in summer), it's insane.  The waits are pretty ridiculous, and the only saving grace is the ability to order a coffee while you wait.  Of course, there is a reason why it's insane, and it's not because it's located in a trendy spot (it is located in a decidedly untrendy area of North Andersonville/Edgewater-ish).  The food is awesome.  Their omlette creations are fantastic.  Today I had a sun-dried tomato, asparagus, leek, spinach, and asiago omlette.  Amazing.  The breakfast potatoes rock, and their toast is just...better than other toast.  Their sweet things are great too; I would recommend the blisscakes. If you can, go here on a weekday.  It's quiet and they won't rush you out.  During prime weekend brunch hours, this is not a place to linger over coffee, which I tend to want to do at brunch.  The waitstaff will come to your table every minute to ask you if you want anything else.  I get the hint, there's a line out the door.  For that, I will take away one star.

Henry highlights: --One of the freshest, tastiest tuna sandwiches I've ever had; the use of dill is brilliant. --Their grilled cheese sandwich, with a plethora of topping choices and additions.  I have indulged myself more than once in a grilled cheese sandwhich with cheddar, goat cheese, avocado, and bacon.  I think I peed a little. --The chicken balsamic sandwich provides an excellent, well-balanced blend of savory flavors from all its ingredients; I usually don't order chicken sandwiches of any kind, but I will order this one again! --The veggie burger lives up to its claims of greatness, is flavorful and filling, and almost a little creepy how similar to real meat it is. --Sunny, cozy, and homey atmosphere, and I like the hanging windows that they use to help break up the room a little. --The service is overall really great, especially from the hard-working guys refilling your water (with fresh limes).  They are always on top of their game, and they go above and beyond by asking how everything is and engaging with you.  This is more than I can say for the servers a few times I've been there, when we've waited a long time to get served and have had less-than remarkable service.  I am a server myself, and so I have particularly high expecatations, but everything else about this place is so freakin' wonderful that I'm willing to let it slide. --The fact that they have a charming bakery/deli area when you first come in, where you can purchase a selection of their delectable sandwiches and deserts to take home with you! --Tasty hot cocoa.  Not the best I've ever had, but as a hot chocolate snob, I'll still give it high marks. --Last but not least, the Blisscakes!!!  I usually like my pancakes plain, with just butter and syrup, but these babies have converted me, and I have tried every incarnation of Blisscake with whatever combo of fruits and cremes they throw on/in them.  And, if I may say so, they are the best post-coital pancakes EVER!  ;)",0.9982,0.788,0.197,0.015,0.6004095238095237

2008-07-21,5.0,"When I lived in Humboldt Park I used to go to Bite, and I most assuredly thought it was the best breakfast/brunch joint out there, what with its fresh ingredients and limited supply -- you knew it had to be delicious.  But M Henry? It is simply the best breakfast/brunch joint in town, if not, well, anywhere.  It was early on a Sunday, and I was starving. Pleading to my Twitter friends as for what to eat, someone suggested M Henry, sure that I would love it. So I mapped it out, packed up my things, and headed off. I have to say it's in a convenient location -- right on Clark -- and having never been to Andersonville, I was shocked at what a happening little neighborhood it is.  When I got to the restaurant, I walked in the door and was convinced that it was just that little small room -- a bakery, counter, and maybe 10 tables. There were people waiting, and I anticipated a lengthy wait, what with this supposedly small space. But then the girl at the front said I could sit at the counter and took me into a whole other room that was bustling with noise and clanking silverware.  Plopping down at the counter, a nice older guy (the owner?) took my drink order, told me what was popular, took my order, and proceeded to deliver everything incredibly promptly. I'd ordered the Blackberry Bliss pancakes and the home fries, with an iced coffee.  The best word for the pancake breakfast? Divine. Utter bliss. Complete satisfaction. And, perhaps lastly, too much food! The home fries were okay, though I would almost have appreciated them more had they been less seasoned. I took leftover pancakes and potatoes with me, and ended up eating them as an afternoon snack while at a tea shop reading. The food was fresh, hot, and it just tasted like the kind of breakfast you'd get on a farm. It was also, to be honest, absolutely beautiful in composition.  The restaurant is obviously popular, and the aesthetic is great -- free-standing windows decorated on the glass and panes hang from the ceiling to divide booth and table areas to create separate eating spaces. It has sort of a rustic, artsy feel, which I think is great for a breakfast nook. I'm going to be going back here, probably every weekend until I leave. Why? Because I have to cram in all the times I might have gone here had I discovered it a lot sooner!",0.9975,0.791,0.187,0.022,0.5275037792894935

I've read about very long lines on the weekend, no reservations are accepted, so we decided to try it on a Tuesday for brunch at 11am, there were quite a few empty tables when we got there but it was pretty full when we left at 12:30pm. Our server was efficient and while not unpleasant, she wasn't very friendly either. The dulce banana rumba French toast ($8.25) is brioche french toast layered with warm bananas, rum and golden raisins, drizzled with creme caramel & toasted pecans. It was good but I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as the chocolate French toast tower or s'more pancakes at the Bongo Room. My friend ordered the blackberry bliss cakes ($8.25), hotcakes with blackberries and vanilla mascarpone cream, topped with a brown sugar & oat crust, it was better than my selection. We both finished our meals, something I've never been able to do at Bongo Room, the portion size is more reasonable here.  The website says it is BYOB and they are vegan friendly, they use locally produced and organic products when possible. Would it be worth a long wait on the weekend?  Not for me but it was a pleasant enough experience on a Tuesday mid morning.  Will I go back?  Maybe if I lived in the neighborhood but since it's a hike for me probably not.",0.9822,0.821,0.132,0.048,0.3933796296296296
2008-04-12,4.0,"M. Henry is rapidly becoming a favorite spot for brunch.  Only one vegan option on the breakfast menu, but it's easily the best tofu scramble in town.  The bake case is also relatively vegan friendly, when I've asked they usually have cookies and all their scones are veg, and there are one or two other dishes that can be adapted. There are several more options on the lunch menu, which becomes available at 11:00.  So far I've only had the pan-asian noodle bowl; it was good but I'll probably try something else next time I show up at lunchtime. Finally, I'm rather a fan of the atmosphere - decoration certainly wasn't this place's top priority, but it's attractively done up with interesting stained glass windows and old doors.  It's nice to be somewhere where you have a little elbow room and can enjoy your brunch in relative comfort, which is the thing that really pushes M Henry ahead of other brunch places that might be more veg-friendly.",0.9924,0.763,0.228,0.01,0.5329228243021346

Loved the potatoes. Bean cakes: savory, delicious, vegan. $26ish with coffee, including tip. ~ visit 2 Tilapia wrap very good. Compared to the equivalent dish at Selmarie, M Henry's has a spicier sauce on fish and it includes chinese mustard greens so be prepared for some heat. Kind of a hot mess when it bursts forth from the tortilla so maybe avoid on a first date. But really good. I espied the veggie burger, looks like tasty beefburger. Maybe next week. ~ Other patrons all looked vaguely familiar. Must be other yelpers. Cool extra: Both the New York Times and the New York Post are available.

Luckily the little cafe sells coffee and sweets to tide you over while you wait. The sour cherry crumb cake was fantastic.  Once we finally sat, we cracked open a bottle of bubbly (M. Henry is BYOB) and ordered a carafe of OJ for my hubby. If, like me, you detest pulp, you might want to bring your own juice as well. Their juice was a coagulated mess of pulp (which my husband enjoyed) and the server was fine with me using my own pristine OJ.  We shared one savory and one sweet entree, and my husband started with the black bean soup, which he said was the only average part of the meal.  All of the sweets, such as french toast and pancakes, are available in a half order. We splurged on a full order of the sweet potato panckaes but could have easily sufficed with half. The pancakes were awesome, filling and decadent. The 4 large pancakes were layered with a delicious pecan filling and a vanilla cream. No need for syrup, these were sweet and flavorful enough. We also had the baked eggs with polenta. Bacon encircles a ring of creamy polenta mixed with egg and baked through. It was excellent, as was the sundried tomato sausage we got the on the side.  From start to finish our server was great. She answered all of our questions and made some great suggestions. She also didn't mind when we lingered over our last mimosas for 15 minutes after we'd finished eating. 2 entrees, soup, and sausage ended up being $34 which is pretty cheap for a brunch of this quality.

2008-01-12,5.0,"Amazing brunch.  The fried egg sandwich, grilled up on Italian bread with blue cheese, tomato, and applewood-smoked bacon, is one of the great breakfast foods of all time.  And while I have a hard time not ordering that sandwich, I have on occasion, and have always been impressed.  The omelets are wonderful, stuffed with inventive ingredients (squash, anyone?), and the pancake/French toast options are similarly adventurous, but always hit the mark. My big hang-up about this place, as is my hang-up with many brunch spots (Orange, I'm talking to you), is that the weekend waits are interminable.  Get there after 10 a.m., and you can count on standing in the Lilliputian holding pen for at least an hour.  On a positive note, M. Henry has a very nice selection of pastries and other baked delights, as well as coffee and espresso, to make that wait just a little more tolerable.",0.9765,0.827,0.165,0.007,0.5948306595365418

I used to drive from Lakeview to go here and I continue to do so from my new place in Ukrainian Village.  I was there on Sunday for the fall harvest roasted root hash w/apple gouda sausage and eggs. This apple sausage was great and I'm usually not much of a sausage eater. The root hash was also impressive even though it contained the one vegetable I don't usually like - beets. Somehow, they were okay at M. Henry. You can never go wrong with any of the blisscakes (my all-time favorite pancakes) and the fried egg sandwich is amazing, as well. The quiches vary from good to ridiculous. There is also just something about their coffee. I am convinced that it has something to do with the mugs they use, but I'm not entirely sure yet.

I ordered the fried egg sandwich with gorgonzola cheese, tomatoes and bacon. My dish was good, but my husband's was better. The restaurant must of have had a mischievous energy or spirit in the place that day. There was a series of strange events. They forgot my bacon, my husband's extra order of apple chicken sausages.  But, then the table next to us got their hot coffee dumped down their back. That event started with the mother deciding that she didn't want her coffee at that moment and maybe not at all. So, the server attempted to take it away until the daughter stopped him for something. At that moment, a rushing busboy bumps into the server's arm. SPLASH! Shrieeekkkkkk.

Apparently going a bit later is the key to not have to wait. The first thing I noticed, as others have mentioned, was the smell. No, not a bad smell. It smelled divine! I'm not sure what it was but it smelled like some sort of herbs. Maybe it was fresh bread baking. Whatever it was it made me hungry! The second thing I noticed was the decor. It was soooo cute! I loved the rustic, yet bright and casual atmosphere. I felt right at home.  There were several things on the menu I wanted to try and it was really hard to pass up the soups and sandwiches, however I was there to try the breakfast. I finally decided upon the  french toast with berries & vanilla creme. I could describe it in detail but let me just say this....yum...now go look at the pic I posted and you will see why. I also ordered a side of their house potatoes and they were among the best I've ever had. The rosemary really makes them. The blend of spices is perfect. My friend had an omelette special. I can't remember exactly what it had in it other than asparagus but I do remember it was very good. It tasted sooo fresh. Next time I go I want to get one.

The service is great; very fast and still friendly. I have never had to wait more than 15 minutes but I might just be lucky with timing.  The eating areas are sort of cramped but not so terrible that you are bumping elbows with your neighboring table while you chow down. They designed the place to try and help that by putting up windows all over, which cuts the noise a bit but doesn't make you feel boxed in because you can see through the windows. Very cool idea! Because in the end, the more people you can fit into the eating area, the less the wait is for everyone else. So good thinking M Henry! Now for the food!! I love breakfast foods and I am a vegetarian so M Henry is heaven for my mouth! I have taken many different people with different tastes and they all really like what M Henry has to offer.  Some of my favorites: Fannie's Killer Fried Egg sandwich! Now I think I make a mean fried egg sandwich too but this one is extra mean, killer even. It comes with bacon on it but they were very sweet and let me sub it out for tempeh strips, no charge. I think the fresh thyme and gorgonzola really gives this sandwich the kick in the pants that make it the best egg sandwich I have had in a looong time. It comes with the house potatoes which are yummy yummy in my tummy! Real potatoes, red pepper and rosemary. Can't go wrong with that!  Jorge's black bean cakes & eggs! So good! The black bean cakes are a decent size and very beany. Well duh you might say! Why I say that is to really emphasize that they didn't mix in a lot of other things like rice etc. So you have to like black beans, really like them! And I do and my  husband did too. They had a nice kick to them and the chipotle sour cream on top of the cakes was wonderful! Like lick your plate wonderful. And ofcourse the cakes comes with two eggs and the house potatoes. Blackberry bliss cakes!! OH MY! Absolutely the best pancake I have ever put into my mouth. I cringe when Rachel Ray uses this word, but here I feel it it's truly fitting, It's Yum-o! Fluffy pancakes with blackberries everywhere and vanilla mascarpone cream! Seriously! And then topped with brown sugar and oats! M Henry says ""bliss such as this, needs to be shared"" and they are so right. I took the advice of a fellow yelper and every time we go everyone in our party splits the cakes as a dessert at the end of the meal. It's a perfect way to end the whole experience! You walk out floating on a pancake high!  Bottom line: M Henry is not to be missed! It's a great place to take out of towners and a great place to make regular visits.

The service: I've never had anything but super nice people and water glasses are always full. No mistakes. One server in particular is outstanding. She would go out of her way to help me decide and piece 1/2 orders together to get me a combo I loved! Loved that. When the check came, I noticed 1/2 order was 1/2 price of the full order, which isn't usually the case. Generally, a 1/2 order is like $1-2 less than a full order. They've done other nice things, like if you order something without some ingredient you don't like, they offer something else in place of it--even when they're swamped and I am sure would rather move to another table. How refreshing! The food: Different, abundant, veg-friendly, colorful. The ""bliss cakes"" be it mango or blackberry, are very good and you can get a half order.

2007-08-27,2.0,"Fueled by all the positive reviews, was excited to try this place on a friend's recommendation. The wait after noon on a Sunday was about half an hour for our party of three--not ideal, but not a surprise based on what I'd read. First thing we noticed when we stepped inside was the aroma, which was pretty much something like a pot of ramen noodles. Hey, I like ramen as much as the next Asian gal, but it seemed odd. Inside, m. henry is a lovely restaurant, sunny and cozy at the same time--perfect for a Sunday brunch. As we drooled over our menus, my cappuccino was an excellent start to what promised an enjoyable meal, despite the fact that they were out of two of i's favorites--breakfast  bread pudding and crab cakes benedict. I opted for the Benedict Greco, composed of asiago bread, spinach, asparagus, artichokes and fried prosciutto, along with the requisite poached egg and hollandaise. Sounded ambitious, but hey I like all those things, so why not? Halfway into the first benedict, it became clear that the ham was going to be a problem. Thickly sliced and quite salty, it was not only overbearing but difficult to manage. Though rather crisp, it was not brittle, but more jerky-like. So while its fellow components, including the soggy bread base, easily fell apart under my knife, I did find myself sawing away at the meat from time to time. A few more bites and my tongue was raw from the salt. As for the veggies, the spinach was plentiful, but I only found 1 nugget of artichoke and one 2-inch piece of asparagus.  I's sour cherry and peach pancakes looked lovely, served with fruit and a creme anglaise. But the cakes turned out to be quite dry, one turning into a wet, crumbly mess drenched with creme, the other a parched, raw-flour-tasting attempt. MOL's chilaquiles and rice shared a similar flavor--that of canned vegetable soup. Closer inspection of the rice revealed overcooked pieces of corn and peas. We also split a half-order (oink) of lemon-blueberry French toast. While I am not a fan of eggy French toast, this was too dry for me, almost egg-less. Blueberry puree was nice, but the lemon coulis, though bright and fresh-tasting, was a bit overpowering & caustic to my salt-raw tongue. I'd call this the ""best"" of what we ordered, save my yummy cappuccino. I really wanted to like this place too.",0.9966,0.782,0.18,0.039,0.504970214970215

Nonetheless, the long wait in the hot sun outside made the experience far from perfect.  If you go for brunch, expect to wait  quite a while.  We observed that if you got there at 2 pm, you might not have a wait at all (but you could hardly call it brunch at that point.)  I had the dulce de leche french toast, and it was more than a bit too sweet. It was tasty, though, and came with some nice fresh fruit (pear and fig) in addition to the bananas that were cooked in the sauce. My boyfriend's bliss cakes were fairly amazing. Not too sweet, in contast to my french toast, and the combination with fruit and mascarpone cheese is pretty inspired.These were a daily special, blueberry & mango bliss cakes, whereas the normal ones are with blackberries. Also,  this seems like a weird thing to notice, but my Earl Grey tea was especially good Earl Grey tea. It was from some fancy-ass tea company and you could actually really taste it.

A good idea for sure.  I went with my boyfriend for his birthday, we're both vegan, so we were really excited about the vegan epiphany.  The yuba initially was delicious, it's apparently a traditional asian food which comes from the top of soy milk when it's cooked.  Somewhat very salty.  The epiphany itself was really good, but quite salty, as well.  The service was good, she went and checked on a few things for us, like if the soy cheese was vegan, and it does have casein so it isn't vegan for anyone else who may be concerned.    Very nice place though all around.",0.9801,0.799,0.19,0.011,0.5424242424242425

2006-07-16,5.0,"Not everything about M Henry is 5 star, but enough about it is 4 star or better that it all works out. First, the food. Some of my favorites are only available for Sunday brunch, when I usually don't go, and this makes me sad. But there's plenty of good stuff cookin' the rest of the week. I like the Latina omelette, with black beans, tomatoes and cheese and topped with a chipotle pepper sauce. The pepper and egg sandwich is also good. As is everything, quite frankly. Applewood bacon or sausage is extra, unfortunately, but whatcha gonna do? The house potatoes are not hash browns, as Robert G points out, but they're still mighty tasty. If you want to make a pig of yourself, go for the blackberry Bliss Cakes (other flavors for brunch), which are pancakes with blackberry compote, sweet mascarpone cheese, and brown sugar and oat topping. There's a nice selection of salads and sandwiches for lunch, generally with a soup or two and some specials. The sandwiches are all good, but I usually go for the Sante Fe (grilled chicken with spinach, red pepper and goat cheese) or their take on grilled cheese (swiss and cheddar with your choice of add-ons). The main restaurant closes at 2:30, but new coffee shop/pantry next door is open later. Service is always friendly, if not as knowledgeable as I'd like. I've had servers have to go to check on ingredients, and one didn't know what teas they offered. But at least they will check, without complaint. Michael and Jorge, the owners, are sweet and always present. The design is cute as hell, with antique windows and doors serving as design elements and separating tables.

One of the nice things about M. Henry we both felt was the amount of food you got.  Definitely enough to fill you up but not overwhelming - you don't roll out of there like you do after eating the super-duper-size-this-is-why-all-americans-are-getting-fat special at IHOP. I also wanted to specifically mention the service - every time I've been in there everyone has been incredibly friendly, curteous, and attentive - they seem to actually like working there which is a pleasant change from some of the more snotty Lincoln Park type places where customers and waitstaff alike all seem miserable and put off.  And the decor as someone else mentioned is artsy, but not overbearing.
