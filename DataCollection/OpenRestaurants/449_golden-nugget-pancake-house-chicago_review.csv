2017-08-03,2.0,This place is over priced for what you get.  And when you waitress charges you the wrong price it can exacerbate that.  This chain needs to get a proper point of sale system.  They are operating 30 years behind the times. The decor is definitely dated and could use a thorough deep cleaning.   The food is standard breakfast and lunch fare.   Portions are are over the top.  I think the kids meals are expensive to begin with but they do not include drinks so you are adding a couple or three dollars for a milk. Not really good value here.,0.8155,0.859,0.107,0.035,0.48888888888888893

I don't know how or where it came from, but it was there and definitely not from me.

2016-11-18,3.0,"Golden Nugget - what can I say?  Nothing special and not the cheap.  I was kind of a captive audience as I am having my oil changed next door at Car X.  I was hungry  so what else is new and I really needed a cup of coffee  so it was convenient.  I should have taken a walk and tried somewhere else, but the forecast is calling for rain and I didn't want to stray too far as I don't have an umbrella  handy.  Hmmm even as I speak thunder and rain coming down. Anyway this wouldn't have been my first choice, but out of convenience here I am.  I'm still kind of surprised that they are still around as there really isn't much that got me excited on the menu.  I ordered a double trouble cheeseburger that comes (2) 1/3lb burgers  with a choice of cheese (it's better with cheddar) & Curley fries.  It's certainly a far cry from the Kuma burgers, Boba Burgers or Brgrbelly to name a few of the premium burger places.  (2) 1/3 lb burgers is a bit excessive even for me.  I ended up taking 1 of the patties out and eating it on the side as a burger w/2/3 lbs of meat gets a little unwieldy and a little to thick even for my big mouth .  The burger was over cooked and dry with no seasoning. The burger wasn't something I would come back for, but it served its purpose of satiating my hunger & I got my coffee which was not very good either, but I was in dire need of a caffeine fix. The service was pretty good.  The waitress was very nice and attentive.  She checked in several time to see if there was anything I needed, but the food is not very good.",-0.7496,0.834,0.073,0.093,0.5313220906078048
2016-10-31,5.0,"I have been going to Golden nugget, since I was a kid. My parents would bring us here for Sunday family breakfast at-least twice a month. I have many memories with my family here. I  continued to go even after my fathers passing, so now-- whenever I have a really bad day, I stop by and pick up a Malibu chicken dinner. Its nostalgic for me.  I have never had a bad experience at this location. Everyone is very friendly; from the servers to the manager. They greet you- the moment you walk in. -Two days ago, I had placed an order for pick up and the lady who took my order was very friendly. They already knew who I was as I walked in; my food was packed and ready for me. I made it home and realized that I was given the wrong food. I called and explained what I had received and the lady I spoke with apologized and offered to replace my meal if I could return. Unfortunately, I don't live that close and after the day I had, I wasn't looking to go back out and leave my home. She then, offered me to replace my meal the next time I had a chance to go back. She took my name and told me just to inform them when I placed my order about my situation and they had it noted at the counter. I wasn't expecting her offer but it made me glad that they were so nice and concerned that I didn't receive what I ordered.  So last night, I took them up on their offer and called to place an order. I explained my situation  and Nancy didn't even ask me my name, she knew it was me. When I arrived to pick up my order, my food was ready and Nancy apologized again. I tried to buy a chicken soup, so that I could leave her a tip, since I don't carry cash and wanted to add it to my credit card and Nancy told me it was okay, and apologized again.  I will return just for the service! I really like the food (they have big menu selection to choose from breakfast to dinner and everything in between- and its freshly made to order,) but the service is the best reason to return.  Thank you Nancy and The Golden Nugget staff, for the great customer service you provide.  I will definitely be back! *Also, the dinner specials are great; You get dinner, soup or salad, soft drink and your choice of dessert for $9.00. What a great deal!

It was on a Sunday and there was a wait.  All is good.  The chilaquiles were served with rice and beans. I furthered stereotypes and was happy doing so. Today I went on my way to the Secretary of State to get my license plate sticker.  Did you know that the SoS can and often does forget to mail you that sticker/registration renewal form?  I think it's to draw you into to their vacant facilities so the employees actually get to interact with the general populace. I woke up this morning and took a vitamin and immediately left, thinking I would eat when I got back from the SoS.  Well, the vitamin, ingested on an empty stomach, made me feel quite nauseous.  I thought about puking on my bitch neighbor's front door, but she'd probably make her children clean it off. So, I stopped at Golden Nugget.  It was quite empty.  I seated myself.  I chose a corner spot facing the restaurant giving me a master viewing angle for maximum reaction time and destructive capability, if the need arose.  I browsed the menu while Flo filled my coffee mug with better-than-711-but-only-half-as-good-as-my-french-pressed coffee.  The menu at this place is enormous.  Even though it was about 8:50 in the morning I was debating between a sandwich or breakfast.  My frugal self opted for the $4.99 breakfast special (M-F 24 hours).  It consisted of 2 eggs prepared in a manner of your choosing (scrambled, of course), 2 bacon or 2 sausage (bacon, please), hashbrowns, and 2 french toast wedges or 2 pancakes (pancakes, obviously).  It was a divine meal.  Plus, it settled the unhappiness in my stomach. My ONLY gripe about the place is that a cup of coffee is $1.99.  That means that my coffee was 40% of the cost of my entire meal!  A bit ridiculous in my opinion.    Regardless, Giada's supple curvy body is on the tele now, so I must leave you.

The second I wanted anything, the waitress would vanish into the back for ten minutes at a time.I still didn't have silverware after my food was delivered, and ended up getting up to get it myself from the coffee station by the register. The food itself was just plain bad. The hash browns were barely cooked, all limp and greasy. The first bite of sausage I took tasted so foul that I spat it out, fearing spoilage. The bacon looked old, and my mother's pancakes were a little underdone. The fried eggs were not cooked the way I wanted them, and were kind of rubbery. The toast however was ok.

2008-06-23,4.0,"I absolutely love the Nugg, pretty sure I'm on their list of weekend regulars.  I think my doctor prescribed it as a cure all for hangovers- a few eggs, toast and always a pancake on the side, with a cup of coffee.  Of all the breakfast joints in the area, I always find myself swimming back to the Nugg.  The service is one of my favorites in town, the women here know what they're doing, they aren't over smiley or friendly, rather down to business with serving you.  I think they've probably been serving their whole life and for as small as the bill is at the end of the meal, I probably tip them a higher percentage than anywhere else.   Their billboards never make sense or advertise a special, the parking lot tends to get pretty full on the weekends, but I can't fight the urge to magnetize towards the big yellow dive.",0.9117,0.876,0.113,0.011,0.45994708994708994
2008-05-08,4.0,"This is my 2nd favorite Golden Nugget. The service is good, not comparable to the service on Diversey. The food is pretty much the same, and the pancakes are prepared almost as well as Diversey's G-Nugg. The resturaunt is kinda tight, but you cant really complain when it's a pancake house.

2008-04-08,4.0,My husband and I always make it a point to come here for breakfast or brunch whenever we are off of work and driving around on a weekday.  The service is usually pretty fast and most of the time the waitresses are very attentive.  I'd say my last visit was the only time the waitress just seemed to busy to check up on us. The food is great and I've never had any issues w/ any orders I've placed. I do think the place could be a bit cleaner or maybe it's just the low key lighting?,0.7845,0.888,0.091,0.021,0.6516666666666666
2008-01-08,5.0,"my family and I have been going here for years. Probably like 15 years....first couple years when we were dating and my husband lived right down the block , and for the last 12 years that we moved into his childhood home and had a family in it.  Can't go wrong for breakfasts. By far the BEST foods on the menu are the pancakes and the french toast. I still can't find a restaurant beat Golden Nuggets Pancakes...they are the BEST. They also have grea choc. chip, or any other fruit faired pancakes as well. Waffles huge with lots of whipped cream. Egg dishes are big and good, and the mexican dishes like the ""tito bandito"" or guadalajara skillet are fabulous. My daughter (not so into traditional breakfast food) will order something ""mexican"" for breakfast all the time. It's the only way to get her to eat eggs. :::Shaking head:::: somewhere I went wrong on this kid::::: Friendly staff, there was even a time a waitress remembered that I alwasy ask for sliced tomatoes with my egg dish, when I order. I forgot to mention it, and at the end of ordering, she asked ""Do you want your sliced tomatoes, with your breakfast"". I was pleasently surprised that she remembered me, and my order. It's not like we live there, but do go there from time to time on weekends. A + for customer service. The manager (maybe owner, not sure) always askes how our breakfast was and give the kids blow pop suckers upon leaving.  Great place for breakfast! On weekends...it's packed...weekdays pretty full, but you can usually find a seat. It's all non smoking now, and they have different size tables and configurations to accomidate a larger family  or party very nicely.  I have been to a couple of their locations, and I don't think you can get the exact same eggs and pancakes at other locations. These cooks are the same cooks that have been around for awhile, and everything is always perfect. The only down side, is I HATE choosing between hashbrowns and toast or Pancakes. This isn't enough to take a star away, because the food is big, tastes great, and reasonably priced. But I wish they had better ""specials"". I found a new place that does this, so I teeter between breakfast food places according to my cravings for the day. :)  The establishment never gives the portrayal of being unclean or uninviting. I have always felt comfortable there and NEVER had a problem with food, service, or anything in the past 15 years.  Good thing about them, is they are always open, and they have decent lunch foods too. We went there once for dinner, and there food was good. Nothing to write home about, but satisfactory. Breakfast is more their specialty.",0.996,0.807,0.162,0.032,0.5592501837784858

2007-11-29,3.0,"Socio-economic barbs aside, this place pretty much delivers what you can ask for from a modestly priced diner: clean tables and food.  During peak times, the manager serves as an attentive host and the waitstaff is friendly at all times.  Once in a while attention wanes, but you get what you pay for, right?    It's pretty difficult to screw up breakfast food and I'm pretty sure a 'taco wrap' is a burrito, but I do like me some Chicken-fried Chicken or Pork Chops when I need something heavier.",0.9371,0.725,0.21,0.065,0.7978835978835979

2006-10-02,4.0,"It's time I face up to the truth--as much as I like to think I'm a slick city kitty, deep down I know I'm really just a hometown girl from Indiana who prefers waitresses who shoot the shit with me and call me hon  to high-styled, pretentious servers.  They certainly have their place in the culinary wonderland of this city, don't get me wrong--but sometimes, I just need a little taste of what feels like home. My husband and I stopped by Golden Nugget on Saturday morning, sat at the counter and had a relaxed breakfast amidst all the diner hustle and bustle.  Some biscuits and gravy, eggs and sausage and 2 cups of coffee later, we were sated and happy to pay a nice, small bill for our meals.  The food at Golden Nugget is nothing spectacular, but it's one of those great places where the servers aren't stingy with their smiles or the hot coffee...  I'd be content to sit there with the good ol' travel Scrabble, a cuppa joe and maybe a slice of their homemade pie.  Breakfasts are a must at Golden Nugget--and apparently, so are the club sandwiches, judging by the number of them coming from the kitchen... maybe I'll sample those the next time I need a down-home meal in the city.",0.9789,0.838,0.143,0.019,0.4950138026224982
