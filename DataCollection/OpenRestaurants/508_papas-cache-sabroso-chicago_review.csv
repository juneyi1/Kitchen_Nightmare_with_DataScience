2017-09-01,3.0,"3.5...Usually am generous with local family-run spots, but I just couldn't bump this up to a 4. What we expected to be a quick casual spot for dinner ended up being closer to two hours late Friday evening. My group of three was in the area and saw this place nearby. It was pretty busy when we arrived and we seated ourselves inside. The place seemed to be well staffed. We were brought out some bread promptly and then waters arrived some time after. One of the ladies took our order at a reasonable time. Here's where things stopped being okay. We noticed our order taking a long time, but we still didn't even bother them about it until way later, when it was getting ridiculous. They ensured us the first time, that it was up next...but nope, it was like another twenty minutes. All in all, pretty sure we waited about an hour for our three jibaritos. In this time, I noticed a man seated well after us got his food in 15-20 minutes...They were all nice in there, but an apology or some sort of reason would have helped. Luckily, their jibaritos were some of the best I have ever had. Their arroz con gandules was disappointing. At first, I thought they were just fine, but now looking back, they actually were not good...very bland and basic. Their rice and red beans were much better, and would opt for that next time. I would like to come back and try more items, but hopefully will have a better experience next time. The wait time for our food was just excessive. So far, I still prefer La Cocina Boricua de la Familia Galarza and Casa Yari, but Papa's Cache Sabroso's jibaritos sure are memorable.",0.9917,0.78,0.174,0.046,0.5139660493827161

And I love the owner he is very pleasant and funny man and so is his sister I forgot their name but they are pretty awesome . My husband and I live about 45 minutes away from this place . And it's worth the drive and the wait . The place is very small but full of love and good food.  So they are known for the rotisserie chicken called pollo chon. It's rotisserie chicken seasoned to taste like pork roast also known as lechón. It's delicious . Jibaritos are very good too . I love that garlicky taste on the fried green plantain that they use as bread . The portions are pretty big and prices are awesome. There's outside seating now that the weather is stilll nice . But the inside  will keep you warm in the winter since the place is very small . But enjoy the best rice con gandules also known as every Chicagoan refers to it as ""puertorican rice"". Arroz con gandules people . But it's ok when in chicago you do as the Chicagoans do .  Oh The service is great. And don't forget to bring a good cold beer , a modelo or corona will be a great choice with some good authentic puertorican food. Buen provecho mi gente !",0.9988,0.637,0.363,0.0,0.6843243243243244

The tostones were good but on the second day, they were fried too hard. The rice and beans were to perfection and the plantains were just what I needed. My friend did care for her chicken but she love their tacos and said they were ""on point."" The decor and size of this place is a little confusing to me. It's like the outdoor seating is bigger than the inside, which in Chicago we don't have perfect weather all-year round.  Another thing to make mention of is please be aware when you sit down to order your chicken, it will be like a 20-30 wait. The first time I went, it was 25 minutes and the second time it was 30 when they told me 20. I didn't complain because I knew my chicken was going to be fresh.  Overall, it's a nice little gem tucked away on a Main Street in Humboldt Park that serves succulent chicken and excellent customer service.

Besides the service that was really good, we were very disappointed in our food. The chicken was very dry, and the steak meat that was in the jibarito was also dry.  It was like we got leftover meat that had been sitting there.  I am Puerto Rican and I know what the steak meat should look like since I cook it often. I can tell you that the meat was left over from earlier.  We probably should have said something and we did not, because the waitress was so accommodating and nice. I just hope that this is read on their behalf that they consider not serving me that is dry or leftover.  I would not say that this place is reasonably price because a whole chicken dinner which includes rice only is $16.50.",0.8678,0.893,0.086,0.021,0.5836274509803921

We ordered steak jibarito with Spanish rice and the 1/2 chicken dinner. Everything was so well seasoned. The plantains added a different touch to the sandwich--they were crispy on top but starchy in the middle, slightly sweet and garlicky. The chicken was so tender, moist, and full of flavor! We also got yuca as a side for our chicken. I was expecting yuca fries so I was surprised when steamed yuca came out. It wasn't bad, just unexpected, but the texture of it was a little too gloopy. It wasn't anything the restaurant did wrong! I just realized I like fried Yuca more. :)  The restaurant is also BYOB and there's a little grocery/liquor store a block away!

2017-06-16,5.0,"In Chicago, Mexican restaurants are ubiquitous and Puerto Rican restaurants are rare. This is a casual Puerto Rican restaurant well worth the trip to this West Chicago neighborhood near Humboldt Park. The signature dish is a ""Jibarito"", a sandwich in which crunchy toasted plantains are used instead of a bun. We were told that this sandwich was created by the owners in Chicago so technically it's not something imported from the Island. Whatever the origins, it is excellent and comes in several varieties including chicken, steak, and vegetarian. The menu contains many other traditional Puerto Rican specialties primarily involving chicken, pork and steak. They do a big takeout trade, but our group was seated and the service was very friendly with a nice, local neighborhood feel.",0.9335,0.869,0.131,0.0,0.5078703703703703

The waitress that I had was rude and forgot to put my order in or something because after 20 minutes of sitting there with a one year old child who would need a nap soon, I still didn't have my food. When I got up to see what the hold up was, I saw my food sitting up there with the ticket on the plate leaning on the sandwich (which was alarming because it had the waitress who wrote the ticket's germs on it as she didn't have gloves on when taking my order, not to mention the ink on the paper). Granted, this was after waiting 20 minutes for my food, when people who came in after me already had their food.  When I told the waitress that I didn't have my food, she said she was about to serve it (right, my sandwich was sitting there the whole five minutes I stood at the counter waiting for someone's attention) and didn't even apologize. I told her to make it to go as the baby needed a nap so she proceeds to dump it along with the rice and beans I ordered into a styrofoam container and hands it to me in a bag with the beans leaking out of the styrofoam. I had to walk a mile and told her that I needed the beans in a sealed container and she looked at me like she had no idea what to do.  Overall, not a good experience.

Sometimes they take your money at the register, sometimes they tell you to sit down and you're forced to get back up in line after you're super full and have to stand for 10 minutes to pay your tab that you could have just paid the first time you were at the register.

I took this as a good sign. Our server was pretty cold and not personable, but we were really there to enjoy puerto rican food so that's what this review is based off of. To start, we tried the tostones. You get 12 for $3, which is awesome. They came out piping hot and were perfectly crisp, without being overly greasy. A great to start to the meal, and I highly recommend. We decided to try two entrees and share. We ordered the bistec en salsa (salsa roja) and the 1/2 chicken dinner. When our food arrived, everything looked great! With each entree you get a large helping of rice and a side salad. The portion was just fantastic. For $9 the amount of chicken you get it CRAZY. More than enough to feed two people. The serving size for the bistec was on the smaller size, but the meat was cooked very well and I loved the sautéed peppers and onions served with it. In the future, we'd order the bistec without the salsa because we didn't care for its flavor. The chicken was cooked just wonderfully. So juicy and fresh, with an excellent yet subtle blend of spices. The rice was also extremely tasty, and the salad so fresh and crisp! My only complaint: the chicken could have been a bit hotter. I'm kind of picky about this, but it's the only reason I didn't give a five start review. Overall, the food was absolutely excellent and we both really enjoyed our extremely reasonably priced huge meals!!! We will definitely be back. Just don't expect stellar service, come for the great food!",0.9983,0.703,0.266,0.032,0.6625414078674947

The entire order did not come out at once, I had to ask for my side order of plantains, and then i had to ask twice for garlic.

I didn't know what to expect, but I was very impressed by what I got.  My friends brought me here for my first experience and I'm happy they did. They ordered for me, which all good friends do when them know how to hook you. They ordered me the steak Jibarito which was just amazing.  It's a steak sandwich where they sub the bread for fried platens. So, I don't know that's it's any healthier, but honestly I didn't mind it. What I will tell you is that the restaurant is small and if the sidewalk seats aren't open, it maybe seats 30 people at most. Also, I'm almost certain that it's cash only, but many of these smaller Hispanic places are, so no surprise there. My one complaint was the slow to nonexistent service. I get that this isn't a McDonalds, but we had to ask for water, there were no refills, and she never came back after our food was delivered. I can appreciate that this is a small family run establishment, but even if the food is good, poor service will keep me away.

A jibarito is a unique sandwich with plantains instead of bread that was invented by Chicago's Puerto Rican community (can verify--my parents visited Puerto Rico and asked for jibaritos at every restaurant and found them nowhere). I used to hate plantains but this place converted me.

2016-06-30,1.0,"I have to start by saying the food here is delicious, usually. I would give them 4 stars but the service and attitude of the people who run this place is absolutely atrocious. The chicken was dried out and the gandules were flavorless this time. But that's not the worst part. Simple version, they lie to customers and overcharge you for super late food then blame their employees and hang up on you when you complain. I have ordered before through grubhub and everything was fine, the food was great. I really wanted to order from here again and grubhub kept telling me they weren't delivering to my area. So I called the restaurant and they told me they would check into that because it should deliver to my area but they could take my order over the phone. I asked how much delivery would be and the person on the phone ignored me and kept asking what I wanted while people in the background were yelling. I placed my order and before I could ask for the total or time they hung up on me. An hour and a half later I call the restaurant and ask where my food is. They basically blame the delivery driver and make some excuse about the orders being really far apart and say my food would be there in ten minutes. Here's where the BS starts. I placed my order at 7:42, the receipt said 8:27, I called the second time at 8:57, and didn't get my food until 9:15. I called to complain when I saw a scathing $10 delivery fee. That's 45 minutes to make my food, then 50 minutes to deliver when I only live a 15 minute drive away. Unacceptable. So I called the restaurant to complain. First they told me delivery should be $7, to which I had argued that their delivery fee is clearly $3 on every service they use. First they claimed that was grubhub's fee and not theirs, they don't set the delivery fee. Then they blamed the delivery driver for charging too much. Then they hung up on me. I called back and someone else answered the phone. I was told they would talk to the manager and call me back and she hung up on me, no one called. I absolutely can't believe someone would run a restaurant like this and treat customers like this. It's my fault for signing the receipt without checking the price (last time I trust a restaurant in Chicago) but when I asked for the fee and the total they should have told me ahead of time instead of hanging up on me. My order should not have taken 90 minutes to make and deliver.",0.5915,0.843,0.082,0.076,0.4845982142857143

2016-06-08,2.0,"My experience over the years with Papa's has varied from Great to Ugh get it together. I will say, I've tried a couple other jibaritos from other restaurants, and I was pretty sure this was the best around. Since I first began coming here, they've expanded to an outside patio that's covered, so that helps with the small cramped lack of tables inside. Unfortunately, that's were the improvements end. I just went last Friday evening, and they had one waitress. It wasn't as busy as it has been in the past and still, no one acknowledged us once we stepped in, and getting her attention was difficult. They used to give you delicious toasted bread while you waited, and now, it's raw bread with a thing of butter on the side, so that is a big bummer.  They took over 45 minutes to bring out our jibaritos with rice. We also ordered maduros, these never came out and even after we asked about them, they were never made. We had to ask for our drinks that we ordered once the food arrived. I felt so bad, there were cops sitting next to us that got there about the same time, and still had not been served even after eating our meal and paying (so over an hour later). Again, it wasn't packed, but I did notice a lot of pickups. They should really try to prioritize customers dining in or hire more cooks. Or at least give the customers a heads up that there will be a wait due to being shortstaffed, so that the customer can choose to dine in or go elsewhere.  Now the meal... The plantain was a lot narrower than I remember, and it was almost burned. The meat was very greasy and it wasn't up to the taste and quality I remembered from here. Everything on my plate, including the white rice and beans, was room temperature, so not sure how long it sat there before they remembered us. My husband ordered the arroz con gandules, and it also was just ok, not great like before. The  waitress dropped off our food and didn't acknowledge us, and one of the ladies working the register had to get her attention as my husband was waving the check to try and finish paying.

2016-01-03,5.0,"I've finally decided...hands down my favorite PR restaurant. From the rice to the tostones, I'm a raging fan. It's a nice location in the Humboldt Park hood and easy to find. You can smell the rotisserie chicken from their parking lot across the street. You better beware though, it smells that fantastic from the immense amount of garlic each is slathered with. If you're not careful, it can stay with you for the rest of the day. I always make a point of having a fizzy drink with my dinner; I'm convinced it helps. Most of the time it's my Caribbean favorites Kola Champagne or Coco Rico. They also offer ginger ale, root beer, Pepsi, and parcha (AKA passion fruit).  There are daily dinner specials but my favorite day at Papa's is Saturday. The one day a week lechon is awesome. It's easy to find this over salty, greasy, or dry in other places, but Papa knows pork. It's perfectly seasoned on its own, however Mama has a kick in the mouth green hot sauce that pairs wonderfully with the roast pig. The tostones are reliably good. Some other places don't change their oil enough or they half cook the plantain in advance. Papa seems to clean the fryer regularly and make the delicious twice fried platanos to order. Garlic makes a not so subtle appearance on these babies too!  Before I rave any more, I have to remind you that this is a mom and pop operation. They can easily run out of specials before they close. Sometimes that means you'll have a wait before you get your paws on the next batch of pollo chon. Sometimes that means you'll go without the lechon next Saturday. You can't rush the process.  Speaking of rush, I don't think I've been here when the place wasn't full. So be smart or be patient! It's easier getting a table during the summer since the outdoor enclosed patio doubles the seating. If you're logical you'll read that to mean you can sit down while you wait for real Puerto Rican grub. In all seasons, between diners and their busy delivery service, I highly recommend calling ahead for takeout service.

Preggo problems), I have finally shaken the desire for that crap and am back to desiring hot, home cooked food. While coming from the north side of the city, I was not looking forward to rattling through pots and pans to cook, while my begging dog claws at my ankles at 10 something at night. I sighed as I continued driving down Division Street. The options around in either direction didn't appeal to me at all - Burger King, McDonald's..... BARF!!!! As I passed under the big Puerto Rican flag, I immediately thought about how I stopped at about 3 PR food trucks through Humboldt Park a few days ago (don't judge me) and how good a jibarito would be. I then passed Papas. It was a sign from the plantain gods!!!! I pulled a uturn and stopped. It's a very small place that you would totally miss if you weren't looking for it. There's plenty of street parking though. The inside is pretty small but that does nothing to take away from the PR feel of the place as you smell the aromas of the island and gaze at all of the celebrity pics on the wall. I ordered my chicken jibarito and rice and beans. The place was packed and normally is, but that doesn't take away from their service. The taste - delicious! Plantains were perfectly cut for the sandwich. I hate when thick pieces are cut. It was fried to perfection and the garlic, olive oil, and seasoning blends were mouth watering. I wish I had more rice and beans as well. I devoured my food. They totally made a faithful patron out of me and my belly!

Arriving to get my food was no different. People that were behind me in line were allowed to cut in front of me, who all seemed like they were acquainted with the owners/workers there. One person cutting is OK, but three did it in the time I was there. Not cool.  When I did get to tell her why I was there, my food was already there waiting for me to pick it up. I ordered the Camarones en Salsa, and the other ordered Jibarito con Arroz. The Camarones was really lackluster and had about 5 shrimp in it. The price tag? A whopping 14.50! The Jibarito con Arroz was a bit too greasy for the other's liking. They do their rice well though. Another nice touch - they give you complimentary fried plaintains! A bit over-salted.

Tried other restaurants on Division and a couple long established spots near California with no success. Then came across Papa's and have been going since.  One major plus for me is no pork in the arroz con gandules or the beans. Can't eat due to medical condition and believe me, being Puerto Rican and not being able to eat pork or red meat was initially difficult. However, learned to live with it and haven't had either since 1992. The jibaritos, yuca with garlic olive oil, rotisserie chicken and arroz con gandules are the bomb!

But moving along i decided to give it another chance and came here because I read all the positive review of people mentioning on this location which in my final verdict i agree with them this place in indeed amazing.  Upon arriving I notice this place wasn't a really big location, but noticing the chicken in the chicken in the background roasting in the oven got me drooling. Was seated immediately given a small area, but at the moment it wasn't busy because it was after dinner hours. The waitress was on point in taking our orders even taught us something new of the difference between white and yellow cheese (which was shocking to learn the white cheese was american cheese and not yellow.. weird). What i order was the Jibarito con arroz (chicken cause i saw them roasting). First time ever trying it seemed like a a sandwich essentially. The patties used were flatten platens which gave it a very crispy taste and added texture to every bite and since the chicken was roasted to cook it was still juicy and like the meat ripped apart with each bite with such ease.

2015-04-14,4.0,"VIVIR MI VIDA...... Ay Papa's Cache is definitely sabroso y la comida (food) tiene mucho sabor. Ahaaw, so I actually heard the song, ""Vivir Mi Vida"" by Marc Anthony playing here. It took me away to a tropical oasis vibe, and I wanted to do a few salsa steps. Hey, I'm sure I would have gotten the glare-down ""WTF are you doin' look!"" There is a definite Barrio vibe here. Everyone, from Abuelas to Niños comes for the knockout kick-ass authentic Puerto Rican comida featuring several dishes dashingly presented, and others simply massive: Mofongo al pilon de bistec (savory shredded beef over mashed green plantains) and pernil con arroz y gandules (roasted pork shoulder with pigeon peas and rice) are big enough to split.  We love that this place is BYOW (bring your own whatever), and has a reasonable price-point. Over the years, we have been here over 12 times. I was shocked that I had not written a review for one of my favorite Puerto Rican restaurants (or if I want to change it up and get my freak-on with other PR joints I hit up La Plena or Juanita's). Papa's Cache has been my jam for the last several years. It's definitely a juicy gastronomic paradise if you are into this type of food. Papa's hace que mi vida valga (Papa's makes my life worth living)!  ;D If you enjoy Tostones (fried plantains that are NOT sweet) then try the Jibarito de bistec. The Jibarito contains generous flavorful tender steak meat and the tostones serve as the bread that holds it all together. These tostones have a crispy exterior and tender interior. Although deep-fried they are not greasy. The Jibarito (pronounced ""He-Bah-Ree-Tow"") is a Puerto Rican sandwich that is very popular here. Is it healthy? Hell no! It is loaded with tons of fat and calories. There is nothing healthy about a HE-BAH-REE-TOW!!!  If you eat these everyday you may end up with clogged arteries or high cholesterol for that matter. Hey, if you consider fried food healthy you better look up the fooken definition. The tostones are deep fried, but once in a great while I crave this type of food. Come to Papa's -- he satisfies me every single damn time! Papa's will satisfy you too (hey, I'm talkin' 'bout food here, not sex)! BTW, their house made ají is delectable, aromatic and a must-try. The flavor is spicy, unusual and complex, with overtones of black pepper and coriander kicking up the food flavor by several notches. I like their coffee -- it is robust but not bitter yet strong -- and reminds me of a strong Espresso (not ""EXpresso""). Some guy on Yelp Talk got bent out of shape, because some people spell it ""Expresso"" and not ""Espresso."" You say ""Tomato"" and I say ""Tomata"" ....Hey, who gives a flying fook...but I digress....oh yeah, back to the food. It is perfecto, sabroso y por la maceta! I see that we have a couple of ""Debbie Downer"" reviews here from people who have less than 10-reviews. Get over yourselves, and go have a can of beer! If you call in your order at 11 am and receive your comida at 1:15 pm, well this is about right, because Spanish people (and yeah, I am half-Latina) operate on a different time zone. If you calculate that time to West coast time (not Central time), then you received your comida on time! ;D My sister is married to a Puerto Rican guy. They met while in Graduate School, and his Mother, who is deceased, used to make the best Puerto Rican food I have ever, ever had. Every time I have eaten here it brings back memories of her delicious Puerto Rican comida. Damn, I miss her cooking! The service is non-effusive, so it receives 4-stars. This is not a fancy joint.

It was a date night with the hubs and I was WAAAY overdressed for this scene. Dinner was supposed to be elsewhere with valet and a bread crumb scraper, but work got in the way of reservations. So, where to go when it's a Fri night, we no longer have a reservation, every restaurant will be packed and all I've had all day is a handful of raw almonds? Fellow Yelper, Hugo B, told me months ago to try Papa's and it was bookmarked. Papa's it was! I could smell this place from across the street! YUM! A good sign because if it turned out to be bad, I'd never hear the end of it from the hubs. He'd make fun of me for a decade over it: ""Do you remember that time you dragged me to that dive in Humboldt Park??""   We ordered both the Chicken and the Steak Jibarito with rice and beans and split them between us. I've never eaten anything like it. We're both fairly healthy so eating a sandwich held together with fried plantains, was crazy stuff for both of us, but it was love at first bite. The meat was flavorful with a great texture; add in the lettuce, tomato, and white cheese.....  It's old and a little ...humble? A neighborhood joint where they seemed to know a good many of their patrons. I liked trying something different than our usual admittedly stuffy norm. Unpretentious. Unassuming. Just simple, good food without an ounce of pomp. If I could have had better napkins I would have been happier though. Those tiny 1-ply rectangles were just way too flimsy for the grease on my fingers. --Subsequently, that pencil skirt is now sitting at the dry cleaners. :-/ Our bill came at the end. Twenty-five bucks?!! Quite a bit lower than we originally anticipated for the night. But, it was also a welcome change. Off to a hotel with our phones turned off. I don't care if someone painted the couch with peanut butter again or the dog ran away. Whatever it is, it can wait. ;) Tip: Seat yourself if you're eating there.

So, all in all, a pretty good experience.  I will definitely go back and it's BYOB, so it could be nice to chill on their patio on Division and relax with some wine a good food.  I'd rather go for a weeknight date than a weekend to cut down on the busy-ness.",0.9967,0.75,0.206,0.044,0.611921648091861

We got the lechon, with the tostones, and they are to DIE for!!! They have some top secret garlic seasoning on the tostones (and yuca), that makes your breath blow your enemies away. I could eat that everyday!!!!! Their lechon definitely hit the spot, although I wish their portions were bigger, especially for hungry mungry people like us. I want to try their jibarito next time, it looks so good!!! For desert, we ordered the carrot cake and flan to go (bc remember we are gluttons but couldn't fit anything else). Flan was meh, but the cake was sweeeet!! Poor cake didn't make it a day in the fridge. And the owner and his sister (who was our server) were so nice! He came over to our table to welcome us! I can't wait to come back and eat the menu!!!",0.7738,0.805,0.119,0.076,0.49150326797385624
2014-03-17,4.0,"I would just like to start this review with: Everyone should try a jibarito. On a recent trip to Chicago my wife and I were looking for a place to have lunch. We like to try types of food we haven't had before and whenever we end up in a bigger city than where we live I immediately search for something new. Reading about Chicago, I noticed they have a large Puerto Rican community. I was immediately interested and began looking for places and foods to eat. I noticed that there was a sandwich available called a jibarito that used fried plantains instead of bread. I decided I had to try this sandwich and set out on picking a restaurant.  I picked Papa's Cache Sabroso and am so glad that I did. It's a little place that appears a bit run down on the inside and it was full so we had to wait a bit to be seated. When we sat down, I looked over the menu to find the jibarito. It is available with steak, chicken, or vegetarian option. I chose the steak jibarito and my wife chose the 2-piece dark rotisserie chicken.  They both came with rice and beans. The jibarito was so good. The simplicity of just steak, lettuce, tomato, cheese, and some sauce sandwiched between two starchy plantains was perfect. It made me want to eat every sandwich with plantains instead of bread. My wife's chicken was also perfectly roasted. I tried a piece of it and loved the perfectly spiced flavor and she was very happy with it. We will definitely be eating here again on future trips to Chicago.",0.9901,0.859,0.141,0.0,0.6134357864357863

2014-03-14,5.0,"So we stopped in here on at Tuesday cause I needed my jibartio fix before lent!  We originally planned on stopping at another place but because of the timing it was close, and I'm really happy it turned out that way.  A pond walking in, you will notice the place is small only maybe 7 tables or so. Then you will notice the menu is small.. only a handful of items (no traditional fried foods you would see a lot of places like this). But it was okay, because I was there for my steak jibartio and some tosones.  Now, if your taken back by the small menu and small place.. DON'T BE. Because they have mastered this smaller menu! The food was amazing even the chicken half and pork chops. Most of all though was the service. The women serving us, im going to assume is maybe an owner or family member of the owner cause she was so sweet and made you feel like you where in her home eating. Even though the places was super busy and the phone was non-stop she was so attentive and helpful!  You can't go wrong with good food and good service!  Helpful Tips: - In the summer they have a patio.. so def check it out then. - While there, people where calling for delivery! Thats a nice touch you don't see often with these places!  - Careful with parking! There is a sign on their door about where to park legally so make sure to check that if you don't find street parking in front.",0.9961,0.787,0.203,0.01,0.6415637860082305

2014-02-28,4.0,"I was in the area after getting acupuncture and what fun is it to be poked by sharp little needles if you're not going to go have some tasty lunch afterwards. My hubby and I stumbled into this Puerto Rican neighborhood of Humbolt Park to try the much talked about and famous Chicago jbarito and I'm soooo happy we did. We got in during a weekday around 2:30pm which is that in between period from lunch and dinner so I figured it wouldn't be busy and I was quite surprised that it actually was. Upon walking in, the place is much smaller than I imagined but it smells amazing right off the bat. They have a parking lot right across the street where you are allowed to park for free but only on the left side because otherwise you can get towed, otherwise there is plenty of pay street parking.  I managed to get a little table while my husband was parking and I was looking around seeing jbaritos everywhere and their roasted chicken rotating, I'm telling you that amazing smell was something else. The place isn't fancy, so don't dress up, but get ready to have some unique and very tasty food. Our server approached us and brought fresh white bread and butter for the table which I thought was a nice touch. I ordered the Steak jbarito and my husband went for the chicken jbarito and we thought we would share those since that is what this place and neighborhood is known for. The Jbarito is made with juicy meat of your choice, lettuce, tomato, white or yellow cheese and a bit of mayo in between two crispy, fried plantains. The jbaritos came out in like ten minutes so we knew they weren't just sitting out and were really fresh. We gobbled them down, I loved the meat in between them, I would have wanted a little bit more mayo since the actual plantains were a tad on the dry side but still super tasty. I truly enjoyed my first jbarito experience. And for $8 and we got it with their Puerto Rican orange looking rice, it's definitely a great deal. Next time, I would just get french fries since I wasn't a big fan of the rice.  We also knew that we had to get something tasty for dessert so we ordered their fried sweet plantains for like $2 and they were very tasty but not the best ones I've had. However, for the price, they are a steal and a half. There was only one girl server at the place which can get a little difficult when it's a Friday night and it's packed, but she was very nice and did a great job during our midday treat. I definitely would recommend this place for the jbarito, both the chicken and the steak are delicious so you can't go wrong. It's a fulling and unique meal that won't damage your wallet. I was really happy to know we are one of the only official Puerto Rican neighborhoods in the US. Yay, for that.",0.9987,0.773,0.2,0.027,0.5707963411353242

The Tostones were fried plantains, a bit too greasy (since they came right out of the fryer); the Steak Jibarito sandwich was okay - instead of bread, the fillings were encased by two fried plaintains, some white cheese (that was not melted), marinated steak (a little too fatty), and sauteed onions.  It was an interesting bite.  The side of the Spanish rice, I was not a fan of, as the spices they used was just off - I did like the beans within them, though!  Their famous rotisserie chicken was a little too dry.

I even called ahead to reserve a table due to their limited space. When I arrive and am ready to order they tell me they are out of chicken and won't have any more for at least another 45min. Chicken...... What they are most known for. Why would you not keep up with it especially on a Saturday? Or why would you not warn me when I'm on the phone with you making the reservation?  Very poor service and a complete disappointment.  I'd also like to add to the owner that yes you have good food but your attitude really sucks. And sorry but your food isn't worth your 45min wait. Get the stick out of your ass and learn customer service.  The only reason why I'm giving one star right now is because They won't let me give any less and because the waitress was very nice.  Sucks because usually I'm happy. I wouldn't have wrote this review if it wasn't for the owners attitude and remark that I could have done with out.

I would rate the food as being ""okay"" (very average). The service was friendly. The sweet plantains were excellent and not dripping in grease. The arroz con gandules was flavorful. I liked the rice a lot. Then came our main course. I was disappointed in my steak, because it had some fat and grizzle. I had to spit out some of it discreetly, in a napkin, because I could not chew enough to swallow, and it was only lukewarm at best. Not good. The garlic bread was toasted. We drizzled olive oil on the bread. It was okay. We didn't have dessert. No beverages. The rice was ordered as a ""side"" which was an extra added cost. Our total tab came to $25 with tip. I would recommend other Puerto Rican restaurants in the same area (Division and/or North Ave), because they have better portions and much better quality food. This place is very, very small. You don't come here for the decor. You come here for the friendly service and cheap eats. My husband had the steak jibarito and he said it was okay. It is only $6, but it comes with nothing.

According to Wikipedia and local experts, the jibarito is technically not ""Puerto Rican,"" but rather a Puerto Rico inspired specialty sandwich of Chicago with grilled plantains replacing bread and topped with garlicky mayonnaise, tomatoes, onions, lettuce, and cheese - the end result something at once savory, sweet, smoky, and smooth - the original steak version actually better than the chicken and simply unlike any other sandwich I've tasted to date.   Moving on to sides and dessert, if there is one thing that Papa's doesn't go soft on it is flavor; the garlic bread like eating a whole roasted clove of garlic, the tostones intensely sweet, and the yucca intensely aromatic but a favorite of nearly everyone at the table.  For dessert, at the advice of our server we opted for the pastelillos while I followed my personal preferences ordering the carrot cake and while both were good the pastelillos were almost too sweet while the carrot cake was nutty, aromatic, and dense - just the way it should be - with a frosting far lighter and less sweet than the traditional American cream cheese version...perhaps not the way it 'should' be, but in my opinion better.",0.9945,0.838,0.153,0.009,0.5268187830687832

2012-10-23,4.0,"4 stars: Yay! I'm a fan. Came here specifically to try the jibaritos, which are kind of a Chicago specialty/novelty depending on your point of view. Allegedly they were ""invented"" at Borinquen in Humboldt Park in the 90s, but I have a very hard time believing that no human being ever put meat between two fried plantains before the Clinton administration, given the long history of plantains and the human consumption of meats.  My doubts aside, jibaritos are a cool way to eat meat with plantains. And since you can get them all over Chicago, it seems like one of those things where people develop a personal preference as to the nuances of how each restaurant prepares the components of each sandwich. Papa's Cache Sabroso cooks the plantains exactly how I like them: Crispy on the outside, moist but kind of chewy inside, garlicky seasoning, not too salty, not too oily, so I really enjoyed both the chicken and steak jibaritos that we got from this little storefront on Division.  Don't forget to order a can of (overpriced) coco rico or kola champagne to wash down your jibarito.  Jibarito-talk aside, although this is a tiny little restaurant with maybe 6-7 tables, they have a nice rotisserie setup to cook a whole bunch of chickens, and a pretty eclectic menu, so you could probably piece together some nice meals without ever ordering a jibarito and be pretty happy with your food. There's a bunch of tacky pictures on the wall of mostly D-list celebrities, and the atmosphere isn't really the main attraction here.  The food's good and the prices aren't too bad, so it's definitely worth adding to your rotation.

My boyfriend was unhappy too the portion of the steak was very little, the taste wasn't out of this world either.  We both agreed that cooking this at home would have been sooooo much better about 10 times better and tastier.   I hate the fact that these puerto rican restaraunts reheat things instead of giving it to you fresh.  You are paying for fresh not reheated.  Hello we customers can tell when something is not fresh by looking at it and than by tasting it.   It was about 8 pm when we went so maybe that is not the time to go if you want freshness guaranteed but if your business hours are from let's say 12 pm to 11 pm than you should guarantee serving fresh food the whole time.   I WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK.  You fooled me once shame on you!

The sandwich comes out with a side of beans and a heaping portion of moist white rice.  Ask for Nancy's special hot sauce and you will have yourself an explosion of flavors inside your very mouth.  The combination of the moist chicken and the garlicky plantain play off of each other so well.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.

2011-07-22,4.0,"Papa's is a Division Street institution, so I decided after too long walking past, to head on in and give it a try. I wanted to have a Jibarito of course, and a chicken one (also of course), and really felt like fries so went with this simple mix. Now, let me just say that as soon as I saw the arroz gandules I had made a mistake. These looked amazing, and I have had them before, and when my nicely prepared fries came I just wanted to trade them in for the arroz. Ah, next time.  The plantains were nicely prepared if a bit oily and the amount of well prepared chicken was amazing. This was a big sandwich prepared with the typical Puerto Rican fixings of lettuce, tomatoes, onion, and mayonnaise. Yep, the mayonnaise is amazing at most Puerto Rican places and often comes mixed with garlic. Oh, sweet mayo.  I watched the families eating around me in the small interior restaurant which thankfully on this hot Chicago afternoon had AC going full blast. There were a few brave souls out on the ample outside patio, but most folks packed into the small dine-in section. Like most Puerto Rican places there were a series of framed articles about the restaurant, and heroes from the island like Jose Clemente and a few well known pop stars posing with the owner. The servers were a pair of very nice girls who greeted everyone with a smile and were willing to talk to the one or two newbies in the place. The rest of the crowd seemed to be neighborhood regulars who knew what they wanted (they almost all got arroz gandules with the meals no matter the type). We all watched the Sox beat the Cubs (Humbolt Park is Cubs territory so I didn't cheer even though I am a Sox fan - respect).   As others have mentioned they have the rotisserie chickens, and I noticed a huge carrot cake which I wanted to eat, but alas, it was too hot, and my Jibarito and fries had done the trick.

The problem with everyone elses jibi's is they pre-cook the plantain, they end up with a weird texture. If by chance you get one cooked recently at the other places you will think I am off my rocker but, I speak the truth. Jibarito from the Spanish jibaro, can mean run wild, Rustic or as a noun the more accepted version to my friends Countryman or ""hillbilly"".  Hillbilly is a very funny word to hear Spanish speaking people say. I digress, the jibarrito is all of these, wild, rustic and a bit rural feeling. It is a Chicago thing, if you are coming to Chicago and want to try a Jibi then this is the only place you should try, two long thin slices of green plantain fried and standing in as the bread. Grilled skirt steak (I think), lettuce, tomato, mayo, and of all things wrong,  American cheese? They give you a choice of white or yellow and trust me it doesn't matter all though when the cheese is white you aren't reminded of what it is. Everything comes together in a crispy, unctuous, and flavorful sandwich that rivals anything in Chicago. It is not healthy, if you are one of those no mayo fascists just go to Chik Fil a and Yelp to empty ears.  Served with fried ripe plantains and a choice of rice. The rotisserie chicken is very good as well, its not terribly consistent but it makes for a fine meal with some gandules and rice or even the plain rice is very good. Dine in if possible, I don't think the sandwiches hold up well to a walk around the hood, the chicken is a better choice for takeout.

The plantains were a deliciously interesting bread substitute and to my contentment, a small part if mine had actually ripened more, so it was sweet (yum).

We ordered takeout and maybe that contributed to my review being in the minority. Perhaps, if I ate there the food would have been top notch.  Don't get me wrong the food was okay/good, but the rotisserie chicken was not a 5 star chicken. The big box stores sell good rotisserie chicken at half the price.  The steak jibarito was good, but once you put mayo between two plantains, it's difficult to screw up a sandwich. I will add it was a bit greasy too.      I agree with another review, I thought the place was a bit high for local food, especially the portions, etc. A whole chicken for $11 bucks, and it is not a big chicken. $4.50 for beans ? At least make it $4.50 for beans and white rice. It's an extra couple of bucks for white rice.  I'm not sure I will back. It is a small place, very small with no room to wait and again, a bit expensive. $10 will get you carryout for one, but bring a $20 to be on the safe side.

I ordered a chicken jibarito, which evidently comes with your choice of white or yellow cheese on top, although I have no idea what the difference is. Next time I'll try ""white"" and see how that turns out. Anyway, the sandwich was full of the restaurant's signature rotisserie chicken. The meat was exceptionally flavorful and quite tender, but the inclusion of some gristle and cartilage wasn't so appealing. The arroz con gandules were excellent -- mildly spiced but full of earthy flavor. I went early, and while the restaurant wasn't crowded it was clear that they were already doing a huge carryout and delivery business. Service was friendly and efficient. I was a little surprised, however, by the final bill, which came to more than I would've expected given the price of the food and the fact that I didn't order a drink. Perhaps I'm overly cheap, but $10 (including tip) just felt like a little too much for the amount of food I got.

Owned by Papa and Mama, they have been making great food here for years!  Pretty much family run (daughters, cousins, etc.), the service has been friendly and efficient.   I haven't had any takeout that was bad here yet, so I'll focus on the key things for you to try for you first timers: 1.  Jibarito (pronounced Hib-burrito):  Delicious pieces of meat that have placed into a garlic plaintain sandwich.  That's right, no bread, garlic plaintains!  Some may say they prefer Borinquen (a naughty word to use at Papa's according to what Mama told me), but lately Borinquen has been getting very greasy.  This one is near perfect! 2.  Lechon (roasted pig):  While they only serve this on Saturday, the lechon is quite good.  In fact, it is rare that I've seen my roommate eat something, and fall over to the ground, roll around, claim he is in heaven, only to get up again for another bite.  The meat is soft and tender, with just the right amount of juices... but the big winner with lechon is the perfectly fried skin they provide with the order... it is a small square of happiness that will give you dreams of pleasure for weeks to come. 3.  Hot sauce:  They have a homemade hot sauce they Mama hopes to bottle and sell in the near future... and oh man, is it good.  Talk to Mama about it, and she'll typically give you a small container of it for your first time there, and you'll see what I""m talking about... this stuff is phenomenal!   4.  Roasted chicken:  This is ridiculous.  You can get a whole roasted chicken that has been slow cooked and delicious... for the hungry man (or woman) who is really looking to chow down, this is some good stuff!  Order it up and see what I mean... 5.  Chuletas (Fried pork chops):  These were tasty enough that I was left sucking on the bone to get every last bit of flavor possible out of them.  While not the star of the show at Papas, definitely something worth trying if you want to mix it up... personally, I will be likely sticking to jibaritos for 95% of my visits here.
