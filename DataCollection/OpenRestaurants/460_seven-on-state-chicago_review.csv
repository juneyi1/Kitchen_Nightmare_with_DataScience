2017-07-16,5.0,This place is a hidden gem. I was looking for a good burger spot in the loop that wasn't expensive and wasn't McDonald's. I went on Yelp and saw this place. I came around 2 pm on a Friday and the place was pretty much empty. The burger spot had a deal so I was pretty happy about that. I noticed that each venue had their own promotion day which I'm excited to come back on those designated days and try each place out for a cheap price. I got a normal burger with a side of fries and a milk shake.  Everything was sooooo good and well made. Definitely recommend this place.,0.9697,0.748,0.222,0.03,0.6666666666666666

2016-02-02,5.0,"Located on the 7th floor of Macy's is the Seven on State food court. I venture over here for lunch from time to time. Multiple options, convenient location (can be accessed via the pedway), and overall decent lunch spot. I primarily eat at Marc burger or Frontera Fresco, although I've been to the salad counter for a really good Chicken panzanella salad.  Marc Burger - Burgers, fried chicken sandwich, grilled fish sandwich, and black bean burger are all good. I especially enjoy the garlic and cracked pepper fries which comes with every sandwich. The fish sandwich is marinated in a soy based marinade and extremely flavorful. The fish was flaky and light. The fried chicken sandwich is huge and served with a curry mayo. The black bean burger is seasoned well and not too soggy. I particularly like the caramelized onions that are served on top of the black bean burger.  Frontera - The last time I ordered the shrimp torta and a side of guacamole and chips. The torta is fantastic and comes with garlic shrimp, goat cheese, black beans, argula and lime on a chewy bun. The chipotle chicken torta - Poblano rajas, goat cheese, smoky garlic mojo, black beans, wild arugula, lime is equally delicious, but a bit spicy for my liking. Their quesadillas and huaraches (served with a small side salad) are decent, but not my favorite. The huarahces are sorta like a flatbread but made of masa and heavier. A Frontera lunch with a side of guacamole and chips can run near $18, but you won't leave disappointed. *Update* I tried the Cuban torta and was not a fan. The  sliced pork was dry and fatty. The bacon was not crisp, rather rubbery and room temperature. Other than the fresh sliced avocado I did not eat much of the torta. Disappointing.",0.9333,0.867,0.1,0.032,0.5734649122807017

2010-10-07,2.0,"This is a relatively frequent lunchtime spot for me.  However, I foresee it becoming much less frequent in the near future... because while I don't have a set amount of time for lunch, I find the amount of time I've been waiting in line for something as simple as a salad a bit ridiculous as of late. I'm not sure what the problem is, but the salad station has become ungodly slow.  And that's unfortunate, because their salads are probably my favorite in the area (for lunch anyway).  The panzanella and ""fish of the day"" nicoise aren't to be missed.  Some of their daily specials are good, too.  And while I'm on that topic, I might add that it would be extremely helpful if they actually posted what the specials were each day.  That way you don't have to wait til you got to the register, then potentially make a last minute change in your order (and annoy the people waiting in line behind you).  The salads also come with these yummy pretzel rolls which, no matter how often I tell myself I'm not going to eat it, I always do. I've probably been going here the last year or so, but as of late the service has gone way way downhill.  Last week I went and the friend who I was with--who was behind me in line--got his salad first.  That happens sometime, no big deal.  But I waited.  And waited.  And waited.  Then I finally spoke up.  Nope, no one had started on my salad, but the woman behind the counter did it right then.   Same deal today at lunch.  Ordered salad.  Waited.  Waited.  Waited.  And in the midst of all this waiting, tried to figure out what on earth the three women and one man (in addition to the order taker) were doing behind the counter.  There was a lot of slow shuffling, checking of order tickets, more slow shuffling, slowly making a salad and so on.  The bulk of the time the guy and one woman were MIA.  People, it's lunchtime on State St.  Let's pick up the pace!",0.347,0.865,0.066,0.069,0.4966213151927436

Tip:  This place gets really packed during prime lunch hour.  It's a good idea to get here by 11:45 or after 12:45, otherwise expect a long wait (especially at Frontera & Takashi's). Tip:  There is an ""express"" elevator to the seventh floor (which actually stops on every floor) at the back of the purse/jewelery section.  We like to take the escalators on the way down so we can browse the merchandise.

2009-03-18,5.0,"This is just about the best food court in the Loop.  Period.  Between Frontera Fresco, Takashi, Marc Burger, and the Walnut Room being adjacent you can't beat the quality and variety.  I also love the fact that they have ample seating.  I have never had to wait for a table and they have servers that come over and refill your drinks for you.  My only complaint is that getting up to the 7th floor of the Macy's on State can be troublesome because they only have two elevators, which run slow as molasses and the line can get a little long.  Also, if you choose to take the elevator, it can take even longer.  Regardless, it is worth the trouble.",0.4767,0.856,0.08,0.064,0.47000000000000003

2009-02-26,5.0,"Marc burger is so awesome! I was impressed by the turkey burger! So tender and not dry.  I also like the chicken breast sandwich.  The chicken breast wasn't dry either and the avocado mayo on top complemented the chicken breast very well.  The burgers are all served on potato bread too.  yum!  All sandwiches come with cole slaw, pickles, and fries.  (I must also add that the fries were REALLLLYYY good too!)  I sometimes wish they would offer an option to order extra fries because I so would want more.  mmmmmmmm! Pricey for a burger, but I've paid similar or more for burgers that don't taste as good.  Service is great too! free refills on water and soda.  Even though it's a food court type atmosphere, the staff is great about coming around to your table to offer you a free beverage refill or clean your table off after you've finished.   As I've said about other lunch locations in the Loop, get there early or get there late.  If you go right during the rush hour, you'll have to wait in a very long line.",0.9916,0.779,0.213,0.007,0.6272285714285715
2009-02-26,4.0,"It felt like a day for Thai Chicken Salad. I wanted a Thai Chicken Salad. I ordered a Thai Chicken Salad. As I watched my salad come to life behind the counter at the Salad Station, a finished plate was making its way to a customer standing beside me. On the plate: slices of pecan-crusted turkey breast over fluffy quinoa dotted with roasted squash, green apples and scallions, a mound of baby spinach on the side, glazed pecans strewn over, and a dollop of cranberry-apple chutney whispering sweet seduction from the top of it all. I glanced over at this fortunate customer. It was a sweet old lady, likely in her late-sixties, give or take a decade (one never really knows, does one?). Quite lovely, really. Maybe she had a cane. Maybe she didn't. I could take her. Somehow I knew I could do it. Her salad should be mine. It would be mine. My reverie was broken by the arrival my own salad. To be sure, my Thai Chicken Salad was delicious. Grilled chicken breast over a mound of shredded napa cabbage and carrots, sliced red peppers and scallions, dressed with a sweet-sour peanut sauce, and crowned with crispy rice noodles. But was it Turkey and Quinoa Salad delicious? It was not debatable. It was impossible! I trembled with frustrated desire. The very next day, back at the office, I'd just hit Send, releasing an electronic admonishment to friends, urging them to abandon work and adjourn to Seven on State -- post haste! -- and taste for themselves the Turkey and Quinoa Salad as I was doing that very instant, when a voice pierced my veil of concentration: 'OH. MY. GOD. THAT SALAD LOOKS AMAAAAAZING!' It was beginning. +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ An interlude: Miso Ramen from Takashi Noodles -- al dente ramen noodles with ground pork and sweet corn, luxuriating in a bath of rich miso broth. Best enjoyed with a half-order of pork gyoza as part of the Combination Noodle option. (Also pretend you haven't noticed the typo on their menu board.) Burgers or grilled fish sandwich from Marc -- always to be got with french fries, which have a light sprinkling of sugar in addition to the salt and parsley flakes. If you know of any Ethiopian-born, Swedish-raised, New York-based chefs more deserving of a bronze statue right at the intersection of State and Washington Streets, call me. If his name is anything other than Marcus Samuelsson I will be most sceptical and ultimately dismissive. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ I do realise that to so love the wares of a food court is wrong, wicked even.

The hamburger meat is excellent quality, and the seasoned fries are out of this world. They give you a big basket of fries, too. Best burger you'll have in a food court, guaranteed. It probably gets pretty packed an lunchtime. I usually go around 1:15, and have no problem finding a table to sit at.

2008-10-23,4.0,"Laura B. has me reminiscing now about the fantasticorgasmico goat cheese salad at Seven On State.  That was the salad that turned me into the goat cheese hoor I am today.  It's like the gateway drug of goat cheese.  Those little fried pats of goat cheese go so nicely with the sweetness of the strawberries, the zing of balsamic vinegar and the savoriness of the toasted pecans.  Tossed with lovely greens and served with... wait for it... a deeeelicious pretzel roll and you've got yourself a really beautiful lunch. I never found the lines to be unbearable around 11:30, unlike so many other Loop lunch spots (probably including this one during prime lunch time).  I always felt sated and rejuvenated after enjoying this goat cheese salad at a sunny window seat--not quite rejuvenated enough to actually *want* to go back to work, but that's why you're eating in Macy's *cough Marshall Field's cough* on the 7th floor.  Plenty of escalators to ride and things to look at on your way back down to reality.",0.9065,0.913,0.087,0.0,0.467824074074074
2008-08-24,4.0,"I am in love with their goat cheese salad there, simple as that.  The salad consists of a great big bed of lettuce - spring mix, no crappy iceberg - tossed lightly with a great balsamic vinaigrette.  It also has a few pecans and some strawberries tossed in and - the best and most important part - little pieces of fried goat cheese.  They almost look like tator tots, but wooooooow.... amazing.  The goat cheese is so creamy and good, with a nicely contrasted crunchy-ish outside. Seven on State is really a food court.  The person I was dining with also had a bowl of their white chili, which I got to try, and that was also superb.  Since it is on the 7th floor of the State Street Macy's, it is a great way to eat a great lunch in between trying on jeans and shirts and shoes and whatever else.",0.9917,0.721,0.256,0.023,0.5453571428571429

Over the years, I generally ignored the 7th floor in favor of not eating at the awesome store. Today, I went here with a group of girls and was completely impressed by this place. Seven on State puts to shame any and every other food court ever. Where else can you get incredibly fresh salads, frontera, tempting noodles, and other yummies. I got a grilled salmon sandwich from the grill and it was delicious. The salmon was big and very filling. The fries were crisp and lightly salted. My other table companions got noodle soups, stir frys, and quesadillas. Everything looked so good that I'll definitely be returning to try it all. Though a little pricey, you get real silverware and real glasses. Sure beats plastic silverware and the plastic-y fake scent of bad food court Chinese.

YUM), burgers at the grill, and of course, Rick Bayless' Frontera station.  The salad with grilled chicken at the Frontera station is my new favorite, I think, with a limeade.  I would give Seven on State five stars except that it's a little pricey, so that keeps it from being an every day place.  Four and a half stars.",0.9421,0.882,0.118,0.0,0.6245021645021644

The ingredients are all very fresh and flavorful; most of the selections are fairly healthy, or at least seem to be that way.  There are also a ton of great selections for vegetarians (though I'm not certain how well vegans would fare).  I've never found the food to be greasy and the only downfall is the copious amounts of selections make if difficult to decide exactly what you want.
