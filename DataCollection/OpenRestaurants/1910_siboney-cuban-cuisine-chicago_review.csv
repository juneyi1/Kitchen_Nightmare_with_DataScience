Too loud for my ears though I so love the music. We waited for someone to acknowledge us for about 5 minutes and when we were, we sat outside. The service took a VERY LONG time. We ordered empanadas to start and ordered our entrees at the same time. We waited a half hour for the apps and I hoped that they weren't bringing everything together because we were starving. I went inside and the waiter was behind the bar chatting away with someone. He saw me and said oh, I'll bring out your food! another 10 minutes pass by - I think he forgot to put the order in. Empanadas were good but had minimal filling. I was excited to have the whole red snapper but it was terrible....overcooked so it was dry and there was zero flavor. Hello salt? pepper? garlic? And if you see the lemon slices in the photo, they look nice but very hard to squeeze. I ate what I could since I was starving.

My now husband (feels weird to write) and I went on a Tuesday night and sat on their patio, which was great on a warm summer evening. We started off with some mariquitas de plátano (plantain chips with garlic sauce). The portion size was generous, and they were warm and delicious. For entrees, I ordered the churrasco de pollo (grilled chicken breast) and my husband ordered the Cuban sandwich (which I planned to, and did, eat about a third of..). Both entrees were good. I would likely order the Cuban instead of my grilled chicken next time, but on the other hand we've had better Cuban sandwiches elsewhere. I've found Cohiba Cuban and Havana to be a bit better.

2016-05-31,2.0,"Ordered the steak sandwich. Not bad, but the meat was not caramelized and the fat was not rendered. I thought it tasted OK but the person ordering could not eat it. Tasted like the cooking method led to it being more steamed than anything else, leaving chunks of soft fat on the meat and contributing to an overall off flavor. The fried pork thing was even more disappointing. Dry chunks of pork that had been deep fried (or fried in some other way, without breading or prior pre-cooking), leading to a dry exterior. It had obviously received a marinade or dry rub, but the overall flavor was that of salt. The interior had some moistness but it wasn't very pleasant to eat. The cassava that came with it was mild and provided a nice balance to the overly salty meat. What really made me upset is that they did not include empanadas, then lied to the delivery service, saying they had been put in the bag. It's one thing to forget something, but it's another to lie and refuse to refund the money. I'll get my empanadas back -- I'm thinking a $0 tip order and a credit card charge back are in order -- but I hope this serves as a warning to anyone dealing with this place.

My boyfriend and I came in on a Saturday night around 845pm place wasn't busy at the time. The atmosphere was nice, live music was great! Someone came to the table with 5 minutes of being seated to fill our water glasses but didn't say a word to us or introduce himself so i assumed he was just a bus boy or server assistant. The same kid came back 15 minutes later asked what we wanted, my issue with this is 1. It took 15 minutes to take our order  ¥which would of been five if he at least stopped by to check if we had questions or explain any specials) 2. He did not even introduce himself to us or be personable with us in any way. So we order the tostones and i point to the ones that say nachos and a side of yuca frita as apps and vaca frira and bisect a la palomilla for dinner. 5 minutes later they bring out complimentary soup and bread fit dinner, both tasted good. Appetizers come out next and he brings the side of yuca and a side of plain to tostones, i let him know i ordered the nacho version not the side so he takes it back and 10 minutes later brings out the right order no more than 2 minutes later out entrées come out. Not once during dinner did he come  by to see if the food was ok or if we needed something.  (It wasnt even busy!!) Finally we catch his attention for togo boxes. After bringing those out he got sat with a party of 5 and my boyfriend and I sat at out table that was completely empty for almost 25 minutes waiting on the bill. I had to actually walk to the bar and ask for our bill. Our server took the party of 5s drink and food order and was then walking around aimlessly not once walking over to out table l. To make it worse when he finally did drop off the bill he said ""sorry you. Didn't tell me you wanted your bill"" that aggregated me because he never gave us the chance to ask because he disappeared after dropping of togo boxes.

I did like the plantain chips, especially with olive oil/fresh garlic dipping sauce. It's funny that this was offered as a side, but I still got to sample them for free.  I ordered a Cuban sandwich. Now I've had quite a few of these in my life and it's tough to find quality Cuban cuisine if you don't live in Florida. So here's what I would say. The bread was the highlight of the sandwich. It was warm, very crispy on the outside and very dense, the way good Cuban bread should be. But I was very disappointed how much more ham there was than pork. My boss had a platter of suckling pig for her meal and she got this amazing pile of shredded pork. I, on the other hand, got one slice of pork between three or four pieces of ham. I'm not a big ham eater, so that was not what I was hoing for. It was nice that they offered different hot sauces to add as well, and the neon green one was hot to be sure!

About two years ago, the location was under different management and at that time, the staff were attentive to their customers, they were knowledgeable of their menu and the bands were awesome. After new management took over, the food has gotten more expensive, but not even close to worth the price. I remember when the Yuca with garlic was so scrumptious and when I ordered it, it tasted like a potato in butter sauce. I asked for it to go back.  Then while we are sitting, finally about after 10-15 minutes, we were asked by a server if anyone has come to help us? In my head, I am thinking, shouldn't you be organized enough to know which tables belong to who so that you would know? I had to call him back over three times to order food, order drinks, and to take our plates away because he obviously didn't know what he was doing. But the most disgusting thing to me was when I asked for Sangria. The Sangria is made and stored in a huge plastic container. Instead of the bartender using a proper spoon to fill up my cup, he literally used a regular cup and with his hand dunk the cup and part of his hand into the container to fill my cup. Talk about a passing of bacteria. My overall experience this time was the last straw for this location and I will not ever be visiting again.",0.9752,0.871,0.11,0.019,0.4449067599067599

Once the cocktail arrived (a concoction of ginger beer and tonic) I took a sip and the flavor was unique, not a gin and tonic. I sent it back and tried to cancel the cocktail but, she wouldn't let me. They sent the owner's son over to ask me what I wanted, awkward giving your drink order to a 12 year old. The second one arrived and it was better than the 1st but, still not a true gin & tonic. The good news, it was only $5. We both ordered the Ropa Vieja and were satisfied with the portions and taste.

Here's the deal: I was there on a Saturday night for dinner. A friend had made reservations, probably a wise choice. It started to fill in quite nicely toward the end of our stay because their was live music. We wound up having a table in view of the band although they didn't start playing until right before 10pm. It was a bit cramped when the table behind us was seated, but not the worst I've experienced.

All pretty tasty. Then it was time to decide what to eat. Everyone in my party ordered something that was basically a hunk of meat with little sides like rice, beans and/or jicama. I went with a delicious corn tamal with pieces of jicama and rice and beans. It was absolutely delightful! Vegetarian or not, it was the best tasting meal made from corn I've ever had!  And now for the REALLY good stuff - dessert. Whoa. Just whoa. Flan doused in rum which the waiter brings in a glass he then sets on fire. He then pours said flaming rum on to the flan. MY FLAN WAS ON FIRE! The ""fried milk"" intrigued my group so it was ordered. Turns out it was fried flan with a syrup on top. Think two decent sized rectangle shaped gooey flan pieces encased in a nice crunchy crust with sugary syrup on top. Holy crap, it was amazing. The banana flavored ice cream was also delicious and homemade!  The waiters - there was a rotating cast - were very friendly but not the most competent. We weren't expecting to be there so long and apparently neither was one of our waiters. He brought the check even though we never asked for it. We explained we wanted another round of drinks and were staying for the band. It was, in true ""the customer is always right"" fashion, no problem.

I had not been to the restaurant since 8/17/12 because we received crappy service I don't know why I expect that to be different this time (wishful thinking?)

The ropa vieja and lechon was amazing along with some croquetas and yucca. AMAZING!!! I returned later that night  with my wife because we had some downtime before hitting up Wicker Park, we sampled the watermelon mojitos....very tasty.  The night of the event. My team requested to watch the fight, they were able to find an on line feed and route it to all the TVs. How many restaurants will actually delve into the Internet just to put something up on the TV? None.  Overall, their attention to our group was top notch.

Ropa vieja is supposed to fall apart when you pick it up with your fork and should be drenched in flavor from the broth it slow cooked in. Mine was not tender and was more oily than flavorful. It clearly didn't cook long enough to get tender. You can get much better Cuban food at many other restaurants in the city.

It was not very crowded on a weeknight, for about half our meal there were only 3 or 4 other tables seated, yet we could never get our waiter.  I wasn't in a hurry, so it wasn't like that, but we couldn't get water until we were almost done with our meal.  We asked for hot sauce from two different people during our appetizers, and finally went inside to ask a third time after watching our waiter do about five other things from using the restroom to making coffee. Also, there was a miscommunication with the appetizer.  I asked for the combo and pointed to it on the menu, but he apparently thought I meant super combo, which was $10 more.  The food was great so I didn't take issue, plus I could have read the menu more carefully, so shame on both of us. However the most aggravating of all was the forced gratuity.  Even though we only had a party of three, the gratuity was already added to the bill.  If you are going to ensure amazing service or have some other reason to include gratuity (there was no live music since it was a weeknight), then I wouldn't complain.  And I am usually a generous tipper anyway.  But to rig it so that you will get a great tip and then do a lazy job?  Makes me want to go elsewhere. As for the food, everything in the combo appetizer (empanada, pork, a bunch of other stuff I can't remember, ha) was delicious, and the combo plate was great as well (chicken, pork, skirt steak, shrimp, plantains, potatoes, rice).  Definitely had enough for leftovers.  Too bad I don't think you can do take out...",0.9787,0.746,0.157,0.097,0.5918402777777778

We were the only customers until we were almost done with our meal and then two other tables got occupied. It was a Wednesday night though. Had the Cuban tamale and ropa vieja empanada to start. Good but not spectacular. The empanada is served with tartar sauce which is king of strange. It was good, just odd. Will have to ask my dad to find out if that is how they are served in Cuba. I had never seen it before, so I'm guessing it is not. For our entrees we ordered the picadillo which I though was really good. Dare I say, better than my mom's?? The rice and black beans were average. Somewhat watery. Not even close to my mom's! So far so good, but then I made the rookie mistake of all rookie mistakes. I ordered fish in a place that was serving only one table! I don't know why I did this. I mean, how fresh could the fish possibly be when there is no one eating there?? They had both grouper and red snapper and I asked the server which one was fresher. He recommended the grouper. Sorry, but it was fishy and neither myself, my wife or my son really wanted to eat much of it. I blame myself for ordering it, but I blame them for serving fish that is not fresh. Maybe during the weekends they get busy and can turn over a lot of fish and it is fresh, but during the slow week nights, not so much.

During one visit there was salsa dancing in the adjoining room, so it was fun to go dance and work off my dinner.  The next time there was a kids birthday party in the adjoining room.  The other times were quiet with music playing quietly in the background.

He will tell the hostess to tell us they wouldn't take the deal... I speak both English and Spanish so not sure why this guy wouldn't talk directly to me.... Today is a Saturday and there's nothing special going on, I call to make my reservation and as soon as I mentioned the deal they tell me they don't accept it on the weekends WHAT??? I explained them nowhere in the deal says that...and the lady said she couldn't do anything about it, not even an apology or nothing.

2012-02-25,4.0,"Siboney, siboney, your so love-ley! Seriously, everything about my dinner here was lovely, and after much reflection, I can't think of a better word to describe my whole experience.  The BF and I came here for an early V-Day/half-anniversary dinner on a recommendation from a friend.  Started out with a couple of mojitos that knocked my socks off, not because they were so strong, but because they were so perfect! Next we had some bolitas-goat cheese mixed with cassava and deep-fried to perfection.  We also indulged in some chicken emapanadas and they were ahhhhh-mazing.   The best part about all of the cuisine? The flavor managed to be fantastic without being spicy.  Here me out: I always consider spiciness to be necessary for me to think something is flavorful, but the BF hates spiciness and so we tend to disagree on entrees that we like.  But at Siboney ALL of the entrees have flavor and are not spicy, which I did not think was possible in all of my spicy snobbishness.  I went with the Boliche de Res Mechado because the description on the menu stated a roast stuffed with chorizo which is write up my alley, chorizo on anything usually wins me over.  My dish was very good, but I was a little confused because the meat was very thin and no chorizo as I know it anywhere to be found. It was more like a home-cooked roast in a vegetable soup, still satisfying.  The BF got the Vaca Frita-shredded flank steak.  The flank steak was a little chewy, but once mixed with the rice and beans and a little lime juice, it was perfect.  Both came with different rice and beans that complemented the meat nicely.  I also loved that the portions were not ginormous and we left feeling very full, but not stuffed beyond belief as often happens. The service was attentive, and I especially liked that the owner helped us out when the Living Social Instant Deal was not working.  He let us try to upload the deal on the restaurant's Ipad ourselves (Usually the restaurant staff does this) because of the problems and then worked on it himself until the deal worked.  Even without the deal, Siboney is very affordable for a date night, I would definitely recommend it if you like to eat out, but don't want to break the bank. Free parking on Western doesn't hurt either (unless of course there is more than 2 inches of snow).",0.9973,0.761,0.189,0.05,0.5848373983739837

My favorite were the Empanadas.  The Spinach with Cheese and  Chihuahua cheese were amazing!  I could have stopped there.   The Pork Tamal was fantastic, also.  Somewhat different than a traditional Mexican Tamale, but just as good or better.  The masa was moist, and slightly sweet.  Their Papa Rellena was good, but a tad too salty.  Breaded in Panko, which was different, but worked well.  The Aguacate (which they accurately describe as an avocado) was just that.  Half of an avocado sliced, with slices of onion and 1 grape tomato cut in half garnish.  I incorrectly assumed that it would be something Guacamole-like, so I felt a little ripped off at $4.99.  But it was a mighty delicious avocado, I must say!  The Plato Sorpresa Siboney is pricey, but everything on the combo platter was done very well, and a large portion.  Last but not least, their sweet plantains are awesome.  They were VERY ripe, and beautifully caramelized.  Perfect.

So, I consented - as I know how it feels to lazily meander to a local food spot rather than take time and effort to go somewhere farther away.  And I was more than pleasantly surprised.  Being the weekend after Thanksgiving, it wasn't too packed and they started to play live music around 9:30.  Through and through, I was more than happy with the experience.   The food we ordered was diverse in such a way that I can comment on the sandwich, the cerco estofado, the smoked pork chop, and the empanadas.  We started the night with a dealers choice empanada selection - our waitress brought back a chorizo, a shredded beef, and a soy empanada all very good and with great spicy notes.  The cerco estofado is slow cooked tender with the moros and christianos - beans and rice.  The smoked pork chop with beans, rice, and white, garlic root (as my dining companion advised me it was) was also very good.  Although I would have liked a little stronger garlic on the root.  There was nothing I wasn't happy about.   We split some of the plates and my lazy companion shared his fried plantains and sandwich with us.   As for the drinks I had the mango batido while two mojitos were being consumed - one to my left and one to my right.  The milk shake brought back memories of my Filipino-ness, with the milk tasting very sweet - but not sugar sweet - if that makes any sense.  Meanwhile the mojitos were described as ""Oh my god, can I get a bigger glass. TO GO?"" All in all, before dessert it was $25 apiece with drinks and appetizers.  I'll most definitely be back.  Although I'll do it with this place as the ""destination in mind"" instead of the ""lazy, eh, it's right around the corner from my place""",0.9824,0.871,0.114,0.015,0.5643675595238096

2011-10-17,4.0,"Food:  Overall the food was really good.  Main entrees were excellent, I would have to say if anything fell short if would be the sides, but not by much - the black beans were a little bland, the sweet plantains needed to be a little more ripe and the filling in one of the empanadas (the pork) was bland.  These were minor issues, but needed to be mentioned because it did affect the meal a lil' bit, but not too much. So that was the bad...the good - my sandwich.  I got the Ropa Vieja Sandwich dinner.  Anytime I go to any Cuban restaurant I must try their ropa vieja... it's my ""test"" - Siboney passed with flying colors.  I was expecting a little sandwich much like I get a most Cuban places what I got was a monster sandwich - seriously this thing was huge.  The best part is that it was made of just two components - wonderful fresh crusty bread and a heap-load of ropa vieja.  The sandwich was pressed on what I am assuming was some sort of panini press which made the outside of the bread nice and crispy and crunchy.  The  meat was full of flavor...I was in heaven, but the sandwich was so huge, I was only able to finish half. Sides for this plate were:  White rice, black beans and sweet plantains.  Honestly, they were all ok, but I was so taken with the sandwich, the all played second fiddle. Dessert:  We had the Pastelitos Cubanitos - Flaky pastry stuffed with guava and cream cheese and I also had a Cafe Cubano.  Both were excellent....except that I really truly wish that they would sweeten the cream cheese in these pastries, or sprinkle the top with some sugar or honey because it can be tough biting into straight cream cheese.   Other food:  While we ordered appetizers (empanadas with choice of stuffing) I did not have any because I was saving myself for my entree.  They looked good though, and as I mentioned above, the boyfriend mentioned that one of the three was a little bland.  Also, the boyfriend had the Filet de Cerdo Camagueyana (breaded pork stuffed with turkey, ham and gouda cheese with sides of rice, black beans and yuca with tons of garlic) - he licked his plate clean....I will take that as a sign that he liked his food.. a lot. Live music on a Friday night, the manager (who was working the room the entire evening and was very friendly) informed us that they also have karaoke nights.   Price:  I thought it was priced fair.  For everything we ordered and considering how happy we were with the food, great service, ambiance, I thought it was fairly priced.

The Platanos Maduros were cooked to perfection.The Yucca was a little too garlicy for her taste.  She was hoping for Bolce but it wasn't on the menu. The Frijoles Negros were very tasty. My daughter who just dreads any restaurant that doesn't have a drive thru, had the Bistec de Pollo a la Plancha. An extremely large serving that we thought we'd need a doggie bag for. Well she just scarfed up the whole piece because she said it was so good she couldn't stop eating it.     I ordered the Bistec de Palomilla. Before we visited  I checked out their menu on line, and in the description of the Bistec de Palomilla it said that it was served with chopped onions. After El Prado in Maywood stopped serving dinner years ago we've been through a half dozen Cuban restaurants that  just don't make this dish properly.  They nailed it.  I thoroughly enjoyed my meal.

2010-05-05,4.0,"For my third birthday, I wanted a puppy. I got a sister instead. Growing up this sharing a birthday caused no end of strife due to shared birthday parties. As adults, however, we have worked out an unspoken agreement. My sister, being younger and more fun, gets to have the weekend birthday gathering; and me being older and, well, more anally exacting, gets the party on our birthday proper. At the most recent party, she told me, however, that this system may have broken down. ""I think you go out more than me now,"" she said, ""I hear about your Foursquare check-ins.""  However, I still think our arrangement holds for a simple reason. Despite how much more I go out, she still chooses better restaurants. After a Mexifail debacle at Fuego on our actual birthday, she chose the wonderful Cuban restaurant Siboney for the weekendy, drunkity, drinky fiesta.  This stretch of Western between Armitage and Fullerton now contains some of the best pan-Latin flavors around. After trying it, Siboney rivals Rosa de Lima in my mind as the best of the bunch. Everything I tried there was spectacular (and it wasn't even assisted by their signature mojitos - I was drinked out).  My appetizer was a veggie tamale Cuban style (which makes it a tamal, but who's counting) and the two soft, tangy, gigantic corn mealy rolls of joy were a meal by themselves (at $3.99).  Thankfully, however, I didn't stop there (much as my wallet would have thanked me). I got the white rice, black bean, and vegetable mix for my main (they are surprisingly vegetarian friendly there). While it lacks a catchy name, it did not lack for flavor at all. Even vegetables I'm normally shy about eating - like red peppers - were delectably prepared and mixed in. Except for the mushrooms, that is, those are still Satan's fungus and I picked them off and poutily threw them to the side like the three year old I was at the birth of my sister!  But what really made this a great place for a birthday celebration was the live music. More muzak really. It was just a guy with a keyboard in the next room. However, he mixed instrumentalized American pop tunes and oldies with Spanish language ""classics"" (I think he played ""Guantanamera"" twice, but it was enjoyable both times) beautifully. His rendition of ""Happy Birthday"" for my sister was a carnival ride's worth of fun. And he had the entire table singing along with ""My Way"" en Espanol (with choruses in English). It may have even been derived from the Sid Vicious version.  It wasn't perfect. They're not really set up to accommodate large parties (another reason my sister gets the weekend is that she knows, and I'm not kidding, *everyone* west of Damen). We were set up in a L shape which wasn't conducive to saying hello to half the table. And not that this mattered anyhow because this place was so noisy on a Friday night that you could only hear the person next to and across from you anyway. Still next year, I want my birthday party to be at Siboney (or just my next celebration in general). Of course, knowing my sister, she'll choose somewhere better still.  Not that I mind though. She sniffs out good restaurants better than any puppy.",0.9984,0.781,0.191,0.029,0.3623635912698412

The waitress did not give us bread, we got it because we asked another waitress after noticing that every other table except us got it as soon as they sat down. Then we ordered some apetizers and apparently the waitress also forgot about those so the other waitress brought them to us after we asked if they were going to take much longer (it had been about 40 minutes at this point).  Eventually we got to order our food (of course, after we called our regular waitress and let her know we were ready) and it finally arrived...Well, she messed up my order and it had shrimp although I told her I did not want them because I was allergic, then she just took them out of the plate and apologized. At this point I was just so hungry I didn't care to argue and I'm not really allergic I just don't like shrimp...The actual food was fine, I ordered the Siboney platter, it includes fish, steak, and pork (and shrimp) along with yuca and rice. Flavor was  nothing exceptional but not bad, and they did not have hot sauce!

The 2 best dishes that I tried (from a variety of 6 +) were the snapper and the the bistec en cazuela.  The meat in general was chewier than to be desired and the tamale and beef empanada were disgusting - I refused to eat more than 1 bite of it.  There was probably 2 chunks of meat in the tamale while it was already lacking flavor and the empanada tasted like it was sitting in used cooking oil overnight.   Then they started playing club music at 8:30 PM - it was blaring in the back room and the DJ was not good to begin with.  We asked them to turn it down (we'd prefer OFF) so they did but then 20 min later, the bad DJ was at it again.  Very frustrating.

It was surprisingly good. The Bad - A DJ came out and started playing raise the roof type music during our dinner. It was like eating in a nightclub. I turned around and asked my friend, ""Are we at Enclave?"" - I understand it's hard to coordinate a dinner party of 30 people.

Among them is Fricase, ropa vieja, and picadillo. Soo...I stopped here after work today and it was empty, just the owners and what might be a manager or friend or cousin.

On to the food: -The most amazing Fricase de pollo I've ever had, that isn't my mom's. -The tostones were perfect  -The congris was 'home made' to the T.  -The flan...OMG the flan!!! I asked if it was bought or made there and he said made there. Fabulous, creamy, perfect! -They brought out ox tail for the friend that was hanging out there and I saw the owner taste the sauce to double check.

It was bitter as if the garlic was either old or burned, it was just gross....As we're eating our ""appetizer"", in walks another couple. (theres a point to my mentioning this)... My boyfriend wanted red snapper there was no red snapper available on this day. I ordered Filete de Pollo a la Plancha/grilled chicken w/grilled onions and black beans and rice. Disgusting. My chicken had no flavor what so ever it hadn't been grilled more like steamed. My rice and beans were just  bland and sticky. No garlic, no onions no imagination. My boyfriend ordered a Steak cuban. The quality of meat that was used was unacceptable. His sandwich was extremely FATTY. There were chunks of fat in every bite eewwww. As we were struggling through our dinner we noticed the owner greeting the other patrons who were all cuban like him. We whispered about if we would tell him how nasty his food was when he came over. We assumed he would b/c the place was empty. He never gave us a second thought, so he dodged that bullet.  A man walks past that had came in earlier while we were eating our ""appetizer""...he was coughing and hacking and not looking so good. He was heading to the bathroom. He puked and gagged loudly for a good 5 minutes. I SWEAR. It was the most DISGUSTING and DISTURBING dining experience I have ever had. The food had made this man sick to his stomach. Oh wait!! before that man had gone to the rest room a family came in mom,dad,son. We were all so outdone and grossed out. The puking was sooo loud and in an empty restaurant??? YUCK!! When the man came from the bathroom after ruining everybody's evening. The owner and his staff rushed him and offered to comp his meal. He actually stayed to order more vomitrocious  food. smh...The staff handled it well as if this had probably happened before or often. I hate to be judgmental but if you like this place you couldnt know good cuban food. Anywho. Stay away from this joint. its nasty and you might regret it......",-0.997,0.741,0.071,0.188,0.6313676633444077
2009-08-28,3.0,The food is SABROSO - Service not so much. The waiter was super nice but nice doesn't always get the job done - they really have to focus on timing and efficiency. Two people at our table received their meal first - took another 10 mins to get the next group of plates out and  the last 2 came about 4 mins after that. It would have been great to eat as a group without worrying about our food getting cold.  And the menu - they were out of a handful of items and that's not good! They were worthy of a 3 star because again the food has flavor and the ambiance truly is nice and I have hope for this place. The service needs to get on point asap - and more professionalism would go a long way. Not you place the order and as the dishes are about to come out you have someone who is not your waiter come up and ask what you ordered again.   I am a customer who appreciates consistency. The first time I went to this place - it was only 2 of us and it was a great experience and based on my recommendation the group I was with all came to try and it and it just wasn't up to par - it made a nice place look bad.,0.9918,0.772,0.196,0.032,0.6233333333333333
2009-08-18,5.0,"omg sooooo delicious!  I ordered the Ropa Vieja. which has some amazing flavors (served with beans ,rice and plantains.) So tender and juicy the meat was. OH! And the plantains were probably THE BEST I have ever had, seriously. Lightly fried and mashed potato-y on the inside. I could eat that everyday.

2009-08-11,4.0,"This review about Siboney has nothing to do with Kuma's Corner except for the fact that the reason we ended up at Siboney is because of the 2.5 hour wait at Kuma's.  2.5 hours at 8 pm on a Wednesday night?  I like a fried egg in my burger as much as the next guy but that's just crazy (only thing crazier: the people who are actually willing to wait the said 2.5 hours). Anyway, back to Siboney.  So after leaving Kuma's, we made our way to Siboney as that was the fallback plan in case the wait at Kuma's was ridiculous.  In a way, I'm glad our plans to eat at Kuma's fell through because our meal at Siboney turned out to be quite good.  Food-wise, here's the rundown: * Tostones (fried plantains) - Tasted pretty much like what I expected.  The garlic mojo that came with it was tasty. * Croquetas De Jamon (ham croquettes) - Good flavor with a flaky crust.  The accompanying aioli went well with it. * Paella de Mariscos  (seafood paella) - My fiancée thought it was a little salty but I thought it was quite excellent.  Large portions with lots and lots of seafood.  One of the better paella's I've had in awhile. * Pork chops (forgot the Spanish name) - The flavor was good but the meat seemed more like ham than actual pork chops.  If I wasn't a fan of ham, I probably would've been disappointed.  Fortunately, I like ham. FYI - Siboney is BYOB (no corkage fee) and there is a liquor store across the street and little bit north of the restaurant that has an impressive selection of booze.     Service at Siboney was top notch - friendly and efficient without being intrusive.  Since my fiancée and I were dining with another couple who we hadn't seen in awhile, we ended up chit chatting and catching up for quite some time,  well past their 10 PM closing time.  The nice folks at Siboney were totally cool with it and never did/said a thing to rush us out.  Good food, friendly service, reasonable prices - not too shabby, if you ask me.  The next time we get a hankering for Cuban food, we'll definitely make our way back to Siboney.",0.9972,0.768,0.199,0.033,0.5467181467181467
2009-07-25,5.0,"It's been my personal dream to live in Cuba and soak in the sun all day. Because I am stuck in Chicago and love to find authentic Cuban cuisine and friends who enjoy the island life as much as I do.  Siboney recently opened in my neighborhood which is full of Miami Cuban (Like Tex Mex to true Mexican food) restaurants. Siboney in a very short time has become not only my favorite Cuban restaurant, but my ""must eat at"" place every week. The Ropa Veija is fantastic and the bisteca is beyond. While this place is still a BYO- take advantage!! Danny's is right across the street and you can ask Mike for a wine reco.  The other night, I took a group of friends for a week night meal. We ate like kings and queens for $25 a head. That included several appy's, huge main plates and after dinner espresso.  Unlike other reviewers, I always have a great time at Siboney. The wait staff is always attentive and willing to recommend dishes. The owners have beautiful personalities and make you want to sit down with them and share a bottle of wine.  Huge plus, the decor is immaculate. The subway tiles, dark woods, and granite pieces make this place look like a high end restaurant. It's been a true pleasure watching the outdoor mural come to life on the side of the building.  Good luck Siboney! You will see me again and again.",0.9967,0.739,0.249,0.012,0.5629312169312171
2009-07-24,4.0,"Not sure what happened between the server and Charle W. to cause the review posted on 7/21 but four of us went to Siboney for lunch on 7/23 and couldn't of had much of a better experience for a new restaurant less than 5 weeks old.  There are some pretty serious reviews on this site and some very well-intentioned feedback that hopefully the owners take seriously. Four of us had lunch at Siboney this past week. We did get introduced to Julio there and because we are Cuban-Americans (but in no way related to or had even heard of the owner before that day) we do feel a sense of pride in the owner's ability to build a great looking place that has some very good dishes. It has some small areas that could be improved but he seemed very willing to take suggestions.  Our server was friendly and experienced. Because we know the food we had no issues ordering but it is important that all of the servers be very knowledgeable about Cuban cuisine in order to help non-Cubans when they order or have questions.  Atmosphere and ambiance are on par or better than any mid-priced fashionable Chicago restaurant of any cuisine style. Siboney is much, much, nicer than all of the other Cuban restaurants we've been to in Chicago, most of which can feel quite dumpy. Fine dining? It should not be described that way because the prices are nowhere near fine dining levels and I wouldn't expect or want that kind of service. The murals on the wall, the ceiling fans and the lovely chairs and table in the waiting area are all very inviting.  The bread was warm and the pieces of light French/almost Cuban-like bread were toasty but I missed the very traditional garlic butter that is normally toasted onto the slices - here they offered a garlic spread on the side which might be more refined but not traditional.  The frog leg appetizer was delicious as well. Unfortunately although the croquettas were very crispy, the fillings need a lot more ham or red snapper flavor and more visible chunks of the primary protein component.  If you are a foodie and really know Cuban cuisine then you'll find the Cerdo Estofado (a stew-like bowl of braised pork with a velvety sauce), to be a flavorful and lighter alternative to traditional Masas De Puerco (garlicky chunks of pork that are lightly fried). The Masas were available as an appetizer portion and highly recommend ordering them that way so you can enjoy other dishes. Make sure they bring them with a little bowlful of the garlic mojo which is great and very traditional to serve with Tostones (flattened fried green plantains), Masas de Puerco, actually with almost any savory Cuban dish!  The Bistec a la Palomilla was the best dish ordered (we only tried 4) with great caramelized onions and characteristic garlic and seasoning profile that was very authentic. The Ropa Vieja was also very good with nicely shredded beef and a delicious sauce of peppers, tomatoes and onions. The traditional Cuban Sandwich had exactly what it should have on it (bread, mustard, pickles, roast pork, Swiss cheese and ham) and it was crisp on the outside and warm and melted on the inside with very good flavor.  The Frijoles Negros were good, and tasty enough for most people but for those of us who make them often they could use a bit more sweetness, vinegar, and sofrito (the delicious flavoring mixture of sautéed peppers, onions, garlic, bay leaves, oregano etc...) that adds 90% of the flavor to Cuban black beans.  The Frijoles Colorados (red beans) were very good with a vibrant red brick color and traditional flavor profile. The Platanos Maduros were perfectly cooked slices of tender, sweet, ripe plantains.  The desserts are a mixture of traditional Cuban and attempts to bridge simple Cuban items with French - the crème brulee style custard is not a traditional flan - this one is creamy and has nice vanilla flavor and looks like an attempt to make people comfortable who know Crème Brulee and don't know flan. The Pudin Diplomatico is a traditional, dense and raisiny bread pudding that is served cold. Don't expect a warm temperature or light texture. The star of the desserts is the Torrejas. Here they add a few small chunks of pineapple to the light and slightly cinnamon flavored syrup in which pieces of egg soaked, grilled bread slices are bathing. Delicious! Keep in mind these are also served cold - Cuba is in a warm climate so warm desserts are not common.  The traditional Cuban ""Cortadito"" was made for us because we asked for it but it is not on the current menu - espresso plus sugar and a touch of milk - served in a demitasse cup. They also offer decaf espresso as well. We can't wait to go back and try many more items. Give them a chance - maybe wait another month to let them work out any new restaurant issues if you expect perfection - but if you like Cuban cuisine and can see the potential beyond a few imperfections, do try Siboney.",0.9996,0.783,0.195,0.023,0.5732172312906259
2009-07-21,1.0,"Siboney was a great disaster. We've gone to a couple of other Cuban restaurants and were eagerly anticipating the opening of this one. A couple of friends and I went to Siboney for dinner with another friend and, boy, were we in for it. We were all starving and eager to order.  All of us being Spanish speakers, were able to decipher the menu, but our waitress couldn't  understand what we were ordering. The items we asked for were on the menu! We had to point-and-choose which wouldn't have been so bad had she gotten our orders right. We had the misfortune of being seated beside a table of a person she knew, which meant that our table was virtually ignored the entire night. And the awkward owner who'd been ""patrolling"" the almost empty restaurant waited for a few tables to be seated before us to eventually greet us.   We went on either their first or second opening week so there were no poultry-only options whatsoever so I was forced to order a few sides which is fine since I'm a veggie lover, too (I like seafood, but I wasn't in the mood). My Cuban friend ordered congris and I ordered Moros y Crisitanos which are supposed to be red beans + rice and black beans + rice, respectively. When the dishes arrived, they brought us both Moros y Cristianos. We let the aloof waitress know and she took one bowl away. When the new beans finally arrived they'd brought us the same thing! We alerted the waitress who we thought didn't understand because of the snafu with the menu earlier and she called the owner who picked up the beans and said:   ""Congris. Congris!"" while holding a bowl of moros y cristianos in front of us. Aside from being really demeaning and uncalled for, he was completely wrong and he knew it. We'd called earlier and he'd even said something to us about being Cuban. We wouldn't have minded him telling us that they were out, but to try and intimidate us into believing that we were eating something we weren't... Come on.  We eat Cuban all the time. My Cuban friend, N, called her grandmother just to make sure she wasn't going crazy. She wasn't.  Congris = red beans. Moros y Crisitanos = black beans. The worst offense came when my friend bit into her dish (a perversion of a chicken cordon bleu, but with chicken as well as pork) and to her amazement realized her pork was completely raw. R-A-W. We brought it to the owner's attention who finally seemed genuinely apologetic about our meal and offered to comp it and bring her a new dish. But what he actually did was discard her side items and bring us her bitten into food that they'd thrown on the grill and brought out  in a to-go plate. She asked if she would get her sides back and he asked, ""Oh, you want those?"" Uh, yeah. Of course, she does.  Despite getting an entree comped, the entire experience was so poor. We ultimately felt unwelcome. The decor was nice, but the food (the full cooked portions) were mediocre, at best, and overpriced.

2009-07-04,1.0,"First of all, the décor, design, etc. is absolutely stunning and certainly more than inviting!  That being said, and taking into account this is a new place, skip it, skip it, skip it.  There are many fine Cuban restaurants in the city, some cheap and outstanding, some pricier and good to exceptionally good, this place is neither!  With the investment clearly made on this place, I would have thought they'd have had a ""soft"" opening and really firmed-up the food, menu, flavoring, service, etc.  Apparently not, the Bolitas de Yuca con Queso and the potato appetizers were a very slight cut above a microwave pizza puff, served with what looked like ranch dressing - eek!  The entrées we chose were only slightly better, my Wife's Churrasco Argentino con salsa chimichurri was an unseasoned flank steak that was so bland it needed to be doused with salt (**Disclaimer, we usually are not salt users at all, but will gently use it if necessary, rarely, however, in a ""fine"" restaurant!) to make it edible, our friend's Ropa Vieja was simply tough and chewy, not tender and melt in your mouth as it should be.  I had the Enchilado de Camarones, which actually tasted nice other than having to eat it with my fingers to remove the shells at the tails.  One huge point here, the beans were bland, bland, bland and, again, required copious amounts of salt.  My Wife, who is South American and has grown-up cooking/eating/enjoying beans, was amazed that the kitchen would even consider putting out such unsavory legumes. Again, this place is brand new, wait staff needs to be educated on the dishes and, at least, try what they're serving, the menu has all of the expected dishes, but c'mon flank steak for a churasco, I'm quite sure it's supposed to be a strip steak, regardless have you sampled your own food?  And, don't get me started again on the beans! Bottom line, and as we discussed after leaving Siboney last evening, in Chicago you get one chance, there's simply too much choice out there and if you don't impress the first time, there won't be a second.   We wanted to like it, it's near enough to walk to and we love Cubano  - sorry!  To the owners/investors: Have you tasted your food, did you have a soft opening, were/are you ready to open, what was the consensus?  A shame, especially for such a beautiful place!",0.9904,0.832,0.131,0.036,0.5575022713911602
2009-07-02,2.0,"I am so surprised that this place received such high reviews. I am of Cuban descent, my mother and abuela came from Cuba over thirty years ago. Since I was a child, I ate authentic Cuban food. I visited this place last week and was horribly disappointed. Number 1: The two most prominent types of meats in Cuban food are pork and fish. There was only ONE type of fish, the Huachinango (Red Snapper). Although a famous Cuban dish, it is huge and expensive. There needs to be more fish variety, I was actually went there expecting to order fish. Number 2: Even though our waitress was nice, she didn't know Spanish! When I said the title of my main course, she had to look at my menu to know what I was referring to! I don't care what ethnicity my waitress is, but she should know the authentic names of the dishes! It is an insult to the culture either wise. I ordered the pork medallions with white rice, yuca, and black beans. While I will say that the pork was cooked well, the black beans had no flavor. They had no seasoning. Where was the cilantro, onion, salt, even a little bit of goya? The yuca was standard, not really difficult to prepare. My boyfriend ordered the chicken with tomato broth and potatoes, the sauce had no flavor, it tasted bland. My mother has prepared both dishes many times and they taste much better than the sub-par food served here. I'm not trying to sound too harsh but I think the only people who give this place good reviews are ones who know little about good and authentic Cuban food and culture.
