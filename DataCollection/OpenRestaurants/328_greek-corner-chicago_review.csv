2017-01-08,1.0,"I want to preface this by saying this is the first sub-4 star review I have ever felt compelled to write.  I was astounded by the treatment I received at this neighborhood restaurant. A few days before Christmas, I was on a jog heading north on Damen and turned onto Augusta when I slipped on black ice on the sidewalk and fell, smashing my head on the sidewalk directly in front of the entrance to this restaurant. I instantly had swelling and bruising on my eye and cheekbone and was extremely lucky the fall didn't cause even more severe injuries.  As I picked myself up, I noted that you could not tell that the area where I fell was covered in ice. While I was walking away, a bystander who saw me fall encouraged me to go into the restaurant to advise them of the ice patch.  Still stunned from the fall, I entered the restaurant, intending to advise them of the black ice so that no one else would fall like I did. I would preface this by saying the area by my temple, eye and cheekbone had already swelled to nearly a golf ball size & was dirty, along with the left side of my clothes from slipping on the sidewalk. When I entered the restaurant, the exchange that took place was as follows: Me: ""Hello - can I speak to a manager?"" Old woman behind the register: ""About what?"" Me: ""I just slipped on black ice outside the door & hit my face on the sidewalk... you need to put down some salt"" Old woman: ""We did put down salt"" Me: ""Well, you clearly need to put down more because I just slipped directly outside the door! Look at my face!"" Old woman: ""You need to be more careful"" Me: [realizing that not only were they not going to rectify the situation, but also she didn't care that I fell] ""That's really nice for your customers and neighbors"" & walked out the door. While I was not entering the business to get sympathy, not a shred of concern was shown - I simply went in to advise the business that on behalf of their neighbors and patrons, there was a dangerous patch of black ice at their entrance & I was trying to prevent other people from getting hurt. I actually thought I was doing them a favor, as a more litigious person could have easily filed a lawsuit for negligence - especially after that exchange. I guess it makes it easier to know which local restaurants to support [not this one!]",0.8608,0.859,0.085,0.056,0.462687969924812

The gyro meat is tasty. The pita is rubbery, no crunch/char on the outside. The skordalia looks like some sort of slush and there's no garlic taste whatsoever. The fries look and taste generic.

He also tried the Greek potatoes and really liked them but I was so busy stuffing myself with Greek fries that I didn't get a chance to try them! We also tried the Skordalia (sp?) which was okay but kind of lacking oomph. I've had something similar before (that restaurant only called it garlic spread so maybe this is a case of mistaken identity) so I was hoping for more of a garlic kick!

2015-12-16,4.0,"Greek Corner is not a fancy restaurant. You come here when you have a craving for gyros. It's as simple as that. The entire menu is pretty easy to process. You have lamb, chicken, beef, and vegetarian options which surround pairing them with feta, lettuce, tomato, bread and potatoes in some kind of way. I should come back for the chicken, but my loyalty to standard gyros and fries is strong when I rush any Greek restaurant.  There is something about a gyros sandwich that makes me wonder why I am not eating them at least once a week. I like a side of mayo and ranch along with my tzatziki sauce, but Greek Corner does not offer them. I didn't get too worked up, but I needed an extra tzatziki for the fries. I'm not a fan of the fact that they charge for it either. The pita bread is the perfect texture: crispy on the outside, with a chewy center. The bread isn't dry and that speaks volumes when I'm missing my extra sauces.  My friend had the Olympic Gyros, and I almost wish I had ordered them. It was basically the same thing I got, but everything was tossed together and served like an amped-up salad. She demolished it in no time flat. Both of us didn't really speak much while we dined. There was a 9pm closing time to consider, but we had also been drinking. Drunk munchies had taken hold of our bodies and it wasn't going away until our bellies were full.  I was curious and drunk hungry, so I ordered a side of avgolemono soup. Try pronouncing that when you've been drinking. I wasn't a fan. Too much lemon zest, and the starchy flavor of the rice seemed to overpower any indication that this soup was made with chicken broth. I must say there are a few Greek-owned/operated 24-hour diners that make this soup better. I would definitely rinse the rice before cooking it, and then I would use mostly chicken broth to cook the rice and boost chicken flavor.    The staff was very polite and they were accommodating to our hunger despite our late arrival. I tried to make up for it by leaving a tip. This restaurant is sparkling clean and that shows me management runs a tight ship. I can't wait to come back and try the pizza! It looks delicious.

2013-05-16,3.0,"This qualifies, to me, as a ""good food quickly"" sort of place.  I have no idea about authenticity of the plates they offer, but they also offer a fair amount of typical diner/grill sorts of food such as burgers, hotdogs, beefs, etc.  The majority of the menu is Greek, but they also have ""Chicago Favorites"" I've only tried a few of the Greek dishes.  The Grecian chicken everyone raves about is good, but comes out suspiciously fast.  You can tell the chicken, although seasoned nicely and tender off the bone, is probably premade and kept in a conventional heater.  The potatoes it comes with are also obviously pre-made, I understand this stuff has to be made in advance to some capacity, but it 'cheapens' the dish a little bit.  Having said that, I understand this isn't a fancy restaurant, so for what you get it's actually not bad.  The gyros are okay... I've had better elsewhere, but you get a huge serving of the stuff so your buck goes a long way.  It's probably sharable to be honest. As for the burgers, they're actually half decent.  Nothing fancy or gourmet, but they are actually grilled and they do it to order so nothing is pre-made and kept in plastic steaming trays.  When I come here, I often come for a quick burger.  Pretty cheap, and satisfying enough.",0.9886,0.817,0.162,0.021,0.5720982142857142

For the last several years, I've been a regular customer here, though I have always gotten my food to-go. I always order the ""Gyro Plate"" .. which is basically a gyro, with a side, and a small salad.  Never before had a problem with this order, and liked the gyro. Last night, I ate in the dining room for the first time. Again, I ordered the Gyro plate. However, this time - the ""gyro"" did not come as a gyro .. but rather shaved meat with like small pita chips. I guess I was expecting the gyro to be like every other gyro I've ever had in my entire life .. packed in a full peice of pita. This ""gyro plate"" came with like 8 dorito-sized pita chips .. So - I don't get it? I'm supposed to make 8 tiny mini-gyro wraps? Anyways, I asked the lady behind the counter if I could just get one full piece of pita bread for my gyro meat. She just gave me a weird look and said plainly ""this is how it comes."" Realizing she wasn't gonna make any effort whatsoever to give me a piece of pita bread, I left.  So I don't understand how the Gyro Plate arrives differently if you eat-in versus getting it for carry-out. I also don't understand why she couldn't just give me a one piece of pita bread..

2007-04-06,4.0,"Despite the fact that this place seems to be open whenever they feel like it, they have great gyros (or gyro plate).  The meat was really tender, the toppings were fresh and the tzatsiki was tasty.  They have an extensive menu, but I haven't ventured beyond the gyros.   The outdoor patio is fun, although it feels a bit like being in a zoo.  I suppose they have to keep the gate high so no one steals their day-glo palm tree.  Service is fine, but is it weird that the guy behind the counter asked me if I wanted to fill out an application?",0.4862,0.77,0.137,0.093,0.5223333333333333
2007-04-05,3.0,"I hadn't been to Greek Corner for over a year, but I went there tonight with Ginny. It's nice having a greek place in the neighborhood, but is it a fantastic eatery? Nope. Is it affordable filling Greek food? Yep! The chicken souvlaki sandwich is pretty good. There are nice big juicy pieces of chicken on a skewer as well as lettuce, tomato, onions and tsatsiki. The tsatsiki here tastes like they use sour cream instead of yogurt, which is a bit odd bu it tastes alright. The spanakopita here is fine, but I always forget how average it is and I end up ordering it again. During the summer it's nice since they have a patio. As for decor inside, they have a weird frog fountain with no water in the middle of the room.",0.9835,0.695,0.241,0.064,0.5416666666666666
