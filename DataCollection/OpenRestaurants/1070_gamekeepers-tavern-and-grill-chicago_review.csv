2017-07-07,1.0,"Absolutely horrendous experience. A friend and I stopped in for a drink the night before the 4th of July. We sat at the bar, and after waiting a couple minutes (which we expected due to the crowd), the bartender asked us what we would like. My friend ordered a vodka Red Bull and I ordered a dirty martini up. When I said ""up,"" the bartender literally-I shit you not- looked up at the ceiling because he had no idea what that meant. He then replied saying he'd have to ask if they could make a martini. Somewhat understandable. He then took an order from the man next to us for a round of shots. Minutes later, he put what looked and tasted like a vodka soda in front of us, but no martini. He then went on to serve other people at the other side of the bar, not addressing my martini or the man next to me's shots. After being unable to get his attention for about 10 minutes, I flagged down a different man behind the bar, with whom I discussed my missing martini, the incorrect drink given to my friend, and the man next to me's shots that had never been poured. He said that he had told the other bartender that they could not make a martini- (although the other bartender did not address this with me) so I ordered a Tanqueray and tonic and he poured my friend an actual vodka Red Bull (having us pay for both) and attended to the man next to me. At that point, I figured the service had turned around and I could forget about the mishaps of the previous bartender. However, I took a sip of my gin and tonic and it tasted like dirt. I saw the bartender pour the Tanqueray, so I assumed the tonic was outdated or flat. I had my friend taste just to make sure I wasn't going crazy. So the original bartender came back around and at that time I was beginning to say how it didn't taste right when he interrupted me mid-sentence and said ""if you're not going to order a drink, then I need you to shut the fuck up."" I was absolutely flabbergasted. It took me a few seconds to process what he said, and at that time I asked for his manager. He stared blankly at me, so I repeated myself saying if you're going to speak with me like that, then I'd like to talk with your manager. The man behind the bar who had gotten our drinks came over and said ""what do you want?"" to me and my friend. I told him that from the beginning, we had received poor service and I was simply stating that my drink tasted strange and that his bartender had the audacity to tell me to ""shut the fuck up."" The manager spoke to me as if he had never dealt with a customer- let alone an unhappy one- in his life. He stood up for the bartender, never apologized for the numerous mishaps on their account, and instead talked over me, repeatedly saying ""you listen to me"" while cutting me off. The man said he ""did not care what I had to say."" And when I asked him ""as a manager of this bar, you don't care what your customers have to say?"" he responded ""no I don't give a fuck."" At that point I told him I would be spending time on every review site writing about my experience so that others can avoid this place at all costs. Maybe when he sees that business is actually affected by the customer's opinions and online reviews, as a manager he will start to ""give a fuck.""",-0.9362,0.831,0.069,0.1,0.4134920634920635

2017-04-25,4.0,"I stumbled upon Gamekeepers during the final four game of March Madness.  Gamekeepers identifies itself as a UNC bar so we had to watch the UNC game at this bar. The bar is massive so it comfortably fit the huge crowd that was jam packed into the bar. When you thought there wasn't space because of everyone crowding the front room there was another room in the back with ample space.  I can't comfortably rate the price of the drinks because I'm not sure if they were overpriced because of the game or if that's the normal price for their drinks. Either way, the drinks were pricey but they were serving the beers/ciders in a UNC cup that was at least 20oz or larger so it was worth the price!  They have ample tv's and a fair amount of tables so I could definitely see myself coming back to watch other sporting events.

2010-11-21,2.0,"Coming from Buffalo, I have been craving a whole mess of chicken wings on the cheap.  A quick googling and yelping led to Gamekeepers as the best deal on Thursday at 10c a wing.   It would be a stretch to call their wings ""jumbo,"" but they also weren't tiny either.  In terms of quality they were passable.  The first batch we had were a little bit overdone, resulting in a pretty good crispy outside but too dried out inside.  Our next round weren't as crispy and the inside was a little dense, possibly underdone.  Granted, at that point it was quite busy so they were probably trying to their wings in and out as fast as possible.  We tried their hottest and second hottest sauces which were hot and flavourful without being just hot.  The fact that it wasn't drowned in sauce helped out a lot, too.  We also got a few beers and it looks like they have quite a selection.   Food alone would get a three but we had some problems.  The problem was with the place itself.  As a former waiter/valet I can understand and am willing to forgive problems with service generally.  However, Gamekeepers really ruffled our feathers.  They advertise their special on Yelp and their website as ten-cent jumbo wings on Thursdays.  Even in the place itself there are banners and advertising that have the same special.  After we had already sat down we double-checked on the special and they told us that it was 10c wings BUTTTTTTTTTTTT for every 20 wings you had to get $9 worth of drinks.  When we pointed it out to our server (Chris, also a bartender) that all the ads in the bar and their website didn't mention that he got defensive and snapped back ""well, the website hasn't been changed in ages [indicating that they know they are being deceptive] and it says prices subject to change anyway [it doesn't].""  Reluctantly we ordered.  When he came back I tried to smooth things over saying that it wasn't a big deal but we just would have liked to know.  While I was hoping that he would be able to be more reasonable and cut us a deal if we got a few beers (we wouldn't be able to keep us as we planned to try and eat 50 wings each) he just continued to be lippy and rude.   In the end, even if you just pay for the booze and don't drink it, the wings are still 55c each, which isn't that terrible.  I am just furious that they would knowingly use deceptive advertising to get customers in.  It could also be a real shocker for a large group that finds out after the meal that now they need to cough up $9 for each 20 wings or start drinking like crazy.   SUMMARY:  meh food and meh atmosphere are not balanced out by DECEPTIVE and INTENTIONALLY FALSE advertising...The bottom line is that there really isn't a reason to go to this bar when other places have equally o.k. wings at cheaper prices.   N.B.  I also intend to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau (BBB).   If anyone else has been ripped-off by their tactics, please feel free to contact me for information about how to also officially have their voices heard.",0.9788,0.826,0.108,0.066,0.453851943076081

2008-06-13,1.0,"Look, I know it's Gamekeepers and no one goes there expecting five star food or service, but common courtesy would be appreciated. Our volleyball team went here on a thursday night after a game and proceeded to have one of the worst bar experiences of my life. It started off bad, and went downhill from there.  First off, on Thursdays during the summer every table in the place is ""reserved"" for softball teams...wtf?  Only softball? There are plenty of other sports that play at neighboring North Avenue Beach, but those of us that don't wield a bat and wear ugly uniforms don't deserve to drink crappy cheap beer and wings?  Whatever, we took one of the few open tables in the very hot back corner because we were starving and we were supposed to be meeting some friends later there who do have that golden softball status. The special on Thursday night is $8 pitchers of Bud Light and 20 cent wings. A few of us ordered 20 wings to share, and the rest of the table ordered a variety of chicken wraps. The waitress didn't have much to say other than ""How many pitchers do you want?"".  Now, I am not exaggerating when I say that forty minutes later...we received two correct wraps, two sandwiches that were supposed to be wraps, and no wings, awesome. And the waitress set everything down so quickly that we didn't even have time to tell her that there was a mistake with the sandwiches, we had to go find her and tell her. So she took the sandwiches back and claimed it would just be a minute while the cooks remake them...also, our wings would be right up, as she didn't know what had happened to them. Cut to ten minutes later when we can see the sandwiches still sitting in the window not being remade. One guy from our table walks over to the waitress and asks her what the deal is, she says she doesn't know, she thought they were remaking them...um, clearly they aren't because they are still sitting right there in the window.  So my friend just takes the sandwiches out of the window and says ""forget it"" because we are all literally about to start eating our arms at this point we are so hungry. Also....still no wings. Cut to a HOUR AND A HALF after we first ordered 20 freaking wings, and I am pissed. We are sitting right by the kitchen, and can clearly see that the two poor cooks (way to staff up for a busy night by the way) are more or less shitting wings out of this kitchen, yet none of them are ours, really?  Exasperated, I went to find the manager who was hanging out by the bar. He was actually pretty responsive as I explained about the wrap and wing situation we were currently in the middle of. I go back to the table and the waitress comes over to tell us that they are remaking our wraps right away...What?!? We don't want the stupid wraps, that is not at all what we want, we are already eating your crappy sandwiches instead of wait for wraps...all we want is 20 WINGS, HOW HARD CAN THAT BE! EVERY OTHER TABLE SURROUNDING US HAS FINGERS COVERED IN DELICIOUS BBQ SAUCE, THAT IS ALL WE WANT!! GIVE ME SAUCE FINGERS!  She says she had put our wings order back in, they should be up any minute, mind you, this is like the third time she had said this, so as my friend is trying to explain that she has already told us this three times, the table next to us gets their wings, and these people had shown up a good hour after we did. We tell her we don't even want the freaking things anymore, just give us the check, and we aren't paying for the sandwiches.  She tells both me and my friend that we are ""being ridiculous"". Are you serious? Look, I know she is busy, but there is no excuse for this...you don't tell your customers that they are ridiculous when you have clearly messed up. You apologize for the mess up and bust your ass to make it right. I have waitressed in the past, and I have had some ridiculous customers, but I would never say that to anyone. Oh, it's on at this point. The manager comes back over and says the wings are coming right up, wow, that's sounds familiar. We tell him we don't even want the wings anymore, just the check to get out of this hellhole. He says they will give the wings to us to go. Fine, whatever, that's all I want is to go. So we get the check, and the wings to go, all in all about an hour and forty minutes after we first ordered. They did comp the wings and the sandwiches, but in my opinion, after being insulted by the staff, and the ridiculously long wait, they should have comped all the food.

2007-05-28,2.0,"I must have been having some type of college flashback this weekend as this was another one of those type of bars that I haven't been to in years. Gamekeepers, on a holiday weekend, was like a ""girls gone wild"" movie.  The place was packed- we got to meet lots of people just because we were standing so close to them I could have drank their drinks!   The bartenders were doing their best to keep up and they were actually pretty cool about all of it.  It was noisy, the floor was sticky and the bathrooms . . .well. . . let's just say that the bathrooms had to be some of the worst I had ever seen.  People!  There is a reason that the ladies and men's rooms have doors on them- keep them shut- we really don't need to share our business with each other!   Lots of TV screens with lots of games.  We finally found a table in the back and other than it was about 100 degrees back there - we actually managed to have a good time.  The drinks, once we got them, were good and I must be a grownup as I got mine in a real glass while others in our group were drinking out of plastic. I think it could be a fun place on a day that there was a game on that I cared about since now my expectations of the place have been set.  But I don't think anything will ever help those bathrooms other than a big can of disinfectant and doors that close!",0.9719,0.856,0.115,0.029,0.41973684210526313
2007-05-28,4.0,Always a good time. If you go when there isn't a game or before midnight you might be the only people in the bar. The food is decent (good fries) and the beer is cold. Our waiter was really good about filing up our water and asking if we wanted more beer. Usually a dollar or two cheaper than the other LP places. Its pretty big with two different rooms. I hate places with the bathrooms downstairs (dangerous!) and its a little on the dirty side. But otherwise a fun place!,0.7613,0.804,0.131,0.065,0.6106481481481482
