2017-08-26,5.0,"Easily the best meal, and single greatest dining experience I've ever had. I'd never been to a Michelin star restaurant, and had been looking forward to this visit for a while. The service is absolutely A+. The staff moves in perfect symphony as they bring out each course, and clear the last. They were very informative, explaining each dish in great detail. Their wine list was a bit overwhelming. I know little about wine, and it took a bit to figure out something familiar. I highly suggest doing the wine pairing and leaving it up to them. Bill came out to $650 after tip. Well worth every penny.",0.9756,0.789,0.211,0.0,0.559174603174603

2017-07-25,5.0,"***this review is for the dessert tasting menu only*** As I was reading up on articles pon de internet regarding the best desserts in Chicago, I stumbled across a review of Tru's dessert tasting menu. I was mind blown (although I shouldn't have been) that Tru even offered such an experience. Nevertheless I was thankful that I would be able to partake in some aspect of Tru's cuisine without spending over $100.  The dessert tasting included 4 actual courses, with complimentary madeleines and one surprise amuse at the very end of the ""meal."" Totalling just under $55 (including 20% gratuity), this deal is a major steal as far as dining at a restaurant that currently has 2 Michelin stars to its name. When I called to inquire about the reservation for a dessert tasting, I was shocked to find I could partake in the sweets at any time during dinner hours - as opposed to the latest times for dinner that several articles mentioned. Thus, I opted for a 7:30 res. The receptionist gave me the choice of seating in the gallery (lounge area) or the main dining room. If I chose the latter, a jacket was required. Clearly I decided to don my jacket as I never shy away from an excuse to get fancy.  Stepping into Tru was surprisingly thrilling. In fact, other than GT Prime, I can't recall another restaurant in Chicago that literally took my breath away upon first glance. Tru doesn't even feel like a restaurant, rather, a fine, French art museum that serves equally artistic cuisine.  There were sculptures, paintings, and other very abstract and utterly stunning pieces randomly placed throughout the lounge and the dining room. Even the playlist (which I will never stop trying to get my hands on) was stunning. I have never in my life heard sounds like the music played at Tru and I have been on and around stages since the age of 4. A host of servers escorted me to my seat and thus began my ascension into culinary heaven.  I truly loved each and every one of the desserts here: 1) ruby grapefruit + fennel consommé + aged balsamic: tart, bitter, sweet, tangy, spicy all at once. A+mazing. 2) mango + lemongrass + ginger + carolina rice + honey + gold: sweet, creamy, citrus, crunchy. Magnificent.  3) madeleine + orange zest: fresh, warm, fluffy, sweet, zesty. Dangerous.  4) dulche de leche + banana + dark chocolate: chocolatey, bright, dense. Sinful.  5) mignardises: Incredible.  6) chocolate sphere: Holy. Righteous.  After finishing the desserts, I decided I would definitely return again for dinner. If Executive Chef Anthony Martin can blow my mind on desserts alone, I can't imagine the response I would have to his dinner courses.",0.9943,0.794,0.162,0.044,0.5383333333333332
2017-07-11,3.0,"First of all- the service at this place is 5 stars- and it should be- it being a two Michelin star restaurant. The reason I give it 3 stars overall is for the combination of the food and decor/ ambiance of the place- if I'm going to drop over $700 (for two people with the wine pairing) I expect 5 stars across the board (for the service, the food and the ambiance). When you're at a Micheline star restaurant I hope to be on a journey while dining- each course should make you feel a certain way- each dish should open up your palate, the ambiance and decor should make you feel like you're somewhere out of this world~ It may seem like I'm describing a feeling you should have while you're on some kind of ""drug"" but in a way great interesting food should put you on a natural high.  Each dish that came out honestly tasted the same- each protein dish whether it was the scallop, the cod or the chicken all had the same texture and flavor combination. The wine choices that were paired with the dishes didn't do anything to help open up the flavors since the dishes all had the same flavor combination- Favorite- the mussels with green curry, the bread and butter (honestly it's hard to find really really good bread and butter- their butter was extra soft and salty cause of the goat milk) they served the bread during the soup course. I loved the bread so much I asked who baked it- surprise! they don't bake it in house- they get it from somewhere else- that also explains why it was so good-  My all time favorite was one of the last dessert dishes they served - Passion fruit chocolate explosion! It's small but when you pop the chocolate in your mouth the passion fruit juice just explodes in your mouth the and the flavors are amazing! I only wish every dish was this fun  Last but not least- the decor- it's like an 80's hotel lobby and I'm not sure why they have green apples on a shelf and also spot lighted! Are these some special fancy green apples? It's by the hostess stand- I was perplexed when I saw three green apples lined up on a shelf.  Also something that felt awkward was the presentation of the bowl that was filled with shredded white paper where the passion fruit chocolate sat on- I'm a visual person so plating and ambiance is really important to me- not everything has to presented with fireworks but if you're going to go simple then the food better be amazing so I can only focus on the food  So- If you're going to drop over $700 for dinner- I suggest you try Alinea, Orioles, Grace, or El Ideas first- I've been to all of them and you won't regret it!",0.9985,0.779,0.197,0.024,0.5207407407407406
2017-07-02,3.0,"Maybe it was just the prix fixe menu we got during the spring of 2017 or the expectation of a meal worthy of 2 Michelin Stars, having been to a few 2 and 3 Michelin star restaurants in New York and Europe; but the overall food was underwhelming and could use a much more diverse array of flavour profiles Don't get me wrong, the service was amazing, but the food has lots of room for improvement. The website set us up for a disappointment. It showcased plates that were deceptively beautiful and potentially delicious (you eat with your eyes first), but the actual food we received was far from expectation. For those avid Instagram foodies out there, this menu was not gram-worthy haha Came here with my fiance and we shared everything. You'll definitely be full after the full prix fixe menu which costs $158 USD per person - one of the more ""affordable"" tasting menus if you can call it that :) amuse bouche: started with a complimentary biscuit and puffs of some sort. presented nicely on some perforated wood, but flavour wise, it was cold and a little dry. would have been nice to have been warmed through. Not exactly a great start to the meal with flat flavours and odd textures. mache, celery, summer truffle, rhubarb: this was actually really good. It was slightly tangy and the celery flavour cut through without overpowering the rhubarb. we enjoyed the mixture of textures and it set our expectations for the meal high.  complimentary bread & goat milk butter: this was pretty good! a small fresh loaf of in-house made bread was provided alongside a dish of homemade goat's butter. butter was delicious and was very generously provided (for those who like to slather it on) english pea soup, créme fraiche, brioche: a little too salty, but to each their own. nice refreshing pea flavour. Fiance enjoyed the brioche which came topped with a fois gras mousse. It was quite rich but also quite tasty. aromatic mussel velouté, green curry: Nice seafood flavour that is presented well. very reminiscent of the ocean - I enjoyed it, fiance found it too salty  diver scallop, lily bulb, yuzu koshu sauce: good combination, with a nice citrus touch from the yuzu sauce. really enjoyed this. scallop was perfectly cooked. roasted halibut, barigoule sauce, parsley: fish was very well cooked (i.e. not overcooked) with a good sauce to accompany it. enjoyed this dish. veal tournedos:  this dish was OK. it came with a jus that had some tapioca pearls in it, as well accompanied by a root mash of some sort. It really wasn't anything special and really missing a 'zing' factor. Would have subbed this out.. green asparagus + morels in pastry: would say this is where it started to go downhill from a flavour perspective. flavourless and something you would definitely NOT expect to be served at a 2 Michelin Star. No creativity to this dish and horrible flavours. The morels were probably the best part and should have been highlighted better. wheatberry, crisp garlic root, micro scallion: the pictures speaks for itself. it was a bowl of salty mush. would avoid this altogether unless you need an injection of fibre and sodium. ruby grapefruit, fennel consommé, aged balsamic: This was quite good and very refreshing after a pretty salt-heavy meal and rich meal. The acidity was MUCH needed, especially since there was almost zero acidic balance in the previous dishes.  mango + lemongrass + ginger, carolina gold rice, honey: This was actually very good. Really good ginger flavour without being overpowering, and a nice hint of mango and lemongrass. Very light dessert and would definitely recommend. dulce de leche, banana, dark chocolate: This was nice and rich, and was definitely one of the highlights of the meal. Hats off to the pastry chef as the dessert courses were THE highlights of the meal, both taste-wise and visually. Passion Fruit explosion Chocolate: This was THE best part!! There's a few reviews that says how delicious the chocolate at the end, and I couldn't agree more! This comes out on top of a small bowl of dry ice (giving it a smokey effect) with some shredded paper underneath. You are instructed by the server to put it in your mouth in one bite and let it melt. You do this, and you get surprised by a nice burst of fruit juice that is not too sweet and blends perfectly with the thin dark chocolate coating. yum! Petits Fours: This was okay. Something nice to throw in at the end... came with a jelly, which was way too sweet (reminded me of a top chef episode where someone made this and came out way too sweet), as well as a small cake and a dark chocolate filled with liquor. Nothing out of the ordinary, and could have had more of a 'wow' factor to leave you wanting more or wanting to come back. Overall, the dining experience was nice, it's a very intimate atmosphere with great, attentive service. However, half the dishes could have used something to make it pop and to really take the flavour profiles to the next level.",0.9998,0.701,0.26,0.038,0.6034247835497838
2017-07-01,3.0,"The restaurant is over priced. My husband and I went there to celebrate a special occasion. For starters, the crowd was kind of sterile and lacked any diversity. The restaurant was also half empty when we went. We didn't think much of these things however, and looked forward to the meal. We got the tasting menu with all the bells and whistles. The best course was the halibut. Some of the courses were extremely salty (such as the veloute). They were salty to the point that we couldn't taste any other flavor. The portions were also extremely small. For example, when we got the scallop course- it was literally just one scallop. Our total bill came to about $450 (without tip). Bottom line is that the food is not that great and the restaurant is sterile. To be honest the restaurant lacks personality. The positive is that it has great artwork and does truly ""feel"" like a 2 Michelin star restaurant.",0.9383,0.825,0.128,0.047,0.573903318903319

Each course contained flavors and textures that complemented one another. I cannot recommend a favorite dish as they were all amazing. If you decide to come here I recommend the entire tasting menu. It will take about 3 hours but well worth it. At the end of the dinner we got the chance to walk through the kitchen where the magic happens.

2017-06-17,4.0,"Tru was a true experience, pun intended.  My wife and I experienced this Michelin 2 star in our neighborhood on her birthday which fell on a Friday in June. Chronologically, the evening started late at 9 pm (but I suspect that is a great time on Friday given the crowd), and we checked in and were swiftly taken to our seat in the center by the booth. My first reaction was that the large room was spacious, elegant, and minimalistIc which forces attention on the service and display of food.  The day before, the restaurant confirmed details and so our menu was customized with a Happy Birthday message to my wife, which she naturally loved (the details matter and Tru did well on this front). We went with the prix fixe menu and selected each item at the start of our dining experience. The one recommendation I have for the staff is a willingness to describe each item in further detail. After all, as an example, many diners will not understand if the aromatic mussel veloute is heavy on the curry or lightly dusted. Selection drives experience so it's imperative the staff assist diners upfront.  Before the multi course meal, we ordered caviar (they have several selections and this is an add on to the menu) and ended up with the smaller portion (10 oz). The caviar was delicious and appropriately, we were given mother of pearl spoons. Thereafter, as our prix fixe initial courses came in, we enjoyed the series that seemed to build up to the mains, the Hallibut and Veal. We went from the bread selection which was accompanied by a nice cows milk and goats milk butter mix with salt, to the aromatic mussel veloute, a soup, to the Hallibut (nice and flaky), to the veal with a creamed fingerling potato mix (really good), to the wheatberry prepared al dente (nice texture as a result), to the ruby grapefruit sorbet (palette cleanser), to the final desert, the dulce de Leche.  Other attributes to note: nice lighting (not too dark - you can see your food and partner), ideal for 2-4 in my opinion, several staff members usher in each course, and the art work is nice and the seats are velvet. Gentlemen must wear blazers or sport coats.  Overall, the presentation was wonderful, the staff was attentive and respectful, and the ambiance was memorable. I look forward to marking future events at Tru.",0.9933,0.872,0.123,0.005,0.6297924297924297
2017-05-31,2.0,"UPDATE: The manager reached out to me and was very apologetic and sincere. He recapped with me what had happened and apologized saying it was unacceptable and an off night for the restaurant. He remembered who we were as he was there the night we dined in and was clearly was aware of the situation when it happened. He assured me that action had been taken with the staff. He offered for us to come back to Tru complimentary and I'm sure it would be a better experience if we did, but I just did not want to go back to the same spot. He offered vouchers to their sister restaurant Everest instead so I accepted that. It's 1 week later and we received vouchers in equivalence for our meal was at Tru. This service and accountability from the managerial position is SO appreciated! Taking that time to understand went wrong directly with the customer and follow through with a solution is Michelin service!  Such a disappointment from the start. My husband and I were looking forward to the culinary experience Tru promised for our anniversary and it fell short of everything from service to food quality. The ambiance was nothing but plain, our main waiter was extremely slow and serious. We ordered an $80 bottle of wine (which was the best part of the meal) and halfway through dinner a random waiter took my husband's empty wine glass away. We were confused so asked the lady who had been serving us wine if it was already gone and she replied yes. Our table was right next to the wine station and I saw her check the bottles and pulled ours out still half full. She did return to apologize about the mixup, but really?! We had to finish much of our wine with dessert since it was missing for so long! I had the regular menu and my husband did the vegetarian, both lacked any sort of flavor. A few dishes were okay but nothing worth this kind of price. To top things off, they skipped one of my husband's courses and it was very clear they realized because 3 people huddled right near us discussing and staring at us for at least 10 minutes. Once they figured out what they missed, a random waiter came to our table saying we have ""an intermittent course"" and then dessert-their way of covering it up. The only 2 memorable things from this dinner was the wine and the cheese, both things we paid extra for (cheese was $20 for a sample of 3). So very disappointed.",0.9498,0.827,0.106,0.067,0.3918543345543346

2017-02-25,2.0,"Walked in at 7pm on a Friday night and the place was half empty. It looked like everybody had come from a funeral b/c the entire room wore black, including us. The restaurant has a 90s vibe with only male staff. Everyone wore black suits. Population was half white, half asian. Typical trendy fine dining crowd. Age range was wide - millennials to boomers.  Our server was nice, but we felt like he mumbled all the course descriptions. We found it amusing he'd start walking while finishing his last sentence for every course. What's the rush? But we are here to talk about food so on to the important things. Taste of food fell short. As in almost to the ground short. Some dishes were severely salty such as the skate wing with wild mushroom, and the wheatberry with garlic root. I must've finished a glass of water with each of those dishes. On the contrary, my bf's venison, while cooked well, was barely seasoned. To give them some credit, I did enjoy the vidalia onion tart. It wasn't special, something you could buy at a fancy French bakery. The ruby grapefruit with fennel consomme and aged balsamic was an excellent palette cleanser. Now that i'm reading the ingredients for this dish, there was certainly a lot of thought put into it b/c of its depth. Desserts were better than the food, and I did like the free little bites of savory and sweet surprises offered throughout the meal which weren't listed on the menu. They gave us a small nicely wrapped piece of cake to take home.  The personalized menu was a nice touch to conclude the evening. Paying close to $400 for two, one would expect great tasting food with a creative spin; unfortunately, we didn't find that at Tru and it was truly a letdown compared to other 2 Michelin star restaurants.  Interesting observation: the NU hospital building seems to be the hub for fine dining. Beatrix for upscale brunch, Tru, and Green River upstairs which is also part of the Michelin portfolio. I suppose that's just the Streeterville/River North hood.  Warning: The attire says evening wear, so I wore a dress, but a short one. Terrible mistake.

Of course there were some parts that were not always amazing, everyone has different tastes, but usually the meal overall was always very unique and very tasty.

The biggest was a few dishes that were heavily over-salted, followed by one that was under seasoned. Seemed like it depended on which chef made your dishes.  Finally, a few service holes. Silly stuff like never getting napkins and getting napkins taken away but not replaced.  Or a wine pairing served far after the dish. Everyone was nice, but just seemed a little spacey at times.

2016-07-22,5.0,"I wish there were more stars. This was one of THE best dining experiences my husband and I have ever had in Chicago.  Before I even start on the food I have to say that the service was THE BEST service we've ever had in our lives. From the wonderful gentleman who sat us to our waiter to the well timed, trained, orchastrated servers. Everything was ON POINT. When we were greeted, the host was kind, considerate, and generous.  After dinner we left through the revolving door and he came out of the restaurant to give us pastries to take home. THEN, as we were walking away from the restaurant, we were a block and a half away, our waiter ran down the street to give us chocolates and pastries that we told him were our personal highlight of the entire meal (cherry basil chocolates and rum cakes). I was speechless. I uttered thank you you're so kind but I was so taken aback by how over the top and generous our server was for doing that. I still can't believe a waiter would run down the street to give us sweets to take home! I hope they do something very special for the servers who were on staff tonight (July 22 Tru).  Ok now to the food. Everything was phenomenal. the maitake crunch (a taste of summer in your mouth), english pea soup with mint and rhubarb, potato puree with truffle (so rich and earthy), spring lamb loin (the egg plan emulsion was decadent), the pork belly (salty rich earthy goodness) blueberry, apple and thai basil palate cleanser (one of the best palate cleansers on the planet - I don't exaggerate - we relished this) and the cherry confit, truffle with chocolate creameaux (there is no comparison it's the most unique dessert I've ever had), mini rum cakes apricot sweets, and cherry chocolate basil truffles (one of the best pieces of chocolate I've ever eaten in my life).  All in all, this was one of the top dining experiences we've ever had - and though I don't post a lot of yelp reviews, we've eaten in Michelin star restaurants all over the world. This was top notch.

The portions are of course small but there were 7 courses and we were full. There was a cheese service before dessert which was actually great.

Made a reservation several weeks in advance because it's not easy to get a table here. They called me a few days before my date of arrival and asked me about my dietary constraints.  I was greeted at he door by a nice gentleman who was expecting me and knew who I was. I was taken to my table right away and he made sure I was comfortable and liked my seat and even asked about the position of the cushion. So nice of him. You got a choice of two prefix menus. One was abbreviated version of the full menu. I decided to go with the full menu in the spirit of YOLO. It was technically a eight course meal but the chef added several courses complementary which was very nice. The food was absolutely amazing in presentation and taste. Highlights include black truffles and a fruit tea in between the savory courses and the sweet courses. The fruit tea came in a test tube looking apparatus complete with a torch.  Service was very nice and attentive. Definitely on the same par level Alinea the street. I'm surprised this restaurant doesn't have more Michelin stars.

2016-03-24,4.0,"I had a great experience at Tru. A few of my friends and I were in town for my birthday and due to poor planning, on Saturday we made a last minute decision to ""eat somewhere good."" My friend, at 3:00 on Saturday, said ""let's go to Tru."" I called and asked if they had any reservations open that night, obviously a tall order - they kindly responded ""Unfortunately we are booked up."" I explained it was my birthday and asked if there was anything they could do, I was put on hold for thirty seconds, and then told they would make room to accommodate the 4 of us that evening. We made our way to Tru that evening, my one friend realizing he had no jacket - no fear though, Tru obliged with a loner. We were then seated in the lounge, we relaxed, chatted, had a cocktail, and then were seated in the dining room. Once entering the dining room, the whole surrounding area exudes class and wealth. There is no question you are at a high-end restaurant where large bills are paid with black cards.  The staff was very warm, welcoming and absolutely not pretentious as the décor may suggest. Though we had made this very last minute reservation, the menu's had ""Happy Birthday Travis"" printed on them, something I always appreciate, especially at restaurants with a Michelin star. As the courses came out, they were expertly explained to us and any questions easily answered. Great wine choices also accompanied our meal. The veal course was easily the most outstanding of the meal, served on a log with a piece of flat glass on top - it looked outstanding as well as it tasted. Cooked a perfect temperature, I absolutely could have had another. There was also a dessert course that came in second as my favorite of the meal. A number of larger monkey statues came out, with the banana ice cream served in each hand with a ""banana peeled."" The texture and flavor was perfect and the best way to end a meal, but not before a small cupcake came out with a candle and 'Happy Birthday Travis' written on the plate, a nice touch to end the courses. Overall, the experience at True was outstanding, most notably being the service. The courses were excellent though lacked anything that really blew me away. 1 Michelin star they certainly deserve, if the Chef were to further push the limits and bring the food aspect up a notch, I would not be surprised for True to receive another star.",0.9959,0.793,0.176,0.031,0.603298611111111

The first time we booked the private dining room, so of course the food was amazing and the service was wonderful. Our server waived our corkage fee after he learned that we just got our marriage license that day (or it could've been because we booked their private dining room).  My favorite is their duck breast, which costed extra from their winter 2014 menu, but it's worth every penny! We tried to get the duck breast again on our second visit, but unfortunately they took it off of the menu. Tru changes their menu frequently, so I highly recommend you ask for their duck breast. Even if they don't offer it at the moment, other main courses are just as good. If your budget allows, don't forget to ask for wine pairing options or wine recommendations. It'll truly elevate your whole dining experience. During my second visit, I told our server that I'd like to go light on alcohol. She recommended one white and one red to go with my dinner. Both were so good that I asked for the details of the wine so I can get them later. I've been to many fine dining restaurants in Chicago, and I have to say Tru is one of my favorites! I like it so much not just because of the food presentation or the creativity that goes behind each dish. They provide very good quality of food, very fresh, and their service is impeccable!

A few stand-outs on the current menu included the first course (a vivid red dish of beet, apple and raspberry) and the second (a barely scrambled egg with white truffle served in an eggshell). I also had a red wine, which was quite dry (not a style I'm overly used to) but was very high quality with a great taste. Service was of a high quality, with the staff answering our queries with depth and confidence.

I sampled the Grand Collection tasting menu and was pleasantly surprised with most of it.   I loved the white sturgeon ""caviar""- I thought that the presentation and flavor was very appetizing.  The avocado hazelnut purée was less than flavorful. The summer tomato salad was beautiful and extremely acidic- a little more salt would have been appropriate but I loved the plating.  Obsessed with the floral artichoke barigoule sauce with orange- so amazing! Crunchy, salty, smooth - delicious and flavorful- probably the best dish of the night! Alaskan halibut with coconut- was sadly a bore.  After 1 bite I decided it wasn't worth the calories and I didn't understand the tropical presentation.  If you are going to lean toward Thai cuisine- give me some heat! It would have been better If it was spicy. The Jidori chicken was perfectly cooked I loved the crispy skins, and asparagus. The cheese selection was way too much fun! And with the help of my server we made a few excellent choices.  He created a honey smothered plate- that rivaled any cheese plate I have had.   Loved the compressed pineapple parfait and banana ice cream- after a heavy meal it was the perfect sweet treat.  Wish the banana cake was warm! I didn't want any of the mignardises- which they sent me home with anyway!

To start the meal, my bottle of Lewis 2011 Napa cabernet was decanted over candle light.   Then the courses began. I will describe those which were highlights through the meal and excited the senses. English pea soup with cured salmon and bacon.  The salmon was cooked slow and low till it was as soft and flavorful as could be. Best mushroom dish and presentation I've ever had. Morels and toasted pecans topped with sunflower sprouts.  Served on a wooden plate made to represent the forest. Sea urchin (uni) and two kinds of caviar - one cured with special salts - on a lobster flan base with Egyptian star flower garnish.  The saltier of the two caviars was the most enjoyable with all the flavored combined together. The scallop topped with an abundance of shaved black truffles and cured Japanese plums smelled and tasted delicious.  Can't go wrong with a lot of truffles!  The texture and savory flavors truly made this one of the best courses of the meal. The halibut arrived on one of the coolest plated I've ever seen - it could have been used as a decoration.  The fish was cooked to an excellent texture, soft on the inside and crispy on top. Ribeye was cooked perfectly sous vide and seared with sunchoke two ways - one crispy and one creamy.  Flavors and textures worked well together to add some sweetness to the saltiness of the steak. One of the desserts came on a bed of confetti with liquid nitrogen oozing out of the dish, quite impressive and made for a fun conclusion.

The duck tasted good but either it was too tough or the knives they supplied were not up to the task. You shouldn't have to struggle to eat your main course, the house specialty.

One time I'll have a three Michelin star experience, the next I can't imagine what they were thinking. On my first visit, every aspect of the food and service was perfect. Upon returning a year later, virtually every one of nine courses was a saucer of goo. A couple years after that we returned to have one of the most visually stunning meals I've had anywhere, accompanied by perfect (and not stiff) service. But my most recent visit was again a disappointment. Aside from a couple of minor elements (walnut bread with the optional cheese course) nothing stood out gastronomically, and the service was stiff even though it was a quiet night. Worst of all was our inability to keep our wine glasses filled with the two expensive Burgundies we ordered. The sommelier placed them on the far side of the room, and then disappeared for fifteen minutes at a stretch. We finally took to just asking passing waiters to refill our glasses. After the  third such time, you'd think someone would have taken the hint. I'm sorry if this seems petty, but when you're spending over $1000 on a dinner for three people, the food and service need to be home runs.

Following is my list of reasons why I will never go back 1. Our assistant waiter was unintelligible . He would explain the dishes and his pronunciation of the dishes was so off we had no idea what we were getting. . Plus his voice was barely audible and we had to ask him to repeat more than once.  2. We were seated right next to the waiters station and could hear the waiters discussions loudly throughout the meal. It was such a distraction. If anything was going wrong with someone else s meal or anything they were talking about we were a part of it.  3. Not once but three times they brought another table's order over to ours  4. They mixed up my order and my husband's order.  5. We had to wait 20 minutes for an explanation of the cheese selection. When the waiter came to explain, he did not know what all of the cheeses were.  6. It was very cold in the restaurant. Upon leaving we mentioned it to the gentleman who worked the front. He was surprised that we were never offered a pashmina.  We did not complain a lot, but I think we must have been apologized at least 20 times thought the meal. I would have preferred less apologies and better service. They did offer us some free drinks, but that was too little too late. When you are spending over $500 on a meal you expect better service.

2015-06-14,3.0,"Yesterday, my friends and I had dinner in TRU at 6pm. Since my friends will leave for China in just few weeks and may not come back in a short term, we did a lot of researches for Michelin restaurants before we booked our dinner in TRU. According to the reviews and comments from yelp, we were very looking forward to this meal.  We arrived there at around 5:50. The receptionist lead us to our table and the server got us some drinks including sparkling water, a coconut mixture and champion. The champion was good. Tasted very fruity, a fantastic women drink; my friend had a glass of coconut mixture. It's hard to tell what other ingredients they use in the drink besides coconut. It tasted weird, like coconut water mixed with some kinds of seasonings. It was not a good experience.  Speaking of the dishes we had last night, there were both merits and demerits. Before we tried TRU, we had a great experience in Grace. They have similar reputation on Yelp, score 4.5/5, despite one is Michelin 3 star while the other is not.  We all had the full menu with duck for the main course which cost $40 each additionally. For the appetizers, I like the smoked salmon steeped in a green soup. The salmon was tender and flavored, and the soup was good if you had some roe with it, it will give you a different taste for both the roes and soup. For the main course, we all had duck because it seemed like the duck was the speciality in this season. It looked brilliant when they showed the whole duck we would had for main course. When the duck was up, it smelled so good that aroused my sense of hunger. The skin was crispy and tasty but honestly I don't like the meat. The meat was raw and it had a special taste that only poultry had it. It's hard for us to eat it up.  This Michelin star restaurant experience is not good or bad but it has been a deliberation for us to give it another try.",0.9921,0.835,0.147,0.018,0.5073421676362854

2015-05-26,1.0,"Ok, when we were here 6 years ago, this was a restaurant to be reckoned with.  Tramonto was at the helm and, while some of his dishes were a bit out there, he was really crushing it. This past weekend, my husband was throwing out ideas for a date night and when he suggested Tru, I jumped on it. Unfortunately I didn't check yelp first to see how far it had fallen. The service was a bit odd - as if the staff were uncertain of themselves, or that many were training still.   The sommelier was excellent and knowledgeable. I agree that he tended toward sweet whites, but I still thought most of the wines he chose were very good. What wasn't good?  Almost everything else. The star of the night was the foie gras mousse encapsulated in sugar. Fantastic!  It tasted divine and was plated beautifully with a slice of blood orange and gorgeous flowers. The only other course of note was the morel dish. I should state that the amuse bouche failed to amuse at all. I think there should be a rule that if the amuse bouche is disappointing - you just get up and leave. Everything else suffered from lack of creativity, or lack of cohesion - sometimes both. Also, since when does fine dining involve serving different breads and butter with each plate?  That was, to us, ridiculous. Furthermore, the savory dishes, such as the ribeye (which was bland and somewhat tough) and the halibut (which was boring, plain, and served in far too buttery a broth) were entirely unimaginative and felt like fillers.  The pea soup with salmon confit would have been boring, aside from the salmon being overwhelming. The ramp soup with rice was decent, as was the wheatberry dish... but for this caliber of restaurant (or what it used to be) and the price point, these shouldn't even have been memorable. They only were because everything else was so disappointing. The frozen cider topped with warm tea also just didn't work at all as a dish. Tru really needs to get its act together... Or it isn't going to be on the scene for that much longer.  Even the floors seemed like they haven't been kept up well. I know, a weird statement, but something I noticed. To see how far they've fallen, at least in my opinion, see my previous review.",0.9724,0.754,0.143,0.103,0.6888482834994463

2015-05-08,3.0,"I put a lot of thought into this review, bouncing from a 3 to 4 stars. Ultimately the decor and cost, outweighed the service and food.   The set up is a bit too modern for my taste, modern elegance.  Its also way too formal, anywhere I have to dress up to pay them money, always gets me in a mood.  The atmosphere is big and plain, lots of white, but stuffy. There isn't much to gaze upon, however, the two story windows are mammoth and caught my attention a few times. Service was prompt and knowledgeable and they did all the little things like making our anniversary special with an extra dessert and mentioning it several times. The servers knew the ingredients of the dishes, but didn't show any personality. Too statuesque for my liking.  Nor did they show any personality when asking about preferences on dish choices, have an opinion please.   The courses were mostly well thought out and executed. The only real misses for me were the 1 stalk of asparagus and last savory course. I didn't get the choice of wheat berry after the duck, its just not something I'd want to to eat, despite an interesting flavor. Lastly, when I have French food, I want real foie, a big ole piece. We got an encapsulated mousse, while good, wasn't what I wanted. Bring me back to France.  The morel dish was fabulous, and the duck was succulent and filling.  The food, despite being a little too straightforward and classical to me, was great. I'd like to have seen a little more imagination.  The portions were nice, I walked away full.  Dessert was too plain. Your choices are apple pie or chocolate mousse.  They must have changed pastries chefs because I've had several people tell me how innovative the desserts are.  Its a let down to the meal after the duck.  Luckily the truffle finish was amazing.   The wine pairings were quite excellent. You could tell they were well thought out and complimented the dishes.  If you don't want wine, there are cocktails but I wasn't too excited about the selections. Despite the excellent wines, the pours were very small and did not present a good value at $125.  I could have gotten 5 glasses of wine for that price, and got 5 time as much alcohol, more than enough to light me up or split between 2 or more people.   Despite all these positives, Tru is a once in a life time special event dining experience due to the ridiculous prices.  I would not spend $700 again to eat here, when I can go to 42 Grams, El Ideas, Schwa, Elizabeth etc etc etc for $300-$400. To upcharge $80 to get their signature duck dish, is just a bait and switch to me. I knew about the surcharge coming in, but for the value, it should be included in the main pairing price.   I had a fun time, had a couple very memorable dishes, but its to expensive for what it is and thus cannot recommend.",0.9971,0.802,0.155,0.043,0.4636791383219955

But one star reviews are generally unhelpful tirades, so I bumped Tru up to two stars in hopes of offering a sober review that will help someone else save $500. My wife and I ate at Tru last night. Tru's ambiance is stiff, yes, but that's personal preference. Tru's staff is even stiffer and most appeared fearful for their jobs. Lots of nervous/shaky hands and voices. But again, that didn't bother me much. The fatal flaw with Tru was how pedestrian and forgettable all the dishes were. Despite the flourishes and upcharges, not a single course blew me away. The vaunted duck dish was okay, at best.  To be clear, this isn't a critique of pricing, service or anything other than the taste of the food. Each course was thoroughly underwhelming.  Was it a new chef? An off night? A restaurant in decline? Who knows, but at $250+ a person there's no room for error.  Based on other reviews, Tru is a hit for some people but I'll strongly recommend my friends stay away.

Upon seating, there was a glass plate setting with Tru's logo.  For our table of 6, 4 of the glass plates were chipped on the corners or edges.  For a restaurant that charges $200+ per person, I would expect their logo'd plates to be in perfect condition. 2.  Overall, the wine pairing was interesting and skewed toward sweeter wines.  While I enjoyed it, some of my colleagues did not.  For one of the dish (green asparagus, roasted onion, oxalis), it was paired with a 2011 Coenobium Lazio.  I thought the wine tasted weird, and asked the waiter for more information about the wine.  Instead of getting the sommelier, the waiter mumbled something and left us.   3.  Wait staff was attentive, but rushed to describe the food they were serving.   Anytime they tried to articulate something sophisticated, it felt like they rushed through it so we couldn't ask questions. 4.  We ordered the whole roasted muscovy duck.  When using their silverware, I noticed that the knifes were not sharp at all.  At first, I thought it was the duck that was not well cooked.  After speaking with my colleague, it seems everyone had dull knifes.

It doesn't attract the same buzz as some newer high end places, and it presents a fairly traditional approach to fine dining. No communal table. No open kitchen. No ""wear what makes you comfortable"" dress code. Fine art on the fall. But Tru clearly belongs to the upper echelon of Chicago restaurants and is still going strong even as it closes in on 20 years in business. The food is not avante garde in the same sense as Alinea or Grace but is still fresh, contemporary, and uniformly excellent. The tasting menu is very well balanced--not too many or too few of any particular type of course. We left satisfied but not overstuffed. The wine pairings complemented the food well. Service was exception. When the captain asked my girlfriend if she wanted another glass of champagne, she said yes and joked that she would also like another serving of the very delicious truffled pasta dish we'd just eaten.

Little warm Madeleine's were delicious. Presentation was excellent and all courses had a very refined taste.  With that being said, the first course was a beet sorbet.  Maybe it is my personal opinion based on the fact that beets are good as a small addition to a dish, but it was all full blown beet that's been processed in an ice cream machine with salt (I'm sure there were other goodies mixed in, but the thing did not agree with my palate). The goat cheese pearls accompanying it were wonderful, and so was everything else.  The treat of the night was a heavenly white chocolate truffle with a basil(!) liquid inside.  After dinner we were presented with a personalized menu of the dishes that were served and some desert to take home as a souvenir.  We were very pleased to find it the next morning when coffee got done brewing.

Before we got our check, the valet guys came in and told us that our car key was not responding. Perhaps the battery died, they suggested.  We got the check, got our coats, the manger even talked to us and thanked us. NOT UNTIL WE STEP OUT OF THE RESTAURANT, the manager tried to tell us the car was towed, he said ""I am hoping this is the case"" meaning that he wishes it is not stolen.  Manager asked us to go with the valet guys to the towing pounding area to fetch our car. It was such a mess. And it's late at night you can imagine.  I had to say I was rather disappointed that such a nice restaurant would hire such bad valet service. Well, it is really okay if you can handle it well. We called the manager right after we spent 2 hours getting the car back from the pounding area. Told him that we are disappointed. He said he will call us back in the future to explain, apologize, or whatever he meant. Instead he just NEVER called us back. Till now.  Such a disappointment. I cannot prevent from thinking that they do not care about anything about customer service once you paid the bill.  Sorry. Never ever coming back again. I guess they would not even mind us coming back or not in the first case. We are from California, now residing here in Chicago. I must say place like Addison from the Grand Del Mar, or any Michelin star restaurants we've visited were way more professional in handling issues than this place. I never write reviews, and this just flickers my mind too much that I have to share.",0.6205,0.808,0.104,0.088,0.4737468671679198

2015-01-20,4.0,"It pains me to have to remove a star but they made some changes and to me they were not for the good.  I was happy to see that great photo of the Eiffel Tower return from Paris Club.  We love that picture.   The menu format changed.  There used to be 2 options and while there is a choice to have an abbreviated dinner - there aren't as many choices and its a lot more expensive.  The menu set up is sort of confusing.  You have some options but the way they word it, its difficult at first to tell where you need to decide.  For the meat course the only option that I could get was the chicken for 2 for an extra $50.  I didn't alert them that I don't eat beef or pork before arriving because in the past there were plenty of seafood options.  That being said the chicken was amazing.  All of the food was still amazing.   The other change that we didn't care for is the bread.  They don't come around with the tray where you can pick.  You do get a piece of bread per course but its matched with what you're eating.  You can feel that Gale Gand is no longer there.  Its missing the whimsy.  Also its missing the candy cart that used to come around after dessert.  I loved that cart!!   The service is still very good and helpful.   I feel a little sad that its not what it used to be.  Yes there were changes, and I try to embrace change, but in this case I don't think they're for the better.  For the higher price point I might consider something else.",0.9727,0.755,0.146,0.099,0.6149358974358975
2015-01-18,5.0,"Yup, 5 stars.  Everything from the staff, room, ambiance, service, food, beverages, even parking was excellent.  First, they call you 2 days ahead of time to see if you have any dietary concerns or are celebrating any special occasion.  The valet parking takes your name - no ticket - and when you leave, your car is already waiting.  All this for $14 in downtown Chicago - that's a deal! When we arrived, they greeted us by name and, since we were there for our twins' birthdays, they greeted each of them by name with a happy birthday as well!  The space is a classic ""embrace and release"" phenomenon where you walk in to a very dark, subdued entryway and then are released into a large main room with soaring ceilings and light. The room is beautiful with sheer floor to ceiling drapes and beautiful artwork on the walls.  The tables are covered with white tablecloths and a subdued place holder; not much there to detract from the food.  There is some modern background music that is unobtrusive; this is a place that you can actually have a conversation! We had the tasting menu with some upgrades - why not?  Also some caviar - again, why not?  Cheese?  - that's a dumb question.  That's 11 courses but there's a lot of extra stuff you get so it's more like 15.  The food was uniformly excellent though some items definitely stood out.  The dashi custard was super yummy - one of the best chawanmushi dishes I've ever had.  The faro risotto with braised baby pig was also excellent.  However, the best dish of the night and one of the best things I've ever eaten was the whole muscovy duck.  This is an upgrade to the tasting menu and one that YOU MUST GET!  This is the best duck I've ever had.  They bring the thing out to the table before it's carved so you can see what a work of culinary art it is, then they take it back to the kitchen, carve it, and bring it back out.  This duck combines the best of Eastern and Western duck cooking.  In the East, it's all about having delicious duck skin - aka Peking duck.  In the West, it's about having the most luscious pink duck breast meat.  This duck had both - a savory, crispy skin and super tender pink meat.  BRAVO!  A little later they bring out the confit - so not a bit of that duck is wasted! This place is serious about bread and pastries.  Each course comes with a different little bread - brioche, croissant, pumpernickel, fruit/nut, blini, cheese puff.  So good.  We got a basket of mini madeleines fresh out of the oven - OMG, those were the bomb.  At the end of the meal came cannelles, and then a fruit brioche to take home.  Our kids got little cupcakes with candles for their birthday - nice touch. The wine list is pricey (no surprise) and there is a by-the-glass list as well.  The sommelier is quite helpful.  Their coffee is Intelligentsia - always a nice touch. At the end of the meal we received customized birthday menus to take home as well as an array of sweets and cookies.  As has been their custom since inception, as you leave, you get a little something to take home and eat in the morning to remind you of the meal.  Nice touch.",0.9991,0.779,0.206,0.015,0.47891025641025653
2015-01-15,5.0,"I came here for my birthday dinner. I considered many restaurants before finally deciding on Tru, therefore my expectations were pretty high. That being said, I had an incredible fine dining experience. Tru was a class act to the very end. Swanky but not too swanky. The service was impeccable, extremely polite and respectful. Service ran very smoothly. Short wait in between courses, lots of extra little desserts, and even the servers had servers. They printed out custom menus for us to take home. Impressive. The ambiance was very quiet, though the dining room was relatively empty on a Thursday night. By the end of my meal, I was full, but not stuffed so I'd say it was the perfect amount of food. We had a wonderful dinner at Tru, and I highly recommend it for a special occasion. The food wasn't all perfect, but still as good as it gets. That combined with the top notch service makes this a five-star experience for me. If you'd like to skip my breakdown of the food, you can stop here, but before you do, I have just two words for you: muscovy duck. I will first commend Tru on their bread. They serve bread with almost all of their savory courses and with the cheese. It comes on a separate little dish with butter. We had brioche, onion pumpernickel, fruit and nut bread, and a croissant with black truffle butter. All were delicious and awesome little extras spread throughout the meal. We started with 25 grams of Russian caviar, beautifully presented on a glass coral sculpture. The caviar was delicious. They serve it with blini and a variety of fixings, so I would definitely recommend having caviar to start. First two courses were both salad-esque. The beet with sorbet was very interesting in a good way, and the petite salad with truffles was delicious. Next was the dashi custard, which was one of our favorites of the night. Everyone at my table chose this option. The custard was deliciously creamy and had tons of dashi flavor. Caviar and edamame were nice touches. For the next course, I upgraded to the foie gras. The foie was quite delicious, very rich and seared nicely. The chestnuts and chestnut creams were tasty and went well with the foie gras. We agreed that this dish could have used some acid, but it was delicious nonetheless. Next two courses were the true proteins. The day boat monkfish was nicely prepared, but I think a more delicate fish would have been more appropriate for this dish. The monkfish, being a very firm fish, was difficult to cut into and eat. That aside, it was still a well-cooked and well-seasoned piece of fish. However, the true star of the proteins and of the entire night was the whole roasted MUSCOVY DUCK. You MUST order this. It was completely worth the $40 up charge. It put the beef tournedo (the other option for this course) to shame. This was a huge portion of duck (1/2 a duck + confit per person). It was cooked absolutely perfectly--medium rare with crispy, sticky, melt-in-your-mouth delicious skin. I've eaten a lot of duck in my life, but this was by far the best duck I have ever had. Cannot recommend it enough. I was impressed that they also included the confit with mashed potatoes! Moral of the story: upgrade to the duck, it is a must and completely worth the extra money!! 7th course of farro ""risotto"" with porcelette was delicious. Could have eaten a whole bowl of it. Around this course, we sampled five cheeses from the cheese cart, and all were delicious. Next came the ""two"" dessert courses. I put ""two"" in quotes because they give you a ton of extra little things that aren't on the menu, which was awesome and really reflects on the kind of experience you get here. The frozen cider was very interesting, in a good way of course! They brewed a kettle of tea on our table and poured it over cider sorbet. Yummy and somewhat of a palate cleanser. For my last course, I chose the plain of dark valrhona chocolate, which had very strong chocolate flavor. The espresso sorbet on top was delicious. The other option of apple and chestnut strudel was tasty as well. As for the extras, we received a batch of Madeleines, fresh from the oven. These little guys were sooo good. Hot and crispy and delicious! We liked them so much that our server was able to secure us an extra batch. Bonus point right there. Another extra dessert was a sort of platter that included caneles, raspberry jellies, and chocolate rosemary truffles. We enjoyed every bit. And if THAT wasn't enough, there was also a white chocolate and basil liquid truffle presented with smoking dry ice, which was yet another nice and unexpected touch. Of course, they gave us some almond cakes to take home as well. Really had an incredible experience here at TRU. I hope I can come back one day, for the amazing service and of course, their whole roasted Muscovy duck. Five stars.",0.9998,0.735,0.25,0.015,0.6061840986394561

I will say it was very easy to get a reservation on a Friday night, which was nice, and that we were seated immediately.  However, once we were seated and placed our drink orders, it was probably close to an hour before we received our first course.  The wait staff apologized for the delay, and once the first course came out the rest followed pretty quickly, but it was still disappointing to go to such a nice restaurant and feel like we were ignored for such a long time. The ambiance was just okay.  It looks nice and we had plenty of room at our table, but it seemed closed-off with all of the curtains drawn and had an 'empty' feeling to it. The food was good, but again nothing spectacular.  A few courses (the petite salad, red curry squash and the beef) were excellent, but the rest I found to be not as great.   Basically, I was hoping to be blown away by the experience, and I wasn't.  Especially not for the steep price.

2014-12-23,5.0,"You can really love or hate this place. If you dine out often, you will love this restaurant with the open space the atmosphere provides and the comfortable service that the Staff of TRU brings to the table especially when you begin ordering high quality chardonnays and Grand Cru Burgundies. I enjoyed this restaurant. It's TRUe that nothing feels new, but this is where they perfected the usual and where you feel at home.  Our menu was 9 courses long with three or four options. All options were upgrades which is a pain in the rear because it does feel like they are chipping away at your wallet wherever they can like an escort for Senators with all their ""extras"". In today's price fixe, there should be no supplements... If you are going to serve caviar, serve caviar AND if you wanna serve Truffles or Foie Grois, serve it! Don't give supplement options, just raise the price fixe price. Diners today have No time and little patience for games.  I found the perfect pair of red and white wines on their list, but The Wine List did not impress me because I am a wine collector and always looking for the value wine. Their Champagne selection needed a little help, their Napa Cabs were too overpriced and without even going to Italy, their Bordeaux collection was straight on par pathetic. Even so, they had a limited Burgundy list that still met the requirements of minimum. The Burgs too came with heavy price tags but if you were willing to pay, you can find bottles of Burgundies with the right Restau Price tag unlike their horrific Napa Selections. If you know Burgundies, you know that they quickly get pricey with quality.  We ended up enjoying a bottle of 2004 Domaine Dujac Clos De La Roche for $379 and a 2010 Aubert Lauren Vineyard for $239 or so. The Dujac Clos De La Roche was priced right and a perfect vintage for the occasion.  Overall a fantastic experience for me. Very New York City in style which is my preference.  Like I said, if you dine often in high end restaurants, you don't wanna eat a balloon or sweets off of a table. You just wanna eat a good flavored meal with exceptional service in an environment that is super plush and comfortable; and that is exactly how I felt at TRU, like Welcome Home where  nothing was a problem.",0.9953,0.751,0.183,0.066,0.6052924852924852
2014-11-29,3.0,"First off, it's a beautiful restaurant with a modern feel.  I would change the music though - techno and a little dated. The staff must have been new or still training because there were numerous mishaps and mistakes.  At one point, after laying out flatware for our party of 7, another waiter came and took all of the flatware before we used it.  Someone made a comment about how this was new and unused silverware, and a waiter explained it was the wrong type.  Perhaps this is true, but we never would have known the difference except they made it so obvious by removing it and re-setting it (and 4 of us got the same silverware again...).  Positives: The first course included a crab selection that was fantastic.  Another course was monkfish - juicy, flavorful, great.  The beef entree was tender, aromatic & perfect. The chocolate truffle was a delicious surprise.  Negatives: too many truffles!! if I was a fan,  this would've made me happy.  Sadly I am not.

I won't taunt you with the specifics of what we ate because the menu seems to change with some frequency. However, I will say that each course was plated exquisitely, as though a painter had taken his brush to our plates. Though ruining each masterpiece in favor of eating it seemed a bit like sacrilege, we could hesitate for only a moment before unceremoniously devouring every last bite, leaving our tastebuds in a fantastic nirvana-like state. Not to be outdone by the food quality and presentation, the waitstaff went above and beyond, then above again. Besides being quite amicable, they really paid attention to the details, both large and small. Yes, they were consistent about refilling my water glass - and I'm a sponge, so that is no easy task. They also refolded our napkins whenever we stood up, served each dish in perfect unison, and when we mentioned in passing that we were sorry our set menu didn't include the campfire of s'mores, our waiter brought out the chocolatey, marshmallowy dessert in addition to the perfectly tart diverse berries, black pepper, and nasturtium on our table d'hôte. To part, a little-known fact about me: Following a fine dining experience, I always wonder what I'm going to eat for breakfast the next day that won't be a gastronomic disappointment.

Our table was nicely set up (they even have a stool for the ladies' handbags). Since it was late, we went for the abbreviated menu. Somehow they messed up the order of our food, and it ended up being that I was on the third dish while she was on the second. They made an extra dish so we are again in sync. The food itself was good but not mind-blowing, especially if you have experienced other restaurants in this league. What I really enjoyed was the appetizers (trio, lite sunchoke, squash soup). My girlfriend loved the caviar and the monkfish. They changed their menu right before our visit and eliminated some of the options that I was looking for, since I have some diet restrictions. However they were able to accommodate my preferences. Definitely let them know if you are not a fan of certain ingredient. Their service is impeccable. Our waitress was very caring but knew the boundaries. They were patient in explaining all the options and offered some extra sweets at the end for messing up the presentation of some of our food.

2014-10-07,5.0,"Tl;dr version: INCREDIBLE food, ambiance and service..  Whatever you do, get the foie gras and muscovy duck!!! See below for detailed review! ----- Husband and I planned a quick weekend trip to Chicago to celebrate our first wedding anniversary.  My main concern for the trip?  Which of Chicago's numerous Michelin star rated restaurants would we be having dinner at, of course!  I am so happy we ended up choosing Tru. Ambiance:  Great atmosphere for a special dinner.  The restaurant is elegant and modern.  Tables are spaced far enough apart so that you have your own space and privacy.   Service: Amazing, as all the previous reviews have already mentioned.  Yes, they really do pour your water and bring out your dishes in unison.  We had several different servers come by throughout the course of our meal and they were all attentive, knowledgeable, and professional without being snooty or stuffy. [Side note: you're offered the choice of a black or white napkin. For the love of gosh, if you're wearing dark attire, choose the black napkin!!] Drinks:  Extremely extensive wine list.  We started off with some delicious rose champagne to celebrate and also had a bottle of pinot noir per recommendation of our server.  Both were great. Now, onto the FOOD! We ordered from the prix-fixe menu. Our menus had ""Happy Anniversary"" printed at the top and we were given a copy to take home.  Such a lovely touch! Amuse bouche: - Yellow sweet corn + black truffle:  Good!  Perfect little teaser to start out with. First course: - Array of river salmon:  Husband's choice.  The presentation of this dish is absolutely spectacular.  Salmon is placed on a plate of beautiful, smooth river rocks with dry ice creating the effect of a river.  I tried a little bit and the salmon was flavorful and fresh.   - Seared foie gras, yellow peach, gem lettuce, pecan:  I flipping love foie gras and of course, Tru's is phenomenal.  The foie gras was melt-in-your mouth amazing.  The peach and pecans it was paired with created the most perfect bites.   Main course: - Whole roasted muscovy duck, caramelized belgium endive, quince + ginger chutney:  There are three offers for your main course.  The muscovy duck is served for two people so do WHATEVER YOU CAN to convince your dining partner to agree to this dish!!  I really enjoy duck and this dish is the hands-down best duck dish I have ever had.  I am so glad our server recommended this.  He told us that the chef has partnered with a farm in upstate New York that raises muscovy ducks SOLELY for the purpose of this dish.  If that doesn't convince you....I don't even know what else to say!  The duck was juicy, tender, and cooked perfectly.  The skin was crispy and the seasoning blend on top was ridiculously good.  Endive and chutney were perfect with it.  Mint + verjus, grape, consommé:  Light and refreshing. Dessert: - Campfire of s'more:  Delicious!  Chef's play on s'mores definitely did not disappoint. We also received another small dessert plate with an assortment of sweets, compliments of the chef, along with a mini cupcake with a candle for our anniversary.  Such sweet touches that were very much appreciated. Tru is a splurge meal but I wouldn't hesitate to come here again for a special occasion.  This place is the whole package from food to service to atmosphere.  It was quite honestly, one of the best meals I've ever had.  Thank you, Tru, for making our first anniversary dinner absolute perfection!",0.9984,0.805,0.19,0.005,0.5768425324675323

The only thing that Tru trumps over Alinea is their synchronized food serving.  We had a table of 4, so 4 servers would come a put our plates of food down at the exact same time and sweep around us in a circle like a dance.  That was nice and added to the service a lot.   Overall food was amazing except for one thing that still kind of pisses me off to this day.  We paid an extra like $120 for a whole roasted muscovy duck to be divided among the table.   They brought out the duck to show it and then cut it up in the back and made two dishes out of it.  Granted, those two dishes were fantastic, but where was the rest of the duck?  If I pay that much for something extra.. I want to eat every part of it down to the bone and yet we were served like 1/3 of it.  What a waste!  If they boxed up the rest that would have been awesome, but imagine paying extra money for only about 5 bites.  It felt like a complete waste of money and I would not do it again.

We chose the 3-course option and we're not disappointed: portions are relatively larger than on the tasting menus so we were served sufficient food (regular concern on these type if restaurants).  Their plates had a very nice presentation, dishes had very interesting and original flavors and portions were just right.  We had an overall very pleasant experience, however I did not rate it with 5 stars because, for the price paid and michelin rating, I did expect a little more. Nonetheless, it was definitely worth the visit and would agree on paying TRU another visit once the summer menu changes.",0.9928,0.769,0.226,0.005,0.5625054945054945

In the last 2 years there 3 course menu became 5, then the price went from 98 to 125.  Well, reasonable for a very expensive restaurant.  The food, however, didn't deliver up to my expectation.  We started with amuse bouche with truffle powder.  It was a heaven.  My second dish was an array of salmon.  While the presentation was great (with dry ice) the food wasn't that great.  Didn't feel more than just a piece of raw salmon. Third menu, main, was ribeye for my wife and halibut for me.  It smelled great.  It tasted good.  Perfectly cooked.  Still didn't really blow our mind to a way that ""man, this is definitely worth 2 stars"".  Fourth was a grape sorbet, which was very refreshing.  Last dish for me was the layer of chocolate, which looked pretty, but wasn't impressive in terms of taste. Another surprising thing was that they were much more relaxed this time.  Couldn't find the sign of being OCD-like like 2 years ago.  Sometimes the servers were clumsy even.  Anyway they still printed the personalized menu for us, which was nice. Overall I don't know if they are really worth 2 stars at this point.  Even though I haven't been to that many fancy restaurants, but I have been to enough restaurants to say that one is good enough for them for now.",0.9907,0.817,0.172,0.012,0.5188081671415006

(1) The Food: It's just plain delicious.   The ingredients are really special from the cuts of meat, unusual mushrooms to the high end cheeses on the cheese tray.  Unlike other Michelin starred restaurants in Chicago that mess with your mind a bit (tofu that's really seafood that's made into ice-cream etc), the flavors are simple to enjoy.  That's not to say the presentation wasn't amazing and artful.  Just less of a cerebral experience and more of plain enjoyment. (2) The Service: Is super attentive without being snooty.   For example, I love cheese but have a terrible memory for the names beyond Brie and Gruyere.  So during the cheese course, I asked a lot of questions not knowing if I'd get a snobby answer back like ""obviously the blah blah cheese of the blah blah region is known for it's XYZ properties.""  Nope, the waiter was really nice and happy to answer questions.  I must have looked very conflicted over the choice of two different cheeses so our waiter started cracking up (nicely!) and made me a plate with all of them.   (3) The Ambiance: The original, museum quality art has major wow-factor. Look, if I'm going to drop a paycheck on a meal, the setting should be pretty nice.  And an original Warhol?  That's pretty impressive.... (4) The Extras:  Yep, wow factor again. On your way out, they give you cookies to enjoy the next day!  And they personalize a copy of the menu with your special occasion as a keepsake.   (5) It's a Lettuce Entertain You Okay, so that may seem like a weird plus but consider this.  A) The dining points from your meal will definitely pay for a M burger.  B)LEYE gift certificates are pretty popular holiday gifts.  And with one in hand, the $$$$ cost of the tasting menu seems less well, bank-busting?",0.9976,0.68,0.254,0.066,0.6396345514950166

2014-02-02,1.0,"Warning: Stay away from this place like a plague.  Tru is certainly a unique dining experience in every bad way you can deem possible. Terrible service (this I cannot emphasize enough), bland food and a high price tag. It's what we Chinese people would call the Tuhao of dining - classless and the non-frequent high diners simply go and justify it's worth because it's expensive.  I came with high expectations after a friend's recommendation and after reading numerous positive reviews but I left $600 dollars short and extremely disappointed. I'll divide this review in terms of four sections: service, presentation, ambiance and food quality. Service I cannot emphasize how bad the service is at this restaurant. If you can't be bothered reading then this is what happened: male waiter knocks over my full glass of Delamotte champagne, doesn't apologize, drops a bon bon dessert on the table from it's plate and doesn't replace it with a new one, then proceeds to charge me for 2 glasses of Delamotte without acknowledging that he tipped over the first one. Overall, the host, hostesss and other waitresses were all very courteous but what transpired in my 1.5 hours of dining here with that waiter could easily make this the worst restaurant service I have ever experienced. To put it simply, I'd rather go spend $20 at Applebee's and tip $580 because I know at least the staff would treat me with something called respect which Tru is oblivious to. Presentation Food presentation is important for any high-end restaurant, and Tru doesn't disappoint. It isn't as impressive nor innovative as Alinea, such as it's dessert table paintings or its green apple taffy balloons, but Tru does a great job in showcasing each dish.  On another note,  Tru is known for their levitation dish which I was hoping to see but wasn't offered on my menu. Ambiance Live piano music, candle lights, dim lighting, no city-view backdrop (it's on the first floor) etc. If that floats your boat go ahead. Food I cannot emphasize how bland and unimpressive the food was. I say this in all sincerity because I've ate at Alinea, Next, L20, Sixteen and the list goes on. I came here on 12/31 to celebrate the new years and they only had one set menu available but it was bland in every way. To be honest, I can't even remember what I ate because it was just that unimpressive and disappointing. I even looked across the table to see my friend really disappointed and she usually never complains about food. That's just how disappointed we were.

2014-01-26,4.0,"Tru has been on my official ""Restaurants I REALLY want to go to but I'll be broke after"" list for quite a while. I checked Alinea off that list last year for my birthday, and thought it would only be appropriate to visit another for my birthday this year.  The restaurant front is unassuming and rather easy to miss, but once you step inside, you're in a very modern, classy, intimate setting. There are several courses to choose from, but I decided to go with the Tru experience ($158 per person).  Service, as expected, was phenomenal. They offer you a choice of black or white cloth napkins (don't want white fuzz on a black dress!) and they have a big group of servers going around to make sure plates are served, explained, and cleared (you get new silverware for every course). Everyone was very knowledgable about the food and very polite. I had several people tell me happy birthday, and I even got a little extra dessert.  Onto the food: the Tru experience comes with 11 courses, and most were fantastic.  1. Trio of plates (pear/fennel, sorrel/buttermilk, foie gras/honeycrisp apple). The first two of the trio, I did not like. The flavors were rather herbal and almost unpleasant, but the foie gras selection was good.  2. Another trio (main diver scallop/yuzu, caviar/sea urchin, beef/white truffle). Absolutely amazing. The scallops were so fresh and the citrusy flavors of the yuzu really complemented the raw seafood. The caviar/sea urchin was so creamy and the flavors were intense. The beef tartare was amazing as well - tender but with enough texture so it wasn't too slimy. One of my favorite courses! 3. Lite sunchoke, trout roe, oxalis: To be entirely honest, I don't remember loving or hating this dish. Nothing to say. 4. Langoustine: So good. The langoustine itself comes in a fish-bowl-esque jar with smoking juniper. The cabbage on the bottom of the plate really soaked up the flavors of the broth, and this was definitely one of my favorites.  5. Wagyu beef short rib: You have not tried amazing beef until you have tried this dish. Fall apart, absolutely the most tender, flavorful piece of meat I have ever had. Presentation was especially beautiful. 6. Skate wing: great flavors, fish was tender. The croissant that came on the side with truffle butter was SO good (and that's saying something because I'm not usually a fan of croissants). 7. Cervena venison with black trumpet farro and gooseberry: One of my least favorites. Venison was too tough and I didn't like the gooseberry.  8. Artisanal cheese selection: Idea is cool. The servers come by with a cart full of gourmet cheeses, and you get to pick three! I was happy with two of my selections, but the third one (it was coated with paprika)... let's just say smell-wise, I couldn't really distinguish it from poop (juvenile description, I know, but I really don't know how else to put it...) I'd stay away from this cheese if you don't like ridiculously pungent smells/flavors.  Desserts: I was rather disappointed. With how well put together the food was, I had high expectations. Also, as someone who has a major sweet tooth, I was really excited. You get 3 dessert courses and a selection of pastries/chocolates at the end. Everything was fruity. SO sad. I guess this is more personal preference, but I do not like fruit with sweet desserts (i.e. fruity sorbet stuffed inside a marshmallow, or a citrus-y ice cream sandwiched between chocolatey wafers). I wouldn't mind sampling 1 or 2 of these types, but literally EVERY single dessert was fruity. Personal preference aside, I also thought the desserts in general were not up to par with the food in terms of presentation and creativity. Minus 1 star for this.  All in all, a great experience. Too pricey to promise that I'll come back again, but I'd say it was worth the ~$250 per person (including tip, tax, 2 glasses of wine).",0.9985,0.765,0.179,0.056,0.5185802374263911
2013-12-02,5.0,"***Tru showcases very good, seasonal and local fruits and vegetables as well as really high quality proteins; Tru utilizes these ingredients and lots of contemporary techniques including molecular gastronomy to produce ambitious, exciting, creative, and delicious cuisine*** Tru has been around for a long time and you feel it in the dining room.  While the dining room is contemporary, it is also too big and square (the shape, high ceiling and boring walls make the room feel like a banquet hall).  Once the food starts to come though, Tru is anything but dated or old-fashioned.  The tasting menu unveils one great course after another and the food is creative and exciting; it kind of took me by surprise, but Tru is definitely one of Chicago's best restaurants. Tru's cuisine is very modern.  The plating is clever and whimsical and there are many molecular gastronomy touches throughout the menu.  Still, the restaurant never gets too cute.  The focus with every course is delivering really pronounced flavors utilizing fresh and local (as well as high quality) ingredients. The tasting menu started with a satisfying gougere and then came a really good beet garnished with horseradish and very good caviar.  An incredibly soft and moist day boat scallop sashimi came next and it featured really fresh garnishes including cilantro, ginger and lime.  A fun and perfect-for-summer course followed--cool and refreshing cucumber ice cream (a very intense cucumber flavor, which is hard to do given how mild cucumber is).  The cucumber dish also featured juicy arctic char roe. A really good carrot soup was next and it was served with tableside green peas croutons--made on the dish with liquid nitrogen to create sorbet-like spheres of green pea puree.  A fun mushroom crisp followed. The next substantial course was Atlantic fluke carpaccio, which was garnished with lemongrass and saffron.  I really liked the Atlantic fluke.  It was nice to get a fish that I do not see that often on the west coast.  A really good morel mushroom course followed, which I really liked.  The morels were very good and they were served over a rich and savory morel bouillon.  A very crispy and buttery croissant accompanied this course.  Like great Bay Area fine dining spots (Saison, Atelier Crenn), Tru presents bread as actual courses so that you get fresh, out of the oven bread, which is a rarity these days (even at the best restaurants). A really good square of pork belly came next--very savory, tender and juicy.  There were good garnishes including plum and onion.  My favorite course followed.  It was salmon poached in olive oil.  It had a richness, moistness and softness that was truly special (it was one of the best salmon courses I've ever had).  The salmon was accompanied by various textures of cauliflower from raw cauliflower to very creamy cauliflower puree. The final savory course was a letdown.  The protein itself (veal) was good--tender and moist.  I liked the vegetables they used too (asparagus, sugar snap peas).  Unfortunately, the soy-based sauce was not good.  It was an all-too-familiar Asian sauce that I've had at much lesser restaurants.  The sauce also completely enrobed the veal too, which ruined the plate. The menu picked up though with the cheese plate--really great epoisses (creamy and pungent) and great garnishes including a bitter and fragrant herb salad and a great red wine poached pear paste. Both desserts were good.  The first dessert featured crispy, buttery and crunchy nuts and oats with very vibrant and fresh berries (some of the best fruit I've had in the Midwest).  The second dessert featured good cherries and really good black truffle ice cream.  Mignardises and a to-go pound cake finished off the meal. Service was excellent.  My server was very personable and knowledgeable about the menu.  Despite the many courses, the food came out at an even and quick pace. Prices are high, but you get both an exceptional variety of food as well as generous portions (small plates but many, many courses). Tru has earned a lot of accolades over the years and I've heard some great things too.  Even considering all of this, Tru still surprised me.  This restaurant showcases really creative and delicious cuisine and the local and seasonal vegetables shined here much more than several other highly rated Chicago restaurants I've been to.  Tru reminds me of great Bay Area restaurants like Manresa, Saison and Atelier Crenn (high quality but also creative and push the envelope cuisine).  Tru is one of Chicago's best restaurants, but it is also one of the best restaurants in the country.

For the most part, food was great! However, there are a few courses that were either lacking 1 or more flavor components or was slightly salty. If only the chef had put in a little more effort, those dishes would've been phenomenal. For example, the first course came out with 3 small dishes, which although tasted the worst, looked the most beautiful. It had the right idea, but was incredibly short on execution. One of the dishes was a ""drink"" but was void of any flavor. Almost made me gag actually. I thought it was just me, but my wife felt the same way as well as a few tables surrounding us.  Unfortunate that it was the first course, because it kinda set the tone for the entire meal. Fortunately, the rest of the meal was great and got us back into the mood, but not entirely.

The food is impeccable.  The service is choreographed and never misses a beat.  We did the full experience with caviar and the cheese cart and full wine paring.  Our dinner took a little over 4 hours to complete, which further enhanced our entire dining ""experience"" rather than just a formal dinner.  We even received a personalized copy of our Tru Experience listing everything that we had eaten and the wine paring with our party name and a congratulations message included.  This will make a great keepsake. This was our first Michelin Star restaurant, but it won't be the last.  I'm curious as to how other restaurants of the same caliber stack up.   Overall, if you are a true foodie who has a wide palate range and are willing to try new experiences, then give Tru a try.  If you are expecting a steak dinner, go elsewhere.  Also, if you want the full experience (we were stuffed) with wine parings, the recommended reviews stating $500 to burn won't cover it.  Just FYI.",0.9797,0.857,0.143,0.0,0.5149491812535292

While I don't have a plethora of other restaurants to compare it to, I still sincerely appreciate the innovative and thoughtful menu. If you're like me, you will be dining here for the experience just as much as the food. We were probably the youngest in the restaurant but I didn't feel out of place. The service is impeccable and you couldn't be better taken care of. I won't go into detail as it's spelled out in the other reviews, but these guys know what they're doing and aren't presumptuous about it.  We did the 14-course menu + an additional 3-cheese tasting course (from the amazing cheese cart that should just be posted up in my kitchen at all times). We did not do the wine pairing but instead shared a $50 bottle of gruner veltliner. By the end of the 14 courses (17 if you count the complimentary cheese puff, complimentary extra dessert course, & the additional cheese course), I was beyond stuffed. We were going to walk around the city after our meal but ended up getting a cab to go home and pass out after 1/2 a block because we could barely move.. I am confident that you could do the 7-course menu and be very satisfied.  The flavors in every dish are so exciting to eat. My favorites were the sea urchin in a granny smith + watercress avalanche, cool as a cucumber arctic char roe, yellow corn royal chanterelle truffle foie gras, and the scottish salmon poached in olive oil w/ cauliflower in textures.  My least favorites were the bright melon in rose essence w/ cured duck breast and the duroc pork belly w/ chambered smoke consomme.

You are privileged to be here.""  But that couldn't be further from the truth with Tru.  They were genuine, articulate, intelligent and extremely kind.  And to top it all off, they gave us a tour of the kitchen at the end of our meal!  You think the food is elaborate?  Imagine the amount of staff necessary to maintain the timing and execution of the meal.  'PHEW!'

Was i bit disappinted at first but changed my midn after our excellent 3 dish evening at this classy establishment.   *First of all, dont forget a jacket! (yes you are required to wear it through the complete dinner)  The dining room is nice looking though a bit too formal for my taste even though we are talking about fine dining.   We decided on the 3 course set menu where you have 2-3 items to choose from each on the appetizer, main and dessert. As they change menus a few times a year im sure they changed it after we where there. Anywho lets get to the food the shall we.  As an appetizer i had the fois gras and duck ravioli in a duch consomé.  This was a fun sight.  the servers (note there was always more then one serving us) brought something that looked like a timeglass in a a bigger size with the consomé/stock in the lower glass and some herbs/spices in the top glass. When putting a blowtorch under the ""timeglass"" the consomé was rising up in the top glass with all the herbs when it was heating up! As it was ready the servers poured it simultaniously (od course!) over our plates with the ravioli and small cubes of fois gras. Did it taste good you might ask? Oh yes it was marvelicious with subtle and refined flavors blending nively together. And yes i do love the goose liver!  My main was the 72 h braised short ribs with a cauliflower/jalepeno purée and some red wine reduction among other things. Wow how good it was!  Its amazing that long hours in the oven can make such a cheap cut som amazingly tender that it almost falls apart just by looking at it.   The cauliflower/jalepeno purée was silky smooth in texture and great in taste though it wouldnt have hurt with a little bigger chili kick.  My dessert was some chocolaty cake that was almost as good as the above mentioned masterpieces though im not much of a dessertperson.    We also had some wonderful freshly baked bread before the appetizer, some beatiful looking amuse bouche*s and when we had our espresso at the end teh server brought a wagon full of small petit fours, chocolate pralines and devine french macarons. You could pick as many as you wanted but how many can you swallow after a tree course meal with bread and some extra small dishes, right? = ) The food was gorgeous looking, tha food was absolutely superb.   I think we paid aabout  350 $ for 2 with a bottle of red,  tax and tips inc.  Ok so its not cheap but considering this is a Michelin starred restaurant that will make you satisfied even with high initial expectations i would say its worth it.  My only personal complain and im sure there are people who loves this is the ridicilous level of the service. You ALWAYS have 1 server each at the table and they do everything simultaniously. Filling  the wine, the water, scraping of breadcrumbs of the table every 5 minutes.......... One might say that this is excellent service, theres nothing to complain about etc etc. But i dont mind pouring myself a glass of wine or refilling my water......  I doesnt have to be refilled with every sip if you get my point.......  Conclusion: You love great food and dont mind paying for a great experiend or have something to celeberate?

White walls, dark curtains, and the only color in the restaurant were the paintings, the lilies and foxtail centerpieces (center of the room, not tables), and the food. The food was pretty much like art. We had a really early dinner at the Girl and the Goat before we ate at TRU and our server actually used to work at TRU. She said the service is like a choreographed dance... and it was. We had a party of six and three waiters came at the beginning and simultaneously poured our waters... it was... different.  If you are unfamiliar with table manners, get ready to feel really awkward in this place. I may not be a debutante, but I think I know enough, but there were times when I felt uneasy. I felt I had to sit up straight the entire time and speaking too loudly would've been quite disrespectful. It was hard to carry on a conversation amongst the six of us since our round table was big enough to seat about ten people. Luckily, our maitre d' and waiters were friendly and joked with us every now and then to make us feel more at ease.  You had the option of having a seven or thirteen course. We had the seven and it was so filling! The food was creatively plated. Some think it may be pretentious especially for the size of the plates and its price, but I appreciate unique plates presented like art in small portions.

You can feel the ginger, lemon and sugar - each hitting separately and yet in such coordinated manner. - Asparagus - loked like it was poached. Subtle truffle flavors. - Beef in two forms - liked the strip more. The shortrib was good too. The potato wasabi puree was out of the world. - Cheese plate - they would bring out a cheese cart and you get to choose 3 cheeses for $20. Choose well. All were great. - Salmon - the broth was simply gorgeous - silky with light ginger, lemon flavors. - English peas in frost - the peas when combined with the strawberry on the plate does magic.  - Pistachios - light pistachio cakey flakes  like dried foam with nasturtium. Light and nice. - Mignardises - How can I forget them. One came out on paper strips with liquid nitrogen spewing fog. It was the best I have had. Light chocolate shell filled with pomegranate and orange probably concoction. Orgasmic. Besides that plenty to choose from - a cake, macaroon, truffle, etc. I chose one of each.  Misses -  - Sunchoke puree - nothing memorable.  Blonde morel - I understand the concept of the flavors -  but it was wayy to salty and unidirectional. No parallel flavors.  - Maitake crunch - I ended up liking the crunch to a degree and lightness of the dish since it was just around the start of the meal and I was getting warmed up. Crunchy wafer made out of maitake slathered lightly with mushroom mousse (?) and topped with oxalis.  - Pork belly - It was flavorless and just salty - quite unidirectional. They handed a financier cake on our way out. That was so thoughtful.  So, in my quest of food, I have passed the post of Tru. In all I left a little underwhelmed. Some dishes were indeed unidirectional. Similar meal at Blackbird was more memorable in terms of food. But I might come back for a newer menu someday.",0.9977,0.827,0.159,0.014,0.5204863221884498

Dont want to much gin, other wise it'll taste just like gin and not too much  fiz, or it'll be a soda. + you always want a little secret inside, and that's what they gave me. A perfect gin fizz.

At one point, the server waited so long to be relieved of the contents of her tray, she sighed out loud. Right next to our table. Very unprofessional.

After reading Linday's review I was concerned when my husband surprised me with dinner at Tru.  We arrived at 7:30pm on a Wednesday night, and the restaurant was half empty, which was also disconcerting.  But once the food began arriving we were happy as could be.  We loved every course, including the short ribs Lindsay panned.  We chose the 7 course dinner, and the scallops were delicate and divine, the chilled carrot soup with mascarpone and cardamom was delicious, the sunchoke and arctic char dish made me want more, and they served wonderful little slices of brioche with the soup, and mini croissants with the sunchoke dish.  I'm not a fan of salmon, so they graciously brought me a divine halibut with fennel in a delectable broth instead.  And as mentioned above, the beef 2 ways was fun, especially with the wasabi potato puree (in fact the short rib portion was so generous my husband had to eat half of mine.)  The pistachio dessert was inventive, and the apricots in it were the best part.  My husband enjoyed the mint pea and strawberry dessert (who knew they worked for dessert??) and since I don't care for mint, they brought me the chocolate dessert that was wonderful.  And then come the extras.  An assortment of bonbons to choose from.  And a surprise chocolate truffle at the end.  Service was superb.  Presentation was lovely.  The ambience could use a little pop on the tables, but that's just a trifle when the dining experience is so much fun and pleasure.",0.9916,0.793,0.19,0.017,0.6313333333333333

The short rib was literally the worst I have ever had.  We each took a bite and had to abandon it.  The pork belly had been morphed into jell-o, and the duck breast was cured and tasted no better than something you could have on your meat/cheese plate at a neighborhood wine bar.

2013-04-21,5.0,"Luxurious n Blissful... the best way to celebrate a special occasion!! Writing this review after experiencing one of the best meals of my life. I made reservations here to celebrate my husband's new gig. Called them to inform that we both were vegetarians and they said there would be no problem accommodating us.  Everything from moment we entered the restaurant till we got back into our car made us feel like we were royalty. The personalized menus we were handed are such a classy touch. I was initially intimidated and overwhelmed by the ambiance, the number of servers and the orchestrated service but a meal typically takes 2.5 to 3 hours and we warmed up to all of it after a lil' while. The decor is very modern and elegant. Dress up and feel fly... trust me you will want to feel like a million bucks for this experience.  There is no way I can put into words the sensations and joy I felt tasting the food. I am just glad that I had my husband with me while experiencing such pleasure, because I honestly believe that your happiness increases when you share it with someone you love. Does cabbage puree sound appetizing to you?? Oh, but it was!! It was one of the highlights of the evening. I'm a home-cook who loves earthy flavors and to me, molecular gastronomy sounds like lab science but now, I want me a bowlful of amorphous pistachio puree and dehydrated carrots. Our servers not just explained us the dish that were presented to us, but knew in depth how the food was cooked. This made the meal even more exciting.

First off, the service was outstanding.From the time we were greeted at the door until the time the restaurant manager walked us to our cab and yelled at the cabbie who nearly ran down my friend, we were treated like queens.  The simultaneous serving of dishes did get a little old after the fifth or sixth course. But I  was happy to have each and every dish explained to us. Highlights of the meal in order of deliciousness: 9th course  - foie gras royal and blonde morel - blew me away; so rich and meaty, enjoyed the flavor, utterly transcendental 7th course - long carrot soup, glacial orange cardamom - this was a fav around the table, I would of licked my bowl if my friend didn't look like she was about to slap me 2nd course - day boat scallop with hon shimeji - complex dish, flavors literally danced over my tongue 10th course  - duroc pork belly, compressed black plum and onion - left me speechless 12th course - wagyu beef done two ways - awesome, just the right amount of food Middle of the road courses. I could either take them or leave them.  Yummy, but nothing special: 1st course - beet ossetra caviar, chervil - love beets, not a big fan of cavier, but it was a great way to begin the meal 3rd course  - ancho cured duck on down, tangerine, sour cherry - I remember liking it, but i don't remember being blown away by it. The Swing and a Miss courses for me: scottish salmon and shitake braised with yadda yadda yadda  - I am not a fan of salmon peeky toe crab  with lemon vanilla gelee - good flavors but it was too freaking  cold. Hurt to eat it. Total fail course: light sunchoke, sorrel, and arctic char roe - Nasty. no one at the table had more than a couple of bites. The cheese and dessert courses were okay. We skipped the wine pairing (which ended up being a very good choice) and proceeded to drink a couple of bottles of ""reasonably ""wine between the three of us. I said ""reasonably"" because everything is relative. The cost of the wine was 3 times retail per bottle. Thank god it was delicious and complimented our meal well.

2013-04-08,5.0,"I've wanted to eat at Tru ever since I bought Rick Trumonto's Amuse Bouche recipe book (due to a Tumblr recommendation years ago). Even though Rick apparently severed ties with Tru since then in order to make his way down to New Orleans, I was still interested in visiting his former home, especially after my dad had proclaimed Tru to be the best restaurant that he's ever eaten at in the US. And I do have to say, when it was all said and done, our dinner was pretty legen-wait for it-dary. But I'm getting ahead of myself. We opted for the menu with the most food on it (it was called something much more elegant than that, but the name escapes me right now) and were quickly onslaught with 16 dishes, all of which fortunately were manageable because (1) I can eat a lot and (2) except for the main fish and beef plates, the dishes were each only a couple of bites, stemming from the Thomas Keller school of thought about providing small bites to leave the customer wanting more. And while the food itself focused on showcasing how well they could cook wagyu beef and salmon and less on the gimmicks of molecular gastronomy, the serving platters took on a modern flair as they changed from glow in the dark bowls and split logs to a huge cocoa bean on a cocoa bean leaf. The service was outstanding and yet relaxed at the same time, something I personally appreciate because it makes me feel less like an impostor dressing up in her mother's clothes. This one poor girl had me cracking up the entire night. Cute, short and blond, she must have been low man on the totem pole as her job was to lug out every dish from the kitchen, including the heavy logs of meat, while the muscular guys (albeit top-notch waiters whom clearly earned their way to their seniority status) waited patiently for her to make her way towards them before raising a finger. At one of her exasperated rolling-of-eyes and sighs I couldn't help myself, I burst at laughing at her distress (wow, that sounds horrible - really my heart was going out to her!). But much to my chagrin, my laughter brought the attention of the higher-ups down on her - and they did not look pleased.

2013-04-06,5.0,"For our last night in Chicago, we stuck with a restaurant closer to our hotel and went to Tru. Making a reservation on OpenTable a couple weeks of time was surprisingly easy (we were able to get a reservation at 7:45 on Saturday night), and showing up and getting seated was a cinch. Similar to Alinea the night before, the dining room has a relatively simple yet modern feel to it, although there is more bright lighting. Although the dining room feels quite big, it never got too noisy, even when it was filled with more people. Service was very good and relatively quick; you aren't left waiting too long between each bite, which is probably a good thing if you go with the 14-course tasting (which you definitely should). The servers also have a good personality about things and talking about the dishes, which is nice in comparison to most upscale places, where waiters can be robotic at times. As for the food - it's hard to state how well and complete the tasting menu feels. Doing the 14-course tasting gives you a chance to sample dishes from all across the spectrum - seafood, meats, appetizers, sweets, and some really cool, innovative dishes in between. Not only that, but the presentation is extremely unique and well-done for each dish - for example, you get served the beef on a glass resting on top of half a wooden log - without being overwrought and feeling over the top. The first course was beet with caviar, which was really good and different, as the caviar paired with a denser vegetable adds a spritz of saltiness, but the flavor of the beet is much lighter than other dishes I've had with caviar. The seafood dishes (both the crab and the Scottish salmon) were very delicious; they tasted fresh, but paired with a clean fruity tastes (for the crab) and with mushroom-infused broth (for the salmon). The clear highlight of the dinner (and it wasn't on the shorter 7-course - just another reason why you should go for the larger tasting) was the foie gras truffle flan. It's the first time these two favorites of mine paired in the dish, and the result is pure magic. Out of the many meals I've eaten over the years, this may very well be the absolute best dish, EVER. The richness of the foie gras gives the dish the depth, but the truffle flavor overlaid on it takes it to another level. I would come back to Tru if the rest of the meal was just okay, because this was otherworldly and so freakin' good. It gets paired with a croissant served with truffle butter, which really helps to highlight the exquisite flavors of the truffle in another light. The butternut squash soup is the other dish that highlights the truffle, with white truffle cream drizzled into the soup to really give the soup (which was solid on its own) an extra kick of flavor. Both meat dishes (the pork belly and duo of wagyu beef) were delicious and succulent in their own right. In particular, the richness of the flavor in the dry-aged beef was so well-done, it hardly required any additional flavoring or marinade. Like any fabulous restaurant, the dessert courses were delicious (one dish with parfait and orange that almost seems like it's ice cream, except it's not; and a chocolate dish)...and then you got served more dessert on top. We were brought out a 3-tier selected of various truffles, macaroons, jellies, and other goodies to select from at the end, and it was topped off by providing us with a pastry with an orange jelly center for later...it was a great thing to wake up to the next morning. In all, Tru is a phenomenal restaurant. The presentation of the food is fantastic, the portions are just right for a larger tasting menu, and the food is phenomenally good across the spectrum. Did I mention the fois gras truffle flan? SO GOOD. I'm definitely coming back here next time I'm in town. Easily my favorite restaurant (of the limited ones I've been to) in Chicago, and one of the best - if not the best - restaurant I've had the privilege of eating at ANYWHERE so far.

2013-03-28,3.0,"So I finally got Tru out of my system and off my list. Honestly? Meh. I TRUly expected more. Don't get me wrong, the place is gorgeous. Simple decor, spotlights over each table, excellent host service. The actual meal experience was, unfortunately, lacking.  Let me get this one point out of the way before I discuss the food. If you're going to have a complex menu, don't have a waiter who barely pronounces regular English words explain it. Seriously. When I was on the cheese course, he rattled off names for probably 3 min. nonstop; at which point, I just had to ask him to choose for me. I'm not joking. I'm also not trying to be rude. I come from a long line of non-English speaking folks, so I'm VERY used to hearing and understanding heavy accents. This, however, was on another level. Considering the fact that each table has about 3-4 servers servicing them, one of them should be a native English speaker to explain the menu options.  With that out of my system, on to the food. Another slight...meh... My guest and I ordered from two separate sections of the menu, so taste as much as we could. My guest had the Prix Fixe menu and I opted for the Chef's Collection. Reviews below. PRIX FIXE: DUCK CONSOMMÉ, CONFIT + FOIE GRAS RAVIOLI, FRAGRANT JULIENNE The preparation of this course was the interesting part. Similar to a chemistry experiment, watching the consommé being prepare in front of our eyes, infusing itself with truffle, celery and other such yummies was thrilling. The taste? Well, it was mostly truffle-flavored. FALLOW DEER, CELERIES, CHESTNUT, RED CURRANT Cooked exceptionally, but deer is definitely not a flavor I will go back to. Super gamey. VANILLA PARFAIT, COMPRESSED PINEAPPLE, BANANA COMPLIMENTS OF GEORGE George rocked my world on this one. Honestly. Served up on a white ceramic monkey statue, I tried to find the reason behind the monkey, but to no avail. Nonetheless, this dish is phenomenal IMO. CHEF'S COLLECTION: WHITE STURGEON ""CAVIAR"", AVOCADO, HAZELNUT Unique, creative and (somewhat) tasty. What you're eating, essentially, is fish jelly. The actual sturgeon made to look like white caviar, serve in a caviar container atop an avocado spread. Let's just say its much more visually appealing. ANCHO CURED DUCK BREAST ON DOWN, TANGERINE, SOUR CHERRY This dish made me want more. It was delicious and cooked to perfection. Fatty, like duck ought to be and delicate. BUTTERNUT SQUASH SOUP, ALBA WHITE TRUFLE, PARMESAN TUILE Again, a miss for me. More truffle and a lack in texture. The Parmesan was not enough. SEARED FOIE GRAS, 10 GRAPES, CRISP CHESTNUT I feel that this dish would have been much more appealing had there been a variance in texture. The flavors were spot on, but the soft creamy texture of the foie gras alongside the soft texture of the grapes did not allow for the ""crispy"" chestnuts to leave their mark. JIDORI CHICKEN ROULADE, PETIT CABBAGE, BANYULS GASTRIQUE Honestly? This tasted like a small bite of my mother's chicken cutlet. Presentationally this dish is exquisite. It's just edible artwork. Google the name of this dish for photos, they'll stun you. ARCTIC CHAR, LIGHT JERUSALEM ARTICHOKE DOTS, BROKEN SORREL I'm remembering nothing of this dish; it seems to have blended with the other course (not a good sign) PRIME BEEF RIBEYE, MAITAKE MUSHROOM, WASABI POTATO PURÉE Alright, finally something I could sink my teeth into. A beautiful, well-portioned piece of ribeye; served on a block of chopped wood. Love. Love. LOVE. CHOICE OF: COW, GOAT + SHEEP'S MILK CHEESES I love cheese. VANILLA PARFAIT, COMPRESSED PINEAPPLE, BANANA COMPLIMENTS OF GEORGE (see above review) In addition to the mentioned, items like a ginormous pine cone with mini meringue was served.

With so many fine dining establishments in America being touted as New American cuisine, it's refreshing to see a restaurant like Tru staying true (you see what I did there?) to the roots of classic fine dining.

After going through the doors and escaping the Chicago cold, you are greeted with an extremely small check in room, with a very helpful maitre d who checks your coat. The space then opens up to a large restaurant, simplistically yet eclectically decorated.  The food though is the star of the restaurant...and you are greeted with dish after dish of classically cooked, elegantly prepared, and perfectly tasting dishes.

Our reservation was at 6PM on a Friday which is when they just open. We had the place to ourselves for a good 20-30 minutes. It was awesome! The atmosphere at Tru was very elegant yet not at all pretentious. The staff was very helpful and out of this world. They had me at ""White or Black napkin"". Men can't understand this, but for women if you are wearing a black dress and handed a white napkin, consider your dress ruined for the night. I brought this up to explain how meticulous the staff is when it comes to your personal preference. After we ordered our food, they asked if we had any allergies or diet restrictions so they can make the appropriate accommodations.  I am usually a stickler for time, but not once did I feel like I was waiting for my food. The flow of the courses was excellent. Bread was always available. Between our dishes, we had some special offerings from the chefs. The food was excellent. We thoroughly enjoyed every dish.  At one point, I was cold so I put my coat over my shoulders. A staff member came by the table and asked if I would like a pashmina. I declined because I had my coat, but what a nice gesture!  As we were getting ready to leave, the hostesses already had our coats in their hands. They also gave us some parting gifts. My favorite was the menu of our meal with my name on it.  Tru certainly puts very detail to consideration when it comes to the comfort of their guests. I am focusing a lot of the service, but don't let that eclipse the quality of their food. They really put a lot of thought into crafting the perfect menu for each guest. I can't compliment this restaurant enough. It was very expensive but worth every penny. I look forward to returning to Chicago and Tru.",0.9956,0.802,0.175,0.023,0.5677310924369748
2013-02-01,5.0,"This review is from stopping by their lounge for a single glass of wine and two small plates, using up some spare Lettuce gift certificates. The small plates (I had the sturgeon ""caviar"" balls and a slice of foie gras) are, indeed, small. However, they are top-notch in terms of taste and presentation, and you'll want to eat them slowly to really capture all the different textures and flavors. This is definitely modern French; there's a strong note of molecular gastronomy here. The reason this gets five stars is not on the value for money; the lounge prices are almost affordable, but the portions are small enough that they're still insanely expensive. It's four stars on value. However, the service was impeccable, even when it was blatantly clear to my waiter that I was not a high-end customer in any sense. Two nibbles and a glass of wine were accompanied by an amuse-bouche (a series of interesting stacked purees/foams), nicely executed breads, an after-dinner truffle (one of the better and more interesting bits of the evening), and a delightful little lemon-almond cake from the coat stand. By volume, I received more complimentary accompaniments than I actually purchased. Any or all could've been omitted and I probably wouldn't know, but including them and providing the attention I'd get with the $100 prix-fixe was a generous touch. If I ever win the Powerball or otherwise get able to afford an actual meal here, I'd be back.",0.9912,0.813,0.167,0.02,0.4726190476190476
2013-01-22,5.0,"I cannot say enough good things about Tru. Writing this review makes me want to  delete all my previous 5-star reviews because nowhere compares to the dining experience I had at Tru. Walking in, the hostess took our coats and escorted us to the lounge to wait for our table. Our table was ready in less than 5 minutes, but I almost wish we had longer to wait because the seating area was very plush and there was a lot to look at, including some unique art pieces. Once seated, we were presented with our selection of napkin colors, my purse was comfortably seated on the ottoman next to me, and the head waiter explained the menu offerings to us. Multiple servers are assigned to each table and each person was extremely knowledgeable and polite. I decided upon the 3 course menu and my BF got the 6 course tasting menu. For his extra courses, they brought me out an empty plate and silverware, which I thought was a nice touch because then I could steal some of his food ;-) As a note, the courses listed on the menu don't include a variety of amuse bouches and palate cleansers, nor the extensive bread service they provide. We left the restaurant full to the brim. The food, which has been explained previously so I won't get into details, was amazing. The one dish we thought fell short was the chicken. It wasn't bad, just not anything to call home about.  The best parts were the desserts. And yes, I say plural desserts because they just kept coming. We ordered off the menu, then a dessert cart was presented to us, then we got 3 additional off-the-menu dessert bites and a root beer float. It was heavenly. Lastly, when we left, they had our coats waiting (no coat check ticket here!) and our car valeted outside. We also got a personalized menu to take home and a little breakfast pastry wrapped up for the next morning. A few notes - Tru is a formal restaurant and jackets are required for men. Turn off your cell phone - I'm sure if yours rang, everyone would turn and give you a dirty look. Bring your 12 inch voices, its an extremely intimate dining experience. All in all, Tru is a culinary delight topped off by the most dedicated service I have ever experienced in my life. Truly a wonderful evening.

We, of course, went with the 9 course chef's tasting menu and each had a glass of champagne to toast with (Fred insisted!).  The courses were so inventive and so delicious!  A few memorable ones were the ""caviar"" which was a fish that had been cooked in milk, the fish strained out and the remaining infused milk was turned into little pearls that looked like caviar by being dropped into a cold oil solution.  This was served on top of a avocado cream which tasted like an amazingly fresh guacamole.  The combination of the flavors went so great with the hazelnut crackers served with it...OMG...so so so good!!  Another course was foie gras, which was our first time having it, and it was so rich and amazing.  The meal ends with a cheese course where you get to pick three cheeses from the cheese cart and is accompanied by honey, compote and breads and crackers.  Then you have two dessert courses, but seriously, by that time I was SO stuffed that I could hardly eat them!  And to be totally honest, I wasn't that impressed with the desserts.  Sorry Gale!   I would definitely go back here down the road for another special occasion.  Because it is that, a special occasion type of place.  The whole meal with the two glasses of champage and tip came out to around $430, but it was SO worth it.

I dragged my husband out to Chicago with me while I attended a work conference as we decided to make a mini-vacation out of it.  His goal for this whole trip was to eat at as many places as we possibly could.  We attempted to check out another restaurant in town, but we were unsuccessful.  As we continued to look for a fine dinning venue, we stumbled upon Tru, made our reservation, and even mentioned what we were celebrating. Upon presentation to the restaurant, we walked into a dark room they asked my husband if he had a coat (we failed to read their dress code policy and keep in mind, it is strictly enforced...), and when he mentioned he did not, they quickly offered him one.  Once we walked into the main dinning area I couldn't help but feel overwhelmed with excitement.  The tall ceilings, the white walls, plush window dressings, and the artwork all helped to transport me out of the city and into someplace elegant. We ordered the tasting menu and didn't even realize that our dinner took 3 and a half hours.  We just enjoyed everything, even the items we don't normally enjoy, such as caviar.  The food and the presentation were executed perfectly.  My husband and I still comment on the salmon dish inspired by the Pacific Northwest.  And the coral caviar...!  Outrageously clever.  My favorite dish of the night was a faux essence of sturgeon caviar with avocado, smokey and creamy with orgasmic flavors!  Something so simple, yet so ---delicious.  The servers at Tru are impeccable.  The timing and delivery of all our food and wine made me feel as if I were watching a ballet.  Every one was in sync, even to the point that when I went to the restroom, my husband watched the servers return to the kitchen with our food so that we would be served at the same time.  This should be common sense, but compared to the norm among other restaurants in the US, it's not.  And they actually are polite and manners...  Ladies are served first and men last, which was very entertaining to see on tables with 3+ people.  The conversation wasn't stuffy and even though my husband and I were probably the youngest couple in the whole restaurant, we didn't feel snubbed at all...   While our time in Chi-Town was really limited and we were left wanting to savor more of her culinary offerings, we must admit that our dinner here ranks as one of the best, if not the best, we've ever had.  Hopefully we'll get to visit again.",0.9945,0.823,0.135,0.042,0.45953703703703713

We opted for the tasting menu.  Most of the courses were average.  A couple of courses could have been special with some modifications.   The white sturgeon ""caviar"" course was creative in making fake caviar eggs from a sturgeon puree, but it lacked flavor to take it to the next level.   The fois gras with mango and pineapple was overloaded with too much sweet and only needed one fruit to go with it.   The scottish salmon with sorrel was one of the worst courses that I have had at a fine dining restaurant.  The salmon was cooked perfectly but both of us found the sorrel cream sauce to be unpalatable.  It paired with the salmon horribly. The cheese course was very good, and the chocolate truffles at the end of the meal were fantastic. The truly most disappointing part of the meal was actually the wine.  We ordered a bottle of a nice pinot noir.  We both had never had pinot noir so wasn't quite sure what to expect.  The sommelier brought the bottle over, took the cork out looked at it and then left it on a tray for us to examine.  Noticed a couple of crystals on the side of the cork that was in the bottle.  Not knowing what it was suppose to taste like didn't say anything.  Looking back on it I know the wine was off.  There is fault on my part for not saying something at the time, but I do believe this is something the sommelier should have noticed.

If I could offer one small improvement, I felt that each course came so quickly after the other, that we hardly had time to fully relax and anticipate the next course.  Maybe that was because the valet told us that their service included 3 hours in the parking garage....maybe that was a factor?   By the way, how great is that they provide you with a beautiful litlle pound cake/cookie to take home and enjoy the next morning with a cup of coffee!  A reminder of an elegant night enjoyed!",0.9948,0.718,0.282,0.0,0.5979761904761904
2012-09-09,4.0,"I'm about as close to 4.5 stars as you can be without bumping it up to 5. Here's why: The food itself was phenomenal. I'm not going to go into specific detail as the menu is likely to change by the time you'll go there anyway, just know that it is equal parts playful, beautiful, and delicious. The service was beyond impeccable. By far the best service I've had a a single-Michelin star restaurant. Everyone is friendly. The timing is perfect. They really get the details right. Here's where I take issue with Tru: 1. Decor. I like minimalism. I like modern. And I even like the idea of letting the food, and not the space, be the star of the show. Unfortunately, Tru has taken the idea just a little too far, and the result is a strange waiting area (not a bar) inside from the entrance where you wait for your table, followed by a large dining room that is just a bit too open and generally lacking in character. 2. Proteins. As I said, the food was amazing, and I'd happily order any of the 6 courses we enjoyed again. My problem is that out of those 6 courses (as well as some lovely and unexpected amuse-style interjections between courses), only one was protein based. And that protein wasn't wagyu beef, wasn't sweetbreads, wasn't even pork belly or something similar. It was chicken. Delicious chicken, with some lovely accompaniments to be sure. But chicken is still just chicken at the end of the day. And when you drop in excess of $500 for two for a meal, I don't think its unfair to ask for some elevated protein options.  Among Chicago foodie circles these days its almost impossible to have a culinary discussion without talking about Alinea and Next. I'd humbly submit that despite my minor complaints, Tru still belongs in any serious foodie conversation.",0.9943,0.797,0.174,0.03,0.6665438397581254

2012-08-29,5.0,"Over two years after we first dinned here. we decided to come back and celebrate my birthday. I think after all the other dinning experiences we've had in the past two years, I really wanted to try Tru again and see where it stands when compared to other Michelin starred restaurants.  By the minute we walked in, they treated you as if you were the only customers and all attention was on you. And it's my birthday, so everyone said happy birthday to me, which made the birthday girl really happy :). The service was top notch, I always appreciate the attentions to details--black napkin for my black dress, purse stool next to my feet, and the happy birthday print on the menu.  We went for the Chef's collection, plus some caviar. Needless to say, every course's presentation was beautiful.  -Caviar: it has the most memorable presentation as the caviar was presented on some gorgeous white coral. We are rookies when it comes to caviar, so all I can say is, it's YUMMY! :) -White sturgeon ""caviar"", rested on avocado. This chef's take on caviar is just as delicious as the real caviar we just had, if not better. I think the avocado made it.  -Day boat scallop: it had a very profound Asian flavor to it, i think it's the ginger and thai chili. This was the start of this underlying Asian flavor of tonight's dinner.  -Summer tomato salad: refreshing, summery, and it preserves the natural flavors of tomatoes while made it more visually appealing. It made me feel less guilty about going out because I was eating all the vitamins!  -Dashi flan: i think this might be the least memorable dish of all night. I don't remember what it is... -Foral artichoke: it was some artichoke creamy soup with edible flowers on top. The flavors were amazing, and the presentation was pretty. Loved it! -Alaskan halibut: another dish with more of an Asian twist than French in my mind. It tasted like a Thai halibut curry. Don't get me wrong, I loved it, but I thought Tru is supposed to be more like modern French? I still remember the foie gras ravioli we had at our first visit. Now they went for Thai flavors?  -Jidori chicken: very tender, and had foie gras and black truffle shaving. It was the high note of the night. But again, I think there's some soy sauce-ish tasting sauce on the plate. A little odd to couple that with foie gras, but oh well, I loved their chicken.  Then comes the cheese cart, then the vanilla parfait and banana ice cream presented by ""George"", some monkey statue that made me laugh. It's kinda weird to present dessert on a monkey statue, maybe another hint of the thai underlying tone?  Last but not least is the dessert cart, I asked for one of each, a girl can never have too many desserts!  When we left, they gave us each a treat to take home. Very thoughtful and a nice touch for an amazing dinner!  It's definitely worth a Michelin Star, and we will definitely be back again!",0.9969,0.838,0.148,0.014,0.5141784037558685

Food:  We liked it.  We weren't awed, we felt like we had tasted similar flavors at other restaurants.  We thought they tried to present the food differently by plating it on interesting servers but that was it as far as it went for unique qualities.  I would highly recommend the homemade truffles and chocolates - it was the best part of the meal.  And the dessert wines and ports - excellent selection.",0.9953,0.718,0.282,0.0,0.6420588235294117

We ordered the 8 course Chef's special which ended up being 11 courses after the extras everyone gets by dining here. My favorites were the soups. One was a pea soup with a sub zero cream center. The other was a duck soup that was made at our table using a sophisticated bunson burner-esque heater. The savory flavor or this soup made it the best I've ever had.

The wife and I decided to celebrate our 7 year anniversary here and we will NEVER forget our experience thanks to the staff and chef!  When we were seated at our table the server provided us their menus, leather booklets with simple, yet elegant looking descriptions of their offerings.  Upon closer examination, we realized they printed our names into the menu and wished us a happy anniversary!  Holy cow!  From there, we decided to order the 9 course Chef's Collection where the chef pretty much throws his entire arsenal at you; a full frontal assault on your taste buds.  They say it's a 9 course meal, but they don't count the pre-appetizer, pre-mains courses, pre-desserts, post-desserts, etc, etc, etc, as a course!  Needless to say, while the portions were small, the flavors were large and we did NOT leave hungry!   So, not only did they provide us with customized personal menus, but they even brought out a mini-cupcake-thing served on a plate with a hand-drawn happy anniversary message with our names drawn on it prior to our dessert!   Now, I feel like I have to comment on their service.  Everyone working there is a professional and knows how to make their customers feel special.  They were extremely friendly, yet personable and showed a genuine interest in making sure your short time with them would be the absolute best dinner experience you will ever have.  Everything, from the non-soap stained silverware (I couldn't believe how spotless everything was), to the elegant crystal drinking glasses, was marked for excellence.   For a special occasion place I couldn't recommend this place any more than I already have to every one of my friends!  Seriously guys, if you're looking for somewhere exceptional to take your significant other and have some coin to spare and a suit/dress that you've been meaning to wear since last winter, give this place a shot.  And then afterwards go for a stroll down Michigan Ave.  This is seriously one of the best Chicago has to offer.",0.9964,0.8,0.17,0.03,0.5941170634920636

Small Amuse-bouche served on a mirror plate. I have no idea what it was except it was a square cube of soft food with light foam. 2. The salad was a heirloom lettuce with baked figs, cripsy prosciutto, and vanilla balsamic vinegrette which was heavenly. The figs and prosciutto great a unique balance of savory and sweet that goes well with the lettuce. This is simply the best salad ever. 3. Grass fed beef tenderloin with caramelized onion tart and cabernet reduction. Simply the the most tender piece of beef ever with a delicate sauce that complemented well with the red wine that evening 4. For dessert, an amazing chocolate tart with raspberry and slight flecks of gold foil. Beautiful and one of the best desserts. Service was great and quick. The food is a fine balance of art and flavors that should be experienced at least once in your lifetime!

2012-07-01,5.0,"A good restaurant has delicious food. A great restaurant has that + good service. A superior restaurant (warranting a four-star status with the Trib and many other accolades) is one in which food, service and atmosphere combine to create a memorable experience. Tru is one of these rare superior restaurants.  My husband and I celebrated our first wedding anniversary at Tru with the 9-course tasting menu. The insanely creative and whimsical menu items played with unusual texture, flavor and presentation combinations. We continued to be surprised through each course from the array of river salmon served in a platter mimicking a rushing river with the use of dry ice to the humorous miniature monkey statues garnering our tiny desserts. And, the sophisticated art gallery decor of the restaurant paired well with the food because our plates were honestly works of art in themselves. (Although, one negative would be that it felt a bit superfluous at times. One example of this is the fruit leather hanging on clothes lines - It seemed to be an exaggerated response to what could really be comparable to a lunchbox fruit snack.) In the end, Tru is the most expensive and extravagant restaurant my husband and I had ever set foot in, yet we did not feel out of place, rushed or looked down upon like we have felt in the past at other ritzy restaurants. We were able to take our time, enjoying every tasty bite while joking with our servers. We received additional surprise special treatment with a personalized menu in the beginning of our meal and a celebratory cupcake in honor of our anniversary at the end.

2012-06-22,5.0,"Before going into my review for my recent visit (in February 2012) I have to say that I used to have a lot of skepticism about Tru.  I first went to the restaurant in 2008 with my family and was frankly unimpressed compared to other comparable restaurants in Chicago.  I ranked the likes of Charlie Trotter's, Alinea, Spiaggia, Ria, Next and others all above Tru. Having been back in 2012 for the six-course tasting, I couldn't feel more different about the experience.  My first experience at Tru featured rather simple and unimpressive ingredient combinations, lackluster platings and a stale and uninventive menu. The new tasting reflects a much more adventurous, playful, creative and interesting concept entirely.  Dishes featured some of the latest techniques pioneered by chefs like Ferran Adria while (largely) eschewing overly gimmicky shows of liquid nitrogen and the like. The amuse was a cute winter scene complete with a snowman - this was the one dish that didn't quite hit the mark as far as flavor goes (somewhat lackluster) and was heavy on the showmanship but enjoyable nonetheless as an amuse. The first course, tru's creme caviar was PHENOMENAL.  This was the perfect intersection of modern technique to create the ""caviar"" while still packing in excellent balance, flavor, and purpose.  The creamy avacado paired perfectly with the rich but mellow caviar and crackers.  I wish I could buy this. The next course, a hazelnut soup with foie gras was also excellent.  The emphasis was moreso on the nutty flavor than foie which I was thankful for.  I had an overly rich foie soup in San Fran last year that I couldn't finish.  This dish on the otherhand was well balanced and great for the cold weather. The next dish was an excellent pork belly dish with potato (and truffle I believe).  Not as memorable as some but I recall enjoying it very much. Up next was my least favorite dish - a white fish (halibut or seabass I think) served with the skin.  The smoky flavor was overpowering for me and as I'm not a huge fan of eating fish with the skin on, the texture was too much. Following the fish was a saving grace: squab.  This was my favorite dish on the menu and one I can still remember.  It reminded me of a squab dish I had at alinea back in 2010 and made the trip back to Tru worth the effort, price, and risk. Not much to say on the cheese course as it varies by what you choose but Tru has one of the best cheese carts in the city. I'm not as much of a sweet tooth so while the dessert and candies were excellent, they didn't make the meal (granted they didn't fail either - excellent balance, flavor, composition and presentation). Overall well worth a re-examination if you haven't been in a while and ABSOLUTELY a must if you've never been.",0.9986,0.752,0.213,0.034,0.5189660066709247

You are doted on without it feeling obtrusive. Every plate and utensil is always where it should be. Errant crumbs are whisked away at every course.

The three tastiest were the smoked sturgeon ""caviar"", the butternut squash soup with ginger marshmallows and the duroc pork belly roulade. The pork had great flavor but was a bit drier than one would expect for pork belly. The bread service is great with buttery mini brioche and crispy cheesy, delicate Parmesan crackers. Our biggest complaint would be that there was never enough delicious sauce served - even when a sauce ""pusher""/knife was given to use. After dinner the mignardises were a nice touch - the lemongrass French macaron not so great but the fried thimbles (not that small though) of custardy like dough were really good as well as the apricot soft gummy-like dot. The liquid raspberry filled thin shell of chocolate with hints of gold leaf on top were a nice way to end the meal.

We waited almost an hour to receive our first course, and the wait for the larger dishes was terribly long. One of our servers apologized for the wait, and they tried to appease us with some truffles at the end, but it was really a drag.  The first course-- the Sturgeon ""caviar""-- was delicious; the subsequent courses were not very memorable. The Halibut and chicken were cooked to perfection, but there was nothing particularly impressive or interesting about them. The chicken was served on a log; but the log was just...a log. I would have been more impressed, had not Next recently wowed me with their own take on the log-serving dish: the gorgeous and aromatic ""autumn scene"", where the serving-log in question was cradling smoking apples, leaves, hay. If you're going to have a log, there might as well be fire! Dessert was served on some strange monkey candelabras. It was an attempt to be whimsical, but in the staid atmosphere of Tru, the monkeys just seemed ridiculous. They added nothing to the dish.

2012-06-01,4.0,"This is one of those reviews that really deserves 3.5 stars.  My husband and I finally had a good reason to try some very fine dining in Chicago - our 5th wedding anniversary.  We dressed up all fancy and took a cab downtown like real adults.  It was nice to have an occasion to dress up for.   We ordered the 6 course Grand Collection and a bottle of Moscato since we were celebrating but don't really care for Champagne.  I didn't take pictures of every course, but I still remember most of them, so here it goes: White sturgeon ""caviar"": very pretty and cool in concept.  in reality, too salty.  Also, we only got 3 tiny crackers with it.   Say what?  Not enough crackers with a course of any kind, at any restaurant is a major pet peeve of mine.  I'd give this one an A-.  one the most memorable courses. Amuse bouche: not a course exactly, but it was still served.  Twas disgusting.  Really.  We both had to consume an entire glass of wine to get the icky taste out of our mouths. F- English Pea Soup:  Yummy!  I liked the peas.  It was very beautiful, looked like a spring wreath at the bottom of the bowl.  It had these micro croutons were really good and we could have used a few more.  It was missing something, flavor-wise.  B+ fava bean cappeletti: I don't care for ham but it was very delicate, pretty and tasty, but not very memorable or super interesting. B+ alaskan halibut: Fish was delicious and cooked perfectly.  The mushrooms were also very yummy.  But again, not mind blowing or anything.  B+ Jidori Chicken:  What can I say?  It's chicken.  It wasn't special chicken.  The plating was fun and cool.  The fiddlehead ferns were my favorite part of the dish.  B At some point we also received a fun grass + ultra tiny clothes pins + dried fruit paper hanging like laundry.  Tasty and very cute.  Solid A for the expensive fruit roll up. Dessert was campfire s'mores and a chocolate with red pear sorbet.  Both were quite tasty.  We also received a special happy anniversary plate with mini-cake.  The cake was dry.  A- They brought around a dessert cart, which was  has  probably 1 dozen different chocolates and candies.  The server explains what they all are and then says ""would you care for any of these desserts (or something like that), it's our compliment"".   I wasn't sure if I should say ""sure, i'll take all of them"" or what.  So I instead I was like ""ok, I'll take one of those *points*"".  And she says ""would care for another?"" and i say ""ok, I'll take one of those *points*"".  And so on, until we had all but 2 of every confectionary from the cart.   Awkward. Finally they bring us two chocolates, laden with gold.  They are pretty.  And filled with cinnamon liquid.  Delicious! I can only compare my experience at Tru to one other restaurant - Europea in Montreal.  I am sorry to say Europea kind of kicked Tru's ass.  We had many more courses at Europea, they were all really interesting AND delicious, and the service wasn't nearly as fussy.   I would still recommend Tru for a very special occasion because it was a fun experience, but it just wasn't what you might expect for the money.  If you are counting on your money going a long way, you might want to consider going elsewhere.",0.999,0.712,0.227,0.061,0.644863967940891

Well, we went and I'm happy to say it was indeed worth it! As others have noted the service is impeccable--indeed it borders on intimidating!  But once I got over it being insanely attentive I realized it wasn't just service, it was Kabuki Theater.  Then I was able to get into the spirit of the thing. Food and cocktails (ranging from $18-$22 for the curious) were excellent!  And in addition to your regular courses there is an amuse included, and bread service (the pumpernickel onion bread was to die for. I could happily eat it every day of my life!), and a palate-cleansing interlude.  You begin to feel that the prix fixe is not only worth it, but something of a bargain ;) After trying my boyfriend's Scotchman Can Take a Punch (one of their signature cocktails) I decided I wanted one for myself, even though if you had asked my I would have told you I didn't like any of the ingredients in it.  THAT is high praise for a restaurant--making you eat or drink something you were sure you didn't like!  I even had a second one.   For food I had the chestnut soup, which was wonderful, and the short ribs, which were some of the best I've ever had.  Our server explained they sous vide and seared, so they were like no short ribs I've ever had before.  An amazing dish.  They were sauced tableside, and the accompaniments were beautiful. I was particularly impressed by the tiny carved apple cups holding herb oil.  Tru pays attention to every last detail. The cheese cart was also a treat.  Another server brought it around, and he was extremely well-informed about everything.  I was impressed by his memory, to say the least! The dessert was the only misstep--I got the ""s'mores"" and I found the different chocolate mousses and cakes to be rather one note, and presentation wasn't as interesting either.  I've had much better desserts at other restaurants, and I have to say the ones I make are better as well :P But I didn't mind.  The rest of the meal was fabulous.",0.9967,0.764,0.196,0.041,0.6300635546789394

They bring out a cart of cheese and let you pick out as much as you want to sample. They do the same thing for dessert which is kind of fun.

2012-04-17,5.0,"[For the full review with pictures, see the link to my blog on my profile.] Leaving Tru, I asked inly, is there a better one-star Michelin restaurant in the country? If there is, I certainly haven't found it. From my initial email correspondence with the restaurant's general manager to the deft handling of our table, every aspect of service demonstrated nonpareil attention to detail: the choice of black or white serviette, the synchronized clearing of plates, the sweeping of crumbs after every course, the ushering to the washroom (and the staff's militant commitment to ensuring a safe return to your seat) and everything in between. And then there was the food, which is almost without fault, especially on the savory side. We started the meal, as many restaurants do, with Comté-filled gougères, the ratio of which was tilted a bit more in the direction of choux pastry than I would have liked. But that's not to suggest that their starch program isn't on point. Indeed, Tru convinced me to end my year-long moratorium on consuming bread in restaurants. Let me explain why. Of the four breads on offer, I asked to have a round of rosemary impregnated brioche. With the gentlest squeeze, an indentation formed, leaving buttery residue on my digits. At that point I knew I would have to indulge. As for the more substantial items, three courses in succession left me genuinely puzzled why the rouge guide would consider the restaurant inferior to the townhouse on Armitage from the previous night. First, there were the back-to-back fish courses--a roasted striped bass with a sensorily balanced combination of brown butter purée, pickled daikon, white soy powder and key lime supremes followed by tilefish anointed with an umami-laden mushroom broth, shitakes, sake, ginger and soy--beautifully cooked with each fillet teeming with moisture and flaking into bite-sized quadrilaterals.  And then there was the anticipation that preceded the Jidori chicken. First black serviettes were placed on the table. Not a minute later the plated dish arrived on a halved piece of timber. Finishing tableside, Aaron glazed the breast with a rosemary-chicken jus. With the foie gras cream, chicken crackling, quenelle of mushroom purée and pile of honshimeji, this was not a dish for the sodium sensitive, to wit, for me it was the jam. Not everything was as stunning as the first twelve or so savory items, however; a coconut milk snowball palate cleanser that formally transitioned us into the dessert portion of the meal had the texture of poorly made ice cream: gritty, icy and the mango-passion fruit purée in which it was sitting was cloyingly sweet. And then there was the penultimate dessert course--a half inch plane of dark, dense Valrhona chocolate--which proved to be tantamount to the experience of driving with a flat tire: one may be able to make a little progress, but eventually it becomes clear that one has no choice but to stop. There was just too much chocolate and nothing the timid pear sorbet could do to cut down on the dish's richness. However, with the unrelenting friandise that included, inter alia, root beer floats, canalés, mango pate de fruits and exploding chocolate truffles, neither minor lapse had the slightest wobble in my affinity for Tru.",0.9393,0.911,0.065,0.024,0.46613141380583234

2012-03-24,5.0,"This perspective is from a habitué of neighborhood joints who seldom dines at gastronomic shrines of this caliber.  A special occasion called for a splurge far in excess of what we would normally spend.  The challenge, though, was finding a place with menu items that would appeal to my missus, who is strictly a 'meat-and-potatoes' person. After comparing a dozen-or-so menus online, I found Tru's to be flexible and varied enough to accommodate both timid and adventurous palates.  Their ever-evolving three-course prix fixe menu offers a choice of 7 appetizers, 7 entrees, and dessert or a selection from the cheese cart. Our apprehensions about condescending or snooty service were put to rest from the moment we stepped inside.  The maître d' and wait staff were absolutely wonderful.  They took obvious delight in answering our sometimes silly questions and describing everything on our plates.  They didn't hover over us but somehow magically appeared at the precise moment we needed something.  The only gaffe in the service --  choreographed like a ballet -- was when one server started to whisk away a plate before we were done with it. In this comfortable, hushed and minimalist dining room, the focus is on art, attractive plating, and wine.  Tru's wine list is voluminous.  Being hopelessly ignorant about wine, we asked the sommelier for his recommendation, which turned out to be stellar. Tru's kitchen happily accommodates dietary restrictions and individual preferences.  Our entire meal was a uniformly remarkable spectrum of both familiar and exotic flavor and texture combinations.  As for plating, we observed foodies at other tables taking pictures of their food.   A meal at a more pedestrian restaurant the following night seemed ordinary and bland by comparison. Now ... at the risk of sounding like a rube, my pet peeve concerning haute cuisine in general is the dainty portion sizes relative to price (for cripes sake, even the free samples at Costco are more generous!).  Alright, I'll take my ten lashes with a limp shred of frisée for saying that.  But this is why we seldom visit such high-end restaurants. Having spent several hundreds of dollars on this one dinner, though, we did NOT leave Tru hungry or disappointed -- the three-course prix fixe meal was augmented by many, many extras and surprises.  One of the high points was when our server brought chocolates with a liquid salty-caramel filling and instructed us on how to eat them without making a mess.  It was a most enjoyable and memorable evening.",0.9887,0.836,0.124,0.041,0.588517316017316

I won't spoil the surprise of how each dish is plated, but I will say that the chef is definitely having some fun in the kitchen. The amuse bouche was awesome! We chose from the 3-course pre-fixe menu and added a cheese course between the entree and dessert. The grass-fed beef carpaccio and duck consomme were delicious and perfectly prepared. The only course that I didn't love was the wild scottish hare. It was a beautifully crafted plate and the accompanying vegetables were perfect, but the portion was small and the jus that the server added table-side overwhelmed the dish with smokiness. My wife loved her truffled lobster and it was definitely a larger portion than the hare. The cheese course was better than I expected from previous reviewers' comments. I liked being able to choose from the cheeses right in front of you, as opposed to simply ordering off a menu or having the server choose for you. The server presenting the cheese cart was very knowledgeable and helpful, too. We enjoyed everything we tried, and the cheeses paired well with the provided chutney and honey. Dessert was the highlight of the evening for me. My wife loved her campfire of s'more, but the pumpkin patch blew me away. The different flavors and textures all combined together to make a very unique and wonderful dish. Super creative and fun plating!! The service was perfect. Besides flawless service throughout the meal, we really appreciated how each staff member greeted us on the way in and said ""goodnight"" or ""goodbye"" on the way out.

2012-02-04,5.0,"Dining at Tru is luxurious experience where you pampered from start to finish. We were pleasantly surprised with the ambiance when we arrived; we had expected an old fashioned vibe but Tru manages to fuse classic and modern decor in a manner that works. The symbol of an open box on the menu, charger and elsewhere in the restaurant symbolizes that they will strive to keep taking care of you - and this was definitely case between the ultra attentive service to the never ending extra treats they bring to your table. Tru has a large open main dining room (where we dined) and two smaller rooms that are available for private functions. Our primary waiter thoroughly explained the menu. There is an a la carte option (choice of one of seven appetizers, seven entrees, and cheese cart service or dessert for $98 per/person), two tasting menus (Grand with six courses and Chef's Collection with nine for $110 and $145 respectively) and a menu of Luxury courses you can add to either the a la carte or tasting menus (i.e. Australian Wagyu, Perigord balck truffle shavings, a menu of caviars etc.). The Grand tasting menu is about the same quantity of food as the a la carte option, but you receive double the variety (six versus three courses). Entire table participation is suggested for the tasting menus, but not required. There was no pressure or hard sale to purchase the more expensive options or extras, but simply the information was presented. There also is a vast wine menu with a handful of wines by the glass, handful of cocktails and a plethora wines by the bottle. We opted for a relatively inexpensive bottle of bubbly  (there are several bottles of wine priced from $45 to $60 and tons of high end wines for the connoisseur). As a nice touch they offer sparkling water in lieu of still for no extra cost.  As there were a couple items on the tasting menus that we did not find appealing, and some of the a la carte options were singing to us went a la carte. I almost chose the Skate for my starter but at the last second selected the Pumpkin Gnocchi in a veal sauce with truffle oil. This dish looked, smelled and tasted phenomenal. For my entree I went the Wild Scottish Hare with Flavors of Winter; I had never eaten hare before so thought I would try something new. While the dish again looked beautiful I found the hare a tad too rich; not at all a fault of the chef, but I learned that hare is not my favorite animal. My wife ordered the prime beef ribeye wish I tasted and was an superb cut of meat and expertly prepared.  For dessert we had seen the elegant cheese cart rolled about the restaurant and it had caught our fancy and we both opted for a cheese course. There is wide variety of French cheeses, goat, cow and sheep. The server spends a good deal of time carefully explaining each of the cheeses and you are permitted to each choose three; there are also some fruits, honey and bread to accompany the cheese. All six cheeses we chose were great. I decided to also order one of the desserts (Pumpkin Patch) in addition and am glad I did. The presentation was so beautiful I did not want to eat it at first; there were miniature pumpkins made out of mousse that looked so real; there also was a bruleed layer connecting the pumpkins and homemade chocolate twizzles.  Tru is a fine dining experience and as such portions are on the small side, but there are so many complimentary extra treats you receive that you leave very satisfied. Prior to the appetizer we received two amuse bouches, one of which was very fun and memorable. We were informed that the chef wanted us to have some snow since it had been a mild winter and they put a bowl of liquid on front of you and pour a liquid into it and voila, it turns into snow! They then put a glass top over the snow and place a snowman made out of mousse on top. Then there is bread service (four different homemade breads and they will offer you seconds and thirds). After dessert they bring you a cart with several different small treats (i.e. homemade marshmallows, chocolate truffles, apple gummy candy etc.) and encourage you to pick as many as you want. Then they bring you an outstanding delicate piece of chocolate with the bill filled with liquid and on the way out hand you a homemade muffin to take home for breakfast.  Service at Tru is also high end; you really feel pampered. Teams of servers present your food in unison. You are escorted to the bathroom. They want to make sure any allergies or personal preferences you have are accommodated. The pace of the meal is relaxed but not slow. While the servers are not quite as personable as those at Alinea, they are otherwise as polished as they come. Many people thought that Tru would be the recipient of a second star from Michelin and after my dinner there tonight I have to put myself in this camp. My wife and I both agreed that this was one of the best overall dining experiences we have and are certain to return.",0.9989,0.845,0.133,0.022,0.4831268666733782

None of the courses were memorable, and there was 1 substitution that should have been a downright embarrassment.  While my fellow diners enjoyed a course of lobster with truffles, I had 3 small fingerling potatoes with a couple onions....doesn't seem like a fair trade for someone with a shellfish allergy.  Guess I should have just kept with the lobster & given it to my husband to enjoy.  After 7 courses, I expect to be satiated, but I was still hungry and ate more bread than I ever thought would be needed to fill up.  Not to mention, the courses were spread so far apart to make the time last (3.5 hours) that we were looking at our watches and even had the temptation to pull out our phones to pass the time waiting. The sommelier had decent wine pairings for the full tasting, but the recommendation for just a single glass of wine was way off.  I've had a ton of excellent New Zealand Chardonnays, but the one she recommended tasted more like a bad Sauvignon Blanc...just the opposite of what I was going for.  She didn't even come back to check whether we enjoyed the wine, especially since it took 4 courses get finally get it down.  Had much better luck selecting my own bottle later in the meal, and it actually complimented the courses we were eating.  The other thing that was odd was that when the sommelier poured the wines, she only gave 1/2 to 2/3 of a pour that a sommelier in any other restaurant would pour for a tasting.  In fact, a couple times, the other servers poured the wine, and we were hoping to not see the sommelier again since she didn't add any value or information on what we were drinking. All in all, we did enjoy the atmosphere, the company of our friends, and the main waiter was a pretty nice guy, but my former love of Tru was ruined by an extremely overpriced NYE dinner that left a lot to be desired.  For a better value, service, food quality, and wine selection, I would definitely stick with Girl & the Goat, Longman & Eagle, or (my current favorite) Alinea.",0.9931,0.797,0.149,0.054,0.5363851426351426

It's like presentation over shadows the taste so you kind of forget the food is just good at best. There was a lot of gelatin going on.

The menu provides pre-fixed menus of 3-8 courses as well as a vegetarian menu option that was not a second thought to the meat centerpieces. The wine pairings were thoughtful and the sommelier was extremely knowledgeable. To leave room for my future experience at Alinea and because of a few minor execution issues, I'm going to give Tru 4.5 stars. white sturgeon ""caviar"", avocado, hazelnut - I loved the frivolity of this innovative dish. They pureed sturgeon and mixed it into cream. Then with a dropper, they submerged the cream droplets into highly chilled grapeseed oil so that they formed perfect round balls. They served the crème fish balls as 'caviar' on top of avocado puree in a caviar dish. For the vegetarian menu they kept the same concept but used cilantro essence instead of fish in the cream balls. Great start to the meal. chilled kohlrabi contained within itself, curry oil - A play on chilled potato soup, vichyssoise, but exchange potato with kohlrabi. Kohlrabi tastes like the stem of broccoli and can be found at many summer farmers markets. The soup was refreshing but a little over salted. The presentation was impressive with the carved out kohlrabi sitting on a bed of dry ice. duroc pork belly, yellow sweet corn, black truffle - This may have been one of my least favorite dishes. The pork belly was dried out and pounded into the shape of a flat lollipop with its meat and fat layers mimicking flavor swirls. Some of the accompanying sauces were tasty but I missed the juicy flavor that makes pork belly so amazing, as well as acidity on the plate. Also, the black truffle was good but could have been substituted with a flavorful funghi. roasted wild striped bass, banyuls brown butter emulsion, daikon - The plate had a minimalist appeal to it. Unfortunately the fish was overcooked and so lacked the tender flake that you expect with a morsel of fish fillet. jidori chicken, foie gras, wild mushroom, salsify - A beautiful dish with the tender chicken breast slice likely cooked in a sous vide method. The chicken rolled around a foie gras mousse which cannot help but be delicious. This was a lovely dish. poached quince, wildflower honey, cassis - Again, beautiful presentation. I have never eaten a quince fruit whole but rather only in its quince paste form. I could have this dessert multiple times and maybe will attempt it at home.

2011-12-14,5.0,"I would give Tru 10 stars if I could :) That's how outstanding our experience at Tru was. I chose this restaurant to celebrate our anniversary and was a little apprehensive as my husband is a vegetarian. But they assured me when I made reservations that they could make 9 courses all vegetarian.  From the minute we gave our car to the valet till the end when we got our coats back - it was an amazing and the most luxurious evening. It's not just about the food or the ambience - it is truly an experience. I was warned that our whole dinner would take around 2.5 hours at least. As soon as we gave our car to the valet (who also wished us a Happy Anniversary) - we were walked to our table, and on our way we were wished at least by 5 different people a Happy Anniversary. The place has a dress code - it deserves a dress code :) We were a little intimidated at first, but after a few minutes we were put at ease. We were waited on by 5 people during dinner. We chose the 8 course vegetarian grand menu. I will not go into the details of all the courses, but let me say that the food was outstanding. It looked like art, and there were a couple of courses where my husband and me did not want to put our forks on the plate - because it was soo pretty! You always have 2 people working in sync : to bring out a course or to pour water or clear the table ware - it is like a synchronized and orchestrated show but without being too pompous and pretentious. The service was impeccable and the attention to detail was truly commendable. The servers were very knowledgeable about the food being put out in front of us and answered all our questions patiently.  As for the food, let's say we ate the fluffiest of gnocchi, tastiest of potatoes and the earthiest of mushrooms. We tasted flavor profiles that we didn't know could be put together so well. It was an excellent menu and put together beautifully. Chef Martin is a genius. It was an amazing dinner, and was made special because of the impeccable service. It was a great choice for our anniversary date. I have never been to a Michelin-star restaurant, but Tru totally deserves it. What else can you say about a place that gives you personalized menus with your names printed on it to take home.",0.9973,0.818,0.172,0.01,0.6746031746031745
2011-12-10,3.0,"Let me start this review by saying that I went into my Tru experience being pretty sick with a mild stomach flu. A friend had made a reservation which included a VIP experience-tour of the restaurant, champagne & a tour of the kitchen. Being the foodie freak I am, I waited a week in anticipation to eat at one of the top restaurants in Chicago. Then it hit. Stomach flu-crippling pain and near death sickness. I asked my friend if the restaurant could re-schedule. Nope. If I opted out, I would end up costing my group the price of the entire meal. After taking a 5 hour nap I got up and went to Tru.  Upon walking in, one is immediately taken aback by the decor. Simple furniture and white walls showcased the brilliant artwork in this restaurant. Check out the light fixture called ""stay"" and be sure to check out Warhol's Marilyn. Upon being seated, we received our glass of champagne. We were given a while to think about what we wanted to order and trying to suck it up and be a champ, I ordered the 6 course tasting menu. I wasn't sure if I could stomach it all, but at least Tru offers an excellent selection of in-house made breads. Try the fleur de sel brioche and the pumpernickel. Onto dinner: We started with the sturgeon ""caviar"", which was smoky and clever, placed atop an avocado mixture. I loved its presentation inside a caviar tin. My favorite course. We moved onto a soup which was artfully presented in a kohlrabi fruit with dry ice. The pork belly was rich and unctuous-my taste buds were happy, but my stomach was not. When we got to the whitefish, I took a few bites and had to hand it to my bf. Now for the low point of my dining experience at Tru-the chicken with foie gras. There was no way I could eat that. Too sick. The waiter asked me a couple times if something was wrong and I kept telling them no. Although it was nice of them to inquire, it honestly made me feel like a jerk for not eating it.  Onto dessert: the tasting menu included a quince and marscarpone mini-dessert that was delicious. Then came my favorite part of the meal-the mini-dessert cart. Now I was feeling better. I tried the truffle, homemade egg nog marshmallows, mini-macaron(size of a dime) and a tiny bread pudding. These were all phenomenal.  As an ending to a meal we were handed ""exploding truffles"" that were so beautifully topped with gold leaf. Popped it into my mouth and it literally gushed out peppermint liquid. So cool. We were then given the bill(not cheap, kiddos), and lead into the kitchen for our tour. We got to see everything from the Versace tea set to the bartenders and even meet the chef. Honestly I thought this was the best part of the meal. Upon leaving we were given a little tea cake to eat the next morning with coffee. Cute. Overall, I am not sure this restaurant lives up to the hype it is given around Chicago. Although inventive, there were no stand-out flavors worth remembering. For the price of this meal I would have expected something phenomenal. Also, the fact that I couldn't change my reservation without being charged the price of the entire meal because of extreme sickness kind of turned me off. Once again, this could be completely based on my personal situation that day, but I am not sure I will be back.",0.9977,0.771,0.175,0.054,0.6418577307466193
2011-12-08,5.0,"I considered taking off a star due to the price tag that goes along with the Tru experience, but ended up with 5.  Because it's just that:  an experience.  And a well-executed one to be sure.  Bravo, Chef Martin!   The single misstep of the night was the utter lack of a valet.  We waited at the curb for several minutes before I finally went in and asked.  Might have cost them if it had been -12 outside or sleeting, but I'm in my twenties.  I can handle the walk.   Throughout the evening, I was delighted by the staff.  I didn't encounter a single pretentious person, and instead felt that they enjoyed our enthusiasm and wonder at the whole place.  We were the youngest patrons by about 20 years, and everyone else looked bored and like they hated their dining companion.  Our lead server, David, made the experience fun, and the sommelier Jen was spot on with her recommendations.  From the coordinated water pour to service of courses, the Tru staff is a well-oiled machine.   Side note:  Tru's art collection includes Adam Fuss's ""My Ghost"" series.  One of my personal favorites.  A real treat if you get to see it, as the collection rotates and often copies are displayed over originals. Food:  We chose the grand collection.   First:  comte cheese gougere.  Loved the lightness, was a bit iffy on the Ritz cracker flavor.  As it was a bonus, I'll go easy on this one. Amuse Bouche:  cucumber salad on gelee, bouchot mussel veloute.  Fairly insubstantial in comparison to other courses but well-balanced. Second: white sturgeon ""caviar"", avocado, hazelnut, with herbed crackers.  My husband had never tried caviar so Chef Martin's pearled sturgeon was the perfect gateway drug.  Husband says:""My favorite course of the whole meal.""  Success! Third: chilled kohlrabi contained within itself with curry oil.  SO COOL.  This dish is served in a hollowed out kohlrabi with dry ice, so it comes out bubbling.  The complex pyrotechnical presentation paired perfectly with the singular flavor of the kohlrabi. Fourth: duroc pork belly, potato two ways, black truffle.  I am not a truffle fan.  I think they're overrated.  However, I love all things resembling bacon.  Maybe I'm trashy.  Whatever.  The pork belly was flavorful and the starch complimented it well.  Yum. Fifth: roasted golden tilefish, banyuls brown butter emulsion, pickled daikon. The tilefish is cooked skin-side down, providing a crisp contrast to the tender fish.  Bravo.  Probably my favorite of the night. Sixth: jidori chicken, foie gras, wild mushroom, salsify.  I wasn't a huge fan of this course.  The chicken was a little undercooked for me.  Husband liked it. A draw. Seventh: We were given the choice between dessert and the cheese cart.  Naturally, I dove for the cheese.  I chose four selections and David recommended a couple more.  They were served with fruit bread and honey.  The sheep's milk cheese came in second, with a simple herbed Mallorca taking the gold medal.  So glad I chose cheese (as always). Husband went for dessert.  I don't recall what it was but he liked my cheese better. The meal ended with coffee and mignardises.  Our car was waiting (valet: redeemed!).  We were sent off with a breakfast nibble for the next morning.  The Grand Collection, a cosmopolitan, Manhattan, half bottle of wine, and tip came out to $475.  Worth it?  YEP.",0.9989,0.767,0.199,0.034,0.5202851762173797
2011-11-28,4.0,"Tru is a very fine restaurant and, based on my experience dining at many Michellin-starred restaurants in Europe, certainly deserves its 1 star. There are plenty of previous detailed reviews on Yelp, so this review tries to capture the overall experience. Tru is all about luxury: The menu is heavy on dishes with foie gras and truffles and there is a dedicated caviar menu.  The wine list is extensive but emphasizes high-end wines.  You could pick something for $80 or $90 a bottle, but they are pushing the $200+ bottles.  Oh, and $20 cocktails. Corkage is an excessive $50/bottle.  (Obviously they are forcing you to give them the profit they would make on a minimum $80 bottle.) The room is elegant and high-ceilinged, with notable modern art (but a few of the pieces are copies, while the originals hide in the owner's residence.)  You are warned multiple times there is a dress code requiring jackets for men - fair enough. There are 3 prix fixe menus:  The standard 3 courses for $96 or tasting menus ""Collections"" for $110 or $145 with extra foie gras and truffle dishes. (We had both the $96 and $110 options.) The cooking is sometimes very creative (for example, sturgeon ""caviar"", which is a confection of  white fish essence pearls), but not always, and the flavors can be on the muted side. A nice touch is the ability to select any dessert instead of the one in your Collection or to substitute a cheese course (as many cheeses from the cart as you like). The service is polished and somewhat stilted in a formal, deferential way, and is team-based, i.e. you will see (at least) 5 or 6 different people bringing items to the table.  While we expected the support servers to bring breads or manage the wine, unlike some other star-level service teams, at Tru we experienced a fragmentation of the service, where we lost the feeling that one waiter was looking after us. So in summary, expect to spend (at least) $400 to $500 for a couple and get a competent and luxurious meal, but don't expect culinary fireworks.",0.9793,0.882,0.097,0.021,0.4691592261904762

2011-11-13,4.0,"Chef Martin is somewhat of a wunderkind - heading the prestigious Tru kitchen at age 29. I was eager to check out his cooking right before the Michelin release.  The amuse bouche was granulated cucumber salad with mussels veloute. The bright-flavored cucumber salad and the umami-abound veloute made an interesting and refreshing start. There were four choices of bread. The cheese crackers and the brioche, the only two that were made in-house - were decent. The other two were made by Red Hen. I actually like Red Hen's French baguette. But Tru's two selections were odd. The white bread had an awkward crust that didn't amount to a real crust and made the bread appear stale. The pumpernickel fared better, but was also a bit stale to my taste. I think Tru should just develop its own bread program. The butter that accompanied the bread was from an unnamed brand from Vermont. It was good, but nothing spectacular.  I had the 6-course tasting with an extra cheese course. The first course was sturgeon caviar. Despite the name, it was actually white sturgeon shaped into the droplets and put in a caviar can - on a bed of avocado puree - complete with the pearl spoon. The dish tasted fine, but it was a bit one-note. Beyond the playful concept, there was no nuance in the flavor-profile. I wish it was a real caviar course. The second dish was chilled kohlrabi soup. It was contained in a hallowed kohlrabi - cool presentation. The soup itself was drizzled with curry oil on top. The combination worked, but it was a touch too salty. And frankly the concept of ""curry"" oil - admittedly a fad in contemporary French cooking nowadays - is funny to people who know a thing or two about spices. But moving on. The third was a pork-belly dish. The pork belly was rolled and cut into a medallion, topped with crisped bacon and shaved truffles. This was fantastic. The pork belly was executed perfectly, and the truffles complemented well with the richness. The accompanying dumpling was also very good. Although this course was oddly placed in the tasting, it was my favorite dish of the night. Fourth course was tilefish. The skin was left on and created a perfect crust. The fish itself was perfectly cooked but under-seasoned. The pickled daikon and the brown butter emulsion helped a bit but ultimately the dish shined on textures but tasted bland. The last savory course was chicken with foie gras rolled into a disc. The presentation was beautiful. It tasted fine but again lacked any nuance beyond salt. Next was the cheese course. I picked one cow, one sheep, and one goat, from creamy to sharp. It was good and fun to pick things out of a cheese cart. But ultimately none of the selections were very memorable or interesting. The palate cleanser was cucumber emulsion. This brought us back to the cucumber amuse bouche - which added some structure to the meal. The emulsion was way too acidic to be pleasant, but it did the job of cleansing my palate. The dessert course was figs, cassis on honey-flavored cream and ice cream. This was a simple dessert that worked on all levels - great produce, great execution, and great combination of flavors and textures. Mignardises came on a trolley. I had one of each. Canele was textbook (rivaled that of L2O). Pomegranate gelee and the chocolate truffle were also excellent. The only item that was sub-par was the macaron, which didn't have the proper airy meringue shell. The take-home snack (fruit-jam muffin) made perfect breakfast the next day.  The sommelier recommended the most expensive glass of wine without mentioning the price. I only realized this when I read the bill. I found that to be slightly presumptuous. But the Pommard Noizons Domaine Berthelemot 2007 was excellent - fruit-forward yet complex with hints of spice. It went well with my entire meal. I also had their Intelligentsia proprietary blend coffee - also excellent.  The space had vaulted ceiling, clean-line but plush furniture, crisp-white linen, with colorful and provocative arts on the wall. I felt I was in a contemporary art museum. It was a stunning dining room fit for special occasions. Service was professional and the pace of the dinner perfect. They still did synchronized presentation, which I found robotic. I appreciated the effort though. After the meal we met Chef Martin - very friendly and personable. The valet warmed my car for me, which was a nice touch. I did think the waitstaff was too austere and humorless. To get to the next level of service, they need to train the waitstaff to be more than just servers.   I was happy with this experience. The execution was good, and the presentation was like artwork. But overall the meal lacked any ""wow"" moments. My dining companion put it well - everything just tasted ""muted."" Tru has the fine-dining format down to a tee, but to be a destination you need more. There's still room to grow.

We have been to a good number of Chicago's nice restaurants and were excited to dine at the well known Tru and compare it to our other dining experiences.  The thing that most stands out about Tru is the attention to flavor that they give. No, the dishes aren't crazy spins on the homey classics like you will find at Graham Elliot or Schwa, but they hone in on the flavor of every bite with carefully picked ingredients and methods of cooking that make for an outstanding meal and because of this  it's modern French cuisine at its finest and deserves 5 stars.

On the flip side though, if you are looking for a fun and relaxed atmosphere to go with a gourmet dining experience, this may not be the place for you.

I wish I could have dined here in the days where Rick Tramonto was still at the helm (TRU stands for TRamonto Unlimited, afterall), but alas, our experience here was forgettable. The decor looked dated and tired, without the grand opulence and just falling short of the minimalistic elegance that some higher end restaurants have. Our waiter appeared to have woken from a pre-dinner service nap, stumbling over the obligatory menu overview and appearing quite confused when we asked about selections on the wine list.  We ended up getting the 9-course tasting menu and the caviar staircase - the staircase itself was beautiful, but I can honestly say that my palate does not appreciate fine caviar enough to justify the obscene amount of money we dropped on it. Later, we heard our waiter, who had apparently woken up and learned his script after taking our orders, tell another table of 5 that the staircase was meant to be shared by a larger group, and they had a half portion size that was not offered on the menu for half the price. Would that have been nice a tid-bit  for my dining companion and I?? Yes!!!  As for the tasting itself, there was not a single dish out of the nine that was memorable, and most were generally uninspired. My pork belly was hard as a rock, the veal was on the bland side, and as for a salmon and sorrel dish? Can't we be a little more inventive than that? Isn't a tasting menu supposed to showcase a chef's creativity and skills? The dishes where the chef did flex his creative muscles did not ""wow"" as expected - the suspended foie gras changed the texture of a creamy, decadent piece of meat to something resembling (and tasting of) canned tuna.

The wait staff dripped attitude, like answering my question about if a certain item is moist or dry in the middle with ""We have a professional staff in the kitchen. It's prepared properly."" Emphasis on the word ""properly."" But beyond the attitude the service was impeccable.  The décor is very appealing. Elegant is a good description. Tables are well spaced, so everyone has privacy. It's a contemporary, open setting, not unlike Four Seasons in New York. Part of the Lettuce Entertain You empire, they've thought of everything.

Their wine list is gigantic - I've never seen so many wines priced over $300 a bottle. Of course the one wine we picked they were out of, but the replacement wine was nice. And I appreciate the wine sommelier recommending a replacement that was less expensive than our original choice.  I had their crispy veal sweetbreads as a starter. This is the item I do not like dried out and overcooked, and the subject of the pompous answer from the waiter. ""moist"" was assured, but not delivered. They'd more appropriately be named veal McNuggets. Tasteless. Across the table my wife loved her bay scallops, the smallest bay scallops you've ever seen with small thin strips of bacon on top of each. She said they were perfect.  My main was the Atlantic halibut with braised fennel and olive. Fabulous, thick yet still cooked through, moist, and flavorful. My wife also liked her Wagyu beef short ribs, and went crazy for the small cups carved from apple with a jalapeno puree inside each apple cup. Bite size and delicious. I went with the cheese cart instead of dessert, a disastrous choice. I won't bore you with the story - if you enjoy a good cheese cart, don't be looking for it here.  We enjoyed the prix fixe menu, with seven appetizers and seven mains to pick from. Each was a generous serving.  The evening ended with a wonderful conversation with the general manager and a tour of the kitchen. It was a delightful evening, but I'll be surprised if we make another reservation here. Too many other good choices in Chicago.",0.9988,0.748,0.235,0.017,0.5712268234909744

I was impressed by the choice of black and white napkins (not even Alinea offers that choice) and even more pleased by the cashmere pashmina they brought me when they noticed I was chilly. I was less impressed by the amuse bouche that was several bites, the cheese offerings that overwhelmingly tasted of dirty diaper, and the assortment of summer melon dessert that tasted of cleaning products.

The impeccable service allows patrons to focus on the culinary experience without the slightest distraction. Our tasting menu included comté cheese gougère, cucumber salad on gelée, white sturgeon ""caviar"", suspended foie gras, the ""inside of an english pea soup"", dashi flan, duroc pork belly, scottish salmon with smoked cream, glazed veal, assortment of cheeses,  cucumber and vanilla, summer melons in ginger, and an assortment of desserts. The white sturgeon ""caviar"" is an outstanding concept and dish, best described and creamed smoked sturgeon condensed in small balls the size of salmon roe and served over a bed of creamed avocado puree. The suspended foie gras is a cryo-prepared foie grass mouse with all the flavor but without the overwhelming fatty texture. Just about every dish was well prepared and spectacularly presented. The salmon and the veal courses were a bit understated. The smoked cream on the salmon did make up for the lack of flavor and texture; the veal was rather flat however. Both appeared to have been prepared sous-vide but I have the feeling that the veal was not finished properly on the pan before serving. The cheese tray was heavy on soft-ripened double creamed cheeses. The wine list is, as expected, extensive, well documented, and well supported by the restaurant's sommelier. The restaurant offers valet parking on St. Claire, operating on both sides of the street (no need for u-turn in front of the restaurant).

2011-08-05,2.0,"It has taken me a full week to calm down about what a horrible experience I had at this restaurant to even consider writing a review.  Keep in mind, I have had the pleasure of eating at some of Chicago's greatest restaurants: Alinea, Trotters, Graham Elliot, NOMI, NaHa, Topolobampo, etc. etc.  I was expecting similar service and equally excellent food.  Imagine my surprise to find: 1) Forgettable courses:  Two of the meals in the multi-course tasting option we selected were forgettable at best.  I have had better pork belly in suburban, strip-mall eateries.  Tru's version was not cooked well, and tasted like it was covered with some Open Pit variety sauce.  The salmon was, meh, salmon.  It was cooked well, but it was something I feel that I might achieve on a good day in my amateur kitchen.  On top of this, the wait staff kept encouraging us to add luxury items to our meal -- for example, an Australian extra-class black winter truffle shaving for $50.00.  If the chef that I had been reading so much about wanted the meal to have truffle shaving on top of it, then I presume he would have put it there.  I do not need truffle for the sake of having truffle, nor to impress the overdressed couple at the table next to me.  I wish the restaurant would have given me what the chef put together and stopped the ""up sell"" mentality.  Tru should not operate under the same mindset as a Chili's, where diners can add shrimp to any fajita for an extra $5.00.   2) Amazingly condescending wait staff:  Perhaps if Tru had received a few more Michelin stars, it might have the right to treat customers the way we were treated during our meal.   B*tchy comment aside, here's a taste of what we encountered: one waiter tried to correct my grammar (I was correct, by the way); a different server congratulated me on using a ""big word"" correctly (the word was ""affinity"" and it is not a big word); the wait staff left us alone for 45 minutes at the end of our meal after we had requested the bill; and our server actually threw the Tru take-home ""goody bag"" at us as we were leaving.   3) Boring, dated ambiance and accommodations:  The website lauds the art in this space.  I found the pieces to be underwhelming given the restaurant's online comments.   4) Cold and potentially dangerous dining room:  Beyond the tiresome decor, the threshold between the waiting area/restrooms and the main dining hall is a slip-and-fall disaster waiting to happen.  The restaurant keeps a full-time staff member at this doorway to caution patrons about the slippery ramp on the floor.  Nonetheless, I am left wondering why this ramp exists in the first place:  cords/cables running under the ramp?  Uneven floorboards?  Who knows.  I think money would be better spent fixing the floor instead of hiring a staff member to plant at the doorway.  On top of this, the thermostat was set to cold when we first arrived, and consistently adjusted downward as the evening progressed.   I would be remiss if I did not mention some of the highlights of the evening/meal, which included an excellent recommendation from the sommelier, a fantastic lemon curd and chocolate confection, an especially interesting cheese course, a delicious and playful sturgeon ""caviar"" and avocado concoction, and a really nice glazed veal.  However, these bright spots cannot brighten the otherwise joyless experience I had at Tru.",0.9907,0.825,0.119,0.056,0.5015949328449328

We ended up wishing that we did not change our original plan. We are hardcore foodies and enophiles and I am a relatively accomplished gourmet cook. We frequent good restaurants in the Chicago area as well as yearly in Napa as well as other places when we travel    All in all the experience reminded me of the child's story ""The Emperor's New Clothes"".  Unfortunately people often conclude that something is automatically wonderful because it expensive or difficult to obtain. The bottom line at Tru was that no matter how innovative and exotic the menu items are described they are simply tiny bits of food that don't taste like much of anything. Pea soup with mint is pea soup regardless if it is spun as ""Inside of English Pea with Lavender"" and you are only served a few spoonfuls of it . One of our ""main courses"" was the Duroc Pork Belly with Stone Ground Grits and Pickled Green Onion.

The service was  wonderful and the servers were attentive and personable. The motif of the restaurant was somewhat dark and dreary and it was so quiet that it was actually a bit eerie The wine list was extensive and the markup for the bottles I was familiar with were 300 to 400% which is pretty steep even in a touted restaurant. One bottle of wine with dinner  two glasses of a different type to start and the suggested sweet wine with the foie gras and 2 Chefs Collection tasting menu with tip puts you out the door for  around $600.

2011-07-07,5.0,"This is one of the few restaurants I've been in where it took two servers working in sync to clear our plates after every single course. It doesn't matter, of course.  Doesn't make the food taste any better.  But it *does* point out a certain dedication to doing everything right.  And on our visit, Tru basically did everything exactly right.  That matters a lot. It was the first night of a week-long vacation in Chicago, our first reservation on our first visit to what has become a city of some very fine restaurants.  We were not expecting quite this much formality from a restaurant with just a single Michelin star.  In fact, I felt quite lucky to have checked the dress code before our arrival and dressed in a suit and tie.  It was, bar none, and quite unexpectedly, the most formal experience of our trip. I say it was formal, but it was hardly stuffy, not even pretentious, really.  The servers we ended up with were accommodating, took the time to answer our questions, and were truly friendly.  Formality in this case was treated not as an excuse to act all fancy, but as a set of codified methods of providing a comfortable, relaxing and intimate experience.  And that's how it *should* be. We had the Chef's Collection of nine courses, to which we added the Caviar Staircase ( my companion felt this was particularly necessary).  The Caviar Staircase plating still carries Rick Tramanto's engraved signature, despite his no longer being with the restaurant ... it was a good, though expensive survey of several different caviars, and cemented my belief that I cannot really tell the good stuff from the much less expensive and merely okay stuff. The dishes in the Chef's Collection were excellent in flavor and somewhat playful, using both modern and traditional methods in a balanced and purposeful way with a nice blend of European and Asian flavors.  A good survey, and pretty even in quality in that there were no failures and equally no dish which really stood out from the others.  The amount of food ended up being just right, which can be a difficult thing to do with so many courses. I have rarely had more perfect service, from making decisions about wine by the glass to the presentation of the cheese cart.  There were, of course, a few things that could have been done better, but the overall effect was very positive.  We arrived a few minutes early and were briefly seated in the waiting/lounge area and offered a drink before being seated basically on time.  We did note that during some particularly busy times of the evening, the pacing was slightly slower than we would have liked, and there was some amount of delay and confusion when we requested copies of the menu to take home that actually represented what we had ordered.  But these are very minor things.

2011-06-23,5.0,"I've been to Tru one time before my birthday dinner this year.  It was last year's birthday dinner, too, and the beginning of my exciting culinary exploration of the city of Chicago that I joyfully admit, now consumes much of my time, thoughts and stomach capacity.  It was there that I first discovered that Chicago wasn't messin' around; it is, in fact, pretty darn serious about its food scene.  And I have to admit, I was shocked. My first impression of Chicago's restaurants was not one of diversity, quality or excitement.  Initially, I noticed mostly the blatant cheesiness of ""Eggsperience,"" ""The Rainforest Cafe,"" and ""Weber Grill Restaurant"".  Thank God that was only on the surface!  It does take a little, but not too much, digging to discover a bounty of deliciousness:  from cheap eats to splurge worthy in categories ranging from authentic ethnic cuisines to burgers and pizza and everything in between. So, it all started here at Tru where fine dining is truly (no pun intended) realized. The space is elegant yet very modern, almost to the point of being a bit cold.  The massive walls are minimally decorated and the lack of music makes the room feel even more spacious and void. The service helps warm the air, if only a little, once it's understood that one's nose is not pointed toward the ceiling but rather directly into the plate.  But that's not to say that it becomes anything less than professional.  Oh, no!  The synchronicity never faltered, a mark never missed and explanations never less than thorough.  I'd go so far as to call it impeccable. Of course we chose the ""Chef's Collection Menu"" for a grand total of 13, yes 13, courses.  They call it 9 but then they sneak in a bunch of extras.  Fine by me.  Can anyone say ""hog heaven""?  Yes, that's were I was. Here's was 13 courses at Tru looked like on June 1st, 2011: It began with these tiny little bites:  Comte' cheese gougére.  You know you're in for a treat when a simple little savory puff is just so right.  Light, eggy, toasty, barely cheesy and salty.  How can something so simple to be so good? The Mussel Velouté was the second surprise amuse bouche.  This light, faintly mussel flavored soup had a cucumber gelée base and a lemony cucumber salad with tiny edible flowers.  Its gentile complexity was a nice wake up call for the palate. Our first official course was the White Sturgeon ""Caviar"" with a layer of creamy avocado and crispy hazelnut crackers.  Just know that I want to use explicit language to convey how good this is, but I can't.  I remember it as incredible from last year as well.  It's one of their signature items. What's interesting is that it's really not caviar at all.  It's the fish itself, smoked, then pureed, then submerged, drop by drop, into liquid nitrogen.  The result is creamy, soft little beads of heavenly flavor.  Spread on a house made cracker with a mother of pearl caviar spoon, it feels just as luxurious as the real thing.  Trust me. The next course was Suspended Foie Gras with pineapple, mango & balsamic dots, and pecan tuille.  After much debate and careful tasting, we decided that this wasn't our favorite dish.  The foie was lighter and almost spongy with a more delicate version of foie flavor and a faint, unidentifiable aftertaste.  It seemed as if foie gras's best qualities were taken away.  I mean, isn't it the dense, smooth, creaminess that melts in your mouth and the full, fatty flavor that makes this guilty pleasure so worth it?  It is for me.  This version was just about the antithesis of those things.  Meanwhile, the pineapple was sweet and too powerful, masking the diluted flavor of the liver.  The mango wasn't necessary since the over all flavor combo was already too sweet and the vinegar wasn't present enough to do anything about that.  The tuille was good on its own but didn't help the cohesiveness of the dish.  In all, kinda disappointing. But fear not!  There is still plenty of wonderful flavors to come including the ""inside of an English pea soup"" with lavender. At this point I had to ask our captain if there was a new chef in the kitchen.  I didn't remember there being this much molecular gastronomy in play last year.  Well, the answer was ""No"" but he had, in fact, acquired a new toy: liquid nitrogen. So the peas on this plate are not actually peas but pea puree manipulated to look like halved peas.  Hmmm...  And the flecks of silver are actually flecks of silver.  I've heard of eating gold leaf, but not silver.  Well, I guess you can because I'm alive and well to tell about it! The best part of the pea soup, however, was the tiny bits of smoky bacon that burst in your mouth with flavor.  That, and the very flavorful soup itself.  Go figure... the tastiest stuff was the actual food. Next up was the Dashi Flan with edamame, white sturgeon caviar (for real this time) and yuzu kosho.  Um, what?  I was a little .....",0.999,0.791,0.168,0.041,0.5204567736185384

Maybe due to the fact that we just had Daniel and Jean Georges in NYC, and Salts in Cambridge, Tru really was a bad finale for my graduation gastronomic trip.  The service was slow, probably because there were two large tables of corporate clients, but still... 5 courses for 3.5 hours? Alinea does 17 courses for 3.5 hours... Water glasses were left empty from time to time.  Out of the 5 course tasting menu, the worst thing was the pork belly. It was just a piece of fat meet, fried in Oliver oil...

However, once the meal started to unfold and we realized that all that glamour is really just unexpectedly grand treatment, we grew more comfortable and actually started to really enjoy the pampering :) We both ordered the 6-course grand collection, but I noted that I have some food allergies, so they adjusted accordingly. As a result, even though we were both supposed to get the exact same courses, we actually both got to try even more food because we had different food for practically every course! It was awesome! While I initially thought that each piece of food was rather small and dinky (exact thought in head: ""THAT'S IT?!"" *insert utter disappointment*), I actually felt full by the end of the meal. They must do a great job of balancing out the nutritional ingredients or something! The bread was great - I especially liked one that tasted exactly like a freshly made croissant. Their beer selection was excellent, as my bf loved what he ordered. I don't even like beer, but I enjoyed the sip that I had too! I asked them to customize a blackberry mint cooler, which was super yummy and to my surprise, concocted very well. My standout dishes were the beet salad with sour apple gelee, the butternut squash soup, the pork belly with grits and the apple beignets with vanilla bean ice cream were two of the standout courses. TI should note that their menu changes seasonally, so you may not be able to order everything that I got - but keep an open mind! The chefs definitely know what they're doing and again, will gladly adjust anything to your taste if you have any allergies. I think what really made the experience even more amazing was just the fact that they throw in quite a bit of ""complimentary"" items throughout the meal. Now I know they're not REALLY complimentary because this place is so pricey, but still...it gives the illusion that you're getting more than what you paid for, so in essence, it must be a bargain! First, they gave us some airy puffs, stuffed with cheese at the beginning of the meal. In the middle, they gave us some pear mixtures and cucumber dishes to cleanse our palettes. Following our dessert course, they gave us these special exploding truffles with melted vanilla ice cream inside! These were a great party in my mouth! Immediately thereafter, they brought around this cart with a bunch of homemade treats, compliments of the chef. We tried one of each treat and boy, were these good! They had mini lemongrass macaroons, which tasted just like fruit loops - only fancier! Besides the food, I'm still completely in awe of the service. Throughout the night, they always pulled out the table (since I was sitting on a side with a booth), just so I could get out. Their staff escorted me to the bathroom. When I walked past a group of servers, they immediately stepped to the side and fervently apologized! I have never experienced such polite service in my life! They also changed utensils and plates between every single course. The servers definitely coordinate very well with each other and read cues incredibly well because they were always on top of getting us whatever we needed (i.e. swifty cleaning up our food, bringing us a fresh warm napkin with a pair of tongs, following up with the next course, etc.. They even rushed to make sure they pulled out my bf's chair, which was just exceptional to me - they really care about tending to your every need!  I thought the night couldn't get any better, but as we were leaving, they gave us a printed out copy of our menu! This was such a romantic gesture and was such a beautiful way to cap off our trip to Chicago! They also gave us a parting gift, which were these homemade shortbread cookies with jam in them...yum! I can't say enough good things about this place. If you're looking for a great anniversary spot or just some great fine dining, check out TRU! Thanks to my amazing bf for taking me here - he spoils me :)",0.9996,0.766,0.221,0.013,0.5700793650793652

The food was just delicious - you get a lot of extras...the spoonful of soup, the candies at the end of the meal...

The atmosphere inside the dining room is fantastic, and the food gets as good as it get.

2011-05-02,4.0,"For Christmas, the boyfriend's mother gifted us with a certificate for free glasses of champagne, a tour of the kitchen, a tour of the art, and personalized commemorative menus to take home. We decided to save it for a special occasion, and so we went for my birthday last weekend. Fortunately, we got reservations when we called about 2 months ahead of time, but it was close, so plan ahead! When we arrived, we were taken on a tour of the kitchen. If you have the opportunity to do this, I recommend taking advantage. It was really neat to see how efficient this kitchen was. It's not at all like those cooking shows where everyone is yelling and chopping vegetables (and possibly fingers) with sharp knives in the intense heat. No, this was a zen kitchen. Very cool. We were then seated in the minimalist dining room. Extra points for having special stool things just for ladies' purses. We ordered the 9-course Chef's Collection tasting menu. You don't have to order the same menu as your dining companions, but we did. We also ordered a nice bottle of pinot noir to accompany our meal. In case you can't decide what you want from the giant encyclopedia of wine, they have a sommelier on hand to guide you. Because, why wouldn't they have a roving sommelier? Later in the evening, he helped us select glasses of wine for dessert, and my glass of chardonnay was the best chardonnay I've ever had. I won't go into detail about every single course because this review is already really long. My favorite courses were the white sturgeon ""caviar,"" the pork belly, and the veal ribeye. The appetizers were very creatively presented. The proteins were less fancy, but it didn't matter because they were delicious. Dessert was about 3 courses long, and they were all great. The food was good, but not overwhelmingly so. There were a couple of dishes that I didn't care for, namely the flan and the pea soup. The service was impeccable. Not a single detail went unattended. We went for my birthday, and every staff member wished me a happy birthday. My menu said ""Happy Birthday Molly"" on it, and I was even brought a little cake with ""Happy Birthday Molly"" written on the plate. It made me feel very welcome and appreciated. 5 stars for the service. It was pricey (around $600 with tip and tax), but I felt that everything was priced about right. I certainly didn't feel like our meal was a rip-off. Overall, I would say that Tru lived up to my expectations, but didn't exceed them. It was a nice introduction to molecular gastronomy, and I had a wonderful time.

We had the 9 course, wine pairing ultimate course. Everything is portioned like an aneroxic model eats her food but it was perfect since we had so many courses to look forward to.  Caviar with teeny tiny spoons? you are a God-send!  Each wine pairing was brought out by a personal sommelier and was explained to us the region, ingredients and such. I just love listening to someone talk about food in European accent. Please sir, do go on~  Each course was amazing and made me really appreciate food like I never did before.  Dessert was brought out in a rolling tray and we got to choose the ones we wanted. Of course, I only decided on 2 since I didn't want to seem like I'm at a Chinese buffet...  The best experience about this place was my date. I have to admit, we were giddy and giggling about how quiet and stuffy the place was however, the conversation and how he looked that night I will never forget. More so than the place itself.

That being said, I really wished that it had felt worth the price tag.  There are a few restaurants which can build up a price tag of $500+ for two, and it saddens me that I have to wonder whether one of those others would have been a better choice.  It is very quiet in the dining room, we were the youngest diners there, and I felt a little as if I was not allowed to talk during my meal.   Shhhh... There were a couple of dishes that were overly salted, or not enough.  With this kind of craft I think seasoning should not be an issue.  Also our venison was a little over, but that might be a preference as the bf and I like our meat to be on the south side of mid rare.  Also the foie gras presentation...  a torchon?  But it was a very long tube, kind of looked like toothpaste, quite salty, although creative, was it was a miss for me. There was a beautiful chawumushi (no idea how to spell that), and of course the caviar whitefish ""pearls"" or whatever you call them were great!  So light and the flavor was brilliant. The wine pairing was so complimentary I almost couldn't taste each selection against the plate it was sipped alongside.  Seriously, flavors so melding that I could not tell where the food ended and wine began.  Kind of cool actually, but perhaps the wines selected were a little on the light side for the dishes...sometimes I like my wine to butt heads with my food just a little, so that the pairing will bring out hidden flavors in each...The dessert wine was the exception of course.  There was a cool brown rice junmai sake that I liked a lot.  But only 1 red wine in the whole 9 courses!   They were very sweet to us and sent out a complimentary little cupcake, with ""Happy Anniversary"" on the plate.  Definitely not edible though, ha!

The food was good.  It was not spectacular, unbelievable or mind-blowing.  We did not have the 6 or 8 course menu since neither of us liked a couple items from each menu, so instead we ate from the fixed menu.  We enjoyed the butternut squash soup (fantastic!) and the bacon wrapped scallops for appetizers.  Then we moved to the braised short rib and curry lobster for our main course - both very good, but did not have a WOW factor to them.  We finished up with dessert - sorbet served in spoons and chocolate mousse.  The little side dishes in between courses were a nice touch, but the gelatinous meat side was forgettable at best. We enjoyed a wonderful bottle of wine with the help of the wine staff at the restaurant that really complimented our meal.  Again, the staff was great and friendly the entire evening.  When we left we were given pastries for  breakfast the next day and our car was waiting for us.  It was a great dining experience - if only the food was a touch more imaginative.",0.9951,0.77,0.204,0.026,0.6246666666666667

So while my boyfriend had the usual menu, they were able to accommodate my no meat, but okay with fish restriction. Every course was well presented and tasty. The pacific halibut course was a little over the top with it's sea conch and fishnet adornments. My favorite was when they wheeled over the cart of cow, goat, and sheep milk cheese. Fantastic!

2011-03-28,5.0,"*Drinks/Bar Considering that the attire is formal meaning men need jackets as a requisite for entry, the bar/waiting area isn't all stuck up and stuffy. Drinks were well made and quickly served. I started with a martini while waiting for our table then moved on to wine during dinner. The wine list is extensive and between the six bottles of wine we had as a party of eight, they were all on point. *Food I have to start by saying that my dreams (or we could say nightmares since I wake up knowing that I'm not able to satisfy my desire) are haunted by the caviar staircase. It's a journey towards heaven as you work your way up the staircase. Heaven does exist on Earth... in my mouth through this dish. Now with that said, I don't know that I would be able to reach these celestial heights again due to the price. Good thing I didn't pay for this dinner. Caviar is delicious but you cannot live on it alone and hungry equals not happy. The collection dinners are the way to go. The prix-fixe menu only offers three courses so you might as well splurge the little bit extra to get the full experience of a collection tasting menu. Courses are based off of season and availability so you know that you're getting fresh ingredients. Some of the tasting menu that I had included white sturgeon ""caviar"", beet salad, wagu beef raviolis topped with truffles, halibut served with carrot foam, and a four berry dessert. I would pay out of my own pocket for just dinner many times over.   *Service/Ambiance This is by far one of the best experiences in service I have ever received to date. It was amazing how there was always someone there for every whim that you thought of. Examples: chairs were pulled in and out, an escort to the restroom, napkin folded neatly on the table with plate cover over the next course upon my return from the restroom, four food runners for eight people so everyone is served simultaneously, and the executive chef greeted us at the end of dinner with signed menus of our collection. The ambiance is romantic and classy without being stuck up. It's very lively in a calm cozy sort of way. I'd say it's comparative to how a bee colony runs, humming along efficiently. You feel very taken care of and that everyone is there to serve your every need. *Overall A wonderful place to spend a special occasion or a special place to spend any occasion. It's not a restaurant for the light wallet hearted individual nor a place to show up in flip flops (which was sad because I do love a good pair of flip flops like a good California girl should). Try this place if you can spare the change and if you do then definitely go for the full nine course meal.  Rating: 5",0.9974,0.781,0.181,0.038,0.5692612942612945

Granted, it is way too expensive a place to frequent, at least for us, but if you can stand facing the check at the end of the night, it is quite an experience. We went on our anniversary and they printed our names on the menu, which was kind of cool. It's such an easy thing to do and makes the clientele feel special - very clever. We had cocktails to start and mine was a martini involving Hendrick's gin and saki and it was delicious and beautifully presented. When they brought the napkins, there was a choice of white or black, so you wouldn't get contrasting lint on your clothes, which was unnecessary for us, but a nice touch that just reminds you what a classy place you are in and is also perhaps another attempt to justify the price. I suppose it doesn't hurt. The food was amazing and my wagyu beef short rib was maybe the best piece of meat I have ever eaten in my entire life. So often, it is disappointing, after all the fuss and high prices and the food is good, even very good, but not great. The short rib there is great. I had to take off a star, though, after the waiter hesitated to bring me a Grand Marnier instead of whatever the cake or tort was that was included in our prix fixe menu. He actually said it might be a dollar or two difference in price. Here, we are spending that kind of money and he is going to be a stickler for $2. That was weak, especially after they go to the trouble to see to all the other little details and everything. They also wrote a personalized ""Happy Anniversary"" message on the glass plate the dessert was served on, which was a nice touch.

I am pleased to say that the service was perfect- very attentive but in no way cloying.  5 stars here. I loved the French wine selection- particularly from the Rhone and Languedoc.  Kudos to Tru for having lesser known boutique bottles as well as the traditional greats.  They also have a full range of prices and I saw bottles from 60 dollars that I was really excited about.  5 stars here too. The food was very good but a little uneven.  Presentation was always gorgeous.  Duck confit and foie gras appetizer was great but curried lobster main was just good.

2011-02-23,4.0,"So, I had been wanting to come here since before I moved to Chicago (as a child, I watched Gale Gand on Food Network a bit too much) To my utter surprise and pleasure, BF took me here for Valentines Day!  When we walked in, I said ""I didn't even know that you knew that Tru was a thing!""  To which he replied ""I didn't!""  Yay for happy coincidences. We chose the 9 course tasting, which I believe is worth the price when considering other options.  I've heard people leave after the 3 or 6 course menus a bit hungry still.  We were NOT hungry in the LEAST after the 9 courses (plus lots of tiny things in between). The food was solid, for sure.  I think I've probably had slightly better elements here and there, but this was definitely worth it for the experience and the decadence.  One of our dishes came with gold-freakin-leaf as a garnish... The service... here... I'm torn.  I appreciate an attentive wait-staff, and the synchronized serving, etc was fun the first couple of times, but it ended up feeling a little contrived and awkward.  Also, I felt like every time I tried to rest my elbows on the table between courses, someone came by to scrape crumbs off the table (invisible crumbs, I suppose, I never saw any).  Also, after BF spilled something on the table cloth, they spread a napkin over the soiled portion of table cloth, which was kind of weird. I have to say I would have enjoyed my evening much more had the service been dialed back a notch.  I hope that management reads their reviews, although they probably don't considering it's Tru. What I will remember the most about this meal was the exploding chocolates at the end.  Literally a crisp chocolate shell encasing a flavor-du-jour liquid.  Thankfully the waitress counseled us that ""exploding"" wasn't an exaggeration and they should be eaten in one bite.  Our flavor was passion fruit, and although I was feeling extremely full to the point of being uncomfortable, I could have eaten like 100 more of those passion fruit exploding chocolates.  So refreshing and delicious.  Personally, I think they made passion-fruit ice cubes, then dipped in tempered chocolate, and let the ice slowly melt in the fridge.  That's how I would do it, anyway. Also, the financiers they sent us home with were quite delicious, although in my time living in Paris, I never saw a financier bigger than a small bite-size, these mamas were like baseballs.  Tasty though. Will we be back?  Not sure.  Was it an excellent experience worth every one of BF's pennies?  You betcher.",0.9966,0.799,0.169,0.032,0.5757507507507508

2011-02-20,5.0,"After almost 5 years and a lot of other (newly minted) Michelin star winners, I finally made it back to Tru to see if the restaurant I always thought was the best...was the best. And I was not disappointed.  I visited with three other friends who hadn't been previously, and we tried valiantly to behave ourselves in the world of adults. To address a few comments, Tru might be a bit stuffy, but I don't think it's over the top. We had a pleasantly playful waiter that cracked a few jokes, and used a napkin to dramatically cover the small spill we were joking about. Nice touch.  I'll let other diners review what they ordered, but mine was, once again, fantastic. My appetizer, a seared foie gras and duck confit, was superb. Rich, silky foie gras, along with the dense, salty confit was a great match, mixed with caramelized pears and a sort of pureed cauliflower/pear mixture. The puree especially was outstanding with the foie gras, cutting through the salt in both meats and adding a sweet flavor with all the savory. Thank goodness Chicago allows foie gras to be served again - Tru's is outstanding and was prominently featured on several of the items.  My entree was wagyu beef shortrib - the server said braised for almost 72 hours (holy cow) and covered with the broth reduction, along side pureed potato/apple/jalapeno and little balls of green apple, hollowed and sprinkled with a basil flavored olive oil. The meat was...let's just say tender. Bringing my knife nearby caused it to automatically cut itself. Incredibly delicious, but maybe a little on the salty side. The puree, again, was a perfect counterpoint to counter some of the salt, with a tiny bit of heat from the jalapeno as the perfect touch. Even the little apple/basil deals provided a surprising treat, with the sour apple and savory basil a unique combination.  And finally, my desert was a very good vanilla risotto with apricot and fig, creme anglaise, and a little scoop of clove ice cream. The risotto was just the right texture - every bit as good as the world class lobster risotto I enjoyed on my first visit, and just this side of warm. Unfortunately, that melted the wonderful clove ice cream and with the addition of the creme anglaise, the mixture got a little runny, Flavor was outstanding - I can't resist risotto.  In between all of this were chocolates, candies, pear emulsion with spiced berry sauce, a beef gelee and pureed cauliflower amouse bouche, their spectacular cheese course, wonderful house made breads and crackers, plus truly excellent coffee. Service was superb - attentive without being smothering, with a very helpful sommelier and friendly wait staff. Although, their synchronized service theatrics were not in as full effect this time - one lady and three gentlemen probably threw off their system. And the ""purse chair"" for the lady's pocketbook didn't arrive until a little bit in to the meal (which the waiter apologized for - BUT IT IS TOO LATE FOR EXCUSES ONE STAR). I will say that I ordered appetizer and entree that were similar - salty, savory meats, with a semi-sweet puree accompaniment. I enjoyed both very much, but if I had been cautioned as to their similarity, I might have changed my order slightly.  Frankly, when I have to nitpick a restaurant because their service isn't like a synchronized swimming routine, and because someone didn't have a pedestal for their handbag...then the rest of the experience was pretty fantastic. It's still a lot of money, but when I look at what it has cost to eat at other places like Alinea and Trotter's, and consider how much more I have enjoyed the food and the general experience at Tru, I know where I'd go again.",0.9995,0.743,0.239,0.018,0.6204966160599963
2011-02-20,3.0,"Technically there was nothing flawed about our experience - there was just nothing exceptional about it either. The service was excellent.  But the rigidness of our meals coupled with the unoriginal banality of our food left me contemplating the let down in value moreso than anything.  I found the atmosphere to be stiff and pretentious rather than elegant and inspired.  The requirement for us to elect the same tasting menu made our dining monotonous.  I recollect most courses being predictable and 2 dimensional.  For instance, my peeky-toe crab salad tasted of black pepper, watery shell fish, and mayonnaise.  My most delectable food - a caviar flight and a bottle of Flowers - was prepackaged and required supplements.  In my opinion Tru caters well to traditional-styled executives with parochial tastes.  For the same cost, I would much rather opt for 2 meals at most other Chicago 1-star Michelin restaurants or a meal at a more highly rated venue.",0.9545,0.873,0.118,0.008,0.4721464646464646

2011-02-13,4.0,"""This is where really wealthy people go when they want to have a nice night out."" --Joe, my husband, commenting on the over-the-top, upscale atmosphere of Tru. Bottom line: The food is amazing and worth the price; the service is fantastic; the drinks are far too expensive. We arrived a little early and were seated in the ""lounge"" while they set up our table. The waiter handed us a drink menu, and this was when we experienced serious sticker shock! A bottle of beer was $14. It was good beer (Three Floyd's Pride & Joy), and we're not opposed to paying for alcohol, but as my husband put it, ""this was just offensive."" It was unfortunate that this happened immediately, because it set a tone for the next half hour. It was at this point that my husband made the above comment. We sat at the table and the wait staff handed us our menus. The three-course option was reasonably priced, and included an amuse bouche, substantial bread choices, course 1, course 2, pallet cleanser, course 3 (dessert) and chocolates. Except for the pallet cleanser (which tasted like what I assume a lime-scented candle may taste like), the food was phenomenal. My husband and I shared all of our courses, so we were actually able to taste 2 appetizers (scallops and foie gras), 2 mains (lobster and wagyu spare ribs) and 2 desserts.  One disappointment about the menu was there wasn't a wine-pairing option. That, I believe, would be a nice way to offer smaller amounts of good wine, paired by a sommelier (now that I think about it, I never saw a sommelier the entire night) at an affordable price. (Topolobampo has this option with its 5-course tasting menu, and we don't hesitate to do it every time we're there.) As for the service, our waiter really couldn't have been better. I believe he recognized when we sat down that we were feeling a little out of our element, and adjusted his behavior to be more relaxed to make us comfortable. It worked, and we began to relax almost right away. When my husband joked with him, he laughed and joked back. I was as impressed with his (and the others') service as I was with the food. The people are true (Tru) professionals. We had wanted to go to Tru for many years now, and I'm glad we did. I recommend it for the experience alone. However, one of our favorite things about going out for a nice dinner is enjoying cocktails and wine, and it was just way too expensive at Tru for us to do that. I found myself sticking to the one $11 glass of wine they had on the menu--regardless of what I was eating. So, unless the price of drinks comes down, we won't be going back. Which is sad, because I'll be thinking about that foie gras, those spare ribs, the sauce on the lobster and that chocolate cake for years to come.",0.996,0.803,0.159,0.039,0.5901483781918564

Our table of 20 somethings were surrounded by older customers, who were in their 50s or 60s, dressed in business attire. I felt a tiny bit intimidated. The service was very formal, I thought. A little pretentious if you ask me, with all the synchronized serving by our two servers or the way they spoke to us. I felt like a commoner trapped in the body of Louis VI. The tasting menu was excellent and lavish but not a whole lot of surprises. I was not getting a taste of Tramanto/Gale Gand's creations like I expected.

To celebrate the big 4-0, my favorite foodie friend said I could pick any restaurant in the city and he would take me. ""Anywhere?"" I asked in my best Marilyn Monroe voice. ""Anywhere,"" he reassured me. Tru had been on my hit list since he took me to a Hart Davis Hart wine auction last year and now it was my opportunity to dine there. Hoo. Ray. All I can say is I NOW know what it feels like to be a princess. From the moment we arrived and I was handed a menu that read ""Happy BIrthday Kara"",  I knew it was going to be a fabulous night.  Service was beyond impeccable, as a team of well-dressed and unnervingly polite servers attended to our  every need. When my friend spilled a glass of champagne on his pants, I hadn't finished gasping before one of the uber-attentive garcons appeared with a cloth napkin and club soda! I also honestly believe the waitstaff has to rehearse for hours on a daily basis to perfect their patented water-pouring technique. I wish I brought my video camera. For dinner, we both went with the three course prix fixe. For an appetizer I had the scallops and polenta (and we all know polenta is just a fancy word for grits, right?) and for my main course I had the lobster, of course, and wanted to just die from acute foodbliss. My friend chose the carpaccio appetizer and the wagyu beef short rib entree and I, of course, sampled the goods. ALL THAT! For our liquid pleasure, the sommelier recommended a lovely bottle of chamPONya, which had me nice and giddy before I was presented with my birthday present--a bottle of 2002 Petrus! At that point, I wanted to jump up on the table and do that Russian dance where they fold their arms, drop down, pop back up and kick out their legs repeatedly. Well, maybe I actually did do that but I'm just pretending like I only wanted to. I might add that the Petrus is not on the menu but came from my friend's personal collection (for those of you who may be looking for it next time you dine there). I calmed down just in time for dessert-- a delightful selection of cheeses and I had my own personal sinfully delicious chocolate lava cake!  My only complaint is-- and I guess it really isn't a complaint, more a matter of personal taste--is that it was too darned bright in there and the decor was kind of  bland.

2011-01-03,5.0,"Tru was one of my favorite tasting menus of the year. I was sad to hear Rick Tramonto has left the restaurant and I can only hope his successor can live up to his reputation. However, with today's celebrity chef B.S., who knows how involved he was in the kitchen by the time I ate there anyway. Chef Tramonto may have already been too wrapped up with his other restaurants in the northwest suburbs and I'm giving him more credit than I should. I went to Tru with a large group and was pleasantly surprised that they let 1/2 the table order the Chef's tasting menu and the other 1/2 order the 3 course ""regular"" menu. This is a pretty uncommon practice in fine dining because it disrupts the timing of the meal, but Tru gets points for allowing it to happen since not everyone at a table wants to drop $300+ on a tasting menu. What surprised me even further was that those members at the table that did not get the chef's tasting menu received a couple of ""freebie"" courses with those of us that did do the tasting just to keep things flowing smoothly. Completely unheard of in any fine dining establishment I've ever been in. Kudos to our server for putting that together! The dining room was great at Tru, from the large open space, to the artwork on the walls (sure it's a little dated, but Tru has been around for quite a long time and it still looks great). Lighting is a LITTLE too bright for my tastes, but that's because of all the white in the room. Service is where Tru excels. As a table of 10 with 5 people doing the chef's tasting and 5 people doing the 3 course meal, each course came out exactly on time and plates were presented all at once in the perfectly timed manner that could only be described as ""a well oiled machine"". The servers are like a little military operation trained to be perfectly synchronized together. It's quite fun to watch. Each course was presented impeccably and explained from ingredients to preparation in detail. At the end of the meal after two pastry courses, the server brings  a small cart to the table with mignardises for you to pick a few from and he didn't even bat an eye when my dessert whore ass asked for one of each of the 12 plus varieties! I'm sure I'm only 1 of 4 patrons that asks for each kind every month and there was no judgment that came with the request. Now for the food. I have no idea where the people on yelp who rate this restaurant as a 1 have been eating, but I'd like to know where your 5's are because I personally have only had a handful of tasting menus better than the one I had at Tru. The tasting was perfectly balanced in a well orchestrated progression that ended with some of the best pastries I've ever had. I wish I were independantly wealthy so that I could have added the cavier staircase, the foie gras, the wagyu beef, and/or the white truffle shavings to my tasting, but alas, I am but a simple man without a trust fund. Each course was plated perfectly on dinner ware that was a little outdated, but I didn't mind that at all. There's nothing here that compares to Alinea or Moto as far as mind blowing molecular gastronomy type courses, but the food is very modern french preparation and it's all perfectly seasoned and tastes great. One of the stand out things for me was the cheese course. The server brings a cart to the table and you can choose as many or as few cheeses as you would like to sample before pastry is served. It's a wonderful treat for anyone who appreciates good cheese in the place of pastry without having to forgo the pastry. I've been in my fair share of restaurants that force you to choose between cheese and pastry or cheese is a supplemental charge. After the cheese, there is a palette cleanser and then some of the best pastries I've ever been served. Gale Gand is a master among her peers. Only pastries at Le Bernardine, WD-50, Graham Elliott and Alinea rank better than hers that I've ever had. I LOVE dessert and to be ranked in my top 5 is a big deal to me. Tru has a dessert only tasting that you can call and ask for and I couldn't recommend it more. It's very affordable and the perfect treat after a meal in the downtown Chicago area if you don't want to spend $300+ for the entire Tru experience. As I mentioned before, the meal ends perfectly with the mignardises service. Tiny bite sized treats that are perfectly decadent  and flavorful to end a perfect meal, a sure 5 out of 5 rating. Are there cheaper tasting menus to be had n the city of Chicago? Sure, but there's also some that are much more expensive as well. For all the people that have rated Tru poorly for value, you probably didn't have the money to spend on the meal in the first place. I've eaten over 100 tasting menus at restaurants all over the world, Tru isn't over priced for what you receive.

We loved though that while the servers were incredibly attentive, they were also not pretentious, and were able to joke around with us too.  I admit I was a little nervous as many reviews have indicated that the food didn't live up to expectations....but we found that was not the case for us...the food was amazing!!! We just did the prixe-fixe menu and we all loved it! Words like...mouthwatering, so tender, you have to try this....were uttered continuously.  The presentation of the food was of course exquisite, but the taste was also!  This is a fine-dining experience, so of course the portions are smaller-sized....but iall four of us were absolutely stuffed at the end of our meal - to the point 2 of us couldn't even eat the little chocolates provided at the end.  The sommelier was perfect in his recommendations - we left the decision-making to him, within a price range, and he absolutely delivered - the wine choices fit our food and our palates and our budgets.   Overall, a truly magnificent experience!",0.9846,0.834,0.159,0.007,0.6807823129251702
2010-12-18,4.0,"At the end of May, I was heading out to Chicago for a business trip.  Of course, my first intention was to nab a ressie at Alinea, but to no avail!  What to do? I was meeting up with a good friend, who was also inviting a few guests. So, I wanted some place that would wow me, some place celebratory and memorable! Next on my checklist, was Tru. In addition to Alinea and Frontera, this was a restaurant I've been wanting to try when, and if I was ever in the Chicago area.   It was around 8pm Friday night, and my friend arrived at the same time with his guest and her friend.  Just a little FYI, this restaurant was very well hidden. I had to circle the area a few times before i finally found it.    Upon stepping into the restaurant, we were kindly greeted by the staff and escorted into the waiting area, where we had a few glasses of wine. Gentlemen, unfortunately, this is another one of those 'jacket required' establishments, so be prepared! After about 15 minutes, we were taken to our seats. The dining room was very large and spacious.   The atmosphere, although simple and modern, was quite refined and stately. Hanging artwork and sculpture could be seen displayed throughout the restaurant, as well, which gave it an almost ""contemporary gallery"" type feel.  As we glanced through our menus, we all agreed to go with the prix fixe menu with choices of entrees, and i must say, the presentation was spectacular. Each plate that came out was literally like artwork! The plating was both delicate and delectable. With that said, the service was also flawless! The staff handled our table from start to finish with the utmost perfection. In fact,we marveled over the virtually effortless changing of plates and utensils between each individual course.  These people were very well trained and skilled in their craft. As soon as our table cloth became slightly soiled, a clean napkin cloth was conveniently placed over the soiled spot. The ladies were escorted to the restroom and seats were pulled out as soon as they returned. As we left, we were cordially given a fond farewell by the staff and given charming little financiers for our trip home. Nice touch! Overall, service was definitely 5 star! I can't say i've had better service anywhere else! Unfortunately, I'd have to say food was more like 3-4.  The food was executed beautifully, but for me, with the exception of the deliciously smooth and flavorful beef tartare, there wasn't anything particularly memorable that made the meal spectacular. I would say, if you're searching for a quiet romantic setting that will wow your date with service and ambiance, then this is your place.  But, if you're looking for a mind-blowing meal, this may not necessarily fit the bill.

2010-12-08,5.0,"I still (after many years) can remember the taste of the octopus here, so I figured I should review it as I'm sure the quality and food have not changed.  I think this is one of my very top meals in the city.  I had the larger tasting menu when I visited Tru - it was phenomenal. The caviar staircase was so good, I could have eaten 10 of them as my meal instead (or, so I thought before I saw the other courses as they get better throughout the meal). The octopus was so fantastic - I wish I could get it again. It was so thin, it looked like a design on the plate. This dish seemed to have only been seasoned with salt and pepper and it was  so.so .good! I hope it's still on the menu!  Everything was delicious. We didn't do a full wine pairing, but had the wine director choose appropriate wines as necessary. I liked that we were not pushed to have the most expensive options, but were given true recommendations based upon the food. All of the picks were great.  The dessert was out of this world. I have to say, I think Gale Gand is super (I have a cook book of hers) and I've enjoyed both making items from the cookbook and eating her creations at Tru. I especially liked the little take home pastry things (sorry, I don't recall their official name!).  Service, as one would expect from this type of restaurant, was perfect. I didn't find it stuffy, but actually quite friendly and warm.  The space is beautiful and it's really an enjoyable spot to sit and take in the event that is dinner here.  Due to the price, I would consider this a special occasion spot, but it's well worth it.

Next, was some kind of foam or reduction, not really sure what the hell that is, but it was unique.

2010-12-03,1.0,"Single worst tasting menu experience I have EVER had.... And I have been around the culinary block. From Daniel to French Laundry to Per Se- WD50 to Eleven Madison Park to all of the Momofuku restaurants... I have been a silent observer on Yelp till now. I cannot let anyone make the same mistake we have.  First, let me say the service was fine, albeit canned at best. Completely generic fine dining, no bit of personality present whatsoever. But again, fine. Then it got ugly. So help me God if I ever see another piece of gold leaf on a plate again I will stab the nearest victim in the eye with whatever semi sharp implement I may have within arm's reach. I felt as though I was in podunkville Arkansas (no offense Arkansas) circa 1988. All that was missing was a few mullets and some bad shoulderpads. Seriously, if Don Johnson walked out with my food I can't say i would have been surprised. So the plating was horrific. One dish actually had a blown glass conch type shell housing the scallop dish.. I mean it's not even the same mollusk, people, what do you take me for?! Gold leaf, luster dust, and contrived table side service abounded. Is this the caliber of haute cuisine Chicagoans accept? I truly hope not. THE FOOD Well, note to any Michelin rated, Relais & Chateau establishment - if you can't make a freaking brioche ( our neighbor called it a pretzel and wasn't joking) or petit chapeau there are PLENTY of places you can purchase from. Just don't bother because Au Bon Pain can do a more acceptable job. First course was 'faux caviar' - oh hi Thomas Keller circa 1997 didn't see you there... Tapioca'd pearls of white sturgeon served in a kitchy branded caviar tin over (brown) avocado bs. Been done, thousands of times, better. The caviar was overly salty and the avocado was nothing of any remembrance that you haven't tasted at your local taquieria. On no planet should the mediocre wine have been served with the dish.   Next was a celeriac soup. The time warp continued with undercooked potato, tasteless truffle chip, overcooked quail egg and crispy something stupid. Tableside pouring of flavorless soup lacking any personality or consistency whatsoever. Now I'm getting feisty. Again a pooooooor wine pairing, completely unmemorable and young. Did I mentioned the plate was covered in a vomitous smattering of gold leaf? Who even does that any more?! Well hello there David Hasselhoff, is Knight Rider waiting outside for you? I couldn't tell based on our asinine third course. Presentation was cute but dated, 'flavors of fall' - a bunch of crap served in a small pumpkin with some pinecones (AND  LUSTERDUST) on a piece of slate. Medjool dates, chestnuts, pears and pumpkin in a curry broth so lacking in flavor it was nearly impossible to differentiate one bite from the next. Now I'm pissed. Wine = gruner - fine but uncharacteristic and poorly paired. Next up... Cod. Yes cod. How on earth could a high end restaurant screw cod up, you say? Oh, well they did... My portion was grossly overcooked on the edges and well cooked in the middle, but completely flavorless on one side and so damned salty on the other it was nearly inedible. My partner's was so completely overcooked he barely touched it and when asked he politely lied and said he was saving room. It was served with a mussel veloute (hi there 1994) which was just embarrassing.The chosen wine this time was red, Pinot noir in style, once again too young but tasty. Perhaps good in theory with the dish - if it had been properly seasoned, prepared, or any combination... Venison. My most favorite game there is. Ever. And they destroyed it. Unseasoned, flavorless, served on some horrendous brussels sprouts (blame them for why people treat them as the redheaded stepchild of veggies) and some haphazard red currants (yes it's December, seasonal people?!) nonexistent alleged broth. Gag. Wine= mediocre which at this point was a happy surprise.  Dessert- if you can't make a culinary school pate a fruits - DON'T. For christ's sake it's a rookie thing to overdevelop the gelatin, I'll go to cvs and get some jujubees, thanks. Apple beignets - great beignets, apple tasted like water - how hard would it have been to cook it in ANYTHING?! Vanilla ice cream - once I got past the ice crystals it was bland and your local grocery store has more interesting vanilla.  Lettuce Entertain You - is this what you do to an alleged fine dining experience? Or is Tru just coasting on false reputation? Do yourself a favor and don't waste $500+ on dinner for two, or if you do I have a pretty fancy bridge to sell you...",0.9829,0.812,0.111,0.077,0.41880226480836247

We did the Grand Collection and added the seared Foie Gras from the a la carte menu.  We also swapped one of the beignet desserts for the fall fruit risotto I had seen on the menu online during my ""research period.""  Funny enough, that addition and substitution were probably the best things we had.  You definitely want the risotto--it's a whole deal where they assemble it tableside and it's the perfect balance of sweetness for a dessert.  There were lots of extras thrown in before, during, and after our meal that were pretty cool also, and we were DEFINITELY full by the end of it.   So, if you've never experienced the caliber of the wait staff at TRU, it's definitely worth it for a special occasion.  But, we likely now can cross it off our list and will explore elsewhere on our next visit.

The service was quite nice and the pacing was perfect.  The only thing I might mention as being not quite what I expected was when I asked the guy with the cheese cart about a lapel pin he was wearing, I expected something along the lines of a two sentence answer, but got about a five minute description on how certification for sommeliers works.  It was interesting, but I really just wanted the two sentence answer and to go back to eating my cheeses. Food-wise, I enjoyed all the dishes.  They bought out a little Comte cheese gougene, which was nice but not too exciting. This was followed by a fennel panna cotta with bonito, which I really liked a lot.  Next was white sturgeon ""caviar,"" avocado puree and hazelnut.  I'd recently gotten tools to do food ""spherification,"" so it was cool to see a good restaurant to it for comparison to my own efforts.  The linear foie gras with blackberry ice wine vinegar and caramelized popcorn wasn't really to my taste.  I feel like vinegar is a little too pungent to really be appropriate for foie gras, but it was an interesting experiment nonetheless.  An heirloom tomato ""salad"" with white tomato mousse followed.  I put salad in quotes because it was really more like a soup or almost even a granita it was so chilled.  I love gazpacho, though, so I loved this dish.  Next, the braised Duroc pork belly with illuminated vegetables was delicious.  The fresh farm ricotta and corn agnolotti with summer truffle consomme had a lot of flavor and was quite luxurious.  As a fish course, the Alaskan halibut with gingered young carrot was one of the most perfectly cooked pieces of fish I've ever had.  It was so spot on.  The ""main course,"" if there can be such a thing among so many courses, was a glazed veal ribeye with spring garlic, asparagus, and wild mushroom. It was quite nice, with really great umami flavors.  They offered a nice selection of cow, goat and sheep's milk cheeses, followed by a strawberry consomme with rhubarb foam.  My dish only had the rhubarb foam, but it was still nice.  The final actual course was a Grand Marnier poached peach with honey and vanilla ice cream.  This was expertly prepared, if bordering on boring because everything was just kind of soft, sweet goodness.  Finally, they offer an array of mignardises as a final bit of sweetness. I would go back to Tru.  It does require a jacket, however it doesn't come across as overly stuffy or pretentious.  The food is expertly executed and I think any dislike I had with food items simply boiled down to my personal taste and not any misstep on the part of the chefs.  The evening overall went really well from the moment we stepped inside, to the moment they handed us a little cornbread/jam muffin for the next morning as we left.",0.9989,0.786,0.197,0.016,0.5128760957119166

2010-09-03,5.0,"My boyfriend took me to Tru for my birthday this year. Knowing this a day in advance, I looked at the menu and Yelped it (of course!) and was a little disappointed at the reviews, which mentioned that, while the experience was good, the food was pretty non-spectacular. Also, the collection didn't seem so inventive, and for $110 I thought that they should have given more than 6 courses (I know, I've been to Alinea and so my standards are ridiculously high) or at least 6 really really cool sounding courses. I had just made an heirloom tomato salad (from the Momofuku cookbook) earlier in the week as well so the idea that an heirloom tomato salad would be one of the 6 courses didn't sit too well. However, I didn't want to second guess his choice (turns out he saved my Yelp password when I logged into his computer and he browsed through my bookmarks to pick a place.. genius, right?!) so I figured I could just go for a prix fixe and pick stuff I knew I would like even if I was limited to 3 courses (which in my opinion is not as good as a tasting menu because a few bites is all you need to really love a dish, so why waste all the stomach space for one type of taste?).  ANYWAY, so we went to Tru, which really did impress right when I walked in. It seemed like a boardroom meeting type of room, and the glass place settings we had in front of us looked really cool. They handed us our menus, and I saw the the one I got was more or less what I had seen on the website. My boyfriend, on the other hand, is a vegetarian, so his collection menu was a Vegetable Collection with.. 9 courses! They sounded super creative and interesting. Looking back and forth between our menus, the answer was clear--we were both getting the Vegetarian Collection. OMG, such a good decision! The dishes were well thought out and delicious (my point of comparison is Green Zebra.. Tru totally tops Green Zebra!). They gave us 3 extra dessert courses.. Mmmm. I was SO happy with their hospitality. They also gave me a copy of the menu so I will list for you here what I had: Comte Cheese Gougere - puff pastry with cheese (amuse bouche) Fennel panna cotta, bonito - I'm a sucker for savory custard.. win! Cilantro ""caviar"", avocado - VERY creative and yummy! Red ace, candystripe, + golden beet collage, apple, microgreens - looked nothing like anything I'd ever seen, very futuristic.. but good! Yellow corn soup, olive oil, brioche - really good corn soup, although a little salty. We sipped it out of a teacup which was a really fun way to eat soup. Glazed artichoke, parsley, parmesan - good because I like artichoke, but nothing spectacular about the flavor La ratte potato gnocchi, vegetable glaze, carrot - yum! carrot three ways, sesame, ginger - here, the carrot was presented whole, pureed, and in a foam form. everything tasted pretty good except for the foam, which tasted like soap. weird. green asparagus and morel mushroom feuillette - i actually made something similar for my boyfriend for valentine's day a few years ago, so I appreciated the combination of asparagus, puff pastry, and cream. My first time having morels--approve! A little too much asparagus for me to finish, but I think this course was supposed to be the ""main course"" of the collection. Overall, yummy. Strawberry consomme, rhubarb foam - very light amuse bouche. Good palate cleanser, especially if you don't have stomach room (we didn't) since it was mostly air. I liked the combo of rhubarb and strawberry in air form. =] Granny smith apple, red + white port, apple sorbet - yum! The apple sorbet was very refreshing and the combination of puff pastry and port-compressed apples was a total hit. They also gave us a few other desserts, just because. One was a chocolate custard covered with menthol whipped cream and crunchy little chocolate balls -- I love chocolate and mint so it was really good. They also gave us tiny root beer floats with house-made root beer -- super cute and also good. Lastly, we got some blueberry exploding chocolate truffles, which were reminiscent of the exploding melon ball at Alinea -- very cool. Overall, had an AMAZING time despite my initial hesitation. My advice is to skip the prix fixe and regular collection if you want to try some new and interesting cuisine (I mean, ribeye and lobster taste the same everywhere, don't they? How many times have you had golden beets in a gelatinous form with horseradish cream?) that happens to not have meat in it. Anyway, I'm obviously biased, but if you like MG, you should definitely try the road less traveled here. I had a GREAT birthday. =]",0.9994,0.791,0.191,0.018,0.49195206308842687

The dining room, although mostly full, was silent and remained so for most of the evening. The atmosphere was very uptight. That said, the waiter and the rest of the staff was attentive and helpful throughout the meal. My partner had the lobster; it was a little tough and bland. I had the jidori slow cooked chicken and it wasn't just bland, it was bad. The chicken was rubbery and had no flavor. Since the menu lacked anything interesting or risk-taking, I assumed it would be the basics cooked to perfection. Unfortunately, it was not. There wasn't anything about Tru that lived up to its hype.

Food:  The subtlety of the flavors was wonderful.  We went with a tasting, which started with an octopus carpaccio.  Understandably, for my Midwestern wife, this was a bit unusual.  But she ate and enjoyed it.  The caviar staircase offered some very tasty experiences.  And the food overall was just top notch - as were the desert options from the desert cart they bring around. Their presentation was dramatic yet elegant and simple.  I think you can see that from  the pictures that have been uploaded here.  We were very impressed with the colors used in each dish. Service: Probably the thing that stands out even more than the food was the service.  We were treated like royalty... even to the point of it being a little disconcerting.  We had brought a camera... and they had a special pillow for cameras.  When my wife told me she had to use the restroom and she had looked up and put her napkin down, the waiter was right there and pulled the table out for her and told her where to go.  (Creepy?  Maybe.  But amazingly attentive).   Ambiance: The dining environment wad unexpectedly bright.  Coming into the entrance, it was dark and dim.  But once into the dining area, the room was bright, with lots of glass or crystal.  It felt clean and light.  Perhaps that is part of the experience... stepping into a bright area after entering though a darker lobby. Summary: Overall we had an amazing experience here.  It is out of our natural price range.  But because of the gift we received to come here, we were able to enjoy it thoroughly.  If we had expendable income, we would go back, no question.",0.9967,0.811,0.181,0.007,0.5655284043441938
2010-06-29,4.0,"Just returned from our trip to Chicago. Tru was very good/excellent (food was very good; service was excellent). If you're familiar with the high level of service at Eleven Madison Park, Tru's service follows the same high standard. There was nothing that our captain wouldn't and didn't do for us. We liked a number of things on the prix fixe menu. We also wanted to try some of the things on the luxury menu (foie gras and wagyu beef). We asked about the foie gras, and our captain told us it's a whole lobe usually served to a table of 4. We asked whether the chef could make us a smaller portion for an appetizer, and our captain said certainly. We also wanted to try the wagyu beef. My sister also wanted 2 appetizers. We asked whether we could have 2 appetizers from the prix fixe, an additional foie gras appetizer, and the 3 oz. wagyu beef. Again, our captain said this would be no problem for the chef. My sister started with the heirloom beets and apple salad with a trio of mousses (celery root, goat cheese, and I forgot the third). She loved everything about the dish. I started with the scallops, osetra caviar and lemongrass that was wonderful. The lemongrass worked beautifully with the scallops, and you can never go wrong with osetra caviar. My sister's second course was the green asparagus and morel mushroom feuillette. This was another winner for my sister since she loves both asparagus and morel mushrooms. My second course was the langoustine, lobster quenelles, saffron potato and bouillabaisse. This was a nice course (only one smallish langoustine). The lobster quenelles were lovely and was the bouillabaisse. Our third course was the special seared foie gras course. The portion size was generous, but my sister's portion was slightly underdone (blood in her piece). The wagyu beef was next and looked lovely. It was served with cippolini onions and shaved truffles. Unfortunately, the beef was not as tender as other wagyu beef dishes that I've had. Service was wonderful all through dinner. Bread was great too. We loved the brioche rolls. It was a bit warm in the restaurant, and we must have drunk a half dozen bottles of water. The A/C is controlled by the office building, and hopefully, now that the hot weather has settled in, the building will up the A/C. We shared a cheese course, and following the cheese, I chose the sorbets that were very refreshing. The dessert trolley was rolled over, and we were full, but chose the pate de fruits and macarons. While the food was not as amazing as I remember it from seven years ago, the service was phenomenal, and I look forward to returning to Tru on my next visit to Chicago.",0.9899,0.858,0.115,0.028,0.5485497835497837

I'm pretty sure this was the case when I went.  The meal started with a lobster bisque which was wonderfully rich but a bit too salty. This was followed by the main course, a beef tenderloin with onion tart. The tenderloin was not overdone, but tasted more like a sirloin than a tenderloin. How can a restaurant like Tru serve a cut of steak that is too tough?! It made me sad. The onion tart was delicious.  Highlight of the meal: dessert. Gale Gand did not disappoint! I had had a terrible day prior to dining here and the baked chocolate mousse with raspberries made me completely forget this. I went home and had a dream about this phenomenal dish.

The best course was the fake ""caviar"" pearls.  Besides the food being average the atmosphere was stuffy and the room was freezing the entire night.

2010-06-05,4.0,"First off, if you think $250 is a completely acceptable rate for a hotel room, if you own $500 shoes, and if your monthly dining budget rivals the GDP of a small country, you can stop reading my review now.  If dropping a few hundred dollars on dinner is a very special occasion for you, if you live on a smaller budget and if you balk at spending $20 on a single glass of wine, then you and I have something in common and you might find my review useful.  For our 3 year anniversary, my husband and I decided to bite the bullet and cough up the cash for Tru. He'd been wanting to come here for ages, and it was either here or L20 (despite my repeated suggestion that we go back to Bonsoiree, which we loved and is BYOB and is only $85 for 8 courses).  To stretch out the evening a bit, since we knew Tru would be our only activity for the night, we decided to arrive a few minutes early and have a drink in the lounge. Don't bother. 1) The lounge isn't like a bar, it's really just a collection of love tables with kind of uncomfortably soft chairs. 2) it's insanely expensive. The cheapest beer was like $12. $14 for a Sam Smith Porter?!  So I ordered a glass of wine, Barbera d'Asti, which was phenomenal and  I think around $12. My husband's drink, the apertif, was $17 (but excellent).  Once sat at our table, we were asked if we wanted champagne. As the cheapest glass was $20 and the bottle of Barbera d'Asti was $60, we decided to jump right into the bottle. We started our three course prix fix with an amuse bouche, which was not very amuse-ing and then out came the appetizers. I went with the langoustine, which was one big langoustine in a boulliabasse broth with some kind of mouse and boiled potatoes. The langoustine was good, but I've actually had better prepared much more simply.  Husband had the steak tartare with egg and truffle. It was fantastic, and the first time we'd ever had tartare. We also added in another course - the wagyu beef ravioli with foie gras in a beef broth (for $25). Skip it. The pasta was a bit overdone, the wagyu didn't taste like anything more than beef, and the broth was underwhelming. The foie was awesome, but...it's foie, it's easy for it to be awesome.  For our entrees, I had the beef ribeye with foie gras. The beef was good, the jus was good, the mushrooms were well done, and the foie again was great. It was all good. But I didn't take a bite and think ""oh my god, is the good"". Luckily, my husband's lamb was fanfreakingtastic. I stole about half of it with no shame.  When it was time for dessert, I was presented with a problem. I hate fruit desserts. To me, it's not dessert unless it's chocolate, and all the desserts had fruit in them. We'd made a note of this when we made the reservation, but still they could do nothing for me.....except tell me I should have come last week when they had a amazing chocolate mousse. Um, thanks.  So I had a small cheese plate while my husband enjoyed his apple dessert. He had a fantastic Irish coffee while I had a glass of Muscato d'Asti.  Then came the famed dessert cart. It had about 6 or 7 offerings on it. I took the only 3 that didn't have fruit in them - a champagne macaron (meh, and I love macarons), a chocolate truffle which it turns out did have raspberry in it, and a canele, which was just okay. So no, I didn't get to experience any of Gale's famous amazing desserts. On the way out, they also gave us a fruit muffin to take home. It was good, but no better than what you'd find at most bakeries.  So the food....it was okay. 3.5 maybe 4 stars. But the service, hot damn the service was amazing. We sat right by the service station and loved being able to watch the orchestration of the service. The servers always arrived in tandem to remove plates, as soon as you stood up, your napkin would be removed and replaced with a new one. On my way to the bathroom I was asked 3 times if I needed assistance. As soon as I re-entered the room, someone arrived at my table to pull out my chair. I literally felt like we were being waited on hand and foot.  The level of service was simply outstanding, and I get that part of the food and drink prices reflect that, but still, when my dinner clocks in at $440 (with tax and tip), I just expect a little more. I should have a meal that tastes so good I'm still thinking about it weeks later. It's the next morning and already the details are getting fuzzy.

2010-04-15,5.0,"Call me sloth. After gorging myself at this fantastic restaurant, I don't think I'll be moving much today. As I saw my 10 year anniversary fast approaching, I remembered the incredible food and pampering service of Tru and booked a table to celebrate. I had simply forgotten how much of both we were in for.  Decor is artsy and modern. You walk into their lounge and it's like hanging out at the MOMA. There are really cool paintings and sculptures all around. The tables and place settings were really neat too. They even have little ""seats"" next to the table for ladies purses.  The food is delectable. Two sides of our personalized menu featured many appealing and tasty options. Chef's tasting on one side, with a few a la carte indulgences like Kobe beef and foie gras. Prix fixe options on the other side. I consider myself a pretty savvy diner, but I still needed some help in figuring out just what some ingredients were. I started with the langoustine in bouillabaisse and my wife had the heirloom beet and apple salad. Our starters were accompanied by tasty little mousees that were just popping with flavor. Lobster mousee for me and apple, goat cheese and celery for the lady. Don't be shy about sharing. No need to limit yourself to just what's on your plate. Our entrees were the ginger flavored Scottish salmon and the spiced venison with cabbage and pear chutney. The fish was a huge fillet in a kind of Asian preparation that was scrumptious. My venison loin medallion was spice crusted and beautifully bloody. I'm glad that I had the venison, because it was the best thing on our table that night. Next up was the cheese cart featuring a dozen offerings of cow, goat and sheep. We selected a few that appealed to us and made quick work of them. The Cypress Grove Humboldt Fog being the best of our selections. For dessert we opted for the Granny Smith apple and the invigorating peppermint. The apple was a sort of filo dough apple pie with an apple sorbet and port sauce. The peppermint was a dark vahlrona chocolate mousse topped with minty cream. These were both sinful. Just when we thought it could not get any better, we were bombarded by the petit four cart, or what I like to call ""How many of those can I have?"" Some of these savory little treats included pineapple marshmallows, macaroons, truffles and lollypops. Oh yes, and they also brought over their chocolate explosion and and a caramel cupcake which they personalized for our celebration. I couldn't even get out the door without being handed a to go cake. Truly an amazing meal.  Service is spot on and as good as it gets. We were greeted with ""Happy Anniversary"" the minute we stepped foot inside and they did everything possible to pamper us throughout the evening. We were even presented with an envelope including our keepsake menu. Black or white napkins to match your outfit, which were neatly folded if you left your comfy chair. Servers were dressed in very nice suits and flocked like schools of fish to present dishes to the table with synchronized timing. Everything came out of the kitchen on brass trays and they made quick and polite clearing of dirty dishes and utensils. Everyone was knowledgeable about the entire menu and offered up suggestions and insight to help us along. They really went out of their way to make us feel special, confirming my call to celebrate at their fine restaurant. They even had our car waiting outside for us.  I just love being pampered and this was an unrivaled experience in fine dining. Put on your best threads and take someone special here, it's going to be a great evening.",0.9989,0.789,0.184,0.028,0.47545454545454563

I visited on Tuesday night, and I hope for the sake of this place that they were breaking in someone new on the line.  The food does not even come close to being worth the money. I ate there a few months ago, and only 2 dishes from the 6 course tasting stick out in my mind: The lobster was chewy, awfully prepared for a restaurant that is charging the prices they are.  The cheese course was excellent.  They do things like printing you a custom menu to commemorate your  experience.  This is something that might impress a suburban housewife that gets out twice a year, but honestly just seems kitschy.   Go to Les Nomades instead.  It's less expensive, and the food is WAY better.",0.9423,0.862,0.138,0.0,0.4934343434343434

Well, me being the lush I am - we went with the 8 course! I swear the heavens opened, and angels came down and kissed this food. We started with some white caviar (now normally I'm not one to eat raw fish eggs, but delicious!) then got some mixture of beats and a truffle soup. The party in my mouth was then joined by a main lobster and some potato's (not mashed, not the fries of the French, nor of the simple baked - but a masterpiece of taste perfection). My favorite though was by far the Rib eye steak. Melt in your mouth tender!!!  By this time I was SOO full, I didn't want to keep eating - but I couldn't help myself, I had to finish the desserts....

2010-03-18,5.0,"Last night I went to Tru for my 30th birthday...forever I've been curious about this place after hearing about the impeccable service you receive, and I wasn't disappointed.  First of all, after we were seated, I received a menu that read ""Happy Birthday Gina!"" which I thought was awesome (yes, I am easily amused, little things like a personalized menu will make me get excited).  The wine list was extensive....and definitely skewed to the expensive 'untouchable' side (ie $500+ per bottle), but had some options on there that we common folk can stomach a little better ($35-$80 per bottle), or you could order single glasses.  After choosing the wine selection we were asked if we preferred a white or a black napkin - having worn a black skirt I happily accepted the black  napkin to avoid that nasty white fuzz you get...amazing! (again, easily impressed).   As for the meal, it was superb - I started with scallops that were topped with a crunchy topping with caviar on top, and as a main course had some delicious venison (I've only ever had it once before in my life, and it's pivotal to have it prepared correctly - so this was definitely the place to get it!).  For desert I had an apple crisp with apple sorbet - and the waitress sent out a special St. Patrick's birthday dessert for my birthday, which was also fantastic.  Finally, (at this point I was ready to pop!) they roll around a little cart with various candies and treats that you can pick from (ie handmade butterscotch lollipops, little chocolate bon bons etc).   The service is absolutely impeccable - these people really know what they are doing, which I suppose is important if you're planning on dropping some cash on a nice dinner. The atmosphere definitely skews to the older crowd, and was a little 'stuffy' in terms of the low music and extreme formality - however, it was overall a fantastic experience!",0.9957,0.755,0.208,0.037,0.6140476190476191

2010-02-16,4.0,"My wife and I recently took a weekend trip to Chicago. A big part of the trip was going to taste the various culinary treats that range from Al's Beef to Gino's East, Blackbird and Tru. My first impression was that there seemed to be a very up-tight vibe to the dining room that night. My wife semi-agreed, but not as much. I understand fine dining and the associated feel, but this still seemed stuffy to me. We chose the standard five-course tasting menu, which goes for $110. There was no pre-set wine pairings, which would have been a nice option, but oh well. The wine list was EXTENSIVE and very high-end. Almost so that I don't believe there was an option under $100. To me, that's just not providing options for your diners. I've been to the Napa region many times and there are quality wines to be had under $100. Whatever, it's wine and again, it's fine dining. Understandable. As for the food... overall it was great. Very refined and showed a great amount of skill in it's preperation. However, I felt that the meal lacked a true inspiration or soul. I did not feel like the chef was truly inspired by the menu or wowed me with much. Yes, it was one of the best gnocchi I have ever tasted and well executed. However, it was a gnocchi in broth. Ok... ? I mean, it was good, but thank you for the potato dumplings in broth with a parmesan twille? Have we not seen a twille for about 10 years now? Anyway, the meal had it's highlights. Specifically, the caviar with avocado puree was delightful. The main courses (Ribeye and Venison) were perfectly cooked and delicious. The pastry chef needs to be recognized nationally for his/her skill. Also, the service was absolutely impeccable and the front of the house was on-point. So, to wrap it up. If you want to taste the best version you've ever tasted of something... go to Tru. If you want to be inspired by interesting combinations and enlightened to new tecniques or styles, go elsewhere.",0.9985,0.739,0.244,0.017,0.46537642045454547

2010-01-19,5.0,"It's hard to begin reviewing such a well documented eatery in the culinary world...let's try though, shall we?  To review a restaurant of this caliber, it's broken it a few groups...atmosphere, cuisine and service. If you are worried about price, I suggest you keep strolling down Clair St to ""C-House"" in the Affinia hotel. Atmosphere - This sophisticated hot spot in downtown Chicago has a beautiful all black window entrance that does not allow you to see in. The rotating doors bring you into a small lobby to meet the host and hostess who will insist on taking care of your jackets for you. The french inspiration of the restaurant sifts through you as they each have the beautiful authentic french accent to put you into the frame of mind for your dining experience. As you are lead to your table, you walk into the dining room. A large calmly lit room with elegance and style is home to an array of full tables and half tables. The backs of the chairs a lush blue velvet to offer a flash of color. The table is pulled completely out so you can be seated and then returned in front of you. Settled in? Let's talk about the food! Cuisine - TRU was an absolute gourmet foodie's delight. This restaurant has it all. You do have some options for ordering and it's all based off how much your budget is...they have two different 'collections' that offer multiple courses as well as a la carte. You can't go wrong with either, they will delight you to no end. The portions are pleasantly larger than I would have expected after eating at other truly 5 star restaurants, though still properly sized. The food was prepared to perfection while the wine list varied from as little as $85 for a decent bottle of wine. The courses are timed perfectly so can enjoy each course without feeling rushed or without feeling like time is running away from you. The food is a wonderful blend of fresh ingredients and classic culinary techniques that will wow you from the start, before sending you to heaven for dessert. Service - The wait staff is extremely informed about not only what is in each dish but how it is prepared should you have any allergies or concerns about what you are interested in. Unsure? Allow them to suggest and you will not be disappointed. Expect the 5 star treatment without feeling suffocated or as though they are hovering. They show extreme attention to detail and want your evening to be perfect. Don't forget to tell them your story...I flew into Chicago specifically for this restaurant, after telling my waiter he disappeared for a few moments. He came back and said he would love for the matradee to give us a personal showing of the kitchen and to meet the executive chef! What an amazing night... You have done yourself a disservice if you do not have the following items: Waygu beef tartar Seared Fois Gras Chocolate Bar - As featured by Iron Chef Cat Cora on ""Best Thing I've Ever Ate""  Expect to spend about 2 hours eating your way to bliss.

Needless to say that was the last time I went there. TRU (no longer in intent, purpose, or name, apparently) Seated: Is Rick here and/or does he spend much time here v. his Northshore property? Not so much, but he's still a partner... Ok... Comment to stately server: only in Chicago would they serve a dried out, flavorless, insipid cheese puff as an amuse bouche. Oh no, the 'real' amuse bouche will be served next (!?), a tantalizing gilded cup of chestnut soup. And then the uncompromised beauty of their now-famous caviar staircase. Followed by 'a play on caviar' (read: fake) with many of the same set up accoutrements. Now I'm getting pissed. This is roughly equivalent to serving $100 an ounce Kobe beef and following it with 'a play' on beef of veggie burger. Talked to the server stating my concerns with what's going on and how we expect at these prices and our admittedly and necessarily high expectations that there's intelligence at work in the kitchen and the choices they make. He assures me, he'll get it back on track. Next course, hold your breath folks...another soup...here it comes...wait...of squash with the EXACT appearance, presentation, and by initial sense, flavor mix as the course we had moments ago. I mean what, is Kevin Brown advising on food here now!? 'twas with this, we said, let's cut our losses and get out of here before I go crazy. And we left, with nary a sorry, a 'we screwed up,' a 'please come back.' It was as if they were intentionally screwing with us and hoped to never have us back. They win.

2009-11-03,5.0,"By far the best experience I have ever had at a restaurant in Chicago.  It is beyond memorable.  It has gone beyond staying in my memory to entering my dreams.  This place is the epitome of perfection in execution.  The service is extremely meticulous.  You are taken care of from the moment you enter.  The food is intelligent.  It is delicate and seemingly lacking in ammunition; however, each bite provides a whirlwind of euphoria.  Ever been to a restaurant where everything has the same taste and feel to it?  If you've only eaten at Tru, the answer is no.  The only constant between the courses is the attention to detail; each course was a new challenge for my mind - which was unexpectedly put through a lot of work in order to process what my tastebuds got to experience first hand.   If I could give more than 5 stars for the service, I would.  I would give the absolute maximum.  It would get the full 5 stars for service factors I would consider to be expected from this type of establishment.  With reservations, your table is ready the moment you arrive.  As soon as you get up, someone will ask if you are looking for the ladies' room and basically escort you there.  They re-fold your napkin for you to return to whenever you excuse yourself from the table.  All the plates go down at your table in time synchronization.   You will NEVER have to wave down the waiter - one look and someone appears.  They explain the dishes in great detail as they are presented to you.  They have a great sommelier who is extremely  patient and knowledgeable.  I could go on and on for pages about how wonderful the service is but I won't.  However, there is one more point I want to make in regards to service.  There is one factor in the service that was extremely special to me and makes me want to give more than 5 stars.  To preface, I look extremely young.  I am - in fact - past my quarter life.  However, I do not look like it at all.  This is not currently a blessing - maybe in 20 years - but in my 20's - it is a disadvantage.  Not only do I get carded 3 times in a bar the size of my bathroom (door, both bartenders) - I get treated like a spoiled teen who has watched too much Gossip Girl.  I am dismissed often and given under-par service.  This not only ruins my experience (although many times I forgive it - as shown by the high ratings I often give on Yelp) - but it is sometimes unfair to the person I am out with.  TRU did NOT treat me like I was somehow ""below"" them - which yes, I've gotten even gotten at Cheesecake Factory (understandable - it's the downtown mecca of teenage diners).  They treated me the same way as the rest of the patrons in the restaurant which means they treated me like gold. This place treats you like royalty.  If you are looking to impress your date or make your wife/gf feel like a princess for ~2-3hrs.  This is the place.  If you got laid off from your job and want to have one ""eff you"" dinner using your severance - this is the place.  It'll make you feel like you are worth everything in this world.  Yeah.  I had no idea a restaurant could do that either.   After your courses, they roll over a dessert cart and formage cart.  Everything is just *sigh* amazing.  If you are full, they even pack up small dessert pieces of your choice into deep-purple-colored jewelry boxes and provide you with small home-made lollipops.  If you think that's it, wait until you leave back through the black curtains - the host will give you a copy of the menu in a large envelope and a mini breakfast muffin for the next morning.  What better way to leave an amazing experience than to be provided with goodies to extend that experience onto the next day?  All those reviews that complain about how small the food is and how it's not worth the buck - I am completely confused.  I was very full at the conclusion of our meal and based on the full experience, it is 110% worth the buck.  But then again, I didn't pay.  But I was happier than I've ever been leaving a restaurant - probably the happiest I have ever been.   I'd hate to kill this review with an over exuberant display of fondness for this restaurant but it really deserves it.",0.9902,0.806,0.124,0.07,0.527214890843923

The dessert cart was wheeled over and we sampled everything: lemon gelee, homemade marshmallow, several types of chocolates, and a meringue cookie.  We thought we were all done but oh no, the waiter brought out two exploding chocolate/carmel truffles.  (PS they really do explode in your mouth) A wonderful evening, delicious food and excellent service.  The dessert tasting is $40 per person - a fantastic value.",0.9869,0.787,0.193,0.02,0.6102380952380952

2009-10-12,5.0,"We went this Saturday for my 40th birthday celebration.  I felt like we were on the set of Iron Chef.  The plates were that out there.   My appetizer was the scallops crusted with quinoa.  It kind of had the texture of sesame chicken.  This was a homerun dish.  My wife had the Thai butternut soup.  That dish had a presentation like no other.  They brought the bowl out with the mussels and the lobster and the other ingredients in the bowl, then poured the soup on it, and added the foam.  Food porn at its finest.   My main course was the venison.  I loved the way it was prepared, and all the different flavor options that came with the dish.  My wife loved her halibut. Given what each of us ordered, I had no idea what wine would be compatible with both dishes.  Chad, the sommelier, came over and helped us pick a wine that worked.  It was a Sicilian red that featured the nerello moscalese grape.  Given that I always want to try a new grape, it was a perfect choice.  It went great with both of our meals.  I had to tease him about all the Nacionals offered on the port list.  ('Has anybody really ordered one of these bottles?' I asked him.)  We had a nice discussion about the uniqueness of the Nacional vines.   We ordered the dessert collection.  This was probably the part of the meal that my wife was most looking forward to, as Gale Gand is her idol.  We each had three desserts brought to us, along with a few other things thrown in, like Gale's infamous root beer float.  I had a late harvest Malbec to go with the dessert (another Chad recommendation), and it really shined with one of the berry dishes.  We would definitely come back here just to have dessert, if nothing else (because it ain't cheap to do the whole production).  I don't think there is another dessert experience like this anywhere, period. It's funny, because these dishes all look so small, and you wonder how you can possibly be stuffed by the end of the meal, but it really adds up in the end.  At the end, I could barely get out of my chair.  We really liked the service there.  There was none of the snooty treatment that one might fear at such an upscale establishment.  If you're planning a special occasion, this is a great place to do it.",0.9758,0.887,0.091,0.022,0.5525547684638593

For the main course, I wanted to try the lobster, however they were out. I expressed my disappointment to the server as I had been looking forward to the lobster all day. To make up for my disappointment, they brought both of us a lobster bisque with huge chunks of lobster. This was a nice touch and tasted great as well. We also had the ribeye and the halibut. The ribeye was delish and cooked to perfection. The puffed potatoes that came with this were yummy and tasted like little potato donuts. The halibut was the standout of the main courses though, very tasty sauce and the leeks tasted awesome with the fish!  Amongst our courses, several amuse-bouche came out and I can't remember what they were, but all were little bursts of flavors! Bread they served was also awesome. For dessert, we choose from the cheese cart, and split a chocolate bar. They also brought out a little chocolate treat with candles, as we were celebrating our anniversary.

This was our first fine dining experience and I had heard that upscale restaurants make newbies feel inferior, but that was not the case at all for Tru. We walked in and a group of waiters was all over us, pulling out our chairs, giving us chairs for our purses...when we went to the restroom, they would fold our table napkins and place them on the table again. Our menus were especially made for us and said Happy Birthday Liz. The food was delectable, the presentation was awe-inspiring. Everything looked beautiful and sometimes they would complete the meal in front of you. They would come out with several plates and bowls and add this and that to the main dish, it was truly a magnificent presentation. We had a three course meal, but we got several mini bite things in between that were equally delicious.  I can safely say that we got our money's worth. After our meal, i received a little chocolate bar with a candle for my birthday. Then they rolled out the chocolate cart with about 20 delicacies. I had read reviews about this, but some reviews said it was complimentary some didn't. So I only chose one. Let me tell you, the dessert cart is COMPLIMENTARY so dig in! When you walk out they give you little lemon cakes, also complimentary. Seriously, don't be afraid of fine dining. TRU, at least, is not snobby in the least, even though it's obvious that you don't normally engage in fine dining.

Some Andy Warhol art nonchalantly adorns the walls, I appreciated it. There's also a really interesting infiniti type of light/wall hanging in the sitting area before the dining room. The bathrooms, simply put, are gorgeous. So the menu. You can choose from a few different options; they have smaller two or three course options as well as larger tasting menus. Decided to go for their larger tasting menu which included seafood. I do not eat seafood so I was very impressed when told that the chef would re-create a menu without the inclusion of seafood. The staff will basically do anything for you here, from what I've experienced at least.  We had a modified 13 course tasting menu; my standout favorites were the Frog Leg, the Liquid Parmesan Gnocchi, the Beef Cheek Ravioli, and the Roasted Squab. Supposedly Gale Gand's homemade rootbeer floats are supposed to be absolutely delicious, but I missed out on having one :( Definitely going back for that, and I believe that they offer a 'just dessert' dining experience as well.  I believe the truffles and chocolates are also available for purchase if you want to take some home, and there's also a chef's table if you want to entertain a small group in exquisite fashion.

2009-07-26,5.0,"I've been agonizing for days at how to sum up my experience at Tru and all I can come up with is something I have already said: it's an experience.  It's an experience that, if you love food, you need to have at least once.   The place is the picture of simple elegance in every aspect considerable. Actually, it was so elegant I found myself whispering to my friend and partner in fine dining, Stacey A., ""Why are we whispering?""   Can't help it.  It just seems like a place where you whisper. Kind of like having dinner with the president, I'd imagine (I haven't gotten my invite yet, President Obama...still waiting).   Long white curtains covering the walls, which are adorned with little else but some abstract art pieces, deep, dark and comfy suede covered chairs, and they give you a little ottoman thing for your purse too, which is something I wish other restaurants would cotton onto stat.  So classy. The food is something I can go on and on and on about, so I will just say I had the Chef's Collection - nine courses of gorgeous, sumptuous food designed around what's in season this spring & summer - and here were some highlights: -Smoked sturgeon ""caviar"" in avocado and hazelnut. I don't know why ""caviar"" is in quotes; I suppose this may not have been the real deal and I don't even care.  The combo of these flavors tasted like a rounder, richer, and more delicious guacamole than I'd ever imagined.   -Porcini tagliatelle with condensed tomato, asparagus cream, and fresh shaved parmesean.  I heard rabbit wasn't good to eat; kind of gamy.  They LIED!  Rabbit may not be good other places besides Tru.  At Tru, it's roasted to a tender consistency reminiscent of a perfect pot roast or pulled pork, set atop a small mound of pasta, and complimented by a fabulous trio of flavors.   -Pan-seared foie gras with lemon confit.  This literally made my eyes pop out of my head.  Soft, buttery, and amazing.  Didn't think lemon would go with it, but it did to an absolute tee.  Oh man.  This dish will haunt my dreams for a long, long time. -Duet of lamb with daikon, watermelon radish, olive, and star anise aus jus.  This lamb was cooked to a melt-in-your-mouth PERFECTION.  I can't say it any more succinctly  than that, so I'll just let it lie. So after that all (and then some), just when I'm considering potential fullness, they bring out a cheese cart with fabulous selections of goat, sheep, and cow's cheeses (the sheep's cheeses were my favorite - who knew?).   I also was utterly unaware of the little dessert cart.  There was a dessert factored into the nine courses, but the little cart with the small petit fors and candies was what really wowed me.  I had a tiny little coffee cup shaped from dark chocolate, filled with Bailey's Irish Creme, and a dark-chocolate covered honey lollipop. Then, once you think it's all over and done with, they bring an exploding truffle - cocoa powder and a thin layer of chocolate containing vanilla liquor of some sort.  It's so delicate that when you bite into it, the liquor completely floods into your mouth, hence the ""exploding"" part.   Of course, to dine like this is extravagant.  It costs an arm and a leg.  I certainly can't afford to eat like this monthly or maybe even yearly on my salary, but was it worth it? Am I glad I did it? Is the experience worth the hefty price tag? Absolutely.  Yes, yes, yes.",0.9985,0.78,0.182,0.038,0.564828738512949
2009-07-24,5.0,"Is any dinner worth $175-200 a head?  This one was...but it was much more than a dinner -  just a fantastic experience.  I loved how they let us swap in dishes from the main menu into the tastings.  So accommodating and flexible, and at no additional cost.  The no additional cost thing was one of the themes of my night as they kept piling on the free courses.  On top of our 6 course tasting menus, we got 2 amuse bouches, a pre-dessert, all the post dessert candies we could want from a cart, a cake bite with candles for my birthday, a black pepper rootbeer float, some amazing truffles with the check, and muffins to bring home on our way out.  That's like 8 extra courses.  Some of the high end places only give you a little bit of the fancy bread, but not Tru.  DEFINITELY got our money's worth and left with bellies full. The other theme of the night was the service.  Completely seamless, high class, and beyond professional (although just a tad bit stuffy).  When you go to the bathroom, someone will escort you ALL the way there.  Someone else will fold your napkin, brush off your seat with it, then dispose of it, while another person brings in a brand new napkin holding them with a set of tongs so that it is pristine virgin for you to wipe your mouth with when you get back.  I loved the tongs trick - hilarious.  They sweep the crumbs off your table after every course, even if there aren't any.  They will never, ever reach over you to present a dish or clear one.  And when they pour your water, they do it in unison with multiple staffers.  I've been to plenty of the other fine dining establishments and while most try to achieve a similar level of service none were as top notch as Tru.  I imagine this is what being a king is like. And I haven't talked about the food.  Every course was simply fantastic.  We asked to swap in the ribeye and short rib into our 6 course tastings and they were fantastic - real stand outs.  The porcini pasta course was also something to remember.  Very complex flavors throughout each dish, but nothing too strange or unfamiliar or trying too hard.  The desserts, candies, and truffles were especially good, with distinct, interesting, and sometimes unusual flavors. If I could eat here every week, I would.  But for a splurge, this is definitely the place to go.  It could even be the place to go for just a plain nice dinner if you don't mind spending a lot and getting a lot.",0.995,0.832,0.145,0.023,0.48624159528414856

And being a cheese lover, i was a sucker for the infamous cheese cart. Yes, I couldn't help myself. Then comes the dessert cart, they have so many small bites and varieties. And, they come back if want so if you didn't get everything you wanted, no worries.  To top off the evening, they give you a very nice personalized printout with your name, your menu and the date. I know, it's so simple but adds a very nice touch. Now all this does come with a pricey tag. We have a $250 GC and it covered half. It was definitely worth it and a memorable experience.

Why do the apps always sound more appealing than the entrees?? Anyway, we ordered the prime beef tartare with a golden egg, the peeky toe crab salad, prime beef ribeye, and moroccan lamb three ways.  The prime beef tartare was by far the tastiest. The golden egg is worth it! It's a raw egg yolk enveloped by edible gold leaf. How euphoric!!  It was well-seasoned and accented by the saltiness of the parmesan tuile.  I could eat this over and over again. The peeky toe salad was fresh tasting. Not particular satisfying in any way. The eggplant, crab and vinaigrette all had about the same taste. I must not have gotten enough of the acid on my plate because it tasted bland to me.  I love peeky toe which on its own is very sweet but the eggplant puree took away from the peeky toe.  The entrees were not memorable therefore I won't really write about them.

From the moment you walk in and hand the keys to your Benz (or in my case, a hotel room) to the maitre d', you feel as though you want to kick off your shoes and unbuckle your belt.  Trust me on this, though, it's better to wait until you are seated.   The setting is very spacious, dimly-lit and perfect for couples or small groups.   There's enough room for cheese and digestif carts to be wheeled from table to table while allowing for servers and patrons to walk past without difficulty.   Carts are also very handy for wheeling you out of the restaurant once you've been suitably plied with food and drink, as is inevitably the case at this Bacchanalian temple.   It's true that the service is impeccable; the choreography textbook French, but the attitude...surprisingly unstuffy.  The wait staff achieved the perfect blend of civility, appreciation, attentiveness and almost (almost) a sense of humor.  I got the manager to crack a smile, but the servers refused to go off script.    Tru stands out from the pack of Chicago food Meccas for its creativity and imagination.  There was little room for doubt that each dish was given hours of thought, twice as many hours of trial and error, and what is finally delivered to you with alacrity and painstaking attention to detail is a culinary triumph.   The tasting menu is well worth the hole burning in your wallet/purse, and if you're as much of a glutton for financial punishment as I am when it comes to dining, then I'd suggest the wine pairing.  The sommelier, Chad Ellegood, knows his cellar, and he'll pick some truly wonderful - and surprising - compliments to your meal.   As for the food...where to begin?  The ""faux"" sturgeon caviar was a playful and beautiful alternative to the real thing; ramp & rabbit risotto with morels and marscarpone was heavenly, with perfect starch consistency and a beautiful blend of flavors; the spring lamb with daikon and star anis jus was plate-licking good; and the salt-crusted venison was absolutely gorgeous, especially when paired with the flavors of cocoa and orange.  Rick Tramonto has taken some very challenging flavor pairings and methods of preparation and combined them to make unique and highly memorable dishes.   But it doesn't stop there.  Gale Gand, not to be outshined by her partner, presents cartwheel inducing flavors.  The almond-violet mousse with rhubarb and lemon was eye-rolling.   The explosive mint chocolate truffle was one of the happiest endings to a meal that I can recall in recent memory.  I was half tempted to pull a ""When Harry Met Sally"" diner scene after the fact, but I settled for seeking out the chef and kissing her firmly on the lips.  No, wait, that didn't actually happen either, but the thought crossed my mind.   Tru is a special occasion experience.  For me, it was my first time in Chicago in years, and Tru had been on my ""must try"" list for almost a decade.  It lived up to the hype, and the food is in fine company with the artwork that adorns the walls of the restaurant.  Now, if I can just swap my room key for one of those Benz's...I'll have what she's having.",0.9985,0.785,0.188,0.026,0.5814625850340136

We walked in, and the hostess told my wife that she looked pretty. The table was pulled out for her, and they asked her if it was set at a comfortable distance. They give you an option of black or white napkin. The wait for drinks was basically zero. I'm not a wine expert by any stretch, so I asked the sommelier to suggest a glass; her suggestion was very good and relatively inexpensive. Breads offered were all very good. The Sea Salt Brioche was fabulous. Salted and unsalted butter from Vermont were placed on the table in blue and clear dishes. I really could've eaten the salted butter with a spoon. Prix Fixe. Hawaiian blue prawns in creole sauce and jalapeno oil, with grits and miniature buttermilk biscuit was the winner of my wife's very good beet salad with granny smith apples and trio of mousses (including goat cheese mousse; I've forgotten the other two). Main courses were a terrific duck breast roulade with swiss chard, wild rice, mushroom custard, and a stuffed brussels sprout for me; braised short rib w/ unagi (eel) and miso emulsion for her. Both outstanding. I had the chocolate bar and wattleseed ice cream with malted caramel and caramel mousse -- incredible. My wife ordered the grape sorbet w/ nutella chocolate, manchego cheese, and basil. The sorbet was phenomenal -- overwhelming flavor when put in your mouth, but somehow didn't overpower the other flavors on the plate. Service was impeccable every step of the way. The servers were coordinated, and there was very little wait between courses; any wait at all was alleviated by several memorable amuse-bouche.

We were definitely bringing down the age curve at TRU, and couldn't help but feel like the staff preferred to ""chat it up"" with the older patrons and make quick work of us.  Perhaps it was comments like this that exposed our naivete?

Some courses were strange but everything was splendid and exquisitely presented. Something that really sticks out to me: At the end of the meal our maitre'd rolled out a cart full of housemade sweet goodies and encouraged us to try one. And me, being a complete glutton--but a charming one!--sweetly asked if I could have one of each. I expected him sneer at me with disdain, or even say no.

My only complaint was that the remote controlled vibrator my date had inserted in me in the cab on the way over had lost it's shit on course 4 and just went off willy-nilly with no rhyme or reason.

2009-03-08,5.0,"THE REVIEW Is fine dining dead? Not as long as Tru is still around. I'm not talking about the molecular gastronomy version of fine dining. I'm talking about a restaurant experience where the classic pillars of fine dining are in perfect harmony: Food, Wine, Decor, Service.  Tru restores the grace and beauty of fine dining. I had a wonderful evening that lasted 3 hours. Tru is located on a very posh street. The very prestigious Relais & Chateaux plaque adorns the outside entrance. A Gerhard Richter piece hangs on the wall behind the reservationist. A Bang and Olufson CD Player resides in the bar area. The main dining room is very dramatic with high ceilings. The tables are all well spaced. The decor has a very subdued color palette---the only bursts of color coming from two floral arrangements in the center of the dining room and the ornately presented food flowing out the kitchen from the uber modern glass sliding doors. I sat at a deuce that allowed me to view the enormous dining room. There are only 24 tables! The menu book has the soothing feel of soft leather. The menus are printed on thick high quality paper stock. The table linens are neatly pressed. Tru rewards highly perceptive diners that appreciate all these subtle nuances.  The staff is very professional---leaning towards a bit too serious. You get the vibe that the servers just might correct you on the pronounciation of certain menu items. However, once engaged, the staff members warm up and allow their passion for good service to shine. Some reviews have criticized the food. The food was excellent. My friend was treating so we both elected to order the 3 course Prix Fixe which I highly recommend. $95 gets you 3 courses.  The non-prix fixe menu titled ""Collections"" is well organized. There's a little bit of everything for everyone.: Luxury, Grand Tasting (6 courses), Chef's Tasting (9 courses). The Luxury collection offers a trifecta of luxury: Genuine Wagyu Beef (3 oz) $70, Caviar with Garnishes $250, and Whole Roasted Foie Gras ($145). I'll have to save up for that type of indulgence. Luckily, the 3 course menu offers just as much excitement. I ordered the Alaskan King Crab Leg, with fresh whipped cream, Osetra caviar. My buddy ordered Seared Foie Gras with white bean puree and Dashi gel. Dee-lish! The King Crab was a beautiful composition of the plump leg sliced on a bias nestled on a warm puree of onion or leek. The server gently drapes the caviar sauce on top of the crab pieces. SO YUMMY! We each had a wine pairing. For main course, I had the Swan Creek Farm Suckling Pig with zucchini pave, licorice, kumquats, and pork jus. This was insane! Pork dishes these days tend to be too greasy. DOn't get me wrong. I love pork fat! I just don't love eating a chunk of fat in one bite. The kitchen did an awesome job of rendering enough fat; preserving just enough to keep the meat moist and succulent. The skin was crispy and wafer thin. This was one gentrified piece of pork heaven. My friend ordered the Braised Short Rib with Unagi, scallion pistou, and miso emulsion. Glazed unagi pieces rested on top of equally glazed tender pieces of Short rib. I didn't sample, but the dish was also a winner.  One of the highlights was my red wine pairing: 2004 Bell Hill Pinot Noir Old Weka Pass Road. Now, this wine was awesome! Inspires me to start collecting wine.  Our server gave us a tour of the kitchen before dessert. The kitchen was immaculate. The Executive Chef, Tim Graham, was very gracious. It was a pleasure meeting him and his team.  For dessert, I ordered the Chocolate Bar. My friend had the milk chocolate-bergamot cream. What do i need to say about chocolate that hasn't already been said?  Tru offers a generous array of mignardises. I don't remember them all, but the liquid truffle and the lollipop were my faves. And if you were still hungry, the restaurant places miniature individually wrapped financiers by the exit. They even walked me out to my cab with an umbrella because it was raining. Now that is service! The check was probably $400 with tax and tip. Just remember that this is a special occasion restaurant. So that price tag is well worth what you get in return. Tru is a winner, period. I'll be back.",0.9985,0.825,0.164,0.011,0.5041598639455782

Picked the last time available (10:30pm). We were there until 1:30am. We both had the Chef's collection and share the 3oz. Kobe beef fillet.  On the whole, the food and service were spectacular. However, the waiter seemed a bit ""cocky"".... and BF had a slight problem with it. I didn't really mind..... E.g. If it's your first time in an upscale French restaurant, you barely understand French, and you rarely eat liver, you probably won't know what foie gras is. And when we asked, we got almost a slightly sarcastic answer...  1 star off! I would love to go back for the food, but racking up a $700 check for 2 is not exactly what I had in mind. On the website, the two tours are priced around $140-$100.... but because it was Valentine's day, they were marked up an extra $100!!! I feel cheated out of my hard earned money!! Another star off!!! Flowers and confectionery are marked up during Valentine's Day... but this was a total rip-off!!!",-0.7255,0.925,0.022,0.053,0.46284722222222213

2009-01-16,5.0,"Be ye hereby advised that, at Tru, YOU also, and not only the food, are in the spotlight! A friend came through town and invited me along to Tru, where he had previously dined.  He promised me that this would be an ""ultimate"" experience.""  He was right. The dinner price was $140 -- apiece -- wine extra -- tab was $210 apiece, incl tax and tip. It was like being part of a play.  We were first motioned to a table. When we got there, two separate waiters stepped over and each helped us with the chair. Whenever we were served, which was quite often, two separate servers came, each taking care of one of us.  They set everything in front of us in exactly the same way at the same time but from different angles.  They would swoop in from completely separate directions to refill our water, etc. at exactly the same time.  If you tended towards the paranoid, it felt like you were in Hitchcock's ""The Birds"". If you needed to go powder your nose, when you got back your old napkin was gone; a new, folded one was there and all your place crumbs had been brushed away. I think if you had needed to blow your nose, they would have rushed over to supply you with a fresh handkerchief for each nostril. There were about 20 servings.  Each was basically a bite (maybe 3-4 if you stretched it) and it came on a HUGE platter.  The platters were all of  different and ingenious shapes -- triangle, rhombus, huge seashell, etc.  There was a little speech for each serving, telling what it was and how prepared. Periodically they brought cheese, antipasto and dessert carts.  There was a little speech about each of the cheeses.  We had some of each.  The dessert cart carried all kinds of hand-dipped chocolates plus homemade lollipops of exotic flavor.  The lollipops came on little wooden rods and were stuck sideways to the sticks as though lain flat on a cookie sheet with the sticks set on top of each while the little globs cooled.  The globs were flat and each about 1/3 of an inch wide.  The little things looked quite cute, as though a child had made them, which I'm sure was intended as an element of their charm. I must admit, I came close to laughing several times because the high-end hospitality display was SO extreme and SO ultra-formal and SO choreographed that it was honestly a little odd. You felt you just HAD to be on stage somehow.  There MUST have been an audience watching.  This was all too theatrical. At one point, I felt hot, after so much listening and sampling, and I took off my jacket.  The female server rushed over and said, ""Please, sir, we ask that jackets be kept on in the dining room."" and I put it back on.  I didn't check to see if I had received a demerit slip or had been cited for a moving violation. The last, largest serving was a TINY quail breast, served on risotto ""with a plum jus"". When the waitress said, ""and freshened with a plum jus"" her tone was so reverent I feared I'd have to laugh. This was clearly a religious moment but I was only a visitor in this church.   I almost can't believe that these people don't go behind closed doors and absolutely HOWL at all they are doing and at the reactions of the more unsuspecting guests, such as me. By the end, I was worn out! We tipped well because this was clearly a service-intensive total-concept experience product.  We were tipping five or six people, really. As we left (at 11:30 PM -- we had been there 5 hours), the staff all huddled about us and fussed over us, getting our coats onto us and giving us special warm cookies for the road.  They patted us here and there like fond relatives and flapped about like so many dazzled birds, so honored and privileged to have had us. I didn't know whether I had been to a restaurant or a spa. Outside, a doorman put my friend into Tru's own waiting limo and took him to his hotel, the Four Seasons.  He wasn't far.  For me, they hailed a cab and for all I know saluted the cabdriver in some special gallant way and sprayed him with a late-night freshener spritz as I was walking around the back to get in. The whole thing was unbelievable.  I hadn't heard anything about Tru before I went.  I was unprepared.   I once had a girlfriend who was a gourmet cooking instructor and who had studied at Cordon Bleu.  When she cooked, it was a major ceremonial ritual every time.  Candied rose petals, special mustards that came in tubes, unusual knives and special steaming baskets for her dim sum were all common. She is one person I know who would enjoy every second at Tru for what it was fully intended to be -- the highest-end cheffery you could find in a public restaurant anywhere. I was more of a visitor to this fascinating realm -- especially at those prices -- than a devotee who will frequently return. But if you are jaded on fine dining and feel there is nothing fundamentally new left to be experienced, make a reservation immediately.  Superb cuisine and incredible attention await.",0.9989,0.832,0.145,0.024,0.474747064803883

From the moment you walk in the unmarked entrance (stashed between Northwestern hospital buildings, it is extremely easy to miss -- we passed by it twice before finally figuring it out), the service is a theatrical wonder that will keep you amused all night long.  It's no wonder this place won the James Beard award for service last year.  Every movement of the waiters is synchronized and they lay down and take away each plate at the exact same moment from both diners.  As a theater person, I wonder how much they had to rehearse to get that right?!  Every single person who worked in that place made it their personal mission to make our experience amazing, from the valet to the coat check person to the sommelier.  The decor is beautiful, understated, modern, elegant.  Floor to ceiling black and white drapes, deep purple velvet booths, interesting art, the coolest bathroom sink ever.  Make sure you go to the bathroom, even if you don't have to go. The food was amazing and interesting and novel and grand.  We had the grand collection.  Here's a rundown of the courses: 1. duck confit, red wine duck gelee, brussel sprout 2. tete de cochon, lentil salad, white truffle powder 3. selection of sashimi-grade fish, complementary garnish 4. beef bullion, carmelized onion, gruyere custard, crouton 5. squid ink tagliatelle, matsutake, grains of paradise 6. mushroom poached striped bass, winter root vegetables, ginger turnip broth 7. proscuitto-wrapped beef ribeye, yukon gold potato, whipped raclette, paprika jus 8. ginger-lim soda, honeydew soup 9. roasted plum, vanilla brown butter, brioche 10. mignardises &lollipops (or in my words...candy cart!) My fiance and I were celebrating our anniversary, and they printed out a very nice souvenir menu that said happy anniversary and listed everything we had.  Additionally, they brought out a plate with a little chocolate with a candle in it with Happy Anniversary piped on to the plate.  Very nice touches. My favorite course was the striped bass.  The sauce it was in was heavenly.  Second favorite was the beef bullion, which was a very unique version of french onion soup.  The desserts were also heaven, and I wished I'd had more room to try everything on the candy cart.  Also, the truffle powders will really something -- they felt like nothing as soon as they hit your tongue but then you are hit with an intense flavor.  amazing.

Most of the food we had there was cold, and the chef, whoever it was that cold winter night, thought it fitting to serve us everything in a cold, gelatinous bubble. I don't know where he/she got that idea, but it wasn't creative or fitting for a night where something warm and comforting would have been more appropriate. The wait staff, while EXTREMELY (almost to a fault) attentive, became more of entertainment for us, as every time they came to the table, it was in pairs, and almost as if they were counting in their heads,  ""1..2..3...AND....set plates on table"", or ""1....2....3....AND.....fill water glasses"". There is something to be said for great, understated service, as if you almost don't even remember they've come and removed a plate, or filled your wine glass, etc. It shouldn't look like the ""synchronized waiter games"".

I had the Chef's Collection with wine pairings. 1.  Preserved Baby Artichoke, Blood Orange, White Anchovy, Chervil Not a Big Anchovy fan, but this was excellent. 2.Strawberry-Tomato Gelee Fava Bean, Parmesan Sounds weird Tasted Great! 3. Sashimi with Complementary Garnishes Light and Dark Soy Sauces I love Sashimi and this was one of my favorite ever. With these three courses I had a 2006 Bruna Pigato Le Russghine Riviera Ligure di Ponente.  It was light and refreshing and started the evening off on a great note! 4. Boneless Frog Leg, Spring Garlic, Carrot, Watercress Really fun...Deep fried, Yum! 2006 Palmina Arneis  5. Artichoke Consomme, Cucumber, Turnip Caramel, Cinnamon Mustard, Grilled Peanut Lustau Papirusa Manzanilla This was an inspired dish and wine pairing!  6. Antiqua Tagliatelle, Spinach, Summer Truffle, Pecorino 2007 Bridge Lane White Merlot Even with the Truffle, this course missed the mark.  The wine was outstanding though. 7.Pan seared Foie Gras, Morel, Pecan, Raspberry, Purslane. 2005 Cantine del Notaio L'Autentica Basilicata Another winner!  God I am glad they brought Foie back.  Even though this is a dessert wine it worked very well with the richness and sweetness of the dish. 8. Halibut, Leek Emulsion, Reduced Chardonnay, Bacon Vinaigrette.  I was catching up on my wines from the other courses;)  I usually find Halibut boring, but this was really good, but anything with Bacon usually is! 9. Salt -Crusted Venison, Cocoa, Olive, Blood Orange 2005 Cousino Macul Finis  Interesting...actually had a savory Chocolate ""pudding"".  Wine worked well with the gaminess of the Venison. 10. Cheese Cart. Eric Bordelet Poire Granit MV I tried 4 different Cheeses  and loved it!   Hey I am From Wisconsin After all! The wine was like drinking a fresh pear! 11. Rhubarb Consomme, Lemon Ginger Tapioca Another fun course served in a shot glass so no wine! 12 Greek Yogurt, Honey, Grape,Frozen Mint Julep. 20006 Banyuls Coume Del Mas Nice light sweet ending to a wonderful meal! 13. A surprise selection of wonderful chocolates As you can tell, I loved my food and the service matched it at every turn!  At one point my waiter even brought me a book on Chicago Architecture so I wouldn't be uncomfortable between courses.(I was dining alone.)  They even gave me a muffin for the morning and called a wheelchair accessible cab for me so I would not need to transfer into a regular one.  That is definitely going beyond the call of duty!  Even though I have seen some less than stellar reviews here,Tru was Definitely a Five Star experience for me!",0.9991,0.731,0.247,0.022,0.586273690078038

2008-07-09,3.0,"This is one of the restaurants that I've been wanting/waiting to check off my list for a long, long while.   Expectations were high and I was really hoping/expecting to have the experience that so many other Yelpers have written about.  In the interest of full disclosure, we were a large group (around 20) and we had the private room upstairs -- potentially leading to a somewhat different experience. First the service...it started out quite well...very attentive during our cocktail hour and for most of the dinner (though one of my co-diners had some wine spilled on her -- they felt REALLY bad).  I did enjoy how calculated the presentation of our food was - always symmetrical.  My personal bugaboo was that prior to the dinner, they asked if we had any special dietary needs/considerations; one of our courses was lamb and I mentioned that I don't eat lamb (we knew ahead of time that they would have a fish substitute for this situation).  Now, what I probably SHOULD have said is...""I don't eat lamb or red meat,"" but hind-sight is 20/20; regardless, my lamb substitute was beef.  It remained untouched for a good 5 to 10 minutes (which I know that our wait staff observed) until I offered it up to the others at my table.  I was a bit surprised that they never asked if everything was alright or if there was something amiss.  In addition, they also became obviously irritated that we were there so late. Now to the food...our passed hors d'Oeuvres were a combination of Toasted Shrimp and Herb Wonton, Lobster Roll, and I think the Mushroom Bouchee -- I enjoyed all three, though the Shrimp/Herb Wonton was my favorite.  Our menu consisted of Seared Ahi Tuna with Hearts of Palm, Spring Pea Veloute (surprisingly good), Butter-Poached Maine Lobster (so, so good -- my favorite), Roasted Lamb Ribeye, and a dessert of Roasted Pineapple & Dense Chocolate.  The presentation of each course was quite nice and I enjoyed being taken slightly out of my food comfort zone with the Ahi Tuna and Spring Pea Veloute options.  However, it wasn't one of the best meals of my life (and I was still on the hungry side) -- which makes me kind of sad.  Am I just a victim of having too high of expectations (like when everyone told me that ""40 Year Old Virgin"" was the funniest movie EVER)? Nevertheless, I'd like to try Tru in a smaller group and sit in the main dining room...I'm curious to see if my experience would be at all different (I suspect slightly so).  Officially 3.5 stars but I'm marking as 3 since they made me feel bad for staying late and enjoying quality time with some of my favorite clients.",0.9927,0.833,0.129,0.038,0.5524113475177306

I know the service would be exceptional, but I was a tad worried about the quality of the food. We had a 5:30 dinner reservation so we were one of the first patrons on a Saturday night. It was nice to walk into a spacious and very quiet dining room. It was actually a tad intimidating with the 10+ waitstaff standing around. ;) When we made the reservation, we let them know that we would be celebrating our anniversary. They made the night very special with phenomenal service (the waiters really do synchronize their movements), personalized menus that we could take home, and a small dessert plate that read ""Happy 1st Anniversary."" I was really surprised by how much effort they put into making it a great evening. The food was good, but as mentioned already, portions are small. We had the three course prix-fixe dinner and ended up getting extra cheese and dessert courses. It's a little tricky when they roll out the cheese and dessert carts. We naively assumed that these goodies were part of our meals, but of course - they weren't! Our bill was pretty high, and I felt a tinge of guilt as my boyfriend forked over his credit card. I didn't get a glance at the check, but I'm pretty sure it was in the $500 range.  Would I return? Probably not. But I had a memorable night. If anything the service overcompensated for the food.

2008-06-04,4.0,"This will be the condensed version of my pal David W.'s review because he beat me to the punch, I will be giving my thoughful insight along with some of the random points in the night that were not yet mentioned in his Yelp. The three of us arrived and were greeted by a friendly server who promptly took our belongings to store and told us to wait in the lounge.  The lounge is a narrow space adorned with a variety of modern art which leads to what looks like a fun upstairs private dining room, the kitchen or the main dining area. We were seating soon after coming into the lobby and I speak for all of us when I say we had the best table in the house.  We were against a window so there was not a lot of people traffic yet we faced the whole of the dining room.  A table next to us probably contained one of the better pleasantries of the night aka 2 latin PYTs and I'd give all of my 4 stars to them even if the food was terrible - which it was quite the opposite. We all did beer pairings with our pre fixe 3 course meals and enjoyed great conversation all around.  Our waiter was friendly and impressively knowledgable about the cuisine and drinks, I mistook him for the manager at first. Now onto some of the small details that made this an exceptional experience.  The staff, to me, went above and beyond.  Our waiter was impressive.  Whenever I left to use the restroom (we were there for 3.5 hours) a new, neatly folded and nicely starched napkin was left on the table - every time.  When my main course was served, the waiter plated the venison for me after taking it out of a choco crust on a tray, tableside, and as he handed me my dish both of my friends were handed theirs at the same time by waiters who came out of nowhere. After we finished our deserts there were more waitstaff who brought us complimentary chocolates and other assorted sweets.  This was a nice touch and we were able to try almost all of the assortment.

2008-06-04,4.0,"There are a few restaurants in Chicago that I have always wanted to go to and for some reason have never made it to.  Tru was on that list until last night.  Tim W., Mystery Man, and I made 7:30 reservations and when doing so expressed our interest in doing a beer pairing with our meal. We arrived just before 7:30 and were promptly ushered to the perfect table smack dab in the middle of all the action.  Our server, Israel, greeted us and inquired about our desire to match beers with our courses.   To help make our selections we decided to start the table off with a bottle of Barboursville Viognier from Virginia (yeah, our Virginia!).  The wine was absolutely lovely and a great example of how delicious this grape can be. It also helped that the bottle was value priced at just $48.  So we enjoyed our breads, lot's of butter, our amuse buche, our bottle of wine, and the table across from us before digging into our first course. Each of us opted for the three course menu for $95 and all ordered different appetizers and entrees. Mystery Man started with the Lobster Soup with Spoonbread.  We expected lobster bisque, but the soup itself was a simple delicious broth with chunks of lobster and spoonbreads.  I had the Diver Sea Scallops with Red Pepper Essence, Chorizo, and Avocado Dumplings.  The scallops were beautifully cooked. The avocado dumplings were unique and delicious.  However, the presence of chorizo was not all too apparent and the emulsion didn't add much value to the dish.  Both Mystery Man and I's appetizers were paired with Klumbacher  Brauerei  Eku Pils.  I typically don't drink pilsners, but this beer was superb and paired well with our dishes.  Tim W. started with the Prime Beef Tartare with Raspberry Powder, Red Pepper, and Zucchini.  Tim W. won round one hands down with this dish. The tartare was outstanding on its own, but the accompaniments really made this dish stand out.  The tartate was paired beautifully with a bottle of Indica IPA from the Lost Coast Brewery. Mystery Man ordered the Hawaiian Orange Marlin with Heart of Palm, Baby Carrot, Leek, and Sauce Provencale for his entre.  None of us had ever eaten Marlin before and the fish was delicate and well cooked.  The beer paired with this dish was a bottle of Brasserie Duyck St. Druon de Sebouej.  Tim W. once again ordered well by going with the Salt-Crusted Cervena Venison with Cocoa, Olive, and Blood Orange.  The venison loin is ""unearthed "", carved, and plated table side.  Almost every bite presented subtle hints of cocoa, olives, and blood orange.  A savory cocoa mousse with cocoa mashed potatoes was another highlight of this dish.  I typically don't like venison because of its gamey flavor, but venison was perfectly cooked and the game didn't hit you over the head.  They paired the venison with a bottle of Out of Bounds Stout from the Avery Brewing Company in Boulder, CO.  Last but not least I ordered the Suckling Pig, Zucchini Pave, Licorice, Kumquats, and Pig Jus.  The licorice was actually cooked down black Twizzlers. A bit gimmicky for me, but overall the dish was solid.  The highlight of this dish came in the form of Tempura Zucchini. This dish was paired with the hands down best beer of the evening, the Koninjshoeven Quadrupel Trappist Ale.  The nose on this beer was almost indescribable and the taste lived up to the noses promise.    For dessert, both Tim W. and I ordered the Chocolate Souffl served with Cinnamon Ice Cream and a Camp Fire Marshmallow.  The souffl was yummy, but was showed up by the Cinnamon Ice Cream. The ice cream was ""Holy Shit!"" good.  Mystery Man, who doesn't like chocolate or peaches, went with the Roasted Pineapple with Coconut Ice Cream.  This dish was another win on the dessert column.  The desserts were paired with a bottle of Coffee Porter from Meantime Brewery.   The decor at Tru is subtly modern and understated.  The restaurant showcases a handful of modern works of art that add the occasional burst of color.  For the most part the interior remains a blank canvas that allows the food to shine as it should.  The staff was perfect!  Our server adapted to our personal style quickly and didn't miss a beat or a subtle dirty joke.  Israel also provided outstanding beer pairings and seemed genuinely excited to accept our challenge of pairing their contemporary cuisine with ""beer"".  The chef de cuisine also paid a visit to our table to discuss the food and beer pairing. He also extended us an offer to come back for an even more elaborate beer driven pairing.  Solid food paired with exceptional service made Tru worth the wait. 3 Prixe Fixe 6 Beers 1 Bottle of Wine 1 Cappucino ---------------------------- $500.00",0.999,0.825,0.155,0.02,0.4903860028860029

So I thought I would call Tru and see if they could bring out a birthday cake for my mother or recommend someone for me...well when I asked them for this request they were insulted that I would have their pastry chef make a birthday cake. They kept asking me if I knew who their pastry chef was, yes I did and honestly I didn't care. Finally they gave me the name of a bakery that was able to produce a wonderful 3-tired cake for the 20 guests and they even delivered it to the restaurant. Well the dinner was going wonderful till we got to desert when the restaurant informs us that they don't have any candles after they bring out the cake. Are you serious?

It was a fun and memorable meal, well worth making a quick jaunt to Chicago to enjoy it.  I'd happily go back.",0.9766,0.691,0.253,0.056,0.5814393939393939
2008-03-24,1.0,"I really wanted to love Tru after all I have heard, but my husband and I had a very disappointing experience.  I had called months in advance to reserve a table for our one-year anniversary. I gave my name and AMEX number to secure the reservation, and told them it was a special celebration (i.e., 1st anniversary).   I received a call a few days beforehand asking to confirm.  I called back and was told that the reservation had been canceled.  I told them that was impossible as I was just calling now to confirm.  The man on the phone was curt and told me my husband must have called to cancel so I should check with him.  I told him that I was managing this and no, there must be a mistake.  He told me that was highly unlikely but if I still wanted to come he could fit us in a later seating. I was ticked, I should have canceled then, but this was something I had wanted to try for years.  So I swallowed my irritation and agreed to the later seating. When we arrived at the restaurant were were asked to wait in the bar while they prepared our table.  After 10 minutes, we were taken to a table right next to the wait-station - not the best seat for sure.  Then we were handed menus congratulating ""Michelle and Adam on their anniversary.""  Our names are not Michelle and Adam - it was so awkward and uncomfortable.   We ordered the tasting menu with wine pairings, and the food was good but having a small group of wait staff standing kitty-corner to you talking amongst themselves put a damper on things.   Not the romantic, sophisticated experience I had wished for. The cheese service was also very disappointing given the price, and I really love cheese....  We finally mustered up the courage to mention to the waiters that we were not Michelle and Adam (the waiter had called me Michelle at one point...).  He apologized and then it clicked in my mind that Michelle and Adam had canceled.  The waiter shared the last name of Adam with me - alphabetically adjacent to mine.  They must have accidentally canceled my reservation instead of Adam's.  Made me even more annoyed with the attitude I got over the phone implying I was out of touch with my husband! After paying over $600 I just wanted the night to be over.  Very sad experience....",-0.1002,0.777,0.114,0.109,0.551127531472359

2008-03-07,3.0,"I was given a bunch of Lettuce Entertain You gift cards recently, and I decided the right way to use them was to burn them all in a blaze of glory. So that's how my girlfriend and I ended up at Tru on a random Thursday night, celebrating nothing in particular. Now though, I wish I'd split them up and gone with a couple free dinners at Cafe-Ba-Ba-Reeba or Mon Ami Gabi. Or maybe even five free dinners at RJ Grunts. The night started off great-- sitting in an SUV parked right outside the restaurant were Heather Graham and the guy who played Vern in Stand By Me. I'm not sure if that's a permanent gig for them, or what, but I really appreciated the effort Tru made to make the night seem special. Anyway, Tru gets a big A+ for service. All your needs are accounted for, and every function the staff performs is choreographed to perfection. Because of the professionalism of their servers, Tru absolutely shines when it comes to things like the cheese course and the wine list. Our server could speak at length about every bottle of wine I mentioned, and the doling out of cheeses is a ten minute experience in which you learn about things like vegetable ash and it's ability to pull the moisture out of goat cheese. Where Tru does NOT shine is the food. I don't want to be misunderstood-- it's not that I thought any of the food was bad... in fact, everything we had was very good. But make no mistake, this is one of the most expensive restaurants in the city. At this price point, you're not looking for a good dinner, you're expecting culinary artistry. And the flavors here just don't meet the expectation. We both had the Chef's Collection, a 9-course tour of the chef's abilities. It's only about 12 hours after we left the restaurant, and I'm having trouble remembering most of the courses we had. Am I being incredibly hard on Tru? Absolutely. But when dinner approaches $500 for two people, a restaurant should be held to the highest standard. At Alinea, for instance, each of the 12 courses you're served is like a revelation. You find yourself amazed at the genius of the chef, as he combines three and sometimes four distinct flavors into a perfectly balanced single bite of food. Tru, quite frankly, is just not as good. And I may not be the only one who thinks so... We made our reservation only seven days in advance. Alinea or Trotter's would have been impossible on that little notice. But even though Tru appeared to only have half of the seating area open on the weeknight we were there, we were still able to get in at 7:15.",0.995,0.836,0.136,0.029,0.535234126984127

Tru is expensive, but it is very very special.  Do not expect to see Gale Gand (from Sweet Dreams) or Rick (famous Chef) on-site . .  but that doesn't hurt the food.  Both times my wife and I went to Tru we ordered a three course menu and added an optional course (1st time Cheese, 2nd time upgraded the dessert to a 3 course chocolate tasting).  Though the courses themselves are balanced (not cheesecake factory huge), we did not go away hungry. . .and I'm a big guy :) Nice Touches: Setting the plate for all members of  your party simultaneously, the coffee cake for the next days breakfast, an amazing bathroom (if not that functional).    Tru will always have a special place in our hearts.  My wife and I love great restaurants and Tru beat Paris' Tour D'Argent hands down (ripoff),  and is a little bit more of an experience than Gary Danko's in San Fran.  Now that I live in Chicago I look forward to trying Aliena and Charlie Trotters",0.9949,0.81,0.19,0.0,0.557960557960558

She use to have this show called ""Sweet Dreams"" on the Food Network. Well I had the three course menu and it was very inventive and delicious.The portions were a bit on the small side, but I think that is to be expected. The service was a bit too attentive for me. When I needed to go to the restroom, a waiter would completely remove the table so that I could get up. I thought that was a little dramatic. Also, the lighting was really really bright.  A nice little touch is that they have a few sample courses that they give you in between the courses you choose. These are on the house.

There were also two egregious service missteps that were so over the top that they became a running joke during the meal: 1) The ""water-waiter"" (one guy who only poured and re-filled water glasses) literally splashed water all over the table every time he poured, trying to show off how he could hit the glass with the pitcher poised 3 feet above it.  He couldn't. 2) The ""description waiter"" (one guy whose only job was to describe the preparation of each dish) was absolutely unintelligible.  English was at best his 2nd language (sounded more like 4th to us), and despite us listening intently and him speaking VERY loudly, we had no idea what we were eating most of the time.   Amazing faux-pas, considering the reputation of the place and the guy who owns it.   We actually e-mailed the restaurant after the fact, and they replied with an apology and a gift certificate, which was nice.  However, the GC can't be used on Saturday nights, making it all-but-worthless for us suburbanites.

I only know ever so vaguely what I like in a wine, and was a bit overwhelmed by their extensive wine list, but the wine steward was immensely helpful in finding wines that we both loved. I believe that we ordered an 8-course meal.  Each of the courses was inventive (hedgehog mousse? pop rocks in Champagne?), and used obviously fresh and top-quality ingredients.  Without question, the scallops that I had were the best of my life.  In addition to the courses listed on the menu, our waiters brought out at least an additional half dozen dishes in between (all in all, I believe we managed 4 or 5 dessert courses alone). I would certainly go back very regularly if I could afford it.  The bill for two came out to be about $375 after a few glasses of wine each.  All in all, the meal was well worth the price, and if you can find the occasion to splurge on a meal, I highly recommend Tru.",0.9945,0.817,0.183,0.0,0.4729606625258798

2008-01-02,5.0,"Drum Roll please..... for my 100th review I found it most fitting to review my favorite restaurant in Chicago, Tru. Technically this isn't even a review.... the menu is ever-changing so I'm not going to drone on about food that will likely no longer be featured by the time you get there. What you do need to know about is the impeccable level of service demanded of the staff at Tru. You will not feel more important or pampered ANYWHERE... the staff times everything in carefully orchestrated maneuvers to create a seamless experience of culinary and visual delight.  Be prepared to have Tru be the only thing you do in an evening... there will be no bars, movies or anything after this meal. It will take several hours and you'll be in such a state of food ecstasy that the thought of putting one more thing in your belly will be unbearable.  Rick Tramonto does such an amazing job with the food, it's not only artistic and beautiful but even more delicious than it is aesthetically pleasing (ding! ding! ding! this is how food should be done people). Be sure to choose a prix fixe option as dining a la carte here is for amateurs... you don't come here to compromise on quality or selection. The Gale Gand dessert cart will really drive the point home with tons of hand crafted goodies and lavender lollipops... Gale is also known to pre-package little desert cakes that they send you home with. I can not think of anything else I would rather pair my morning coffee with....   Tru is my one and only choice for special occasions and milestone dinners - anyone who knows me knows that this is my answer to treating myself or my friends to something decadent and extremely fabulous.

2007-12-11,2.0,"Chef Rick Tramonto has a philosophy, ""If you can't fix it, feature it.""   That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.  Tru pretends like its still a top quality restaurant but it lacks in many areas that restaurants a quarter of the price excel. The menu despite being custom printed to celebrate a special occasion, didn't reflect any of the dietary restrictions that were identified when the reservation was placed, which immediately limited our order to one side of the menu. I ordered the salt soup, which would have been great if not for the overwhelming essence of lobster, a distraction from what was clearly the feature of the dish, the salt.  The soup was topped with a lobster foam that was easy to inhale and made me cough.  At least, you have to appreciate the creative combo though, lobster, lobster and salt; my palette was swimming in a flavor. Main course: Rolled cucumber and peach foam was well placed to hide the  lamb, purchased at the end of the day from our neighborhood Jewel butcher.  I know him, nice guy but tough meat. For desert the toffee pudding was excellent, I have to admit but if it was 6x bigger we could've found it at TGIFriday's (not trying to diss TGIF, just wondering if they share recipes.) The courses were peppered with complimentary bites one of which was excellent, the Anises Tea.   The abalone inside of a jelly floating in sake was just unnecessary. With bright lights, sterile walls and long white curtains against tall white pillars, if the patrons wore gowns open in the back it would've been indistinguishable from a hospital cafeteria.  Coincidentally the hospital is across the street. The service, I don't think I've ever been asked so many times if I was done with my plate.  Call me silly but if I still have the fork in my hand, there's your answer.   There are certain things one expects from a restaurant with such a reputation so in a way Tru faces a high bar but it did at least live up to part of its reputation, it is expensive.

When you walk in through the black curtains and they seat you by name. Or when they poured the water into our glasses, it took two servers. When they gave us our menu's they had Happy Anniversary Don and Steve at the top. The sommelier recommended a bottle of wine that was 100 bucks. No  problem, it was very good. But when I saw another bottle go by, and they have quite and extensive list it made me feel had. So for my second try I shot from the hip and ordered a Spanish wine, Dei La Leda. It was 50 bucks and she smiled and told me that she wouldn't be mad for making my own selection because it was a very good choice. And it was better than the first. We started with prime beef tartare, grilled diver sea scallops, avocado green-apple salad and nantucket bay scallops. I can't tell you how much flavor came out of such small portions. They also gave us pumpernickel bread that was delicious. We both had the butter poached maine lobster with white asparagus bisque, orange, almond. I don't think I need to say anymore about that. They bring around a cheese cart when your finished with your main course. Then the dessert menu. My only complaint was the souffle' took 30 minutes. The Everest asked if you want it to order it at the begining of your meal. Yes I wanted it, but I had been there for two and a half hours already. After desert they came out twice with homemade candies that you would kill for. And to top it off they had a torte with our names and anniversary scrolled in frosting on the plate. The Startrak kitchen door was great entertainment. Every time it opened the servers would come out in a straight line and attack your table from every angle. The decor is non existent.

2007-10-28,2.0,"A thoroughly disappointing dining experience throughout. The service was immaculately orchestrated and beyond reproach in its timing and willingness to accommodate, but it could not pull this off without making us painfully aware of itself as such.  All gestures were grandiose and the atmosphere became overbearing because the staff was so conspicuous in all its activities.  Descriptions of dishes were given with the gravity of a military report and yet, still left us wondering about the exact preparation and ingredients used for each dish. Worst of all, we were constantly made aware of the corporate nature of TRU and this slick feeling of propriety and normalcy permeated every activity.  Smiling, socializing, or any other deviation from the staff's beautifully choreographed routine is not permitted. But all this would have been gladly forgiven if the food would have been commensurate with our expectations (not to mention the prices).  Long story short, it did not.  Far and away the best part of our dinner was the wine, a hauntingly beautiful 2003 Grace Family cab that my friend picked out from the vast, well-chosen, reasonably priced, and overwhelmingly Francocentric wine list. We ordered the Market menu; a brief rundown of our courses follows: Amuse Bouche Thin slice of pear layered with a touch of olive oil and a shaving of aged Parmesan.  Quite unspectacular, although the serving was very whimsical - the ingredients were layered in an oversized silver spoon (insert joke of choice here).  The pear was under-ripe and unseasoned.  Neither the ingredients nor the preparation were up to par.   Sashimi Knife skills were flawless but once again, the ingredients were pedestrian at best.  The fish was incredibly fresh but poorly sourced.  The flounder had a pleasant mouth feel and an alluring richness but the tuna and yellowtail were lean and flavorless.  The tuna especially felt like a blank canvass for the duo of sauces, both of which thoroughly overpowered the fish.  The Uni sauce itself was quite pleasant but it had nothing on the authenticity and complexity of the Uni sauce we had in Mirai the next night. Oyster and Uni Tempura A definite upturn.  The oyster was pristine and this was the only execution of Uni tempura I have ever had that really worked.  The sorrel puree at the bottom was also very fresh and flavorful.  Good. Rabbit Consomm The broth was deliciously complex and concentrated, if a bit overly salted.  The rabbit torchon, however, was completely bland, as if the over-salted consomm was supposed to compensate for this.  The puree was quite tasty but it and the nearly flavorless lavender foam were completely extraneous.  Mediocre. Ricotta Tagliolini Turning ricotta cheese into extruded noodles was a neat trick but the resulting noodle had an unpleasantly slimy texture, a lukewarm temperature, and not an ounce of flavor.  It made a suitable sponge for the basil and acacia foam but this dish didn't come together well.  The charred cherry tomato was exceptional. Mediocre. Whipped Salt Cod The unquestioned star of the evening. This dish was absolutely perfect in conception and execution, the whipped brandade was intoxicatingly rich and creamy and the smoked, gelatinized potato noodles added greatly to the flavor and texture of the dish.  Great Hawaiian Mong Chong The fish was expertly trimmed and quite generous for a tasting menu portion but the fish was over-poached to the point of being dried out and flaky and the Thai spices overwhelmed any nuance the dish may have had.  Bad. Roasted Squab The squab was severely overcooked and just not good; the elaborate presentation (the bird was cooked whole, with the breast then being removed, boned, and served) meant that the dish was barely room temperature.  The accompanying faro was delicious and toothsome but was also lukewarm.  The pepper sauce did an admirable job of masking the taste of the squab, however.  Terrible. Selection of Cheeses Solid choices, headed by Humboldt Fog, possibly my favorite cheese.  No complaints here and the accompaniments were tasty and appropriate.  Good. Bittersweet Chocolate Mousse, Lime, Milk Chocolate, Thyme Gale Gand is a master of her craft and the dessert course was absolutely sensational; several layers of chocolate, each with a markedly different flavor, barely accentuated by fragrant herb and citrus.  Great. Sweets from the dessert cart. Great confections from the pastry chef.  Nothing as rousing as the dessert course but very good nonetheless.  Good. Out of the seven savory courses, one was great, one was very good, and the rest ranged between mediocre and inedible.  The meal was marked by lackluster ingredients and strongly flavored sauces and accompaniments.  Surprisingly, with all the intricate machinations of the wait staff, not once were we asked if we enjoyed the food, as if a question such as this would be beneath a well-oiled machine such as TRU.",0.9993,0.765,0.189,0.046,0.6110975609756097

Don't get me wrong, those were great, the Caviar Staircase in particular. I just wasn't wowed, so it wasn't pushing through that barrier to be crowned the Best of Chicago in our minds.

We opted for the Spring tasting menu.  8 or 9 courses and added a course of sunchoke at the beginning.  The sommelier was very knowledgable, but informed us that he was having a difficult time with the chef's selections and the prevelance of spring vegetables (asparagus, artichoke, sunchoke) that are notoriously difficult to pair.  Awesome, thanks for letting us know that the wine might not work??  We're paying an arm and a leg for dinner, the least you can do is lie to me and tell me it's all going to be fabulous.

The food was very well thought out and created as every dish had several tastes that complemented each other really well. We had Halibut and Smoked Tenderloin. I really loved the Halibut and I'm not really that big on fish.  After the dinner and formal dessert, they brought out little candies, including hand made tiny lollipops. At first I thought that wasn't very exciting. But they were so cute, I gave them a try. They were banana and Anise seed and actually changed the taste of the after dinner wine.

2007-07-10,4.0,"Why only 4 stars?  TRU is a delightful indulgence in many, many respects:  impeccable and gracious service, playful and intriguing menu, all amidst comfortable and modern surroundings.  I give it only four stars because, while it was the most expensive meal I've had the pleasure of eating ($900 for two people), it was not the best meal.   I went expecting ambrosial bliss, but came away noting it _only_ as a very pleasant meal and fantastic experience. My husband and I each ordered the Chef's Market Collection and accompanying wine pairings, as well as the near-famous caviar staircase.  In the end we were served 12 courses, plus amuse bouche and other ""little bites.""  It was truly a night of food! There were two courses that very nearly sent me into the foodie heaven I was hungering for: the roasted asparagus with shallots and parmesan; and the braised veal shank with sweetbread cappelli, carrots and veal bouillon.  Both dishes were prepared with delightful layers of tongue dancing flavor that sent my head spinning.  Oh, and I mustn't forget the dessert!  An awe-inspiring accomplishment composed of chocolate hazelnut mousse, orange sherbet, and cardamom-scented oranges.  Wow! Additionally I should note the buffalo mozzarella dumpling with green olive emulsion & black olive powder, served as an amuse bouche -- quite enchanting.  As was the cheese course (the four cheeses I selected have disappeared from memory, quite upsetting).   The wine pairing with each course was also delightful as an accompaniment (of which I was grateful),  but perhaps not awe-inspiring in their own right. The much talked about caviar staircase was a bit of a disappointment, however.  Perhaps it is my own fault -- while I am quite fond of caviar, I found the sturgeon caviar lacking a bit in texture and ""pop.""  The slightly blander nature of this type of caviar truly needed the accompaniments of creme fraiche, red onions, and capers that were served.  But what was lost in actual flavor was in part made up for in the overtly decadent presentation. The disappointments of the evening's meal came in the form of an over-abundance of foams and gelees.   Every dish, it seemed, was steeped in this trendy food preparation, and as the evening wore on it became rather boring.  The foam less so -- every preparation was at least ripe with exciting flavor.  But the gelee turned ugly with the course of whipped salt cod and creamy potato -- a foul taste and texture approximating ""fishy jello"" as though whipped in the Bass-o-matic of SNL legend.  One dish I wish I had sent back. Overall, however, the experience was quite positive.  I imagine I will be back.  And I will remember to order the wine pairings with each course, and to pass on the caviar.  (And if at all possible, avoid the gelee!).",0.9956,0.779,0.165,0.056,0.5926865594722738

Tables are spaced perfectly so we could share an intimate dinner.  BF had called ahead and had them personalize our menu for our celebration (we later took home the menu and they printed out a separate menu for us with all the dishes we had).  It was truly special. Immediately we were served a buffalo mozzarella palette cleanser, a great way to start the evening.  We decide to go with the Chef's collection as it was more in line with our palettes.   16-courses of delight.  My personal favorites were:  Selection of Sashimi Grade Fish, Complementary Garnishes Rabbit Consomm, Morels, Pea & Lavender Emulsion Whipped Salt Cod, Creamy Potato, Smoked Gele, Caviar Tagliolini, Peeky Toe Crab, Uni Poached American Red Snapper, Green Papaya, Fennel, Thai Nage Chocolate Hazelnut Mousse, Orange Sherbet, Cardamom Scented Oranges - This may be the best chocolate dessert I've ever experienced.

Sure enough, they brought out two boxes and sent us home with a great assortment of chocolate and candies.   I cannot say enough about the service we received.  Approximately 5-7 people served our table, perfectly synchronized from clearing our plates, filling our wine and water to describing each dish to perfection.  Staff was very courteous, delightfully charming and always smiling.  On our way out, they gave us two loaves of iced lemon pound cake for breakfast! 48 hours later, and I'm still thinking about our experience at TRU...",0.9992,0.754,0.246,0.0,0.5981320170344562

If I could give 4.5 stars I would. Let me start by saying that I am not a fancy dinner guy...I would prefer a steak over caviar on a cracker. However, I went to Tru with a totally open mind ready to try everything that they offered.  My wife and I went on a Thursday evening, late at 9pm, and we left a little after midnight. We never ever felt rushed, I actually found the pace of the meal very enjoyable. Every single person on staff was providing the best possible service, though I think they could do better with where they store the clean wine glasses, they were constantly restocking a shelf with glasses right near our table. My wife had the Spring Collection and I had the Chef's Market Collection, and overall both were excellent. Each course offered showed GREAT attention to detail and presentation. Each dish had delicate mix of flavors, most of which I had never tasted. High points for us were: -Roasted White Asparagus, Shallots, Parmesan -Rabbit Consomm, Morels, Pea & Lavender Emulsion -Artichoke Emulsion, Trout Roe, Condensed Mint, Dende Oil As an un-experienced diner, I felt that each dish held a rather small portion, though I know that the taste and the presentation are just as important. (A piece of veal the size of a silver dollar is a little on the small side...I think a second piece could be spared.) However, after progressing through to the cheese course, you begin to become full. Then they hit you with a selection from over 15 different offerings of cow/goat/sheep's milk cheese, with widely different tastes. The cheese fills in the gaps in your stomach left by the smaller portions. THEN then hit you with desert, which is just as excellent as any of the dinner courses. And if you couldn't take any more, they bring out some small chocolates and some desert bread to fill in the open space on your plate.  Now I can say that I have experienced the top of the line this city has to offer...but would I go back? Probably not, or at least not for a few years. It is just not my thing, and it is fairly cost prohibitive. When I go out for a nice dinner, I think around $100-$150 max for the two of us...and Tru is definitely far above that range. But more than the price, the style is just...too...fancy for me.

The food itself was outstanding.  Everything was perfectly prepared and presented well....  Dessert is fantastic, too.  We both had the full chef's collection tasting menu, and even though we both ordered the same thing we got different courses throughout the night...

Very impressed.  And, there were even some affordable bottles of wine on the list.  They ranged from $45 to 6,000 (no typos), and the decent selection of wines by the glass allowed me to try more while not spending way too much. The food was pretty good.  The only bad thing about the kitchen table is that you don't choose your menu.  This means we were exposed to things we probably never would have tried on our own.  This is good and bad.  I thought the food was just okay (BEAUTIFUL, but not always my taste), but I really enjoyed trying everything and I absolutely feel that I would think it was better had I ordered my own choices.

2007-04-25,3.0,"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH This is simply for having to plan an event here.  Just don't do it.  I don't know where you should go instead n Chicago.  But it is not going well.  My event is a week away and while not everything is Tru's fault, they certainly are not making it easy. The biggest issue is that the Chef doesn't want to have to prepare for having choices in private dining meals.  So you have to give your guests 1 meal option. Here's where that's a problem for me. 1. I NEVER pick restaurants when friends and I go out to eat cause I don't want the responsibility. and 2.  I'm bad at picking my own meals (especially weeks or months in advance) So: therefore, I'm having problems.  First I outsourced menu selection to the 2 members of my company's staff actually eating the meal.  Then the menu changed.  So I made a logical change.  Which meant that the entree was going to be beef. Well - the California mentality of my company says that that's bad - people either a) need 2 choices or b) the one choice needs to be something ""safe"" like chicken. Welll there is no chicken.  And the Chef won't make options. And oh! the private dining contact is harder to find than Lindsay Lohan's underwear.  I've worked with 8 different private dining contacts at similar restaurants in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, LA, San Francisco, Dallas and Minneapolis.  All of them have been gracious and great helps as I plan these events.  The contact at Tru has basically been unreachable and when she is reached, she's completely unwilling to help me find solutions So where does that leave me?  Sitting in Berkeley 1 week before the event losing my mind about what to feed 18 people that I don't know. Maybe by next weekend it will all be smooth and nice - but for now...no.  For now, I'm stressed and completely unimpressed. Edit: 4/28 - Plus 1 star.  So I don't know if they read my review but suddenly my contact is much easier to reach and much more willing to help.  She helped me find what she and I thought was a great solution.  Which my CEO then shot down.  Soooooooooo - when I went back and said: we need 2 options and that's that.  She said: ok.  And now it's happening.  Now there's a matter of my event order being about $30 more/person than originally quoted...but we'll talk about that on monday.  The event is wednesday - expect an update. Edit: So we ended up cancelling the event (yeah, after all that work) because people waited till the day before to say they weren't coming.  Hello!  RSVP by X date, means RSVP because I'm dropping mad money on you.  Anyway - lost hella cash and went through the madness of the meal for no reason.  I think this may be a good place for rehearsal dinners or small business meals or just a nice dinner out, but NOT for special events.",0.9009,0.822,0.099,0.08,0.5404608585858586

As Crystal and I checked in, we were directed to the bar as the staff gets our table ready. We ordered two glasses of the 2004 K Vintners Viognier to start off the evening. About half way through the glass, we were informed the table is ready and offered a tour of the kitchen before sitting down. The kitchen tour wasn't too interesting, just a standard quick walk-by. The dinner menu was presented to us, one side listing the pre-fixe menu with choices and the other listing the Collection options. Unfortunately the Seafood Collection wasn't available, which was what I wanted to try, but we made do with the Market Collection for the both of us. A different approach to the wine pairing aspect, nothing listed, offered if asked and kind of go on a whim based on the $$ one wants to spend. Not exactly how I would of done if if I owned a restaurant, but that's a different topic. The Market Collection is a nine course menu as listed below, course three through seven were prepared two ways with each of us having a different preparation of the same main ingredient. *** Grand Amuse-Bouche ~Scallop Ceviche, Avocado Puree, Lime Segments ~Tuna, Marinated Trevio, Orange Italian Black Pearl Osetra Caviar, Chilled Cauliflower Creme, Lemon Confit 2002 Selbach-Oste Zetlinger Sonnenuhr Riesling Kabinett New Zealand Langoustine ~Fresh New Zealand Langoustine, Thai Chili, Lemon Zest, Watercress ~Roasted New Zealand Langoustine, Baby Carrots, Turnips, Fennel, Langoustine Jus 2003 Hirsch Gruner Veltinger Kammener Heiligenstein Duck ~Duck Bouillon, Duck Prosciutto ~Veloute of Duck, Duck Confit NV Rare Wine Company Charleston Sericial Madeira Special Reserve Nova Scotia Halibut ~Nova Scotia Halibut ""a la plancha"", Sea Urchin, Preserved Lemon, Citrus Jus ~Roasted Nova Scotia Halibut, Razor Clams Casino, Bacon, Clam & Spinache Sauce 2003 William Fevre Chablis Montmains Pasta Course ~House-made Farfalle, Chicken Wing Confit, Bayonne Ham & Foie Gras Glaze ~Spaghettini, Carbonara Sauce, Parmesan Reggiano, Raw Amish Egg NV Henri Billiot Rose Brut Prime Midwestern Beef Ribeye ~Roasted Prime Midwestern Beef Ribeye, Braised Beef Short Rib, Glazed Pearl Onions, Crispy Bacon Lardons ~Grilled Prime Midwestern Beef Rib Eye, Fondant Potatoes, Bearnaise Reduction 2003 Yann Chave Crozes-Hermitage Tete de Cuvee TRU Collection of Cow, Goat and Sheeps' Milk Cheeses Cherry Mint Soup Duet of Desserts 1999 Chateau Pajzos Tokaji Aszu 5 Puttonyos Mignardises and Lollipops *** While the food was good overall and we got to try two different preparations, not one single dish gave me the wow factor. As usual, the final meat course failed me once again, although good to see it was ribeye rather than the standard filet mignon, but that's about the only compliment I can give the course. The wine pairing choices were nice for the price they charged, but the word pairing should be crossed out as none of the wine paired well with the food. Not saying the pairing was awful, but definitely more thoughts could be put into the process. The service was attentive, prompt and precise, but WAY TOO mechanical and stuffy. Small talk with the Sommelier didn't go anywhere, seem disinterested. None of the staff at the restaurant had a smile on them except for one person. Same type of service as French Laundry, but not what I would enojy as a dining experience. TRU is not a place I would return, just from the food standpoint, French Laundry, LaToque and Cyrus all out performs TRU.

We then were greeted by our servers who provided our menus for the evening along with a very extensive wine list.  It was a nice touch to have a custom printed menu for the birthday girl atop her menu.  It took a while for us to decide what to get since literally everything on the menu sounded delicious, but we never felt rushed and our server was very helpful in suggesting items to sample.  We decided to skip the marathon dinners (Black Truffle or Chef's Collection) for a lighter fare so we ended up with the caviar staircase and prix fixe meals. For our amuse bouche, we got to sample some delicious melt in our mouth dumplings.  The staircase featured four delicious and very fun to look at  lumps of deliciousness.  I started with their Hawaiian blue prawns accompanied by an aromatic curry sauce - to prepare me for that appetizer.  My main course, butter poached Maine lobster, was cooked to absolute perfection and was greatly enhanced by its accompaniments.  There was bisque to enhance to sweetness of the meat, a citrus and almond sauce to accentuate, and finally the most well prepared asparagus I've ever had.  I capped the dinner off with a beautifully made vanilla parfait with blood orange marmalade and chocolate ganache - it was picture perfect. It was amazing to see completely synchronized service - the removal and placement of our meal was perfectly timed on both sides of the table.  In addition to our fare, we were further stuffed with samplings in between each course not to mention post-dessert desserts with things such as lollipops, truffles, caramel corn, variety chocolates.  My date enjoyed a beautiful birthday brownie with a birthday message written in icing on the platter.  Before heading out, they handed us the custom printed menu signed by all the chefs that helped make the night so memorable - talk about thoughtful! Tru really demonstrated why they are one of the best in world class dining.  From the impeccable service to the sample fare pre/during/post dinner, everything was perfectly executed.  On the way out the door, they handed us our coats and a complimentary banana bread.  All I could think of at that point was ""Boy, we're stuffed!...

My husband and I each had a ""collection"" but it all needed to be modified as we are vegetarians who do not eat shellfish. The food was delicious. The sashimi course was great, the fish just about melted on our tongues. There was also a salmon course and a black cod- both were prepared beautifully and tasted excellent. There was a mushroom ravioli course that I did find a bit odd. It was essentially 2 mini crepes with some sauteed mushroom in between them. The taste was good but I wouldn't call it ""ravioli"". The two standouts of the evening for us were: the dessert cart and the cheese cart. Both are wheeled over to the table and the cheese selections were prepared tableside. Very charming. And, a great selection of cheeses. The dessert cart is adorable, complete with ""gourmet"" lollipops. I didn't love anything that I ate from the dessert cart but it was cute! Then, they come around with truffles. The ""elvis"" is not to be missed- its banana and peanut butter! We also had a dessert off the menu that was pretty forgettable---we were very dissapointed in that. It was pumpkin something and average at best. The service is impeccable, they are extremely attentive and it is worth it to go and just get pampered. Their attention to detail is almost flawless, in that respect.

Dining at Tru is far from just eating dinner; it's more like an adventure (especially for those brave enough to trust their palates and Amex bills to Mr. Tramanto and go for the spontanteous collection.) I've tried about 100 courses at Tru and almost all of them were truly excellent, with none being less than very good.

If you are going to go there for dinner I would suggest doing the special menus.  Since it's not a place you will go to a lot it pays to do the entire dinner.  Beware you will constantly be asked to add thing to your set menu to add to the price.  Tru also has several half bottles of wine which is a great way to do it because then you can have a half of white to share and then have some red with the meat courses.  The wine can add to the experience but it also adds to the price.

2006-09-21,5.0,"Everyone should experience Tru at least once.  I went with some friends a couple of years ago and it was incredible.  It isn't dinner, it is a theatrical experience.  The service is amazing, impeccably timed (every water glass was filled at the same moment, plates were placed in unison, etc).  They even escorted me to the ladies room (which was beautiful).  We were there 4 1/2 hours and could barely get up after! Not only do you get all the courses of the tasting menu, but they threw in a few amuse-bouches as well.  The food was delicious and artfully presented. I am going to have to go back and try the new lounge menu, it sounds really good.  I wish I could afford to dine at Tru more often!",0.9682,0.847,0.153,0.0,0.5455965909090909

2006-08-06,4.0,"Four plus hours of synchronized waitstaffing, water pouring, dish serving, restroom guiding, wine describing, and dessert indulging. My friend and I both had the chef's tasting menu, and it was fascinating to see the two different interpretations of the basic foundation of each course. The location was all about clean lines and contrasting blacks and whites. As a dessert afficionado, however, I feel I can't give the true (hardy har har) full five stars because the dessert, which was much feted, no longer included a separate chocolate selection. Sad. However, I must say that TRU offered a new and exciting handbag experience: each individual's purse gets its own little seat. Charming, non?",0.8587,0.803,0.134,0.063,0.6306818181818182
2006-08-03,5.0,"I'm not even going to bother talking about the food here. It's obviously pretty amazing.  I'm giving them five-stars for the adventure of trying to foil their impeccable service.   By the time our food arrived, my companion and I had been seated, served and swaddled by no less than a dozen precisely coordinated dervishes.   I'm a pretty low key dude, so all of this attention kind of freaked me out (in a good way, mind you; I mean no disservice to the incredible experience they provide).  Of course, given that my bladder is the size of a morel-infused poached fava bean, I inevitably had to use the little pilgrim's room.   I waited patiently until all of the visible members of the troupe appeared to be swirling around other patrons to make my break. I made it to within 3 steps from the restroom door when someone LEAPED OUT FROM BEHIND A CURTAIN to show me the rest of the way.  Needless to say, it took me a couple of minutes to calm the notion that someone was going to leap out to assist me at the loo, too.  That said (tongue-in-cheek, of course), the staff at Tru did an amazing job at removing the pretense and pressure typically associated with fine dining and injecting it with fun and flair, resulting in a fabulous experience neither my friend nor I will soon forget.",0.9574,0.798,0.137,0.065,0.709963768115942
2006-06-27,5.0,"This is by far my favorite upscale restaurant.  I have been there about 5 times now and everytime is out of this world.  It is very pricey especially if you get the wine pairings, but it is well worth the experience.  I would highly recommend trying this place at least once.  With the wine pairings and the chef's selection, you are looking at about $500 for two people.  That is of course the biggest chef's station they offer, but if you are going to go that is the way to go for sure.",0.9125,0.862,0.138,0.0,0.6536111111111111
2006-05-03,5.0,"To go to Tru and give it anything other than 5 starts would be churlish.  I went with my Wife last night, the food is exceptional, certainly as good if not better than Trotters. Without pontificating about the various courses I would just say go try it, but make it for a special occasion. The tasting menus are about as good as it get. The bill's not bad either, about $250 a head.  If I were pressed my favourite restaurant would still be Everest, the view gets it for me.  I would go back again and fully intend to. Chicago certainly has some fabulous places to wine and dine!!",0.9698,0.791,0.195,0.014,0.5375992063492064
2006-05-03,5.0,"I enjoyed dinner at Tru last night.  I had the spring tasting menu and my husband had the grand tasting menu.  It was really lovely.  Each course had lovely freshly prepared ingredients.  The staff is very attentive and friendly.  It's a very approachable fine dining experience.  The desserts are always special here and there are so many of them! I was surprised to see foie gras on the menu, but now I understand that the ban isn't in effect yet.  It was nice and I enjoyed it all the more since it may be the last time I have it at a restaurant in Chicago. I like this restaurant better than Trotter's.  I think it's because the dining room is a more open space.  I always like to people watch a bit at these sorts of restaurants.   This is an expensive and decadent experience, but you only live once so treat yourself!",0.9857,0.726,0.245,0.029,0.6089026915113871
2006-04-17,5.0,"Rating: Superb  Phenomenal, creative, classy.  Some of the words that immediately come to mind when I think of my visits to Tru.  One of the finest restaurant in the city, without a doubt.  Having been fortunate enough to try many top restaurants in the country, Chicago's Tru ranks up there with the best.  I first encountered the talented Executive Chef Rick Tramonto at Trio Evanston and his style, selection and implementation of the menu items is truly (sorry-couldn't resist) spectacular.  Definitely get the Grand Tasting Menu, incorporating a wide variety of courses giving the customer a solid feel for culinary nirvana.  If you go to celebrate a special occaision, be sure to mention it when making a reservation as the staff is extremely attentive and will even create a customized menu for you--a must if you want to recall the whirlwind of preparations and ingredients.  A must try, but plan on around $160 per person without drinks for the Grand Tasting Menu, block out 3 hours and Let the Good Times Roll!",0.9758,0.757,0.213,0.029,0.6360750360750361

I would rate this restaurant the best in Chicago - Trotters has great food also, but Tru has better ambiance and service.   Don't miss the caviar staircase, and especially the cheese plate.

We got such a kick out of the service. . . It was like a well rehearsed ballet  - each move was choreographed. As dishes arrived at the table they were served in unison and revealed with a flick of the wrist.
