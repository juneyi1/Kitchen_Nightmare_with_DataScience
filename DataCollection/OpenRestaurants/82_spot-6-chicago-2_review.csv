2008-09-13,4.0,"I was surprised with this place. its not too similar to other places around it. it was fairly empty at first, but didnt have a barren feeling. the down stairs reminded me of a run of the mill half hipster house party. that is where most/all of the crowd normally moves to after about 1am. it was stuffy, and i was sweating so hard after all of the dancing. obviously, if youre looking for a high class air-conditioned top forty hits club, this isnt for you. but i like to let loose, and this was a good place for that. lots of public sexin. take it or leave it. (i took a teeny bit of it).",0.778,0.805,0.117,0.078,0.442096866096866
2008-05-29,2.0,"I've been here a couple of times for events held in the basement.  While I had a good time at those events, which usually involve a friend's band or art showing, I can't say too much about the bar itself.  The basement acoustics can actually provide decent enough sound if gear is set up properly, but the space is completely barren except for what event holders bring to the party.  The upstairs is usually empty, and has decent enough music and a good amount of space (I love big and empty).  It seems like a weird hipster hangout in the midst of Wrigleyville, but I'm not sure if that is a result of the events I was going to or that is normal.   Cans of PBR is $3 which is ok, but everything else is like $6, which is above dive pricing.  I think this place could make a decent neo-dive, but it suffers for lack of direction and ends up being heavily dependent of events to bring in its crowd. That in itself is not so bad and I guess its hard to stick out in the neighborhood that is routinely filled with pre and post cubs game drinkers.  NOTE:  Do not even attempt to park in this neighborhood before or after a cubs game.  Service is decent, but as mentioned in other reviews, they seem to run out of things or not have things stocked at the bar.",0.9512,0.826,0.114,0.06,0.5044802867383512
2008-03-25,3.0,I suprised myself by paying $5 to get in here. The crowd here was weird. The basement was like a really empty rave in a storm cellar. I did like the hideous vinyl couches down there. There was what seemed like a bar downstairs but there was no alcohol on the shelves and the guy standing behind it was just some dude. I don't even know that he worked there. It was a good place to practice my runway walk. I gave it three stars for potential. The crowd wasn't bros and it wasn't gay. They weren't quite hipsters. They were the young making out against the wall crowd. Potential I say...,0.5273,0.866,0.082,0.051,0.6746913580246914
2008-01-19,1.0,"I came to Spot 6 as a favor to a friend. Her friend was DJing and his band was playing. I thought ""hey, this will be fun. I'll get to experience a bar I would never go to normally"". Well, I did get to experience a bar I wouldn't go to normally but it was horrible!!!! Their bartender upstairs was absolutely terrible. He looked bored as hell and has his back to the patrons a lot of the time. I have no idea why, maybe he was trying to look like he was really involved with doing something? The bar itself also had a horrible beer and liquor selection, I was seriously shocked.  Downstairs is more of an unfinished basement than a bar, seriously. It looked like something that would be against fire code to have people down there.  All in all this bar did not have good service, it did not have a good selection of drinks and I wouldn't go back even if you paid me.",-0.9778,0.701,0.094,0.206,0.5722222222222222
2008-01-11,5.0,"Spot 6 has become a regular space for fundraising parties of many activist groups, for causes ranging from Venezuela-solidarity to prevention of violence against sex workers. I have had many friends hold their benefits here, and it must be good to them cause they keepin going back. The basement is quite dank, but kind of like the Bottom Lounge's used to be, and there's comfortable furniture, enough space for plenty of people, and a nice staff. And I don't like House music, so on that I am not equipped to judge.",0.9507,0.76,0.214,0.026,0.541880341880342
2007-11-28,2.0,"I cannot express how much I really wanted to love Spot 6. The music was fantastic, but everything else in my two experiences here has been absolutely terrible. Why?  THE BAR. It took me 3 orders to find something that they currently had stocked ON A FRIDAY NIGHT. Black russian? Sorry, no kahlua. Bacardi O and 7 up? No Bacardi O. Oh look, no flavored rum or vodka OF ANY KIND. Ended up with a watery Captain & Coke. Not okay.  THE BASEMENT. Far from charming, the low ceilings and musty smell make it horribly claustrophobic and the acoustics are atrocious. Sure, it's kind of like seeing your friend's crappy punk band in their basement, but it kind of sucked back in high school too. Now that I'm grown up, I'd rather go to a clean venue, preferably one where my 6'5"" husband can stand up and not fear for his head. The ceilings aren't THAT low, but they sure feel like it.",0.3303,0.656,0.178,0.166,0.6565700483091789
2007-07-31,3.0,"Spot 6 is having an identity crisis, I think.  It apparently used to be a classy joint.  Then the owners decided to renovate it.  Into what?  That remains to be seen.  Months later the renovations are still taking place, so the club is in an ongoing state of unfinished-ness.   I ventured to Spot 6 for a couple of goth-y club events, but they were much too fetish-y for my tastes.  One of them involved a 50 year old man walking around in a polo shirt and nothing else.  Do not want!   Upstairs there is a bar, some sofas, and bathrooms.  The bartenders seem to alternate between giving me free drinks and ignoring me.  There's also a creaky, cramped excuse for a dancefloor.   At one point the DJ booth was not even in the same room as the dancefloor.  I hope that this has been permanently remedied.  The sound system is also notoriously bad, and frequently blows out.  After passing through a weird empty room, follow a steep, rickety flight of stairs down to the dank, concrete basement.  There's another bar down here.   If anything, Spot 6 is an OK place to have a couple of quick drinks before moving on to a nicer club in the area.",0.813,0.818,0.106,0.076,0.38786549707602336

2006-07-06,2.0,I went to this place because a friend of a friend was the guest DJ or something like that.  He was terrible and his idea of DJing involved playing what sounded like a mix CD including 5 or 6 Depeche Mode songs in a row.  I still gave it 2 stars because at least the bartender gave us a couple of free shots.,0.9081,0.701,0.252,0.047,0.7333333333333334
