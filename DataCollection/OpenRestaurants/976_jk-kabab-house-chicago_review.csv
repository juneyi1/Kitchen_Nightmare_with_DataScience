2017-02-10,5.0,"DISCLAIMER: I am giving the place 5 stars based on the one thing and the only thing I ever get from there. The Chili Chicken Roll. It's simple and spicy as hell. But it's heat w/ flavor and lots of it. I'm not sure what the chicken is seasoned, marinated, and cooked in it but I have to assume some sort of standard hot sauce like Frank's or something. Sounds simple but there is way more to it. But it's very tender as its both brown and white meat. A generous amount of that chicken is placed in a traditional Pakistani/Indian flat bread called parrata (sp). Then they add raw onions, grilled jalapeños, and cilantro with a very light cream based white sauce on the side which helps take the kick down a little and compliments the roll. I'm not wowed by food very easily but JK's Chili Chicken Roll did that for me and I've gotten one a week since I've tried it a little less than a year ago. But here's the kicker, this isn't even their signature dish. The Chicken Tikka is. My buddy had it and loved it FYI.",0.9681,0.825,0.136,0.039,0.5636641777026392

2017-01-27,3.0,"I've tried JK Kabab a few times and I feel their food is inconsistent. The first time I visited them I tried their Bihari kebab and I was instantly a fan, kebab was rich with flavor and very succulent.  The next time ordered the Bihari kebab and Chicken Tikka dishes. Traditionally, chicken tikka are boneless cubes of marinated chicken char grilled, at JK chicken tikka is a bone in half-chicken. I like spicy food and have a high tolerance for heat but the high spice level in the food was quite overpowering and we were struggling to finish our meal. In our most recent visit, we tried the Chapli Kebab, Beef Seekh Kebab, Frontier chicken and Boti kebab. The Chapli kebab was good the rest of the food was Ok. The Seekh kebab lacked flavor, Boti chicken was dry and the frontier chicken was blah. All entrees come with a chappati/paratha, Rice and Salad, the chappatis are huge and I usually pass on the rice. Typically you enjoy Tandoori food with mint-coriander chutney, surprisingly none was offered with the food, after inquiring with our waiter we were offered a tiny plastic cup of the chutney from the back. Food is grilled fresh so it takes almost 30 mins or more to get your food, this is probably why they serve a complimentary cup of corn soup which a throwback to Indo-Chinese cuisine.  Service is good and staff is friendly.  Given the other options on Devon street this may still be the best tandoori joint in the neighborhood.",0.9904,0.811,0.17,0.019,0.5531818181818181
2017-01-16,5.0,"SPICY GOODNESS We went to a friends house to celebrate Lohri which is a Punjabi festival that represents the longest night before the winter solstice. One of the things that we love about going to this celebration is the amazing authentic food. Our friends typically go to multiple Indian restaurants selecting the best dishes for their party. I am constantly asking them where each dish comes from. I need to know where all this awesome food is coming from.  The one dish that they purchased from the restaurant was a giant catering tray of chili chicken. I can honestly say that this was one of my favorite dishes of the night. The chicken was incredibly tender and quite spicy. My lips were burning in a good way. I also started to sweat a little but it was totally worth it. A friend of mine kept saying, ""Just keep eating more so the burn goes away!"" We all had a great laugh as our foreheads started to perspire and we dived in.  The chili chicken reminded me of the best pulled BBQ chicken I've ever had but an Indian version. I was wondering how fantastic this meat would taste on a sweet Hawaiian roll. My culinary mind never stops thinking about food combinations. I would come to this restaurant just to order this dish. I also noticed from the menu online that you can also order a chili chicken rice in addition to just chili chicken.  I wish this review was longer but we didn't personally visit the restaurant. I can tell you that I had previously bookmarked this location, so I was very excited to see our friends had ordered food from here for the party. After having the chili chicken I am definitely going to come here for lunch or dinner.

Staff is friendly and accommodating. You get greeted with a warm egg drop chicken noodle type of soup which quite frankly hits the spot on a cold day. I highly recommend the chillichicken wrap... ask for some extra onions and maybe even some extra raita because it has the perfect kick.

I had combo 2 which had Frontier chicken and lamb kabob. The chicken wasn't flavorful and the lamb was shredded but has a soggy texture like liver that was extremely off putting. Didn't want to finish. But my buddy had a chicken kabob and it was pretty good. Think you need to stick to kabobs except the lamb one.  The staff was nice too.

2014-08-27,5.0,"JK Kabab House not being on the main road of Devon is the only reason it is not a bigger deal than it currently is. Simply put, you get some of the best desi BBQ items here. Their combo portions are HUGE, and two people can easily satisfy themselves with just one. Their chili chicken is different from other chili chickens - it's a drier, spicier, shredded version of the desi (Indian/Pakistani) favorite...incredibly juicy and well-flavored, and stupendous when paired with their paratha, which is absolutely divine. Their Seekh Kabab and the Bihari Kabab are completely melt in your k ity items too, and a MUST try. Also, their chili chicken fried rice is a good option for those who have a deep love of rice, or all things biryani. Lastly, keep in mind that their food is made fresh, and its an experience in itself hearing the sizzles and sounds or the grill, and being immersed in that succulent aroma - but this does take a few minutes to prepare, so be patient if you want the good stuff. The GOOD NEWS, however, is that they keep you occupied with a nice, hot cup of veggie/egg drop soup that is also extremely hearty and delicious, and makes for a great teaser for the main event! :)",0.9912,0.779,0.199,0.021,0.6356717687074829

It's a fast food type joint and doesn't try to be fancy, and you get the bang for your buck! If my meat hadn't been so salty I would have rated it higher. It was also really difficult to find street parking on a Friday night, but I think that's too be expected for that neighborhood at that time.",0.4123,0.885,0.072,0.043,0.6155555555555555

2009-07-21,3.0,"One of the annoying things about going to Indian restaurants is you order a main dish, but you can't eat the main dish without rice and naan.  You tack those sides on and your $10 meal ends up to be $20.   One great thing about J.K. is that your meal includes rice and paratha.  The staple sides are nondescript and effortless but I  get a full meal for under $10.  However, after eating here, now I remember why I don't order Indian kabobs because you get a kefta type kabob (will stick to Middle Eastern kabob).  So forget the veggie dishes, forget the kabob, and stick to the grilled meat selection such as tandori and boti.",0.057,0.89,0.047,0.062,0.4809523809523809

2009-02-11,3.0,"This place is average. Decent selection of kababs, but they are nothing special. Service is good, and the lassis are kind of small for the cost. No serious flaws but no great virtues. There are better places.",0.8646,0.522,0.299,0.179,0.6060846560846561
2008-04-02,4.0,"This place is like the Devon version of Middle Eastern food, straight up grilled meats.  Start off with the Chili chicken and Tikka. The decor isn't setting the world on fire but you're paying less than ten bucks, get over it.",0.128,0.886,0.075,0.04,0.2833333333333333
2007-01-20,3.0,"Greasy spoon. A favorite amongst college aged peeps and cabbies, an out of towner told me about JK's.  Its a small place with about five tables, street parking and a shared lot across the street (good luck).  Its fast food Indian, cooking time is tedious, bring a book.  I typically get mine to go.  They've got most of the typical specialty dishes, i.e. Chili Chicken, 65, Frontier Chicken, assortment of kabobs and Dal.  Kulfi lovers, holla back, they've got Pista and Mango. JK is my spot when its holiday season(they're open on Christmas and New Years) and there aren't shit else open when I want Indian.  Yes, I said it is a fast greasy spoon.  Yes, it does look dingy from the outside.  But, the food is constantly good.   Aside from the cheap $4.49 lunch combo, dinner can run expensive if you are rolling with many.  Portions are ample and can probably accommodate two.",0.974,0.836,0.164,0.0,0.5820247933884297
