It was not busy. We watched our server walk back and forth to the table next to us to grab what they were asking for without checking on us. She hadn't been trained to touch more than one table at once or multitask. Once she disappeared for 20 minutes. And when she dropped off the check, she walked away for 10 minutes even though my husband had his card out already when she dropped the off check.

2017-07-24,1.0,"So fun fact, Leona's offers a brunch menu on the weekend. The minute I saw Breakfast Calzone I pretty much died (2 of my very favorite foods together?! YES). We quickly placed our order - we're hungry, and we have to catch a show - and waited. And waited. And waited. At one point our waitress came out and said our meal will be out within 5-7 minutes. So we waited for 5-7 minutes. And then another. And another. AND another.  MIND YOU - this place is pretty empty. Like maybe 4 or 5 other couples, plus we had arrived before majority of the other patrons.  FINALLY food arrived with no apology from waitress or even an excuse as to what happened with that 5-7 minute window she gave us 25 minutes ago.  And then she places this enormous calzone in front of me. Holy crap. This thing could feed a small family. After cutting into it and taking a bite, my breakfast food loving heart broke. This thing had no flavor, had huge pockets of nothing inside, and the majority of each bite was crust.  We made sure to ask for the check as soon as the waitress dropped off our food, and the second she returned with my card, I was already one step out the door with 98% of calzone still sitting at our table, uneaten.  If management is reading these reviews (which with the amount of negative things here, I doubt it, but...) get rid of that brunch menu, clearly breakfast isn't your thing, nor are calzones.

We are regular customers that enjoy attending this location for local community gatherings, our Alderman's events and for the occasional dinner and have had no issues in the past. Due to our experience yesterday, we will never again be frequenting this location. It was colder than 10 degrees Fahrenheit and the door had frozen over making it impossible for us to open. As the door was difficult to open my partner tried flagging down the staff by waving her arms and banging on the glass to catch their attention in order to get some help. No less than 4 different staff members looked directly at us and then turned and walked away (one of them in an elf outfit). We then called into the location at which point the manager, Kevin, helped us open the door. After we explained what happened he was less than helpful; he offered no discount, he didn't have anyone check out the door to prevent this from continuing to happen and instead of trying to be understanding the woman in the elf outfit became hyper-defensive and aggressive, getting very loud about how she didn't see us after looking directly at us and walking away. As if that wasn't bad enough, while we were speaking with the manager a staff member decided to cut in and ask us if we were going to be a dine in because she couldn't be bothered to wait for us to finish speaking with the manager. Maybe they thought we were homeless and didn't deserve any help in the freezing temperature. Maybe they saw two people of color and didn't think we were worth their time while they laughed and walked around the tables (not doing anything mind you).

During a trip back to Rogers Park for an appointment, I was excited to head back to Leona's, a restaurant I enjoyed when I lived there. Although the place was not particularly busy when I arrived, after ordering a lasagna with side salad, I had to remind the server about 15 minutes later that I was still waiting for my side salad. My lasagna finally arrived after 45 minutes and wasn't even hot. When the server asked how everything was, I pleasantly commented that the lasagna had probably been sitting for a while. She apologized and said the kitchen was really busy (at this point, only half of the tables were being used).  The server later said she'd make it up to me by giving me a free dessert. I said it wasn't necessary, but she said she felt bad for the slow service and semi-warm food. I took her up on it and enjoyed a delightful tiramisu.  Imagine my surprise, then, when my check arrived with a $7 tiramisu on it. I mentioned it to the server who came back minutes later and said the manager wasn't going to take it off the bill because (get this) the server hadn't cleared it with him first. I asked to speak to the manager and explained that after a couple mishaps, the server was trying to do something nice and that I shouldn't be charged for a dessert I wouldn't have ordered had it not been offered to me for free. Thankfully he agreed to not charge me for the dessert but reiterated that she shouldn't have done that. I couldn't help but think that wasn't my problem. (I should also mention that, as a final eye roll, the pen they gave me to sign my bill ran out of ink, and I had to use my own. Ha!)

I'm a 22 year old gay man, and on my first visit I overheard a table at least 20 feet away of middle aged people discussing how gay pride is stupid because there's nothing to be proud of. On the second visit, I overheard a group of angry old white people yelling about how all black people do is complain about police brutality, making other tables stare as well as mine. I strongly feel your clientele reflects you as a restaurant, so I have to say I'm unimpressed.  Lastly, the drinks are pretty overpriced, but that's to be expected.

2016-05-02,1.0,"Saturday I had the unfortunate experience of dining a Leona's on Sheridan in Chicago.  I was excited because first I remember that location as the library. A rib place that had great root beer and ribs and used to show movies long before big screen TV's. Also because when my wife and I lived in the neighborhood we used to order from there. SO when I entered I was expecting a bit of nostalgia, food and fun with good friends.  What happened ensure I will never be back.  The food was not as good as I remembered it. It wasn't bad, the wife still liked the red sauce as she always had.  But the service was atrocious. The waiter said he was newish in his third week and told us so. No biggie, most of us have waited tables in this group. So, he was already in the ""we will cut him some slack"" category when he took our order.  We also informed him we had a hard stop as we were headed to a concert.   Service was slow and orders were served to the wrong people, details were not followed. (Fries well done, chicken on that pasta Ect) in fact more than half of us had our order wrong in some significant way. We assumed the things he had not brought was because he didn't write them down.  We were in a rush because things were running slow and when the check came that was all wrong also. Turns out he did write things down and charged for them even if they were not brought to the table.  The check was completely messed up. We were late, so we left a drivers license and said we would come back after the concert.   Because we were late there was no seats left at the concert so we stood. To be frank even all of this we were willing to forgive and forget. Like I say we all waited tables and we all were new at some point.  When we came back to settle up (since we didn't have time left for them to straighten out all the bill mistakes before the concert) no concern at all was shown by the management. No apologies, no offer of desert and coffee for our party of 10. No coupons, NADA, not even an apology! That is UNFORGIVABLE. It shows ( along with the waiters inept training) that they do not care. Also seeing no responses to these reviews shows the same thing. Owners and management could care less and I would highly recommend you going elsewhere.

This relies on a very simple solution, without argument. I called to complain and was greeted with attitude and unprofessionalism. They argued over such a SIMPLE solution. The girl denied forgetting anything and assured me that it was in the MULTIPLE paper bags they shoved in. I triple checked every bag before I called, because I really don't enjoy speaking to these people for these exact reasons. This isn't the first time. So, she put some guy on the phone who rudely questioned my issue and become confrontational about MY attitude. I had every right, you arrogant prick. I quickly returned the attitude. And with that, a simple refund of $3 was given. And the delivery service they use is horrendous. They get lost and show up really late most of the time. It's completely abhorred.

2015-12-30,1.0,"My family and I have been ordering Leona's delivery since I was in elementary school and I'm 22 now.. I guess it was naive of me to expect the quality to stay the same. Firstly, I was ordering online to get their 15% off discount. It took much adversity to even make it to check out as their website is not user-friendly in the slightest bit and navigating the website took a lot of guessing and clicks to get to where I wanted. But alas, I stuck through and reaped the benefits. We got: -Calamari: our calamari was a bit soggy and overall not the right texture you would want calamari to be.. Pass.. -1/2 rack of ribs: the meat was a bit dry, needed to slather on a lot of the extra BBQ sauce they provided -Spaghetti with marinara sauce: this was the biggest disappointment for me as I've always been a fan of their angel hair marinara. However, this spaghetti was the only thing remotely similar, so we opted for this option. It tasted like any spaghetti you could make at home with Ragu sauce. -Bacon cheddar burger with a side of potato wedge fries: the fries were soggy and definitely undercooked. The bacon cheddar burger was dry and just bleh.. -bleu cheese burger (forgot the name): same deal as the bacon cheddar burger in terms of meat. I couldn't even taste the bleu cheese, but definitely over killed my burger with onions and mushrooms. Overall, the food is nothing special and overpriced.. My total came out to be ~$58 without tip, but I would rather have spent a little bit more for way better food quality.

2015-12-22,2.0,"I want so bad for this place to get it together. It's local it's beautiful inside, the new owners mean well - but still uugh! So we have been in 3 times since new owners (summer 2015), and the experience has varied each time. We had stopped eating at this location years ago due to bad service and constant order mishaps. We tried it again this summer as it was close and had free parking.  1st time back we were made aware of new management by the staff - no mention of it anywhere in the area, not on Yelp, the building or any mailings to the area (I am always searching for new business to patron in our area). Anyways we were surprised and hoped for the best. That experience was good. Pizza was really good, calamari to die for. Cheesestick's were massive, too much actually not sure we will order them again. Cheese was good the amount was too much for one stick. Price was average for a sit down restaurant.   2nd time order was wrong and wait time was so lllloooonnng! Only to find the order was wrong - pizza was not 16in as we ordered it was put in as 12in. so disappointed. Server apologized over and over and we felt bad it happens. However disappointed just the same but the 12in was good we just wanted left overs and that did not happen. We decided based on the time we already waited we did not want to wait for a new pizza.  3rd time (last week) we had family over and this was the only place with a parking lot (suburban family does not do well with street parking). It turns out they offer half price pizza on Tuesday I think,  it was not advertised anywhere except the restaurant - they should advertise that. I live 6 blocks away never received a single menu or anything from this location. It is always 90% or more empty - advertise that business Leona's. Its your only hope! Get a better flow with your servers and kitchen going - its is way to long to get food on the table even drinks take at least 10 mins. Also your soda's are flat talk to your vendor. A little heat would be nice as well - it was freezing when we went in there on a nearly 55 degree day. We want to see you prosper you are the only sit down restaurant in the area with variety - we want to see you stay. Get a consultant and a marketing plan in place - you cannot survive this way.

When the server plopped the pizza down on the table we both looked at it as if an alien had landed. ""I thought we had ordered a thin crust"" I told the guy. ""This is thin crust."" he said with a smile. The pizza presented was at least three times as thick as it should be. At the outer crust it was puffy and the sauce and ingredients stopped about an inch from the edge. When I took a square and bit into it, it was obvious that this was a frozen pizza. It was awful. Worst thing about this visit to Leona's is that I brought a friend from New York. New Yorkers are horribly smug about that slimy street food they call pizza.

2014-07-08,1.0,"My husband and I were returning from a stroll yesterday evening and were about to go home to eat leftovers.  We live very close to Leonas, and upon walking up to it, decided to go in and do their half price pizza.  We were seated immediately, in a booth in the back back corner and were told our server would be right with us.        15 minutes later a server showed up and without saying any stood in front of our table with his order pad out looking at us expectantly.  okay....so we order.  5 minutes rolls by before our drinks (a pepsi and a lemonade, nothing complicated) arrive, and 20 minutes after that our appetizer arrives.  Except it's not what we ordered.  But we need to wait another 5 minutes because the server put it down and ran away.  When we finally flag him down, he goes through his order pad, says he needs to think, and then complains that this is what happens when tables get sat and no one tells the servers and just expects them to be mind readers.  okay.....       So 45 minutes after sitting down we still only have drinks.  Our correct appetizer arrives within about 5 minutes this time, and when it did, my husband was in the middle of a story and didn't see the server.  Who stood there hovering with the food until he had our full attention.  odd.        At 60 minutes into our meal, our pizza arrives. I wish I could say it was worth the wait.  They clearly use frozen, pre made crusts so it basically is the equivalent to those pizza squares you might get in the frozen good section.  We eat a bit, then wait another 5 minutes to flag someone down (mind you, we were actively trying to flag anyone down).  When we ask for the check and to get our food wrapped, our server grabs the food and walks off...except literally above my head behind our booth was a bunch of take away boxes.  And a micros.  Not sure where he went that time, but it took another 7 minutes to get our check and finally pay and get out of there.        So a decision to drop in and have a quick bite at our neighborhood restaurant ultimately took over an hour and a half and was pretty awful.  Bad decision on our part.  Unfortunate situation for our neighborhood.  We like to support local businesses, and this one is so close and has a great patio, but this is not the first time we've had terrible service and just an overall bad experience.  I remember not too long ago (I've only lived here for 5 years) where the service was impeccable, the manager would always check in on you, where your drink was never empty and you never had to wait a long time to be given the opportunity to ask for something.  This for sure was, sadly, the very last time we go to Leonas.  The menu is blah, the service is terrible, and the prices are nothing special.  It would be nice if a great family restaurant would take over that space and really be a gem for the neighborhood, but unfortunately I don't see that happening.

We were in good spirits but the place was fairly empty.   We ordered a 14"" thin crust with Italian sausage and artichokes; I had casually said I like lots of artichokes. The pizza was just ok, maybe not as good as in the past, and the waiter was nice enough. Especially since he brought a nice glass of several lemon wedges for our water, which we take without ice. Usually we get the ice water even when we stress we want water with NO ice. So that was quite considerate of the waiter. However, the bill showed a charge for a 16"" pizza with a double order of artichokes with no 1/2 price off on the pizza! After pointing these out to the waiter he corrected for the 1/2 price but not for the size or the extra artichokes which he didn't tell us he'd charge us for. We went to the register to pay and advised the waiter who promptly got his manager who said (pointing to the waiter): ""He never makes mistakes"".  Well, my friend got a bit loud and angry to be (indirectly) called a liar.  After calming him down a bit we left at 6:45pm, even leaving a tip!

Yah right.  Use to enjoy, not love, enjoy their pizza.  The one that was delivered to me was semi-cold and soggy.  Wasted $38 dollars for dinner.  Who ever made these changes at this restaurant, I think you put the nail in the coffin.  Was a great place to dine in the area.  Time to move on.  Too pricey, little options, food quality has suffered also.

I've dined there years ago and was not impressed, but recently my husband ordered pizza (and more) and it was the best god***ned chicken alfredo pizza ever! The ""and more"" consisted of lasagna and baked mac n cheese. The mac n cheese was good. I liked the texture, which was similar to the lasagna's (like a casserole), but I wished the cheese flavor jumped out more. Dare I say, bland-ish? The lasagna was a pleasant surprise, though I think I did enjoy it more the next day.  We also tried the fried catfish. A resounding ""meh."" I'd say don't bother. After having Hecky's fried catfish or even Fish Keg's (which are better values), my standards are high and Leona's simply could not fill the aforementioned shoes.  The house made Italian bread that accompanied the pastas was yum, Yum, YUM! The perfect crusty, chewy outside and soft inside. I froze one of the loaves and took it out a week later to eat with dinner. Just as good as the day we'd gotten it.  Once again, the hub paid and didn't disclose the bill, but after perusing their online menu, I can see he paid an arm and a leg for what I considered over all, just okay.

Con: Well, there is only one pro in my eyes... I believe the crust is made from brown rice. I have no idea of whether there is a dedicated oven strictly for baking this type of pizza, so please inquire or be forewarned if necessary.  The crust is prepared thin, and is quite crisp without being overly-crunchy.  Beyond this pizza, nothing stands out about the entrees offered here, nor the ambiance or service. I have sampled almost all of their other dishes, and while nothing was sent back, I definitely would not order anything other than the pizza.  Mentioning the wine list is pointless as it contains just figurehead bottles to say that they have them. Did have surprisingly decent Manhattans and Dry Martinis here.  This seems like a place where you either go because 1) it is convenient, 2) you have children and need a family-oriented place with a variety of menu options, 3) there is a dish they prepare that you cannot find anywhere else, or 4) you just want reliable food with no frills and no surprises.  If they take the GF pizza off of the menu, I do not see a need to return--except, of course, if I am with someone who needs to order a pizza with soy cheese (a recipe which they hit out of the park--one of the more ""realistic"" soy cheeses I have ever tasted, and I have been through the majority of them--and almost all commercially available options).",0.8999,0.898,0.077,0.025,0.5104166666666666

The interior of the restaurant was very nice~For being such a big restaurant, it still felt very cozy and I really appreciated how accommodating the restaurant staff were for our big group. The service was very good.  My friend and I shared a chicken pesto pizza. I feel that I had a less than spectacular experience at this restaurant in terms of the food because of how big our group was. My pizza arrived lukewarm as if it had been sitting out for a while. The pesto flavor on the pizza was good, but the pizza was ruined by the dry chicken and the hard, dry crust. Another friend next to me ordered pretzel bun sliders and did not finish his dish because of how dry the bun was and rubbery the meat was. The price was pretty reasonable for the amount of food that came with each order.  Overall, I feel my dining experience was affected by the huge group that I went with. Before this time, I've only heard positive reviews of this place. I would recommend going with a smaller group of people. The menu is very diverse, and I thought it was interesting how there were options for vegans as well. It seems to be a very good place for families.",0.9876,0.806,0.165,0.029,0.5281111111111111

Everything was great until the food came out. Then the waitress made it clear through subtle cues she wanted us out of the restaurant as one of the last tables (this was at 10, a full hour before the restaurant even officially closes). She brought me a nearly overflowing diet coke and asked if that would be the last one I'd like. Then her male companion started tag teaming the table. Then two guys, either from the waitstaff or kitchen were literally a few feet back from our booth, *watching us* eat and I overheard one say ""I'll get them out of here right now if you'd like"" referring to us and her desire to leave and go home. The waitress applied more pressure while I was still eating asking if I wanted other left overs wrapped up. I was still eating what was on my plate and had a mouthful of food when she did this. She then made a scene of wrapping up our table and pushing us along when the credit card slips came back. It was 10:25. Don't advertise you are open until 11 if you aren't open until 11. I was having a good conversation and your restaurant wrecked it due to all the staff shenanigans. It's not like we rolled in at 10:30 and you started pressuring us at 11:15.

Anyways, I was a fan of being sat near there. They have a large, enclosed children's room with 7 TVs and toys.  You can set the kids free in there and watch them through the windows.  Well, not my baby, but I look forward to the day when I can observe him through the glass double doors and sip a Chardonnay while he watches Scooby Doo on the big screen.  As it was, I went in there with him while he crawled around the other kids entranced by the movie.  There's a few bead roller coasters there for the infants and that was a welcome distraction while we waited for our entrees. The food is awesome.  Maybe I'm slightly biased because we had our wedding rehearsal dinner at the location in Wicker Park but I love the food.  Tonight I had the Parmesan Crusted Chicken Romano with a side of 5 cheese lasagna and mac and cheese.  It was enough for me to eat half of and take the rest home for dinner tomorrow.     Our waiter was attentive and friendly.  No complaints there.   If I could change one thing, it would be that I would tell the parents that were seated in the area to curb their spawn.  Some were in the kid's area throwing toys and acting like maniacs.  However, I suspect that my karma is coming and I will be one of those parents who turns a blind eye to the toy violence in favor of enjoying a kid free appetizer/cocktail.",0.9654,0.755,0.152,0.094,0.4536630036630036

I asked for normal butter instead of butter with chives and the guy says, ""That's just garlic butter."" I know. With chives in it. We were really disappointed.

The portions at Leona's are very generous.  I got the Romano Crusted Chicken Parmigiana with sides of chicken noodle soup and spaghettini with marinara, and I definitely couldn't finish it all (luckily my husband could).  The marinara sauce was great--I just wish there was more of it on the chicken.  We also got some appetizers: calamari, bruschetta, and tiger shrimp.  Everything was fresh and tasted great and there were no complaints from the group on the food. We did have a bit of a problem with our service, however.  We got to the restaurant right at 11:30 a.m., when they open, and were seated right away.  It took our server awhile to come over to the table, and then it ended up taking him 10 minutes to bring everyone's drinks once we had ordered.  Each course seemed to come painfully slowly, and at one point, he took back some food to box it up and didn't bring it back until long after we had gotten the check.  Meanwhile, he also had a bit of an attitude.  We weren't in a hurry that day, but it would have been nice to have quicker service. All in all, Leona's is a great option when you are really hungry for a good Italian-style (or even non Italian-style meal).  Hopefully the service we received at the N Sheridan location was just a fluke and not indicative of that restaurant overall.",0.9852,0.818,0.137,0.045,0.4905238095238096

2009-09-05,1.0,"I had a frustrating experience trying to place a delivery order tonight. This is not my normal first choice for ordering in pizza but they had sent me a coupon in the mail for $5 off a delivery or carry out order so I thought I would try Leona's for a change and save a few bucks. Using the coupon is what caused most but not all of my frustration. First I tried to call and the person who picked up the phone said hold please and then I got disconnected. I know that is bound to happen on a busy Saturday night so I was undaunted and decided to try to order on-line. After going through the registration process I put in my order but at the point of check out I couldn't figure out how to apply the $5 off coupon and also only had the option of paying by credit card which I don't like to do for a pizza. So I decided to try calling again. I placed my order and then at the end told the order taker that I had a ""Gift Card"" (which is what the coupon was called in bold print) for $5 off. She said that it could not be used ""over the phone"" but I pointed out that it said that it was for delivery or carry-out so I didn't understand how it couldn't be used over the phone. She politely but unsolicited by me said she'd get her manager to talk me about it. About 3 minutes later, a different person got on the phone and asked me how he could help. I explained the prior discussion and added that maybe I should have used the word coupon with the prior person event though what they had sent me in the mail was labelled as a Gift Card. This 2nd person said I could only use the coupon for dining in. I again said it was for use on deliveries/carry- outs but since they were not going to let me use it, I just wanted him to cancel my order. He said he'd have to get a manager to talk to me. This is when I began to be frustrated because I thought I was talking to a manager. So a third person got on the phone with me and I explained the prior two conversations and that at this point I just want to cancel my order because I was having a very bad customer service experience. It took me over 3 minutes of telling this manager to cancel my order before he finally did. He kept telling me to give them another chance and not to cancel the order. He did offer to comp dessert for me and honor the coupon (which to me wasn't a big concession since they should have done that to begin with) but even if he had offered to but my whole dinner, I didn't want to do business with them at this point. The absolute most frustrating part is how many times I had to tell this manager to cancel my order before he finally did what I asked.

It seems odd to me that it took that long to figure that out, but I took a few minutes and found something else.

And because of that alone, I will order from them again. It's important for both people ordering to have choices and being a vegetarian, I often get the shaft when it comes to take out menus.  However, there were lots of choices like the lasagna, ravioli, and many other pasta dishes, salads, wraps etc. I opted for the giant vegan burger because it was made there and let me pick two toppings of my choice to have on the burger which was a tasty option and makes for the opportunity to have a slightly different burger every time you order. I ordered cheddar cheese and grilled onions and it was very yummy!  I got to choose one side and of course, that meant I had to choose the wedge fries! And I was so very glad I did. They were so good, I could have had a double serving of them. But I know that would have been a no no and one serving was plenty. They had lots of great flavor and were actually still warm and the skin was still crisp by the time I got them. The veggie burger itself was HUGE and has similar seasoning to stuffing I think.

2008-06-04,4.0,"I've been a fan of Leona's for a very very long time.  I honestly have to admit that I miss their deep dish pizza.  It was my favorite for years.  It beat out Pequod's, which is my current ""sacred cow,"" entirely because of the corn bread crust and sauce.  When they discontinued it in 2003, I was crest-fallen.  I found out about this defeat the day of the ""Bartman incident"" and was left heart broken, not only by the Cubbies' loss, but also by the deep dish's replacement, the Sicilian style pizza.  Was not a fan. They've also recently discontinued my other favorite, the steak sandwich and replaced it with the less-than-amazing steak skewer sandwich.  Again, not a fan.   It's saving grace is the quality of food and that they use non-hormonally treated meat.  They also have a lot of veggie/vegan options for my hippie-punk friends.   The best kept secret at this Leona's location is their Sunday brunch buffet.  We go there with my folks once a month for brunch, and it's a good mix of all of their classics.  The omelette's bar is good, but the French toast is not.   Their desert menu is really great too.  I'm a sucker for their huge chocolate cake.  There's a reason I'm chubby and it's totally caused by my sweet tooth. Some people complain about the service, but let's look at it this way.  The Rogers Park location is located near Loyola University.  Anyone who has spent any amount of time near Loyola knows that there's a large jack-ass quotient at that school.  Would you be an awesome, out going server to everyone if you had to deal with these kids (and many times, worse, their parents)?  I think not.  I've witnessed many many waiters and waitresses have tables of very rude and over-demanding Loyola families, so cut them some slack.  Be polite to them and leave them a nice tip, because they're probably getting shafted by big party a couple tables over. Personally, I've never had a problem with the wait staff, but I'm generally pretty nice to them.  They're handling your food after all. The only reason they lost a star is the discontinuation of my two favorite dishes.  Go here for everything, except pizza.",0.9945,0.745,0.183,0.073,0.5876887340301976

2008-05-17,3.0,"I came here for my nephew's first Communion reception luncheon. We had a reservation for 16, as did another kid from his class, though their party was even bigger. We arrived around noon and I must say they have no shortage of parking, which is exceptionally good for Rogers Park. The inside of Leona's looks really nice. The interior looks sophisticated and spacious. A large-screen TV kept playing classic 80s music videos of Lionel Richie, Phil Collins and Michael Jackson even. It was retro-cool to see them. What keeps me from giving them a higher rating is their service. The 2 parties had just 1 waitress and she seemed overwhelmed, though she tried to be prompt with our requests. I would have expected them to be better staffed for a party. At first, we only had 4 menus at our table and some of us didn't even see the food choices when she came to take our orders. Then she got the menus to all of us, but the kids menu is a separate booklet. So then she took a few minutes to get those menus. As the natives got restless, she came back with 1 menu/activity booklet less than there were kids. So she had to find one more. I felt the place was skimping on service in that respect. Anyway, the kids got a thin crust cheese Leona's ""World-class pizza"" as the menu states. They ate it OK, but in my opinion the crust seemed too leathery - not close to world class at all. It can't compete with Moretti's or Marie's thin crust in my opinion. Heck, I can make a better one at home myself. On the other hand, I liked their sliced garlic bread and the complimentary loaf of bread with herb butter.  I ordered the five cheese ravioli. It was buried in a very flavorful marinara sauce, but the ravioli itself seemed underfilled and a bit droopy. I liked the chicken soup included with the meal, but ""hearty vegetable-noodle chicken"" would have been a better description. There is a Children's Theatre in the restaurant. Basically, it's an adjoining room that shows kids' movies and has some floor mats. It's a good place for kids to go when they get bored after a meal and run around till they drop, or till the bigger kids slam the little kids into the walls. Best of all, since the room is dark and pretty soundproof to the outside, all the noise and mayhem is contained inside. So in short, it's not a bad place, but it did not strike me as someplace impressive either.",0.9953,0.807,0.157,0.036,0.5576754385964913

The food can be quite good.  Their deep dish pizza is tasty, but a little weird, in my opinion --very bready and unusual; their french fries w/ blue cheese, Alfredo sauce, bruschetta toppings, etc. are to die for (and will probably kill you in the long run, for that matter); their salads are good when made w/ fresh lettuce; and their raspberry lemonade is incredible.  They have a HUGE menu and their veggie options are plentiful, which I really appreciate.   So what's the problem?  Sometimes their food is not that good.  More importantly, sometimes their management is not that good either.  In fact, we had a salad there the last time we were there and it had brown lettuce in it.  Yuck.  The manager there (during the day) was great -- he comped it and apologized.  When my husband and I were there a few weeks before that, he commented to the manager that he didn't really like the olives on the salad -- more an observation than anything (the man had not really had canned olives before (I don't know how this is the case, but I'm sure he's better off that way) so he couldn't understand why the black olives in the salad didn't taste like Kalamata olives) and that manager (night time) looked at him like he had two heads and made us both very uncomfortable.  It was not a great experience and it made us feel like we were not actually welcome to comment on our experience there to the manager unless we had only positive things to say. Additionally, while the restaurant has a pleasant, cozy atmosphere, there is the unfortunate fact that there is a bathroom smell that pervades the place.  It is particularly noticeable by the front door.  However, the last time I was there, I could smell it in the dining room.  It kind of put a damper on my appetite.  Needless to say, given my experience with the crabby manager, I won't be making any recommendation to them to do something about the stink!  (For the record, the smell is one of a sewery and cleaning solution smell -- not what you're thinking, perhaps.) So, in short, I'm not sure if we'll be going back there.  It's too weird and potentially unpleasant.  Whenever I ask my husband if he wants to go out to dinner lately, he says, ""sure -- anywhere but Leona's.""  And he's usually the more forgiving one!",0.9803,0.762,0.142,0.095,0.5704254079254079

They have their own parking lot on the south side of the restaurant-which is hard to see, usually until you pass it if you are coming northbound.  You may find parking on Sheridan or some of the sidestreets.  Really good place to take a bunch of people since the menu is so varied.  I come up here all the time but haven't been to the other locations yet.  They have a calendar with coupons they will send you if you get on their mailing list--I recommend doing so, deals are pretty good!",0.9748,0.853,0.124,0.023,0.587591575091575
2005-10-09,3.0,"This branch is a decent stop. Its always empty..so expect no waits. The service is okay; don't expect your server to be extra corteous or attentive. The food is pretty expensive, but the portions are huge. I've had their grilled garlic shrimp and they were pretty good. Overall, a good place to go eat, but you can probably do better for the money spent.",0.9645,0.675,0.285,0.041,0.582051282051282
2005-10-06,2.0,"I'm not sure what all the hype is about this place.  I find the food mediocre and overpriced for what they provide.  There are so many wonderful restaurants in this neighborhood, so I would suggest going elsewhere.",0.4618,0.847,0.102,0.05,0.8472222222222222
2005-09-13,1.0,I'm sorry but I don't trust any restaurant with this much stuff on the menu. Leona's is gross. I've only eaten there once and it was pasta and the thought of it now makes me want to throw up in my mouth.,-0.8128,0.782,0.031,0.187,0.55

2005-07-23,5.0,"I'm partial to the fried shrimp, cheeseburgers and pretty much anything else that I don't necessarily have to go to Leona's to get.  But these dishes are ESPECIALLY tasy at this restaurant!   Unfortunately, I can't go often due to the prices.  Delivery fees are insane.   The delivery man usually has an attitude about having to come all the way to Evanston to bring me food.",-0.2942,0.875,0.047,0.079,0.6805555555555556
