2009-04-10,5.0,"Being Top Chef fans, my husband and I were extremely excited to hear about Dine with Dale.  I immediately checked the calendar to find a date when we could make the 3 hour trek to Chicago for the experience and I emailed the lounge asking to make dinner reservations.  Received a confirmation that we were set for the evening of 4/9. Honestly, when I checked the menu that morning, I had some real concerns about making the trip (and spending the money on gas & a hotel, etc).  Amuse:  Brie Apple & Pecan Quesadilla.      Entree:  Turkey Pork Meatballs with Spinach Pesto & Garden Veggies.  Dessert:  Milk Chocolate Mango Parfait.  I was worried about the strange combination of ingredients in the Amuse/Dessert, and the Entree seemed a bit plain/boring for such an event.  Luckily my husband was really looking forward to this, so I tried to stay optimistic and we went.  The Relax Lounge was a nice little bar/restaurant with a pleasant atmosphere.  We arrived a few minutes early and had a seat at the bar for a drink. Once we were seated, the waitress stopped to make sure that we didn't need any additional beverages and answer any questions about the menu.  The waitress/waiters who attended to us get 10 stars.  Our water glasses were never empty.   A quick disclaimer: I like great food, but my experience with ""gourmet meals"" is limited and I have an uneducated pallet. I tend to pick safe (my husband would say boring) foods when ordering from a menu. That said, here is my take on the evenings meal.  The Brie Apple Pecan Quesadilla was not really to my liking. It was grilled and had a smokey flavor which I found to be a little overwhelming. I typically am not a fan of anything smoked, but my husband was very pleased with it -- he finished both of our servings.  The turkey pork meatballs with spinach pesto and garden veggies was anything but plain/boring!  The meatballs were seasoned perfectly and the garden veggies with the spinach pesto made the meal.  This is something I would never have ordered off of a menu but I am hoping that Dale will have it on the Town & Country menu because I can't wait to have it again. I'll be looking for a recipe to try at home, too. The dessert, milk chocolate mango parfait, was served a mango soda.  I've never completely understood why this is sometimes done, but I do now.  The sweet parfait followed by the tart mango soda was a perfect combination. This is also something that I would be very happy to order again. Dale did make a brief appearance at the end of the meal.  He stopped at each table to say hello and even took pictures with a few of the diners (Hubby forgot our camera). When we complimented the terrific flavor of the turkey pork meatballs, he shared that he had reservations about putting it on the menu because it seemed plain/boring (hmm... don't know who would ever think that.) but he knew the taste would win people over.  I wanted to ask for the recipe, but figured that was a big ""no, no"" so I refrained (although, I do plan to do some digging on-line to find something similar).   The meal was absolutely wonderful!  We are already making plans to return to Chicago in June to enjoy Dale's cooking again.",0.9973,0.829,0.146,0.024,0.5798738298738297
