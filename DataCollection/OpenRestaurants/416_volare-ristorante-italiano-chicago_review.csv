When you see even the owner helping out, you can tell everyone is invested in getting people served and to keep everything flowing. The food was excellent!

You can tell the dressing is freshly made and the croutons are so so good. I also had a mango martini that was out of this world! Highly recommend!  For my entree, I got the gnocchi in vodka sauce and my grandmother got the ravioli. BY FAR THE BEST GNOCCHI AND VODKA SAUCE I'VE EVER HAD. The gnocchi is fluffy and cheesy tasting. The vodka sauce is creamy but not artificial. The ravioli were also delicious.  The prices were definitely reasonable! My only qualm was that I wanted to add shrimp to my gnocchi and each small shrimp was $2. Seems a bit pricey for each shrimp. But still tasty. I'd probably not add the shrimp next time though.

2017-07-22,4.0,"Volare is a nice little restaurant in Chicago.  We went there based on the Yelp reviews and the recommendation of the front  desk clerk at the nearby hotel that we stayed in.  After making reservations, we started our ""short"" walk from our hotel.  20 minutes of walking, and we were there.  The lobby was packed and more people were arriving.   We were seated promptly.  Unfortunately, the table that they gave us was right next to the entrance and very dark.  My wife objected as we could not see the menu.  They immediately moved us as soon as a table opened up minutes later. We ordered their Fettucine alla Bolognese, Rigatoni all' Arrabbiata, and a Linguine Arselle e Bottarga.  The food was good!  The Rigatoni came in a spicy tomato sauce with Pancetta in it.  I liked the spiciness of the dish.  My daughter and I liked the Fettucine alla Bolognese.  It had lots of meat in it.  The sauce was perfect.  The Linguine was basically a linguine with clams.  My wife liked it.  Unfortunately, it was too dark in there for my camera to take good pictures without using my flash and blinding all the other customers.   The food was good.  The service was good. One of the managers there even hailed a cab for us after we finished dinner so that we wouldn't have to take the 20 minute walk back to the hotel.",0.9719,0.86,0.12,0.019,0.5681292517006802

Our service wasn't great and I felt like either the server was too busy to take care of us or put his priority on other tables. The support staff was beyond incredible though. Splurged for the Chilean sea bass special and the fish was wayyyy better than my veal in lemon sauce. They say that the proteins come with sides but it was just two potato croquettes and some steamed broccoli so if you want sides, order sides. (We went the four-course route of app, salad, primi, and secondi and only spent $150!) There is better Italian in Chicago to be had.",0.9717,0.76,0.198,0.042,0.5716517857142857

However, I echo several other reviewers that the host service needs improving and consistency in courtesy. Today, my husband called ahead and was told the wait was 5 to 10 minutes. When we arrived, he went to the host stand but it took a while for someone to greet him (after 2 of the hostesses just glanced at him and said nothing). When we were that told that the wait was about 30 minutes, my husband mentioned the call he made 5 minutes ago but one hostess flatly replied ""25 to 30 minutes"" (mind you, we got there before the dinner rush). As we were walking out to wait, an older sharply dressed man (the owner I believe) redirected us inside and showed us to an open table. After that, we had a delicious dinner and our waiter was fantastic.

The Gnocci a la Vodka is melt-in-your-mouth delicious, and the portions are just right. It's my absolute favorite dish and it was perfection.  Volare is a solid 5 stars.

2017-06-19,2.0,"My husband and I dined here with a friend on Sunday night. We frequently order takeout or delivery from Volare, but this time we decided to dine in. We had a reservation at 8:15, well after peak hours for a Sunday dinner, and were seated within 10 minutes of our reservation time. We were observing Ramadan and were literally starving, not having eaten since 3:30 AM. We received our appetizers and beverages in a timely manner, but our friend did have to ask the wait staff to bring us the complimentary bread the first time. I would have expected it would automatically be served immediately after our water glasses were filled. Once we were done with the first batch of bread, the wait staff asked if we wanted more bread. We said yes because we were literally starving all day. However the next batch of bread didn't come until right before our main entrees came, which was pointless. Our main entrees took forever to arrive! I believe we placed our order around 8:30, and we didn't receive our entrees for at least an hour after our reservation time. We asked our waiter a couple of times for the status of our food. The restaurant was not busy at the time. In our section, less than half the tables were occupied while we were waiting for our main entrees. We ordered a couple of chicken parmesans and a margherita pizza, so nothing fancy. There was no explanation as to why there was such a delay. We have all dined at Volare before and the service was much quicker before.  Our friend was served his dish by a gentleman who appeared to be a manager because he was wearing a suit. The gentleman made a comment along the lines of ""Did you think the chef wasn't going to feed you? Of course he was going to feed you!"" and our friend took offense to that. We thought it was a very rude comment. Why wouldn't the chef feed us? We're paying for the food! This experience left a bad impression of the dine-in experience at Volare. I don't usually enjoy dining at Volare because the noise level is high, but I agreed to it on Sunday night because it wouldn't be as busy. We like the food at Volare because the pasta is handmade and very fresh, but there are also many other Italian restaurants in downtown Chicago with better service with similar food.  My husband and I used to dine at Volare for special occasions, but in 2014 they took his favorite dessert, the creme brulee, off the dessert menu, so we stopped dining at the restaurant regularly. Also in 2014, we had gone with some friends and ordered a seafood dish, and the shrimp was disgusting. I suppose it wasn't fresh, and being from Texas, I expect a certain quality of shrimp. This isn't a problem limited to only Volare in Chicago, as other downtown Chicago restaurants seem to have the same bad supply of shrimp, but I will never order any dish containing shrimp at Volare ever again. The cafeteria at my office has better quality shrimp! Also their meat sauces all contain pork, so I suppose if I want spaghetti with meat sauce, I will have to make it myself at home. That's unfortunate because I had been craving spaghetti with meat sauce, but I don't eat pork. Perhaps the service was slow because the restaurant wasn't busy and they weren't in a hurry to turn over tables. We don't plan to dine in at Volare again.",0.9716,0.824,0.107,0.069,0.4537592549294677
2017-06-18,5.0,We recently made a road trip to Chicago for a weekend getaway. Of the various things we did one of the major highs was visiting Volare. Let's start at the front door where you are warmly greeted by about 3 different people... LOL Walked to our table which was balanced which is a pet peeve of mine wobbly tables that is. We were given some of the best breead to chew on with wonderful olive oil and parmesan cheese. My husband ordered the black spaghetti with seafood in a red sauce which he still declares is the best pasta he has ever had!!! I ordered the Seafood Carbonara which was superb!!! After finishing half of our plates we bravely ordered the obligatory Tiramisu with a 10 year tawny port. The dessert was awesome but he real surprise was the port!

The atmosphere can be interpreted as a little more on the fancy side from the dim lighting (I actually saw someone use their phone's flashlight to look at the menu) and numerous utensils for each place setting on the table. There was a great variety of different dishes (pasta, pizza, risotto, etc) that range from about $15-$30. Might seem a little pricy, but I can vouch that the quality is definitely up to par. And the portions are very filling as well. Both my friend and I got pasta dishes and they were both delicious! Not to mention, the bread that comes to the table is also very good as well! As for dessert, I tried the tiramisu and it had a slight coffee flavor, not as strong as it usually is, which I really liked.  The service was really great as well. Our waiter was very attentive to our table even when it got busy during the dinner rush, and my water was filled every time I was low (and I drink tons of water, so they were consistently coming to our table every time which I very much appreciated!).

Most restaurants don't charge extra for that stuff. And I think the waitress should tell people when there are extra costs. I also went to this restaurant with a friend who got the ""special"" and it was $70!! Way more pricey than the rest of the menu and again I think they should've mentioned the price.

2017-01-07,5.0,"My brother, my cousin and I had planned on a dinner outing together and she picked Volare out of a few other, less traditional places we had in mind. We made a reservation for a Saturday at 5pm. Snagged some super convenient (albeit rare) parking nearby on Grand ave and hoofed it over to Volare. You can't miss the place from the street, it has a huge sign! The inside is perhaps a little smaller than it looks. It's got the classic white table cloths, a dark, dimly-lit atmosphere and a very nice Italian flare to it. We were charmingly greeted and shown to our table by a guy who I think was the owner.  I started with not a glass, but a ""quartino"" of house chianti. It was probably just under two full glasses, but only slightly more $ than a single glass; a good value. The chianti was perfecto! We started with an order of fried calamari. It was simple, just fried and served with a marinera sauce as well as a tomato-horseradish sauce. It was very good, but I've had better! For our entrees, we also kept it simple and just ordered one dinner each, suspecting the pastas would be a large portion, and we suspected correctly! My brother had gnocchi with vodka sauce, my cousin had the fish special of the evening, which was a fish similar to a sea bass over a spinach risotto with clams, and finally I had the well-known squid ink spaghetti with seafood. My brother's gnocchi was the textbook definition of perfect gnocchi. It was not potato gnocchi but rather ricotta based, which are far more rich. Couple this with an amazingly creamy vodka sauce, it was delizioso! My cousin was a little hesitant about what to get, and impulsively decided on the fish special after hearing our server explain it a couple times. It was a seabass-like fish (some kind of sole, maybe?) over a spinach risotto with cherry tomatoes and clams. I tried it and it was broiled perfectly, prepared simply (but nicely) and the risotto went well with it. My spaghetti neri al pesce I was also a little hesitant about, because while I enjoy seafood this was a lot of seafood in and on one plate. The dish surprised me though and wasn't nearly as fishy as I thought. The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente, the scallops and shrimp were great, and the crab blended right in. The sauce was incredibly rich and slightly acidic. I opted for some cannoli to-go. I thought they were good but I've had better. Our server's name was Fabio. He was great! Had a very thick Italian accent and made some thoughtful suggestions as well as got us everything we needed and checked up on us.  Overall our experience at Volare was fantastic. Can't think of anything that wasn't good, the service was on point, and the prices were appropriate for a restaurant with this high caliber of service and top quality food. It is more of a traditional Italian place, but everything is done perfectly.  Highly recommend. 5/5",0.999,0.768,0.217,0.015,0.5688361762615494

2016-12-10,4.0,"One of the few times I had not used Yelp to guide me to a restaurant when I'm on the road. In this particular case, it was combination of the afternoon temperature of 14 degrees and my hunger that caused me to stumble onto Volare. Being from Hawaii, I am not used to sub 60 degree whether so it probably had more to do with getting out of the cold that led me to this great spot.  Food: Even though I was pretty hungry I didn't want to have an overly large lunch as I was planning to have a great dinner on my last evening in town. Seated quickly at a high top, I had a few minutes to peruse what other Yelpers had to say about the offerings. I ended up going with a bowl of chowder and the Insalata Mediterranea. The soup and fresh bread really hit the spot in warming me up. The seafood salad was huge with large pieces of scallop, shrimp, calarmari, and octopus. The Octopus to me was what really stood out, cut in large rustic portions, grilled nicely, not chewy or tough, and with a wonderfully sweet flavor. There was lettuce under all that delicious grilled seafood..enough to provide some textural differences but the focus is squarely on the seafood. Service: I'd say pretty good service. It was lunch on a Thursday a little after 1 pm so while the restaurant wasn't packed, there was still a pretty decent sized lunch crowd. I was happy with the level of service and the dishes were timed pretty well. Atmosphere: Bustling Italian restaurant with a nice bar area, open kitchen with a pizza oven, it was a comfortable establishment for both small parties and large groups. Value: Pretty good value as my salad ($16) was  reasonably priced for the size and amount of seafood included. It was large enough to share with 3 or 4 people if ordered family style. Wish I could have tried more items but difficult to do when dining alone. Wide range of prices also available to fit many budgets. Overall: I was happy the cold drove me into Volare, I probably would have never found this gem if I my nose wasn't about to freeze off my face!  I'd love to return in the future to sample more of their offerings!",0.9978,0.756,0.217,0.027,0.5765343915343915

On to the food...my friend and I came here a couple weeks ago. I ordered the ravioli, which was good, albeit pretty heavy, and my friend ordered the squid ink pasta with seafood. He seemed to love it and ate the whole thing. I tried a bite and the squid ink flavor was too overpowering for me personally. We split 1/2 a bottle of wine that was good and the server was good about pouring that for us. Our waiter was a bit odd and didn't seem to understand our simple orders for some reason. I do like how you can get 1/2 orders of some of the dishes and of course that the pasta is freshly made.

The bruschetta in particular was very well done and fresh, they definitely served it almost immediately upon putting the tomatoes et al on top there was no sogginess there. The clam chowder was also really good, more spiced and not as thick as classic clam chowder but definitely much better for it. The mains were alright, the whitefish + prawns was quite solid, the black spaghetti with shrimp and scallops was unremarkable, the flavors were a bit muddled and every thing in a bite seemed to have the same texture. At the end of the meal I asked for a to go box for the remaining food, and it simply never came. We were handed the check and I asked if the box of leftovers was still coming, the waiter said he wasn't sure and he'd check with the bus boy that took the plate. When the waiter came back to take the credit card he didn't mention it, nor when he returned after running the card. I figured it was already thrown out at that point, and I wasn't too torn up about it, but not even getting a response when just 'He didn't hear you' would have sufficed was definitely a service failure. All in all, pretty good food. For being in River North the prices are pretty standard. You could probably do worse, and probably better.",0.9854,0.77,0.182,0.048,0.4551746031746032

Hostesses young but in control of this busy place and management constantly roving about, in tune with the pulse of each table. It is their observation and the attentiveness of the neighboring server Robbie that helped us to laugh and smile in between stiff interactions with our assigned server. Our Warm Kale Salad was divine. With bits of pancetta, pine nuts, cece beans, white beans and more. Unfortunately, our entrees came within minutes of the salad causing our food to be set on the side of the table. A manager did eventually observe this and took them back.  This brings me back to the server. From the start he pressured us to make decisions quickly coming back to our table twice although our menus were still up.  When I ordered the Black Spaghetti with seafood. He asked if I've ever had it? Did I know what Black Spaghetti is? A little practice on how to suggestively sell and inform guest without insulting them, I think is in order. My husband's Lasagne was meaty, cheesy and large. Yum-my! The Black Spaghetti was delicious, scallops perfectly tender although the shrimp a little tough. Thanks to Robbie we could order a glass of wine through her. As our server didn't have a habit of checking on us. Wasn't even aware of the many meals that came at once.

For dinner my fiancé ordered the gnocchi bolognese and I ordered the fettuccini with lamb meatball special. My dish was incredible. I rarely enjoy white sauce in pasta, but this dish was more of an oil base rather than a cream which hit my pallet perfectly. The lamb meatballs were a nice change of pace plentiful on the plate. My fiancé's gnocchi bolognese tasted great. Easily one of the best we have had. Antico Posto in Oak Brook is still our favorite gnocchi by far with their ricotta base.

Due to the stellar reviews here on my fave app, my boyfriend and I chose to try Volare instead of going to one of our usual Italian spots. I actually work on Michigan Avenue and always see it packed so I've been curious any way about the food.  Perhaps it's because we just took a trip to Rome but I wasn't impressed with the food here. Or maybe I didn't get the same chef that everyone else who had a great experience had. Or maybe we ordered the wrong things. Yes the portions are generous, but I would hope so for these prices. We ordered a meat plate ($14), Vongole al Forno ($14) and the Fusilloni al Ragu di Vitello ($20) and Spaghetti Neri al Pesce ($24). We also ordered a piece of Tiramisu to go since everyone raved about that (even those like Alex A. who hated everything else). Pictures are below. Pasta was super saucy and salty but no depth of favor. The Fusilloni was like a mushroom stroganoff and the black spaghetti was just that. Black colored spaghetti with seafood.  I am giving 3 stars because our server was nice. Not awesome. Just nice. Also for the generous portions. I hate when food is expensive and you're still hungry. That won't be the case here at Volare.

For the main, we ordered the special pasta which was a seafood linguine with clams, mussels, scallops, shrimp and calamari in a spicy tomato sauce. The sauce was fabulous, the scallop and shrimp were great. The pasta, however, was not fresh as I thought it would have been after reading some Yelp reviews. So that was a bit disappointing.  Portions were nice and big and we had to take both of our dishes home. The staff were very friendly and attentive from the moment we stepped into the restaurant.  I would recommend this place for a family affair or a quick dinner out with friends.",0.9262,0.831,0.118,0.051,0.631547619047619

The perfect amount of red pepper, garlic (take in mind I love garlic).  Their meatballs in all honesty I would say are very good, but in my opinion, missing something. Meatball get 4 stars.  But, Next to my favorite Italian restaurant (in NY), I do believe Volare is right there!

It was a late-ish dinner (8.30)and a small party of 2.  Seating was more than available, which was surprising for a place with such high rating.  That should have been my first warning to get out. Seated and ordered.  Took 15 minutes for bread, another 10 for balsamic vinegar, and parm never came.  Kinda sad when basics aren't available, but maybe too spoiled from nyc area. Ordered the hot octopus app (don't remember the full name) which was the best thing we got.  Only reason I didn't give this place 1 star.  Also got the rigatoni, which was so salty.  We were too tired to complain, so we mentioned it to our waitress instead of having it sent back.  Instead of appreciating the comment, she chose to treat us like crap afterwards.  Should have actually returned the food with such bad service (now really knowing to get out).  Also got the mussels, which were way too oily and way too much garlic.  At one point, I forgot it was mussels and not rubber in garlic sauce.   We then got the check (which came out the fastest) and paid with normal 18% tip.  Not worth it.  Definitely not coming back.",0.8903,0.794,0.13,0.076,0.4925

I was born & raised in Chicago, and like many people, I love ALL pizza. I approached the hostess, told her I had a party of 2. However, I asked if the pizzas come in slices, to which she responded no. I asked how many people one pizza serves, since I was with my boyfriend. She ignored me to say goodbye to their patrons. So I had to ask a few times, which I could still look past because we're in River North. Their inappropriately snooty manager kept interrupting me with patronizing attitude to ask what sort of pizza I was looking for, and if I wanted deep dish Chicago, I should go to Giordano's, because they only serve authentic Italian thin-crust pizza there. I told him I was from here, and I did not want Giordano's. This is a place that is categorized as $$, not $$$ or more. They offer takeout & delivery. Don't you dare assume I don't deserve to sit at your restaurant because I'm not white like 98% of the guests there, despite my perfect English (regardless of language, they should welcome guests of all ethnicities). Ladies were dressed in casual dresses, and men generally wore polos and khakis, yet there was a sign claiming a ""dress code."" Any restaurant should welcome business (my boyfriend and I were dressed appropriately to have dinner in the summer), and classy places would know that customer service is KEY.

2016-06-15,2.0,"This place is a real hit or miss, and it's mostly a miss. It's a loop restaurant that mostly caters to tourists and is cheaply priced, which probably explains the unusually high reviews. Here's what I had: * Bread and olive oil. The olive oil tasted rancid and vaguely watery. No thanks. * Tuna Salad. This is literally tuna straight out of a can -- it comes in huge, cold, chunks -- mixed with some tomatoes, beans, and vinegar. Inedible. I wouldn't serve this to my worst enemy. * Seafood platter: fried calamari/squid/shrimp/etc. Quality of the frying is highly variable. Served on a bed of lettuce. No sauces or spices. Boring. * Squid ink spaghetti: actually pretty good. The only worthwhile dish I had there.  I would give this place one star if not for the squid ink spaghetti.",-0.6597,0.754,0.105,0.141,0.635

I also USED to get delivery quite often because even with delivery their pasta was perfect el dente. I just received an order $40 worth of food (that included tax, tip and delivery) - When it arrived I was stunned. I thought it was half orders of everything (mind you I know their menu like the back of my hand). I email grub hub about my disappointment thinking they were ripping me off. Grub Hub got back to me immediately (they called the restaurant) and said they changed their menus recently. I then called the restaurant and they verified they cut lots of menu items in half 2 weeks ago. However, the price did not budge. Same price for half order. Disgusted.  I went back to my old orders on Grun Hub and dining in just to double check. Sad. On top of it, it appears the quality was also cut. Kales salad was almost all kale and brussel sprouts, maybe 20 white beans, 4 pancetta small pieces, and only 2 chickpeas - yes i counted.

Our bread looked like it had been eaten before it served to us. I didn't even touch it because it looked like it had been sitting out for so long.  On top of that the wait staff kept opening and shutting the door on the patio which let in so much cold air. One guy in particular would come in and literally do nothing walk out and walk back in.

Neither of us had admitted to each other we were fully grossed out at this point- neither of us liked my salad either (it was honestly slimy and the color of house insulation, like the pink panther threw up on my plate) but again wanting a romantic night I shrugged it off. When the entrees came (i ordered the veal Parmesan, he a chicken dish, and we also ordered papardele to share) I was instantly grossed out by presentation alone. An almost $40 veal dish that just looked like diner food- a huuuuge piece of meat absolutely covered in cheese, rather than a focus on quality ingredients. At this point we both admitted that this was one of the most hilariously bad restaurant experiences we'd ever had, only not that funny at $110 before taxes. We boxed 75% of our meals up, in case we get really desperate (I'd personally rather have Barilla and Classico but we figured we may eat.)  Afterwards, my boyfriend told me he was going to pop the question tonight but couldn't bare to have a proposal sullied by the worst meal of all time. I can't blame him, but wtf Volare, you guys must be paying for positive reviews because the food is just disgusting. Interestingly, unlike other posters we found service to be fine. Still, even my pathologically polite boyfriend even gave me the green light to tear this place down on Yelp; it was just that bad :(. Not even mediocre, which I would have not wasted my time posting over...actively yucky.",-0.9526,0.744,0.113,0.143,0.6458585858585859

The food and wine are all double the price they should be even for this neighborhood.  It took 2.5 hours for a piss poor dinner, a few block from where I live, please do not make the same mistake. Unreasonable wait times for everything, all overpriced by 100%, bland food, terrible atmosphere, and I was sick for the rest of the evening from the amount of butter and oil which they used in an attempt to drown out their lack of culinary ability at a level akin to the melting arctic glaciers. I would never, ever return to this restaurant or their suburban counterpart in Oak brook, interestingly the headquarters of McDonalds, which even more astonishingly enough has better quality food than this shame of a restaurant.  Volare is a horrid choice for anyone ever, and you should not eat at this restaurant or bring anyone out to this establishment unless you wanted to poison them for killing your first born child.

On one occasion, we asked to be reimbursed for the valet parking, after we had already waited 40 minutes past our reservation time, because we had purchased movie tickets and did not want to miss the show. The restaurant manager did not apologize for the delay and he was not willing to reimburse us for the valet parking. Instead, he seated us and said that we would be out in time for the show. However, it took forever to get our food and we ended up having to inhale our dinner to make it in time for the movie. Not a pleasant experience at all.

The black spaghetti was cooked perfectly and tosses in a hearty sage, brandy, and cream sauce. VERY GOOD! And yet again, I enjoyed other people's dishes more than my own...

It's a quaint little classic Italian style joint in the same way that all the Greektown restaurants (which I avoid like the plague) are quaint little classic Greek style joints. There is nothing wrong with keeping things traditional and old school...IF you do those things right. And Volare, like Greektown, just doesn't do 'em right.  The dishes are large and sound and look appealing enough as they're plated nicely. But they're basically tasteless. Carpaccio Manzo ($10) was meh. Go get Devon Seafood's brilliant beef carpaccio at their happy hour. My Salmone Al Forno ($23) and her Vitello Limone (that's veal, $24) were tasteless. Her veal cutlets were these scraggly little pounded down things with maybe a dousing of flour and a tasteless sauce. Perhaps that's karma for ordering a baby cow taken away from its mommy in its sad short life. Drinks and dessert were okay with the tiramisu standing out...it must be outsourced from somewheres (I'm talking like an Italian now) that cares about food. The limoncello martini done fuq'd me up too, which was necessary to endure this $115-before-tax-and-tip disaster. The cappuccino was lame. If they served this in Boston's North End, a little Italian grandma would chase them out with a broom. Server was an awesome, fairly fresh off the boat, Italian guy, didn't know these still existed. Refreshing. And menu prices were whole dollar amounts, not my HATED $XX.95 or $XX.99 crap that does not befit a restaurant of a certain caliber.

Everything was perfect from the service to the amazing food and I couldn't believe how reasonable the prices were for what we ordered. We shared a salad and a pizza and another appetizer and also had several cocktails and the bill was shockingly low for everything that we had. Even their soft, fluffy and moist bread they served while we were waiting for our food was amazing. They gave us freshly grated Parmesan cheese with it that we put in the oil and balsamic and it was so good we couldn't stop eating it. Their homemade lemoncello martini was delish too. We had a great time and the food was amazing but one of the things that really stood out to us the most was the really great attitude and work ethic of everyone there from the top down. The busboy was so nice and so hard-working he was just busting his ass all night. So was the server too. We watched him hand cut a large chicken into sections for a table at the table side and serve the side dishes from hot pans to their plates making an even split among them. Right then we were in love. The manager was even seating people running around, as they were busy, and still managed to make cutesy jokes to is every couple times he passed the table. after our meal I had to thank the owner who of course was there also running around working hard most the night. He was friendly and gracious and invited us to check out his steakhouse which we didn't get around to but we have must've stayed there for over two hours just loving being there and loving the food and the service and I would love to go back next time I'm in Chicago.",0.9972,0.759,0.21,0.031,0.5489002267573696

Pastas are great.  Have tried many of the main dishes in the past, usually just OK.  Hard to find decent steak at an Italian place that specializes in pastas.  This place is no exception.  They broil the steak so hard to control temperature.  My wife never learns, she orders the steak rare but the new York strip always comes out at least medium.  Service is nice.  My error in not notifying restaurant when making reservation that my 5 year old daughter was part of our group of 5.  They seated us at a high top table, probably staff should have recognized this pitfall. But my daughter is pretty experienced and did not have any issues.   Loud this evening, more than usual.  Group of middle aged mothers and their daughters were in table next to us.  Moms seemed to want to encourage daughters to be loud as they likely wanted to relive some youthful days. That was a bit annoying this evening but oh well.   Not my best experience this evening.  That was unfortunate as I took my friend from out of town to dinner for his birthday.  Have gone to this place at least 10 prior times when visiting Chicago.

2015-11-11,4.0,"I personally would want to give this restaurant 3 stars, but I am adding on a star for two reasons: my friend really liked it and our server Blanche. This meal was less than ideal. There was a couple sitting behind us that was arguing non-stop (well, she was just demeaning him non-stop while he said nothing in return). While one part of me was into the drama, the other was disturbed and just wanted a quiet meal with my friend. Oh well, this is not the restaurant's fault by any means; I guess I am just adding some detail to the setting. We both got glasses of wine and started off with a half order of calamari, which was plenty for both of us. It didn't taste as good as it looked, but we will overlook that for now. I wanted to order the Papardelle, but since my friend was getting that, I opted for Fettuccine Bolognese instead. Not a great choice on my end, and after a couple of bites, I do something I hardly ever do, but I requested to exchange my meal for something else. Our server Blanche was extremely understanding. She asked why, offered a solution, but when she realized that I simply didn't like it, she took it back and brought a menu for me to mull the alternatives. Of course, to make matters worse, I spill an entire glass of water while looking at the menu. Blanche, without batting an eye, quickly offers us another table. I am embarrassed to cause such a hassle, but she says, ""I want you to be comfortable."" I opt for something basic that wasn't on the menu, and she makes it happen. We order dessert: I forget the name, but a sort of mini lemon pie. It had a strange aftertaste that I wasn't accustomed to, but my friend really liked it.  So, all in all, the experience was less than perfect, but a good portion was not the restaurant's fault.

Ordered a bottle of wine, took two sips from glass when bug fell in to the glass. Mentioned this more than once to the waiter, and was ignored. I went inside and asked the hostess if we could be moved inside due to there being a bug inside my wine glass, and well as by my sliverware and waterglass. Was flat out told no by the restaurant manager who was at the hostess stand, because he was overbooked. (How this was my problem, I don't know.) Went back outside and told the waiter to cancel my order, was not asked why, or offered anything at all. Not even a complementary dessert. I had to tell the waiter that I wasn't going to pay for wine that I didn't even drink.  At one point a hostess (I believe, she didn't say), asked if everything was okay. Told her no, and that I could at least get a glass of wine in place of my ruined one, and comp the inital bottle of wine for us. She had to ""check with the owner first"". A waiter who was not serving us, did say sorry for the issue, and said that if he was able to do something he would have. (Only person working there who aplogized, or even offered, without being told to.)  Wine bottle was taken off of bill, but staff was still petty enough to charge me $4.00 for the salad.

The other dish was orders as a half order and when it came out I commented to the waitress that it seemed large for a half order. She then told us that we didn't order half... Although, our table heard it ordered as a half. She didn't offer to fix it and still charged us for the whole. Not surprisingly, half of it was left on the plate ;) I only had a few bites of my dining companion's dish, but I didn't care for it at all. Tasted way too fishy to me! He didn't care for it, either.

It was a restaurant we didn't plan to go to, but we ""winged"" it, and I'm glad we did.   My peer and I had just discussed that we prefer not to order pasta, but that we both appreciate an Italian menu with ample meat/fish selections. Voila, we were able to find that here.  In my experience,  it seems to be difficult to find both good food AND good service, simultaneously. Often, I am presented with one or the other. Yet, I was a happy camper during my lunch at Volare.  The hostess greeted us very warmly, with a smile. Also, our server (Nick), was very pleasant  and attentive. He approached us at appropriate times to take orders and to refill drinks. In addition, he was also very quick to acknowledge errors and correct them.  For instance, with a slight order mishap, he promptly and graciously offered complimentary wine for his mistake. It was also nice that he humored us and was willing to joke a little.  I appreciate that type of thing, so major brownie points for Nick. Food was good (we had veal and filet). Wine was good. Not such a fan of orange flavored things,  but otherwise I probably would have loved the cannoli. No complaints.

We decided on their Italian sausage appetizer, served in some sort of sausage broth with roasted peppers.  Super simple, but delicious.  Initially we were going to split a pasta for dinner, but we decided to each order our own pasta instead.  My wife had the ricotta stuffed gnocchi with a vodka sauce, and I went with their black spaghetti with shrimp, scallops, and crab.  The gnocchi a la vodka was very good, we both agreed.  My black spaghetti was awesome as well but my wife isn't a seafood person.   The service throughout dinner was great, we didn't have to ask for anything, plates were bussed quickly, and we were able to just enjoy a great meal and each others company.  Something you might expect from a restaurant like Volare, but the experience is always priceless.",0.9945,0.81,0.185,0.006,0.572152380952381

We called and made reservations at 9 pm which is the earliest that they had available. The lady that took the reservation was so rude over the phone. I took at as they were extremely busy (I should've just taken the hint that they're service was horrible from the start). We ended up there 15 minutes early and it was packed just how I imagined. The lady told us to get comfortable, get a drink and they would call us as soon as our table was ready. 9 came around still nothing. We did see them sitting people but they weren't calling us. At 9:05 I told my husband to go and check. They told him to give them a couple more minutes..in the meantime we asked for the menu. We were busy looking at the menu and talking about how our day went. When we realized there was barely people in the waiting area. 9:10 rolls around, 9:15, still nothing. We saw a family and two couples come in. We asked again and all they said was that they would have a table ready for us in a few minutes. Another couple comes in, they get asked if they have reservations, they said no. We see the family and one of the couples get seated. We started getting frustrated. 9:25 an old guy comes and gets the couple that had just walked in and seated them right away. I got pissed as soon as I saw this. I asked the lady if the old man was the manager or if I could speak to whoever was in charge. She told me that he was the owner. Wow!! An owner handling his business like that. I told her I wanted to talk to him immediately. She disappeared and he appeared out of nowhere taking us to a table that had been empty for quite some time. I had lost my appetite by that point. All I wanted was to give him a piece of my mind. He then proceeded to apologize saying that we had just been skipped through the system. Really?! It's not like we didn't ask multiple times about our table. After finally seating us down we still waited for our waitress 10 whole minutes. The old man kept on checking up on us and apologizing. He ended up giving us our whole meal for free. For that I give him props how he handled his mistake. What I can't forgive is how rude and disrespectful they were. Now, putting all that aside the food was mediocre. Not real Italian by any means. We tried various dishes since they were sent to us from the owner. We talked to one of the waiters who saw everything that happened. All he said was he would've never waited to long for a table and that we should've just gone to a steakhouse down the street but that he gave us props for our patience.  1. If you like rude customer service  2. Your reservations not being honored  3. Like feeling discriminated 4. Mediocre food Then by all means this is the place for you!

After a Yelp Elite event nearby, my friend and I wanted a full blown, let's get bloated and stuff our face with carbs type of meal. We chose Volare due to the great rating. When we approached the restaurant we saw two tables open on the outside patio. We walked inside and told the hostess we wanted an outside table. She said it would be a 15 minute wait for outside and an immediate sit down if we chose inside. My friend and I both looked around and then looked at each other in a confused dismay. There was no one waiting for a table. Dafaq? I told the hostess that and she said, ""let me see what I can do"". We were magically sat within a minute. I'm not sure why in the world she didn't want to sit us outside but her pushing inside tables on us was rude. As patrons, we want to sit where we want - understand that - and don't give us sh*t for our choices.  After being seated, it took us about 5 minutes to get menus and be greeted by our server - Rhonda. She noticed we were still wearing Yelp name tags and mentioned to me that she knows all about the app and the review system. I had forgotten to take off the name tag after the event so I did so immediately upon her telling me. Rhonda made recommendations accordingly.  We ordered bruschetta as an app which I most certainly recommend that you order. The bread was soft and fresh and the tomatoes were delicious.  For the main, I ordered the black squid pasta with seafood. My friend ordered the daily special of spinach and cheese stuffed ravioli. Both meals were amazing. Seriously, I've never been to Italy but I really do believe it may be as authentic as possible. The BEST Italian I've had in Chicago, hands down.  We ordered the tiramisu and pistachio gelato as well. Both were tasty as well but I'd choose the gelato over the tiramisu here which is weird for me.  Now, why the 2.5 stars, you ask? RHONDA, where in the world did you go? Frankly, the service here sucked! She disappeared throughout 90% of our meal, and it took 15 minutes for her to bring us the check. FIFTEEN minutes! She knew we were Yelpers and had even asked me at one point if we were going to review her! Is this how you earn a good rating, Rhonda? Showing your Houdini skills by disappearing for the duration of our meal (and desserts) isn't impressive at all, in fact, it's quite disappointing and infuriating! The food here is phenomenal. The people working here: not so much. I may go again one day but I will choose to sit at the bar to order where all eyes will be on me. But to sit at a table? NAH!  I'm torn with Volare.

BF ordered appetizer of Italian sausage with peppers with side of spaghetti with marinara. Portion size of sausage was disgustingly enormous. Enough sausage for party of 8.

Warm Kale Salad:  ***Warm kale, crispy garbanzo, crispy prosciutto, pancetta, brussel sprout leaves, shaved grana padano, red onions, white beans, citronette I really liked the salad except for the pancetta. It was a little hard pieces, and I think it would have tasted better if it was sliced/shaved on the salad. It tasted good, but it was hard to chew.  Gnocchi alla Vodka: ***Ricotta dumplings in vodka sauce I really liked the gnocchi, it seemed light and fluffy, however my aunt and sister complained that it wasn't 'soft' enough for them. The sauce definitely tasted the same as the squid ink pasta as below, which was disappointing because we wanted to try different flavors of pasta Spaghetti Neri al Pesce:  ***Black spaghetti tossed with shrimp, lump crab and scallops and sage in a brandy and cream rose sauce Bit disappointed because it was the same flavor as the Gnocchi.

Be sure to make reservations if you plan on coming to Volare because this place is packed... there was quite a wait when we arrived and when we left an hour and a half later! The good news is with our reservation we didn't have to wait long at all for our table to be ready.  We were seated in the front dining room and I loved the ambiance. It's a touch crowded but in the best possible way, eating at Volare has that classic Italian restaurant feel where everyone around you seems to be laughing and having fun while enjoying their meal. In addition to the great ambiance I also enjoyed our server. She admitted she was new but if she hadn't said that we never would've known. She was attentive, helpful, and did a great job describing the specials.  They have a wide beer, wine, and cocktail selection here (but no draft beer). My boyfriend went with a Two Brothers and I had the delicious Tex Mex cocktail. If you're a tequila or vodka fan don't leave Volare without ordering one of those, they're to die for!  When it came to our meal we opted to share because the menu had so much to offer. We started with a half order of baked clams and I have to say they were the best I've ever had. The sauce was delicious and they were perfectly done. For entrees we split the special, a brown butter sage sauce over stuffed with ricotta and steak filled tortellini and the Rigatoni all' Arrabbiata. Both were delicious and filling. It's hard to say which one was better but I'd have to give it to the special, neither of us had ever tried anything like it before and loved every last bite!

I used to walk pass this place for over a year when I worked blocks away and was very excited to finally give it a try due to the yelp reviews. It was a Sunday night and the place was packed! We waited about 20 minutes for a table, however, when we were waiting, the man who brought the order to the table would walk by us and OH Man did he have body odor. Maybe that was a sign of the night to come. We started off with the very delicious foccacia bread with brushed tomato. Highlight of the meal. One thing I noticed was the lack of parmesan cheese to dip your bread with. Next, we ordered the salami pizza and caprese salad with buffala. Both came out within 15 minutes. So then the night started going down hill, we waited nearly 30-40 minutes before hubby could no longer take it and we had to call the manager to cancel our main courses. We had another couple sit next to us who sat down and ordered after us and were already on dessert while we still did not get out food.  We finally talked to the manager who was really apologetic, and we decided to cancel the meal because hubby was so mad he didnt want to stay.

2015-05-11,3.0,"I booked dinner for two at Volare last minute on a Friday night, hoping that despite its proximity to Mag Mile, 4 stars and nearly 1000 reviews wouldn't let me down. Buuuut the only are Volare excelled was service, which our waiter carried with grace (and a hint of pretentiousness). Despite the somewhat boisterous crowd of businessmen, families, and couples, he acted like the maitre d' for a classy restaurant complete with hand flourishes (e.g. when delivering the giant menus). The complimentary bread basket consists of a soft French bread and what seemed to be cheesy focaccia brushed with tomato sauce. We were brought a dish of parmesan, on top of which the waiter drizzled olive oil for dipping. We barely touched the focaccia since it just wasn't... good, but the French roll was soft and tasty! Our appetizer, the Salsiccia e Peperoni, was recommended by the waiter. The bell peppers here were severely wilted, having given up the flavor battle to the black pepper in the sauce. The sausages themselves were good, especially when bathed judiciously in said sauce. And then maintaining true bourgeois fashion, a server came to take away our dirty plates/silverware and replace them with clean ones.  Things flopped when we received our (huge) entree plates. My Fusilloni al Ragu di Vitello was way way WAY too salty. So much that I had to put down my fork after three bites and chug my glass of water. (An observant server came promptly to refill my glass. Thanks!) We notified the waiter when he came to check in on us and he immediately apologized and whisked it away. Upon his return, he notified us that he told the chef and deducted the item from our check. The Spinach Fettucine special my boyfriend ordered was much more palatable, but not deserving of ""MMMM"" status.  The bathrooms require you to go down a few stairs to a hallway with several doors. I had to squint closely at each one to make out the faded Italian denominations on the doors - but ladies, yours is at the right end of the hallway.   At the end of the night, we ended up spending about the same amount on just the one entree and appetizer as we normally would for two people at other Chicago restaurants we visited.

Shared a cheese and salame board as a starter.  Nice way to work through the first cocktail.  Then moved on to the roasted beet salad.  Love that they had yellow and red beets.  Not over dressed.  They actually let us split this order so it was a nice portion for two, too much for just one. We had a Chicken Parmigiana and a Black Ink pasta with scallops, shrimp and crab meat.  Both were healthy portions, served hot and at a nice pace.  I thought that the crab has a bit shredded but the flavor was spot on.  The pasta was al dente. Decent wine selection.  We had an Amarone for about $80 which is appropriate for the market.   The wait staff is enthusiastic and efficient.  This is not high brow over engineered Italian.  It is straight forward with good quality and mid-tier pricing.

We started with prosciutto and burrata with tomatoes and beets. The burrata was ok had much better ones in NY or SF. Followed by a Ceasar salad which was very good. The good things about this restaurant are the bread, grated Parmesan cheese with fresh olive oil and service.

I started with a minestrone soup to die for, then had spaghetti neri al pesce - black spaghetti with shrimp, crab, and scallops. Sweet Jesus it was good.

I had the salmon. It was ok, I can't say that I loved it. The salmon was cooked fine but the accompaniments did not wow me. In fact the entree was not that memorable. I also shared the ravioli with my friend and those were indeed, quite lovely. Pillowy and well made with the perfect amount of filling.  If I wasn't such a gluten freak, I would have had more. Wines were flowing and they have one of my faves, The Prisoner. I had a lovely Italian white that was good for my fish and the waitress had recommended it, so kudos to her.

Our waiter explained the menu, offered suggestions, and talked about which substitutions were good. Once we decided, he was quick to take our order and offer more suggestions, but he wasn't pushy or trying to oversell. I expect he was used to tourists or folks not familiar with this type of Italian food because he wanted to make sure I knew rapini would be bitter, but he was gentle with it, not cocky or questioning.  While waiting, we appreciated the quick fills on water and generous bread to start -- especially since we had spent the whole day walking. The hostess and waitstaff worked well as a team throughout our time there. They were all pleasant and friendly.  The three of us ate our fill in pasta - ricotta ravioli, beautiful, fresh, and well-sauced; spaghetti with Alfredo sauce and Italian sausage; gnocchi with vodka sauce; and rapini. The pasta was fresh, homemade, and perfectly imperfect. The gnocchi were of the cut, not formed, style, but their flavor was excellent, and they were not too heavy. The tangy vodka sauce was a perfect complement. The spaghetti was cooked to just the right level of softness, and the Alfredo with it was rich without overpowering the thin pasta. The rapini was gorgeous and green with a lovely bite, mellowed out with garlic. It was a great companion to the richer pasta dishes.

I have adopted the ""European last minute planning"" attitude around here because honestly, I don't have time to scrounge the internet and plan out dinner events now that we have a toddler.  It was my birthday and my husband booked us a room at the fabulous Swiss Hotel while the kiddo spent the weekend with the grandparents. We had no reservations for dinner though.

So as we walk around in the frigid weather this past December (loooong overdue review sorry) we stumbled upon Volare-yea! I have actually been wanting to check this place out and didn't even think to book a reservation here! Has it been that long for this mama?  So we give it a go and walk in and they said it will be like 45 minutes before we can be seated. That's fine, we deserve it for trying to be so spontaneous. But once we got seated it was worth the wait. The  owner is this old school Italian who will escort every woman to their table and hold their wine for them, how classy is that?  We started off with the house salad which was SO good, I could have eaten a huge plate of it. We then moved onto Fried Calamari which was great too and not heavily breaded.  I ended up getting the Lasagna for my main dish which was perfectly done and my husband had Sea Bass and he remarked it was good as well. The portions were reasonable and not over the top like CheeseCake Factory. The place was happening and there were also many other birthdays going on.

My husband and I shared a small order of the Insalta di Cavoletti (roasted brussles sprouts, butternut squash). First of all, the half order was HUGE and served about 4 people for an appetizer. That ""salad"" is not really a salad - it's almost like a pasta salad or something, so it is very rich and definitely not good for you. However, it was quite good. I'm not a huge fan of mustard, so that's the only thing I would have changed (besides a smaller portion). For dinner, we shared the Fusilloni al Ragu which was good but very salty. We had more than enough food for the two of us between the half order of salad and full order of pasta. Our friend had the Pappardelle Ricotta which was also delicious. I normally don't care for Ricotta but this dish was very good. The free bread was delicious - very well done! The service was on point. Overall, a great dining experience. Not quite 5 stars because the dishes weren't particularly unique and there were elements that I didn't enjoy in each of them, but overall a very solid 4 stars. TIP: they had more reservation availability when I called vs what was shown online.

I had the quattro pizza (good, basic Neapolitan-style pizza) and the brussels sprouts salad (very unique with cool textures). My friends had several of the pastas, which they all loved. In short, everything tasted delicious. The bread they serve is also quite delicious. I'm not a huge Italian person, but everything seemed really fresh and it was definitely worth the price (the half portions are fabulous!).  HOWEVER, our waiter, we'll just identify her by her first initial, C, was the worst. She kept calling us all ""sweeties"" and ""love bugs"" which might have been cute if we were 5, but was not so cute for a group of 20-something professionals. She also wouldn't even let us see the wine menu until she looked at our IDs, which seems really strange to me. There isn't really any harm in seeing a wine menu if you're under 21, since you have to show ID before you order anyway, right...? She also did a ""drum roll"" on the table behind us which was extremely obnoxious and annoying and it did not look like the people at the table enjoyed it either. Finally, and worstly, when the bill came, my friends and I split the check and wrote the totals for each card on the back of the receipt (mind you, we had ensured with a calculator that everything added up correctly). C took the check, walked two steps, and started doing the math in her head. She immediately came back and told us that we still owed her $5 because we were short. We told her that the math was correct, and she said we could do the math together. We did it again and she realized that our math actually was correct all along. I don't even think she apologized for accusing us of not paying the right amount. Hint to waitresses: maybe don't accuse customers of not paying when you've just quickly done the math yourself. OH AND when a friend asked to clarify the price on her wine after the bill came out, the waitress passive aggressively opened up the menu and pointed to the price of it, even though my friend had already said it was fine and that she believed C the first time she said the price. The entire ordeal was just extremely patronizing, and I do not have the time nor the patience for condescending waiters. The food also took a while to come out, but nothing worse than I was expecting given that it was an extremely busy Friday night. Lastly, I was a little annoyed with our table... I think they crammed the four of us into a table for two, and so when our food arrived, our waitress had to put two dishes worth of food on one plate because the plates wouldn't have all fit on our tiny table otherwise. I would come back again, but only because the food was so good. Maybe I'll just do takeout?",0.9932,0.805,0.139,0.056,0.5216931216931218

Excellent salad...I really liked the vinaigrette....nice and light, and a good complement to the ingredients in the salad. My friend and I then split the Fattoria Risotti and the Gnocchi alla Vodka for our main. The Risotti was very nice...cooked perfectly and the sauce was flavorful without being overpowering. The Gnocchi was a disappointment, after reading all the good comments about it in reviews beforehand. First, I asked the waiter if they could make the sauce spicy, and he responded that the sauce is already premade, so they can't adjust it. (That really should have been my sign to order something else.) When the Gnocchi arrived, the pasta itself was wonderful...light and fluffy...but the sauce was terribly bland. Quite a disappointment. If I were ever to return (doubtful), I would try the Gnocchi again, but with a different sauce...perhaps what they use on the Rigatoni all'Arrabbiata. Final comment...they are a bit pricy.

They have a good menu with a variety of items - they have both homemade and dried pastas, which they clearly mark so you know what you are getting. They have a variety of chicken, steak and seafood entrees. But when the server read the specials, I was intrigued by the King Salmon on a bed of Spinach with oil and garlic. There were a number of appetizer and dinner specials, but this one really captured my attention.  They serve Fociaccia and crispy Italian breads with oll while you wait. Their oil has Parmesan and oregano in it. I prefer mine plain, so they brought me a separate plate of oil. I thought it was curious that they didn't have cruets of oil on the tables, but they did not when the basket of bread was empty or one of the plates of oil was dry so they brought more. The Salmon was a surprisingly large portion. It was, unfortunately, a little overcooked and underspiced. I don't recall the server saying it came with Steamed Muscles, but it did and they were marvelous. I asked about wine pairing. The server asked what I liked and I explained that Chardonnay was a little too dry for me, but I wanted something light and fruity but not sweet. She recommended something and, not knowing any better, I said I would try it. What she brought was quite sweet, more of a desert wine. If I could compare it to anything I would think it was a German Riesling. After dinner, when she brought the check came the final shock. Where the typical price for a menu item here was $$, the special was a high $$$. I should have asked ahead of time when she did not offer pricing when explaining the specials. Overall, not a bad experience, but a little disappointing. From the overcooked salmon to the sweeter than described wine, it was not what I expected.

2014-09-01,5.0,"This is one of those reviews I keep starting and then stopping because I keep getting distracted by reminiscing about what I ate and then I start drooling and then I come back to reality and have to make sure I did not drool on the laptop. The point is, Volare is indeed amazing enough to conjure up fond memories of the tasty dishes, not to mention the fabulous service and the inviting atmosphere. At the time of this writing, it looks like there are more than 860 other reviews that are more or less favorable, so I'm pretty sure there are a few hundred people out there who understand completely (drool notwithstanding). My parents and I were in town and we had 8:00 p.m. tickets to a show across town. With 5:45 p.m. reservations made, we walked over and prepared ourselves for what would be the definitive meal of our trip. The walk up to this place takes you past a covered patio that was already bustling with business at this hour. Servers and bussers were going back and forth to make sure customers were taken care of and as we walked into the dim entrance, we saw that same attentive quality extends to all other members of the staff, from the hostess who seated us to the manager who greeted us. But that was nothing compared to our waitress. Her name was Blanche and she was so accommodating and helpful that it was like she had known us for years. She knew the menu front to back, and while she was refreshingly honest about her menu recommendations, not once was she overbearing. We knew we were in good hands when she suggested an awesome bottle of wine to start the evening, and I knew I was in great hands later on when she pointed me toward a particular dessert that settled my stomach from the war I waged upon it over the prior 90 minutes. My Dad opted for the half of a kale salad to start with, while Mom and I plunged into the little neck clams. The salad was wonderful and, let's talk clams right quick: traditionally, these can be a lot of work for little payoff when it comes to culinary satisfaction. Not so with these clams. These were outstanding, and the sauce they came in was enough to make me consider ordering a shot of it, table manners or no table manners. Fortunately, cooler heads prevailed and it was time for the main course. Dad's pappardelle with meat sauce looked amazing. He's eaten this dish around the world and, for him, this one ranked as the best he's had. Mom went with the night's special, the lobster ravioli, and she loved every bite of it. She actually left me one pocket to taste but I couldn't because I just got done committing social suicide by somehow finishing the pan-fried breaded veal. This thing literally eclipses the plate it comes out on and obliterates your daily caloric intake. But, oh, is it worth it. While my parents enjoyed a lemon-like item and a duo of cannolis that you fill yourself (really cool, we all thought), I attempted to nurse my wounds with this Oreo-composed ""digestive"" dish that I somehow got a third of the way through. I guess what I'm saying is, come hungry and come with a party that will not be shy about finishing what you could not. A manager came by to make sure our meal was to our liking and what's not to like? The service was impeccable, the food was somehow even better, the staff were all engaging and it would be with great pleasure that we would all return. The only potential problem would be ordering something else on the menu because we were all unflinchingly satisfied with our meals this time around. There's a whole menu of delicacies to consider but I know that veal will be calling my name... which just means it will be a matter of mind over metabolism the next time here. Overall, it's an outstanding dining experience for families, business groups, dates and basically anyone who has ever once enjoyed Italian food.

We dined at Volare on a Saturday night after receiving a recommendation from the concierge desk at the Hilton. We were not disappointed and had some of the best Italian food of our lives. Definitely make a reservation or you will wait. We ate outside just as it was getting dark; I wish there had been more light/candles to actually see the phenomenal food. Our waitress was pleasant and very knowledgeable. We started off with some delicious crusty bread and olive oil and the Insalata di Mare which my boyfriend proclaimed to be the best seafood dish he's ever eaten. It was an excellently prepared dish- just the right amount of lemon and seasoning. For dinner we ordered the mezzaluna special and the spaghetti neri al pesce. The mezzaluna was filled with a delicious, tender, shredded beef and had this unbelievable, flavorful smooth tomato sauce. The spaghetti neri was out of this world- cooked and seasoned perfectly. I don't even like seafood and I thought it was wonderful! The portions were just the right size. We highly recommend this restaurant!

My girlfriend and I enjoyed Volare so much on our last visit to Chicago that we went back...twice. Even simple things like the chopped Volare salad seemed unusually flavorful, despite gigantic portions that must hurt their dessert sales (we definitely didn't have room).  The fettucini and gnocchi were texturally ideal, which along with the magnificent and plentiful scallops and shrimp made me feel like I'd stepped into an alternate universe where guys slamming out plate after plate on a Friday night actually take the time and care to get everything just right instead of the usual overcooked mess. I'd probably steer clear if I were looking for a light meal. You know the old wag about Italian food: two days later, you're hungry again.

First, we requested utensils and napkins because we are in hotel.  It did not come with any.  How do we eat pasta with no utensils?  We improvised and used the coffee stirrers inside the hotel room as ad hoc chopsticks.  I kid you not.  When there are instructions to bring utensils, BRING UTENSILS! Anyway,  I ordered the Fusilloni Al Ragu Di Vitello which is described as ""fusilloni with ragu of veal, porcini mushrooms, peas, pecorino and touch of cream.""  It was basically a meat stroganoff with Campbell's cream of mushroom.  The veal was gamy, the sauce was overpowered by the mushrooms, and the pasta was hard and chewy (this was not al dente - it was just tough).  The good thing was that the portion was huge.  So if you actually liked this dish, there was plenty of it to go around.  Unfortunately for us, we had to toss 4/5 of it - everyone thought it was inedible. We might order again for the pizza, but definitely not the pasta.  Minus a star for the forgotten utensils and minus another star for the pasta dish.",0.8292,0.894,0.071,0.035,0.5499166666666666

My lasagna was delicious! And also incredibly filling. I wasn't that hungry that afternoon, so I ended up taking part of it home with me.

I ordered the fusilloni al ragu di vitello which was a cream sauce with mushrooms, veal and peas. You know how I can't resist mushrooms. The plate was massive. The cream sauce was perfectly seasoned. The mushrooms were expertly prepared and the pasta, even though it was ""imported"" and not made in-house, was exactly al dente. Like this is the kind of al dente that chefs dream about.

I'm a sucker for good pasta, and back then, you could pick and choose what type of pasta you wanted with different sauces. Little did I know that my little ""creation"" would become a staple on their menu years later after the renovation and menu remodel. That simple night in 2009 also almost made tears of joy run down my face after an impeccable slice of ricotta cheesecake was then placed before me.

2014-04-20,5.0,"I can't believe it took us six months to walk across the street and try this place! And yes, believe every raving review you read! While the food is simply amazing, it's the service and hospitality that will win you over. Just remember to reserve in advance, or arrive early, preferably before 7:00pm, on any given weeknight. We were promptly seated for our 7:15pm reservations by the evening's hostess, Tiziana, who introduced us to our waiter for the evening, Michael - we started off with cocktails, simple well drinks of house bourbon and Coke at $8.50, featuring generous pours from the well.  Our waiter ran through the evening's specials, asked some questions about our likes and dislikes, and then made some great suggestions. Michael was very knowledgeable about the wine selection, asking us what we preferred - white or red?, heavy or light?- and ended up suggesting a moderately priced ($48) 2011 bottle of blended reds from the Seventy-Five Wine Company called ""The Sum"". Not the most expensive, not the cheapest, but he nailed the flavor profile with his earlier description. On first impression, the place is a tad loud, so probably not the uber-quiet, hand-holding spot you would select for a romantic dinner with your partner. Traffic constantly whizzes by inside as the wait staff delivers and clears plates, all while efficiently topping off table waters and baskets of bread. It's also a bit snug inside, with the dining room featuring a handful too many tables - in such proximity, conversations tend to drift from table to table, with the backs of chairs bouncing into each other during the meal. Our service was prompt, but not rushed, as the line continued to form just inside the door and out onto the sidewalk. There is some outdoor dining spots available, but on this early April evening, it was a bit cold, even with the gas heaters fired up.  Some folks saddled up to the small bar, which features only a few stools, and managed to choke traffic racing between the dining room and kitchen.  We started out with two apps; a half order of Grigliata Mista - a fire-grilled plate of perfectly cooked sea scallops, calamari and shrimp, all drizzled in a balsamic glaze and fruity olive oil. Our other selection, the Carpaccio di Manzo, featured ultra thin -practically see-thru slices- of beef filet, with a light sprinkling of artichoke hearts, arugula and shaved pecorino, all lightly dressed in a mustard aioli. Both were perfectly presented and portioned perfectly for a two-top. Just a reminder, the warm apps are all available as ""half plates"", same for many of the entrees. And while the entrée portions are HUGE, the appetizers aren't wanting for much either. After seeing the dinner plate-sized veal chop go by a half dozen times, I opted for the ""parmigiana-style"" version of the Nodino di Vitello ($34) - an amazing pan-fried, on-the-bone, perfectly pounded piece of veal, topped with the house tomato sauce and fresh mozzarella. With a nice side of fresh spaghetti, it was more than I could handle, so half of my portion ended up coming home with me. My wife ordered the Spaghetti Neri al Pesce, a huge portion of squid ink-colored pasta with perfectly seared shrimp, scallops and lump crab in a sage, brandy and rose' cream sauce. Absolutely amazing! The dessert offering consisted of small $3.50 servings of various Italian specialties like tiramisu, house-made gelatos, cannoli, flourless chocolate cake... Overall, one of our best dining experiences so far in Chicago - amazing Italian fare and top-notch service from a knowledgeable staff. Two plates of apps, two massive entrees, a $48 bottle of wine and a trio of sampler desserts was $155.00 - with enough left over for a meal at home the next evening.",0.9981,0.834,0.147,0.019,0.536051883439943
2014-04-19,3.0,"My friends and I made a reservation for a party of 8 at 7:30PM on a Friday night and while we arrived just on time, we were made to wait for over half an hour outside in the cold. Their reason was that the previous guests have not left, but I feel like good restaurants would be able to remedy that kind of situation. The complimentary bread they served were pretty good, and I especially liked the cheese paired with the olive oil. I had the Grigliata Mista because it is highly recommended on yelp, and it was OK. Firstly, they cannot call it a salad because my plate probably consisted of four tiny pieces of lettuce, and secondly, while the shrimp and calamaris were pretty good, the scallop was not cooked right and left a really nasty after taste. I also ordered the black pasta, which had great scallops and some great sauce. The only problem was that I didn't expect the portions to be so large so I couldn't finish half of the pasta. My friend who also ordered the Grigliata Mista actually sent hers back to the kitchen because it tasted dramatically different than mine. Her salad had everything over-salted and her scallops were so overcooked that it was rubbery. Nevertheless, she ordered a couple appetizers and the rest were great. Overall the flavor would receive a 4-star, but the wait and the 3-dollar ATM machine really turned me off so I would say it's a 3-star.",0.9954,0.749,0.22,0.031,0.49399859943977587

I was a bit miffed because it had onions in it and in the description that was not listed at all. It was still really good (even for lunch the next day). Friends ordered the black and white spaghetti, some other corkscrew pasta which was really good and chicken parm.  They give you bread and olive oil but we were seated by the window and when it's 20 degrees outside there's a serious draft and it's freezing inside too. Also it was too cold inside so the olive oil's texture turned weird. They were generous with the bread but it was just meh.

I went with the gnocchi which is topped in a vodka sauce and was blown away. I can remember seeing vodka sauces on menus in the past but don't remember trying it. It tastes like a creamier marinara and is divine. If you are on the adventurous side, I recommend their black squid ink spaghetti with seafood.

From the opening house bread to the desserts, all the offerings were delectable, no disappointments at all. My wife and I each had a single glass of wine, my wife was able samples of two to decide which to have. Wine list was fairly comprehensive, included roughly 10 whites and 10 reds by the glass and some half bottles. She also appreciated that virtually all of offerings could be ordered as half sizes, helping avoid the overstuffed feeling that can ruin a meal.  Our server was very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu, and Italian cuisine in general . The courses arrived quickly, but we did feel rushed at all. It was clear that all components were made in house, from the pasta to the bread crumbs.  To top it off we had four different desserts, all of which were hits.  The final bill including tax (but not tip) was $154, which was very reasonable given two glasses of wine ,appetizer, and desserts, as well as a cup of cappuccino.

2014-03-18,4.0,"Here is yet another ruing of the lack of the 1/2 star system. My visit at Volare was great and they would rank at 4.5* for me. The first thing that struck me was from the second you enter you feel like you're part of a bigger family. I know, insert Italian joke here, but it's the honest truth. My Italian wine group came here for one of our dinners back in November and while they were insanely busy, they made sure we were feeling more than welcome from the word go. So, we then naturally started ordering food like it was our last supper. Our group started off with the bruchestta and carpaccio. The bruchestta was absolutely killer and the carpaccio was sliced as thin as you would want. Naturally we had to do another round because one wasn't enough.  As a second starter, we also decided on doing some pizza. So, for the 6 of us, we got a margherita and Volare pizza. I just want to say straight up, the Volare pizza was just flat out amazing. It was really delicious stuff. That is not to say that the margherita pizza isn't really good (it is), it's just that if one had to choose, it would most certainly be the Volare pizza IMO.  Then it was onto the pasta course. Since there were 6 of us and we generally like treating every restaurant as a small plates restaurant, we went with the gnocchi and veal ragu. The gnocchi was exactly how you'd want it to be: light and fluffy with a slight bit of chew to it. The veal ragu was spot on perfect with the sagrantinos we were drinking. We knew we were going to need something with a bit more heft to it, and this delivered in spades.  While we had eaten a good amount already, there was no way that we weren't going to have some entrees as well. The group decided on the roasted half  chicken and the filet. Where do I begin with both of these dishes? We loved the half chicken so much that we had to order a second one, and naturally we couldn't finish it so we divvied it up and took it home. The filet, well, this was spectacular. This was one of those perfect wine and food marriages that just give you a grin from ear to ear.  My group has Volare high on our sights for another visit. We were treated so well the entire way through and I was fully impressed by how well run the staff was given how busy it was.

We were back in Chicago and had to try it again (some people had been craving it for years) and went last night. We had a 7pm reservation for a party of 4 and had to wait a few minutes to be seated. The food was as I remembered it and excellent. The arribiata penne pasta I had was delicious and had good spice and the caprese salad was terrific with a really flavorful buffalo mozzarella.  The spumoni ice cream was also very good (they call it gelato but it isn't) and they have a good array of desserts but the half mason jar presentation of each was a bit odd and looked unappetizing for some of the desserts and for this type of a restaurant. The service this time wasn't as good as I remembered. Good service to me should be attentive but not oppressive and Volare last night was into the latter. From the moment we were seated we felt as if we were being rushed to turn the table. We ordered an appetizers and our salads were brought at the same time. Our main courses were placed within 30 seconds of finishing the salad/appetizers without any break. I am not a slow eater but I was asked multiple times if I was finished because I set a fork down on my plate. We were seated in the middle of the restaurant near the bar and there always seemed to be someone there on top of us. I would recommend asking for a table or the side or deeper into the seating area in the future which may provide a more relaxed experience. All in all great food, service didn't live up to how I remembered it but I'll probably be back the next time I'm in Chicago. 3.5/5 this time previous trip was a 5/5.",0.9906,0.863,0.129,0.008,0.41006349206349213

When we got to the restaurant we were told our entire party had to be there to be seated and that they were running about 15 minutes behind on all reservations (understandable as the place was packed!). We were just going out after so we didn't mind grabbing a drink at the bar for a little bit but may have been issue had we needed to be somewhere right after.  We were seated about 20 minutes later. We had a big, round table which was great but just like a lot of restaurants in big cities there was very little room between the tables. Our server was great, and walked us all through the great specials that night. He was also really nice about walking me through the gluten free options. Gluten free penne is available and several of the dishes (including the 4 cheese risotto which sounded awesome!) can be modified to be gluten free. I had the ""spaghetti caprese"" with the gluten free penne and it was awesome! Everyone else at my table liked their meals as well (spinach pasta bolognese, ravioli, and chicken parmesan) were a few.

For example, once I asked for a spritz (a cocktail) it was a nice warm day outside a warm wine just wasnt as appetizing.

2014-01-15,1.0,"We were here on New Year's Eve by a friend's recommendation. He wanted to see a ""friend"" who was playing jazz there that evening. We thought ""Cool - a jazz band for dinner!"" They were a duet, jammed into a tight corner and were mediocre at best. We had a 9:30 reservation and arrived on time. The hostess was friendly as she escorted us to the bar, telling us it would be a 10-15 minute wait for a table as the place was crowded. As this happens to be our anniversary, we were dressed for the occasion.  And even though it was New Year's Eve, we were way overdressed for the venue - which was strange because the place doesn't appear to be that casual. As we waited, the manager suggested on two occasions that he kept mistaking me for a waiter.  Funny once - sort of.  Our bartender was friendly and professional and the best part of the evening. Time passed, the hostess forgot about us.  We checked back with her on the 1/2 hour and she offered us a table all the way in back, far away from the music. We opted to wait.  Another 30 minutes went by. The hostess had either left for the evening or found something better to do as her station was now empty. We stopped the manager who was very accommodating and surprised that we were actually there for dinner.  Hmmm. Formally dressed people coming into your little 8 seat bar to celebrate NYE? I don't think so. So guess what?  Even though the front room had tables (not yet cleared) he sat us all the way in back, far away from the music. At this juncture it didn't matter anymore because my friend's ""friend"" had somewhere else to be and announced this would their last song for the evening (10:45PM) and we were starving. Suffice it say that the waiter recommended wine was remarkably inferior for the $60 price and surprisingly difficult to drink. My six, small ravioli took a full 30 minutes to arrive and were served to me ""plain"" even though I special ordered them with olive oil, lemon, butter and Parmesan. I ate them anyway as the waiter was gone for 10 minutes before checking back. Having now run so late, we were the only people left in back room as New Year's approached. We were stuck at Volare for the stroke of midnight. 3-2-1 Midnight! Nothing. Yeah Volare!  The other couple took this occasion to get into a heated discussion about who-knows-what?  We moved on to Jordan's Bar at the Intercontinental Hotel where, practically panting, the manager told us it was last call. Seriously?! Last Call?!  In Chicago at 12:30AM?! Unbelievable. Luckily, we're an adaptable couple and enjoy each other's company despite adversity. This was not our first poorly planned, poorly executed NYE - but with any luck it will be our last. All in all Volare was very disappointing and really not worth all the time, effort and money. I see that a lot of people love this place and its history. They can have it.  In retrospect, we should have gone to Buddy Guy's and drank dinner. We'd have had a much better time. We won't be back.",0.98,0.871,0.092,0.038,0.4479622195985833

2014-01-03,4.0,"Picture it:  It's two weekends until Christmas, and my parents were in town from the little town where I grew up.  My mother wanted to see the lights on Michigan Avenue, shop at Macy's and visit the Christkindlmarket.  My father, who I think genuinely hates Chicago, had one request:  dinner at Volare.  Rather than trying to talk him out of it and into one of the half dozen excellent Italian restaurants in the neighborhood where I live, I went with it.   I have to say I'm glad I did.  Imagine the mob scene at Christkindlmarket (it was like being in a human anthill) followed by Macy's, which seemed spacious and relaxed in comparison, followed by a dozen or so other stores on Michigan Avenue.  Dad was a sport through all of it, even though he hates crowds even more than I do.   Finally, we get to Volare in time for our 9:00 reservation, which was the middle of the night for my parents, frankly, but was the only time available on a busy Saturday night because their beloved son (me) waited until that day to make reservations.  Naturally, Volare was mobbed; however, the staff could not have been nicer or more accommodating.   My father had the gnocchi, which I think he had planned the whole day.  My mother had an amazing risotto.  Even the leftovers I ended up with after their departure were out of this world.  I had the lasagna, which melted in my mouth, and a couple of martinis to take the edge off of the day. The food was amazing and the service was impeccable, and there was only one thing that keeps from giving them five stars.  I'm pretty sure that they added tables to the dining room for the holidays to accommodate larger crowds, which led to my seat being a little less than a foot from the diner across the aisle from me.  It didn't leave the servers or diners much room to walk at all, and I ended up with a lot of derrieres in my face.  But, again, I'm pretty sure it was just for the holidays, and I'll definitely be back.",0.9928,0.845,0.137,0.018,0.5698784722222223
2014-01-03,4.0,"This has become an instant favorite. Went here in a group of 4 with a reservation at 6pm on a Friday. That turned out to be a great decision as when we walked out 2 hours later there was a line of about 5 tables. Everything we got was super delicious and in very generous portions with a reasonable price tag, especially considering its prime location. I love that you can get a half entree so that you don't need to waste any food (or if you don't like to take leftover with you) and more importantly so that you can have room for desserts. I got the di mare (seafood risotto). It's a little bit too moist for my taste but the red sauce was on point. I would have loved more spice/kick but it was still a delicious dish. I was pleasantly surprised with the amount of seafood in one dish. The scallops were very fresh and sweet. For the ingredients alone, I give this dish a thumbs up. My friends got the clams linguine and seafood spaghetti neri. Both looked divine. They also enjoyed two glasses of white that paired well with their dishes.  Ambiance-wise, it's semi intimate but overall very family friendly. They can accommodate a party up to 10 people. Service was attentive but not excessive. There was some miscommunication in my salad order but our waiter got me a new/correct salad right away and owned up the mistake. Kudos for that. It's super easy to snatch a reservation and one can always rely on walking off (some of) the calories on Michigan Avenue afterwards.",0.9974,0.718,0.259,0.023,0.5844155844155844

We came here for a family dinner - 10 of us crowded around a long table - but enough room for us.  My only complaint is that the staff could barely get by the table - which led to them knocking the coat off the back of my fiance's chair four times - they all immediately picked it up... but still - it was tight. Appetizers were simple, but pretty good - calamari and sausage and peppers.  I thought it strange that they didn't have many Italian wines on the list, but still found a New Zealand pleasing to share for the table...  I tried to order a Dark & Stormy to start, but they didn't have the ingredients!  My main course - seafood risotti - was pretty good, but the octopus was very overcooked - it was quite tough.  My real problem here was the main dish of my fiancee - he ordered a linguine with veggies and whitefish that was supposed to have a garlic and white wine sauce... the issue was that the dish, while well presented, was just tasteless - it was frankly terrible... It should not have been a special!   Desert wasn't bad at all, just not special or memorable - a creme bulee with berries and some coffee. Despite great service - the food was meh to bad and doesn't prompt me to come try again.",0.9733,0.757,0.155,0.088,0.5135312306740879

We stopped here on the way to a show and slightly worried we'd get out in time--boy were we wrong!  Despite the long lines they run this place like a military operation.  They really work at turning over tables quickly.  Our server ran us right on the border of being efficient and rushing us.  I'm still not sure.  I didn't feel rushed per say but I would have liked a more leisurely pace to the meal.  At one point, when someone was picking at their food during the chat she actually cut his food trying to move him along!  It was bizarre and she asked permission, but it was to send the message ""eat it or box it"".  He boxed it. The place is incredibly large and noisy.  This isn't the place for a romantic meal.  Our server upsold most items and, this annoyed me, saying because I was a big guy I didn't order enough food.  I get she needs to upsell but I was quite satisfied with a half portion. Quality of the food was great, but everything was a bit heavy here which is classic red sauce style Italian.  Lots of cream or olive oil.  I'm not always accustomed to this as I prefer a lighter fare.  For the portions, pricing was reasonable but the portion sizes were quite large especially with bread service before.  If you want to get a half portion--get it.

2013-10-30,3.0,"If you're in the mood for old school Italian in the heart of downtown Chicago, there's a lot to like about Volare. From the cozy, familial dining rooms to the expertly mixed martinis and friendly, bustling wait staff, this restaurant aims to please. For the most part, it succeeds, and the majority of the diners at our table were very happy with their meals. Start with a large antipasti platter and some fried calamari to get things going. I especially liked the Prosciutto de Parma and the Taleggio cheese, accompanied by some mixed Italian olives and a crisp, dry Italian red wine. If you're hosting a business meeting, be aware the noise levels are quite high, so conversations may be difficult. If you're there for fun, though, sit back and enjoy the show! A special note for gluten sensitive diners - Volare has gluten free pasta, made from chickpea flour, and it is quite delicious. I can recommend the caprese sauce, fresh tomatoes, basil and mozzarella tossed with extra virgin olive oil. However, if you have Celiac disease, please keep in mind that Volare makes non-GF pasta in-house, so cross-contamination could be an issue. Be sure to let your servers know of any allergies prior to ordering. Alas, there are no GF desserts, but the artfully arranged grouping of dessert ""jars"" were a big hit.

For entrees I had the black spaghetti with seafood and Hubbs had the special that evening, which was sea bass. Both were excellent. We topped it off with 4 mini desserts because we both have a giant sweet tooth. Limoncello cheesecake, chocolate creme de pots, cannoli, banana cream pie, all served in smalli little mason jars. It was perfect because we got our fill of four desserts! We left stuffed and happy.  It was honestly the best night of our entire trip, and the best meal we had, hands down. Just sorry that we discovered it on our third trip instead of our first. Can't wait to go back!!",0.9967,0.718,0.277,0.005,0.5484607984607985

My spinach fettuccini was full of the lousiest Bolognese sauce I've ever eaten: salty finely-ground beef with almost no tomato or other ingredients. A staff person sprinkled some dry Kraft-style shredded parmesan on my food. Large portion, most of which I left uneaten. My friends: one ate only about a fourth of his calamari/shrimp dish and did not have the leftovers boxed for take-home; one, when asked about her veal, said the cutlets were ""thin"" - no comment on the flavor; one ate his bland, unremarkable chicken but there wasn't anything Italian about it.

We both ordered the squid ink pasta + scallops, which was delicious without being too heavy.  My friend still raves about the pasta we ordered to this day, 2 years later.  The desserts were OK--I would go elsewhere for your finisher if you're looking for something sweet.  In general, if you're looking for Italian, Volare will be a very solid meal.  However, the decor indoors is overly dark, and the service very meh.  I might be back--no guarantees!",0.7058,0.82,0.102,0.078,0.4845138888888889

I asked the bartender for a Cabernet sauvignon and he said he had a few, and I picked one - then he told me that blend wasn't his preference so I should try something else, so he gave a sample without my prompting.  I didn't care for it. He sampled several more (again, with no prompting on my part) and I didn't care for those either. I told him so, and he said ""well you've had like 10"" (which wasn't even close to true) and out of exhaustion I just picked his favorite so he would stop. I didn't care for it. I tried 5 different cabs, and none were close to on-mark for a cab, all were strangely vinegary, and the lady sitting next to me who ordered the same agreed.  Well anyway, we were seated and the server was friendly. The quarters are very close, and the acoustics very very loud. Also, several families. Not quite the romantic environment promised. They also had pop/rock music playing, which really clashed with everything. This place would meet higher standards of class with a quieter environment and more room. We were given bread (but not refills).  I had the absolutely delicious gnocchi, soft pillows with slight chew in a creamy vodka tomato sauce. My companion had some sort of meat with blueberry sauce which he absolutely loved. Both excellent.  For dessert, they have little glass containers with different options. We shared a very small creme brulee. This was actually quite nice because you could order several to share for a fill dessert, or only one or two for a taste of dessert.  Overall the bill was far less than we anticipated. The gnocchi was great and thus worth the noise and cramped quarters.",0.9828,0.806,0.142,0.052,0.45818627450980387

Within a short amount of time our waitress came over to give us the daily specials as well as to deliver us some bread and olive oil.  Our waitress ended up being a very pleasant lady and even though she spoke some broken english, I would enjoy her service throughout the meal.  For my entree I decided to order one of the specials of the day which was a green and yellow tagliatelle with sausage in a tomato sauce.  While waiting for the meal I decided to try some of the bread which was good, especially when paired with the parmesan and olive oil dipping sauce.  Whenever the pasta came out I have to admit that I was impressed with the portion size of it.  More importantly it tasted really good as the pasta was cooked nicely and I liked the taste of the sausage with the sauce.  While I do not remember what my fiance had, I do remember that she enjoyed it as well (she has informed it was a farfalle al salmon) and we left a happy couple. The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  Everything about this place was enjoyablefor me including our seats on the street , the food and especially our waitress.",0.9908,0.847,0.139,0.014,0.5351010101010102

2013-10-20,5.0,"A friend and I ate here tonight and we had a excellently delicious, fresh, flavorful and refined meal.   We were seated within 10 minutes, even though the restaurant was quite busy for a Sunday evening. For our appetizers, we ordered the House Salad, the Rotolini de Melanzane (Baked Eggplant Rolls), and the Fritto di Calamari (crispy Calamari).  It was all delicious, especially the Eggplant Rolls.  Wow.  Freshly-made pomodoro (marinara) sauce over a delicate slice of baked eggplant rolled around ricotta cheese.  Very light and an extremely good combination of warm, tangy sauce with a comforting nubbly creamy cheese.  Excellent.  I had the Spaghetti Neri al Pesce (Black Spaghetti tossed with shrimp, lump crab, scallops and sage in a brandy and cream rosé sauce), and she had the Risotti Fattoria (Risotto with chicken, peas, and a four cheese sauce). I ordered this Spaghetti because it seemed different, and many previous Yelpers have reported they liked it.  According to our very courteous waitress, it is one of their more popular dishes.  I see why: it was extremely tasty.  Spaghetti infused with black squid ink is not something I eat every day, but our server explained the squid ink has no flavor (mostly for looks), but it is supposed to heighten the palate and bring out the flavors of other seafood it's served with.  The shrimp, lump crab and scallops all paired beautifully with the brandy sage rosé sauce which tasted slightly sweet from the brandy and cream base, as well tangy from the rosé, and earthy from the sage.  I wish by this point I had been hungrier so I could finish it. My friend's Risotti was extremely rich but the addition of the peas was a nice touch to lighten an otherwise on-the-heavy-side dish.  After all, it is a four-cheese risotto, so we shouldn't have been surprised. We had two desserts: the Oreo banana pudding with an oreo-cookie crust which I thought was good, but I wasn't overwhelmed.  And we also had the Limoncello cheesecake with a Pistachio biscotti crust.  Now this one was a triumph.  I don't mean to over-hype it: it's not the best Italian dessert I've ever had, but the limoncello cheesecake paired with the pistachio biscotti crust totally worked.  It came with diced strawberries on the top. This is certainly one of the best Chicago restaurants I've yet to eat at, and I would absolutely recommend it, and will be pleased to return when I can.  It seemed like they had a restaurant full of regulars.  A very lively enjoyable place.  We sat at the table talking for quite awhile after we were finished eating, and didn't once feel like they wanted us to leave so they could turn the table.",0.9964,0.793,0.174,0.033,0.6911252834467121

The gnocchi was perfectly cooked, and that vodka sauce is renowned on Yelp for a reason. The sauce had the perfect consistency and made for a well-balanced dish. The gnocchi is heavy so I don't think there's any need to add a meat to it (you have that option). It's already good on its own so there's no need to mess with it! The Pizza Volare (insert Homer Simpson drool here) was delicious! This pizza comes with prosciutto, ricotta, artichokes, and tomatoes. It was crispy yet had enough body to hold up all the delicious toppings. Man, I wish I had one right now.  If you can, try to come in for the lunch specials.

For dinner, we tried the calamari (good), the Insalate Volare (average maybe), the vodka gnocchi (good, but not as good as everyone here on yelp keeps claiming), and the lamb chops (average).    The group we were with ordered a few bottles of wine ... but nothing exceptional, just house white, house red, etc., and the alcohol bill alone was $415!  There was a huge argument about this ... one guy showed the waiter the bottle, a $9 bottle of wine that we were charged $80 for. I felt like this place is in the business of scamming tourists.  Unfortunately, with great reviews and a decent location, they are going to keep doing it. My advice ... if you must eat here, go for lunch, order half size pasta, and drink water.  (But first ask to see how much the water costs ... )",0.4117,0.805,0.1,0.095,0.5378174603174602
2013-08-29,1.0,"We decided to try Volare's after looking it up on Yelp since the wait at The Purple Pig would be over an hour. We came in and were told to wait for about 10 minutes. Everything seemed to be going pretty well, the bread was good  and things seemed alright. The two of us ordered some grilled seafood and three half portions of pasta. When the grilled seafood came on it looked relatively normal and the shrimp tasted fine, the calamari was slightly overdone, but the scallops left a toxic bitter taste in your mouth so naturally I complained and said quite clearly that ""I'd like to look at the menu for something else."" The waiter started to protest with ""but that's ju...."" and simply took the dish away. After waiting with no attention whatsoever for 20 minutes, the SAME DISH was brought back to us, slightly less burnt and with the sauce on the side instead of poured over the dish. Not to mention that I wanted to change the appetizer, I had also told the waiter to simply serve whichever dish came up first since we had a movie to catch but it took a full 40 minutes to serve the pasta. To make matters worse, the menu said that all pastas are available as a half order but didn't specify that the half order was at 70% of the price of a full order. After this appetite ruining experience we at a bit of the pasta, packed it up, and went on our way. Simply put, never, ever again.

This most recent time I started with the minestrone which was just ok, wouldn't avoid it, but probably wouldn't recommend it either. Other people at the table had some salads that looked decent but nothing special. The entrees were top notch. I had a salmon pasta in a tomato creme sauce which was superb. The salmon was fresh and the tomato sauce was not thick or overly tomatoey like a number of sauces can be. The sauce wasn't heavy either which made for some great pasta. Got the full order which was enough for two full meals so in that regard its good value - because I had two meals for the price of one. A number of the other dishes were rather overpriced. Multiple people at the table got the salmon filet which looked well done but was nothing unique and rather expensive in my opinion. Same for their chicken breast dish.

FOOD Bruschetta: 4 fresh slices of bread with tomato and basil. Nothing special. ** fun fact... it's pronounced broo-sket-tah... not broo-shed-ah. Calamari: THIS IS A MUST ORDER! Unlike some of the standard, heavy breaded, rubbery calamari we've had at other places, this giant portion of glorious seafood is prepared to perfection - extremely moist, just enough breading, and helpful serving of marinara sauce. Gnocchi alla Vodka: wow... gnocchi at its best. extremely fluffy, light and creamy. We ordered the full size portion... but noticed that there was barely any difference in portion size with the half order... other than the price. I recommend adding a protein - sausage, chicken, etc. - to this dish to add another dimension. Fusilloni al Ragu di Vitello: I still dream about this. The dish was HUGE! It was so creamy... but not so heavy that you want to stop eating. The ragu with veal was just delicious... peas served as little bursts of freshness throughout the dish... and a little bit of parmesan on top.  Our other guests enjoyed their meals as well.

2013-06-21,5.0,"Amazingly Great Food, Service and Value! My wife and I enjoy our trips to Italy... eating at Volare transports us back there in just a few bites.  Don't worry about them rushing you to turn the table. Take your time with your wine and a broad selection of antipasti  Pizza - thin crusts made with fresh dough and authentic options like, prosciutto and artichokes; the way you'll find them in restaurants in Italy... not heavy, overloaded with cheese. Want  some hearty, comfort food? There is a rich, meaty lasagna that is by far the best I've had. Or, try the Ragu di Vitello... ground veal, pea and pecorino with a bit of cream served over fusilloni; our favorite. Keep it simple with clams in white wine and garlic over a bed of homemade linguini.  If seafood is your preference; don't miss the risotto with scallops, clams, mussels, shrimp and calamari. The flavor of each is retained giving every bite the individual character you'd hope for. We enjoy the food so much that we have it delivered when we don't have time to stop in... AND, it is just as good as if served table side! They always offer seasonal and daily specials, so you'll never tire of your options. One day I was hungry for something not on the menu... I was told, ""no problem, our kitchen will be happy to prepare that for you.""  OK, I'm more then a fan, I'm officially prejudiced... but, Volare earned it with every bite they've served me.

My wife and I stay at the Ronald McDonald House, which is more or less connected to the building that Volare is held. this prompted us to try it out and we were more than pleasantly surprised. just outstanding and i am sort of disappointed in myself for only finding this place out not after living in Chicago for the last 5 years. I am however giving this place four stars simply because wine selection is a tad limited and you have a choice of stupendous wines or the cheap stuff and prices are a bit high for a glass of the Freemark Abbey. $24 for a ""large"" pour, i am a little meh about that.",0.9416,0.815,0.142,0.042,0.5545238095238095

Went to Volare on a suggestion by coworkers, and they weren't wrong.   On a Friday night it was packed, so we grabbed wine at the bar.  Had a glass, and then we were promptly seated.   The complimentary focaccia bread with the dipping sauce (seemed to be olive oil and Parmesan cheese) was pretty tasty.  A few people at the table ordered ravioli, gnocchi, and salads.  They raved about their dishes, and licked the plate. I may be biased, but I think my entree was the star.  I ordered the black spaghetti with scallops, shrimp, and some other seafood (i think).  It was SO GOOD.  I usually can't eat that much pasta in one sitting, but I cleared my plate.  The pasta was perfectly al dente.

2013-06-04,4.0,"Came here for dinner tonight for the first time with my family. I thought the food was overall excellent - starting with the warm crusty bread and some type of foccacia they served along with it...YUM!  I ordered a half order of the spaghetti caprese and thought that the sauce was outstanding. I also tried a bit of the gnocchi that my mom and aunt ordered. The sauce was very rich but I found that to be good as well (I think it may have been a bit on the rich side for them). I tried both the margherita and five cheese pizzas that my cousins ordered and thought that they had a good crust and very fresh tasting cheese. They were both a bit turned off by the strong smell of one of the cheeses that they used. It does have a bit of a strong smell, but it is delicious! We ordered dessert as well - I thought it was interesting that they only served ""mini"" sized desserts (almost, quick frankly, too mini - maybe you get four bites from each). I personally prefer sharing larger desserts among the table instead of the mini dessert concept, but I think it is a good idea if everyone wants something different. They were tasty as well. For three glasses of wine, one diet Coke, a house salad, a half order of the fried calamari, a five cheese pizza, a margherita pizza, a half order of the spaghetti caprese, two orders of gnocchi, an order of ravioli, and five mini desserts, the total came out to $177 - not cheap, but not unlike anything you would pay in the area.  The service wasn't anything to write home about which is why I subtracted one star - but I think I would come here again!

We ended up traveling on Mother's Day this year and after arriving at our hotel realized it was going to be a trick to find a place that wasn't charging an arm and a leg for a meal. We went to Volare based on the hotel's recommendation and fellow Yelpers comments. Volare is great. We had our two year old with us and the servers were kind and attentive (even on a VERY busy day). Our food came out quickly and it was delicious! They even made a pizza for our little one. For Mother's Day they did a pre-set menu, but it was not over priced and you got to select your entree.  After our Mother's Day experience we decided to head back for a lunch later in the week. Once again the food was awesome and the service kind and surprisingly kid friendly.

2013-05-22,5.0,"Volare was recommended by the staff at the nearby Marriott. I wasn't sure what to expect. We walked in on a Thursday night without a reservation. The place was packed and I came to understand why. We did not wait long for our table of 4. We were seated right in the middle of the dinning room and it was loud and full of energy (like an Italian restaurant should be). We had 2 servers, Russ who was being trained by Joshua. As I was perusing the wine list Joshua approached. He was so knowledgeable I assumed he was the Sommelier. He knew the wine list and menu inside out (as it should be). He had some great suggestions. We finally decided on a nice 2009 Cab. Guess what-When the bottle was presented it was the 2010 version (not as good). This has happened to us over and over in many fine establishments (read my other reviews). Our server apologized and Immediately brought over the 2009. He said a new case came in and it is a 2010. Do yourself a favor and check the vintage every time you order a bottle (no matter where you are). Joshua's service was outstanding. It is all about the customer for Joshua. I couldn't decide between the risotto and the sea bass special. When Joshua heard this he said he would be able to give me the sea bass and risotto on the same plate as one main. Fantastic that he would do that and both were very good. My wife wanted the rigatoni Al Arrabiata but it had pancetta in it which she did not want. When Joshua heard this he told her he would have the chef make a similar sauce just for her without the pancetta. She loved it. Our 2 young boys just wanted plain buttered pasta and that was made to order for them as well. All of the dishes had extremely fresh ingredients. Side note-there is an ""open kitchen"" so when they were making our dishes I was able to bring my sons over to watch the chef's in action. There were several awesome choices for dessert and we asked which ones were nut free for one of our sons. We all chose the pot 'o creme. When it came out it was served by one of the assistant managers (our waiters were very busy with many tables). The manager said ""enjoy the pot o' creme with Frangelico whipped cream."" We stopped our son from taking it and asked him to clarify. He said the whipped cream on it was made from Frangelico (hazelnut liquer) but that the ""nuts"" are cooked out. We were confused and didn't want our son to partake. The manager apologized and brought one over without whipped cream. The wait staff also told us there was nothing to worry about and the Frangelico whipped cream no longer has nut residue. I'm still confused but they did mean well. By the way- the pot 'o creme was wonderful. Overall the food is a 4 but Joshua's service brought it up to a 5 star experience.",0.9918,0.862,0.11,0.028,0.5470593811872883
2013-05-20,2.0,"I would like to give this restaurant four stars based on the food alone, but unfortunately the service didn't stack up. I used to get food from here to go for late night working sessions and maybe that's where I should have left it. Went here on a Saturday night...made a 7:30 PM reservation. When we arrived, we didn't get seated for at least 20 minutes. Couples who were walking in without a reservation got seated at the same time as us...so whats the point of the reservation? We also noticed  people around us wondering the same thing. We then got sat and when we ordered drinks our waitress informed us that we looked to be 16, and being that we are both almost 30 it was more so an insult. Maybe I should have told her she looked to be about 50 and see what reply I got?? After our food came, we were pretty much disregarded. Sure, our water was filled umpteen times, and our plates were taken away but even with those clues, our waitress refused to see if we needed dessert or the check even after passing our table multiple times. We originally wanted dessert, but after she downright ignored us, we took our 'dessert business' to Baskin Robbins instead (where the woman who scooped was quite helpful and cheery might I add).  I would say this place is great if you are going at a down/early time where they can give you the deserved attention but this place clearly cannot handle busy nights.

Calamari is very fresh, and unlike a lot of other places, this one is not doughy at all. I love how lightly calamari is coated.  My seafood spaghetti is unbelievable--very flavorful, with a lot of crab meat, perfectly cooked scallops, and shrimps. My husband's  linguini has A LOT of clams. They definitely aren't shy on the seafood OR the portion. We both had a lot to take home and it's the perfect dinner!

Delicious. Finished off my meal with a dark chocolate pudding topped with real, homemade whipped cream. Exactly how a chocolate dessert should taste, delicious! I would definitely be back in a heartbeat. Our waitress was charming and very professional--as were everyone who came to refill or take things away for us. The staff really makes this restaurant. The front desk staff changes: during this visit they were charming, during our last visit they couldn't have cared less about us or finding us a seat. Lots of large groups enjoyed seating in one of the large, centrally located round tables. There's high tables near the bar. Beware, the restrooms are located one floor below the main dining room after taking a longish staircase down, take a left and then a right. During my visit to the ladies' room, two women who seemed to have enjoyed their vino a little too much decided to turn off the ladies' restroom lights while all the stalls were occupied. Then turned the lights back on several minutes later. Not sure what that was about.

2013-01-21,2.0,"Note: This review is only based on 2 menu items. I was disappointed with [ lack of ] service as well as the food.  We came here for lunch on a Wednesday.  Not sure how busy it normally is, but I was here on business, and the conference I was attending was only a few blocks away.  So when the fiance and I were here... it was busy. Upon entering Volare, we weren't greeted by anyone, but had to approach the hostess who said we'd be seated shortly.  In a few minutes, we were seated at a table by, I believe, the restaurant manager or GM (maybe an owner, not quite sure).  We had to flag down a server a number of times before someone was finally able to take our order.  Grigliata Mista to start and the Pizza Special to share. The Grigliata Mista is described as: Sea scallops, calamari, octopus, and shrimp fire grilled, laced with aged balsamic and frantoio olive oil.  SOUNDS delicious, but most of it came completely charred.  We don't normally send back anything unless it's steak that's terribly under/overdone.  But this... we would have were we not scared it would take forever.  We were famished and just wanted to eat.  So, after eating what we could, about half of this appetizer was still left on the plate.  Such a shame this tasted awful, considering the portion was generous.  I made sure to flip all the seafood charred side up so that the server and/or a manager would notice, but it didn't happen.  And FYI the charred sides were pure black, no exaggeration (I will post photos soon).  The pizza (I forgot the description our server said) was topped with pepperoni & sausage and was actually quite delicious.  Definitely deserving of 4 stars, at least.  The crust was a little soggy, but this pizza was so tasty the crust didn't  even matter.  I know, what a waste! I am in Chicago often on business, but there are so many amazing places to eat that I'm not sure if I would choose to come back to Volare.",0.9136,0.792,0.117,0.091,0.5402938652938652

First, the good stuff: the staff were pretty tolerant of us bunch of college kids bumbling around in the hallway and so on, having just come back from watching a film. Waitress was friendly, bread was refilled promptly [this is so important to me, you have no idea. BREADDDD. They didn't give another plate of the parmesan-olive oil though, now that I think about it.]  On the other hand, most of the food [with the exception of the vodka sauce gnocchi--quite good, as the reviews say] was relatively meh. The seafood risotto was actually disappointing, and not creamy at all; the whitefish was average. Spaghetti on the chicken parm was a little harder than I like. Tiramisu was okay, bread pudding was definitely not worth it.  Mwerhhhh. Now that I think about it more, service/atmosphere probably made it 4 stars instead of 3 from counting food alone.

I was a bit surprised that the sitting area was smaller than expected while the open kitchen area looked huge. But it was fine for us since it was lunch and the place was not filled. We had reservations and was seated immediately. The waitress was nice and attentive...maybe almost too attentive as she interupted a number of conversations we were having which was a little annoying.  The food was very good. We each ordered a half salad and was expecting small sized portions. But let me tell you that the half order of the Mediterranean seafood salad was like a full entre size. I'd be worried about finishing a full size order even for dinner! The salad came with grilled calamari, shrimp, octopus, and scallops which were all tasty and cooked to perfection.  For the price, I was very impressed with how much seafood was in it. However, the chopped greens it was sitting on was drowned in too much dressing which made it salty and soggy. Ah well, that was ok though. Who would've had room for lettuce after all that calamari! The entre's came a little slower than we would have liked. I think we were starting to get a bit restless especially when we saw that only half the restaurant was full. How could food be served so slowly? But it was worth the wait. I ended up getting the half size lasagna and i am in heaven! The pasta was cooked to perfection. the meat mixture in between was smooth, light (if meat can be light!) and creamy and the sauce was not overwhelming or salty as many other places would have it.. I was full from the salad already, but managed to finish the entre too. Yum! Another person who also had the same dish was also delighted with the taste. My other coworkers had a risotto and a pannini. The risotto ended up to be a bit rich, but my boss exclaimed that the humungous panini was surprisingly good.

The complaint I have is that Volare is a victim of its quality. Waits of over an hour are apparently not uncommon, even on Monday. I can attest that on my Monday visit, I'd waited for an hour for a table, and finally (just barely) nabbed a seat at the back bar.  On that, one more annoyance: the bars are a great place to eat, but for the fact that they can quickly get packed at least two people deep, and there is absolutely no system for prioritizing bar seating. I lost a back bar seat to a passer by simply because I chose to check for seating at the front bar at the wrong time.  In short, be prepared to wait and be prepared to be blown away by your meal. To the owners, please try and bring a little method to the madness of bar seating.

I can't tell you exactly what he chose, but I can tell you that it was yummy. For entrees I ordered the Gnocchi alla Vodka and WOW. I've never had gnocchi like that before; it was light and billowy and rich all at the same time. Really amazing. And the sauce was spot-on.

2012-08-06,4.0,"Volare holds special - romantic - meaning for two of my friends; hearing them rave about the food and service for years made it an obvious choice for a most unromantic celebration - tax dinner.* Volare recently remodeled, expanding to what I believe is almost double their original size. What's interesting about the remodel is that the new portion is virtually a mirror image of the old. A wall separates them, so each side remains lively, but cozy. In the warmer months, they also have a decent sized outdoor patio. When I arrived at 7:30 on a Wednesday evening, I was a little surprised to see the place packed. So packed, I didn't even notice my friends tucked in at the small bar; I highly recommend reservations. As soon as I arrived, we were ushered to our table; the tables are a bit close together, which makes for an intimate dinner, if not a loud one. To start, I had a solid greyhound - made with real grapefruit juice and not stingy with the vodka - and split a cheese plate, Grigliata Mista, and mussels in white wine sauce. The cheese plate options could use some tweaking. Maybe offer a variety plate or use some garnish to jazz up the plate; our peccorino was good, but the thin white cheese delivered on a white plate looked boring and sad. I didn't care for the Grigliata Mista, a favorite of my friends. Normally a big fan of seafood, something didn't jive for me. I'm not sure if it was the pairing of seafood and a balsamic glaze or if possibly the seafood was over-grilled, either way I wasn't loving it. The mussels were good; large and prepared traditionally, they were solid, but not what I'd consider a destination dish. The wine list is pretty lengthy; my one friend and I opted to split a bottle of pinot grigio with our dinner. For my main, I ordered the Spaghetti Neri Al Pesce**, or squid ink spaghetti with shrimp, scallops and lump crab in a pink sauce. My friends went with their favorites, the meat lasagna and rigatoni alfredo with prosciutto and peas. I see it stated on the menu, but our server gave us the option of a full or half order for our entrees. Personally, having a great meal twice is a treat, so I went with a full order. My meal was excellent; they did not skimp one bit on the seafood, the pasta tasted homemade, and the overall pairing of the ingredients was perfectly decadent.  Volare has earned itself another fan; I can't wait to eat up more of the menu! * I do tax returns for friends in exchange for dinner. I think more services should be available via barter; a good meal and great company is the perfect payment. ** The menu on their website differs from the one you'll see on site. Personally, I think the online one is harder to read and you're better served viewing the MenuPages one.",0.9984,0.762,0.206,0.031,0.5271947545631757

We finished our meal with a pastry, creme and peaches concoction that was just right sweet and light to end a pleasant dinner outing on their open air patio.

2012-07-12,4.0,"I love Yelp and use it often, so I decided to start adding some reviews... so bear with me, it's my first time! Went to Volare after reading a favorable review in Crain's Chicago business. The only thing I have to complain about is the bread - so I will start there and end on the good stuff.  There were two types of bread, regular baguette style slices and an onion focaccia.  The problem was that both styles of bread were incredibly dry and I felt as though it was disintegrating into flour in my mouth.  The olive oil for dipping was not the most flavorful either in my opinion.  But that's enough with the critiques, now for the good things! Sitting outside was incredibly nice.  They have a big enough sidewalk where you don't feel crammed against the other tables and waiters trying to walk around you.  And our waitress was friendly, knowledgeable and really enthusiastic about the menu.  All of the staff was polite and welcoming. To start, my mom and I shared a salad - The insalada ""rapi or rape"" (sorry, not on the online menu so I forgot the name) was incredible.  It was spinach leaves, crispy onions, apples, gorgonzola, roasted beets, with a roasted onion vinaigrette.  The best part about that salad, however, was the parmesan crusted poached egg on top.  I don't usually love eggs, but this was amazing! My mom ordered the braciola, which is a special on Thursdays and the waitress said a lot of people come in exclusively for this dish.  It was really good, the noodles were al dente, the meat was tender, the sauce had a great rosemary taste to it.  The sauce is actually a pork neck bone sauce, and it was very flavorful.  The one thing I didn't love about it was that it was stuffed with egg (like I said, I don't love eggs) but I would definitely order it again. I got a fusilloni with veal ragu, mushrooms, peas in a cream sauce.  Like you would expect, it was very rich - but SO good.  It was almost like the Italian version of a Stroganoff, if you could imagine that.  I was full from the salad, so I took about 3/4 of it home - and I think if I add more pasta and peas, I could make at least three more meals out of it!  (now I just sound like Carl Weathers). We did not try dessert because we were stuffed! OK, first Yelp review, check!  I hope it helps!",0.9977,0.794,0.192,0.014,0.5303754578754578

We were escorted to a table for four with about 12"" of clearance between the edge of our table and the back of the chair of another patron.  Every time a waiter or busboy or customer walked by, they hit our table and knocked my husband.   The restaurant was busy so we tried to make due with our location.  I ordered the eggplant appetizer.  When the appetizers arrived the waiter brought me calamari. (In hindsight I should have kept the calamari.)  After explaining the mix up, my second appetizer arrived about ten minutes later.  It consisted of three silver dollars slices of eggplant which were basically breaded but raw and uncooked.  I'm guessing that because the kitchen was trying to get the eggplant out quickly, they thought they could save time by not cooking it.  When the waiter asked how my appetizer was I told him very clearly that I should have kept the calamari.  He did not offer to take it back, he did not offer to get me something else, he basically ignored my response. At this point one of the managers noticed how our table was constantly being bumped by every passerby and offered to move us to the rear of the restaurant.  We were shown to an empty table without napkins, silverware or water.  And there we remained for five minutes without anything. Suddenly our entrees arrived but we couldn't eat them because of the lack of utensils.  So we asked for silverware.  Eventually we got silverware, but no napkins or water.  So we asked for napkins.  And eventually we got napkins, but no water.  So we asked for water and eventually we got that too.  By this time my chicken parm was cold , lifeless and extremely disappointing.  My meal tasted more like was a Stouffer's frozen dinner than a restaurant prepared entree. I could go on but what's the point.  I had been to Volare several times before it closed for remodeling and enjoyed it very much.  It should have stayed closed.  Chicago has many excellent Italian restaurants.  This is not one of them.",0.8418,0.879,0.069,0.052,0.3992969396195202

We first called to see if we could make a reservation and they told us they weren't taking any more reservations for the evening. So we asked how long the wait would be if we came in and waited... They told us up to 30 minutes. Okay, we can do that. So we went in, gave them our name, and they quoted us the 30 minutes like on the phone. GREAT! Then 30 minutes went by, and no one called our names, my dad went up to ask when our table would be ready, and they quoted us ANOTHER 30 minutes... well, if you promise it will be ready in 30 minutes (an hour after we first gave you our name) then we'll wait.

2012-01-16,4.0,"On a trip to Chicago a couple years ago we had a craving for some italian food, following a tip from a local we gave Volare a try. We arrived early so there was no wait, while seated though we did notice the restaurant fill up rather quickly so I could see there being a wait.  The wait staff was great and very attentive, they were also great offering suggestions on the menu. I elected to try their homemade cheese ravioli and let me tell you it was one of the best homemade pastas I've had outside of Italy (I've become somewhat picky about pizza and pasta). I am planning another trip back to Chicago this year and am excited to make another visit to Volare's to have some yummy italian food. Second visit May 2012 One of the best Italian restaurants in Chi-town. This was my second time eating here, first since they've expanded the place. They've given the place a bit of a face lift and expanded to add more seating. They have a nice bar area just as you enter and the kitchen is open so that it may be seen on both sides. Thankfully the food is still quite tasty. We made a reservation for 830pm since we knew it would be busy (which I highly recommend if you're going after 6 unless you don't mind waiting). Just a note that with the added seating and expansion it can get rather noisy when busy so it isn't the easiest to have a conversation but also not impossible.  Service this time around could've been a little better but only minor things. We ordered the lasagna, fettuccini verdi alla bolognese and spaghetti caprese. Note portions are generous so unless you plan to share or can put away a ton of food order the half size for pasta dishes. I definitely recommend the fettuccine as the meat sauce is yummy. They start you off with some bread and olive oil with parmaggiano reggiano so don't stuff yourself on bread or you won't make it through the meal. Overall I would definitely recommend the spinach fettuccini or lasagna.

2011-09-05,3.0,"Since we live so close, my husband and I have been dying to come to this restaurant for a long time. Surprisingly on Labor day weekend, they didn't have the lines that I've seen outside their door We were seated outside where they have heating lamps and it's a relaxing laid back atmosphere. I'd heard the inside restaurant might be a bit noisy but outside is great! We started with the riceballs appetizer which were very tasty but also very filling. They are fried on the outside and almost like a toasty meaty cheese risotto on the inside. Served plenty in an excellent fresh tomato sauce.  The remainder of our experience was just ok but mainly because we opted out of the traditional italian multiple courses which would have given us a more balanced meal. If we'd planned to go all out, it would have been a more balanced meal to order a salad in addition to our appetizer and main.  Instead, we just had the tasty but heavy rice balls, and our pasta dishes. Our pasta was literally just pasta and sauce with nothing else in it or on the side.  So i left my meal feeling very heavy.  i had ordered the gnocchi and vodka sauce while my husband ordered the homemade egg noodles and vodka sauce, and it was literally just a cream sauce with pasta, for 15-$17 each!! For an extra 3.50 we could have ordered a meat on our pasta, i guess. Also, I'm not a huge gnocchi fan but the waiter strongly recommended it, and while it was very good, it just isn't my cup of tea. The vodka sauce was good but honestly my mind wasn't like ""OH WOW"" like i was with pasta I've had at Coco Pazzo.

The environment was loud and cheery--as you'd imagine of any authentic italian restaurant. Fresh focaccia with olive oil, delicious grilled seafood (calamari, shrimp, scallops) in basalmic vinegar, lobster raviolis were tasty but I found a tiny remnant of a shell in mine which you could take as a positive--they use real lobster meat. The linguine with clams was slightly too salty for my taste but had both fresh clams in their shell and a lot of different types of clams in the wine sauce. I only caught sand twice throughout the whole meal, which is pretty impressive.  We also had the brazillian sea bass, which they paired nicely with a light lemon butter sauce that did not overpower its freshness. They filleted the fish right at our table.

That's insane, I know the next day was a holiday-but come on! So we passed and opted to go another time when we had reservations. So the next weekend, we had a group of 10 people with an 8:30 p.m. reservation my boyfriend had made the night before. Half of us arrived on time and they wouldn't seat us until we had our entire party, which is very common, but still not a best practice in mind (especially when we had a reservation). But when every one did show up, we were seated right away (which shows the table was ready). The restaurant is TIGHT. The table itself comfortably sat our party, but it was squished among the other tables, pressing our chairs up against the people behind us. Our waiter was there right away to take our drink orders and left us plenty of time to look over the menu. Most of us ordered a form of pasta with sauce (I had the gnocchi with pesto-which was amazing!). When the food came out-it all came out at once so no one was sitting there waiting for food while others had theirs. Everyone's dish was hot, so it was timed perfectly...something that doesn't usually happen for a large group. You're able to split the check a maximum of five ways, which is nice and not typical to find in the city.

The pasta had plenty of goodies, I had the seafood pasta with lots of lobster, mussels, salmon, squid, and chilean bass, but the pasta itself was overcooked but most importantly had NO flavor of all of the ""goodies"", like the 2 never had a chance to sit and meld which is the secret of a good sauce. I tried 3 different pasta''s they all had the same problem, lots of noodles not enough flavor! Not sure what kind of pasta they used, but they sure did not taste or have the texture of a good semolina pasta like De Cecco or Barilla, if I go again I will try something other than pasta.",0.9639,0.756,0.183,0.061,0.6067649281934996

I had the Arrabbiata sauce with Cheese Tortellini which was a very nice combination of cheese and spicy tomato sauce.  I eat a lot of spicy food and this is very mild spicy but packed with flavor. I tried my girlfriends dishes as well. The vodka sauce on ravioli was delicious, i liked mine better tho. And Farfalle-bowtie with the Salmonata, which has salmon chucks in a tomato sauce. I liked this as well, although my girlfriend seemed to just pick at her meal. So if you aren't a big salmon fan, I'd hold back on this dish. We also ordered a side of meatballs which ended up the size of a baseball. They weren't bad, but I've had better.  Dislike: It was very congested and loud. We had five at our table and I think if we had anymore it would have been very difficult to hear. The guy sitting at an adjacent table was so close that it almost felt like he was seated at our table. The servers have to squeeze their way thru the people and tables to serve food, seems a little dangerous. I wonder how many spills have happened here due to people collisions.

It's homey enough to please your Nonna, romantic for date night, and a vibrant start to a girls' night out. Which is probably why it has become my go-to place in Chicago whenever someone in the group suggests Italian food. It's always a bit noisy, but never so much that you can't hear your dining companions. Besides, the concepts ""Italian,"" ""quiet,"" and ""dining"" don't really belong in the same sentence anyway. It's unpretentious, comfortable, old school Italian served by well mannered, informed and there-exactly-when-you-need'em waiters.  The only-on-Thursday braciola, veal Teresa and linguine alle vongole pomodoro all received enthusiastic raves on my most recent visit. The wine list is well thought out, and  ranges from the approachable and familiar to the boutique and eclectic. Mark-ups are generally fair, and waiters really do an excellent job recommending and describing wines that complement your meal and suit your tastes, rather than the oft-abused quick upsell opportunity.  Desserts and coffee drinks are no mere afterthought here. Cappuccino is perfectly prepared, with a densely foamy top, served seconds after preparation . (No little artistic designs or frou-fy cookies here, and no heat lost in such trivial dawdling.) Tiramisu (usually uninteresting at best to me) is fluffy, lightly sweet and craveable here -  - - with absolutely no resemblance to the treacly leaden squares or pasty mouth coating goo that I have found at many an establishment that should have known better. To sum it up. Trends come, trends go. Sometimes you want a dining experience to push the boundaries. Other times, you want the culinary equivalent of a dear old friend.

The pasta and gnocchi were cooked perfectly, the pesto was not swimmiing in olive oil, the Arrabbiata had just the right amount of spice and the vodka sauce was not overly cheesey. We devoured every last bite. The service was impeccable. Our server was attentive without being annoying, the dishes arrived quickly, and the supporting staff kept our water glasses filled and cleared empty plates off without being disruptive. very classy service, very professional. We had a bottle of montepulciano d'abruzzo for a reasonable $32 (on the low end) and while the wine was not stellar, it was solid-  of course there are expensive wines that will appeal to the more discriminating wine connoisseur.

I ordered the Gnocchi with the Arrabbiata sauce and it was amazing.  The gnocchi here are homemade from ricotta rather than a potato base and i don't think i can ever go back.  They were light but with a decent bite and had a slight tartness from the ricotta that was wonderful.  Mix that with the smoky flavor of the pancetta and I was in heaven. My wife had the linguini al vongole (which she orders at EVERY italian restaurant no matter how much i beg and plead with her to try new things) and she said it was absolutely the best she's ever had.  Wonderful white wine sauce and the clams were tender and not rubbery chunks as they often end up being. Despite gorging ourselves on the entrees, we made sure to save some room for dessert as we had seem many of them passing our table during dinner.  I had the creme caramel which was wonderful and she had the tiramisu which had just the right amount of liquor and was much creamier than the usual variety.

However the ambiance created by the extremely loud, awkwardly crowded, and sub-par service were so poor that one can barely focus on the food.  I've been here twice because I wanted to give it a second chance, and because it's the only nice restaurant in walking distance to the AMC on Illinois. The fact that I experienced the same shortcomings both visits makes me think it's more the norm than an exception.  I had reservations for 8:30, and got seated around 9:30. Because the restaurant is the size of a postage stamp and the bar has 4 chairs, there is no place to stand and wait without constantly being in the way.  The waitress lost/forgot to place our order/placed it incorrectly and they brought us the wrong food, then had to replace the correct order largely delaying the meal.  Exacerbating the whole experience was the noise level. I'm not exaggerating when I say you can barely have a conversation.  And on a more obscure note, this is the only Italian restaurant I've ever been to that didn't have fresh grated Parmesan cheese. I asked for some and the waiter pointed to a glass pot on the table. When I opened the top I found powdered kraft ""Parmesan cheese."" In the context of a mom-and-pop restaurant with paper table cloths, checkered tile floors, and low prices, these things would be wholly excusable. But the problem is Volare tries to be a nice restaurant and has the prices of one: 1 salad, 2 entrees, 1 soft-drink: $61 before tip.  For that price, you should go to Coco Pazzo, La Scarola, or Picolo Sogno, then take a cab to the movies. You'd end up with the same bill.

I didn't realize how small this place was when I walked in.  There was a crowded bar area with about 5 tables and then a sea of people crammed into a smallish dining area towards the back.  The place was bustling with people and more people were flying in by the dozen to try and get seats.  They had a two-top reserved for us in the bar area.  It was fine when the front area wasn't too crowded, but once people started pouring in I became instantly involved in everyone's conversations and it was like I was sharing my meal with everyone who was waiting for a table.  I gave a few nasty stares and people got the hint to move away from our table or at least talk with 6 inch voices.  Once the flow started up again it was much better. They had a great bar and a decent wine list.  Since I drank so much the night before (oops) we skipped on a full bottle of wine and just opted for a glass.  Unfortunately (for my hungover self), but fortunately for other patrons, the glasses are huge and plenty to get you through a meal.   I started out with a half Caesar salad, which was plenty for one person, and ordered orecchiette pasta with arrabbiata sauce (geez, try saying that 5 times fast) and meatballs to top it off.   I love Italian food, but I am not Italian, and am no expert, and cannot judge a place based on how their sauce compares to Grandma's, and I cannot tell you how ""fresh"" a cheese or food item is because, unless it's bad, I probably can't tell the difference. But I can tell you when it's good.  And it was delicious.  The sauce was spicy (even by my standards) and full of garlic; the meatballs were massive and delicious; the pasta cooked just perfectly; the portion huge!  I thought I'd take a crack at eating a significant amount but food baby set in and I ended up with half of it in a doggy bag.  It tasted just as good 2 days later when I brought it to work for lunch (yes, my co-workers were jealous). Definitely a great place to grab some Italian if you're downtown or if you've seen it so many times and just want to stop in to check out the hype.  I would recommend making a reservation, though.  Also, it may not be the best place to have a romantic dinner, but I suppose you can save the romanticism for afterwards anyway ;)",0.9967,0.797,0.161,0.042,0.544281045751634

I mean I'm down for a good wait, but I'd prefer not to die of hunger so I usually bail before I ever get seated. This time I was determined though. My date for the night wouldn't be ready for awhile, so I got there early, put in my name, got my hour and a half wait time and hit the town. I now know the area like the back of my hand. Eventually I met my date, we went to the podium and they seated us. Perfect timing. Once you are actually seated, you really see how small this place is. Its basically just one room where they fit a few tables and a bar. There's also an outside area out front that accounts for probably a third of the total seating.

Both of us had looked online about what to get and the gnocchi with vodka sauce seemed like a big hit.

So, that's how we ended up getting the exact same meal. I did add some chicken to my dish though to mix it up a bit. I also had the waitress choose a couple of glasses of wine for us. The food was very good. First and foremost, she was right, the vodka sauce was the way to go. Very good sauce. The gnocchi was great also. I've never had such fluffy, pillowy gnocchi before.

2010-10-28,5.0,"Went to Volare on October 26 2010 and loved it. Believe it or not there are a lot of bad Italian places in Chicago that cater to the tourist. This is not one of those places. This is a locals spot and serves classic American style Italian fare with flare and some leanings of true Italian cooking. Our server was excellent and the word no was not in her vocabulary. Compared to Dallas prices, this spot is not expensive and the wine markups are some of the lowest I have ever seen. This place truly is a find. There are great wines choices in the $35 range. It was packed on Monday night and is quite loud. But the ambiance is real and there is nothing contrived or kitche.  Standouts were gnocchi which was truly hand made as all the pieces were different sizes. We had the vodka cream sauce which was just A-1. The Caesar salad was not over dressed but perfect and the anchovy was not overpowering but just right. Another salad we tried was a beautiful smoked Buffalo mozzy with rocket, parma ham and tomatoes. This thing was amazing.  The entrees were fantastic and perfectly sauced. We had a 2007 Casanova Di Neri Rosso at $50.00, This is a must go.",0.9898,0.803,0.174,0.024,0.5961451247165533

How amazing the food was. Went here with a medium sized group (8 of us) to carbo-load the night before the Chicago marathon (props to my friend Caitlin C for Yelping this place and reserving it ahead of time!). We were seated about 15-20 minutes after our 6 pm reservation (about 5 of those minutes being made up by our lateness) and were asked for our drink order promptly. Drinks were brought out not long after (I highly recommend the house Chardonnay - delish!) and we were then able to order what would be, quite possibly, the best Italian restaurant dinner I've ever had.  Right down to the bread and olive oil on the table, this place was just amazing. I could only help but try not to grab another, and another, and another, piece of squishy bread, swirl it into my olive oil - parmigiano concoction and gobble it up.  I got a chicken dish with peas, potatoes and a cream sauce and it was just amazing. Everyone at the table was ogling over it and I was certainly drooling on it. I had to order a side of linguini as the dish didn't come with any pasta.  Everyone else also seemed to enjoy their meals as there certainly was not much in the way of leftovers on the table when we departed. Now, aside from the food.  The waiters were kind of burly, not much finesse to be had with them, but they got the job done. Wait: Make a reservation. Period. Food: A+A+A+mazing Service: Rough around the edges, but gets the job done (kind of like a mafia hit man) Prices: Not cheap, but certainly worth a penny more than you'll pay Atmosphere: LOUD, CRAMPED but fun, you can let loose and relax (think yelling across your table, knocking neighbors with the back of your chair, tiptoeing through tables to get to your own, etc.) I'm trying to remember if my ears were ringing after I left here...if they were it didn't matter because the bliss that was my stomach more than compensated.

After him running/biking/swimming all day and me being an active spectator all day, we needed some srs bsns carbs.

We sat down and the waiter was super attentive and went over all the delicious sounding specials with us. When I was looking over the menu, I was having a miniature crisis because I was so hungry, and everything looked so good, and I couldn't make a decision. Our group started with the baked clams and the calamari. Beautiful on both counts. The baked clams came with these out of this WORLD lentils, which really brought out a lot of flavor. The calamari were hot and crispy - very satisfying stuff. All of this food was gone in about 2.5 seconds. My friend and I ordered a half a bottle of white wine and dug in.  For the main course, I had the gnocchi with vodka sauce. In my (slightly) inebriated state, I described them as ""eating clouds"". I still stand by that statement - light, fluffy, cheezy gnocchi with a creamy vodka sauce made me almost die of happiness. It was exactly what I wanted.  For dessert, we ordered a smorgasbord of options. Tiramisu, cannollis, lemon sorbet and a cheese plate. My favorite was probably the tiramisu. It had a sexy, intense coffee/chocolate flavor, but was light as air. Everything else was great as well. God, I am glad I don't work next door to this place because I would spend all my money here.

2010-08-17,2.0,"My husband and I have been living in the city for more than 8 years and we have had our fair share of great and amazing dinner experiences in the city.  Last weekend we decided to try an Italian place and we had heard about Volare and thought we would give it a try.  We made a 6:30 reservation and despite that when we got there a table was not ready and people who came in as walk-ins after us were seated first.   As soon as we walked in i noticed that it was EXTREMELY LOUD and that was only exacerbated by when we actually sat down in the dining room area.  I don't generally have an issue with loud places but it felt like I was in a sports bar on game day.  Luckily neither my husband nor I had bad breath and didn't mind talking in each other's face!   My husband ordered the cheese and meat appetizer (what I call it, I'm sure it has a better title) which he said was good (nothing fantastic).  It took a long time to get him a refill on his glass of wine and we had to flag the waitress down whenever we wanted something as she was not very attentive.  We ordered our dinner about a half hour after we sat down.  A half hour later no dinner and all we ordered was a risotto and a seafood pasta, nothing difficult.  the waitress never came by to check on our food order or to see if we had received our food.  We noticed people who had sat down after us ordering dessert.  We tried to be patient.  After ONE HOUR from when we ordered our dinner, we finally flagged down our waitress and asked her what was going on.  She didn't seem to realize that we had been waiting that long and also didn't notice, until we pointed it out to her, that a large table of about 15 to 20 people that sat down long after us, was now getting served their dinner.  She said casually that she would check out what was going on.  We asked for the manager.  It then took a manager and the waitress more than 10 minutes to return to our table (the place is not that big).  We finally got up to leave and the manager finally found us as we were walking out the door.  Turns out that they had a computer glitch that lost three tables orders, which is understandable and we cna't fault them for that.  And the manager was very nice and offered to pay for our whole meal if we waited, we didn't want to wait anymore at that point so he picked up the tab thus far. We can't fault the error b/c stuff like that happens.  However we were not at all pleased with the lack of attentiveness and awareness of the waitress.  She should have noticed after a half hour or maybe 45 minutes that we had no dinner and should have looked into it, at which point she would have discovered that our dinner request was lost in the system. would like to say that we would give this place another try but i doubt we will.  there are many other great italian places in the city, ones that we know are good and reliable and worth the wait.   give it a shot if you want based on the other reviews here, i hope you have better luck than we did.",0.9914,0.83,0.114,0.055,0.526086691086691

2010-06-16,3.0,"My trip to Volare last week was HOT!  Literally.   It was my Fiance's graduation, and thanks to Yelp's wonderful filter of ""good for groups,"" we chose Volare to celebrate with our party of seven.  Our reservation was for 6:30 pm and we arrived right on the dot.  The restaurant, indoor and outdoor, was PACKED and we waited about 15-20 mins until they finally sat us in the middle of the packed room, bumping elbows with the three tables surrounding us.  To make matters worse, it was on one of the first 90+ degree days in Chicago and their air conditioner had broke.  So, we sat jammed in, hot food and hot bodies surrounding us for the entire meal.  Even the house fans they brought in didn't make a dent in the heat.  To confirm what other people mentioned, it was LOUD in there because we were so packed in.  Not great for elderly patrons, or people who enjoy chatting in normal tones during dinner.   Perhaps my review could be a bit tainted based on this heat, but I wasn't THAT impressed with the food.  The apps- fried calamari and bruschetta were good-- a nice mix of chewy, salty and crunchy.  For the main course,  I ordered the Farfalle with the Vongole al Vino Bianco (clams with white wine and garlic sauce).  I thought it was dry, because the sauce was so runny that it completely sank to the bottom, missing the pasta, and mixed in with the clam juices.  I didn't detect much garlic at all, and thought for a minute that maybe they forgot to put any sauce on at all.  I will say that the pasta was cooked just right and the plate was loaded with clams. Other orders ranged from the Vodka Sauce and Penne to the Fettuccine and Alfredo Sauce, and everyone seemed happy with their food, but it was SO hard to enjoy in the sweltering heat.  We ate our dessert quickly-- two orders of the decedent vanilla gelato and brownie, and two of the pistachio ice cream, and high-tailed it out of there. I probably won't be back because of all of the delicious Italian choices I have yet to try in the city, but I recommend Volare (as long as their air conditioner is working) for anyone looking for a trendy, loud and good bang-for-your-buck Italian joint near the Mag Mile.",0.9807,0.87,0.099,0.031,0.5266233766233767

I had some of the best arancini I've had in Chicago here - as well as excellent risotto with seafood - their ""Risotto Volare"". I found that the best things at our table were definitely the specials - I was less impressed with their basic ""pick a pasta, pick a sauce"" formula, which was all good, but not  exceptional. But it's a mixed bag, because the things that were really good were AMAZING.  On a Friday night (and perhaps this could've been predicted, especially since it was the night after the Blackhawks victory) it was VERY loud. The waitress had to shout to be heard. It made conversation nearly impossible. The problem is that they've put the tables entirely too close together - you can barely walk between them, and are constantly getting bumped by waiters and trays. The noise bleeds between the tables a huge amount.  I don't mind noise - in a restaurant that bills itself as a bustling Italian pasta joint.

I ended up having to change the time of the reservation, and we still arrived 15 minutes late. Car was valeted fairly quickly, and we were seated immediately. Our waiter, Jesus (he didn't introduce himself, but his name was on the receipt), descended upon us shortly after we were seated and gave us menus and told us the specials. I asked him if we could be out by a specific time - and made sure he understood we were in a bit of a hurry (having a show to catch at the Chicago Theatre). He told us it wouldn't be a problem. He floated nearby, about 8 feet from our table while we looked at the menus, waiting for us to choose. Normally this would be a little strange, but he was clearly doing this so that our orders would get to the kitchen immediately. Thank you Jesus. You rule. Once we were ready, I motioned to him. He made the grueling journey of about 3 steps and took our orders, then rushed them off to the kitchen. I say rushed - because I swear we had our appetizer in under 5 minutes. No 40 day wait here! They also brought out a bread basket containing a traditional baguette (not really a fan) and some slices of a flat bread - maybe a foccacia. Those were delicious. Next time - more flat bread, less baguette please! Entrees were served pretty much as soon as we finished the appetizer. They weren't quite heavenly, but both were solid. Again - thank you Jesus. You were a night saver! OK - but I think I'm being too positive. People are gonna think I've gone soft. Time to complain. I figured - hey - it's Wednesday - should be quiet, right? NO. Loud. Really loud. Small room + packt like sardines + bad acoustics = shouting. Argh. Men's bathroom was fairly clean, but very sterile (a bit nicer than a stadium bathroom, with ever so slightly nicer toilet paper). My date reports that the lady's bathroom was equipped with one of those fancy toilet seat covers with the sliding plastic covers... and that it didn't work.

MASSIVE pasta/risotto servings. yes an order costs more than you might like but you're really paying for enough food for two, maybe three, meals. Really GOOD meals. 2. they do takeout, which is a lifesaver because the restaurant itself is constantly packed. I've never been inside without there being just so many people and the kitchen's going crazy with the hurry. I've only eaten in the restaurant once or twice. The service is pretty good, but just because I don't like crowds or feeling rushed, then I prefer to eat at home.

The place itself is small and super loud - you can hardly hear anyone at your table so i thought it was a little targeted to come to our friend and complain to just him. At the end of the meal when we were ordering dessert the waiter just stood at our table insisting that we need to make up our minds right that moment till one of us had to ask him to leave and come back until we made up our mind - it wasnt attentive service it was quite abruptive. the food was okay and the seafood rissotto ranked high amongst our group. however, i wont be going back anytime soon given the high price, the poor service and ambiance.",0.8206,0.879,0.071,0.05,0.5034782608695653

All in all, I love Volare.  It's super cheap -- our meal cost us less than $50 total including tax and tip.  Mind you, we didn't drink because we were both incredibly hungover (maybe that's why I also savored my gnocchi like it was the last meal I would ever eat), but I would imagine that even the wine options would be reasonably priced.   Cute date place, not trendy, food is delicious, service and decor are a bit outdated.  Did I say the food is delicious?

I have had the ministrone soup on multiple occassions and it is wonderful, along with the soup of the day. The cesar salad is average, but the tomatoe mozzerlla salad makes up for it. For dinner I have tried the pesto sauce, the aglio y olio (which is the only one that holds a candle to mine), the vodka and the meat sauce and all are amazing. They sauce their pastas perfectly. All of the pastas are great and they have everything from angel hair to gnochi. The service is amazing. My glass is never empty, and when you get up to go the restroom, they refold your napkin. Several staff members including managers stop by to ensure you are having a great experience. As for dessert, the tiramisu and canolli's are wonderful.

2009-12-29,3.0,"Because the restaurant we wanted to go to was booked until 7:45, my friend and I decided to look into restaurants a little further into the city.  We had wanted to get in pretty quickly and get out also quickly in order to arrive at the Chicago Theater in time for our show.  We ended up choosing Volare based on the good reviews on Yelp.  Getting there was a bit of a task, and we ended up having to bump up our reservation because traffic SUCKED.  They kindly told us they would have a table waiting for us when we arrived, which they did. They also had valet, which most Chicago restaurants do. Life saver.  My friend told our waiter that we were in sort of a rush to get to the theater by 8, and he said that would be no problem, even though it was already 6:45.  We decided if he's right we might as well order an appetizer, we wont be late right? We ordered the bruschetta, which was pretty good.  Obviously a little hard to cut and eat properly, but when you're hungry it's best to just dive into the food.  The waiter brought it to us in a matter of a few minutes.  He definitely listened to our plea.  I was in love with their tomato bread. Not sure why, but it was amazing, and I probably could have eaten the whole basket of bread that night. Both of us ordered Vegetarian meals, pesto tortellini and egg noddles with vodka sauce.  I didn't happen to love either of the dishes, but they also came out relatively quickly compared to everyone else that was dining.  I would say these dishes were really filling, but were also too thick and creamy of sauce and not enough of the flavors I'd have liked.  It just seemed like a standard pesto sauce and vodka sauce with no originality.   Overall the food was OK.  I think the layout of the space isn't really too great.  You're pretty much crammed in and seated next to a bunch of different tables, where you probably can hear a few conversations at once.  Therefore, if you're going for a romantic date, it's probably not the BEST place to be.

The waitress was playing some games with our bill. My friend and I split the tab so I put down my share in cash (half plus more for tip) and we wanted the balance on my friends credit card. Instead of doing as we asked, the waitress charged the same amount on the credit card as the cash was down. So she basically gave herself a tip! And also, if we weren't paying attention we could have tipped on top of that. So we took some cash backk and she got less of a tip for messing around like that. But it seems pretty popular. We got to dinner at 5:30 and there was plenty of room but by the time we were finished at 7pm people were crashing into our table trying to squeeze by in teh packed dining room.",0.9954,0.749,0.219,0.032,0.5074603174603175

2008-11-03,4.0,"Key Yelp: A great alternative to RoSals (i.e. old school southern Italian) in a more user friendly 'hood. Garlic, garlic, garlic!  Review: I needed to find a place to take a close friend for dinner who was in-town for a medical conference. The challenge was a last-minute reservation on a Sunday night. Voila, Volare to the rescue.  They put me in at my preference time of 8:30 pm, and the hostess even met my preference of putting us on the patio, now ensconced in plastic wrapping as prophylaxis from the harsh Chi-town winter. The smell of garlic hits as soon as you step foot at the corner of Grand and St. Clair. Yes, a very good sign.  Paul (or Paulee) was our waiter. VERY ATTENTIVE. Great service, made suggestions for wine and food. We shared some calamari which to me was the least compelling preparation other than the half portion we ordered, which was very big. The calamari rings were cut thicker than I like so the effect was a tad rubbery. The sauce was plain red, with a curious island of horseradish, floating off to the side. I generally eat horseradish with gefilte fish, not calamari, but OK.  The rest of the meal was very, very good with significant portions. I ordered a half a pasta as a primi piatti (clams w/white sauce). It was very very good. Comfort food for anyone who loves pasta, clams and garlic. Best dish of the night. I had a twist on saltimbocca, veal ala Teresa (I believe) essentially veal, spinach and mozzarella, in a sage like sauce. Very delicious, thin veal, again a lot of food, and some nice sides to compliment the veal.  My friend had a veal parm, which came with pasta which he commented was very very good. He lived in Providence RI for years so he knows good southern Italian. We shared a half bottle of a delicious Italian pinot and the total bill was $113 and change, before tip. Very reasonable for a city dining experience and the quantity of food.  Not a first date place (not that I date anymore), but great for friends, a loved one and fun-bonding. I like RoSals on Taylor very much. This place does not have the same vibe and the food at RoSals is better, based on this one experience. But the service here was great, it did not take up a whole evening like dinner at RoSals can do because of the tiny kitchen and when you finish up, you walk outside and you are in the city.

The portions of the pasta dishes can be behemoth. The trick with Volare is to know when to go. You can wait hours for a table if you don't have a reservation [or go somewhere else], or arrive on a Tuesday at 5:30 and get a table right away. The room feels subterranean as it sits under Michigan Avenue making it feel dark and dank rather than moody and warm. The tables are crammed in tight too and on a busy night you're likely to be rubbing elbows with your neighbor, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, it really depends on your neighbor and how s/he feels about it. Don't skip the pasta course, especially if you're going with an entree [secondi] that doesn't have pasta. You can choose from about 12 different pastas and 6 different sauces to create your favorite. Entrees are classic, from Chicken Parmesan to Veal Scaloppini and one of my favorite vegetables to get when it is in season is the rapini. You don't see a lot of rapini on Chicago menus. It's a nice treat. I'm not big on restaurant desserts, but it's hard to resist cannoli with real fresh whipped cream or crème caramel [my favorite].

When I first moved to town, my wife and I decided to try out Volare on a Tuesday night but could not get a table it was so crowded.  Thinking it was a fluke, we tried again the next night with the same result -- far too long of a wait without a reservation.  The hostess made us a reservation for the following night and predicted that ""you're going to love our food"".  The third try was the charm and she was absolutely correct -- it was love at first bite.   Since then I've been there dozens of times with friends, family and business colleagues and it never disappoints.  I have been to other highly regarded Italian restaurants in the city and while many are quite good (Orso's, La Scarola, Il Mulino, Mia Francesca), I haven't found one that beats Volare for the amazing food, outstanding and professional service and reasonable prices.   Be sure to make a reservation because it is crowded every night of the week.  But, even if you have to wait, it is well worth it.  Have some had a bad experience?  It seems so, but after 10 plus years I'm sure Volare would admit they can't hit a home run with every customer (hey, even Jordan had his ""off nights"").   But go there just a few times and you'll see why it's so good.  You'll also notice the owners, servers and managers walking around greeting familiar faces with hugs and kisses on any given night -- they've created one of the best Italian restaurants around and have a devoted following of customers to show for it.  Count me as one of them.",0.9974,0.747,0.232,0.021,0.462046657046657

It was very chewy, bland, and felt like I put a wad of juicy fruit in my mouth. Second, I had some Bruschetta. HINT: TOMATOES ARE SUPPOSE TO BE MARINATED IN BALSAMIC VINAGAR AND OLIVE OIL. THIS  bruschetta was served on STALE Italian  bread, and topped with tastless tomatoes and Kraft cheese. The Olive Garden has more Italian cooking skills then Volare. Last, I had the Chicken Parmesan. What a waste of 16 dollars. The chicken was about 5 inches thick, topped with nasty store-bought sauce, and again Kraft cheese. This place is a joke. For real Italian cusine. Save yourself the trip and the hefty check, and go to Sabatino's 20 minutes away from Volare on the north side. And try some real Italian food.

The reason I've never been there (before last night) is that I just love my La Scarola so if I'm going for Italian food I'm all about La Scarola.

And I""m still all about La Scarola, but have to admit that the food and atmosphere at Volare isn't far behind. This place is absolutely packed so don't expect to be seated right away- even with a reservation.  We had 7:45 reservations and enjoyed a glass of wine at the bar before getting seated at 8:15. But once seated the waiter did a really great job of moving things along so there wasn't any worry about missing our movie. I was absolutely famished so I was excited to see the warm bread basket they placed on our table.  Bread so warm and soft that it's impossible to eat just 1 piece!  For an appetizer we got our usual grilled calamari, but at Volare it also comes with shrimps and scallops. The sauce has a bbq tang to it and tastes exactly like the grilled calamari at La Scarola, but Volare scores an extra star for adding shrimp and scallops to theirs! YUM! As far as our entrees I tried to pick the healthiest option (new years resolution) and went with the pollo vesuvio.  This chicken was extremely tasty and the peas were a nice touch- the potatoes that came with it probably weren't so healthy, but still good!  As far as what my fiance ordered... I have this new plan where I encourage him to get something that I'd want if I wasn't on a diet just so I can have a little taste.  When the waiter mentioned the pesto pasta served with shrimps and scallops I nodded very encouragingly and made it clear how delicious that sounded.  The fiance took the bait and ordered it.  However, my plan backfired when this entree was so delicious that I ate half of it- so much for that little taste!

However, they really dropped the ball w/ the service on this one. We couldn't get them to refill our water glasses for anything. We had to ask 3 people before someone finally came. As the bus boy was taking the plates I told him I wanted my leftovers boxed so he picks up the plate and proceeds to rest all of the dirty dishes/bread basket dangerously close to my food. I'm watching this to see if it is in fact touching when our actual waiter turns around from busing a neighboring table and plops a dirty plate right on top of my food. No big deal right? We gasp and tell him that we wanted to keep that. He nods and rushes off to the back. Only to return w/ the very meal that he had just squashed w/ someone else's dirty plate. Really?! Really! Of course we complained and said we weren't going to eat that now so he offers to remake the order and box up another one. He was polite about it, but I feel like that's right up there with taking a forkful, shoving it into your mouth right in front of us and go ""oh you wanted to save that? I'll box up the rest for ya!""   g r o s s It seemed like they were all rushed and maybe the busboy was new, and the way he was handling my leftovers certainly made it look like it was table waste...but still.

It was cooked perfectly, the flavoring was amazing...  If you are looking for Italian food in Chicago, this is a must see.  Everything was great.",0.9802,0.828,0.158,0.014,0.67421875
2006-12-10,4.0,"This place is dark and crowded and our waiter wasn't the greatest (his Italian accent made up for it), but the food is sooo good.  We started with the scampi and eggplant appetizers.  I thought the scampi was going to be overly garlicky because it smelled so strong, but it was perfect.  The eggplant was great too and I don't really like eggplant.  I had the angelhair pasta with vodka sauce and a side of the meatballs....mmm....mmmm.....good!  Two other people at our table ordered the veal shank special and said it just melted in their mouths.  I'll definitely be back and look forward to eating al fresco in the summer.",0.9791,0.748,0.212,0.04,0.5117965367965368
2006-11-28,4.0,"Excellent and authentic Italian cuisine.  The restaurant is a little on the dark side but the decor, white linen tableclothes, and open kitchen make you feel like you should be sitting down to dinner with Tony and Carmela Soprano - I loved it!  I ordered the pesto risotto with scallops and it was great, the risotto was perfectly cooked, they used just the right amount of garlic, and it wasn't too oily (pesto dishes can tend to get that way).  One of the people I was dining with ordered the veal and could not stop raving about it, we were all very pleasantly surprised.  The prices were very reasonable and I can't wait to go back again and try one of their salads!",0.9879,0.769,0.231,0.0,0.546973544973545
2006-08-30,4.0,"Wine was excellent, even if I picked out both bottles.  Had one Super Tuscan at $40 which was a steal for a restaurant.  Pasta and sauce was great, a little heavy handed on the salt with the sea bass special, the seafood and pasta special was large and tasty.  Two complaints.  One, what the hell is the problem with coughing up some lemons for the shrimp appetizer?  Jesus H, you think it would break the bank.  AND, because of it the shrimp were the shits.  The remaining four appetizers were spot on and so was the salad volare. Eight big eating guys and two or three plates didn't get finished.  Too full.",0.2023,0.746,0.13,0.124,0.558008658008658
2006-07-18,4.0,"Great food and reasonable prices.  I've tried the gnocchi, risotto, and angel hair, and all are delicious.  And in the summer, it's wonderful to dine outside. My only complaint is the wait to be seated. Every single time that I've dined here (with reservations), I've had to wait.  I just ate there tonight, and my reservation was for 7:45, but we didn't get seated until 8:25.  Luckily, they do have a bar, and I didn't mind waiting with friends, but it can get quite frustrating when you're not seated promptly.",0.8738,0.786,0.156,0.058,0.6547619047619049
2006-02-09,4.0,Yum. Its old school Italian food nestled just below Michigan Ave on Grand. Our server's italian accent was so delicious I wanted to spread it all over my foccacia. If you don't order the baked eggplant appetizer you're crazy. My recommendation is to order whatever your server tells you to. And don't leave out the pasta side. Their Al-dente is a don't miss-eh.,0.7572,0.835,0.13,0.035,0.5166666666666667
