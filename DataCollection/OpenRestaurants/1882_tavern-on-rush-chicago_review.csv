I ordered an egg scramble for my meal-- and truly, I could've made the same thing myself at home.  Service was also extremely slow. I wanted ketchup with my home fries and had to ask 2 servers to track my server down to get some. We ended up staying much longer than we wanted to because we couldn't get a hold of our server, and when we asked for the check they gave it to the wrong table.

2017-08-29,2.0,"Tavern on Rush is just an average dining experience when looking for a fancy dinner out.  The downstairs bar is not swanky but instead loud, crowded and uncomfortable. Focusing on the upstairs dining room, I had a very awkward waiter who both gave me a fist bump and also asked to shake my hand (for no apparent reason).  The service was overall just average - by the end of our meal our bread basket was still on the table and the crumbs from the different courses were never swept up. I ordered one of their ""top tier"" bottles of wine - a 2013 vintage of Stag's Leap.  I am well versed in wine and was not ordering based off name recognition, but instead of my knowledge from wine collecting.  However, when the bottle came, it was a 2011 vintage.  It was a birthday dinner and I didn't want to be annoying and send the bottle away, plus at that moment I was not aware of the quality of the 2011 and assumed it was fine.  When I got home and researched the 2011 vintage, it is nowhere close to the 95 points the 2013 is rated - thus Tavern on Rush took advantage of me with a ""bait and switch"" thinking I would not know the difference. I did email the restaurant to voice my displeasure, and after one week they have not responded so I can also confirm they do not care about their guests. The food was pretty good - but food is good everywhere in Chicago so that alone is not a reason to come here.",0.72,0.83,0.092,0.078,0.5933333333333334

You have this triangle filled with restaurants, along with some pubs in the surrounding area.  Loved where this restaurant was located. Great vibe. The hosts strange to say we're very pleasant. The restaurant was cramp packed. It had a classy atmosphere. My waitress with lots of tattoos, was very pleasant. They had indoor, and outdoor seating. Very cool place. It made you want to hang out.  This is my aunts neighborhood. She had a Margherita pizza, it looked not so good. NY style. Could have tasted amazing. I don't know, I did not try it. Spinach salad, was bitter, and I added Salmon. It was the saddest looking piece I have ever seen at a restaurant. It looked like something you would get out of a grocery store. One of those mini, precooked meals. Ends were burnt. We ordered a drink everyone was drinking called pineapple xpress. Wow that was the most bitter, undrinkable drink that I have ever tasted. Not because of the alcohol contain. Because the strange combination of mixes. It did not work. Also noticed other people did not finish their drink either.  Had to have a few Blue Moons to wash it down. Which is never a bad thing in any situation.  Great prices.  Compared to most places, you can order a lot, without the huge bill at the end.  Hopefully their quality of dinner will get better. Never complained while I was their. I had a lot of catching up with my favorite. It's bin a  long time. Hate leaving negative reviews.",0.9667,0.736,0.164,0.099,0.6040501792114694

2017-08-10,1.0,"We had a disappointing experience at Tavern on Rush, specifically due to poor service. We were celebrating a special occasion (birthday) and were pleased to get a table outside in the wonderful summer weather.  Our server, Jacqueline, was rude from the start. Dropped off menus without a glance or waiting for drink orders. Our questions about the wine list or food seemed to just annoy her. Silverware between courses was dropped on the table with a clang. In short, not good service, but we carried on with our meal.  The situation worsened when there was stone/grit/foreign particles in my side salad. Our server was not apologetic or interested in finding out what could have gone wrong. There was no acknowledgment of this when our bill arrived. When I questioned her about this at the end of the night, her immediate response was - ""Well you didn't pay for the salad, it's free."" Two things - (1) The salad is not free. Its price is baked in to the price of the entree. (2) I am not looking for a free salad or a free dessert (which was offered later when I asked to speak to the manager) - I am looking for acknowledgment from the wait staff that something unexpected or unpleasant has happened, and for suggestions on how they can improve my experience (either on this visit or the next). The manager, Joe, did come speak to us when requested. He gave us his card and asked us to present it the next time we dined here (I am not sure what presenting the card is going to do, however). I hope the restaurant understands that if you describe yourself as an ""upscale"" restaurant, customers have a certain expectation regarding the level of service. During this visit, this level of service was not received. I do want to emphasize that the service from the other staff - those who brought water/drinks and cleared our plates - was friendly and pleasant.   Please train your staff (consistently) on how to take an interest in the experience of your guests. If an error or incident is pointed out, the first response shouldn't be ""Well it was free"" - you served me food with stones in it, this deserves some acknowledgment.  Last suggestion -  it would be really nice if silverware was replaced between courses, instead of dropping the dirty silverware back on to the tablecloth. This would help with establishing the upscale environment the restaurant is going for.",-0.4668,0.773,0.109,0.118,0.5558356676003735

Long story short, AN HOUR AND TEN MINUTES after I put my name in, the app told us that we were next. We stood in front of the hostess stand and watched party after party get seated before us.

2017-05-27,1.0,"A Nigerian and a Colombian walk into this restaurant and had a disgraceful experience. My friend has been to this restaurant many times, and loved it and so she suggested this spot for dinner. Today's experience was particularly alarming for me because today was the first time I've experience this level of poor customer service mixed with low-key discrimination. We wasted an hour waiting for a table. A table for 2 at that. At first when we arrived, we were told about a 30 mins wait for the patio area. We put our name and number in and we were told that we would be notified via text. No problem, we understood it was a busy restaurant and were willing to kill time at a store nearby. We came back a bit over 30 mins later inquiring about the wait time. We then were told by one of the girls that she had texted us and we replied with a ""no"" back to her. This was far from the truth. In fact, we never received a notification hence why we came back asking for a time estimate. It truly seemed like the girls at the door just didn't put us on the list because we were ""just the perfect mix"" to be discriminated against, at least thats the way we felt. She then said she would look to see if any outside seating was available. We had shared with her we wanted to sit at the front section prior to putting our names in so we were hoping we could be seated right away. From our view, there were many open tables in the front of the house. Mind you, the restaurant doesn't take reservations for the patio area however as we waited, people were readily been seated at these spots. Which made us wonder, what's really going on? Could they possibly be picking and choosing who gets seated where based on a criteria? Do we fit that criteria? When we asked how much more we had to wait, and even though there were tables free, they wanted to take us to the back of the restaurant like ""let's put the people of color in the back of the house"" We asked - why can't we have one of these open tables right there in the front. I literally witnessed these girls work so hard to make up an excuse, that they changed the version of their lies 3 times. At one point another male employee came over and gave a different reason why we couldn't be seated at one of the openings out front. My friend and I understood exactly what was going on and expressed out dissatisfaction. As POC, we know when micro-aggressions are directed towards us. All in all, we will not be coming back and I will not recommend this establishment to anyone. Honestly, I've lived in Chicago almost 10 years and have gone to many restaurants and this is the first time I've been treated this way. My suggestion to Tavern- Get it together! OR at least do a better job at turning people away. Most importantly EVERYONE should feel welcome in your establishment and should have an opportunity to seat at the front of the house. Do better and train your staff to treat everyone the same.",0.982,0.853,0.1,0.047,0.4181243926141885

I am appalled by the reception I (or lack thereof) I received this evening. I recommended that my friend and I enjoy the nice weather by having dinner outside there. We both ordered a meal but no alcohol because we both have busy days ahead of us. The server took forever to take our order. Once we got our food, we didn't see her again until she brought the bill. She took my plate to wrap up my leftovers and again disappeared for 10 minutes. I didn't think I was going to see my leftovers again. I paid the bill and literally 5 minutes later, the host (or manager?) walked past my table. Our server, who was serving the table next to mine, looked from the host to my table and then rolled her eyes. My friend and I, who are both doctors, were made to feel like absolute trash. We had been there way less than 2 hours and don't deserve to feel unwelcome at a place that I have always loved going. I will now only go to the neighboring establishments, which will hopefully be more respectful of all customers, not just the ones who are spending $100s on food and drinks.",0.9659,0.81,0.138,0.052,0.5083333333333333

The cool thing about this tavern is that it is open until midnight on a Sunday - you don't find that type of thing back out in the suburbs. To start the night we had the Blackened Cajun Shrimp which was delicious. My friend thought they had put too much spice on the shrimp - however I highly enjoyed it with the two dipping sauces they served with the shrimp. For the main meal I chose the Jambalaya which was delicious. The first time I had mussels didn't go over too well - however the way they prepared the mussels here at Tavern on Rush was fabulous. My friend opted for a large bucket of french fries as she was not that hungry. To finish off the night we ordered a cappuccino and a Chocolate Marble TIramisu which was silky in the texture and the mousse was whipped to perfection in my opinion. The plating of the Tiramisu was well done that I almost did not want to eat it due to how pretty it looked - but boy oh boy it tasted like heaven. For drinks my friend got a Mimosa which was good, however she stated there was no sweetness meaning the ratio of champagne to orange juice was greatly leaning towards champagne. I got the Strawberry Blonde Martini which was delicious and it tasted very fresh with each sip which was nice. Another super plus to Tavern on Rush is that valet parking is only $16.99 which is great for the city in my opinion.

My husband and I were here this past Saturday night around 9:30pm. We ordered the Pineapple infused vodka and we were not satisfied with the drinks. We have had many infused vodka drinks at other very reputable establishments in Chicago and never had a problem with our drinks.   The drinks that were brought were straight pineapple infused vodka on the rocks. They were very weak that it tasted like water on ice with a splash of pineapple. So we asked Katrina, our waitress to send them back bc we were not happy with them.  A manager came over to our table and immediately challenged us on our explanation for sending the drinks back. When we explained again that we have  a great deal of experience with infused vodka and these drinks were very watery, he argued that they do not water down their drinks. Our concern is simply the beligerante attitude and continued argument by the manager. We are not sure if the lack of personable experience (since he was pretty young) or if that is just his way of handling any situations.  Fortunately our waitress, Katrina, brought over two old fashions that met our expectations and we continued to join our evening. We were gonna head out and cancel our order bc of this manager's way of handling this, but our waitress was very attentive which is why we decided to stay.

2016-10-25,4.0,"Reliable drinks with pretty decent unhired entertainment. Ordered: Southside, Strawberry Blonde, pepperoni/anna bella pizza,  CLIENTELE:  My favorite part was the unhired entertainment. A really drunk white dude singing songs loudly and walking around trying desperately to hug every woman in the place. A pair of two young, smartly dressed women who were in command of a harem of men competing desperately for their attention. A young working gal in a green sparkly dress who was trying to seal the deal with a John, any john. Excellent crowd. 5/5.  DRINKS: Drinks were okay, not super strong, but they get the job done. The strawberry blonde was very smoothie-like in texture, which was a bit off-putting. That's due to the strawberry puree. But they made up for it with the Southside. The Southside was nice and boozy.  FOOD: The Pizza was very good. Very hot, and very cheesy. I went on both Sunday and Monday, and the pizza was certainly hotter the second time around because the trip from the oven to the table was shorter.  SERVICE: Very friendly service both upstairs and downstairs. The woman upstairs was super funny and very open. The ladies downstairs were beautiful and helpful.  ATMOSPHERE DOWNSTAIRS: Dressy, but certainly not formal. I was wearing a cream catsuit and knee high boots and didn't feel out of place at all.

The waiters and waitresses were all very friendly and continuously asked us if the food was good and if we needed anything. The menu itself is large, only thing I wish there was more variety of was the appetizers. Most of the appetizers were seafood related, and I, personally, am not the biggest fan of seafood and would have appreciated a little more variety. Since the appetizers were so limited, we had the humus, the pita bread is great! And that's saying a lot because I'm picky with my humus and pita bread. My brother ordered the chicken breast which came with a garden salad and throughly enjoyed it. I ordered the rigatoni pasta alongside the chipotle Mac and cheese. Clearly I'm a pasta lover and it's my goal to try every single Mac and cheese option out there! The rigatoni was the bomb! I ordered the smaller portion and still couldn't finish it all.

It was fairly busy but I was still surprised when it took 20 minutes for our server, Molly to return with our drinks. We then placed our entree orders. My cousin ordered skirt steak, I ordered a ribeye sandwich with no chipotle mayo and a side of au gratin potatoes, my other cousin ordered the ribeye sandwich and a side salad. After 20 or so minutes, Molly comes and serves our order. Immediately, I removed the bun and its just slathered with mayo. We check Kim's to make sure they didnt get mixed up, but sure enough, mayo there too. We wait for Molly, finally she appears and I inform her of the issue. No empathy, no apology, she just whisks the plate away with a promise to return with a corrected version. Less than 10 minutes later, she appears with a new sandwich. This one didnt have any mayo on it.. but it also didnt have the carmelized onions, had literally four shreds of fontina cheese on it that werent melted and the bread wasnt even warm, much less toasted or grilled..  I called Molly over and expressed my dissatifaction. Still. No apology , no acknowledgement that my party is almost done eating while I havent begun. She asked if I wanted her to take it back, I told her to just go and bring me some fontina. When she came back, I realized that the sandwich was so cold, the cheese wouldnt even melt.

She was hanging on the phone for quite some time, while I was obstructing the path of all the waiters with my stroller. Finally, the receptionist noticed us - and sent us to the second floor. Seriously, such a breeze to climb again! Upstairs we were notified immediately that soon there would be a large party of people. I don't know how we could mess with that, but our waiters were more than willing to show us that our prolongated stay is so unwelcome. They were serving us really fast, but oh boy, how quickly they started taking our leftovers from us! They didn't even ask if we were still working on our appetizers. I clang to my salad to finish it - and still they managed to take my knife from me! The food itself was not so good. The calamari is great, but the burgers are plain and not delicious.

I chose Tavern on Rush because I'm not into big Easter brunch buffets that are like $50/per person and just wanted to go somewhere with an awesome regular brunch menu.  When we got there, the patio was poppin'. The weather was grrrrrrrreat today! We checked in with the hostess and were seated immediately. Our server was mostly attentive until it was time for the bill. It took a little while for him to bring the bill to the table, but I think he had a bunch of tables that were sat at the same time that he was trying to take care of so it was no biggie at all. Really, he was excellent.  My parents and I all ordered pretty simple dishes - two eggs with meat and toast for my mom, an eggs benny for my dad, and a smoked salmon eggs benny for myself. All the portions were pretty hearty, and we ended up taking home a lot of food. For appetizers, we ordered fried calamari and oysters. The calamari was good, but I was not a fan of the oysters at all. I actually had to spit some of them out because I felt like I was getting parts of the shells in my mouth.

2016-03-18,2.0,"I was visiting Chicago last weekend and stayed at the Thompson Chicago. We looked for a brunch spot for Sunday and didn't want to travel too far from the hotel and settled on Tavern on Rush. I now wish we had just stayed at our hotel.  No wait for a seat at 11am on Sunday. The decor was typical tavern/pub style with dark wood, tall pub tables, and checkered tablecloths. The bar counter top looked at as though it could use a little sanding and refinishing. I was a little intrigued by the flashy Louboutins on rotating display in the center of the bar (hostess later explained this was for their ladies night).  We began by ordering a glazed donut that looked to be advertised from a local bakery. It was very doughy and tasted as though it had been prepared the day before. Not the fresh, light and airy glazed donut I was hoping for. The table next to us also ordered a donut, this one being chocolate, and they didn't eat more than 2 bites.  Next we ordered Bloody Mary's which were another disappointment. If you like your bloody mix to be very watery with no flavor or spices, then this is the bloody for you. If you, like me, enjoy a Bloody with texture and flavor, do not order from here. ZingZang makes an amazing Bloody mix and they would seriously improve theirs by switching mixes. I ordered the crab cake eggs Benedict and my friend order the regular eggs Benedict. Both were OK. No bad, but not good. The crab cake itself seemed tasty, but the Hollandaise sauce was everywhere so it was hard to get a good taste. It was all on top of the largest English muffin I've ever seen, which was weird because normally the crab cake takes the place of the eng muffin. The side potatoes needed salt and pepper badly.

As a Chicago native, they treat the tourists better than the locals, which i think is insane. Every great restaurant will always give preference to locals who will support your business through thick and thin. Overall, over the past years I've seen the food on a downward spiral as far as quality. Im happy another quality establishment such as Maple & Ash has opened up nearby to provide good food in the area. I would suggest to the owners of Tavern and Rush to treat their loyal following in a way the rewards their loyalty"".",0.9776,0.752,0.228,0.021,0.5791666666666667

But I was pleasantly surprised with their menu. They had some delicious offers.  I was very happy with our pizza choices.  We got several and one of the best ones that came out was the Margarita pizza.  It was on a great thin crust and all the ingredients tasted terrific.

Who ever the blond haired girl behind the bar was on 10/29/2015 was the rudest person I have encountered there. She took our order, asked if we were running a tab. I said yes and gave her my card. She looked at me and wouldn't take the card and started doing something behind the bar, so I placed it on the counter. No big deal. We ordered 2 glasses of wine and 2 glasses of water. She came back and refilled my husbands glass and the man next to him, but not mine. (Does she want a tip or not?) Lastly, we were ready to leave and I asked her for the check. She came back and said my credit card was declined twice. I asked her to manually type in the numbers and she said ""no"" because she already tried twice. Clearly she is trying to embarrass me. I use this card on a daily basis and I used it after we left there and 3 times for business the next day! My husband ended up paying the tab.

Once we asked for our food, it magically appeared, but the burger bun was burnt and the food was not hot.  The quality of the food overall was not good, either.   We were not pleased given the prices at Tavern on Rush and the other strange encounters we'd had already during our visit.  We gently explained our dismay about the wait and burned food to the waiter and he coldly responded, ""well do you just want another bun?""  He offered no apology (or anything else, for that matter).   When I go to a nice restaurant, I expect good service, good food, and a nice atmosphere.  You won't find any of that at Tavern on Rush.",-0.8353,0.801,0.077,0.123,0.5621428571428572

My first time at Tavern on Rush may have been my Senior year or H.S for lunch while shopping on Rush street for graduation shoes. I recall my friends & I having this chicken BBQ pizza & some other items but I can only remember the pizza because it stuck out with extreme taste & flavor. Rush street is such a busy and popular strip in Chicago especially in the summer months as the restaurant patios are open and busy and I absolutely LOVE the entire feel in addition to the food. The valet service is prompt and the hostesses are very welcoming, I LOVE the fact that they take your phone and provide a ticket (like coat check) if you inquire about having it charged. How cool is that? No phone during dinner so you can pay attention to your company and to the server as they present the specials and provide suggestions. GO TO FOOD DINNER: Our Favorite straight from the menu item is the Filet Mignon Oscar Style Medium-Well. Or any FISH selection on the SPECIAL for the night menu, Ooh MY you can't go wrong with the chef special especially when it's Salmon or some type of fish. GO TO FOOD LUNCH: HandMade Salmon burger, let me say that again HANDMADE SALMON burger.. This salmon burger is like no other, it's made in house and full of flavor.

The Chipotle mac and cheese had a nice kick but not overly spicy.  Aside from the stale bread accompanied by off putting chips served at the start of dinner the food was excellent.  However, the service was lacking.

2015-04-16,3.0,"The SETTING:  Dinner with a co-worker on a Tuesday evening The VIBE:  3.5 Stars - This really depends on where you are seated at the restaurant.  The fun adn vibrant outdoor area (5 stars on a good weather day) does NOT take reservations, so arrive early or be prepared to wait if that is where you want to be seated.  The downstairs indoor area is where the (from the looks of it) serious business people are seated.  Upstairs (where we were seated) seemed to be more families and people dressed casually.  I would have preferred to be seated downstairs, but oh well...rookie lesson at this place. The SERVICE:  2 Stars - our server meant well but was slammed.  It took 15 minutes for our first drink order and 20 minutes for our second round.  The appetizer we ordered was never delivered...our consolidation prize was a complimentary dessert as an apology, which was only ok. The FOOD:  3.5 Stars - The salad was dissappointing and we never received our appetizer...but the steaks were actually very good, and the side of potatoes au gratin were excellent! The Bottom Line:  If you come here, arrive early, sit outside, and order steak.  According to friends, the service is normally great, so I am witholding judgement.  Otherwise, plenty of other good options in the area.",0.9886,0.797,0.183,0.02,0.4883333333333334

So, to my surprise, I had an awful experience when I went for lunch on a Sunday. From the second we sat down, we were instantly disappointed. Before we had a chance to even look at our menu, our waiter was badgering us for our order. After we ordered drinks and told him we wanted time to review the menu, he then proceeded to disappear for 15 minutes. We were presented with a brunch menu, which neither of us were in the mood for and asked for a lunch menu. He told us they did not have one on the weekends and said we would have to wait until 3:00 pm for their dinner menu. After a few minutes, he unwillingly brought us a dinner menu and even though he said we'd have a problem ordering off of it, we didn't.  We also had to remind him to bring our salads and appetizer (the tuna tar tar...which was literally a hunk of avocado covered in soy sauce). The most upsetting part though was that he was hardly trained. We had to ask for silverware, plates, water, all basic things when serving anyone, let alone what's supposed to be a premier restaurant in Chicago.  But the worst part?  He didn't even bring us dishes or silverware!  We had to constantly grab things from other tables.  I am so beyond disappointed...this was a completely different restaurant from other times I have visited.

We ordered one particular app, the grilled calamari, and it was just pieces of grilled calamari- no sauce, no lemon, nothing! That was just mediocre at best. The tuna tartare was incredibly sweet and it had these really gross hard, crunchy noodles sprinkled all over it. We had to try and pick those out as best we could. The best thing we had were the cajun shrimp. And it was such a small, tiny appetizer. Especially for the price. Not worth it. The waitresses were very very inattentive. We were honestly seated for 15 minutes and we kept trying to wave her down. She seated a group of guys and was taking pictures with them and tending to them when ever they needed anything. Getting service from her made our stay frustrating. So, we went to Gibsons after that so we could feel satisfied. I wish a manager had walked by to ask us how our experience was going.

I show up and the man standing behind the hostess counter (looked like a manager) does not even look up from his phone to greet us. Didn't take a name, tell us one minute or even acknowledge our presence. That akward moment went on for a minute or two,  He finally leaves his post walks by us, basically bumps into me and walks outside. I thought he was a drunk customer untill I noticed him addressing the staff outside. It was unbelieveably rude. Meanwhile the actual hostess is striking up conversation with someone else and finally decided to come over and try to seat us.  Hostess finds our reservation, and asks and elderly gentlment to seat us. I've dealt with the older man before and he is usually a delight. He smiles and tells us ""two minutes,"" It seemed strange since open table had this place available at every slot and we had a reservation so it wasn't like they were lacking empty tables. Anyway I wait for another 5 minutes while the gentleman is making phonecalls on his cellphone and everyone basically ignores us. I'm pretty laid back and I can wait 5 minutes to be seated. Anyway some other clients come in who seemed like his friends, he embraces them makes small talk and then escorts them to the bar area. I get it, some clients are a little more VIP then others they can be seated first, it's not the end of the world.  Anyway ten more minutes have gone by, the gentlemen still hasn't returned, no one at the place has acknowledged us in the slightest. Again table availability was not the issue, anyone else couldve seated us or said something. But after being ignored at every turn, I just had enough and walked out.

2015-01-02,2.0,"Ummmmm no. After my grandfather died, we migrated from the other Newman staple in Viagra Triangle, Gibson's, across the street to the less-stuffy TOR - and for a while I was pleased with the switch - larger salads, fresher fruit, better omelettes, and no watching the ever-frisky Grandpa N lightly sexually harass our 25y/o waitresses - welcome changes, I dare say (though RIP Edward, clearly) - but in the last few years, I've just been bored as eff with anything Tavern attempts to feed me. While the menu is large enough that anyone will find something to nosh on - even your vegan bestie who can usually only breathe air at a typical Chicago brunch spot (delicate we ain't in the Midwest) and your ""celiac"" cousin - the food just is bland and uninspired - the stuffed French toast is overly saccharine, the Azteca salad, even w corn salsa, lacks any heat, and their ""glazed and infused"" doughnuts are flat and without merit - and certainly not worth the extra time you'll need on the treadmill to continue to fit into your size 2 Lulus.  But okay, you say, the food has seen better days - but really, what's so offensive? Answer: the total sh-tshow that service has disintegrated into - most recently, though we were one of 6 tables in the entire place, it was horrid - absent, unfriendly, unknowledgeable - and dare I even add...unattractive? B/c obvioussssly that matters. If you're seated in a section w a bald dude w thick Ray-Ban frames, exit the premise immediately.

It exemplified everything I detest about a restaurant: female servers who are unfriendly/biased against female patrons, disjointed and unorganized, overpriced and mediocre food, an indeterminate atmosphere that is simultaneously tacky and snooty. If Yelp permitted 1/2 stars, I'd give Tavern on Rush 1.5 stars based on the decent food and okay dinner service...but no.  1) ""Female servers who are unfriendly/biased against female patrons"": Look, I get the gender bias in the service industry - a definite belief exists that men always pick up the tab and that men are better tippers. Heck, I've flirted with many a dude-dominated table in college as I waited tables (I may or may not have even been wearing orange shorts at the time).

But our experience (me and my two girlfriends) in the downstairs bar, from the hostesses to the cocktail waitresses, varied from forgetful indifference to impatience. 2) ""Disjointed and unorganized"": I should have figured something bad when I had no problem booking a reservation via Opentable for a table for 2 at 7 PM, two nights prior. Then a third girl decided she could make our Chicago trip, and I had no problem modifying the reservation online and bumping the reservation to a table for 3 at 7:30 PM. We arrived at the restaurant 30 minutes early and asked the hostesses if she thought we could get a table early. She said to come back around 7:20 PM and it shouldn't be a problem. We managed to get a table in the bar area while we waited with some wine. We got up in 5 minute increments to check on our table, each time the hostess looked surprised and confused that we kept 'bothering' her. She told us that there were ""two tables ahead"" of us - which doesn't make any bloody sense if I had a confirmed reservation. Ultimately we lost our bar table and stood around awkwardly until they finally seated us - at 7:45 PM.  *One of my girlfriends overheard one of the hostesses mention that had forgotten our reservation. There was never a single apology or acknowledgement whatsoever for the delay.  3) ""Overpriced and mediocre food"": The food wasn't bad, but it WAS overpriced based on what you got. If you're going to charge me Jeff Ruby's (regional) or Ruth's Chris (chain) prices, I'm expecting food of that quality. My girlfriends ordered an asparagus/prosciutto/arugula pizza (tasty, but dry); duck sausage and squash risotto (great flavor but again dry and clumpy but the Arborio rice was still too crunchy, yikes); some pasta and prosciutto dish (forgettable, none of us thought it was great). We also had bread: the sliced baguette and the rye with golden raisins were COLD and served with ice-hard butter, but tasty; the focaccia tasted like leftover pizza. However, all of this food was hearty and reasonably priced and decently tasty. But I am still underwhelmed by my entrée: I ordered the 12-oz. filet mignon, med-rare ($45). It came with just a side salad, which was a complete joke: tossed salad, topped with sliced mushrooms and mushy chopped tomatoes and a side of bottled bleu cheese dressing. COME. ON. The steak was perfectly seasoned, but looked almost forlorn squatting alone on its plate. It was inconsistently cooked, as some parts were perfect and other parts were grey and way over-cooked (well done).  However, our server ""Frank"" was very friendly and eager-to-please, which was a nice change from the female staff downstairs in the bar area. The only area of irritation was when another server brought our check (this is a no-no in my book for an ""upscale steakhouse""), didn't ask if we wanted it split (we're all generous and friendly types but again, COME ON) and we just sat there for another 10 minutes before I flagged our original server down and had to request that the check be split.   4) ""Indeterminate atmosphere that is simultaneously tacky and snooty"": The outdoor seating looked nice, with good heat lamps (too cold for us three still). Downstairs looks like a ritzier Applebee's bar with provocatively dressed cocktail waitresses with wildly teased hair; the upstairs dining area was aiming for ""upscale"" steakhouse (white linen cloths, etc.), with what appeared to be an all-male waitstaff and some sort of equestrian theme. The equestrian theme was a joke, as we are all from Kentucky and noticed that a sign for Keeneland was spelled ""Keenland.""  I can only assume that TOR is as busy as it is because it is located in a touristy, high-profile locale (Viagra Triangle, no less).",0.9842,0.87,0.075,0.055,0.5501950497713209

Next the food, I was extremely disappointed with the food as I had heard unbelievable reviews about Tavern.  We ordered the calamari and potsickers to start.  Although the potsickers came out 5 minutes after we ordered them (possibly even faster, no joke) they were cold in the center.  Two people in our party ordered the filets and a side of the white cheddar au gratin potatoes for the table.  These items were just about the only thing enjoyable during our experience.  I ordered the 12 oz lobster tail.  The lobster came out over cooked.  It was very chewy and did not have the type of crunch bite that shellfish is supposed to have. We did not even waste our time on dessert.  I emailed Tavern on Rush after our poor dining experience (about 3 weeks ago) and I still have not received a response.  Pretty terrible customer service if you ask me.",-0.8912,0.857,0.052,0.091,0.5659090909090909

(I see someone posted a picture of it here.)  I never had the tomato bisque, but I am willing to bet that it is the tomato bisque with some lobster meat on top.  It always tastes the same, and it is always too salty (I read this in another review by someone else too.).  Truly, if you can't change up your soups regularly, one has to wonder if they are ever homemade.  I doubt if they are, so it makes you wonder how much of the other food is canned or frozen wherever possible.  From some of the other reviews, it sounds like even the steaks may not be the best quality, and a lot of food is cold or not fresh.  Service is just OK, but sometimes my husband has to ask for coffee refills.  They should pare down the menu and change it up somewhat, and focus on improving service and food quality.",0.9104,0.834,0.112,0.054,0.5020405982905983

And the fries that it came with were completely soggy. Absolutely horrible meal.   My mom's order was okay, which is why I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1. She had the blackened cajun shrimp appetizer.

The service is professional and very helpful with any questions you may have and prompt with food, drinks, water, bread and check.  The decor is spacious for a steakhouse, no bumping seats or elbows here, but the floor is strategically arranged, so that you feel somewhat tucked away in your own space. It's decorated like a horse betting house and there are names of some of the famous racehorses written on the walls which is a creative and still elegant theme.

Then, a big group of obnoxious younger people decided to keep adding more and more friends and basically taking over our personal space while shouting at each other.

If you are BROWN and don't look like you can afford to live in the area (even though you DO live there and can certainly pay to eat out) don't go to Tavern. They will treat you like shit and like you shouldn't be there in the first place. Lastly, we waited over 45 mins for our check.

First we could barely read the menu with the very very dim lighting. Had to fold the menu in sections to get it next to the candle (can't believe I forgot I have a flashlight app on my phone) which made a huge difference when we were given the dessert menu. We ordered a bottle of wine ($55) which was very good. Husband had the small caeser salad which was large enough and he said it was very good. I ordered the wedge salad with iceburg lettuce instead of romaine as offered on the menu. Never had a wedge salad I didn't like, until this one. All of the components were separate on the plate so I had to essentially make my own salad and I did not care for the dressing at all. I had the ribeye chop and husband had the filet on the bone and we shared the augratin potatoes and grilled asparagus with hollandaise on the side. The steaks were cooked perfectly, and the potatoes, and asparagus were VERY good. The hollandaise was chilled and every time I have ordered hollandaise it was served warm which is much better. We ordered the big chocolate cake and it was BIG and very good. Coffee is just average. Total bill with tip was $275. Our server, Jodette, was very friendly and knowledgeable and service was outstanding. Note we mentioned we were celebrating our anniversary and our server congratulated us but there was no offer of a complimentary dessert etc. Everything was good, with the exception of the wedge salad and the cool hollandaise. If you don't want to travel to the city, Eddie Merlots is a great choice and one of our favorites.",0.9967,0.776,0.196,0.028,0.5358702791461412
2014-01-25,3.0,"For a place that serves glass bottled water and four types of complimentary bread even before the ritzy refreshment, I sure was underwhelmed by the actual dishes my party ordered. First of all, props to the waiter for overlooking my party's untypical casual apparel and youthful dispositions to treat us like the d-list celebs he is used to serving. He was fabulous.  I ordered the Angus burger and a glass of Pinot Grigio. I was awkwardly seated at the head of a table for 8, and kept getting bumped around by all the bus boys and food runners rounding our table. A grumbling tummy makes such misdemeanors almost unforgivable, but I managed;) The burger was super rich and possibly delicious to most, but unfortunately it was so very rich it gave me a stomach ache before I was even full. The fries were nothing special..  a bit dry and bland.The vanilla bread pudding I polished off was unparalleled. I want more. Now. If you are reading this review, understand that the bread pudding is not optional. It's so good. All in all, the main courses were decent. The service was hospitable.

2014-01-16,2.0,"To be honest, I was disappointed with Tavern on Rush. I've driven by it so many times and, shockingly, had never checked the Yelp reviews (even before I made reservations here...), but figured that such a notable restaurant in the middle of the Gold Coast had to be great. So, I picked it for our small work holiday dinner this year. And I was embarrassed. First of all, shoulda read the reviews. The waitresses' attire in the bar area is enough to make you blush around your boss. Also, I realize that I am not an old male, but the waitress treated me as if I wouldn't tip, so why bother to give me reasonable service? As soon as the two men joined, it got better... Drinks aside, dinner was a letdown too. I did enjoy the fried calamari, but the shrimp cocktail and the veggie plate left something to be desired in the appetizer round. They didn't seem fresh, nor did they have anything special or different about them. My filet mignon was, to be fair, perfectly cooked, but I wished they had more options for preparation. I was in the mood for a nice peppercorn sauce or something a little spicy, but the only option I saw was Oscar style (don't get me wrong - I like that - but calories!). The sauteed spinach was REALLY good, but the other sides were not. I can't even figure out what was on top of the roasted corn; it looked like cheese that had once been frozen and then was plopped on top and barely reheated. I was excited for the garlic mashed potatoes but I think I could have made them better at home. The atmosphere upstairs wasn't helping anything, either. I felt like the gentlemen who were serving our table were disinterested and barely there. I may also be biased from past years' dinners, but our table location was not my favorite. We were at a circular table in the middle of the dining room. At other steakhouses, we've been able to have a large, secluded booth, which has been really nice.  Even though there were some high points with the food, I can't recommend coming here when I've had such stellar experiences at places like Kinzie Chop House, Benny's Chop House, and III Forks. I'd recommend those three over this place, any day.",0.9939,0.777,0.163,0.06,0.5282246376811595

My parents and I were lucky to snag a table, thanks to our wonderful concierge at the Ritz/Four Seasons who was able to BOOK a patio spot. Unheard of. If you are lucky to get a patio seat, it is PRIME PEOPLE/CAR watching. In my opinion though, cars are on either ends of the spectrum; I saw a Buggatti (my first one!) parked next to an old BMW convertible. I also saw an electric lime-green corvette drive by. People watching is great too: I saw two ladies dressed to the nines strut out of their old Taurus...considering the area, it's no wonder you will see a lot of ""trying-to-hard."" On to the food. Nothing outstanding, but still good. The Tuna with Avocado was delish and so was their Tomato Bisque. I like my soups chunky. My mom had the Kobe burger, done rare, with Blue Cheese. I couldn't stomach the smell of the garbage truck, I mean, cheese, but my mom loved it. My dad just ordered the Grilled Calamari (good) and a small salad. FYI - This place serves LARGE portions of their main salad, so you won't have to worry about going home hungry just on leaves. Service was good, and attentive.

2013-02-02,1.0,"Well, what can I say.  We chose this place because of it's close proximity to our hotel.  There are plenty of options in this area but we decided to go with it because we had walked by it a few times and it looked nice and the menu seemed like just what we were looking for. Firstly, we were told there would be about a 5 minute wait for a table upstairs and that we could have a drink at the bar and they would come get us when our table was ready.  Twenty five minutes later my date went to the hostess and inquired about our table.  She apparently had forgotten about us and we were seated shortly after.  We were greeted by our waiter, who seemed to be a little strange.  I don't know why but he was just a little weird.  He kind of hovered over us.  Anyway, we received a bread basket and all of the bread was really cold.  It was almost as if it was frozen and just had thawed.  When I asked the waiter, he explained that they keep the bread in the stairwell and that is the reason why it was so cold.  Huh?  Really?  We then ordered the fried calamari app.  It was mostly tubes, hardly any tentacles and the marinara sauce they served with it was just pulled from the fridge.  On from there, we decided to split the 18 oz bone in NY.  We ordered sides of creamed spinach and a loaded baked potato.  The dinner arrived and the waiter cut the steak in half (we were splitting it) but then proceeded to cut the ENTIRE steak into pieces.  As he was plating the steak, a piece dropped onto the hotel tray and he just picked it up and put it on the plate!  GROSS!   Having a restaurant background, those hotel trays don't get washed every night.  Completely disgusting. I took one bite of my steak and it did have decent flavor but it wasn't very hot.  We told our server and he explained to me that ""it's a medium rare steak, it's not supposed to be hot'.  Really?  Not only was he rude and condescending but he was wrong!   End result, manager came over and apologized but never made an effort to make it right.  He seemed a little pissed off that he was having to buy the steak and sides.  We sat for another 15 minutes before the waiter decided to stroll back over to ask for a dessert order.  Not no but hell no.  We left. Never to return.  With the American steakhouse being somewhat of an ubiquitous concept you would think they would try to separate themselves as one of the better ones considering its location.

My concern is my employer has dinner reservations with clients in 1.5 weeks at Tavern during our busiest trade show of the year, and I would sincerely hate for one of our customers to be treated the way I was tonight.  I feel the issue could have been handled directly by the bartender with my friend in question instead of getting me involved & as a result making me uncomfortable by asking me about the subject matter I initially had no part in. And while we directed our customer service complaints to the manager on duty, he expressed concern but I don't feel it was genuine.   I spent $60 tonight and work incredibly hard for what I earn.  Not sure Tavern deserves my money with service like this.  After all this is considered a higher end bar, but I cannot rate it worthy of 4 stars due to our lack of service.  The higher-ups at my company will be hearing about this while I provide other dining options.

It was an obvious choice for a ""first warm/sunny day in a while"" brunch spot. We showed up at the restaurant at 1:45pm with a party of five. The hostess told us it would be 45 mins to sit outside. She told us to check back every 20 mins or so and see where we were on the list since they didn't give out pagers. While we followed her orders and checked in often, it seemed like there was no end in sight. Every time we checked in, she told us ""check back in another 20 mins..."" until it added up to longer than 45 mins. Finally, she told us the reason we had waited so long was because we were a group of 5 and only a few of their outdoor tables can accommodate us.  Fine.  The hostess then told us that she spoke with the manager and he felt terrible about our wait and the first round of drinks were on him. Well, it was now 3:00 on Sunday afternoon, so drinking was not the first thing on our mind. We kept our cool until we were seated at 3:10. We sat down, opened our menus, and realized the menus we were given were dinner menus. I stood up and walked over to the hostess to ask why we received dinner menus. Her response was ""well, we stop cooking breakfast at 3:00pm.""  This is when I lost it. I brought a group of friends together. I chose this restaurant. I am the reason my hungover friends have stood here waiting for over an hour.  We finally rejoiced as we sat down. BOOM. Dinner?  I asked the hostess to send the manager to our table. When he showed up, he again reminded us of his offer of free drinks. We said all we wanted were eggs. He said he couldn't do anything to change that, and that we should just relax and order something off the current menu. With that, I said we're leaving, and he said ""ok"" as he quickly walked away. My boyfriend reminded me that there are 1,000 douche bags on that list waiting for our table, and they could care less about us non-lamborghini folks. When the five of us all walked away shocked, we all agreed that we only went there for the outside seating and the food isn't anything to write home about. All in all, I have worked in restaurants before. Restaurants exist for customers. I worked at Nordstrom for almost two years. I learned about and practiced some of the best customer service in the world. I know what running a business is.

It was chunky and creamy, quite large in size and filling might I add. For the price, you would expect it to be huge and delicious and it was definitely just that. We ordered some wine but I don't recall which particular one we did, I think it was a zinfandel and a merlot. I ordered the Shrimp Cipriani for my entree and my partner ordered the Ribeye. I was quite stuff with the crab cake that I barely touched my entree. From what I remembered, it was creamy and the shrimps were delicious. The pasta was nicely seasoned even though I had to add extra pepper. This dish tasted much better as left overs because all of the herbs and spices got enough time to marinate and blend together.

I should have just brought your ass juice.""  Umm...then she proceeded to go ""THESE DRINKS ARE $12 DOLLARS - THESE DRINKS ARE $12 DOLLARS."" Like.... look lady, no shit they are $12 dollars which is why I want to enjoy it ... hello. Anyways, she brought the drink back and of course like I had expected it had 0 alcohol in it. At this point I didn't even want to fight with her. She had ignored me and my friend all night ... she never even came back to see if the drink was okay & if we wanted to order.

I was surprised that our situation had been recognized, but that nothing was offered to us in return.  I would think that they would at least throw us a free dessert.  The setting was beautiful, and the food truly delicious, but honestly so hard to enjoy after what we were put through.  We couldn't even order the wine we had hoped to get, as my parents would have to drive home immediately after the meal.  After the meal, I noted on the check that our wait was excessive, and the waitress kindly asked the manager to speak with us.  He listened intently, and after even MORE waiting, he asked if he could credit us something on our bill.  We really just wanted to leave.  It was 11 o'clock and my parents had a 2 hour drive ahead of them.  We thanked him for the offer and left.",0.9955,0.788,0.173,0.04,0.5282258064516129

We took forever to order our food, waffling between classic breakfast staples and some interesting variations. Our server was SO PATIENT and really let us take our time.  Auntie Fab had the blueberry marscapone stuffed brioche French Toast with a side of sausage, I had a spicy skirt steak on corn tortillas with perfect scrambled eggs on the side.

2011-03-28,2.0,"I hate having to write this review, because the steak here really is very good, in fact, possibly some of the best I've had. However, the rest of the food we had on our most recent visit greatly overshadows the excellent steak. SP and I eagerly went on the last Sunday of Oyster Fest, excited to partake in $1 oysters. We ordered a dozen raw on the halfshell, 4 of each kind that was available. When the oysters arrived, not only did they look unappetizing, but they appeared to have a sickly yellow-greenish tinge. The oysters had remnants of what looked liked seaweed (gosh I hope that's what that was) and some of the shells had barnacles on them. If the oysters had tasted fresh, we may have been able to forgive the troubling appearance, but not only were the oysters lacking any liquor (not the alcoholic kind) inside their shells, they were poorly shucked, with bits of shell all over the place, and tasted like they were fished out of the garbage instead of the ocean. The oysters were neither plump and juicy nor briny, but instead, oddly shriveled and tasted the bad kind of ""fishy"". Granted, these were $1 oysters, but a restaurant of this caliber cannot expect to serve garbage like this and maintain any sense of dignity. Aside from the god-awful oysters, we ordered the hot artichoke and crab dip which was just ""meh"", the 312 salad with salmon which SP really liked, and the petit filet with a blue cheese crust, which was excellent. The steak was tender enough to but cut with a butter knife, cooked medium rare just as we requested, and not overly salty.  One last gripe: The bread basket. I happen to be one of those people that really, truly look forward to the bread basket. There is nothing better while waiting for your food than warm, freshly baked bread with butter and a glass of red wine. The bread basket came out filled with promise, but I was sorely disappointed with each and every item in there. Each piece of bread was cold and tasted like it was purchased earlier in the week from the bakery section of a supermarket. I mean, the least you can do is warm it up and make it appear as it just came out of the oven, you know? Maybe our experience was an anomaly, but it was still the worst $150 dining experience we've ever had. The steak was great, however, and that's the only thing that saved this from being a 1-star review.",0.993,0.787,0.157,0.056,0.6512746108058609

We waited for over 2 hours before I asked the host how much longer we could expect to wait. We were told we were next, and yet a few minutes later, another reservation was called and we continued our wait for another 20 minutes before we were finally given a table (with another pretentious smirk by the host).

Why did you ignore us for such a long time?  You (not so cheerfully) served all of those around us, those who had come in after us, before hurriedly stopping at our table just to tell us you would be with us soon.  I know, I know.  You are busy!  I think devising a better system for yourself to make it to all of the tables would be wise.   When you finally arrived, you asked us if we were ready to order and said we needed a few minutes.  You turned on your heels to walk away; luckily, we shouted out, ""May we have a few coffees, please?"" before you were out of earshot.  When our coffees finally arrived, they did not come accompanied with cream and sugar, as is the coffee-serving tradition.  We had to ask (five minutes later) for some when you (finally) came back over to us.  A full five minutes AFTER that, we had to politely ask again.  Finally, my boyfriend stood up to walk over and ask you.  You continued to give a few people their checks and pour someone else's drink before giving us our cream and providing us with a very non genuine ""sorry.""   My boyfriend and I pride ourselves on our patience and cheerfulness when ordering at restaurants and talking to our waiters/waitresses.  Although we both bit our tongues, you brought us very close to our nerves' end.   Lastly, you brought over the wrong meal (about an hour after we walked in the door).  At this point we would have eaten anything.  Just please.  Give.  Us.  Food.  When our meals arrived, I will admit they were very good.  But the service just wasn't there. I hope this constructive criticism has provided you with some reason to change your servicing ways.   Sincerely, Sara P.S.

I don't think you should go around advertising dishes as being a specialty to the restaurant unless they are pretty good. This dish was not. The chicken was dry and flavorless and the fresh mozzarella was pretty much non existent. Speaking of non existent, the service is pretty bad too.

I had the 12 oz lobster tail, which comes with melted butter and a lemon wedge.  I felt like the lobster might have been slightly overcooked for my taste, but it was very good quality and tasted great with the melted butter and lemon.  It's nice having lobster without having to put in all that work. I also had a bite of the cheese pizza that some of the other people were sharing.  It seemed to be of the Chicago style thin crust variety, and I think I like that style based on how they did it.  I'd love to come back to the city, if not the restaurant, and enjoy the fine Chicago cuisine.  And this was a fine start to that.",0.9951,0.812,0.188,0.0,0.5182758620689655

Salads are typical- again, last time I went the house-salad was just off. How do you go wrong with a house-salad?! The balsamic was disgusting, even my friend (who loves balsamic-anything) said the dressing was horrible. The burgers are HUGE- and are usually always o.k and big enough to split.

I have been here three times now, and each time I've taken different people, and each time everyone in my party, including me, has left impressed. Their fare is typical American grub, but there is always a slight quirk to it that makes it memorable. I thoroughly enjoy the Chicken Sonoma salad when I'm there - the servings are plentiful, the chicken is always fresh and well seasoned, and the feta cheese, nuts and avocado dressing make it a exceptionally delish. Even the little toasted breadsticks are good, and that's saying a lot, considering they're just sticks of crackers.  The sandwiches and other salad options are also good choices - I really don't think you can go wrong here. The menu options aren't too pricey (keeping in mind the Gold Coast location, that is), so that's a plus too. The one downside is the soda - for some strange reason, they only have soda by the mini bottle, and those mini bottles don't last long if you're jonesin your caffeine fix.

I will definitely be trying one of these potato options if there is a next time.

The sandwich came with chipotle mayonnaise, sautéed onions, lettuce, cremini mushrooms and was served in a toasted onion ciabatta roll, which gave the occasional crunch.  I held out on the tomatoes and the fontina cheese.  My cooking preference for the meat was medium, and do you know what I got?  Medium.  That's right, the people in the kitchen got it right.  I'll award an extra star for that.  The meat was tender, well-marbled and full-flavored.  It got a little messy with the sauce dripping, onions and mushrooms creeping out, but that's how a good sandwich should be.  The meat and bread ratio was also right on.  As far as rib-eye sandwiches go, Tavern on Rush's version is my new favorite.  Man, the things you discover when you step out of the NJ/NYC area.",0.9669,0.864,0.101,0.035,0.5186241294936947

The place is so busy that it stressed me out, and so loud that I left with a pounding headache. I agree with others that the service is on the prissy, upity side. Nice but i felt like I was intruding in some way. I went as a double date and we were seated upstairs after over an hour wait. The decor is pretty nice. We were seated around 8:30 and didn't get out of their until around 11. I ordered the Caprese Salad which was on special that night. It was over-priced and the flavor was one-dimensional and boring. I've had my fair share of Caprese salads and this one was mediocre at best. My date had the Teryaki beef appetizer which was four bites worth of food. Tasty but almost aggravating at how small a portion it was. We also tried the loaded potato which was nothing special. Our friends ordered the baby back ribs, which were ok.  All in all, the food was nothing impressive and somehow we ended up paying an arm and a leg for it. I left feeling kind of angry that we wasted our money. I'm glad we tried it, but I would only go again if someone else planned the night.

For dinner I had the BBQ chicken pizza which was also really good and even better when I ate it cold in my hotel room a few hours later.  My boss, whom I went with. had the planked salmon which looked excellent and it must have been because she finished it all and it was huge. She had the heriloom tomato salad which also looked yummy.

But my food was so amazing I must give you props! First, you're so polite and quickly took myself and my friend upstairs to an awesome table.  Our waiter was super professional, polite and down to earth!  Before he took my drink away, he asked... ""Make sure you get that last sip!""  I appreciate your consideration! Now... the meat platter.  He came out an explained the vast array of steaks that you offer, and wow it was impressive!  You almost changed my mind of my meal, then I realized I am still on a diet and need to keep it cool. What else did I love?  The bread basket.  I'm not even a big bread eater because I'm on a perpetual diet, but I absolutely loved the tomato bread that you had in the basket.  It was delish. For an appetizer, I had the most amazing Tuna Tartare.  Being the pickiest of parties about Tuna Tartare (I'm also an a Francophile), I came into this kind of pessimistically.  And it was so fresh, tasty, and had the perfect balance of avocado and tuna.  The presentation was beautiful, especially the little cucumber and field greens thing you put around the dish. For my meal, I had the swordfish.  I've never ordered swordfish before in my life, but you've made me a believer.  It came on a bed of veggies, and had this fabulous dijon sauce.  The meal actually looked like more of dessert than a hearty seafood dish! My friend had the warm spinach salad, and now I'm going gaga for that too!  The idea seems a little gross, but the execution was fabulous!  I might go back just for that. The grand finale... chocolate tiramisu.  AMAZING!  It was so good... not soggy, not too cold, not too heavy.  It was just right.

2008-12-13,2.0,"I should start this review by saying that I am a vegetarian, so I can't really comment on the meats, which are the prime focus of a steakhouse. I was initially attracted to this steakhouse because it had an extensive menu of sides, salads, pastas, and pizzas for me while my friends could enjoy filling their bellies with dead cow. And while none of the meat eaters were disappointed, I certainly was. I started with the Tomato Bisque. It looked delicious, but was way over-salted. Then for an entree I decided to try their warm spinach salad, because it seemed like something different. It wasn't horrible, but it was one of those things that after a few bites you really just don't want anymore. It was completely bland with no dressing or sauce aside from the olive oil drizzled on the spinach.  And after looking at other sides, I really feel that this restaurant puts minimal effort into making anything tasty aside from meat. This may be okay with out Midwestern folks, but I like a bit of flavor and spice.  Finally for dessert, we split their brownie ala mode. All I can say is that it was so bad, we didn't finish it. The brownie had the texture of a Little Debbie snack cake minus the moisture that would have made it delicious. And instead of a warm fudge sauce, it appeared to be topped with Hershey syrup. The only part we found edible was the ice cream, which was light and fluffy. So basically, if you don't mind bland boring food or really just want meat, this might be the place for you.

I can even go back to Open Table and find it. What kind of customer service is that?? So the manager begrudgingly gave us a table.

Because thanks in part to the ample cleavage I was putting on display last night, someone from the table next to us sent over a bottle of wine. Pretty sweet, right? But WAIT...things get sweeter. Guess who sent over the bottle of wine? None other than Charlie Weis and the manager for the band Chicago. Charlie's superbowl ring was blinging so hard it made my eyes hurt. It was mesmerizing. Not to mention, Chicago might be one of my favorite nostalgia bands of all time. I think I started singing ""hoooooooooold me now"" a little bit too loudly at one point. So just as I'm digging into my steak salad, our nice waiter man drops by again to deliver the next piece of awesome news...""The gentlemen at the table next to you would like to pick up your dinner bill."" HOLY AWESOMENESS. This was music to my sweet little ears and my sweet little walllet...and I really must emphasize *little* wallet. So after a bottle of wine, an excellent dinner, 2 shots of tequila, and the promise of VIP treatment at Chicago's next concert, I left Tavern on Rush grinning ear to ear. I'm so happy I have boobs.",0.9946,0.779,0.202,0.018,0.5552827380952381
2007-01-10,5.0,"Sometimes I dream about their 7-layer chocolate cake.  I know Tavern gets some mixed reviews, but I like it. Yes, there are tons of dirty old men with their 20 year old gold-digging girlfriends. But it makes for really good people-watching - and I've really never had a bad meal here. Their Hawaiian Butterfish is pretty much one of the best pieces of fish I've ever had.  Ask for Joey for your waiter - he's the best!",0.985,0.628,0.334,0.039,0.4287878787878787

2006-12-13,4.0,"I went to Tavern this weekend for a friend's birthday, and let me just say that it was quite the memorable (or unmemorable--depending on your perspective) meal. Almost right as we sat down, each of us successively began began to shiver.  Soon thereafter, we were informed by our less than courteous waiter that the heat was broken.  However, rather than combat the mechanical problem with excellent service, our waiter chose instead to make snide remarks regarding both the heat and our open declaration of the poor service.  It was quite evident that he did not want to lose the table for he would be receiving the hefty tip of an 8 person meal.  Although we didn't exactly warm up to him as the meal progressed, he didn't have a second lapse of service. Needless to say, the food itself was suprisingly good.  We enjoyed the flatbread appetizer, and the steaks were said to have been tender--i would not know;  i had the pizze margherita because i am a vegetarian. I would reccomend Tavern for the food and the lively Lincoln Park environment, but the service, as mentioned above, was lackluster at best.",0.8806,0.853,0.097,0.051,0.5245149911816578

2006-12-10,4.0,"I can't really speak for the dinner scene here, because I can't remember the last time I came down here past 2 p.m..  But I really don't mind stopping in here for lunch. At my old job, I had one client who loved some type of salad on the menu and would always ""suggest"" (ok... demand) coming here. I had never payed much attention to the prices, as they were business lunches, but I never had a complaint about the meal and I tried a variety of dishes over the years.  Last week, I stopped in with a co-worker during an extra-long lunch break and I had a great time.  It wasn't too crowded (did catch that 60 business type thing though), the wait staff was excellent and the food was really good. The noise level was perfect, and nothing interrupted our conversation. I also, coming out of my own pocket this time, did not find the prices that unreasonable (just lunch maybe?), but we also did not order drinks.  I don't know that I would flock from anywhere outside the general area to grab a meal here, but if you are strolling rush street during lunch and trying to get out of the cold, I don't think it's a bad place to stop.",0.982,0.829,0.147,0.023,0.4769444444444445

I like the bar.  And haven't seen any creepy old guys during my visits (Unless Vaughnifer counts.  Come on. Maniston can be frightening at times, no?).  The service is great (but probably because the waitresses were stoked that the old Viagra men were at home carving turkeys with their age appropriate wives??) and my martinis were TOP NOTCH.  It may have a rep, but Tavern on Rush has always been kind to me.",0.8581,0.874,0.098,0.028,0.6047619047619047

Thank God.  Finally, a place in the Rush Street area that serves shrimp cocktail, steaks, chops, seafood, and huge martinis.  That's exactly what this city has been lacking all these years.  Used to be a scene here, now it's elbow to elbow with guys and dolls from Oak Lawn and Niles.  I used to love it when Michael Jordan would show up and suddenly they wouldn't allow guys wearing baseball caps in the bar, like it's upscale here or something. Look out for drunk sportswriters hitting on anything that moves and smoking nasty cheap yet overpriced Dominican cigars at the bar.  Nice narrow staircase down to the bathroom, watch your step.",0.8193,0.805,0.127,0.069,0.6944444444444445
