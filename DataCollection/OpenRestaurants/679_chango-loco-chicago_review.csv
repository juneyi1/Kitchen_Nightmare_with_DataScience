2017-08-19,1.0,"Being from California I tend to be a Mexican food snob, but I kept an open mind when I walked in. First off the service was mediocre. They seated us immediately, but we did not get table service for at least 10 minutes. My daughter ordered an iced tea and we didn't get it until after the food arrived and we had asked three different people to get it. The fish tacos were dry, the chips were stale and the quesadilla was fair. Perhaps it was an off night for the kitchen staff, but I am guessing this is normal. I should have known when every other restaurant in the area had a 30 minute wait and we walked right in to this establishment. This was not the Mexican food I was looking for and suffice it to say we won't be back. I only gave it two stars because the gal that waited on us was sweet and overworked.",0.714,0.943,0.044,0.013,0.5027529761904762

Amazing guy And then the water was  Placed quickly on the table by a very smiling irishman. Gasper was very attentive, asking us where we were from and whats our occasion,  and then right into his dialogue. Explaining all the drinks and food. He was,a great sales man. My kids loved him. He was positive and not one mistake.  Trust me we are very picky and the children are always ready to make it hard,  but he was great. I was surprised how great the food was and how quickly it came out. Drinks amazing. I recommend the margaritas.  Pitchers. And then to top it off beautiful fire works.

2017-06-06,1.0,"My parents and I stopped her for lunch after an amazing boat tour this past Memorial Day weekend and lets just say the whole experience was pretty much sub par.  To start off we sat at our table for a good 10 minutes before a single person greeted us. When our server finally came over, he was unable to answer ANY questions we had regarding the menu (which granted he may have been new, but that is part of your homework is to know the menu front and back). After our drinks took probably another 10 plus minutes, we told him we were ready to order and he said he'd be right back... Surprise Surprise.... we had to wait AGAIN for another 10 or so minutes until we reminded him.  So we gave him the order.... 30 minutes pass and every table around us has their food (some of them came in after us) and we don't have ours. The sever goes back to ""check with the kitchen"" and comes back to tell us that the ""ticket never went through"". Now I used to work in a restaurant setting and I understand sometimes mistakes happen, but you are ALWAYS best to just own up to your mistakes. We were VERY AWARE that he had just forgotten to put our food in, because the food was clearly not made ""on the fly"" and we were never confronted by a manager of any sorts, so he just never told anyone of authority.  When we finally received out food, it was just really lacking flavor and honestly not that hot. I think the thing that really just rounded this out as a bad experience is that with 3 dishes and a margarita pitcher our bill was over $120. WAY TOO PRICEY for the experience. We spent less with an amazing view up in the signature room on the 96th floor of the John Hancock.  If you haven't already gathered, I would just definitely not suggest wasting your money at this place. Even the view isn't worth the money.",0.9738,0.839,0.115,0.046,0.4670691287878787

We saw chips/salsa on several other tables, but our waitress hadn't brought them or offered...so we assumed they were an additional charge (which would have been ridiculous for a Mexican restaurant). After our food came, I finally asked if they came with our food order. She replied, ""I can get you some if you like."" I asked her if there was an additional charge. She replied, ""No, they're complimentary."" *irritated face* So apparently they're complimentary IF you ask for them. Ridiculous.  Service 2: One of my biggest pet peeves is when a server fails to give me the proper change from my bill. She shorted me 50 cents, and never said a word about it. Yes, it's a small amount but proper restaurant etiquette would dictate that you at least mention it to me if you don't have any coins available.

2013-08-16,1.0,"Stopped here a couple of days ago with a friend - I ended up with a chicken wrap and she had a burrito. Meh. Food was plentiful, but bland at best. Hello!  If you want BLAND food, would you choose a Mexican restaurant? I don't think so. But, the chips and salsa were pretty good, the beer was cold, the view from the upper level patio was good, and unlike every other place on Navy Pier, it was half empty and had no wait. Maybe this last part should have tipped us off.  Anyway, went back a couple of days later with a few more friends, and; 1) Had to seat ourselves. Stood at the entrance in front of the PLEASE WAIT TO BE SEATED SIGN for 5 minutes with no help in sight, looking at a bunch of empty patio tables, and finally just sat ourselves.  2) Had the waitress finally come up and say ""Oh. Did you seat yourselves?"" with that look like, how dare you?  3) Then she asked whether we were eating or just drinking, and when we told her we going to have a couple of drinks and may or may not eat, she said ""Oh, well you'll need to sit out there near the entrance. This area is for dining only."" We couldn't believe it. We were surrounded by empty tables and really, could have gone anywhere on the pier for a drink. We were doing them a favour by wanting to spend our money there. Plus, two of us had just eaten there a couple of days before, and we all would probably have ordered dinner after our drinks anyway. They were just real dicks about it. So we asked to speak to the manager. After a brief confab - in spanish, right in front of us at though we weren't even there - he agreed that we were fine where we were.  4) So we think that's settled, finally. Except then nobody would serve us!! We could see the waiters standing in a group about 30' from us, looking our way and talking, but no one would come to our table. We eventually got up and left.  So in summary, I would DUMPSTER DIVE before every going back to this place. Seriously, only go here if you have a deep sense of self-loathing.

The special came with 3 jumbo shrimps (which were pretty good I'd have to say), and a slice of steak, served with rice, beans and guacamole. All the side orders were OK. But the steak was way overcooked. We couldn't chew it even after cutting it into little pieces.  The service wasn't so great either: music way too loud; it took them forever to get anything.

I added some Tapatio to help the cause, but it didn't. The tacos, while small, were quite tasty.  I had one of each:chicken, pork,and beef.  They only come with cilantro and onions, though, so I requested sides of cheese and sour cream.

So last Sunday (09/21/08) while visiting Navy Pier we decided to have lunch there again. I ordered the enchiladas and my wife the veggie burrito (kids had hotdogs/fries).  My first thought on seeing the food was 'what a large serving' considering it was lunchtime. But after TWO bites... I called my waiter over and sent that CRAP back! I have never in my 43 years ever.. EVER had such putrid food served to me. I would've enjoyed a dead rat better. The sauce was disgusting.. it tasted like generic tomato soup made by some fourth-world country in the 15th century. The 'steak' consisted off tiny bits (about a 1/4 the size of my fingernail) of some undetermined meat (hell, it might have been dead rat). This was rolled up in a tortilla that had the consistency of two week old, second-hand bread. While I was sending my food back, my wife was helping our sons get situated and then she took a bite of her food and I thought she was gonna projectile vomit like you see in the movies. She gagged so hard I thought she might have swallowed her tongue. Her 'veggie burrito' consisted of huge spoonfuls of guacamole and minced onion/tomato mixture served with tortilla chips and shredded lettuce that was so wilted it looked like it spent days in the rain before being left out to dry. Even our sons hot dogs were served on bread that was falling apart like it was days old (fortunately, they only eat the hot dogs anyway.. so the bread wasn't a concern.)
