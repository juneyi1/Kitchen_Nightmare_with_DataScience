It was only after the two gentlemen were asked what they thought of everything and responded with a condescending remark (which is typical for some self entitled, pompous ass) about the service is when the bartender snapped because you see Tommy C you may have felt unjustly attacked and that is why you felt the need to belittle someone via Yelp, however you failed to mention the two glasses that were broken and you weren't charged for them but you want to bitch about a few dollars.

Pat S. here,   Some friends and myself stumbled into Mac's American Bar and Establishment Venue on a Monday night in June to watch the final Stanlee's Cup Match between the American Chicago Blackhawks (racial) and the American Boston Bruins. We only came here because Anthem was really crowded and the bald man at the door, Mac, was very nice and lured us in.    The bar was crowded and we didn't have a place to sit. There were enough TVs for us to watch our Hockey match so that was fine. We ordered some PBR beers and had some sips. I was wearing a large backpack full of MacBooks and I was hitting everyone with it. Everyone was pissed. There aren't a lot of good places to stand. Deal with it. I got $1 million worth of product in there!   Then what do you know a drunken man on the sidewalk throws a 40oz at the window! I couldn't tell if it was a Mickeys or a Colt 45, but it make a big loud bang and shattered the window! A meaty bouncer ran past me to go outside and bumped me and all of my PBR went down the inside of my shirt! Can you believe that!! I used a napkin. The napkins here are pretty average in both absorbency and looks.    Anyway, the bottle thrower was swiftly tackled to the cement ground by one of the bouncers. Someone should call up Mike ""Coach"" Ditka and get that man a job at the Chicago Bears! Many scrapes and bruises and future scabs were achieved during this process. The cops came and whisked the man off to prison on Alcatraz. That's the last malt liquor beverage for him! (Unless they have 40s in prison. I don't know, I've never been.) After all the commotion died down we finally got a table and I ordered a burger and it was really average and the bun was soggy and the fries were burnt. So, three stars.

2013-01-07,5.0,"I used to live down the street from this place, and my fiance and I were absolute regulars. It's so understated yet so wonderful and the service is always stellar.  FOOD: Good Lord, this place is good. When I'm feeling like something light, the Mac's Chicken Salad is to die for. I don't know how they do it. Same goes for the Steak Salad - both salads give you a generous helping of meat on top of some seriously delicious salad complete with nuts, cheese, and fruit. When I'm feeling like something heavier, they have a DELICIOUS burger (that is really a heart attack on a plate). It's covered in smoked gouda and bacon. So rich and delicious. SERVICE: Wonderful. Everyone here is so friendly, but not in a way that is overly done or fake. One time, I was locked out of my apartment, so I walked into Mac's to sit at the bar while I waited for my fiance to get home. Yuri, the bartender, was very nice and made waiting an enjoyable experience. By the time my fiance got home, he just met me at Mac's and we had dinner and drinks there because I was so happy! What a way to turn around what could have been a really crappy evening. DECOR: It's pretty plain inside. High tables, huge comfy booths, and interesting lighting. There are TVs view-able from every angle. Plain but still classy. Honestly, I'm happy for the decor -- I think it's keeping some of the more pretentious yuppies away, which means I can get seated much faster! DRINKS: They have a decent number of beers on tap. We're always happy with the selection. They do occasionally run out of things, but they are always generous about giving you more beer to make it up to you.",0.9968,0.703,0.249,0.048,0.648970288970289

Then got the mac and cheese (did not know that you can put things in it!) which is so good, and the short ribs. Mac and cheese: SO good!  Thick fluffy twisty noodles in a ridiculously thick, creamy cheese sauce, sprinkled with a garlic salt-y breadcrumb topping.  It was great.  A bit too salty, but it comes with an entire dinner plate of salad (that's the way salads should be!)  The salad was also great, nice dressing and lightness, and not a crappy Applebee's-like salad either.  Real vegetables.  Loved this dish.   Short ribs: super tender, had no ribs in them which was confusing.  Reminded me of stewed beef-meets-carnitas.  Came with a heap of forgettable herbed mashed potatoes and delicious blackened green beans with something salty sprinkled on them.   Overall, the food was a little salty, but really remarkably good for dive bar food.  We enjoyed it!",0.9947,0.774,0.202,0.024,0.5485632183908047

Same old 30-something guys who think they are still seniors in college and can act obnoxious and drunk. The crowd is unbearable.  Still keeping my 1 star rating. I burned this place to the ground with my stare as I walked away.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Update 12/15/2007: I am demoting this review from 2 stars to 1 star after my experience with ordering a take out. I called earlier to order food for take-out and this is how the conversation went: Me: Hi, I would like to place a take-out order please Waitress: What? (loud music in the background) Me: (repeat myself) Waitress: Why don't you come here, have a beer, and order from the bar? Me: No, because it is very smoky in there and it makes me gag Waitress: OK Me: So, I can order the ribs to go? Waitress: I cannot hear you Me: (repeat myself) Waitress: What? I hung up! Don't tell me that I should come in and order from your bar. The reason I don't want to eat inside your restaurant is because it is like a smoke pit (see my earlier review below).....and you cannot hear me because the music is too loud...step away from the under the speakers, it will help ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I live very close to this place and decided to check it out. I went in and couldn't breathe with all the smoke. I couldn't even see till the end of the restaurant with the haziness. The music was too loud, almost to the point of noise. Horrible!! it was hard trying to get attention of any of the waiters. They did not seem keen on providing any kind of service. I ordered take out because there is no way in hell I will hurt my lungs and ears. I went back home and returned after 15 minutes and my order was ready. I got a chicken sandwich, mac and cheese, and the ribs. The ribs were good and I liked the french fries because they had skin on them. The chicken in the sandwich was dry and chewy. The mac and cheese was just OK.  Definitely not worth going unless you like to inhale large amounts of second hand cigarette smoke. I can't wait for the ban on smoking to kick in.",-0.8679,0.797,0.093,0.11,0.5476540616246499
2007-05-27,3.0,"It's hard to compete when you're across the street from Smoke Daddy's. The mac and cheese was good and the food was alright though the french fries had skin on them and tasted like actual potatos, a good thing! The service was prompt and skilled though when I asked for water it came in a plastic cup and tasted like it came out of a garden hose. Sorry, I expect a little more than feeling I'm at the front yard lemonade stand.  Not bad food though and a better place to go if you're looking to suck down beers and watch the game instead of eating. Not someplace you look forward to going or somewhere I'll rush to again though.",0.8129,0.793,0.136,0.071,0.47670940170940174

The food is good and specials on drinks are solid. They have huge booths, so its great for a group to meet out for dinner. Cabs are plentiful outside as well. I've had the pizza appetizer as well.

2007-04-02,1.0,"After spending a few noisy hours at Moonshine, we decided to go somewhere more low-key and head down the street to Mac's.  No complaints about the actual bar - nice neighborhood joint, many beers on tap. HOWEVER, we will never go back there for the following reason... They called last call so all 6 of us got a drink from the bartender.  Literally less than 5 minutes later, they were yelling at us - and the 10 other people in the bar - to get out.  We gave the door guy a hard time about it; he was pretty cool and took it in stride - he knew it was a shitty move on their part.   The bitchy bartender, on the other hand, said ""you guys act like you've never been in a bar before!""  Are you kidding me?  That's just BAD BUSINESS to have 6 people drop money on a round, then kick them  out before they're even able to take a sip?!?  Someone needs to teach them how to run a bar... and how to treat their customers!  We'll go to Gold Star next time we're in the hood.",-0.6756,0.798,0.09,0.112,0.36777777777777787
2007-03-16,4.0,"I love this bar because of the food- Grilled salmon, duck, filet mignon...you wouldn't expect the menu selection, but everything I've had has been great. I'm surprised at the number of people who have encountered a long wait here. I usually come during the week, easily get a table and get decent service. The prices are a little more expensive than at most bars, but you're not paying for normal bar food here.",0.9343,0.806,0.194,0.0,0.6041666666666666
2007-03-01,3.0,"Way better food than you'd expect for a bar and waaaay more obnoxious crowd than you'd expect for a bar next to Goldstar. Seriously, I don't understand what it is about this place that attracts this kind of clientele. Every dude in there is a complete tool. Brunch is the worst; Frat boys screaming about sports while you try to eat. The service is a mixed bag but can be good. There's at least one very nice, down to earth waitress who has served me two of the three or four times I've been here. The rest seem to be emotionally vacant transplants from Lincoln Park. If you can deal with the atmosphere, the food is surprisingly good. My favorite is the pizza appetizer with sun dried tomatoes. It's honestly some of the best pizza I've ever had and I don't know why don't make it entree-sized. The burgers are good, so is the grilled cheese. Stay away from the tenderloin sandwich; it can be really grissly/stringy and is clearly not made with anything like an actual tenderloin. I mean come on, if it was it would cost $35. Who are you guys trying to kid? If you can get one of the tables in the back near the bathrooms, do it. It's quieter and actually pretty cozy. Unfortunately they're usually filled up by the stroller mom's who sip cocktails for three hours at a time while their kids have ketchup fights and play with the arcade game.",0.99,0.764,0.176,0.06,0.5658796296296296
2006-11-21,4.0,"This is actually more like a 3.5 star rating... If you think of this place as a bar - which it is - it's pretty darn good. I particularly enjoy the beer selection, they have a rotating beer in the cask as well as a nice selection of beer by the bottle/can/pint. Music is reasonably good as well. Wait staff was pleasant and prompt. I can definitely see myself going back many times. Plus, I can walk home - and pick up La Pasadita on the way...",0.9783,0.703,0.297,0.0,0.6166666666666667

The bartenders are always pretty cool, but there are some grumpy ones at night. I'd say it's a casual place to hang out with friends, have some decent food and soak in Wicker Park while looking out the large windows.
