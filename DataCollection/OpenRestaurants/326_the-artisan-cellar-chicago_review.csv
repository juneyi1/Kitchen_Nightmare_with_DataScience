Artisan Cellar reminds me of a cosy cheese and wine shop made for after work happy hours and tastings. This place is BUSTLING at lunch time so be ready for the no frills customer service when placing your order. My chicken and rice soup was delicious and I loved seeing they had elote on the menu as a side option. From placing my order to walking out the door, the entire experience took about five minutes. Note that they also offer sandwiches and salads. I loved the warm bookstore-ish /Old English vibe of the shop. Had it been less busy, I would have lingered much longer.

Stopped by for lunch  after wandering around the Merchandise Mart looking for it (if you enter in the Wells corner entrance, make a slight left and walk straight past all the other restaurants/galleries and make a left at the first offshoot). The shop itself is super cute and offers an amazing selection of wine. I got the beefeater panini and a chili soup, the latter of which I was especially unimpressed by. The soup was, to its credit, very generously filled with meat, but the seasoning left more to be desired and the soup itself was a strangely thick, almost gelatinous consistency. The panini was much better-- again, generously stuffed with meat and warmly toasted to a nice crunch. However, the flavors were nothing to write home about, just the typical beef with horseradish.

I got the portobello and on the plus side, the star ingredient was huge and meaty. But it also had mozzarella (too much, in my opinion) that wasn't all-the-way melted and also was supposed to have a red pepper tapenade but I felt like it was chopped red pepper and also some sort of garlic mayo. Not sure, though. It's a very cute place- crammed with stuff and seems to be European owned and operated. Anyway, I walked around the wine area while I was waiting for my order and noticed that they have $13 white bordeaux and lots of other interesting wines and booze. You can get a bottle or can of beer for $3 and they have some natural sodas, too. A panini is $7.50, including tax and instead of paper receipts, they send you one by e-mail, which is nice. Overall, I think I enjoyed my panini and will definitely go back and try a different kind as well as maybe pick up some wine to go. I do wish you could ""build-your-own"" sandwich but it's a very small operation, so I get that that would be hard for them to manage.

I hate that question and I can't exaggerate my eye roll enough when I hear someone ask it as if it's black and white, two categories that everyone and their mother, brother, neighbor have to fall into.  I know they're two universally pretty popular figures in history, but I don't like either of them. At all. I've never seen any of their movies, I think all the quotes I've heard from them sounds dumb, and I don't find myself wanting to be or look like either them... Not that they aren't good looking ladies, but to me they just seem kinda basic. Coupla basic b*tches and I, personally, prefer my heroes, pin-ups, personalities, whatever they are, to be just a little less regular... just like how I like my sandwiches.  I know everyone's loving AC's sammiches, but personally, I'd go a 3 on the flavors of my Artisan Cellar Farmhouse panini... but then again, these kinds of sandwiches just aren't my style and I know I'm in the minority.  I mean, paninis are cool, I guess, but I hate when bread is hard and crusty and onions are limp, wet, and wormy, and overall I just felt like the stuff inside the sandwich was majorly boring and commonplace and the same kind of thing I've had a hundred times before. No spice, no zest, no personality. Just meh.  It was only $8, and it was size-able, but it was still what I would consider a basic b*tch's sandwich and I was hoping for something a little more extraordinary. Maybe their meat sandwiches and wine are where it's at, or maybe that this is one of the few places for noms within the merch mart that A. Is affordable and B. is decent, but if I'm in the Merch Mart again and faced with a lunchtime dilemma, I'd probably just grab a coffee somewhere to suppress the mid-day hunger over getting a veggie sandwich here again.",-0.976,0.798,0.061,0.141,0.522728129713424

If you're in the area, check it out.  It won't be a wasted trip.",0.9827,0.819,0.181,0.0,0.5190476190476191
2009-03-12,4.0,"I have a wine and cheese night with friends once a month, and this is a great place to go if I've forgotten the wine, cheese or accompaniments.  The cheese is a decent selection, and they have all sorts of jarred olives and the like to go with wine. they have a saussicon sec that is deelish. And super expensive, like 20 bucks a pound. But it's light, so 6 slices will only cost you $2.  Great bottles of wine in any price range you're looking for. The staff here is always willing to help you pick out something just right and in your price range.",0.9682,0.784,0.199,0.017,0.7119047619047618
2008-12-15,4.0,It has the feel of buying a sandwich in a musty old bookshop. Had the tuna. It was delicious but it may have been a little too spicy with the wasabi mayo to become a permanent addition to my lunch repetoire. I was a little disappointed that there weren't any poultry panini.,-0.3314,0.879,0.047,0.074,0.5900000000000001

2008-06-23,3.0,"After working in the Merchandise Mart for two months figured it was time to check out the Artisan Cellar which I have heard such good things about. While waiting for my lunch companion had a browse around the store and it looked like there was some really nice wine at reasonable prices.  Unfortunately I cant say the same thing about the food servers. Service isnt usually something I am bothered about but twenty minutes for a toasted tuna sandwich is bordering on the extreme. Yes the sandwich was good (just good) but I didnt appreciate at least 10 people being served before me when they ordered after me. I'm sure some of them were regulars which is fair enough but not cool to keep pushing new customers to the back of the line. I will give this place another chance, order a different sandwich and try and get there before the lunch rush when hopefully I will be able to get in and out in 10 minutes....",0.947,0.811,0.14,0.049,0.5943912812333866
2008-06-09,5.0,"This place is one of my most favorite shops in all of chicago.  1. The Wine Gregg has some really excellent wines in this shop with varying prices. When i first starting coming here i was looking for reds in the $10 range. He was helpful in finding me great wine for this price. Over time, as my taste became refined and i wanted more from the wine, he helped me find great wines for up to $15 (a real taste leap, peoples!) Now i typically spend a bit more, but there's never any snottiness or pressure to spend a particular amount.  Friday wine tastings are great. Get to know wine in a low-pressure environment, tasting a variety of wines. Often times i'll take notes and buy at a later date, or ask for recommendations based on my appreciation of a wine that was tasted. The tastings are on most fridays from 3-6pm. When i worked in the mart this was a ritual. 2. Coffee - Illy espresso and coffee drinks at a cost that's cheaper than starbucks and dunkin donuts. WTF are you doing anywhere else? the service is not as fast as one of the machine chains, but it's worth the wait. 3. Cheese and cured meats - they have a well curated selection of cheese and meats that's worth sampling. Scott will help you find your cheese of choice and open your heart to new cured meats. 4. Sandwiches - Awesome flavor! you'll have to wait a bit longer than the other sandwich places in the mart, but you can't beat the flavor. 5. The Staff - The staff here is universally knowledgeable and helpful. You won't find snobby-snooty attitudes here. This is THE place to go if you want to grow your appreciation and knowledge of fine wine and cheeses.",0.9896,0.819,0.153,0.028,0.4978484848484848
2008-05-14,4.0,"I think Jocelyn's review is right on. This place serves some great, tasty sandwiches! The wait definitely can be long - especially during the lunch rush, but it's well worth the $7 and a few extra minutes. If you're looking for a nice change of pace to your standard Potbelly's or Jimmy John's sandwich, The Artisan Cellar is the place to go.

They workers are always super nice and laid back and don't make me feel awkward coming into a ""gourmet"" type store.  The wait can be kind of long during lunch since the sandwiches are not pre-made but last time I was there the guy behind the counter happily informed me I can call ahead if I'm short on time.

2007-11-19,5.0,"I've been holding off on reviewing this place because I think it's one of the best secrets in the River North area.  The coffee is way better (and less expensive) than Starbucks.  illy coffee is used and I think it's sweeter, rounder and smoother than the bitter S-bucks and the like.   David, who works most weekday mornings, is one of the best behind-the-counter dudes around.  He anticipates and gets to know his customers.  So much so that when he sees me just entering the Merchandise Mart a good 50 feet away from the store, he's already grabbing my muffin of choice, or else throwing a shrug up in the air to indicate that he didn't get the muffins in yet, saving me and everyone else the precious morning time in getting into work.  But it's not just me, it's his other regulars.  He's ON for everyone and I love that. The cheese and wine selections look outstanding, but I haven't had a chance to try any yet!  That would require going in after work when I'm not rushing.  But so far, this place is one of my normal morning excursions and always seems to start the day off well.",0.9352,0.878,0.103,0.019,0.5444444444444444

2007-08-27,4.0,"I don't know why I've been wasting so much time and money at Dunkin' Donuts.  I mean, not that there's anything wrong with their coffee, but if I can spare about three extra minutes I'd MUCH rather go downstairs to The Artisan Cellar. I'd been terrified to go in until one day I noticed they served Illy coffee.  It couldn't be TOO bad, right?  The man I've interacted with on every visit is very friendly and patient with my inability to decide on the cheese I want.  While I haven't had the panini, the fact that they cost $6 makes me LONG for one.  The cheese selection is impressive and affordable, as is the wine collection. The only drawbacks: - There's only one man working, so the morning coffee procuring can take longer than at Dunkin', Starbucks, etc. despite the fact that I pour my own coffee.  (I have to get his attention, the cup and exchange the money, and this is the ONLY reason I can't give them 5 stars.) - There is no bread for your cheese!  I wanted cheese and bread for breakfast, but there were only crackers.  Booo, sirs.  Boo.",-0.1599,0.85,0.071,0.079,0.6893253968253968
2007-06-30,4.0,"A gem ensconced within the Merchandise Mart, The Artisan Cellar offers fine wines and a small refrigerated case that houses artisanal cheeses and cured meat products. But while you are there be sure to get a panini. During lunchtime hours, 11am to about 3:30pm, hot and tasty paninis are served. I must admit to placing an order for my usual panini of prosciutto with fresh mozzarella and a red pepper relish, then noticing that the folks that were behind me in line got theirs first. I raised an eyebrow but keep coming back.  These simple and delicious paninis remind me of the long leisurely lunches I had in Florence. If you want to brave the service and be rewarded by panini goodness, then keep these in mind when you do...  1. Try the prosciutto panini... hands down the best one I've had there. 2. Ask them to lay off the Dijon with the paninis that include it (I prefer the grain) 3. Get some wine! The have carefully picked out a small but well rounded selection...  4. Show up for a free wine tasting... usually after 3PM or so. If you find yourself on the Merchandise Mart and it's lunchtime... Think paninitime!  Cheers",0.9922,0.8,0.2,0.0,0.486583522297808
