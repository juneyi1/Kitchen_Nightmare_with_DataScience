2017-06-19,3.0,"My husband and I had dinner at The Grill last night, and have to say that we weren't too pleased. Since we arrived early around 5PM, the dining area was still practically empty. We ordered the calamari to start (tasted great, no complaints), and ordered dinner shortly after (this is when things went downhill). I ordered the lamb chops, and my husband ordered the steak salad. Our dinner took much longer than expected to arrive (we noticed multiple people arriving after us who were already paying their bills). We didn't mention anything, but our waitress also noticed the delay and was very proactive about it. When she went back to the kitchen, they informed her that they had gotten my husband's order wrong and had to redo it. Our waitress was extremely sweet and offered us a free dessert to make up for the delay. I really didn't mind the wait; the real disappointment occurred after the food arrived. My lamb chops had been burnt to a crisp. After I scraped away all of the char, there wasn't much left to eat. I really was hoping that the meal would've been worth the wait, but that wasn't the case. In the end, I left feeling hungry and disappointed.  No complaints about the service (our waitress was amazing), but I can't say the same about the chef. As this is a high-end restaurant with good reviews, I'm assuming we just ran into some bad luck with the chef, who may have been having an off-night. The free dessert was a delicious plus though!",0.8746,0.751,0.136,0.113,0.4473214285714286
2017-05-14,5.0,My wife and I were in town to see the play Hamilton. Decided to give it a shot on a friend's recommendation. I ordered the double cut lamb chop medium rare and my wife ordered the filet medium well. When they came out mine was medium well and hers medium rare. By now you're probably wondering why I gave them five stars. When we told them there was a mixup they did everything but backflips to make us happy. They brought us new entrées which were both absolutely perfect. I will definitely be back next time I'm in Chicago. Pricey...... Yes. Worth every penny......

2017-05-08,5.0,"The Grill on the Alley is a very nice and very pricey. Don't be fooled by the outside exterior because we were! From the look on the outside your thinking that this will be just another downtown watering hole...Nope! It is a very fancy high end steak house, (some may argue that it is not just a steak house). The food is very good and the portions are very filling. You may have take home if your into that. We ordered the NewYork Steak, the Braised Short Ribs and a side of Loaded Mac & Cheese. Both meals were very tasty.  The restaurant is very spacious and has a very open feel to it. The Bar area is also very lively. You will not feel like you are right next to other guests. The service is above average and the servers are not overbearing. I would recommend if you are not making a reservation before arriving that you dine during the week for dinner. It seems as if it could get crowded after 6  pm on the weekend. On a Wednesday night there was a bit of a crowd. Also, I would recommend that you come dressed to impress.

2017-03-12,4.0,"We arrived in Chicago this evening, and after a very long day we decided to just have a nice meal at The Grill which is located in the lobby of the Westin. Our server was exceptional and took great care of us. We started with the sashimi tuna as an appetizer and it was a nice start. I thought it was unusual that the tuna steak was seared on the edges, but it was still very good. They should really reduce the amount of ginger on the plate and double the delicious cucumber ribbons that came with the appetizer. They were refreshing and a great addition to the tuna. We then decided to split a bowl of lobster bisque which still left us with large individual portions. It was very good- probably the best we have had in awhile. My husband had the 14oz filet and it was nice. It could have used some butter or some type of sauce, but overall was well executed. For my main dish I had the lobster salad. The portion was perfect. The salad was loaded with lobster, tomatoes, cheese, walnuts and other goodies. The salad dressing lacked flavor. I think a vinaigrette would have been a better choice. My husband had the frangelico cappuccino which he really enjoyed. I do appreciate our server when it came to my wine selection. I initially had the corvo pinot grigio which was ok. I decided to try a glass of the match book chard next, and I didn't really like it. Our server asked if I did, and I mentioned that it wasn't my favorite but would finish the glass since I ordered it. He was nice enough to insist to swap it out for the pinot I was drinking previously. It was very nice! It was great service.",0.997,0.766,0.216,0.018,0.586281512605042

It was a generous portion pan fried in brown butter and seasoned perfectly. My dining partner ordered the crab cakes. They served two croquettes of nicely seasoned crab. A very nice sauce accompanied the dish. We also ordered skin-on mashed potatoes. They were hearty and well seasoned. The second side dish we ordered were the brussel sprouts.

Very filling which was good since for a salad it's pricey. My daughter had their hamburger.

You know how with onion rings you take a bite and it pulls out the whole onion and you're left with just the breading? These were different!

The Chop is on the ""Chef's Menu"" which is a single page and is presented along with the regular menu. In closing, make it to ""The Grill"" any time for a great meal with GREAT SERVICE.

Found a great buy on the wine list, it was a Howell Mountain 2007 Cabernet for $112 which I thought was great. See picture. Kids got the Mac n cheese and cheeseburger sliders which were both good. For dinner my wife and I split the big filet which they split for us on two plates which was nice. Got the truffle butter on top and a side of creamed spinach and mushrooms. Shrooms were baby bells which were good but the spinach was cold and just decent. My father in law said that the lamb chops were the best he ever had.

I am obsessed with oysters and I would never leave an oyster unless it tasted really gross. They were so shelly I was worried I would get sick from eating so many little prices of shell! The oysters were so disappointing. It's weird bc they took so long to bring them out. They must have had no one in the kitchen with shucking experience. They reminded me of that one time I tried to shuck my own oysters: awful. My caesar salad was depressing: lettuce was brown and you could tell it was definitely not freshly cut. Dressing was not a catastrophe. Maybe even good. I just can't remember anything but those horrible oysters. The worst oysters I've ever had, hands down.  Our server was snobby at first and then creepily nice...  The best part was the bread and olive tapenade that they bring to the table. However, this is not a good enough reason to go back.

The wine list is extensive and as affordable or expensive as your pocketbook allows you to go. I love lobster bisque and while I've had better, it was very good here. The rib-eye steak and prime rib my boyfriend and I ordered were both delicious and perfectly cooked, and I would definitely recommend the creamed spinach side dish and the peach cobbler. The atmosphere was very classic and lovely, exactly what I wanted for a Christmas Eve date. But some things were just not up to my expectations for a fine dining establishment. The menu was cluttered and used very tiny print so as to force everything onto a single legal-sized page. There were also not nearly as many options for steak as I expected from the name of the place. Finally the service was down-right 'meh,' for this style of restaurant. The server was not welcoming or warm, it seemed like he just wanted to get his job done. It took forever for our starting drinks to arrive and the server looked absolutely baffled by the fact I wanted my wine to arrive with my meal instead of immediately. And then it was a good five minutes after our food arrived before my wine got there! We asked a lot of questions(there wasn't room on the busy menu to describe many of the dishes), and our server answered them briefly with little detail and offered few, if any, recommendations. He was also very slow about refilling our waters and removing empty glasses and dishes from the table. Finally, my boyfriend ordered a coffee to wait while I had dessert because he isn't into sweets, and it also didn't arrive until I was almost finished with the cobbler. I only go to fine dining restaurants like this for special occasions, and I expect the service to be as wonderful as the meal itself so that the whole experience makes the occasion even more special.

I had Ahi Tuna Sashimi for appetizer which was surprisingly generously portioned.  I was expecting the typical fancy restaurant thing where you get 3 tiny pieces on a tiny plate, but this was large.  It also came with this scrunched up, salted kale - which I had never had before but it tasted amazing like a mix between salted seaweed and popcorn.  And I had some bites of boyfriendts lobster bisque.  Ahhhh, so good. Then, the most amazing part of the mealS  Pork chop with blackberry sauce!!!  This dish was HEAVEN.  Just each part was really outstanding - the tender juicy meat, the succulent but not-too-sweet blackberry sauce, portion size, temperature, etc.  Amazing.  And it came with a generous helping of garlic mashed potatoes.  I couldntt finish it all and had an amazing breakfast the next morning as well. The dining experience here was pretty perfect - great food, friendly service, real classy ambiance and the food came out quickly.  The bathroom was a little bizarre and through this little maze in some back area of the restaurant.  But that is a minor complaint.  And walking here from our hotel was perfect for Valentines Day because Michigan Avenue still had Christmas lights up and it was a very romantic feel.  Definitely recommend this restaurant for a special occasion!",0.999,0.654,0.31,0.036,0.5855555555555555

Entrees were scallops - nicely cooked but possibly too salty - and tuna tartare with avocado, mango and various sauces and aiolis, which was fairly tasty but smelled very strongly of fish, which in my experience is often a hint that the fish isn't fresh. The steaks themselves were very nice, slightly undercooked from what was ordered, but then served with lots of garnish that might've been better left off. The mushroom side came in some kind of tangy/acrid sauce which was simply awful. I explained to a disappointed-looking server that it ""wasn't to my taste"", but had my partner taste it and she also looked like she wanted to spit it out, so wasn't just me.

My advice? Stay in the bar area. For it was fun, lively, had a great bartender and was seemingly a place I would want to hang out.  Unfortunately, we had a reservation in the restaurant area and once seated, I realized the error of my ways (should have gone back to the bar!).  The room we were seated in was blah. No windows, typical steak house decor and a bit of a tired feeling. Kind of like being in a banquet room at a hotel. Certainly not the lively bar area from which we had just come with it's windows facing the street and warm ambiance.  On this night- there were more staff than customers so you would have thought service should have been at an all time high. Eh . . .not so much.  Our server came over to tell us the specials of the day and then left to get our drinks. I'm not really sure where he went to get those drinks but they took forever to come up.  We decided to do a little splitting- one of us was going to have the Prix Fixe menu for $49.50 which included a starter, a main course and a dessert, while I was going to go the a la carte route and split the main course with my friend.  Up first- squash soup for my friend and a mozzarella tomato salad for me. Good, but the soup tasted a bit like pumpkin pie.  My salad was quite tasty, though.  For our entree- we split the Chilean Sea Bass which was quite good- perfectly done and with the side of mac and cheese that we ordered was more than enough food for the two of us.  Service was spotty. Our server was missing in action most of the time so we had to keep flagging down the bus staff to help us out (they were terrific!, BTW!) And just where was he getting those drinks at? I felt like I needed to order another one the second he placed a drink on the table as the lag time to the bar and back was so great!  The whole experience left me a little cold. Dinner for two even after splitting an entree came to $140 including drinks which just felt like alot of money given the experience that we had had.

We tried going to a French bistro for a spur of a romantic moment but the French apparently can't pick up their phone. Then I remembered the Grill on the Alley. My mom raved about their brunch when she stayed at the Weston Hotel (The Grill is their on-site restaurant). I've had their salad for lunch years prior and remember it being expensive but good. This time we made a reservation to do a full course dinner. The atmosphere is of a timeless sports bar/club. It doesn't scream romantic but the lighting, the quietness (not many people were dining in the part we were in) and the attentiveness of the waiter made our night.  The server was a professional, a professional waiter, how all waiters should be. He knew exactly what to say, do, didn't hover, didn't make me feel bad that I didn't order dessert.  We started with Tuna tartar and continued on with mixed green salad and tomatoes with mozzarella drizzled in Balsamic reduction, the Filet Mignon, and Grilled Sea Bass (Seafood special of the day). The tuna tartar: artistic perfection of three layers of avocado, mango and fresh tuna. The chips that came with the appetizer had the perfect amount of crunch that fared well with the softness of the avocado, mango and the tuna.  The salads were excellent. The balsamic reduction was sweet and was an amazing combination to the tenderest mozzarella I've bit into. The waiter asked if I wanted my steak medium or medium rare. This is how I know he knows what he is doing. Steaks should only be enjoyed medium or medium rare. Since you should just go to the butcher and skip the restaurant if you want to eat rare, and anything cooked beyond medium is basically horse meat. I've never had a horse, but I heard their meat is tough.  The filet mignon melted in my mouth. So juicy and tender. The Sea Bass was so juicy and flaked off with a hint of a touch. No need for lemon since the fish was fresh and almost creamy in the mouth. The sides, I had the mushroom and he had the grilled veggies, were cooked to perfection. The mushroom wasn't soggy but juicy and the grilled veggies were had the smokiness that paired well with its own juices and  balsalmic dressing.  ***In the summer months, the Grill has outdoor seating that makes a great people watching spot.

Even better story now - there is a wide variety of art, everything from gorgeous figure drawings, cute children's work, and a wide variety of varying degrees of talent. All beautifully framed.  This is one of four ""Grills"", and the most successful one - 'cos they serve breakfast! They are actually not affiliated with the Westin, but have sort of a symbiotic relationship, obviously.

Even though we had just eaten dinner, we were still hungry.  So we nibbled on some prime rib quesadillas.  Those seriously hit the spot!  The guacamole on the side a great addition.  It was the perfect dish to share. The place was pretty empty on a recent weeknight.  Mostly just a sprinkling of tourists and business travelers.  Oh and a dude trying to pick up a girl.  Poor thing!    I think I was most impressed with the service.  Our server was excellent--attentive, but did not hover.   And when we accidentally knocked a fork off of our high top (we're a rowdy duo), another employee came over to, not only retrieve said piece of silverware, but also promptly replaced it.  All within literally 4 seconds.    I'd say The Grill is a good option for Michigan Ave dining.  Not my favorite, but with a large menu and top notch drinks, everyone is bound to find something to suit their fancy.",0.9594,0.816,0.139,0.045,0.694025974025974

2007-08-17,4.0,"I've had a relationship with this bar forever...And please note I am reviewing the BAR only and not the restaurant. Many moons ago--before Michigan Ave. morphed into the Midwest's Rodeo Drive--the bar portion of the Westin Hotel actually stretched onto the street. There was a jukebox and a pool table and the place could probably accomodate 200 people comfortably. The Westin people then sold part of the property to accomodate shops and the restaurant/bar became The Chelsea. I was in grad school then and knew someone who bartended there and we hung out there all the time. We'd play pool and drink $4.50 Miller Lites (in 1998 they were $4.50-yo!) and people-watch. During this stage of the bar I enjoyed many celebrity sitings: Slash from GnR, James Carville and Mary Matlin, Barry Bonds...Also: lots of scary rich older married dudes bought me drinks. Which was cool then because I was very poor. (well, still am, but also desperate back then.) Around 1999 it became The Grill on the Alley. I moved away though it wasn't until 2004 that I started frequenting the spot again.  The food is pretty good. Last night I enjoyed appetizer scallops ($13) that came in a yummy orange sauce and enabled me to hold my two whisky drinks. I've also had most of the salads ($11-15), but never any of the steaks. They have a hummus trio plate that is also quite good. No nuts though, which was a staple in the old days... The bar, though still sizable, is usually packed these days and that annoys me.
