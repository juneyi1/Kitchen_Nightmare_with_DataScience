I previously lived in the area for two years and never came across the restaurant until the event. I wish I'd  The staff were so attentive and helpful from the moment we walked into the doors. They put us at a table near the front so we can be easily visible for the people that we were slanted to meet. Our waiter was full of great suggestions for which dishes or adult beverages that we should order. Our waiter recommended the mango margarita and it seriously changed my life! It was so delicious. It's seriously the first mango margarita that ever tasted like a mango, it tasted like they took a fresh mango and blended it instead of using some type of pre-made mango mix. I would come back just for the mango margarita.  The food was equally delicious. I ordered the burrito and it was just as delicious as the mango margarita. The waiter gave us a complimentary dessert which was awesome.  I highly recommend visiting El Nuevo Mexicano because I didn't have expectations and they blew me out of the water.",0.9919,0.788,0.198,0.015,0.6319298245614035

The small bar seats about six and was tended by the terrific bartender Jayson. He explained the different margaritas, offered tastes before pouring, took your food order and all the while kept the conversation interesting.

2017-06-27,4.0,After reading great Yelp reviews my friend and I ventured to El Nuevo Mexicano late on a Sunday. It wasn't overly busy but there was a weird vibe as several employees walked past us and finally we were seated after looking confused by the host stand...but onto all the good stuff. The atmosphere and decor is kinda upscale Mexican restaurant IMO. I sat down and opened the menu and quickly realized I wouldn't be eating a $10 dinner. So I scoured the menu for something cheaper and filling since I was starving. I settled on the 3 asada tacos for $16. I am used to 3 asada tacos for $6 - super authentic and delicious....and I can say for $4/taco for the best asada tacos of my life was worth it. Whatever they marinade the meat in was absolutely delicious. I was blown away!! My friends tostadas were delicious as well! The chips and salsa were excellent. Very spicy - just how I like it! Service was ehhh. But I never expect over the top at Mexican places. Definitely give this place a shot - if you feel like paying $20+ a person for Mexican cuisine.,0.9944,0.705,0.256,0.039,0.5043981481481482

I ordered the Vegan Chiles Rellenos and they were really good! They were filled with veggies and different nuts and seeds inside. They were surprisingly spicy. The dish comes with a tiny salad of mango and jicama which helped with the spiciness. I ordered mine with some Quinoa. It was all quite filling! The waiter was very kind and attentive. The servers were also very attentive and were quick to remove anything we no longer needed. Keep in mind the place is very tiny and there is little room to squeeze by to get from one place to another if that is something of importance to you. I was disappointed that they did not offer Horchata as that is a traditional Mexican drink. I ordered the pineapple drink which was warm, but they did bring out ice for us to put into our drink.The place does get loud and lively. The only reason I took off one star was because of the drink issue and the fact that they never brought the bill to our table at the end so we had to hunt them down.

She seemed to enjoy her food, but my burritos were average at best; a similar quality to that you'd find from a taco truck for 5 dollars...fairly poor quality steak and the burritos had no filling other than just meat, so were fairly bland. The shock came when we got our bill. Since my wife is pregnant, she got a virgin Mojito which they charged full price ($12.50) for. Their menu online states that steak burritos are $15 (which quite frankly is a stretch given the quality). When we got our bill, we were charged $17...I asked about the discrepancy and they showed me a menu in store that listed the price as $16...Where did the extra dollar come from? In the end, they quickly corrected the bill and took a few dollars off the virgin drink price, but it is completely disingenuous and unacceptable to charge prices other than advertised.  The service we received was very good, but given the blatant price gouging and mediocre food, we will certainly not be coming back.",0.6362,0.824,0.093,0.083,0.45151138716356104

Tried the chicken enchiladas with ranchero sauce, which came with a side of rice, beans, and veggies(lettuce, tomato, etc.). This dish was great, and if all their entrees are similar, it would be reliably be one of my go tos for tex-mex. The other dish, was I was arguable more excited for, were the nachos, which were loaded with cheese, beans, guacamole, salsa, and sour cream. All the ingredients were great, particularly the fresh guacamole and the perfectly melted, gooey cheese, which formed perfect melty strings upon separation. The issue was the portion size, it seemed like there were only 10-12 chips in the entire $9 portion of nachos, which is criminally small. I'd like to give them the benefit of the doubt in assuming they just whiffed this single order, as given the amount of other ingredients provided in the nachos, along with the size of their entrees, it doesn't seem to add up.

I'm not totally devastated but at the very least disappointed in the lack of flavor and authenticity in their food. I can absolutely appreciate that their demographic might be true to the area and thus lacking that true Mexican feeling and taste that the food would otherwise deliver. I will rate all items consumed in order of appearance: 1.- Chips and salsa were typical and meh at best. The chips seemed as if they were bagged and not fresh. The salsa was bland and not SALTED at all.  2.- The ""Queso Fundido"" was probably the best of all dishes. The chorizo was tasty and this made it all together a nice appetizing dish. Hard to get wrong but I will give a star for this. 3.- The ""Chimichangas al Pastor"" were absolutely nothing to remember, this was a let down because they looked delicious in the pics. Lacking flavor and SALT in every way possible. Typical Spanish rice and probably canned re-fried beans that are served almost anywhere you go.  4.- The ""Carnitas Chipotle"" were indeed the worst part of this experience. There was really no bond between the two main ingredients (chipotle & carnitas). Sort of thrown together on a plate. Spicy but no unique flavor and entirely overpowered by the sauce. We should've known better.  5.- The ""Michelada"" was also a disappointment since I'm used to the authentic and spicy kind and finally the sangria was OK. Nothing more. The staff was polite and attentive so they get an extra star for that. I don't like that I had to write this but I feel compelled given our experience, just wanted to share with others.

Thanks to you, my fellow Yelpers, who helped me rediscover an old gem. There are several vegan options here, and, of course, the standard Mexican type menu for all the carnivores and even vegetarians (cheese and beans!) out there. I had the flautas and my friend Jean had the fajitas. We each got a small hot quinoa salad, which was good. Jean loved her fajitas, and let me have a sample, which I enjoyed, too. We were trying to figure out what kind of vegan chicken was used, but we didn't ask. The one thing that was a little odd was the tortillas that came with the fajitas. They were really small, smaller than the smallest size you buy in groceries. I guess it's nice that you can't stuff your piehole as quickly, and you get more time to digest, but she had to ask for more. I don't know what that's about. The flautas were delicious, and the entrée filled me comfortably. I was very happy with my choice. We each ordered a margarita. Jean had the house margarita, and I had the next level up. Mine tasted good, but there didn't seem to be much alcohol in it. I have a low tolerance for alcohol; a little goes a long way with me. Jean was driving, so I thought, I'll pay a little more and enjoy a buzz. I didn't get any sort of buzz. That was a small disappointment. I look forward to visiting El Nuevo Mexicano again and working my way through the vegan menu. I'm very grateful that the ownership decided to serve the vegan market, and I would encourage other restaurants to consider doing the same.",0.9911,0.818,0.147,0.036,0.47390670553935854

My companion had the Carne Asada dinner. My meal was really good-especially loved the Upton's Chorizo and potatoes mix stuffed in the Burrito and a really lovely side salad with fresh mango.  Interestingly enough, the standout for me was the Mexican seasoned quinoa. So flavorful. I was sad at first because I love rice (it's not vegan there), but I could have eaten a bowl full of that replacement quinoa alone...

I'll write a more thorough review once I've tried more of their dishes. For now, I can tell you that their steak tacos on soft corn tortillas are perfection. Also, the rice and beans on the side are delicious, unlike the bland filler food I'm used to getting with such dishes. If you don't mind splurging a little bit, you won't be disappointed.

2015-12-27,4.0,"You'd think with all the Mexican places in this town, choosing one would be easy.  But every time we think we want Mexican food, we go through a litany of choices discarding one after another for this reason or that. But that may have all changed the other night with our recent visit to El Nuevo Mexicano. My friends took us, the uninitiated, to El Nuevo for dinner the other night.  And after a small glitch with our reservation (what happened to that darn thing anyway?) we were quickly seated. free chips and delicious homemade salsa were delivered to our table, and our friendly server was explaining the menu and making recommendations.  The space is nice, cozy but not crowded with a great table in the window, and plenty of tables that can be put together for any sized group.  I also hear there is a patio out back that will be calling to me during the warmer months. Pitchers of margaritas are loaded with flavor (and alcohol) and they have a large menu of them from simple to flavored, frozen or on the rocks.  With premium tequila they will run you about $37 a pitcher but worth every penny! The food was delicious!  We started with two quesa fundidos (did I say my friends love cheese?) one with peppers which was even better than the chorizo version!  And they came with plenty of warm, flour tortillas to wrap around all the cheesy goodness! The menu has some typical Tex Mex offerings but what interested me were the more authentic dishes and specials.  They even have vegan offerings which my vegan friends say are some of the best offerings in the city! I wanted to try a little of this and that so I got the combination plate with a taco, enchilada with mole sauce and a beef tostada.  A very large portion and excellent!  My friends had an array of other offerings like the coconut shrimp, the carne asada and the grilled chicken.  Each were delicious! Hard to believe that with all that food we had room for dessert, but if you check in with your Yelp app, you get a free flan which started us off and then those with a sweet tooth in our group went for the tres leeches cake and the plantanos fritos (fried plantains) which was served with some coconut milk ice cream.  Hard to believe we could even get up from our seats at this point!

Good sized dish that came with rice and beans. Several people at the table ordered fajitas which looked quite good too.  Service was very friendly all night but a tad on the slow side.

The speakers were right by our table so it was extremely loud and hard to talk. Our servers took forever to take our order, bring our food, and then our check, and our waters were rarely refilled. Everyone was very polite, but I expect a basic level of attentiveness at a restaurant that wasn't met.  Overall, I don't know if I'd come back.

2015-07-16,2.0,Come on Yelpers. I put a lot of faith in you and got totally led astray with this recommendation.  Such a letdown.  * Pitchers of margaritas were $4 off however they were awful. Extremely sweet; no tequila taste. Took two sips and sent the entire pitcher back and got Tecate.  * Guacamole was beyond under seasoned. Nice avocado flavor but seriously lacked salt * Tacos were average at best. Greasy steak and dry chicken.  Left feeling very underwhelmed. Does Chicago not do Mexican well? Are you only good at pizza and hotdogs??,0.8974,0.746,0.176,0.079,0.5328703703703703

They finished off their frozen strawberry margaritas and remained vertical without difficulty.  The ambience is very casual with traditional decor you find in Mexican restaurants.

Whatever again, we all got individual glasses. This is where things get weird. All 5 margaritas come and they are all different colors and shades of greenish yellow.

2015-02-25,4.0,"i had heard Chicago had good Mexican food of all things (which was surprising considering this is the midwest!), and oh my gosh, they were not kidding.  This restaurant is spectacular.  Service is arguably some of the best service I've ever had, with waiters constantly smiling, checking in, refilling your glasses, and taking care of you in the most cordial and kind way possible.  When you step in to the restaurant, it's like a gentle host is welcoming you into their house.  The ambiance is simply wonderful.   It definitely comes off as a little bit fancier and intimate than your standard Mexican establishment, but by no means do the prices mimic that.  They're exactly what you'd expect in the $10 - $20 range, and the food quality is extremely high to boot.   Specifically, I just want to call out the chips and salsa that are prepared for every table.  Man, those chips.  They. are. good.  They're extremely crispy, homemade, and fried to perfection.  The wonderful crunch from biting into one is unlike biting into any sort of store-bought tortilla chip and paired with the sour-spicy tomato salsa on the table makes them just heavenly.  These are my kind of flavors.  The corn comes through, the acid is bright, and the chile-d tomatoes are the perfect backdrop for each and every bite. The entrees themselves were really great too.  I went for the salmon in a salsa verde/green mole-like sauce, and although my salmon was unevenly cooked (perfect in the center, overcooked and chewy on the perimeter), the sauce was to die for.  By the end of the night I actually started dipping the table chips in it to get every last drop of the sauce into my belly.  Scrumptious!

I had been watching these tables and observed that 2 had just ordered desert and the third was working on a carafe of margarita. We were finally seated 90+ minutes into our stay after several 2-tops, which could have been combined into a 4, had been seated. For our wait we got a dismissive apology and no recompense. The bar tender at least got us some chips and salsa during the interminable wait. After we asked of course. No manager bothered to apologize and the host, well words fail me. You don't tell a diner the wait is 20 minutes then seat them 90+ minutes later. While telling them that 20 was just the average. Incredibly unprofessional.

El Nuevo is not your run-of-the-mill taco and beans joint.   You figure that out as soon as you walk in.   It's nicely appointed and has a full bar on the left side.   One that you might actually want to sit at and have a cocktail. The salsa is homemade and has a little kick of spice that is quite welcome.   My enchiladas al pastor were excellent as well.   The pork was very tender and moist (which can be a problem with al pastor). Service was spot on.   Very fast and friendly.   Provided excellent recommendations. I will definitely seek out El Nuevo when I'm in a mood for some better Mexican food.",0.9765,0.805,0.178,0.016,0.5491975308641975
2014-04-20,4.0,"El Nuevo Mexicano is a sit down Mexican restaurant.  This is more than a taqueria with an extensive menu that should be able to satisfy everyone's tastes.  The restaurant is rather small so reservations are recommended.  If you aren't looking for it, you could also walk by it because the front is unassuming.  The guacamole was delicious.  You could tell it was made to order and it was fresh.  They made it with the right amount of spice for us.  I also really liked the salsa that came with the chips -  a nice zing without too much.  I managed to get two different entrees the two different times I have been in for dinner. I had the shrimp with garlic and mango and then the fish tacos.  Both were very good.  The preparation is simple but executed well.  I liked both dishes and found that the fish tacos were more filling.  I also really liked the side salad that came with the fish tacos with the jicama.   I also was surprised at how much I liked the chipotle mashed potatoes -I couldn't stop eating them!   My dining companions seemed to like their dishes as well - from the beef burrito to the steak tacos to the amish chicken, everyone was pleased.  As soon as the food came, it was quiet which is always a good sign.  The drinks are good, but as most places, this is where things can get expensive.  Yet, our waiter was very helpful in getting everyone something that they liked.  Service was friendly and quick.  I was surprised at how quickly our dinner came out of the kitchen.  Overall, this is a good place for a sit down Mexican that is delicious, authentic and still reasonably priced.

I was really surprised.  The mole was only okay, I've had far better. The salsa and chips were pretty good, a nice bite but not overwhelmingly hot.  The company was fantastic.. we do love our friends.  Our friends all enjoyed their meals so I was going to give El Nuevo 4 stars taking one away only for my dry flavorless Amish (the Amish would be so embarrassed) chicken. But then, I had to take another star away as they visually allow you to see they have wifi... but their customers can't use it.  For goodness sake, they could name the wifi something that doesn't point out it's theirs.. or make it invisible.. but to flaunt it while saying we can't use it.. que los de una estrella de mi amigo.    For all who reply 'you didn't go there to be online'... conversations often beg for a bit of factual verification.  I don't text, I don't email, but when our conversation needs more information.. to further the conversation... wifi.",0.9937,0.77,0.216,0.014,0.72

Not only did they delver on it, it was perfect. Everything else on the plate was perfect too.  El Nuevo concentrates on quality, if you're out looking for quantity, you'll be disappointed, portion sizes were ample without going over board. I did eat most all of my meal, and had a little room left over for a second margarita.  The place has a contemporary atmosphere, the tables are a little close, so if you're planning on having a private conversation I recommended dining off hours, we had a early dinner and by the time we were leaving the place was on it's way to filling up.

2014-02-13,5.0,Truly well worth the  mile walk in the bitter cold and my nearly frostbitten fingers. First order of business when I sat down was to order a pitcher of margarita. A little sweet for my taste BUT it's because I don't gravitate towards sweet drinks. It redeemed itself though once the world became warm and fuzzy again.  I love their extensive vegetarian options that went beyond the usual cheese enchiladas and refried bean burrito that one often sees at Mexican restaurants.  I shared the chimichanga and salmon tacos. They were so tasty. The chimichanga was sweeter than I would liked but that also only occurrred to me once I had no more room to stuff myself so not a particularly reliable memory.  I loved the salad that accompanied the dishes.

2014-02-04,4.0,"We visited El Nuevo with friends who live in the Lakeview area recently. They had raved about it being the ""best Mexican in the area"" so my expectations were set fairly high. The management and staff accommodated our large group very well- I felt that the service was exceptionally good. Orders were taken and filled quickly as well as accurately. Meals were prepared and served quickly especially considering that we visited in prime time on a Saturday night. It was nice that the menu has clear descriptions of each dish for those who may be unfamiliar with Mexican cuisine. The complete descriptions encouraged some members of our party to try something new rather than their old standbys. There are a couple of interesting sounding vegetarian/vegan choices on the menu that I nearly ordered. There is also an option for gluten free quinoa instead of rice for those who prefer it. I felt most of what we were served to be average/typical at best; having said that, the chile ancho sauce that my shrimp was served in tasted spectacular and I felt was a major cut above on the flavor scale. This sauce had the perfect balance of heat and sweet for my taste buds. I only wish I had ordered extra rice to be able to soak it all up. So, although El Nuevo may indeed be the best Mexican in Chicago's Lakeview- I feel that it is hardly the ""Best Mexican"" in N. Illinois and S. Wisconsin. For most people it will be a fine if somewhat spendy choice. Side observation- obviously not the management's responsibility, but during our meal, several couples came in, studied the menu for 10 or more minutes and left without being seated. I found this to be curious behavior to say the least. My rating: Service 4 stars, selection 3 stars, presentation 3 stars, food quality 3.5 stars, prices 2 stars.

I went tonight for a friends birthday, we had a party of 8 people and a few were late. The staff was nice and did not rush us on ordering, just kept refilling our drinks and our chips and salsa, which were amazing! Margaritas were so so.  Finally we ordered and of course I changed my order at the last minute to chicken tacos on corn tortillas. Pretty plain but I'm not too adventurous with Mexican food. That is my only upset, that the menu is not laid out for easy reading and browsing. It is all in Spanish and not very organized so I did not see everything thus changing my order at the last minute to the same as what my friend got.  The food did not take very long and came out looking beautiful! Besides the presentation it as delicious! Double layered tortillas and fresh chicken breast that was so tender it was starting to shred itself, not that cubed stuff you often get. Big pieces of lettuce and red cabbage, my favorite! Also came with a small side of rice and refried beans! The perfect portions of everything!

2014-01-04,3.0,"On a cold, snowy Monday night, not wanting to walk far, my friend and I fell right into this place.  It looked cozy and welcoming inside, and it was!  The place is very small, only seating around 50 people max, but normal per Chicago standards.  We did not have reservations, so we happily waited at the bar, and had a great view of the kitchen! The bartender was enjoyable and easy going, so were the servers. The bartender offered margaritas or mojitos as his recommendations and we both went with the Monday night special $5 mojitos!   I really enjoyed the mojito, and we were seated shortly after.         I guess I didn't really think about the name of this place while ordering. ""El Nuevo Mexicano""=""New Mexican"". I would've understood that more while looking over the menu, but I didn't, And I can easily blame it on wanting to chat more with the company I had :)....  Both of us were wanting to eat light, and after noticing the size of others plates around us we decided on a light appetizer and one entree to split.    The ceviche salad had great flavor, slightly sweet from some source of fruit, but not overly sweet.  The seafood wasn't in the  typical critic acid bath and diced with cucumbers and tomatoes.  It was Nuevo style! A thicker tomato juice, larger sized scallops and shrimp that seemed to be cooked from water not critus, all placed on a bed of masculine greens and large segments of tomato not the side. El Nuevo style seems like tex-mex done right!  Here's where I wish I would've reordered after catching on.  We decided to split the entree, a plate that consisted of very traditional items, a taco, enchilada and a tostada. I can't say that it was bad, it's just not what they want to be serving, but props to them for even having it on the menu for the more wary customers not wanting to go outside of their Togo box :)  I did really enjoy the chipotle red enchilada sauce. It was light and not overdone, just a good simple sauce I could see myself using on eggs.  The ground beef taco was jazzed up a bit with potatoes and green bell peppers, nothing outstanding, but once again, to traditional for this restaurant.. I have nothing nice to say about the chicken tostada only because chicken is fairly easy to achieve a nice flavor with but it was forgotten about.  This item also seemed to be the one they would've done the most with in terms of adding ""Nuevo"" elements to. Unfortunately, it was just beans and chicken and utterly boring.   The items every Mexican restaurant has to do right, even from a dive place to upscale is the salsa, rice and beans.  The table salsa was very tomatoey and kinda sorta boring but sometimes I prefer it this way, and this was a sometime.  The rice and beans were technically done right and also tasted great, I just wish they would've  left out the peas in the rice, nothing is worse to see then a shriveled up, hardened over pea that is also pointless by adding no flavor, and just messing with the look of the rice.  Both of us agreed the beans were tasty, even though I felt they were a little thick, I do appreciate the lack of lard.

The way they present the dishes is always fantastic and creative. I also like having the option of quinoa instead of rice with the entrees. Their drinks are always strong and super tasty.  Furthermore, the service is top-notch. The servers will come to the table and stir your pitcher of frozen margaritas throughout the meal, so that the ice doesn't settle to the top.... very nice. The other night when I was there, I don't recall pouring a single drink of my own. As soon as my glass was near empty, the server was there to refill it for me from the pitcher at the table. I have no problem pouring my own drink, but Jesus, it really shows their commitment to great customer service.  I'd go here everyday if I could!",0.9665,0.817,0.156,0.028,0.6056802721088435

2013-08-20,2.0,"Celebrated my birthday here this past weekend and left feeling not so impressed. We had a reservation for 12 people and had requested being seated on the patio each time we called (called to originally schedule the reservation, update the number and confirm). Our reservation was at 7:30 and all 12 of us were there on time. Obviously this being a smaller restaurant, with almost no where to stand by the bar, we were hoping to be seated right away. I asked how long our wait would be for the patio and was told 20 minutes. Fine, no big deal.  At 8:05 I went back to the hostess and asked again how much longer. He said he could seat us inside with two round tables pushed together in the corner. I told him we did not want to do that and had requested and been confirmed patio seating. He looked on his ipad and said there were no notes about the patio request in the reservation... interesting because it was specifically mentioned and confirmed on all calls.  Finally at 8:25 (55 minutes after our reservation) we were seated. Our server was great, food all came correct and he was very attentive. From what I gathered everyone seemed to like their food and had positive remarks about it. I tried a few different margaritas and the sangria and while it was all good, it didn't seem very strong. The general consensus after leaving was for the amount we drank we should have had at least a little buzz going!  The final kicker of the whole evening was after clearly being upset about having to wait for such a long time with a large group, and not having any comments about the patio for our reservation, I would have thought we would be offered SOME sort of a discount. I would have been happy with a free pitcher or two, a 10% discount.... ANYTHING. At the very least an apology?? We received nothing.

2013-05-01,4.0,"Me: I have a taste for Mexican POE*: Me too, are there any good Mexican places by you? Me: Not really POE: Bummer Both being fans of Mexican food, this is a frequent exchange usually ending in us hopping in the car or on public transit in search of some tasty Mexican eats. I'm not opposed to venturing out of my neighborhood for good food (I do it quite often), but sometimes you just want to pop around the corner for a bite. That changed with one episode of Check Please, where I saw El Nuevo Mexicano featured. I'd walked by it a million times only vaguely noticing it - boy was I missing out. We popped in Sunday for a late lunch. The place was pretty empty when we arrived, so we had a chance to take in the decor; colorful paintings and other items adorn the exposed brick walls. The decor is tasteful and as POE noted almost like a little Spanish lesson since the paintings are of objects with their Spanish names scripted below. Service was friendly and attentive. It took us a while to go through the menu because many things looked good. For those who need it, they have vegetarian and vegan options. We noshed on chips and salsa while we perused; the panelists on Check Please found flaw with the chips, but I enjoyed them - a bit thinner than most you find, but crisp and fresh. The salsa had a reasonable amount of kick; I don't think most would find it too hot. I hate when it's so mild that I feel like I'm eating dressed up ketchup, although that never stops me from eating it. We both ordered out of character and got enchiladas. He was set on mole one while I struggled between chipotle or tomatillo sauce for my cheese and onion enchiladas. Our server offered a brilliant suggestion, half and half. We both devoured our food, extremely happy with our choices. Both sauces on my enchiladas were delicious, I can't decide which I liked more. Maybe I'll have to stick with half and half. El Nuevo Mexicano is a sit down place, so don't walk in expecting taqueria prices, but don't let that deter you from dining. Next time I plan on enjoying a margarita or three with my tasty meal, probably on a Tuesday when they're on special.  *Partner in overeating.",0.9939,0.8,0.155,0.045,0.45394292468760566

2013-02-12,4.0,"With a rare Tuesday off from work I decided to venture out for lunch. I had seen El Nuevo recently appear on Check Please and the venue looked appealing. I had not really encountered a Mexican restaurant within short walking distance of my condo that I had hitherto found more than fair to middling, so was happy when I saw at the end of the segment how close El Nuevo was to where I reside. I felt like today would be the perfect opportunity as I am sure they have been packing it in of late during dinner service with the buzz generated from Check Please. The dining room was not full at all for our weekday lunch. A pet peeve of mine is when ethnic restaurants overdo the decor and end up with a tacky ambiance, but El Nuevo did a nice job creating an authentic Mexican vibe without going overboard. I enjoyed the tin ceiling and the large antique lantern hanging over an adjacent table; the space seemed nice and cozy.  El Nuevo has a fairly vast menu and a full bar specializing in margaritas. Online they had a lunch menu, but we were delivered the regular menu; not sure if they have done away with the lunch menu but as there was a particular dish on the regular menu I wanted to try I did not inquire about this. Pricing is moderate with the average entree running about $14. I ordered a pork dish that was sitting in a spicy chipotle sauce with rice, cilantro, fried plantains and mango and served with your choice of corn or flour tortillas ($16) and my wife ordered the trio of mini burritos served with a salad ($12) with a side of sour cream ($1 surcharge). While a tad pricier than other nearby Mexican restaurants we have frequented, we both were agreed this was a step up in quality and well worth a small additional charge. I loved the chipotle sauce; lots of heat but cut nicely by the sweet mango and plantains. The portions were rather generous especially after we had been nibbling on the complimentary chips accompanied by a mild salsa; I was not even quite able to finish my plate. My only complaints would be that the pork was a tad dry (though there was enough sauce to remedy this), there was only a minuscule quantity of plantains (one of my favorite foods) and at this price point I found it a bit unnecessary to tack on a $1 surcharge for sour cream to be served with burritos.  No complaints about service; while not overly personable our server was competent, sufficiently attentive and knowledgeable about the menu when I had a question. Our food was delivered surprisingly quick, though I imagine it would be a different story during dinner service when the restaurant is packed. While El Nuevo Mexicano is not quite up there with my favorite Mexican restaurants in the city, it is the best within a ten minute walk of my condo so I likely will be back to sample more of what they have to offer before too long.",0.9954,0.83,0.14,0.03,0.563732124749074

Queso Fundido- Cheesy, heavenly goodness.  Combination Fajitas (to share):  Chicken and steak. Definitely enough for two. Very flavorful.   I went back there months later with a friend and we actually replicated the same meal.  They nailed it once again!  This Valentines Day weekend my boyfriend and I decided to dine there again.  Tradición! Si? Si.  Again, the wait staff was fantastic.  We were not crowded, as it was the Sunday before the holiday, although the restaurant was moderately full.  Margaritas were a must, but we changed up our order this time around.   We ordered:  Queso Fundido w/ Pablano Peppers and Chorizo-  Gluttony has never tasted so good.  Caper and Jalapeno Talapia w/ Veggies & Chipotle Mashed Potatoes-  Seriously wonderful.  It was also a recommendation by our waiter.  Smart man.  Pork Flautas-  Now, I think these are glorified Tequitos, but my boyfriend swears by them.  I had a bite of the pork and it was tender and flavorful.  He basically licked the plate clean.  (He ordered a small side of guacamole, which was pricey at $4, but very fresh!)  Go here.  Love the food.  Love the staff.  Love the tequila.  Love the charm. PS: I forgot to mention the pricing, frankly because they could charge me double for everything and I'd probably still scrounge up the money to go once a year.  Their prices are moderate to pricey.  Our total dinner Valentines Day circa 2012 was $64.00 not including tip.",0.997,0.813,0.179,0.008,0.5024436090225565

Insert El Nuveo. I'd hear from my hairdresser that El Nuveo was his go-to for amazing Mexican cuisine so, naturally I barely waited 24 hours before checking it out myself.

Skip it, the chips/salsa that come with the meal are so good, that your just as well without it. I ordered the quac once and while it was good, it was missing a little...je ne sais quoi?

The salmon was perfection and the sauce was so tasty...ugh my mouth is watering just thinking about it. ($14) o Fajjitas de Camaron - translation, shrimp fajitas seasoned with garlic, simmered onions, green and red peppers and tomatoes.  My go-to. I've ordered this 2 out of the 3 times I've been here. The shrimp is delicious and so fresh. And they don't skimp on fajita fixings either - sour cream, quac, pico de gallo, rice and beans. Do it. ($17 for shrimp or steak, less for chicken) Finally....my beau has gotten the following dish twice, he swears the pork is so tender that he dreams about it at least once a week.  o Carnitas Chipotle con Mango y Platano - translation, tender pork in a zesty chipotle sauce with mango and plantain bananas, pico de gallo, and Spanish rice. They serve this with tortillas as well (corn or flour). It has a good kick to it but you can get it toned down a notch. Savory pork + mango = WINNER.

I was completely disgusted with this place. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY, IT'S NOT WORTH A PENNY!! My experience: -My margarita: had several different shades of green. It did not taste fresh and didn't taste good either. Isn't a margarita suppose to be a bright green and just one color too?? -Chips and salsa: Chips tasted like a bad bag of chips from jewel, that I had to return. Salsa was WORST though because it was VERY WATERY and just had big chunks of tomatoes. It absolutely DID NOT TASTE LIKE SALSA. IT WAS JUST WATER WITH TOMATOES...VERY GROSS. -Entree:Chicken enchiladas- I was presented with probably two handfuls of cheese on the chicken enchiladas. I was shocked how bad my experience here was going. I removed the cheese and by the way, it was so easy to remove the cheese with my fork, because the cheese was stuck all together(disgusting.) Now, I know why they put so much cheese, probably to hide the fact that their food is not fresh.  Enchiladas had MANY UNEVEN spots of what it seemed and tasted like the salsa, I was served with the chips. The chicken tasted bland and was okay, but overall, my entree was NOTHING SPECIAL.  The rice was bland, beans...well tasted like beans.  This restaurant seems to serve: - PRE-WEEKLY MADE FOOD  -Mexican food??? They don't know how to make mexican food.  -They don't  care about freshness, and they probably don't throw away food that has been sitting and waiting to be microwaved for days at all, because they care more about making money.

2011-12-20,2.0,"Yet again I go into a pricey Mexican restaurant and run into disappointment.  My dining partner and I decided to go here after visiting the great zoo lights exhibit in Lincoln park. We got here around 8 pm and it was full but we only waited like five minutes or so to get a table. It was a Friday so it was not surprising they were at full capacity and it is a small place. We sat down and got an order of guac to star off which was to me pricey at eight dollars but it was really good and fresh and large though it needed salt. I went ahead and ordered the carnitas plate with tortillas, avocado slices, rice and beans.  Let me start off with the basics. The rice and beans were just plain bland no flavor what so ever. I mean this is basic Mexican how can you mess this up? The carintas were just OK and I could tell they were basically re-fried up in a pan. They were not totally dry but some bits were. I will agree that the portions they give you are big and my dinner mates dish was very large. For dessert we shared their Flan which was just OK nothing special about it other than it did have some yummy fruit sauce on the side.  The service was nice and they were very attentive despite how busy it was. Bottom line this place is over priced for the bland flood I experience and for not getting the basic fundamentals of Mexican food in my opinion.

2011-12-05,4.0,"Aaaaaay!  I was ecstatic when I learned that Mercy for Animals and El Nuevo Mexicano partnered up and created a vegan menu.  VEGAN MEXICAN FOOD!!!!  Crazy, I know! For appetizers I always get the Botana Combinada.  It comes with 2 flautas cut in half (4 in total) stuffed with Upton's chorizo, potatoes and carrots.  It also comes with guacamole (which needs a little lime to make it pop) and chipotle tomatillo salsa (delicious).  Except for the guacamole needing a little more seasoning, this appetizer is amazing. Since introducing the vegan menu, some of the entrees have changed and/or been eliminated.  They've also integrated the vegan menu with their regular menu.  I had the Enchiladas or Flautas (I can't remember exactly) in Salsa Bandera (salsa roja [red] and salsa verde [green] with Daiya cheeze in the middle...like the Mexican flag, which is no longer on the menu) and was extremely surprised that it was actually spicy.  It was quite good.  But, by far, my favorite dish is the Chimichangas. I've had their 2 vegan desserts, which I wasn't thrilled about.  They each lacked something.  The platanos maduros con nieve were too hard.  They needed to be a slightly more ripe.  However, the nieve and the sauce from the platanos were delicious.  The flautas de camote were okay, but I'm not biggest sweet potato fan.  The chipotle salsa that came with it truly gave it a kick and made me choke a few times (hate to admit it but it's true). Overall, good vegan food.  Plus some of the waiters and busboys are real cool to talk to.  Oh, another thing, they sell XX.  Double yum!",0.9515,0.826,0.12,0.054,0.5175080128205128

2011-04-30,3.0,"No matter how off any particular Yelp reviews might be, Yelpers tend to get the aggregate star rating right.  I do think, in the case of El Nuevo Mexicano, that Yelpers have gotten it a bit wrong, possibly because Yelp is heavily Lakeview-centric and holds a bias for the local boy who's apparently been around for some time.  I suppose if El Nuevo were my local Mexican joint, I might feel that it's four or five stars as well.  I only found it to be okay. All we ever seem to eat is tacos, burgers, pasta or pizza.  Opposites and simple palates attract.  So I furiously searched The Yelp for an establishment specializing in either sushi or one of these areas.  The three options I came up with on this date were two joints over on Sedgewick and El Nuevo.  El Nuevo ultimately won.  Tacos.  Again.  Mang.  Duh.   El Nuevo is a rather cozy joint.  It's small, and the tables are rather close.  They're Hashbrowns close.  We were lucky enough to score the centerpiece table up front on stage under the spotlight with relative privacy - the booth.   Free chips and salsa?  Yes, please.   Three-taco dinner?  Sure.  Is it worth $12?  I'm not sure about that one.  I can get tacos for $3 at Taco Joint or for a buck and change at Traspasada.   Margarita?  No.  Nine bucks for a margarita at a hole-in-the-wall taco joint is overpriced in my book.  This isn't River North, and I'm not a tourist. Five dollar Victoria?  I signed up. Service?  Very good, if that particular thing matters to you. I think the tacos at El Nuevo are okay.  I'd probably learn to love them more if I were a Lakeview Yelper holding the Lakeview bias.  I think Taco Joint had at least one better taco (the chicken) as well as a cheaper margarita, so I can't possibly rate El Nuevo higher than Taco Joint.   Yelpers are overrating this one a bit.  It's three stars.",0.9764,0.829,0.125,0.045,0.5545646945646946

To be sure, I sorted through my credit card receipts from the past three months (yes, I keep my receipts for a long time) and concluded that the charge was not mine.

Four-and-a-half months later? SERIOUSLY?! Sure enough, I went a little further back in my credit card receipts to April and found the charge. Ummm, so why did it take so long to process my payment? I had started the process to cancel my credit card, reissue a new one, and file a fraud claim. Not a good way to do business!

Food: I got to try the Plantanos Con Crema (plantains with cream), their coconut shrimp dish ($14) and their chips with guacamole and salsa. All were very good, and I would definitely recommend all of the dishes I tried.  ... Originally I wanted to try the Carnitas Chipotle y Mango something but the server told me it was pretty spicy and I need to lay off spice for awhile... so I switched to the coconut shrimp, and I'm glad I did. Atmosphere: It's a smaller restaurant but has good indoor and outdoor seating. We sat outside and with the great weather it was perfect. Interior has nice ambience. Service: The server we had was great! He took good care of us, was friendly and helpful considering we were a large (and loud) party. :D Price: I think it is relatively reasonable for what you get. Most of the main entrees are over $10.  Note: I love good food, but can't say I'm a Mexican food expert by any means.",0.9978,0.667,0.333,0.0,0.6375091575091575

2010-07-05,4.0,"I'll admit, I was very skeptical of Mexican food in Chicago because I am from Texas and get delicious Mexican food here daily. So when my boyfriend suggested eating here, I have to say I was being kind of a Mexican food snob about it. To start off, the chips and salsa were pretty good. The chips were crispy and salty while the salsa was just a bit on the spicy side for me, but still good. I ordered the Verdes Chicken Enchilada while Jason ordered the Carnitas Chipotle con Mango y Platano. My enchiladas were surprisingly very flavorful and easy to cut into. Nothing too special but it was appetizing. The carnitas was tender and so, so good. The mango definitely brought a sweet taste. We were both very happy with our meals.  Service was really great here. Friendly staff and they were very good with the water which was so important because all the food had an extra kick. This place was great and had an authentic vibe. Great atmosphere and great food. However, I do have one complaint. The drinks are ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. I ordered the Mango Margarita and Mojito. The Margarita was awful - it tasted like frozen beer with a shot of tequila. A Mango Margarita may sound weird but I've had it plenty of times at various places and it is absolutely delicious. Perfect for summer. The Mojito was a bit better was far too minty for me. I would definitely go to this place again but I probably wouldn't order drinks but the food makes up for this shortcoming.",0.9977,0.649,0.285,0.066,0.6406349206349206

The margaritas were half off on this Tuesday night, so that was a good thing. It wasn't fine tequila but who cares it was Tuesday night. The Coco del Mar Breaded shrimp was excellent and if it wasn't for what happened next I would have made my rating a 4 star. Well, we were feeling good and having a good time so decided to get some dessert when disaster struck. The Fried Snow (Nieve Frita) was not fresh. I could taste the cornflakes were soggy from sitting in the freezer after being fried. I'm not a snob at all but why would they not just flash fry it fresh and serve it like it should be with a hot shell and cold ice cream inside. Just seems lazy or not thoughtful after giving your patrons such good entrées. I grilled the waiter but he would not admit that it was not fresh. In the words of Judge Judy, :""Don't pee on my leg and tell me it's raining."" I am not completely done with this place, but it seems if you want Fresh, go on busy nights like Friday. Sat.. Not sure if they ever make it fresh though. Curious to know. I would skip the fried ice cream or else you might get a soggy corn flake covered ice cream ball.

Carnitas Chipotle con Mango y Platano, good and spicy, but I wanted more plantains. I love plantains. 3. Tacos, burritos, and enchiladas are all very good. Overall, great service and good food.

2010-06-05,4.0,"After visiting El Nuevo more times than I can count, I figured it was time for a review. El Nuevo is my favorite Mexican restaurant in the city, never disappointing and always providing quality Mexican food. I am always impressed by the consistency and dimension of flavor involved in many of the dishes at El Nuevo.  I love the guacamole here. However, I always ask for extra fresh jalapenos for that added spice I crave. The jalapenos give it that extra kick I like my guacamole to have. The Queso Fundido with poblano strips is also a great start to a meal. I also really enjoy the salsa and chips that are provided and always quickly refilled as soon as you are close to getting low. The salsa has great flavor and spice to it. As for meals, they offer a great selection of creative dishes to satisfy your palate. I tend to always stick to the traditional chicken fajitas because I love their chicken, which is seasoned and spiced to perfection. I also recommend the Carne Asada con Salsa Verde and the Pollo en Mole Poblano con Ajonjoli, which are my boyfriend's favorite dishes and equally delicious.  The drinks at El Nuevo are no joke. I always find myself getting especially giggly after only one margarita. Try the Triple Fresh Squeezed Golden Cadillac for a change from the traditional margarita, for it is so fresh and the perfect addition to your meal. Although, you can't go wrong with their house margaritas. I also love the Pineapple Mojito.  In sum, El Nuevo provides consistent, delicious Mexican food that satisfies my weekly Mexican craving.",0.9975,0.723,0.263,0.014,0.606578947368421

That tells me right away this place is doing something right. There are so many Mexican joints that simply don't cut it from an authenticity standpoint,  you never know what you're going to get and for the most part you walk in any given one expecting to be underwhelmed.  However, this place passed the test with flying colores.  Loved coming here, loved the food, and the company. I love Mexican &  the proximity to mi casa. The Staff is super-friendly & the menu holds you hostage, as the options are so numerous and full of flavor you have to go back and sample everything you missed in your first few visits.  Add 65 degrees, and the atmosphere is straight off of an Ixtapa Xiuatanejo sandy beach.

To maximize your menu options, I highly recommend going with a group and loading up on everything.  I can't wait to go back and am uber excited at  the fact that I have a new summer eatery for top-notch outdoor lunches and dinners, as the patio is allegedly closed for the winter.   For the Catholics out there, I know it's hard for us to go out on Fridays this time of year.

We were going to a Schubas for a show and not being all that familiar with the neighborhood, I picked this place according to reviews on yelp. Our group was seated in the back of the restaurant which seemed appropriate for most large groups. The first good sign I noticed was that as we were ordering pitcher after pitcher (but it was really like carafe after carafe) of margaritas on the rocks they would also come with newly salted glasses that were full on arrival. I thought this was a really nice touch. The food was amazing, but unfortunately due to the multiple carafes I can really only account for my own dish which was a pan seared salmon in a green chile sauce. My friend sitting next to me went on a recommendation of our helpful waiter and got some sort of spicy pork medalions with flour tortillas. Everyone else at the table was pleased as well and I looked like a hero b/c I picked the place. The last perk was that they let me bring in a birthday cake, that they served with a round of tequilla shots on the house. Not sure if that's customary, but greatly appreciated nonetheless. Please remember if you go in a large group, they will only add 18% gratuity to the bill, so make sure to bump it up and give these guys their deserving 20.",0.9927,0.804,0.184,0.011,0.5183149226252675
2010-01-19,4.0,"Since I know different folks have different expectations of their colorfully-decorated Mexican-American restaurants, I'm going to start this review out with a warning: this is not the place to go if you want a fishbowl of syrupy alcoholic beverages and food you don't have to think about.   Like any casual joint of its ilk worth its margarita salt, El Nuevo Mexicano starts you out with chips and salsa. The brightly flavored tomato salsa is satisfyingly spicy, but the addictive black pepper-studded tortilla chips really elevate this pre-meal freebie. My pineapple mojito tasted like pineapple, not some syrup scientist's approximation thereof, and the same can be said for the boyfriend's pomegranate-flavored one (substituting the word ""pomegranate"" for ""pineapple,"" of course). Neither version suffered from the saccharine-sweet syndrome that afflicts so many of the restaurant mojitos in this town, and they're just $4 a pop on Monday nights.  My chicken mole poblano was smothered in a slightly sweet and vaguely vinegary sauce. The beauty of house-made mole (and theirs is) is that everyone's got a different version, though I usually like mine on the spicier side. The mound of crisp lettuce and spinach nestled between my rice and refried beans was several cuts above your standard wilted iceberg afterthought and added a cool counterpoint to a heavy dish. Boyfriend reported that his Tilapia Al Mojo de Ajo was tender and devoid of bones. We both liked the veggie-heavy plating of the dish, and he thought that the big avocado chunks on top of his fish were a nice addition. I was too busy using warm corn tortillas to remove all evidence of mole on my plate to determine whether or not I agreed. Service was attentive without being overbearing, and our water glasses were never empty (though we came late on a Monday night and only three other tables were occupied). The ambiance is warmer and less neon-centric than that other Mexican place down the street.    El Nuevo Mexicano isn't doing anything revolutionary, and I wouldn't want them to.

I was trying to decide between the Beef Chiles Rellenos (my absolute favorite Mexican dish, which sadly enough, few restaurants have them stuffed with beef but instead only offer the dominating, artery-clogging cheese ones) or the Pollo en Mole Poblano.  The handsome waiter recommended the mole and HOLEY MOLEY was it YUMMY!  Mole has to be made just right; a little spice, lots of chocolate-cinnamon flavor, and a thick yet smooth texture--All were there.  Accompanied by rice, beans and a side salad, it surely hit the spot.  The other's entrees of enchiladas and a combo something-or-other were also delightful.   We were extremely pleased with our visit and I'd recommend El Nuevo Mexicano to others who love their Yelp, alcohol and comida mexicana as much as I do.  Oh and there's something so wonderful about seeing .3 cents on a bill.  If only it happened more often.  Be sure to check out their little portal with La Maria Santisima on the wall (you can't miss it, especially since the restaurant is tiny).  Making Open Table reservations isn't a bad idea on a weekend night.",0.9952,0.795,0.19,0.015,0.6222902494331066

We went for dinner on a Saturday night - easily making reservations through Open Table - and had a wonderful meal. We started with the guacamole - very avocado-y. I could see why people didn't like this but I looooooooooved it. I don't like my guacamole very spicy or salty. For dinner, my husband had the carne asada and I had the tilapia limon. Both wonderful. The tilapia had a lovely lemon jalepeno caper sauce. I wasn't too thrilled with the chipotle mashed potatoes or the minimal grilled veggies, but the tilapia was excellent so I didn't really care that much.

2009-11-17,2.0,"I must preface this review by saying I'm a Mexican food fanatic. I looked for reviews on Yelp and El Nuevo's reviews looked ok. I ordered a taco and a cheese enchilada. The taco was miniature. I will give them props for the crispiness of the shell, but the filling was mediocre. My margarita was overpowered by the tequila (in a bad way). The salsa was spicy enough but lacking in overall taste, a weird phenomenon which seems to be unique to Chicago. A nit pick, having nothing to do with the food. I knew the place would probably not be that good when we sat down and they had the bucket seats which make it nearly impossible to reach the table (the arm of the chair intersects with the table making it impossible to scoot forward). My friend who is 6'4"" had a hard time reaching. How would the average person fare? Perhaps they are banking on a person of a heftier variety? Either way, I'd like the option to scoot my chair up to the table. This oversight in planning made me wonder if the restaurant could be all it was cracked up to be, and it wasn't. Either way, if you still want to go. Make a reservation. The jerk who taking names was indiscriminately turning people away who didn't have them even though tables were clearly available.",0.3074,0.863,0.076,0.062,0.6060763888888888
2009-11-11,4.0,"I ate here today and was pleased with the overall experience. The place is small and cozy. It has decorations in it that give it a south of the border feel. You are transported to Mexico, with it. The music also give it an authentic feel.  The food is delicious. I had a Salmon, veggie combo dish. I was expecting a small plate, like at other restaurants, but here, the plate was huge. Big ups here. This place is definitely not a rip off, like most upscale joints. My only complaint here, hence the 4 stars instead of 5 I would have given it, is the service is a bit on the below average side. I sat down and looked at the menu. I determined what I wanted and flagged the waiter. I had to raise my hand 3 times to get his attention to order. After that he was efficient. His tip suffered as a result of his early negligence.

2009-10-23,5.0,"i went to the special four course tequila dinner at el nuevo last night. i arrived with my date at 6:30, and we were promptly seated.  i think there was a little hitch with the tequila flight that we were supposed to start our meal with - the gentleman providing the tequila seemed to be running a bit late - we noticed him walk in with boxes of the stuff after we had already been seated. this was completely fine with me, since the tequila flight turned out to be two full shots and i'd rather not do tequila on an empty stomach!  that being said, we munched on chips and salsa (which were even better than i remembered) until our first margarita arrived (two were included with the meal - this one was traditional and very good.) our first course was a hefty helping of guacamole - we each got our own, but the portion was large enough that we could have easily shared. we made sure to save the leftovers for later in our meal.  second course was a choice between a chicken or spinach empanada, a shrimp quesadilla or a seafood ceviche. we went with the empanada and the quesadilla. both very good, but i have to say the empanada won in the match up. it was at this point in our meal that the tequila showed up. i was already a little tipsy from the first margarita, so we took mini shots of the first tequila - el jimador repesado - and saved the other one for later.  third course was a choice between carne asada, a tilapia and a vegetarian chile relleno. we went with the carne asada and tilapia - at this point, we were being gluttonous. we could have easily ordered the entrees and had chips and salsa, and we still would have been full. during our third course, our second margarita arrived - this time, pomegranate. it tasted a little too much like fruit punch to me, but i was already feeling pretty good from the first margarita and our tequila flight - we finish the el jimador silver shot during our third course, it was delicioso! - so i didn't really need to drink it anyway.  somehow, we left a little room for desert. we tried both the pumpkin flan and the chocolate chimichangas. both of them were to die for. especially the chocolate chimichangas. chocolate overload. after almost everyone had finished dining, the gentleman who brought the el jimador came out and gave a quick tequila 101, and also answered a bunch of questions from everyone in the restaurant. i know this is a lengthy review, but i simply cannot say enough about our night - it was absolutely wonderful. the service was outstanding too. we left feeling stuffed, tipsy - okay, kinda drunk, and like we got away with highway robbery - the entire dinner only cost $28 per person! i still can't believe it. the two margaritas and two shots of tequila had to be worth $28 alone. if el nuevo does one of these things again, do yourself a favor and sign up - you won't be disappointed!",0.9961,0.831,0.141,0.027,0.4873779574722971

My friend ordered a shrimp dish that was served with a red smokey sauce, pine nuts and cilantro rice. Now my friend is sort of ""white"" meaning she can't handle a whole lot of heat. That said, she asked if they could make her dish a little more mild. I think that request resulted in a overly smokey tasting dish.

I don't ask much of a Mexican restaurant. I ask you to stick some veggies, beans maybe some meat in a tortilla, throw some cheese on top, wrap it all up and ladle some sauce of varying heat (depending on my taste that night) over it all. Maybe throw some extra rice and beans on the side and I'm satisfied. Their menu comes through on that and also takes it to the next level with some interesting dishes if you choose to search them out, dressed with plantains, peaches or the zenith of all sides, the chipotle mashed potatoes. And be sure to wash that down with some sangria or mango margaritas (You can choose another drink, but don't say I didn't try) So let's recap, shall we?

(it sounded as sincere as a ""my bad"")   They refilled our water and immediately brought her a new- vegetarian- stuffed pepper.  We thought our bad luck would end there; However, before she was done eating the pepper (her fork was still in her mouth!) they cleared our plates!!!   We then waited for another 10 minutes (we timed it) hoping to get the dessert menu- after all, we were going to go all out, if you're dining out for a good cause you don't want to get a skimpy meal (and the food itself was really good, we were looking forward to having a great dessert) - but when our waiter arrived back he placed our bill on the table, without even offering us desserts, said ""whenever you're ready"" and walked away.  When he came back, less than 1 minute later, we paid and decided we would just get dessert somewhere else; which is a shame, because we probably would have ordered a dessert and forgotten the fact that the second part of her meal was rushed.  (And more money would have gone to a good cause.)   At no point was the restaurant full (there were at least 4 more tables available) so we don't believe they were deliberately trying to rush us, but their actions made it a less than memorable dining experience.",0.9838,0.825,0.111,0.064,0.5679956709956712

I think too many places here just figure people won't care what they eat while they're drinking a 5-shot margarita. El Nuevo seems to be a good compromise, and the bottom line is that I really like coming here.  First of all, THEY HAVE THE BEST SALSA EVER, PERIOD. Of course it's sitting there waiting for you right when you sit down, along with a never-ending plate of tortilla chips. The salsa is worth coming here for alone: very spicy, cool and citrusy, and the perfect consistency to balance on the chip without being chunky. I have never tasted salsa this good, even after spending a bunch of time in Oaxaca. For food, their appetizers are usually pretty good, with my fav being the hongos borrachos. The guac is definitely above average, but I still make better stuff in my own kitchen. For food, I enjoy the chiles rellenos (rather authentically done, I might add), their enchiladas are always good, and the combinacion vegeteriana is a delight for a meatless meal (they give you a chile relleno, small rice/bean burrito, and little guacamole burrito/fritter thing).  Their margaritas are also great, of course (and fairly strong but not stupidly so). Nice outdoor patio. I think two margaritas and dinner for two would be around 50.

2007-11-26,4.0,"So after reading Lara W. and Dave S.'s review I decided to check out El Nuevo Mexicano and boy am I glad that I did. We got there on Friday around 6pm and the place was empty. What can I say we are early eaters for this neighborhood. The restaurant was cozy and rustic looking and I loved the leather wicker chairs they had. The only drawback to the restaurant is that it seemed to be freezing in there. It almost felt like the air was on.  I started with a bowl of tortilla soup. Mmm, the soup had a nice smokey chipotle flavor to it and it had black beans, cheese and avocado on top of it was very hearty. That along with the sangria warmed me up. Sangria could have been better but eh...I won't fault them too much. I went with the chile rellenos because that is what I will usually order to test out a new mexican restaurant. If they can't make a decent chile relleno than they can't have me as a patron. The chile relleno was muy bueno but next time I will ask for the sauce on the side. Nothing more depressing than a soggy chile relleno. My entree was served with rice, beans and corn tortillas. It was yummy yummy for my tummy. No, I am not still drunk from the two sangria's...I'm just being goofy.  For dessert I ordered the flan and Rich ordered the chocolate chimichangas. Loved my flan but didn't even bother to taste the chimichangas...not a big fan of chocolate, sorry.  The service was very friendly and very accommodating. Oh and by the time I got my soup the restaurant was pretty much filled to capacity.  The topper was the cinnamon candy at the end. At first I thought it was just one of those lame star brite peppermint candies....nope, cinnamon candy baby! Oh, yeah! Score! So I will definitely be back to El Neuvo Mexicano but in the meantime I might email them a decent sangria recipe.",0.993,0.797,0.164,0.039,0.5849862258953168
2007-11-21,3.0,"It is very unfortunate that I have to give this place only three stars. The food was the tastiest Mexican food by far that I have had. My combo plate tasted GREAT! I had the Tijuana Combo which was very tasty, hearty and filled me up nicely.  Well worth the $14 price tag. My only issue was with my Carne Asada which was very tough and very difficult to cut and to eat.  I sampled Lara's Camarones al Mojo de Ajo and the garlic was too overpowering  and it seemed very dry . It was just not my cup of tea. I just had water to drink and I was disappointed that he came by three times to refill our waters and mine only got topped off once even though it could have used a refill each time.  I know my body and I know what kinds of foods I can and cannot eat. I know what kinds of foods give me digestive problems.  At about 5:00 am I knew that I was going to have major malfunctions with my digestive tract. I will spare the details but my system was thrown into a serious uproar.  I know it wasn't the oatmeal or soup I had that day so I knew right away who the culprit was. I am finally 100% again at the time this review was published from Monday evening at 8:00 pm. I will be back El Nuevo because Lara loved it and your food was yummy but if you do this to my digestive system again, you will never see me again.",0.8637,0.884,0.069,0.047,0.7182086167800454

Overall, I'd say the food was closer to a 4, but the service was a 1.5-2 range.  I have to give it a 3 for Sarah & Craig though - they swear it was abnormal that night.  I sure hope it was.",0.8285,0.912,0.063,0.025,0.5049382716049382

However, in reality I'm told that I act more like a drunken circus clown on steroids. Either way, I always have a fabulous time. Let's do a little comparison here, shall we? 1 pitcher of margarita from Caesars, home of the ""killer margarita"" (consumed by myself) = sober + that sickly feeling of ""!@#$, I just drank my body weight in sugar.

It's full of onions, garlic, cilantro, and fresh, let me emphasize again, FRESH avocado. If you don't like onions and garlic, you won't like this guac.

2007-06-25,2.0,"Went here on a Sunday night with 4 friends. We sat right up in the front window, which was a nice secluded seating. Hmm, I didn't even check out the patio but should have done so I guess.  Everything to me was just okay. The prices were fair for what the potions were, but the quality lacked a little for me. I had chili relenos (which I love). They tasted too tomato-like with the sauce I had. My friends had fajitas (chicken and shrimp) which I tried and, again, just tasted alright. It'd be comparable to if I went out to Jewel, bought semi-fresh, quality ingredients, and made them at home. Is that memorable? I think not. The best thing anyone had was a salmon dish that was a special recommended by the waiter. it had a damn spicy sauce topped with raisins and slices of mango. It was a cleverly interesting combination which I enjoyed.  RJW is right, the service was lacking to me. We ordered margaritas, they took 10 minutes to get. We wanted a check at the end of the meal, that took another 10 minutes. I am not saying it was extreme disservice, let's just say it was noticeable to me b/c I used to be a server, and a damn good one at that! I would have given this place 3 stars, but again RJW is right in saying that the owners must have loaded up their yelp review with 5 star reviews and pictures.

I'd say lukewarm characterized the entire experience, and I simply couldn't go back regularly because of the sub-par guac.  Too bad, because there were other good foods there.  If you don't like guac, you're golden, how about that?",0.9707,0.809,0.153,0.038,0.4466959706959706

I refuse to attend a place that serves you the stuff from a plastic bottle, and this place definitely does not. their tequila selection is strong for such a small place and they serve up a good margarita.  The greatest thing about this place though is it's weekly specials. Monday-Thursday they have half off on something. Monday is mojitos, tuesday margaritas, wednesday x-rated margaritas, and thursday margarita pitchers. I STRONGLY recommend attending on Mondays and Wednesdays. There mojitos are made with strong amounts of fresh lime and mint leaves and you are able to watch the bartender across the restaurant muddle them himself and good amounts of bacardi rum. Their x-rated margarita is one of the best diverse takes on a margarita I've found in the city. They make a margarita and add additional x-rated passion fruit fusion liquor, and it makes this YUMMMMY! bonus: each of these drinks end up being $4 after the half off.

The unique deviation from the usual tortilla-wrapped bag o' meat that constitutes a standard burrito made this dish very easy to eat in a civilized fashion while preventing the usual post-burrito gut bomb.

Number one -- Maria, the owner, is one of the nicest people in the business. They recently finished a pretty decent internal makeover, which opened up the seating much better. The menu is still among the most inventive, esp. their fish dishes, and their sauces are worthy of any la cocina de la Abuela. Two -- GREAT service -- everyone is smiling and friendly and bustles to get to you. Margaritas are big (although Jacky doesn't like that they seem to use table salt on the rims...) and delicious (and strong), and the salsa is nice and spicy. New addition Erin (hostess) is a total kick in the head, and she is hopefully a keeper...gracious and inviting, our guests (first-timers) were just as impressed as we had hoped they would be.
