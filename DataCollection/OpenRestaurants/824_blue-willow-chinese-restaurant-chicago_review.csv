FYI fried rice is always a safe option when visiting a Chinese restaurant. The fried egg roll was good and crunchy. Everything was hot and fresh. The older gentleman that took my order wasn't overly friendly, but he was fine. The dining room looked authentic with nice booths. AC was off on a hot night, but the place was pretty empty.

2015-09-21,2.0,"As a former New Yorker, I am forever in the search for decent Chinese food here in Chicago, and sorry Blue Willow, but you are not it.  Sad too, because I just moved to this area, and I've been here once before with an acquaintance who said they ate there regularly.  I ordered for pick up, but when I got there the place was empty.  Tons of cheap things you can buy at the counter, like charms and trinkets and what-not.  I ordered potstickers, the chicken and broccoli, which in NYC was my hands down fav and General Tso's chicken as a back up, because I've noticed that while Chicago can't seem to get chicken & broccoli right, they don't do too bad with the Tso's.   The potstickers seemed undercooked, and tasted quite doughy. The chicken & broccoli was bland and flavorless, so I switched immediately to the Tso's, which seemed to be welded together by the force of either the sauce or the breading...so in trying to pick up one piece, I ended up picking up about 5.  However it was prepared, it entirely desiccated the chicken, so I was eating hunks of breaded and sauced hardness....and the sauce wasn't even that flavorful.  So I guess if I'm ever really drunk and in the mood for something that doesn't taste like anything but fills my stomach and is nearby, I'll stop in again.

2014-10-06,1.0,"I think I should preface this review by stating that I understand that this is a generic inexpensive Chinese restaurant and I believe my expectations were proportionately low when I decided to order take-out from Blue Willow. Even with that mindset I found this to be possibly the worst Chinese food I have ever had. My girlfriend and I ordered the Hot & Sour Soup, Mongolian Beef and Chicken & Garlic combination platters.  The Hot & Sour Soup could more accurately have been described as Hot & Sweet Soup. I understand that Hot & Sour Soup calls for a small amount of sugar but the sweetness in this dish was overwhelming. It also lacked any sour/vinegar. Finally, there were very few mushrooms (the best part, as far I'm concerned) which was a huge disappointment.  The Mongolian Beef was recommended by several Yelpers so I gave that a try. Instead of being spicy and flavorful it was bland and very oily. Also, the beef was very fatty/chewy and vaguely resembled brains. I didn't expects filet mignon but the quality of this meat was really off-putting.  My girlfriend's Chicken & Garlic (?) (Chicken in Garlic Sauce, something along those lines) was passable but it was very oily and bland.  Finally, the pork-fried rice that came with our dishes was perhaps the most edible of all the things we ordered but was also very oily and discolored which sort of made it seem like the restaurant recycles their oil or something. I don't know. It was bad. I will never go again. You shouldn't either.",0.802,0.871,0.078,0.051,0.5399166666666668

Not pieces of pork with some fat on them. Literally giant hunks of slimy fat. Ordering the delivery should have been an indication.

The dishes are loaded with canned vegetables like  water chestnuts, bamboo shoots, baby corn and yes, CANNED MUSHROOMS (bleh), and use the fresh things like bok choy, broccoli and peapods every so sparingly. I've ordered....  Mongolian Beef. The sauce offers a perfectly sweet and spicy, slightly BBQ'd smokey Mongolian flavor and I like that the saucey meat and onions are served atop a bed of fried noodles. But beyond that, it's actually a ridiculously oily dish and beef is tough.  Shrimp Chow Fun. The vegetable were mostly off the canned variety + one or two bits of fresh broccoli and bok choy. The shrimp was definitely not fresh. Although it was pink, indicating that it was cooked, it's not fully obaque and has a sort of clear glassiness to it, which is really quite unappetizing. The texture was mealy -- leading me to believe it was frozen, thawed and re-frozen before being used. The sauce was white and 100% without any flavor -- not even a slight hint of garlic or ginger.  Crab Rangoons. Nice size and triangular shape, but zero flavor. Some places offer crab rangoons that are slightly sweet with a nice green onion depth, others more of a sweet crab flavor without so much onion. Blue Willow's are neither sweet nor savory; they're simply deep fried wonton stuffed with a very plain cream cheese.  Orange Chicken. Nice sweet, spicy orangey sauce flavor, but very greasy.  The fried chicken was ill prepared, resulting in gobs of sauce soaked breading and only tiny bits of meat. I liked the steamed broccoli garnish -- at least it was fresh veg, unlike that in my Shrimp Chow Fun. Szechuan Chicken.

The sesame chicken had too much breading on them and I could barely taste the chicken.  When I did taste the chicken, it was tough and overcooked as well.  The fried rice was ehh, alright I guess.  The egg roll is still sitting in my fridge and more than likely I will throw it out this weekend.  The only good thing I can really say is that the serving sizes for both dishes were pretty generous, but unfortunately the rest of the meal was disappointing.  It's really too bad since it's the only Chinese restaurant in my neighborhood within walking distance.  I guess I'll have to settle for delivery instead.",-0.7221,0.832,0.081,0.087,0.5965277777777777

2009-01-20,4.0,"An above average neighborhood Chinese restaurant, and better than many I've been to in the city. The menu here seems to be a little more extensive than many neighborhood Chinese places I've eaten at, prices are very reasonable throughout, and it doesn't hurt that I noticed they have over 15 lunch specials for $4.95 you can choose from if you go on weekdays before 3pm. I met up with 2 others here, and we all got the family dinner for 3 special($32.50). They also have family dinner specials for 2 and 4 people($22 and 44 respectively), and basically in all their shared dinner specials each person gets an egg roll, choice of soup, hot tea, and shared portions of Mongolian Beef(which you can order mild instead of spicy), and 1-3 additional entrees based on how many share the dinner special. The entree portions they give are somewhat on the greasy side, but were very sizable and great for leftovers. Entrees were tasty and good enough(our special came with Hong Sue Shrimp and Chicken Chop Suey, besides Mongolian Beef), but neither really great nor terrible. The only small complaint I had is that the booths were on the wee bit small side if you're tall(like myself), but at least it isn't as bad as some restaurants I've dined at in the past. What really stood out about Blue Willow, and how it clinched an additional star, is that they do have really good hot tea and great smoothies(love the option of NOT having bubbles/pearls in the latter, unlike many Chinese/Thai/etc. restaurants!). I would agree with others about the family proprietors being friendly, despite the occasional language barriers.  Finally, they do a very brisk take-out business, and I couldn't help but notice how they tended to have great timing on getting the orders done before people even arrived to pick up their food. I'm sure I'd probably get take-out from here often, if I were to live in Logan Square.",0.9962,0.803,0.182,0.015,0.49856240981240973

The interior is unremarkable and the Chinese food is fine but unexceptional.  Just a friendly, inexpensive, local restaurant. There is, however, a secret within that makes this otherwise ordinary restaurant worthy of four stars.  As far as the Chinese menu goes, they offer the standards with a very affordable lunch special.  For around 5.00,  you get soup, an appetizer and an entree. This is very popular lunch spot in the neighborhood, especially with families.  Definitely a kid friendly establishment and people really do seem to enjoy it.  They do a fairly brisk business at lunch, but I've never see a wait for a table.    While I'm not enamored of the Chinese food here,  I must admit that I enjoy the crab rangoon, especially when I'm hung over and it is served with a side of  the hot sauce that is made on-site by the grandfather.  This hot sauce is a fantastic concoction - pungent and savory with just enough kick to make you take notice - and is the real reason I give them four stars. Definitely my fave hot sauce in the city, I swear I could drink the stuff.  Apparently, they do a brisk business on the side with this intoxicating liquid, so you can actually purchase it in large quantities.  Make sure you ask for it when you order, they don't hand it out otherwise.  They also have a  ""special"" menu, which is where they hide the Korean food!  Who knew - Korean food in Logan Square? This could be a trend - the Fullerton Diner at the corner recently added a few Korean dishes to their menu as well. The Blue Willow only offers  Chap Chae (about 7.00 with chicken or beef, 8.00 with shrimp)  and Cham Bong (6.50), but both are fairly tasty, with the Cham Bong being big enough to share and packed to the brim with shrimp and chicken. There are better places in town to get Korean, certainly, but not south of Lawrence and not at such bargain prices. Also not on the menu is kim chee - be sure to ask for a side of it. Always great and, I suspect, also homemade.",0.997,0.791,0.182,0.026,0.5461068845684232
