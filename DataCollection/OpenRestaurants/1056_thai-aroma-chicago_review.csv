2016-03-08,1.0,"We live nearby and had been ordering take out from here pretty consistently for some time - - not because it is good, but because it isn't bad, except for one occasion they have been pretty consistent and the location has been convenient for us to do so.  Once, when we first started ordering from them but had ordered the same items maybe four or five times previously, they completely screw up our order which was pretty amazing since we used the ""Beyond Menu"" app to order and simply selected items from their menu. They must have been out of the right ingredients as they made something entirely different. By the time we were home with our food and ready to eat, we realized the mistake but they were closed already. They were rude about it over the phone and if I recollect, actually insinuated that it was my fault. (!!) We decided to give them another chance - - because who doesn't deserve another chance, right? Well, they did alright by us for a few more years - - mediocre but consistent and consistency is the key to many things in life. So, we kept ordering from them....   This leads me to what happened this past Wednesday evening. We had just gotten back into town and were running errands. We realized it would be too late to cook so we ordered takeout. One of us goes in to pick up the food and comes back out to find our car battery has died during the five minutes while we were picking up the food!!!!.  It is a bitter cold Chicago night and we cannot leave the car in front of this restaurant on busy North Avenue overnight so we make arrangements for AAA to come and give us a jump or a tow. In the mean time, it is 25 degrees outside so we don't want to eat in our chilly car if we can avoid it.  We have this takeout we bought not five minutes earlier from this very restaurant that we are right in front of so it seems like a no-brainer to go back inside and ask if we can eat the food they just sold us inside their restaurant, right? We go inside and ask if we can eat it there (we tipped on it in case you are wondering) and the waitress tells us we cannot eat the food there because she just finished ""cleaning"" !!!!!! It is 8:54 PM and they close at 10:00 PM. I've worked in restaurants - - this one is a far cry from having any ambiance of any kind.  Cleaning up after us would not have been a big deal....really it would have been nothing, not to mention having actual customers in the window is generally good for business...and not to mention that simply being kind to people is good business. We were lucky we were able to walk home (by the time we got home the AAA guy called to say he was at our car so we had to go right back - - all of 25 minutes later!) For the life of me I cannot fathom why someone would treat a customer that way. She was ready to turn away customers for the next hour and five minutes so that she could watch TV (which is what she promptly turned her attention to after telling us we couldn't eat there).  I worked in the restaurant industry for 15 years. Put myself through school twice by working in restaurants, and I cannot come up with an explanation that would excuse her for her behavior - - and this time we won't be giving them another chance.",0.99,0.844,0.107,0.049,0.46776477832512314

Those last three ingredients are generally not something you'd expect in tom kha soup and just made it taste like something from Papa John's. The potstickers were filled with chicken that tasted like it came out of a can and was old. The soba noodles also came with balls of the can chicken and--huzzah--more spinach. Spinach everywhere. Don't get me wrong, I like spinach, tomatoes, and white mushrooms, but those are not things that belong or taste well in the dishes I ate.

I wanted to get Thai food from Ben's Noodle and Rice up where I used to live in Edgewater (it's the best I've had in the city).  So I ordered what I usually get at Ben's. Pad Thai. Extra spicy. Chicken. Add Cilantro.  With the craving I had for Thai, I couldn't wait to eat. I opened up the bowl. First thing I noticed. No cilantro. Second thing I noticed - no green onions - any good Thai place always includes green onions in their pad thai. Third. The chicken was overcooked and very dry. At least it was edible, but I threw out my leftovers. Even now that I live in Old Town, I'd drive back up to Edgewater just to get Ben's.  In summary: Pass this place up.

Turns out that on the short walk from the restaurant to the El while I was holding the bag by its handles exactly as they had given it to me, almost the entire dish had seeped out of the container and was sloshing around in the bottom of the plastic bag. This was all due to an ill fitting lid on the food container. Then, what I was able to salvage (when I got back to my office) was mediocre at best. The sauce was extremely greasy and barely had a curry or coconut milk flavor. It was basically a bland sauce with some chilies thrown in (I asked for a heat level of 3 out of 6).

So have you ever seen a diagram of what a blocked artery looks like?  With yellow congealed blockage?  That's what my sweet and sour chicken looked like.  The breading peeled off easily, the pieces of chicken were tiny and the inside of the breading was bright yellow, greasy and entirely unappetizing.  I know that sweet and sour chicken is really unhealthy, but that was way too gross looking to be eaten.   I also ordered the crab rangoon and baby eggrolls.  Unnecessary to say that the whole meal was unhealthy as greasy Thai/Asian food usually is, but this was disgusting.  Everything tasted the same as thought the grease hadn't been changed for months.  The crab rangoon had the consistency of what I imagine fried butterballs to be like.  The baby eggrolls tasted like miscellaneous meat french fries.  GROSS! I felt fine after waking up, but a couple of hours later I felt the typical symptoms of mild food poisoning.  I felt clammy and booted for 15 mins.  I can't leave my house because I have what olestra claims as a common side effect.  Making myself redundant, I am not feeling well. I will stay as far away from Thai Aroma as possible as I fear even the sight of that place will make me ill again.",-0.9515,0.732,0.111,0.157,0.5111904761904762
2009-11-09,5.0,"Ok...before you think ""5 stars? This b***h is crazy"", let me explain. I give Thai Aroma 5 stars because a) it's cheap & fast, b) it's totally walkable from my place, 3) it's BYOB, 4) it's super tasty and 5) it's become my go-to order out place. If that doesn't justify my 5 stars I don't know what does. I always order the lemon grass tofu & always leave Thai Aroma stuffed, happy, and with the best aftertaste I've ever experienced. It's not greasy nor cheap tasting, which is always a good thing. Also, they don't skimp on the tofu which so many other places do. The fresh peppers, mushrooms, bamboo, and onions combined with the firm tofu & lemony/salty sauce equals perfection in my book.

Also fun?  Using chopsticks.  She's a natural.

What a change a single delivery order can make.  Last night, while working from home and absolutely not feeling like venturing into my kitchen, I ordered pot stickers and BBQ fried rice from Aroma. The pot stickers arrived cold and burnt.  I'm not talking about a nice brown crust.  It seemed that someone forgot about the dumplings, let them smoke in a saute pan, and then just dumped them in a carryout container.  Unfortunately, that was the best part of the meal. The BBQ pork friend rice was, in essence, sticky white rice mashed into a clear plastic carry out container and covered with about 2 cups of BBQ sauce.  Arranged over the top of the rice were 7 slices of thinly sliced and dried out pork (also cold) smothered in yet more BBQ sauce.  The highlight of this meal was the garnish.  2 tomato wedges and a few slices of fresh, crunchy English cucumber.  I ended up eating the garnish and a few slices of pork with a forkful or two of rice - it was all I could rescue out of that container swimming in sauce.  Thank goodness for microwaveable popcorn.  It saved my night.  Aroma has a $12 minimum order for delivery.  My order came to $14, delivery fee was an extra $3 and tip was another $4.  I should have just called Thalia and ordered the $20 worth of food to get them to deliver.  Aroma has lost my business.",0.934,0.816,0.115,0.069,0.4863945578231291

2008-08-25,2.0,"So I wrote my review last night as I was waiting for Aroma to deliver my food. I guess I spoke too soon, because they made a major change in their menu. First of all, they raised their prices. I get it, the economy sucks and the price of rice noodles has increased substantially. Right? I was also charged $3 for delivery when the new, updated menu that came with my food said that the delivery charge was $2. Whatever, it's a buck, I can deal. But the big problem was the noodles in the Pad Thai. Rather than the typical long noodles that every other Thai place in the world (well maybe just America) uses, this order was made with these short, tiny, super thin clear noodles that were thinner than angel hair and about two inches long each. Weird, but I figured it couldn't taste much different--they are still rice noodles, right? Wrong! So I took a bite and the texture and taste of these new noodles was just gross. I figured this had to be a mistake. Rarely one to complain on the spot (I'd rather just bitch on Yelp :) ), I called the restaurant back to ask what the deal was. Conversation between myself and the woman who picked up: Me: ""Hi, I just ordered Pad Thai for delivery and it came with the wrong noodles. They are small and very thin clear noodles."" Lady: ""Yes, we changed the noodles, these new ones taste much better!"" Me: ""Oh so you are using these permanently? I don't like how they taste--and I always loved your Pad Thai!"" Lady: ""Sorry!"" and hung up Okay so she really likes the new noodles. I picked the chicken out of the noodles and ate that. Anyway, the crab rangoon was still good.
