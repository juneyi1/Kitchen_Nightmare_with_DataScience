I'd be remiss to not mention that the interior of the restaurant also exudes charm and character. Like many have said, it's akin to stepping into a Polish grandma's house and it's a wonderful and comforting respite from the uber modern digs of most Chicago restaurants. If I had to offer a criticism I would say the restaurant really needs to remove the credit card sign from the doorway if only cash is to be accepted. Also there needs to be more than one waiter at a given time. Not that the service was poor, but the server was certainly rushed.

To be frank, this place is a total SCAM! I have never felt so tricked and used as a customer in a public restaurant, or any facility for that matter. The waiter makes it sound like he's bringing you some ""on the house"" juice and starters and then takes your menus away before you can even order. HE tells you what he's bringing you and before you know it a smorgasbord of polish food you DID NOT ask for appears on your table. You start to wonder what the hell is happening, but your gut instinct gets overridden with the thought that ""people are inherently good and that everything will be okay."" Listen to your gut because you will then get handed a bill for 150+ dollars for the food you had no say in.

The potato filling was soft and smooth textured, and the cheese gave it depth. The meat was a classic meaty filling, similar to a ravioli.

Next up was a salad...both were served with what tasted like a homemade creamy dressing and a sour relish I was unfamiliar with.  Really good.  And the food keeps coming...

2016-11-03,2.0,"I read all of these reviews and wondered if I ate at the same restaurant as everyone else, until I got to the lower-rating reviews. To start: I appreciate that this is a small family-owned restaurant - we go out of our way to support them. The Polish Museum, just a few blocks away, positioned this as ""the best polish food in Chicago"". I politely disagree. The food is good but I've had better pierogis before. But that didn't bother me. Nor did the mismatched place settings or the very basic decor. What really bothered me was the guy behind the counter. He appears to be friendly and helpful but I think he is a bit manipulative. When we got there it was 3:30 PM. We were VERY clear about just wanting to share a plate of pierogis and have some water and that was it. Same thing as the previous reviews, he immediately brought over some type of juice that we didn't want and didn't order. My partner being nice took it but I refused it - didn't want it. He assured us that he wouldn't charge us for it and good - he shouldn't. Then he started going on about all the soups and things he would bring us. Once again we assured him that we didn't want any of that, we just wanted to split a plate of pierogis. About 20 minutes later, he brought over 3 plates: one pierogi, one latkes, one blintzes. We were stunned. After he brought the food he was less friendly; I guess his job was done. But the worst thing for me was when I asked for a refill of my water, he took my glass, stuck his ""HAND"" in the ice bucket and then put it in my glass. Obviously I didn't drink it. In the end, our $8.50 snack turned into $26.00. It left a very sour taste in our mouths. We won't be back. Some people may like someone taking control like this and ordering for you. We didn't appreciate it. My recommendation is that he sit back and ""LISTEN"" to his customers. When appropriate there is clear value in having someone order for you and making recommendations.

Then asked us if we trusted him (yes). He took our menus and said he would bring us out food. He started us off with a white borscht soup with bits of sausage (delicious!).

I can honestly say that this was a top 20 meal that I've ever paid for. Everything was delicious, the stuffed cabbage was nice and moist, sausages are to die for, the pierogis were good - the sour krout ones were my favorite, crepes weren't too sweet.

My husband and I came here for dinner on a Monday night a little before 5:30 pm. We walked in and were eventually acknowledged by an older woman behind the counter. We sat the counter and decided to order the following: Roast Pork dinner, $15.75 prior to tax- My husband originally wanted the spare ribs, but the woman who took our order said they were out of it. When my husband asked for another item, she said the same. She told us they still have roast pork and roast beef though. This entree comes with a salad (shredded beets, picked vegetables and sliced cucumbers with yogurt sauce) and soup (my husband picked barley). We really liked the salad, especially the beets and yogurt sauce on the sliced cucumbers. The soup was warm (perfect for the cold and windy day) and tasted good.  The portion size of the entree plate was quite generous. The mashed potato was somewhat lumpy, but I liked it. The gravy was tasty. The roast pork was moist and tasty.  Potato & Cheese Pierogi, $7.75 prior to tax- I thought the pierogies were pretty good. The skin was a good chew and was cooked perfectly. But I just wished the filling had just a little bit more salt to it (which is a rare thing I ever ask for from restaurant food). This entree comes with 10 pieces which is plenty to make for 1 meal or perfect to share with another person. ---------------------------------- (Total= $26 after tax, prior to tip) Service was not very attentive and not too friendly (but that didn't really bother me).  A plate of latkes was originally brought out to us. But was taken away and given to a table behind us. Although we did not touch the food, I would not want to be given a plate of food that was previous dropped off at another party.  This place is a no frills, non hipster restaurant.

Bring cash as they do not accept credit cards or the machine was broken. It will not bankrupt you; expect your meal to go for $15-$20 a person, the dishes come out really quick for being made to order. Outside it looks like an old house, tucked in between two businesses. Inside it looks like a time-warp from the 1970's and in your spare time just look at some of the very unique cultural items that we eastern Europeans will recall from our childhoods. We split a serving of kraut and mushroom pierogi, I had mushroom soup and a golabki (meat stuffed cabbage with a tomato sauce and a side of cubed potatoes). All were very authentic and good tasting. Maybe a little less on the cubed potatoes but I was full by the time I was ready to nibble on those.

We tried so many different foods that I don't even remember everything that we had - but I can tell you it was all very good. Now to the reason we tried so many things: the man behind the counter. He was deceptively nice and recommended that we try a multitude of menu items. In fact, we basically let him order for us. By the end of our meal, we racked up a bill of $60 and had extra food we had to take home. After eating here, we felt that we were tricked into ordering excess food just to rack up a large bill. But I quickly dismissed that thought, and since the food was great, I decided to go again. The man behind the counter probably didn't recognize me, and to my surprise, he pulled the exact same spiel again!  Because of this repeated experience, and because another one of my friends reported the exact same occurrence, it seems that the owner here doesn't care about the needs or wants of the customer, but only about his paycheck.

2015-06-12,3.0,"Podhalanka, what an interesting name--I still am unsure how exactly to pronounce it.  I'm from Minnesota and my girlfriend and I came here one evening after doing the tourist thing all day in the city so we were hungry and looking forward to try new, local things.  I come from a Chinese family so legit Polish food is foreign and exotic to me.  I know Chicago is home to a large Polish population so I knew it had to be good but at the same time, I was unsure what to expect. We got to Podhalanka probably around 6:30 or about an hour and a half before they closed so late, but not too late or so I thought.  There was only one other table of four guests in the entire place and nobody behind the counter.  After standing around for a little bit  saw an older lady look around the corner from the kitchen door and go away.  I looked at my girlfriend and we shrugged our shoulders and just sat down at a table. After about 5 minutes, another older lady walks up to us, menus and water in hand.  We look over the menu and wanting to try as much as possible, I decide on the beef stew with cucumber salad and white borscht soup.  My girlfriend who is Polish-German, ordered the stuffed cabbage.  5 minutes later, the waitress took our order.  They only had pork stew that day so I switched, no biggie.  The waitress concluded by telling us in Polish-accented English that ""payment is only by cash"" to which I nodded. In contrast to our earlier slow and distant treatment, the retirement-age waitress quickly brought out plates, a basket of bread, my soup, and my salad.  The bread was interesting, a thin cut white bread.  I'd be surprised if they didn't bake it themselves.  Having only had red borscht soup in the past, the white borscht soup was completely different but very good.  Savory with thin slices of a dense white sausage topped with finely chopped dill herbs.  The cucumber salad seemed very fresh, like they had just taken the cucumber out of the refrigerator and sliced it right then.  I wish the white dill type dressing had a little bit sharper flavor as the cucumber was watery and diluted the dressing.  My girlfriend commented the cucumber salad was exactly how her mom would make it except it was slightly less tangy.  She also liked the soup. As we had finished our starters, our main courses arrived.  My pork stew was served in a hearty portion.  Tender hunks of meat in a savory gravy with potatoes whose flaky texture showed that the potatoes were genuinely hand smashed and mashed the oldschool way--definitely not instant potatoes.  My girlfriend's order of stuffed cabbage also hit the spot.  She said it was just like how her mom would make it. While we were in the restaurant, an elderly man came in speaking Polish.  It was clear by his interaction with the staff that he was an old regular.  He sat at the counter and had a cup of coffee.  Later a middle aged woman came in a bought a bag of food to go.  She was also recognized and greeted by name.  We were in the restaurant for about an hour and a half and besides the one other table, these were the only customers there the whole time. After we had finished eating and were ready to go, we sat around for a long time because none of the staff were anywhere to be seen.  The one other table who were already eating when we arrived looked like they were ready to go too.  I'd say we probably waited for about 20 minutes.  Finally someone at the other table walked back to the kitchen to summon the staff, we got our checks and paid.  I left quite full with a small box of leftovers but wishing the service was a little more attentive.  Definitely a great place for a home cooked meal but not for anyone in a hurry.  My girlfriend commented several times that it was just like how her mom or Polish grandma would make it, I took that as a good sign. I should also note that the bathroom was extremely clean and tidy.",0.9971,0.879,0.107,0.013,0.43662220644148353

2015-04-01,2.0,"Ok, so my Steve's Lunch review blew up and now I got some shit I got to get off my chest concerning Podhlanka in Chicago. Little backstory here. I was playing a gig with some homies in Chicago and we woke up pretty hungover and looking for something to grab before we bolted out of the city. We were in a weird zone, pretty fried from the previous nights Pizza Ordeal (coming soon) and wanted something fast. Problem was nothing was popping out except for the unassuming Podhlanka, which sported a faded and ominous sign outside declaring it served everything from Breakfast to Dinner. So, the story begins. First red flag: the place looks like a fucking VFW Hall inside. Second red flag: a dude posted up with a Straw-ber-ita at 9:30 a.m. Third red flag: a soccer match was playing on TV.  Of all the warning signs, I have to say a soccer match is probably the most threatening, as it's proof this guy is a euro head for sure and that this breakfast would by no means by traditional and American like we had imagined. Perhaps this was a misstep on our end. No shots fired at Polish food, I have been to Poland and love their food and people.  We are greeted by a server who is ultra-stoked to see a crew four deep rolling in first thing in the morning. You'll soon learn why. He asked excitedly ""have you ever had Polish before?!"" and ""who told you about this place?!"" We were too hungover to really play ball, but we should have really stopped him when he said ""let me take care of this, I will give you THE BEST traditional Polish breakfast you will ever eat."" Sure, whatever man, do your thing. He gives us some coffee and water and then ecstatically runs back to the kitchen where I think his Mom was doing the cooking. He also gives us some strange juice which he wouldn't disclose the contents of, but to be honest was pretty refreshing. About five minutes pass and he comes out with THE MOST INSANE SOUP OF ALL TIME. Two different kinds! What's a real mindfuck is that he CHOSE which of us had to eat which soup! Is he a mindreader? What if one of us was a vegetarian?? Anyhow, he assigned me and one other guy the ""white soup"", which seemed to be cheddar liquid boiled down with cauliflower and other vegetables you'd never eat first thing in the morning. The other two guys got a weird ""orange soup"" which had meatballs, cabbage and some other stuff (one orange soup casualty excavated a strange bone that was shaped like a tooth). He threw down a plate of bread as well. We were bummed to say the least, no disrespect to Polish cuisine, but this was NOT breakfast.  About ten minutes pass and my stomach is like ""holy shit man, what are you doing?"", and I get some water down and try and lock in for whatever is happening next.  He comes back with the motherlode.  4 large sausages, enough assorted pierogies to feed the Seattle Seahawks, a strange dessert dish (that he insisted we eat first?!), two weird boiled orange things that looked like Krang from Ninja Turtles, Potato Pancakes, shit what else? Whatever, this was NOT breakfast! This was a mid-January World War II era dinner fit for a family of 6-8 people! The pierogies were straight up, a game of Russian Roulette. Some had cream cheese, some had potatoes, some had this crude, sour beef. You could only get an idea by poking at it. I didn't even try the Krang-loaf. The potato pancakes were ok, I guess. He kept brandishing this wild mystery sauce that he hosed everything with. Couldn't really taste it, but it was like when your Mom busts a ration of ketchup for your cut up hot dog when you're a kid. Bizarre.  Which brings me to this fact: the dude had completely hoodwinked us into the whole thing! The whole crew was blindsided by a guy who failed on the promise of breakfast. We should have seen it coming.  So, with a 6 hour drive back to Cleveland ahead of us and about 20+ lbs of Polish dinner in our respective stomachs, we receive the bill which was $85.00.  E-I-G-H-T-Y  F-I-V-E  D-O-L-L-A-R-S. For breakfast. Four guys.  For a polish dinner. AT 9:30 in the morning. He even said ""cash only"" !!! AND THEN He walked away counting the money! Like, cartoon style!  Fully unbelievable.  Other reviews say the same thing. It's not a question of the food. I'm sure it's a good traditional Polish zone. I reiterate, not hating on Polish food, but Podhlanka operates on a rope-a-dope model of getting you in and then putting the screws to you HARD with a steep bill and an INSANE amount of food. Seriously, the soup ALONE would have been enough!  This guy would make a hell of a politician, and I don't know how he ended up running a Polish restaurant. He also had a Steven Segal low-tier henchmen vibe, and with the VFW Hall vibe of his zone, I could definitely see someone tied to a chair taking an ass-beating in there - real talk. Seems like he owes a lot of people money. He sure knows how to get it though.

Upon entry, the place had a diner like feel with several regulars eating at the counter.  We were warmly greeted and began to peruse the menu.  The owner (I assume) then came up and asked if we had any questions.  We responded that we were familiar with the menu items, but were still undecided.  He then suggested that he could prepare a sampling of the some of the menu items.  My wife and I like to have variety of little things so we agreed.  Little did I know what we were in for.  The meal started unassumingly with a couple bowls of soup which we shared amongst ourselves including our 8 year old.  Then slowly in waves plates, of food arrived.  We were probably served 9 or 10 dishes and everything was seemingly a full sized portion.  As I stated earlier, all the food was excellent, but it was WAY too much.  By the end, I could only take a bite of each new plate. So, I will take some blame for not fully inquiring, but I thought that this was some special family feast that was not listed on the menu.  Well, shame on me, we were charged for each and every individual plate.  We probably racked up a near $100 check without any alcohol.  This was very disappointing to me.  Overall, there is great value in the quantity and quality of food, but we had enough to feed 5 or 6 adults.  Furthermore, we were in a hotel with a mini fridge so although we politely packed everything up, much of it went to waste since we could store it properly.",0.9719,0.821,0.119,0.06,0.4320936882047994

Upon entering, you feel like you've stepped into the driver's seat of a Delorean and transported yourself to the old country in 1975, which I'd guess was the last time the interior was updated. Luckily there's a TV playing Wheel of Fortune, so you don't have to worry about DVRing tonight's episode! Don't be deterred by the kitschy atmosphere, it merely enhances the experience of being served Polish home cooking.  My date and I were both pretty unfamiliar with Polish food, so we ordered white borscht and beef and potato & cheese pierogis and planned to review the menu further. We did ask the server (who also happened to be the owner and an adorable Polish grandmother) for her recommendations, but she didn't have many, which surprises me, having read other reviews. The food was very tasty and seemed authentic. We never got the chance to order something else because we apparently lingered too late.  Tips:  -Ration your water consumption because you're probably not getting a refill. This place is authentically European, so you definitely won't get ice (great for those with sensitive teeth!) -Don't stay too close to closing time, because just when you feel you're ready to order something more hearty, you may be shooed out with the presentation of your bill.

I don't think it has been remodeled since the 1970's, but that just adds to the great experience. The food is truly authentic Polish food from top to bottom. They usually have 4-5 fresh soups daily with my favorite being the cabbage or white borscht with sausage. While I have had over 2/3 of the things on the menu but the stuffed cabbage, meat pierogies and potato pancakes are my usual orders. The waiter (I think it's Greg) is very upbeat and urges you to try EVERYTHING. Before you can sit down, you might have a bowl of soup in front of you. I don't mind it too much, because I always tell him to give me a few minutes to look at the menu and order a soft drink to slow him down. If I decided to open up a Used Car Lot, he would be my first call to be the Sales Manager... Sell, Sell, Sell. But this just adds to the charm of the place.

The pierogi were good, even excellent in the case of the meat version, hot and dripping with butter.  I think only Andrzej's version tops them.

Perfect for a rainy, blustery day.  Cheese blintzes - these were my favorite. Perfectly browned and crunchy on the outside with fluffy rich cheese inside. Paired with applesauce these may be what I crave in the future.  Potato pancakes - I've made these myself many times but never achieved the browned outside flavor & perfect pop of potato & onion flavor as these. Also paired with applesauce as well as sour cream.

Homemade Polish sausages - despite my Polish heritage I've never been a fan but these were something special. Lean (is that possible?) and flavorful. Paired well with the homemade pickled beets.  Stuffed cabbage roll - this was absolutely a show-stopper. I've NEVER had cabbage rolls this good before. The tomato sauce was the right balance of tomato, sweetness, and richness which is hard to find.

We stood for a few minutes waiting to be seated and the lady who runs it sort of waved her hands at us which should have alerted us and so even as we stood there the folks behind us rushed forward and grabbed the last few bar stools! :/ Anyway we found two seats and it took the lady and her husband who are also server cum owners to get to us. But we didn't mind! A huge group of polish people seated behind us broke into songs and music and it lasted till the end of our meal with everyone clapping and cheering and dancing in that little space! It was fun to watch and not one bit disturbing!  Food: The pierogies were superb! And so many! I could barely finish my plate. You know what will go really well with those piergosi? Some Sriracha! As opposed to the sour cream! I bet they would throw me out if I did that in there but I had them for leftovers with Sriracha and it was ozum!!  The dinner special comes with salad and soup and you get to pick the soup.

He got us what I assume is the polish food 101 starter kit. It involved sour cabbage soup, pierogies, blintzes, potato pancakes, and stuffed cabbage. It was definitely too much food for two people but I was ok with leftovers. My main gripe is they didn't really let us pick the flavor of pierogi, and as a result we got mostly meat ones or cheese ones. I would have liked less of those and more potato/vegetable based ones. Maybe next time I'll try to specify what flavor I want and hope I don't get murdered. I certainly wouldn't mind coming back here as everything was really good, but maybe next time I'll have the guts to tell them what I really want.

Mixed salads next: beet with horseradish, vinegary cole slaw and cukes in sour cream. All fresh and ice cold. Dinner arrived.. A crispy pork schnitzel for the Mister, and my roast pork loin. Odd, a roast pork isn't shaped like a stop sign... So why do my pork slices look like octagons? One taste of the tender, gravy napped meat revealed freezer flavor. Not freshly roasted and sliced.

My friend said the food was good so I convinced a coworker to go with me.  We go and sit at the bar. Funny grandmas kitchen looking place. Love that. Guy at the bar says ""oh we only have 3 soups today. Beef barley, cabbage, and borsht"". Okay. I can live with that. I order the beef barley and my friend looked over the menu still. He had already brought my soup over and I was taking my first bite when she ordered the same thing. I told her I wished she hadn't done that because I immediately knew the soup was awful. I am a chef and I could tell you the soup was literally water, cornstarch, barely, 1 chunk of carrot, a huge chunk of potato, and 3 slivers of beef in a giant bowl. Totally flavorless, totally saltless. Come on, at least use chicken stock for the broth.  My coworker gets her soup and she pushs the plate aside and said ""Im not eating that"". So the soup was cheap at least  and I wanted to save the experience for making her come with me. So I order the potato pancakes to share with her. The guys says ""How hungry are you ladies"". Us "" Why watcha got?"" Him. ""Oh I'll put together a nice sampler for you "". US. "" ok"". I'm thinking Im gonna get a dinner plate with 1 of everything. How nice of his guy.  We waited 45 minutes for anything to come out and finally the potato pancakes and stuffed cabbage comes out. Stuffed cabbage- again with the water based sauce. No flavor. Potato pancakes were good.

And the prices are fantastic. We ordered cabbage soup (They serve the cabbage finely chopped, I've never had it that way before, but it was good) one order of pierogies, one order of Potato pancakes and one order Gwumpkies (Stuffed cabbage) and I swear to you, there was enough food for six people to eat and eat well. We also had two cokes. The price came to under $45.00 The Potato pancakes are about an inch thick and not fried to death, they were done just right, and I'm very picky about this sort of thing, they weren't dry and served as gigantic French fries.  I grew up eating a somewhat thinner version, but still good.  The sour cream is served on the side, as is the apple sauce. I goofed up and ordered meat pierogies, they were good, in fact they were excellent, but I should have ordered cheese...next time maybe.  The cook...who is also the waitress and the owner...makes her stuffed cabbage with pork meat, first time I had that, we prepared it back home with hamburger meat.....but their pork version is good.

Everything from the juice to the blintzes are all items you will be charged for.

Not too sure the reason for this approach, but instead of selling the menu, possibly offer the kindess of seeing if anyone has any questions.  I'll be back for the golombki, perogies, fresh soup (I had pickle and it was incredible), and Polish home environment.

We arrived around 630pm on a Wednesday and poked our heads into the restaurant... It was deserted. 1 person eating a lonely bowl of cabbage soup. So, we decided to try a wine bar down the street and wait for the dinner crowd to arrive at Podhalanka. Around 8pm, we headed back over, walked in, and wow, same thing... nobody there. Then the old woman watching TV behind the bar asks, ""what do you need?"" Uhh, how about dinner? ""Oh God, no"", she replies, ""we close at 8, and have already cleaned all our pots.""  Whhaaaat??? Their sign clearly says they serve dinner, but apparently that means dinner on Polish time. (On a side note, I have to question whether this place is a front for the Polish mafia, seeing as they don't have any business and close at 8...hmmm) Please take the ""dinner"" sign off your window, Podhalanka...

It's not a Polish buffet.  We were greeted by a wonderfully friendly older woman who sat us down and made us feel like we were in the kitchen at her home.  Immediately brought us some fresh rye bread and butter and told us about the soups of the day.  Split pea or cabbage.  I love split pea and Podhlanka didn't disappoint.  I quickly glanced at the menu containing various Polish classic dishes and asked for a recommendation.  A couple of us got the pork cutlet, roast pork and well, we got crazy.  Before we knew it we had pierogies, blintzes, sausage, perfectly done potato pancakes and just a whole bunch of great food.  (When I went home and told the girls about how much I likes the blintzes I had to promise to bring some home next time)  I had a flash back to the many Christmas Eves our family spent at my Aunt Helens home when I was a kid.  Everything was authentic, delicious comfort food.

But even if I never come up with ""alanka,"" I think that about covers it.  I have been to this place twice, almost two years apart, and have never experienced a hard sell like I did here the entire 11 years I lived in Chicago.  It was the same guy both times.  When he's not busy ignoring the customer back near the kitchen, he's busy trying to upsell you on some other like a mediocre soup or a small (but expensive) salad.  And this douche makes it seem like it comes with the meal.  It never does. And he knows he's doing it.  The second time I was here, I left about the time he was explaining to some hipsters who had roamed in that, ""[he] never forces anyone to buy anything and [he] never says that it's free,"" while they were arguing the bill with him. If the food was worth it, it might be a cute quirk.  There is a certain appeal to the old postcards lining the walls and the grandparently staff.  However, as it stands, for me, I've had some slightly far below average blintzes (when it takes the powdered sugar to make it taste like anything, that's a sad reflection on the cook) and some acceptably rich (at least this far down Milwaukee) pierogis.  But on their food output, this place would not survive a minute north of Diversey where the warmth factor of a family-type kitchen with hearty food is the rule.   Maybe this is what Polish diners are like in the homeland.  But if that's the case, it's sad that this Pole on Pole deception takes place.  Personally, if I want to be pushed around and taken advantage of, I'll leave that up to a German restaurant!",0.8852,0.822,0.109,0.069,0.5434944684944685

I wanted to check out Wicker Park when visiting Chicago with my Dad, and hearing about the adjacent neighborhood's Polish roots, I thought it would be fun to get some Polish food - a non-existent dining option in my Atlanta home.  Yelp led me to Podhalanka, conveniently located right above the Division stop on the Blue Line CTA.  The place is kind of odd, honestly.  It looks very old from the outside, with no pretense of trying to be trendy or updating anything in the past forty years.  Inside feels like a church hall.  The tables are the long folding kind you'd put up at a party, covered with plastic table clothes and topped with old vinyl placemats.  The walls are graced with all manner of oddities, but in a completely UNhip, UNironic way:  a poster commemorating Princess Diana; a Pope John Paul II decorative plate; a decoupaged photograph of a horse mounted on wood backing.  I enjoyed the rotating display of Polish greeting cards, complete with a variety of Chicago postcards that have collecting dust since the 80's.  Finally, if you bring a young one, in the corner is a kind of dirty looking high chair that looks like it was bought at a yard sale. Ordering was a challenge, because it was pretty early - about 10:00 AM.  I wasn't sure if they only had breakfast.  We were handed menus that had breakfast and dinner on them, but the, er, hostess just said ""We have pierogi, blintzes, sausage.""  She said that twice, as if to say that was all they had.  A man came to take our order though and very helpfully sort of ordered for us.  ""For you, I think you should start with two bowls of cabbage soup, mixed pierogi, potato pancakes, blintzes, and stuffed cabbage.  And I'll bring you some homemade juice, sound good?""  Dad and I just said ""sure.""  He made it easy for us.  I assumed it would be some sort of combo plate sampler, however he brought out full portions of each item.  He good-natured manner about it was a little annoying since he was really selling us everything in the kitchen.  The bill was $44.00.  However, I didn't ask and I didn't really mind, so I don't hold that against him. The food was just really amazing polish food.  I loved the soup a LOT.  Pierogi's were delicious (boiled, not fried).  I am not a blintz fan, but these were the BEST EVER!  The blintzes were probably my favorite dish.  A typical sweet cheese filling, bot not too rich, rolled like an enchillada in a crepe and pan fried.  SO good!!!  I thought the potato pancakes were bland.  No idea what the homemade juice was, but it was tasty enough.  Tasted sort of like snapple iced tea and grape juice.

Spent a late morning walking from Bucktown, down to Wicker Park, to Noble Square just west of West Town....couldn't allow myself not to commemorate the Polish heritage and establishment in Chicago history here without attempting to locate a Polish place to plop down and have some lunch. So do truly hate to say it, but this place could be *any* ol off-the-street restauracja in ol' Slavic Europe...for a person who has never had any of the fare from this sector of the former Bloc countries, I'd say take the cultural experience! Located next to some Chopin place, and just a tad east of busy Ashland, this diner-like place is nondescript (as are MANY of the local places in this part of the world). I stepped into Polish news blaring from a small television.... Order from a menu printed up decades and decades ago...here's the thing about Slavic food..it is heavy. Whether boiled or fried, it is heavy, so either be quite hungry, or be prepared not to finish all of your food.  Ordered navy bean soup and some pierogis that came combo (cottage cheese, sauerkraut, potato, and minced chicken fillings). Thing is they didn't taste exactly that fresh.... freshly boiled, yes, but the filling of the meat itself.... made me suspect. So Polish dumplings can be comparable to Czech knedliky (the stuffed kind, not the bready kind), and fall on the opposite side of the spectrum from Asian dumplings. Their skin is quite thick, made with lots of flour, and are dipped with sour cream or some type of shredded beets or sometimes more sauerkraut. And I was sad that, just as in Europe, there are absolutely no sides at all. ~$8 for a plate of 8 pierogis, and absolutely no sides at all with it. Could handle it.... Was very ambivalent about the quality and the outcome of this lunch. $14 with tip! Patron beware. Met 2 kind and informative locals who dine there frequently, and who told me such titillating trivia about Chicago such as the fact Division was named as such because it divided Goose Is., or that State and Madison are 0/0 and 8 blocks comprise a mile in town. Or that the Indians who used to occupy this erstwhile swampland upon which Chi-town was built used to build their huts and hunt along the now diagonal street that plop back onto the gridded system of the city.  Wish I had walked further west on Division to view that great Louis Sullivan Russian Orthodox church that has all of the concentric architecture. darn!",0.9483,0.861,0.083,0.056,0.45720899470899484

Then she waved the menus at us and told us to pick them up from her at the counter. I already thought that was rude, but hey, this was my first polish restaurant experience so I gave her the benefit of the doubt.  She took our order and then came by with plates and water. As time progressed, our dishes came out one by one.  She placed our appetizer on the counter and told us to come up and get it. Again, we thought this to be poor service, but we gave her the benefit of the doubt and thought that since she was an old lady she couldn't walk that far to us (we were about 3 steps from the counter and maybe 10 steps from the kitchen area).  She came with my entree and served it straight to our table. SHOCKER! She can walk after all!!!! When my cousin's entree was ready, she placed his food on the counter and told us to come up and get it. By this time we knew for sure she wasn't crippled, she was just lazy or hated us. When we were almost done with dinner, an elderly couple had walked into the restaurant and sat at a table directly behind us. The lady was SO attentive and sweet to them. She handed them their menus directly. Gave them a HUGE stack of complimentary bread and butter (we only got 3 slices of bread), and served all their food directly to them. This couple were not friends or family of this lady. When it came time to pay the bill, the lady calculated it on the register and screamed out for the entire restaurant to hear that I owed $30 for our meal. Totally rude. She didn't even bring me the bill. She made me walk up to the counter to view the bill. When I gave her a credit card she gave me a dirty look.  Of course she didn't bring me the receipt to sign but made me come up to the counter to sign it. I personally thought she was rude to me and my cousin because: 1) we looked young 2) we're chinese and she stereotyped us as being cheap tippers 3) she's a racist I would have tipped her 20% if she wasn't so damn rude to us. I honestly don't think she even deserved the 15% tip I gave since we had to carry our own food to our table and serve ourselves.  But I didnt want her to think we were cheap tippers.

And beef roll - a meat that was rolled up with some veggies which was okay nothing to write home to mama. But now for the pierogi!  Oh goodness these are wonderful miniature delights!  Looks like old fashion dumplings but the fillings are incredible!  Hands down the cheese and patato pierogi was the best!  Had a Philadelphia cheese taste with a bit of potatoes that was just rich and savory.  Definitely the best dish.  We also had the meat pierogi which has the texture of shredded beef like chipotle's barbacoa beef.  It was interesting and quite delicious but nothing compared to... the NONMEAT potatoes and cheese pierogi which makes absolutely no sense to a carnivore like me.  But delicious.  Which you dip into sour cream by the way. The potato pancake was crispy and light, came with sour cream and apple sauce to compliment it.  Good stuff.

Podhalanka is NOT a swanky place, so if you're looking for fancy decor and table settings, this will not be the place for you.  In fact, it's an old bar that was converted into a casual dining restaurant -- it's long and narrow, and the original bar is still there and you can eat there if you like, like the old fashioned lunch counters you see only rarely these days.  It's not open very late, so if you're heading over for dinner go early.  Don't be surprised if the television behind the bar is on. This joint is very popular with cops and folks who live and work in the 'hood -- always a good sign that the food is good and reasonably priced.  From the moment I entered, I knew I was in for great Polish food -- the owner/waitress and chef are native-born Poles.  The owner, from what I understand, only moved to the States when she was in her mid to late 20's! Everything I've had there is excellent -- the potato pancakes, the pierogis (among the very best I've ever had), and the white borscht are my favorites.  My heritage is not Polish (German/Irish mostly, with a lot of other stuff thrown in for good measure), but I still savor the food here as if my grandma made it or something.  There's something comforting and comfortable about it. Service is good, but again, the owner/server is not a native English speaker so be patient.  I've only had one bad experience with the service, and that was when I had to send back my silverware because it wasn't thoroughly clean, but that can happen anywhere.  She promptly and gladly exchanged the silverware for me with no attitude about it. If you'd like wine or beer with your pierogi, bring your own.   Don't expect fancy wine glasses, though - if you're a wine lover and have to have that special wine glass to let it breathe properly, suggest you bring your own or deal with the regular 'ol kitchen-style glasses they have here. The price?  OMG it's such a deal.  This is a working person's restaurant -- the prices are great!  You get a good amount of food for what you pay here.  Of course, now that they've been featured in the Smithsonian Magazine, they'll probably get uber-popular and the prices will go up, and it will lose its down-home, city neighborhood feel.  Let's hope not! They can accomodate larger groups, but call in advance so they can have the tables set up for you -- it's a small restaurant.   My only regret is that I don't live anywhere near here so it's a hassle to go to this place -- I would definitely eat here more often if it was closer to my home.",0.9939,0.828,0.135,0.038,0.5768488178488179

I have been trying to get out to one of the local Polish restaurants for some time, so we found Podhalanka on yelp.  The interior of the restaurant is not going most (or any) but you immediately feel comfortable: a long bar lined with stools to the right, a single row of tables with four chair each to the left. Vinyl table clothes and place mats on the table. I had no concerns about the 8 and 9 year old boys spilling anything :-) You can relax in a place like this so enjoy it.  The menu isn't very large and a quarter is dedicated to breakfast (served until noon). My brother and I were interested in some classics from our childhood, pierogis, stuffed cabbage and potato pancakes. The soup also sounded very appealing considering we walked in from a rainy, windy, grey 45 degree day.  I ordered the mushroom barley, Jim the tomato and Lisa had the vegetable. We each thought that our soup was incredible maybe the best we have had in our lives. DO NOT SKIP THE SOUP - it is that good.  We then had the stuffed cabbage and it too was amazing. The kids ate the cabbage and filling without picking it apart. The potato pancakes came out at about the same time. They were very good but seemed like a let down because of the how good everything else was.  The pierogis arrived last and did not disappoint. I know I never had a pierogi like this before: light, delicate and delicious. They were awesome and should not be missed.

Well, the trouble with this place is, the window out front is too dirty and cluttered to look through. But I took my chances and went inside anyway. Five stars.  Good, reliable Polish food, good service.  Expect the Polish basics like sausage, pork, cabbage, and pierogi, all of which are inarguably bland in comparison to southern cuisines.   But, to get the most out of your meal you really have to try what I consider to be the highlight of Polish cuisine and a staple at every Polish main meal, the soups (""zupy""), which are very far from being bland.  They have eight soups on the menu, and though on any given day they'll only have a few ready, they all seem to be good.  The zurek (white rye soup with sausage) is excellent, as is the mushroom soup (like a typical chicken-noodle soup-type broth with dill).  I'm holding out for a day when they have ogorek.

Bottom line: spartan place with incredible home cooking and generous portions. I have to go back and try the potato pancakes Yelpers have been raving about. As for being bland, cuisines are not as spicy as you go further away from the equator.

The downside, as you might expect, is that most of the offerings taste like food one can have at home.  It's not terribly in keeping with my taste in particular, but for those who grew up in an eastern European household, it might be pleasantly evocative.  One surprise to naive me was that the pork shank I ordered was not roasted, as other restaurants had accustomed me to expect--here pork is boiled and served with horseradish.  In hindsight, remarkably bland meat served with a piquant garnish like that makes perfect sense in a restaurant like this, and also makes sense in the culture it originated from.  Potato pancakes were about as flavorful as your average potato pancake, and the same can be said about the stuffed cabbage. There might well be some hidden tasty treasures on the menu, but make no mistake--the restaurant as a whole will likely leave a much stronger impression on you than the food itself will.",0.9879,0.789,0.161,0.05,0.5360090702947845
