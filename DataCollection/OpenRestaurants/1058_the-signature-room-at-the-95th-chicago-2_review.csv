In any other place with these prices you expect: michelin star quality presentation and service. None of that happened.

The wine was never presented with  the bottle, so i never knew what I was drinking, the waiters in the end were taking off their. Gowns and making themselves at home. And the food's presentation has never moved from the 1980s. What you're really paying for are the views. That's it. The whole restaurant needs a complete revamp.

Well the staff (including the manager) made the night very UNamazing. First, my husband had made reservations to be seated in the main dining room, and had asked for rose pedals and a rose on the table. We arrived and had to wait for our table even though we had reservations. Finally when they seated us, they put us in a side room which looked like it should have been a part of the kitchen. The table had a rose, but no rose pedals. My husband spoke to their manager and explained that the rose pedals were missing and we requested a table in the main room which we didn't get, and instead of being apologetic, the manager had a million excuses as to why he couldn't accommodate the request. He finally agreed to move us to a table in the main dining room, and offered us free dessert to make up for the inconvenience. When dessert time came along, our waiter had brought over a small cake for my birthday which my husband had preordered. We assumed this was going to be comped since the manager said dessert was on them. When the bill came, we noticed they charged us for the cake, so we asked the manager about it and he said he didn't realize we preordered the cake, and he meant he would comp us if we ordered from the dessert menu.

The hostess was extremely pleasant (as was all of the wait staff), and was kind enough to give us a window seat. As I mentioned the view was spectacular, but unfortunately it was pretty downhill from there. So, you evidently can only order everything at once. My thought was to order a cocktail, have some bread and appetizer then order a bottle of wine and dinner after. I'm not sure if it's to help with their service flow or if they've just been burned with folks sitting in the restaurant and ordering bread and a drink and occupying dining real estate. I tend to think it's the later based on how the server was explaining it, but that certainly didn't make it or break it for me. We ordered the shrimp appetizer. The shrimp was well cooked, but the goat cheese grits it was on was pretty bland as was the sauce that accompanied the shrimp dish. My wife ordered the filet and I ordered the ribeye which was the special for the evening. The fillet was okay, but they didn't bring out the garlic butter that was supposed to come with it, and the ribeye was extremely underwhelming. It had the texture and taste of a low grade piece of meat and could only manage to eat about an 1/8 of it. The server didn't inquire about it even after we told him we didn't want to box it, so I just left it at that. We then ordered creme brûlée and my wife ordered a coffee and baileys to go with it. The coffee came out, no baileys... creme brûlée was a very thick texture, more like flan than creme brûlée.

We definitely ate like queens! We had steak and eggs, lamb chop, benedicts, braised short ribs, and so much more. AND, their mimosa is the best I have ever had!!! Their orange juice is so fresh!

Unfortunately I did not watch my watch so I can only guess it was between 45 minutes or more. The waiter only stopped by once to say the food would be out in just a few minutes.  My steak in the steak salad was incredibly tough even though it was cooked to medium rare. My husband did like his burger. My mother-in-law said her lamb was tough and too fatty. She eats lamb all the time and is aware lamb has some fat. But lamb chops shouldn't be very fatty. We've been to the signature room many times over the years. It appears the quality of the food has once again declined. I look forward to visiting again when it has improved.,0.1566,0.899,0.049,0.052,0.6526190476190477

Our waiter didn't explain that everything was unlimited even the entrées on the menu so my fiancé was hesitant about ordering more than one. It would have been nice to have our waiter explain everything or confirm the process. When I asked him he seemed very inconvenienced that I asked about the unlimited entrees and that I wanted another one. Around 1230 the crowd started clearing out. The food stations are the best. I had the banana nut french toast with turkey sausages it was ok. The sausages were good. I also had the lamb chops which were ok. My fiancé had the eggs benedict which he enjoyed and an omelet from the omelet station. We will definitely return another Sunday for brunch and hopefully we get a better waiter.

After we were tabled, it had been 10 minutes that no servers taking take of our table. Every time I had to call the waiters randomly and they had no idea that who was our server. I felt very disappointed and like being ignored and disrespected. We had been waiting for 40 minutes and our entrees were still not ready, since my parking was expired in 10minutes, I called the manager Caharles Charles, explained this situation including my disappointments for the service and told him we might have to leave since the entrees were not ready. Caharles Charles didn't let we leave and he asked to wait for the solutions even I told him I didn't want to take the entrée and had to leave. After 10 minutes, I felt we had to leave and at this time, manager Arif Dortkardesler and Caharles Charles came back with our three entrées. He didn't uncover the entrees, just showed me that they finished, forcing me stop and pay for the entrees. Caharles Charles said that he felt sad that I didn't have enough money to pay for the parking. I was not sure if he thought I didn't dress fancy and might have no money to pay for the bill. I felt very annoyed and while I didn't take the entrée and notify them in advance, as well as that I didn't trust the quality of the food finished in such a hurry. I refused to pay for his rudeness. At this moment, the two managers forced me to pay and threatened me that if I didn't pay for it, they was going to call the police and arrested me. Caharles Charles was even ready to call the phone. I was not afraid that if they were going to call the police since I didn't make anything wrong. Considering that the two other ladies were leaving Chicago tomorrow, I didn't want to make them feel scared and unhappy with the City, I chose compromise at that moment and pay for the Bill with my credit card. But I refused to pay the tips.  We took out the three entrees and found somewhere else to eat. What I assumed before came true, that they didn't cook the food well in such a hurry and only finished it forcing me to pay. The food was terrible! The Pan Seared Duck Breast was even raw with bleeding! The two other plates, Seafood Risotto and Fusili Pasta was not it should be like an edible food. The two other ladies felt uncomfortable with the food and discarded them after having a bite.  I ask to give me money back not only for the discriminations and threatening, but also for the poor qualitied of food they gave us. It was the first time that I had been discriminated and threatened. I am not sure if I was an Asian with not that Fancy clothes. It seems like the Signature Room thought they were very famous and not respects customers.

My first time was about a year ago, my second visit was last night 5-28-17.   PROS- scallops are excellent, the lobster bisque soup is to die for it's just too bad you only get 2 small pieces of lobster. The mixed drinks are always excellent, waiters are knowledgeable and always willing to take your scenic picture. View is spectacular if your lucky enough to get a window seat. CONS- The temperature is freezing in there to the point of being uncomfortable. You should be able to take your jacket off at dinner time...I didn't get too. Let's talk about the elevator experience coming up and going down, you are completely slammed up against every person around you. Not only are you being breathed on/stepped on, but let's hope no one has a case of head lice... That's how slammed you are. They seriously need to come up with a better system, good luck if you're claustrophobic. Another thing that was brought to my attention is that you cannot reserve a window seat... The wait for that was 1.5 hours past your reservation time. Instead we got stuck in some back corner by the bathrooms where my view was some kind of partisan hiding the kitchen and a big ugly yellow wall! My husband was kind enough to trade me sides so I could at least stare at the people with window seats.   I just feel that if your going to pay $200 for a dinner, every view in the house should be great. For that price the Signature Room needs to step it up a bit.

So far we have had some phenominal waiters. Today we got Ron. He was soo nice despite being swamped with guests.  For the food though, i always get the lamb chops! They are the best for me. And just like the flat iron steak, mention how you would like your meat done. The short ribs weren't phenomenal and unless super soft fall apart meat is your thing, it was just ok for me. The chefs choice fish is our favorite part. We have never had fish we did not enjoy. Todays was ruby trout. Just enough seasoning not to mask the knowledge of fish as your entreé. But please save room for dessert, in me and my wifes opinion, their cheesecake is better than most out there. And i couldnt get enough of the chocolate fudge like squares sprinkled with gold, yes, gold... hmmmmm. And now i bet you are wondering, did we really eat that much in one go?

It was unbelievably bland, I couldn't believe it. My husband got the filet mignon, which was super expensive but tasted like nothingness. It was literally meat without flavor. I ordered the Fusili Pasta and I asked them to add chicken to it. It turned out to be tasteless, all I was able to taste was literally the heavy cream. My husband got the Grilled Petite Beef Mignon. The menu claims that it has ""sautèed lobster mushrooms, cabrales blue cheese butter, and shiitake reduction""... All it ended up being was a slab of meat with the shiitake reduction black sauce around it, and literally nothing else. I added a picture for whoever wanted to see. What a waste... that's all I can say.  As for the dessert, we had the white and dark chocolate mousse cake, and it was a let down as well. They claimed it was their 'best cake', but it was anything but good. I'm a crazy deserts fan, but this cake? I couldn't even get myself to finish half of it.  The ONLY good thing they had was their pinã colada.... that's about it.",0.9731,0.85,0.127,0.023,0.5311507936507938

The service was impeccable and when we were done with our dinner and wanted to go to back up to the 96th for an after dinner drink, they seated us at a table at the window even though others were waiting. No sides view is bad! To get a window for dinner, you must request it at check in for your reservation. They quoted us a 45 minute wait, so we went upstairs for a cocktail. It must have been 15 minutes, just enough time to order a drink, and we were paged. Between the two of us we ordered the Raw Bar for Two (delicious), Seared Sea Scallops (wonderful), a steak, Parmesan Garlic Whipped Potatoes, and Herbed Mushrooms. We were too stuffed to indulge in dessert. They require one entree per person, but they state that on their online menu, so people can't be upset about that requirement. Everything was delicious, but without the great view, it would be hard to justify the prices.

He checked on us frequently, made sure we were good with any refills needed, and overall.. it looked like he enjoyed his job. He definitely needs a raise or promotion!! He delivered A1 service tonight! Thank you Roberto for making our last dinner in Chicago memorable!  The food was delicious. I started with the lobster bisque and Caesar salad, and for my entree I ordered the surf & turf with an extra order of lobster tail. I'll say that the lobster was more chewy/drier than I would like it to be but it surely was not bad enough for me to give it a negative review. The flavor was there and it did not disappoint. The steak could've been better.. lacked flavor & was not as tender. Overall, we would rate the food as 7.5/10.

2017-04-19,3.0,"This is a truly unique place to go in Chicago. I only wish I had come here on earlier trips! The views are as breathtaking as 'at the 95th' in its name suggests. There are 2 sections: the 95th floor is a restaurant and bar, while the 96th floor is a cocktail bar and lounge with table service also. This review is for the 96th floor cocktail lounge. Pros: They have a robust drink selection. Most are a bit pricier than they would be if you were drinking them at a lower altitude, but it comes with the territory and is worth a few more bucks being there, in my opinion. Beers were in the $8 - $12 range, cocktails were between $15 - $25. There was a large wine selection, $10 a glass and $40 or so and (way) up for a bottle. I just had a Revolution IPA because let's be real, everyone comes here for the views with a side of drinks. Service was quick, the interior was very modern and chic, yet still resembled something out of 'Mad Men' the 60s. Cons: You may get the occasional tourist snapping photos of the view if you happen to be seated by on the of the floor-to-ceiling windows. Peak times may mean a long wait for a table, the wait time was short for my girlfriend and I, but the line for tables had ballooned by the time we left.  The views are what attracts everyone, I'm not sure how enticing it would be if it were a restaurant and lounge elsewhere.

The view is simply spectacular, as well as the view in the women's room (so I hear).  Food & Drinks The drinks are subpar and very expensive. I had a Manhattan that was a disaster, and the other ""fancy"" cocktails were overly sweet and quite frankly DISGUSTING. Four drinks with tip should not be $94. The first time I came with a group of 6 I shared the seafood platter which was excellent and actually quite reasonably priced. The guacamole was above average and the duck nachos were passable.  Service I managed to go here twice in three days while I was in Chicago. Both times the service was atrocious - the servers and the bartenders are apathetic and clearly rely on exclusively tourists and auto-gratuity based on large parties.

The views here from the 95th floor of the Hancock Center was one of the coolest parts during my visit to the Windy City. You'll go high into the Chicago sky. During my elevator trip up 95 stories, my ears popped twice :) It was well worth-it though. I was fortunate enough to see the skyline with an overcast and with sunlight during my visit here and both were astounding.  My friends and I got a few cocktails here and thorough enjoyed all of them. Most of cocktails run $16-$17 which is pricey but the views are well worth the price. Also consider that if you go to the Willis Tower Skydeck, you would be paying $23 for admission, wait in long lines, and be stuck in a tourist trap for a view that is very similar to the one offered here at The Signature Room. If you ask me, I'd rather be sitting down, holding a drink in my hand, and enjoying the same view for a similar price here.  The drawback is that to enjoy these views, you'd HAVE to get a seat by the window. We originally didn't get a window seat but asked the hostess if we could switch to it once another party left. Subsequently, once we left, there were multiple parties eyeing our seats and one moved there within seconds of us leaving. So essentially, the views are a moot point unless you get those coveted window seats.  Staff is very friendly and very attentive. This is a classy place so you can expect high-class service.

However, I was enchanted by the idea of doing something extra special for my husband. Intentionally got there early for a 7:00 reservation, and decided to pass the time in the Signature Lounge. The line was a bit overwhelmingly for those who didn't have a reso, but because we did, we were able to quickly bypass. Didn't get the best seat in the lounge, but was still a nice view after a short wait. There was a limited wine selection in the lounge, and the crowd was generally younger.  Once we checked back in for our dinner, we followed the hostess to what seemed to be the best seat in the house--along the window, right in the middle, on the Willis Tower side. It was a clear night, and the view was breathtaking. Made us fall in love with Chicago all over again. They had an extensive wine list, of which we chose the medium bodied, 2012 Sangiovese. Was very smooth. The app options didn't interest us too much at the time, so we went with the pomegranate winter salad and lobster bisque instead. Both were tasty. My husband and I selected steaks--he got the 14 oz New York Strip and I got the 10 oz filet of beef. The only criticism he had was that it was medium and he ordered medium rare. That being said, the bourbon sauce enhancement was pretty incredible. The garlic mashed potatoes were definitely shareable.

We let him know about our experience, he muttered an, ""I'm sorry"" and rushed back down the hallway.

I understand that heading to the bar is a better value than paying to go to the observation deck, since you do get drinks/food with the view, but I paid way too much money for a very weak drink-- as the biggest light-weight who gets tipsy over a quarter of a beer with dinner, you'd think an entire $17 cocktail would make me giggly, but nope! Nothing. Also, we were directed into a side room with a bad view and didn't realize that there were better views and tables on the other side of the floor. So we asked our waitress if we could take our drinks to the other room, and she said yes. When we got to the other side though, another server stopped us before we could even sit down and said that as soon as we sat down we would need to order another round of drinks-- we could save the table, but we couldn't sit down without ordering the second our butts touched the seats. What? I get that he would want us to order another round from him in order to get the tips, but the way he pressured us was really strange.

I made our reservations over the phone in advance, and then requested a window seat when we arrived (that's what the hostess told me to do when I made the reservation). The wait for a window seat was about 45 min, and that was with arriving at 8pm.  We went and sat at the bar in the lounge, and had a couple over priced and underwhelming cocktails. So, I would say if you're there with a budget, definitely skip any drinks other than a wine, champagne, or beer you're familiar with. The mixed drinks and martinis are blah at best.  They give you a remote buzzer to tell you when your table is ready, but they will also text you. Trust me, if you're going to the lounge, keep your phone out. For some reason the buzzers don't always work in there, and our's never went off, but my phone did.  We were seated at window seat facing toward North Avenue Beach, with Lake Shore Drive below us. As long as you get a window seat, the direction won't really matter, but the views are outstanding. Our waiter's name was Scott and he was fantastic. Great personality, honest with suggestions, and very attentive.  We had the braised beef appetizer, and for dinner I had the scallops, and my boyfriend had the filet. We both shared, and both entrees were delicious. We also ordered the butternut squash & cauliflower side, which was also really tasty.  We had a couple of drinks, which again at $17-18 each are nothing to get excited for.  Also, I know some people complain about the price of the food. I didn't find it to be any more expensive than other upscale steakhouses (Gibsons, Mortons, Ruth's Chris, etc...), and for the same price, you get a top notch service experience with an outstanding view of one of the greatest cities in the world.",0.9949,0.819,0.158,0.023,0.5849616858237547

2017-01-06,1.0,"We had a nightmare experience getting drinks December 28, offset only by the great table. Terrible service, it's sad that they capitalize on their location. Let me explain.  Wait time to get up there: 30min Wait for a table: 10min Wait for Waitress: 5min We walked up to the line at the bottom of the elevators and had a joyful time and moved through at a decent pace. We made friend with the people in front of us after noticing that their IDs (checking for +21) were from out of the states. (South Africa turns out) The line moved steadily, even as the directors, understandably, gave preference to people with reservations at the restaurant. A big bummer was that our friends got ushered into an elevator while we did not so, even at the front of the cue, we were about 10min behind them when the director filled two consecutive elevators with reservations people. [lil peeved that they weren't as packed as could have been but NBD] BATHROOM: We get to the top and our new friends had thought to put in for a table of 4! So fun! I jet to the bathroom which was the first adventure. There are easily 300 people in the place and only 1 women's bathroom with 3-4 stalls. One of them was overflowing and flooding that single bathroom. It was no bueno.  SEATING: We got a table on the frickkin edge of the world. It was amazing. Note that there are three different kinds of seats. (1) Edge of the World, up at the windows (2) tables/booth seats on the main floor (3) bar seats. So make sure you say you want an ""edge of the world"" seat. We waited like 2 extra minutes to get it but 100% worth it.  STAGE ONE: We order our first round of drinks (2 beers, 2 cocktails) and as the waitress brings them out and tells us she is leaving so I hand over my VISA, no questions. Lil tacky but we've all been in that situation so NBD. She throws back a VISA and receipt. (We think NBD she was closing her shift) It's a bill 3X the amount of ours and not my VISA. I flag her down to point this out. She asks my name as if I'm wrong and that this is indeed my VISA then she doesn't remember what we actually had, suggesting that we are lying. Eventually she just grabs both out of my hand. STAGE TWO: She drops off my VISA but with the huge bill again then tries to walk away. Again, this bill is THREE TIMES the amount of ours. I explain again my name and our order. We hear a neighboring table having the same problem and she just grabs both and switches them. I again explain that this VISA is not mine though the bill is.  STAGE THREE: She takes all of them away for the second time and comes back with with the correct VISA and correct bill. Verbatim, she says ""I had it right the first time"" and leaves. No apology. No mention of the error in delivery. No worry over the fact she had just run my card three times.  STAGE FOUR: (15min later) Friends encourage me to check my bank account. I'd been charged our bill twice and the TRIPLE bill once. As a debt ridden student enjoying vacation on a dime, this understandably caused me immediate panic. I go up to the counter and ask to talk to the manager. The person asks who my server was. I tell them. Note that she ""had to leave"" 30min before. She's still there. I ask to speak to the manager then to get this cleared. She goes to get him. I wait another 5min by the bar. He comes up and tells me theres nothing he can do. I show him that it's on my account that that I cannot even risk it going through. I won't be able to pay my hotel bill! He is completely unresponsive to my concerns and keeps repeating theres nothing he can do. I shamelessly suggest that he could buy us a round of drinks to calm the air. He responds with a carte blanche ""no way"" and instead gives us 2 coupons and just short of shoos me away. Still no apology or recognition of my concern. While I understand the limitations of such transactions, it was the complete lack of understanding towards my very legitimate concern and relatable situation that is unacceptable to me. No matter what kind of place I am at, human decency demands an apology for putting me through this stress. Indeed the additional charges cleared off my bill in three days time but the unnecessary stress was not fun.

2016-12-13,4.0,"Chicago is a beautiful city, and if you have the chance to swing by the signature room to experience the skyline view I highly recommend it. TL,DR - You're paying for the views, food isn't anything amazing, but the drinks are strong and the breakfast buffet is worth it. Call in advance for reservations or you'll find yourself waiting for a while. check their schedule because they are closed from 2-5PM. brunch for 2 : $167 - all you can eat buffet, three mimosas, roasted chicken, breakfast waffle with turkey sausage. The Signature room is great if its your first time visiting Chicago. Other places will charge you for the view (Sears tower) but you're better off coming to the signature room and killing two birds with one stone and get a meal and spectacular views. placing reservations is highly recommended because they will most likely make you wait some time before they sit you. However no reservations are required if you are just going to the bar, which is one level below the signature room.  You'll have to wait in line to ride on the elevator and because they try to pack the elevator you'll most likely be up-close and personal with a stranger. you'll hear a couple of jokes about being stuck in the elevator on the way up but its pretty quick so you'll get there in no time.  Dress code - I was advised that it is not a casual dress code and no jeans or sneakers allowed. You'll be 96 stories high and the views are breathtaking, if you happen to get a table ask for a window seat, we did not do this and while our view wasn't horrible, I would of enjoyed sitting up by the window a lot more. Food - PRICEY. My gf and I went for an early birthday brunch and we were told that there was an open buffet which offered a very large variety of food, from bagels, to sea food and omelets as well as desserts. We ordered mimosas which were decently strong. Ordered breakfast waffles, and roasted (toasted orzo pasta, carrots, pearl onions, $30). The chicken was well cooked and sweet in flavor. however the portion was very small. waffles, well...they were just waffles, served with turkey sausage. Service - they were fairly busy during brunch so we did notice that there wasn't much attention being paid over to our side of the restaurant, we frequently had to flag down a waiter for more water and additional drinks.  ill be back, for drinks mainly, or special occasions.",0.9895,0.817,0.13,0.053,0.5975396825396826

However, the drinks here are good (and some are quite strong), and the view from 96 stories above the city is spectacular. Entrance to the lounge is free, but the drinks, appetizers and/or desserts that you'll be ordering are obviously going to be pricey.  Tip: Double check the hours because it opens at 10/11 am and closes at 10/11 pm depending on the day. It's also closed from 2:30-5 pm. You'll have to go before 2:30 pm if you'd like to see the city in daylight (the sun starts to set around 4 during the winter). If you're planning on stopping by at 5 pm, get there early so you can get a good spot in line and be seated at a nice table near the windows (you'll also have to ask the host for this type of table or they'll probably seat you anywhere).

2016-10-01,1.0,"This is overdue review for my only DISAPPOINTMENT in five days in Chicago.  My friend and I ordered the same steak.  Hers was fine enough.  Our originally nearly-obsequious waiter, upon seeing the growing mound of inedible fat and grizzle on my plate, never inquired about the quality of the steak, and, instead, sent a busboy to clear the plates, again, in silence. I wish I'd taken a pic of the plate because I'm certain you cannot believe that an $82 meal (pre-gratuity) could be even-less-than-mediocre.  I'd suggest that you try any other restaurant; we we so satisfied with all others.  The view isn't worth the effort or cost or hassle to get up there to The Signature Room.  Very displeased.",0.7798,0.799,0.134,0.067,0.5003968253968253
2016-09-27,5.0,"This is beyond 5 star!!!!!!!!!        My husband was in town for a trade show tied up with work all day and most nights, At night he often had work dinner or to take customers out. He'd hosted a dinner for his biggest account here .. around 50 people and 3 hour open bar. His company understand this expense which is usually around 10 grand. This is far from typical for him or his company but it's a once a year thing for the best customers... and I sure wasn't included. The party planner for the Signature room who facilitated everything running smoothly came to check on how things were going . my husband told her he wanted to bring me there the next night . He knew I'd just love the view and to take pic's and he wasn't wrong. She suggested an early dinner so we could see the city in daylight and as it transitioned to night ... amazing.  when we arrived I asked if he'd specified a window view and he looked rather ill .. he hadn't considered it .. I was disappointed and said if we didn't have a window we might as well not stay. luckily the party planner did think of everything. I heard the couple ahead of us request a window seat and they said it's first come first serve and would be around 2 hour extra wait, so I was sure we'd not luck out. But when we told our name they took us to a gorgeous window table with the ideal view. So I guess when you spend that amount you get special perks. I'd suggest holding out of the good view ... it was sooo worth it. usually places like this .. it' s all about the view .. the food and services are average .. not here .. the food and service were all top notch. I started with a dirty martini which was great and came in a tiny craft .. so when I filled the martini glass .. had extra. Since I had 2 .. it was more like the amount of 3. They didn't have shrimp cocktail on the menu but we asked about it and they said they could do that .. so he ordered us both one. The shrimp were cold and firm .. great and the cocktail sauce just perfect. I got the lobster and it was also perfect he got scallops with risotto, Great meal .. AMAZING VIEW. I kept taking pictures throughout the meal. after the 2 martini's which was really the equivalent of 3 .. I was feeling high on the 95th floor. soo much fun. In the end we both agreed we didn't have room for dessert but they brough this platter of desserts .. I assumed it was the display to let you see what they had to offer. Nope the party planner had arranged to buy us desserts and it was a 3 dessert sampler .. we did finish the crème brûléee but the two others took back to the hotel for next day ... they were also great .. a 3 layer choc cake with cheese cake and ganache and choc cake .. then a blue berry cheese cake .. of the 3 it was our least fav but still great. .. Next day on drive home I made the mistake ,,, I dared ask the cost of our special night ... without parking it cost 265 ouch ....ignorance is bliss .. shouldn't have asked... not something to do every day or year. FYI the bar and ladies room also have great view for those that doesn't get the good seating and still want to take pics.",0.9988,0.76,0.193,0.047,0.562011544011544

2016-09-16,5.0,"This restaurant has a lot of reviews (which I read many of before going here for the first time).  I noticed some said the food wasn't good, service was rude, and other bad comments.  I almost thought of going somewhere else, but, I'm glad I decided to still give this place a try! Yes, it is pricey, but, not much more than other high end restaurants.  And the view is just amazing.  For sure worth it to visit at least once just for that!  You can go to the lounge and get a view; however, it's not as good as sitting right next to the window!  I took my girlfriend here for a birthday dinner and she just loved it!   The drinks are expensive, that is for sure; but, they are also very strong!  My Makers Mark and coke was probably 75% Makers.  My girlfriend got some other drink, I think a Manhattan.  It was also very strong and even came with extra in a separate container (about half the size of the first cup)!  The food prices weren't really that bad.  They were on par with other high end places.  The food itself?  Great!  We got 2 appetizers: Pickled Beets & Octopus.  My girlfriend said it was some of the best beets she's had.  I don't like beets so I didn't taste those.  We both tried the octopus and again, both thought it was very good!  For our main meals we got the vegetable lasagna & the lamb chops.  Again, my girlfriend was extremely amazed how good the food was!  I was skeptical about the vegetable lasagna, but, when it came out it looked and tasted amazing!  The lamb as well was cooked to perfection and simply wonderful!  For dessert we got the creme brulee.  Our server asked if we were celebrating anything and I let them know it was my girlfriends birthday dinner.  The dessert came out with a nice writing of ""Happy Birthday"" on the plate in chocolate.  The desert itself was amazing too!  The last time we had creme brulee was at the Eiffel Tower restaurant in Las Vegas.  We both agreed that the creme brulee here was a bit better.  So, yes you will spend some money here.  It's not somewhere to eat at every week.  But, for a special occasion it is worth it! As for service, that also was top notch!  We made an early reservation for 5:30pm.  I had heard that it is hard to get a window seat from previous reviews so I was a bit worried about that.  We got in, asked for a window seat, and were instantly sat at a window table facing Navy Pier.  I would suggest making your reservation at 6:30pm or before, because the window tables did start filling up by then.  We were not rushed at all.  We stayed at our table from around 5:20 when we arrived to after 7PM!  We wanted to see the view after the sun went down so we ate slow.  They did make us order everything at once.  When we ordered our appetizers our server mentioned we had to order our entrees also (that is their policy).  We ordered the dessert later.  There was a man who helped the main server.  He delivered bread and cleaned off the table.  He also was very kind and asked many times how we are doing and was just very pleasant.  Our server as well was great.  Excellent service! After dinner around 7:15PM we went up to the lounge just to look around and take a couple more pictures.  The lounge was packed!  So full!  So if you want to go up, get a quick drink, see the view and leave, it would be ok.  But, it's super full even on a weekday at 7pm. So overall, the experience was great!  I would recommend you give them a try!  Again, go earlier rather than later!  We went on a weekday, Wednesday night.  Did this on purpose so it would be less crowded.  I would suggest you also try to do this if it is your first time.",0.9992,0.766,0.193,0.041,0.5365575396825396

You'll wait downstairs to get the elevator up (but at least you dont need to wait in line with people going to the lounge, which is a much longer line). Once at the restaurant, there was also a wait to get our table (~15-20 minutes). If you want a table by the window, you'll have to wait even longer.

The views were UNREAL, we had a table right next to the window and felt completely encompassed by sky scrappers. You also get a wonderful view of navy pier and the beaches. The food was wonderful also. Expect to spend a pretty penny here, but for the view and the quality of food you get it's worth it. My parents and I shared the market salad, which I recommend splitting because it's huge. Salad had a good assortment of kale and tomatoes. Then got the broccoli and cheese soup, delicious. We shared the crab cakes for appetizer which were wonderful. My parents both got the corn chowder which I slightly preferred. Our waiter was nice and gave us a small sample of the soup to taste before ordering. For my entrée I got the seared scallops with coconut rice. Absolutely delicious. The scallops were perfectly seared and were juicy. I could eat this all day. For dessert we split a bowl of fresh fruit, not on the menu, but the waiter arranged it for us because we were trying to be healthy. The only down side to this experience was the service, our waiter appeared to be promising at the beginning of the meal, but quickly turned into him never checking on us. I had to ask bus boys and other wait staff around to help us because the service was so poor. My iced tea remained empty for about 15minutes before I asked another wait staff to get me a refill. The only thing they could do to improve would be the service which I was disappointed in. Regardless, this was a wonderful experience and I would definitely come back to take other out-of-town guests. The views are incredible.",0.9969,0.743,0.225,0.033,0.6482202982202981

It was hidden under a bed of Pea Shoots and Radish slivers for an great contrast of crunch and smooth eating. The Ravioli was not as appealing as they were doughy and a bit bland. I shared the Ravioli with my friend for a second opinion and she described them as ""chewy"".  I asked if she meant ""doughy""?  She said yes. They could have been cooked a little longer.

But we decided since we were visiting Chicago and wanted the adventures and gave it a shot. So glad we did! The views were AMAZING!! The food was actually better than expected (at least our plates were good, we got veggie lasagna and seafood risotto). Sure it's pricey and they expect you to at least order an entree. The lines to the observation deck was 2-3 hours. The line to the signature lounge was about 1-2 hours and luckily we had reservations over a month ago, so we slipped right on through. We had NO idea it would be this crazy! Of course we went on a holiday weekend so sure that was part of it. When planning this visit, expect about an hour wait to get a window seat even if you have reservations (and even if you requested a window seat when making reservations). We just got drinks while waiting and allowed us to spend more time at top to watch the sunset. Just FYI, even if you're there celebrating a special moment in life, they do not do anything extra special (or maybe it was because we didn't ask). I can see why, just so busy and I can imagine how some people may feel like they don't have all the special attention. They are however, very friendly, wish you a happy anniversary or birthday, and one waiter would walk by between runs and ask if you want photos. So I suppose they do go the extra mile after all.

2016-08-29,2.0,"I, along with my brother, sister and mother, ordered the special for the evening, which was a steak topped with asparagus and crab with bearnaise sauce ( a total of 4 orders). My daughter ordered the lamb chops. Two steaks were ordered medium well, mine and one other were ordered medium. The chops were ordered medium. When we received the steaks, two were done well, the other two were beyond well done. One chop was rare the other was medium rare. We are a family of chefs, cooks and caterers, so we know how meats should look at desired temperatures. As soon as the meals were delivered, we all knew the orders were cooked improperly. As we did not want to cause too much confusion we did not complain. Also, the assistant servers placed meals with the incorrect diners. After we switched plates and I cut into my steak, I realized that my steak was too done for my tastes so I asked for a server, who immediately apologized and went to replace my meal. However, by then, the special had run out and they had to replace my meal with the standard NY strip with the same toppings. Although the server's assistant, head server for our table and manager apologized, I had to wait while my family (of 9) dined on without me. By the time I received my meal, my family was mostly finished with theirs. I appreciate that the problem was rectified however it did mar the celebration.  I was also less than satisfied with the servers, especially after the meal. One of the server's assistants was very helpful, courteous and friendly. The other, was curt and literally pushed our plates and hands out of his way when placing our plates. The table was missing some silverware when we had our first courses. He seemed to find it an imposition to retreive 2 forks. After dinner, we declined dessert and coffee as we had reservations at another establishment to have our cake for my mother. We waited patiently for the server to bring our check, however it took us flagging down a server (not our own) after THIRTY minutes to bring us the bill. It seemed to me we were DISMISSED from their minds after we declined further offerings. This was supposed to be a celebration of my Mother's birthday and it was turning into a slightly awkward situation. By the time we got an elevator down (that the young lady manning the door allowed others behind us to get before us), we were running late for our next reservation. For a $954 bill and stellar service reputation of this restaurant, I found it to be satisfactory at best. I found myself later that evening musing if our experience would have been better by dining at another famous and well-reputed steak house in the city.

2016-08-15,5.0,"This review is for the Sunday brunch experience. I've been to the signature room and bar a bunch of times.  Usually when out of town guests are in need of a 'wow' and cocktail. The last time I was there for brunch was years ago and it was pretty good then,  but has improved quite a bit since.  I made an early Sunday brunch reservation for my boyfriend's birthday through open table, requesting a window seat and they delivered! The brunch format had changed a bit from the normal troff-style, load em up buffet set up and I'm so glad it has.  You are seated,  served a beverage and given a menu from which you choose an entree that is cooked to order and delivered to your table.  This ensures freshness and proper temperature and avoids the picked over,  poor quality of chafing dish entrees. The menu had about 9 different mains including meat, seafood and vegetarian options. The menu states that you may order more than one entree (I can't imagine, as the entree was a generous portion) I had the fresh fish (sea bass) and my bf had the rack of lamb. Both were very good and prepared correctly.  While your entree is cooked, you head over to the buffet that is stocked with assorted breads,  salads, seafood (king crab, shrimp and oysters), cold cuts, salumi, cheeses, soup, made to order omelette bar, and desserts. Plenty to keep you busy while waiting for your main.   Our servers were attentive and friendly.  Bottom line,  we loved it.  Much more than the first time I was there. We paid $111 for two, (without alcohol & tip) and I thought it was well spent for a special occasion. Definitely got our money's worth and the high quality food and million $ views while dining are still unmatched in a city with new restaurants popping up every week.  I'm happy to report the signature room is a great choice for brunch and showing off our gorgeous city!",0.9957,0.796,0.175,0.028,0.5614941624032532

2016-07-24,2.0,"This review is strictly for their Valentine's Day services. I've never dined here other than that. But I did want to make a note, in case you were thinking of taking your special date here for that romantic day. Basically, the Valentine service is run assembly line style. They pack you in, tightly, and seem rushed to get you out again. Maybe if I was in high school and brought my date here, or I've never been to Chicago before I would have been enamored by the views, which are impeccable, but as a Chicagoan who has been to the top of this tower many times, our dining experience was undesirable. It felt cliché, unromantic, almost buffet style (without the actual buffet), on the 95th floor. Let's be honest, the décor is dated too; it's the best of the 1980's. It feels neither modern, nor classical.  The main reason for the poor review, however, is that the meal/packaged deal was expensive. Furthermore, my steak was stone cold. Probably because they cooked 'em 10 at a time in preparation for the massive holiday crowds. (Maybe the chefs had a secret buffet in the back that they were serving us from. Ha!) From an efficiency point of view this makes sense, ""let's get 'em in, get 'em out,"" but as a guest looking to savor a pricy fillet mignon, I don't want a pre-cooked steak that was probably sitting like a fast food burger under a heat lamp.

Of those, I only enjoyed the taste of two of them, the Pickled beets and the Potato Gnocchi. I felt the Ahi Tuna Tartare had absolutely no taste and the Foie Gras Torchon was very harsh tasting. I will say however that my entree of the 14oz. New York Strip Steak was cooked perfectly to my desired medium rare and the Whipped Garlic Potatoes were very good.

We had the green beans, which were still a little too hard for my preference. My friend had the scallops and she said they were pretty standard. I had the petite steak, which was still a little to small for my taste. It was also a little overcooked and over salted. The mushrooms might be the best salty food of the meal. The creme brulee dessert was, however, really good. With fruits on top, the top was hardened really well.  The view is absolutely hard to beat!

We got a table with the ocean view but later found out that the city view was AMAZING! Foods and service were great but my only complaint was that I kinda felt like the server misled us to think that a side was included in the price of the entree. When we were ordering he would ask ""What would you like for your side?"" This question led us to think that a side was included in the price of the entree when it was not. If he had asked ""Would you like a side with your entree?"" I would've known that a side is an extra charge. We ended up ordering a side for every entree but I wasn't too upset about it. Steaks, salmon, lobsters, and deserts were all good. It was a very pleasant dinner, overall. After the dinner, it took us at least 15 minutes to get on to the elevator. The elevator would take people to the lounge, which is on one floor above the restaurant, from the lobby and take people who are going down from the lounge to the lobby. So we it stops at the restaurant level, either going up or down, it was FULL. They had two tiny elevators operating so they should do something about it. Maybe use one for the restaurant customers only or limit the number of people who get on to the elevator from the lounge level so that people from other floors could go down too!

We arrived just as they opened and got an amazing table in the corner that overlooks both downtown Chicago and Lake Michigan.  The views are stellar!  The food itself was also fairly impressive.   Brunch buffets can tend to have lower food quality,  but this was not the case here.     The buffet itself included a variety of breads (bagels, croissants, muffins, etc), fruit, cold pasta, oysters, king crab leg,  shrimp, cold cuts, and cheeses.   There was also a pastry table that had a variety of mini desserts like tiramisu, creme brulee, chocolate cake, etc. There were two action stations, one was an omletry where you could get eggs prepared in a variety of ways (and obviously omelets).  The other was a root beer float station.  Both my husband and I ordered the eggs benedict off of the entree menu, which were delicious.   The sun-dried tomato sauce was a tasty and fun change of pace, as were the potato pancakes instead of the typical English muffin.  Nothing was earth shattering,  but everything was very fresh and well prepared.  This is a bit on the pricey side ($50 pp) and alcohol not included, but the overall experience was relaxing and enjoyable.   I got my $$$ worth with all the oysters and king crab that I ate.  Favorite items: east coast oysters and mini creme brulee. Least favorite: oatmeal raisin cookie (first cookie in my life that I didn't like.   I think there was cardamom in it, and it was weird).

Too.  Expensive.  A beer was $9-$12.  C'mon, those are baseball prices.  I get that there's some price associated with the ""experience"" of the Signature Room, but c'mon.  Beer that expensive?  And cocktails that are $15 minimum?  Please.  Booze doesn't cost that much, 95th floor of a building or not.   The food is good but, again, super expensive.  You can get great shrimp cocktail, steaks, chicken, and whatever else at other restaurants for at least half as much as Signature Room.  They're definitely not doing anything special or unique up there, so it's so irritating that the prices are so high.   An insider's tip: If you come up for the buffet lunch, you'll only pay like $25 a person, the food is good and unlimited, AND you can usually sit right by the windows since a lot of people aren't up there, especially during the week (even in summer).  Then you don't have to pay to just visit the observation deck and you get lunch with it.",0.9803,0.838,0.122,0.04,0.5944312169312167

Despite having made one through AMEX concierge specifically for a window table, we were given a middle table only and curtly told that window tables were given on a first-come first-serve basis only. Of course, this not only defeats the purpose of making a reservation in the first place, but also the entire premise of visiting this restaurant (which is the view - I doubt that any patron actually chooses this restaurant primarily for the food).   The view itself is admittedly quite breathtaking, but not unexpectedly, the food is mediocre. The crab cakes we shared as an appetizer were drenched in a spicy sauce that overwhelmed the dish. They also arrived at the table lukewarm, and the crispy exterior had gone soggy - indications that they had been sitting out for some time. The seared salmon I got for my main course was passable, but once again the skin had gone soggy and the fillet was overcooked.  Our server was friendly and approachable, but overall service here is rather casual. Dishes are wheeled out on industrial-looking carts in full view of diners to be unloaded table-side, and there was an abundance of shorts and sneakers despite the dress code. The elevators and decor are also showing their age, and indeed the entire restaurant (from food, to service, to design) could use some sprucing up.",0.889,0.907,0.071,0.022,0.612280701754386

However there are limited amount of window seats. They'll tell you that no matter how far in advance you make your reservation (mine was 2 months), they can not reserve a window seat. This is a load of horse crap and a big disappointment. Add to the disappointment,  we sat next to the stairs and bus station - 3 rows in.  Even though the second row with a little better view was VACANT for 2 hours. Per the rude hostess - we don't have any availability to move you and you only get 2 hours at your table. Not sure what school she went to but empty seats do not equal there is NO availability.  The bill for wife and two children was $350 not including a $70 tip and $36 parking.

2016-05-25,1.0,"I am a native Chicagoan, and I do my best to avoid tourist traps. This place is now officially on my ""AVOID"" list. I had been here before around 5 years ago and remembered enjoying it. We went back recently for my mom's birthday dinner and had an awful time. First of all, the food was truly horrible. I cannot wrap my brain around how bad the food was--the quality of ingredients was very poor and the flavors were bad. The hefty price tag and a la carte menu add insult to injury. You're paying a lot for a terrible meal. I got the petite filet, and I've had better quality steak at the Outback Steakhouse. The crowd is mostly tourists. I feel the need to point out that there are hundreds of excellent restaurants in Chicago, and plenty of rooftops with spectacular views. You do not need this in your life, and it does not provide an ""authentic"" Chicago experience at all. Finally, the wait for the elevators was horrible, and when you finally catch one, expect to be crammed in for the ride. The host desk would not honor our request for a window seat, and said the wait for a window seat is 1.5 hours (with a reservation). She said this was a standard procedure, so expect an additional wait if you want a decent table. We ended up seated next to a staircase where people kept coming and going - it was disruptive. The service was average, and the views are nice. Not nice enough to save this horrible, overpriced meal.",-0.9189,0.769,0.093,0.138,0.659753086419753
2016-05-24,3.0,"Improve? Well. Let me begin by saying that the only reason we decided on this establishment was the view. I can't stress that enough. Let's begin with our arrival at the lower level of the John Hancock. Dressed all fancy like we walked past the checkin booth assuming that we would hop into an elevator within seconds. That wasn't the case at all. Instead we stood waiting in our little family circle being starred down by the long, sweaty, angry looking line of people waiting for the same ride. We stood there waiting like circus animals as the first elevator came down, followed the second, finally the third one was our ride up. Cool. Packed in like sardines with very little wiggle room, it felt like we were all standing at attention in silence waiting for our commander to speak to us. No music? no tv? Nothing but dead silence. Sure we had our class clown among us, so he was forced to crack one of those lame old jokes that won him half the elevator. Once we arrived at our respected level we managed to squeeze ourselves out. Arrived 20 min early so we stood around again as if we were waiting for Best Buy to open its doors on Black Friday. We say stood again because of the fact that there were only so many comfy looking sofas for guests to seat on, as they waited to be seated. We didn't complain because we were thrilled to see such an amazing view from our feet than be seated on our butts starring down at countless Facebook posts from our phones. Our dinning table was almost perfect. It felt like we were seated inside a Denny's, minus the green screen looking view of Chicago of course. Also the chairs need to be upgraded, well at least the ones in the back rightwing where they keep the newbies at. Now its time to talk about the pièce de résistance. The meal. The reason we didn't mention anything to the waiter or the manager that quickly said a few words to us, is because we didn't want to cause a scene or a headache on such a special occasion. Special occasion. Its the real reason why people make reservations weeks in advance to such luxurious place, right? The birthday girl hardly touched her chemically produced, paper cut like, ""stinky,"" ravioli. Sure, she didn't say anything because maybe she thought thats how a 30 dollar dish of ravioli is suppose taste like. Seared Sea Scallops was good. The Lamb tasted like lamb, at first it had a hint of steak but then the smell of lamb inside a barn hits your taste buds like a speeding train. It was his first time trying lamb, he didn't like his dish either, so he knows his not a fan of lamb. Moving on to the man of the house, the provider, the payer, myself. I ordered the most expensive dish, 10 oz. Center Cut Grilled Filet of Beef. I've worked in a steak house before so I know how many steaks got returned a night because they didn't meet the desired temperature of the guest. Again, if this were any other night out in the city I would have returned the steak in a heartbeat. It was overcooked. If I were some big shot, undercover food critic I would have complained all over my keyboard and published it. Then again anyone can be a famous critic nowadays. I'd like for the establishment to slap some normal casual food items on their menu for people who aren't use to somewhat high end food items, like maybe a cheeseburger. What I'm saying is add a kids menu. Just an idea. You guys could still charge your hefty prices, like 20 dollars for a cheeseburger because of the spectacular view. Overall I wasn't stratified. This was not my first time of course. I've been here for lunch and brunch in the past, both were amazing. Dinner was a let down. Would I come back? Sure. Next time I won't keep to myself though no matter what special occasion we go on. The 15 dollar gift card was a nice touch by our waiter though. He might have saw that the birthday girl didn't touch her food and felt bad in a sense, or it was just a simple birthday gift. Thank you.",0.9976,0.785,0.156,0.059,0.47672565422565416

First you get to eat off of their ""starter"" buffet, which includes cold seafoods like crab, shrimp, oysters, and smoked salmon. All were super delicious. The buffet also includes exquisite pastries, cold salads, cheeses, crackers, olives, relishes, and an omelet bar. All super tasty and scrumptious. I went back twice for the crab legs. After you indulge in their starter buffet, you can order off of their entree menu. The cool thing is you can try just about everything off the entree menu. For example, I ordered the lamb, then I tried the fish, and then I ordered the french toast. Got to try them all and they were all amazing. After you eat your  entrees you can partake in their dessert buffet which includes delicious little bites AND an ice cream bar. So yummy.  Definitely one of the best buffets I've been to and the cost is reasonable considering the location and the view you get. I think $50 is definitely worth it.  Only drawbacks would be when you get off the elevator the waiting room is not big enough... It's tiny. They also need to figure out their elevator situation...

We had a full pasta appetizer, which was surprising as most places that do appetizers with a group dinner do shared plates or something smaller.  But this was full-on linguine, and it was delicious.  I then had a salad, which was good but not remarkable.  I was pretty full from the pasta and wanting to save room for the main course so I didn't eat all of it.   For the main course I had the Scottish salmon which was cooked perfectly, and the server was nice enough to let me 'swap' the sides from another dish to replace the ones offered with the salmon (I know at some places the chefs don't do substitutions, so that was nice).  I selected the creme brulee for dessert, which was good but not exceptional.  Many others in my party raved about the blueberry cheesecake, so I wish I had ordered that instead, but what I had wasn't terrible. My one complaint is that the service was a bit slow.  I realize it was a large group, and there's a bit of pacing that needs to happen between courses, etc., but there was a lot of time sitting around, especially at the beginning and then waiting for the check, as well as between some courses.  It wasn't terrible, but it probably could have moved a little bit more quickly.  Overall though a great experience.",0.9966,0.775,0.189,0.036,0.6091612554112554

Before the proposal, the waiter had got his lady a small bouquet of roses and a cheesecake (or pastry?) as a surprise (he seemed to have planned in advance). The food. Was good. Not extraordinary but easily enjoyable. I ordered the duck and Mrs got the ravioli. Duck was better looking and tasting than the ravioli. We made it within two digits but barely (and then there was the happy tip). Service was excellent. Friendly staff.",0.991,0.83,0.17,0.0,0.5538065843621399

2016-04-11,3.0,"Good and an amazing view. We picked it for the view, but we were not disappointed. We recently ate at the ""equivalent"" (78th floor Carriage Insignia) in Detroit, this was the better meal.  We were seated promptly though not at a window seat, they had recently all filled up, which was annoying but what can be done? We were one off the window, but still had a decent view though I felt like I was staring over other people's tables.  We ordered a bottle of wine and it was very tasty.  I got a romaine (caesar) salad and french onion soup. The caesar salad was presented as a wedge so it took some knife work to eat it, but the presentation was nice and it was delicious, perfectly executed flavor wise. Not too much dressing, and the dressing was excellent.  The French onion soup had delicious broth, but was otherwise a big let down. It was a very small serving, maybe 7oz, and it had perhaps a tablespoon of cheese on it. I've never seen french onion soup with so little cheese. The broth was really good so it was a shame the cheese (which, lets be honest, is the reason you order french onion soup) was almost nonexistent.  My wife had the beet salad and she really liked it. For my entree I ordered the beef wellington, it was good, though the steak was a little lukewarm when served, it was perfectly medium. But a tenderloin wrapped in puff pastry, how bad could it be? The haricot vert (green beans) that accompanied it were bland though, an afterthought.  My wife got the spiced duck breast and she enjoyed it, said it was one of the best expensive meals she has had lately.  The service was very good, though our waiter could have been more knowledgeable. I had asked him what mushrooms were used in the wellington and he said probably porcini and button (I had been hoping for morel, something fancier, considering). My wife also asked him what was on the ""spiced duck breast"" the menu didn't say, he said ""herbs and spices"" (well duh, but which herbs and spices? Curry? Lemon herb? Its a surprise!).  Still, with the aggregate volume of bussers, water boys, expediters, etc, service was good.  For dessert we had the dark chocolate/white chocolate mousse and caribbean rum pineapple cake. Both were good, though the mousse could have had a larger portion I think. I had mentioned it was our anniversary when I made the reservation, but not since we had arrived, and our plates still came out with candles and the happy anniversary message.  All told it was very good, the food was good, we'd definitely come back. The elevators, yes, were a bit of an issue. There wasn't much of a line when we went up, but when we were coming down the line was 30 or 40 feet long, 90% of it was people just going to look around the lounge. My recommendation? Segregate the elevators and divide the lines, one line for restaurant, one line for sightseers. It shouldn't be that controversial for paying customers to get priority, had I hate to wait in such a line I'd be very annoyed by the time I sat at my table.",0.9986,0.777,0.187,0.037,0.5775766283524905

2016-04-07,2.0,"While it obviously has a great view, I am not impressed with the Signature Room. I came here a couple years ago and sat in the bar area and had a great time, but this visit was terrible. I brought my friend who was visiting from out of town and we both noticed that the lounge looks dingy. The carpet is gross, the chairs are old, and the tables are strangely situated. I guess the owners don't think they need to renovate since they have the view going for them but they really should do some touch-ups in the place.  What was worse than the tacky setting though was the service. We were waiting in line and told the man we would take the first available table. He then starts skipping us because he thought we said window table. I decided to go with it since the window is better. After waiting about 20 minutes a new guy took over the line and tried sitting us down at a non-window table. I said we were waiting for a window seat and he said it'd be 35 minutes. Really? That much longer? But then a minute later he sits us down at a window so who knows what that was about. Then it really got weird with our server, Dannee. She took forever to come over and immediately starts telling us we have to order more after I said I wanted a water. We said we will, but we're still deciding. I'm thinking, calm down lady. As we sat there longer and watched her I realized she might have been on drugs. She took forever to get to anybody, brought the wrong stuff over, and was just so strange. Some of the girls at the table next to us went to use the restroom, and the server must not have seen the guy still at the table because she chased after the girls to pay. She then ran back to the table, sat down by the guy still there and proceeded to tell him she thought they were bailing. I also noticed that at another table near us she gave the group their bill before the food arrived. She was just so unprofessional and slow. Kind of ruined the whole experience.

If you come here, reserve a table in the part of the restaurant that faces the city. If you only ask for a window seat, they might place you on the side that faces the water, and at night when it's foggy you can't see anything, so it's not worth it.  If you don't want to pay through the nose for dinner, you can also go to the lounge, which is one floor up for drinks and bar bites.

Then they brought us to our table, but it was on the north side and the view wasn't that great and when we requested another table they said it was impossible. But after we told them we requested it prior, they gave us a ringer and asked us to wait. After a 30 minute wait we were finally seated, almost an hour after our reservation time.

From the unnecessarily long line to just to get on the elevator, to the herding of crowds towards the more expensive restaurant [an overt effort supplanting the better view in the less expensive bar], this place has hit its bottom.   I have been here a dozen times in 2016, mostly because it's next door, and it's not intolerable to even attempt to put up with their way of shaking down its customers.  I have never eaten here for less than a hundred or often several hundred dollars, yet I have consistently been treated like a six-teen year old playing out the scene in Ferris Bueller's day off; this is not a decent restaurant, mediocre bar or even a great sight-seeing location- it's a big fat Chicago joke.  And the seafood smells fishy, which is the least of its problems.  Thanks for my final food poisoning the other week, that was great after a $750 dinner. The napoleon complex stricken host at the bar is a disservice to his employer.  When the place is half empty on a week-day night, and I'm hungry and tired from a long wok day, do not ever give me a BS line like there's any wait for a seat; your zealousness is unwarranted and a pitiful existence.  When I go to a 'nice' place, I tend to spend large regardless of my attire, because when you know who you are, you don't need to lather you self in tacky logos or formal attire.   Signature Room, enjoy the couple grand you have received from me and my casually dressed friends over the years, because I will never let another person go to your establishment ever again.  You are a disgrace and your management deserves to be made redundant.  In fact, I think the property owners would be better off making a museum of what a tacky tourist trap restaurant looked like in the early 2000's in Chicago; that would provide a better public service to all.  As bad as it sounds, anyone in proximity to the Hancock tower is better off eating at The Cheesecake Factory (which I disdain) than to ever drop the exorbitant dollars to step into the signature room.   P.S. the view is accessible from any high floor in any one of the dozens of skyscrapers in Chicago; this view and bar/restaurant is like the mentally diminished conjoined twin to any comparable dining or drinking experience in the second greatest city in the U.

By this I mean, there is a value to the view (observation fee entrance), the live piano playing, the hot entree out of the kitchen, the buffet which includes pristine seafood, salad bar, and breakfast food. I can eat a dozen oysters during my visit which typically costs over $30 dollars at similar restaurants. And, don't get me started on the crab legs and ceviche. In other words, you are getting one hell of a bargain. If you are new to our city, then, you will never forget the beautiful majestic lakefront view.

Just like many other touristy restaurants in Chicago on a Saturday night, it was pretty busy, so Open Table is your friend.  My take on the interior of the restaurant, is that it is stylish and comfortable. Your likelihood of eating your dinner next to a window with a view isn't as high as one would think, but I think you can make a request for one when you make the reservation. The restaurant is able to accommodate both small tables of people, and also large groups. They only seat complete parties of people, so if you have a member of your group running late, then you have to wait patiently by the host area until they arrive.  The hosts were nice and tolerable, but I wasn't a fan of the staff of waiters that were assigned to our table. The waiters assigned to our table were standoffish (Never smiled, barely looked any of us in the eye, seemingly emotionless). I found it unusual that the three of them were all non personable, but they carried out the main duties of their job, so I guess that is all that matters. To eat I had the lobster bisque, rack of lamb, and bourbon apple dessert. The lobster bisque had a rich flavor, but not the best lobster bisque around. Capital Grille has much better lobster bisque then here. The rack of lamb was actually very impressive since it was tender and seasoned well. I would get the lamb again for sure, and and just skip the lobster bisque.",0.9862,0.837,0.141,0.023,0.5401473922902494

Absolutely horrible design. - Gorgeous view, as expected. Worth the wait? Absolutely not, but if you make a reservation, good spot for cocktails and view. Make sure to get a table right by the window. The wait on a Saturday night was almost 2 hours if you don't have a reservation. Worst part is, they had plenty of open tables, just not enough waiters to service them. - Slow Service: on both occasions, waitresses were nice, but they clearly had way too many tables to handle. Result? I had to run around chasing them and everything would get processed by them with the delay of booting up a Windows 95 computer. So, you are in Chicago, is it worth going here?

The salad barely had any artichokes in it which was weird and it was soooo spicey! Nothing like your nose running before dinner!  The brandy ravioli was delicious and definitely unique. It has a small salad on top of it which was actually pretty good. The dessert wasn't that special but it wasn't bad either.  My friends got the lobster bisque and were disappointed.

2016-02-15,2.0,"Since moving to Chicago almost 6 years ago, I'd never even really thought about going to the Signature Room until I won a gift card there in a silent auction last year. My husband and I happened to be in Chicago without family for Christmas Eve, so we thought a festive evening with a view would be fun. And honestly, it wasn't a bad experience. We sat on the South side of the restaurant, which at night is really the only amazing view. If they seat you on the East side, you're basically looking into a black abyss of Lake Michigan at night. The food on Christmas Eve was good - not great. But the service really lacked.  This theme of bad service continued. When we went there on Christmas Eve, I forgot to bring my gift card, so alas we had to journey back. Not having had a bad experience on Christmas Eve, I figured Valentine's weekend would be another good opportunity to go back and use our gift card. BOY OH BOY was I wrong. Single-handedly the worst dining experience I've ever had in Chicago. I made reservations for 8:30, which you'd think would have been honored based on the fact that The Signature Room called me 4 times to confirm and told me over and over that if we didn't show up, they would charge me $100 on my card. No problem, we were coming. We arrived at 8:15 - standard earliness for an OpenTable reservatino. We weren't seated until 9:30. The front desk staff was so disorganized and rude to all the people there, I couldn't believe it. On top of that, they were doing a Valentine's Day menu that was frankly, abysmal. I checked their website before and there was NOTHING about the prix fixe menu being the only choice. So I was very disappointed. The service was also awful. I had to ask repeatedly for a wine list and the server seemed incredulous that I would want to order wine when they were giving us free $2 glasses of champagne. I give Signature Room a little credit for being a popular place on Valentines Day and Christmas, but at the end of the day, it was not worth the time or the money to go there. My overarching comment is this - just because most of your patrons are one time out of towners looking to get a seat for an hour and pay the least amount possible, doesn't mean you get to treat everyone who comes into your restaurant like a free loader. I wanted to have a high end meal and what I wished was that I had gone downstairs to the Cheesecake Factory!",0.9756,0.83,0.118,0.052,0.5770945945945946

To get to the Signature Room elevators directly, going through the north side doors of the John Hancock building is advised.  If you're going through the south side doors, after entering the building, to your left, look for the ""parking"" elevators across from the Cheesecake factory. From the parking elevators, go to the 4th floor, exit and take a right, following the royal blue pathway.  This pathway leads you to another elevator.  Make sure to take this elevator DOWN to the first floor.  At the first floor, you'll find a Signature Room staff and a long roped line to the Signature Room elevators. There are 2 elevators going up or down from the top, and about 15-20 people can fit per elevator.

The appetizers included oysters, crab legs, fresh fruit, croissants, small Brie and apple pastries, chocolate croissants, kale salad, some other few types of salads, parfait, and a beet coconut soup. The Brie and apple pastries were delicious, and everything was made fresh. For entrees, we had the brunch burger and steak and eggs with potatoes. They were both so delicious and just the right portion! The brunch burger was made with an avocado aioli, friend egg, and bacon on a soft pretzel bun. The steak and eggs isn't want you think it will be. It was a 4 oz juicy steak with an over medium egg on top with potatoes on the bottom. Amazing.

The seafood dishes are always excellent. I recently ordered the red snapper and the cook on it was spot on. Seems odd, but one of my favorite menu items is the potato croquettes as a side, always so delicious. If you're out with a group I recommend ordering the seafood tower to start of your meal! The service is typically very friendly and they make sure you're cared for especially on an anniversary or special occasion. The best part, the views! Stunning city and lake views day and night.

2016-01-26,5.0,"$44 Fix Prixe dinner Menu review Chicago restaurant week. 10Pm on a Saturday night. Requested and GOT a window. Ryan was very helpful. There was a slight gliche' at the beginning when we asked if there were any specials, and when he said ""no"" we asked for the Chicago Restaurant Week menu. Ryan went off and got us two. We liked everything. The lobster bisque and the artichoke salad were nice light starters. With Ryan's help we chose the Australian lamb chops and the Duck breast over several other options. Portions were not super large but we still left with small leftovers, actually one of the two lamb chops, and some of the sliced Duck breast. The warm Apple Bourbon Cobbler and White & Dark Chocolate Mousse Cake were fantastic and there were NO leftovers. RIP. Delicious. View is spectacular of course. I'd been up on the observation deck many times but had never eaten here. Drinks are pricey as expected but nice choices. By the glass wines were $14 and up but good enuf selection. I didn't see any bottles I would choose that were under $100.  Last reservation is taken at 10:30. We eat late and if you come late you will not be rushed and will have a better shot at the window seating. We were here 2 hours. We had a great view of the lake and Navy Pier and South City view.

The sauce tasted like red wine with no flavor to it, almost like we wanted to add soy sauce to it. My steak was not seasoned very well either but the calamari was good.

2016-01-18,5.0,"Absolutely fabulous weekend brunch. I avoid the big weekend brunches in this area, because they're mostly too much food at too big a price tag.  I just can't eat slices of ham, roast beef, and turkey after a three egg omelette, on top of the seafood starters and then the desserts. Then we found this brunch.  Great buffet of seafood (shrimp, crab legs, and more), bagels, breads, soup, fruit, cheeses, meats, and more.  The shrimp were fresh and delicious.  Followed by an omelette station.  But then the surprise:  For your main course you order off the menu!  Terrific choices, from beef and pork to traditional breakfast fare.  The portions are moderate, which is fine considering all the rest of the meal.  I had New Zealand lamb chops.  There were two, perfectly prepared, not over cooked, and as good as any restaurant's lamb chops.  Now the next surprise:  If you want more, you can order a second main course.  No extra charge. Desserts were an ordinary selection of small pieces of the typical desserts, although the ones I had were good.  Ice cream sundaes as you want to have them made too.  And giant containers of great hot chocolate, with the accompaniments too. This is an awesome deal, with views out the Hancock windows to top it off.  Drinks included, but be careful.  They don't tell you that a second liquor drink will cost you.  The first is included.   I'm not focused on prices.  Check it out online if you're interested.  I'll give you a hint.  Half the price of a nearby top-end hotel's brunch.",0.9731,0.836,0.142,0.022,0.5268740031897927

All were delicious, especially the soup. I will try a few of other items (many, many) next time.  There is a custom  omelet chef awaiting your order but also a menu of entrees, from which you can order more than one. I knew one would be enough for me, especially since I had already taken a look at the dessert table.  I narrowed it down to Eggs Benedict, a delightful choice, especially the substitution of a potato pancake (crispy!) under each poached egg, rather than an English muffin. Also, bits of lobster in the bordelaise sauce. Yum!  My husband truly enjoyed the rib eye steak and eggs with lyonnaise potatoes.  On to dessert: I enjoyed miniature creme brûlée, a tiny square of cheesecake and a couple of bites of 3 layer chocolate cake.  No room for any more of the choices!  Our excellent server, Patrick, kept the coffee cups filled , the dishes cleared, and the napkins replaced when we went back for more. We enjoyed the view of Navy Pier and next time will ask for a different window table view.  No matter how little or much you eat, it's worth the $50.  Go there!!!!",0.9892,0.816,0.163,0.021,0.5437962962962962

We went for the brunch, figuring that if we pay $45 per person, at least we could eat as much as we want. Or could. The Signature room's website stated that there is a dress code, so we both dressed up, but when we got there we noticed most of the people were dressed more casually, which made sense for a brunch.  The place was packed and we were concerned that even though we had a reservation, we would get some crappy table in the middle where you can't see the view, but we were pleasantly surprised when it turned out there was a table waiting for us at the most perfect location by the window. The view was insanely beautiful! Already worth it! In addition, it turned out that with the brunch you get 1 mimosa per person on the house, which made the first impression even better. We started with the buffet of starters, which was pretty awesome, with all kinds of omelets, cheeses, fish, and fruits and at that point we needed to remind ourselves that there are actual courses still to come.  For the main, my husband got vegetable lasagna, then eggs Benedict, and finally Chocolate Belgian waffle. Yes, it is a lot, but first, he is 6""5 tall and second, the waiting time between each order was long. At least half hour. I got the Chef's selection of fish, which was just ok, and then the steak and eggs which was really good! They also have a very nice dessert buffet, but at that point we were so full there wasn't any chance.  Overall the experience was great and we both agreed we should come back to taste the rest of the menu!

We had called a few days before and they told us that window seats were requested upon arrival so we would have to get there earlier than our reservation time in order to request a table by the window. So my husband got there early and checked in and requested the table. When all our party had arrived they told us a table by the window would be another 45 minute wait. I told the woman in charge that we had gotten there earlier than our reservation time because they had told us to do so. So how could they make us wait an EXTRA 45 minutes. The whole point of a reservation is to have a table reserved for the time of arrival. Of course I was very bothered but they were finally able to accommodate us in a table with the BEST view in the entire restaurant! The food was very good. I had the filet which was so delicious.

Smith and Wollensky was nice because we were outside and the 70 degree temperature, with an outside ambiance were enjoyable.  But the Signature Room took the cake. We were seated in a prime seat, it was dark outside, and the views could not have been better.  The views get a five star alone. The food. This part was ok.  The appetizer (seafood platter) was good, it was cold by design, good presentation. Both parties do have to order a full entree, even with two person appetizers, and salads don't count. So being a rather small female, and never able to eat my entire plate, this was disappointing. It's difficult enough finding plates meant for the top end of one-size-fits-all to work for me, but also, large salads or salad and soup didn't count.  This meant ordering a large entree I didn't really want, or not ordering appetizers. The food and the restrictive ordering requirements would have gotten three stars.  The customer service is really what puts this place over the edge. Perhaps we're just inured with restaurants treating customers like they are fortunate to eat there, but the manager at the Signature Room is what sets this apart. I'll start by telling you that our food took over one hour to arrive. We were having drinks and had appetizers, so we were fine waiting, but at some point, we realized it was never going to show up.  When we told our waiter we just wanted the ticket and to leave, instead of arguing with us or telling us the food was on the way, he got the manager who clearly apologized, told us it was their fault, told us the food would be there shortly if we would just wait a few more minutes, and later gave us gift cards to try to get us to give them another chance.  This above and beyond treatment of the customer as valuable earns this restaurant, for us, redemption as the highlight of our week of culinary extravagance.",0.9816,0.84,0.113,0.046,0.4234920634920635
2015-11-21,5.0,"A high-end eatery located at the very top of the John Hancock. The view from up here is stunning from every angle. I would suggest you take the time to check out the bar area too, it will give you a nice view of the city and suburbs. The dining room area of this restaurant shows off Lake Michigan from its many windows. On a clear day it is very easy to see Indiana, Michigan, and even Wisconsin. While the view is a huge plus this place also serves up some great fine-dining. They didn't just take advantage of their location, this food would be worth eating even if it were on the ground floor. Some of the best steaks I've ever eaten, and every meal is all-around perfect. Their soups are great, the salad is great. Heck, even the bread is great. Rich mashed potatoes are a great side to the perfectly cooked and seasoned filet. The homemade sauce poured on your plate is also a nice touch, but the steak is good enough that it could do just fine without it. Their waitstaff is very professional (as expected) and will frequently check up on you and clean off your table. I've been here a handful of times all under different contexts, for both lunch and dinner. I have never had an issue with the food or any complaints. There is somewhat of a dress code, but it's an obvious one. Just look clean and nice, wear formal clothing. Not a big deal and honestly if you don't dress professionally you'll feel self-conscious compared to the other diners.

2015-11-14,2.0,"The views. People come here for the views. The service here made that abundantly clear. And perhaps the Signature Room expects that it's mostly a one-time visit location frequented by mostly tourists, so they don't focus on providing the best service they can to those who might want to turn it into a regular dining location.  Though the views are nothing short of stellar, the attitude of most of the employees here as well as the quality of the food you pay for was rather disappointing. And this wasn't my first visit here, I just don't remember it being such an overall negative experience. It honestly was the lowest point of our girls' day out in the city (we are from the western suburbs and have been here before; after this experience we're considering not returning sadly). My two grandmothers, mother and two sisters all shared in the experience with me.  The poor experience began with the rude and impatient attitude of the woman working the elevators on the first floor-- she pretty much outright ordered us to move and not to move, making us feel more like pawns in the midst of her long and laborious day rather than guests who were warmly welcomed to a ""signature"" spot of the beautiful city of Chicago.  Upon our arrival to the 95th floor we reported for our reservation we had made and waited a fair amount of time to get a table. During our wait we could actually HEAR the hosts and hostesses talking and complaining about us because of our time of arrival (granted, the restaurant still had 45 minutes before it even closed, leaving a fair amount of time to dine and pay our bill). But Signature Room staff, if you're going to complain about your customers, at least do it in a place we can't see or hear you. This immediately offended us as we were seated at our table.  While the food was fine, and our server finally warmed up to being happy with us (did something really bad happen on the day we came to set off all the employees??), we had to remind him an upwards of 4-5 times for more butter for the rolls as well as at least 2-3 times each for any refills on our drinks including just water. Having serving experience myself, I was pretty disappointed at the lack of attentiveness. Especially in such a nice and higher class restaurant.  Ultimately you pay for the food what you get out of the views. Thankfully we came on a clear day and got a couple good pictures, but those will last us a long time before, if ever, we come back again.",0.8966,0.856,0.088,0.056,0.540491452991453

Now the food, for this price , normally, the food should be better than what they serve. However, due to the incredible location/view, the signature room gets 4 instead of 3 stars. The crablegs were good, but boring. The oysters were not properly shucked. Yes, they made a decent effort to separate the shells, but they did not cut the oyster from the bottom shell! Please shuck oyster properly, so I do not have to cut them off myself with a dull knife. The rest of the buffet was meh. Let's move on to the ordered entrees. We ordered the chocolate waffles and the rack of lamb for entree. The chocolate waffles were not crispy but it did come with some decent syrups and condiments. The rack of lamb came over cooked, and the chefs did not render off the fat of the lamb chop. I could make a better lamb chop than these guys.

2015-11-11,3.0,"If you're wondering why the reviews for the Signature Room are so hit or miss, it's because your experience will truly be a gamble. Here are some tips that may help: 1. Try to visit during ""off hours"". My friend and I made a reservation for lunch during the week. There was no line/wait for the elevators and we were seated immediately. 2. Ask for a window seat once you check in. This is separate from your reservation, and you may have to wait. Luckily, our party of two was able to snag a window seat no problem but it was not facing the iconic Chicago skyline south of the building. Instead, we were facing east looking out over Lake Michigan. Some people may enjoy this view, but I was disenchanted. 3. Tables of 4 seemed to fare well. As I looked around at the ""prime seats"", I noticed most parties of 4 had great views. This could have been a coincidence though. 4. Expect overpriced food. If you know you'll be disappointed by this, just grab a drink in the lounge to enjoy the view. The blood orange margarita was good. 5. If you didn't have a good view from your table, head to the lounge afterward just to take a good picture. We simply told the hostess that our server sent us over and she was very nice about letting us snap a few photos.  Good luck and enjoy!",0.994,0.749,0.212,0.039,0.5822172619047619

You get a completely panoramic view of the city which is arguably better than the view from the Sears Tower. Aside from that there's really nothing to shout about, the food is OK and the service is poor. Firstly we reserved a table for four people at midday for lunch. Three of us arrived but unfortunately one of our party was running 15 minutes late. Despite the fact 3 of our 4 guests were there and the restaurant was almost entirely empty, the host flatly refused to seat us. I told her I'd like to enjoy a drink at our table while we waited but she said that was impossible until all 4 were there. This seems an insane policy, had I reserved a table for 3, we would have been sat immediately at a table for 4! The food was also mediocre and table service was terrible. It took 10 minutes for someone to come take our drink order and a further 40 minutes to receive the salads we ordered for lunch. The restaurant was also pretty much empty so why it took that long is a mystery. I ordered the salmon salad which was very uninspiring. Undercooked salmon on a bed of lettuce with dressing and nothing more. In short - views are great. Service and food is anything but.",0.5571,0.81,0.093,0.097,0.5929012345679012
2015-10-30,2.0,"Recently visited for the first time. They were unable to honor our reservation time so they advised us that we could go to the lounge on the 96th floor and they would call us. A little unhappy, but these things happen. As someone who had a reservation, I expected we could just go upstairs and grab a drink while we waited. You can do this, but not until you wait half an hour with every tourist in Chicago in a line just to get to the bar. Now I'm slightly annoyed. After finally getting into the bar, I was not impressed with the decor. I know you go there for the views, but this place is in serious need of a refresh. I wasn't sure if I was in an upscale restaurant/lounge or grungy bar. Not to mention that it is so loud that you have to scream to hear someone 2 feet from you. After sitting in the lounge for over an hour and seeing our waitress only twice (order first drinks and pay), we finally decided enough was enough. We got up, took a few pictures and attempted to leave. Oh btw, there is only 2 small elevators to get to the restaurant, so you're going to have to wait in another line just to exit. Consider me officially aggregated at this point. I didn't get a change to try the food, but it didn't look that amazing. I know people come here for the view, but if you're going to have a restaurant, I expect more. The views are amazing, so save your money and just go to the observation deck. 5 stars for the view, 1 star for everything else.

The views were also just ok.  My friend went to the Woman's rest room to take photos at my suggestion as I have read on social media that the woman's restroom has the best views of the city.  Not so she reported.  All in all, the expense for the meal , the views , and the parking was not worth the visit.  A few days later we went to the Sky Deck at the Willis Tower ( the Ledge ) and the views were breath taking.

There's a starter buffet - it included crab legs, shrimp cocktail, a made to order omelet station, and an assortment of tasty pastries and bagels. Buffets always have an issue of providing good quality baked goods - no issue here! The croissants and homemade cream cheeses were en pointe!  The entrees was where we were blown away.

I know that it is a nice restaurant but Chicago brunch dining, especially at a tourist hotspot such as the John Hancock Center, could be formal or informal, in my mind. About a couple of hours before my brunch reservation (made online), I called the restaurant's Reservations line and asked if there is a dress code, specifically if shorts are acceptable for brunch dining. The answer: ""Yes, business casual"" and ""Yes, shorts are OK if you are dining for brunch."" Some of my group had shorts and collared shirts/polos and tennis shoes on. We got there and then taken aside and informed that they ask for business casual for dining and to look neat. Fortunately, they still honored my reservation. However, if I was informed correctly from the start: (1) my guests and I would have dressed appropriately without issue (2) we would not have felt out of place or awkward being underdressed as we walked past the appropriately dressed guests (who gave side glances and looks) and (3) I wouldn't have felt uncomfortable when taken aside to be told about properly dressing for the dining experience. Otherwise, food was satisfactory and wait and bussing service was above average. Also, I had requested online for a table with window views - we got a corner table! I would only go here again if visitors requested. Not for frequent brunching. But now, I know how to dress for it. Still, if the Reservations phone staff and the restaurant staff were on the same page and gave consistent information, I would have enjoyed the views and dining experience from up high more instead of feeling lower than the other guests.",0.983,0.86,0.118,0.022,0.5669333333333334

I have to say I was let down and will not be returning. When I arrived 15-20 minutes early, I was told that seating was occurring on time. When I said ""no problem just come and get us in the bar when the table was ready"" I was told that I would need to come back at the time of my reservation. I thought it was odd, but no big deal. We would have a drink and head downstairs. When I got to the bar I was stopped. Not sure what the issue was, but there were plenty of seats at the bar. I explained to the host that we were going to have a drink and then head downstairs for the 7 pm reservation. No problem, right? Wrong...the gentleman hemmed and hawed and finally sat us at the bar.  Since we were now pressed for time, I immediately handed the bar tender my card so we could have our drink and then cash out. He ran the card and it came back declined. I was quite embarrassed. I thought there can be no issue, so I asked him to run it again. He did so 2 more times. He explained to me that it is coming back declined...WTF!!! At this point I am mortified. I am now that guy...sweet, thanks. We then ran another card and same thing....OMG. I am now beyond embarrassment. If there is anything that I am, I am not that guy. He then says ""let me talk with my manager because we have been having problems with the system"". Really? You couldn't have done that more discretely?  After being assured by my wife that it was not an issue and I should not let it ruin my night, we walked downstairs for dinner (7:05). After alerting the hostess I was told stand to the side and I will be seated soon. I then stood there for 15 minutes and was finally sat around 7:20 or so. We were then seated in the side room, not the main dining room. I am not sure what the room around the side was, but the views were amazing. I have never been sat in that area before. The 2 things I immediately recognized was the ambience was definitely different. First off you cannot hear the piano in that room. Second, the chairs are what you would expect at a wedding reception...cheap and temporary. Last was bright Exit sign against the wall. Our waitress was very nice, but the dinner was underwhelming. First, I dislike ordering all at once. I like to enjoy some appetizers a few drinks and then order my main meal. Since we ordered everything at once and since we ordered two appetizers they both came at the same time. There was no room on the table. The oysters take up the whole table. Second, were the wine glasses. I wasn't expecting the Olive Garden glasses...come on man. Last was the embarrassing Happy Birthday dessert. It was not our Birthday.  At the end of the day I get it.

I had the seafood pasta with black pasta, and I enjoyed the sauce that it came with.  Service: Was a bit odd, and I felt it took a while for the server to warm up.

I accidentally spilled some of my champagne on the floor, and the server glared at me then walked away. I'm not sure if he expected me to clean it, but clearly I didn't, as it was not my place to.

2015-09-01,4.0,"like everyone else said, you do pay for the view.the view is stunning, especially if you sit on the side with the city-scape! i think you just have to get lucky or wait one out even with reservation. the lounge upstairs looked fantastic too, however if you want to do that instead.  cozy, and intimate, i think this is a perfect place for a date and or business meeting to impress your client/boss, your gf/bf's parents etc. servers are friendly and top notch as I expected from a place like this, including the man coming by with bread and bussers bringing out the food.  now to the food: wines: we had the cabernet and the chardonnay on the menu at the time. the cab was okay, not too deep in flavor but after airing it out, turned better. chardonnay was dry and just the way I like it. and to be honest, at $18 (red) $15? (white) its worth it. i've seen more expensive places with mediocre wines. for the price tag, def good choices! lobster bisque: a little tangy and not too rich/creamy. I really liked that since it was different, but the bf seemed to like the creamy option more. I used our bread (which the butter is SO good btw) to scoop out every bit of the soup. my main: roasted halibut. under salted, it was okay. (minus one star from here only really). overall, it was so....unflavorful, it was disappointing. but because I read everyone else's review saying the food here is whatever, I wasn't too shocked. BUT... bf's main: rack of lamb......oh. my. god. it was BURSTING in flavors and it was probably one of the best lamb i've had. so tender and juicy, and not incredibly gamy so even if you dont LOVE lamb, i still suggest you try. the sauce was rich, and the potato? thing on the side was so so flavorful as well. if you ever go, seriously, rack of lamb!! mango sorbet: it was light and very rich in mango flavor. it was so perfect every bite.  top it off, really, our server was incredible. overall, it was an amazing dining experience and spectacular view. will i go again? maybe, I have so much more to explore in chicago. but if there is someone whos never been, i would take them in a heart beat! lamb. seriously. you won't regret it.",0.997,0.766,0.201,0.033,0.5982026143790848

It still took us a whopping 15 minutes to get seated in a near-empty restaurant. No idea why. Ordered a couple bottles of champagne, two appetizers (calamari and mushrooms), and a bunch of entrees. I can only speak for the calamari and rib-eye steak special: Calamari - WAY too much batter. It was 80% batter and 20% calamari.  Rib-eye steak special - pretty small portion for rib-eye. Asked for medium and it came out medium-rare-minus. It sat on top of mashed potatoes and two tiny fried onion pieces were sprinkled on the steak (gotta have veggies...?).  I mentioned to the host before being seated that it was my friend's birthday and FYI: there is no complimentary anything. They put a candle on our dessert though, so that's nice.

I've lived in the city long time and I respect what people try to do overall. Anyway this place is highly overrated. The food is pretty good, not great, pretty good and I paid a lot less for way better food elsewhere. I ordered the duck , which is one of the more inexpensive entrees. While it was fatty and delicious in some respects, the best part was actually the side dish, some sort of risotto or something. With this place, you are clearly paying for the view and the ambiance. The reservations are a must so if you are trying to come here make sure you have one. They do have a lounge upstairs if you want to be single and get a cocktail, but there was a long line for that particular area and I am not sure if those people ever got in. We had a reservation for a birthday dinner and were seated immediately upon arrival. You do have to take an elevator right up and they pack it to the gills so be ready to weirdly stand next to someone before eating. The place is pretty tight in terms of table space so I'm not sure how accessible it is for those in wheelchairs. You will not pay less than $50 for your meal which may include one cocktail (but not parking). This is a great place to take people who have never been to Chicago and enjoy tourism or a girlfriend who is really pissed at you and wants you to spend a lot of money on her.

Walking into the Hancock tower, our friend and wonderful guide, took us to this place to enjoy the views and enjoy a drink 96 stories in the sky. You must be asking yourself: ""Why didn't you just go to the observation deck instead?"" Because, I wanted a drink. On the 96th floor. Haha, no really, actually the reason why is that this place would be cheaper to go to instead of the observation deck. Plus, you get a drink, so that's just an additional plus. I think this place is a one-time kind of visit. You go up there, get a drink, snap some photos, say you've been there, and that's a wrap. Maybe a second time to bring fellow first timers. The drinks were superb though, and I think it's a better deal than going on the observation deck. ***One other thing to note: Make sure you're wearing something appropriate.

When we asked for wine recommendations, he looked stunned. We aren't wine experts by any means, but without a sommelier, I'd expect the service staff to have some level of knowledge. The fois gras was served as a pate and disappointing. Lobster bisque and Caesar salad get high marks. The filet was cooked perfectly, but we didn't care for the wine reduction sauce - it's a personal preference to have steaks in their natural juices. The asparagus and fingerling potatoes were excellent as well. The chocolate mousse cake was OK.  Overall, a fine experience. The views and ambiance were perfect for the occasion.

There are ~ 10 entree items to order from (steak and eggs, fish, eggs benedict, pancakes, ....) and there is no limit to how many you can order! I'm used to the food being mediocre at skyscraper restaurants in other cities but the brunch food here actually is really good. My fish entree item tastes as good as if you had ordered it as a dinner item somewhere else.  Highly recommend the weekend brunch.

I watched the scenario play out every time a new table approached the middle sections as opposed to the window. They complained and said horrible things to the staff. HORRIBLE. Then they would complain to the manager who would then explain that they are sorry. I watched while managers and waiters and busboys were being yelled at to the point where it is border line abusive.

When I arrived in a polo shirt, nice jeans and sandals like two women told me was alright on the phone with a reservation, I was instantly confronted very aggressively by the manager and told that I was not allowed in. He actually had the balls to tell me that no one would tell me it was alright to wear what I did or they would be fired and I was lying. I ubered a ride for an 1 1/2 to get there and came from out of town on a recommendation. Wow. Shame on this archaic wannabe dinner club relic. Maybe could have got a brontosaurus burger.

2015-07-15,1.0,"This review is primarily on customer service.  7/15/15 We came to town to visit friends and all they could talk about was the Signature Room.  We made it there about a quarter past nine, as our friends have a new baby. As soon as we approached the podium, the young woman attending said without prompt, ""You can't go up with the stroller."" We then let her know that we wouldn't be going to the lounge. Without a smile, she continued, ""Our kitchen is closed.""  We then asked what time the kitchen closed, to which she replied, ""well it's different every night. You never know."" (We were trying to avoid this mistake again in the future). Again, no smile, no sympathy.  I'm sorry, but being in customer service myself, when you are delivering somebody bad news, you usually would like to do it with a little bit more kindness. We are not upset that we were unable to eat there, we were upset with the way that it was handled.

2015-07-12,4.0,"In a nutshell:  1.  Staff super sweet minus the  RUDE manager (read below)  2. Food was honestly great! Unlike what a lot of people say. If you're worried about the portions see number 5 below!  3. View is gorgeous, wait for a window seat it is WORTH it unless you want to be peeking over other diners' tables, not nice  4. They told us 45 mins for a window seat, ONLY waited 9 mins! SWEET  5. Order an appetizer and/or side dishes because main dishes do not include anything on the side so a steak will be JUST a steak. 6. Get ready for a PACKED elevator ride! Literally packed!  7. Try your best to get the lakeshore drive window seat because it is MOST gorgeous  8. Don't under For this restaurant but also being overdressed might feel awkward. Heels is dressy enough for a lady and a dress shirt is good for a man ( tie not necessary) But you might not care.  The only reason I am not giving this 5 stars is due to the rude lady who I believe was a manager on that shift. It was our first time there so we wanted to get beautiful pictures. My fiancé and I did not have the perfect window seat (lake and navy pier view only) so on our way out we walked around the restaurant and had asked that lady kindly to take a picture of us in a space between two tables (you will see people do that) . The tables were occupied but there was space and I was planning to ask the diners regardless for permission to take pics near their tables (I know manners)! I mean to pay that much for a dinner at the 95th and not get a descent picture with the beautiful view?! So after we nicely asked her she refused and said she can't take a picture because there are people dinning in that area, ok understandable reason. However, her attitude upset me the most and my fiancé as well , she was talking down to us as if we were asking her to pay for our dinner for example. And she did not even say sorry! All other employees and servers that night were EXTREMELY kind, helpful and just made our night so much fun! She at the end of it all just ruined it. Like it was also embarrassing!  And she was definitely the manager so it would be expected of her to act even more kind. We walked a to a different side of the restaurant and there, a servant who had even looked like he was in a hurry took the pleasure to take a couple of pictures of us, VERY kindly. I apologized to the couple who were dining there (and they were nicely telling us to take our time) and got our pictures. He was very sweet, the waiter.  As for the experience, it was GREAT! Food was actually impressive; I was expecting SUPER tiny portions, but our steak (NewYork strip) was actually huge. The sautéed shrimp was very delicious (small portion appetizer) perfectly cooked and buttered well. you cannot go there and only order an entree because it will be JUST an entree unlike other restaurants it will not include a side of rice/veggies/mashed potatoes for example. So I had the romaine salad which was very basic but I love salads anyways and my fiancé had the broccoli soup (very small portion) but it was tasty! Also the whipped potatoes was delicious and enough for two.  The atmosphere there is amazing regardless of what view you get. We asked for a window seat and they said it would take 45 mins and we decided to wait. Only after 9 mins exactly (I always start a timer, because I know the estimate is not always accurate) the pager went on and we had our window seat. Which... Wasn't the best honestly :( I had wished we were seated at the Lakeshore drive side which is gorgeous or even the city's side, we had the side of navy pier and the lake which was just pure darkness after sunset. But again regardless of where you get seated the ambience of the place is very romantic very comfortable because tables are placed not too close so you get your privacy! Also it's pretty dark there with dim lights and candles.  I can't wait to try the brunch there it's great if you have visitors from out of town or for Mother's Day.",0.9994,0.732,0.218,0.05,0.6729131054131051

2015-06-28,1.0,"Disgusting Attitude and Service. Take your money and TIME elsewhere. This place made me feel like ""I am begging for free food and they did a favor by throwing me some week old scraps"". First of all, f*** the dress code, we saw men walking around in cargo shorts and tanks..  Me and my friend were traveling for two weeks cross country from New York City to California and stopped here to visit his sister and sister's friend.  This by far has to be the worst place we've ever been served at in the whole country.  We get there at 10:30pm on a Sunday, there is no line, no one waiting to be sat, most of the tables finishing up or empty, and the Host, whose face looks like he wants to burn the place down, sits us at a table in some corner where we can't see anything but the carpet and each other's faces and a wall. There are plenty of tables available around the glass view area.  We go up and request to him if we can be moved to the glass viewing area, his job at this point is a yes or a no, to which he actually replied ""I'll see, I'll come back to your table and let you know"".  We come back and sit and wait, he passes is a couple of times, again he has no one to sit, and his main job is being the Host.  Then finally he has a few guests, two or three different parties, all of whom he decides to sit at the view tables, we were dressed appropriately for the place, showed good manners and asked politely but why the change in service for certain people?  He came by again and in most friendliest manner sat down a group of 9 people to the seats they requested in front of us because they didn't like his choice. and then left again, at this point the waitress had asked us twice and we told her we were waiting for him to tell us what to do. He then had another group of guest walk in and he sat them at the table we requested for. What is that? We wait a few minutes still nothing, he keeps passing up, looking around making sure everything is good but does not even glance at us. The guests he just sat down also request a different table with a view on the other side of the room, he immediately takes them to the other side.  Then 5 mins pass and he comes up to us and says ""Just take it, Just take it guys, just take it"", In such a despicable manner, Like we are some degenerates that don't belong there.  The table has no light we can't read the menu, every other table comes with a electric candle, they notice and don't offer or come and put one and we ended up taking one from a table next to us. And through out the night the host comes to each table around is and both tables next to us and asks how everything is and if he can do anything, looks at us directly with eye contact and walks away without even smiling.  ATROCIOUS ATTITUDE AND SERVICE, I am telling everyone one of my friends and family to never even step foot into this building.   No reason for us to have been served that way.  My friend's sister and roommate are attending physicians at Weiss Memorial Hospital, and they will be letting all their colleagues and friends know as well.  Wish I can give zero, unfortunately yelp doesn't allow. FOOD: we ordered four drinks, Mai tai was disgusting, orange creme was good, gin and tonic regular, and whiskey sour which also was alright.  Chocolate mouse cake which was just like any other bakery, but priced outrageously at $9.00 and coconut cheesecake which was pretty good priced at $8.00.

Perhaps I'm spoiled by opentable where reservation availability is instant, but felt as though it was a ploy to make the place feel exclusive. The food was good, but not exceptional.  My friend expected bits of lobster in the lobster bisque, which on its own is not a big deal, but we decided to split the seafood tower among the three of us, thinking it would be enough food for us along with a soup and a side.  It got awkward when our server asked us for entree orders and had to 'check with his manager' to see if we could treat the tower as one entree for me and my wife while my friend ordered a separate entree.  The price of the tower was equivalent to three entrees.  The kicker was, they charged me for two teas after asking for a refill of hot water. I can understand that they want to prevent gawkers from taking up table space and only ordering the cheapest thing from the menu, but set a minimum order amount and be up front with it instead of making the customer feel nickled and dimed.

2015-06-21,1.0,"I will begin this sombre review with the disclaimer that I have only been here ONCE. I was also here for dinner...during RESTAURANT WEEK.   I am actually disappointed that I feel compelled to write a review what in my mind puts me in the ""that girl"" category.  No matter.  Ambiance: The general ambiance of this place is one that promotes prestige, class, and luxury. The bathroom is a glorious tribute to a female's vanity.  You have beautiful lighting and a very chic set up for the mirror to look at yourself. Impressive.  The walk to the restaurant is also ""fun"", albeit, an experience, as you take an elevator the the 95th floor. The space is large and open, high ceilings and an absolutely breath taking view of chicago.  Tables along the windows for a romantic view and a very lovely wine cellar that is enclosed in glass with golden hues.  Personal experience: I will say...I was astonished.  I went here with a party of eight.  We made a reservation and were advised that we would not be seated until the LAST person made it in time to seat us.  I will admit, that I was nervous, and while I understand the ""uniformity""....I couldn't help but think that we should just have been seated and offerred a drink..after all...we were going to order from a prixe fixe menu.  Additionally, I was personally not too happy about being forced to pay for coat check.   Once seated, the menu was positively promising.  The setting of the table...immaculate with a plate in front of me that has been engraved with gold lettering ""The Signature Room at the 95th"".   Which....was there just for show.  I find it very tacky to have a plate in front of you that will NEVER be used. (it's actually funny in  a scoffing kind of way)  Anyway, I ordered the courses with a beet salad, rack of lamb and chocolate mousse.   The food: For a restaurant that has a Michelin RECOMMENDATION (no, they do not have a star) they definitely have an attitude that boasts of entitlement. I will go on a limb and say that I'm nit-picking.  My review is personal. The plate on which my beet salad was served, had ridges on it.  Deep ridges...the dressing barely touched beets.  So it felt like I was eating just beets and spring greens that were all too bitter and dry.  There was a fig and blue cheese ball that came with my salad.  There were actually three...too big for the size of the salad.  So big that they were overwhelming in flavor and rendered a very dry mouth-feel.  So it was like the feeling of eating a spoonful of peanut butter and not being able to chew. Mediocre. My lamb entree gave me mixed feelings. So it was cooked to perfection! It was medium rare, and it had a beautiful crust from being seared.  However, the rest of the components of the lamb were very obscure because I couldn't get a proper explanation from the waiter about what I was eating.  So, I was given a mint pesto..that was delicious and complimented the lamb...then there was raisin chutney...this was NOT chutney!  NO! it was a raisin compote because they were still whole, drenched in simple syrup and had whole pine nuts. (um...what:?)  and it was complimented with soft polenta...which was cold in the center.   Dessert...was good...nothing dramatic.  NOthing memorable.  Service: ATROCIOUS. The GM was making rounds at the tables with couples around us...we were a lively bunch (i.e. a few were loud, we were laughing, joking, cursing...but happy...and eating...and PAYING customers) and he purposely decided not to touch our table. Next....you want to be a fine dining establishment..but you serve someone a beer, don't chill the glass AND you leave the CAN on the pristine table?!  Call me crazy, but no fine dining establishment would be caught dead leaving the aluminum can on the table.  The restaurant was virtually empty.  By the time we finished our meal, the place was starting to be filled.  That being said, The waiter kept disappearing and was not attentive. I can understand efficiency... but neglect is unacceptable.  And finally, the coup de grace:  We were accommodated with running separate checks...the waiter made a mistake because one of the guests in our party placed an a la carte order of similar items as another guest.  Understandable.  When we asked him about it, first he said that we were wrong...when our guest pointed out that the soup was part of the prixe fixe, he said to him, OH! I'm sorry....well then he owes YOU $5 dollars.   My mouth dropped.  I asked him : ""Can you please reverse the transaction""  He said ""No, I can't""  I said ""really?  You can't?  ARe you sure?""  and then He saw that I was serious and said ""Oh wait, actually yes I can, yes I can""  then my guests got tired and said, nevermind, we'll take care of it.   atrocious.

We got there about a half hour early and asked for a window seat (who wouldn't). They said it would be another 45 minutes (we were 30 minutes early already, so no big deal).... We went to the 96th bar area to have a drink first. Drinks are pricey, which we expected. I got the classic mojito which was about $16. I'm okay with the price, but was disappointed that the drink was really not that strong (i'm a 5'2, 140lb female)... at least make it worth my wild! We finally went back down to the hostess right at 7p to check-in one more time, they ended up adding another 25 minutes to our original table wait time. I was a little bummed because I would think if you make your reservation so far in advance, they would keep the window seating open to those being so proactive.... The hostesses were not very customer service oriented either (never really smiled or made good eye contact) - kind of weird for a supposedly ""upscale"" place. We finally sat down. Our view was amazing - beautiful Navy Pier pictures were taken. I got the lobster bisque, which was incredible and the lamb (perfect medium rare) and the whipped potatos (yummy!). Besides food, the service was also excellent (props to Javier). I think he was excited to be serving people who were actually from Chicago for a change.... A reason I'm not blown away was the fact that when we were sitting, people kept coming up behind my boyfriend and I to take pictures and selfies out the window while we were sitting down for dinner....It was very distracting, rude, and just kind of awkward. I'm not talking like 1 or 2 people... there was literally groups after groups of people... One of the hostesses would pull people away (only if you were not actually getting dinner on that floor, just drinks from the one above), but if they did have a dinner reservation they were more then welcome to roam where ever and take pictures. Super annoying. At one point, we tried getting up to finally leave, and both of us couldn't because people were standing right behind us towering over.....You think they would be more mindful of people disrupting people and maybe at least put up a sign or something....

2015-06-15,5.0,"Where do I even begin. After having been born and raised in Chicago, it took me 23 years to finally visit the Signature Room and what a fantastic experience it was! My boyfriend and I celebrated our 5 year anniversary here and it was perfection from beginning to end. He placed a reservation for 5pm which was perfect since we scored window seating with a great view before the dinner rush! Aside from the amazing view, the food was remarkable. We got the Shrimp and grits appetizer with about 5 or 6 pieces of shrimp and I believe they should really consider having this as an entrée because the shrimp had great flavor and the grits complimented them just fabulously.  For entrées I got the seafood linguine and my bf got the surf and turf dish.  He has never eaten lobster before and he had it for the first time here and loved it. He is a steak guy and he really enjoyed his steak that came with the dish! My linguine was awesome seeing as how I got more of the amazing shrimp and some scallops too! So many good things happening in these dishes people! Woo! We also got a side of potato croquettes which were so good seeing as how I love potatoes,  we just had to have a side of those. For drinks, I had a piña colada which I really liked so go for it! Unfortunately,  we didn't have room for dessert, but we will surely return for that chocolate mousse cake! ;) Lastly, take pictures!

2015-06-06,1.0,I RSVP'd our table over a month ago for our anniversary and I was extremely disappointed. The wait staff (not receptionist) was the best part of my experience there. We  first got seated in a table that was just in the middle of chaos then they seated us in a place that I felt squeezed in and far away from the view. It was stuff and smelled like sweat. I wanted to leave but decided to stay because I was convinced that we would also get something special for anniversary (I can't believe I still had hope). The couple seated next to us got a treat so I was excited for ours (I indicated that in my RSVP) but instead got the dessert menu and that's when I was soooo done with that place. Definitely over priced. As we were leaving other people were smarter than me and left right after being seated. Then to top it off you get sardined in the elevator with strict rules and how to stand in the elevator. It was a mess. Save your self that money.

2015-05-29,2.0,"Obviously, the view is incredible.  I went around 7:30ish on a Thursday and there was no line - which was great! After a few minutes wait once we got to the floor, we were able to sit right by a window and watch the sunset. Which was beautiful.  That's where the enjoyable experience ended.  The service is actually horrible. I was extremely disappointed. My uncle was in town - a first timer in Chicago - and I was so excited to show him this spot. However I was embarrassed by how rude all the staff was, how un-attentive they were and how they actually did not care that we were upset. We got drinks and an app at the lounge. We ordered the Raw Bar (you dont even need to cook it) and it took over an hour to come. The drinks took at least 20 minutes. The waitress stopped by infrequently to the point we had to flag her down numerous times. She was very rude and seemed like she did not care that we were unhappy.  After drinks, we were so famished that we (now regrettably) went downstairs to the restaurant for dinner. Thinking that it was 9:30 pm on a Thursday, we wouldn't have a problem. The rude hostess said it would be about 20 minutes to sit. When we pointed out the many open tables we saw, she called over a manager and he was the only helpful person in the whole place. He took us to one of the best seats along the window with no problem.  We ordered right away, because at this point we were famished. The food, again, took over an hour and the waiter did not care whatsoever that we were not happy. The food was sub-par.  I understand that this is a place where you take your time and enjoy the view, but this was excessive. When we told them we were in a rush and already had a poor experience, they did not care to help at all.  Unfortunately, this place is only good for the view.

2015-05-28,4.0,"Of course the views are spectacular - you will not be disappointed at all.  Yes this is a tourist thing to do but I saw several complaints about the food, really I think it's very good.  The best I've ever had, no, but a solid very good.  You truly do come to enjoy the views.  I suggest going at sunset because you really see the transition with all the city and navy pier lights coming on so the view changes every couple minutes, it's pretty amazing.  We were snapping many photos.  Also we were lucky (by chance) to view the *FIREWORKS!!* from navy pier at 10:15 (WEDNESDAYS AND SATURDAYS THROUGHOUT SUMMER--check navy pier online)  They do not rush you so we took a good three hours just to linger for the fireworks.   *TIP* Make a reservation!!!!  I did so three weeks in advance.  They were wonderful about asking who in line has reservations right upon us walking in and we got escorted right up past everyone else in line.  EXPECT LONG LINES - just for people going to the lounge/observation room.  ESP. ON WEEKENDS.  Also, be aware, YOU CANNOT RESERVE/REQUEST A WINDOW SEAT.  Honestly I think either, we got lucky, or I think stating that it was our anniversary got us put on a special list (??  I have no proof of this but they do ask when I called if it is a special occasion)...  Also I think of note to mention is beware that they PACK THE ELEVATORS.  Since it's a bit of a long ride up, they stuff you in there like sardines so get the most people in.  The ride is fast and your ears pop!  It's crazy.  But I mention this because if you are prone to claustrophobia or have a fear of elevators, I don't know how you'll make it.  There's probably a good 20 people in there and I noticed several people looked uncomfortable or almost sick.   Oh, and beware IT IS FREEZING!  Esp. with a window seat, there are vents below and above you.  Even my boyfriend was cold.  I noted several men donning their suit jackets on their ladies.  I am thankful I brought a scarf but really, it was downright COLD.  This was after a 75 degree day too.  It felt like 50 degrees in there, seriously. As for food - We started with the lobster bisque and artichoke soup.  My BF loved the lobster bisque (one of the best he said) and I thought the artichoke was unique, you really have to love artichokes though as the flavor is a tad overwhelming.  The crispy chorizo saved it by giving it some additional taste. We both got the standard filets, served with a wine reduction sauce.  It comes with steamed green beans.  As sides we got the fingerling potatoes, shitito (?) peppers with sesame seeds (bland) and roasted broccoli with feta (my favorite side).  The steaks were, as I mentioned, a solid good.  My only complaint was all the food overall was not HOT.  But this is my pet peeve I like food served HOT HOT.  For dessert I got the classic crème brulee which I was surprised was cold, not warm.  But the toasted marshmallows on top were a different twist compared to the regular fruit. The wine was good, they have as expected a nice variety of options. The service was nice, nothing special but as I mentioned previously, they never rushed us.  I think for a window seat they would but we never felt that.  This is a very couple-y romantic place and I liked that everyone, seriously everyone, dressed the part.  Much better to overdress than underdress here.  If you have something special, wear it here.",0.9991,0.731,0.22,0.05,0.5712878349720455
2015-05-28,3.0,"I am rating this a 3 instead of a 2 which I originally would have rated, due to our great waiter whom I believe was named Bob. My fiance and I were visiting for the weekend and he booked a table here to celebrate my birthday this past Sunday. When making he reservations, he informed them that it was my birthday and also requested a table by the windows for the view. Upon arriving, there was a long line which we did not have to wait in, and we got in the elevator and went straight up. We waited a few minutes to be seated. I could see that there was a table by the window which was being cleared off, and also a tiny 2 person table near the hostess stand (by the wine cellar) and totally away from the window. A man escorted us to our table, which ended up being the tiny table near the cellar with no view. It was cramped and uncomfortable. My fiancé asked the man if we could move tables when a table cleared up, to which he replied no, and that it is first come first serve. We were completely unhappy with the table, especially since the only reason we chose to eat here was for the view. When the other table near the window was cleared, my fiancé went to the hostess stand to see if we could switch tables (we had not ordered any food or drinks at this point). The hostess did not make any sense and appeared to be totally incompetent in responding to this request. She told him no, and that ""once you are seated you cannot move, the kitchen closes at 10, and that if we asked before we sat we could have moved but they cannot move us now, because of the food"".  My fiancé told her we had not ordered anything yet, but she did not understand or want to be helpful. She stopped responding to him, and walked away abruptly leaving him standing there shocked and speechless. We wanted to leave at this point but we did not know if we would be able to get reservations at another restaurant, so we stayed. More tables were leaving and there were about 4 empty tables near the windows. We were completely unhappy, the appetizers and drinks were mediocre at best. Eventually, our awesome waiter saved the night right before our entrees came out and allowed us to move to one of the many empty tables near the window. Without him, our night would have been ruined. The food was not great, and barely decent. If you are looking for a great meal, look elsewhere. You are paying for the view here. That being said, the view was absolutely gorgeous and so beautiful.

Yes, the food is a bit overpriced but at least I'm getting a meal out of it instead of just paying for the view. The food is tasty (and safe) and the service is on point - this is clearly a great place to go for a special occasion or if you are visiting.  TIP: Arrive before the dinner crowd at 6:30pm. Food: 3/5 Appetizer: Ahi Tuna, Main: Lobster tails, Scallops, Sides: Potato croquettes, roasted potatoes Dessert: Cheesecake  Everything was tasty and prepared well, the standouts were the lobster tails and the potato croquettes. The lobster was cooked in butter and was a large generous portion, meat was perfectly cooked giving it that melt-in-your-mouth texture. The potato croquettes were fluffy on the inside and crunchy on the outside. However, I thought the scallops and the roasted potatoes were a bit salty. Service: 4/5 The staff really did their best to make us feel welcome, even helping us take photos. They tried to get to know us better and even customized our cheesecake dessert with the Dutch and American flag. It was super sweet!  Atmosphere: 5/5 I felt sort of bad because we were under-dressed (we had just gotten off an 8 hour flight) but they let us in anyway. This is a fancy schmancy place (seriously!). The view is absolutely breathtaking, and if you don't get a window seat (or the 2nd row near the windows), it really isn't worth your time.

2015-05-23,4.0,"My husband and I are moving back to my hometown and decided that doing brunch at the Signature Room would be our last ""tourist"" treat before we head out.  Positives first. Great views, of course. We hit it on a clear and sunny day. The food is respectable and we believe that the price point is reasonable. $45 per adult for a brunch buffet in an upscale place like the Signature Room is fair enough. You'd probably pay about the same for a brunch buffet at any other place that has no view. The breads and chilled seafood and salads were all attractively displayed. In addition to the chilled food, you could also order any entree off the menu, and you are not limited to one. My husband order the steak and egg as well as the pork tenderloin. I got the Eggs Benedict with crab meat. All three plates were good. I ordered a mimosa, which turned out to be complimentary, for some reason. I am not sure why, but I appreciated the generous gesture. Our server, DaLarian, was attentive but not over-bearing. Also, just as a note, there was a lady at the table right next to us who ordered an entree that came out right as she was sitting down with her plate of chilled food. DaLarian came over and apologized for how quickly the entree came out and said he would take it back to the kitchen to keep warm while she finished her chilled food. I thought that was very accommodating and pro-active on his part. Overall, we had a good experience.  I do have to note, however, one negative thing. None of the hostesses showed any positivity toward any of the customers who were checking in for the brunch. There was no warmth, no smile; no indication that they were remotely happy to be there. I felt like I was imposing on them. In my opinion, at any restaurant, especially someplace that's considered upscale, first impressions are always important. Having dead-pan hostesses made me wonder if the whole staff was that way. Thankfully, they are not. I am assuming that none of the ladies were having that bad a morning because they were smiling and laughing with their colleagues. I have nothing against workplace friendships, but when you are cold towards customers, I think it gets things off on the wrong foot.  But, if you can get over that, you'll enjoy your experience. I was able to let it go and I enjoyed myself. I just felt it had to be noted.",0.9943,0.754,0.179,0.067,0.49881897203325776

I met my date and he suprised me with dinner plans at the Signature room. I thought we were doing, Cheesecake Factory. He wanted to celebrate a promotion he received with me.

I explained that I wanted to bring out a piece of dessert or if they had a whole cake that would be awesome.  Usually, when you come to Signature Room, when wanting one of their cakes, you need to have rsvp and give them advanced notice. Def. Understand that. However, my waiter went n checked and said, he had a cake and I asked him to bill me for it. He said no issue and asked if I wanted a candle n after dinner. I SAID YES. Went back to date.  We finished our appetizers, dinner and talk was REALLY good. Everything seem to go okay until thr waiter came with the bill. I gave him a look and took my date by the hand n said Im so proud of you for getting your promotion, we need to celebrate. The waiter said, yes congrats on your promotion.

(I believe)      Let me tell you, It was perfect timing we got to see a sunny Chicago and as the night went on got to witness a gorgeous sunset. Romantic and beautiful. Lighting inside is a little dim a little more than candle light really which I liked, just a point.     Food was excellent both of us had a steak.

Good wine selection although we both opted for beer (I'm from the Southside of Chicago anyways) expect to pay about 45-55 dollars per steak. Usual for an upscale place like this and well worth it. Desserts are limited but seem to be enough options for everyone. We ordered the dark and white chocolate mousse and split it. good enough for two people.       The view.

Food: We ordered the calamari (Luisa convinced us), it was super delicious, fresh and crispy, comparable to something you'd find at Fisherman's Wharf in SF. I had the roasted salmon fillet. The salmon was good, but the best part of the entree was the creamy risotto, don't know what they added to it, but I would've paid the price of my entree just for a bowl of the risotto.

The brunch ""starters"" are served buffet style.  Those include breads, cheeses, meats, fruit, cold salads, made-to-order omelettes, shrimp, crab legs, etc.  Once you've had your full of those items, you place your entree order with the server.  You may order one entree, or several entrees.  If you're still hungry after eating, or if you don't care for what you ordered, order something different!  When you have finally had enough of the savory, it's time for dessert.  Once again, this is served buffet style.   Our server was efficient and charming.  Service was fast, and the buffet lines moved as well as could be expected.  The food is upscale buffet food.  It will wow some people and not impress others.  Most people go for the view, and the food is secondary.  Overall, for $45 per person, both my husband and I agreed we would probably do this again on our next trip to Chicago.

We were seated at a table next to the window and had a side view of Navy Pier, but the minute we sat down we noticed a heavy breeze from the bottom and top vents shooting right on us.  5 minutes into our evening, the waiter brought over a pashmina from the back for me to cover up because there was absolutely nothing they were able to do regarding the air. I was a bit hesitant to use it, but there was no way that I could have lasted through dinner with the cold.  Something that was supposed to be quiet and romantic turned into an obnoxious environment. I think they have the lounge above the restaurant and it was so loud with people yelling at each other that it became very uncomfortable for the people actually dining.  We decided to start the evening with a bottle of red merlot and the romaine salad. For main course, my date ordered their special surf and turf, and I ordered the scallops. I was a bit taken back when my meal showed up at the table before even having a chance to finish my salad and clearing the table for us. 5 minutes later, my date received his dinner. I love scallops, and they were just ok. I have to say that I have never had my scallops topped with popcorn before. I am not one to not finish off my plate, but I had to force myself to eat 2 scallops and the rest I got rid of. It was not my thing to be honest. We ordered the creme brulle  and that was ok. I wished they topped it off with some fresh fruit instead of just throwing some whip cream on top, but ehh.. One would think that a high end restaurant like this one would be organized and on top of their game.  Overall, my experience was just ok.

Sounds like a great idea even though I figured the views may be slightly more restricted. Well, I would advise against the signature room. The views were far more limited then I expected with city views only if you are lucky and by chance go to that bar/lounge on your visit. However, you are not free to roam the various bar areas or you will be met by very rude wait staff admonishing you to find a host. We ordered the Mediterranean appetizer plate. Toasted pita which was more akin to walmart brand pita pulled straight from the plastic baggie sans toasting. The most bland ""hummus"" I've ever experienced. The feta cheese was passable. Our server was rather apathetic and offered mediocre service.

I've eaten at a lot of nice places around the world and this certainly had a stunning view, however I can't recall having worse service.

We were fortunate to get a table one set in from the windows so we had a good spot, but otherwise this wasn't one of the most outstanding meals I've had - the food was, in summary, kinda bland. Our server seemed like he would be attentive and then promptly stopped paying as much attention ... We could have given our tip to the bus boy lol. Ordered a $24 glass of champagne that had approximately 2 bubbles left in it but by the time we would have gotten attention I would have been thirsty. For that price, they should get a better bottle sealer or be more discriminating when pouring by the glass. Appetizers - pork belly and beet salad were both good but not exceptional. Toasted barley with the pork belly was flavorless. Beet salad came with a smear of dressing underneath which was hardly enough to even dress the leaves lightly. Highlight was the set of goat cheese balls that came with the salad. For entrees, we did strip steak and the duck. Steak was good, duck was okay - asked for medium rare and it came out much closer to medium than I prefer. The flavoring was hardly anything to write home with - someone was very light on their seasoning in the kitchen because the duck definitely needed something else. Didn't stay for dessert ...  Overall, go for the views but this place is super busy and staff were on the hustle ... I guess if you tell them it's a special occasion they will be more attentive but I have been to far better places.

I'd rather get a window seat and wait then a seat I didn't want at all. So we went to the lounge area. Which was pretty cool! After about 45 minutes we were called to our table. When we got to our table we sat there for a good 5 minutes until someone showed up to give us water and some bread. I was really thirsty, and I'm not sure why it took so long. When our server finally got to the table, he didn't really smile and you could tell he was a little stressed out, and because I worry about other people more than myself, I almost wanted him to sit down and have another server serve us. Anyways, the food was pretty good, but a little pricey. I also really enjoyed the wine! When the bill was presented I didn't even get a ""Happy Birthday"" or a happy birthday cake..

2015-03-14,1.0,"So you'd think being up on the 95th floor with a panoramic view of downtown Chicago would lend itself to a great, classy dinner, right? Think again. If you're one of the guests lucky enough to snag a table by the window, I'm sure this could be a genuinely unique dining experience. If you're anyone else -- seated at one of the unsettlingly numerous interior tables that they cram in to maximize nightly revenue -- the Signature Room feels more like the dining room on a cruise ship (and not a particularly nice one either; think Carnival tier and below).  Pro-tip for the management: keeping your restaurant almost laughably dark doesn't do a whole lot to enhance the elegance of the experience when it's otherwise so crowded and noisy that I had flashbacks to my high school cafeteria. It will, however, successfully obscure the label on a bottle of wine 30% more expensive than the one your customers actually ordered, leaving them not-so-pleasantly surprised when the check arrives. (To be fair, I'm sure the wait staff would've taken care of this had I mustered the energy to dispute my check; by that point I was so underwhelmed by the whole experience that I took the path of least resistance and just paid and left.) The food is fine, though there are probably three or four dozen much better and more cost-effective culinary options within a mile. One unmitigated positive was the ample amount of dinner rolls that they throw at you. We're talking bread with salads, bread with dinner, bread just for the hell of it, filling-up-your-bread-plate-more-often-than-they-refill-your-water insanity. So if you're looking for a good place to carb up for $90 per person, I can't imagine anywhere better.

The next day, I received a call from the reservation agent explaining that because we planned not to order a dinner entree, they couldn't accommodate our request.  I was instructed that we could have dessert at their bar, but 1) we don't drink for religious reasons and didn't want to be around alcohol, 2) we wanted a nice quiet evening - not at a loud, crowded bar, and 3) there are no desserts on their bar menu. I asked to speak to the manager, and explained our situation.  I said that if it was a matter of wanting to make sure they got their money's worth for our table - we could order appetizers, a couple desserts, coffees, and even pay extra if need be - which would surely amount to the cost of an entree.  But she refused. I even further protested that they couldn't possibly have a full dining room for dinner at 10:00 or 11:00 pm, but she told me that in fact - their dining room was full at those times even that very night.  That's funny, because their website indicates they do have tables available. Needless to say, I will not be recommending this restaurant to anyone I know.  And for the record - no restaurant that I have ever been to in Chicago has this discriminatory practice (even the Michelin-rated restaurants have a ""minimum order"" requirement, not an entree requirement).",0.8447,0.882,0.073,0.045,0.5315656565656567

In fact, it was pretty mediocre. Our waitress was pretty nice. But, some of the seating staff look like they really DON'T want to be there. That was a bit tough to deal with.

2014-12-12,4.0,"My precious bf took me to The Signature Room for our one year anniversary of dating this week. I will say, the folks at sig room definitely pull out all the stops to ensure you have a wonderful experience if you are celebrating a special occasion. As we walked up to our beautiful window seat table, there was a bottle of chilled champagne and a single red rose on my seat. Ok tear, how cute! On top of this, when I opened the menu, it said Happy 1 Year! Feeling so loved and special we decided to order some food.... For the appetizer, we went with the Chili Rubbed Shrimp which was very fresh and hearty...usually shrimp apps leave much to be desired but these were very flavorful. For my main, I chose the scallops...best decision! They were so filling and the fact that they were topped with popcorn and rested on a bed of cheese grits gave it such a unique taste! I ABSOLUTELY recommend these scallops...some of the best I've had for sure. My man went with the beef filet. It was EH. If you are jonesing for a steak then I would definitely recommend one of the many fabulous Chicago steakhouses. This was one of the rare cases where the seafood option actually had more flavor than the beef. Meh. Step it up siggy room, people expect a lot from you! Oh I almost forgot, the ADORABLE baby potato croquettes we order for a side! Like little baby mashed potato eggs, breaded and deep fried...heaven at last. I only wish there were more than 2 to the order. The dessert menu is HUGE...hard to pick just one, but we finally decided on the vanilla creme brûlée. This was a creamy delicious masterpiece. Definitely recommend. Oh and did I mention it came with a candle and said happy anniversary on the plate? Again, totally adorbs! All in all, we had a fabulous time celebrating our special night at the Signature Room. I will say, why they do offer all of these fun add-ons to make your night so nice, the wait staff is sort of rude. I had to literally break it down to Javier that it was our anniversary and I wanted him to smile! Other than that, a great night was had! :)",0.9991,0.694,0.289,0.017,0.6356269841269843
2014-12-12,3.0,"This was an extremely disappointing experience. I brought my girlfriend here on a Friday night to start a birthday weekend off right. Or at least I thought I would.... When you first get to the elevator to go up to the 95th floor you cannot help but get excited that you're going to a restaurant to overlook all of downtown. You're greeted immediately when you exit the elevator, maybe because you're forced right into the hostess stand, but that is always a plus. Since we went in the beginning of December, they ask you to check your coats at coat check and low and behold it cost you a $1 per coat. I know, I know, its just a $1 but if you're paying $45 for a steak, they can afford complimentary coat check. We were lucky enough to get a table on the South side right on the windows. Even though it was a bit cloudy, this is the biggest reason we gave three stars and not two. We were again greeted quickly by our waiter, so at this time we still ecstatic to be there and had 5 stars on the table. Being a higher scale restaurant you assume everything would be expensive on the menu but also would assume a knowledgable staff and just plain delicious ass food would be accompanied by the prices.  We started off with a couple of their $15.50 cocktails and the Duck Trio appetizer. Mainly because we're suckers for foie gras but this is when the stars started to fade away. Our waiter brings us the wrong cocktails to start but we just laughed it off. When the duck trio came to our table a gentleman placed it on the table and walked away. We know the trio had crispy duck thighs, foie gras, and duck rillete, but again for the quality and price you'd think the waiter would come over and explain the 3 types on your plate and ask if we had any questions. Instead, I had to ask him to come over. When I asked him about the disk he said ""This is your Duck Trio"" well thank you sir I had nooooo idea thats what this way. I tried to ask if he could tell me a little about it and all he could muster up was ""thats part of the duck"" (while pointing at the thigh). We accepted his incompetent knowledge of the dish and ate it. We did enjoy it so no real complaints about that. While we were eating our duck we ordered the lobster bisque and our entrees, the Seafood Linguine ($40) and New York Strip Steak ($43). The second we were done eating our appetizer a member of the wait staff snagged it up and someone right behind them put down our soups. We give them credit for being fast but we like to breathe every once in awhile. The soup was on point and we both enjoyed that as well. Again, the second we put down our spoons to just breathe, talk, and enjoy our surroundings we were rolled into the entree. Almost as if the food was sitting in the kitchen under a heat lamp just waiting for us to finish our soup. How dare us take our time to eat! At this point we felt like we were being rushed to make room for the dinner rush.  Since the food was quite delicious up to this point we were pretty excited to eat our entrees. I dove right into my medium rare steak with excitement and when I took a look inside I was as disappointed as finding out Santa Claus was a fake. I still just will never understand how a restaurant can charge $40+ for a steak and then cannot deliver the properly ordered temperature of the steak. The steak was closer to medium well than medium rare and was o so deliciously chewy, NOT. I'm always against the people who send their food back but I guess I need to start doing it with at least my steaks. My girlfriend's food looked pretty good but again was deceiving. Her shrimp were burnt and the linguine was mushy. They never asked her if she wanted any parmesan or fresh cracked pepper and didn't even give her a spoon! Yea, she is Italian so eating linguine without a spoon is like eating lobster with a bib. Neither of us were able to actually finish our meals so we had to call over a waiter after a few minutes to take our plates. I guess their cue is empty plates and then they go to work. We mutually agreed to not get dessert but since everything more inexpensive was better than the pricy we probably should have. Next time I guess, well no, we won't be going back. All in all, it was OK but I don't recommend going for dinner, especially when you're paying $200. Maybe their lunch is better? If not, they do have their Signature Lounge one floor up for cocktails only.",0.9969,0.81,0.13,0.059,0.5223762569000664
2014-12-10,4.0,"After reading Yelp reviews I definitely had low expectations which were greatly exceeded.  I guess it's true that it's mostly the unhappy customers who leave reviews.   My biggest complaint is that no one informed us of the coat check so we all just placed our bulky winter coats over our chairs, as other diners had done.  At one point our friend stood up and his coat's weight caused his chair to fall, hitting another diner's chair.  So classy.  When I visited the bathroom I walked past the darn coat-check!  We went for dinner on a Wednesday in November, got a window table, and wait staff were attentive, polite, and knew some Spanish which helped out our friends.  All drinks including water were kept filled or checked on.  Key factor for me: yes they replace the cutlery when clearing the table after the appetizers.   Absolutely, the prices are really high, but the food was good and the portions were not tiny.  I don't think anyone brings home leftovers from the Signature Room, but portion size was not a problem.    As a group of 4 we did have three apps: Duck Trio, Octopus, and Chili Shrimp.  All were well-liked.  My main was almost but not quite amazing; my Barramundi was delicious, but a few bites had no flavor to them at all.  The other three each got the Rack of Lamb and loved it.   We also got dessert, my Creme Brulee was great.  Others got the Tiramisu, Cobbler and Ice Cream.   I don't need to go again for a good long time, I'd like to try out other restaurants instead.  But I'm not afraid of bad food, bad service or tiny portions at the Signature Room anymore.",0.9896,0.795,0.158,0.048,0.5947395833333334

My mom seemed to enjoy her soup as well. For our entrees, I ordered the vegetable linguini, which was a bit spicy for my taste, and mom ordered the crab cake which she said was perfect. The portion sizes were perfect for lunch and the view is breathtaking.  The only downside to this dining experience was the waitstaff. It seemed as if they were short staffed so our waiter was very hard to find at times, and at the end of the meal it took a while to find him so we could pay our bill.

The operator then proceeded to manually close the doors because they were not functioning properly. Safety standards???? Seating: Decent table one row away from the window. Nothing out of the ordinary here. Food: We ordered the salmon and the ribeye.  The salmon was cooked well and the parmesan risotto was delicious, but the portion size was very small for a $33 plate. The $59 ribeye was a massive failure.  It was unevenly cooked so that parts were almost raw when other parts were almost well done.  I asked for it medium rare.  The meat itself was rather tough and chewy with numerous sinews making it very hard to cut or chew. Ribeye is meant to be marbled, but this ribeye was 50% fat. I spent most of the meal dissecting it into tiny chunks that were actually edible. On top of that, the seasoning and flavors were extremely subpar. The tomato relish was bitter and clashed with the normally savory cut of meat. I might as well just buy a ribeye from Walmart and cook it with a blowtorch! Service: The secondary waitstaff was extremely kind and attentive, but our primary waiter was rather abrupt. I wouldn't go so far as to say he was rude, but he clearly did not care if we were having a satisfactory experience. The words ""cold"" and ""disinterested"" come to mind.

The view is truly very nice, especially on a clear day, and the service was great for the most part. The hostess was kind of snippy, but our waiter was very accommodating and made our meal there very pleasant. So if you go with more than four people, you can't get a table by the window. We were seated at a round table for 8, but we still had a nice view of the window. However, it was pretty much impossible for us to snap pictures with (or of) the view without seeming really rude. So keep that in mind. Also if you make a reservation here and you happen to be late, you lose your reservation and you have to pay 20 bucks per person (?!?!) which I found to be kind of ridiculous. We wound up going without a reservation early during their lunch hours and were seated before the rush. Hm... the food... we ordered 2 portions of calamari to start with, which was honestly fine but not amazing. For entrees, I had the baby lamp chops with tomato/chick pea/raisin chutney and wilted greens, which was honestly just okay. The meat wasn't cooked the way I wanted it to be (medium rare) but for the most part it leaned towards medium. There was one lamb chop that seemed to be medium well (I kept cutting into it and it didn't get pink until near the bone), so for $18 that was kind of a disappointment. My friends also had the steak, which looked pretty good (but the piece of meat is on the smaller side) and the veggie linguine with chicken (which is SIX BUCKS they were surprised when the bill came because our waiter didn't tell us that).  Our total bill came out to be $250 for 8 people (tax/tip was something like $35), and honestly I don't think any of us would go there again just because the food was so average and expensive.

It's much more reasonably priced which means you're less likely to be disappointed when you realized it's just regular food served on the 95th floor. However, the views are spectacular when the weather is nice. I would chose to have dinner or lunch here instead of going to the observation deck. The price of going to the observation deck is least half of what a decent meal would cost so you may as well get a meal and a more exclusive experience in the restaurant.",0.6697,0.892,0.082,0.026,0.5522435897435899

2014-09-28,5.0,"This place definitely is a ""signature"" of Chicago in my opinion.  I was refraining from going there because it seemed to be a touristy thing to do.  Well, that has changed.  We went there for Sunday brunch with a reservation to celebrate hubby's birthday the day prior.  I highly recommend you to make a reservation because you're more likely getting the window seating, since it's assigned by first come, first serve basis.  Honestly, I didn't have much expectation at all because I know I'm here for the view and experience.  However, the food was really top-notch.  I have lots of positive things to say, so I'm gonna break it down in bullet points. 1) it's $45/person.  Sounds expensive, right?  Well, I think it's worth every penny.  Other than the buffet station that features snow crab legs, cocktail shrimp, smoked salmon, gourmet cheese, and made-to-order omelette, you can order the entrees that is made in the kitchen.  You can order more than one.  Afterwards, there's dessert available.  Ok, now you get the picture.   2) we ordered the eggs Benedict, eggs & steak, and seared barrimundi (a type of fish originating in Australia/southeast Asia).  The poached eggs were pure perfection; the steak was legitimately 100 percent medium; the fish was the best I've had for a long time.  I believe you've got your money worth right there. 3) AYCE snow crab legs, smoked salmon, and cocktail shrimp...I can't say enough.  The quality was excellent, especially they were served in a buffet style.  Every bit of them was a blessing from God.  Ok, no more corniness.  Let's move on! 4) the service is attentive without overly disturbing to our enjoyment.  Both Victor and Damien were great.  We were taking our time to take in all the aerial beauty that Chicago offers.  They for sure understood that. You would starve myself for a week in order to save money to come here.  That's a compliment.  It considers this as money well spent.  Don't argue with me because I'm so right.   Farewell, until next time...",0.9962,0.793,0.194,0.014,0.5016768066768068

2014-09-23,4.0,"A great dinner with BEAUTIFUL views. So, my mom lived in Chicago for 20 years and always dreamed of fine dining at the John Hancock. Never could afford it back then during the struggles of being a new immigrant. Considering the occasion, I decided to take her, and two of our family members who we met up with here for dinner. Perfect timing to come in I think. Made a reservation on Yelp through Open Table (which was a great idea), and made it a few days prior to coming in. I made the reservation for Wednesday at 6:30pm but we came in early (about 5:45) because we weren't sure about parking or how to get there. Parked in the actual parking structure. We came from the Pier, and we weren't dressed the best, but I looked it up and we still met the dress code for dinner. Just wanted to make sure we didn't get turned away.  Once in the building there were signs leading you toward the elevators up to the Signature Room, then there were a few people who directed you toward a line to the elevators. Once we got there, we were seated immediately, and at the time we arrived, there weren't many people dining yet (since I think they open again at 5pm), and we were seated by the window! I didn't even have to ask even though I was going to request it.  The time we spent there was perfect considering we were able to see the city of Chicago with the sun still up, at sunset, and then with all the city lights on! PERFECT! I had the best pictures. I spent most of my time staring outside the window. I could take perfect pictures from where I was sitting.  Our server was Jim, and I won't ever forget it because my uncle kept addressing him by his name. He was very personable and patient. He made recommendations on the wine and food. OH, there's a requirement for all patrons to order one entree, and my uncle apparently didn't see that, but Jim made it known to him after he made his order. However, Jim gave his an exception and let him order whatever he wanted to order instead of getting a full entree. That was nice of him.  I had a Pinot Noir with my Rack of Lam. The lamb was super tasty, never had lamb before. So tender! My mom actually almost convinced me not to order it, but once she tried it, she was glad I did! My uncle had a few glasses of it with his food. My aunty had a glass of white wine (don't remember the name, it was so fancy). She ordered the Lobster Bisque and Roasted Amish Chicken, no complaints! My mom had the New York Steak, which she did not finish because she was full from her salad, but she finished the rest when we arrived at our hotel. She said it was so tender.  Considering all we did at that day was eat, I was so full. BUT, we finished off with 2 scoops strawberry ice cream and my uncle had an expresso. In all that time, we were able to appreciate the views all the way til sun down. Just perfect timing. The people who started coming in just wished they had our seats. And it wasn't that we were prolonging our dinner, that's just the timing it took to finish our dinner!  There were a few men who came in around dinner time, I'm not sure if they were seated somewhere else at the restaurant or were upstairs at the lounge but they were spending a few minutes taking pictures of the views near the windows where we were seated. Soon they were scolded (nicely) by the staff and were told to take their seats. I guess if you wanted the freedom to take pictures like they were, you should go to the observatory. I didn't think they were being a disturbance though.  Anyways, there was a man who filled up our ""still"" waters (can't remember his name) but he had an accent (either Spanish or Italian) and he was so friendly. I don't experience fine dining often but whenever you got out of your seat, he would fold your lap napkin nicely before you came back.  Our bill came out to less than $300, and of course it was my treat. How often do you get to have a window seat dinner with amazing views on the 95th floor of the John Hancock building in Chicago?!  Parking had no validation though. Came out to $44. My uncle paid that.  All in all, it was a good time. Perfect weather and perfect views. Great service and dinner. If you wanna see the views from up high in Chicago, but want to have a fancy dinner at the John Hancock as well, and you're only in Chicago for a few days...do what I did! Dinner at The Signature Room from 5:45-7pm-ish, and then enjoy more daytime views at Willis Tower freely at the Skydeck on another day! I looked up having dinner at Willis Tower, and I don't think they have something like The Signature Room.",0.9984,0.84,0.128,0.033,0.5214623850444746

If you're going to eat and you're wanting to experience the views I highly recommend merging the two and just heading here.  We came to the Signature Room on a Sunday for brunch and made reservations ahead of time for 10 am. When you arrive you head towards an elevator that takes you up to the restaurant. We arrived about 15 minutes early and tried heading up to the restaurant but the elevators don't start running until opening time. By the time the restaurant was about to open there was a large group gathered by the elevators, people were confused as to why no one was heading up, everyone kept trying and then would stand in front of the elevators, which made arriving early kind of a waste of time as there was no organization and no one was really being polite enough to be patient and stand in line. Once the employees arrived to bring us up we were lucky enough to be herded into the first elevator up. Once we got up to the restaurant it was great from there! We were seated by a window and had a great server and busser. There was a large buffet table set up with great seafood, an omelette station, a pancake station, bagels, croissants, pastries, and a few salads. We did try a few things on the menu which were all great, but we had to ask for the mimosas which were supposed to be included with brunch and then it took about 20 mins to actually get them. It wasn't really a big deal but it was a little awkward to have to ask. Towards the end of our brunch the staff was nice enough to snap a photo of us with a great background and we now have a great memento of our visit.  Overall I say skip the lines and prices of 360 Chicago and just merge the price into a brunch experience. You won't regret it!   *NOTE: When we walked into the lobby at 9:30 am the lines for 360 Chicago were already long and growing!",0.9924,0.814,0.141,0.045,0.49084733893557403

When making my reservation, they indicated that we would need to make any view requests once we arrived for lunch.  Aware of the rehearsals going on, we arrived an hour before our reservation and requested a window seat.  A few minutes later, my husband went back to the host and specifically requested a north facing window seat.  We were told it would be an hour wait and just waited upstairs at the lounge. Once our table was available, my husband and I promptly went back.  The host (which we found out was the manager later) started lecturing us about how they were waiting for a while for us.  However, our pager only went off a few minutes ago.  The manager then tried to sit us on the South Side.  We quickly told her that was not what we requested and that was unacceptable to us.  She then started arguing with us and trying to sit us somewhere else that was not a north window seat.  We stood our ground and told them nothing except what we asked for, a North window seat was acceptable.  It made no sense for us to make reservations for the same view we would have from our own home.  The manager was awful, rude, and a complete B****.   She then (with an attitude) told us she had no idea how long it would take for us to sit down, another hour perhaps.  Granted we had already been waiting 1.5 hours for a seat.  I confronted her with the fact that that was unacceptable and thanked her for ruining my birthday lunch.  She was able to find us a north facing table but it was not on the window, so we couldn't take pictures and had people standing in front of us.  The Signature Room provide nothing to us, no apologies, nothing to make up for THEIR MISTAKE. The food was okay.  We tried the $20 buffet which was alright.  They did have steak which was not tasty at all.  But the rest of the food was nothing special. I probably will not be heading back for a while given the service and lack of concern the management had there.  They have proven to be unreliable and have zero understanding of customer service.  They may be able to get away with this with tourists but for a local person, there are way better places to go.",-0.978,0.87,0.038,0.092,0.3610827664399093
2014-08-25,5.0,"My boyfriend and I wanted to do something spectacular during our stay in Chicago last week, and on Monday (08/18), we decided to have a late lunch at the Signature Room. The place was virtually empty when we arrived, and everyone we encountered was the epitome of professional, warm, and considerate. Our hostess sat us at a table with a gorgeous view of the city, beachfront, and lake. Our server, Ronald, was especially nice, and accommodated our requests to snap ""candid"" photos of us holding hands at our table. No, those quotes were not meant to be ""ironic"", why do you ask? For our drinks, I ordered a hibiscus margarita (gotta love my girly sweet drinks), while my boyfriend ordered an Old Town old-fashioned (very bitter, but smooth). I was hoping to try the roasted salmon fillet, but Ronald sadly informed me they had run out of salmon, so I decided to get the lunch special for that day: it was penne pasta served with sauteed shrimp and broccoli in a light cream pesto sauce. My boyfriend ordered the roasted chicken, which came with orzo, pearl onions, and carrots. I tried a piece of his chicken and it was cooked perfectly; juicy and tender on the inside with a nice crunchy texture on the outside. My meal was fantastic. The pasta was al dente, the shrimp were cooked well and not chewy or hard, and the texture of the sauce was a delicious blend of herbs and spices.  For dessert, we split the lemon meringue pie, which was, hands-down, the best damn lemon meringue I've ever had, period. I can't describe how good it was. Just go there for lunch, save room for dessert, order this, and be amazed. Or better yet, just get the pie and then ask for more pie when the waiter asks you if there's anything else you want. I swear, it's that good. We left The Signature Room with full stomachs and happy thoughts. If we plan to visit Chicago again in the future (and I don't see why not, ;-p) then we'll definitely come back here for lunch or dinner.",0.9952,0.772,0.179,0.049,0.6028314028314029

We started off with the grilled octopus. It was very flavorful. For dinner the hubs had the seafood linguine. The scallops and the shrimp were huge and tasty. However, the linguine was lacking in sauce. Unfortunately, we agreed we've had better elsewhere. The same with the seared sea scallops I ordered. The scallops were huge which was a major plus and the grits and the summer corn added just the right touch. The scallops were topped with cajun popcorn. The popcorn added an exciting element to the dish, but I thought it was totally unnecessary and didn't add to the dish. We finished up with champagne and creme brule to celebrate. The creme brule was made to perfection. Overall, we had a wonderful, romantic experience.

The view is probably better during the day as you can see the lake. -our waiter was very friendly whenever he served us. The negatives: - the food was less than sub standard. I got the goats cheese and beetroot salad for starters, which wasn't great and is a dish that is easy to get right. The vegetable phyllo for entree was really salty and a bit boring- I didn't even finish it. -the restaurant was really really cold so it was hard to enjoy the meal. We asked the waiter to turn off the blower but he said it wasn't possible and offered a pashmina instead. -the waiter took plates away while others were still eating and never asked how the meal was so it was hard to give comments on the meal. Beautiful restaurant but they need to sort out the food when you're paying this price. Better idea is to eat in the Cheesecake Restaurant on the ground floor and just go for a drink in the bar to soak up the view!

My friend called to let them know an employee had to have stolen it and was met with accusations and dismissiveness by the manager.  For such an expensive restaurant priding themselves on class, this behavior is despicable. There are terrible people everywhere and credit cards are copied/stolen all the time. It understandable and forgivable.

Last minute weekend trip to Chicago and decided to treat ourselves to the great views offered from the 95th and 96th floors of the John Hancock Building. I made a reservation for 1930 on Sunday, the staff was very friendly during the process and followed up 48hrs before our arrival.  We arrived to the John Hancock building around 1900 and followed the signs around the building to the elevator. It was a quick 45 second ride up to the 96th floor where we checked into the front desk. We wanted to ensure we had a window seat and the host warned us that it may take an additional 45 mins from our reservation time. We were in no hurry so we oblidged - we sat down in the lounge and ordered a few drinks. As soon as our drinks arrived, my buzzer went off, right at 1930. To our surprise, they had a table ready for us, initally we wanted to sit on the southside since there was a better view of the city but soon after we sat down, we realized we had a prime spot for the sunset - WIN!  There were three waiters/waitresses that attended to us throughout our dinner. They were very friendly, personable, and attentive. I ordered the roasted rack of lamb with a side of mushrooms and my fiance got the roasted duck with a side the potato croquettes. We also shared a lobster bisque. The food in my opinion was just okay. Nothing special. It didn't shock us at all knowing that the premium prices are largely due to the view this place offers. My lamb was cooked medium the way I asked and tasted great with the mint sauce that accompanied it. My fiances duck was alright- too salty. The bisque was very light, seasoned perfectly. The mushrooms were great with the lamb and so was the croquettes. The croquettes were lightly fried on the outside with the texture of mashed potatoes on the inside.  The two things I enjoyed most were our cocktails and the view. Those two alone will have us coming back, atleast to the lounge area.The moscow mule, palm blanc, and watermelon gimlet were awesome. The latter two were fruitier cocktails but they were not super sweet like some places. I highly recommend checking out the lounge at a minimum if you have a chance, you won't be disappointed! Just know that the cocktails are about $15 and the beers are $8. The food in the lounge are under $25, dinner entrees are between $25-$80. Oh, the lines can get ridiculous, too, especially if you want to sit near the window. If not, there are usually ton of open tables away from the window.

The lunch buffet was highlighted by a flank steak with horseradih sauce, cuts of pork, and pistaschio crusted salmon, with salad bar and soups (black bean or oxtail) as well.  While I enjoyed the salad bar selection, the main servings were lacking for me. The flank steak was underpowering and really needed a dousing of horseradish sauce for flavor for me. It was also very chewy and rough, which I know is a characteristic of a leaner cut, but even so.. The fish and pork were also both fairly average and kind of bland.  In addition, the selection wasnt amazing either. For example, although they offered a fresh fruit+ prosciutto salad, they did not offer any fruit just by itself. Maybe its just me, but it  seems that some sort of lone-standing fresh fruit should be present for any buffet. I thought the oxtail soup was a highlight, and my gf also really enjoyed their selection of salads too. Although the food was quite average, I do think that the signature room is a good value.

We had the salmon and the ribeye as well as the ahi tuna appetizer and my only complaint about the food was that the appetizer was so tiny you could eat it in one bite.  Now on the the real review, when I made the reservation I wanted a window seat since it was our anniversary but was told that no seating preferences were taken until we arrived. Upon arrival we had to wait while several couples (who arrived after us) were seated before us and when we were seated at a non-window seat we asked if we could move to a window seat and were told that we could wait 2 hours more and be seated by the window. Even though I stated that it was our anniversary on the reservation and we had made a specific point to go to the signature room to make it extra special, we felt as if the staff did absolutely nothing to make it feel special. At least be professional and timely with the service, or something of the like, but we didn't even get that. Our server was nowhere to be found most of the time and our orders weren't even taken until we had been seated for over 30 mins. Several tables in our vicinity were getting much better service and that was increasingly frustrated to see. On top of all of that, the wait just to get into the restaurant and then to get seated and then to leave the restaurant was obnoxious. Overall, I felt as if the signature room is banking on getting people in because of the fantastic views and good food but slacks off on other critical areas of food service. It's all in the details and I would think that such a nice restaurant would be well versed in providing quality experiences to their customers.

The food itself was good...Not nothing SPECTACULAR or anything...but given the fact that we were 95 stories up and had the most amazing dinning views I thought that all in all it was well worth the OK food and nice, but not spectacular service from our waiter. It is most def a touristy attraction and restaurant. I believe that after experiencing it for the first time, you won't find yourself dying to rush back for at least the food that is, during your next Chicago trip.  Note to ones self: Arrive early....since it is 95 stories up, the only way to go is by elevator so there is a line. It isnt like a line for individuals getting into a night club to where they are purposely making you wait...it is just they HAVE to...they arent in control of how fast they are able to go up and down so be patient and dont allow it to get your panties in a wad as it did with other snappy reviewers....be logical thinking adults to be able to process that! Make reservations at LEAST a week in advance. Again, i is a touristy restaurant and there are tons of people visiting Chicago for a special event and wanting to utilize the restaurant and its views  Also after a certain time, kids are not allowed up...it is a 21 and over restaurant and lounge and they dont have time to babysit nor would anyone eating a romantic and nice dinner want to hear a screaming baby or whinning kids anxious to leave after waiting so long for a seat who have already become tired of running around in others space. so be aware of that considering how many adults were turned away because they assumed that anyone else eating an expensive dinner wanted to have a daycare next to them as they ate....which is an issue I found to happen personally at other fine dinning  restaurants.",0.9846,0.853,0.107,0.04,0.5713522071149189

We went for a celebration dinner in the evening so it was dark outside but the city was lit up, as usual, with lights...it was beautiful! We could see Willis Tower, The Merchandise Mart, Navy Pier, Trump Tower, and many other buildings and land marks. The food at The Signature Room was good, but I've definitely had better food for less, but of course without the amazing views. I was disappointed at the service by our waiter. After we ordered our entrees we didn't see him again. We actually received amazing service from the gentleman clearing our plates and refilling out drinks. We actually had to ask him to place our order for dessert. Also, when the bill arrived it was for the table next to us and again we had to ask the bus boy to please have our bill corrected. We didn't see out waiter again until he brought our credit card and receipt.

The food is extremely overpriced for what you actually receive, which was disappointing to me. When I built this place up to be one of the best places to go, and essentially paid for the view, it was upsetting. The food was good but the $200.00, and I did not buy a bottle of wine, was not worth it. Not to mention my server seemed to be on auto pilot, and essentially assumed I knew the restaurant and menu. Not informative at all. I also asked him to take a picture for me, which he was happy to do, but clearly didn't care as the picture pretty bad, not that that has anything to do with the rating tho.

2014-06-23,4.0,"Yes, I agree with other reviewers when they say the food really isn't all that special. Would I be willing to drop the ~$300 (with tip) for 4 people just for the food again? NOPE. But I did the math, and I realized that it might be worth it after all. For 4 people, it'll cost close to $80 anyway just to visit the top of the John Hancock, so why not sit, enjoy food/drinks/view, and chat for a couple hours for more money. But I digress. I came here for my graduation dinner with my parents and cousin. Having visited my favorite restaurants in Chicago during the few days beforehand, I figured it'd be nice to end with something more flashy. You get to ride the cool elevator to the 95th floor (wish the elevator in my apartment complex was that fast). When I first got to the top, I was SO disappointed. The view of Chicago was basically fog - I literally could not see anything else (see photos). This was frustrating, because again, you are definitely paying for the view more than the food itself. In fact, ALL persons in a party must order an entree, just a heads up (guessing they don't want people crowding into the restaurant, ordering an appetizer, and sitting for the view). However, as the night progressed, the fog cleared up and I had an absolutely fantastic view for most of the night. We went all out - we ordered three glasses of wine, 2 soups (cream of corn and lobster bisque for $8 each), 4 entrees (two orders of seafood linguine - $40, one order of scallops - $36, and an order of pork chop - $38), and 2 desserts (creme brulee and a white/dark chocolate mousse - $10 each). The soups were okay - I thought the corn chowder was a little too sweet and the lobster bisque a bit too tomato-y, but not bad. I liked how it wasn't too salty. Seafood linguine came with 3 big pieces of shrimp and 3 beautifully seared pieces of scallop, which was nice. The sauce was a big muddled for me, but not bad. The porkchop was also very tender. The entree portions are pretty generously sized (they better be, for the prices), and although the flavors weren't amazing, they were solid. The desserts were decent as well. Overall, I'd give the food a 3 star rating (compared to other restaurants of this price tag/caliber).  Service was attentive. We actually had two people waiting on us that evening - one was absolutely wonderful, while the other was kind of heavy handed/clumsy and not as pleasant, but overall service was good. I told them via open table that I came here for graduation dinner, and they stuck a candle/wrote ""congratulations"" on the plate of one of the desserts. Small gesture, but appreciated. I'd recommend a visit here if you have guests from out of town and don't mind spending the $$, but if you are looking for good food in particular, I'd say look elsewhere.",0.9942,0.81,0.145,0.044,0.5398171768707484

2014-06-16,1.0,"This is going to be a long, but informative read, so I am preparing you now for this. When I know that I am going to pay top dollar at a restaurant, I expect greatness. I get it; no one is perfect and mistakes can happen from time to time. With that said, I want to be taken on a memorable dining journey. Well, this journey was definitely memorable, but in a very bad way. We get to the Water Tower parking garage, and after parking, and we have to take the elevator all the way to the 1st floor. Once we get off the elevator, we walk dead into a sea of people who are just standing around. Of course, we are new to this restaurant, so we have no idea where to go or what to do. We track down security, and he tells us to walk to the guy in a white shirt who will lead us to the Signature Room. We go to him, and he tells us to go to the elevator, where about 30 of us are crammed into a very small elevator. Boy, that was a fun elevator ride. Nothing like being cramped up with a lot of people in a small elevator. We get off the elevator, and we tell the hostess that we have an 8:30 PM reservation. Of course, we were not seated at 8:30. That would be too much like right. We were seated closer to 9 PM.  We are seated, and this really old waiter comes to our table. He doesn't introduce himself, nor does he tell us of any specials for the evening. He asks for our drinks orders. I order the Old Town Old Fashioned, and my girl orders a basic cosmo. This has to be the first time in my life that i have ever gotten an Old Fashioned that was watered down; I could, literally, see the water floating on top of the drink. I sent that back, and finally got a properly prepared Old Fashioned. After about 10 years, we finally get our Lobster Bisque, which was good. The flavor was nice, and it was properly seasoned. Ten more years pass, and we finally get our other appetizer, which was the Grilled Shrimp. The Grilled Shrimp was also very tasty. After another 10 year wait (notice the theme here?), we get our entrees. I had the good, but overpriced grilled ribeye, while my girl had the vegetable linguine. No complaints about the food, as you can tell. Everything else was the problem. That old waiter was slower than molasses. He barely checked on us, and when he did, he never asked us if everything was good. I had to track him down just to order another drink. He was so slow that we lost interest in having dessert; we just wanted to get out of there.  The menu is terrible. I mean, how can you possibly consider yourself a top scale restaurant when you don't even have the main steak options, such as a Filet Mignon or a Porterhouse? How do you NOT have a sea bass? How could your wine list be so pathetic? How can you have a ton of martini options, but you have very few beer choices (I don't even drink beer, but if I did, i would have been angry with this) and you have very little brown liquor based drink options?  If you must tempt fate and go to this waste of time restaurant, do not go on a Saturday night when the fireworks are happening (Fireworks happen every Saturday night during the summer). Why? Because you will have a bunch of people who will run straight to the windows just to see them. Seriously, these people act like they have never seen a fireworks show in their life. What's really bad is that, of course, our table was near the window, so we had all of these people crowding around our table watching the fireworks while we are trying to enjoy a peaceful dinner. Does management do anything about this? Of course not. We finally get out of there at about 11 PM. If you go tot his restaurant for dinner, expect to pay a lot of money for an underwhelming experience. Don't go............I repeat, don't go to this restaurant. I am not some rookie restauranteur; I dine out every weekend, and I've dined at the top restaurants in the country, and the Signature Room at the 95th isn't even as good as the Rock Bottom Brewery. Go to the usual (Morton's, Maestro's, Gibson's, etc), but DO NOT dine at the Signature Room at the 95th.",0.8832,0.834,0.091,0.075,0.48611082927489174
2014-06-15,4.0,"We made reservations for 1:30pm Friday 2 weeks in advance. Wanted to show my visitors a beautiful sky scrapper view of downtown Chicago without having to pay for it like you would have at the Willis Tower or the observatory at the hancock. Instead, I'd rather spend my money on food whilst enjoying FREE beautiful views, which is why we ate here.  LOCATION: once you arrive at the hancock building, on the main level you will see a sign and red velvet ropes showing you which line to get into for the correct destination (signature lounge/signature room). The ride on the elevator to the signature room is free and lasts 1 minute. When we arrived, there was a short line and only had to wait 5 minutes for the elevator to arrive. The elevator steward packed as many people as possible in the elevator, fyi (this happened every time I've gone there, they pack people like sardines).  Once we were on the 95th floor, you are directed to the hostess table to be seated. We arrived exactly on time for our reservation and waited less than 5 minutes for our window-side table.  VIEW: the view during the day is breathtaking! beautiful views of the beach, lake, sailboats, many sky scrappers. The walls are end to end glass. Once you're done eating, you can also walk upstairs to the bar area, but the views are best on the restaurant floor. SERVICE: Our waiter was so gracious to gift me a $15 gift certificate, because he saw that I had my cap and gown on from graduation. He was attentive, polite and nice. I did notice that he was pushing us to get the buffet, so I guess the place is makes more margins w/ the buffet than the to-order items.  FOOD: My parents opted for their lunch buffet, which is $20. Most of the entree dishes range from $15-20, so they thought they'd get a better deal with a buffet, especially since they were very hungry. However, they didn't like most of the options at the buffet, which was limited in both options and quantity. Things ran out fast, so my parents had to wait 5-10 minutes numerous times before they re-stocked. My parents said that they liked their sweet/sour chicken breast the most. Their cod and steak pieces from the buffet were mediocre. Both the coconut soup and ginger soup were unappetizing. There were no desserts at the buffet either. At the end, they regret getting the buffet and wished they had chosen something off the menu instead. My sister and I weren't as hungry, so we went with their angus burger and the battered fish burger. My angus burger was cooked perfectly, tasted great with lots of fries on the side. It came with lettuce, pickle, tomato, onion, ketchup/mustard on the side. I asked for garlic mayo, but they don't have any. My sister liked her fried fish burger also came with a side of fries, but said she wouldn't get it again b/c it tasted bland. Lastly, we ordered the vanilla bean creme brulee which was divine!!! So good, and the portion size with good, not too small.  OVERALL: decent food....can't go wrong with their tasty angus burger which is only $16 and it comes with fries! Buffet is overrated with very few options and limited quantity.  Best part is the beautiful, FREE view! Most people are seated adjacent to a window, unless it's super busy then they start putting people in the inside tables.

Appetizers included several dishes such as tuna tartare, which was good but was a little bland. Salad was frisée salad with hazelnut crusted Brie.  The Brie portion was generous and the dressing was port vinaigrette, which was a great balancer for the rich cheese. A great start to the meal.  The fillet was cooked perfectly, medium rare and the thickness was just right to allow the sear to work while the rare meat became part of every bite. The natural jus was not salty but drew out the taste nicely.  Very tasty.  The farro and grilled cauliflower were ok but I would have preferred a green of some sort even though the farro was a little crunchy and made a texture surprise.   The other entree was seared salmon which was fresh and flaky but could have been cooked less for a little more medium level.  Very tasty with the saffron butter sauce though.   Great experience and worth a visit when in Chicago.",0.9961,0.784,0.216,0.0,0.5738445378151262

The food was a buffet which was good. Not incredible but good. Drinks were expensive. The total tab would definately set back a group if drinks were involved. The server was fine. Since we were there for a B-day and we called ahead about it. I would say it would be nice if the restaurant did something special for a B-day. Maybe a dessert complimentary or something. No restaurant HAS to do this but since all the LETTUCE ENTERTAIN YOU restaurants do it - it would be a nice gesture and enhance the experience.  At the conclusion of brunch we decided to go up to the obervation deck and see the views. The difference between that area and the signature room was night and day. From elegance to the trailer park. Staff running around, a rude man yelling at us and generally treating us badly. I would NEVER go back there again...EVER. I suppose it's nice for tourists who just want an over priced drink to see the view.  Also The way the building handles the elevators who both these places is INSANE. They have lines that make little sense with employees making even less sense putting people on the same elevators to these two different locations. It should really be better organized. I'm embarassed tourists deal with that. Overall the Signature room is nice but the rest made me not want to repeat the experience.",0.9869,0.767,0.18,0.053,0.5714710884353741

This time, took my bf out for his birthday on Saturday night, reserved for over a month, requested window table, the restaurant called to confirm the reservation I even made sure that we'll be able to get the window table and the lady on the phone said she will make it happen. Got to the restaurant, they seated us next to the wall infront of the kitchen, when I asked for the window table they said there's an hour wait for that, what??? The food was meh. We've been told that the dress code is ""Business Casual"" so we dressed according to what they said but we saw a family wear sneakers and hoodies, is this a joke?

The food, scrumptious.  The service, impeccable.  The view, magnificent. Spent a good chunk of change but it was well worth it.  Our $280 meal consisted of a few beers, a few glasses of wine, an appetizer, main courses, a few sides, a dessert, and coffees.  I'm not complaining  because everything was GREAT. I ordered the rack of lamb which was the most tender and moist rack I had ever eaten!  I am salivating just thinking about it.  I also order the duck trio which consisted of crispy duck thigh, seared foie gras, and duck liver mousse, again, salivating.  Edward enjoyed  his ribeye, which I personally thought was a tad above mediocre.  For dessert we both had a decadent white and dark chocolate  mousse cake.   It was such a pleasureable experience dining atop the Hancock tower.  The view that accompanied the amazing food was literally to die for.   If you're looking to save money  but still want to enjoy the view,  grab a few drinks at the Signature lounge.  They have a huge selection of drinks and a small selection of appetizers, sandwiches, and desserts.   I am looking forward to going back to the Signature Room when I return to Chicago.",0.9901,0.77,0.199,0.031,0.48218390804597694

2014-05-13,5.0,"This one is easy. Sometimes it's hard to separate one's feelings about a restaurant's atmosphere,  the quality of its food, the quality of its staff/service and the reason one is dining. Not here. For us Signature Room is and has always been the whole elegant package.  Signature Room is one of our special places, one to which I took S. to dinner for a Big Birthday, then again for her _3rd. She recently returned the favour with brunch for my 54th. It we survive to our 95ths with our wits and necessary body processes intact, this naturally is where we will celebrate. Following is a short combination review.  They make the celebrant of an occasion feel special with a personalized menu and similarly customized after dining treat. One is immersed in white linen, sparkling glass and flatware and fresh flowers on the table accompanied by live piano. Delicious foods set out during buffet brunch included all one can eat shrimp, sushi, fruit, pastries and the menu offered a wide array of included omelette, waffle,and pancake options and yummy custard French toast. A tidy little still and sparkling wine list. All mixed drinks were well prepared, of good size and strength, and only mildly overpriced considering the tourist driven nature of this establishment and its rent being undoubtedly commensurate with its location. Dinners have been more elegantly refined and pricey, the gracious waiters wearing black tuxedos. A highlight for us has been a gigantic seafood tower appetizer featuring the largest King crab legs we have encountered. We occasionally muse about it when enduring something inferior elsewhere.  The Signature Lounge on the 96th is comfortable, though with an airport lounge feeling, and is much more clearly designed for utilitarian servicing of sightseers. While there we've been enveloped by clouds and thrilled to Technicolor sunsets and helicopters so close as to allow us to exchange waves with those on board. We've watched the city grow to twinkling stars and Lake Shore Drive traffic to kinetic strings of diamonds beneath us, all accompanied by S's first blue martini and the internally warming amber glow of The Balvenie. On clear, warm days Michigan and Indiana and tall buildings on the Northwestern campus are distantly visible, while everywhere regattas of sailboats and powerboats traverse Lake Michigan.  All service, servers and management have during every visit been more than accommodating and wholly excellent auxiliary dining companions: pleasant, well mannered, knowledgeable, uniformly dressed, clean, quick to fill and take away dishware and sensitive about interrupting.  Five stars. Again, perhaps no aspect is perfect in itself, though the experience in its entirety is one to treasure, to appreciate for the wonder it is. The Signature Room helps to create happy memories. With all our best, as always, Peter O. and S.",0.9982,0.78,0.204,0.016,0.5223032069970845

We were decent, our attires have no tears/ripped, jeans were dark enough. My daughter felt bad that we could have lost the experience because of how she looked.  During dinner, nobody checked on us how we were doing and how the food was, or if we need more water/something else. But they were fast in getting our plates when it looked empty.  We felt rushed.

I was seated a a pretty bad table and initally didn't make a comment because I didn't know what I was missing. One stroll around the restaurant fixed that.

2014-02-26,4.0,"What do you get when you order a filet and cocktail 950 feet above downtown Chicago?  A dining experience that makes your heart swoon and a tab that makes your pocketbook break down and cry.  I've been here twice for dinner, for Valentine's Day occasions--both were incredible meals that I'll remember for a long time. I remember coming here with my girlfriend back in 2010 and the check totaled $125, which was the most I'd ever paid for a dinner date up to that point (broke-ass college sophomore).  A few years later, I returned with the same lovely gal on Feb 14th and when the bill came, I was thunderstruck to see that it was DOUBLE what it was just three years prior.  $250 for two, without alcohol, on a pre-fixe option. Holy shiznit, Batman.  I make a decent wage, but even still, that's just a few steps below Alinea pricing..... Anyways, the view is spectacular at night (duh), and the food itself is sumptuous--I recall fondly having had the best cut of meat in my life on the 95th.  It was one of the very few times I wish I could've met the cow that produced this high-caliber cut of beef.  Soups were great, dessert was good, portions were relatively small.  We didn't even bother with drinks because martinis started at $12 and my personal favorite Long Island Iced Tea was a whopping $16.  Even with premo top-shelf booze, that's still almost twice what a good LiiT should be priced at.  Just nuts. TL;DR: 4 out of 5 stars because while the food and atmosphere is superb, you're paying dearly for the prestige of dining 1/5th mile above Michigan Avenue.  Make no mistake, The Signature Room is 4/4 dollar signs, and then some.  The experience IS unequaled, however.  I would recommend coming here once for a very special occasion and then delegating the rest of your monthly food budget to Arby's/Jimmy Johns.  Unless your wallet is like Adele, rolling in the deep.",0.9929,0.798,0.158,0.044,0.41066931216931224

It is definitively an unique place to eat. The service was attentive, relaxed and efficient. Plates were served fastly.  As starters, we had a Lobster Bisque and a Mixed Green Salad.  Both of them were satisfying. As main dishes, we choosed the Roasted Rack of Lamb plus a side of Roasted Mushrooms, and the Black Truffle Tagliatelles.  The lamb was cooked as requested and very tender. The white truffle panna cotta going with it was a little bit fatty in mouth, but fited very well with the mushrooms, contrasted with their saltiness. The whole worked well together with the mint pesto bringing some freshness and lightness to the rich panna cotta. The Tagliatteles were cooked al'dente with a delicious and subtled sauce flavored by the truffle. A simple but savourous dish. The bread accompanying the meal was crispy and fresh. We had a glass of surprising american wines: a Riesling from Michigan and a Chardonnay from Washington. Easy to drink, light, delicate.  For the dessert, the carrot-cake was made in the traditionnal way, as it has to be done.  A nice place in Chicago to have a dinner for two people.",0.9879,0.831,0.163,0.005,0.5613756613756614

The ambiance was really the only thing going for the place.   I called ahead and told them it was my partner's birthday and our 2nd anniversary.

I know he struggled to make reservations, which is no surprise, but after dining here, personally, I didn't see the draw (in the food, anyway). We were lucky enough to be told to visit the top floor first for drinks. We arrived an hour early (still light outside) and ordered drinks. I ordered a $16 long island...yes, SIXTEEN DOLLAR long island and sipped that thing for an hour. Yes, it was a special occasion, but I'm not stupid enough to spend $60 on four drinks. Regardless, the view was incredible and I'm so glad we stopped here first. For dinner, we went back downstairs and were seated near the inside against a wall, but still close enough to view the outside. As the light dimmed, it was beautiful to see all the city lights illuminating. No photo I took could capture this at all.  Our server was top-notch and I'd expect nothing less. He was fantastic, attentive and kind, but not overbearing. We weren't here to pinch pennies and ordered lots. We went several years ago, so the appetizers have changed, but they were nothing memorable. Good, even very good, but that was about it.  For dinner, hubby ordered the filet and was very impressed. He said it cut like butter, and the taste was indeed great. That's what I would expect! Something outstanding and cooked to perfection. I, on the other hand, did not have such luck. I am a huge fan of seafood, so I ordered the seafood risotto which I noticed, is thankfully no where to be found on the menu. The dish was extremely watery and the seafood didn't taste fresh or well-prepared at all. For dessert we ordered the dark chocolate mousse cake.

2014-01-28,2.0,"M and I were eager to experience the baffling Signature Room for ourselves. We'd heard time and time again that it was over-priced and that the food fell short. We were quick to reserve our table when we saw that Signature Room was participating in Restaurant Week so that we could see what it was like without paying an arm and a leg. Our anticipation grew when a Signature Room employee left a voice mail telling us not to wear jeans or gym shoes - that the dress code was business casual. We obediently donned dresses and cabbed over to the Hancock Building. Our first sentiment upon stepping off the elevator into the Signature Room was extreme annoyance. We saw guests wearing jeans and Uggs. We saw casually dressed children. Next, we were chagrined that the coat check was $1. We had the cash on us, but we probably would have tipped those coat check employees more generously if we weren't compelled to pay for their services. The atmosphere in the Signature Room was bustling. It was loud and obnoxious. The only nice design feature was the view. Everything else might as well have been a plain room or a plain table or a plain chair. The restaurant was divided into rooms and we were ushered to a narrow room with a low ceiling. Next, we were offended by our server. He flippantly dropped our napkins into our laps - a gesture that would have been impressive if it weren't for his casual motions. He also handed us menus - regular menus and drink menus. I quickly determined my drink but he already left. Everything about him was like that - abrupt and bordering rude. His manner was magnified when we told him we wanted to see the Restaurant Week menus. He snatched ALL of the menus (he didn't need to take the drink menu) and left again. You can imagine my horror when M told him to remake my drink. I ordered the Maple Bacon Manhattan for $14.50. It came in a glass filled to the brim with ice and garnished with a slice of bacon. If you don't have direct experience with Manhattans, a quick Google search of ""Manhattan cocktail"" will show you that it is NOT served with ice. Everything from that point was better. Each of us was utterly impressed by our food. Perhaps it was the expectation that it be bad and then the shock that it wasn't. We started with the lobster bisque, which we loved. I got the duck entree and M got the short ribs. We were both delighted by the flavors and textures. For dessert we got flourless chocolate cake and apple pie. Both were cold and tasty but not impressive. In writing this review, I am torn by how to rate the Signature Room. We were disappointed by our experience there but loved the food. Granted, the food was not nearly impressive enough to garner a second visit; however, it was good enough to move my rating from one star.",0.9869,0.806,0.127,0.067,0.5803989488772099

We were even allowed to use the freight elevators to bypass the long lines that develop for both elevators and tables. Even if you're not lucky enough to know someone with inside connections, however, the Signature Room (or the Signature Lounge one floor up on the 96th floor of the John Hancock Building) is still worth at least one visit for the superlative views of the city, because it's really all about the view. In fact, if you're entertaining out-of-town visitors (or even if you just feel like doing the tourist thing for yourself) the Signature Room or Lounge is probably a better alternative than the observatory deck at the Sears/Willis Tower because you get to sit down and enjoy tasty (if pricey) cocktails at the same time you're enjoying the view. Just be prepared to drop some money -- $14 - $16 for cocktails, $16 per glass for the least expensive wine, and anywhere from $35 - $65 for entrees. (The Signature Lounge is a little more reasonable with a menu of appetizers and sandwiches, but still a bit pricey.) Also know that you will wait in a line to use the elevators and again for your table if you don't have reservations. In fact, reservations are recommended if you want a window seat, otherwise it's first come, first served. It's also best to come on a day with clear weather, for obvious reasons.

Alittle bummed we didnt get a window seat but i think thats cause our reservations were at 11am and the 10am-1030'ers beat us to the punch. Thats not their fault though!  Either way.. they have a fancy buffet of starters like fruit/salad, bagels, croissants, etc. They also have a ton of little sweets for desert. (Alcoholic drinks are NOT included in the buffet, FYI). The entree menu is given to you to order off of. You can order as many as you want! I ordered the brioche french toast. It was good but a tad sweet for my liking. The caramel sauce underneath the french toast was alittle heavier then i would have liked. No complaints on the bacon. My husband ordered the steak and poached egg combo and enjoyed it.  Overall, i do believe you're paying for the view but man, its a good one. I dont think i'll ever be a regular at this place but do plan to stop by for dinner on a special occasion.

We specifically requested a window table with a nice view since this is what this place is known for after all isn't it? Well we get there and it seemed to be a very slow night.  We were walked to our table but there was a minor issue... IT WASN'T A WINDOW TABLE!!  So I kindly asked them to move us to a window table since we had requested a window table when submitting the reservation.  The hostess said window tables were only ""first come first serve"". Uuuum ok well why didn't anyone call me to let me know ahead of time.  I own four restaurants myself and when we have guests have special requests that we cannot accommodate we call and let them know ahead of time.  Well at least in my mind that's what makes sense.  So then I noticed there were a few window tables that weren't being used so I obviously pointed that out to the hostess but she said those were setup for some reservations.  She said it was an hour wait for a window table. How is that even possible when you don't have anyone waiting?!! Didn't you just say window tables are first come first serve?!! Make up your mind on what your restaurant policy is!!! Well needless to say they didn't budge on getting us a table so we just got up and left. As we walked out and waited for the elevator, we noticed she went explain the situation to what seemed to be her manager and he too did not care.  It was almost as if that's how their staff is trained.  I did notice all the window tables were occupied by an older crowd so I guess they figured we weren't there to spend enough money to get a window table so they wanted to hold their last few available window tables for  their big money spenders.  Well I wish they would've known I too had money to spend.  I guess they need to make adjustments in their policy and maybe they should ask for a copy of everyone's bank statement rather than judging based on age in order to determine who is worthy of a window table.  All in all, we will never be back.  There are too many great places to dine at in Chicago to be wasting my time there.",0.9669,0.887,0.077,0.036,0.4922331691297209

The potato leek looked iffy so I went with French Onion. Maybe people were taking too much broth and leaving all the onions behind, but it was SUPER heavy on the onions. And the onions could stand to have a thinner cut. Also, the cheese they had out for the french onion soup didn't really melt so that was kind of weird. And the kale and quinoa salad made the remarkable accomplishment of being simultaneously drenched in dressing and yet completely bland. For dessert, we ordered the banana split and the mousse cake. I was wholly underwhelmed by both. I could make that banana split and have it not cost $10. And the mousse cake was okay, but not really any better than something you could buy from the bakery section of your grocer's deli. However, the ""Happy Birthday"" in chocolate was a nice touch.

Its a 30-45 minute wait to get a window table which is silly. We didn't want to wait so sat next to the window rows, there were literally 3-4 empty window tables. Its a ploy imo to get you to grab an additional drink at the bar or something. There is a 1 MAIN ENTREE minimum per person. What if we don't like the dishes on the menu and instead order 1 main entree with 2 sides... the answer was NO, the minimum has to be met. We didn't want to spoil our celebratory mood so went along with it. there are only 2 entree dishes for vegetarians which sucks.  Gnocchi was so bad... please don't order it. bland, dry and very average. I had to box most of it and give it to the homeless. People serving the dishes were typical pushy, trying to get rid of your plate or drink even though there is still enough left just to get you out of there quickly. View and the ambiance is very good so I'm giving 2 stars. Otherwise its a waste.  RECOMMENDATION: Put your reservation for an early time so that you can wait for 30 mins and get a window table.

The views were absolutely spectacular but for that you can go to the cocktail lounge where there is anyone and everyone (no dress code in that part).  The service was not very good at all. We waited 30 minutes past our reservation time till we finally approached them. They weren't apologetic and said that someone must have taken our table when they called our name, even though we were right in front of the desk the whole time and never heard it.  When we finally sat, we had a gorgeous view of the city. Absolutely amazing to see at night. When our waiter finally arrived we ordered wine (took forever). We tried to order an appetizer but were informed that the kitchen rules are that they must be ordered with the entrees at the same time. Ok? Our white wine was brought out and not put on ice after being served. Our bbq short ribs appetizer was amazing but a little small. Our scallop seafood entrees were very good and more than enough for both of us.  We barely saw our waiter and at the end we asked to take a picture by the window since no one was seated there at the moment. He told us he'd come back to do it and didn't show up for probably 15 minutes. When he finally did someone had been seated in the open spot and I had to re-ask him to take our picture, which he did huffily. All in all, I won't go back to the restaurant and will stick to the cocktail lounge for the view.

This place is used to catering to visitors/tourists so I suppose that's why the have such a disdainful attitude when it comes to being hospitable. That's no excuse!

Desserts: $15. Plan for $70-$100/ person to have a great time!  Overall, if you want a classy, business friendly or romantic place to ""wow"" those you bring- this is THE place to go!! Remove the views and this place wouldn't exist. However, if you go, the view is why you're going! So, my review will be through this paradigm.  Nothing comes close anywhere in the Windy City!!!! This reason alone, i say GO GO GO!!! They could serve communion wafers, it doesn't matter!!!  Make a reservation ahead of time. When you arrive, you will be added to a separate waiting list if you want a window table. They quoted us 45 minutes on a Friday night but ended up being closer to 20. Depending on who you get when you call, they will be friendly or snobby/rude (I called several times). And phone hold time averaged 5 minutes.  Menu is standard for this caliber of restaurant- steak, lamb, sea food, etc. There are not any quality Vegan options and few quality Vegetarian options. They do have a separate Gluten Free menu.  Food is on par with any average higher end steak house. Fresh, great presentation, good quality food, but nothing outstanding. Nothing stood out to our group- except the views!!! Let's be real, they could serve cardboard and I'd still think about going back- the views were that good!! One side dish worth mentioning that our entire table enjoyed was the *Cheese Couscous*!!! Very good! Best side anyone had! The Sweet Potato side sounds better than it was.  There is a great variety of drinks and all of the ones we had were great! We ordered Moscow Mule, Black Forest Cake, Long Island, and a couple more- They were all on the stronger side - which was great!  Our waiter did his job but had no personality and as I mentioned previously in a 'tip', they auto add 18% gratuity- which explained his approach of doing ""just enough to not be bad""! :-)  Dress is business casual (no shorts, ripped jeans or sneakers). Also, a little known fact is the elevator you take up is the fastest elevator in the world!!!!!

We didn't eat any food - just came up to take some photos and relax a little bit.  Here are a few things you need to know if you're coming here as a tourist: 1) If you come around 6PM, you will have a long wait to go up.  The lounge on the 95th floor has a lot of space, so I'm not sure where most of the people go when they take 30 minutes to head up the elevator.  We were seated promptly and given great service by the waitresses for the single drink order.  I would suggest coming here at 3-4PM if you just want to see the place and take photos. 2) Since sodas are $5.50 and cocktails are $14, we ordered the Strawberry smoothie for $8. I figured this was the most reasonable deal since I didn't want a drink yet and I love strawberries. The smoothie did not disappoint. 3) Ladies, take photos of the view from the ladies restroom. It's said to be the best view from the lounge area because the windows are relatively clean and unobstructed.  Since I didn't want to get arrested going into the ladies room with a camera, I let my gf do it.

Sure, I've been to worse.  But those other bad restaurants didn't purport themselves to be 4-star restaurants and didn't charge me a $300 check.   I have never had such AWFUL service in my life.  The waiter was such a jerk, I almost tipped the bus boy in front of him and left him with nothing.  Also, we waited 20 minutes in front of the elevators, in a stampede to get down the building after dinner.  No organized lines--you would think the management would know by now that weekends and holidays are busy and they should be better organized.  That was definitely a fire hazard waiting to happen.   Finally, I would put up with all this bull if the food was great.  But I can say without a doubt that it was awful.  Every single piece of meat we ordered--the lamb chops, the pork chop, the duck, and even the foie gras--were way overcooked.  Barely could chew.  (Seriously.  How do you ruin foie gras?)  And of course there were mashed potatoes on every plate.  I think that's their go-to when the other parts of the meal are awful.  Just mask the awfulness with a ton of over-buttered mashed potatoes.  Oh, by the way.  Every diner MUST order an entree.  They don't tell you that when you reserve.  We were going to order a ton of different plates to share--appetizers and otherwise--because the entrees were not so appetizing.  But guess what--had to ordered entrees too.  I think they're afraid to lose money.  But we were planning to order more than what it ended up costing for the entrees themselves. The $53-bottle of wine we ordered was also $8 at Trader Joe's down the street.  If I could give this place zero stars I would.  I know that it's a tourist hot spot--that's why I brought my parents when they came to visit Chicago.  But this was their least enjoyable meal.  There are so many great places in that neighborhood.  Save your money and go up to the lounge on the 96th.  You CAN'T really take pictures at the 95th floor restaurant unless they seat you at a window.  I made my reservation A MONTH AGO and requested a window, and they just put us in the middle of the dining room because they'd rather fill seats.  These guys (management and otherwise) do not care about returning customers because the bulk of their diners are tourists who come once.   DON'T GO HERE.",-0.4022,0.856,0.068,0.076,0.5441964285714285

We were seated promptly, and greeted by our friendly waiter. After reviewing the menu, we decided on the seafood squid ink fettuccine and the lamb rack. We also ordered some white wine. The food came out quickly, however, the dishes didn't stand out to me. The seafood especially the scallops were well cooked, but I found the whole dish to be a little bland and boring. We had enough room to order one dessert to share and went for the apple cranberry crumble. This was decent but by no means made up for the food or view. The servers were friendly and came by multiple times to check up on us. However, at times I found them a little too chatty, I would see the servers grouping together by the stairs and chatting away. Another interesting note I remembered was that upon arrival, one of the waitresses told us that the weather would probably clear up soon, as the skies were clear just an hour ago. Two hours into our dinner, another large party walks in, and she tells them exactly the same thing. Tsk tsk lies.

That was putting it lightly.  We got to the top and it was loud, extremely too loud and drunk people were shoving into us before we had a chance to get out.  The decor of the place itself has gone to shit and it has turned into this modern utilitarian looking cave that belongs in a vegas brothel.  We waited a little longer for my favorite table that I could show my roommate the exact places we had already visited and places we were going.  While we were sitting next to the window people wanted to take pictures over us and it was more than invasive.  I asked a nearby server to ask them to stop and he did absolutely nothing.  Our server clearly hates her life and treated us like we were at a hotdog joint.  Children were running around.  The martinis were subpar and I had cork in my wine.  All in all, I used to be amazed by this place when I was younger, my father had just about every lunch meeting her and my mother has wonderful memories here, but after this past time, I am no longer a fan and sadly enough, probably never returning.",-0.3257,0.88,0.056,0.065,0.5288888888888889

The private room is wonderful, but the limited menu is somewhat disappointing. The food options never really WOW'ed me.  This past Christmas we decided to split up our party so we could sit in the main room and have the full menu. THIS was a meal to remember. Highlights of the meal included:  - Scallops - Our waiter said he replicated the dish at home because it's so good. - Sea Bass - Cooked perfectly, with a vanilla sauce that was surprisingly and pleasantly different - Mushroom Salad - With breaded goat cheese, pomegranate, and other morsels of yumminess. Front-runner for the best salad I have ever had. - Dessert - I'm not a big dessert fan, but I gotta say their take on ""milk and cookies"" for Christmas was really charming. This place is a winner when you factor in the view, service, and atmosphere (a live pianist was playing Christmas tunes).

With that said the food is just OK.  I was here recently for a birthday dinner and I was really excited. The menu looked amazing and I just knew I was in for some deliciousness. Sadly everything just feel a tad bit short. To start I got the Romaine Salad which was pretty standard. It came with a piece of garlic toast on top that really added flavor. My mother got the lobster bisque which was pretty good. For my main meal I got the rack of lamb. The lamb was  seasoned well and prepared perfectly. Unfortunately whatever it came with didn't complement the meat. The cumin spaetzel was flavorless and didn't add to the lamb. The roasted carrots and the gremolata was ok but the I felt like the dish was missing something. My mother got the roasted Amish Chicken which was just ok. The creamy grits were great and probably the better part of the meal. While the chicken was flavorful but it was dry.  So while everything was ok I expected it to be amazing. Either way I enjoyed my time and my party was treated very well. I will probably go back next time for drinks and to look out into our beautiful city.,0.9955,0.724,0.253,0.023,0.5709876543209876

The special that night was surf and turf which we both had, and man was it amazing. I am dying to go back to this restaurant because the view alone was so romantic.

The gentleman who seated us was friendly and asked how we were doing. We were seated and greeted within five minutes if being sat. The ambiance is very dark and romantic. It seemed like the majority of the people that were seated by us were couples. Unfortunately, the weather was very overcast so we were not able to see much of the cities view. But, we cannot control Mother Nature. We ordered our drinks and it seemed to take quite sometime. Our waiter dropped them off and walked away to greet another table. At that point, we were ready to order, so we had to wait for him to come back. We put our order in and while we waited, there was a gentleman who walked around with bread which was nice. The bread was warm and fresh. The same guy also made sure that our water glasses were full.  Our food was delivered by another gentleman who kindly asked us if there was anything else we needed. I ordered the strip steak and a side of potatoes. My boyfriend ordered the pork chops. My steak was cooked exactly how I asked for it and his pork chops fell off the bone. I think out server checked back with us once while we were eating. He seemed to be pretty busy..I finished what I could eat and my food sat in front of me while I wanted for it to be boxed. Once my boyfriend finished, we stacked the dirty dishes and that is when someone came by to clean it up. I think it was the same guy who dropped our food off. We then had to ask for,our food to be boxed. Once my food was boxed, our server then came back to drop off the dessert menus and asked if we wanted coffee. He took our order and dropped it off. We ordered the white and dark chocolate mousse cake with orange marmalade which was good. We then got our check and paid. Overall, the food and the ambiance was nice. The reason why I am giving is three stars is because of the service. The waiter seemed to be more attentive to other tables than us.

Normally, our experiences here have been really good but this time around, it was terrible! We had a drink at the lounge before our 8pm reservations. It was very busy and our server seemed like she had tons of other tables to take care of, which I completely understand having been in her position before. I wasn't really bothered by this as much because I saw her running around making sure everyone was being taken care of. i think her name was Oleaska or something like that. We eventually got sat on time and our server seemed nice. It took 50 minutes for our food to come out, for pasta and chicken, I really don't think it should take that long. Once again, being a bartender and server, I know the kitchen can take long and so on but never once did our server come to let us know it'll take a little longer or apologize for the wait. All I wanted was a simple apology for the time because that's what I would've done in his position. The food didn't taste too great and I actually had a better tagliatelle pasta at an Italian restaurant a week later for half the price. Nothing stood out at all about this visit and sadly, we won't be going back for our 5th anniversary.

At 10:25, the security at the John Hancock showed us where to wait for the elevators but informed us that the ""elevators won't work until 11am."" We started a line. At about 10:35 we tried the elevators but sure enough, you couldn't actually go up once inside. Got back in line. Long line now formed and some guy walks right passed our line and proceeds into the elevator and gets upstairs. This was at 10:45 - so, you CAN get upstairs 15 minutes earlier than security tells you. Once up there, it was awesome. Nice hostesses, GREAT view, even on a cloudy day! Our waiter was Ronald and he was AWESOME. So efficient and so nice. We all had the lunch buffet, which I wasn't crazy about. The vegetables had brussel sprouts in them, so I passed. I was told they were overcooked and hard, btw. The minestrone soup was flavorful. I did not love the options up there. The meats were OK but if you don't eat meat, there wasn't enough of other in my opinion. The caeser salad was tasteless, the pasta salad was tasteless, the mashed potatoes were very good. Wish they had had more sides. Would have been nice if they had even just one sweet thing at the buffet, like a cookie tray. My coffee was delicious. Regardless of the OK meal, my guests LOVED theirs. So, to each his own. For the price of $20 each, how could we go wrong in Chicago with that view?! Well worth it. I'd def. go again. I suggest reservations! At about 12pm we overheard there was a 45 minute wait for a window seat and the waiting area wasn't that packed.  What I am aggravated about is that their website states no athletic wear and I called to confirm and they said NO tennis shoes are allowed. This was very inconvenient for us being from out of town and walking around all day. Despite, we followed the rules and wore dress shoes.

We didn't have reservations but there were plenty of empty tables.  We put our name in and they told us we had to each order an entree.  Well this was baffling to us.  No fine dining establishment ever told us what we had to order.  We had planned on sharing the surf and turf (most expensive dish) and an appetizer.  When we explained this to the host, she got a scared look on her face and said she had to ask permission.  Seriously? She walked 10 steps to her permission giver, and stood there asking for permission to seat 2 young looking kids who only wanted to order 1 entree and an appetizer.  The Wizard didn't even look at her as she kept talking, and finally she walks back with a scared look on her face.  Before she speaks, I just tell her ""it's fine.  Don't worry about it.""  And she says ""you can join us for dinner but you have to order the surf and turf and an appetizer."" Wow.  (Not a good wow.) Anyways, we get seated, surprise, not a window seat.  We order cocktails and start with the oysters.  I also spot the special - scallops, so I decide to order the appetizer size as my entree.  The bf gets the surf and turf as we are so required. My scallops were delicious.  The appetizer size consisted of 3 decent sized scallops.  The oysters were yummy.  His surf and turf was decent.  I would say there is a lack of flavor anytime you just put a slab of meat and a steamed lobster tail on a plate.  There isn't much creativity required to prepare that dish.   Service at the Lounge upstairs is great.  (Review to come).  Service downstairs at the restaurant - not so much.",0.9883,0.804,0.142,0.054,0.6487577639751552

I went around 11am on a Monday morning... and though the best spots were taken (views of lake michigan) - I still had plenty of tables to choose from.  Also - if you're going in from Michigan Ave.. enter by the Cheesecake Factory, then look for an escalator.. take that one floor up - and you should see signs for elevators to the 95th and 96th floors! There you go.. just saved a $17 admission - now use it for that drink with maple syrup!

To put it into context, the food is not at the level of a place like Zed 451. Hostess was a cluster. Despite being the 1st couple through the door with reservations, we were seated behind others who came after us. Not a huge deal but something that can be improved.

After waiting for about 3 minutes to get upstairs, we were brought to this classy (and crowded) bar with and INCREDIBLE view. We waited about 7 minutes for a table, getting nervous they might be full. The host told us to go towards the window and down the steps and theres our table. We, hands down, had the BEST view in the place (besides maybe the womens bathroom, which is breathtaking). There were three of us and we sat at a little table that faced the South/East side of the city.

The service is alright - not exactly what I would expect from a fine dining establishment, but I was in the bar (I'm assuming the restaurant is better).

A bunch of us visiting Chicago for the first time were told we HAD to go up to the Signature Room for the view and to grab drinks. We headed up on a Saturday afternoon around 4pm- the lines for the elevator as well as for the bar were certainly long (the Chicago marathon was in town), but we barely waited for about 10-15 mins total before the host seated us at what seemed like the best table in the house, right next to the windows. The views are gorgeous and unparalleled...whereas the Sears Tower is a hardcore tourist attraction also with great views, being at the Signature Room allowed us to take a break from our touristy activities while grabbing a drink and enjoying the ambience. The place was crowded with people of all ages- we saw families with kids, couples, and groups of friends such as ourselves.  Our waitress was very efficient despite handling multiple tables. We all ordered specialty cocktails which range from $11-15. There's also a small selection of beers ranging $7-9 and non-alcoholic drinks and sodas ranging $5-7. There is also a selection of appetizers and desserts if drinks aren't your thing. It was admittedly kind of pricey, but the drinks were large and strong. Plus considering you pay $18 just to get to the top of the Sears Tower, paying the same for the same gorgeous views AND a drink at the Signature Room is a pretty good deal.  Definitely a great place to take your out-of-town guests for a drink. We never felt rushed or pressured to leave despite the crowd.

2012-09-24,4.0,"Best brunch I've had in a while!  I can't say how this restaurant is for lunch, dinner, drinking, etc.  But I can say that Sunday brunch is incredibly fun, reasonably priced, and a quick way to ensure a full day of vegging out on your sofa. The brunch is $45 for unlimited entree items and a self serve buffet.  The seafood variations were pretty numerous, which thrilled me because I'm a seafood junkie.  Cocktail shrimp, seafood salads, crab legs, etc were all available for the taking.  The best thing I ate was this tiny cup of a seafood salad, like a pasta salad type dish but with seafood (duh).  Not overly creamy so the flavor of the fish was still fresh.  The crab legs were great too. Our server brought us over a whole plate of them after my friend and I asked if we were eating them properly.  We felt messy and disgusting, but then we both realized that there's no sexy way to eat a crab leg. You just go for it. The brunch also offered a variety of pastries, desserts, ice cream, etc.  I'm not the biggest fan of sweets, but I had a scrumptious little cinnamon roll all hot and fresh out the kitchen. Little granola and yogurt cups were yummy too. I didn't try many of the desserts except for their build your own sundae stand. Even the ice cream that came in those industrial sized gallon cartons was good.  Off the entree menu I ordered the Eggs Benedict. Best decision ever. The hollandaise sauce wasn't too thick and they gave it to you on the side as well which I appreciate.  My poached egg was perfectly cooked too so I got just the right amount of yolk spilling onto my little open faced sandwich. Yum. The tortilla soup is tied for first or second place with the eggs benedict.  Holy shit NOM NOM NOM NOM is all I can say about the tortilla soup. I swear someone took a really amazing taco and put it in a blender and served it up. This soup was SO good. I had like 4 cups of it (don't judge - the cups are small!) because it was so good. I mean I told my friend Annie that it was amazing, and she kinda shrugged me off like yeah whatever Maya.  Then, she tried it and had the same nom nom nom reaction as me. So enough about the food. Coffee wasn't anything to rave about, but their adorable little tea diffusers and green tea was refreshing that morning.  The fresh squeezed OJ was also good, nothing to rave about though. I think the whole reason anyone goes to the Signature Room though is the view. And let me tell you I slutted it up with my camera there, not really caring who's breakfast I had to invade. It was my first time up there so I took advantage of being the obnoxious tourist.  Luckily we had a window seat which made it that much better. The best view is in the ladie's room up the stairs towards the bar.  Oh my gosh if you really wanted to, you could piss and have the best view in Chicago. Seriously. That's what they say. Can't say anything about the alcohol or their other services, but brunch is fun. I'm taking my sister for her birthday and I think she'll love it. She's never seen Chicago from up top like this so it'll be a great gift for her and it's a nice tourist attraction. So, I vote go. I vote come hungry and girls wear looser dresses, men, wear a looser pair of pants. You'll want to stuff your face. Then, on the way home, pick up a bottle of Perrier or Pelligrino to get rid of that uncomfortably full feeling. Go straight home, turn on the tv, watch football, and veg out the rest of the day.

Sounds like a steal....only if you want to see an amazing view. But $20 for a mediocre at best lunch buffet? Nu-uh.  The lunch buffet consisted of penne pasta, grilled chicken, lots of grilled & steamed veggies, grilled talapia, and hangar skirt steak with a pretty good olive/pesto sauce. But the pasta & chicken was too dry. They had amuse bouche salad shooters that were interesting (cajun shrimp salad, tomato & cucumber, orange fennel).  The salad ""bar"" which consisted of two sauces (buttermilk ranch that was tasted like sour cream and some citrus vinaigrette that was so sour that it kind of tasted like it went bad) was just sad. They had two choices of soup - tortilla & vegetable - that were just okay - definitely something I could have cooked with Campbell soup cans.  They had ham, cheese platters (where's the crackers??) and absolutely, NO DESSERTS OR FRUITS. Not okay. What kind of buffet doesn't have any sweets?? Food - 2 stars, but for the view, I'd give you 1 more. TIPS:  1. CALL IN ADVANCE! Was going to come on Saturday for 12:00 lunch, but called in and was told that they didn't have any spots until 12:30. Phew, saved me some waiting time! 2.

And that's exactly what this restaurant is for, out of towners wanting a view of Chicago while enjoying a decent high-end dinner.  Had the Seafood Tower, an amazing triple platter stack of seafood to share with the table: - A dozen oysters (Virginia variety) which were fresh and extremely delicious - Lots of crab legs - Two lobster tails + 4 lobster claws Among the entrees at our table: - Seafood cioppino: great dish, fantastic tomato broth that was well spiced and full of flavor but light enough to complement the abundance of seafood in the rest of the bowl. Clams, fish, prawns, mussels, scallops, oh my. Also came with bread.  - Seared duck breast: really good dish, sweet and slightly tangy with the ginger-soy + pineapple combination sauce. Great flavor and well cooked.  - Seared Walleye: a white fish that was well cooked and had a solid sauce of parsley puree. Nothing great but was tasty.  - Seared salmon: meh. Salmon can be difficult to make amazing and the challenge wasn't met here. Still a solid dish but not something worth the atmosphere and the other dishes. Dessert: - Raspberry cheesecake: Yum. A solid cheesecake. And I appreciated the fresh berries. The view is spectacular and showcases human engineering and ingenuity in the skyscrapers and city of Chicago. Plus we happened to go on a Wednesday summer night with the Navy Pier fireworks coming right as dessert arrived. Service was impeccable and the environment was fantastic.  Again, this review is for the special occasions with people who are not from Chicago. For locals, there's really no reason to spend the $$$$ on this restaurant unless it's a particularly out of the ordinary occasion; the value isn't there if you already live in Chicago.  Hence, 4 stars for surprisingly great oysters, seafood, and duck, combined with a unique experience and venue. I wouldn't say it's a must for showing visitors a good time but it's certainly a great option if the finances allow for it.

The hostess was unapologetic and said we'd wait another hour for a better location. So we remained at our table with the understanding that upon completion of our $200 meal, we could proceed to the 96th floor lounge for a better view. We shared our predicament with the lounge host but were appalled by his response.  He denied entry and flatly stated, "" A lot of people think this is an observatory. We don't allow people to walk around here."" He could have remedied the situation by allowing us to take one of the available seats. Hell, we would've been happy just to stand by a window. If he'd demonstrated ANY level of hospitality, we would've bought a few rounds of drinks to justify our use of the space. Instead, we made our way out of the building and stopped in the restrooms to catch a glimpse of the skyline. TIP: If you still want to give The Signature Room a try, save your money and skip the restaurant! The food is mediocre, and you'll never be guaranteed a view.

The costs for a drink or admission to the lookouts is pretty much the same with the difference that your waiting time is much less and you get some booze on top. During the weekend it can happen that both the restaurant and bar are packed but since the drinks are quite expensive most people don't stay long in the bar.  Besides, you are allowed to take taking pictures on the 96th floor without having a drink, at least they do not disturb you.

2012-08-15,5.0,"This review is for the private dining event space, specifically.  We recently hosted our wedding reception in the private dining space of the Signature Room and could not be any happier.  The event coordinator, Tracy, was incredible at her job.  If only all our vendors could have been as amazing as she is, I would have had considerably less stress in the wedding planning.  She took of of my meticulous concerns and questions in stride and helped get everything worked out wonderfully.  We were inviting mostly-out-of-town guests to the Chicago we love for our wedding, so we wanted to give them ""the Chicago we love"" which meant great views, fine dining, and excellent dancing.  We accomplished all that and then some, I think.  Because the guests immediately got a ""Whoa, this is incredibly special"" vibe upon entering the space, they were excited and that led to them having an even better time than just a regular wedding in a regular venue.  Plus, we had a smallish wedding and the space was perfect for us (we had 75 guests and we rented all 4 private dining spaces, so there was plenty of room and neither the space nor the tables were crowded).  We priced every tall building in Chicago and found there weren't all that many for a small wedding which had fantastic views.  The cost of signature room ended up being more affordable than other tall-options and there is definitely NO BETTER view in this city than seeing the entire city from the 95th floor.  The servers were prompt, the place is in immaculate condition, the linens and china are gorgeous, and the 5 course meal is impressive.  They put together a delicious vegetarian meal for us and it was beautifully presented.  The one drawback is the pastry chef.  Her work was very sloppy.  Because I had seen pictures of very sloppy piping on cakes when I was choosing, I went with the most simplistic design I could to eliminate any ""hand-work,"" but my plan backfired.  She nearly covered the layers with ribbon (I had given her two kinds in case she didn't have enough with one and she put both on, one on top of the other and they were like 2"" ribbons) and the real flowers which were to go between the layers were a mess, AND the cake was crooked.  It just looked bad and the taste was no better.  It was dry and had an ""off"" taste to it.  I took one bite and that was enough.  The cake was an embarrassment, but in light of the fabulous surrounds, it was (hopefully) overlooked.  But to other brides, I would STRONGLY recommend going with plated desserts instead of a cake.  But other than this, we stongly feel like the Signature Room was the most amazing choice for our Chicago wedding, ESPECIALLY because we had so many out of town guests.  It really just made for an incredibly gorgeous and special night for us and all our guests.",0.9947,0.812,0.148,0.039,0.5964130502266097

As a bit of the 'hair of the dog' we ordered drinks.  My 'honkers ale' turned into a Heineken.  I was too tired too complain.  I ordered the steak sandwich which goes against my ordering any sort of steak sandwich outside of Philly.  This 'steak sandwich' came fresh with some sort of steak topped with onion straws, some mayo and cauliflower.  Cauliflower on a sandwich?  Yeah it was not good.. The fries were tasty but standard and the grease did make me feel a little bit better.   We left after taking some pics of the view (the reason for the 3 stars) and paying our way higher than it should be bill.  8.50 for a Heineken bottle?  Really?",0.6847,0.903,0.064,0.033,0.4174603174603175

The rest... The service is ABYSMAL! For $15 drink prices you'd think that the service would be a little better, but it's the worst I've experienced in a long time. My gf and I sat there for 15min after being seated before our waitress showed up for the first time to take our drink order (on a napkin). 10 min later a different waitress comes up and asks for our order again saying the shift was about to change and she couldn't get our order from the other waitress (probably because they all use napkins, which is extremely unprofessional, could a place called the signature room really not afford a paper pad at least?)   Drinks were served 5min later. So it took a total of 30min from the moment we sat down to the time we finally got our first drinks. Hope you have a ton of patients if you want to go there.  Then we wanted to order an appetizer, our waitress was no where to be found for the next 20min. I'm not exaggerating, I even got up to ask the hostess if our waitress was around. He said ""yeah, she's coming"" and did absolutely nothing to go find her or try and see if we needed anything. He just stood there and went back to doing nothing. There are no bus boys so don't expect for your table to be cleaned after finishing your drinks or food. Tables stay dirty until another guest arrives and they clean them right before seating you. When we got up to take pictures they even tried seating another couple at our table even though we hadn't even left. This place is heavily understaffed and overpriced. Each waitress has several tables to tend to and your patience will be heavily tested. Save yourself the trouble and frustration and just go to the observatory room for the view.

You are allowed to order multiples - they have a handful of breakfast and lunch items. I ordered the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes with blueberries and it was one of the best breakfasts I've ever tasted. If they would have let me sit there and let my food settle for another hour or two, I would have ordered the same thing over again. SO good! I've never anything like it.

2012-05-26,5.0,"I've heard of snacking while high - but this brings high to a whole new level - 95 levels to be precise! One of the first things we were told while on vacation to the amazing city of Chicago - was to try and get into the Signature room on the 95th. This restaurant is located in the John Hancock Centre and was the neighboring building to our hotel (Awesome). On our last night we decided we wanted a deadly meal (craving steak to be honest being a meat eatin' Albertan), so we gave them a call to see if they had room. Voila - a reso has been made. Unable to contain our excitement, we get all dolled up for our exciting dinner adventure to the top of one of the tallest towers in the US. We arrive and are quickly (almost scary quickly) whipped up 95 stories in a rocket of an elevator with the ears-a-poppin the entire time. We arrive, walk out, and near faint. The floor to ceiling glass windows of the two story entrance was breathtaking. Truly a view to die for. We could see across a couple states and atop all of the tallest towers the US has, and we were above most of them. We regain our composure and quickly get seated by the host. Our table was one in from the window (bummer), which was quickly remedied when the table by the window got up and left and we asked for their seat (bummer fixed). I was now sitting 6 inches from a direct drop to the earth, only separated by a sheet of glass. Needless to say it took me what felt like forever to even open the menu as we could see EVERYTHING (picture in my profile). Pictures taken, gasps under control, we get down to business - we're here to EAT! Our server was very attentive from the start and offered various waters for us to choose from, took our drink order (a delicious bottle of red was chosen), and we ordered our starters. I had a spring onion soup which was a cream soup with a crustini and cheese topping and was so fresh and delicious. I thoroughly enjoyed its size and taste as a starting dish. For the main I had a filet with side of asparagus and whipped potatoes (they were a la carte). Surprisingly the portion was much bigger than expected - and of course, not to complain - more tenderloin is far better than not enough. It was cooked the MOST PERFECT medium rare this side of the border and had an amazing jus under it for dipping and flavor. To be honest, I eat steak whenever I travel and I have to admit, this filet was the best I have EVER had outside of Alberta and was very comparable to steaks I would have had at home in fine restaurants. This to me is a huge compliment to the chef here. The potatoes were a simple whipped potato and for some reason was the best I have eaten. I don't know what they did but we all thought it was amazing (lots of butter maybe? Special magical butter?...).

I went to the Signature Room at the recommendation of my supervisor, who lives in Chicago (I was just visiting on business).  I actually went up to the 96th floor first, thinking we would just have a drink, but the pricing was so reasonable that we decided to stay for dinner on the 95th.   The Signature Room in the Hancock building was not what I expected... First of all, it is much more touristy than I had realized...far from the upscale, chic environment I had painted in my mind.   We got a great seat near a window (beware that the glare of the sun can be quite harsh, so be sure that you are seated facing a window that does not put the sun in your eyes).  I really enjoyed the view.  It was so much fun to look out the window at the other sky scrapers that looked small by comparison. I ordered the scallops with beat coulis  My boyfriend ordered a filet that was hopelessly overcooked (it was medium well when he asked for rareplus/medrare...to anyone who likes their steaks rare/medrare, you know that medium well just isn't the same).  He mentioned it to our server when she asked him how his steak was.  She just kinda got him to a place where he said that it was OK.  No manager was sent over to followup on how the meal was, Nada.  Not too classy, and, again, not what I expected.   The three stars are for the great location, pretty interior and the fact that I thought my scallop dish warranted kudos to the chef.  Otherwise, the food was not well prepared or memorable and the service was lackluster.   If I had a redo, I would just order desert or an appetizer and enjoy the view, then collect my check and leave.  Until their service and food matches their location, the Signature Room does not warrant a stay for dinner.",0.9939,0.794,0.165,0.041,0.5328502415458938

A table was ready at the appointed time, but it was on the dark side (after 8 p.m.) so we asked to be moved to a more festive location with a better view; our request was accommodated with a few minutes wait, and all in the party were pleased with the new view. The food was excellent if a bit pricey. $42 for a ""choice grade"" filet is pricey even in the best restaurants, at this price point accompaniments should be included (Bearnaise sauce, potato vegetable) but otherwise the food was four star in my book. The wine list is generally excellent and our waiter, Greg, had a good knowledge of the wine list, and we did end up ordering 3 bottles of differing excellent wines. Wine prices were standard for this type of restaurant.

If you want a window seat you have to wait longer, and from what I heard, you have to ask them when you arrive, not when you make the reservation.  We arrived a bit early, were told it would be a 45 minute wait for a window seat, but it only ended up being about 20 minutes.  Not bad, not bad.  There are three views from this place when you get off the elevator.  Glass wall on the far right: best view of the shoreline plus skyscrapers. Glass wall directly in front: all ocean: probably best for brunch when it looks like more than just a black space.  Glass wall all the way to the left: shoreline + city lights, but definitely not as impressive as the window on the right.  Food: Seafood risotto was great!! Not a super salty dish, definitely for the milder taste. Well made.  Black lentil salmon was perfection!! Crispy on the outside, super soft and moist on the inside, perfectly complimented with the black lentils.  The cheese plate was not so impressive.  It was a bit like throwing some cheddar, provolone, and brie on a plate with  an assortment of store bought crackers.  People: I actually didn't see a whole lot of other dates going on. There were several business dinners, a huge foreign tourist group, a few friendly catchup sessions going on, a few dates. Service: Great service from what I remember.  We asked the waiter to take a picture of  us at the end and he was really good.  The first one came out too bright from the flash without a good image of the view, but he tinkered with it, used a thin white paper to spread the light out and voila! much better picture! Thank you art school for supplyings with wonderful waiters! Conclusion: Wait for a window seat if you're into that, go up to the 96th floor lounge while you wait (there's a good view from up there if you can get one of the window seats.  If you order appetizers they're really nice and will let you know a table opened and bring down your appetizer so you can finish it at your table without rushing you.

If competing, Signature Room would've been sent packing - but I'll revisit that.  I've lived in the Chicago area my whole life and have only been to the lounge once; local tourist meccas aren't really my thing. What made me change my tune was an opportunity to lunch with some of my favorite ladies and a $20 prix fixe deal. Arriving just before the prime lunch hour, we were greeted and quickly seated by a window. Honestly, if you can't get a table right at the window, I wouldn't bother hanging around. TIP: If you go on a sunny day, wear layers - it was h.o.t., hot up in there! We perused the $20 lunch special and ordered our starter, entree and dessert all at once. I went with the smoked trout dip, cod with lentils, and caramel apple sundae. While we waited on our appetizers, we were served warm, crusty bread; a highlight of my meal (but I am a sucker for bread). Our appetizers came quickly; the smoked trout dip was good, but four tiny slices of baguette (more like melba toast) were not enough for this dish. Sadly, I didn't see the bread guy or our server during that time, so I ate the bulk of my dip with my fork. The mixed greens accompanying it were a nice, little palate cleanser when I finished. Things started to falter after our starter. I'm not a lady of leisure, I've got to work and as such I don't have time for long, lingering weekday lunches. After a long wait for our entrees and concerned looks at the time, we asked our server for an update on our meal; we also asked to switch desserts, taking chocolate tarts to go. Our meals, packaged desserts and check came out shortly thereafter. Getting back to my Top Chef reference, my entree was a bust. While moist, the cod was completely flavorless. The was no hint of acid, fat, salt, pepper - anything. The lentils beneath the fish and the scant, decorative streaks of salsa verde did nothing to inject flavor into the dish. I halfheartedly ate my plate of blandness before heading back to work, had I not been pressed for time, I probably would've asked them to fix the dish. The chocolate tart, later eaten at my desk where the view isn't so nice, was packaged perfectly for my mad dash back to the office. Generous in size, the tart was good, but extremely rich - I felt like I was in sugar shock when I finished it.  A few fresh raspberries were packaged with my tart, I wish there were more to balance it out.

Let's just get this out of the way.  Yes, the view is amazing and we lucked out by choosing a clear day so it was pretty much as good as it gets.  Now that that's done...

After the other families in the waiting area were called, we were finally shown to our table.  It was a nice table by the window so I guess it was worth the wait.  My first big decision was what to drink.  Judging by our experience up to that point, I was a little scared and was just looking for the cocktail I thought would be the least likely to be screwed up.  I chose Bombay Sapphire, straight up...and it still wasn't right.  Oh dear. We decided to come in for the $20 three course prix fixe lunch.  I chose the smoked trout dip and the roasted cod with lentils and salsa verde.  My bf chose the butternut squash soup and the cassoulet.  My meal was definitely the winner this time around.  The smoked trout dip was actually pretty good and the cod, while the presentation was nothing special, was tasty.  I don't think I've ever seen my bf not finish anything but he barely touched the soup.  His cassoulet was pretty much glorified pork and beans, with overcooked pork.  Not great. For dessert we both had the caramel apple sundae.  It was basically vanilla ice cream with butterscotch syrup and apples.  I love ice cream so it was ok. Basically, there's nothing wrong with this place.  Our server was nice enough and the food was decent.  The vibe was all wrong though.  I couldn't scratch the feeling that we were in a hurried, cafeteria-like setting.  Much like the Walnut Room around Christmas.  Lots of people running around, staff trying to get you out asap and overpriced food that is just above adequate.  I'm glad I finally went but I think it's one and done for me.",0.9896,0.799,0.142,0.059,0.6279478458049887

The brunch is set up with a buffet area featuring seafood, cheese, some salads, fruit and a dessert station.  Then there is a menu with dishes on it and you can order as many as you would like. Buffet food: I loved the seafood station.  Shrimp, fresh shucked oysters, and many types of smoked fish (the smoked salmon was my favorite).  I could have made a whole breakfast out of only this!   Other standouts included the beet and blue cheese salad.  The cheese selection was pretty standard but tasty.   The desserts were pretty good, I enjoyed my chocolate macaroon.   For my main course, I ordered duck confit and sweet potato pierogies.  Not my typical brunch food, but very good.  The main courses were the perfect size, a medium sized taste.  For the heavier eaters, you could always order more courses.  Our table also got a bunch of sides: bacon, cauliflower gratin, and potatoes.  The potatoes were particularly good with a very crunchy exterior.   This place is a relaxing way to enjoy a Sunday morning.  Go to enjoy the breathtaking views of Chicago!",0.9957,0.731,0.269,0.0,0.6100617283950618

Sad to say the meal & service didn't meet the $100/plate price tag. The appetizers were well designed & tasty, those were a win, however, the soup & salad course left much to be desired. The lobster soup was luke warm and tasteless. The salad had crisp greens but I had to stop eating it half way thru because the vinegar in the dressing was overpowering & burning my tongue. The steak was excellent but dessert fell apart. Please keep in mind this was a pre-fix menu so we had limited choices. The pallet cleanser of passion fruit soup, again, was so tart that it hurt my tongue. The chocolate tart was well crafted but lacked any sort of flavor development. Not a very satisfying end to a meal. We were also disappointed that our pre-ordered chocolate covered strawberries never arrived. The server removed them from out bill & when we spoke to the manager about it he said, rather sharply, ""well if you were still at your table I could do something about it."" Realize that we were waiting at the elevator to leave & had not put on our coats, the table we had sat at (which was right next to the stairs, a table like this should not exist in an establishment like this) was still empty, we might as well still have been at it.

She offered me several choices, and as I wanted this meeting to be memorable, I went for the big one, The Signature Room. We were seated immediately upon our arrival stepping out of the elevator on the 95th floor, even though we didn't have a reservation and it was about 12:20 p.m. or so, and we were given a wonderful window table, overlooking Navy Pier. I was overjoyed. The restaurant itself is very lovely, even though you don't spend a lot of time looking around at the interior at lunch. It was a beautiful day, and we could see for miles out over the lake. Our server was incredibly professional and solicitous and we felt very pampered and relaxed.  My friend started with a mojito, and I nursed a glass of wine throughout our meal. I had so much trouble choosing from the menu because so many things looked delicious. I almost went for the black angus burger, but I settled on the Thai chicken salad ($15), which is mixed greens, herbs, peanuts, spicy pickled daikon, ginger aioli and toasted almond vinaigrette. It really was delicious, and large! I could not eat the whole thing, but I was so glad I chose it for all its fresh tastiness and delightful mix of flavors and textures. My friend ordered the $20 three-course Signature lunch special ($20) and had soup, a pork main dish and a lovely apple-carmel dessert. I decided to join her for a sweet, and had the delightful sorbets, and I got to choose my three flavors. I don't remember all my choices, except the mango, which was exquisite! Of course, it's the whole experience here that makes it, and we were pleased with every aspect of our visit. We lingered a long time over our meal to talk and catch up and were never made to feel rushed or unwelcome. We had coffee after the meal, and everyone seemed eager to make sure we were comfortable and had what we needed. After we finished, my friend walked me around the perimeter to show me various Chicago landmarks in the skyline, including her apartment building on Lake Shore Drive.

A $20 3-course prix fixe lunch in great company was the lure, and I fell for it. And while it was fun, I must say that the view impresses far more than the food. ""Wagyu"" steak frites served with non-crispy fries. An overdressed spinach salad with beets (because they ran out of the smoked salmon). A super rich chocolate pot de creme. All is fine when you're only forking over $20 at lunch for this meal, but I've heard that dinner can get quite spendy. So, people looking to me blown away by the food, don't come here. DO come here however, for the view. I thought I wasn't afraid of heights... until my palms became all sweaty in the elevator ride up to the 95th.... And then I looked out the window. Let's just say I stayed away from the glass (which should be cleaned BTW - are there spidermen who do that? scary job!) Service was very friendly, but the pacing was all off. Entrees came out before people were done with their salads, and then there was a long wait for dessert. Still, instead of making us choose from the prix fixe menu, our server let us choose from the entire dessert menu, which I thought was a nice touch.  Come here when you have family in town and want to show them a view of this glorious city.

After thinking a lot about the options I decided for The Signature Room at the 95th, especially for its amazing view and because it was a good fit to my idea of having a very special night for the two of us. For this night (December 31st) they had prepared two seatings with very different menus and prices. We went for the first seating which was very pricy, but nothing like the second seating.  We arrived at the time arranged and were promptly seated in a very good table with a great view of the city and Navy Pier. The food was well done; although, far from spectacular. We had to pay for the drinks, but not for taxes and gratuities that were already included in the price of the three courses menu. From the three courses, the higest key was the dessert: creative, good mix of flavours and textures, and festive. A good selection for that night. Because the seating was at 6pm and we had two hours ""to complete our experience""(as the confirmation email informed) we found ourselves all set by 8pm... 4 hours before midnight. Since we had to leave the dinning room, we decided to go and explore how things were going on the 96th where the lounge and bar is located.

The view is quite remarkable, we were on the side overlooking the lake.  There is a fair amount of room between tables, so it was comfortable.  Decor, provided largely by Mother Nature with lots of human interference, rates a solid 5.  The lounge on the 96th floor is worth visiting as well for an even better view, right up against the windows.

My wife had Waygu steak frites, which she said was excellent, grilled to perfection, accompanied by garlic aioli and herb butter.  I had the portabella sandwich (grilled portabella with sauteed spinach on a pretzel roll HOLD THE PECORINO CHEESE) which was delicious, a real surprise and healthy to boot!  For dessert we split a ""chocolate pot de creme"" which was sinfully rich, perfect, and a white and dark chocolate mouse cake which could not hold a candle to the pot de creme.   The wine list was interesting but somewhat pricey.  Three glasses of wine, two glasses of soda, and all of the above with a 20 percent tip (other than the lack of promptness with the bruschetta the remainder of the service was good) came to $160.  Given the view, as well as the food quality, I thought this to be a fair price.  I would definitely return, but not if I were in a hurry.",0.9983,0.77,0.217,0.013,0.5123959673959674

Good variety, in general. No objections.

I took a glass of grapefruit juice from him and the glass turned out to have a little crack in the lip of it. No biggie; I drank out of the other side. When someone came to clear the glass from the table, they asked me in an accusatory tone if I'd broken the glass. Startled, I said I hadn't. I wish I'd said I'd done it, because I then had to watch this guy yell at the poor Chinese man for giving me a broken glass - waving it in his face, etc. Ugh!

We had a pretty large group - 10 total w/ 4 kids 11 or under on a Saturday afternoon with no reservations and surprisingly we were seated pretty quickly. The server came up to us and basically said that with large groups they normally just do the buffet. I looked at her and said ""seriously?"" I was instantly irritated. Don't tell me what I am going to eat. I am not a buffet eater and I was seriously put off at being told what I would be ordering.  My sister saw my reaction & asked if the buffet was a requirement and the server said no so we asked for a few menu's while those in the group who like buffets got the buffet - which was actually 6 of the 10.  I got the angus burger w/ aged cheddar. Unfortunately the cheddar was the best part of the burger. I asked for it to be medium and another person in my group got one well done. They looked exactly the same in the middle.  When we asked for refills on our soda - only 2 of 10 had soda - it took at minimum 15 minutes to get the refill and at that point I had about a bite left of my meal. I really think I was being punished for not wanting the buffet.  Overall the food was decent but not the best I have ever had for sure.  Only one of the 3 elevators seemed to be in use so we had to wait about 20 min to get an elevator back down after eating & the guy working the elevator clearly hates is job and wanted to be somewhere else.

Working with Tracy, our event coordinator, was a dream come true. She made everything so easy! I did all the planning from a different city (and much of it from a different country), so being able to communicate with Tracy was key. She always e-mailed me back promptly, and she is super friendly on the phone and in person! Basically anything we asked for (the design of the cake, how many chairs to setup for the ceremony, color-coding our placecards to denote main entrees), she was like, ""Sure, no problem, we can do that."" On the day of, Kevin was our floor manager and made sure everything went smoothly, overseeing the smallest details that we hadn't even thought about (like who's going to roll up your aisle runner during the transition to cocktail hour? He will!). 2. The food is amazing amazing AMAZING. Everyone kept raving about the sweet corn soup, the frisée salad, the elegant and surprising champagne sorbet, the main entrees (moist chicken, delicious salmon, or creamy risotto), and of course the cake! If you're a food-centric couple, the Signature Room exceeds all expectations. We also had a complimentary menu tasting a few months earlier, so you get to choose which menu and cake options are your fave. 3. The event space is beautiful and intimate (we had about 70 people). Our windows faced the northwest view, so we got a magnificent blue and orange sunset, followed by the sparkling lights of the city below. The rooms are tastefully decorated, with soft uplighting, so table decorations were a cinch. Everyone loved the views, especially the out-of-towners who now think Chicago is da bomb, and the romantic atmosphere lent well to mingling and dancing. 4. The clientele is classy and friendly. Maybe part of it was that I was sitting in the powder room with my giant white dress on, waiting for the ceremony to start, but every woman who walked in gave me a GIANT smile and congratulations. I even celebrated with a few who were either celebrating their own anniversaries or engagements! 5. The price. We got a lot of comments from people saying, ""Oh wow, the Hancock? You guys must be spending a lot!!"" But honestly, the value was unbeatable. I had shopped around a couple of other venues before finding the Signature Room, and for what it gave in terms of food, atmosphere, and ease, it loomed far above any other. (Tee hee.) We were also able to save on so many elements simply because the Signature Room included it. For example, we didn't have to spend big on decorations because the view pretty much did it all.

Once we arrived, we requested for a window table. The hostess was very courteous and seated us at a corner table next to the floor-to-ceiling windows. The south-facing view made it all worth it. The food is like that of any mid-tier steakhouse. The quail that I got was savory but nothing memorable. My fiance got the grilled steak like any typical guy. The steak was cooked as ordered and was enjoyable. In the end, my fiance surprised me with a slice of tiramisu that had ""Happy Anniversary"" written on the plate. Again, the food did not blow me out of the water. But if you are looking for a romantic dinner spot on a clear night, I say give it a try.",0.9806,0.803,0.197,0.0,0.6055555555555556

For the most part the food and the service has been excellent along with the spectacular views.  I'm afraid that my Brunch experience a couple of weeks ago was not up to the usual 5 star experience that I'm used to when dinning at The Signature Room. They used to have bottomless Champagne as part of the brunch many years ago. I understand that times are tough and that's no longer possible these days. They used to have the Stone Crab Claws already shucked for you. I SPECIFICALLY  asked over the phone if that item was still part of the brunch before I made reservations. Apparently the Alaskan King Crab claws which are puny and inferior to the Stone Crab claws have replaced the Stone Crab Claws. It's like comparing a bicycle (Alaskan Crab Claws) to a High Performance Sports Car (Stone Crab Claws). There's no comparison Mr Chef. I'm guessing the Stone Crab Claws are probably out of season. Enough of my rant. The rest of the food was alright, but I was on a major downer trying to find a go to dish after the Crab Claw fiasco. I'm still giving the Signature Room 4 stars since this has been the only snafu given the 20-30 other times I have dined at The Signature Room. I'll try again next year when I travel to Chicago.

2011-09-15,1.0,"Walked in with a lot of expectations, And was very disapointed. We came here for my parent's 30th wedding anniversary. They were visiting from out of town and my dad wanted to impress my mother with a special place.  Well, the location of course is perfect, you can really ask for a better view, if you can actually see something. I called 3 days before to make the reservation and I said it was for a weddin anniversary. I called again the day before, and mentionned it was my parents 30th wedding anniversary, and wanted to arrange for a cake to be prepared. Apparently you need 48hrs notice for a cake. Thanks for telling me the first time I called, me telling you it was a special occasion, you could have tried to upsell me something and at the same time give me pretty important information. Anyway, on this second phone call, I told the guy we wanted a window seat. I knew this is not something we could guarantee, but just told him we will be OK waiting for a table. My parents are not people to complain or ask for stuff, so I told the reservationist to please put that note on the reservation so we don't have the conversation again when we arrive. Of course, when we at 7.50pm for a 8pm reservation, we were told we would have to wait 15mins. So I say, for a table by the window? And he said no, that would be much longer and repeated the speech on how they can not guarantee table by the window. OK, thanks, I understand that, but thank you for communicating within your team too. So we go up to the bar, wait 10mins to be seated. The host was SO unpleasant. I guess you're busy and the place is full, but don't talk to people that way. And shouldn't you be used to this crazyness by now?! We then wait 15mins to have someone approach our table with drinks list. Another 20 mins for someone to take our order. 15 mins later (we are already at 45mins wait since we made it at 7.50pm), the restaurant host came to tell us the table was ready. Oh thank you, what about our drinks?? 5 mins, we get the bill, and another 10 mins, we get out drink and bring them to our table, $60.00 worth of drinks,that it took 1hr to get! Pretty bad start right?! The meal went fine. Foodwise, it was good, but for the price I think we were expecting more. We ended up getting a table by the window, but on the north east side, so at 9pm, the only thing we could see what a dark lake. And the only person at our table facing south east could see Navy Pier. The service was ok. The waiter took our order, delivered everything on time. The runners were doing their job. The only thing missing was a smile. Yes, everyone was doing their job, but no smile, no ""enjoy your meal"" no ""how's everything going?"". A table behind us started complaining about something, I didn't get what it was about. But they ended up being moved to a better tablAne, and got a round of drinks offered. We did not say anything, hoping for someone to realize that things were not going too well. We just are not people who believe in making a scene to get what you want. I guess we were wrong. Anyway, I will not be back. And will not recommend the signature room. I used to go to the bar everytime I had visitors from out of town, I will probably change that too in the future.

2011-09-03,3.0,"I was so excited to take my sister out for dinner during our short trip to Chicago. Our reservations were for 8:30pm and I knew that our view was going to be incredible. The hostess was very friendly and earlier in the day when they called to confirm the reservation they were friendly. We were hoping for a window seat but it was an additional 45 minute wait and we were starving and tired from walking all day.  The view did not disappoint but I would say the food wasn't as good as I expected it to be.  The restaurant supports locally grown produce which I am a big fan.  We ordered bruschetta as an appetizer. It was pretty minimal and not what I think of when I order bruschetta. It was basically a sprig of  greens on a 2 mm slice of rye bread with a small smear of goat cheese. It didn't have much flavor. It was very disappointing as I love bruschetta and often make this in different varieties at home. My sister had that shellfish risotto. It was just ok. The risotto was undercooked and not creamy like it should be. There was suppose to be crab in the dish also but we had a hard time finding it. There was plenty of shrimp and scallops though. I had the scallops with a beet salad which again was average.  Our server was a bit rushed. It seemed like he was rushing us to order but then when we were ready for our check, we wait for 10-15 minutes for him to drop back by and bring the check.  Another downer was the lighting was so dim that you could hardly see the menu or appreciate the way your dish looked. I get they are trying to create a romantic mood but you should be able to see your plate. One dim candle is not adequate. For the view, I give this place a 4 star but for the price and the food I give it 2.5 stars.  If I had to do this over again, I would bypass dinner and just grab a quick drink at the signature lounge, take a few pictures, and leave.",0.92,0.808,0.112,0.081,0.4919892473118279
2011-08-30,2.0,"I came here for Sunday brunch when my aunt and uncle were in town.  We made a reservation weeks in advance (I don't think it is necessary that far ahead but my aunt is a planner) for 10 people.  I was really excited as I've been to the Observation level but not the signature room. We arrived and were seated at a round table which was nice so we could have table wide conversations.  We waited a bit for our waiter to come and he took our drink orders.  I ordered a mimosa and diet coke.  The mimosa wasn't really worth it - I would have preferred Andre and OJ at Nookie's Tree. Brunch is a buffet so we all made our way to the other room where the buffet was for round one.  Overall, I was disappointed in the buffet.  The layout was poor for the traffic flow and there wasn't much room to maneuver around people.   The food was also lackluster.  I filled my plate before making it past the seafood table.  Everything I had was good and wish I had stuck to that table.  The next round I made it to the lunch section.  I pick up some squash that had no flavor and was oily, so I didn't eat more than one bite.  The roasted potatoes were good.  The carving station's NY strip was very dry and bland.  The rolls were as to be expected, but I don't like whipped butter and that was all they had (and it was unsalted - yuck!).  I also have a salt obsession and the lack of salt anywhere was very disappointing to me especially since some of the food could have really used it.  I went for dessert for my third and final round.  First of all, some of the serving utensils didn't make sense for what they were paired with and made it difficult to get the mini desserts on the plate.  Nothing blew me away and only the oreo cupcake I remember as not being very good. The service was also very poor for such an expensive brunch and at a place with a dress code.  I had to ask the waiter multiple times for water refills after my glass had been empty for quite some time and there was even, and I don't know the proper name, a waiter's helper.  I also never received the diet coke previously mentioned.  Unfortunately for us our party was so large so they already added gratuity at a percentage which was very undeserved to the bill. When you are spending close to $100 a person (tip, tax, beverage) I would expect much better service. I usually don't mention restrooms unless they are very good or very bad and I was very disappointed in the restrooms.  Again, based on pricing, location, and dress code I have expectations for quality and cleanliness.  The restrooms were not very modern (save the hand dryers) and they were not cleaned or well maintained.   Not worth the money.  Save it and just go to the 96th floor for a drink the same view - you'll be much less disappointed.",-0.9204,0.811,0.081,0.108,0.5383519875186542

2011-08-22,1.0,"I went here with my family over the weekend to have brunch and watch the Air and Water show.  It was a big deal because we were bringing my 79 year old grandfather, who is a former pilot.  We knew he would love to watch the planes!  We called 5 months in advance for our reservation, but were told we could only make a reservation 3 months in advance.  This was fine and 3 months later we called to book our reservation at 10am for 12 people for a seat near the north/east window.  The lady who made the reservation told us that the elevator would start running at 9:45am and to get in line early because the window seating is first come first serve.  We were so excited when we arrived to the elevators to find out that we were first in line and would be able to get our window seat.  At 9:45 the elevators started running.  We took the elevator up with a group of other people, only to find that seating did not begin until 10:15, which means that it really didn't matter where we were in line.  The reservations were not first come first serve!  As it turns out, the staff already had chosen tables for the reservations that were made and we were not able to choose the table that we had previously requested!  Brunch at the Signature Room is $130 per person!  While spending that kind of money and having 12 people in my group, I strongly felt disappointed and angry that I was lead to believe that it was first come, first serve.  The staff was not willing to change our table or help us in any.  In fact, she told us she was ""sad because we were angry"".  This was a speical event for my grandfather that was ruined because we were given a table where we could not see the planes.  Horrible service is not acceptalbe anywhere, but add in the expensive price tag and I will never return here again.  There are plenty of amazing resturants in Chicago with great service and I suggest you to go elsewhere!",0.6141,0.868,0.071,0.061,0.5487745098039214
2011-08-21,1.0,"Air & Water Show - No Guarantee!!!!!  Don't do a Family Event here.... Please read -  I called and made a reservation for the Signature Room for Brunch for the morning of the Chicago Air and Water Show.  I called and made this reservation 60 days (the soonest they allow it) before the date of the Air and Water show,  and was looking forward to a memorable family event.   When I called, I was told that I was the first reservation and that there were no reservations before mine.  I asked  to make a reservation for a table of 12 near window and was told that a table that size would not be near a window, but was told that 3 tables of 4 could be seated at the windows, so I made the reservation for 3 tables of 4.   In the weeks prior to our date, I called the Signature twice to confirm that our reservation was correct, and was assured that everything was fine.   The day our reservation,  I called again and spoke to the manager.  She told me that  that we would not be seated near the windows but at a large table seating 12 in the back of the restaurant (very minimal view of the air show)  She told me that there was no note/or reservation for 3 tables of 4, and acted as if she didn't believe me.   She also told me that the Signature Room seats specifically to the number of the reservation - so our table would be for 12 people.   She had no concern or made any effort to find out why this miscommunication had occurred.   There was little I could do at this point.  I had spent 250.00 on a limo and the guests were on their way, and it was too late to cancel.  When we got to the restaurant, we asked if we could split the reservation between 3 parties so we could sit next to the window, and were again turned down. In addition, I was shocked when the same manager argued with me in front of other guests, while repeating over and over that ""every customer was equally important"".  She had no interest in bringing any satisfaction or resolution to the problem - we didn't matter. We were ultimately seated at two tables of 6 in the back of the restaurant, near the window and saw next to nothing of the air show. The weather was beautiful that day,but our day was completely overshadowed by the fact that we stuck paying $550.00 on a day  that was a big disappointment and we didn't understand why we had been treated so unfairly.   And out of fairness, let me say this.  The Signature Room is all about the beautiful view.  If you are a couple or group of four, the Brunch is very good, ($45.00/pp) and they should be able to accommodate you.  You might be able to have a romantic dinner near the windows with the view, albeit the dinner menu (see below). We were trying to do something memorable in honor of a family member, and received very little regard from the Signature Room staff.  They don't get it and it ruined our event.  They are not prepared or equipped to handle a larger group. Given the mixed reviews I am reading, I can only assume that the management is poor and inconsistent.  I have been there twice now for the brunch, and I do think it's very good. (Get there early and take the 9:45 elevator up)   The brunch waiters were very attentive.  However, I have also been there for dinner, and the food is overpriced and I thought everything was really salty and not that great.  Dinner waiters appear to be overwhelmed, and made us feel secondary. In conclusion, if you want to go to the Signature Room with a larger group and want to sit by the windows, split up into group of four or less, - do not expect your tables together.  You might get lucky, but there is no guarantee. I won't be going back.  I am angry, disappointed and don't understand what happened, so if you go, I wish you luck.  Not only did the manager, (whose name begins and ends with and ""A""), lose me as a customer, but she lost the other ten guests that were with me and our exponential referrals when we relate our unfortunate experience to them.",-0.5007,0.826,0.085,0.089,0.5199248866213152
2011-08-19,2.0,"Breathtaking view but banal tasting food.  Taste of food outweighs everything else for me, so it gets 2 stars. The other factors would get a 4 or 5.  I've been here twice. The first time was 4th of July weekend in 2010. I was mesmerized by the spectacular birds-eye view of Chicago. My girlfriend made a reservation a few days beforehand, and luckily, we were given which we thought was one of the best seats in the house. We sat on the second floor in the center close to the window, and our table faced directly at the 4th of July fireworks from Navy Pier. If you want the perfect ambiance, view, and firework show, then go 4th of July weekend. We were delighted by the fireworks until people started hovering around our table, and in front of us. Not only was it difficult to see the fireworks, but made us really uncomfortable to eat our food, too.  Food: We ordered duck dumplings for appetizer. One entree of seared alaskan halibut and one bacon wrapped berkshire pork tenderloin. And a side of grilled mushrooms. My girlfriend also got a glass of red wine. For dessert, we ordered the macaroons with ice-cream, and told them it was our 2 year anniversary, so they put ""happy anniversary"" on the plate. That was cute! We also got a lot of weird looks for that, but I guess we asked for it haha. We got plenty of laughs out of it though so it's all good. Presentation and service was good, but all our dishes were too bland tasting. There was no flavor or sauce in my halibut dish, and it was kinda dry. I added tons of salt and pepper to compensate for the lack of flavor.  Everything cost about $130 before tips, which is reasonable for a high-end restaurant. I wish I tried their cocktails, too bad I was hungover like crazy.  Second time: Came here again during mid-may of this year (2011). We wanted to grab a quick bite and some drinks at the Signature Lounge, and hoped to enjoy some spectacular view. The weather was awful this day. When we got to the 95th floor, we saw nothing but fog from outside, so we used their restroom and left hahaha.   My two cents: Since the taste of the food is what brings customers back, I will say I'll never return for their food. If you want to check out this place, I suggest you go to the Signature Lounge for drinks and appetizers instead. It's one level above Signature room. You get the same view as Signature Room, and will only spend half the amount. Both places are great for dates since the ambiance is so romantic. It's also pretty exciting riding up the elevator to the 95th floor just to grab dinner and drinks!!  Warning: Don't bother going up here on a rainy, windy day hoping to see the view of Chicago. You'll at most see your reflection in the window, and that's it.  For those who opt out of the Willis Tower and come to Signature Lounge just to check out the Chicago view for free, I can tell you the Willis Tower is worth every penny. It's a completely different experience at Willis. You learn the history, experience the walk on the glass of ""death"", and see a much grander and holistic view of Chicago. Both are worth checking out for different reasons.",0.9979,0.782,0.166,0.052,0.544871794871795

Ultimately, I won't go back there nor would I recommend it.  I was not naive to the fact that it is a definite tourist attraction.  However, as a Michelin honored restaurant and one that is know for its cuisine, being a tourist trap should be irrelevant.  What an unfortunate place.   On the bright side, service was good.  So basically, I paid $150 for good service.  Now I feel better.",0.9572,0.734,0.158,0.108,0.6354061895551258

First, the food.  It was pretty nice.  I got the Grilled Portabello sandwich.    No complaints there.  I wish we could have gotten the normal (caramel or something?) cheesecake that they serve in the lounge, rather than the vanilla bean, but there was no time to go to both and the vanilla bean certainly wasn't bad. Next, the views.  You really can't tell how big (or flat!) Chicago is until you get to that height.  The views were absolutely spectacular!   **And word to the wise: When you're making your reservation, make sure to say you want a window seat!**  It's not detrimental if you don't -- there are certainly plenty of other spots to see the view if you don't sit by the window -- but it would probably have made for an EVEN nicer dining experience.   That being said, **the window from the Ladies' Room is the best spot in the house for great pictures!** And finally, the service.  That was probably the best part of the visit.  According to my receipt, my server's name was Liane.  On top of indulging my chronic inability to make a decision, she gave us honest reviews (I asked her to choose between two differently priced options, and she said she preferred the cheaper one.  That always makes me happy).  She let me order a bit off-menu.  And at the end of the meal, she got us the chance to move up to the Lounge by a window seat to get the cheesecake we wanted.  Unfortunately, there wasn't time for it, but I was really impressed by how much she went out of her way.   For me, a 20% tip is usually reserved for above and beyond service, and she totally earned it.

My fiance, I love saying that, ordered his standard mojito and I ordered my fave champagne, Vueve. A mere 35 minutes later, we were sitting on the north side of the restaurant facing Montrose Harbor. It was breathtaking.  Javier, our server, gave top-notch service. We dined like kings and queens on the raw bar for two which had shrimp, lobster, crab and some aphrodisiacs, oysters. We polished it off. Next, we had the lavendar scented roasted leg of lamb with polenta and wild asparagus and the cocoa dusted seared scallops with beets and a side of the truffled orzo with marscapone. The two entrees were delicious. The lamb was the winner of the evening. The orzo dish was good, but good ole Javie described it as a truffle mac n cheese. *Buzzer sound* Not quite.  We skipped dessert and opted for more libations. Again, Mr. Mojito drank another and I had the Lake Shore Tini a concotion Grey Goose Vodka, Marquis de la Tour sparkling wine, and raspberry liqueur.  We snapped a few photo ops, then Javier came with some sorbet and a sparkler with the words ""Congrats on your Engagement"" on the plate.

For two people we spent around $150, but could have easily gone up to $200 depending on the food choices and such. We started with drinks, which took a while to get to us, but I was in no particular rush since I was distracted by the view. The Ice Blue martini tasted like koolaid and should probably be replaced by any other martini (Apple Martini?). After that I ordered some type of manhattan that was farrrrrr better and very delicious. I strongly recommend that drink if you're getting one.  My company ordered an Old Fashion that he enjoyed. You do get these lovely little bread rolls and some nice butter to snack on as well. The first ones we got were not very warm and slightly stale. When they gave us seconds it was fresher and warmer than the first. I regret not asking for some olive oil to dip it in though. We had a brochette goat cheese appetizer. Upon seeing them I thought they looked pretty, but that they must taste terrible. Surprisingly they were very tasty and after finishing the appetizer both I was impressed. For the main course I got the scottish salmon that was very good. The temperature and freshness were perfect. Whatever they place the salmon on top of; however, was not good at all. They were like tiny bland black peas. I had wished I could substitute them for the cheesy grit type platform my company had under his chicken. They definitely overcharge for the food and don't have a large enough entrée menu. They should give serious thought into providing some more choices. Not a lot, maybe two or three more.

(maybe if they didn't take 10 years to take our orders then they might have still had some soup!) Instead they brought out the lobster bisque which was way too salty & had pieces of sausage in it..pieces of lobster might have been better! I was really not impressed with the entree choices either. They even offered a Tofu entree for nearly $30..wth 30 bucks for tofu? I went with the filet mignon with a side of potato au gratin. Also when our entrees were brought out the server didn't bring our sides out right away and when we asked for it our server said ""oh it will be out in 2 seconds."" We waited for more like 5 mins. & the sides still weren't served so we wave down the server again and instead of apologizing he blames it on someone else for not bringing it out. The steak was very meh & the potato au gratin was piping hot and baked with a layer of what seemed like velveeta.  Also since I couldn't finish my steak I asked if they could box it & instead they bring out a plastic bag & clear to-go box to the table for me to pack.

The duck was also pretty good, I wish it was served slightly warmer but it wasn't cold enough to send back. Worst part of the night was probably the dessert. The carrot cake was VERY dense. A busser also tripped and spilled soup all over my blazer and shirt. The manger offered to pay for the dry cleaning if I brought him the dry cleaning bill. Are you serious? Why would I have to go out of my way to bring the receipt for a mistake that was made by the restaurant? He ended up comping $20 which is less then a meal there. Slightly ridiculous.

They were not busy by any means. I got their salmon dish. It came out really undercooked, we had to track down our server, and by the time I got my food everyone had finished theirs. Even after the cooking mishap, our server was MIA and pretty rude considering they had just screwed up my order.

2010-12-12,4.0,"My boyfriend was out of town for our one-year anniversary, so to celebrate the occasion when he got back he planned a super-secret surprise evening out, which turned out to be at the Hancock  Tower's Signature Room.  I had previously been to the Lounge (one floor up; you can still hear the people up there from the restaurant below, occasionally braying drunkenly), but the restaurant is much more sedate and stylish, with a piano player and small, intimate tables. This is a nice special occasion restaurant (a proposal occurred at the table behind us during the course of our meal), or a place to bring an out-of-town guest to whom you really want to show Chicago at its best (and on whom you want to drop some big bucks).  One of the big draws is the view, of course. Unfortunately, ours was obscured by snow clouds, but my boyfriend was able to be lighthearted (""I brought you to Bespin!"" [Star Wars fans, represent!]). If the view was the only thing carrying this place, it would be disappointing, but we had a very fine meal as well.  He ordered swordfish, and I ordered the seafood risotto. I often make risotto at home (quite well, if I do say so), so I was a little taken aback when the waiter asked me how I wanted it done. I asked what he meant. He said most people like risotto al dente, but then described that as ""crunchy."" (Al dente means ""to the tooth,"" and that it gives to the bite, but ""crunchy"" is not a synonym!) Then he turned it totally around and said that risotto is creamy (which should be the case, when it's done right). He finally wrapped up by saying that if I didn't like it he would send it back (I think sensing my hesitation/confusion). I ordered it with a bit of trepidation, and it turned out fine (delicious actually, with shrimp, crab and seared scallops; I asked for a bit of lemon and the additional ""brightness,"" along with some pepper, made it perfect).  My boyfriend enjoyed his swordfish, but said it was ""uninspiring."" He thought I had gotten the better dish after tasting the risotto.  We ordered desserts as well (vanilla bean cheesecake with cranberry compote for him, white and dark chocolate mousse cake for me with ""milk chocolate powder"" and raspberry sauce). He really liked his (a standard slice of cheesecake with cranberry sauce); mine had the more ""artful"" presentation: a square with black, white and brown layers perfectly demarcated. The raspberry sauce was a line drawn across the plate; the ""milk chocolate powder"" was an out-of-place mystery, piled up in one corner of the football-shaped plate like a heap of hot chocolate mix. My boyfriend had told the host when making the reservation that it was our anniversary, so there were little touches addressing this throughout our meal: it was mentioned when we were seated, and by our waiter; then when our desserts were brought each had a candle, and ""Happy Anniversary"" and ""Congratulations"" were written around the wide rims of our respective plates in chocolate.  While the meal was pricey, it really wasn't more than many places you could go to in Chicago, or even Naperville, where we live.  Overall, a unique location and a place for an occasion.

The signature room on the 95th floor can be accessed by a set of express elevators away from the long line of tourist waiting to go up to the observation deck. You are greeted with a spectacular view of Chicago that stretches for miles. The dining menu includes a wide spread of american fine dining. Although the food cannot compare to a 5 star restaurant, the view makes up for the lack of innovation. Service is superb, however you should make reservations or else be prepared for a long wait. If you don't want to pay excessive amounts for dinner, the lunch option is a hidden gem. For only 20 dollars, you meal includes carving station, seafood, potato, rice, season vegetable, poultry, salads, and home made soon. Just to go on the observation deck cost 16 dollars, so for 4 dollars more you can get a all you can eat meal. The food imho is perfectly cook even though it is served buffet style. Pros- amazing view of the city on a good day, check the weather beforehand, excellent service, extensive wine list Cons- Pricey during dinner service, long wait time, if you don't make reservation you might not get a window view Hidden deal- The lunch buffet is unrivaled around streeterville. Make sure you show up early to assure yourself a window seat. At 20 dollars per person you can't go wrong. Does not include dessert or drinks.",0.9836,0.854,0.132,0.013,0.5994949494949495

All in all I woudl say it was a great experience for them to see the city lights over dinner and food was good- They really loved it!  but I would just not dine here to dine.    p.s.  we did receive a corked bottle of wine and the server would not take the bottle of wine off table and get us a new bottle until the manager came to verify.  Really- it was already our third bottle of wine- why would I lie.  kind of annoyed.   Go for experience.,0.9958,0.762,0.202,0.036,0.6130086580086579
2010-10-03,3.0,"Definitely worth the beautiful view. The lunch buffet was uninspiring and have a very limited choice of entrees. There was flank steak, grits, bbq chicken, and blackened catfish. Not really worth the $20 a person. There were a few salad options and 2 different soups. However, the soups did not even taste better than soup from a can. The view was amazing, even on a cloudy day. The service was pleasant. We asked for a window seat and was accommodated instantly. Our waiter was nice enough to take a photo for us and did not have an attitude. And a great surprise was that they brought us a cute little dessert that said happy anniversary for us. That was the highlight for me.",0.9834,0.711,0.256,0.033,0.6364145658263306

It is expensive, but when you're celebrating a special event, I'd say worth it. I have only 2 ""beefs"" with the place that kept it from receiving a 5-star rating from me. The first-I made the reservations online almost 3 months prior to the date, as soon the week we wanted was open for reservations, mine were made...and even with all that time, we still couldn't get a table by the window for a special event. There were families, and even business dinners with several men, etc, who didn't look like they were celebrating anything that had better seats than we did. The restaurant doesn't allow you to request window seating. So that was a bummer. The other beef is that once you're ready to leave, you push the button for the elevator, and sit there right in the middle of the restaurant's lobby area and wait...and wait...and finally, the elevator arrives.",0.975,0.78,0.169,0.05,0.5237394957983194

We were staying at the Park Hyatt across the street so it was just a short walk across the street and an elevator ride up. We had an 8:30 reservation but, after requesting a table by the window, we were asked to wait another 45 minutes. If you're gonna come here you definitely want a table by the window. We went up to the lounge on the 96th floor to wait and had a couple glasses of wine. They were pricey put we didn't expect them not to be. We couldn't even get into the bar area as there was a long line, but were seated at a table in an area off the bar. Our wait turned out to be only about 30 minutes, so that was nice.  We were seated at a table right by the window facing South and the view was breathtaking as it was a clear night. We were greeted by our server, Ryan, who although had only worked there for 3 weeks did an outstanding job taking care of us. We started with a bottle of wine and a shrimp cocktail appetizer. For our entrees we both had the surf n turf which was very good but very expensive at $62.50 a piece. Side note - you can get that in the 'burbs at Chicago Prime for $39.95 and probably get a better cut of meat, but I guess at the Signature Room you're paying for the view. We finished off with the white chocolate & chocolate mousse cake which was delicious. ""Happy Anniversary"" was written in chocolate across the plate which was a nice touch.  My husband also had a glass of port. Our bill was $250 plus tip.  Again, a little pricey but we expected that. We took our time and enjoyed a very relaxing dinner.

My daughter had suggested that we just have drinks and appetizers and still enjoy the view of downtown Chicago, but it was my opinion that food is expensive everywhere in Chicago and so we might as well indulge ourselves. We ordered a bottle of Malbec so that we could take our time and savor the experience :-) I had the Shellfish Risotto and my friend had the Seared Scallops.  He also had the Lobster Bisque.  We shared the Chocolate Bread Pudding with Vanilla Ice Cream and our experience came to about $185 with the tip and it was worth it.  Our waitress was nice and took her time explaining the menu.  We had some questions that she graciously answered with humor (i.e. is that a landing pad out there in Lake Michigan?  No...that is a sewage storage plant :-) The views were breathtaking, albeit hazy, and it brought back memories for me as I gazed out at the Lake from when I was a little girl and my grandmother took me to the Lake to swim.  Having been born in Chicago but left when I was 7 to move to California, it was fun showing 'my town' to my Cali friend who had only been to Chicago once about a decade ago for work. The walk to the Signature Room from the Inn of Chicago where we were staying took less than 20 minutes to get there. Great experience!",0.994,0.829,0.171,0.0,0.538375350140056

2010-08-16,3.0,"Whew... Signature Room on the 95th floor is like the movie, ""Inception.""  They start with a great idea, and then it's that real complex process of planting it in such a way that it takes root in a cogent, but natural way.  The alternative is that if it doesn't go right, things can go bad real fast.  The truth of the matter is - if you take Signature Room and relocate it to the lower level, where Cheesecake Factory is; and if you take Cheesecake Factory and relocate it to 95th floor, Cheesecake Factory would get 10 stars, and Signature Room would get 2 stars.  Signature Room has two saving graces, which will be discussed below. Location: 4 out of 5 Fairly easy to get to via all modes of transportation.  Train and bus both stop within a reasonable walking distance, and one can drive and park in the building garage or at any number of public pay lots that may be a little cheaper.   Service: 3 out of 5 This is a rolling average based on the different times I've gone.  Admit it - if you're dressed business casual or business, you're more likely to get better service than if you roll in wearing shorts and a t-shirt.  For example, I've gone alone at night dressed in a suit and I've been promptly seated by a window with stellar service.  I've gone during Sunday brunch dressed in a suit while my girlfriend wore a nice Sunday dress, and we were treated very well while the customers beside us, dressed shorts got noticeably slower service.  I've been with my parents wearing something more appropriate for Chilis or TGIF, and we got reasonable service.  And most recently, I went with my cousin who was visiting, and we were both dressed casually.  The service wasn't terrible, and it wasn't great.  I think there's some unconscious or maybe conscious stigma of serving people who are perceived to be unassimilated with American culture; maybe there's the fear that foreigners won't tip because things aren't built into a service charge.  I'll stop conjecturing now; the short story is that sometimes I've gotten terrific schmoozy service, and other times I've been served by people who aren't as attentive.  I found that if you sit at the bar upstairs on 96 for drinks, the service is consistently good.   Quality of Food: 3 out of 5 ASIDE from Sunday brunch and a serving of well made fried chicken I got years ago,  the food here is really quite uninspired.  The lunch buffet really leaves you hanging, and I heard multiple people say, ""Is this it?"" The vegetarian options are far and few between both on the buffet as well as ordering a la carte, so perhaps that is something that could be 'beefed' up in the future.  For reference, I myself am not a vegetarian, but people I've dined with are.   Now - one saving grace is Sunday brunch.  There's a 'normal' Sunday brunch which will run you about 50 a pop after tip and any other drinks you may want, and that's actually quite good.  There's a good selection seafood (including pre-cracked crab legs, caviar, oysters, smoked fish, etc), salads, meat dishes, soups, and vegetarian options.  Soft drinks and juice are included in the brunch buffet price. There's also an upscale ""special Sunday brunch"" that they do for such events such as Mother's Day.  I have not gone to the special Sunday Brunch, but I did want to point that out in case people want to plan on going to the regular brunch, but inadvertently show up for a special brunch.   Pricing: 2 out of 5 Ugh...my least favorite part of this place.  Yes, I realize they probably have a high overhead given where they are, but everything is expensive.  I remember when the buffet was less than 18 bucks, and at that time, I thought, ""This is decent.""  The buffet then also had several more options than what I saw on 08/13/10.  The buffet is now 20 bucks, and the ""carving station"" is a nondescript cut of beef.  Sunday brunch, as I've mentioned, is about 50 when all is said and done, and you can expect to pay 2 - 5 dollars extra for items such as pasta or burgers when compared to say, Cheesecake Factory.   The ""wow Factor: 5 out of 5, or 0 out of 5: I have gone on a clear night with friends for drinks on 96, and was awed by the beauty of the city with all the lights.  I have gone on a clear day on numerous occasions and have been able to see out very far.  I have gone on a hazy day and thought, ""eh, could be better.""  And lastly, I have gone on a cloudy rainy day and thought, ""I'm so glad that this isn't a first date.""  Haha.  Plan accordingly.  Remember that just because it's ""sunny"" doesn't necessarily mean there won't be haze.  This would be the other saving grace, but not always consistent.  Decor: 3 out of 5 There is a live pianist at night, and the decor is commensurate with other ""higher end dining experiences.""  Overall: 3 out of 5 Remember what you're paying for...if you look at it from a standpoint of getting an adequate meal while taking in a breathtaking view, you won't be disappointed.",0.9986,0.82,0.144,0.036,0.5420861823361826

The service isn't bad too.  Friendly  Knowledgeable about the menu.  Just got that pushy salesman feel every time he came around to see if we'd like to add to our orders. If I had written this view four years ago, maybe an extra star for the lobster bisque.  But they managed to mess with the one thing I truly enjoyed on the menu.   (Instead of a flavorful bisque with a sprinkling of large lobster chunks and a topping or rich crème fraiche, their lobster bisque is now served with a mousse of crab, lobster, and fish (think imitation crab texture and taste) with a bland almost tomato soup taste). This is definitely a special occasions spot.  I remember in college that all the good boyfriends would take their significant others here for anniversaries and such.  So dress up.  It's fun!  If you choose not too, you won't be turned away.   Dined here for my mother-in-law's 60th birthday dinner.  9pm on a Friday night, you'd be surprised how busy they got! Food was horrific and definitely not worth the price you'll pay (about $100/person minus drinks).  I ordered the seafood risotto with shrimp and scallops.  Risotto was oddly enough both overcooked and undercooked.  Mushy on the outside and hard as a grain or rice on the inside.  Shrimp was overcooked and rubbery.  Scallops were the saving grace of the dish.  They were well seasoned and cooked. My husband's New York strip was decent.  I've had better steak (Ruth's Chris, Morton's, Gibson's, etc...)  Side dishes are all al a carte and a bit on the small side if you're looking to share.  I definitely would recommend the mushrooms and mashed potatoes.

2010-06-10,2.0,"Dude wtf? I'm breaking my 3 month Yelp-review fast to write about my unfortunate experience here. Maybe I caught them on a bad night; maybe something special going on that was more important to them (rumor had it that George Clooney was there that night, though I dunno how true that was). In any case, I want to write about the appalling service me and my date got that night. Maybe it's the kind of place where $150 for two makes you a downright cheapo. Hell, I dunno, I just ordered the dinner special. (Negative point 1) Things seemed a little odd from the point we got seated; the waiter was one of those types that seemed to avoid eye contact; maybe was a little shy or something, or maybe was watching out for where his boss was; who knows? In any case, he was extremely hurried as he sat us, and came by within 2 minutes to take our order. A little fast, but whatever. I ordered 3 items, an appetizer, a paired wine, and the dinner special above. The food came rather slowly, but it was enough time to take a quick walk through the restaurant to check out the view. (Negative #2) The whole time, the two waitstaff that were overseeing our tables kept watching us, as if we were doing something completely weird--it's a restaurant on the 95th floor of the Second City; is it that out of the ordinary to want to see the view? (Whopper Negative #3) Returned to the table, food hadn't arrived yet. I wish I had timed it; it took maybe 10-15 minutes for the first item to appear (the wine). Next was the appetizer. The contents was unmemorable. About five minutes or so later, hardly enough time to get a decent chuck of food done, another member of the staff comes out and mentions that the we're ""eating too slow"". NOT AS A JOKE. Convo progressed as follows: Staff: ""Um, excuse me, but your main course is almost ready."" Me: (paused out of surprise) ""Do people usually eat faster than we do?"" Staff: ""Yeah, actually they do."" Me: ""Okay, thanks for letting us know."" (may be somewhat paraphrased, but I will say that the staff was the rudest I have ever experienced, anywhere) Mind you, we had been seated there maybe 15 minutes prior, most of which was spent waiting for food. STILL, even if we HAD been eating slow, I don't think any place of that alleged quality should be treating any of its patrons like that. In any case, the rest of the food was rather mediocre anyway, and not really worth speaking of. Reading some reviews below, I keep seeing references to some anti-Asian bias, but I can't say anything to confirm that--I think it's hard to convert an entire staff to be racist, assuming they weren't born or raised that way; I think these guys are just retards at service. The only redeeming quality was the view of the city, which is good day or night. Like the previous reviewer said, Chicago is amazing.

Even tho there are about 20 tables with window seating, they sat us @ one where the window is blocked by a huge black beam.  And we were the 7th group in the restaurant, with no one else in line behind us.  When we asked to change tables, the manager was EXTREMELY rude & dismissed our request. And thats how most of the evening went for us.  All the managers, waiters, servers were EXTREMELY rude.  Our whole group was Asian, but we are all born in the U.S. & speak/understand English fluently!!!  I hate playing the race card, but thats essentially what happened.

We could not have asked for a more beautiful day, both inside and out.  We got married on a Sunday morning and opted to have a brunch reception.  So many of our guests commented that they were impressed by the spread, and that it was the best food they had ever had at a wedding.  The staff did a great job of accommodating different dietary restrictions by not having dairy and meat on the same platters, and by keeping any pork products away from non-pork.  All food items were also clearly labeled so no one accidentally ingested anything they weren't supposed to.    I was hoping to be able to write a five-star review for our venue, but they fell short in a few ways: The week before our wedding, I came by to drop off items and have a final walk through.  At this time, Bill Ryan stated that for the ceremony, each side of the aisle would have eight chairs in each row.  On the day of, my husband's side had eight chairs.. and my side had five chairs in each row.  This would not have been an issue had we known this in advance, but because the only way we were made aware of it was by coming in and seeing that certain members of my family did not get to sit in the front row, this became a huge source of unnecessary drama.  At the walk through, I was also told that during our reception, Kevin would make an announcement to dismiss tables to get food.  And, well.. he didn't.  Instead, one of my husband's cousins grabbed the mic and called out tables, skipping over tables one and two.  Nothing says awkward like nearly starting World War III at your wedding reception.  And again, had this been communicated differently, it could have been planned for, and all the drama could have been avoided.   And finally, I heard that the desserts were amazing, but because they were taken away so quickly, neither my husband nor I had a chance to try any of them.   I would recommend the Signature Room to couples looking for a unique place to have their wedding, particularly for a brunch reception, but I advise them to be a stickler on details and to get everything agreed upon written into their contract rather than verbally stated.",0.9301,0.875,0.08,0.045,0.5912414965986394

Not only had I NOT mentioned to them it was her birthday, I also never mentioned her name was Pam. These are the types of services I have come to expect when I come here now. They pay attention to your needs without havig to ask. Here is the kicker: I left my lipstick in the bathroom and one of the staff brought it back to me.  I chose the rack of lamb and my friend (taking advantage that I was paying!!! (and I told her too!)) got the surf and turf. The lamb was succulent and cooked to order. It was fabulous. Her filet and lobster (flown in from South Africa that morning) were buttery and warm.  I had a white chocolate cake with raspberry sauce and a never empty glass of champagne. The staff was attentive to keep those glasses full and even switched the ice out for the bottle to maintain it's temperature.  I really can't find anything wrong with this restaurant. Everyone was fantastic and I truly felt privledged to be there. Anyone with a negative review must have attended with a negative attitude.",0.9849,0.815,0.153,0.031,0.4962585034013606

As for the food, I found the menu to be typical of high dining establishments. There are enough choices for the pedestrian diner but then there are gems that food lovers will find to be worth their while. Our dinner party of four went all out and ordered three courses. For appetizers, three of us ordered the pork belly, the other ordered lobster bisque. I was a little leery of my dining companions not liking the pork belly since they are not used to that cut of pork. But we were all happy with the flavor and presentation of this course.  For our main course, we ordered veal, pork tenderloin, duck breast and halibut. We also ordered two sides - gratin mashed potatoes and the portabello mushrooms. They tell you the sides serve two but it is really more like three. I ordered the duck - it was juicy and flavored well but I would have liked the skin to be crispier. I also was able to try the pork tenderloin which was AMAZING - probably the best pork tenderloin I have ever had.  We also ordered dessert - I was debating between the cheese course but finally setted on a chocolate port. Another port was ordered that was also fabulous. (Don't remember what else was ordered, I was drinking port y'all...) A wonderful experience overall and highly recommended for first time visitors to Chicago.

Karen Y. and myself had it on our lists to visit the Signature Room during our first visit to Chicago, and in no way did our lunch disappoint. Higher even than the observation deck in the Hancock building, the view is spectacular.  So good, in fact, that we figured it was pointless to visit the Willis/Sears Tower afterward.   For lunch, entrees are about 15 dollars.  Factor in that a ticket to the observatory costs just as much, and technically you're getting a free meal.  The meals are worth their dinner value too, as the dishes are some of the best I've had.  I can't afford coming here for dinner, but that doesn't mean I don't think it'd be worth it. The fried calamari appetizer is THE BEST I've EVER had.  Seriously.  I devoured that plate.  And they gave you legs.  As my dad says, only a real calamari appetizer comes with legs.

2009-12-06,2.0,"Went yesterday for lunch.  When making reservations, it says you can't guarantee a window seat until you arrive, which is fine.  Got there a little early and the hostess, Anne wasn't friendly at all.  I understand that part of her job is to be firm, but there's a difference in being firm and impolite. We waited until our reservation began and then were told we had to wait an hour to guarantee a window seat.  We opted out, but it was pretty frustrating when we saw many empty window seats that weren't filled when we were seated. Our waiter Jeremy was ok, but very casual and not attentive at all.  After reading what was on the buffet on a tattered piece of paper in his pocket (I mean, really...it's a buffet. Does it change that much?  Can you not remember the SAME items that are in the buffet week to week?), we placed our order.  We were brought some warm but stale bread, but then proceeded to wait 40 minutes for our food to arrive.  During that time, Jeremy never came over to apologize about our wait, even though he was standing right behind us at the order station the entire meal.  After asking about our food, he said something about the kitchen being the weakest part of the restaurant and that he'd go and check right away.  Five minutes later, he remembered to ask a manager who happened to be passing by.  Ridiculous.   The food was just ok.  The view is neat, but if you're not going to want to wait for a window seat, skip it and go somewhere else.  Bottom line, here are my suggestions. -If you're going during a busy time, be prepared to be caught up in a swarm of people when exiting the elevator. -If you definitely want a window seat, make a reservation for an hour before you want to eat.  Go check in at that time and then come back an hour later. -For a great view, skip the restaurant and head straight up to the lounge for a drink and lite fare.  Don't have to wait an hour for a table.  Food downstairs isn't necessarily worth waiting for. -Be prepared for sub-par service.  I should've known after reading reviews here, but truly, it's bad.",0.8947,0.819,0.101,0.08,0.5154586834733894

To my surprise, he actually got us an excellent table right next to the window. It was on the south view where you can see navy pier and the sears tower all in one view. I didn't tip him part because I didn't have anything smaller than a $20 on me, but also because he kinda seated us so fast and walked away without hesitating. We ordered a glass of wine each. I had a 2006 cab, my fiance the 2007 syrah. The cab was excellent and the syrah was just ok but being the gentleman I am, I let my fiance have mine, which worked out great because the syrah ended up pairing with my dinner a lot better than the cab.  We ordered the grilled bruschetta for an appetizer... Amazing! For dinner,  I had the grilled duck breast and my fiance had the seared sea scallops which were very gritty and not tasty at all except for the garnish that accompanied it. I did like the duck and garnish, but wasn't wowed by any means. We both had the white cheddar potato's which were nice in portion size and very tasty.  Then came dessert. We usually never order dessert, but the prices were actually reasonable ($8.50 each). I had the vanilla bean creme brulee with shortbread cookies. You could tell it was sitting in the fridge because the cookies were soggy and the inside of the brulee was cold. It was tasty nonetheless but could have been much better had they not leave the cookies in the fridge and warmed up the brulee to room temperature. My fiance got the white chocolate moose with coconut macaroon and pineapple with mint sauce. Wow, what a disappointment. The moose was a little hardened jelly disk of despair. You can tell it was sitting in that round mold for quite some time. Just not good at all. Total price came to a little over $150.00 which is what I expected for the location.

2009-09-09,4.0,"Alright, Yelpers.  I'll be honest with you -- I took a long break from Yelp and haven't been Yelping as often as I should've been.  With that in mind, the fact that I chose the Signature Room to be my first review after my break says something. After scouring the internet for ""romantic restaurants in Chicago,"" I remembered that a family friend of mine pointed out the 95th floor of the Hancock building, stating that it was a great place to take a date.  I made a dinner reservation on a Saturday night without any problems and was seated semi-promptly to our table. The view from our seats was EXCELLENT.  If you want window seating, be sure to tell the hostess; you'll have to wait around 30-45 minutes, though, depending on how busy it is.  Seriously, you've gotta request window seating because what you get is a sweeping view of the city lights, including the Navy Pier.  I would go out on a limb and say that this is the perfect setting to be proposed to -- dim lighting, light music, romantic view... it really is the whole shebang. We ordered the laughing bird shrimp tempura appetizer, which was tiny shrimp with a lemon sauce.  Ehh, not worth it -- too little shrimp for us to share.  My entree, however, was very tasty!  I ordered the Berkshire pork with miso sauce, and the meat was very tender and juicy.  The sauce was mmmm mmm good!  It came with a carrot and almond salad, which was a nice addition to the dish.  My boyfriend ordered the salmon, which he said was not that great.  He enjoyed my dish more, but that's only because I'm Yelp Elite and know what's up. ;) We also had dessert, which was a white and dark chocolate mousse with raspberries in sauce.  Great way to finish the night! Next time I'm in town, I will definitely be coming back.  Make sure to check out the 96th floor (the Signature Lounge) while you're waiting for your seats.  Seems like it's the happenin' spot (my boyfriend ran into a classmate there, so hummm).",0.9911,0.851,0.141,0.007,0.5537581699346406
2009-09-08,5.0,"Two dear friends of mine held their wedding ceremony and reception here this weekend, and everything was wonderful.  I believe that we were actually using two rooms with the partition removed--the Chicago Room (facing south and west) for the ceremony, and the Chestnut Room (facing west) for the reception. The venue was an excellent choice, obviously thanks in great part to the views.  What a backdrop for wedding vows!  The rooms were modestly sized, but they were holding a smallish wedding and had the perfect amount of space.  My only real complaint was the garish, 1980s patterned carpet which took a bit away from the elegant aesthetic.  Quibbles! Service was also very good.  We made friends with a couple of the servers, including one guy who seemed to be running the show.  I remember one time he was refilling our wine glasses and chimed into our conversation with a comment; normally I would find this gratingly intrusive, but it was funny and quite astute.  Speaking of the wine and water glasses, whenever you took a sip, there was someone there to top them off.  After the first few times, I looked at my friend Amit and said, ""If they're going to keep doing that all night, we are in trouble.""  And we were.   The dinner was very nicely paced; really, in all aspects great and small, the staff seemed like experts.  It was pitch-perfect service.  Except that my one friend had to tell the substitute bartender how to make a Manhattan.   I think that the bride and groom ordered the premium drink package, which gave us Glenlivet, Tanqueray 10, Grey Goose and Belvedere, Crown Royal Reserve and Jack Daniels but no bourbons (sad face), and a few other good liquors.  (I stuck with gin and tonics before dinner and Glenlivet after so I didn't pay much attention to the selection.)  I wish that I could remember the wine served, but it had a simple leaping horse illustration on the front.  Fun fact:  the plastic swizzle sticks were miniature Hancock towers. And now the food:  in a word, excellent.  Based on reviews and word-of-mouth, I would be ambivalent to eating in the restaurant.  But the catered food was well above average and exceeded expectations.  I didn't care much for the soup, but the cheesy sourdough crouton was fantastic!  And the salad...it was just simple greens, a few other vegetables, and a sherry vinaigrette, but it was somehow amazingly delicious.  Close to the best salad ever.  We had a lemon sorbet intermezzo, but through each course I was scarfing down the hot, floury rolls.  They kept refilling those too... I had chosen the beef option, which was a very generous filet (about the size of my man-palm and almost two inches thick) cooked perfectly.  Really, I expected a dry, overcooked piece of steak but it was just to the medium side of medium-rare, which seems like quite a feat for a seating of this size.  And with the filet came the best part of the meal--white truffle bread pudding.  [Falls on floor.]  Absolutely phenomenal; I have been desperately craving more of that savory ambrosia for the last three days.  I was begging my tablemates for scraps of theirs but noone was giving it up!  Really, that stuff belongs in any of the very top-notch restaurants in town. Everything at this wedding that was under the Signature Room's control was practically flawless.  Kudos to making a great evening, and I'm sure that my two married friends would recommend this to any couple who wants a memorable experience.",0.9992,0.758,0.218,0.024,0.5532843915343917

The presentation was beautiful with each rib stack in a design topped with some greens and roasted potatoes but boy were they FATTY!! Gross!!! The description did not even describe what I put in my mouth. I was quite disappointed - and on my birthday!!

I certainly wouldnt recommend coming up here for the food, but absolutely would recommend it for the views, the great service or just to have a fun, ""special"" something or other.  I was here for a great friends bridal luncheon and we had a ball!  Our server was fantastical, the champagne was deeeeeelish, the food was just ok but the company and celebration were top notch!  Being on the 95th floor, overlooking all of chicago and the lake added to the very very special occasion. a quick note on food.....the cheesey bready crunchy cracker things are to die for, yum city!  I had a burger (no bun) and it was a-ok, great fries.  The veggie flatbread looked and smelled amazing.  I had a bite of the lobster salad and was totally grossed out.  too much blue cheese, too much egg, etc etc...but it certainly looked gorgeous upon presentation.",0.9953,0.681,0.262,0.057,0.5482638888888889

2009-08-27,3.0,"I went here for a goodbye dinner for one of my teammates.  The view is always spectacular at the Signature room, I mean if I was rating just the view, I would give it five stars, but hey I am talking about the food here.  I ordered the rack of lamb for my entree, the lamb was on the verge of rare but since I did ask for it medium rare, I much prefer it on the rare side than overly cooked.  It came with a mix of roasted vegetables atop a bed of cous cous.  It was not bad, but definitely not memorable.  Also my dish was definitely not hot when it arrived to the table.  Perhaps it was the negative degree temperature the Signature room was set at, my toes almost froze off!  My friend got the salmon which I had a taste of.  I felt like her salmon was cooked a little too long and didn't have any flavor to it.   For dessert we shared the creme brulee, that was also ok, I always think it is an added plus when the creme brulee is warm or hot when it is served, but here it was cold and had some pineapple on top.  I guess for $40 per entree I was hoping for a little more pizazz in flavors and presentation but I guess you are paying more for the view than for the view.  The service is pretty good, I feel like people mostly come to the Signature Room to celebrate an occassion and they are pretty good at recognizing any occasion as I noticed that every table got a complimentary dessert for whatever occasion they were celebrating. (our table included since we were having a goodbye dinner)  Unless you are coming for the view, I feel like there are plently of other restaurants in Chicago that I would rather spend $40 per entree on.",0.9948,0.788,0.181,0.031,0.6603395061728394
2009-08-26,5.0,"I have to take the time to put in my 5 stars for the phenomenal job the staff at the Signature Room provided meand my guests for my wedding.   We worked with Bill Ryan to plan out our event. He was courteous, had a great sense of humor, very patient and knew exactly what he was doing. It rained on our wedding day and we had an outdoor ceremony planned but had to move it to the Signature Room (where our reception was planned on being held). Bill and his team worked to make sure that we had enough time and room to fit our group of 70 into the room.   Please note,  the room for our wedding reception and ceremony is not in the lounge, it is a separate room that faced North, South and West. The views were incredible of course.   Bill and his partner Kevin made sure that we were able to get everyone up to the room and got them drinking and eating appetizers, even with the hitch in our plan.  Kevin was really good at rounding us all up and making sure that my DJ and wedding party was prepped. Remember, we had planned on the outdoor ceremony where our DJ would not be present, so having Kevin take the lead and Bill direct us was really helpful in making a very smooth transition. Now on to the food service. The service itself was professional and well timed. There was no lag, nobody snatched the food away if you were not done and everyone got exactly what they ordered.  The dinner was a 5 course meal, everyone was stuffed to the brim and had nothing but great things to say about what they ate. The wine was good and kept on flowing throughout the course of the night, since the bar was closed during dinner service.  The chefs at the signature room also designed my cake. I had no idea what I wanted and left it up to them. The cake was beautiful and I was pleasantly surprised at how nice it came out with aboslutely no direction from me.  We had quite the rowdy crowd and due the weather issue the staff was nice enough to extend our time just a bit to make up for the open bar that was interrupted by our ceremony LOL. They were able to take a seemingly ordinary room with an awesome view and transform it into a beautifully set wedding reception location. The tables, even with the most basic choices, were gorgeous. Everything was very well organized and well orchestrated by both Bill and Kevin. And you may be reading this and think its a tourist trap but I have lived in Illinois my entire life and the City of Chicago my entire adult life. I can tell you this much, not only was I impressed as a resident but I know for a fact that every person that attended my wedding will remember how amazing the location, the food and the company was (I take credit for the company!) so thank you very much staff at the Signature Room you truly made our day a day to remember.",0.9983,0.783,0.183,0.034,0.5824822695035461

That would be true, if everyone wouldn't be standing in front of the windows taking pictures with a flash. If you aren't seated by the window, don't expect to enjoy the view. And, if you're looking to enjoy the view, just pay for the admission to the Hancock Observatory (94th floor) and see an unobstructed view.

But I was invited to a lunch at this restaurant which is on the 95th floor.   Thankfully it was a very clear day so there was a great view of the water and the city.  You could see all the way up to Northwestern University to the north.   But as is true with most good view spots the food and service were subpar.   The staff greeting you was really unprofessional.  REALLY unprofessional.  They yelled at a guest that was looking at the window.  Crazy.   The buffet appeared to look as if locusts had descended upon it with most bowls and warming trays empty!   The wait staff didn't provide any bread or water without a request for it.   The elevator also didn't seem properly pressurized as everyone in it had a bit of an earache on the way down.  My tip to you:  Avoid eating here.  Just ride up the elevator for free (instead of paying to go to the observation deck 1 floor away) and look around.  Then ride the elevator back down.  Skip the food.,0.8734,0.794,0.121,0.085,0.47089506172839507

Entering the restaurant takes you back to a fifties feeling but we liked it and felt it works. The views are amazing as you walk out of the elevator. Staff were very pleasant and attentive. We left feeling that the food, service and view were worth the pricey bill. Drinks are priced from $8 beers to $13 for a glass of wine. We had a very good cheese plate appetiser that could have been improved by providing an assortment of crackers. I wanted to try their lobster bisque but just could not talk myself into spending the excessive $10 for a small bowl of soup. Our entrees of pork tenderloin($30) and filet of steak($40) were excellent. They were both cooked perfectly and accompanied with outstanding sauces.
