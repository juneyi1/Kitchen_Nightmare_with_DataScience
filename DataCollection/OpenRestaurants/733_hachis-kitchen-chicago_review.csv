The sushi is incredibly fresh and delicious (and some of the rolls and appetizers are fairly inventive), the service is friendly, courteous and totally on-point, and the visual aesthetics of the room are quite pleasing. They also were playing classic jazz (hard bop, West Coast 50s, etc.) the entire time we were there, which not only meshed perfectly with the rhythms of our dinner, but was a wonderful change from the teeth-grinding EDM that so many local sushi spots feel compelled to play.

2017-03-12,2.0,"This was a last minute OpenTable option that presented itself on Saturday evening. I was starving and needed a restaurant that would feed me and was located close to Emporium Arcade Bar.  There were a few tables taken at 7pm on Saturday evening. The service was attentive, courteous and efficient, so this review has no reflection on that aspect of the evening.  The food was just not good. Our table ordered Dragon Maki, Spicy White Tuna Crunch, Rainbow Maki & Yaki Soba noodles with Shrimp. The sushi did not taste fresh and the quality of fish was much poorer than most other sushi restaurants around. Dragon Roll was too doused in eel sauce for my liking & the main feature of the Rainbow Roll was the ""crab stick"" in the middle. The best roll was the Spicy White Tuna Crunch, but even that was sub-par to most other sushi. The Yaki Soba noodles were lacking in flavors & the shrimp once again did not taste fresh.

There wasn't a crowd, but a constant stream of parties consisting of 2-3 individuals. I didn't order from the menu. Instead, I had an omakase. I wasn't in the mood for making rolls only anyway, so this was a better option. And since the omakase is usually for parties of 2 or more, the chef accommodating just me was a plus. The only pedestrian course I had was the complimentary bowl of miso Soup. Everything else was a ""Now Chicago is out of control. I was referring to Chicago with stop and frisk,"" Trump said.. Fresh ingredients in all of the landings and each was spaced out so there was no rush. This is the third Japanese restaurant I've been to recently where I had an omakase rather than ordering ala Carter.

We were immediately greeted, seated  and given O-shibori.  The only detractor from this entire experience is that the water smelt stale which left your hands smelling like that - we just used some hand sanitizer to fix that.   I ordered the butterfly martini, edamame, miso, avo roll, and veg roll.  Everything was delicious and the service was terrific.   Compliments of the owner, they brought me a chocolate cake with a candle in it and sung happy birthday.   Very classy establishment, where the customer still matters, and outstanding service.  We will definitely be back, will bring all of our friends and recommend this place to everyone who loves sushi.",0.9958,0.695,0.294,0.011,0.6807692307692308

2016-04-24,3.0,"Trendy ambiance, small to mid size restaurant with ok sushi.  Ambiance: Trendy and modern, with alot of open space. We made reservations for a Friday night at 8pm. It wasn't packed at all, but it never hurts to make a reservation.  Food:  HIGHLIGHTS:  Rolls average $10, for two apps, 4 rolls, and 2 desserts we paid about $76 total for 2 people (not including tip) Appetizer: Hamachi Jalapeno Rolls: Spicy white tuna crunch Dessert: Green tea creme brulee  DETAILS:  We started off with the Hamachi Jalapeno and edamame. The Hamachi Jalapeno was highly reviewed on Yelp so we thought we'd give it a shot. Well it doesn't come highly reviewed for no reason! The fish was really fresh and it wasn't spicy at all and iIt had just the right amount of soy sauce to complement the fish. Edamame was nothing special, it's always the same to me everywhere I go. As far as the rolls, we got the spicy tuna, spicy white tuna crunch, unagi roll and one more that I can't remember, which obviously wasn't memorable, sooo it's not important. The spicy tuna had more of a kick than all the spicy tuna rolls I've ever had. They were also larger in diameter than other spicy tuna rolls I've ordered, which can be a good thing, more for your money right? The unagi roll had too much sauce in it. It was pretty much drenched in the sauce it came with. Had it not been, it probably would've been more enjoyable. If you like unagi like I do, I'd ask if the sauce could be on the side. The best one was the spicy white tuna crunch, from the texture to the taste, it was delightful. For dessert we got green tea ice cream and the green tea creme brulee. I love creme brulee so I was already partial to it. I've never had this flavor though, needless to say I had to try it and highly recommend it. Good for 1-2 people to share. The green tea ice cream, not so much. It was bland, but if you want to try it I say go for it. You get three scoops, good for 1-4 people to share. My favorite green tea ice cream will always be Akai Hana's.  Service: It was good, no complaints and nothing notably exceptional either.  Not my go to spot for sushi, but I'd come back if a friend wanted to or if I wanted green tea creme brulee.",0.9967,0.801,0.167,0.032,0.5064109347442682

The Ebi Tempura Maki roll was like 4 inches in diameter. When I tried to eat it, it exploded all over my plate and it was a little embarrassing.  The spicy white tuna crunch had the best texture on the outside, I don't know why I don't always get rolls with a crispy layer because they are always good.  The halloween maki was also very good.

I appreciate that the fish is such an extremely high quality it doesn't need sauces - although their specialty rolls are yummy. I agree with another reviewer about the fresh wasabi. I had never had it before. The waitress brought a little bit for us to try; very thoughtful as I know it is expensive.   Which brings me to the service - extremely attentive. And after you've been a few times, they remember you and your idiosyncrasies.  For example, my teenage son loves their beef teriyaki - and because he eats as much as three people, they know to come to him early in the dinner to ask if they should bring a second order.

I'm a bit shocked they're not more busy and its so easy to get a table.  I always make the mistake of ordering -- and then consuming -- too much food here. The problem, of course, is that there's too many items I like on the menu. And instead of being a smart person and ordering less and visiting more often, I just gorge myself and contemplate what a mistake I've made on the walk home. Sadly, I am always a sucker for their green tea creme brûlée. So damned good.  The ambiance is quiet and the decor is very modern.

A bottle of moet I believe is only $70. They have a beautiful wall of roses as you enter the bathroom area. I'm not big on raw fish, but if their warm food is great, the raw is probably better.

How I went to the wrong place is beyond me; although in my defense, they also serve sushi. We started out our meal with glasses of wine and the Ahi Poke, the dish that made me bookmark Hachi's in the first place. I fell in love with poke in Costa Rica and at the time, there weren't a lot of places in Chicago that I noticed it on the menu. The dish did not disappoint - large chunks of sashimi grade ahi with spicy sesame oil, it was fantastic. The only thing I would change are the chips, they were far too narrow to scoop up the fish making it awkward to eat. To follow the poke, we ordered three rolls - Spicy White Tuna Crunch, Fashion Maki (made spicy), and the Volcano Maki. Of the three rolls, the Fashion was probably my least favorite for two reasons. The Fashion is one of the rolls cut into four pieces, which means these are giant, impossible to eat in any dainty sort of fashion, pieces. On top of that, I really didn't glean any of the spice they added to the roll, which was disappointing as was the cucumber and avocado really dominating the flavors. However, the other two rolls were pretty great. Overally, I quite enjoyed our meal at Hachi's. Service was unobtrusive yet attentive and the meal seemed reasonable at $70 total for two glasses of wine, three ""fancy"" rolls and an appetizer, which left us both stuffed to the gills.",0.5664,0.855,0.075,0.071,0.5673309178743962

2013-07-02,4.0,"Looking for a cool sushi spot in Logan Square with an outdoor patio? My friends and I were this weekend and Hachi's fit the bill.  The patio at Hachi's was uber chill and we had it all to ourselves! On a Saturday night no less! We did a bit of people watching but mostly just hung out in the 65 perfect temperature sipping on our wine and noshing on our fishies. Hachi's is open until midnight on Saturday's and at 9 the place was pretty empty inside and out. Our waitress was really cute and polite throughout our meal plus was always quick making our time here seamless.  After perusing the wine menu, we decided on a fantastic white from New Zealand. I'm very sad I can't remember the name of it now because it was out of this world! It smelled better than any wine I think I've ever had and the flavor was just perfect for my tastebuds. It was just $30 and the waitress was very proper in having me taste it first, then pouring it all out to us in proper amounts and finally putting it on ice for us. I'm used to Asian restaurants just bringing it out and letting you have at it! We started off with the Tuna Masako appetizer which is tuna mixed with masako roe wrapped in seaweed & deep fried for $10. I'm big on textures when it comes to food and it was a bit strange to have the roe mixed in with the tuna making it a bit crunchy - strange in a good way, mind you! I really liked the smooth mixed with some crunch and having it deep fried in a very light batter made this Caucasian girl a happy camper.  As our main dish, we decided to split a few rolls. Bagel Maki - smoked salmon & cream cheese for $6. Silly name! And because of the silly name, it was calling our name. We had to get it. I liked it, solid maki. Dragon Maki - fresh water eel & avocado wrapped around rice, eel, scallion, fish egg & cream cheese for $13 - I always feel funny eating eel because I just think of Flotsam & Jetsam...but then I remember how tasty it is and honestly, they were evil villains! So all is well in the world. I digress. This roll is delicious! Volcano Maki - creamy lobster mixed with wasabi & tobiko, topped with maki & spicy tempura crunch for $12 - due to my shellfish allergy, I watched this from the sidelines. It looked amazing though! Spicy White Tuna Crunch - white tuna mixed with flying fish egg, scallion, avocado, spicy sesame oil & tempura crunch for $7 Absolutely loved this one! Second favorite of the night for me aside from the eel. It had a big kick for me but it was so tasty that I didn't mind. With tax, tip, all that food and a big ol' bottle of wine we rolled out paying $34 each. Not too shabby if I do say so myself.

Parking isn't too bad around the area. We found some residential parking for free. This is a cute, small sushi restaurant. It has one small TV that some of my friends were watching off (the Bulls playoffs), a cute bar by the front, and some seating to wait. Lights are dimly lit, setting the mood of a nice and romantic atmosphere. I was with a party of 14 people.  Onto the food - I felt mostly all the sushi I ordered were really good. The best was the salmon sashimi. Heard lots of good raves from my friends who also ordered the salmon sashimi - it was tasty and juicy! My husband and I started with the jalapeno with hamachi as appetizer. That one is very tasty. We ordered 4 rolls - spicy tuna, spicy white tuna crunch, salmon avocado, and the crazy maki. The crazy maki is really crazy - it's HUGE!!! I was able to eat it after breaking it down into 3 pieces. The spicy tuna was a bit strange, but all the other sushi we ordered were fresh and really good. We also ordered several pieces of sashimi - like I mentioned earlier salmon is to die for! YUM!  A friend of mine ordered their green tea mochi ice cream and green tea creme brulee. The ice cream was okay but she said the green tea creme brulee was really good.

Tonight I decided to rewarded myself for a hard days work with some delicious sushi specifically uni and spicy scallop sushi. Their spicy scallop was delish as usual but their uni was....inedible! For $5 a piece, I would expect silky, buttery uni, but tonight's uni tasted a bit like battery acid. I know bad uni when I taste it due to a previous experience with bad uni (not at hachis). I called to express my disappointment and the hostess refused to believe me stating that the shipment just arrived. Shipments aren't perfect. Each piece of uni isn't perfect. There can be a bad piece in a shipment so why not do the right thing by the customer and apologize instead of refuting it. Bye bye hachis. It was nice knowing you.

Subsequent tries have improved my feelings each time.  Their presentation is extremely good and makes you really want to eat the sushi. The nigiri pieces have healthy portions of fish and are put together really well. The hamachi has always been a star for me as has the lobster nigiri. The lobster is wrapped in seaweed and is in a mix with some spicy sauce as well. It's different from what I've had in the past, but it's really enjoyable. I will say though, the nigiri is where they have varied for me. Sometimes it's really good, other times, it's solid.  I have most enjoyed the maki. The spicy white tuna maki has been really spot on. It's more spicy than I'm used to, but as someone who likes some heat, that works just fine. It just catches me off guard from time to time. Their other rolls are extremely good, and I do need to go more into their special rolls.  Hachi's Kitchen is pretty damn good on the whole. I'm glad I have made some retries from here as I could've allowed myself to miss out. The presentation is gorgeous and the fish very good.

2012-02-03,3.0,"I think maybe my expectations were too high going in to Hachi's.  People have raved about it to me numerous times, and admonished me for not going despite living so close.  So I decided to check it out. First impression - very cool space!  Low lighting, but airy, clean, and somewhat serene actually.  I was surprised to find the place nearly empty, but it could just be an off night.  I was greeted and seated right away, and then someone came by with a hot towel to clean off my hands - so nice! So I sit down to order, and the menu looks nice.  They have a good number of items for the non-seafood eaters like me.  After a few minutes, I settled on beef teriyaki, which came with both miso soup and salad. The miso soup came out quickly, and had a really nice amount of tofu in it.  It was a little on the salty side which I like, but if you're salt sensitive (like my mother - you'd think a grain of salt would kill her!) it might be tough.  The salad was the pretty standard one you seem to get at Japanese restaurants - iceberg lettuce, a little cabbage, radish, and fabulous ginger dressing!  It was also a little bigger than I expected. The kitchen does need to work on their timing a bit - I wasn't even halfway done with my soup when my salad came out, and I hadn't finished either when my entree came out.  I was rocking quite the collection of food for several minutes there! The beef teriyaki was ok.  It was a good size entree, but I swear it tasted a little fishy which I thought was pretty odd.  It was nicely cooked, but I could never quite shake that hint of fishy flavor. Nice atmosphere, good food, but I wasn't blown away like I thought I'd be.  Still, it's close, decently priced, and a really nice atmosphere, so I will likely try Hachi's again.",0.9972,0.717,0.234,0.049,0.6081651549508693

2011-11-18,3.0,"After not being able to get a reservation for another sushi place around town my dude looked to coworkers for suggestions and Hachi's won in our mind. Plus, it was in our 'hood and a place I had been eyeballing since it opened a couple of years ago. Walked in to a totally empty restaurant, making our reservations a little unnecessary, but being quickly seated is the most important to me. Wait staff was all very nice and attentive (at times almost TOO attentive). My boyfriend and I were on a small anniversary date and I didn't feel like we had a large amount of privacy, but the interior was beautiful. We ordered the deep fried oysters and miso soup for an appetizer and three sushi rolls for the meal (spicy white tuna crunch maki, volcano maki, and Halloween maki). The soup came out right away and was perfectly delicious. Before we were able to finish our soup our sushi rolls started coming out, after which I asked if our appetizer was still on the way, and the owner/hostess/waitress explained that the sushi rolls were done first and she didn't want them to sit. Shortly after the fried oysters came out so all of our food was on the table at once. This always bugs me about sushi places. I hate waiting forever for a few sushi rolls, but I hate it MORE when everything comes out right away right on top of each other.  The fried oysters were tasty but verrrry greasy. The rolls were standard...I had MUCH higher expectations for the spicy white tuna crunch since many Yelpers raved about it. Tasted like a standard Spicy Tuna Roll to me. The rest of the sushi was fine. Volcano roll was COVERED in tempura flakes. Literally a mound of it. Sushi was tasty, but I don't need a mound of tempura. I know I sound very cranky about the whole experience, but its such a beautiful place that I had such high expectations for. Food + a beer and a glass of wine was $60+. I'd rather go to a local BYOB with more interesting rolls in the future. I'd go back, but its not at the top of my list.",0.9775,0.847,0.106,0.047,0.5099792960662526

The pan seared scallops were really good actually, those I liked. But the Volcano and spicy octopus rolls were okay at first optimistic bite but after further analysis, kinda gross. The Lobster in the volcano, was really fishy and almost tasted like it was on the verge of turning. At first I thought it may have been the masago (fish eggs) but then dissected a roll and ate a piece of the lobster meat to confirm. My dinner guest ordered a hot tea and suggested I taste it... And before she even said what she thought, I said this tastes like tempura, which is ridiculous to try and imagine how this is possible, but being the son of an international tempura tycoon, believe there is no mistake. All that said, I told our server it was good at the end and tipped a standard 20% (that's right cheapos that's what you should be tipping).

2011-09-19,2.0,"Very disappointing experience here before heading out to see Erasure @ Congress Theater.  First sign of trouble was the fact that the restaurant was pretty much empty when we came in on a Sat night. By the time we left two more couples came in, but given the high ratings and the raves about this place on Check,Please! my high expectations where not even close to being met.  The host (owner?) in a white chef jacket asked if we wanted to sit outside. Hmmm, well there are no heaters on the front porch and it was mid-September in Chicago, so that would be a ""No""  Positives:  Well there is only one: The soft shell crab roll was delicious.  Negatives:  Some may like the crisp/clean feel of the place, but to me it seemed like a small cafeteria. Yes, they have a nice wall of tiny vases with flowers, but they are right across from the washrooms.  The rolls here just didn't jump out and impress. The rainbow roll was pretty expensive and for the first time ever for me, contained only 3 different fish (tuna, salmon and I believer yellow tail). Usually I see 4 or even 5, but not here.  The unagi roll was tiny and my spicy scallop hand roll ($9!!!) was spicy, but did not have many scallops and had a weird texture. Very disappointing, as this hand roll has become by benchmark.  The bagel roll was ok, if you like your salmon to taste smoked.  I think that's what they actually put in a bagel roll.  Finally, another surprise is that all the sushi is made in the back. Unlike about 99% of sushi restaurants, you actually do not see the art of making sushi here. I am guessing maybe the sushi is actually being prepared by non-Japanese chefs, so keep the process out of sight.  Personally, I do not care; the gringos @ the top 2 places in Salt Lake City make incredible sushi. Not having the sushi prep out front, adds to the cafeteria feel, as plates come out of the kitchen to your table.  Service:  Service was good, I liked that the server pointed out the rolls on the plate. While we are quite knowledgeable when it comes to sushi, I always appreciate the extra effort. Somewhat picky of me, but they put the hand roll on the large plate with the rest of the sushi and then brought out the unagi roll on a separate plate. It would make more sense to put all on one plate, but if you must separate: the hand roll goes on the extra plate.  Add $6 for valet, who actually runs back and forth between Hachi and another restaurant down the block and the shine quickly wears off on eating here.",0.996,0.801,0.156,0.043,0.4806216931216933

2011-03-12,4.0,"Wanted to fulfill my sushi splurge at a new place and was recommended Sai Cafe in Lincoln Park. When my friend called last night to make reservations they were slam packed and the reservations would have to be late; so they directed us to their sister location in Logan Square called Hachi's Kitchen. Street parking, as most city spots are so it's kind of a pain to find something available. The inside is pretty cool. It has a very modern, dark look to it, dim lighting, japanese writing and decor on the walls and all throughout. We were greeted very walmly and seated right away. Granite tables, leather booth seats, candles, more of a ""romantic"" vibe than anything. The server was knowledgeable and was able to help my friend out with selections who was extremely new and timid to the idea of sushi. I tried to help him but he refused to believe any of my advice (some friend huh!?) For appetizers we had the shrimp tempura, which came as 4 or 5 long strips with a bowl of sauce to dip in, and the Yaki Tori which was broiled chicken and veggies (peppers and onions) on skewers. I typically love shrimp tempura as my favorite appetizer, here it was good, but not great, and I actually preferred the Yaki Tori. The chicken was juicy and flavorful and the peppers and onions were solid compliments. For rolls, we ordered 4 of their unique sushi & maki and one of their maki-mono rolls. Halloween Maki: fresh salmon topped with wasabi & black fish egg, wrapped around rice & green bean tempura - The salmon and wasabi overwhelm most of the other ingredients in this one. The green bean tempura was brand new for me, it was warm and crunchy and a very good compliment to the salmon and wasabi. Dragon Maki: fresh water eel & avocado wrapped around rice, eel, scallion, fish egg & cream cheese - Probably my favorite of the five, as Dragon Maki usually is. Loved the eel, the scallions were warm, the cream cheese was a little heavy and gave a mushy texture to the roll, but it was good nonetheless. Rainbow Maki: tuna, yellowtail, fresh salmon & avocado wrapped around rice & crab stick - Very typical for Rainbow Maki, big piece of salmon, the crab was great on the inside. Volcano Maki: creamy lobster mixed with wasabi & tobiko, topped with maki & spicy tempura crunch - First roll I've had that was topped with spicy tempura crunch, it's basically a bunch of shavings of tempura that has a spice to it drizzled on top of the lobster. Second favorite roll here, very good, loved the kick from the wasabi which was very distinct, but not overwhelmingly spicy at all; reasonable for any spicy haters. Soft Shell Crab Maki: soft shell crab, avocado, mayo, fish egg &  cucumber - The soft shell crab was very discouraging for my friend so I was lucky enough to have this roll to myself. Didn't taste much of the fish egg or mayo but the avocado, crab, and cucumber flourished and were really good. I intended to order drinks, but the drinks list was quite pricey so I was forced to leave sober (wahhh).

Then they committed the not so original but still cardinal sin of clearing my plate away as soon I know when they do that, they mean well but someone needs to realize that this is just not acceptable. You have to at least let me swallow my food before clearing the table. 3 stars on food 1 star on well-intentioned but still bad service",-0.9795,0.746,0.055,0.199,0.58828125

I've lived in Japan for almost a year and have had a ton of sushi and I do have to say this manages to live up to the hype in terms of taste.  Sushi is fresh, the tuna practically melts in the mouth, and the presentation is excellent. Few Chicago joints will offer sushi of this caliber.  However, like I said, the environment, servers and price point do leave a little to be desired.  For good Chicago sushi though, it's a must, but don't get anything else as everything else (like the $9 yakisoba or the $16 unagi bowl)  is vastly overpriced.",0.972,0.833,0.149,0.019,0.5333333333333333

The diced up, ruby red cubes of sesame-marinated tuna are not only delicious, but beautiful to behold. Hachi's does a fabulous job with it. They also serve a wonderful Hamachi dish with slivers of jalapeno and a delicious sauce.  I usually split a few of their signature rolls, but this time I got the sea bass entree since I've been hearing it was good.

We started by sharing the Dynamite-baked scallops mixed with flying fish egg, avocado, mushroom & mayo. It was around $10.  I ordered a hot entree, the salmon teriyaki, and it was AAAMMMMMAAZZING. THe sauce was thicker, perfect for mixing with the rice.  And the underside of the salmon had a nice, crispy, smoky flavor.  Plus, the entree came with miso soup and a small lettuce salad with ginger dressing.   The husband had two varieties of sushi, Bagel Maki smoked salmon & cream cheese and the Volcano Maki-creamy lobster mixed with wasabi & tobiko, topped with maki & spicy tempura crunch.   I think we were both a fan of the Volcano Maki. The lobster was tasty and it had a really spicy after-kick, which was nice. The Bagel Maki was kinda blah.  With everything on the menu, I'm sure there are better choices.   I also tried the plum wine (because of a recommendation from here) and it was fantastic.  Smooth and sweet. I texted a pic to my friend to tell her this was our new favorite wine...it was that big.  The place was gorgeous, calm, quiet, and serene.  I LOVED our table in the middle next to lighted vases with orchids.  The service could not have been beat.  Everything was quick, easy and our water glasses never reached the bottom. **** I have recently went back to Hachi (because I am in LOVE).  I tried the Chilean Sea Bass----It has a nice, breaded type crust.

Whether my water needed refilling or some soy hit my table, he patrolled the scene and kept my table tidy. Nice.

Spend your time and attention with the nigiri and sashimi. Wow. But, the star of the show wasn't on the menu. Seeing how much food I was putting away, my waitress asked if I was an adventurous eater. 'Hai.' She returned with a tempura shrimp head -- complete with beady eyes and whiskers. I dipped it in vinegar and took it down. De-licious. I ate around the eyes, though; she thought that was funny. Thanks for the hook up and introduction to the non-menu menu. I want more of that.

NOT chunk by chunk.  Also, I have issues with the HUGE rolls they have (ie. fashion roll). I expect to eat each piece in one bight so as to appreciate the collective flavor.

My favorite (like most people on Yelp) is the spicy white tuna crunch roll, although I have to say that their spicy tuna roll is really different and interesting. Instead of the usual spicy mayo, there are jalapenos in the roll.  The chef's menu (omakase?) will set you back quite a few smackers, but it is totally AWESOME. Serious nom. When we ordered it, the chef came out and asked us a) what our favorite dishes were at Hachis, b) whether there was anything we didn't eat, and c) if we had allergies, if there were any special requests, etc. It was so much fun!

First off, Hachi's is a magnificently designed and decorated space.  Who wouldn't love the recessed, neo-modern lounge area they crafted for you to sit in while you wait for your table?  The wall decals and backlit glass flower vases are all great touches.  Nice job, Crate and Barrel Catalogu-  er, Mr. Professional Restaurant Designer Person. Obviously, the food presentation was also excellent.  I love these little things, and these are the things that make me like going to restaurants like Hachi's even when I'm not a fan of sushi.  I got some chicken teriyaki.  It was was delicious and presented in gourmet style, despite being no more expensive than other similar restaurants that charged as much and simply flopped the food on a plate.  Those finishing touches win the race, guys. I nibbled my friends' spicy white tuna crunch, which we got on the recommendation of just about every Yelper on here.  It was pretty good, and that's coming from somebody who completely misses the point of choking down rolled-up rice, raw fish, and seaweed.   One warning though: you know those items that are marked on the menu as being 4-piece rolls instead of 6-piece?  Same volume, shorter roll.  So: bigger diameter.  Open WIDE for that california roll, sir.  Why, I do believe I saw your jaw unhinge.  Classy!",0.9963,0.734,0.231,0.035,0.5661686725972438

2009-08-04,4.0,"Once upon a time, in a suburb far away, there lived a sushi virgin barely 22 in age. Curiosity seeped in one night in early 2005, and she and her fellow sushi virgin boyfriend searched the online yellow pages (Yelp wasn't in the vocabulary) and blindly made the long journey (ok so it was only an hour) in search of uncooked fish. The location was hip and trendy.. yada yada yada... but she hated it and ended up getting a Maxwell St. polish for dinner. As a result, this poor maiden wrote off sushi for several years after. Flash forward to present time where I find myself indulging on a roll about once a week. Recently, my boyfriend (not the same one as in 2005) was visiting a friend in Logan Square as I was running errands in the area. While I was out, his task was to research and order dinner for us to pick up later that evening. I'm a notorious ""Whatever is fine with me... no not that"" person so sushi was a safe bet. When the day was done, we headed over to Hachi's Kitchen to pick up what he'd ordered. As I drove down California, a synapse explosion occurred. I've never been over here before. Why is this so familiar? No, it couldn't be... it IS the same place I so notoriously loathed! We ordered the Hamachi Jalapeno appetizer (sliced yellowtail with jalapeno and a lemon soy), spicy salmon roll, volcano maki, and crazy maki. The spicy salmon stood out because of the minced texture of the fish. The texture really added to the zesty taste. The volcano maki is an all time favorite. Lobster in a light cream sauce with wasabi and tobiko is all I need to get by. The tempura crunch exterior only added to my love. The only disappointment was the crazy roll. I tried, but there was no way that I could keep a roll with a 3 inch diameter from falling apart. As great as the individual components tasted, it didn't keep this one from being an epic fail. Oh well, you can't win them all. Hachi's, I done you wrong. Sushi is like alcohol. The first taste isn't the greatest, but in time it becomes delicious.

To start on the positives, I think the space is really unique and definitely like the recessed waiting area/table.  I find it strange that a sushi places doesn't have an actual sushi bar but the regular bar is a nice touch, along with the outdoor seating. Now, to the grub and such.  I thought most sake on the menu was fairly over priced.  They have many high end selections but I don't always plan on dropping $50+ on sake when I'm out eating, it would be nice to have some middle road or lower end tasty options.  In addition they have many 750mL choices but few smaller bottles, either way the prices seemed high to comparable places I have been to in the general area.  It would be nice to see more 350mL bottles on the menu and have them be more reasonably priced, ended up just getting Kirin. The Poke, which was the main reason why we came, was just o.k. at best.  If you have never had it before you would probably really like it here and it is good value at $10.  If you have had it at places that do it well you probably aren't going to be that into it.  Agadashi Tofu was sort of plain and way too battered.  It seemed that all of the Tuna they serve spent too much time under the Carbon Monoxide gun, it was just really unnaturally red.  The Crunch White Tuna roll was the highlight of the meal for sure.  I really liked that the spicy tuna handrolls depend on Serrano for spice and not an aioli but again the tuna was strange looking and strange texture.  The Yellowtail nigiri we had was great. All and all I feel like there are tastier better value options in the city and in this general area specifically that means we will probably never be back.  If it was my local then maybe but considering the commitment to get there it failed to knock off our current ""go to"" place.

Loved all the other ""usuals"" (mirai if someone else was paying, sushi wabi, sushi x, usagi ya, and I'm having a brain fart and can't remember the name of Bob San's sister restaurant near downtown...) but always went back to Bob San (best rainbow roll: you can order w/ king crab).

2009-07-12,3.0,"I went here this afternoon with my dad (in town from Philly) and I enjoyed my experience. I wouldn't say it is the best sushi I've ever had-I'm pretty sure I haven't had that experience yet, but I am looking forward to it for sure. This wasn't it however. I started the meal off with miso soup and my dad ordered the edamame. Like others have said, the miso soup was very salty. I'm not saying that it is so awful that it ruins the meal, but I am saying that I'm used to lighter miso soups. This one also had a different coloring than I am used to, it was kind of yellow-orangey. The next time I go back, I probably won't be ordering it, just because I've had better. The edamame was good, as usually they are. These weren't salty at all, and the perfect way to start off the meal. (Note: I really love edamame. So I could be biased) For my entree, I got three different rolls: The bagel maki, name sake avocado maki (salmon avocado roll) and the spicy white tuna crunch. I recognize that the bagel maki is not traditional japanese fare, but I really like cream cheese and smoked salmon, and this roll was how they usually are. Salmon avocado was also delicious, as I think salmon and avocado go especially well together. I was expecting to be BLOWN AWAY by the spicy white tuna crunch after reading reviews before coming here, but I thought it was just ok. I liked the crunch aspect of the roll, but it could have been spicier for me. When I see the word ""spicy"" I want my mouth to be on fire, and not just to feel a little tingling in the back of my throat that can quickly be washed away with water.  To be honest with you, I can't even remember what my dad ate because I was so busy with my own meal. He did try the spicy white tuna crunch as well, and thought that we had much spicier and better before then. More pluses: the setting. I really liked the decor on the inside, it felt as if I were someplace much fancier than I really was. I came here right after opening on a Sunday, and the service wasn't slow at all. My dad even made his flight on time. We were the only people in there for a little while and then as my dad said ""We brought the business with us"" hahaha. More people kept coming in, and it was still pretty early, around 5ish. I'm sure this place gets more crowded on the weeknights and especially on the weekends, so it's nice that you can make reservations.  I didn't think that the prices were that bad (even though my dad paid) and even if he hadn't been paying, I probably would have gotten the exact same thing.

2009-07-10,5.0,"Heh, aside from the food my favorite thing is elongating the pronunciation of when I say Hachi's.  So if you hear me talk about the restaurant it's more like Hachiiiiiiii's.  I guess it's not very surprising thing that I am slurring my words.  I have a habit of talking like that.  And I must say my companion has become quiet deft in distinguishing my slurred language, much like a patient mother does with a babbling 2 year old. What the hell was I talking about? Anyways, this place makes for a lovely date spot, or in my case, double date, cos that's how I roll, you know sushi roll.  The service was very accommodating and even whipped up some custom rolls.  I stuck to my usual assortment of rolls.  The chef was wandering around and mingling.  He even was so kind to fold my napkin when I went to the ladies room and to inform my friend she should eat her giant futo maki with her hands.   Just because it's in Logan Square doesn't mean it's a cheap meal.  But the pretty ambiance and the cool decor, plus the tasty sushi make it all worth it.  And yes, this time they made sure to dim the lights as the evening progressed.  Perhaps they recognized me from my previous yelp review!",0.9756,0.805,0.151,0.044,0.5433811558811559

How convenient! I tried the gyoza, cucumber salad, miso soup, and Chilean sea bass.  The cucumber salad was good but could have used more vinegar. I love it sour! The miso soup came with the Chilean sea bass. It was good but a little on the salty side. It definitely kept me thirsty but the saltiness didnt prevent me from finishing off that soup! Yum. The gyoza was outstanding! But you cant go wrong with anything fried, can you? The Chilean sea bass was out of this world!!! I loved it!! It really gave me hope that Chicago does have delicious fresh seafood after all and I can finally save some money from having to fly to the coasts for some seafood!

It's always caught our eye when we drive by, the only super modern looking building on the block... and we weren't disappointed!  We started out meal with a warm appetizer named Dynamite. A delicious blend of  baked scallops mixed with flying fish eggs, avocado, mushrooms & a spicy mayo sauce. I wasn't sure what to expect. It came out as this cute little mound of deliciousness! It was a small portion to be an appetizer for two but the rich flavors of the scallops with the spiciness of the mayo made it something to savor. I think more than a few spoon fulls would be too rich! Completely delicious.  The staff is very friendly and attentive... almost too attentive... the water boy was refilling my glass after every sip! Which made it hard to have a conversation... but he was just trying to do a good job!  The interior is beautiful, with huge japanese characters scrawled along the walls and ceiling. The lighting is subtle and soft, making it a great date place, or a good spot to meet up with your girlfriends for saki and gossip! And I LOVED all of the fresh flowers that you could find creatively displayed everywhere around the restaurant.  For our main course we had several maki rolls to include the Rainbow Maki and the Volcano Maki. Both were nicely made and displayed.

Those included cold appetizers of Kani-Su which was basically just some fresh king crab claws and the Hamachi Jalapeno. Two recommended rolls were the Volcano Maki and the Spicy White Tuna Crunch. Now I use regular spicy tuna as a benchmark for my sushi places and while I DID NOT like the regular spicy tuna roll (I thought it tasted tomato-y but my friends liked it) I LOVED the Spicy White Tuna Crunch roll.

Nothing to worry about in terms of portion for your dollar when this came! The ""smaller"" maki rolls (with only 4 pieces) were the BIGGEST rolls I have ever seen.

Spicy tuna and rainbow. I won't get the rainbow again, mainly because I didn't realize the crab stick would take up the entire inside with the salmon and tuna wrapped around the outside. Good, but not what I thought it would be. The spicy tuna roll however, I would get again. Not as hot as some that I've had, and the crunchy stuff on the outside (panko? tempura flakes?) gave a really interesting texture.

My Hachi's experience this evening was hardly 'A' or 'OK', in fact it was mediocre at very best. Such a glaring disappointment especially since HK hails from the same owners of Sai Cafe which I've enjoyed for years.   From the way-too-salty miso soup to the super-fishy tasting dragon roll each item was not only unduly expensive but lacking creativity and taste. Their 'fashion maki' a mix of tuna, shrimp, avocado, cucumber and roe was practically fishless, think tons of loosely packed cucumber sticks and gobs of rice with microscopic chunks of wannabe grade-A swimmers. The 'futo maki' served us no better made with crab stick (you may as well just call that crud spam) and cut into 4 pieces the size of hockey pucks. I'll pass on that slap shot, thanks. While I'm passing, I'll pass right on through with their chicken teriyaki too... $16.00 for a handful of dried up chicken pieces that no one at our table wanted to eat or take home... waah waaaah waaaaaaaahhh. Solid and correctly prepared spicy tuna and bagel maki rolls were just about the only highlight for me and of course HK does have to get honorable mention for their stylish digs. They've really outdone themselves with their gorgeous, modern exterior and chic interior to match. I see they still have the original Sai Cafe kani su on the menu which could easily be a redeemer if you want to shell out $14 smackeroos for the king crab app...

2008-08-24,2.0,"First of all this is my first time giving back to the yelp community and I want to thank everyone for taking the time to review places so that I have the opportunity to check places out before I visit. We experienced Hachi's from a take-out perspective, ordering 4 rolls and a soup.  Total tab, $60.  Depending on what you are used to this could be considered either a fair sum for Sushi for two, or over priced.  Regardless of the cost, I have not had sushi this bad since moving to Chicago 2 years ago.  Never before have I experienced such ""mushy"" (as other people who reviewed this place called them) rolls.  I promptly picked up my order and I would wager we began eating within 20 minutes of it actually being  made.  This is almost certainly not a case of waiting too long to eat. We ordered the ""Crazy maki"", which was pretty close to terrible.  Picture various sized nuggets of tuna loosely wrapped and covered with COPIOUS amounts of WET rice.  Not sticky rice, but wet.  There was simply nothing on the inside of the roll to bind the individual pieces, so eating it with chopsticks or by hand was simply out of the question.  I literally had to eat the pieces of tuna one by one from the inside out.  There was nothing crazy about this 12 dollar roll but the price for 4 pieces.   The rainbow roll was passable but once again wrapped extremely loosely and the rice was particularly wet and disgusting.  The only thing on the inside of the rainbow roll was a curiously wet piece of crab stick.  Blah. We ordered 1 simple yellowtail maki, and none of the pieces had enough seaweed to go around, so each and every piece sort of fell apart when you took it off the plate.  The soft shell crab was decent but mistakenly ordered in hand roll leaving us with 1 piece in the whole order.   All of the fish was fresh and tasted fine,  but the execution of the rolls was  worse than anything I have ever witnessed.  Save yourself the money and disappointment and experience sushi in Chicago somewhere else.  I will not be returning.",0.6248,0.854,0.084,0.063,0.5409557547715443

2008-07-23,2.0,"Good food, but jeez... The first time I came here was on a date a few years ago when they had first opened. My companion and I racked up a $90 bill, but it was only because WE were big eaters, and the food was AMAZING. Also, it was winter time and there were very few patrons, so we thought we'd support local business. That first time, our waitress gave us a lot of attention, and we even got a few complimentary pieces of sushi. A GREAT experience all around. I no longer live in the area, and came back recently with friends. Hachi is doing pretty well! First, the decor. LOVELY. Modern and sleek, like an upscale sushi place should look. There's a mirror that allows you to look around the room. One of my friends said, ""I don't like this mirror. It lets you see around the room, and I feel compelled to keep looking!"" I'd seen the mirror, but since it didn't allow me to look at myself (and my beautiful face!) I'd decided I didn't like it. After hearing my friend's response, I changed my mind. He's right! It does compel you to indulge your voyeuristic impulses! Well, at least after you've figured out what it's for. Second, the good. The sashimi and nigiri were great, but not as great as the first time I came here. I'm not really a maki person, but my friends ordered a couple of rolls which were pretty nice. No complaints on the food. Good, good, good! Now for the negatives. Their tempura is not as light and airy as it could be. Also, it's made with panko, which I found odd, since it's usually prepared with an airy and light fry batter. Perhaps this is their spin on tempura, but I like my tempura to be delicate, crispy, light and airy, not crunchy and heavy. Also on my hit list is the service! Jeez! I don't know what was wrong with the server we had, and it may have been a one time thing, but she was absolutely awful. The warm towels are a nice touch, but not when you get them flapped in your face, as it was when our friend, who was a little late, finally joined us. She opened the towel in his face, and seemed a little flustered that we took a little longer to order because our friend hadn't arrived. Later, she did not bring a couple of my friends' orders. We had to ASK for them after we'd waited for a VERY long time. That was NOT good. Then, she poured beer in my glass, although I was done drinking. Hey, thanks, but that was my friend's beer! Chill out, get the order out in a timely manner, and pour drinks correctly! There's no excuse for such amateurish service at a place that's obviously trying to provide a higher end experience. If the service was as good as the food, or as great as it was the first time, when they'd first opened, they'd deserve more stars. As it stands, they'll only get two out of me.

I went again on a Sunday night and it was only about half full the food was just as good as the last time I had went.

It was nice to see that they offer both hot and cold appetizers - I prefer hot ones and was very happy with the gyoza and the dynamite. We've had baked scallops at Tsunami but these were definitely better. In fact, we really liked the appetizers, especially the gyoza. We didn't know the rolls would be so big! We ordered three - the spicy white tuna crunch, the halloween maki, and the rainbow maki - and were quite stuffed afterwards. I've never really enjoyed raw fish (I know, that makes me extremely weird, seeing as I've lived in Asia for a good half of my life) but I really liked the rolls here, and I think that's a testament to the freshness of the fish and how well the rolls are prepared. My boyfriend also had a pair of hamachi rolls and he enjoyed those too. After the rolls, we were so full we didn't order dessert, which is odd for us on the weekends. I like a good sushi restaurant that doesn't leave you hungry. By the way, cold sake comes in these funky square glasses, which definitely got my boyfriend's attention.

The ahi tuna poke wasn't much of a poke at all (it is a dish akin to ceviche, in the sense that the seafood is supposed to be cooked in acid - in this case, citrus juice).. however, instead of the tuna being cooked in citrus juice, it was just plain raw tuna merely topped with a little citrus, with way too much hot sauce (sirarcha, and not the ""fresh wasabi"" mentioned in the menu) which masked the flavor of the tuna completely. It was also served with about forty large slices of cucumber (to about twenty chunks of the ahi), and seemed completely out of place (at least dice the cucumber and mix it with the tuna, perhaps).  The volcano roll, while an interesting concept (granted, I did like the crunchiness, which is something I tend to go for when ordering a restaurant's specialty maki), didn't really taste like much.

Had the waitress have any experience working in a Japanese restaurant, she'd know that ginger is usually eaten after the fish to help cleanse the breath. Adding insult to injury, when I asked the waitress why there's no egg in their chirashi, she coldly responded, ""We don't do that here. Would you like to order one?"".

Digging into my chirashi, I noticed that their rice is mixed with long grain rice instead of pure Japanese rice. The fish is OK and not good by any measure.

I've walked by several times and never went in. The mod clean exterior totally compliments the warm, ornamental interior. The whole scene is extremely nice.  The food was well prepared, although I do think they could be slightly more imaginative with their maki menu. We had the baked scallops, which was very very good, but the texture left me wanting something crunchy with the dish, the radish that was below the clam could been those thin crispy rice noddles and I would of been in heaven. Also the Spicy Tuna wasn't up to my par- but it was decent. The best dish was the Salmon Maki, and the Escolar, Uni, and now my new favorite the Ika ( squid) sushi. We had a glass of the house cold Sake, which was served in a clear plastic Square glass. I felt very very mod being there and would go back.  I pose the question...

2007-05-29,4.0,"I hesitate to write a review for a sushi place, because I have a severely underdeveloped palate for it.  However, compared to a year ago, I know now that Hachi's Kitchen has an anvil load going for it, whereas House of Sushi and Noodles has maybe a 50 lb. weight.   Due to my adolescent sense of all things sushi, I told my friend to order for me because she's WAY knowledgeable such things and has the palate of a master chef.  She ordered us the Halloween, Volcano, Sake Kawa and Fashion Makis.   They were all unbelievably fresh and masterfully rolled.  The Sake Kawa's smoked salmon skin was crisp and really delicious.  The Volcano was stacked in a mountain of perfectly crispy, yet light tempura crunch.  The Fashion Maki was GIANORMOUS and I really enjoyed shoving the whole thing in mouth at once.   Another companion of ours doesn't do sushi so he ordered the Gyo-Za (hand made, pan fried dumplings) and Ten-Don Shrimp & Veggie Tempura.  He hesitated over the tempura because he said last time he ordered it somewhere it tasted like fried Captain Crunch.  This time around he was not disappointed and I think he ate all of it. I used to douse my sushi in wasabi because I love the head-burn it gives you, but my pal has lectured me enough on ruining the flavor of the fish by doing so, so that I abstained this time around.  I must admit, though I missed the wasabi rush, the flavor was much more discernible and the fish like BUTTAH.  Even though we were bordering on stuffed I had to have just one more piece.   After a few minutes and few more sips of the great sake (they have an incredible list), she insisted on the Green Tea Creme Brulee.  I wished I could've refused, but it was moot.   One thing I DO know is dessert and this brulee didn't disappoint even my snobbish standards.  It's nothing like regular creme brulee in flavor; the subtlety of the green tea matches up to the caramelized sugar blanket in almost a mysteriously perfect union and the fresh strawberry and blackberry on top add a touch of tartness to help you discover more complexities in the pudding.   We sat outside and enjoyed the quiet, empty patio, but the interior of the place is also something to be noted.  It's beautifully coordinated in lovely cool earth tones with splashes of red and modern flairs.  There's a really cool sunken waiting lounge and the bar is absolutely stunning.  Our service was unbelievably attentive also, but never pushy.  Logan Square is lucky to have yet another dining gem in Hachi's Kitchen.",0.9964,0.8,0.165,0.035,0.5537054409005627
2007-05-13,4.0,"This place had some great stuff going on. My few complaints are more than negated by the virtues of this place. They have a small sushi menu for a place that specializes in it, but what they do offer up is made with exceptional quality. As others have commented, super fresh fish and excellent service. By far one of the most impressive things about this place was the decor. I never really give a crap about decor or ambiance because they are so secondary to food quality for me, but this place was just beautiful. This atmosphere was in direct competition or reflection of an LA restaurant minus the attitude and pretension. The only thing that seemed off was the prepackaged cheap chopsticks. Dudes, c'mon! You're going to give me beautifully crafted and matched soy sauce containers to plates and then cheap out at the chopstick? Oy! The rice attached to the sushi was that fantastic, but the fish was melt-in-your-mouth smooth guttural noise inducing euphoria. I can't even think of any other way to describe how deliciously marbled all the fish was and how subtle the fragrance was of ocean. Maybe they secretly spray their fish with imported ocean water, but it was that good. The rolls aren't that creative and something like what is normally a Philly Roll was now a Bagel Maki (which I thought was cute). A couple of rolls are pretty unique to them and beautiful such as the Sansai Tako which is spicy octopus with ""mountain veggies"". The Halloween roll also comes with a mix of black and wasabi green dyed roe. The Futo Maki was also intense. I measured it at 3.5 inches wide. Rolls shouldn't be 3.5"" wide! I had to eat with my hands forgoing the chopsticks. Their desserts are fantastic too. I always skip Mochi since if you go to the Chicago Food Corp you can get a box of them for the same price as a piece in a sushi place, it seems a bit ridiculous. However, the Chicago Food Corp has yet to offer up torches and green tea pudding allowing me to fully enjoy the GREEN TEA CREME BRULEE. Oh sweet delicious crispy pudding. Another plus was an awesome Sake list. It's a misconception that it's good to have sake hot. Heating sake is a great way to cover the taste of impurities much like crappy beer is served ice cold as opposed to cellar temp. A good moderately cold sake is not only refreshing, but possesses subtle nuances much more akin to wine and is incredibly smooth (which is why you can get so smashed so fast).",0.9987,0.759,0.215,0.025,0.6733870967741935

The restaurant itself is sleek as well as cozy. The entire front wall is windows so it really makes the small space really airy. Dark wood floors, mirrored walls, vases with stones and flowers really add to the romantic feel of the place.  The service was great. Very attentive, constantly filled our water glasses, asked if we wanted more tea or plum wine and came by as soon as we were finished with a place to take it away.  For the starters we just had the miso soup which I thought was very good tho my husband thought it was a bit on the salty side. We also shared a salad with ginger dressing.  For dinner I ordered the unagi maki and the spicey tuna crunch roll. My husband ordered...I think it was called unagi don. It was all very fresh and delicious. The rolls were a good portion as well.  For dessert our server recommended the green tea creme brulee. OMG It was sooooo friggin good! I could have just lathered mystuff down with that stuff.  We will definitely be back to Hachi's Kitchen and since I am watching what I eat it's a healthier alternative to Fat Willy's...which is the place I usually go to when I go to City North 14 to see a movie.

They do take there time, more so than most sushi joints.  Or it could have just been very busy for a Tuesday.  Prices are a little more than the average Lakeview joint, but nothing too shocking and the extra cash has definitely gone into the food. I had the special (not on the menu) it was a huge 8-piece white fish and jalapeno roll with onion and cilantro, which really made it unique.  It was excellent, maybe the best I've had.  Then on the side, two of my ""go-to"" pieces, yellow fin tuna and king crab.  As mentioned above, you get a huge chunk of fish on the ala carte pieces.  Both were very good.
