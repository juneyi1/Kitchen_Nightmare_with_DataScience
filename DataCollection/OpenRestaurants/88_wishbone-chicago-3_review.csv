There was no salt and pepper on the table, and there was also an old pitcher of creamer on the table from the previous customer.  I ordered the blackened catfish with cheese grits while he ordered the beef hash. The spices on the fish were perfect, however the grits were very bland. His hash was decent and the biscuits were good, but overall the meals were average at best and I do not anticipate going back.",0.8591,0.885,0.099,0.016,0.4333333333333333

Makes you feel comfy and like you're in a real Southern restaurant. Service is always a big thing for me, and our server was kind. We went during a slow day, so it slowed her to be attentive but there weren't very many staff there.  There were so many options and everything sounded good. I ended up getting the shrimp and grits which were so so so good. Now, it wasn't made the traditional way. They had a creamed sauce that the shrimps and grits were in, I believe mushroom based. Whatever it was, it was a nice twist. It came with a side so I got greens. My family had the salmon cakes, greens and red beans and rice. I tried hers and it was delicious. The red beans and rice were so good. The best part was that it was affordable. Often soul food restaurants can be so expensive.

Food: thanks to my peer pressure, I was able to sample quite a bit of everyone's brunch choices. First off, I had iced coffee which came in a huge mason jar (I couldn't even finish it for fear of getting too wired!). I ordered the crawfish cakes which were full of lots of crawfish meat and combined with eggs, sweet red pepper sauce, and cheesy grits, it was so tasty. I split the biscuits and gravy as well, the biscuit was huge and fluffy with big pieces of sausage in the gravy. I also sampled the chicken andouille hash, shrimp and grits, and Cajun shrimp and grits (yes I'm greedy and yes I took advantage of my coworkers' kindness).

He immediately recommended the Cajun Shrimp & Grits which sounded great but I had been eyeing the crab cakes so my order became the shrimp & gifts with a side of crab cake. Now I've had shrimp & grits before although they are a good choice they're never anything to jump up & down about; but these shrimp & grits brought a new flare to the game. The creamy sauce was blended with seasonings adding the perfect amount of spice in with the scallops, mushrooms & little bits of sausage. I found that the buttermilk biscuit (which closely resembled my grandmother's recipe) with a bit of honey was the perfect way to round out the taste.  The crab cake that I received was just okay. It wasn't a bad crab cake but the seasoning & flare that was shown in making the shrimp & grits set the bar high for everything else that followed. I also sampled the crawfish cake & again I felt underwhelmed. In my opinion both the crab cake & crawfish caked lacked the seasoning to make the fish pop. The breading seemed to tone down the flavors so much to where it felt like I was more so eating a cake with some crab/ crawfish in it. I hope you understand that  I also have to admit the fact that my waiter said it would be $4.95 for the crab cake & I was actually charged $6.95 for one was a little like ""aw man come on"". My level of thinking is the whole meal is $11.50 you charged me over half for something like 1/4 of the meal.

2017-03-03,4.0,"I stopped by Wishbone on a surprisingly warm Sunday afternoon with my boyfriend and a friend visiting Chicago for the weekend. We have been trying to eat our way through the West Loop since we moved to Chicago last year, and since all 3 of us love Cajun food, this place was a no-brainer. 5 stars for food, 2 stars for service, and 3.5 for seating and ambience, but because food is the only critical factor for me, overall 4 stars! We weren't too hungry because we'd had a very heavy dinner the night before, so we ordered 2 dishes for the 3 of us - the fried catfish with a side of home fries and a biscuit and the cajun shrimp and grits with a corn muffin. I also got the Mississippi Mudd coffee (iced coffee with a ""southern"" touch) for a much needed dose of caffeine.  The food arrived quickly enough, and the dishes had generous, but manageable portions. I hate it when a restaurant tries to substitute quality with quantity (especially if that quantity happens to be a bland potato dish) but this wasn't the case here! The cajun shrimp and grits had plenty of shrimp and the grits were cooked well and had a semblance of texture (soggy food is second of my list of restaurant peeves). The sauce was flavorful and spicy without burning our tastebuds. The fried catfish was crisp and needed a little bit of seasoning (salt and pepper), but was fresh and one of the best fried fish I've had in Chicago. The home fries were more ""house potatoes"" than chips, and needed some salt as well. The corn muffin was a winner, but the biscuit was a little too flour-y for my taste. The iced coffee was perfectly sweetened and really refreshing. The service was SLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW. I wanted to order my iced coffee as an afterthought, but  our server disappeared after our food order and didn't come anywhere near for a really long time, so I had to approach another server (who was really nice about it!). The place wasn't too busy so I can't rationalize the delay. Similarly, we were waiting for a good 15 minutes to pay the cheque, and finally, we just went in and paid it at the front desk, at which point our server magically appeared out of nowhere to ring us out.

It took a LONG time to get our food.  Not sure why since the restaurant was not busy.  The food arrived hot, which was a bonus.  The portion size on the chicken was pretty small but it tasted good and was very juice.  The brisket was just okay.  I don't think I would order it again.  Maybe it was the way it was sliced, but it really reminded me of gyro meat. The sides.  The cornbread muffin was good.  The collard greens were bland and missing seasoning.  The kale salad was the BEST though.  I am going to have to try to recreate that at home.  The mac and cheese was rather bland as well and we had to doctor it up with some hot sauce.  The hoppin' jack was good--smothered in cheese and scallions.   Like I said before, our server was very nice.  Not the most attentive of servers, but she made up for that in her ""perkiness"" when she was by our table.

This was the family's first time to Chicago and I enjoyed coming outside of the downtown area. Wishbone boasts on its southern menu and I see why they've been named a favorite in Chicago. The service wasn't great; which explains the 4-star, not a 5-star rating; but I'm only referring to our waiter. He seemed a bit distracted and not very attentive. It was a mini reunion at the table and maybe he thought we just wanted our time to catch up, but I just feel like you can still be attentive when people are in conversation...buuut anyhoo. The food came out fast and it was delicious!!!! My entree: crawfish cakes with eggs and grits. It was different and pleasantly delicious! I wish there was more on my plate, because those two cakes disappeared rather quickly  Hubby's entree: blackened chicken. He said he wasn't excited about it. He mentioned it wasn't terrible but the chicken was dry. Children were satisfied for the most part. My son enjoyed his buckwheat pancakes and it filled him up. Daughter had the strawberry pancakes. They cooked the strawberries in the pancakes, which she didn't like (texture) but enjoyed the pancakes. Another daughter had the children's breakfast burrito. It was very bland. It was cheese and eggs...not very appetizing. We sent it back and she got pancakes. So there you go.  The atmosphere is very cozy and inviting.

2016-11-27,2.0,"I ordered from Wishbone for delivery yesterday, and the meal came timely. However, being a true southerner, I was disappointed in a lot of what I ordered. I did like the cornbread muffins (they are sweet like most in the south make). Didn't like their tangy spicy BBQ sauce, their crawfish and salmon cakes aren't nearly as good as I've had at home, and they put sugar in their collard greens. I won't criticise the collard greens too harshly because the sweetness wasn't too much and otherwise great.... some people in the south do put sugar in them, not all, and I just personally don't like collard greens sweet... AND..... DO NOT ORDER THE RED BEANS AND RICE!!!! I was horrified to find the restaurant smothers melted cheddar cheese and salsa on top of their red beans and rice!! As a Mississippi/Louisiana native, I know that NO one in the south would ever ruin our coveted red beans and rice with such toppings! I was hoping for the taste of New Orleans, and instead received the taste of Mexico!! PLEASE STOP putting cheese and salsa on red beans and rice PLEASE! Then I might actually eat at wishbone again! Until then... i can't imagine any true southerner wanting to be a repeat customer from what I ordered.

I had the pleasure of dining with my friend and his Mama while she was in town at what I'd consider to be some great Southern comfort food, depending on what you get! We sat inside on a not-so-crowded Tuesday evening, and our waiter Eli was fantastic in making sure we were kept hydrated and fed. Out first came our corn bread which was pretty good! Be sure to get more during your meal if you have a hankering for it. Next came the Crawfish CakeS... the name is misleading because you only really got a small piece for $6. It had some good flavor to it, but just wished it was hotter and bigger considering how hungry we were. Our food came shortly after and we were greeted with a massive piece of fried catfish. The fish was very good and the batter was crunchy! The size made up for the appetizer, but I wish the batter was more infused with the fish itself. It felt very separate from the catfish, but who am I to complain? It was still good. My sides were the cheese grits and mashed sweet potatoes, both of which were good in itself. For dessert, we ordered the peach cobbler (bomb!) and the Strawberry key lime pie, which was literally a shaved strawberry on top of a slice of pie. While not the most original, it was still good and filling. Wishbone has got its formula down, no complaints there.

The food didn't take too long for such a large party and came out all at the same time. However, it felt like they didn't have a big enough kitchen back there to cook everything because I could tell some of the food was cold and had been waiting for the rest of the food to be ready. My sister ordered Eggs Benedict. One of her eggs came out with a hard center, but being who she is she did not complain. The whole point to me of Eggs Benedict is the poached eggs, but that's okay. I ordered a burger without tomatoes. It came out without tomato, onion, lettuce, or pickles. When I asked if I could have onion, lettuce, and pickles, the waitress brought out lettuce and tomato. When I asked again if I could have onions and pickles, she said she thought I had said I didn't want onions and that they don't have pickles...Kind of strange to me because I read another review that talked about having pickles on her sandwich, but overall my food was fine. I ordered the house fries as my side. They are actually potato wedges, not fries. Disappointed but the potatoes were good because they have added sautéed onions with them so I didn't complain. However, they do not put that on the menu so if you have an onion allergy be careful.

2016-03-13,5.0,"Friends and I were in from out of town and looking for a place to eat Friday night - we stumbled upon this gem after wandering into a few too many places nearby that had 90 minute waits. When we arrived, we got sat immediately, and soon after the waiter was bringing out plates of these complimentary mini corn muffins. Let's just say, if there are carbs in heaven, these things would be front and center - it was like having corn cake cupcakes. For my entree, I got the pulled pork plate, which came with sides of my choice (mac 'n cheese, cole slaw, potatoes). All delicious, and it was around $10 or $12 - unreal considering where we were! Having seen the menu of a BBQ place earlier in the night where the meats didn't come with sides, and sides were $5 each, it was a welcome relief to get such great value. Overall, our service was excellent, and our waiter seemed to go out of his way to accommodate us. If you're looking for a no-frills, diner type of place with a variety of comfort style food, I can't recommend Wishbone enough. It may not have trendy mood lighting or snazzy plate presentations, but if there's one thing millennials like myself enjoy, it's nostalgia, and when you happen to share the same name with a 90's PBS  educational show about a talking Jack Russell Terrier, you've piqued my interest.",0.986,0.833,0.161,0.006,0.5078125

The ham was over done and very tough. The eggs were nicely pouched but the hollandaise sauce was more tart than flavorful. The glass of orange juice was delish! Just slightly expensive for the quantity. The place is good for families . Ppl had strollers and it was very spacious.I was extremely dissatisfied with the lack of customers service. I was seated with ring side view of the front desk. It was impossible to get the attention of our waitress because she was too busy distracting the other waitresses and clean up crew. She was joking and not tending to her tables. One man waited so long to get his check picked up that he got up and handed it in himslef. We also waited longer than needed(mind you she had ignored us the whole meal. She only came to the table once after we got our food) She was extremely distracted and very messy looking. She was the only one wearing a white shirt . This makes ne think she might be a supervisor or manager(I hope not!)

In the past I've eaten the fish and their sandwiches. i recall being underwhelmed by the dining experience and I'd express similar sentiments after last night's visit. I was in the area with a friend and we decided to check it out. We both hadn't been to Wishbone in years. We parked easily right outside the restaurant and were seated immediately upon entry.  Our waiter was prompt and efficient but wasn't exactly warm. That didn't bother us though. He was there to do a job, get his tips and go home. We ordered drinks first but they weren't that great. I got some type of fruit punch but I can't recall the exact name. It wasn't bad but it wasn't very sweet. They also put a ton of ice in the glass so it only took a few sips before it was gone. My friend ordered the ice tea something or another. She didn't like her drink at all but drank it anyway. The drinks were only $5 and as they say you get what you pay for... I ordered the blackened chicken with collard greens and red beans. It was also served with cole slaw and corn muffins. The chicken was good but it wasn't the best. I didn't even eat a third of it. It seemed to be cooked chicken that was charcoaled on the grill. There was no spicy or southern flavor to it. The collard greens didn't have much flavor. They weren't cooked with smoked turkey like I'm used to so there was something missing. I added salt and pepper but it didn't help much. The red beans and rice were the best part of the meal. I could have gone without the onions and bell peppers but I just pushed them to the side. The cole slaw was too tart for me and not creamy enough so I didn't eat it. The corn muffins were sweet and really good. My friend ordered the fried chicken with spinach and red beans. She liked her food much more then I liked mine. She said the spinach and chicken was really good. Overall, I simply wasn't that impressed.

Needless to say we were too lazy to make the trek to Edgewater.  We ended up choosing Wishbone for brunch since the reviews mention grits.  Yes, I know, I know the reviews are not so hot and probably would've been better off going to IHOP. However, every time we pass by the place it is always super packed.  The place inside is alright. Super packed with families and people all wanting to get their brunch on.  Keep in mind that you will probably have 2-3 waiters bump into you while running to the kitchen or delivering dishes. The spaces are pretty tight between tables. We opt to sit inside since most places always forget about their outside diners. Our waiter brought us menus then asked us what we want to order. He seemed highly annoyed he had to come to our table let alone ask us what our order is. When we said we needed time since we just got the menu, the waiter rolled his eyes. Whoa there brah! I asked for a coffee while the fiancé asked for water and he comes back with coffee for the fiancé and I. Before we could even say anything he runs off. The entire time dining no one came to refill our drinks once or even ask for refills. Save your 2.50 and get coffee from Starbucks at least it won't taste like charcoal.  The food was as bad as a Tara Reid's acting. My crab cake eggs benedict made my drunk cooking look stellar. The crab cake was the size and thickness of a York Peppermint Patty.

The excellent service began with the first email inquiry sent, to the finishing touches the day of!  Wishbone staff was professional, helpful, caring and efficient!  Here are just some of the many things we loved about our experience! - The tasting was amazing! Viri let us try so many different foods and even let us take everything home! It was awesome and really sealed the deal for us.  - Viri worked with us from the start of the process, almost one year before the event. She was responsive to each and every one of my emails and genuinely cared about my questions and concerns. She would always give me a quick response and I felt so much better having her during the planning process! She was like my own personal wedding coordinator! Thank You Viri!! - The staff (servers, chef, bartender) we had the day of our wedding were such hard workers and really cared about making our day special. Alejandro, who was our catering captain, was absolutely amazing! Every time I asked him something or made a request he was right there with it! I couldn't have been happier having him there that day! He was so great.  - The food is so different and interesting, my guests raved about the menu and drinks (especially the specialty drink- Electric Lemonade!) I was looking for memorable catering and I definitely received it!!!  Overall, Wishbone was worth every penny. I highly recommend them and am so happy that we chose them for our wedding. You will not go wrong! Choose Wishbone Catering!!!!",0.9968,0.768,0.212,0.02,0.580974025974026

The other three people I was with I think liked their food only ok, but I am giving it a solid 4 stars because they served up excellent, excellent biscuits and gravy. Which is all a breakfast restaurant needs. Further points because this is the first decent sausage gravy I've had up here in the yankee north.

2015-05-15,5.0,"Came in here for brunch two weeks ago, and was blown away. I love cajun and southern food, and this place does it right on all aspects, from the food, to the drinks, to the service. Walking in on a Saturday morning, it was a bit crowded and we didn't have a reservation, but the space is so large we didn't have to wait more than five minutes to be seated. I asked my friend who frequents this place what to order, and she responded with ""just get any of the cakes"". She was not wrong. I ordered the crawfish cakes with cheesy grits on the side, she got the crab cakes and our friend got the spicy black bean cakes. We all shared and all were amazing, perfect blend of cajun and smoky seasonings on all. Grits were perfectly cooked as well, and trust me, they can be gross if they're cooked improperly. Some of our other friends got the chicken andouille hash and eggs benedict, all of which looked mouthwatering. I ordered the Mr. Funky drink and our other friends ordered the hurricane, and front porch tea. My only cricitism of the meal was my drink. The Mr. Funky (which I ordered solely based on the name) was cranberry juice, champagne, and something else, but it basically tasted like Hawaiin punch. I ordered the front porch tea instead for my second drink, and it was way better (their own homemade peach moonshine with iced tea). I noticed behind the bar that they had rows and rows of jars of homemade moonshine in probably 20 flavors. The peach one I had was excellent, and it added to the cool vibe of the restaurant. Even though this place is kind of out of the way in the West Loop, I will definitely be returning for brunch.

That being said, it was a remarkable dinner, with delicious southern dishes, incredible cornbread (yes, I ate the bread!) and reasonable pricing.  If you're ever venturing in the area, this is not a date night special. I had dreamt up a steak house, with rich wood and low lighting, this place is quite the opposite. Colorful, farm patterns, poodles on the walls, 1/2 booth tables..... A unique ambiance given the row of high end restaurants one street over. The menu was small, with vegetarian specials, daily specials, and the largest side dish menu ever, with additional side dish specials that change weekly. Everything had a southern flare, so naturally, I ordered what I presume to be THE staple southern dish : jambalaya (with shrimp). Boy, was I happy I did. The photo doesn't do it justice. The shrimp were incredibly well seasoned, great texture, to the meat and broth, and yes, this food had soul, and a little heat, to warm your heart. It was a relaxed atmosphere, and given there were 8 of us, the perfect place to meet, eat, and enjoy without the pretentiousness of Randolph's restaurant row. I dabbled some into my friends dishes, all were similar in that they were delicious. Cooked with love, and lard, and smothered in thick, flavorful sauces. Our waiter was great, checked back frequently, made us laugh, and added to the experience.

My affair with Wishbone goes back to my college days when a promoter would host an event entitled ""The breakfast club"" at Wishbone when the nightclub closed and that's when I had my first taste of the food of Wishbone which drew my antennas to revisit during normal business hours to try other menu items. Man ooh Man was I in for a treat with the menu items and the Southern charm involved with the preparation of the menu items. The staff is full of life from the servers to the bar backs to the clean up crew. Once you approach this corner gem on Washington you are greeted by valet which prices vary depending on the time you arrive. It's a little cheaper before 10am I believe about a $3 difference. There is indeed street parking but GOOD LUCK with that and Enjoy paying the people who brought the city of Chicago parking meters with a ridiculous hourly rate (still less than valet, but I'm quick to valet if there isn't an immediate space available in view).

We have gone twice now for dinner and are planning on making a weekly visit after we climb. We love their rolls and cornbread muffins! They are incredibly moist and delicious and they will give you as much as you want! Each time we have gone we have ordered different dishes. I love the herb crusted tilapia with sauteed spinach and acorn squash as the sides. They also have a very good jumbalaya which is perfect on cold nights. Parking in the area is free on the street and is typically not too difficult to find. This restaurant is never crowded when we go (7:30-8:00 pm) on a weeknight. We have always had good service when we have gone and it's been fairly quite and a nice place to relax and have a good meal after working out!,0.9935,0.753,0.247,0.0,0.7067272727272728

2014-11-19,3.0,"We visited Wishbone on a busy Friday evening and began our meal with a Seafood Chowder which was very good.  For entrees we had: 1.  Shrimp and grits  2.  Blackened catfish with sides of mac and cheese and mashed sweet potatoes  3.  Salmon cakes with sides of collard greens and red beans and rice. About 1/4 of the way through the entrees I said to myself......... 'dis ain't nothin' but soul food..........probably cooked by Mexicans'. No offense to my Chicano brothers, but, how would you like to go to the local Taqueria and see Ray-Ray nem' in the kitchen?   All of the food was pretty tasteless.  The shrimp and grits dish was decent but nothing special.  They bring it out on one of those huge plates that has a round center about 1/4 inch deep that makes it look like you're getting a lot, but you're really not.  The red beans and rice was pretty much rice with chopped tomatoes on top and about 8 beans (and flavorless).  Mac n cheese? Tasteless.  Greens.....meh.  The salmon cakes were really a soul food dish called salmon croquettes, and tasted like nothing more than canned salmon formed into a round patty.   Our server had a very pleasant demeanor but we only saw her once after she brought the food.  We had to flag down other workers to get a refill of water (which we never got) and condiments.  Another server brought the check but never came back, so we just paid at the register and left.   I was surprised with how unimpressed I was with the food with the exception of the soup.  My wife felt the same way.  This place seems very popular, but I don't get it.  Two and a half stars.",0.9818,0.837,0.127,0.036,0.48198908730158735

Viri and her team were outstanding and handled everything from ordering linens, to setting our ceremony chairs to carving delicious brisket on the spot for our guests. We couldn't be happier with how smoothly everything went. They truly kicked butt.  Our menu consisted of brisket, black bean cakes with mango salsa, salad, mac n' cheese, corn bread, sweet potatoes, stuffed zuchinni and chicken po'boys. The food was even more delicious than we remember it being at our tasting and I saw nearly every guest go back for seconds. Not to mention the numerous conversations I overheard throughout the night of folks talking about how delicious the food was, which just made my heart smile. My husband's niece even said, ""I'm a huge brisket snob, and this stuff just melts in your mouth. Some of the best brisket I've ever had."" Sounds like a win to me.  And the service was out of this world, too. Wishbone's staff was friendly, attentive and just a general blast to have around. They periodically checked in with my husband and I to make sure everything was to our liking, but they weren't over-bearing about it. Truly excellent!

For breakfast, I got my standard crunchy french toast because I love it- and how could I not with this corn flake covered sweet delight? My only sadness at this time was that they were out of fruit bread. But that's like my favorite thing ever. I would eat loaves of it at a time if I could. For dinner, I tried the pulled pork platter with the BoneBQ sauce and brussels sprouts and mac n cheese as my sides. Yep, cleaned my plate. Totally delicious and crave-worthy comfort food.

2014-10-19,2.0,"I've been coming to Wishbone for years. Over the last couple years I've witnessed the service slowly decline in quality. In the past, service was key from the top down. We would get a warm greeting as we entered and the staff was very inviting.  Today I brought my daughters here for breakfast and I must say, I was shocked. Our waitress was great (only reason I gave it two stars instead of one) but then we had a minor issue with hair in my daughter's fruit bowl. Not a big deal, we just asked if we could get a new bowl. The waitress informed us that the manager would be bringing it out. Now... Hair in food is like the cardinal sin for any restaurant, and I could be posting about that, but I also understand things happen. What I did have a problem with is how the incident as handled by the manager. We were told the manager would bring the new bowl of fruit out. After 5 minutes, still no fruit. I want to reiterate, the waitress was great. She asked me if the manager brought the fruit out. After I told her no, a few more minutes passed and a woman who I'm guessing was the manager, brought a bowl of fruit to us. She was originally handing it to me, I then said, ""no, this is for her."" She just dropped the bowl on the table and walked away. No words no nothing. Almost like she had an attitude.  Here's where the complaint comes in. If I'm waiting on a ""manager"" to bring me a bowl of fruit after hair was discovered in the original bowl, I'm kind of expecting an apology, especially since we waited an additional 7-8 minutes for our replacement bowl of fruit. But more so, I certainly don't want to feel guilty because I complained about a hair in my food. Okay... Might seem a bit petty. But as someone that frequents restaurants regularly, service is the one element an establishment can control. When the service is poor from the top down, that's a display of how an establishment values their clients. This was clear indication that their management isn't at all concerned about service, which enough reason for me to not return.  Breakfast/Brunch restaurants in Chicago is a competitive market. It only takes one good or bad review to lose a whole circle of people (potential clients).",-0.58,0.788,0.107,0.104,0.5359458205612051

2014-07-05,5.0,"We got married on June 7, 2014 and used Wishbone Restaurant as the caterer for our big day. Because we had our reception at a Chicago Park District location (South Shore Cultural Center) we had to choose our caterer from a list of approved vendors provided by the city. We met with four or five caterers that fell within our budget. Although several of the caterers we tried seemed to offer the quality we were looking for, we ultimately were swayed by the unique food selections at Wishbone that tend toward Southern cooking.  The primary catering coordinator who we worked with was Viri Anguiano. Viri was extremely attentive and accommodating throughout the entire planning process. It took us several tastings to put together the perfect menu and Viri welcomed us back every time to make sure that we would be completely happy with our choices. This included tastings for appetizers, dinner, dessert, and even cocktails and wine.  Viri also responded to all of our questions and concerns very quickly. Even though we did not use a wedding coordinator, we were very comfortable entrusting all the details to Wishbone on the day of the wedding. And everything turned out to be amazing! Our dinner buffet included smoked brisket, bbq chicken, smashed potatoes, among other sides, and everything was great. We are still getting compliments from guests on the food quality! The bartenders from Wishbone were also great and it was never difficult getting a drink. The catering captain for the day of the event was Alejandro. Although we met him later in the process, he too was so accommodating. The whole Wishbone team was just wonderful in every way! I would highly recommend using Wishbone to cater your wedding if you are looking for great food and an equally great team to help plan for your special event.

My expectations were high for this place since I used to go here often when I lived in the River North area of Chicago. Don't get me wrong -- the food was flavorful but not unique. Quality food?  Some of it was quality. I give the cheesy grits five stars (if I could give it 10-stars I would) as well as the buttermilk biscuits (fluffy, light, buttery, flaky, and melt in your mouth delectable).  We ordered the Wishbone Omelette which was served with potatoes, onions, cheddar cheese & cilantro salsa. There was really nothing unique about this omelette. We also had the Jambalaya Omelette juxtaposed with spicy cajun stew with chicken, chicken andouille sausage, peppers, onion and tomato. This omelette is actually worth four stars, because it was definitely filled with an explosion of flavors. Service was attentive but not over-the-top attentive. Water glasses were filled without us having to ask for more water. Our Server stopped by a few times to make sure we didn't need anything else, which was a nice touch.  If you want to try something different, I highly recommend the Jambalaya omelette (it's big enough for two people to share). The Owner was walking around asking ""how is everything"" to some of the customers, which we appreciated. It illustrates how involved he is with his business and that he has a passion for his restaurant as well as customers. There are dishes on their menu that appeared to be Vegan friendly as well as a good place for Vegetarians. If I am visiting my friend again, who lives a few blocks from this restaurant, I would stop here again. I want to give them a second chance and, hopefully, bump it up to five stars the next time around.  This is the kind of food that one would eat during cold winter months.

I might try a more traditional Southern dish next time, and my wife said the black bean cakes were pretty good.  Not even close to the top tier of brunch places in Chicago but a very solid performer if you've got kids and can sort through the large menu for a winner.  (With a menu this large and space this massive, it would be almost impossible to be great and cater to all of the brunch audiences Wishbone is trying to cover.)

A few days before, I sent her a list of everything and where it all went. My mom and my husband's mom were both nervous that everything would be put out correctly, so they went to the venue about an hour before cocktail hour started.  Imagine my surprise when we got back from taking pictures and they were both waiting in the lobby, chatting, and looking not the least bit stressed.  Apparently when they got there, Linda and her staff had everything set up perfectly and there wasn't a thing for them to do. Also, we really appreciated the way Linda worked with our budget.  They didn't charge a cake cutting fee, and Linda was great when it came to adding extras, like coffee, late night food, etc. As far as the food...it was great.  I've had multiple people tell me they loved the food and passed appetizers.  What I had was really good, and my husband liked it a lot too (he can be a picky eater, so that was a bonus).   There were a few hiccups, but nothing too bad.  They ran out of brisket on the buffett, which was one of the main dishes.  I think we had told them 115, but we only had 112 there, so I was surprised that they ran out (I think maybe only 3 or 4 people were left when they ran out).  It was just a little disappointing, since they had someone carving it, so they should have known a little better how much to give each person so that everyone was able to get some. Also, we ordered the alcohol through Binny's (who takes back everything unopened).  There were a few bottles that were opened, but still full, and some of the beer didn't get  into the ""back to Binny's"" pile at the end of the night.  Overall, less than $100 in alcohol, but still slightly annoying. I would definitely use them again to cater an event.  Linda was very knowledgeable, and definitely a great resource when I was wedding planning.",0.9978,0.802,0.174,0.025,0.46693333333333337

I started with a glass of fresh squeezed orange juice which was a little cheaper than what it usually costs at a brunch place.  It was so hard to decide what to have, but I finally went for the chicken andouille hash with sunny side up eggs and wheat toast.  I was starving, but my portion definitely seemed more manageable than most breakfast joints.  The hash was pretty good, sausage a little bit spicy and cut in small pieces.  Onions and potatoes all cooked to the right texture.  I had fun mixing my egg yolk around in there.  Eggs could've stood a little more cooking, they had a layer of that clear slippery stuff on the top that I pulled off with my fork and moved to the side.  Not very appealing.  Wheat toast was yer regular sandwich bread, butter came from little packets on the table. I didn't taste it, but my friend got the crunchy French toast, which appears to be deep fried.  She said it is her favorite thing, and it did look pretty delicious - her side of bacon was also beautifully crisp as she requested. All-in-all it was a really standard brunch.  The flavor of the sausage was the only above-average thing about it.  It was certainly satisfying but very similar to what you can get almost anywhere else.  I'd be happy to come back though, as the Southern menu looks so delicious and promising, I can't help but think some dishes may be good, but others are hopefully great!  Worth a try I'd say, and hopefully they'll exceed expectations!",0.998,0.702,0.257,0.041,0.5491441544566545

We started out with an appetizer that maybe it was called fried green tomatos? It's like a batter with tomatoes inside. I did not like it. It wasn't for me...I had one piece and couldn't finish it. As an entree I ordered the salmon cakes with mac and cheese and home fries (whole potatoes) as my sides. My salmon cakes were decent. The mac and cheese were meh, and the home fries were decent. One friend ordered the crab cakes - she liked it, she ate it very fast along wtih her side of green beans and sweet mashed potato. My other friend ordered their catfish with the same sides. I'm not sure how he felt about his catfish. There were no reviews. We ended the night with bread pudding. It was an actual slice of cake! I guess our impression of bread pudding is completely different. It was only my one friend who ate the whole big piece. He said it was good.  Overall decent food, but I'm not sure if I'll come back again. Like I said this kind of food is just not my type. What I did like about this place is that we were able to stay and chat for a long time. We finished eating and paid the bill, and we were still able to stick around. They close at 9pm on a weekday and we stayed close to 10pm without the staff kicking us out. I can tell they were closing up since they closed some of the lights, only one staff was around to clean up, and some of the tables and chairs were moved.

2013-08-03,2.0,"This place sucks.  I'm actually very curious how it can have so many 4 and 5 star reviews.  Perhaps those folks aren't familiar with properly cooked BBQ. Last night I had the brisket plate.  They didn't put any effort into the mac and cheese side I got (and it showed) but I was able to eat it.  Anyone can cook just as good mac n cheese out of any box from the grocery.  The home fries were ok.  There was no way that brisket was cooked that same day.  If it was, they need to fire everyone who handles their meat.  It was pretty clearly reheated or just over cooked to death on the first go.  I'll give their meat guys the benefit of the doubt and assume that it was cooked mostly properly the first time and that they just reheated my plate. As a BBQ place you have to get your brisket right.  They didn't.  So I feel the most I can give them is 2 stars.  I grew up in Texas and have had far more than my fair share of BBQ.   Our waiter was bad/slow as well (I am not one to typically complain about service, but he was especially bad). As a point of comparison, Smoque over by the Irving park blue line stop is LIGHTYEARS ahead of this place.  Perhaps whoever cooks their meat should go by Smoque and get some tips.",0.7777,0.803,0.111,0.085,0.5001035196687369

The collards are boiled and a bit salty, just how I like them. The salsa gave the black bean cakes a little kick. But actually, what I was most excited about was their coleslaw. I never cared for creamy coleslaw, but I loved the more oily, vinegary slaw I had in Memphis. That's what Wishbone serves! I inhaled that first before touching the black bean cakes, which had turned a little soggy due to greens' juice spilling over (darn delivery).

We were able to pick a unique menu (apps; mini pulled pork sliders & black bean cakes.  Dinner; brisket, veggie hoecakes, asparagus, corn muffins, a gratin potatoes etc) at a reasonable price.  The quality of the food was excellent and we received a lot of compliments from our friends and family.  Our food was unique and most importantly it tasted good! Because our reception venue was BYOB Wishbone also provided us bartenders.  Wishbone organized table renters and wait staff.  They were always open to meeting with us and set up everything on the day of.  They were dependable on the day of and Viri was very detail oriented.  Our guests commented on how friendly the wait staff was too!

I know there are sweet potatoes, so clearly I'm trying to dig further.

2012-04-29,3.0,"The following are the pros and cons from my first visit with my husband. We got eggs florentine, biscuits and gravy, and crab cakes during brunch, all to share. Pros: Cool items on the menu Crispy homefries (maybe even deep fried?) Pretty good corn muffin Cool interior They offer real maple syrup for an up-charge They discount for bikers They bagged our leftovers in some earth-friendly plastic Cons: A rather un-appetizing dog (""Wishbone"") with crooked teeth plastered all over the place Home fries were not especially flavorful unless you scooped the few sautéed onions onto them, but there were not enough for this purpose Crab cakes were mediocre, which is an even bigger shame considering their price tag and the restaurant's theme. No crab lumps in them, just pulverized crab fibers wrapped around too-spicy bread goo without much additional flavor. The biscuits in the biscuits and gravy were fine, but not amazing - as in, you wouldn't probably want to scarf them UNLESS they were covered in sausage gravy. I had to ask for a refill on coffee after sitting with an empty cup for quite a while, which is just horrendous in a place that does breakfast. They gave me a little pitcher with about 10 ozs of cream in it even though I was the only one having coffee. This was promising for me, because I use a lot of cream, but as they only refilled my coffee once at my request, one of two things happened: 1) 9/10ths of the creamer went to waste, which is not at all earth-friendly; 2) they reused it for someone else's table after a quick chill. Either way, I am not happy with the result. They bagged our leftovers in plastic. Yes, I know I put this down as a pro above - a pro for the environment because it's recycled - but it's a con for me when my hot food gets stuffed into plastic so that it becomes a nice chemical soup. I say to this restaurant and every other restaurant packing plastic, KEEP IT AWAY FROM MY HOT FOOD, please. We didn't try the pancakes, but we got a peek at someone else's; they looked a little like tortillas, which I take it is not good. I'm giving it 3 stars because it is certainly worth a try and my cons are pretty picky, but in a city with so many restaurants to try, I wouldn't waste my time returning to a restaurant of this caliber unless I happen to be in the area wanting Southern food.",0.5527,0.833,0.092,0.075,0.5262426900584797

The blue claw patties were warm and crispy topped with lemon butter sauce accompanied by two eggs, seasoned home fires and toast. A great deal and everything was awesome on the plate.  Flash forward a couple weeks for lunch. Blackened Catfish Po' Boy was a good alternative to chicken or beef. It was slathered with spicy remoulade on french bread. Served with Yankee coleslaw. Sounds like a plate full right? Wrong, it looked as if there might have been something missing (see picture). The sandwich was great, the slaw was limp and off putting.

2011-06-05,4.0,"I love Wishbone! It is one of a few restaurants I consider a go-to emergency eatery as well as a place to intentionally plan dinner. There seems to be something for everyone--vegans/vegetarians as well as confirmed carnivores, health food enthusiasts as well as comfort food cravers, and mildly-seasoned items in addition to hot & spicy entrees. I can't imagine anybody who would walk in here, look at the menu, and be unable to find a single thing to eat. You also get an insane amount of food here, friendly service, and non-scary bathrooms. The sweet tea floweth into your cup, the smoothies are made with real fruit and not syrupy crap, and there are specials every day. My order always comes out right, my mango salsa is always fresh, and my belly is always full when I leave. I must, however, hold back on the fifth star for now, much as I might like to award it to Wishbone. The menu sometimes labels things as vegetarian or vegan, but not other times. There are things that sound like they would obviously be vegetarian but actually aren't because they are made Southern style, and some things that sound like they'd have animal products in them but don't. This is fine if your staff can answer a diner's questions about what is in the food on the menu. Unfortunately, some of the wait staff don't know much about the menu and on one occasion couldn't tell me what an Orange Julius even is besides ""something with orange juice in it."" (I realize I should know this myself, but cut me some slack--I couldn't even drink OJ for five years!)

In which case, the happy workers luncheon becomes a bloody fight to the finish...  Just kidding!! Hah, but no. The cornbread really is that good and I'm not even usually a fan of cornbread. The reason I docked a star is for dinner portion sizes.  Having had such positive experiences with lunch takeout, I decided to treat the bf here to dinner.  I was surprised to find that the dinner portions were as small as the lunch portions. I ordered crab cakes and that was ok, but the bf ordered jambalaya. Looking at his plate, both he and I were kinda left scratching our heads thinking ""wait, is that seriously it?""  Oh well.  Good thing there were cornbread muffins.

First you get to pick between cheesy cornbread muffin things and something else (not sure who picks something else, cornbread is never ever the wrong answer to a question).  For my entree I got the bowl of chili, which is different than most chili's.  It's served over a bed of rice, and all very thick.  I ate it with a fork!  But it's fantastic and meaty and saucy and mmm.  I also tried my fellow diners' shrimp and grits and sweet potato side dish, both phenom. It's one of those places with a small to normal sized menu, yet you found at least 10 things you want to try.  Love that.  Also, bonus, great outdoor seating area.  And, although not my thing, one of my dinner-mates was very pumped to discover all-day breakfast service!  Can't wait to go back!",0.9904,0.794,0.206,0.0,0.5787198067632852

We have experienced that the last 3 times we were there.  We are always quick to compliment great service, figuring there is no use in even wasting energy on the bad service...BUT enough is enough already.

LOL She is also a big eye roller and G- forbid if you comment on the service. She is quick to defend, claiming, maybe she is having a bad day..Really, then she should have stayed home... Other servers show up just as you are being seated to ask if you are ready to place your order as if they didn't see the hostess seating the party. Once the order is placed, drink your coffee slowly because they ration out their coffee-only one cup per person!

Kid Wes: You like French Toast! You like corn flakes! This is french toast AND corn flakes! ...and so I decided to give Crunchy French Toast a try.  Although not for lack of trying, it turns out that you can't combine things that you like, and always bring out what you liked in each individual component. In this case, I always liked the soft sweet taste of french toast, and the crunchy goodness of corn flakes. Combining the two negated what I liked about each: the french toast was no longer soft and tender, and the corn flakes added texture, but not necessarily crunchyness. It was certainly an acceptable dish, but certainly not the mind-blowing experience that Kid Wes was hoping for. That being said, I've always found Wishbone to be a delightful eating experience. I met a group of friends (with kids) today, we were able to get seating with minimal issues. (it's a lot tougher when the weather is milder of course!) They put out crayons and something to color for the younger ones, and have the wooden toddler seats if you need them and a kid menu.

The place was packed but we scored a table right away which was pleasantly surprising. Our server hurried over and within moments orders were taken and anticipation began.  I ordered the southern benedict (picture eggs benedict except for biscuits instead of muffins and sausage gravy instead of hollandaise). The gravy was great but the biscuit tasted a bit dry. Also- it came with potatoes but I was totally done with my eggs before the server could find me ketchup to go on the potatoes-and this was after several requests.  I also think that had the timing been better at the bar- I might have had more than one bloody mary. It just took so long to get the one that I was hesitant to order another.

So needless to say I was really excited to put it to use. Anywho... I must say the staff was very friendly and being that it was a Tuesday night, there was no wait. Everyone seems to be giving rave reviews about the cheesy grits so my friend ordered them as an appetizer. Neither of us cared for them and were in fact quite disappointed.  We both ordered drinks. I got my normal Cosmo and he got the Electric Lemonade. Both drinks were very strong. Mine tasted like straight vodka. But I felt like I got my money's worth in that sense.  For dinner, I ordered the meat loaf with the rosemary gravy. For my sides I got the Mac & Cheese and the greens. The meatloaf was mediocre. The mac & cheese was ok. I make better at home. The greens tasted like they had a tad too much vinegar in them but were still tolerable.  My friend had the pulled pork, which was really the only BBQ thing on the menu and he LOVES his BBQ. However he was slightly disappointed when his plate just had a bunch of pulled pork on it and no sauce. They served the BBQ sauce in a little cup on the side. For his sides he got the mac and cheese and the home fries which he found to be just ok.  We both agree that the best part of the whole meal were the corn muffins. I could have just eaten those and left happy. They were quite yummy.  Even though we were both pretty full, we couldn't resist trying the desserts. I had the praline cheese cake which was totally homemade, definitely not made somewhere else or out of a box. The praline topping was very tasty. I should have gotten some coffee to go with it.

The food itself was a huge disappointment.  First up was the shrimp and grits (a favorite dish of mine from the south).  Wishbone's version consists of un-cleaned shrimp and canned mushrooms swimming in a gravy-esque sauce over a bed of soggy grits.  It frankly grossed me out, and I couldn't stomach more than a couple of bites.  For main dishes, we ordered the jambalaya stew and the black bean cakes.  The jambalaya is definitely more of a stew than the thick rice-based dish it is in Louisiana.  It tasted more like tortilla soup than anything else.  The black bean cakes were tasteless and bland.     In fact, all of the food we tasted at Wishbone was extremely BLAND--and seemed to be completely lacking in seasoning.  The one bright spot of the evening was the mashed sweet potatoes with nuts, which have a good natural flavor and a nice texture.

The strange thing is we didn't wait long for our food so I find it bizarre that they could have prepared it and some how allowed it to get that cold prior to bringing it to our table.  The whole situation was really peculiar.

It's a drive for me to get there.  Now:  The food is pricey, yes. And it's cooked just about perfect, IMO. I love how everything tastes non-commercial, like someone actually made this in a proper home kitchen and then thought, you know, hey - I could serve this in a restaurant! I am willing to pay for better quality, and that's what happens here.  The decor is...eclectic. The owners were adamant about that sort of style, and they are characters themselves. Why do I know this? because my best friend designed it to their wishes, a long time ago. I think it's funky. Where else can you go and see that kind of art up on the walls? I like it.  Slow service. Well...yeah. I can't really spin that one, other than the fact that it has been SO FARGING BUSY whenever I've been there, and everything is so...difficult to navigate...that it makes sense. It's not an awful time to wait, but figure maybe 20-30 minutes past the order when it's busy. The Sunday wait is unavoidable, by and large. Church groups, families, groups of sheepishly hung over friends...you will find them all here. You will be sat after them. Happens.

It's annoying when the idiot the next table over continually elbows your shoulder, or won't get up out of his chair when the leg of said chair is on your coat, or talks too loud. Every so often, I have seen good conversation start up between two tables full of people who didn't even know each other. But let's face it: they are trying to pack them in. The line is crazy - there are tons of people. And they could have a mutiny on their hands if it isn't all orchestrated right. So, I look the other way on this minor irritation of the personal space bubble. Yup. It's in the middle of an area that is being built up right now.

Then she asked why? BECAUSE SHE F-ING ASKED YOU TO. Of course I did not say this but I sure as hell was thinking it! then after she gave her the water she came back and asked very snootily ""how's your water?"" There were two other people at the table drinking water. She didn't ask us. So we felt offended by her. It is not her job to judge or make fun of her customers and their little idiosyncrasies. Also I ordered a watermelon lemonade. When she brought it to the table it was frozen. I was unaware of this because it was not stated on the menu. It said fresh squeezed. I explained this to her and she just gave me a blank look. Then she finally asked me if I still wanted it. I told her no. She took the drink and NEVER asked me what I wanted to drink instead.

2007-03-25,5.0,"I now consider chef Joel Nickson a friend, but I was enjoying his cooking long before I ever met him. His first Chicago place over on Grand Ave. was THE spot for weekend breakfast (the wait be damned), even before branching out to the West Loop, Lincoln Park and now... FitzGerald's Nightclub in Berwyn. Here's the deal about Wishbone's food, and every other restaurant in the world: Consistency is the holy grail, as everyone has a slightly different interpretation on a recipe, regardless of measurements and training and skill level. That's what's good AND bad about cooking - every individual imparts a slightly different feel into what appears to be the same dish - on paper, anyway.  Not to say Wishbone's food isn't good - it definitely is. But when Joel's cooking, his personality, style & chemistry all come together in the kitchen, it's just dynamite on a plate. As I've told Joel, I think whichever of his restaurants he happens to be working at the time has the best food - because he's there to keep an eye on things.  Another thing about Joel: The guy really has the ""touch,"" and is truly beloved by his customers. The guy has more fans in the city than you can imagine, from heavy politicians to world-famous professional athletes to artists & musicians, famous entertainers (whassup, Oprah!) to mobsters, cops, ad agencies and everyone in between. Quite a blend. Finally, somebody show me another restaurant in town where there seems to be an equal appeal with black &  white customers, all digging the same menu, sitting side by side during a crazy busy brunch.

The restaurant is huge and we were seated immediately, though the place was crowded and larger groups were waiting for tables.  We were approached quickly and both ordered mochas served in pint glasses - pretty tasty and huge. I have the bean cakes and eggs with home fries and a biscuit.  M. henry has my holy grail of bean cakes, to which all others are measured - and these did not stack up, as they were overcooked and dried out.  The mango salsa with them was tasty.  Scrambled eggs are pretty basic, but mine weren't great, they kind of tasted like fake eggs.  The home fries were absolutely delicious, well-seasoned and the perfect texture, and the biscuit was also really tasty. My bf had the crab cakes which were also dry and overcooked, but had potential.  He had cheese grits and a corn muffin - the grits were pretty good, but the corn muffin was dry and bland. Pros - biscuits, home fries, grits, huge mochas, friendly/quick service, valet. Cons - dry bean/crab cakes, bland corn muffins, weird eggs. Wishbone is ok, but not great.  I would give it another shot, but there are so many brunch spots to hit that it might take awhile.",0.9643,0.804,0.139,0.056,0.7617816091954023
