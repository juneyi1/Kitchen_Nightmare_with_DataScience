Place is also very noisy. GREAT PLACE TO BRING YOUR NEW BORN BABY AS NO ONE WILL HEAR THE CRYING.  The chicken sausage was really great and enjoyed it. But the potato sausage was very ordinary.   The staff is very helpful and friendly.

2017-08-21,4.0,"A Wrigleyville Sunday morning and breakfast was beckoning.  8:30 in the AM, 74 degrees, sun shining, and no humidity. How often does that happen in Chicago... in August?!?  Win! Read about the Cinnamon Rolls so figured Ms. Baseball Funkette and I would head over to worship at the breakfast alter of Ann Sather.  About a half mile easy stroll and when we arrived we had our pick of tables. Yep we beat the crowd. Another win! A simple menu with eclectic offerings in my used-to-Cracker-Barrel opinion. This morning we sampled a Traditional Eggs Benedict ($11.50 w/Country Ham) and a Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict ($13.50 w/Norwegian Smoked Salmon & fresh dill). Each entree came with a choice of two sides: Two Homemade Cinnamon Rolls, Two Hot Biscuits & Honey, Toast, Hash Browns (Add Cheese $.50), Fresh Fruit, Sliced Tomatoes (in Season), Apple Sauce, or Low Fat Cottage Cheese. We mixed it up with cinnamon rolls (killer), hash browns (cubed fried and seasoned potatoes), fresh fruit (outstandingly fresh), wheat toast (from a local bakery) and a bottomless cup of flavorful coffee. And share all, we did! Service was comfortably friendly with just the right amount of attention. The only thing that held up the fifth star for us was just a little too much salt from the country ham and salmon. Would we return?

The server confirmed with the manager - if we wanted to use our own juice they'd charge us $5. This corkage juice fee was more than the cost of their juice for sale on the menu?  I would not have lugged a bunch of juice over if I was told the correct info to begin with. I tried to explain someone on the phone said I could use my own juice. I think because of the discrepancy they should have just honored what was said on the phone.  They also proceeded to uncork my champagne when it was clear we were not happy and confused by the juice situation.

I had wanted to order a meat side dish, but no he shut me down by delivering the check so early.

For those unfamiliar with that particular area, there's literally a great restaurant several meters in every direction. So to say that Ann Sather is rising to the top means that they're standing out in a crowded field.  The dining room can get crowded, but I've never had to wait longer than 5 minutes for a table as a walk-in. Service has always been speedy and courteous. Most servers I've spoken to have been consistently energetic, charismatic, and have never let our water glasses or condiments sit too long before refilling them.  As others have mentioned, the cinnamon rolls are delectable and are a must-try. The cinnamon rolls are served in pairs so you have the option to share if you don't devour both of them by yourself. They are sweet, fluffy, and ENORMOUS! It's almost overwhelming receiving two large cinnamon rolls along with your entree. For me, a good strategy is to eat one cinnamon roll and one half of my entree and take the rest home. This allows me to enjoy a second full meal at a later time.  My go-to entree is the Lumberjack wrap. This wrap suits my insatiable appetite, as it contains hash browns, egg, cheese and sausage wrapped in a flour tortilla. I absolutely love this wrap. My fiance's go-to entree is the Southern Decade, which I have also had in the past. It consists of two poached eggs over sausage patties and biscuits with gravy. Basically, it's a variation of Biscuits and Gravy and the dish is wonderful. I always leave Ann Sather full and satisfied!

I ordered coffee and the inferno omelet. The coffee was good and my mug was always full despite the busyness of the morning. The omelet also had good heat and was cooked well. The hash browns were more like a potato salad though. I was definitely a bit dissapointed, but the cinnamon rolls more than made up for it.  Portion sizes were perfect.

I have been greeted by chipper and friendly staff at every visit. They have a large variety on the menu, not limited to breakfast items, but if you're coming here, you come for the cinnamon rolls. Ann Sather's cinnamon rolls are known all over, and have definitely been mentioned on some Food Network shows. When you order a meal, you get 2 sides and 2 cinnamon rolls is 1 side. This alone is insane to me because they're not just mini rolls, they're large rolls. Imagine a regular square cake tin and put 4 cinnamon rolls in it, that is the size of each cinnamon roll. I usually balance my order of cinnamon rolls with some fruit or salad, but the potatoes are good too. It's best when you can convince a friend to share sides so you can have a taste of everything.  While everything at Ann Sather is delicious, I have consistently ordered the Crab Cake Benedict. I have tried to order something else, but nothing quite compares to it and I always go back to the crab cake benedict.

My Benedict was just okay, nothing special.  For those who complain about the price, I have to disagrees. For $29 we had 2 massive meals, a coffee, and orange-strawberry-banana juice.

Also, their fruit side is always fresh and has a fun mix of fruits (not just cantaloupe).  I ordered the eggs benny with smoked salmon, which was heavenly.

However, the same cannot be said for the rest of their menu, which featured less than 50% Swedish/Scandinavian dishes (what drew us here in the first place). Case in point: my friend' lingonberry waffles were not as fluffy as we'd hoped, and my meatballs could only be described as satisfactory.  Service- It's busy but the service doesn't suffer terribly from it, and in fact the waiters are very efficient in table turnover times. They do a good job of cleaning up, refilling drinks, and somehow attending to tables in the purposeful tumult that characterizes such popular diners.

The wrap comes with their house guacamole and eggs and cheese. Personally, there was just TOO much egg in it. The egg wasn't scrambled. Instead, it was made into a sheet. It was probably made of 3-4 eggs. I wish I had asked for just egg whites. I had to take some of the egg out for my sake. Everything else about it was good though. Hehe. It was really big! I only finished half.  The fruit was great. They had a wide variety: watermelon, cantaloupe, honeydew, kiwi, strawberry, pineapple, blackberries, grapes, etc. I hate when you order a side of fruit and they only have 3 different fruits so this was great.

I would pretty much second other reviewers' comments about the cinnamon rolls.  Clearly, they are the Ann Sathers specialty and completely delicious! As far as the other breakfast food is concerned, we were mixed.  I had simple scrambled eggs and my guest had a bacon and cheese omelette.  We both found our meals to be average, not worthy of a return visit though admit the portions are huge.  This place is a great value, but maybe you have to stick with pancakes or the waffles to be truly wowed.  The main issue with the breakfast was really the sides, mostly the hash browns.  If anyone at Ann Sathers reads this, please update or re-make the style of the hash browns.  They were just diced and seasoned red potatoes and added nothing to the meal.  More appropriate maybe for a Thanksgiving dinner.  I also tried the Swedish meatballs and thought they were okay but average.  Have tried much better Swedish meatballs at a few different Swedish restaurants in New York.

We all started off with some coffee which we desperately needed after a late night of craziness. My friends ordered the waffle with strawberries which looked great although I didn't taste it. Another friend ordered the Swedish pancakes with lingonberry jam, which was amazing! The lingonberries are similar to cranberries and were sweet and delicious! I went for the crab cake benedict, which comes with two sides! I chose the cinnamon rolls after hearing several people raving about them and the hashbrowns. The crabcakes were large and delicious. They crab cakes were packed with flavor sitting on top of toasted english muffins with poached eggs perched on top finished with a rich hollandaise sauce. The portions are very generous and I ended up having to take the majority of my dish home. The cinnamon rolls definitely lived up to and surpassed my expectations. One side of cinnamon rolls consisted of TWO HUGE rolls...these came out first and even with three people, we weren't able to finish them...probably why I didn't have room for the rest of my food. The hashbrowns were just alright...I like mine to be crispy on the outside so they were a bit of a letdown for me, but everything else was incredible.  Service and staff were impeccable.

Not really a brunch place so much as breakfast place.  The menu is pretty average as far as offerings especially if you aren't wowed by a large variety of benedicts.   I got the eggs and potatoes--which were good or really just not screwed up because ultimately eggs and potatoes have limited potential.  Note: order the hashbrowns cripsy or they will be mushy.  Also beware of ""applesauce"" on the menu because it is not actual applesauce.  Its overly sweetened and soft apple wedges like something you would put in a pie or a turnover---not something you would want to eat by itself.  The cinnamon rolls were great!   Big plus is that its BYOB with no corkage fee and a super friendly staff that opens the champagne for you!  They provide both half and full pitcher options of juice that is not too pricey.   All in all its not really a destination brunch but if you are in the neighborhood  (which is easy given the multiple locations) and want breakfast, its a solid option. Timing and price: We went at 10:30 on Saturday morning, didn't wait for a table or really for service and for 4 people the brunch ended up being about $65 (including the large quantity of juice to go with our 2 bottles of champagne).",0.9503,0.858,0.119,0.022,0.466025641025641

The reason I won't be going here anymore deals with their owner, Alderman Tom Tunney.  Tunney is the chair of the City Council's Economic Development Committee and is bound and determined to bar Chicago food trucks from being able to cook in their own trucks.  Sorry Ann Sather, you just aren't too good to BOYCOTT!",0.9874,0.737,0.227,0.036,0.5180555555555555

Everything looked fresh and nicely presented. All their egg entrees come with 2 huge sides that almost seem like a meal in themselves. (I didn't realize that when I first chose my dish). Their cinnamon rolls were really good. The hash brown was more like diced potatoes, but still good and well seasoned regardless. I got the traditional eggs benedict which were good but almost too simple. I guess I should have ordered something more interesting. Service was also fast and attentive for such a busy restaurant.

Swedish Pancake: Very unique - I have never had one this light and fluffy. It's a cross between a breakfast crepe (it's slightly sweet) and a thin pancake. Pretty good with the mustard they have in house. Fruit Side: I asked for it...my bad. Apple Cider: Boo, tastes like Jewel pasteurized cider. Sorry.

I don't like my food to come anywhere near things that have been on kitchen prep surfaces. A greasy little ring is often left behind when you remove these dishes from your plate.  3) Tom Tunney owns it.

Prices are a bit high for some, but given the copious amounts of food (I thought) that was served, I thought that it was reasonable.

It was my first time going to Ann Sather and I'm sure I wouldn't have gone if it wasn't for those Cinnamon Rolls being featured on Food Networks, ""the best thing I've ever eaten"". As a result of watching that show, I acquired a desire for these cinnamon rolls. I drove to the North Side, from the West Side for a scrumptious before Super Bowl brunch. There was no wait and I was there at like 11ish, I was pretty happy about this. The tables are, however, pretty close together. So, I sit, and am tended almost right away (good service). As I always do, I ask my server about the Smoked Salmon Benedict and she said it's scrumptious, so after thinking a tad bit longer, I go with that. All egg dishes come with 2 sides, so I go with the Cinnamon Rolls (DUH) and a bowl of fresh fruit (to feel good about myself). The Cinnamon Rolls came immediate and they were GOOEY! OH yeah, just how mama likes em. And they definitely lived up to the hype, they come with 2 and there was no way I was going all the way in. So, I pushed them to the side as my Benedict came 5 mins later. It was super! The fresh dill that comes on top was a perfect compliment to the poached egg, the hollandaise and the salty smokiness of the salmon. I order the SOB to drink, (GET YOUR HEAD RIGHT)!

Breakfast on the other hand is good, and that's all.  Swedish meatballs were tasty, but didn't seem quite right alongside other breakfast items, and Swedish potato sausage was quite mediocre.  Swedish pancakes with Lingonberries was most definitely a nice surprise to my tongue, but nothing that urges me to order it again.  The best bang for buck main breakfast courses are the wraps which pack a whole lot of action into one tortilla.  In general, breakfast entree prices are about 20% higher than they should be, but again, cinnamon buns make the trip worth it every time.   As far as atmosphere goes, the general vibe is pretty crazy between 10 and 3, so if you like the start the morning relaxing, then this may not be the stop for you.  The service is good and consistent.

While that was delicious, it typified my (at the time) current and unsustainable view of food - if its good, eat it! If nothing else, it was good.  The cinnamon  rolls are fantastic. First I cut the Southern Decadence out of the picture, and just ordered the cinnamon rolls for breakfast. Then, as I migrated to a far healthier diet, cut them out all together.  Now when I go here, I get the whole grain pancakes and eat half of them. Of note: the French toast, which my son eats, is delicious. Their dill roll is good.

Here comes a story: I've become addicted to the veggie hummus sandwich they serve and I got it takeout recently. I also bought a loaf of zucchini bread and, to my dismay, found the next morning that it had a little extra funk on the bottom. I waited a day and called up Ann (well probably not her, but I like to imagine) who was extremely apologetic and said come in, sans the bread because she believed me (rare, huh?) and wanted to set this right. Well they were out of the bread I wanted but she went out of her way to give me EIGHT super fresh cinnamon rolls, which are worth their weight in gold, trust me. Oh, and she threw in a brownie the size of my head that was still warm from the oven. She continued to say how sorry she was and how she valued my business.

2009-07-06,2.0,"So I was so excited to try Ann Sather's, home of the famous cinnamon roll, and to tell you the truth I was not impressed.   My family, fiance, and I went in for brunch on Sunday and were seated right away.  It does have tight quarters - I felt like I was on top of the people seating next to me but no biggie.  As we sat there, we were asked if we wanted to try the strawberry-banana-orange juice which was quite tasty.   But here comes my biggest complaint and the reason why I only gave it 2 stars.  Our server.  We waited and we waited and we waited - no one came to our table.  My mom finally said to the nice lady who got us our juice if we had a server and she did find her for us.  So our server came over to our table - no ""hi, I'm sorry for having you wait"" just ""what do you want.""  I was a server and I know how busy Sunday mornings can go but I always had a smile on my face, apologized if I was late, and treated the customer well.  After one of us ordered something she would say, ""is there anything else?""  Literally, I said I wanted the egg white omelet (Is there anything else?) with cheddar cheese (Is there anything else?) with cinnamon rolls (Is there anything else?) and hash browns (Is there anything else?).  And I am not exaggerating here at all.  It was just down right rude. The food was fine.  The cinnamon rolls were tasty but could have had more frosting (if I'm going to eat frosting - I want more than a tablespoon for 2 rolls).  My omelet was fine and the hash browns are actually real potatoes.  My parents had the swedish pancakes and waffles and they said they were good.  My fiance had the Denver omelet which was fine.  People keep saying on here that you get a lot of food which I agree with to a point.  You get 2 sides with the egg dishes which is a lot but if you actually want a large 3 egg white omelet - this is not the place.  So overall, I was less then pleased with our service and fine with the food.  I might try another restaurant just to give it a second try and hope for a better server.",0.9831,0.828,0.127,0.045,0.4768934240362812

The omelet was good, but I would have preferred avocado instead of oniony/garlicy guacamole at  that time of day, and I'm a huge guac fan- just not for breakfast. I ordered fruit for both of my sides, and it was more than just the standard canteloupe fruit cup, so I was happy.  A dining partner ordered country ham and eggs. The ham was good, but it was not typical very cured, salty, southern style country ham that I know well. Maybe Swedish country ham is different? After ordering the country ham, I think the waitress developed a southern drawl. Maybe the drawl comes with the order. I felt right at home. When you order the cinnamon roll as a side for your main dish (you get 2 rolls) and potatoes as the other side.  I am a coffee drinker, and I was disappointed in the coffee.

Time one : There wasn't a wait, which was nice, but I really hate when restaurants have their tables so close together you feel like you're having breakfast with strangers. The bussers seem to do the most of the work here, getting coffee, refilling coffee, checking on food orders, running around, while the waitstaff just seem to be there for personality. Our server didn't say hello, no pleasantries you might expect, just asked if we were ready. I got the steak and eggs benedict, because who doesn't love steak and hollandaise sauce? Then, the table next to us was sat, and they must have been regulars because our server talked to them for the entire time we were there, and didn't check on us at all. The cinnamon rolls are really really good, I'll give them that. However, my steak benedict?? soggy, cold, untoasted english muffins topped with the most sick looking, burned, fatty leftover steak bits one could imagine (medium rare my ass!). Poorly poached eggs, and covered with this very strange, thin, yet also congealed luke warm sad interpretation of hollandaise sauce that had been sitting on the line for some time. The whole deal was cold, so I asked the fabulous busser for some extra sauce, thinking it would warm it up. I got a little dish of ICE COLD sauce. It was absolutely disgusting. and not anywhere near hollandaise. Butter mixed with imitation egg yolk? Not the thick, divine sauce I had expected. I nibbled on the english muffin and finished the cinnamon rolls, and was done with it. It took about 3 years to get the check, because the server was busy asking someone more important about their vacation. Nice. Time two: I felt bad, thinking maybe the worst eggs benedict I'd ever had was a fluke. We went back. Oh god. Our server was pretty good this time. He was nice, and personable, and actually did more than just get an order and leave a check. I skipped the eggs benedict, but my girlfriend went for it, with crab cakes. Again, cinnamon rolls - delicious. I'm thinking this should just be a cafe, and scrap the food. I got some kind of pecan hazelnut french toast this time. The parts that were cooked were really good - however, most of it was mushy, and not much effort had been put forth getting it to sit properly on the grill. Dripping with batter? No thanks. My gf's crab cake benedict? Sick. Absolutely sick. The same weird, thin, cold sauce as the last time, only now the crab cakes heightened the disappointment. She didn't come close to finishing it. This is not eggs benedict. It's eggs Sather, and Sather is a cruel cruel mistress. When we left the 2nd (and last) time, I noticed the people next to me were just eating bowls of fruit.

2007-12-01,4.0,"Is there anything more sweetly decadent than those Ann Sather cinnamon rolls with all that gloppy glaze poured all over them? Man oh man, I first had them about a year and a half ago when I went to the original Belmont Avenue location on my last trip to Chicago, convincing myself that it was a good thing I lived on the other side of the country from them. On this visit, I decided to stay at the Best Western Hawthorne Terrace on Broadway, a quaint hotel despite the brand name, and lo and behold, right across the street is another Ann Sather. When I saw it, I rolled my eyes and said to myself, ""Be strong, Ed...you don't need those Cinnamon rolls."" I did well...for about half a day until I needed to find myself breakfast and was just too cold to go exploring. Who am I kidding? I'm weak...weak...WEAK, I tell ya. This location is smaller, much lighter and lacks the old-world atmosphere of the Belmont Avenue restaurant next to the Red Line. But my eyes didn't have time to adjust as they quickly veered to the menu place mat. I immediately went for the $9.50 Crab Cake Benedict (see photo), which came with a luxuriant Hollandaise sauce ladled liberally over two poached eggs lying atop two hefty Cajun-style crab cakes. Yummy enough, but of course, it came with my choice of two sides. One was a given...the so-called hash browns which are really home fries to this Californian. The other, of course, were the cinnamon rolls (see photo). Oh c'mon, you know I had to have them. They were even bigger and softer than I remembered, and the glaze was poured over with a bucket, I imagine. They put it on a little side dish to emphasize how big they are. Oh my God...I'm a dead man. I was so sated from my breakfast that I didn't eat for over twelve hours. I wonder if I was really full or it was psychosomatic. But I swear this was the LAST time, I swear...now I feel like Whitney Houston talking to Diane Sawyer. Crack is whack....and so are the Ann Sather cinnamon rolls.

The one on Broadway has a flair all its own- offering 'Disco Brunch' the first Sunday of every month, when a disco ball dangles from the ceiling, pictures of Farah Fawcett and other stars from the 70s adorn the walls, and chances are, the person serving your omelet will be dressed as one of the village people (although this isn't entirely out of the ordinary any other day of the week on Broadway). The main dishes are all really good. Make-your-own Omelets. Eggs Benedict dishes. Pancakes and French Toast dishes... All good. Most of the egg dishes also come with your choice of two sides, giving you not only TONS of food, but the option to pick some Cinnamon Rolls.   What Ann Sather is known for, the Cinnamon rolls are served still hot and sticky, come out as an appetizer (not after the meal as one may expect), and they come in pairs- more than a generous portion for one person to consume. They are worth the trip alone. More recently, I've been seeking out menu options that aren't going to give me a heart attack before I'm thirty... It's been a difficult process that's forced me to move away from their dependable stuff- and try some things of the lunch special' list... None of these have been very good. If you stick to the basics, get the Cinnamon rolls, and have a little wiggle room left in your artery's, give Ann Sather a try.

2007-07-16,3.0,"Not bad.  Used to come here all the time with friends when I had morning classes and needed some breakfast to inspire me. Good buns, good coffee.  I really enjoy their french toast dishes and benedicts. However, with the more simple dishes, like two eggs and a side of hash browns, the eggs always came out runny and gooey...  Edible, but sort of snotty looking. The service is really great though, even when they get busy the staff still manages to make sure everyone is treated well and in a timely manner.",0.9631,0.747,0.231,0.022,0.5162698412698413
2007-07-01,3.0,"wow, after hearing so much about Chicago instiution Ann Sather's, I gott say, I'm kinda underwhelmed.  we got to experience Disco Brunch this morning & it's way too much for 930 am on a Sunday. The food was definitely a four star, but they lost some imaginary points for service & decor.  I love that there's ten different kinds of Eggs Benedict. Somehow, these prices seem fair. The cinammon buns were quite delish. That sugar sauce they pour over them has got to be loaded with crack, because everyone else in the joint was face down, licking their plates clean. self-esteem people!",0.9312,0.82,0.153,0.027,0.4988888888888889

And I love that you get two choices of sides with all the breakfast entrees so not only will you have the sticky buns but also something a bit less dessert like. On a weekend mornings, it gets lively as hell in here and they really pack in the punters. Service is snappy and fairly efficient.  From what I've heard, the other location is more about atmosphere and the cafe is more about tasty food at high speeds. The other location had an amusement park style line spewing out the door and this one had a table for us within 5 minutes. Yay.",0.945,0.793,0.163,0.044,0.4540476190476191

2007-04-02,2.0,"I just didn't see what all the fuss is about. Everything was just blah, the service was bad, and for the price I felt like i could have gone somewhere much better.  We went on a Sunday morning and waited about 5 minutes for a table. Our server was a crazy granny type who practically sat on me to lean over the table and write our order down. She then came back twice to ask us if we were ready to order after each time we told her we already did.  The cinnamon rolls were good, but two huge rolls per person as part of a meal is so unnecessary (something about obscenely large portions really annoys me).  I ordered a feta and cheddar omelette with hashbrowns. The hashbrowns, as it turns out, are redskin potatoes mixed with onions (I hate onions) and the omelette was like a little quiche. This would have been fine had the cheddar and feta been mixed in. There was no cheddar present, and there was about a pound of feta on top of the quiche. It looked like an egg cake with feta frosting. I scooped about 2 cups of feta off the top and then ate the ""omelette"". It tasted fine, but I was annoyed that it wasn't what I ordered.  Afterwards, my fiance and I wished we had gone back to Orange. We ended up spending nearly $30 for a very mediocre breakfast. With all the other (better, cheaper) options around for breakfast, I don't think I would go back.",0.2756,0.826,0.096,0.077,0.47626396237507357
