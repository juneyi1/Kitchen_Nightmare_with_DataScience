2017-08-26,5.0,This is our third time here and this place does not disappoint. The only thing is sometimes the wait is a bit long by the time the food comes out but the wait is worth it. The food comes out fresh and fabulous! Their avocado salad is like no other. They also bring to the table a sweet Asian bread that is served fresh from the oven. My fave is their jarovyna dish. My sister did like their dumplings. I also recommend their garlic roasted shrimp as an appetizer. The table of 5 devoured that dish in minutes. Always too full to have dessert.

Most of it is fairly simple combinations of beef with rice and/or wheat, but it's all very well-executed, with a good balance of seasoning. The first time I went, everything was really excellent.

Seems like a great place to bring a date, once you get past the remixed American music that doesn't really gel with the food or decoration.  I went here with my brother as part of our 'international night' tradition. Which we just started ... but hey, what a great place to start! We split two appetizers: the perfectly made samsy beef pastry and the stuffed blini with farmer's cheese. I wasn't in love with the latter - wasn't expecting it to be mostly cold and the filling was maybe a little too rich - but it went great with everything else. I ordered the plov, an amazing pilaf dish with beef. It was an intimidating amount of rice to start with, but I seriously ate that whole thing, even after the appetizers. My brother was also impressed with the lagman, which he gives a 5/5.  Of course, I ate even more after being stuffed. We split the super rich Napoleon cake and the baklava-esque honey cake. I'd give the former 4.5/5 and the later 3.5/5.  It was a fantastic experience. Go here.",0.9938,0.719,0.231,0.05,0.6091954022988506

2017-02-23,5.0,"It is probably worth driving up here just to eat at this restaurant. We ordered the Solyanka, Manty, and Assorti Grill, and we loved everything! We will definitely come back here to try other things on the menu. The first dish was the Solyanka. It is a slightly sour clear soup with a lot of meat. It's like a better version of chili. You get a lot of stuff normally found in chili like sausages, chopped meat, and potato cubes. The sourness of the soup complimented the meatiness of the soup really well. Definitely a must-try. Second, we tried the Manty. This is like a giant potsticker with meat and onion inside. Unlike regular potsticker that usually adds fat into the filing to make the potsticker softer, they don't do that with the Manty. So it's just pure chopped meat and onion inside a shell. We tried it both steamed and fried, although we preferred the fried version since it was more moist on the inside. Finally, we had the Assorti Grill. This was delicious! First the rice was super tasty. The Lula kebab (grilled ground beef) was great too. It reminded me of the shish kebab from Mediterranean cuisine. The bone-in lamb chops were probably the best thing we had there. They were moist and well seasoned. The salmon was a bit overcooked. On the menu at the restaurant, it listed chicken as one of the components of the Assorti Grill. But when we got the dish, it came with salmon instead which is consistent with the menu on the website. The other reviewer complained about the service, but our waitress was really nice and friendly. She took the time to explain to us the difference between each dishes, and recommended us the dishes that we tried. It took about 5 minutes for the soup to arrive, then another 5 for the Manty, and maybe another ten for the Assorti grill. I highly recommend this place.",0.9893,0.858,0.137,0.005,0.45101787101787094

We ordered the pirojki (fried potato pie) as a starter and it was a most decadent beginning to our experience. As for our entrees, the fine lady decided to try the Vareniki (stuffed dumplings). Despite their simple appearance, these tiny pockets of feta cheese were bursting with flavor. As for myself, I had the Assorti Grill which was an assortment of lamb chops, lula kebab, and salmon. The lamb was great, the kebab was sub-par, but the salmon was the real winner here. To end our meal, the lady and I shared the cheesecake. Now we weren't sure what was in this cheesecake as the menu provided no description, but it was excellent. Highly recommend.

I went with the pelmeni dumpling soup where my friend chose matzo ball. The broth was PERFECT! A light chicken broth with good flavor, but not overpowering. The dumplings were light and tasty, the matzo balls were nice and fluffy. I found it slightly odd there was a tiny dollup of sour cream in my soup because it didn't break down or incorporate in to the bowl of soup.      For our lunch meals, we sampled a few things. Steamed manty, plov, and beshbarmak. The manty was good, a thin dough and a nice filling. The noodles in the beshbarmak were quite impressive. So thin and light. While the plov had slightly less meat than I would have hoped, the dish was also quite good.

However, the 6th dish did not come to the table until roughly 30 minutes after the first four arrived or 45 minutes after we ordered.  No apology offered, no discount offered or coupon/other recourse offered.  Even at Maza and his Soup Nazi persona you still actually were able to eat your dinner before bedtime.",-0.0752,0.881,0.063,0.055,0.5759259259259258

It came together very well as an overall meal, whereas the plain basmati rice and the onions served with the tandyr shashlik chicken didn't really add much value to the meal. Everything was priced affordably as well.  Unfortunately, the service was quite atrocious. First off, we were served some complimentary cold, stale bread.

With one exception, the food was very good.  Most important for us, the service was outstanding and the host was very [very] patient.  We tend to ask a lot of questions and I'm sure many of our questions were probably silly.  Regardless, our server never let on and answered all of our questions earnestly.   With one exception, the food was outstanding.  We tried nearly every appetizer and my favorite was the ""Chebureki"" -- a wonderful pasty filled with ground lamb. We tried three soups (Shorpo, Borsh, and Kesme).  All were good, but the Kesme stood out to me.  I saw it as a real example that parallels Kyrgyz culture.  It had noodles with potatoes/carrots in a subtly spicy beefy broth.  I thought it was outstanding.  For our main courses, we got a bunch of things and shared.  The Manty was good but we were warned not to get them fried.  The only disappointment was the Plov.  This dish of beef and rice had a nice flavor, but the beef was severely overcooked and dry.  The big surprise (I didn't realize we ordered it until it came to the table) was the Shashlik Lamb.  For whatever reason, I don't generally order shish-ka-bob, but I will definitely get this again. It was one of the most favorable lamb dishes I've ever had.  We also ordered the Jarovnya Beef, which was interesting and good, but IMHO was simply overshadowed by the lamb dish. Anyway, definitely a place to dine.  The ambience and people were very nice and the place is extremely affordable.  To put that in perspective, we were there for the experience and never once thought about price, which is how this culinary club rolls.  For the seven of us, I think our bill was about $220 before tip.",0.9939,0.799,0.172,0.029,0.6208646785313453

2016-01-05,5.0,"I had never had Kyrgyz food, but was drawn to Jibek Jolu because they serve kotlety (Russian hamburgers, without the bun) and borscht, which I love from my days in DC. The restaurant isn't very big, maybe fifteen tables, but it feels comfortable and not at all cramped. Additionally, it is decorated to look like a Central Asian yurt. Very cool.  We started dinner with a bowl of borscht and a stuffed blini. The borscht was hot, full of fresh cabbage, beet, and potato, and that awesome dollop of sour cream. Authentic and just how I remembered it, but better. Much better. If you've been hesitant to try borscht, this is the place to break you of any pre-conceived ideas. Did I mention how good this borscht is? Okay, good. The blini was amazing. That thin, doughy pancake (think of a Breton galette, or savory crepe) stuffed with seasoned ground beef, onions, and that cool sour cream. Easily the top of my list of blinis.  Dinner was shashlik chicken and steamed, then pan-fried, manty. Drinks with dinner were kompot (a beverage made by stewing various fruits in water, then straining out the fruit. A sort of cold fruit tea), and sweet Russian black tea. The Russians take great pride in their tea and this """" was fabulous. The kompot wasn't the best I've had, but still refreshing and tasty. The shashlik chicken was amazing. Essentially marinated kabobs, but so juicy, slightly spicy, and utterly mind-blowing. I don't know what they do to their rice, but what appeared to be plain white rice had a hidden seasoning that paired perfectly with the chicken. The manty (dumplings) was cooked to perfection, as well. I ordered mine with beef filling and pan-fried in addition to being steamed. The doughy texture had a satisfying outer crunch and the filling, potato, onion, and pumpkin in addition to the beef, was fragrant and melt-in-your-mouth delicious. Make sure to eat it with the pepper relish served with the dish. We got oreshki (filled cookies) for dessert, which were a nice way to finish the meal. Small and tasty!  A few additional notes- like I said, we initially came in for kotlety, but was told they didn't have them this night. Also, we originally wanted honey cake for dessert. Negative on that request, too. That would normally annoy me, until our server explained why- the previous day was New Year's Day, and the restaurant had been closed. The ladies that make those individual dishes typically prepare them the night before. As they were closed, no dice. That is how fresh and authentic their food is. Also, we boxed some of our food to take home. The same server, an awesome young Kyrgyz lady, came out with another box- she felt bad we only had a few pieces of chicken left to take home, so she had the cook prepare us another skewer of shashlik, so we could enjoy another full meal. Wow, I felt like I was with family! Also, the staff didn't mind me trying out my mediocre Russian on them. Probably because we were the only English-speakers in the restaurant.

2016-01-05,4.0,"Hearty, delicious food with lots of noodles, beef, potatoes, and yogurt sauce. Bring a big group so you can try lots of things - we found many things sounded similar on the menu but tasted very different on the plate. The best dish was the pan friend manty - rich beef dumplings that were crispy on the outside and perfectly flavored on the inside. My friend's favorite may have been the oromo - a beef and noodle lasagna-like layered pie.  Other favorites included the pelmeni - tiny steamed beef dumplings that were somewhat similar to Chinese soup dumplings. The lagman was also a great winter warm-up dish and very different from the alternatives. They also have a nice variety of soups (my friend tried the lentil and quite liked it).  You can order any entree in a ""small"" portion and this is a great way to split a larger number of dishes. The only minor problem is we found the vegetarian entrees slightly less satisfying. The veggie-friendly appetizers were actually heavier and more substantial. So if you're veggie, make sure to look over the appetizer menu twice.

2015-12-23,4.0,"While I've never had Kyrgyzstani cuisine before, I wasn't disappointed with the quality (hand pulled noodles!) and variety (Russian, Central Asian) of food. The portions were more than enough, and the large size of any dish was ridiculous. The price is very cheap for the quality and quantity of the food. The menu is meat centric, though there are some vegetarian options (vegans may find the carrot salad and some of the soups of interest, but I would ask to confirm if they are vegan) The ambience of the place is inviting and suitable for a family or a casual date. There were some more traditional textiles on the walls, such as a Tush kyiz. The only other customers were Russian speaking Central Asians, one family and two friends. The dishes that I recommend are: Main course: Ashlann Fuu - a cold, spicy noodle dish with jelly. Try it. Oromo - steamed pie filled with either pumpkin or ground beef. I had the ground beef, and couldn't stop eating it. Appetizers Tandyr Samsy - a savory pie, not spicy Stuffed Blini - typical stuffed Russian blin Desserts Medovik - Tort medovik, a Russian honey cake. It was moist, fragrant and just absolutely perfect. I would eat an entire cake. One day. I now make medovik at home, and hold the one I've tasted here as the prototype of all medoviks. I also would try the Kuurdak and Lagman, both which are very famous dishes in Kyrgyzstan. Things I wasn't impressed by: Kompot - It wasn't ~bad~ but it could have been the particular batch.  Carrot Salad - I wanted to like this, but the lack of spice and abundance of oil just made me cry a little. Service - I would have given this place 5 stars, however, the service is hit or miss. Midway through our meal, our waitress disappeared into the back with her cell phone, never to return, though her voice was clearly audible. Our plov also was mysteriously missing from our table, but alas, not from our check which was given to us by another, apologizing waitress after what seemed like an eternity, Granted, former USSR restaurants aren't known to have the friendly service that most Americans and Western Europeans are used to, but the apologies makes me think our experience wasn't intended.

2015-12-04,4.0,"Having spent a summer in Kyrgyzstan teaching English, I was VERY eager to try this place, and so glad that I did! I took my parents here so we could experience Kyrgyz food together. Always down to try new cuisine at least once, they thoroughly enjoyed their meal as well. First off, the inside is decorated like the inside of a yurt. I had the chance to stay in a yurt in the mountains, on the way to see Lake Issyk Kul with some fellow English teachers and it was an amazing experience. Once the sun set, the air gets chilly, and I remember I was freezing below four layers of blankets. Clenching my teeth so they wouldn't chatter, I still wouldn't trade that experience for anything. I was so cold that I spent a lot of the night staring at the top of the yurt, praying for sleep to come (I have ZERO cold tolerance...) but that was what made entering Jibek Jolu so nostalgic. I was back inside the yurt, snuggled next to dear friends, body heat crucial to my survival, but man oh man, it is beautiful in the mountains. On to the food.  For a party of three we ordered: --Lagman: stewed beef and veggies over hand-pulled noodles --Manty (small order of 4): dumplings w/beef and onions --Kuurdak: stewed beef with potatoes and onions --Lamb Shank: served with rice and carrot salad --2 drinks: Airan (yogurt) and Kompot (fruity) --Post-dinner tea We split all of this family style, and our table was also given complimentary Central Asian-style bread.  When I had manty in Kyrgyzstan, I remember the dumplings being much more oily and heavy, maybe because they were filled with lamb/mutton instead of beef.  But they were good here and definitely a different style of dumpling than say, a Chinese dumpling or a pierogi. The lamb shank was delicious, as was the Lagman, and the Kuurdak peppery. Next time I would order the Shashlik (meat kabobs) and the pan-fried manty, but that will be for next time. I had a rush of nostalgia here, even though I wouldn't be able to tell if the food was ""authentic""... But if you're one of the only Kyrgyz restaurants in Chicago, I think Jibek Jolu is a safe bet.

But it was not to be. What was served was cabbage soup (OK, maybe cabbage borscht). It was brown in color, with tons of sliced cabbage, carrots, red peppers, celery and potatoes, and a basket of good bread. The soup was nicely seasoned and served warm with a dollop of sour cream. All good but there was not a hint of beets in sight. I kept asking the waitress if this was the borscht and she kept assuring me that it was. I realize many versions are heavy on cabbage and light on beets, but the menu here promised something else. I think I was disappointed because I was expecting beet soup and it wasn't. I sampled a number of nice salads. This is a good place for vegetarians. The lunch crowd of 4 was riveted by Kyrgyz MTV on the big screen.

2015-07-27,5.0,"I'm rating as 5 because I believe that for the price, the quality is above what you would expect. We have visited this establishment twice now, and although I am still as incapable of pronouncing its name or that of the dishes as before going in, the food and service have been consistently outstanding. We had not experienced ""Central Asian"" cuisine before, and although it appears on the menu as a ""mix"" of various other cuisines (I suspect partly because of like-sounding names), I believe that the actual dishes are rather unique. The cuisine we experienced here has been very refreshing and original. Of note, they have plenty of vegetarian options. We are big fans of the cottage-cheese like filling (""tvorog"") for their dumplings or blinis (the latter are actually more like crêpes than blinis).  The cabbage-based main dish (oromo) is also very tasty and filling, and my wife ordered it during both visits. As far as main dishes go, on our first try I was cautious and ordered some of the skewered meats, which was very well cooked, plain and simple and served with some well-cooked rice -- not disappointing at all for a safe option. Being thus encouraged, on our return I ordered the traditional beef stew (""Kuurdak""). This was an exquisite surprise. The meat is sliced rather thin, and feels like it has been braised to perfection. It is very juicy and gets some flavour from onions cooked with it, although it does not appear they use a full mirepoix. They do not use alcohol, and I have no idea how they keep the meat so flavourful and juicy in this context (other than by the thin slicing rather than cubing, and likely very exact cooking times). That dish alone is worth a trip in my opinion. I am also a fan of their fruit-juice based drink ""kompot""; we have enjoyed their honey cake for dessert (not too sweet), but have been dismayed by the unavailability of a very nice sounding traditional dessert that appears on their printed menu only (likely has been removed, it's not on the only menu now that I look at it). I am pretty much looking forward to going back there and trying every item on the menu...

2014-10-22,5.0,"I've never sampled ""Central Asian"" cuisine before coming to Chicago this week on business and I always make it a priority to try something new when I'm away from home. There is a group of us in the Windy City on business from the Twin Cities and though we try to eat together as a group when we can, I decided to break away from them and sample something different while they spent their evening waiting in line for hot dogs at Portillo's. I asked someone in our hotel to recommend a really good place to get international food and they immediately told me about Jibek Jolu (5047 N. Lincoln Ave, Chicago). The girl behind the front desk is Uzbek and was explaining to me what they served at this restaurant. She said the food was good and the place is run by a Kyrgyz family (I think that's what she said). I hailed a cab and headed for Jibek Jolu. The first thing I have to say is that this place is what she explained to me - a small, quaint family run business. Nothing fancy or over the top. They weren't that busy when I arrived but by the time I left the restaurant was filled to capacity. My server was very polite even though his English skills were not the greatest. Hey, I'm okay with that. It's all part of the experience and in a family-run business it isn't that important. He didn't mess up my order and was friendly and surprisingly attentive based on what some other Yelp reviewers had to say. The menu is not huge and the prices aren't over the top. They have a nice appetizer menu and I decided to try the Russian-style Blinchiki (or blini, a small pancake served with sour cream). It was light and delicious. For my main course I selected the Kyrgyz Kuurdak (beef stew with potatoes and onions). It was delicious. The meat was tender and the onions and potatoes were almost velvety... very good. My server told me that in Kyrgyzstan they often serve this dish with horse meat. I thought he was kidding but read later that they do use horse meat in many dishes. Not here, though. Many people were ordering the Plov (a rice dish that is the staple dish of many Central Asian countries) and raving about that. I might get it next time I come back here. They have a small desert menu (only 3-4 items) and do not serve alcohol. Quite frankly, this place is a bargain compared with many foreign restaurants back home in Minneapolis. With my appetizer, entrée and hot tea I only paid $15 dollars including the tip. This place is a bargain! The food is different but it is amazing. I would recommend reservations if you plan to go after 6 pm as the place was packed and they were asking if people had reservations as I was leaving. I recommend this place for anyone looking for a hearty, home-cooked meal. This place has a lot of ""regulars"" as the servers seemed to know many diners' names and seeing how good and inexpensive their food is first hand I can understand why people come back here so often. If you're in Chicago and you are looking to sample something different, I recommend Jibek Jolu. Good food, good prices with no frills.

She made some suggestions for appetizers, entrees, and drinks, then brought us a carafe of water and a basket of bread right away.  I'm really writing this review as a response to some of the horribly negative and somewhat ignorant reviews I have read about this place as this was not my experience today. And most of these bad reviews were written by ""Americans"" who really have no business leaving their houses let alone trying a new restaurant on Father's Day (you know who you are). You know not every restaurant is going to be like Bennigans or Denny's or Ihop or Outback! The television in the corner didn't bother me in the least and I found the racy videos of scantilly clad women grinding up on pimped out men with guitars to backdrops of palm trees driving fancy cars to be more of a commentary on how the east views the west's infatuation with capitalistic mass consumerism. Also just because people aren't speaking english around you doesn't make the environment unfriendly. Some of you ""Americans"" need to get over yourselves! We ordered the Pirojki and Blinchiki as appetizers, a half order of Lagman and Plov to share as entrees, a cup of black tea and kompot, a homemade juice drink. And on top of really enjoying our dining experience, the attentive service, and the delicious regional cuisine, between the two of us our bill was only $22.

2014-06-05,1.0,"This was the worst dining experience of my life. Do NOT waste your time or money going here!*** Where should I start? Overall, the customer service was the worst part about this restaurant. The waiter was inattentive and unfriendly, and he had some difficultly understanding/communicating in English. What I love most about Chicago is the small ethnic communities and restaurants that allow you to taste authentic cuisine from all over the world; Jibek Jolu is clearly not friendly to outsiders, and only seems to care about its Kyrgzy, Kazakh, or Russian-speaking guests. I went here for Father's Day 2011 with my family because it had great reviews, and I had purchased a $25 gift certificate from  restaurant.com I don't even want to waste my time thinking about how horrible this place was, so I will just list my main grievances below: The waiter was slow refilling the water. Two members of our party wanted to order a side dish listed on the menu, and the waiter refused, saying that a side dish did not come with the meal. We tried to explain that we knew it didn't come with the meal, but we would pay extra for it, but he just said ""no"" without any explanation. My sister just wanted some rice, but he wouldn't let us order it! My cousin (who is a vegetarian) wanted some veggies with her dumplings (the only non-meat item, btw), but he said no as well. He didn't even ask the chef or manager if the restaurant could make accommodations! The food was not served in a timely fashion, and we were not served at the same time! They seem to have made each dish one at a time. Three of us were served within 30 minutes after ordering our food. I had to wait another 10-15 minutes after that, and my poor cousin had to wait nearly another 30 minutes to get her dish! We had all almost finished eating by the time she was finally served, and the waiter offered no apology, only the excuse ""we are busy""!!! Instead of coming to our table to explain the situation, I was forced to go up front to ask about my cousin's dish! Why didn't they prepare to be busy?! We made reservations ahead of time! It seems they didn't have more than one cook in the back . . . Our server spent more time cleaning up another table than paying attention to us--he only came to take our order and serve our food. My father didn't receive his ""appetizer"" until the very end of the meal, when we also received the basket of bread. NO ONE enjoyed the food. I am a huge foodie, and I am not a picky eater in the least, but this food was tasteless and boring. The meat was rubbery and had the look of being cheap and old. My mother's noodles were so bland that she had to put extra salt on them. The food was not worth the price we paid. My dad, for example, ended up paying around $13 for merely two meatballs and a few slices of tomato, cucumber, and a small portion of white rice! Outrageous! Near the end of our meal, my sister left the table to use the bathroom. She still had food on her plate and planned on getting a carry out to take the rest of it to go. The waiter came over to and began clearing our table. Before we could say anything, he picked up her plate and put other plates on top of her food! He didn't even ask if she was finished! My sister was a bit disappointed when she came back, but there was nothing to say. We didn't even feel comfortable complaining because the waiter had been so inattentive before. As I mentioned earlier, this place is not friendly towards the average American, or those who are not from the same ethnic background as the restaurant owners, but Jibek Jolu is also not a family-type place. The atmosphere of the restaurant is very nice, except for a small TV in the background that makes the place much less classy. What made the atmosphere worse was that the station played some trashy music videos with dancing girls in bikinis. This was both very awkward and inappropriate for Father's day. When it finally came time to pay the bill, I had added up in my head an idea of what the meal should cost, so I was a bit surprised when I saw the inflated total price. I noticed that the waiter used a calculator (not the cash register) to add up the totals, so I re-added the total myself. I showed him on the calculator that he had overcharged us, and then the woman said something to him in another language. I won't assume that the miscalculation was intentional, but isn't it funny how people never make monetary mistakes in your favor? If you're going to be charging customers with the total you get from a calculator, I would hope you would be more careful!! There are other things I could say about this place, but I'll just leave it at that. Do not eat here. ***I wrote this review three years ago but never posted it until now.

2014-05-19,5.0,"So very delicious. My Russian boyfriend and I made our way to Jibek Jolu Saturday afternoon, getting there around 2.  The place was pretty quiet, but by the time we received our entrees, it was hopping.  He says that the traditional Russian lunchtime is more in the area of 2 p.m., so that makes sense. Our server spoke impeccable English, but boyfriend spoke to her in their shared native language.  She did tell him in Russian that she was fine with either language.  For me, it's just fun to listen - so that was fine with me. He had the small order of plov, and I had the shashlik beef.  I know - fried rice and a kabob.  But for real - that kabob plate was the tastiest dish I've had at a Chicago restaurant in SO LONG.  I think my palate has been somewhat stunted by the ""standard options"" in the city. Meat wasn't fatty at all and was charred perfectly.  The lavosh bread served with the kabob could have been a tasty meal in itself.  I appreciated the tomato and cucumber garnish - and the julienned tomato/cucumber salad that arrived with the plov. I really can't wait to go back and try another couple of dishes.  It's comfort food for my honey - and that's what it's all about.

One thing to note though: the food did not come out even remotely together.  We didn't care because we were sharing everything anyway, and we didn't have anywhere to be and were enjoying a leisurely dinner.  But the entree I ordered (lagman) came out after about 20 minutes, and the pelmeni about 10 minutes later, and then the entree the boyf ordered (shashlik) like 20 minutes after that.  Again, we didn't care because we were sharing, but half an hour difference between entrees would really have been an issue if we had been eating our entrees individually.

I felt really bad, worst server, she couldnt smile at all, then when she brought us just 2 entrees for 3 persons, she didn't apologies,  nothing, she insisted that we ordered only 2!!! How??? It's 3 of us, why would we order only 2? My husband had to wait for his entree. You have to ask her: ""excuse me can we get some sause to this meat?"" "" sorry we are missing a fork"". We were bothering her, so I didn't ask her for a bread, had soup without it. If you dont like people, do not care about customers, why do you work as server?  Food: only thing we liked was blinchiki and hot tea..... Of course they were out of lagman :( Beshbarmak was Bad, thats all I can say, my husband is from Kyrzyzstan, so I know what I'm talking about. Solyanka was so so... None of us couldn't drink ""kompot"", we had to reorder hot tea. We decided to give it another  try and ordered beef  ""shashlyk""... bad idea. Never order shashlyk from this restaraunt, it was awful, and we couldn't finish it either.  You know when you have a bad server, that's when she sees that you didn't finish your entries and ""drinks"" and she doesn't care about it, because it don't matter to her, if you going to come back. And we are not going back there and I will make sure to tell everyone I know in the area, that this plase used to be good.

We ordered Manty, Borsh, Plov, Tefteli & half an order of Lagman - all of this was based on reading numerous other reviews and seeing the names pop up under other reviews for other restaurants - they seemed to be the most common and popular dishes - otherwise we'd be lost.  All 5 were hits!  Plus between 2 people there was enough for 2nd's and leftovers for day 2!  The Manty are like dumplings and you get 6 to 7 of them with a little hot sauce.  Borsh is the beet soup and delicious, beyond that one of the dishes has 3 Swedish-like meatballs, one is a rice dish and the last is a noodle dish with beef.   If you're adventurous and looking to experience a little Russia while the Olympics are on, I'd suggest either take-out (like we did) or eating at their restaurant which seemed fairly busy with a mix of clientele - families, couples, friends, individuals - probably sits 40 comfortably.  Our tab was $50 and again it was plenty. Staff was friendly, restaurant seemed clean and there was plenty of street parking.

Probably I am an idiot but I'm just trying to think as an everyman.  Overall I really want to like this place. It's very casual and non-pretentious. It's just that I don't really like anything here that much!  Sorry....For a dumpling kinda thing, I don't find theirs especially flavorful or tasty, or really having much interest at all. I was craving some kind of dipping sauce for them in their various incarnations to help this out and the server just gave me a blank stare. I've read talk of some dill/yogurt sauce in other reviews, that sounds good... but that wasn't an option. Finally managed to get some sour cream. How thrilling. How about bringing a medley of tasty sauces out? There was some ""garlic sauce"" listed somewhere. She never heard of it or they were out. There were some listed on the back with the special chicken (which they were out of as well, among several other things). Sorry, everything was just dry and bland. I guess I just don't get it. In a world of empanadas, somosas, pierogi, mandoo, etc. etc., these were just the worst incarnation....sorry!  You really need some help ordering here and some direction. Some of the servers can give it, I could overhear. Ours could not. The bread was decent but brought out with nothing, not even butter. Does this cuisine not offer any bread toppings, condiments, etc? I think that is the key word here lacking...condiments. A presentation of this really should be perhaps done in a more ""small plates"" way, ie the Korean Ban Chan (sp) type. Just a way to taste everything and appreciate the foods. I really don't want a large plate of Korean carrot salad. I have had it....it's fine... but a forkful or two and that's about my interest level in it. They should offer a small bowl of soup, etc. Just to get some of these flavors flowing! There's a stagnation here based on the staff and its marketing (or lack thereof) to do this. Hard to define but it just needs a bit of ooomph somewhere. It's not that the menu isn't slick, it actually is!  Anyway, check it out. It's certainly not expensive, so worth a try to try a new cuisine.

Kyrgyz food is not pretentious, and seasoning wise it errs on the bland side (similar to Russian food).  However, it is wonderfully satisfying in a soul-food kind of way.  Expect no esoteric ingredients or spices.  Expect to be full and have a relaxing time with your friends. One note: I see a lot of reviews commenting on slow service.  I feel I should point out that in Kyrgyzstani cafes, staff generally assume you don't want to be bothered unless you call for your server.  Kyrgyz can sit for hours in a restaurant with good friends and think nothing of it.  If you are being served too slowly for your taste, just raise your hand and politely call ""molodOy chelovEk!""

It was my first time trying Central Asian cuisine and I am now a fan. We had the Kotlety, Pelmeni and Korean salad.  The Korean salad is a bit spicy, but tangy and full of flavor. It's refreshing for a hotter day. The Kotlety was a dish of 2 meatballs with sides of mashed potatoes, peas and pickled veggies. The Pelmeni was a dish of dumplings with beef inside. It's served with a sour cream/dill sauce.  We ordered half portions for the Kotlety and Pelmeni dishes, and we tried our best to make it clear to the waitress, as there was a language barrier. We even pointed at the ""half portion"" section of the menu for each of the dishes. When we chose a side with the Kotlety, she told us we could only have rice. The menu, however, stated we could choose any side dish. After a bit of confusion, she went and asked and came back and said that yes, we could choose any side we wanted.  While we were waiting for our food, I saw one of the waiters standing there picking his nose and then went to get the plates of food to bring out to the customers. I'm appalled that he did not wash his hands before doing so. Thankfully, he didn't bring out our food.  The staff was nice and attentive though.

2013-03-02,4.0,"I had a fun dinner at Jibek Jolu with a group of five friends as part of a BYOB dinner club. The meal was such a great value; we ate like kings and the final tab was just $21 per/person (including tax and generous tip)!  About the only knock is the menu is on the small side and many dishes sound similar to one another (lots of pies/dumplings filled with meat/cheese/potatoes/veggies with slightly different combinations of ingredients or type of dough - some fried, some steamed and some baked). As a positive, all the appetizers are priced as individual pieces, so you can try just about everything if you want - or if there is something you know you love order double or triple orders (appetizers ranged from about $1 to $3). Our group did double orders of six different appetizers (pretty much the entire selection) as well as ordered the carrot salad (really delicious - spicy shredded carrots with garlic and olive oil) and this was a nice amount of food - everybody was able to have a decent size tasting portion of each appetizer. If dining as a couple single portions of three to four different appetizers would probably be optimal. The food was well seasoned and just about everything was good. Definitely hearty food, so perfect on a chilly Chicago winter evening. Most entrees may be ordered in half sizes in case you want to dine ""small plate"" style and sample multiple dishes. Since we had five people we opted to order four full size entrees of a variety of dishes and eat family style (i.e. share everything). This again worked out to be the perfect size of food. While some of the meats seemed a bit overcooked, overall there were nice flavors; nothing fancy, but good, simple ethnic cuisine. With most entrees being priced under $10 this is really an awesome value (portion sizes are fairly hearty). The Lagman Ganfan was my favorite entree, featuring sliced daikon with red green, and banana peppers tomatoes, garlic, and beef stewed alongside your choice of noodles or steamed rice. There is also complimentary warm bread served soon after you seat (the bread was a bit on the sweet side and resembled a brioche). The menu also contains some soups such as a borsch, but since we were eating family style we opted not to order any soup. By dessert time we were quite full, so we just shared a single piece of the honey cake which everybody enjoyed.  Jibek Jolu is quite casual and has warm, pleasant decor without being too busy setting a nice tone for the Russian/Central Asian cuisine. The venue is on the small side, but has good acoustics and was not at all loud. Our server was friendly but a bit overworked in that she was the only server for the entire restaurant. As such it took a lot of time to place our order, but once placed the food was served at a decent pace and she checked in with us as often as she was able. If the restaurant had been filled to capacity having only one server on duty would have been a big issue, but since they were only about half full it was workable.

She made sure we had everything that we needed and took good care of us. Her & my lady spoke russian to each other which was an added bonus for my girl. I was told to try the russian potato salad which was okay, but nothing to sing home about. My main dish was the Plov, which is beef served with steamed rice, carrots, onions & garlic. Very good as the beef had a flavor that I never tasted before. I would definitely try that dish again as I am now thinking about it as I write this.

It was like a fried meat pie. It tasted kind of like a giant fried wonton with lamb filling. Pretty good, but not that exciting. Next we had the Korean carrot salad. I really liked this. Something about the spices and olive oil and the texture of the carrots...it was great. They used some kind of pepper that was like a cross between black and white pepper. It was delicious. I could have eaten a giant bowl of this carrot salad. For our entrees we shared the besbarmak, which is a lamb and noodle dish. It's like a large platter of asian noodles and then ti's topped with small chunks of lamb, green onions and that delicious pepper I mentioned above.  I felt that the noodles were slightly more cooked than I would have preferred, but it was tasty. The manty (lamb, onion, and pumpkin dumplings) were really tasty and were served with a dill and yogurt sauce. We got the honey cake for dessert. I guess I came in hoping it would be like this honey cake we used to get from this Russian Bakery when I was a kid, but it wasn't quite like that so I was disappointed. The cake was fine though, although I felt like the chocolate sauce kind of drowned out the honey taste.

2012-01-25,3.0,"First of all, Jibek Jolu (Kyrgyz cuisine) is a Central Asian restaurant, not Middle Eastern per Wei H's review below. Kyrgyz cuisine is pretty unique, offering a mix between chinese, korean, russian, and persian influences in their dishes. I got to sample a lot of appetizers and entree dishes and the food was fairly good. So why the 3 star rating? Some of the dishes were too oily/greasy and the service was pretty bad/non-existent. Let's start with the food. Korean Carrot: Shredded carrots with korean spices. Very nice. Chebureki: Fried pie stuffed with lamb. Pretty good. Jibek Jolu Special Salad: It's a beef stir fry with onions, garlic and cucumber. Tasty but nothing special. Stuffed Blini: small light pancake stuffed with ground beef. We didn't think it was *THAT* small. It's pretty small, like one bite small. FYI. Vareniki: Russian like dumplings stuffed with mashed potatoes and served with sour cream. I LOVE this... the dumplings were cooked really well, not too firm or soggy, tastes really good I couldn't stop eating it. Beshbermak: Boiled noodles/ pasta? with boiled diced lamb and vegs on the side. They say this is the most popular dish, but I'm meh about it. Not much flavor. The noodles were plain, the lamb was plain too. Not much seasoning. Kind of oily at the bottom. Oromo: Steamed pie (more like lasagna but made with thin dumpling skin) layers of minced potatoes, onions, cabbage and carrots. Served with sauce. I like it a lot. Marinated grilled chicken with fries was their special. Also just okay.  Honey Cake: probably one of the best things here. Be wary, it's a little on the sweet side, but not as sweet as baklava. the cake itself is dense, but very soft and moist. drizzled with honey AND chocolate.  At the end of dinner, we thought that the food was mostly pretty bland and underseasoned. (Remember, I'm Malaysian and I eat EVERYTHING with spice and sriracha, so I'm not used to this monotone flavor of food).  The things that stood out to me were the non-meat dishes actually, the carrot salad, the vareniki mashed potato dumplings and the oromo steamed pie/vegetarian lasagna.  Now onto the service. They were pretty slow.. there were 2 other people when we came in, they left and 3 other people walked in after us. We were a group of 6. On a Tuesday night. Pretty normal I guess. But the server would just wait in the kitchen forever. At times we had to wave our hands (asian in asia style) to grab his attention. They were out of a number of things on the menu, but offered substitutes. However, I do think this place is pretty damn authentic given the 3 people who came in after us, were dressed like they were from the old country with military boots and everything. One time we laughed kinda loudly, I think military guy asked the server to turn the music UP to drown our jolliness. True story. We also noticed a disco ball, colored lights and strober on the ceiling. In addition to the traditional Kyrgyz decor on the walls. Maybe they have dance parties on the weekends? **BONUS: They serve zabiha/halal meat for observing muslims.",0.9983,0.784,0.183,0.033,0.5146190476190474

I normally don't eat beef but decided to try and I am so glad I did. I am not familiar with central asian spices but the taste was so unique, strong but not overpowering. Oromo - i loved this dish. It managed to make cabbage delish. There's something creamy about this lasagna-like dish. Along with the sour cream it is the ultimate carb bomb.  Chicken botley and lamb noodles- according to my gals they were delicious.  We also ordered the obligatory honey cake. I found it very sweet but since it was honey the sweetness was lighter.

2011-11-11,4.0,"Until a few weeks back I had fallen into a routine of peering over maps, trying to identify cuisines from the countries around the Silk Road. It was getting to be a nice scatter plot till I realized that I couldn't find anything from the land of Borat. I googled Kazakhstan restaurants and could only find something in London, disheartened I typed Kyrgyzstan instead and saw the name of Jibek Jolu.  Other than the fact that the server took slightly less long to bring the menu (and later the food) to my table than the flight from New York (ok, slight exaggeration), the meal itself was worth making the trip. To be fair, the extra time to select from the menu was helpful as I was struggling in selection of dishes with the number of options that tempted me. So, I made the executive decision to avoid the popular dishes at Jibek Jolu that I've tried in Uzbek restaurants (such as the hand pulled noodles: Lagman, meat dumplings: Manti, Rice: Plov) and instead focus on those that I had never eaten before. The meal started with the Jibek Jolu Special salad: fried beef with onions, garlic, and cucumbers served with soy sauce. I've jogged my memory, but struggled to find any salad I've eaten that I could call hot (which says in equal parts about my ambivalence towards salads!), but the Special salad lived up to its name and was absolutely delicious. I loved the fact that the cucumber was soft, but not soggy and that the flavors were distinct and intense. The salad was followed by Kesme soup, which I understand is the national Kyrgyz noodle soup and is made from beef, potatoes, tomatoes, garlic, green and red peppers, celery and beets. It was also excellent and reminded me as a better version of the Lagman soups that I've had in NYC. After a lot of debate, I had selected the Oromo as my entrée. The struggle was not only based on competing items on the menu that were tempting, but also for the fact that the description didn't jump out at me: Traditional steamed pie made with minced potatoes, onions, cabbage, and carrots in a long thin wrap. I went for it nevertheless and was glad that I did, for one may have eaten the ingredients thousands of times, the way they the textures and flavors were brought together was exceptional - one of those simple dishes that stick in your mind long after for the way it came together. While I finished the yogurt based dip pretty soon, it didn't hurt that they have an excellent spicy salsa-ish dip as well that has a fresh bright flavor to perk things up, when the ingredients strike you as mundane. Truly, one unique flavor after another! The only thing missing was the Kyrgyz equivalent of Jagshemash from the server. His saving grace was that he appeared contrite for the delayed service.",0.9951,0.824,0.137,0.039,0.562878787878788

The other soups are as good.  Their special meat dishes are superb. I always order a few extra dishes to take home for the next few days.  Unpretencious decor and quiet music add to the ambience quite nicely ... Out of a bitten path, chances are you'll find an empty table and be sitted and served in no time. And if you are lucky, you may see how they make pasta right there on premises.   That what my experience was every time I visited. Enjoy!",0.9893,0.762,0.209,0.029,0.4479523809523809
2011-10-05,4.0,"I couldn't tell you where Kyrgyzstan is. I don't know much of anything about it. But, when I heard whispers and rumors of BYO and lamb pie, I was off in my car to the 'where the f is this part of Lincoln?' part of Lincoln Square/Budlong Woods. What a fun experience. Here's something you might not know about me: I brought democracy to the former Soviet Union. It's true. I spent a summer there in 1991 and left a week before the coup. Plans in motion, y'all. I haven't been back to that part of the world since but word has it, I'm a legend. But here's the thing: thanks to the 'stan' and confluence of consonants, I was expecting all Eastern Euro fare. Ah ah ah.... not so fast, Mr. Bond. Thar be Asian influence in this food as well! Two types of cuisine for the (low) price of one! I can dig it. I would suggest coming here with an open mind and a little time to spare. When my Girl Friday and I got here, the service was polite and a bit languid, which was okay because it was just us. By the time we left, the service was polite and a bit languid... and the place was slammed! I think your time of arrival has an effect on how/when you get your food. Get here early. Since Kyrgyzstan has a mix of history, people and culture, get food to reflect it and enjoy it all. We started with the lamb pie and the potato/scallion pie. C'mon. It's pie. Pie of any sort should be eaten. Always. Expecting substance but not overwhelming flavor, I was pleasantly surprised with how fast we devoured the pies. Very savory and filling, start your meal with this. Keep it going with the carrot salad. I know! I was skeptical too. Why would I was waste stomach real estate with rabbit food? Evidently, because rabbit's know what's up. I don't know what kind of magic the chefs add to carrots, garlic and olive oil, but it's working. I was getting full, but what kind of American fatty would I be if I let that stop me? The beef-heavy menu put me somewhat at a disadvantage, but I settled upon the chicken kotley with pan-fried potatoes. Get ready. These balls are huge! Add the healthy portion of fried potatoes and I started to wonder if I got the JJ super-sized special. There was no way I could eat this all and have room for dessert... so I ate it all and ordered dessert. Oh, the things I do for research. The spiced chicken meat balls came with onions and a light oil which I mixed every bite with potato. Sounds simple. Tasted wonderful. If you're a non-beef eater, you'll be quite happy. If you're into beef, I can't imagine any entree that wouldn't put a smile on your face. Girl Friday tore hers up. We leaned back from our plates, brows sweaty, lips oily and hearts racing, flagged down the waiter and ordered honey cake. Two slices. We're not messing around. I think Girl Friday enjoyed hers more than I did mine. Don't be fooled by the name. This cake is thick, dense and incredibly rich. After such a big meal, it might have been a mistake to order to slices (which come out as slabs). The chocolate drizzle was an unexpected bonus. I probably wouldn't set out to eat an entire piece by myself again, though. The price for all this gluttony? Shockingly low. Gotta love real deal, old school, non-glitz ethnic byos. If someone were to ask my 'food philosophy' (which they have), I would have to say that I align myself with the described above. For quality, price, quantity, and experience, head to head, I think it's tough to beat RDOSNGEBs. I may have just started a 'thing.'",0.9948,0.846,0.112,0.041,0.4610304008609094

It seemed to me like they did pretty well with what they could; I had the lagman, and the noodles were tasty and well cooked to a perfect al dente.  I might've been more impressed if I had actually gotten to see them pulling the noodles.  As for the stew served on top of the noodles, it was fairly pedestrian, with sauteed meat, peppers and onions, and lacking in seasoning and depth of flavor.  I also had the Piroyki, which was a fried doughball with mashed potatoes inside.  It looked like a great dish on paper, but again, lacked any seasoning or sauce and so came off fairly bland.

He ordered it anyway.  And ended up recalling its deliciousness for days to come (no, that is not a euphemism for vomiting - he really did like it).  And so did I.  With a shocking fizzy tang upon hitting the tongue, crisp, fresh veggies, and spicy, salami-like sausage, it was indeed just about the most refreshing summer soup ever.  Score one, Jibek Jolu. The lagman noodles (beef, tricolor peppers, daikon, clearly homemade noodles) were oily to the extreme, but that's just part of what made them so tasty!  I found this to be a very Russian-tasting dish - something my grandma might make if she weren't afraid of spicy.  This was my favorite dish.  Score two, Jibek Jolu. The lamb pie appetizer was nothing special, and neither was the 'national drink' (my dad thought it tasted like cherry Kool-aid - I figured more like apple juice mixed with pink lemonade) but it doesn't really matter.  You don't need appetizers anyway - they swoop over with a ginormous platter of fried and baked bread as soon as you sit down.

I could have ordered 10 Somsy to take home with me, so delicious from the soft and chewy dough to the meat filled center. I was hooked! We had the Chicken Kotley and Manty which were both very good. The Kotley (chicken meatballs) were very moist and had a nice flavor. I thought it could have used some type of sauce but I believe it isn't traditionally served with one and we wanted to whole experience. The Manty was out of this world!! The meat filled dumplings has such a sweet and wonderful flavor, were cooked perfectly to where the dumpling itself wasnt too doughy but at the same time melted in your mouth. They were awesome. This place is kind of far North but there is plenty of parking in the street and in the lot across the street.

2011-01-18,4.0,"Aside from knowing it was a part of the former Soviet Union, I was foreign to all things Kyrgyz.  From a food standpoint I had no idea what to expect, but thanks to the informative back story on Jibek Jolu's menu I learned that Kyrgyzstan is actually a part of central Asia.  Those influences certainly come through in many of their dishes, so while my experience here was new, it was strangely familiar...   Dinners for me usually start with Chebureki - a large empanada-like turnover with a crisp crust and a thin layer of ground lamb filling.  It wouldn't hurt to have a little more filling, but it is an appetizer after all and I'm fairly certain it's prepared in traditional proportions.  Besides it's quite tasty and, let's face it, I'm a sucker for just about anything deep fried.  For entrees I've only ever had the Lagman - a dish of noodles (made and pulled in house) with a flavorful stew of onions, daikon, bell peppers, fresh herbs, and small dices of beef.  It's rustic and hearty, with a definite homemade touch.  The noodles are also on the softer side so don't expect al dente.   So if you're looking to shed the stigma of being the only Kyrgyzstani cuisine virgin in your circle of friends then look no further than Jibek Jolu.  Ok, maybe more than a few of us haven't enjoyed a Kyrgyzstani meal but it's certainly worth a try if you're an adventurous eater who's looking to expand their horizons.",0.9729,0.796,0.147,0.057,0.4646137716450216

Since this stretch of Lincoln doesn't have much in the way of stores or places to visit, we decided to go in and grab a table.  When we entered, the only two empty tables were marked as reserved.  The waiter indicated that those diners were expected a 7 PM.  It didn't look as if the other occupied tables would be finished with their meals any time soon.  I guess he wasn't sure of what to do and shyly shrugged his shoulders.  We simply told him that we would wait a few minutes.  Shortly after we entered, another party of three or four guys walked in also without a reservation.  Again the waiter mumbled the same thing he told us to these newcomers.  Dejected about the uncertain wait time, this party exited about as soon as they came in. Herein comes the good part.  One of the diners (possibly someone affiliated with the owner/management?) at the large party started to clear the dishes for his group.  He cleared enough to give us one of their party's tables.  Now that was a kind gesture.  I see what some of the other Yelpers mean about the customer service at this place.  I think it's more of a cultural thing rather than a polite thing (as in what is considered good manners or a cultural norm in one place is interpreted differently in another).

2010-12-03,4.0,"Stopped by Jibek Jolu tonight. It was fun to try Kyrgyz food, particularly since it really is a cuisine that features elements of so many others. In particular I enjoyed reading over the menu since many of the words were so similar to Turkish, Kyrgyz being a Turkic language afterall. We started off with a Chebureki which is a fried meat pie stuffed with lamb. I noted that the dish was very similar to Turkish Cig Boregi, while my Taiwanese wife was reminded of fried wanton wrappers. I think she won this battle since the meat stuffing was made with scallions, definitely a nod to the eastern influences. The outside was puffy and crispy and the inside juicy, a nice start to the meal. Afterward we split an order of pelmeni, which I suppose highlights the Russian influence. Once again the stuffing reminded my wife of Chinese dumplings, though these were served with sour cream a very non-Chinese condiment. The dumpling wrappers were thick and chewy, definitely made fresh. For entrees we ordered the plov (which I presume is related to Turkish pilav) and lagman. The plov was something a lowlight. The rice was fluffy but lacked the rich, meaty flavor I typically associate with the dish and the chunks of beef were woefully overcooked. The lagman on the otherhand was excellent. The nice and long noodles were clearly freshly made with a spongy texture. This dish was once again a wonderful confluence of cuisines. The noodles and daikon showed the eastern influence while the tomato, bell pepper and green bean stew tasted Mediterranean. It was a simple dish, but the taste was authentically homemade and delicious. Dessert was the honey cake which was pretty ordinary. Overall we really enjoyed the meal. The room is very homey which matches the simple but well executed food very well. We were happy to hear they deliver as well, most of the food definitely seemed like it would deliver well. Lastly, I have to mention that the prices were very reasonable particularly when considering that the noodles and dumplings are all hand made (you can watch them working in the back).

Okay, I dont really have any other restaurant to compare this place to, but the food was really good and the dining atmosphere was really nice. There was 12 of us for dinner so we ordered a lot of food.  We ordered almost everything on the menu!!!! One of the few things we did not order was a soup dish.  Here was our dinner menu for the night: Appetizers: Samsy (crispy and flaky pastry filled with beef and onions-similar to a samosa-delicious and filling!) Chebureki-fried pie filled with meat (this was good but I liked the samsy better) We wanted to order the Borsok, but the restaurant required us to order it in advance (probably about 4 hours before we arrived) Salads: Korean carrot (thinly sliced carrots with flavorful spices) and Funcheza (this salad had korean noodles in it)  both salads reminded me of thai papaya salad without the fish sauce. YUMMIE!! Entrees: Lagman-spicy noodle dish Oromo- Ganfan-similar to the Lagman except with rice Kotlety-meatballs with onions-the meat was tender and seasoned perfectly Manty-steamed dumplings (similar to chinese xiao long bao except without the soup inside the dumpling!) Pelmeni-triangular dumplings (similar to pierogi) Vareniki-dumplings stuff with mashed potatoes (similar to a potato pierogi) Dessert: Honey cake- sweet cake with the texture of pound cake. drizzled in chocolate! Everything in our food was so perfectly spiced!! The food appeared to have a lot of influence from Turkey, Russia, Europe, and China. I learned that this was because Kyrgyzstan was on the spice trail (Silk Road). Their menu says they serve meat that is organic (Kosher and Halal). Nothing was too spicy, but some food did have a nice kick to it. All the dishes had great flavor.  Service was very attentive.  They provided us with extra plates and forks and glasses. They were so good to us! Prices are VERY affordable. The dishes are priced under $10. We got all this food at $17 per person which included tip!!! What a steal!!! Portions were fairly big. The restaurant was actually pretty busy without our group of 12, which is a great sign! I hope this place stays in business for a long time because I think this may be the only Kyrgyzstan restaurant in Chicago! So happy its here! Street parking is really easy in this area.

The noodles, as mentioned, are the highlight, but everything else is darn tasty too. It's hearty fare so go with an empty stomach.

Each bite of each entrée was a surprise.  Now for the details: There were three of us dining, and not a single one of us had tried Kyrgyz food before, so we ordered quite a bit.  I ordered the lagman, the first soup on the menu (the name of which I can't remember), and an order of manty to share with everyone.  Person B ordered the borsh soup, the grilled chicken kabobs, and the Korean carrot salad.  Person C ordered the lentil soup, and a dish with rice and spicy chicken.  Our bill came to just over $55 for more food than we could possibly have eaten. The traditional bread came out with the soups, and it was thick and dry- PERFECT for soups and stews, which seems like a good portion of the menu.  The borsh was the winner in the soup category, and it served as a guarantee that I'll be back to Jibek Jolu when the weather cools off a bit. I loved the lagman down to the very last bite.  It was fresh tasting and hearty.  The noodles were so delicious, they were borderline ridiculous.  It was one of those moments where i smiled as I ate.  The manty were a great surprise.  I expected them to either be rehashed pierogi or pot stickers, but they were neither.  The pumpkin inside really made the dish pop.  Both chicken dishes that my companions ordered were delicious, but the lagman was clearly the one to try.   Last was the Korean carrot salad.  I feel like I'm repeating myself when i say this, but it was such a great surprise!  I took one look at it and expected sweet 'n sour carrot salad, but i was completely wrong.  It had a bit of peppery spice that made the whole dish taste and feel substantial.  With a side of rice, this could have almost been a meal on its own. I was shocked that we were pretty much the only table there.  With everything being made from scratch, this food was easily worth $15/plate, and I'll be forcing lots of friends to go and try it very soon.

When I say handmade to order, I meant it, literally! I saw them stretching their noodles by hand in the kitchen and 5 minutes later, it was right in front of me. The stew was perfectly cooked and the noodles were al dente - it's probably the best noodles I've ever had in Chicago. Other notable items include solyanka, which is a full flavored soup with chunks of vegetables, meat and olives, samsy which are freshly made flaky meat pies, pelmeni, which are dumplings served with sour cream, and airan, a plain yogurt drink that's popular in Asia.

I actually had to grab a to-go menu so I would know how to spell Kyrgyzstan, though I still have no idea how to pronounce it. Apparently it's on the crossroads of the Silk Road, and that I know from Yo Yo Ma. Thanks Yo Yo.  Jibek Jolu used to be a pizza place and they really fixed it up pretty cute. Inside is small and was warm and sunny when we were there. They have two large tv's playing what I am assuming is Kyrgyzstani MTV. Kind of funny. Since I wasn't facing them, I kinda enjoyed the music.  All of the Yelp reviews rave about the Lagman, which did not disappoint. When you order it, you can see a woman in the kitchen start the process of hand rolling your noodles. And I'm not talking Italian style with the crank hooked to the table. I'm talking ROLLING dough in her hands. Kick ass. For an appetizer we had the Samsy, like a Kyrgy samosa or empenada, stuffed with beef and onions. My hubby had the Lagman and I had the Vareniki, which are little dumplings stuffed with mashed potatoes. Mine were yummy, but a little on the bland side. EXCEPT when a bite was taken with a little of the carrot salad we got on the side. Oh the carrot salad. It is really super awesome. And like two bucks. Fragrant and sweet, perfectly marinated to still retain a little texture.  We ordered the honey cake for dessert. Truly unlike any dessert I've had. We couldn't stop eating it.

2010-04-01,5.0,"Without taking into consideration the rarity of finding Kyrgyz food in Chicago, Jibek Jolu on its own is a fantastic restaurant with good fresh food that is incredibly satisfying. However, that is not the only reason to come here. Jibek Jolu, which means literally ""silk road,"" is probably one of a few Kyrgyz restaurants in the entire country. For which reason, any person who relishes the opportunity to eat authentically cooked food from other parts of the world should patronize this place. Additionally, Jibek Jolu is clearly a new place, opened by an immigrant family from Kyrgystan, and is one of those spots that contributes to the vitality and diversity of communities in Chicago--the kind of place you hope to run into by accident when wandering from neighborhood to neighborhood in the dead of winter. In other words, an absolute gem and the holy grail of those priceless Chicago meanderings. I went to Jibek Jolu a few days ago with my family and we were instantly and warmly greeted by our waitress who let me just say was cute as a button and incredibly kind. It was not at all surprising that those who are willing to damn a place for lacking completely polished service and slavish waiters were not impressed with a shy and sweet member of family-owned business waiting on them. Touch luck for them but good luck for the rest of us who prefer kindness and authenticity. And yes, we also had a mistake in our bill--they charged us too little! But I assure you that any faults that some of the more wordly gastronomes will find at Jibek Jolu have entirely to do with a family that is trying to start a business in foreign country---something I am completely impressed by. On to the food: Seriously fantastic and absolutely fresh! Speaking as a Turk, Kyrgyz food is a really interesting mix of Russian, Turkish, and Chinese cuisine. Now where can you find that? On the same menu you will have Turkish style stuffed dumplings (Manty), russian beet Borsch, and Lagman (etymologically related to Lo Mein) which are thick noodles in a delightful broth. To start, we ordered to the Samsy which had a wonderful flaky crust filled with that semi-sweet mixture of lamb and onion which invariably imparts a delightful fatty mouth feel. Sprinkle the whole pastry with some black sesame seeds and you have magic! And the best part: they bake everything themselves (including the bread!) fresh daily. Next came our entrees which were the Lagman and Plov. The former is fresh homemade thick noodles with perfectly cooked strips of meat in a light a flavorful sauce. The broth had daikon, light peppers, parsley, and numerous other spices which when combined imparted a tart and fresh taste with a wonderfully spicy finish. The latter, Plov, is practically the national dish of Kyrgyzstan. A rice dish that is buttery and made with carrots and onions and pieces of lamb that are cooked to perfection. Both were absolutely wonderful. For dessert we had the homemade honey cake (our waitress's Grandmother made it!) and which we adored.  All in all the food is a fresh and absolutely satisfying as can be --but the best part is trying a really interesting and new combination of flavors. This place is must for people interested in world cuisine and a must for hungry people who want good filling food and a must for people who love great neighborhood restaurants owned by sweet families.

I ordered the 1/2 portion of borscht (beet soup with cheese for $3) which was still a large portion for one person and quite delicious...good flavor, freshly made and hearty which made good dipping for the bread.  For my entree I ordered manty which consists of 6 large dumplings with beef and pumpkin bits along with a flavorful yogurt to dip the pieces into ($8).  This was quite flavorful and filling.  For dessert i had what was billed as homemade apple pie but actually was just an apple square ($3). This is a BYOB restaurant and some patrons had brought their own wine.  I noticed that the couples dining when I arrived and two other couples who arrrived after me were young ethnic people (asian/russian features) who were polite, greeting each other with a hug.  I felt good vibes in this restaurant, service was excellent and the food was very good and a good value as well.  I highly recommend it and will return.   Here is the link to an interesting video of how the noodles at Jibek Jolu are made painstakingly by hand (which may be a reason the noodle dishes take longer to prepare) :  vimeo.com/9558205 In response to a previous reviewer who complained about the service, mediocre food etc, I believe that when you give off attitude and are impatient, the wait staff does not always respond kindly in any restaurant...  you will reap what you sow!",0.9901,0.825,0.143,0.032,0.5735788690476189

My main was the lamb soup (chorpo?; sorry, it's been awhile since my meal here).  I was reminded of how Curly made chicken soup by pouring hot water over an uncooked chicken into a bowl.  It tasted like lamb boiled in unseasoned water with some diced potato and dill tossed in at the last second.  I was hungry when I walked in, but I didn't come close to finishing this dish.  If this type of cuisine is up your alley, it's all yours. I said I wouldn't dissuade people from coming for the food, but I will for the service.  Have you ever been in a restaurant and gotten the impression that you were bothering the people working there?  That's exactly what it felt like.  I was the only person in the place and I felt like I was making them do chores by serving me lunch.  They only acknowledged my presence when they absolutely had to, i.e., my food was ready.  Plus they overcharged me for my meal.  I asked the waitress if she was sure the total was correct (I pointed out that she had never given me the beverage I ordered) and she said that it was.  I know taxes in this city are ridiculous, but I'm fairly certain that sales tax isn't 30 percent. They made it crystal clear to me that they were not interested in me being a returning customer.  Message received, loud and clear.",0.4154,0.838,0.08,0.082,0.6366780045351473
2010-03-06,4.0,"Located just North of Lincoln Square, this is restaurant offers a rare opportunity to try some Kyrgyzstan cuisine.  ( en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ky…   It's o.k.  I had no idea where it was either.) Jibek Jolu is small, housing only about seven or eight tables.  There's a couple TVs mounted in the corners which, when I was there, were tuned to a soccer game.  Overall, the place looks clean. I ordered, upon the recommendation of the reviews here, the beef manty (although the server said it's lamb, contrary to the menu).  Delicous.  Roughly eight large dumplings with a cucumber yogurt strongly resembling the tzatziki of Greek cuisine. The only real mishap occurred with the check.  The meal (with one of those giant cans of Arizona green tea) came to roughly $10.  I paid with a $20 and asked to have five singles included in my change.  I was misunderstood and ONLY received five singles back so I unwillingly left a 50%+ tip. Everyone in the restaurant, including the other patrons, all seemed to speak the same language (Kyrgyz?), which right or wrong, reassured me of the place's authenticity.   I'd go back again but I recommend it as a lunch place.",0.5994,0.911,0.055,0.034,0.45406746031746037
2010-03-05,3.0,"In short: A great dinner, rare cuisine. It restaurants like these that remind me why I pay such high rent to live in the city. Too over-lit, awkward seating. Get the Manty. In Long: First off, the unpleasantries,I know the exotic-sounding 'Airan milk' sounds tempting, but don't order it unless your ready for a tall glass of sour milk. I wouldn't mention it but that I witnessed another customer make the same mistake (her glass remained full minus 2 sips for the whole meal). And maybe I'm just sensitive but this place is way too over-lit, if they just dimmed the dining room about 30% this could be a really intimate experience, instead paired with the strangely spaced tables creates a somewhat harsh ambiance experience. knocked it from a 4 to a 3 star for me. Now the food! For a food that is unfamiliar to most of us (what is the last Kyrgizstan restaurant you ate at?) the menu was pretty easy to navigate based on descriptions alone. The borscht was the only thing I recognized so we ordered that, the Manty, and the Lagman. The Borscht was the best I every had, and the Lagman soupy blend of hand-pulled uneven noodles and a hot broth perfect for dipping the endless bread they provide, but the house-made beef dumpling Manty was the hero of the meal with it's yogurt sauce topping. I will definitely be returning...with a wide brimmed hat.",0.9822,0.793,0.152,0.055,0.540268817204301

2010-02-21,5.0,"Wow, this place has really good food!  My husband and I were not sure what to expect as this was our first experience trying Krygizstani food.  The meal started with a bread that was good, and a little salty which we enjoyed.  We then had a soup that was so delicious but I can't remember what it is called, something that starts with a ""ch"" -- it was a clear broth with meat dumplings and cheese.  Fabulous!  Based on the reviews here, we ordered the the Lagman and the Manty dishes for our entrees.  Both were delicious!  The lagman -- udon noodles with beef and veggies -- was so flavorful and salty and delicious, I think this was our favorite.  The manty -- meat and pumpkin stuffed dumplings -- were also very flavorful and the accompanying yogurt sauce complemented the flavors perfectly.  All in all our lunch meal was less than $20 for two people.  Service was definitely slooow, but they are new, so we didn't really hold it against them.  This place is about 5 minutes walk from our Lincoln Square home, and I envision us eating here (and getting takeout) often.",0.9935,0.766,0.214,0.02,0.659303561935141
2010-02-20,4.0,"Really torn between 3 and 4 stars but I decided to give it 4 because the food really was quite good. Pros: The food was great, we ordered the two dishes everyone is recommending, splitting the Manty (dumplings filled with beef and small chunks of pumpkin, you can also get vegetarian) and the Lagman (Udon noodles with tons of delicious veggies and beef in a light broth, slightly spicy, not really a soup though). Both really were delicious, the udon noodles were so good and such a fantastic texture and consistency along side the perfectly soft yet crisp veggies in the Lagman. The dumplings were big, six to a plate served around a yogurt/sour cream sort of sauce which complimented them wonderfully. Both dishes were 8 dollars. Also had to try the Baklava which was pretty yummy but not the best I have ever had. It was not sitting in a puddle of honey/syrup which I prefer and am use to getting at Greek restaurants. The Baklava was still really delicious and my partner, who does not enjoy sweets that much, liked it more than I did because it had a lighter touch of honey and sweetness.  The Cons: The service is really awkward and quite slow. I am not that impatient and like to enjoy my meal, I do not mind waiting a bit, however the restaurant is very small, one room, with a fair amount of tables and the awkwardness emerged from an assortment of strange diners and being forced to stare at them in this small room. Three large tables came in after the other all with wine and I was amazed at not only how long it took for these diners to have their orders taken but for them to receive wine glasses for their wine, let alone water. A table of four walked out before their order was taken and a table of four that arrived just before them waited easily 20 minutes before they received water and wine glasses. We luckily arrived and ordered before these other diners and only experienced a moderate wait. Despite the strange dining experience it is certainly worth a try, the food is very good. I still have mixed feelings about the place but man was that Lagman tasty.",0.9973,0.71,0.216,0.074,0.558746355685131
2010-02-18,5.0,"It's always good to see a new restaurant pop up in Lincoln Square that's off the main square and Jibek Jolu is a terrific addition. We went as a group of four this past Monday night - and as the snow fell outside, we sat in one of the large warm and comfortable booths in the window, enjoying cups of hot tea and Russian music videos. The service was a bit off - and we'd probably done better ourselves had we just ordered everything we wanted right off the bat. But, the food more than made up for any deficits. We started with piping hot and flaky meat pies, moved on to bowls of fantastic borsh - filled with beets, carrots, onion, dill and radish and extremely flavorful (chicken base?) meatball soup. Our mains were just as good - diced vegetables and beef in a exceptionally flavorful sauce over homemade noodles, a similar mixture with chicken over rice and an aromatic pilaf with sausage. An absolute must is the Korean carrot salad. I cannot recommend it enough.  All of the food was plentiful, flavorful and dead cheap. We had just enough room for a piece of baklava and apple cake - both made on the premises.  All in all, fantastic. Cannot wait to go back.  As a final note - there seems to be some confusion as to whether it's a BYOB - indeed it is and they're extremely accommodating. We had a nice chat with the owner and got a friendly nod from the cook in the kitchen - who, according to the owner, is cooking using ""secret"" family recipes.  All the more reason to recommend going - if only to try sussing out those secret Silk Road ingredients.",0.9715,0.851,0.113,0.036,0.6588041125541124
2010-02-10,5.0,"For my 100th review, I am honored and enthusiastic to review Jibek Jolu.  Let me preface by saying that this small, quaint Krygizstani restaurant on north Lincoln Avenue gave me one the most interesting and delectable dining experiences i've had in ages. The decor is clean, casual and inviting, going with the whole ""Krygizstan theme"" (i'm sure you're familiar with).  I wasn't expecting such a vibrant array of flavors and impeccable balance.  The carrot salad we began with was downright heavenly, a spicy and interestingly rich array of shaved carrots and radish.  The meatball dumpling soup was expertly crafted; the broth being clear and rich, the dumpling being little shumai-like creations stuffed with chunks of seasoned meat.  Next, the manty!  Oh man, the manty.  Gigantic dumplings stuffed to the gills with lamb and pumpkin.  What I loved about these is that the pumpkin was roasted and not pureed, giving it a  rustic chunky feel.  The yogurt/butter sauce in the middle took it to the next level of deliciousness.  Finally, the lagman I had was great, although i'll admit that i've never had lagman before, much less have EVER heard of it.  But apparently it's a staple in Kyrgistan, so I gave it ago.  I love udon, so this was a no brainer for me...it was the best of russia and asia...stewed meat and pepper and noodles.  This is just a gem-of-a-spot.  The food, service and atmosphere are a welcome addition to a strip of Lincoln that doesn't have much going for it.  I can't wait to go back!",0.9958,0.735,0.236,0.029,0.49462962962962964
2010-01-08,4.0,"After looking up Kyrgizstan on Wikipedia, we headed up Lincoln Ave on a dark and snowy night to try Jibek Jolu. This is exactly the kind of food that should be eaten during winter storm warnings, and the cafe was warm and cozy. Service was friendly -- they even apologized for not having wine glasses (not that we cared). The guys tried the Lagman, but higher praise was given to the Manty (meat-and-pumpkin-stuffed dumplings) and the meatball soup, which was served with good bread. Dumplings here are less like pierogies and more like other Asian-inspired pockets of goodness. Despite what the back of the menu said, I was able to eat meat-free and enjoy the experience. The potato dumplings paired nicely with the carrot salad. Actually my friends ate the first carrot salad so I ordered a second one. There are other salads and I will inquire about the borsht the next time we visit.",0.9865,0.771,0.203,0.026,0.41875
2010-01-01,5.0,"KHYRGIZ FOOD!   I know you're saying, ""K-WHAT?"" Quick breakdown; Khyrgizstan is one of the Central Asian countries that became independent when the Soviet Union fell apart.  The ancient Silk Road passed through Central Asia, and its food and people are the results of centuries of trade and migration and conquest and Stalinist resettlement.  So you get a cuisine that is the crossroads of Turkish, Persian, Russian, Korean and Mongolian movement. Lagman is a mainstay!  I've had it twice before: One mind-blowing time in Russia itself and one disappointingly decent time at Russian Tea Time.  Jibek Jolu's lagman is closer to the mind-blowing time.  As Jennifer P. said, it starts with a base of udon-like noodles, and then at Jibek Jolu it's covered in daikon radish, red,green and sweet banana peppers, lamb and lots of glorious dill!  Also try the Korean carrot salad: the carrots are shredded and marinated in some kind of vinegar until they have the soft consistency of pasta, and then mixed with daikon radish and stuff. Exquisito! The room is lovely and comfy, the staff is very sweet, and Jennifer P., they've completely resolved their service issues, apparently by having the family members who grew up in America work as the waitstaff.  Don't miss this beautiful spot!",0.9654,0.883,0.104,0.013,0.4603703703703703
2009-12-19,4.0,"This is a brand new Kyrgyz joint, open only 3 days, and still struggling with service, having everything on their menu actually available, and the English language.  But they are really, really good at soup. It's a cozy red-painted space with banquettes and a few tables in the old Pizzeria D'Ora space.  Service is very friendly, and the staff (who I'm pretty sure are all related to each other) work hard and cooperate with each other to make sure that what you ordered is actually what you wanted to order.  There were a few other customers in the space, and a steady stream of foot traffic coming in to look at the menu.  For a long time that space has been a black hole of food - terrible pizza, terrible service, mostly deserted - but I think the neighborhood definitely wants more good eating options and it showed. We ordered the ""Samsy"", a spiced lamb meat pie appetizer, the Lagnan, a savory lamb & bell pepper & onion stew served over thick udon-like noodles and a pool of rich red broth, and a soup described as ""large chunks of lamb and red potatoes with dill"" that they didn't have available.  The server suggested the Pelmeni soup - which was the best thing we ate all day.  It's a salty, savory broth with tiny beef-onion dumplings swimming in it and a dollop of sour cream.  At $5, it's enough for a meal, and I'll be coming back again and again for that. I'm really torn between 3 and 4 stars, but the soup put me over.  Consider this a grade on Great Soup, Nice People, and How Much I Think I'll Be Eating There In The Future (Answer:  A lot).  I'd describe the food as related to Russian, Georgian, or Armenian food - same ingredients with slightly different spicing. If you like eating at Russian Tea Time (and who doesn't?), Jibek Jolu is like the hole-in-the wall with the $5-$8 homemade Grandma food version of that.  Think of Podhalanka on Division Street - No frills, but you'll eat a big bowl of homemade soup and some fresh bread for very little money and walk out happy.",0.9919,0.824,0.138,0.038,0.44140545668323444
