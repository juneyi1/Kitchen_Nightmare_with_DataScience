2017-08-25,3.0,"This sandwich shop is next to DePaul and has a very retro feel to it. Students come here all the time.  The decor and the staff are the stars of this restaurants. I didn't think I'd find something like this in Chicago. The atmosphere was so friendly and calming. The staff was by far the friendliest restaurant waitress I've met and she was really nice and polite to everyone.  We went in around 6pm for dinner, no wait. We ordered a Italian beef sandwich and a Italian beef and sausage combo sandwich. The Italian beef tasted old, like it was cooked in the morning old. It was also overly watery such that it soaked up the bread and caused it to fall apart. The Italian beef with sausage was significantly better, according to my brother, as he thoroughly enjoyed his meal.  The staff and decor are good, but the food quality is not worth a 4.5 star on yelp.",0.8997,0.866,0.113,0.022,0.35

But, as other reviewers have mentioned, the woman who runs the place is the star of the show and makes Branko's what it is - which is truly awesome all around. 10 years ago, I stopped in for a sandy and didn't realize it was cash only. With a kind smile, she said she knew I was good for it, and to get her next time. A few days later, I popped in and paid my tab. I moved away shortly after and just recently moved back right next door to Branko's. My family now eats there weekly. Never mind the guy who said everything is fried - their grilled chicken is to die for and incredibly healthy. Branko's is a very rare gem.

It is family owned and operated and they are (especially the woman behind the counter!) literally the nicest people you will ever meet. This is a great ""hole in the wall"" kind of place, a little hidden Lincoln Park gem.      I come here with my sister all the time, and we have NEVER had a bad experience. I mean this incredibly genuinely. If there is a problem with anything, you can always talk to the lady at the counter and she will work it out for you. She remembers little things about everyone's order (for example, they always remember that my sister loves her side of hot peppers) Literally the most spot on costumer service you can ask for. I would give them 6 stars just for the way they treat their costumers.        It's good to keep in mind that it is cash only (there is, however, an ATM at the car wash right next door- note that there is a fee, for those  planning on using). Another note is that some things tend to get pricey (not extremely, but perhaps a good thing to keep in mind for students) so just mind the menu and add ons. But there are plenty of affordable options and combos!    Some good menu items to try are the cheeseburger (great w everything), Chicago style hotdog, chili cheese fries or the grilled chicken sandwich. They also make AMAZING gyros! Today I had a Greek Salad with Gyros which was loaded pretty nicely with meat cooked to perfection.      Hands down, one of the best places to eat in the area.

Walking around campus, I had noticed Branko's and decided to go there. I have never looked back since... Sure, they don't have shakes or waffle fries like other Vienna Beef joints I enjoy but the fact that they do so much so well is why, to this day, there is no other Chicagoland fast food restaurant that comes close to matching Branko's and that includes the Billy Goat, Photo's, Mr. Beef AND Superdawg.  Hot Dogs come in regular and jumbo sizes (go jumbo so you don't need to buy 2, Chicago fast-food fanatics...), Polish Sausage can be steamed or char-grilled and can come with grilled onions at no extra charge, Burgers can come single or double and can be topped with anything you want, Grilled and Breaded Chicken breasts are always great alternatives to beef, fresh subs are large and made to order and their Gyros is the best in Chicagoland... and those are only a few of their selections...and everything comes with free steak fries...
