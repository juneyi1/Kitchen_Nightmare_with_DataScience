I personally feel when you get a certain caliber of food, many times the ambience can be stuffy or uptight.  It was refreshing to be able to relax and enjoy without the stuffiness.   The space is small, no frills. Maybe 25 seats. The chefs serve your food (no servers) and keep it lighthearted.  My husband and I were enjoying figuring everything out and appreciated the creativity. I will be dreaming about the one bite truffle ravioli and the crab apple lollipop.  There was really no course that I could have gone without -- all were well done. It is BYOB, so we brought a red, a white, and a large beer (also bring a little something for the kitchen!).  I was pleasantly surprised that they will pair it for you with each dish. I would love to go back again and see what they come up with next.",0.991,0.725,0.233,0.042,0.3940476190476191
2017-08-13,5.0,"Schwa was great.  The 9 courses were full of flavour and beautifully presented - one of the best meals I've had. The chefs/cooks explained each dish to us in detail. When I asked one to repeat one of the ingredients he told me to listen more carefully. He was honestly kind of a dick but was funny at other times - I still can't decide if I liked him or not. Overall, the service was top notch.  My boyfriend and I had a couple of drinks before going (he was also fighting a cold and on Sudafed) so we basically crawled out of there. We brought 3 bottles of wine and Bulleit for the kitchen and were given our bottle of white back. They gave us other booze to try during our meal.  Schwa certainly isn't your typical dining experience but that's what I loved about it. We were the last ones in the restaurant and they were blaring hip hop. Hip hop happens to be our favourite kind of music so it was all good, but I expect that some might be a little put off by it.  I hope to go back, and will show up dead sober next time. I think it would've made the experience even better. Would 100% recommend.",0.9746,0.768,0.171,0.061,0.5031462585034013
2017-08-08,5.0,"This is my most favorite gourmet place ever. My wife loves it for the delicious food and top notch presentation, I love it for the cool music and laid back feel. There are no waiters, the chefs serve the courses themselves. And oh the courses! The quail egg ravioli might be the single most amazing course I've ever had, better than any single item at the French Laundry, Alinea, Tru, etc.  The best part is it's byob, so the tab is extremely modest considering the quality and talents of the chefs in the kitchen. Tip: bring a six pack or other offering for the fellas in the kitchen, it is well received and probably tastes damn good to them after the last guests leave. I've been to many Michelin restaurants and this is the only one I go back to whenever I can.

You will be served by the chefs, who engage in humorous banter that is refreshingly candid and free of pretense.   Bring a few bottles of wine - some red some white.  They pair and pour it for you.  This is an opportunity to pick some wine you know you love, and avoid paying the typical restaurant price.  It is also customary to bring a bottle of soda mething for the kitchen - we brought bourbon. The food is superb.  The truffled egg ravioli was a highlight.  One course had a smokey broth that impressed, leaving me to expect the (WHAT WAS THIS) would be a contrast of flavor. Nope.  Biting into the pasta unveiled more layers of incredible smokey flavor.  The dish was unexpected and wonderful.  You'll have that experience throughout your meal.

2017-04-16,4.0,"Schwa is located in Wicker Park and is all about a community of chefs collaborating with one another.  They only offer a 9-course menu that is updated seasonally, and the ingredients that are used range from locally-grown produce to harder-to-procure delicacies. My friend had made dinner reservations, and it was a great setting to play catch-up!  We started off with: Bourbon (considered an olfactory journey); Octopus (with carrots and peas); Parparadelle (flavors of summer); Flavors of Forest (pine, snail, moss, and mushroom); Fish Fry (with walleye, morels, malt vinegar, fava, and blackberry); Oyster (7 up); Foie Gras (with mulled wine, oats, maple, and pickled cranberries); Pheasant (with pechuga, plum, pineapple, and corn); Cheesecake (with humboldt fog, fermented apricot, and nasturtium); Unagi (with watermelon and togarashi); and, Ants on a Log (with peanut butter, celery, raisins, and rum; I especially enjoyed this dessert as it reminded me of my childhood!). I liked the fact that each dish was creative and interesting, and that the lack of description on the menu makes it more of a surprise when you receive your plate.  The restaurant itself is also super laid back, intimate (about 26 seats), and an open space where you can watch the chefs do their magic.

After a couple rings, Norman answered the phone and booked me for a table last night, Wednesday after basically letting me know they had plenty of times available for Tuesdays and Wednesdays... so, maybe it's a tad easier to grab a table? You don't go to Schwa for beautiful decor, fancy chandeliers, muzak, etc. you go because the food is incredible and made with passion by some killer chefs.  The food is THE star here... why they choose to keep your surroundings simple. Yes. There's moderate volume music (it's not overly loud where you can't hear each other, but more lively)... Punk, hip hop, whatever they're feeling at the time. Drinks: Bring a bottle of wine per person (we shared our second bottle), and something for the kitchen... we brought a 12 pack of Modelo, and it was a hit! Trust me, bring something for them... you won't regret it! Our first course started with a little cocktail as well, and a few other surprises along the way...

2017-04-03,3.0,"I had a real hard time writing this review. I left Schwa feeling rather ambivalent and that I missed why it was so well rated. While there were some dishes that really shined through as pure excellence, I felt like getting the few excellent dishes was the exception, not the rule. Comparing Schwa to other prix fixe dinners, I left feeling like this was a middle of the road food experience.  The atmosphere, decor, and service were fine. Simple, casual, and urban. We provided the chefs with a fifth of Jameson as we hear this is the standard. We brought only a white wine and the staff were courteous to provide a red for the complimenting dishes. The food? Smaller portions, and, while interesting flavors, not overly impressive when comparing restaurants that Schwa should easily stand as an equal or better to. There was some creativity present. I noticed a dish or two could've used texture or flavor balances as well. For example, the garam masala blend on the seared branzino (perfectly seared in all fairness) seemed to lack balance, overpowered by coriander and cinnamon. The highlight of the evening was a ravioli topped with quail egg, shaved truffle, and parmesan.  I am not disappointed that I came here, but, there are other places in the city that have impressed me more during a coursed meal.",0.9706,0.808,0.165,0.027,0.46398809523809526
2017-03-28,4.0,"I have been holding off on writing a review for Schwa because I have mixed emotions and I finally feel ready. I truly believe that restaurants like Schwa is what makes the Chicago dining scene so excellent.  The dining scene is defined as leading in inventiveness and revolutionary thought.  For that to be successful, the diners must be forgiving and appreciate the risks that the chefs are willing to take.  Here, the chefs have really made this their own. From the rock music, to the friendly banter, to the unique unsuspecting decor outside, to the reservation system... It is a fun experience. When it comes to value, I don't think it is fair for any diners to be complaining. It is phenomenal. It takes tremendous time and effort to constantly develop unique new ideas and on top of that, you get about 12 to 13 courses which is way more than than is promised.  To top it off, there was a pairing to complement each and every dish.  We brought our own red wine but we got so much more than we bargained for.   With each course, we were transported to Germany, India, a chemistry lab, Italy, and more.  I was so excited for each course and the unique ingredients that were in the dishes. We had so much fun trying to guess what ingredients were in the dishes that it was part of the fun. Pickle mustard seeds? Lentils that were fried to the point of exploding but frozen in that state? Foam made from tea?  Jameson shots with the chef? This was such an incredible culinary adventure. The only reason I hesitated so long to write this is because I have to agree with a couple other reviewers that the pork and lamb dishes were incredibly salty.  Would it stop me from coming back? Absolutely not. Even after we left the restaurant, we were marveling at how a quail egg was put in the ravioli and cook just perfectly so that the yoke would just be slightly runny.  That was by far the best dish. All in all I will return with a big bottle of Jameson for the chefs, because they deserve it.  I did not do that on my first experience, but I have a newfound appreciation for what the chefs to here that I absolutely will next time. In order to enjoy, you must come with an open, curious mind ready for the unexpected dining experience and appreciate the creativity that is put in front of you.",0.9969,0.805,0.176,0.019,0.5675553613053612
2017-02-07,5.0,"Schwa is one of the top three best dining experiences I have ever had. I highly recommend this restaurant. Atmosphere: the place is in a strange neighborhood for a Michelin-star restaurant. The space is a cubic room that seats roughly 20-25 people at a time. There is no host stand or entryway - just a square room with tables. The drop ceiling is tinfoil-looking tiles, but the tablecloths, chairs, and dishes are all very nice. Drinks: Schwa is BYOB, and they recommend a bottle of wine per person. They will keep and pour it for a $5 corkage fee. One of our courses was a delicious cocktail accompanied by a snack, and another was accompanied by a house-selected beer. Experience: Many of the courses (we had 12) were brought out of the kitchen by chefs, who took the time to explain each dish. Overall, it took about two hours, but the time flew by. Every chef was very personable and provided great service, asking after our enjoyment of each dish, seeming genuinely interested. Food: Each and every course was incredible. I was truly amazed by the quality of the food here. I've provided a list of our courses (to the best of my memory) below. Last word cocktail with a twist: extra ingredients and fermented lime, accompanied by a mushroom twig with thyme, parsley, and Meyer lemon Citrus-marinated cuttlefish with raisins, shaved fennel, walnut, spice clouds, apricot Quail egg ricotta ravioli with shaved truffle and parmesan cream - their classic course Pasta with braised veal heart, strawberries hydrated in rose, cardamom foam, opal basil - my favorite course Bone marrow creme brulee with caviar, grapefruit Mulligatawny: pompano, carrot sprout, fennel, compressed watermelon with coconut, watermelon spice Crabapple - pickled apple covered in crab covered in candy on a stick rolled in old bay caramel, cashews, and cilantro Pig face fried and coated in chicharrones with bacon dressing, gooseberries, dried and not cherry tomatoes, accompanied by a pretzel with bacon butter and a spotted cow beer Lamb and lamb belly with a nicoise with olive chips, feta, and olive puree Laundry soap: blue pea flower lemonade with citric acid - really cool molecular gastronomy course Lemon rosemary sorbet Corn ricotta pawpaw...",0.995,0.848,0.14,0.012,0.46416666666666656

Music blasting like it was a club. I know, I know, rock-n-roll chefs, blah blah blah. Still, if you're going to do an artistic plating, people should be able to see it. The food ran the gamut from very good to very salty. The cocktail was a Last Word and was excellent. Next was the cuddle fish. It was okay. Ravioli was good but almost anything with truffle is. Bone marrow creme brûlée was fine although there was no hint of marrow flavor. Thai popsicle I liked but my wife thought it was average. Strawberries and cream pasta was interesting. I'm not saying good or bad, just interesting. Mulligatawny was awesome and a totally original take on that soup. The pork course was so so so salty it made me wonder if anyone in the kitchen was tasting the dishes. The same for the lamb course, salty. Also with the lamb there were some flavors the didn't seem to go with the dish. Dessert had some interesting elements but even those seemed like they were out of place. Almost like they would have been interesting components on a savory dish. There were a few more courses but nothing I can remember. The services was okay enough but the timing was off. There were long periods between dishes.  If I could sum this place in one phrase it would be ""slam you over your head experience"". No subtlety or finest here folks.

It's funny because hearing that it was a michelin-rated restaurant, I expected that we needed to dress up. But I was so wrong. This is the most unassuming restaurant with a fun and exciting menu.  There are probably only like 5-6 people who work there. Total. There wasn't a host. There wasn't a designated server. They really seemed that they pitched in and did everything together. To descrive the inside, this place only sits like 20 people. The walls are dark for a calm ambiance and they had simple light bulbs hanging from the ceiling with the bottom of the bulbs painted black as to not be blinding and sent the brightness more up to the light-colored ceiling. One of the chef/server guys was wearing a NIN shirt and I think another was wearing a similar shirt of another band. The place is so small that there is only one bathroom...and it's in the kitchen. That made for an interesting experience to walk back there and see what plates they're prepping.  As for the food, it was truly like a story of different, unique dishes coming out. Some bizarre. Some cool. Some even beautiful. The most memorable was definitely their signature truffle quail egg ravioli that seriously BLEW. MY. MIND. Loved everything about this place.

It didn't feel stuffy or snobby, and I wasn't worried about how I am supposed to hold my wine glass or use my silverware correctly.  We ended up bringing two bottles of wine (one for us and one for them - this was based on previous reviews). We ended up finishing our bottle and wanted more, so we asked for a drink menu. Our waiter decided to bring us each a complimentary drink and even shared a glass of wine from the bottle we brought them, which I thought was very sweet of them.  The food itself was good. The presentation of each dish was amazing! I cant remember the names of all the dishes, but I appreciated how they went through each dish in detail to describe what we were being fed.

We were seated right away (place was pretty empty at 6 but full by the time we left around 10) and although they laughed a bit at us and our copious amount of alcohol (including a bottle for them) , they were so friendly all night. Pro tip: Bring good enough alcohol that you aren't embarrassed by (aka no two buck chuck) but skip the nice bottle you've been saving from your wedding-- they serve the booze in a free for all so we were drinking wine that was definitely not what we brought, and saw ours being poured elsewhere.  When reading the reviews, I didn't understand how it said vegetarians go crazy for this place- but they were extremely accommodating for food restrictions (no pork/shellfish). I wish I could go through everything we ate but I was so enthralled by the experience and amazing presentation, and there were so many courses with so many intricies, that I can't even begin to do them justice.  Although it's not the cheapest dinner in the book ($130/person pre tip, cash only) , every penny is worth it - plus the fact that its BYOB totally helps.

2016-02-14,5.0,"Second time to come to Schwa, and I had very different yet still amazing experiences.  The first time (about nine months ago), I'm quite sure Michael was our waiter. He was very quiet, not super interested in engaging in much discussion on our food, kept our glasses full with the beer we brought. The music was intense and loud, which made the experience all the more interesting. Every course was delectable, and although explained by the various team members, I'm not refined enough to actually know what I was eating. It was all amazing, and upon leaving, we knew we wanted to become as regular as we could afford. Second experience: took my husband there earlier this week for his birthday. Had no issue getting a reservation with about a month notice. Michael was not there, and the service was noticeably different. I enjoyed his quiet edge last time; this second time was more jovial and interactive. Joshua poured us A LOT of booze, even stuff we didn't bring. That was super fun because we had a variety of unique beer and wine to try. The music was also different...it sort of seemed to progress with my mood. Started off with 90s rap, then progressed to pop type music (I may have danced a bit in my seat), and by the end they were playing Tool and my husband was in Heaven. What didn't change was the food: everything we ate was amazing and thoughtfully crafted.  Take home points: - This is the most unique restaurant you will ever try - Michael Carlson and his team have a true passion for food and it is displayed in Schwa - If you take yourself too seriously, don't go to Schwa. You have to know how to have fun and just roll with it -If you're picky, leave that at the door and eat whatever the hell they put in front of you. It will be the best combination of ingredients you ever have - Bring boozey treats for the team - You'll notice my review has no photos.

I really didnt want to write this review, but since I haven't been successful with contacting Michael Carlson via phone, I hoped this might reach him because he needs to know about the ""joke"" of an experience I had at his restaurant.  Someone needs to be held accountable.  This is your reputation Michael. My 6 friends and I had a 9pm reservation.  A little later than I would usually want, but for such a popular place it was all we could get.  We get there at 8:55, and are told very apologetically that our table is not ready yet.  The gentleman asks that we give them 25 mins.  He suggests a bar around the corner.  We gladly go, knowing its a Saturday night...whatever.  We come back 30 mins later.  Table is still not ready.  Well theres nowhere to stand in the restaurant so we stand outside for another 30 mins in the 10 degree weather.  I notice the table is done.  We see the people leave.  But nobody is working to bus the table.  I mean, if I knew I had a table of 6 diners who've been waiting an hour past their reservation I would be hustling my butt to make sure they get sat as soon as possible.  So I walk in and stand by the table.  Finally someone starts to bus it.   This is getting long so Im going to try and cut to the chase.  We sit down and dont receive our first course for 45 mins, which isnt even food...its Bourbon...  20 or 30 mins later finally the food starts coming out.  We took pictures of every dish that we received.  It was supposed to be a 9 course meal, but in the end...at 2am!!! We realize we've only received 5 courses.  6 if you include the bourbon.   On my way to the bathroom, Im confronted by the kitchen who apologizes for the night.  I talked very candidly with them and talked about the reputation we expected.  They again apologized and said ""Thats why we have discounted your bill.""  Well, they gave us 15% off.  15%!!!  When we only received 50% of our meal.  Grant it...it was 2am.  Everyone was tired.  But obviously they were having issues if we didnt get sat till 1 hour after or reso and food didnt drop until 1 hour after seating....horrible.  I would expect such things to occur at Olive garden.  But not at a place with the reputation as this.  Very disappointed...unbeleivably disappointed!",0.8747,0.842,0.088,0.07,0.556905864197531

The front of the restaurant is non-descript, dark. Almost as if it is a shutterred place. But once in you are transported to a different world.. Funky, gritty, groovy.. U pick your adjective. The focus is the food and it was delectable. Each course was well thought out, inventive, clever and ultimately delicious. That grape jelly dish mid course is still lingering on my taste buds. This was a Michelin star experience without the fuss and if I may say pretension. A special word about the servers because I had read mixed things about this aspect. One word to describe my experience with them: delightful. It was one of the most memorable and interactive dining experiences I have had in a while. Each one of them had different personalities but they were all welcoming, funny, warm, playful. And as long as you had a good attitude they obliged. And if you wanted to be left alone that was fine too. So a big shout out to the team at Schwa. You are all fantastic! I did not get the names of most of them but one-Josh: Rock on brother!.

We will keep it here for you until you get back."" So the cab spun right around and less than 5 minutes later we were there.

2015-11-19,5.0,"Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Not that Schwa needs yet another 5 star rating, but I'm adding it anyway.  Hands down, one of the best meals I've had in Chicago and THE best combination of mind-blowing food with a relaxed and fun atmosphere.  The total package.  Chicago has no shortage of fine dining, ""molecular gastronomy"", top quality chefs (Next, Goosefoot, Alinea, and on and on).  But Schwa is the one place where you can go and experience one of these meals without the stiff atmosphere.  You don't have to be on your best behavior.  You don't have to dress up in an uncomfortable outfit.  You go as you are, you get to act normal, and you will have a fun interaction with the chefs while having your taste buds dance the entire night long. Because the items are so unique and creative, I'm not posting pictures or describing individual dishes.  Half the fun of a place like this is knowing that whatever you are served will be phenomenal and going in with no expectations so each item can be a surprise.  Also, the pictures just don't do the meal justice.  If you have food restrictions or allergies, let them know when you come in and they will accommodate you.  But don't limit yourself if there are foods you just don't like.  Be open to as much as you can.  The one thing I like about Schwa that is different from other restaurants in this class (like Next), is that they don't use so many ingredients that you've never heard of or that you did not know were edible just to show you what they can do.  They use more familiar items and ingredients to make the best possible and most unique version of something you may have had.  For example, their version of a fish fry?  Something I could not even comprehend - there were combinations of complex flavors that I've never had and were amazing...and also a familiar taste that took me back to my childhood days of eating at Captain D's.  How is that possible?  By pure genius.  This underlying feeling of comfort with each dish just enhances the overall relaxed atmosphere that Schwa provides.   So here's the deal for Schwa - yes it's very hard to get a reservation.  But my husband got one with only 3 attempts.  The key is to be flexible - have a date in mind but be open to other days near that date.  Be prepared that the date may get cancelled on you.  Yes, they're fickle like that, but it's part of their boyish charm.  Sometimes if you call, they may say ""Do you want to come in tonight?""  He asked for something near our anniversary (11/16) and we got 11/17.  Which was perfect.  So be prepared to make a flexible plan.  It's worth it.  A lot of people have theories on the best time of day to call.  He had the best luck with a 2pm weekday call.   The restaurant is BYOB and although they will tell you not to worry about it, be sure to bring something for the chefs.  They're not picky and they're appreciative of everything.  But bring something just for them.  Don't be that person who brings a 6 pack and gives a bottle to one chef.  We took a bottle of wine for ourselves and a bottle of bourbon for the chefs and that seemed sufficient. The cost is pretty good as compared to other restaurants in this class.  The price varies depending on the particular meal of that day.  The total for 2 before tip was $305, including tax, a $5 corkage fee and $15 for still water (wasn't paying attention when he said there was a tap water option).  That said, once you're in this caliber of dining experience, I'm not sure that $50 here or there really matters.  If you're willing to splurge on this type of meal, just go for it. Have fun with it.  Don't take yourself too seriously because despite the ridiculously high class culinary creations that these geniuses are making, they also don't take themselves too seriously.  There's no pompous arrogance here.  Don't be afraid to get a little tipsy.  The chefs like to share, so don't be surprised if they come out with an additional drink or two that they think might pair better with that item than whatever you brought.  By the end of the night, my husband broke his glass.  Don't worry about it.  They didn't.  And the table next to us of 5 senior citizens (who had been to Schwa many times) came prepared and brought a case of unbreakable wine glasses.  Veterans.  My husband and I also did a shot of Jamieson in the kitchen with the guys to celebrate our anniversary (thanks Joshua!).  That's the type of place this is.  And that is what makes it unique and a clear stand-out over any other dining experience in Chicago and possibly the US.  The food alone would keep Schwa ranked high in a very short list across the country...but the atmosphere and fun experience is what puts it at the top of that list and in a category all on its own.",0.9995,0.767,0.197,0.036,0.5343154761904761

2015-06-11,5.0,"We ate here for our first night in Chicago on our honeymoon. If you can get a reservation, it's best to go in prepared in order to get the most out of your experience (which it is - it's not just the amazing, innovative food, but the atmosphere and overall experience at places like this). We've eaten at other modern and molecular gastronomy-type restaurants in Chicago, and this is a fun departure from the norm. First off, it's difficult to get a reservation. The dining room is small and there's no waiting area. When we arrived, we had the option of waiting for a table to open up, or to grab a table in the middle of some other occupied tables. It's best to come to Schwa with an open mind, both for the food and the atmosphere, so we took a table in the middle of two other tables. They don't rush you through your meal or try to kick you out 20 minutes after you finish; your table is essentially yours until you're ready to leave. It's cozy (we were pretty damn close to the table to our left), but again, open to the experience - we ended up talking with our neighbors, who were a course ahead of us. The kitchen paced our courses so we were eventually getting the same courses at the same time, so we were able to talk about and enjoy the food as a group of four instead of just my husband and I. It was a lot of fun! And we didn't just talk about the food. At the end of the night, we left with invitations to meet up again should our paths cross in the future.  The restaurant is BYOB. We brought a bottle of red wine and a bottle of cider, as well as an additional bottle of cider for the kitchen. From there, they handled our pairings, starting us off with the cider and then moving to the red. Bring what you want, and they'll match your choices up accordingly.  Be ready for some loudish music. You'll be listening to whatever the kitchen feels like at the time. When we were there, it was rap. It didn't bother us. Things are fluid between the dining room and the kitchen, with the cooks being the servers. You can see and hear what's going on in the kitchen, and I'll say that if you're into food and food culture, it can be a really cool experience. And nobody can explain the courses better than the people who design and prepare them. If you're going to go through the process of snagging a reservation at Schwa, know what you're in for. Bring your own beer and/or wine, be open to conversations with your neighbors, and be open to music selection, and obviously be open to the food. The more open you are, the better the experience you'll have. If you're looking for a quiet, romantic date night or a more formal affair, I'd make other arrangements.

2015-05-08,5.0,"We had a wonderful dinner date here, I'm not going to gush on all the amazing food we were served here, because you can read other reviews for that, or the capricious reservation process, instead I will comment on the overall experience. Right off the bat they get 5 stars for being the only establishment outside of Wisconsin I will ever be served a Spotted Cow, but more on that later. You have to be a relaxed, spontaneous, and type who is willing to relinquish total control to a professional. The only things we had any input on were the time we arrived and our BYOB selections. Everything else was sit down, buckle up and hang on. 2.5 hours later you will pull back into station and catch your breath. WARNING** be sure to have at least $400 of available credit on your visa card, because you will not see any prices until you get your bill, and if you are on a date, having to help do dishes can ruin your chances of getting lucky. So we walked in @ 9p. We're shown a table, gave the server, who happened to be one of the chefs, as we're all the servers it seemed, and our bottles of wine. The only thing we were asked was a quirey about food allergies, and then it was off to the races. No menu, no ordering, food just started showing up, and it kept coming, and coming and coming. There was loud rock and rap music playing, but it wasn't obnoxious the way I felt it was at Kuma's when I went there for my first and last visit in 2010. Anyhow, I got the impression it was there for the chefs, not for the diners, which was ok because it contributed to some amazing courses. After the 3rd or 4th course our server/chef offered us some beer, even though we didn't bring any. I think some earlier dinners or one of the chefs must have brought in a sixer of Spotted Cow ale, and we were the lucky recipients of the leftovers. Having visited the brewery in Wisconsin a few years ago with my date, this was Kizmet, as they say. I don't want to go on with superlatives like amazing, gushing, and spectacular about the food. But it was all of the above. Each course was expertly and creatively constructed and plated. We got nice explanations and conversations with our server/chefs(there were at least 3 different ones) with each course. My date lamented that this is as close to Alinea as she will ever get while still paying student loans, which was even funnier considering I paid the tab. Overall the team at Schwa did an exceptional job feeding, entertaining and instructing us on our visit, and I would highly recommend for a memorable date or adventurous fine dining experience!",0.9957,0.826,0.144,0.029,0.5442232353934482

I'm going to keep this one short & succinct.  +Food is amazing. 9 courses that taste unearthly and are presented to blow your mind. +Brother Ali, Atmosphere, and Talib Kweli are some of the artists playing over their sound system. They blare what I like to call White Boy High music, so if that isn't your thing, might want to bring ear plugs. It's my thing so I was loving it. +Service is always amazing yet stays cool & casual. +It's a 3 hour affair. Both times I've gone it's been a little over 3 hours of a dining experience so be ready.  +BYOB. Remember you're going to be there for 3 hours so bring enough liqs accordingly. Don't be a douche and give the chefs your leftover boos (like a table of drunk idiots in suits/fancy dresses did last night)...bring them something intentionally.  +Our bill came to $353 for two with tax & tip. It's pricey. Real pricey. But remember, you're not spending anything on drinks, you're getting a life changing meal prepared by a master of cuisine, and just generally you're going to have an awesome time. Worth every penny.

In fact, they charged us $20.00 for a bottle of Pellegrino.  I wouldn't go back here especially since Chicago has so many amazing places to eat and where you can find creative foods with wine pairings for a similar price.  Sorry Schwa but maybe you had an off night, however, with the difficulty getting a rez, mediocre food and gauging of prices, I wouldn't come back.",0.1752,0.881,0.062,0.056,0.6375

Note: If you are visiting from out of town or can't risk having your reservation cancelled last minute you may want to go elsewhere.  We had our original reservation cancelled a few hours before we were suppose to sit down.  Apparently, that happens on a somewhat frequent basis here.  Additionally, if you in any way want ambiance or a fine dining experience you will be severally disappointed with Schwa.  It is a totally casual situation in every way except the presentation and quality of the food. Now to that food.  Everything was excellent.  It was well presented and cooked perfectly.  There were some great flavors going on and in no way did it fell pretentious or unnecessarily complex  just for the sake of it.  My favorites were a pasta dish, the 'cheese' course and the amuse.  Additional note, the menu posted on line is not for the most part what we ended up eating.   From a BYOB perspective, you may want to bring a red and a white and nothing that has too much of its own flavor profile.  We went with an Oregon Pinot & an easy drinking white and they were perfect.  A good Rose would probably work too. All and all I'm glad we went but I'm not sure I would be back anytime soon.  Food quality is definitely 5 stars.  The rest, including service, is more along the 3 star line or less with the reservation situation being 1 or 2 stars.  I understand they philosophy of it being all about the food but at some level, once you reach their price point, you got to have the other elements to round out the experience. $30+ dollars for Sparkling Water is a joke as well.  On that basis alone I wouldn't go back.",0.971,0.824,0.137,0.039,0.5289039039039038

The chefs/servers were very nice. We did not bring them any booze as some people here have suggested. It did not seem to matter either way.

Service was actually pretty good and loud rock music is to be expected, so this review is just about the food. Quick summary - every dish was dominated by a single one-note flavor that was either too salty, sweet, or sour. Flavors did not work well together and there was always something that was overpowering and not in a good way. The balance of flavors and components was off on each dish, and this just shouldn't happen when you're paying this sort of $$$.  Not sure why Schwa has such a high rating. Maybe it was amazing back when Charlie Trotter and Alinea were the only fine dining options and Schwa provided a fancy tasting menu at a better price and in a much more relaxed atmosphere. Unfortunately, its hey day is over. Too many other amazing places of all price ranges - and definitely not up to par with other tasting menus. More detail - - Caviar shouldn't be paired with super sweet mashed plantains - Foie gras doesn't go with super sweet marshmallow fluff - Black cod is delicious, but when it's in a sour vinegar broth, it gets lost - Lamb would be much tastier if it weren't chewy - Powder in a dish might be cool the first time, but when it's in several dishes it becomes old hat really fast (if it's not old hat already) - The truffle ravioli was the only tasty bite of the meal, though some might say the pasta was too al dente - One of the desserts was supposedly a truffle of white chocolate and tallegio cheese.

2014-11-23,3.0,"Dinner at Schwa is like approaching an ultra-high-maintenance girl at a bar. She's been spoiled with free drinks 1000x times by the disingenuous and now her radar's all whacked out. (ladies, use the ""like a drunk d-bag that expected me to put out"" analogy). She is Schwa--the praise went to their heads. Now they expect tribute as norm and installed a bipolar set of tests to determine if you're worthy of dining. The rite of passage: -------- find  ++++ to skip the hints/getting a seat advice.. -------- 1) Calling ""Is it the right time? Hope I don't get that burger king bit."" 12-4pm on open days is best by most reports. 2) Reaching a human: If it rings repeatedly, nobody's home. Straight to voicemail means slam them with calls; they're on the line. Called Wednesday, 2pm, immediate voicemail. *Redial* *Redial* Got a person. 3) The phone convo + res:  Have a cc ready. You're reserving at least two $110 seats. They'll want a number in case you don't show because there's a 1% chance of that. Swallow your pride and forget the 50/50 chance that they'll cancel. Remember that Schwa plays harder ball than Susan's parents in Seinfeld when they trick George into showing them his non-existent house in the Hamptons.  And don't be a turd: ""I'm available 24/7"" or ""I'll be your best friend"" will both probably get you canceled. They'll ask for a res date. I gave them two weekend evenings one month in advance. They offered multiple times both days and asked for allergies. We confirmed. ""Goodbye"" Breathe a sigh of relief. 4) The waiting game So now you have a month to wonder ""When's that dreaded call coming?"" While waiting, plan a backup that'll accommodate--not Pequods, that'll be packed--or setup a later res you can cancel if Schwa doesn't break your heart last minute.  5) The second call 48 hours before my res and I missed it. Was it a cancellation? My fingers fumbled. Voicemail: ""Vinny from Schwa, calling to confirm. Call me back."" Played it cool and waited 8 minutes.  ""Schwa, this is Vinny."" ""Hey Vinny, you just called. I'm confirming my res.."" ""Ok man, we got you."" ""Great Vinny. I'm bringing you guys some beer from B----. What styles do you like?"" ""Ah man, you don't have to."" ""Yeah but I want to, hear you guys appreciate good stuff."" ""Uh, We'll drink anything. IPAs.."" ""Sours?"" ""We love sours"" ""Awesome. I'll bring a few you guys have never tried."" ""Thanks man. See you."" 6) The last 48 2 days to go. Keep sweating. From what I've read, they will cancel up until one hour before. With a 6pm res looming, we started celebrating at 5:10, downed a fourth cocktail, and cabbed crosstown mid rush-hour. The cabbie drove like the devil. No Hendrix' Crosstown Traffic on the radio. 7) 6:00pm, Friday, 11/15/2014. No note, door opens. We enter... ++++ Glowing but dingy from the hanging bulbs and paint combo, seedy looking red kitchen through the small window and open doorway. That's where the six cooks are. Vinny comes out, greets, and gives us choice of 2-top. We choose the heater seats by the door.  Music is not too loud. Once at capacity (7:30 on Friday), Schwa has a good buzz, like crowded (not packed) bar. If this is too loud for you, don't think of going to Aviary. Service.. it's already been noted: not ISIS but definitely a mixed bag. Servers quoted different ingredients to different tables. Their conversation skills could use some sharpening, too unenthusiastic to explain even techniques. Bring alcohol for them but don't sweat. My hard-to-find gifts were met with the same enthusiasm as another table's crown-royal: a monotone ""You guys are awesome."" Again, after 1000x free drinks, it's the act of tribute they expect.

Consistently SWEET, NOT salt. Confusing combinations: - a perfectly cooked scallop smothered in allspice and white chocolate - roe totally masked by gooey plantain and banana - black cod and beer foam?! Combinations ranging from questionable to bizarre, the small proteins overshadowed. Positive savory memories include  1) the quail egg ravioli 2) sweetbread mustard bites with daisy cutter IPA. And then Schwa shifted again.. the desserts were stellar.  1) The chimay creme brulee is easily the best cheese course to grace my lips. Tangy and rich, fermented huckleberry supplies the acid.  2) The pickled watermelon and rind with unagi ice cream was one bite, a delicious marriage, bright and refreshing while sweet.  3) Finally came the build-your-own parsnip rootbeer float. 3D, time-sensitive, playful, and above all, tasty. Having seen other diner's reviews/pics, I'd risk Schwa again. Current menu is weak on savory; past menus seem stronger. Desserts seem consistently great across reviews, so Schwa is 4-5* after savory improvement.

I'm torn about how to review, since I recognize the creativity and thought that went into the amazingly complex and interesting menu items. Every dish was beautifully presented. Many were ""playful""--meant to be eaten in one bite, drank from a straw, etc. All had surprising combinations of flavors and textures, but not all were tasty. Personally, I found our menu too heavy on the flower flavors, as well as too much pickling. There were a couple of things I just didn't want to eat, and at the end of it all, I longed for a nice piece of crusty bread with butter.  The service was, for the most part, excellent. But there were some off moments... When we entered, we were asked if this was our first time at Schwa. We said yes. The man replied something like, Well, we're gonna feed you. No explanation of the menu, the number of courses, the theme (if there was one) behind it all. Also, his eyes were locked entirely on my husband, which is annoying and rude. Hey, I'm here too! Other than that, I liked the fact that the kitchen staff popped out to serve and that all seemed truly passionate about their food. They were happy to explain each course and how to best eat it (although, honestly, I could not eat the ravioli dish in 1 bite. Please bring me a fork!) Ambience was cool, relaxed. I only wish they had turned the volume down on the head-banging music. My husband and I sat at a small table for 2 and occasionally had trouble hearing each other. So, to sum up--I'd say it was worth the price, and an interesting experience, but could have been better.",0.9967,0.717,0.236,0.047,0.5600694444444445

It is a visceral experience and you should relax and just enjoy the ride.

But thank god we brought a lot of wine because that was the best part of our experience!  The vibe of the place is pretty cool - small, little loud, but I liked the hip hop/rap playlist. There are only a few tables so it's quite cozy, and you walk by the kitchen to use the restroom. The service itself was a little disappointing. Not super friendly, just set our plates down, said what it was, and left.  The major issue I had with the place was the food. It was either a) too salty, or b) tasted like flowers. Flowers are great, but I don't need the taste of roses/rosewater in 1/4 of my dishes. The salt was just so overpowering in so many of the dishes it was inedible. There were a couple highlights - one being the quail egg ravioli, and the salad served in a white chocolate bowl. They were presented really nicely, and were delicious. The rest of the food seemed disjointed, random, and had no flow. I left wanting more. So much so that we had to grab food elsewhere after dropping $150+ at Schwa.  Overall, in my opinion, Schwa was not worth the hype. Or the price. Your wallet and tastebuds will not leave happy.",0.979,0.769,0.166,0.065,0.5146953405017921
2014-09-23,1.0,"Really wanted to love our meal as we had been ready to splurge and treat ourselves. Unfortunately, there were just too many disappointments which I can summarize into 4 categories: 1. Salt, Salt, Salt - Everything tasted the same Explain to me how a lychee aperitif and a white chocolate bowl salad can taste salty?! Perhaps it was the overuse of floral flavours (too much rosewater?) or the flower petals on the dishes, but every bite was SO salty. I thought my blood pressure increased by 20 pts.  I don't know what the spices were but the natural flavours of the foods were non-existent. Be prepared to drink lots of water (which by the way there is a charge of $10 for).  2. No continuity between courses I typically expect a progression of foods from lighter fare to more complex, with a climax and into dessert. This did not happen. The opening aperitif and salads were the only progressions that made sense. For example, I'm not sure how a 'breakfast themed' plate fit in - sweet french toast and an english muffin - and how a random ""fried sweet breads at the ballpark"" came into the mix. It was confusing and lacked careful, delicate thought of a person's flavour palette.  3.  Lack of Protein  We left starving. You would think after 9 courses, you would be stuffed but my belly only contained a bottle of wine.  When the dishes had protein, they were incredibly tiny and did not taste good. My oyster tasted sour and rotten. When asked about the lamb, the server was very defensive to assure us it was cooked all the way through.  4. Grotesque service -  They are not interested in chatting or describing the plates. Just want you to swallow the dish and if there is anything left over, you will get a dirty look. We had no idea how far into the meal we were (some course cards would be helpful) and the bill was slopped onto the table without a ""Thank-You / enjoy your evening."" From the other reviews, now I know why we had such a hard time when we asked for our extra bottle of wine back. And how we had to ask AGAIN for our wine bag. Overall, we left Schwa feeling hungry, disappointed and a waste of money/time. It as not a good experience, because there was too much focus on presentation, and Schwa missed the mark on flavours and service.",-0.9718,0.788,0.084,0.128,0.44957729468599045

Food was amazing (it better be for the $160+ a pop!) and I was very impressed with the quality and creativity of every course. If you're interested in molecular gastronomy but don't want to spring for Alinea, it's definitely a good place to go. Really liked the laid-back ambience - I hate feeling like my money is going towards weird art on the walls. I wouldn't have minded if it was a little less casual though. I mean, if I'm dishing out $330 for a single meal, I'm not going to show up in jeans and a tshirt (which most of the other diners did). But I guess you can't fault the establishment for how other diners are dressed. My only complaint was the price. I mean, yes, I knew it was going to be pricey. But their (not up-to-date) menu online currently says $110 per person plus a $2.50 corkage fee. When we got the bill, it was $240 for two - no explanation as to where the extra $15 came from. This including tax came to $275 before tip. I mean, I'm not about to nitpick over $15 when I just dropped $300+ on a meal, but I'd have liked some advance notice if they'd upped the price. If not...well then I guess we got ripped off? My advice would be to confirm the price ahead of time because I definitely walked away feeling a little uneasy about the unexpected surcharge.",0.9818,0.769,0.173,0.059,0.5685453869047619

2014-06-05,3.0,"I became determined to go to Schwa after I heard that they serve antelope raised on a Texan farm and shot from a helicopter by a Navy SEAL sniper. This sounded so absurdly extravagant that I had to go. The perception that getting a reservation at Schwa is impossible seems to be mostly hype. Of course they don't pick up the phone during most of the day, but I called around 5pm on a weeknight, and someone picked up. I made a 9pm reservation for myself and a friend. About a week later, on the night of June 4th, we went to Schwa. As is custom, we brought a bottle of Jameson for the house, and a bottle of Red vin de Bourgogne for ourselves. We observed that the restaurant was tiny, but the interior decor was, in its subtle way, really original and cool. The speakers blared hard rap, West-Coast Hip Hop, and occasionally metal. Whoever composed the playlist had great taste: the atmosphere was awesome; it managed to be both intimate and aggressively in-your-face. The place really had personality and attitude. The staff was also super-cool: everyone was really friendly, chill, and informal. After the meal, we took shots and group photos with the chefs. (Though unfortunately Michael Carlson was not present tonight.) Schwa definitely has the best atmosphere/environment of any restaurant I've been to. Now to the food itself. First, I need to mention that I came to the restaurant with a slightly burnt tongue (I had an overly hot beverage in the morning) and on a mostly empty stomach, which I would not recommend. The small portions can be overwhelmingly flavorful, and combining those with plenty of alcohol and an empty stomach can be too much. Eat some bread before you go. We were served twelve courses. The plates were, as expected, very small, but extremely interesting. Parmesan ice cream? Butterscotch powder? Pickled blueberries? Flamed cheese with fermented huckleberries? At Schwa, you will be presented food probably quite unlike you've ever had before. Their takes on particular items and reinterpretations of traditional meals are, indeed, very creative and impressive from an artistic point of view.  We thus got the impression that Schwa is probably where good chefs come to eat: to be inspired, to relish in the cleverness and unusual brilliance behind some of the dishes. A true connoisseur of food is likely to have a blast at Schwa. Perhaps Schwa is to food what Captain Beefheart is to rock music. But my tastes are perhaps not yet so advanced. I just couldn't really get into the food. A one-sentence summary to justify the 3/5 rating I am giving Schwa is that most of the dishes were interesting, but did not leave me wanting more. One dish specifically I disliked: the marinated cuttlefish with frozen bits of apple in a chilled cucumber/lemon sauce. The lobster was also surprisingly chewy. Perhaps Schwa just strikes an unlucky chord with me: many of the dishes on the menu involved citrus flavors in some fashion: lemon foam was quite common, which is something that I personally simply don't like (same with cilantro). Though I'm sure the cooking was fine and most people would rate the food rather highly, this personal preference just ruined some of the dishes for me, which is unfortunate.  The famous quail egg raviolo was all right. It was pretty tasty, but it was not the divine experience that some other reviewers recount. The antelope was fine, though I have had better meat at other restaurants. Perhaps the food was generally a little too experimental for me. While I can get behind the notion of foams and creams constituting the majority of the meals, I just couldn't dig the citrus-theme that seemed to pervade the foams, and some of the flavor-themes that generally defined the dishes. So, in conclusion: Schwa has the coolest atmosphere in Chicago, you should go just to experience the attitude. The food, though super-interesting, was not quite my cup of tea, but that may be due to personal preferences and coming a little ill-prepared. You might get much more out of it than I did.",0.9974,0.811,0.14,0.05,0.5539425139425139

FOOD: 4 stars. I liked the food, just didn't think it stood out among other restaurants in its same caliber. There was the quail egg which everyone dished about, but for me, it was overly creamy and overly salty which made the flavor unoriginal. The venison we received was tough and my least favorite dish. And, the story that came with the venison dish was that the deer are not stressed when they're killed which means that it tastes better. How is there no stress involved in the killing? Oh yeah, there's a sniper in a helicopter that shoots it so that they aren't herded and terrified. I'm sure that the sound of the helicopter and the seeing of other deer being shot will terrify another deer. Anyway, had to share my thoughts on that story (you are reading my review)... SERVICE: 4 stars. Good. Sporadic, but still attentive. There's no buckets for your wine or beer so they'll take it back to the fridge for you. Someone does explain what each dish is, not that it matters because you can't hear (I'll get to that next)... ATMOSPHERE: 2 stars.

First, this place should be renamed ""Hype"" because that's all it is.  The rumors about the impossible reservation and stellar food are all HYPE.  I called on a Tuesday morning and they rattled off possible days and times, so there is a lot of availability. I called once, it rang 3 times, done. When I made the reservation, the punk [he was so rude and blasé, I can call him a punk] on the phone told me to bring my own booze.  I had a friend who had been to Schwa and he told me it is customary to also bring a bottle for the staff. Basically, you have to spend $300 for food, $100 for booze, and then some more for the staff? Ok... I just went with it.   Let's review the courses.  While on their website it may display that they offer 9 courses, that wasn't what they were doing... it was 7... Again, I went with it.  First course: A hairball, a combo that was on the floor of the a movie theatre Second Course: a HUGE piece of ravioli that you have to eat in one bite while the waiter stands there and watches like a freak. Third Course: You know what would be a great idea, let's drop this old piece of lobster overcook it, then drop it in Dawn Lavender Dish Soap and call it a foam Fourth Course: pieces of gooseberry...with no meat Fifth Course: Who cares? Sixth Course: I want my money back! Seventh Course: Chocolate and grounds of coffee you have to lick off a plate Each plate was as if they asked a child to decorate and then forgot to place the protein on the plate! The service was so absurd, I'm convinced you have to be a line cook at Ed Debevik's before transferring to Schwa. They ended our meal with giving a little insult while placing the check down...it is laughable that this is considered fine dining.  Save your money and go to L20 or Next.  No need to go to HYPE.

2014-03-26,5.0,"I dined at Schwa last night and it was one of the best, if not THE best, meals I've ever eaten.  It started out with something reminiscent of MOTO; pizza-flavored cotton candy and buttered popcorn soda. But from that point on, the dishes were more on par with Alinea with flavors even more memorable and unique. Every dish was outstanding with flavors that were both experimental and yet destined to be together. For example, the dish with still milk/white chocolate, basil puree, crispy basil leaves, caviar, carbonated pear and olive oil dust tasted like a delicacy from another planet. The two different raviolis were so outrageously delectable, it was hard to imagine how anything else could come close. And yet, the other dishes were even more complex and just as tasty. Quail egg ravioli with cheese and black truffle. Then we were served a different ravioli/agnolotti with crispy prosciutto, cheese and cubes of sweet potato and persimmon. The cuttlefish was hidden under apple ice and resting in an unbelievably elegant broth/gazpacho made from jalapenos, garlic, mint, cucumber, fennel and a few other things. My first time trying sweetbreads and now I want more. I'm not a huge organ meat fan but I would order these again in a heartbeat. The taste was like the most soft, fatty, delicious, amish chicken I've ever had. it was prepared with fois gras, thanksgiving gravy, and pomegranate. One of the best cuts of venison I've ever had, encrusted with pistacio and trail mix dust, foam and cherry/cranberry fruit leather. The house-made root-beer with butterscotch dust and parsnip ice cream was nice, very sweet but the flavors meshed well. Reminded me of desserts served at iNG. My favorite dessert was the meth crystals (menthol) with yellow snow (passion fruit, ginger sauce) followed by a warm chocolate marshmallow.  Overall, I was blown away by the presentation and taste of the food. I personally enjoyed the loud music, gritty atmosphere and casual service style. I can hardly wait to eat here again.",0.9936,0.821,0.158,0.021,0.5741085271317831
2014-03-26,1.0,After reading so many reviews that this place was wonderful and extremely hard to get into I tried my hat making the reservation for this place. After nearly 2 weeks of trying to call this restaurant to book a reservation I finally got through and it was able to book a reservation for 6 o'clock when I arrived I found that this place was a complete joke visually it looked like a homeless shelter and the cooks were goofing off in the kitchen while blasting music I'm all for the quirky but this is just ridiculous for the sake of being stupid.. It has a whole hipster vibe where they're trying not to be pretencious to not conform but by doing that they're being pretencious everything of course has the typical foam and small bites to it and they have to add the rap music blaring from the kitchen which I thought was stupid do not waste your time here for the price you're not getting that great of a meal the atmosphere sucks the place looks like homeless shelter and if you want to spend three hours taking bite-size portions by all means waste the months of your time and trying get through on this ridiculous reservation system they set up just to be different..,-0.7745,0.839,0.072,0.089,0.5912698412698413
2014-03-15,4.0,I was driving down the street when I saw one the staff members cleaning up the outside of the restaurant. I immediately pulled over and hopped out of the car to ask about getting a reservation. I really lucked up because he was the owner/chef and told me they had a table available that night due to a cancelation.  Needless to say I jumped at the chance.  My dinner was amazing but for the price point i expected it to be. My favorite dish was the quail egg ravioli. I was looking forward to trying the rabbit but they did not serve it that night. The atmosphere was really urban and relaxed. The chef also served as the waiter which I thought was a nice touch. He was more knowledgeable about the source and preparation on the food than your typical waiter.

I'm not going to go course by course over what I ate, others have done that.  Some dishes were better than others, but all were excellent.  Highlights were: quail egg ravioli, lobster dish and sweetbreads.   There were many times where I wanted to lick my plate, the flavors were just so awesome.  The broth in the cuddle fish dish was a little salty, but I love salt, so no complaints there.  Antelope was a little rare.  Good portion sizes.  We were in and out in three hours, three+ bottles of wine for three people.  I didn't leave too drunk or hungry. I thought the food at Schwa was better and found the atmosphere more lively than El or Elizabeth.    Service was great.  The guys were all so friendly and everything was presented beautifully and timed right for serving.  I thought service might be lacking a little based on reviews and preconceived notions of the guys, but service was really spot on.  The guys were chill, but knowledgeable and very friendly.   The music is loud, as noted in many other reviews, so it was a little difficult for my half-deaf friend to hear, but nothing that talking loudly couldn't solve.  Thankfully the people seated next to us finished their meal while we were in the beginning courses, so we weren't too annoying with our loud talking.",0.9957,0.746,0.203,0.051,0.5772556390977444

The place is pretty easy to find.  Just look for the black awning with the words Schwa, right across the street from the neon lights of the rim shop.  So the restaurant is bare bones, with a basically open kitchen right next to the dining room.  Only 26 seats and the place is small; its small enough that you have to use the bathroom in the kitchen area. They have painted floors and tin ceilings, with lightbulbs hanging above each table, and the chefs were listening to West Coast hip hop.  They're BYOB, so I picked up craft beers for us and the kitchen.  They were pretty cool and hooked us up with some red wine, when we ran out of beer.  The dinner was very casual and lots of fun, with different chefs bringing out the 9 courses. They menu was very vague, with just the main ingredients for each course, but that's the fun of it.  You never know exactly what you're going to get.  Some of my favorites were the pizza cotton candy, quail egg ravioli and truffles, tagliette rabbit pasta with foie gras, and the various ice creams like the uni and sweet pea.  The funniest ingredient of the meal was the Elk, apparently shot from a helicopter by a sniper.

First, it doesn't have all the pomp and circumstance, taking itself far too seriously, as many other fine dining establishments do. I like that.  It's 2014, I shouldn't have to wear a jacket and tie to eat in your place.  If you aren't a pretentious, yuppie douchebag who refers to themselves as a ""foodie"" (air quotes included), you will likely also fall in love with Schwa.  The food is magnificent and creative, the soundtrack excellent and the chefs are lovely human beings. I could go through and detail each dish, and name drop (my homeboy Quail Egg Ravioli), but you don't need that. Just know that they are all magnificent. I don't recall ever thinking on one course, ""they missed on this one"", as I have at some other places. Plus, they ended up bringing us like 14 courses, since I think they liked us. In the interests of full disclosure, I was tanked by the tenth course, so maybe they did miss, but I'm sure I'd have some recollection of it.  I was so drunk because it's BYOB, and we brought more than was necessary, to give the chefs some pairing options. They kept pairing everything and we kept drinking. The BYOB option saves some cash, but that's not really necessary, considering the price point for dinner doesn't come close to what they could charge, based on the quality.  Yes, it's got a chaotic system for reservations, but that just makes things interesting. It's well documented by now, so quit whining about it.

I emailed them later to ask them what sort of alcohol they would recommend for their menu and they were precise with their response (they recommended a bottle of red and white and a jameson for the chef!). We went there not knowing what to expect. The restaurant was small, maybe 8 tables, very minimalist and very dark with black walls and dimmed light bulbs.

2013-09-22,5.0,"Michael Carlson. The legend. Infamous. Genius. Troubled. I suppose all of these apply. The stories are bountiful. The GQ profile on him a few years ago put Schwa on my list of musts. Every year I meet my daughter in some city and we dine, visit museums and Dad insists on taking his college-budget daughter shopping. It's always a blast. Last year it was Tokyo, Jiro and Narasawa. This year it was Chicago with Schwa and Moto. The less said about Moto the better. I've always liked Chicago. I think it's the most adventurous food city in the US. My bar was set high and most places could never deliver on my hyped expectations.  Knowing Schwa is BYOB I picked up a bottle of bubbles and a bottle of red on the way over. Arriving in front I saw no pretense, nothing of note other than a black and white awning with the lower case ""schwa"" to let us know we'd arrived. The door, with a small porthole window, opened and we were greeted to cranked rap music chronicling somebody's anal sex obsession. Off to a start that didn't seem far off from what I was expecting. The walls, in the dim light, appeared to be mustard yellow from the ceiling down two-thirds the wall. The bottom third was black and they were joined with a black spray-paint wainscoting. The ceiling tiles were covered in silver mylar film. OK. I'm in love with this place already. We were seated and whatdya know? The staff fit right in. Hairy and inked, this was one of the best staffs I've seen. I think at one point or another everybody in the kitchen helped at my table. This group is a team. As each course arrived at the table we were told a bit about it. Wine glasses were...uhh...glasses. The wine still tasted great. One menu. Prix fixe. I won't go through all the courses.

The music is loud, there is no front of house staff, the chefs welcome you, serve you, guide you. It's paradise for those guests who enjoy being surprised and delighted with great course after great course.  I found out after the fact that Schwa is known for its rambunctious chef, Carlson, who was not there the night we dined. Instead, we fell in love with our chef team: Josh, Nick, ""Tony Stark"" (didn't catch his name, but suffice to say he looks like Tony Stark), and a 4th, whose name we also didn't catch. All four were genuine, welcoming, attentive, and above all, fucking awesome chefs. Throughout the meal, Josh was attentive with our wines, asked if the pacing was to our liking, and inquired how we felt about each dish presented. He never assumed that we enjoyed it, but instead asked what we thought. I loved that.  When the meal was over, I was straight up angry. I wanted more. I can't wait to come back to Schwa.

Let's just get something out of the way real quick--- the quail egg ravioli. THE FUCKING QUAIL EGG RAVIOLI. My mom asked me how my dinner was going. I sent my mom a text back saying ""I just ate something so good that it gave me about 90% of an orgasm"". That is not at all an appropriate text to send to your mother, but phenomenal food makes people do strange things. Plus, it's definitely true. People like to throw around the word 'orgasmic' when describing great things, but truly... this ravioli... my god... I basically gave the finger to social decency and I licked my plate clean for everyone to see. I couldn't even begin to care about things like 'appearance' or 'will this make people at the next table feel uncomfortable?'. That ravioli must be savored.  How many times have you had pizza cotton candy? 0 times, you say? That's too bad because it is a delicious mind fuck. Go to Schwa, eat some weird stuff, become a better person for it. The service is how service should be everywhere. No BS. The guy who is bringing you your food is the guy who made your food. No one is looking over your shoulder to make sure that you are using the right fork or testing you on your fine dining etiquette. Everyone who came to our table was great. Joshua in particular is a bad ass. Everyone there kept refilling my glass with the booze that I brought (I brought a lot of it, but I will get to that in a minute). They have a fantastic taste in music, the playlist is definitely what you should be listening to at that moment. There is no classical music or weird cocktail lounge techno like the crap that plays at other places. There is Biggie, Ministry and Slayer. If you don't love listening to that while you eat white chocolate filled beets then you don't know how to live life, and that sucks.  BYOB. Bring some white wine, bring some red wine, bring some beer, bring some liquor, and bring some to share. Drink all of it. Get Schwasted (see what I did there?). At least that's what we did, and we had a great time. This is my favorite restaurant I have ever been to. I can't imagine that it gets much better than this.  p.s. I don't understand all of the stress over getting a reservation. They answer the phone every time I call, even if it is just to ask them a question. Maybe I'm just lucky? Maybe I should consider going pro when it comes to getting a Schwa reservation? Perhaps. p.s. again: boo-effing-hoo to everyone with the 1 star reviews.

It's a MUST for foodies that don't care about the stuffy conventions of fine dining, such as nice decor, comfortable seating, servers or a menu. For those who do complain about these kind of things, get over yourself, or go dine somewhere with more convention and less artfulness. The food here is phenomenal and it's a bargain for only $110 per person, plus BYOB to keep the booze flowing and the price down.  Expert tip: you'll have a better experience if you bring the chefs a gift, namely a bottle of liquor.  The cool thing about Schwa is that it isn't trying to be an interesting, unique place like restaurants such as El Ideas. It's unique because the chef is a mad genius who has absolutely no idea how to run a successful restaurant, but only how to create phenomenal dishes. Some of the dishes don't work, and some work but with very weird flavors that shock boring diners. Keep your mind open and you'll enjoy yourself thoroughly. You can even walk into the kitchen and observe the chefs at work and shake their hands to thank them for the meal of a lifetime.

The run-down: Reservations:  easy-peezy.  Beginner's luck, I guess, but I saw on Twitter that they were answering the phone, so I called and got a reservation for a Friday night at 8. No problem. They called a day prior to the res to remind us.  We were asked 3 times about dietary restrictions, which I think is professional and considerate.  Here's my tip:  put their number in your phone, call between 2 and 5 Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and see what you get.  Or, if you're more of the spontaneous type, swing by at 9:30 on a Friday or Saturday night and see if they have space for you. They just might.  The intro: The space is cool and intimate. The dining area is one room.  We were greeted immediately and sat ourselves.  My dining partner and I both noticed the music.  Mostly old rap and some LCD Soundsystem.  It's whatever the chefs want to hear, and it's awesome.  I promptly cracked a glass when I knocked my wine bottle (BYOB!) against it.  I was brought a new one immediately, and told 'shit happens, no worries.""  They provide a wine key but don't open your wine for you.  They will, however, chill your wine and re-pour, often.  If you know about Schwa, you know that the focus is on the food and the fun, not on pretension. Check yours at the door if you have it at all.  The goods:  awesome! We started with two beverages:  one take on a Manhattan with a cherry covered chocolate.  That's right, a cherry-covered chocolate.  Deeee-lish.  Then a popcorn soda with an orchid in it.  So much fun!   All of the dishes were fantastic.  Some we liked more than others, of course. But they were each extremely tasty and creative.  My dining partner almost licked her petri dish of Thai goodness clean.  I almost died over the pork belly, the quail egg ravioli ravioli, the gnocchi and a number of other dishes. The food is creative, fun, and tasty.  And don't be turned off by the small bites.  You WILL get full.  Very, very full if you're nice enough to be slipped a couple extra dishes by the chefs.  (And by 'nice', I mean personality and appreciation of the work the chefs are doing.)   Just for comparison's sake:  my dining partner had been to the Hunt at Next the weekend prior to our dinner at Schwa (lucky girl).  Her words a few courses into the meal at Schwa:  ""F&@K Next"".  No lie.  We loved being served by the chefs.  Totally personable, but busy!  I cannot believe that some of the reviews here complain about a lack of getting a hug or the assumption that the chefs expect Jamo.  We didn't bring Jamo and were treated wonderfully.  We made friends with the tables around us, offering them sips of our white whiskey (moonshine, y'all!).  Our servers had some too.  By the end of the night, we were playing Cards Against Humanity with the table next to us, and having conversations about LCD Soundsystem and Daft Punk in the kitchen, which the chefs cleaned up.   It was definitely one of the best meals I've ever had (and I've had some good ones!), based both on the food and the experience as a whole.   Go and love it.",0.9983,0.779,0.179,0.042,0.5192159477427335

It's BYOB, which is not the easiest task when you're from out of town, we had the cab driver wait for us at the Binny's parking lot and then hauled the stuff.  We bought 4 bottles, one Jameson for the kitchen, we wanted to start off with good karma.

The bathroom is through the kitchen and the walk there, while short, is a little greasy, so ladies, make sure to plant your feet when stepping.  The loo is super small and the friendly kitchen would offer us Jameson shots after we did out biz.  Very cool.   Timing on the courses were off, it took almost four hours for our meal, I think it was supposed to be 9 courses, kitchen threw in extras, but still, it was a bit drawn out.  We actually ran out of wine and the kitchen brought us a new bottle of red from the back, so nice of them.   No photos, but I saw other patrons snapping away, with a flash, so I drew out my phone.  The staff were very chill, almost to a fault, they seemed overly wired and a bit unpolished for my taste.   Highly disappointing experience.  Cool concept and vibe, but flavors were not balanced enough for me and not memorable.",0.9635,0.835,0.105,0.06,0.49107369996258887

2013-04-02,3.0,"There is a lot of hype surrounding Schwa (good and bad), so I didn't know what to expect.  However given the price point, I was going to hold it to a certain basic set of standards that I have held all the other prix fixe menu restaurants that charge over $100/meal that I have eaten at.  And let me say, Schwa fell short.  Let me explain. 1) Getting a reservation.  It is a pathetic and unprofessional system.  You call. They don't answer and the mailbox is always full.  We called probably over 150 times in a span of a couple weeks.  We got through 3 times.  The first two, we were told the books were only open about a week out. The third time (after calling 100 times in a row-- no exaggeration, we have the phone documentation to prove it), they again said the books were not open for 2 weeks out (when we wanted a reservation), but then acted like they were doing us a favor and finally gave us a reservation. 2) Before going to dinner, we hear from several sources -- a couple friends who had been, a salesman at Binny's who had been, and several sources on the web that all stated that the kitchen staff EXPECTS an alcoholic gift.  Wine, bear, liquor, something.  Let me take a second to say how RIDICULOUS that is. I guess coming and paying for my meal isn't good enough here.  We even saw another group come in with homemade cupcakes for the kitchen staff the night we were there.  This is completely lost on me.  If I choose to bring a gift, that is one thing.  But the fact that it is EXPECTED, is ridiculous.   3) So after ALL that, I at least expected the food to blow me away.  Sadly, I wasn't.  We did the 9 course menu.  There were probably 4 courses that were fantastic, including the truffle ravioli and the chestnut gnocchetti.  The truffle ravioli was heavenly.  That is a keeper.  For that I give them great credit.  There were 2 courses however that were terrible.  One was a beet and white chocolate set of truffles that I would have spit out if that was socially acceptable.  The other was a small vase with a liqueur inside and an edible orchid -- tasted like soil.  The rest of the courses were good, but not amazing.   4) The service also fell short.  The dishes would be set in front of us, and then quickly ingredients would be rattled off and then they would disappear, leaving the 4 of us trying to piece together what exactly we were about to eat.  I don't mind not seeing a menu at the start of the meal -- it gives the meal an element of surprise, which is fun.  However, given we weren't always able to catch their quick description of our food, it would have been nice to be given a menu at the end at least.  Many places do this.  By the way, no one can say that we didn't receive good service because we didn't bring the kitchen their expected gift. We brought an offering of a medley of microbrew beers. 5) I will say they did have a great playlist of music playing in the background and it's BYOB which is always nice  Overall, with all the hype surrounding this place, I expected more. I expected to be wowed and I wasn't.   I was wowed when I went to L2O, Moto, Alinea, Tru, Next, Catbird Seat (Nashville), El Celler de Can Roca (Barcelona), and Akelarre (San Sebastian).  At Schwa, I was not.   Let me put it this way, if you are looking for amazing prix fixe in Chicago, first check out some the places I just listed first, and then if you are bored one day and willing to make +100 phone calls, bring a drink for the kitchen staff, and have a couple hundred dollars to spare, then check out Schwa. PS - They apparently don't give reservations to odd number parties (3, 5, 7).  I asked for a friend while there and was quickly corrected that, ""we only seat groups of 2, 4, and 6.""",0.9922,0.808,0.121,0.071,0.5151549508692365

I was traveling to Chi-Town for 1 NIGHT and eating here with my cousin was my only goal for 2013.  If you've ever tried calling their phone number, you know how impossible of a mission this is.  I had 2 months, so I programmed their number in my phone and called EVERY DAY ALL DAY with no luck. Finally, the day before my flight left, the owner answered. I almost died. Proceeded with a bit of back and forth and eventually secured a 9:30pm ressy. I was also advised to bring ""at least a bottle per person"" with me. AMAZING.  To say the night was an adventure is an understatement. We literally put all eating preferences and opinions aside and told our awesome waiters that we were up for everything. This place is unlike anything you will ever experience in the foodie world. I've been to French Laundry and can honestly say I had a better time at Schwa! After hours and hours of eating...possibly 14 total courses and 2 bottles of wine later, we were the happiest kitties ever.  The chefs were very generous with their Jameson shots, so a lot of the later courses are hard to remember.  Our night ended at 12:30am standing in front of Schwa in the FREEZING cold, while Josh (one of the waiter/chef's) hailed us a cab.  Lets see, the highlights were the Quail Egg Ravioli, fish course, and all the desserts. I was blown away with how good sweetbreads and bone marrow ended up being, too.

I love the concept of high-end food in a very casual setting. It's in my neighborhood, so we walked there, and it all made me feel very comfortable. I didn't feel like I had to dress up. But I guess I didn't get to have the full-on cool experience that others had. We brought a bottle of Jameson as many people had told us to do, but the chef we gave it to seemed to just scoff at it. We didn't get hugs like some people talked about or even have much in the way of conversations with them... they seemed disinterested in us. Maybe we were not cool enough. As for the food, it was very interesting, and I liked basically everything, but I don't think it was amazing. The quail egg ravioli was, of course, delicious. But many courses seemed a little disjointed -- there was no real theme running throughout -- no continuity of styles or flavors or regions or ingredients -- and many of them seemed a bit oversalted or oversweet, depending on the dish. The best dish I had was the fish (I forget which kind) in a citrus sauce with olive oil cake. Also, the dinner took so long -- three and a half hours -- that I felt *hungry* still by the end, because we were eating these tiny bites every 20 minutes. I was filled up with wine, not food.

2013-03-09,5.0,"I had the opportunity to dine at Schwa on 2/2/2013.  I had a really good friend coming to town from Baltimore who had lived in Chicago for several years prior and was really excited about checking this place out after reading the reviews.  She was really surprised that we even got reservations (I believe she took the advice of some of the Yelp reviews and called around 11am).  I on the other hand really wasn't that interested in going but her excitement got me there.  And then the BEST dining experience in my life began the moment we opened that old screen door to the restaurant.  I was expecting something completely different.  As we walked in some old school hip hop was playing, dark colored walls and a very minimalist decor.  We were immediately greeted by one of the servers who directed us to any open table we wanted.  Of course, I could go on and on about the food.  It was incredibly unique and as each course was delivered (we had 9!) we blown away once again.  I have to say that besides the fact that the food was amazing, I enjoyed the hospitality that we received by the crew.  I mean the entire crew because they work as a team and service all tables together.  Every time they approached our table with a course they had the biggest smile on their faces and gave us great descriptions of each item.  It was like they were doing it for the first time and not as if they repeated this every night several times which we all know they do.  I was sitting so I could see the window in the kitchen.  I had fun just watching them preparing the dishes, laughing with each other and moving around to the music.  In order to use the restroom, you have to walk through the kitchen, which is odd but also adds to the uniqueness of the experience.  I believe our dining experience was about 3 hours.  It didn't seem like we were there that long at all because we were having so much fun.  At the end of the night, I walked back to the kitchen to thank the crew because they were so amazing and I enjoyed every moment of the night.  I asked them if they would all be in a picture with us so we could remember this great night.  They all did it without hesitation, but first we had to take a photo with the dishwasher, which we quickly agreed too!  I would definitely post the photo if I figure out how I can.  Schwa is BYOB, which is also a great aspect of the restaurant.  I hope to someday return and have another Schwa experience!  Thank you to the crew that serviced us that night!  Another great reason why the hospitality is such a great industry to be a part of!",0.9989,0.776,0.215,0.009,0.4694791666666667

I don't typically go out for dinner to places that are a dining ""experience"" - that's not to say I don't want to ENJOY my dining experiences but I don't really seek them out! In any even, a friend emailed and said she has a reservation for three at Schwa. Another friend and I jumped on the chance! A Thursday night dinner with two good friends AND it's BYOB! Count me in. I didn't know anything Schwa or the food or the experience. So naturally I started googling. And then I got scared. What do you mean it's a tiny place where the chefs bring out your food and there is no wait staff? What do you mean we should bring the chefs a bottle of Jameson?! What do you mean they never answer the phone and it can take years to get a reservation?  We were the first to arrive and were immediately greeted and seated. I loved the laid back atmosphere, I loved the music and I loved every single one of the guys that came out to bring us our food! We went with the 9-course menu - it's was $115/pp. At the end of the day I think we counted and ended with something like 14 courses? I wish that they gave you something at the end that told you everything you ate because we honestly couldn't remember. I can tell you that I loved the quail egg ravioli shooter, really liked the thai soup, loved the tagliatelle, actually, really loved MOST of the plates they brought out. I gave it 4 stars because we didn't love all of the plates and I feel that for the price and the anticipation everything should be amazing...and for me, it wasn't. Also, our reservations were at 6 and we were done with all of our courses by 7:30! So we felt a little rushed and weren't sure why our meal was so short.

Hands down, this was the most enjoyable dining experience I've ever had.  I was more than apprehensive coming in, I did not know what to expect or how the service would be.  Those concerns were alleviated as soon as we stepped in the door, the staff were honestly the friendliest people I have ever come across during a dining experience.  I have never met a group of people so in love with their craft and so driven to make the customer happy.  Their passion came through in the food and service.  Everything we ate really opened our eyes, they pushed the barriers of dining and I wasn't even sure what I was tasting half the time (I won't even bother describing what I ate because I'm not really sure about most of it.  The sunburst marinated tomato and the ravioli were two of the standouts though).  But I was constantly asking the chef questions and he was so happy to explain the process and thought behind each dish.  We went for the larger meal (9 courses I think), but they kept rolling out food after we were suppose to be done, by the time we left  we were completely over indulged in culinary genius. If you can get in, please go, just know what you are walking into.  This isn't some stuffy, white table cloth place with valet parking and strict dress code.  Its a nondescript storefront, with ATCQ blasting and organized chaos going on in the kitchen.  Go in with an open mind, plenty of booze (for you and the kitchen) and an unpretentious attitude and I promise you will have one of the finest dining experiences of your life.",0.9125,0.898,0.073,0.029,0.4844086021505376

No. But it was possibly the most memorable.  You simply can't prepare yourself for the atmosphere. Read all the Yelp reviews you want -- it still won't prepare you for the insanity that awaits inside Schwa. We arrived for our 9pm reservation and were ushered into the kitchen since our table wasn't ready. We weren't mad -- we were all restaurant people, and understand that waiting 10-15 minutes isn't a big deal, esp when you have waited months to get a reservation.  If you do a late seating like we did, expect the staff to be loose. Don't get me wrong, the food was mostly on point. But it's clear that everyone had been drinking for hours. Which is fine, since you'll be intoxicated, too, if you have brought enough to sustain you for 9+ courses.  These guys love what they do and it shows. It was hands-down the most unique dining experience I've ever had and there were numerous close-your-eyes-bites. I'm not sure I totally understood the arc of the meal -- many of the early courses were sweet and rich,almost dessert-like-- but I didn't really mind. It's innovative and you can taste the passion.

2012-10-24,1.0,"THE EMPEROR HAS NO CLOTHES we had dinner at schwa last night.  It was not too difficult to get a res, called for a few weeks (as i had expected) and got a reservation.  my wife and i stopped for a cocktail at a pub on north and ashland just before dinner but did not bring any for the dinner.  did not want to drive buzzed, maybe that was our mistake. i just can not believe all these reviews on yelp.  have any of you eaten a truly good dinner before?   we enjoyed watching michael and his team cook and serve the food, and we enjoyed the music plain (Atmosphere), and they did and adequate job of timing the courses but the food was not good.  we had the 11 course menu and wound up getting 14 courses from the kitchen.   while we were TERRIBLY disappointed with the meal we had a fun night none the less, it was amusing trying to engage the person serving our food while they avoid eye contact and run back to the kitchen, as if they knew just how fake their food is. my real issue is yelp.  folks:  this food is not good.  maybe michael and his crew are burnt out, tired, it would make sense considering they were drinking plenty of jameson while they cooked.  but this guy is not jim morrison.  he's not a lovable suffering artist who can throw down night after night.  that takes discipline.  michael, if you're reading this (i doubt you are) i'm sure you  believe that your menu makes sense to you, but that's where it ends.   yelpers:  the emperor has no clothes.  it's ok, i said it.  i dont think i caught him on an off night because while i was choking on the smoke that was hovering around the dining room (from our lobster with pea puree and rambutan) the table next to us was giggling with delight.  while i was gagging and forcing down the halibut with cocoa nibs and curried apricot puree, the couple behind me was amazed at how it all makes sense.  it reminded me of being in the MCA and looking at the ""piece"" that was a stack of used cardboard boxed and scratching my head while everyone around me was marveling at the brilliance of it.  you could say i didn't get it, but the purpose of putting flavors together at the most basic level is to have some balance and harmony, not to sit in my mouth and wish i hadn't put it in there. i hope michael can step away from the restaurant for a while and get his life in order, being and addict is a full time job by itself. his food is brave, without a doubt, but mostly it was just bad.   good luck schwa.",0.9914,0.745,0.163,0.093,0.5024891774891775

2012-10-18,5.0,"If you're lucky enough to score a reservation at Schwa, prepare yourself not merely for dinner, but rather for an unparalleled dining experience. Upon entering Schwa, which seats about 23, the rest of the clientele sized up our party of four, curious about who else was able to nab a reservation for that evening.  Schwa is not for the faint of heart.  The music is loud, the atmosphere is raucous, and that's exactly what you're there for.  Michael Carlson (don't call him Chef) is relentless in his innovation with each dish.  He and his staff are able to combine flavors and ingredients in ways that you've never imagined.  Dishes like Salmon with Pink Lemonade and Candied Grapefruit or his famous Pad Thai with Jellyfish Noodles are just two examples of the glorious (and seemingly endless) bounty of food that Michael and fellow kitchen crew-mate Brian delivered to our table. Schwa is BYOB, so make sure you bring an assortment of beverages as you never know what magical dishes will land on your table.  Tip from the pros: Bring something for the kitchen staff.  You can't go wrong with Jameson, and you're likely to end up sharing shots with Michael Carlson and the staff anyway, so it's a solid investment. Throughout the night you'll meet most of the kitchen staff as they all work together to prepare, course, and deliver your dishes.  By the end of your meal you'll feel at home at Schwa, hanging out with the staff who are best described as the coolest people you don't know; however you'll never be made to feel ignorant or like an outsider.  Roll with the experience and you'll soon be on the ride of your culinary life. My favorite thing about our unforgettable night at Schwa is that it truly was an ""experience,"" in that the music, the lighting, the attitude of the staff, and the food all worked together seamlessly.  Never have I believed that a chef cared more about the happiness of the guest than at Schwa.  I told Michael Carlson last night and I'll tell you now, I don't know where I'm eating dinner tomorrow but wherever it is I'll be thinking about Schwa.",0.9937,0.846,0.135,0.02,0.6051440329218107

2012-09-14,4.0,"My second meal at Schwa was unfortunately a bit of a letdown. No drama in terms of cancellations or what not and the food was still very good - but was overly tame of an experience. Part of the allure of Schwa is having some drama and an out of the box experience. Chef Carlson tonight never left the kitchen area and other than some racy lyrics on the soundtrack, the experience tonight was very PG-13. Just days earlier Chef Carlson had been arrested for launching fireworks in back of the restaurant, so perhaps he was in a somber mood because of this incident; whatever the case he did not appear to be himself.  It was nice that the menu had significant changes from my last meal there this past winter (only about a third of the dishes were the same), but the ambiance was just meh. Chef Carlson's brother has left Schwa for Next and the servers we had tonight were friendly enough, but it was not the traditional Schwa experience - it seemed rather sterile. Apparently Chef Achatz was in house the night before, but tonight they were not even at capacity and was not anywhere near the high energy experience I received several months ago. As Chef Carlson is so incredibly talented I probably will return in 2013, but tonight's toned down Schwa experience was disappointing. My first dinner at Schwa I will always remember (and still is one of the top ten dinners I have ever had), but after a lackluster encore I have to drop my rating to four stars. When at the top of it's game Schwa is among the very best restaurants in Chicago, but the issue here is consistency; too often Schwa fails to live up to it's potential. Hopefully Schwa will be able to commence delivering a more consistent product during the coming year, but without losing it's racy, edgy ambiance.",0.9429,0.826,0.107,0.067,0.42598915989159897

Started with a great amuse of chocolate covered cherry in a sweet cocktail of cherry. The texture was like nothing I've ever tasted (between explosive and creamy)! That was paired with a soda made of flowers! Truly 5-star and innovative.  What I like about Schwa is that fact the chefs bring out your food! So, you could always ask questions and get a definite answer. The chefs also brought us gifts of booze and food not on the ""menu.""  The second dish was soup in a petri dish! But this was no simple soup! It was Chef Carlson's version of a Thai soup made with kappa and iota carrageenan to create a smooth gel texture that rivals anything I've had at Alinea or Moto in Chicago. The tiny mushrooms made this dish truly cosmic! There was so many little details that I wished I would not have been on my 4th libation of the night!  Chef kept bringing out food and drinks and chatting! The crew at Schwa is small and very knowledgeable!  The horchata and rice krispy treats = Awesome The roe with lavender air = Epic  The salmon  The squab  The pork belly The turmeric ice cream ... Too many drinks to recall! I will say that these dishes all were so complex yet so good and easy to eat that I'm speechless!  Then came the Chefs signature = quail ravioli with black truffle (Note: seems like fresh  black truffles where in every dish) This dish was full flavored and memorable  as one of the best things I've ever tasted in my life!

I've been here three times and had the same experience almost every time.  Perfect.  I love that there's no winelist (bring your own, prepare to share).  I love the music (most enjoyable when you see people in suits looking around confused because they came for a 5-star without reading the fineprint).  I love the food (dude trained in Italy, worked with and for some awesome names, and knows his shit).  I love the chef. My first dinner here, back in 2008, had me seated with my back to the room.  He was at a table behind and to my left explaining the dishes he'd just set down to the couple.  As with most of us Italian-types, he talks a lot with his hands.  I heard a clink and then a crash as a glass shattered against the back of my chair.  He'd accidently slapped it off the table while talking.  I whipped around and he looks at me, says ""Fuck, did I do that?  Sorry."" and goes back into the kitchen to have a guy come clean the glass and see if I was cool.  When he came out a few minutes later with our next course, he apologized again, but it was unnecessary considering how perfect an environment that makes. You'll have random, sometimes angry music.  You'll have great items (maybe including the poached quail egg raviolo with truffle butter - fuck yes!).  You'll taste some random wines (because he'll pour every bottle around every table unless you ask him not to, which would be lame of you). The price is solid at just over $100 per person.  Bring a little something as a gift for the kitchen and it'll be appreciated.  I usually bring some WI beers.  On one of our visits he did an extra course with a foam from a New Glarus Fat Squirrel.  The man has talent and a personality.  I'll take this over a Trotter dinner any time.",0.97,0.803,0.128,0.069,0.4907387831806437

With that said, we showed up at the restaurant half-expecting to not be able to get in. Fortunately we got in and had an outstanding meal!  A friend suggested we bring a bottle of Maker's Mark as a gift so we did, it appeared to be appreciated but who knows? Our waiter was a nice guy named Jacob, and he was a lot of fun. When he laughs, he sounds EXACTLY like Seth Rogen. :) We went with the 9 course tasting menu (but you can see they gave out a few extra) and here are our half-ass notes on each course: 1. Manhattan chocolate cherry (amuse) 2. Pig face cassoulet with crunchy duck skin  3. Potato soup with bacon emulsion crispy potato chive emulsion (this was the ""Ode to Wendy's salad bar"" course) 4  Ravioli w brown butter sauce with quail egg.

Tagliatelle with celery root black truffle Awkward!  Two dudes from Peoria  walked in without reservations and tried to fast talk their way into a table. Jacob politely said that the restaurant could not accommodate them tonight. 6. ""Fruit loops"" Key lime fritter. Papaya glee 7. Salmon. Black truffle grapefruit. Brioche.  8. Turmeric ice cream in a spoon. Mustard caramel.  9. Halibut apricot purée. Cocoa nibs. Candied kumquats.  More awkwardness. The two Peoria dudes came back again, but this time they brought a bottle of booze with them as a bribe to get a table. It didn't work.  10. Quail with bourbon. Popcorn bubbles.

I got several reasons why he could not make the reservations even when he picked up the phone, that they were busy, or didn't have the ""book"" and that I should call back later, man. When I saw the bare bones operations at the restaurant later I understood.  We showed up on time for our 5:30 reservation and the host/waiter/ front of the house seemed very surprised we were there. The whole place smelled like they had just been smoking pot. The restaurant is dark and the decor is fairly minimal, clearly the place is only about the food.  I can't remember everything we ate, but the octopus, ""biscuits and gravy"" dish with sweetbreads, quail egg pasta were amazing. They made a corn soup that tasted like the most delicious elotes I've ever had. The portion sizes were actually large for a tasting menu, and the composed plates were beautiful to look at. My main complaint about the food is that almost every dish tended to very rich and a little too sweet. My wife is a pescetarian, and they were nice enough to accommodate her dietary restrictions.  There's only one waiter in there, who is very nice but is constantly hustling to serve the food. He told us about every dish, but spoke so fast half of the time we had no idea what he said. They were also playing mid-school hip hop so loudly I could barely hear my wife across the table. Go to Schwa. It's definitely a very different dining experience, and I think well worth the effort it takes to go.",0.9923,0.819,0.147,0.034,0.4921001221001223
2012-05-31,5.0,"The secret's always been out about Schwa - amazing food, amazing experience and impossible to get into. Among other things. The real *secret* about Schwa is something you can't really put your finger on, at least I can't at least. It probably has a lot to do with the set up of the kitchen, its staff and ambiance. With a host, waiter, head chef, sous chef, other cooks and more all working together - with Jameson - on all the jobs in the restaurant, visible to the 20 or so guests in the house, the energy and ""we're all in this together"" feel is amazing. We ordered the 9-course tasting menu, obviously. In looking back throughout the meal, losing track of the courses, we came up with more like 11 or 12 or 13 courses if you include the cherry-covered-chocolate-in-whiskey amouse bouche and the coriander and basil (and something else) soda course.  On to the food. The key highlights for us were the ""baked potato"" soup that ""pays homage to the baked potato bars of the 1980's at Wendy's"" w/ emulsified scallion and bacon to match the puffed pork belly; the quail egg ravioli with aged Parmesan and brown butter;  the pheasant and whiskey ingredients; salmon sous-vide; and pig head with brioche bread emulsion all stood out. Add the coconut crusted foie gras on apricot 'jam' and you've got most of your major food groups covered. And then some. At three hours plus for service and conversation, we were woefully under-prepared BYOB-wise, bringing *only* a bomber of Sofie and a bottle of Cabernet. So, in reading between the lines on that sentence, let this be a warning: dinner at Schwa is over three hours long and you're going to want to have a stockpile of beverages to get you through the night. For us, luckily, we made nice with the staff early and they offered up a couple of beers from their private stock to carry us over and to make sure we ""kept up"" with them. The *secret* about Schwa isn't exactly a secret, but a part of me feels like if I went into more detail about the vibe or the food I'd somehow be taking away from it. Bottom line, Schwa's flavors and fun are game changers in what gourmet food is all about. White table cloths and Michael Jackson on the speakers? Yes.",0.9682,0.911,0.075,0.013,0.5733506944444445

I don't want to say too much to ensure the surprise factor for future diners, but the food was EXCELLENT, service was great (the chefs serve you - so they really know about the dish), and the atmosphere is anything but stuffy. They welcoming you into the kitchen anytime - and it's pretty much unavoidable since you have to walk through the kitchen to get to the bathroom (and after 2+ bottles of wine, you will make at least one trip back there). They even invited us back into the kitchen to take Jamison shots with them. They ended up serving us around 12 courses - all delicious. Not only was the presentation there, but the taste was as well. And it's SUPER reasonably priced considering you are eating the food prepared by a world-renowned chef. My husband was completely enamored with this place (which is rare for him)- as was I.

The chefs take their work very seriously but don't take themselves seriously.  -Reminds me of Seattle, low key, grunge, hipster -Good value for the price. You don't walk away thinking what did I eat? I'm still hungry! Dislikes: -For 9 courses we only really loved 2 of them: duck cassoulet and the wendy's potato bar.  -While the flavor profiles were nice there was always one element that was overpowering. Something was either way too rich or too sweet. I think I ate a ball of butter in the one of the courses. -There was neither enough depth in the flavors or a good juxtaposition between textures. While, the courses were very creative, they were still 1 dimensional and I think that is more due to one element overpowering the whole dish. Conclusion: There's a lot of really good restaurants in Chicago that are easier to get in and in my opinion, taste better.",0.9911,0.713,0.236,0.051,0.6254166666666666

2012-04-21,5.0,"Yes, it is ALLOHDAT and more!!!!  Unbelievable restaurant, unpretentious and yet chic in its own ways.  After being cancelled on, oohhhh, twice we finally made it there last weekend.  We couldn't be happier of course and it def exceeded our expectations.  Note: must bring six-pack for the guys, they like it, they give you extra stuff, they are nice to you.  The atmosphere is very casual and it's a very small place maybe with 9-10 tables.  The music is blaring LOUD, very loud, but it is still possible to make conversation - they played Rap music when we were there.  There is a small window to the kitchen, so you can see the culinary genius, Michael Carlson (looks like a biker) and the rest of the staff.   They change the menu seasonally I think.  But overall it's just very creative, amazing combinations of flavors and just very well thought out.  The quail egg ravioli thingy was the best, the Wendy's inspired soup was awesome, pretty much everything rocked...the dessert was the coolest part too...it involved dr.pepper which I haven't had since mmm high school i think.  The service is nonexistent, but they're nice guys, really, just busy in the kitchen, etc. (no servers/wait staff, the cooks themselves serve you).  This place is byob and they charge something like $2.50 per person corkage fee, which totally beats $12 cocktails at regular restaurants!  I know, I know, you say, how do I actually GET a reservation there?  Well, you gotta call at the right time.  I called at 5:28 pm the first time, then I called at 11:22am the second time and both times they picked up obviously, but before this I had an alarm going on my phone to call Schwa every day around 5pm and around 1 am before they closed.  So yes it can be tricky and yes you will most likely get canceled on but boooya, it's soooo worth it!  Plenty of parking on the streets but if you choose to take the El all the better - 5 minute walk from the Blue line stop!",0.9964,0.782,0.189,0.029,0.5313496759650607
2012-04-21,5.0,"This review has been a long time coming. Maybe because it's taken this long to get over the hangover of Schwa. The dinner was back in December and it was the most memorable meal I have had in a very long time. First and foremost, you know what you're getting yourself into when you try to snag a table at Schwa and when you're dining there. Presumably, you've done research (Yelp, food blogs, internet), you've read and heard the stories of Chef Michael Carlson, and you know they do things on their own terms. So why all the 1-2 star reviews whining about reservations cancelled several hours before the scheduled time, about why it's so difficult to get a person on the phone to get a reservation, about why the music is so loud while you're dining? To those I say, you should have done your homework before even booking at Schwa. Your results are your own fault. Now back to your regularly scheduled review. From the outside it looks like a deserted building. No welcoming lights illuminating. Graffiti on the building. Windows shuttered. You almost question yourself before peeling back the black outer door to reveal another door leading to the restaurant. Upon entering, music is blaring and Seth immediately comes and asks if we have reservations. I say we do and hand him a 6 pack of beer for the kitchen crew. We also brought along a bottle of  red wine to drink along with our meal. Now onto the courses: Amuse: Cherry covered chocolate sitting in a Red Hook cocktail 1st Course: Peekytoe crab, guava, asparagus, pink peppercorns 2nd Course: Baked potato soup, potato skins, bacon, cheddar, sour cream Additional Course: Chef Carlson's signature quail egg yolk raviolo, brown butter-truffle oil sauce, parmigiano reggiano shaving 3rd Course: Tortelloni, crab apple, celery, shaved black truffle 4th Course: Steelhead roe, passionfruit, violet 5th Course: Salmon, grapefruit, pink lemonade Additional Course: Turmeric root ice cream w/ mustard caramel Additional Course: Seared scallop, cocoa nibs, brioche, curry, apricot 6th Course: Rabbit, strawberry, bread pudding, honey 7th Course: Lamb, blueberry, cashew, mushroom Cheese Course: Pretzel gougere filled with Chimay cheese, Chimay beer foam, mustard ""skin"" Additional Course: Gooseberry covered in white chocolate nestled in lavender foam Dessert Course: ""Dr. Pepper and whiskey on a plate"", Dr. Pepper gummy, whiskey ice cream, vanilla bubbles, paired with a glass of Dr. Pepper As you can see the $110 9-course meal can easily turn into more with the kitchen's generosity. There also were free glasses of Malbec given to us just because. Every course was original, amazing, playful, whimsical, and all fun. You have to be open-minded when dining at Schwa. When dining at Schwa you don't feel like you're in a restaurant but you're invited into Chef Carlson's home where he and his crew are cooking AND serving the food. Everyone is having a good time and enjoying the atmosphere. That's how it was and it was the most unique and laid back dining experiences I've ever had.

2012-04-11,5.0,"Knock knock knock.  No answer.  Looks up at the storefront sign: SCHWA.  Looks above the door: 1466.  Is this not the fkin door?  Then I tapped on what we thought was just a black painted wall.  It jiggled.  We proceeded to peel open the camouflaged wall and behind it, revealed a door - this time w/a glass window and a doorknob.  Oh.  Chicago 1, San Francisco, 0.   Vinny greeted us w/a flirtatious, comedic charm and unpretentious attitude. Bass thumped thru the walls and vibrated under my feet.  That's how loud it was. I recognized the music right off the bat.  It was Atmosphere.  Holy sht, I thought.  What have I just entered?  Chi-town 2, SF 0.  Straight ahead I see the window to the kitchen.  Chef Carlson & crew waved and yelled hi to us.  That's when I knew this nite wasn't going to be just about food.   Schwa is BYOB.  No wine program here. Just water. Vinny asked what we brought to drink.  We told him we were still recovering from our drunken nite prior, and thought we'd skip liquor for the nite.  Vinny says, ""You know, that's not how we roll at Schwa"".  He comes back out and pops open a new bottle of wine, liberally fills our glassware.  He looks at me sternly, then says - ""drink.""  Yes Sir, right to it.  For the duration of the nite, he made sure our wine glasses were never empty.  Bears 3, Niners 0. We each chose the 9 course tasting menu for $110.  By the end of the nite, the generous kitchen had easily turned it into a 14 course meal.  Each plate had its own story, some w/directions on how to eat it, but all had the same demise: licked clean.  Their ""Roe course"", aka ""Fruit Loops"", did in fact smell exactly like the cereal.  Their quail egg ravioli, to be taken as a shot and consumed in one fell swoop was the richest, butter-iest bite I've ever had.  If it were up to me, I could've had a whole bowl of them for the remainder of the dinner, but then I'm sure the gates would've welcomed me that nite and I'm just not ready for that quite yet.  There was also a dessert served w/a glass of Dr. Pepper.  While explaining the dish, Vinny told us it calls for Jameson whiskey in the sauce, to which I responded, ""My favorite whiskey.""  ""It is?"" He says. ""BRB"".  He comes back with 2 shot glasses and a bottle of Jamo.  Shots first.  Then dessert.  The Bulls 4, The Warriors 0. Remember how I said this nite wasn't going to be just about food?  It wasn't.  My favorite Digable Planets album played overhead in its entirety, that when combined w/my company, the ambiance, and the Schwa crew, it transported me back to a feeling of being at an early 90's house party but minus the Dominos Pizza and illegal drinking. It was like a garage party vibe but w/the best fkin food prepared under the direction of the infamous culinary artist, Chef Michael Carlson.  Because of all this, Schwa easily turned into my favorite dining experience to date.  For the past few years I've been intrigued by Chef Carlson for what I've ""heard"" or read about him.  I could say now, that my fascination is an understatement.  Here's why: People have called him a recluse, inarticulate, and off-putting. I spent some time chatting w/him in the kitchen, and I think he's just misunderstood.  To me, he's an every homie. If you're not on his level, then you're not. He's just doing what he loves to do, cook.  Simply put, he's about his art, not the dollar. He's such a perfectionist about his craft that he could care less about the business end of it- (which in turn produces all those livid 1-star reviews of canceled reservations), by choosing to live paycheck to paycheck w/every intent to reject fame & prosperity. If u get to experience his cooking, you're lucky. And if you tried but couldn't, you're right to blame it on his lack of business skills. But he won't change for no one. He's a game changer because in the world of restaurateurs, he doesn't play the game. There is no reservationist, no host/hostesses, or waiters. The cooks bring out the food. Chef Carlson fills your water glasses. He plays hip-hop loud and said about 99% of his guests complain- but the music is intended to please the cooks, not the customers. Well, at least my ears were pleased that nite.  So if you plan on dining here, keep an open mind. It's Michelin starred, but minus the synchronized waitstaff service. You might hate the music. There's 1 bathroom.  It's BYOB.  But the food is mind-blowing.  He hosted an anniversary dinner in this tiny joint for a gathering of the best chefs in the world, and they all left delighted.  If they left w/a happy belly, so will you. Making our way outta the restaurant, Chef Carlson was filling water glasses for a table nearby.  We waved, yelled goodbye & thanks to him and the cooks.  He turned, waved, and yelled ""Love you"".  We love you too, Chef.

We decided to bring a bottle of wine that we had been saving for a special occasion (Heitz Martha's Vineyard Cabernet) and also picked up two fairly expensive bottles of white wine from Binnys on the way.  We got there at about 8:45 and were seated right away.  The server/chefs were super nice and cool and we started to get really excited. Ended up being a let down with both my wife and I feeling pretty sick for the next 24 hours.  The menu looked amazing but things were brought out completely out of order.  The progression of food made no sense and we got different courses all together from the tables around us.  There were long periods (20-30 minutes) where there was no food anywhere.  Carlson (the chef) was funny but he was wasted and ended up leaving at about 11pm.  We were there until 12:30. There was no ""substantive"" savory part of the meal.  The courses actually got progressively worse throughout the night like the chefs were getting more drunk and taking less care.  They kept ""adding"" courses but when you have to wait 30 minutes for a single bite course it gets a bit frustrating. Probably the worst part was the music.  Now, the first time we were there they had the music and it was great.  As I recall it was actually in the kitchen and not blaring in the main dining room.  For us, we couldn't speak to eachother, couldnt hear the chefs describe the food and couldnt think.  We both left with pounding headaches.  Keep in mind, we go to our fair share of bars/clubs so its not that we cant stand music...but 3.5 hours of absurdly (and unnecessarily) loud music is just not pleasant when you are trying to have a nice dinner. The food was good, it was unique and creative and I appreciate that.  But by the 4th course, my wife and I just wanted to leave because we had massive headaches.  I should say the table next to us actually left and skipped their final three courses.  They were there when we arrived and who knows, probably were in the 5:30 pm seating - they left at about 10pm. Sad to say it but I dont think I would go back to Schwa.  They have done an incredible job of building up this absurd mysterious reputation for themselves but the quality of the food and service just simply isnt worth spending 300+ dollars and 3.5 hours of my life there.  Unfortunate because like I said - about 4 years ago it was one of the best meals (food AND experience) I have ever had.",0.9634,0.797,0.122,0.081,0.5838376856118791

2012-01-20,1.0,"I just got back to my hotel following dinner at schwa. My ears are ringing. They're ringing loud and nonstop. My voice is raspy from having to shout to be heard during dinner. 80% of what the food runners said to describe a particular dish couldn't be deciphered above the roar of their music. Talk about high stress dining.... 3 hours of deafening music, helter skelter service, and quite frankly, surroundings befitting a bomb shelter. Further, the music makes no sense. It's blaring for the benefit of the line cooks yet it's directed toward the customers.  I'm not sure if there is much truth to their reservation inadequacies. I called the restaurant this afternoon. The phone was answered promptly by a pleasant young lady. I asked about a reservation for the same evening and she asked if I preferred 6, 6:30 or, 8:30. I selected 8:30 and that was that. The host and busboy for our meal was the head cook's brother. A very nice guy. Wired pretty tight, but nice all the same You can read a dozen other reviews for details on the succession of courses. A few of them were very good. A few of them were forgettable. All of them are miniscule. Too many of them have some sort of foam or dried out sauce streaked across the dish. One of the foams actually tasted like soap suds. That which stood out, on each of the 2 or 3 times it occurred, was when something was served that offered some substance. Something to actually bite and chew, rather than just slurp and swallow. Most of their food is baby food soft. When something finally comes along that has some body, sadly, it's just a bite in size. Even their lamb, for example, was served in miniature. 4 slices, maybe 1/8"" thick and smaller than 1"" x 3/4"".  BYO. No soft drinks offered. No bread offered. No coffee or tea offered.  Overall- I have to give Schwa 1 star- based on the simple truth that I would never return. Not even as somebody's guest. Life's too short.",0.7306,0.862,0.075,0.063,0.4542151675485008

The angular distance of a planet or satellite from its last perihelion or perigee. Prior to coming here, I expected to be let down -- I had started to over-hype it to myself and every time I do this, nothing ever lives up to expectations.   After eating there, I can honestly say that it lived up to every expectation and then some.   Something that I barely see mentioned in the write-ups on Schwa, and something that I don't think many people know is that they spend something like 70-80% of the money the restaurant takes in on the food itself.  That being said they lose their ass quite a bit to put bad-ass food on the table for all you newbs, so respect.  At the end of the night, when you are ""tipping"" -- you are making up food costs probably.  They don't expect that...but keep it in mind if you are one of those ""So I have been to Alinea and I have been to Schwa...""people. Highlights of my meal (besides the amazing service):  *A Salmon  with Pink Lemonade - This salmon is crazy -- it's like a chicken-salmon.  As if a chicken and salmon got together, listened to some Barry White and out came this dish.  Meaty, and just so tender at the same time.  I will FOREVER DREAM OF THIS.  *One Bite Quail Egg Ravioli.  Which, if I am not mistaken -- is a raviolo.  Anyway, no one makes anything like this...and it' is a staple.  * Apple Tortellini?    *Chocolate -covered cherry, or wait I am sorry -- ""We had a chocolate covered cherry and we said ""f*ck that.""  *Potato Bar Soup. Holy s*it , potato crisp.  *A crab salad that reminded me of Fishermans Wharf on a cold, March day, but that was way better than Fisherman's Wharf crab salad could ever be.  *Roe -  Deep fried roe, violet foam and a passion fruit gelee.  Explained as ""Fruit Loops"".    *Basil infused homemade soda.  *Mustard ice cream?

2011-10-26,5.0,"I ate at Schwa. A three-and-a-half hour, nine-course (plus some) dinner. It was nuts. A giant fist of deliciousness punched me in the throat last night. I feel battered and pummeled and satisfied. I sit here, post-Schwa, trying to reflect on my thoughts. Here's what I came up with -- a poignant Fry-from-Futurama Internet meme:  i.imgur.com/s0dSo.jpg By the time ""Prayer to God"" by Shellac was blaring over the sound system with a repetitive and screaming chorus of ""Kill him, fucking kill him!"", I already knew I was in a special place. Chef Michael Carlson had earlier turned down the music just long enough to ask us all by show of hands if we understood that, by eating at Schwa, we had signed our souls over to the devil. ***** A little work is required to eat here. It took me a while to get through to make reservations. When I finally did get a reservation, it was postponed -- the restaurant called to say that there would be no service that night. I was disappointed. A few weeks later, when I showed up for the delayed dinner, they remembered that they had cancelled on us and were profusely apologetic. They then spent the evening making it up to us and then some. I want to start writing about the food, but I don't want to spoil the experience for you if you've never been. I'll try to go spoiler-free, but the listing on the menu doesn't even to begin to reflect what you end up with. The highlight for me was described on the menu as, ""roe: passionfruit, violet"". What came out was a tart and tasty cup of gelatinous smoked roe with a passion fruit concoction. It was paired with a small key lime fritter that tasted -- in the best way -- like it came off a food truck at the state fair. All brought together with a delicate and delicious violet foam. Complex is an understatement. Tart, creamy, bitter, smoky, sweet... The chef who brought the food out to us (that's right, the chefs present you with the food right from the kitchen) explained the dish's inspiration and ingredients, and left us to enjoy. Later, he answered questions about the dish and communicated his passion for its creation. I could easily write such a paragraph on any of the courses, but I'll spare you the spoilers and save the room. Other highlights included a baked potato bar inspired soup (emulsified bacon! pureed scallions!), a quail egg ravioli (rich rich rich, a glob of creamy/salty/buttery heaven), a just-barely-cooked salmon plate (somehow fresh, bitter, tart, and sweet all at the same time), and a Dr. Pepper + Whiskey inspired dessert, which I consider the weirdest and best dessert I've ever had. ***** Writing about the food really isn't enough. The service here is crazy. It is a bit of a mystery to me how they keep track of the multiple simultaneous services -- they pay personal attention to each customer (I got a nickname) and take time to explain the food and answer questions. I love that the chefs refill your water and grab you beers. How unpretentious! They miraculously manage a spectacular service while somehow finding the time to also cook the food. Throw in a healthy dose of screwing around. Seriously, the chefs are apparently having the time of their lives. It's so clear that they love Schwa and are proud of the restaurant and the creations that they serve. They shunt away nearly all the stereotypes and preconceptions regarding fine dining and it is a relaxing relief. At first it is a little intimidating, but it is rare that I have felt so comfortable at a restaurant. I wish all restaurants were like Schwa. It's a costly experience, but the price is way more than fair for what you get. So back to the Fry meme ( i.imgur.com/s0dSo.jpg ): I honestly don't know if it's all theatre. I suspect, with 99% confidence that they are sincere -- sincere mad geniuses, yes. And even if they aren't, their passion for the food is 100% sincere. That is more than clear from the taste. The chefs at Schwa respect the ingredients and they respect the customer. I will not hesitate to go back and my tasting at Schwa will surely remain among my favorite dining experiences of all time. Five stars. I'd give it six if I could because I've given five stars to restaurants that don't even come close to Schwa. ***** PRO TIP: When there's a dish on a dish, check under the dish on the dish.

2011-10-23,5.0,"I spoke too soon. I'm a hypocrite. I take it all back. The months of calling every day, the cancellations, the showing up for our reservation only to find a closed restaurant... they were all worth it.  After showing up to a shuttered restaurant I told myself I was done with Schwa. But the next Tuesday I got the urge to call again. Miraculously they picked up on my first attempt, profusely apologized for standing me up, and gave me a booking for the next Saturday. They called Friday (got my vmail) and again Saturday to confirm, apologized again when they seated us upon our arrival.  When you walk in the front door here you know you're in for an experience. It is a casual and mind-blowing experience. There are 24 seats tops which is your first clue as to why it's so tough to score a table. Music blasts. The chefs and host rotate bringing and describing dishes. And every dish is like nothing you've ever had before.  To dine here and opt for the three-course meal over the nine-course is to do a great injustice to yourself. Unlike, say L20, you can enjoy all nine courses (plus one or two extras that the chefs' fancy) and leave feeling quite comfortable and not stuffed.  With the first bite of the ""aperitif"" amuse I knew I was in for an exceptional meal. I won't try to rattle off every course in detail because I'll get it wrong. There were delightful accents like violet foam, bull's blood, mustard skin, house cured ham. And there were masterpieces like: quail egg ravioli with burre blanc and shaved white truffle; a fruit loop of key lime fritter with passion fruit jello. Seemingly at random they'd reward us with extra courses of original and pallet-expanding single-bites: turmeric ice cream with caramel, a gooseberry with some sort of nectar from the gods.  The protein courses were amazing. They were dainty, appropriately portioned, and perfectly conceived. Sliced lamb with mushrooms (foraged by hand), blueberries and cashew puree that combined for a series of exquisite bites. Incredible rabbit served with rabbit rillette.  Look, the point is that the food here is more original and delicious than nearly anything I've ever had. The setting is far superior to any other place period. It's casual, fun, and real. The chefs, incredible talents, are your best friends for the evening and far too genuinely pleased to receive your compliments.  So if you're tired of getting the full voice mail or you feel spurned by their cancellations, I'll gladly tell you to give it up. With 24 seats lucky enough to eat here a night, I'd prefer not to compete with you for one of them in the future.

Me:  I will come in whatever day or time you tell me Carlson:  Come in right now Me:  Definitely, on my way.   After celebrating, contacting the rest of my party and making a well orchestrated alcohol run I arrived to enjoy the fruits of my labors. Before I go in any further, it must be noted that I knew (and looked forward) to the unconventional experience chronicled by many I know who dined at Schwa.  I understood and respected the ""I don't give a crap about anything but the food"" attitude.  My expectations were not out of whack or damaged because they wouldn't pick up my phone calls.   Over the next four hours we had eleven courses of which only one was truly great and unique (the often spoken about quail egg ravioli).  Everything else was decent, but a pair of dishes were really close in flavor (The chef used the same overwhelming parmesan). The other really good two dishes were the least creative and unmemorable.  The Hamachi was just plain bad, but forgivable.   If everything else was a neutral, I would be describing Schwa to people as I do a 3-star movie, ""It was fun, but not gonna make you forget 'The Godfather'"".  Unfortunately everything else was not a neutral.  The host, who told us to just let him know when we wanted him to bring out our next bottle of wine at the beginning of the night, seem to get offended when we asked him for our next bottle and staged some sort of protest by not coming over to our table for 30 minutes (This was the sort of thing I kind of expected and shrugged off).   After a couple more dishes, the same thing happened.  The host, who was now visibly wasted -  stumbling over the description and spilling water on the table every time he went to fill a cup, told me that he had not been serving us wine because he wanted to space it out and we were on our last bottle (We had finished four and had three left for a table of six).   While his drunken drug references throughout the meal had been mildly amusing, things took a turn for the worse when he came to our table and oddly asked if anyone had ""found anything on the floor in the bathroom.""  When one of my fellow diners joked that he had seen a clear plastic bag on the ground in there (He did not actually find anything of course, just going along with the drug related humor present throughout the night), the host had a meltdown.  This is when the night truly became unforgettable. He began yelling at the table, claiming that we were thieves and saying that we owed him $200 for his misplaced drugs.  After running into the kitchen, seeming to recount his delusion of what had just occurred he was obviously told by the other chefs not to return to our table.  Though noble, the gesture failed to restrain him as he came out frequently to give us the finger and convey threats of what was ""waiting for us outside"" when his ""homies got wind of what we had done"" and that he was going to ""mess us up"" Our table figured this was some sort of elaborate prank that was going a bit too far. ""The renowned chef's brother, isn't going to threaten our in the middle of the dining room, right?""   At this point, we attempted to pay the bill when the chef came out, thanked us for the bottle of whiskey that we had presented them with when we arrived and asked us to please stay (He could hardly walk and was slurring his words).   We sat through the next 3 courses like you sit through a dinner at a couple's house that has had a screaming match right in front of you.

Anyways, overall we loved the experience (chefs bring out your dishes) and the overall creativity.

A few months out from a trip to Chicago, I read a couple of restaurant reviews and was intrigued by how hard reservations at Schwa were to come by. I kept calling for two days straight and got no calls. The next morning around 12:30 Chicago time, I called and finally somebody picked up the phone. I told them when I would be in town and if I could get a reservation for one person. The person on the other line said 5:30 on the 21st of April and the rest is history...... Finally after waiting for two months, the night had arrived and I was ready.. Before I arrived at the restaurant I made sure to get a couple bottles of beer and off I went. I arrived at 5:30 and to my surprise I was the only one there for 30-45 minutes. The hostess came and asked about any restrictions and also if I wanted a few extra courses. Obviously I had no problem with that. I won't go into detail of every single dish because there is not enough room to write, but I will go over some of the dishes that I will never forget. Potato Bar Soup- Inspired by the potato bars at weddings, this soup consisted of baked potato, fried potato skins, scallion puree? some bacon crumble and stretchy cheese on the side of the plate. Yes as amazing as it sounds. Chicken Liver Risotto- Risotto of chicken liver with a fruity gelee on top. This was insanely rich and decadent and was easily one of the greatest things I have ever consumed. Quail egg raviolo- Quail egg inside pasta with truffle butter. Pretty self explanatory and fucking delicious. Eaten in one bite, an explosion of flavor. Roe- Deep fried roe, violet foam and a passionfruit gelee- They told me to eat it all at once and it would taste like fruit loops. I tried it and they were right except it tasted ten times better. Just an amazing dish. Simply mindblowing. Butterscotch Braised pork belly- came with mango puree and was just brilliant.  'SMORES""- braised short rib in a chocolate mole sauce with graham cracker and marshmallow. Probably the greatest thing I have ever had. Such a weird combo that worked perfectly. Lift up the glass and there was an essence of campfire. Just insanity. Overall Schwa blew my mind. I loved the music they blasted in the dining room i.e. atmosphere and sage francis and I loved the fact that I could wear whatever I want and drink whatever I want while still experiencing some of the best food ever and unpretentious service.

It's simple, this is the best meal I think I have ever had. And Schwa had a lot to overcome. Long story...be warned. So a friend of mine went here and told us it was the best meal they ever had. I considered myself in the know on food and felt lost when I had never even heard of the place. I then did some research and learned all about the famous dinner that caused them to close and their subsequent reopening and apparently impossible reservation system. So my wife and I's anniversary was in October. We decide to try and go here. I give a call in mid-September and to my surprise get someone on the phone right away. I get the date and time I want and I'm thinking ""This isn't so bad"" The day before my reservation I get a call just confirming my reservation. I'm feeling pumped. The day arrives, my wife and I are ready to head over and at 4pm I get a call. One of the chefs is sick. They can't run if they're not at full staff. They apologize and say to mention this cancellation if/when we want to come back. Ok. Nothing I can do about this but it definitely didn't make me feel too happy. My wife's birthday is in February so we decide to try again then. I call back in January, get the voicemail, and this time leave a message mentioning the cancellation. I get a call back about a week later and I get a reservation. Day before we get the call about the confirmation, but I'm still nervous (actually had a backup reservation at another restaurant). By 3pm on the day of I haven't heard anything so I call to cancel the backup and then at 4pm I get a call saying their fridge is broken. This time they offer to schedule something right away, so we get a reservation for a week later. The day comes and this time no cancellations and we're actually going to eat! So, as you can imagine, there was a lot to live up to. And they did. I think there are enough reviews here about the food, decor, staff that I would just be adding to the line of compliments. Let me just say every single dish I had there was outstanding. There was nothing I would not eat again.

2011-03-30,5.0,"Schwa might not be for everyone, but it should be! I went to Schwa with my husband for a Tuesday 5:30pm seating for my Golden Birthday and it was phenomenal.   Reservations: I didn't experience any of the difficulties other readers have. Seemed fairly straightforward. We asked for wine recommendations on what to bring to this blissfully BYOB bistro, and we weren't given a toonnnn of guidance. I guess they assume people know their wine. Per the recommendations of the wonderful Yelp community, we brought some extra booze for the boys in the back. Environment: The dark, stark space is entered through a pretty shabby exterior. While it lacked a certain warmth of similar small spaces, it was comfortable enough. We were the ONLY (literally) people in the 25-seat spot. Later, a table of four and two came in (but the service stayed at the perfect level of attentiveness). I didn't mind the loud rap music for sure, but I could see how that might turn some people off. I recall LOLing with my husband when, during a pause in the waiter's explanation of a dish, rap lyrics chimed in all-to-clearly referring very explicitly to certain unmentionable coital acts. Awkkkwarrddd.  Vibe: The place and the staff are so far on the opposite end of the spectrum of the fancy-shmancy, often intimidating fine dining scene, that it kind of circles back around to being intimidating again because it's just sooooooo hip and laid back. I felt a little bit like I wasn't quite cool enough to be there, but the staff was very friendly! I didn't feel like I was being judged when I wanted to start with our champagne right away (hey, it was my birthday!) and if I do say so myself, the champagne went perfectly with the first two courses! Service/Staff: The service was spot on for the ambiance. We really liked speaking to our server/host who had a completely unapologetic laid-back stoner/skater vibe. The drinks were poured frequently, and several times the chefs came out to share a shot with us, explain a dish or check to see how we were doing.  THE FOOD: So this is why you're here. I felt like I was being treated to a private meal from one of the world's best chefs. Very special! The menu was different than what they had listed on their website and was $5 more per person as well (big whoop).  All of the dishes were inventive and purely pleasant-everything was amazing, but I'll try to pick out a couple of unforgettable standouts. None of the dishes were too ""challenging"" (i.e. ""icky-tasting"" to the non-sophisticate like myself) to the palate (like some things I've had at similar places like Moto or Green Zebra). The Chef straddled the sweet/savory line perfectly throughout the meal. The dishes defied classification as any kind of ethnic cuisine, but there were certainly a number of influences present throughout (German, Norwegian?, Mexican, japanese, Italian etc.)  We ended up with about 12 courses in all, once they threw in a couple of surprises (seriously, don't neglect the booze bribe!) The portions were just about perfect, and I almost made it to the end, but the ultra-rich beef mole S'more got the better of me in the 10th-ish course. My husband finished it off for me. I left super full but not over-stuffed. The procession of the courses was great and pretty well-timed, likely albeit a bit speedy on account of our being the only ones there.  The most magical dish was the often referenced off-menu Quail Egg Ravioli. It was heavenly. Simply not to be missed.  God's gift to food, the Pork Belly, was prepared at it's best, with a butterscotch sauce (which I was afraid would be too sweet/cloying) was just perfect. I'm pretty sure my last meal would be Quail Egg Raviolis and Pork Belly.  A surprise stand-out was the Octopus appetizer. Paired with pineapple chips, a bit of proscuitto and balsamic and macadamia sauces, was a perfect, bright, tasty kick-off to the meal.  Also, of note: my husband, not a dessert fan, loooovved the Celery Pie dessert (fun!). I guess I was looking to finish off with something a little more tart/less heavy, but he absolutely devoured his (and most of mine).  No excuses - this is a must-go for anyone who likes fine food: obscenely reasonably priced, BYOB, ridiculously good food, friendly service, intimate atmosphere. Experience some really special food from a truly gifted chef.  We'll be back!!!!!",0.9996,0.748,0.227,0.025,0.5490468008509245

We had reservations for Saturday night, and they called 2 hours prior to cancel on us!  My fiancé had already decanted wine worth more than $100.  It was our last bottle from our trip to Portland OR wine country.

2011-03-27,4.0,"So much fun! I've been to many of the top restaurants in Chicago, but this one was one of the best experiences! It's a little bit unorthodox but that's what makes it so good. The dining room is small, there are only a few tables, and you are served by the chef's. They blast rock music from the kitchen as they bring out dishes of some of the best food around. You really get a chance to get into the spirit of things as you banter with the chef's and enjoy your BYOB drinks. Don't forget to bring enough to share! Update: Went back for a second visit. Shouldn't have! I had such a fabulous time the first time that this second visit totally ruined it. Went earlier in the night with a bigger group and the intimacy just wasn't there.

2011-03-26,5.0,"Schwa, in many ways, is the quintessential Chicago fine dining experience.  Fresh, rough around the edges, loud, and, yet, absolute genius. Our experience at Schwa wasn't without its issues but for an overall experience - you really can't beat this place. As everyone mentions, we had our issues with getting a reservation, but it eventually happened and that was that. Now, onto the important stuff.  As you walk into a nondescript storefront on Ashland you walk into a singular square room with dim lighting and booming rap (Wu Tang) and a golden hue. Clean, neat table arrangements - I counted 26 chairs total. The furniture is sleek and sturdy - it seems they spent a lot more money on furniture than they did on room decor. Big unavoidable glass window in the back lets you see the chefs as the size up what to prepare next.  We were greeted by a hipster-looking guy in skate shoes - I think this is Carlson's brother. He takes care of our wine, is funny, and very laid back. The 'waiter' here is almost singly handling the entire room (about 18 people) and does it without skipping a beat: water and wine always filled, new cutlery brought out for each course, new glasses for each new bottle of wine. He gives you the feeling that he'd rather be doing something other than managing the tables, but he does an excellent job overall and looks like he enjoys himself at work. Other than him there was, of course, Chef Carlson - big bearded, fila shirt wearing, quiet but friendly. Lastly there was a bald guy - tall, muscular, and mean-mugging but also nice enough.  In short order after seating and getting our drinks started - the food train begins. Bringing out plates was the elaborate process - all three staff members come out, food is placed very neatly, and a short, succinct description of what we're about to eat comes out. The pace and spacing of the meal is ideal - never so fast as to keep your from enjoying your meal and never so slow that you get bored. The courses:  1. 'cherry covered chocolate' - short and sweet, the warm alcohol burn complements the sweet, rich tastes and gets things started well. 2. octopus, pancetta, microbasil, balsamic vinegar, and macadamia - clean and flavorful. Acidic tastes and fragrant smells.  3. baked potato soup with scallions and bacon - rich and savory - my 3rd favorite course 4. Surprise course - Quail egg ravioli, brown butter, truffle - INCREDIBLE - as good and rich as everyone says. Fat tastes really good.  5. Roe in many forms - passionfruit gelee with roe, some kind of roe-paste, and some fried roe/shrimp thing. - I loved the passionfruit taste with the roe and the contrasting textures but overall this wasn't the most impressive course.  6. Chicken livers, risotto, pomegranate sauce - the raw, gamey, iron-y taste of the chicken liver was off-putting for most of us although the risotto was perfect and went well with the pomegranate. 7. Scallops - outstanding but unfortunately overshadowed by the next. 8. Pork (belly?) - absolutely incredible course!! perfectly cooked and so so savory - beautiful caramel and orange colors - tasted as good as it looked and was the best course of the night. 9. 'Smores"" - beef shortrib, graham cracker, something creamy: this was the most creative course of the night. Its presented as a cup on top of a cup. The upper one contains the ingredients while the lower one is filled with 'campfire' smoke. You lift the upper cup and release the smoke from the lower one. This was also an amazing course and the beef was the right combo of savory and sweet. Genius! 10. Cheese course - a small bite - tasted like some ricotta inside some bread. A nice palate cleanser of sorts. 11. Dessert - celery for dessert! I have no idea what the actual forms of celery that comprised this dessert but there was definitely a fried plantain and something that resembled a panna cotta. I loved this dessert with very clean flavors and not overly sweet.  We left this place in a daze - having had one of the best meals of our lives. Anyone that lives in this city needs to try to make it to schwa at some point to experience this thing because it may not be there for too long. Honestly, I don't see how these guys make money considering the types of ingredients they use and the high level of effort needed to prepare most of these things. Nonetheless, it's an incredible experience and a must-have for any fine dining enthusiast.  Advice: 1) don't use your phone unless absolutely necessary - it brings some unhappy faces  2) bring plenty of stuff to drink because the meal lasts a long time. 3) Also bring something for the guys in the back to enjoy - I brought some beer for the chefs and they appreciated it.  4)Lastly, just enjoy yourself! This place isn't pretentious, stuffy, and is absolutely informal. If you want to know more about something or how its made the guys like to explain it - Carlson himself goes into great detail about how a course is made if you just make the effort to ask!",0.9997,0.756,0.22,0.023,0.559514821461724

I was so angry and disappointed!  Obviously, a 30th birthday is a big deal.  I had been so excited about celebrating my big day at Schwa.  We had even bought them 2 big bottles of special Three Floyds beer (from the brewery)! They didn't even offer to make it up to me or even give me a reason for the cancellation.  They just left me the same number that everyone else calls if I wanted to reschedule.  So, obviously when I try to call the number back, I get their voicemail saying that their mailbox is full.   Yeah, thanks.  I will not be rescheduling.  I have been telling everyone about this horrible customer service.  I'm sure the food is amazing, but I do not need to waste my time with this place when they treat their customers like this.  Jerks!",0.889,0.78,0.147,0.074,0.4623851294903926
2011-03-24,5.0,"Want high-end dining with that's also BYOB?  I've found it.  It's called Schwa and I loved it.  Really a great dining experience that everyone should experience at least once.  Yes it's hard to get a res but well worth it - and lucky for us a friend did all the work to secure it. Pricy too at over $100 per person but the BYOB is a big savings overall.  Have to say that i wasn't blown away with all courses but when you have 12 courses and most of them are amazing - that's 5 starts to me.  (yes, we had 12 courses - had several that we just added as we went along). And I think that this idea that fine dinning is not a filling was debunked today by the way.  Everyone in our group was satisfied and full!  No cheeseburger on the way home for us. So I've broken down each course that we had but note that it was paired with some really fine white and red wines that our friend Sonya Park especially picked out for the menu (and brought for us...thanks Sonya).  So the descriptions here don't exactly tell the full story - but take my word, it was incredible.  And Michael (Chef/owner of the place) and team did a great job make sure that we enjoyed the food and that our glasses were full all night.  Really can tell that we was influenced from his time at Trio with Grant Achatz (of Alinea fame).  And if the descriptions start getting fuzzy towards the end - well let's just say that the great wine assortment might of had something to do with it. Amuse.  Chocolate cherry in manhatton shot Second. Beautiful pineapple chip dish that i can't exactly tell what it is. But had chocolate so who cares.  Third. Baked potato soup.  Just an ok dish. Kind of a deconstructed baked potato.  Although i appreciate the home made cheese. Perfect. Fourth course. Extra course.  Pane-cotta soup in one bite with black truffle. A bit salty at the end and almost too much actually. However, best so far. Fifth course.  Liver risotto with cheese and shaved truffles and jelle.   Combo of Jelle, risotto, and cheese is best so far. Amazing! Six. Fruit loops? Salty and sweet dish with a deep fried nugget looking food that tasted like fruit loops cereal with roe. Flavor seems a little random.  Least appealing course of the night. Roe was pretty good though. Seventh. Seared scallops and pumpernickel. Scallops cooked perfectly. Cones with a pumpernickel shot. Very good. Eight. Pork belly with ridicio. Wow. Best dish so far. Combo of BBQ pork with earthyness of greens and sweetness of fruit.  Is there more food? Ninth. Extra course. A number of different dried veggies and meats. Pork ridnes. In two ways. Dry then wet.  Sweet then savory. Came on top of another glass that was smoking.  Damn good but the smoke was a bit much after a while. Tenth. Beef with mole sause.  One of the best dishes. But have to say, not completely unexpected. Eleventh. Pastry with cheese. Salty balls?!?!   Just an OK dish. Twelfth. White chocolate something. Can't really remember at this point other than thinking ""best sweet dish of the night"". End.  Pass out.   Enjoy.",0.9996,0.703,0.279,0.018,0.5165527065527066

Anyone can get things right once. I went back a second time the other week with a group of four and it blew my mind. Even better than the first time. Ridiculous. The weakest course was the drink that was the first course. Maybe trying to set the bar low? Anyway, everything after that was perfect.  The music is loud. Typically rap. The service is good, though quite informal. So maybe it's not right for some crowds. However, for those of us that don't do pretention but like a damn good meal. Schwa fits that hole.  One of our party was pregnant. A few courses, she couldn't eat the standard dishes. What they whipped up for her might have even been better than what the rest of us got. And they were completely and utterly wonderful about the whole process. My only complaint is the difficulty in getting them to call you back to get a reservation. It took four months.

While I kinda changed the legendary Nigel Tuffnel's words, oh do they ever apply here. While expectations were high, they were completely blown away and yes, the meal did go to 11. Now, to back things up a slight bit, I have been wanting to go here for well over two years. It almost seemed like this place was a myth, el dorado, shangri-la, but no, its quite real and its really awesome. A few friends and I had been talking about trying to get a reservation here and one of my friends manned up and got us a 5:30 reservation on a friday. Thus with that action, the anticipation grew and the days came closer. I'm gonna be honest, I didn't sleep well the night before, and was hungover going into this, but how quick one comes to their sense when utter genius is presented in front of them. We were greeted in there right away by Seth, who is Michael Carlson's brother. After conferring  with us on the reservation, I made sure to hand him the growler of beer from Revolution so as we could set our night off well. To top things off, after our entire group arrived we were greeted with a shot of bloody mary. Now this is where the real fun began, ie the food came. I was absolutely dizzy from the amount of ingredients on the plates, so I can't go down the full 9 course menu. But, I will note the highlights. The first dish was an arctic char and octopus dish with some mousse and dark sauce that i wasn't able to remember. I normally don't like octopus or squid because of the chewiness of them, this was quite different and was much more savory. The arctic char was cooked perfectly and I was just having fun mixing the combinations on the plate.  The apple pie dish  still haunts me right now as I think of the great cheese crust that lie on top of the candied apples and the cinnamon-apple soup along with it that was a wonder unto itself. But, not to be outdone was the ravioli dish. It was a one bit dish which consisted of a cream with black truffles on the inside as well. It was a purely surreal experience. You could taste the truffle for a while and the ravioli just seemed to melt on your tongue. This was pretty much an indescribable experience. On top of the dishes being utterly amazing they were a sight to behold. This was honestly gastronomic alchemy and it was worth the wait and then some",0.998,0.792,0.186,0.023,0.5529176114890401

2010-12-20,5.0,"Rule 1: Do not rate restaurants at which you've never eaten. You have no insight, and your review skews the curve and messes things up for the rest of us.  It is hard to get a reservation at Schwa. Or at least so I've heard. I got an answer and a seat the first time I called. Guess I'm just lucky.  I could describe this restaurant in great detail (it is the most unique fine dining restaurant at which I've ever eaten), but this article from GQ will do a far better job describing it. Check it out it's a great read. gq.com/food-travel/alan-… My dinner at Schwa was the best meal of my life. I went alone on a whim. Just me, a book and 2 bottles of wine. Highlights of the meal were the Chicken liver pate with tamarind crust, peanut brittle, mustard greens and root beer consommé,  and the dessert of candied sweetbreads. Both are unlike anything you've ever tasted, and both are transcendent. Another very strong entry was a course of a single ravioli stuffed with a truffle infused egg yolk. Encouraged to eat it all in one bite, it was a molten explosion of truffle flavor that was somehow more intensely truffle-y than truffles. That I still remember these courses in such detail is a testament to the quality as it has been almost 2 years since my meal at Schwa, and I remember it more vividly than my dinner at Daniel last Tuesday.  The place is BYO, which defies all logic and reason. It also rocks. The chefs will take your wine into the back and serve you throughout the meal not only your own wine, but ""donations"" that other customers have left behind. I can just see them back there listening to Van Halen, drinking peoples booze to figure out what is going to go best with what. It has this really informal communal feel to it that is really fun and special.  So go to Schwa. Or at least try to. And if at first you don't succeed, try some more. And if you get frustrated and want to quit, don't. It would truly be your loss.",0.9836,0.834,0.117,0.05,0.5172883597883596

To back up, yeah, I'm one of those assholes who got a res on the first try.  My friend was telling me about Schwa, which I had never heard of, and could hardly believe his claims of how hard it was to get a res.  I had to see this for myself.  The phone rings...rings...rings...""Hello?"".  My mind races: HOLY...WHAT DO I DOOOO?  I quickly browse my computer calendar for a free Friday, they say yes, and we're off.

That means she doesn't like it!"" to josh her.

2010-11-14,5.0,"Overly long review in blog - definitely worth reading - dish highlights below. With the soundtrack blasting Busta Rhymes our first course arrived - ""Octopus - Pineapple, Macadamia Nut, Char.""  Featuring supple slow boiled octopus that lacked any semblance of chewy/rubberiness cascaded across the plate atop smears of burnt pineapple and macadamia nut puree the flavor of the cephalopod was nicely complimented by the sweet and nutty admixtures.  Adding complexity and texture would be thinly sliced pan seared arctic char, shaved nori, baked yucca chips, and micro greens while dots of aged Sherry vinegar lent a savory finish. It was with course three that the soundtrack switched from Rap to Metal, loud and heavy either way, and more patrons began arriving...as a matter of fact, the restaurant went from empty to full almost immediately at 7:45pm and we chuckled as a few patrons were turned away despite bringing boozy gifts for the kitchen.  With service slowing only slightly the next plate was one of Carlson's more famous options - ""Tagliatelle - veal heart, huckleberries, honey.""  Featuring a spiral of hand cut pasta snaking up the edge of the bowl and topped with chopped veal heart, whole huckleberries, Tellagio cheese, honeyed  veal demiglaze, shaved black truffles, and arugula this course once again showed off Carlson's fondness for sweetened proteins.  Tender and al dente the pasta itself was beautiful but the star of the show was undoubtedly the manner in which the sweet gravy enhanced the savory offal.  This course and its follow-up were the only courses where I truly wished there was bread service at Schwa as I would have loved to sop up every drop of the sauce. Our next course would be offered as a ""bonus.""  As much a signature as anything at Schwa, Carlson's famous Quail Egg Yolk Ravioli with Buffalo ricotta, brown butter, white truffle, and Chive was every bit as good as the rumors.  Likely influenced by his time at Trio with Achatz (who was then perfecting Black Truffle Explosion) the Ravioli was served solo and we were instructed to let it cool a moment and then eat it in a single bite.  Bursting in the mouth and potentially the only dish of the evening lacking substantial sweetness I'm going to go out on a limb and say I enjoyed this even more than Achatz's fabled dish - the texture of the molten egg yolk was simply one of the best mouth-feels I can imagine and the brown butter/white truffle combination was divine on the palate. Course six would be another familiar face on the Schwa menu - ""Biscuits and Gravy - Sweetbreads, Red Eye Gravy, Mustard.""  Described as a tribute to Michael's southern grandmother the dish featured three plump and crispy sweetbreads with characteristic creamy centers juxtaposed with three tiny buttermilk biscuits from his grandmother's recipe.  A lovely start, the plate was next supplemented with bitter braised mustard greens, fibrous Chinese black beans, ground pink peppercorns, micro-arugula, miniature pearl onions, and coffee spiked redeye gravy.  With each flavor playing a part in the entirely southern feeling dish I have to admit I was a bit taken aback by the spiciness of the gravy - it was appropriate for the dish, but required nearly a whole glass of water on my admittedly un-southern tongue. Our main course, arriving during a particularly loud and profanity laden track by Nas, would be one of Carlson's more recent creations - a dish detailed as ""S'mores - beef mole, graham, marshmallow, campfire.""  Having to walk through the kitchen to get to the restroom I'd seen this course being prepped earlier in the meal - or at seen Carlson taking the Wagyu from the sous vide bag and shredding it.  Featuring Wagyu short ribs in a cocoa nib mole that literally melted on the tongue, the dish was topped with crumbled graham crackers, a creamy graham cracker puree, and black cardamom marshmallow all placed in a cone.  With the cone resting in a smoking vessel we were instructed to lift the cone and eat with a spoon while the campfire smoke poured forth. A bizarre restaurant and experience in all ways it is really hard to sum up what Schwa ""is"" in the grand scheme of restaurants when looking back on it.  The best comparison I can offer up is the one I assumed going in - Momofuku Ko.  Obscure reservation system, off beat location, ""come as you are"" dress code, blaring music, and obscure ingredient pairings that somehow work.  With that said, the bar stools, snooty attitude, excessive price tag, and NO pictures policy at Ko speaks to a restaurant that doesn't care what you think - they believe it is a privilege to experience their vision.  On the contrary, quoting Michael Carlson himself, ""We cook food we want to eat in an environment we want to eat it in"" and ""Our game plan is the same game plan as every night. We're making 30 people happy.""  On November 5th 2010 Schwa made me very happy and it was absolutely worth the effort.",0.9977,0.857,0.119,0.025,0.5009523809523808

If you're lucky, you'll get a call back a few days before the date that you picked to let you know that you're reservation is confirmed. If you're not lucky...well...I don't know what you do, because we got lucky!  The vibe at Schwa is dimly lit and very romantical. The staff was welcoming, funny, and very casual. It was almost like we went to a friend's house for dinner...a friend that can cook like a bad mo-fo!  Our amuse started the meal off on a high note. I was told it was a bloody mary, but my quizzical brain did not compute. There's no tomato juice. It's a shot glass of something. Is it vodka? Carolynne M. told me to shut up and drink it, so I did. It was like pickle juice and very dill flavored. I bet it was pickle juice and the chefs at Schwa were playing a practical joke on everyone...""bet we can get them to drink pickle juice!""  The first two courses did not thrill me. There was an octopus with pineapple, macadamia nuts and char and then elotes, but not quite like the elotes that I get from the Mexican guy on the corner with the food card. I liked the corn, popcorn, lime concoction of the elotes but it was accompanied by a little cup cotija, which seemed like melted butter and we were instructed to drink. Ugh! It was not great.  The 9-course meal got off to a rocky start, but between the 2rd and the 3rd course we were offered an ""extra course"" in the form of a ravioli in browned butter sauce. Oh my! Things started picking up from there with tagliatelle made with veal heart, huckleberries and honey (tasted like beef stroganoff); roe in a watermelon flavored jello (??) which was ok...not really my taste; halibut with anchovy, black garlic and zucchini; and biscuits and gravy, made with spicy sweetbreads, red eye gravy, mustard, and tiny little biscuits.  At this point, every dish that was brought out was better than the next and more creative. The 7th dish was called ""somores"", which was a play on campfire somores...but instead of chocolate we were served a glass cone filled with beef mole topped with graham cracker crumbs and marshmallow. This combination sounded so gross on paper, but it was a delicious comforting wanna-lick-the-cone course. The glass cone was resting inside of a little glass bowl that was filled with campfire smoke. Campfire smoke!! How the hell...?? It was amazing.  As if all these things weren't already blowing my mind, the cheese course arrived. I don't recall what it was, but I popped it in my mouth and then I saw Jesus. There are no words to describe how good this was. Even the word ""awesome"" just doesn't seem awesome enough. Mind.blowing.good.  To tell you the truth, I don't even remember what was served for dessert. At this point, we were a table of four that was already finishing up our fifth bottle of wine. Yeah...you can do that math because my head still hurts.  Dining at Schwa is an experience. You have to go through the kitchen to get to the bathroom, which offers a nice peek at what it's like to be a chef.

Where else can you eat a beef mole s'more with a campfire aroma while listening to jacked up hip hop in a BYOB space more fit for a large family than a restaurant? We did the 9 course, which ended up being 11 excluding the amuse (though they substituted the sweetbreads for a veal tongue dish) and they didn't miss with a single plate. The elotes and the smores dish were the favorites and the quail ravioli lived up to the hype. What Michael and his kitchen manage to do with these alternative ingredients is magnificent. After having done the Tour menu and wine pairing at Alinea this past spring, I wouldn't hesitate to say that the inventiveness and sheer quality of the dishes at Schwa compete. The only difference is I can wear a t-shirt and jeans and feel completely comfortable.  Keep up the good work, Schwa. If only others in the industry could be themselves and sacrifice hoopla for comfort while creating Michelin quality dishes I would be a happier, albeit fatter, person.",0.9772,0.831,0.144,0.025,0.5283928571428572

This is a place for foodies to enjoy someone who colors outside of the line.    The ambience is little and so is the space. Rockin' music expletive ridden, only goes to highlight the cross directional attitude of the food. I went by myself because I knew if I took my partner, he would be in his own food hell here.  I did the 9 course which became 11 with additions from the kitchen.  What worked for me was the:  The greeting, first names. I felt special before I sat down. Clarified Bloody - Amuse that was just that amusing and delicious. Octopus Poke - a real taste of Hawaii with taro and pineapple chips are more. It was as pretty as delicious. Elote - a take on local street food with popcorn. A total hit out of the park! And I am a corn snob, from Maryland land of silver queen.       Halibut - amazing. Biscuits and Gravy - fantastic!  Dessert. - incredible. Who would have thunk. Beyond description, lets just say never would have thought celery could work in dessert. Almost worked  Taglaitelle - It was great but soo many ingredients, a few of them tripped over each other. Less would be more here.  S'more - perhaps the most creative with ""campfire"" won't spoil the surprise, but it would have been better without the savory mole and just done as dessert  Fell Short  Cheese  - great idea courgette, but over salted.  Hendricks sorbet - great but rose flavor completely covered the juniper. Maybe that was the idea. free addition.  Roe - This one totally missed me.   The rapid-fire verbal description of each dish.

We had the nine course dinner and it was pricey.  What you get is a dining experience that really focuses on the food.  We started with a clarified bloody mary that looked like water.  Suprising flavor that woke up my pallet.  The dishes are very unique and memorable.  If you're a fan of big portion dishes do not go here.  The dishes are small but retain a lot of flavor.  You get a detailed explanation from the chef who serves you.

2010-06-19,5.0,"Had the best dining experience of my life in Schwa last night. Besides the food being amazing, the fun of interacting with the chefs really makes for a great evening. We arrived at 7.30 and we were greeted immediately by one of the chefs. The restaurant does not have any service staff but you still get better service than any fine dining restaurant I have ever been to. I brought 3 bottles of wine, one for me and the gf, the other two for the chefs. When I gave the wine to the chefs they said 'Dude, why don't we share all the wine"". My kind of guy, my kind of place and I knew I was in for a great night. The amuse was a shot of a Bloody Mary. It wasn't like any Bloody Mary I had ever seen before. It was nearly transparent but had all the flavour of tomato, spices, pepper that you expect from a Bloody Mary. Great start. My favourite dish of the evening was the Apple pie soup. The soup tasted heavily of apples, cloves, olive oil and I would have been happy just having the soup. There was a savoury tart that had the most amazing crumble base, cheddar topping and apple filling. Amazing. I tried to eat this really slowly to make it last longer but I pretty much devoured it. I would have licked the bowl but gf was already disapproving of the way I was throwing the food and drink down my mouth. One of the benifits of bringing drink for the chefs is that they give you some hidden extra dishes. Our ""extra"" dish was a Quail egg filled Ravioli which you eat in one bite. As soon as you bite into the Ravioli, the quail egg explodes in your mouth and gives the most amazing feeling inside your mouth.   All the other dishes were just as mind blowing as the next, like the tagliatelle dish where the milk they used is from cows that are not given water during the day so that the flavour of the milk is more concentrated. The dish was covered in black truffle and veal heart. Michael Carlson came to our table a number of times to ask us how we were doing, to top up our wine and to explain the dishes to us. The other chefs were very funny but were all clearly talented. One of the chefs (I think his name was Matt) had dislocated his wrist but was still cooking/serving tables/making jokes with customers and explaining the dishes. For a group of guys who apologise so much about the service they must know that their style and service is excellant and every bit as good as the food.

2010-05-23,3.0,"Here's the skinny on a highly anticipated restaurant:  The food was good, but not great.  Four out of nine dishes were more sweet than savory, which I found rather odd.  The oyster amuse bouche shooter had a sweet froth, a crab dish too, and a tiny piece of halibut was served with a giant ""paint"" of burnt marshmallow.  There was just not enough fish for the amount of marshmallow which made this dish way off balance, not to mention the whole sweet thing again and again.  What gives?  On the other hand,  some components were way too salty to eat (this was our table of five's consensus not just mine). ***The best dish of the night was a quail egg raviolo ***We had late reservations so perhaps its best to book early to avoid any kitchen mishaps... ***You'll be disappointed if you go for the three course so do the nine, however, my meal was not worth the price but fingers crossed yours is! ***The ""experience"" at Schwa was what its all about, in my opinion.  The loud music, interactive/charming/funny chefs, and positive energy made up for the food...a little. If you haven't gone, you should go and give it a shot...maybe my night was an off night, I don't know.  Judging from said night I wouldn't return for a repeat visit, but am glad I went.  It just wasn't the ""best meal of my life"" or even the best I've had in Chicago...and I was expecting that.",0.9935,0.744,0.2,0.056,0.5264181818181819
2010-05-17,5.0,"Friday night we went to Schwa. Schwa is a small store front restaurant on Ashland just south of North Ave. From the outside it looks closed down. Upon entering you are greeted by the four chefs as the seat you at on of the 8 tables. Very small and very intimate. There is an open kitchen so you can see most of the prep taking place. The food was phenomenal. There was a choice of a three course meal but we went with the nine course digustation; it tuned out to be 10 or 11 courses.  They started us out with the amuse which was a play on the puerto rican jibaro sandwich, it was a tiny sandwich of peaky toe crab in plantain ""bread"". The sweetness of the plantain work amazingly well with the crab.  Second coarse was a beet risotto with some funky cave aged cheese. Very good.  Next was a pea soup. You get a shooter of pea soup accompanied with peas, menthol foam and black garlic. The black garlic looked like dark chocolate smeared on the plate and was incredibly tasty. Chef Michael Carlson told us that one person in the world makes this by fermenting the garlic for 60 days.  Then we were served two cauliflower tortellinis in a cocoa broth with cocoa nibs. The aroma was all coco but the flavor was wonderfully cauliflower.  Then we got his signature quail egg yolk and smoked mozzarella ravioli with aged parmigiana; unbelievably good.  Next was a round layering of polenta, shad roe, meyer lemon and coffee gelatin. Some wild flavors here which worked well together.  Next was butter poached lobster served with persimmons. Wonderfully tender.  Then we got a chicken liver pate coated with tamarind served in a beer broth. Very livery and very rich.  Then the last savory dish was a layering of duck with Brussels sprouts dusted with cocoa. The duck was the perfect balance of meat, skin and fat.  Next we got a cheese dish which was a bowl or creamy cheese served with a spoonful of honey powder. What a wonderful way to segway from savory to sweet.  The first dessert was parsnip custard, homemade peanut brittle and candied sweet breads. You need to have a serious sense of adventure to use thymus glands in a dessert.  Then the last course was a red sorbet (not sure of the flavor at this point) served on a great cone and a few drops of bacon juice over the top.  Overall it was on the greatest meals in my life. Only Charlie Trotter can match the detail and intensity of Schwa's food. Add to that the atmosphere of feeling like you were invited over to your stoner chef buddy apartment for a meal to end all meals and Schwa become the ultimate dinning experience. Carlson achieves pairing impeccable food with a casual setting by splitting his time being in the dinning room joking with his guests, spinning music, and chugging wine.  Schwa is completely in a class of it's own. Plus it is about half the price of Trotter when you consider it is BYOB. I love this place.",0.9986,0.821,0.174,0.005,0.5136805555555556

Nice Yelpers gave me the advice to bring in some alcohol for the staff, as well as for ourselves, so we brought them a nice six pack.  The experience was just what all the other five star reviews say: a one of a kind experience where you savor every flavor, and hold the food in your mouth and taste the complexity. It was great. I loved every dish, and I will probably never forget them. I also very much appreciated that they gave us an extra course of the quail egg ravioli on the house. Ahhhh. That ravioli is not overhyped. But I have to say, I would probably go into a coma if I ate more than one. They are rich! If you can afford it, go to Schwa at least once in your life. You'll never forget the experience.

One of the most memorable courses was the lamb brains with morel mushrooms.  Right when they were put at our table some death metal started playing on their in restaurant music system.  It was cathartic sitting there eating brains listening to heavy metal pulse on the sound system.  One reviewer complained about the music.  It is eclectic and different, but I thought it added rather than detracted from the experience.  Just be aware, these are just some chill dudes making you some awesome food. Having it be BYOB made it even more amazing.  We brought a few bottles of wine and beer had some left over Trotter wine (which was awesome!).  We just asked the chefs to match what they thought would go well with each course and they did an awesome job of mixing in the beer and the wine for each course. At the end of the meal they created a special dessert for my birthday.  Then the check came and it was just a single number on a piece of paper that was less than the number of people * the menu price.  They just chose a number.

It reminded me of Mugaritz with its bold and intelligent flavors and food combinations. After Carlson shut down and re-opened, I had another fantastic meal which was actually better than our meal at Alinea which we ate at the following evening.  I have eaten at Alinea at least a half-dozen times and always thought Carlson was or could be in the same league as Grant in terms of sheer cooking talent and his deep understanding of flavors.  In addition, the small atmosphere and unconventional setting at Schwa was always more to my liking than a 'big statement' restaurant. However, my last experience dining at Schwa was awful.  The food preparation and presentation was sloppy at best and most of the dishes simply did not work compared to our past dining experiences. Although there was some interesting ideas, most of the dishes were clearly not refined yet and there were large inconsistencies on the same dish between each of the 4 diners at our table. The service was beyond awful.  When we asked if one of the ingredients in one of dishes of the 9 course tasting menu could be substituted because someone in our party was allergic to it, our server laughed in our face and rudely say 'no fucking way'.   That sort of set our expectations for the rest of the evening.  It then became quite apparent that our server, a rather larger person, BO was overpowering the food.  In addition, he rarely told us what each dish was and if we dared to ask, he seemed annoyed.  Although Chef Carlson did greet me when we first walked in, he was busy serving other 'local' diners who were obviously getting extra dishes and much more personal service. The quirkiness of Schwa is one of the things I did love about the restaurant and although consistency was never a term that you would attribute to Carlson, I think the restaurant has gone down in terms of service and especially the food and we will unfortunately have to  skip it for a while until I hear if things have improved.  The good news is that there are quite a few other great places to dine when visiting the Chicago area.",0.9891,0.831,0.124,0.046,0.4605952380952383

I really wanted to try this restaurant after reading the reviews on yelp. The restaurant seemed different, relaxed and didn't seem like they went by the book (in a good way).  We got a call the day of our reservation to confirm and they told us that they were a bring your own wine restaurant. I don't drink that much so we opted not to bring anything.  When we got there it was a cozy restuarant with about 7 tables and a super friendly staff.  They saw that we didn't bring wine and asked if we drank. The server then poured my bf a glass of white wine. Seriously, so friendly and nice.  Now onto the food. We had the 3 course meal which was supplemented by a few other small courses.  All their courses came out looking lovely. Apple pie soup - super rich creamy and an interesting concept but a bit too much to have the amount they gave us. We saw how much it was given in the 9 course meal and my bf thought that would have been the perfect amount.  My beet risotto - Tasted amazing but the risotto was a little hard, That did not stop me from finishing the plate.   Crab ravioli - Was a one shot ravioli with creamy sauce. It was good.  Pork - It was a little lukewarm. Not too sure if it was supposed to be lukewarm but would have probably enjoyed it more if it was warmer. The pork itself looked more like ham, but it tasted great. The presentation was awesome.   White fish from Australia - It was a little off for me. I didn't think all the flavors meshed together well but that may be due to the fact that the fish on the menu was substituted for another fish?  Pretzel bread - tasted great. Left me wanting more.

Friends brought copious amounts of booze, wine and beer for every course, and we got sloshed.  We had a great time, and the experience was sort of hilarious, but this is food as an art event, not as sustenance. I have only rarely experienced such indigestion, and others in our party felt the same or worse later, and it wasn't just the booze. The chefs lavished us with experimental extra courses, so we ended up with over a dozen different dishes served to us, and few of those potentially hundreds of materials were meant to be conjoined in the human digestive system (or my mouth - many if-fy moments). And chefs in some cases badly needed baths - I mean, the smell overpowered the food at times. As did the blaring Norwegian black metal or gangsta rap. As I say, I had a great time, but I'm not over eager to return. I would recommend it to any adventurous eater, however. A good time, but this is not food to please you.

It's brilliant business.   You don't get a reservation here by accident; you're guaranteed to play phone tag for a few weeks, at which point you'll maybeee get a call back with their ""other"" phone number to call for your actual reservation.  And no, once you get the new phone number you can't just keep it and call back.  As disorganized as the reservations process may seem on the outside, on the inside I have a suspicion that they're onto everything.  I even imagine that at the end of the night they sit around and have a few beers while replaying the greatest hits of whiny people begging and pleading for a reservation.  Of course that's my imagination, but I hope it's like that.  This process keeps the riff raff out--you don't go on OpenTable and click a button and hope for the best, if you want to eat here, you really have to want it. And so my first experience began on my most recent birthday, after Brian patiently played phone tag for a reservation.  I've done the ""chef's tour"" thing a dozen times but this was probably my favorite execution of it. As expected, the place is small and intimate.  The decorations aren't overly lavish--you're more likely to see Ikea decor on the walls than a Warhol.  The food--and the guys that run it really--are what it's all about.  I say this is a brilliant business because really, it is.  It's a group of guys who don't answer to anyone but themselves. There's no waiter to fuck up the service.  There's no maitre d' to pay.  They are the front, they are the back, they are the business.  This place operates more like dining at a dinner party than at a fancy restaurant; there's really nothing to hide here.  The guy cooking your food is the guy who brings it to your table to explain it.  If you have a question or comment, you're already at the source.  It's as casual as you want it to be, or as grand, all at once. To me this characteristic is the pinnacle of fine dining, something very few places achieve. Course by course we were wowed with one surprise after another.  And it's not gimmicky.  It's not the ""wow there's smoke flying out of my custom-designed bowl"" wow, but a real wow in flavors and ingredients.  My favorite course was probably the cauliflower tortellini, which was served with cacao nibs and a curry sauce.  Yes cacao nibs.  An unlikely combination that months later I still can taste how good it was.  The sweet breads were candied and you may have thought you were eating popcorn (which made them 'user friendly' compared to other possible preparations), probably the best tasting sweetbreads I've ever had.   Every course we had was well thought out and tasted great, but I won't bore you with the details. We arrived with 3 bottles of too cool for school wine (Pas De Nom, two bottles of Turley), one was intended for the kitchen but somehow we didn't convey that message well and I think we drank most of it.  In the future, less wine is more.  Not only did we drink too much, but after the first bottle of really good wine it's hard to really appreciate.  And because you don't know the menu ahead of time, it's even harder to pair well, so the $100 bottle is probably better left for home enjoyment.  In this case our choices were good, but one bottle less next time for us. The real issue came when I got home and expunged my entire meal, after having drank too much.  I can't decide if this is embarrassing or brilliant, some might say this is the best of both worlds: I ate my heart out, enjoyed amazing food, and lost calories in doing so.",0.9989,0.748,0.2,0.052,0.47302176696542897
2010-02-22,5.0,"OK, as gushing review #109, I will keep this concise. Dinner here is like dinner at the home of a wildly talented and dedicated friend who is extremely type A about inducing sensory overload.  If these guys weren't busy with that whole cooking/serving the other customers thing, I would have cuffed them to the table and had them tell me every single detail and history of each of the dishes we had.  The amount of care that went into each course was inspiring. OK, gushing out of the way.  The other relevant info:  (1) BYOB and a low tasting menu price (comparatively) make this the only ""best in chicago"" restaurant yet that I would go to again.  (2) If you are a twenty-something like me who occasionally feels a twinge of discomfort in superfancy places (like when Tru matched my napkin to my outfit, say), you will not feel any of that here. (3) I didn't make this reservation, so I didn't have to deal with reservation-pain.  I understand some frustration, but if you live in Chicago, just call in and hope for the best - it's worth it.",0.9688,0.806,0.158,0.036,0.5344642857142857
2010-02-17,5.0,"Been thinking of how to put this review all together...bear with me if I ramble. I am a neophyte FFF (fine food fan), but I'll tell you what, I DESPISE getting killed for wine/booze on a restaurant bill. The markups are ridiculous. I understand that this is generally how restaurants make their nut, but there has to be a line in the sand that declares, ""We are in the FOOD business."" Schwa runs with the ball and more here. (Eh, I'll get back to it. Anyway...) Location and Space - Schwa is across from this monolithic tire store that looks like it was transplanted from Miami to Ashland Avenue. It looks like Dexter Morgan was buying Cubano sandwiches there. There's all kind of talk that Schwa is hard to find, so trust me... just look across the street from this garish display and you can't miss it. The place has 24 seats spaced well, with music bumpin'/pumpin' from 2 speakers left and right. Music was nice, different and quite groovy - a mix of techno, rap, hip-hop, etc. and surprisingly non-intrusive. The room is low-lit, but well lit. The washroom is accessed through the kitchen, so can you get a peek at the chefs' workspace. The very first thing I noticed was one of the cooks making a huge pot of oatmeal with a HUGE wooden spoon. I thought that was very amusing. My lovely date said they have wicked juniper soap and hand cream in the WC.  Reservations - We grabbed a reservation for Feb. 13th. The reservation system? We had no problem with it. Frankly, the phone call back is a nice surprise, and we also received a call the day before to confirm. Just casual, laid back, and A-OK by us. Other Yelpers have had slightly different experiences but ours went without a hitch.  BYOB - Sat down and met one of our chefs/waiters/busboys, and they took our drinks into the back. (Sorry it took a bit to get back to the booze comments.). We brought a good Riesling, great champagne and a 4 pack of Trappist ale. We were ready, I guess. If you ask for their wine and beer recommendations, they'll basically just encourage you to bring whatever you enjoy and they'll pair it with their creations as best they can. No stems or flutes here - everything is served out of sturdy tumblers. Remember, they are in the FOOD business. When we asked about wine glasses, our chef/waiter joked, ""If we had them, we'd just break them."" You are free to bring your own, but we kind of enjoyed doing it the Schwa way. Chefs/waiters/busboys - Now if you read/knew about this facet of Schwa, you might wonder, ""How do these guys take care of it all?"" They do it with overall ass-busting hustle. One of the chefs had their eye on us, while another chef presented and explained the dish. They work as a team to get every dish not just right, but PERFECT. Everyone knew every detail of each dish. Listen to them, because you are going to have combinations of food you definitely won't have in any Chicago eatery. And last, but certainly not least, the FOOD - We had nothing less than an at-least very good dish in our 11- course degustation menu ($110). With wine/beer ($49), this is truly the best restaurant I have eaten at dollar-for-dollar. I'm sure the 3 course meal ($55) is fine too, but it will just leave you wanting more, and you'll miss getting to stick around and watch these guys work as well as watch the other customers' happy faces for 3+ hours. Our faves? 1a. quail egg ravioli 1b. apple pie soup 2a. crab 2b. tiger fish 3.  tagliatelle Runners-up include a solo little pretzel nugget filled with cheese soaked in Chimay ale, and biscuits and gravy with the cool little miniature biscuits we've ever seen. I ranked the courses as: ""Dadgummit, this is some of the wonderfully best tasting substances in the whole universe. I really wish someone would let me sit alone in a mahogany and leather chair enjoying and consuming this until I become a sad documentary on The Science Channel."" To: ""If I had any foresight, I would have learned to make food like this so that I could become truly happy in my life."" I could try to give details of the flavors and ingredients, but the boys in the back know better than I. They will explain and answer any questions you might have. And be sure to take in the wonderful aromas wafting from your plate before taking your first bite.  Get to Schwa, and be quick about it! Brilliance is on the stove and cookin'!  Seriously, the crew in the kitchen is making groundbreaking stuff. Don't miss it. Us? We'll be back in two beats of a veal heart's ventricle. PS. - Hey Schwa, thanks for letting me know about my lost debit card. Maybe the card wanted to hang around for the oatmeal/raisin oyster shooter ""amuse"" (first course).

2010-02-12,5.0,"Schwa is definitely a rarity in these day, a high end restaurant run by iconoclasts who refuse to change. There will be no recipe books, television shows, Schwa Cafes, Schwa To Go, or Schwa frozen foods at whole foods. There also will not be servers, or anything remotely like your typical restaurant service. What will you will get at Schwa is an amazing meal served by the people who produced it. You will be told the story of each dish by those who made the dish. You will sit in a small, intimate setting where you will know that you will be taken care of. The chefs of Schwa care about the food to a degree that you will only find in the other top restaurants in the city.  The dishes are too numerous to discuss each in detail, but I want to discuss a couple of them. The first dish that really blew my mind was the apple pie soup which was a thick, creamy concoction that was both apple and savory; the soup was in of itself almost a meal - my wife joked that it could easily take the place of a Thanksgiving meal. The other dish was a plate consisting of one single egg-quail ravioli that was so creamy and rich only one was needed (I couldn't imagine even eating more than one.) The menu changes so your experience will be different than mine, but regardless of the menu - you will have a great experience. Some things you will need to keep in mind. One - don't expect a quick return call for reservations - it might take a month or so (or not). Two - Schwa is BYOB - bring a good selection of reds and whites; they will take the wine in the back and pour what they feel will pair with the food.

2010-02-11,5.0,"Amazing!  Simply amazing! We arrived a bit before our 6pm reservation and were the only people in the place....for nearly and hour.  Quite nice actually as we got to see the playful side of the chefs.  As the feel for the night set in I have to say that this is exactly what I had expected and could not have been more please about.  Small and dimly lit, the music selection varied between old-school hip-hop, 80's-90's rock and early electronic, totally hitting a sentimental place. Things proceeded quickly after the chefs complimented our choice of wines (thank you In Fine Spirits!!)  In total 11 courses were served to each of us after we decided on the 9 course menu...total bonus.  However, a larger number or dishes and variations were experienced after one of our dinner companions told of her seafood aversion.  All were amazing and I could give the menu description for each but this would not do any of them justice.   Highlights of the night were the savory apple pie soup (which one of our companions remarked was better than Thanksgiving all in one bite),  truffle ravioli (their signature, which they said were not numerous enough to last the night....glad we got the early reservation),  biscuits and gravy (WOOHOO!!! sweetbreads!!), pork collar (the only time I have used tender and collar in the same description) and pretzel Chimay cheese ball (a bowl of them would have been quite nice.)  I know this is nearly half of the dished I was served, but I can't in good faith whittle this down.  Sorry.

2010-01-24,3.0,"So I gotta say not all that it was hyped up to be at all.  Definetly not bad but for $ 110 I was expecting something a whole lot more.  I'll break it down into categories and hopefully that will explain my 3 star rating. Location/decor-  Personally I love the location.  It was very close to where I live and street parking was surprisingly easy.  Its a small place but I like that.  I was able to watch the chef's as they prepared the meal and found the whole thing quite interesting.  The wall decor is very plain(not a big deal for me).  The rap music, I thought, was kind of fun.  My parents on the other hand were not really enjoying it all that much but I think after the wine, food, and conversation started flowing a little we were all able to kind of zone it out. Service:  We had the Owner/Chef's brother as our server.  He was very attentive and our glasses were always full.  My main problem with him was the smell.  As soon as we sat down and he brought us water, the odor of marijuana was very very strong on him.  Throughout the night the would keep coming back to bring us food or drinks and all I could smell was pot or cigarette smoke.  Now I am not some prude and have no problem with people smoking pot or anything else but when our table was paying over 800 dollars to eat there and he was a little slow in the dish explanations and forgot to tell us how to eat some of the dishes (a fact we learned after the table next to us was served their dishes by the main chef) it just seemed a little unprofessional.  The pot smell is really not that big of a deal but I cant stand cigarette smoke as the last thing I smell right before I take a bite. Food:  So I agree with what others have said.  the ravioli was excellent.  I also loved the first dish of an oyster/oatmeal shooter which had a thousand different flavors to it as well as the pasta dish with veal heart and cheese but as far as dishes that blew my mind that was about it.  Dont get me wrong, everything we had was good but in terms of ""I gotta go back"" ehh I as well as the party I was with are not in any hurry to go back.  The BYOB part was of course excellent and cant complain about that at all. Overall:  A fun place and nice to try once but if Im going to spend the money again it will be at Alinea or Tru",0.9964,0.79,0.166,0.044,0.4781698412698413

I thought the food was great- it didn't completely blow me away, like Tru or Les Nomades, but it was certainly up there.  What I thought was the coolest part of the dining experience was how cool and laid back all the guys there are- and how they clearly just love what they do.  Every time they bring out a course, they tell you a little about it, but they're not pretentious about it, like so many places can be- they really just want to let you know about the food in the most down-to-earth way possible.  Also, several times throughout the dinner, they brought out some different wines and a couple types of liquor for us to try to help complement the various courses.   Great music too- I've actually been meaning to contact them (ha, I know, good luck) to ask about the stuff they play.

I have called about 5 times since May trying to get reservations. I finally got them for January 7th.

A bright red dish.  3. apple pie soup (savory): This was one of the most amazing things I have ever had in my life. It was thick and rich and oh so delicous.  4. crab (peekytoe crab w/ pine, mushroom, caramelized plantain): Wow. Wow. that is all i have to say.  5. maki (with green curry, rootbear, and awesome little fried roe on top): Not usually a fan of roe. but I ate it and it was good.good blend of fresh and fried.  6. quail egg ravioli,: One bite and it basically melt in your mouth. Then you find yourself sucking butter up with a spoon.  7. pork: some of the best pork that I have ever had. So tender and juicy.  8. kona kampachi: Amazing. They had a carmelized something to go with it that gave the soft fish a great sweet crunch 9. a cheese puff, a celery-based cake with white chocolate side: I hate celery and this was one of the best things I have ever tried.

2010-01-11,5.0,"THIS PLACE IS NOT FOR EVERYONE. It's true. If what you love is the neighborhood joint with gooood solid food, this may not be the place for you. However, if you get tired of the same food, if you are adventurous with your food (not a picky, easily squeemish eater), and don't mind dishing 110 for a meal (plus, it's byob. what can be better??? i pay 2/3rd the price of the menu for wine at Alinea), then it's perfect.  The food is GENIUS. I have been there five times (the most recent being this past Friday) and of 36 courses (I've done the 10 and 3 course), I have flat out not enjoyed only ONE of them. At Alinea, through the 13 course meal, I will always have 2-3 that I think just don't work quite well. Schwa doesn't have the attention to every detail Alinea has, but it's just so much more fun, unpretentious, and relaxing.  They recommend you to bring a bottle of wine per person. They give you extra courses. They will share with you their favorite beer or wine that pairs well with a particular course.  If you're in town for one night, sure, go to Alinea for the oh so comfortable, cushy arm chairs and impeccable service. But, if you're here for a week, don't miss Schwa for a fun, adventurous, wine-full weeknight dinner. My favorite item on the menu (that i hope they never get rid of) is the rootbeer maki. It's green curry rice with hamachi in the middle wrapped in a leaf that has a root beer-like flavor. On top is dehydrated tamago (fish eggs) with rootbeer soysauce for dipping, a rootbeer shot for sipping, and a side of pickled carrot (much more delicate than pickled ginger). It sounds weird, but SO AMAZING!!! Your expectations have to be realistic in terms of service and atmosphere. They play whatever rap/hip-hop is on the ipod.

When in January I finally did eat, The beauty, the wonders, of a Schwa feast, The friendly chefs, Did pick up the check. ** Disclaimer: I am not a poet.  As if you couldn't tell already. The actual review:  Just got back from Schwa, and IT. WAS. AMAZING.  If my poem was unintelligible, here's the skinny: I got two reservations and got both canceled (the first res was on my 6th anniversary!!!), the restaurant actually got me a new reservation and picked up the tab.  Talk about awesome. The food:  Incredible.  Our menu: amuse (oyster shooter), crab (peekytoe crab w/ pine, mushroom, caramelized plantain), apple pie soup (savory), tagliatelle (with huckleberries, black truffle, and diced veal heart), maki (with green curry, rootbear, and awesome little fried roe on top), bonus quail egg ravioli, tiger fish (w/ carrot, marshmallow, cardomon), biscuits and gravy (w/ sweetbreads, gravy and mustard), pork (with zucchini, garlic chips, and white anchovy sauce), a cheese puff, a celery-based cake with white chocolate side, and a bonus dessert of violet-infused cones w/ white choco foam, beet ice cream, and a peppercorn.  The food review:  The bad: some things seemed a bit over-salted.  But I have kind of a weird relationship with salt--I tend to think things are either over-salted or not salty at all, so um, take my salt eval w/ a grain of salt?! The good: EVERYTHING.  The pork was unexpectedly phenomenal.  I could eat that stuff all day.  The quail egg was, duh, amazing.  The maki was unexpectedly phenomenal--who thinks to fry roe?!  It was fantastically crunchy and added amazing interest.  I can't really tell you anything about the food that people haven't said a thousand times over (it's amazing, creative, how do they think of this stuff, the breadth of their talent is incredible, blah blah), but I can tell you that my incredibly picky dinner companion (seriously, his favorite restaurant is Chipotle, and until he got to college, he pretty much only ate chicken, spaghetti, pancakes, burgers and pizza--no joke) LOVED the meal and called it ""the best meal of his life.""  So, for those of you who, like me, often live/eat with incredibly picky eats, fear not!  If my picky eater loved it, yours probably will too. The service: Not sure what everyone means by ""curt service,"" etc.  I thought the service was phenom.  Seth was our main person, and he was thorough, efficiently, and friendly.  They let us try some of their own stash of beer, gave us two freebie dishes, and were super apologetic about the prior cancellations (even though we were more than happy to be there!).  They picked up the check without us even mentioning anything about the prior cancellations, which was awesome.  The chef popped by our table several times to ask us about the food (including the new biscuits and gravy--first night on the menu) and was very nice.  Overall, some of the best service I've ever had (and very low-key, not in-your-face, not overly chatty--really perfect).   The atmosphere:  I actually thought it was fantastic. A nice space, and I thought the dim lighting and interesting music (aka not soft boring faux-classy stuff) made it laid-back and romantic.  The low-key atmosphere made it so much easier to enjoy the food--no pretension!

If the food weren't worth the effort, this place would be out of business.  But it was worth the effort.  No question about it.  There were no misses over the course of 3 hours.  The dishes varied textures and flavors and presentation like few other restaurants can even hope.  Sure the service is curt and Michael Carlson is a stress case roaming around the dining room like a drugged up hippie.  But who cares.  His food is simply awesome.  quail egg ravioli, tagliatelle with huckleberries and pickled veal hearts, the eucalyptus cranberry soup for dessert, he just has an uncanny knack for coming up with awesome and unique dishes.  Add to it all that it's BYO and when we ran out they served us beer from their own stash.

They kept our wine glasses full and let me take a copy of the menu home when I asked. The space itself is tiny as everyone always mentions, but it's sleek and clean and relaxing.  Most importantly- the food!  All 9 courses plus one extra were spectacular.  Everyone raves about the quail yolk ravioli, which is excellent, but in my opinion nothing could trump the sweetbreads with cilantro and patron.  We also couldn't stop talking about the apple pie soup with savory and cheesey pie crust, and the grilled tigerfish.... all of it was amazing.  I would go back any time, TODAY if possible.  Thanks to Michael Carlson and his fantastic team for giving us such a memorable experience.  (I did see Carlson in Whole Foods yesterday-- I wanted to tell him what a great time I had at his restaurant, but he seemed busy and I lost my nerve.)",0.9935,0.759,0.219,0.022,0.6079545454545455
2009-12-20,5.0,"Back in November, I told my boyfriend that I was going to take him out to dinner for his birthday and told him to think of an amazing place to go.  He told me he wanted to go to Schwa.  So I looked into it, and called for a reservation. In late November. In very early December they got back to me. And I missed the call. So I swore repeatedly, then called them back and left a message. They got back to me later that week saying they had an opening for two that very night. So I accepted and had a mini-stroke and then called my boyfriend to tell him to get hyped for some AMAZING food. So we got all giddy and starting thinking about the wines we were going to bring and what to wear and so on... And then Schwa called back, saying that the City of Chicago was going to be doing some work on or near the building and that their water was going to be shut off. Which, for those of you doing the math at home, meant that the whole restaurant had to be closed for the night. So the reservation we JUST MADE was null and void. The guys at Schwa were all kinds of apologetic about it and offered me the pick of the reservation litter: any day and time I wanted. So I went for a spot a week later, and broke the news to the boyfriend. A week later, I lost my job. The day after I lost my job, we were due to go to Schwa. Boyfriend told me to cancel the reservation and save my money and that we'll go when our finances are less tight. So I make the call and tell the boys at Schwa that they can give our spot away because I can no longer afford to eat there. They're sympathetic - and maybe a little moreso than the average schmuck on the street, because we've been playing phone tag for something like a month - and express their condolences. Five minutes later my phone rings. It's Schwa. They want us to come for dinner ANYWAY. And dinner is on them. We will be dining at the cost of FREE FIFTY-FREE. And then I cried. Because this kind of nonsense doesn't HAPPEN - not in real life, and certainly not to me. So we got ourselves prettied up and buy some wine, and headed on out to Wicker Park. And the gentlemen at Schwa were wonderful - personable, comfortable with the food (and they should be - the cooks are serving you and running the show there), and smartassed in a way you LIKE because it reminds you of your best friends who happen to be amazing chefs. (What? You don't have best friends like that? More's the pity, but you will FEEL like you have best friends like that while you're here.) And the food at Schwa was nothing short of AMAZING - the quail egg ravioli in brown butter with shaved white truffle, the veal heart with huckleberries, the apple pie soup, and the deconstructed PB&J dessert with black pepper ice cream were absolute standouts. I can't say enough good things about the food and it'll be a long damn time before I stop singing the praises of the chefs. We had an amazing night thanks entirely to the kindness and generosity of the gentlemen who run Schwa. Thank you, Schwa. Thank you so much. I want to send you cupcakes and hug all of you and you're all amazing, generous, wonderful people. Thank you.",0.9983,0.785,0.176,0.039,0.4205322128851541

I called Schwa a month ago, and they finally returned a call and you just have to go and screw that up? =( Anyway, I called back and made a reservation for 2. Then called back two days later to add a 3rd person to the party. They were very nice each time and even gave some wine suggestions (since it's byob).

It had plantains and stuff in it... yum. -pea soup - involves a pea soup in a cup (really good) and a foamy pile of peas. I don't like foam. -tortelloni - delicious - and there was chocolate in this dish, which was an interesting mix, but it works! Just like every unique combo they do (my friend is allergic to chocolate, so they substituted this with a beets dish.. it looked pretty good, minus the foam part) -quail egg ravioli - this is one of their specialties, I hear? It's so cool when you put it in your mouth and the yolk bursts -maki - pretty good.. instead of ginger, there's a pile of carrots. Creative. -lobster - i think this was our favorite - it's amazing! -chicken liver - only dish we didn't like. very salty... -pork - meh. it was good, but the portions are so small! I want more! -cheese - i love cheese. and i loved this cheese dish. -dessert - involved a pastry-like thing surrounded by strawberry syrup. It was very refreshing and a perfect amount of sweetness.  It's impossible to really explain the food. You just have to go and try it yourself. I was still a little hungry at the end of the meal... Or maybe I just wanted more amazing surprises served on a plate. Anyway, they charge a $2.50 corkage fee, so don't be like us and bring 3 bottles of wine, which we barely touched.

It's like the antithesis of  fine dining, a big middle finger to Alinea; the long haired Andre Agassi at Wimbledon; A Ricky ""wild thing"" Vaughn; a five year old brat running around and messing up all this nice shit at Tru The guys, as I'll call Michael Carlson and his crew, (which includes at least his brother, I figured out) are laid back, KNOW their food and are very polite and attentive in their service, sure - but you figure out quickly that this is not a place where you're gonna care (you shouldn't) if your glass of water /wine has been empty for longer than 2 minutes (it probably won't be, in fact) or your napkin wasn't folded into a swan while you were in the bathroom.    If you want formal, they'll give you formal, if you wanna laugh and joke and toast, that's where they're at! I got their attitude as Food first, Drink second, Be happy third.  Simple easy stuff.   Sure you can come to Schwa, having dined at Trotter's last week in your navy blazer and bring in your 200 dollar of wine, just learn that they're not gonna turn that Gangsta Rap down...  Ignore that table of drunk rowdy people, because that is gonna be you shortly my friend...

Warm liquid egg, butter, fresh pasta, Parmesan reggiano, solid piece of shaved truffle. Maki - My favorite.  homemade fish maki rolled in Hoja Santa leaves instead of Nori, topped with fresh and dried (read: crunchy) roe, curry pickled carrots and housemade root beer.  The Hoja Santa leaves have Sassafras in them... like root beer Tiger Fish - beautiful plating.  South american firm fish, with pickled watermelon, red pepper accents, served on Israeli couscous Sweetbreads - See, I've been kind of tricked into thinking sweetbreads are the greatest food on the planet because I've only had them at outstanding restaurants where they turn what I know to be frigging disgusting and turn it into food crack... so of course this was delicious: Candied sweetbreads, roasted corn, banana puree, Patron gelee, Carmel, micro cilantro, popcorn.  One day I'm gonna buy a bag of them, attempt to cook them at home and scar myself for life, I'm sure Pork - Collar cut Pata Negra Jamon de Espana, borage flowers, fermented black bean sauce Cheese - Cheese filled pretzel bites with beer foam - mmmm I agree with those saying it might be worth calling randomly to see if they have a table.  I made reservations a few weeks in advance but heard nothing until the day OF.

Not sure what exactly transpired between my husband and Schwa from reservation to confirmation to the rude discourse on the night of the missed reservation.  Everyone in our party knew the reservation was for the Saturday and one member in our party works on Friday nights so we never make reservations for weekday nights.  It may have been that Schwa wrote down the reservation for the wrong night or then somehow confirmed by DH incorrectly.  I really can't be sure.  I realize their space is small and missing a 6 person reservation can be devastating, but there's no excuse for rudeness.   I've been in the restaurant industry and retail industry.  In no situation should you ever lose your cool.  It destroys your reputation.  Even if you tell yourself you don't care about that.  Your business loses and, more importantly, you lose your own dignity.

So...on to the experience.   The fiance ushered me into a cab, with me clueless to our intended destination.  The address on Ashland she tells the cabby just doesn't connect for me....what the heck is on Ashland south of North Ave?....we gonna slam this wine amonst the palm trees and hub caps, right?  We pull over, and I see it.  The simple sign ""Schwa"".....oh yeah.....I'm in for a treat now.  We've talked about this place...I've heard great things.  We step inside and I'm immediately surprised....this isn't some shi-shi(sp?) place with some spruced up lassie standing behind an ornate podium ready to greet you upon your entrance.  We just walked into someone's house, right?  Tiny room.....simply decorated....nay.....not even really decorated....I mean the walls are painted, but that's about it.  It's like taking a 1 bedroom loft, pulling all the furniture out, taking everthing off the walls, sprinkling some tables around and you're good to go.  But, of course, there is that glass wall in the back giving you a view into the tiny little kitchen...and that's where the magic happens here.  So I'm not even sure what to do after walking in....then this guy pops out of the kitchen and come up to us to show us where we will be spending the next 3 hours or so.  Seriously, I think?  The guys that are making this food are you host, your server, and everything in between?  Now that's a cool concept.  There is no ""telephone"" game here between the front of the house and the back....it's all the same.   The chefs aren't relegated to slaving in the depths of some back kitchen with no direct insight to the customers they are serving.  They make it, and then they bring it to you and they can see your reaction live and in real time.  And I've got to believe in the case of Schwa , that continuous feedback is gonna make these guys feel good.    We went with the the full 9 course run down and couldn't have been more pleased.   I won't walk through all the courses...justice simply can't be done via words.  Yes...there are sauces and foams, and purees, and flavor combinations and textures that us mere mortals would never be able to imagine.  ie...green curry and rootbeer maki??? WTF?  Absolutely fantastic!  And yes....I recall saying ""absolutely fantastic"" like 15 times throughout the night to the various guys that brought these delights to our table.  I was really simply at a loss for words, and still am.  These are unique, flavorful, fanciful, fun dishes that add up to a most special dining experience.  I'll just specifically mention the pea soup, cause I hate peas.  No...I mean I really hate peas....in that bring you back to your childhood, sitting at the table for an hour after everyone has left, your mom requiring you to finish your peas, your fists clenched so hard it hurts kind of hatred for peas.  And I loved the pea soup.  They bring the best out of every ingredient here they use and they do it with style, flavor, and flair.  Nuff said....it's all about the food at Schwa and they deliver with the highest marks.  And to experience this type of food at a BYOB...well that's just unheard of from me perspective.  Keep doin' what you do, Schwa.....and people will ALWAYS come....they most definitely will come.",0.9949,0.797,0.134,0.07,0.5136056111465946
2009-08-18,3.0,"Oh Schwa... I really wanted to like you, especially when you teased me and called me to tell me there was an opening for the night I wanted. Then you nearly broke my heart by calling to tell me you had to cancel the reservation because the AC was broken.  The least you could have done was ask if I was interested in the next day, which you failed to do.  I only got in because I asked if there was an opening the next day. Long story short, finally got in. Now onto the real review: Service: - not really that attentive, sure they explained each course, but it was in such a rushed manner.  probably b/c they each had to run back to their own stations to finish plating (there is no wait staff, the chef and the cooks personally come out to serve you) - on a good note, my beverage was constantly being refilled. - i felt very rushed; and i noticed the table next to us got an ""extra"" dessert that I did not get. why??? i wanted bacon ice cream too!!  Food: - food was innovative for sure. coco nib consomme? interesting, but honestly, i didn't really care for it. it just tasted... weird. - i rate a restaurant based on how memorable the food is. to this day, hands down, manresa in los gatos still wins. michael mina was ok. gary danko i can't tell you what i ate there. coi, also cannot tell you what i ate there.  - so what about schwa? i'd say it's somewhere in the middle.  the cedro negro dish was by far my favorite and probably something i will remember for years to come. I also really enjoyed the toledo cheese dish, but I can see how someone who does not like strong cheese will not care for it.  and as everyone and their mom mentioned, the quail egg ravioli was spectacular. my only complaint about that was they should have presented it on a spoon so you can pop it in your mouth, rather than trying to pick it up gingerly yourself and breaking it when they specifically say not to break it open. it's not my fault! you gave me a fork to eat it with! so overall: food - 4 stars service while there - 3.5 stars service overall (e.g. returning phone calls) - 1 star ambiance - 3.5 stars (i felt like i was in a poorly lit dorm room with a next door neighbor that plays obnoxious rap music loudly 24/7).  would i come back? maybe if it was on someone else's tab.",0.981,0.81,0.12,0.069,0.4947712418300653

I would have loved to have a menu so I could better remember the components (they kind of blow through the descriptions) but, hey, it keeps you wanting to come back.  Otherwise, nothing was ever in want of a refill and after we had finished our meal (and two bottles of champagne) they plied us with red wine from the kitchen until we were afraid to overstay our welcome.  One of the chefs even gave his coat and another, his smokes, to a customer sitting across from us.  How's that for service. A few tips: Keep trying to get a reservation - I had luck calling on a Tuesday afternoon. As for wine, definitely err on the side of going lighter. The two bottles of champagne worked perfectly with every dish. This is not a place where you want to bring one bottle of cab.",0.9974,0.749,0.251,0.0,0.5899582560296847
2009-01-16,5.0,"Utterly fantastic.  We did the 9 course tasting menu. They threw in three extra tastes, so we ended with 12 courses for $110/person. BYOB, no corkage fee. We brought a half bottle of proseco and a bottles of Vouvray and Pinot Noir.  Atmosphere: It is really just a room. 8 tables. Totally basic. There is graffiti outside and it doesn't look like anything special. They were playing a mix of light electronic music and the new Q-tip album (not too loud - it was a comfortable vibe). The dining room is very sparse - 2 floral arrangements and some basic lighting. There is a view in to the kitchen through a large window. The five guys preparing the food also serve as waiters, including the chef.  Husband commented that this was what it would look like if his stoner friends from HS opened a restaurant. It was crazy comfortable - the guys talked to us like they knew us and were just so excited about the food they were creating. Courses: 1. Amuse: Grapefruit pulp topped with some sort of citrus sorbet and agar. It was served on this ice cube and you took it all like a shot. Abs refreshing. 2: Red beet risotto. A risotto flavored with roasted beet. Bright color, some ""bull's blood"" micro greens, a roasted/pickled beet and some beet chips topped with escargot caviar. I did not know snails laid eggs. Delicious. One of my favorite courses. 3: Sunchoke soup. This was amazing. Velvety and smooth. Topped with some sort of licorice and truffle oil and a little salad of sunchoke on the side. 4. Pad Thai. This was crazy. Instead of noodles they used baby octopus. I don't even know how to describe it, but it had this incredible peanut sauce (and I am not a Thai food fan), and lots of fresh basil. 5. Ravioli. An extra course. This was a single ravioli filled with buffalo ricotta and a quail egg. There was a little sauce on top that was super creamy and it was topped with shavings of white truffle and parm regiano. They asked that you not cut in to it, but just pop the whole thing in your mouth. It burst and Justin and I both looked at each other after swallowing and said ""I'll take a dozen of those to go, please"".  6. Asparagus. This was good, but not one of my faves. It was a piece of house-cured white asparagus on a bed of three separate purees - fish roe, bacon and brioche. There was a bacon chip and a little salad of white asparagus. Justin thought the bacon puree tasted bitter, but we both ate everything. 7. Lobster. OMG. Three tiny pieces of butter poached lobster with a salad of persimmon. I didn't realize it, but I guess I've never had persimmon. It's citrusy, but super mild and delicate in flavor. Gigantic prosciutto chip on the side. Really, does it get any better? 8. Chicken Liver. Almost like a pate, then they encapsulate it in a gelee made of chicken liver. There was a broth made of some kind of root veg - rutabaga, maybe? And little rutabaga balls. And some kind of suds - I think it might have been beer, actually. Topped with a piece of peanut brittle. All in all, this was my least favorite dish and I normally really like pate. I think my issue was that it was chilled. Regardless, everything individually tasted good, but together, I wasn't a fan. The guy that brought this course out was very concerned with whether or not we like it - he said he wasn't sure about it. I thought it was cool how honest he was about it. 9. Duck confit. NUM NUM. Three little piles of duck confit ragu on a pumpkin puree. Each pile was then topped with braised brussels sprout and a piece of grilled duck breast. Then the whole plate was topped with a shower of shaved black truffle and chocolate. Very straight forward but intense flavor. I loved it. 10. Cheese course - extra course. This was insanely good and probably my favorite taste of the night. A tiny circular dish, about two inches in diameter, spread with Taleggio cheese, then a tiny spread of scrambled egg and then a crust of honey. It was like a little, cheesy creme brulee. The chef served this course and told us about how the goats(cows/sheep(?) can't remember) are herded up the side of the mountain to graze and aren't given any water, then when they come back to the farm they're milked and that milk is used to make Taleggio - it's way more pungent than just standard milk b/c the animals have been without water for the whole day. Cruel, maybe, but delicious. 11. Candied sweetbreads. Yes. Veal sweetbreads for dessert. There were three tiny pieces, lacquered in sugary, caramely goodness. A passion fruit sauce on the plate with extra caramel and a sweetened parsnip gelee. I can't even describe how good this was. It's essentially meat and veg, but it was so sweet and salty and perfectly ""desserty"".  12. Ice cream. A minuscule scoop of homemade green curry ice cream atop a tiny homemade vanilla tuille cone. The cone was filled with homemade root beer foam. All in all, it was an AWESOME experience. The portions are perfectly sized for a tasting menu. Will be back.",0.9985,0.825,0.138,0.037,0.5525112062878019

With ingredients like: snail eggs, lobster, truffle, beets, chestnut puree, green curry and chicken livers you really don't know what to expect. Expect creativity, fun and none of the pretentiousness you might think you'd get. I came here for my birthday dinner with 3 friends. We had 5 bottles of wine which we left up to the chefs to pair. We did the 9 course dinner. The wines were paired wonderfully as we were brought out each course by the chefs themselves, who joked and made us laugh. We couldn't figure out how each course be better than the last and were proven wrong every time! And while each plate was made up of several components, each item was great on it's own and outstanding when brought together. We would take our bite and look at each other with wide eyes...""Do you taste what I'm tasting?!""  My friend, who truly despises seafood, ate her lobster dish without hesitation. And another didn't like beets and loved the beet risotto! The only problem with having an experience like this is the expectations that this will put on other places I go.

2009-01-11,5.0,"Ate at Schwa for the first time last night. My husband and I both agreed that it was an incredible food experience. DH is usually more of a straightforward meat-potatoes guy, so I was a bit concerned that some of the more out-there pairings would not suit him, but he couldn't stop talking about how great the food was.  We both had the long tasting menu, but mine was slightly tailored because I have a fish/seafood issue. (I mentioned this when reserving, and they were very accommodating, which I greatly appreciate in such a small establishment! And they did a great job of substituting. Example: in place of lobster, I was served delicious, tender pork belly instead of some boring vegetable. Tasty!)  Obviously all of the ingredients seemed to be topnotch, and the different creations had been carefully formulated for maximum impact, and so it is difficult to point to any particular standouts. That said, we both loved the beet risotto and sunchoke soup. Of course, the quail egg ravioli was also incredible. The best surprise, however, was how much we liked the more *unusual* things. DH really liked the pad thai made with jellyfish, which I was afraid that he'd dislike. Then, of course, there was dessert. As he was clearing the table, one of the chefs heard me say (someone tongue in cheek, as I was already very full) that I ""live for dessert."" ""Well, you won't like this one,"" he said. But I was misjudged! Or perhaps he underestimated the appeal of his own dessert: a creation that contained both passion fruit and sweetbreads. Sound odd? Yes, it was, but it was also a fitting end to the menu as it wasn't cloying sweet, but a nice mixture of sweet and tart and...meat. I liked it very much, thank you.  There are two things that will bring me back to Schwa: (1) creative food that doesn't try too hard, but is still innovative and downright good; and (2) lack of pretension. The whole chef-as-server thing worked for me very well. They were all down-to-earth, yet friendly and much more attentive than you might think given their dual role in front and back of the house.(My husband noted how quickly his emptied wine glass was filled every time.) It was a treat to be served food - and have it explained - by the individuals who created the food.  When comparing Schwa to other dining experiences, as I inevitably did, Alinea naturally came to mind. I've been to Alinea and would be fine if I never returned. However, I plan to return to Schwa - hopefully to see what they do with spring produce (peas, morels, etc.) - because I enjoyed the food more than the food at Alinea, and also liked the lack of pretension.

2008-12-20,5.0,"Best dining experience. Ever.  I had high expectations for Schwa, and for the most part, they were exceeded.   We were greeted promptly by a (super adorable) chef.  He explained the menu and gave us a few minutes to settle in.  It was really dark in the dining room; a little tea light would have been nice so I could more comfortably read the menu, but I had to remind myself that no chicks work here....guys tend to over look things like that :)     Service was quick.  We got the 9 course & the pace at first was almost too fast.   Once a course was done, they reset and the next course arrived within a minute or two.  I was worried our meal was only going to last an hour, but service evened out and my companion and I were there nearly 3 hours.   A few courses I loved: sunchoke soup (the most velvety soup I have ever tasted) quail egg ravioli  duck and the amuse was quite good too (grapefruit cells & sorbet) A few courses that were a miss: Henricks gin (I appreciate variety of elements in this dish, but it was WAY too much gelee &  tapioca.  Too many soft textures for my liking). The cobia was delicious, but the amount of smoke overwhelmed my palette.  This was preceded by a dish that also contained smoky bacon.  Two dishes in a row with smoke elements seemed too redundant.  And the dessert-I would have liked to have seen it go more sweet than savory.  This comes from a girl who can eat cheesecake or pie for breakfast ;) What stood out the most was their plating!!!!!!!  I think I stared at each dish for a few minutes before diving in.  So many components, colors, textures on all areas of the plate, including the rim.  Their plates themselves were beautiful.  My favorite presentation was the cobia/watermelon served in the wavy bowl vessel.  So colorful! I loved the interaction with the chefs; it made the experience more personal.  This place rocks.  I'm totally going back in a few months when the menu changes over to spring.  Oh, and I'm going with a girlfriend or two so we can drool over the chefs.",0.9958,0.814,0.167,0.019,0.5251449275362319

Then, when I came back again on Friday, one of your chefs asked me if I had been there before and how similar was the menu from the first time, (and I said yes, much of it was the same), you then flipped the switch on me. You kicked it in to high gear. You took about four or five of the courses and made me different dishes then my dining companions. Some complemented what my friends get, some completely different. Still visually awe inspiring, still amazing to taste, still filled with your rock and roll, passionate and fun cooking skills. I don't mind that you called the day before to see if we could come in, I know you do it your way, that's how you all roll. Some people don't get that.

2008-11-08,4.0,"Remember that guy that didn't win The Next Iron Chef, but his food always looked awesome, Morou Ouattara? Do you remember why he got the boot? If I recall correctly (which is unlikely because I have the memory of a hand towel), it was because he always separated all the elements to his dishes, and his food was considered 'unapproachable' or 'required too much work'. Go look on the Farrah Olivia website and you'll see what I'm talking about. Welp (that's my combination of ""well"" and ""yelp""... As in, ""how you doing today?"" ""I'm doing welp, thanks""), I think Michael Carlson may be guilty of the same crimes of passion on some dishes.  Except for the amuse, the pad thai, and the cheese course (blindingly good), all the dishes required you to get all the elements on one fork, which was no easy task after like 37 courses. Btw, they don't seem to like spoons at Schwa. I can understand this... The undignified nature of using the same utensil I use to scoop flaming hot cheetos and nacho cheese into my mouth may not be consistent with fine dining. Still, I found it a bit odd that they didn't give us a spoon for the French onion soup (my favorite dish regardless). So I won't go through the menu course by course, because I'm hungover as shit and I might need to go vomit (fuck you, wine!), but this was a really cool experience. I tried a bunch of things for the first time, including rabbit (I think I'd actually prefer Trix to that silly rabbit, not my thing) and jellyfish (which should probably be renamed jellofish, because it's more like a fish made out of jello). We also had one of the most interesting deserts ever: parsnip flan with sweetbreads, some sort of foam, and some citrus element (zest?). Together it all worked.  If this kind of stuff doesn't appeal to you, I might say Schwa isn't for you, but if you're adventurous and have billions of dollars like me, Schwa is ftw. But before I go, I have to give a special shout to yelper Rob L. who happened to be dining at the table next to us. He reminds me of myself, if I were nice, had a dope ass wine collection, and were in really good shape. He let us try his '84 Opus One and even donated his remaining 1970 Port to our table. Tres awesome. Oh, and lest I forget, I wouldn't have even scored this reso if it weren't for the rad gal from NoCal, Erin P. I hope you're not having reservation-giver-upper's remorse now.

I wont go into too much detail about the food since everyone else is doing that but I was pleasantly surprised by a few dishes in particular.  I was in love with our salad course (the Hendricks gin/cucumber/rose/ coriander jelly thing)  I'm a big fan of textures/temperatures and I really thought this dish really worked.  A lot of the textures were surprising (like the white chocolate chard) and I really enjoyed it.  I also learned that I love brains...they are like the most perfectly poached egg yolk...when it hovers between solid and liquid. I'm not sure if its because I've been to a few restaurants of this type now, but I wasn't as wowed by the experience as my fellow diners.  Everything was excellent, but something was missing for me and I cant quite put my finger on it.  Maybe I'm just culinar-ily jaded.  Also, while my pocketbook really loved the BYOB, I think i missed having professional wine service.  And while all the chefs were very nice, I like a little more explanation with my food when I am unfamiliar with it...some of them were happy to oblige - others not so much (he said he didn't feel very talkative today).

2008-09-15,4.0,"Schwa is a roller coaster of food. There are ups and there are downs, there are even twists and loops, it goes by too fast, and when it's over you are left a little dazed, with part of you screaming ""woohoo, I want to go again!"" and part of you just wanting to go spend some time in kiddie-land, waiting for your heart rate to return to normal.  After taking a few days to process things, I think that while there were some things that I really liked, 9 course tasting menus may not be for me (I'm a little weird about textures and I hate all fruit and only like certain veggies, and the cost pretty much prohibits me from doing it again for a few months anyway). But I would come back for the 3 course where I have a little more control over what I'm served but I can still get a feel for what the chef can do.   The place is small and very intimate. You feel like you are dining in your friend's house. When we were there, there were only 4 other tables sat. The chefs cook and serve so I can see why they don't fill the place...and why it's so hard to get a reservation.  We brought 6 bottles of wine for 4 people and it worked out to be the perfect amount. Depsite my pickiness, I was determined to be adventurous. I settled in and prepared the the ride.  We started with grapefruit ice amuse. Eh. I'm not a fan of grapefruit so I did my best to just swallow it down and move on.    The Hendrick's gin salad with cucumber gelee and gin/rosewater granita taught me a very important culinary lesson- I detest gelee.  The menu listed beer cheese soup online, which I was super jazzed about, but when we arrived the menu listed french onion (which I hate). As it turned out, it was a corn soup that was phenomenal. I can't remember exactly what was in it, but damn, it was creamy corny goodness.  The jellyfish pad thai was okay. The jellyfish subbed for noodles. Once you got over the novelty, it was just a good pad thai.  Then they brought us something not on the menu - ravioli stuffed with quail egg with shaved white truffle on top. Holy hell. I did NOT want to swallow, I wanted that taste to last forever. Why couldn't I have 15 of those?  Next it was on to the whitefish roe with black garlic and bacon puree and poached asparagus with shaved asparagus made into noodles on the side. I didn't even eat much of the roe, the real star here was the bacon puree. Yum.  Then came the smoked cobia in red pepper couscous with watermelon juice. Tasty.  I had been very nervous about the morels and lamb brains. I did not want to eat brains! Another important lesson for me - I love brains! The brains had a thin crispy coating and were moist and soft inside, kind of the consistency of mashed potato fritters.  The following rabbit dish was pretty unmemorable for me. The demi glace it was served with was really good, but the rabbit itself was a bit gamey.  I totally forgot about the green curry and rootbeer cone until I read about it in someone else's review, so that sums about how I felt about that.  Next was the cheese course - what a dissapointment. I. LOVE. CHEESE. This was not cheese. Okay, what do I know, I'm sure it was cheese but it wasn't good. It was like a custard consistency on the bottom topped with a caramely gelee. Ugh.  Then came dessert. To me, dessert = chocolate. Candied sweetbreads, which  were suprisingly pretty good, are not my idea of a good sweet finale to a meal. I was left feeling incomplete. And after 9+ courses and $280 for two people, I shouldn't feel that way.  I really appreciate what they are doing at Schwa. The intimate experience, the great, unpretentious service from chefs (my one complaint on the service was I felt a bit rushed, we were in and out in 90 minutes) who clearly love what they are doing and are passionate about  providing a unique foodie experience and pushing the envelope of traditional food combinations and preparations.  But, when it comes down to it, I'm a simple girl. Give me juicy medium rare steak topped with blue cheese, some fresh crusty bread dipped in olive oil, and a hunk of chocolate for dessert and I'm happy.

That aside, I know that a number of my friends, as well as a couple of reviewers, have been down in the doldrums because of the difficulty of getting a reservation, so I will give you, the reader, the same piece of advice that I gave my friends:  You can certainly sit on your couch and call occasionally to try and get a reservation at a place that only has 5 employees who spend the entire day prepping amazing meals (and don't have much time to answer phones), or you can walk your lazy asses down to Schwa and talk to them in person. They are extremely accepting of people walking in between 3-4pm and you can usually get a reservation for sometime in the following 2 weeks.  It's worth it.  It's worth every imagined inconvenience and every penny spent.",0.9916,0.82,0.148,0.032,0.47575963718820874

It wasn't the easiest feat to get a hold of someone to make the reservation but from what I know the chefs handle pretty much every aspect of this tiny restaurant including serving and reservations so the always full voicemail is understandable. Michael eventually called me to work out a reservation and when he called again the day before the dinner to confirm my reservation, he asked if I would like to bring 2 extra people to dinner on the house.  AS IF I WOULD SAY NO. I scrambled to find 2 food-loving friends who were available and we got our motley crew to the restaurant the next night. Needless to say, it was one of the best dinners I've ever had. I think that's all you need to know even though it's been said a million other times here and elsewhere. It's kind of a bummer to read the menu on some website beforehand, just wait 'til you get there and enjoy it.

These chefs are some of the most amazing guys in the business and I'm pretty sure the last thing they care about is your whiny attitude. You'll get in - just keep trying. I called on a Tuesday evening and the mailbox was empty. Left my name & info and also noted that ""I'd take a reservation whenever they had an opening""  Sure enough, they called back three days later saying they had one for the following evening.  My philosophy is that being open minded and being kind in your voicemail is key. They don't want to listen to a bunch of cranky soon-to-be-customers. Market yourself, ok? Now onto the evening: absolute bliss. The whole experience is pretty surreal. A tiny home-like setting. Soft lighting. Views of the kitchen. I can't really do the food justice by trying to go into detail, but it was the best I've ever had. It was also great to have each chef come out and explain the dishes... answer questions ... or just make small talk.   My friend Amy & I brought two bottles of wine - one prosecco and one pinot noir. It worked out beautifully.  And for those asking if you're supposed to bring your own glassware - they have actual wine glasses now.

2008-04-17,5.0,"GENIUS.  And yes, I'm a sucker for a man who is as creative, downright personable and gifted as Michael Carlson is.  I had the pleasure of dining in his restaurant when he first opened (some time ago, I know), but finally, after begging and pillaging (ok, so I just called 4 times a day for 13 days until someone answered to get a reservation; no one was injured, except for maybe my secretary who kept hitting speed dial), I got a reservation and had the absolute honor of dining here last night.  Other than the term, GENIUS, the only other description I have is FLAWLESS.  My companion and I had a later reservation so we opted to pass on the 9 courses and instead do the 3 courses.  I started with the white anchovies and I can honestly say that I am now beyond that absolute horrid experience in the Rivera Maya in Mexico where I had an anchovy pizza that just about ruined me for life.  Anyway... as far as a main course, I had the seared cobbia with maple syrup infused foam.  I didn't think fish could taste so fresh and yet, so interesting,  The flavors were pure, clean and absolutely right on.  Everything had its own flavor - the fish, the sauce, the pickled item on the edge of the plate - but still complemented one another in ways that I can't really put into words.   My companion started with the beer soup with pretzel roll (nothing like anything you've ever tasted, even if you've done all the beer tastings and beer/course dinners in town).  His next course was the lamb with white chocolate infused foam, which he said was spectacular.  This, coming from a man, who hated dining at Tru, Everest and thought Ambria was passable, means a lot.   Dessert was wonderful, although I must say I've entirely forgotten what it really was.  I only recall that it had caramelized sweet breads and those little nuggets were unforgettable.  Who knew you could caramelize a sweet bread!? All I can say is Michael knows and appreciates that dining isn't always just about taste and presentation.  His ability to combine those ideas and still fuse some import into teaching people about the values associated with texture and emotion are entirely apparent.   There is a reason why F&W named him Best New Chef for 2007.  He downright deserved it.",0.9922,0.792,0.151,0.057,0.5937148268398268

2008-04-12,4.0,"Look at David W.'s review/lisiting of the food.  We apparently went during the same menu cycle, and he took better notes than I did!  I would ignore the reviews from the people who haven't actually been to Schwa... Yes, it is apparently very difficult to make a reservation for this place - though I can't really speak to that since my wife made the reservation for my birthday.  But, the place is tiny and it is unlike any other restaurant in the city so if it is hard to get a reservation then so be it.  We were there on a Tuesday night and the restaurant was full.  (Keep in mind this is probably a three hour dining experience; they aren't flipping the tables like it's an Applebee's.)  I don't think they care if you are pissed off because you can't get a reservation - they have a lot of other folks who will gladly take your place in line.   So, how good is Schwa?  Well, damn good.  It is certainly frou-frou food.  Foams, crisps, and all of the other goodies that the top end restaurants have become so fond of... Personally, I am not a huge fan of this stuff, but if you are going to have it then have it at Schwa.   We did the nine course tasting menu, and (with two bonus courses) we actually ended up getting eleven courses.  We also got a bonus glass of wine.  The courses ranged from exceptional (Chimay cheese soup with a mustard crisp and a homemade pretzel), to the less than wonderful (liver and onions can't be salvaged in my mind), to the bizarre - dessert (candied sweetbreads, not my thing).  Everything was exceptionally prepared, most everything tasted heavenly.  I was particularly fond of the ""salad"" at the beginning (stone crab, bananas,etc.) and their interpretation of the beer cheese soup.  The antelope, pad thai, and cheese course were also great. That being said, for $110 per person, this is probably the most affordable tasting menu that you will find for this quality and this type of restaurant.  If you moved this tasting menu to one of the city's other high end restaurants, then I am sure that you would add on another $65.  Also, you should keep in mind that the $110 is tax inclusive.  So, all in all, this place is probably 50% less expensive than some of its competitors. I loved the service at this place.  The chefs serve the food, and they do it without attitude.  They answer questions, they talk to you, and they are really very down to earth.  Quite cool. I am subtracting one star for a simple reason - wine.  Mind you, this is partly our fault.  From observing people that we assumed to be ""regulars"", the correct thing to do is to bring several bottles of wine with you and to select the wine(s) that are most appropriate for the evening.  We brought one - very good - bottle of French red.  It went well with two of the courses, but it totally overwhelmed some of the others.  The Schwa guys did provide a glass of French white (Vouvray) with some of the earlier courses, and that helped a lot.  I just didn't want to be drinking a really full bodied, chewy French red with seafood - and we didn't have any alternatives.  Oh well.   This place is truly unique.  You have to try it, so keep calling.  Get the reservation and go.  You may not love it, but you will be glad that you went.",0.996,0.828,0.131,0.041,0.4882039976484421

We splurged on the 9 course menu and were there for 3+ hours. The dishes were complex, stylish and- most importantly- phenomenally tasty. Overall, it's the ideal balance of sweet and savory.  Their take on beer and pretzels was wildly enjoyable. It was some sort of beer brewed by monks in a land far away that was injected with cheese. Coupled with the best pretzel morsel I've ever had, garnished with a mustard chip and dill sauce.  Was also wowed by the jellyfish pad thai and sea urchin sorbet (an extra course they threw in). But my 2 favorites were the most unexpected ones. First, the liver and onions which was served with a textured risotto. Sounds gag-worthy but I wanted seconds. And then the antelope (yes, antelope). Don't want to know how they got it, but it was perfect and now is my protein of choice. This is a tiny, almost dumpy spot. But it gives this fine dining extravaganza an unusual neighborhood feel that is endearing. The chefs serve each course, including the brainchild, Michael. He's the frazzled mad scientist, with veins popping, who you know is a culinary mastermind just by looking at him.

Unlike other places where you have ""reservations"" but then arrive and are then told apologetically that you still have to wait another 30 minutes, they seat you immediately. They take care to ensure they have enough food and don't overbook. The only negative were the IKEA (literally, I think) tumblers for water and wine. All the other flatware and silverware was decent--why not invest a few more bucks in nice glasses? I am not understanding these people who are reviewing negatively without having eaten there. It seems quite evident that you need to get reservations ahead of time--many weeks ahead of time. Those negative reviews are seriously just a display of the reviewer's own ignorance and unwarranted self-importance. Ahem.. ONE RECOMMENDATION: If you'll be going there, you should call and ask what kind of wine the chefs recommend with their food for the night! I saw a lot of people who brought red wine for the meal I had last night, but the fare was lighter and definitely white-wine appropriate. (Maybe bring your own wine glasses too!

2007-04-25,5.0,"Here's some history on ""the Schwa"": If Alinea didn't open in 2005, Schwa probably would have been the city's best new restaurant.  Michael Carlson was named one of Food & Wine's Best New Chefs that year. Then they received 3 stars from the Trib. Finally, Chicago Magazine named Chef Carlson Best New Chef of 2005. Well deserved for a fantastic restaurant. The good side of schwa (and it is a REALLY good side) is that chef Carlson is operating an incredible BYOB that turns out dishes that are on par with Avenues, Blackbird, etc.   Both starters we had (quail egg ravioli and lobster ) were good, as were the two entrees (pork tenderloin and scallops). The pork and lobster were my favorites and I was thinking about the meal even days later. The dark side of schwa is that because of all the accolades, everyone wants a piece of it.  Additionally, because chef Carlson refuses to expand the restraunt's capacity beyond whatever he and his two/three assistance can accomodate themselves, there just isn't enough room for everyone who wants to go here.    I've seen some other reviews where people have had trouble getting reservations and gave it one star based on that alone.  That seems somewhat irresponsible to me.  It's like deciding you want to go to a restaurant in Minneapolis and then complaining that the drive was too long.  It's a SMALL restaurant that EVERYONE wants to go to.  Of COURSE its going to be hard to get a reservation and OF COURSE they are not going to be spending loads of time fielding questions and answering phones.  They run a small operation (which I completely respect) so you need to call during the hours they answer the phone and expect a 2+ month waiting list for weekends. If you are willing to look past the fact that its not a ""Lettuce Entertain You restaurant"" and put up with the extra effort required, I think you will find that it's well worth the wait once you get there.",0.9803,0.85,0.112,0.038,0.41601010101010094
2007-04-10,5.0,"This was the most amazing dining experience I have ever had. Friends of mine were original diners when it opened and being crazy foodies raved and raved.  They finally (and it is true it takes forever to secure a reservation) got a hold of someone for a reservation and made it for 4. The whole thing with it being difficult to get a  reservation..well, it's part of the fun if you ask me.  I heard from an inside source that after all the recent publicity they are looking into having someone do phones on more regular basis..so don't worry. As I mentioned there seems to be so much written in the last month about this restaurant so no need to get into details on the food.. but I will say that this restaurant opened a whole new world of food to me...it was spectacular. Two of us do not eat any meat aside from seafood and the chefs were seemingly excited about this and provided us with amazing variations on the meat dishes our dining friends had.   Yes there was rap music playing pretty loud but I found it to be hilarious and fun, the place is small, so you feel like you are dining in a living room and though we didn't speak to any other diners, you felt a sort of communal energy.   It's pricey but well worth it!  I could go on, but so many have covered it better. I hope this restaurant starts a trend of amazingly creative, mind blowing  food in small intimate restaurants in Chicago. It was more than just eating food and more like experiencing art.",0.9963,0.753,0.229,0.017,0.5668569175922118
2007-02-28,5.0,"Schwa is a treat for the adventurous palate.  The experience was certainly more palatable for me since someone else paid for my meal.  While you might not love every dish, you will appreicate chef Michael Carlson's audacity.  FYI, he was one of Food & Wine's top chefs of 2006.  You can choose between a $55 or $105 menu, which buys you a 3-course or 9-course meal, respectively.  Don't worry about going hungry if you order the smaller menu; they bring you extra items in between the listed courses to keep you satisfied.  The night started with a chocolate-covered truffle with a unique bacon powder and a beet juice concoction as a chaser.  Next up was the sunchoke soup, a heavily (IMO too) creamy soup with the consistency of bisque and interesting citrus accents including candied kumquat and blood orange.  The quail egg with ricotta, brown butter, and parmigiano reggiano was divine; the initial saltiness is quenched with the most delicious cheesy, creamy mixture you've ever tasted.  The main course choices that night included delicous sturgeon (I stole a piece from my friend) or the equally delightful pork with black truffle, parsnip, prosciutto, some sort of mushroom, and other tasty garnishes.  The candied apple with hint of sea salt and I think some sort of peanut powder was very yummy.  My dessert of pretzels with a a paste of caramel and dates and unique turmeric ice cream was pretty good.  I was jealous of my fellow dining companions who had the chocolate brownie with pumpkin ice cream.  There is no wine list.  However, there is a negligible $5 corking fee for BYOB.  I recommend bringing along a red, a white, and a Riesling to complement your various dishes.  The resturant is small and the decor is minimalist.  It is easy to walk right by the restaurant as there is little to clue you into the location from the outside.  Reservations are imperative; good luck getting one.",0.9927,0.811,0.165,0.025,0.520021645021645
2007-02-09,4.0,"Just had dinner at Schwa last night.  Price is up to $105 for 9 courses now.  Food is comtemporary American done very well.  If you're a self proclaimed foodie, wondering how Chefs rejunvenate old pairings or come up with new food compositions.  Then this is your restaurant.   Store front looks like a hole in the wall.  But when you step in, it's an understated, elegant room.  Service is minimal but adequate.  And I appreciate discussing each course with my server.  The kitchen staff bring you your food, expains all the ingredients  to you and takes care of giving you new forks and knives after each course.  I personally don't care about stemware.  They do give you a new glass each time you pop a new bottle.   Outstanding courses: Chestnut soup, quail egg ravioli, the rabbit, tumeric ice cream.  Some courses came out on plates like paintings on canvas.   A few misses too: the risotto as cheese course, the beet juice at the beginning.  Nothing special. I went to Alinea before everybody got googoo gaagaa over it.  I believe Michael Carlson's Schwa will become the same phenomenon.",0.9862,0.813,0.175,0.012,0.3931006493506493
2007-01-29,2.0,"I know I know--the word is that the food is fabulous and worth the price especially since you can bring your own wine etc.  And the chef has great talent with a smashing ravioli like none other and chestnut soup but some frankly-wierd combinations that don't play with old foodies like us. But the worst thing is the arrogance--the music is loud and crashing and unsuited to enjoying the food.  But the waitstaff don't give a hoot--the chef likes the music--but so what if the customers don't.   And what kind of stupidity is it to charge $5 fee for BYO and not provide appropriate wine glasses--don't they know that wine should be served in decent glasses to get the full flavor?   One more thing.  Lining up (#2 in the line) for the rst room, which necessitated standing aside the kitchen,which promised to be a worthy wait--we were shuttled back to our tables with a promise that we would be called when the restroom was vacant.  Have they called you?  They never called me. I will NEVER return to this restaurant.  The food is excellent but there are far better places for food and none of them are as expensive or as arrogant and un-customer-oriented...try another place for good food.  One Sixty Blue, A Tavola, Copper Blue, Tizi Mellou--don't go there and be treated like unwelcome family members.",0.9763,0.745,0.179,0.076,0.6376666666666666
2007-01-13,2.0,"Call me a simple girl but after waiting 2 months to get into this place- I was eagerly awaiting an experience that has been described as one of the best food experiences in the city.  Well, I say- save your money.  Maybe it was an off night- the chefs did come to the table to tell us that they were having exhaust hood problems (in fact- they first told us that they were not going to be able to serve us) but they didn't tell anyone else that at the other tables- hmmm- maybe a hint of things to come? I like eclectic food, presented in an artsy way- this night it seemed like the art was taking precedence over the food as while everything looked great- 9 courses at $100 a person- we were all disappointed with the food.  We knew it would be a little ""out there"" (how about beet juice in a shot glass served with a beet rolled in chocolate powder or ravioli with quails eggs, or caviar that had a caramelized topping to break through?) but usually it comes together better.  My fav courses were the melon and prosciutto plate/soup, rabbit that came deboned and was delicious as well as a beef plate that had a small short rib on it (didn't care for the raw beef and quails egg and pickled beef that came on the same plate)and the spoonful of risotto.  I kept hoping to get one of the selections that other people wrote about on here, but no luck. There are no waiters- the chefs do all the cooking and serving and explain each course and they put down the plate.  Our chef seemed to be irritated with us that we chose to stay after he said they were having problems.   I know he was stressed but it would have been better to hide that from us.  We brought plenty of wines to serve with the courses and had some problems with the chef remembering to bring the right wine with the right course.  Also- there are no wine glasses- you'll be drinking your fav wine in a water tumbler- somehow also didn't work for me. If you are going to go- keep a watch out- it's nondescript black awning doesn't make it pop on its block of Ashland- I actually drove by it twice and then thought maybe it had closed.  I followed another couple into the door- only to find that they had not make reservations two months prior and they were sent away. We left disappointed as we had such high expectations.    Again- call me a simple girl but a simple girl who won't be back!",0.9549,0.788,0.119,0.093,0.4187484737484738
2007-01-12,4.0,"Wow.  The food, in a word, sublime.  As you may know from other reviews this is a small place, seating around 26 people.  The service was unpretentious and informative.  Reservations are difficult to come by due to the size of the operation.  Our party all had the nine course option priced at $100pp.  The flavor combination was brilliant.  The fact the restaurant is BYO saved us the equivalent of Costa Rica's GNP.  If you enjoy Contemporary American cuisine and consider yourself even a little adventurous (in a culinary sense) Schwa is a must-visit.",0.9424,0.795,0.181,0.025,0.5180555555555556
2006-12-13,5.0,"Schwa doesn't need my rave because every foodie in the city (and in the country) who eats there will tell you that this is one of the most amazing restaurants in the Chicago area. It is Alinea/Trotters caliber with a much, much cheaper prize tag (nine-course tasting for $95 is not necessarily cheap, but you should see what you're getting) and it's BYOB, which obviously saves a fortune. The cuisine is creative but delicious and surprisingly filling for such small plates (as I said, it is NINE small plates, which is pretty significant). The service is wonderful. The chefs themselves actually seat and serve you and describe in detail what they have prepared for you. Despite the potential for pretension, it's a totally laid back place. At the end of the night on a quieter night lately, the main chef sat down at a table with some old friends and share a six pack of beer with them. I can't imagine you'd see Charlie Trotter do such a thing! Yes, the reservations are impossible, but weeknights are easier and they did have some cancellations the night that we were there in November. I'm already gearing up for the next reservation there in a few months. It's worth the wait!",0.9929,0.804,0.196,0.0,0.535082304526749
2006-09-12,2.0,"This isn't really a review, since I haven't actually eaten at Schwa...more of a warning to not enter unless you have a reservation. My boyfriend and I tried calling 3 times, and no one answered the phone. So we stopped by to see if we could get a table. When I walked in everyone looked at me like I was a crazy freak, and finally a chef came out to inform me that they are reservation only, but that they do not answer the phone during serving hours. He checked to see if we could get a table, but they did not have enough food to accomodate us. I suppose we will try again another time, at least they were realatively friendly in declining me service.",0.1308,0.879,0.05,0.071,0.5750000000000001
2006-06-08,5.0,"The first time I went to Schwa was in June 2006, and I really liked it. For some reason - probably the long waiting period for a reservation - Mike and I had never been together. When Schwa reopened this winter, I called and got a reservation for his birthday, and we could not have asked for a better meal. For the winter menu that's currently being served, Michael recommends guner veltliner, pinot blanc, and pinot noir wines, so we brought a GruVe and a pinot noir, and they both complemented our meal perfectly. Supposedly nine courses, but we actually got more like thirteen. Amuse: honey sorbet with hints of chamomile, grapefruit, and shaved black truffle: the perfect palate cleanser. Jonah crab with banana, celery, and coriander microgreens: delicious pickled crab with banana chips, fried bananas, and a little salad of the microgreens and celelry. Beer cheese soup: Made with chimay beer and cheese, served with a mustard crisp and a hot soft pretzel ball. I could eat this every day. Jellyfish pad thai: some of the best pad thai flavors I've ever had. The jellyfish handled the spice and nuttiness of the sauces exceptionally well. Pinecone: The famous pinecone with juniper jelly and sea urchin ice cream. Mike loved this, but I was not a huge fan of the uni ice cream. The junipier jelly was pretty delicious though. Quail egg ravioli: One of these was definitely not enough. Parmesan cheese, quail egg, and perfectly cooked pasta. I was tempted to lick the bottom of the bowl...but I refrained. Arctic char roe with pumpernickel and rutabaga: very salty, not my favorite, but the rutabaga consomme and rutabaga balls were very tasty. Kona kampachi: served lightly seared with maple foam, lime pudding, and pickled daikon. Flavors that I would never have put together, but I dish I wish I could have had more of. Liver and onions: I was not looking forward to this, but I was pleasantly surprised. Onion risotto, topped with well-cooked, well-seasoned, and generally very tasty calf's liver. I probably wouldn't order it, but if it got put in front of me, I'd definitely eat it :). Antelope: one of my favorite courses of the night! Antelope was served two ways - sous vie with butternut squash and a soy or tamarind based sauce, and then a stewed antelope with white chocolate mousse. Absolutely delicious. Dessert: An interesting course. Parsnip custard, garnished with candied veal sweetbreads, lavender foam, and passionfruit coulis. I didn't eat the sweetbreads, but the rest of it was surprisingly good, sweet, and definitely satisfied my dessert craving. Birthday Bites: Lie and say it's someone's birthday, even if it's not. This is pureed cake batter, frozen into little balls, dipped in white chocolate. Fantastically good.  Service was amazing. The kitchen staff signed Mike's menu for him to keep and they could not have been nicer. No corkage fee, and we weren't charged for coffee either. We're going to try to make reservations now for the spring menu, whenever it comes out...",0.9985,0.776,0.193,0.03,0.643939393939394
