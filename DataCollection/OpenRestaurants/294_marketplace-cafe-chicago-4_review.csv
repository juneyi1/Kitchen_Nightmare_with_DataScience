Honestly, amazing service and super friendly! Now to the food.. I ordered the Margarita Pizza and of course added pepperoni. I have no idea what they use to season this pizza, but it tasted AMAZING!

2015-11-06,5.0,"I come here all the time for lunch or dinner. You can sit for long periods of time with your friends and no pressure to leave. Their food is superb and just as good as any downtown restaurant.  It's always clean, it's very relaxing, and the people who work here are super nice with good customer service. For a nice sit down meal without the noise of the food court it's best to come here.. Here is my favorite meal.  The grilled shrimp and arugula salad is excellent.  I have ordered shrimp at many different upscale restaurants in Chicago and none compare to the size and taste of these grilled shrimp.  They taste like they just came off the grill and so fresh, flavorful, and seasoned perfectly.   What I want to also stress is the size, they are not tiny or small, but large in size and the quantity they give you is great. In any case, it's a fantastic salad, which can fill you up for as a whole meal. The tomato basil soup is always consistently good and can be ordered with the salad if you really need more.   They also have a variety of other salads made with chicken and salmon, but I have never had one, but I'm sure they look good. I've taken home their chocolate chip cookies (which are great). I've had their cranberry turkey sandwich before and they are very accomodating in changing the type of bread it is served on. Also, you don't need to only come here only for lunch or dinner.  When I am downtown with friends we often stop here for tea and dessert.  They have all varieties of tea and desserts which are not all on the sweet side.  Get a booth by the window, and you'll have a great view. Since they remodeled, they do not show the foods on display anymore.  I miss that.

I read the reviews and was surprised at the top ratings for a ""food court"" but I was not let down by my experience. The menu on the cafe nordstrom website is not complete and there are hot entrees that are not listed as well. You go in and a server takes your order from behind the display glass of all the wonderful items you can chose from. I ended up with a shrimp and asparagus risotto and my wife had grilled salmon with mixed vegetables. After you pay, you get your number and a server will seat you and provide some dinner rolls. The servers are top notch! Very attentive and they provided A+ service. The food itself was off the chart. I did not expect much from a 13 dollar risotto, but it rivaled a full sit down restaurant. My wife's grilled salmon was very much like a entree you would expect at a sit down restaurant as well. Once you are done with your meal, the server will clear away your table and provide you with some chocolate mints. Remember to tip them for their good service!

Fresh, healthy, and delicious vinagrette dressing. Probably could've eaten a full salad for lunch instead and been very happy. Had the spicy chicken torta sandwhich and it was superb. Not overly spicy but a good kick to it and phenomenal flavor. That flavor that makes you want to just keep eating more and more. And it was a good sized sandwich too, plenty of chicken and I felt full by the end. Also had a lemon dessert - I forget exactly what it was called - but it was superb and not overly heavy, nor would it leave one feeling guilty for grabbing dessert on top of a good, full meal.

They have many GF options, and they're more than willing to omit anything if it's not to your liking. The ingredients are always fresh and everything is well-prepared.

And it was all just a nice surprise. I didn't even mind the standing in line to order thing, because you get to walk by all the plated samples. That's just my favorite way to choose a meal. And unlike, for example, Subway, where the end product looks nothing likes the ad pics, what you see is definitely what you get here. I had a bit of a hard time choosing. I was hungry and the sandwiches looked inviting. But when I saw those salads: Man, they were beautiful. And I love a good salad out. So I chose the Salmon Salad Nicoise ($12.25,) and my friend got the pear/blue cheese with greens. ($9.50) The salad was fresh and filling, and the salmon done perfectly and coated with fresh herbs. If you're a salmon fan, you can also get a Roasted Salmon plate with Yukon gold potatoes and rustic roasted vegetables. A very generous serving also for $12.25. Not bad at all for a fresh salmon dinner. Other items which jumped out at me or were recommended: - Tomato Basil Soup - Grilled Shrimp and Arugula Salad with Sweet corn - Chicken and Brie Sandwich with Cherry Marmalade - Turkey Club Panini - Spicy Chicken Torta - Chicken and Artichoke Pasta - Grilled Skirt Steak Chimichurri The pizzas did not look too interesting, but there's lots of other goodies to  choose from: and all a good value.

Anyway, as to the food, well, it's sandwiches, paninis, salads, pizza and pasta at about 10 bucks per.  I had the turkey panini, which was good if a bit bland.  The whole scene of this place spiced it up a bit.   But who really cares about the food?  This place is all about the scene, boy.

2012-11-20,4.0,"On a recent trip to Chicago, we stopped into the Nordstrom Cafe for lunch.  I'd been sick with a gastrointestinitis (TMI!), so soup broth was pretty much all I could stomach (no pun intended). Being that chicken noodle soup is my least favorite of all soups, I wasn't stoked on ordering a bowl....but when I saw it, I changed my tune. Back in the 90's I worked for the Cafe. We used Sisco products, including soup mixes. I didn't think it got any better (I love Sisco soups for real and petition they begin selling them at Costco) but that was before they started making everything from scratch.  This homemade chicken noodle soup wasn't watery or bland. It had a ton of real white meat chicken, lots of vegetables and spices and was thick; almost creamy. It also came with cheesy toasted french bread. It was a bit on the spendy side, but then, the Cafe has gone from a Cafe to an ""almost""  fine dining establishment.  I'm told then now make pretty much everything from scratch. That'd explain the increase in price. Of course, so could the 20 years since I worked there.  The Cafe turned me on to pub mustard (aka honey mustard, but not the dressing) and I pretty much can't eat a sandwich without it now. I also thought Cobb salads were disgusting until I actually tried the Cafe version all those years ago. Funny, how people order those as diet food, when the ingredients are nothing but chunks of delicious fattening delectable's (ie blue cheese, bacon bits, olives, avocados).  This particular Cafe was larger than the ones I'd been to, and a little more upscale. That must be a downtown Chicago thing, because everything else seemed a bit bigger and shinier than back at home.  No clue when I will be back to this particular Cafe, but I never pass up ordering something from any of them, when I pass by shopping.",0.9575,0.873,0.089,0.038,0.5286706349206347

We happened to be walking past Nordstrom and saw the cafe. It looked to be pretty popular. Why not? Despite many trips to Nordstrom stores over the years, I had never eaten at their cafes before. Now I understand why I usually see longish lines at these cafes - the food is quite good! Nice variety, the menu is much bigger than you would think. For some reason I always thought they sold mostly pastry/bakery items and coffee drinks, and not much else. I was wrong. I had a really nice-sized salad that I can't remember the exact name of, but it had shrimp and corn in it. Mouthwateringly good. I am a lover of big salads, and this one impressed me. Despite its size, I nearly finished it because I just couldn't stop eating it. I kept saying I was done, but then I'd take just one more bite. And so on and so forth. The service was really good as well, and being a lover of bread that's brought to your table, I was quite happy with that as well. A perfect lunch to me is a great salad and warm, buttery bread.

It was delicious and very filling; to the point that I didn't eat lunch until approximately 5 hours later because I was so full.

2012-02-28,4.0,"The cafe is an attractive space on Nordstrom's top floor.  It is a cash and carry type operation where you carry a tray, select your food, pay at the registers and move to the seating area.  The exception is with hot items where you are given a number to display at your table.  The staff are very professional; anyone who appears to need assistance is approached with an offer to carry their tray.  Many pricier spots don't have staff this well trained. There are quite a few options here.  There are always two soups on offer, the tomato basil and a soup of the day.  You can ask to sample the soup and I would advise you do that as they have had chefs who mainline salt.  The sandwiches are good and well stuffed with filling, they make a certain bread/sandwich chain operation look chintzy. The salads are excellent and made to order, not sitting around getting curled up and sad.  The salmon nicoise salad is great, with a nice chunk of salmon fillet and the chinese chicken salad is tasty too.  They do sell their salad dressing by the bottle, pricey but good. There is a selection of pizzas and pasta dishes, I can't comment as I haven't tried them though they seem popular.  There is also a selection of hot dishes. I love the tuscan salmon which has potatoes, zucchini, peppers and corn on the cob to round out the fish.  The grilled skirt steak with chimichurri sauce is also pretty decent.   The prices are ok, perhaps a little high if you are doing lunch from work but a real bargain if you are going to the cinema/millennium park etc.  You can get a quality meal at a far lower price than surrounding restaurants if you are not fussed about table service. In fact, I have steered several friends there when we have been heading downtown and they have all been pleasantly surprised. I would give this place five stars because it is excellent for its type except for one thing.  The desserts have gone downhill over the past couple of years.  They used to have tiramissu, tres leches cake and a great strawberry shortcake in the summer.  There were also good fruit tarts and a revolving roster of tasty pastries in the glass case.  Now they have really lackluster stuff that is very expensive, for example a cold crumble that tastes like sawdust.  Sometimes people want a decent pastry and coffee.  Not everyone goes ga-ga over cupcakes.",0.9959,0.83,0.157,0.014,0.6412433862433863

When I entered, everything was different. Salads and sandwiches are on display, with cooks behind the counter to take your order. ""Wheres the waldorf? Wheres the waldorf?"" I didn't spot it on display, so I grabbed a menu...Still, no waldorf.  They have recreated their menu with Chinese Chicken Salad, Grilled Chicken and Strawberry Salad, Nicoise salad with Salmon...and sandwiches that include Cranberry Turkey, Roast Chicken Focaccia club...Then, they have some pizza and pasta options. I rolled with the grilled chicken ceaser, which was safe, typical. The whole time...I just wished for that Waldorf...and Rice Krispies? They told me you have to go downstairs to the coffee bar.

Pop in almost any day during the work week and there I'll be, eating peacefully with some version of a Nordies signature salad on my plate.

Despite being a 'cafeteria-style' restaurant, Nordstrom ups the class ante with personal touches like waiters that offer you water, refill your drinks, deliver bread and butter, check in periodically and bring thoughtful chocolates to the table at the close of your meal. While I often appreciate this upscale touch, my predisposition to never having cash on me does not... tips are mandatory for these hardworking dudes and often I'm just stopping in for a quick midday lunch that doesn't really require such niceties.

The food on display looked delicious. i ended up ordering the a colorful Tuscan chicken meal.  After paying for the food we found a place to sit in the back. It struck me as odd how the person busing tables was wearing an expensive cashmere sweater (at least she was wearing an apron to prevent the sweater from getting soiled). Nordstrom's must give cafe employees a hefty discount on merchandise to justify wearing such an outfit while cleaning up food. It answered a long nagging question that I have had.. what sort of restaurant would Nordstrom's create, well this is it.  Anyway, I digress...   The food itself was visually appetizing.  The taste however was definitely designed more for the American pallet, like decent food that you would find served at a wedding, nothing to potentially exotic and pleasantly bland.  Overall, if I find myself hungry and at Nordstrom's on Michigan Avenue I will be back, otherwise, it's not worth a special trip.",0.9394,0.826,0.11,0.063,0.4718253968253968

Wait, why is our country in economic crisis again? Never mind. Anywho, I've never dined at the Nord before- I didn't even know there was a Cafe aside from the little coffee bar on the mezzanine level.  We split the smoked turkey and brie sandwich (pretzel roll! holla!) which the guy behind the counter offered to put on 2 plates for us. Which was great, as it meant we each got our own portion of chips. The sandwich was very tasty, I mean, you can't go wrong with a pretzel roll now can you? Not a whole lot of meat but a nice big hunk of brie to make up for it. At around $9, I wouldn't say it's a bargain, but it was enough for 2 people to share and not be starving after. We also shared a chocolate chip cookie and got some coffee to go along with it.  For the main course we bussed ourselves, but a waitress did refill our coffees for us. I think the table service is more reserved for the hot food.  Unfortunately, after we left we realized that we didn't tip. We didn't think about it since we barely had service, and also since neither of us had any cash.  So Abbie, I'm sorry. You were very friendly, and if we ever go back, we'll tip you double. The best part was after we finished lunch we were confronted by garishly bright Juicy Couture tracksuits and purses- for kids. Like, little girls.

Fresh brewed iced tea is the perfect complement to the meal. Purchase your food at the counter, grab a seat and if you need anything else ask your friend waiter or waitress they'll be happy to refill your drink. Chocolate mints appear with a business card for your server - don't forget to tip $1!",0.9907,0.72,0.269,0.011,0.7122222222222221
2008-02-18,4.0,"I've been going to Nordstrom Cafe since 2002 on a regular basis, and they've been fairly consistent on food quality, service and selection.  I've noticed some of my favorite menu items come and go, but I enjoy their personal-size pizzas and pomme frites (which are basically wafer potato chips).  Nordstrom Cafe is really just a fancy cafeteria where you go through a line, choose things, then you pay at a register.  The little tip trays, which were introduced a couple of years ago--why, I don't know since it's not waiter service--are a bit off-putting when you're the one carrying your tray to the table and getting drinks yourself.",0.6908,0.925,0.06,0.015,0.42115384615384616
2007-11-25,4.0,"I was very impressed with Cafe Nordstrom. Lots of panini, salad, and pasta choices. I wanted half a salad and half a panini, but they direct you to either the hot or cold line, so I wasn't sure if it was possible. Even though it was very busy, the line moved quickly. We also were able to get a table immediately. I had a chicken pesto panini and it was very tasty. My brother had a mini pizza, which he devoured, and his girlfriend had some sort of pasta (I don't remember which). We were all extremely satisfied. I honestly forgot I was in Nordstroms. Cafe Nordstrom is more or less equivalent to Panera or Cosi, so if you like those places, most likely you'll enjoy Cafe Nordstrom as well.",0.9632,0.82,0.159,0.021,0.6351944444444444

2007-10-20,4.0,"I stumbled upon this place while wondering the mall. I found the atmosphere great, and the service / food delivery very quick. Most of the stuff they do make on site, with a few exceptions. I've been in the lunch rush and other times and have never had to wait too long for a table. I'm confident that once the winter comes and shopping begins for the holidays, this place will be a zoo. At least you know it's good food with a wait and so many repeat guests. The panini's are GREAT, especially the goat cheese special they have every blue moon. The Black Forest Ham, Turkey and Cheese is very tasty too! Friendly staff as well, offers your drink to go at the end.",0.9781,0.809,0.191,0.0,0.4868386243386244
2007-10-17,3.0,"I eat here fairly regularly and while the prices are high, they are great about splitting dishes and allowing you to get half-orders of their salads and veggies. The roasted veggie plate is just wonderful. I like carrots anyway, but I swear I could eat a plate of them if they all tasted this good. Ditto for the corn, peppers, potatoes, etc. The pear and bleu cheese salad is good, but ask for the dressing on the side. The strawberry and goat cheese salad is probably better, but the former comes with candied walnuts and those pretty much rock my world. Go. Bring a friend. Share. Why the three stars and not more? Because they have these overeager ""waiter assistant"" types constantly asking you if you're done with you're plate. It's not a sit-down establishment; you order your food and bring it back to a table yourself (unless you have to wait for something and then they bring it out.) I am happy to throw down a buck or two for this additional service, but leave me alone unless I look like I need help! Whew. I feel better now...",0.9927,0.755,0.221,0.024,0.4930715811965812

The food is always good, though I think the sandwiches are starting to get a little smaller then they were when I first ate there years ago.  However as an alternative to the food court, this is really nice.  When I am downtown and looking for a quick meal, the Nordstrom Cafe is always on the short list.",0.1675,0.849,0.074,0.077,0.5372807017543861

Tucked away on the top floor of Nordstrom's, it's a sit-down cafe; you order at the counter and they bring you your food.  The ambiance and decor make it a couple steps up from a cafeteria, and although I just tried the pizza margherita, it was excellent.   The attendant brought our order, refilled our water glasses and was quick to clear our plates when we finished.  And we ate here about 5:30, when it was nearly empty so no lines at all!  If you're in the area, I'd definitely check this out.",0.8528,0.856,0.108,0.036,0.49444444444444446

After a Michigan Avenue power-shopping session, I was famished.  AND since I was a little hung over that day too, all bets were off and I shimmied past the salad section.  Feed me, Seymour! I settled on the Tuscan Turkey Panini.  I also could not resist a gigantic helping of the pommes frites. . .is it a fry or a chip?  Hell, I don't know but those things are TASTY.  The panini was a good combination of flavors and I loved the fact all was brought to my table.  The cafe attendants (because they are not really servers who take your order) were quick to fill my Coke glass but didn't disturb me while I read my book.  Oh, happy leisurely alone lunches!   If you are looking for a step above the typical food court lunch - head here.  It may cost more but on some days it's worth it.",0.9466,0.805,0.133,0.062,0.43444444444444447

Nice view of the southeast side i believe. i've had their pad thai which i wouldn't recommend, but all soups (accompanied with a baguette), salads, and the mac & cheese are all pretty good.",0.9594,0.782,0.194,0.024,0.7283333333333333

I figured my friends and I would have the same problem today since the shoe department in Nordstroms was a madhouse (as always), but we were lucky enough to find no line when we got there.   I can't believe with all the shopping I've done at Nordstroms that I'm just discovering this now because it was great. My friends and I split the grilled chicken strawberry salad on it (so good- LOVE anything with goat cheese), pesto pizza special (probably my favorite dish since I'm a fan of both pizza & pesto), and the tilapia special (also very yummy).   The cafe is cafeteria style so you place your order at the counter and then they bring it to you. Daryl our server was extremely attentive, much more attentive than he needed to be in this type of atmosphere, but it was well appreciated.  My one complaint was that the dishes they gave us were dirty (ick), but Daryl took care of it immediately.  And best of all- this place is cheap!
