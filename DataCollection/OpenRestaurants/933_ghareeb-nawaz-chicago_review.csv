2017-08-31,5.0,"Yes, it is CASH ONLY!! But so worth the trouble. It was a great find, thanks to Yelp again! And when you see a lot of Asians frequenting this place you know it's good! We ordered 4 different dishes based on some of the YELP reviews and I really liked their grilled fish. It was not overcooked or chewy and grilled just right! If the mixed vegetable dish had not been so spicy I would have really loved to order this dish too, but I will likely stick with the Paleek Paneer next time. However the mixed vegetable was the only dish that had cauliflower and I was in the mood for that. Good flavor, but that goodness for the yogurt sauce to help calm the spice. Next I had the beef biryani and they served it with plenty of rice. The chili chicken was a little too salty but I'll probably try the butter chicken next time.

2017-07-31,5.0,"Great prices, great food. You are not eating here for the atmosphere, but it sure is a cultural experience either way. Only takes cash. It's kind of interesting. The entire menu is up on the wall complete with backlit photos of each dish (it reminded me of a Chinese restaurant that way). You walk up to the counter and order - cash only. Then they give you your receipt (which has your order number on it). Then, you grab a pitcher of water and some glasses and grab a seat and wait for your number to be called.  Every single item we ordered was amazing and prepared fresh. For the four of us (two adults, two kids), we ordered two naan (they are huge, but go fast), butter chicken, chicken kebab, and palak paneer (saag paneer). we got one bowl or rice to go with it along with a small bowl of plain yoghurt. All the food was served on Corningware (none of which matched - and all of this I especially loved). It felt like you were at an auntie's house having a casual lunch, with that special touch of the Corningware. Only, there's lots of random other people hanging out too and you may or not be sitting at a 6 foot folding table.  The bottom line is that you don't come here for the atmosphere (unless the cultural immersion experience is your thing). You are here to eat and eat well.  I picked up a cup of chai (prepared as traditionally as you would expect) while we waited and it was prepared perfectly - thick milk and the right amount of masala.  Every person in our family loved it and we will be back. Even my very particular 14-year-old gave it a 4.9 on a 5.0 scale. He doesn't even like Indian food.

Only when my food came, it was missing the rice, so I had to wait longer for them to get it. Also, it was missing the mango lassi, and although all they had to do was push a lever on a drink machine literally behind them, I waited forever to get that too. And when I got my dish, it looked nothing like my friend's dish - which was the exact same order. But while his was a lovely bright orange butter chicken, mine was a deep red.

The portions are huge! I enjoyed the potato samosa (must have been sweet potato, which was a pleasant surprise. Still savory though!) and each of the four veggie curries on my tray. I think they rotate the curries often, but tonight I had a lentil curry, chickpea curry, okra curry, and a pepper/tomato/carrot curry. All were delicious, and my favorite was the okra - loved the spice level. I regret not asking the staff what the names of the curries were before I inhaled every last bit of it, including the chapati and rice, but oh well. I didn't even get to try the Gyros Biryani or naan because my brother also inhaled his meal, haha. All the more reason to come back another time to try other items!

After trying it, I have to admit it is hands down one of my favorite Indian restaurants. When there are three lines to order, you know the owners are doing something right. When we walked in, we got in line and ordered immediately. We then sat down and then waited for them to call our number. It took them about 20 minutes to prepare our dishes. Other than that, I wasn't expecting much as far as service because it's a very casual restaurant.  We ordered several dishes: butter chicken, frontier chicken, chili chicken, spicy gyro masala, and goat curry. All, besides the goat curry, were delicious and extremely flavorful. The butter chicken was phenomenal and so creamy - we had to order two! All were quite spicy too! Another one of my favorites was the gyro masala. I've never had gyro cubes....it was genius. There are so many other dishes that this restaurant has. The wall has the entire menu on it with pictures to guide your decision.  The best part of the delicious food is that the prices are extremely affordable. We spent 60$ to feed six people. And trust me, we ordered a lot of food.

We made the mistake of not knowing that the first time we went there and the atm was down.  The guy at the register was nice enough to take our order anyway AND let us order our food without paying first while we got someone to work on the atm. ""Go ahead and eat,  you can pay when it's fixed"" we even offered to go get cash from the gas station down the street. He wouldn't take no for an answer. Talk about customer service!! The food is authentic, delicious and cheap. None of that ""fusion"" or watered down americanized mess here. The potions are super generous as well.

I would recommend the following dishes:  Beef Biryani - So aromatic and wonderfully spiced, and the shredded, marinated beef was tender and slightly chewy. The dish came with a side yogurt, and I liked dipping the rice into the yogurt to cool down the spices. I love the spiced basmati rice too.  Lamb Biryani - Same thing as the Beef Biryani but with lamb instead. I don't like lamb meat that much, but this dish got me sold. The chunks of lamb meat are marinated deliciously.  Butter Chicken - Chunks of chicken drenched in a creamy curry sauce, so mildly spiced I couldn't taste any spiciness at all, but that didn't affect its tastiness. The buttery aftertaste wasn't too heavy on the tongue but was enough to add some richness to the dish.  Get the Chili Chicken too, it's a very popular dish there. I don't quite remember if I've tried that as well, but I'd bet anything that it is as good as it can get.  I believe you can also get a side of a large piece naan bread for $1 or $2. What a deal.

It's all served to you on tidy metal prison tray. I swear something is about to blow. Dude If you like heat you wont be able to help yourself. The rice is nucleared up too. After growing and evolving I just get the regular Chicken Biryani. Solid stuff for the right price. Although they give you a huge bed of rice. I'm American I don't eat that much rice so unfortunately much of it goes to waste. Instead of rice I usually inhale the Paratha. It's kind of like Pita bread, then dip it in the Yogurt sauce pure tits man! Brilliant call with the Yogurt by the way. It cools off the palate and aids in digestion. Another dish I tend to get is Kapsa, also Chicken and Rice but has whole parts of Chicken topped with Chickpeas? You can wash all this goodness down with a tasty Mango drink that is not overly sweet. Ghareeb Nawaz may not be the best quality spot as I have gotten advice to go to other similar spots but when you consider it's cheap,  fast, good,  and can go at anytime that is a spot on my list.",0.7478,0.82,0.105,0.075,0.5246558996558996

When we got our food, my wife offered to go to a nearby ATM, but the host/cashier said not to worry about it, and that we should sit, eat and enjoy our food, and we can pay after, there was no rush.  So that, we did.  The food was delicious.  My wife had the chicken biryani and the chili chicken, and I had the chili chicken biryani and the chicken karahi.  We also shared chana masala and paratha, and two cans of pop.  The quality of the food was great, the quantity was huge (atleast a half chicken in both of our biryani, as well as a huge plate of rice), the flavor was fantastic, and all of this was under $30.  We also had some ice cream after from them, two popcicles for $4, both very good.   Outstanding choice for a late night meal, especially if you are very hungry!  Just wish it was closer to home! Almost forgot to mention: Seems like many Yelpers think that the Chili Chicken is good.  Well, I must they are completely correct, it is outstanding!  And while we were there, I actually heard a guy giving suggestions to another person who never had been there before, and that was his first suggestion.  Very delicious!",0.9977,0.773,0.211,0.016,0.696984126984127

2016-11-06,5.0,"Read the full review on Cat the Critic!  catthecritic.wordpress.c… Located a 20-minute drive south of campus on Devon Avenue, towards the east end of Chicago's Little India, this plain-looking but straightforwardly traditional restaurant is now my new inspiration for Indian cuisine. It's open 24/7, it's extremely inexpensive and it's goddamn delicious! (ATTENTION: It's also cash-only. If you go, plan accordingly!) When you walk in, there's a large picture menu on the wall to your right, showing pictures of very traditional Indian & Pakistani dishes. You'll find biryani, kababs, curry dishes and a bunch of other menu items that cost around $4-$5 each. And the portions? HUUUUUGE. Luckily, my friends had been there before, so they knew how much to order. Our meal for 3 rang up at a little over $11. When you're ready to order, wait your turn in line at the front of the counter. This place is quite popular, especially during our visit there on a Saturday evening. But don't worry, the line moves quickly. Your food arrives in a matter of minutes, and suddenly, you're overstimulated by the bright colors, interesting textures and strong flavors. Our chicken biryani ($4) was served on a large, metal tray with yogurt and chopped onions. The chicken, marinated with many spices, was also so moist and easy to chew off the bone. The sauce, which clung well to the basmati rice, was slightly spicy, but the yogurt helped cool things down. We also ordered 3 huge pieces of naan for $.75 each, which were flat and chewy, but also nicely charred and crispy in some parts. It tasted less processed, more hearty than what I normally get at my local grocery store. Along with the biryani, Maddy recommended the Palak Paneer ($4), which was a fragrant dish of pureed spinach cooked in oils, spices, chili and garlic. It was also mixed with some cubes of fried cottage cheese, which tasted like firm tofu - non-offensive and neutral but somehow not bland - and complemented the texture of the spinach. All in all, you should strongly consider Ghareeb Nawaz, especially if you're not a huge fan of Indian food, which I wasn't before I visited. This is the meal that showed me the light.",0.9963,0.809,0.171,0.02,0.6104838974157154

Service was quick and friendly -- order at the counter and they will call your order when it's ready.

Sadly, didn't find much going on in celebration of Diwali, but we did end up with a massive food coma after checking this spot out. For $26, we got the boneless chicken biryani, frontier chicken, gyros, aloo palak (seasoned spinach & potatoes), chicken tikka, and two orders of naan. Let me start by saying that was probably enough to feed probably 5 or 6 people. To give you an idea of how much food that was... Between the three of us sitting as a four-seat table, there wasn't much room for us to have individual plates down and we essentially needed to eat our way through the food to make room for our plates. Not quite a buffet, but you could say it was close... That being said, food was excellent. We some how manage to demolish all of that even though I for sure thought we'd have leftovers.

Every time I call to order ahead of time I am always quoted 15 minutes.  Usually when I show up my food is just getting moved to the front, so 15 minutes is always a perfect quote time.

2016-06-14,2.0,"Last Friday we drove to Chicago from Champaign just for grocery shopping and enjoying Indian cuisine on Devon avenue. First of all there was so much traffic that it took us 4 hours to reach Devon avenue. But, I was still being optimistic thinking the food will make our miserable trip worthwhile. I had bookmarked gareeb nawaz on the basis of good reviews on Yelp, so we headed straight towards it for lunch. It was extremely hot outside and I just wanted to sit inside air conditioned restaurant and enjoy the food. To my surprise, they just had fans, no air conditioning. I was still fine with it, thinking food will be good (I'm just too optimistic sometimes). We ordered goat biryani, chicken seekh kabab and chicken chargha. Food came fast. This type of food is enjoyed best when hot. But, everything we got was lukewarm to touch. I know biryani is pre-cooked, but not seekh kabab and chicken chargha. I know the prices are reasonable but then nothing can justify lukewarm food.  Rice in biryani was dry. I don't think they boil rice separately and then layer the meat and rice. Rice was cooked Like you cook in rice cooker and then just mixed with meat. Guess, they added less water while cooking rice which resulted in drier biryani. Seekh kabab would have tasted good if it would have been hot. Chicken chargha was bland. It did not have any flavor to it. It was cold and dry too. All in all, not so good experience.

Roti was ok, and the beef patties were alright as well but again lacked any type of flavor. Oh also, mango lassi... biggest joke ever, it was completely watered down.

I've lived in both India and Nepal and this looked and felt like I was at one of the local bus rest stops between Kathmandu and Pokhara. From the decor (or lack thereof), the large semi-communal tables, the people eating with their hands, the unbeatably low prices, and the smell of delicious Indian food being rolled out at crazy speeds, this place is about as close to India as you can get in the US.  For $13, my boyfriend and I split the chana masala, chicken biryani, chicken korma, and two orders of chapati. No wonder over 2/3rds of the people at Ghareeb Nawaz were eating the biryani...it's HUGE and delicious and comes with a nice raita to cool it down. Each piece of chapati was massive and cost $0.75, the chana masala only cost a couple dollars and was also really tasty. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the chicken korma. I liked the sauce, but I swear the ratio of meat to bone was 1:9.  I will definitely be back soon, and next time I will get their famous chili chicken biryani or green chili chicken biryani.

Their Butter Chicken is a true wonder, the Chicken Biryani tastes delicious, I loved so much the Samosas, even the Nan and Chappati were succulent. Very good point also, portions are huge: I qualify myself as having a large (very large?) appetite, and I was rapidly full here.

Service: From some family members who have been there, the service is very straight forward.  Typically nothing extraordinary about the attitude.

The place was quite busy which is no surprise from what I have read about the place.  Upon walking in, I had to figure out where the line was as people were just standing everywhere. I was able to look up at the wall menu to choose what I wanted and I noticed the prices were awesome. I chose to go with the butter chicken along with a side of rice and garlic naan. I looked around and most of the tables were full and the areas where it wasn't full they didn't look very clean. Once my food arrived, I noticed it came on a cafeteria style tray. I reached for the tray and it was some white creamy substance all over the bottom; not to mention there was smeared sauce all over the counter. I guess no one thought it would be a good idea to wipe it down before placing food for pick up there. Once I got to my table I realized I needed to wipe it down as I already had sauce on my tray and did not want to add to the mess so I wiped down. I also noticed an empty pitcher and paper cups next to me which were never removed the whole time I was sitting there which leads me to believe no damns/fucks are given to clear out space for people to sit and eat without leftover residuals from the previous patron. My meal was pretty good though as I've never had bad butter chicken and the naan was good as well. If I were to ever eat here again, it would probably be carryout which I noticed quite a few people were doing.",0.9511,0.858,0.096,0.046,0.4862820512820511

I would have definitely missed this place if not for all these yelp reviews - so I was glad that I found out about a gem. Unfortunately food didn't taste as good as I had hoped it would. I went in with a few friends so we ordered vegetable biriyani, Channa masala, veggie curry and some naan. Portions were generous as everyone here has mentioned and the bill for four people only came to $12. (I was impressed by that for sure!) Biriyani felt pretty bland and masala did not really bring out the authentic taste. I was so disappointed however I was glad that we got those warm naans. They helped to brighten a gloomy Chicago winter day. I loved holding those warm naans and inhaling the fresh smell so much that we ordered some naan to go. We also tried fish curry and although it was decent I felt it was too salty. I am not sure if I went on an off day but I wasn't really impressed with the taste of food as much as we were impressed by the prices. I would probably be back to order naan for take out. Nothing else probably. I really wanted to love their food but I just couldn't. (Sigh)",0.9826,0.779,0.178,0.044,0.6406130268199233

The $5 portions of biryani were humongous and pretty yummy! I imagine they cook the rice in giant batches and don't season them as well, because my friend's portion was significantly more bland than mine, but at least the meat was tender and flavorful. The meat:rice ratio is decent, since the chicken pieces were big. Ideally if you broke up the chicken into bite sized pieces, you'd probably get a piece of meat per bite of rice. The boneless beef is shredded and integrates pretty well into the rice.  I would probably not come here normally, only for late night munchies .But if they're going to regularly run out of things I want to eat/try during my typical late-night food run hours, that's really gonna discourage me from making the drive here.",0.8961,0.836,0.123,0.041,0.6278579059829058

I will spare you the details, but our apartment has been a dark, dark place for the last three days.  For the record, my roommate has a penchant for eating street food-- and by that I mean food he finds sitting on the street. Pizza, doughnuts, even sushi. He has (and will continue to) eat it all. His stomach of steel has never been affected, even by raw fish he has eaten off of the sidewalks of Milwaukee ave. It is Ghareeb Nawaz that has challenged all of our stomachs, from those made of steel to the more fragile sort. All of us feel as though we have been poisoned.  We are looking at it as a sort of new-age dieting method. We all look more gaunt (see: heroin chic) on the days following our Ghareeb dinner. I understand that this look is desirable for some.

I've tried the chili chicken, butter chicken, and makhani paneer.  I ordered the chili chicken due to all the rave reviews on here, but I personally felt like it was way too salty. The spice was definitely there, which gave a good amount of heat, and I love myself some spicy food. I just couldn't stomach the heaping amount of salt and ended up tossing the rest of the chili chicken.   The butter chicken and makhani paneer were both good. Not the best I've ever had, but definitely the cheapest. I feel like the price is right for the flavor, and portions are large. I'm not trying to downgrade the hype, but realistically, don't come in here thinking you're going to get superior Indian food for $5. I've noticed some of reviews on here say it's the best food in Little India, but I don't agree. It's not that kind of gem.

2014-03-01,5.0,"SPICE UP MY LIFE We recently got back from Asia and decided we needed more Indian food in our life. We ate at an Indian restaurant in Bali that burned us but in a good way and we were now seeking that kind of heat in Chicago. Chicago has a great corridor of authentic Indian restaurants on Devon Ave. The problem is deciding which one to go to. My wife and I ended up here.  I am so happy we did! When we walked in my wife wanted to carry our food out.  I totally understood why because this place looked aged.  In fact, it looks a little scary but I was not going to let the appearance change my mind. I wanted authentic. I did not want a fancy white table cloth place. The lady at the front counter was really nice and patient with us. There is a giant board of food with names and pictures. I realized that the board has the same dish but served three different ways.  1) You can get it as a build your own sandwich. Served on a fancy metal prison tray. That scared my wife but I thought it looked cool.  2) You can get a giant bowl of it. And add on 2 bread or one rice for a $1. 3) You can get it all mixed with rice. Once I realized the dishes then the giant menu board seemed to get smaller to me. I was not really looking for what to order but how I wanted to eat it. Since we were going family style we went for option #2. On a side note, I made up the 1-2-3 ordering process so do not walk in here expecting to see that. You are going to have to still point at the board and pick your dish. We decided to go with Butter Chicken and Chili Chicken. Both were amazing. We also added on one plate of rice and 2 bread. We asked for the Naan but were told that they were out of it. We then asked the lady behind the counter what her favorite was and she said the Paratha. Guess what? That is our new favorite now. I will never ever want Naan again. The dishes also came with a bowl of sour cream and raw white onions. We were using the Paratha and making our own sandwiches. It was so messy with delicious juices running down our hands. If this could be food porn, then it was. Every bite was better then the next. The butter chicken was so yummy. We came home and started looking up recipes. Yes we are going to try this at home one day soon. The sauce for the butter chicken was just decadent. I wanted a spoon to start eating it like soup. The chili chicken was fantastic. I pointed out to my wife that the spices in this dish were similar to the Colonel's Secret Recipe for Original Chicken at KFC. She agreed and is forcing me to mention this in a review. Now I must be honest I haven't had KFC in over 10 years but those original spices stick with you. I am now thinking the Colonel went to Indian and stole this recipe. Yes I am stating that here and for the record. I must say I mean no disrespect to the Chili Chicken here because it is 10 times better then any fasts food chicken at KFC. Next time you are here I want you to think about this before you bite in and then shoot me a note if you agree or disagree. We also mixed our chickens with the rice too. So we had the best of all worlds. Sandwiches and rice bowls plus some samosas on the side. This was a feast for lunch. Our quick lunch excursion took us 2.5 hours roundtrip back to downtown Chicago. Here is the sad thing. As I was driving down Roosevelt Road at Halsted I noticed they had a second location at UIC. What? We could have been here in 5 minutes. I am not reviewing that location yet. That will be for another time. But this is a much cleaner version of the original. Personally I think you have to go to the original to experience it all. On a funny note my wife thought we ate at a different restaurant on Devon. She had a fancy place all marked. So when we walked in here she was in total shock because the photos of the place did not even match. I did not find that out until a week later. We had such a funny laugh when we realized we might have eaten at the wrong place but I love food stories like that because it seems more interesting. Plus it makes for a great story! If your looking for delicious Indian food that isn't going to cost you a lot of money then this is your place. I highly recommend the Butter Chicken and the Chili Chicken. All dishes are under $4.99 and you can add rice or 2 bread for only a $1. Samosas were only .50 cents and came in beef or potato. Go potato! I really did not care for the beef. Our whole lunch was $14 and we even had leftovers to bring home.  We are so happy we found this place. It is open 24/7. The interior is not very fancy, so don't expect very much.

The food actually tastes pretty good, they don't go cheap on the meat when you order somehing like a chicken tikka paratha or gyros paratha (which is awesome btw) the prices are probably the lowest out of all the desi restaurants and the owners seem to be very nice people.  The only thing that repels me from this place is the sanitary issues. I first started caring about this after years of eating their food when I went into their bathroom which seems kind of run down (even the door) and then I noticed they had a little container under the liquid soap dispenser which collected the soap that might slide off people's hands as it's dispensing. . I started thinking what if they're pouring that back in there to save a little $?! That combined with how they were shut down by the city (I think twice), I thought it best to stay away despite their awesome gyro parathas and low prices Anyway, if you can look past the sanitary issues and want good tasting food at low prices, this place is pretty good.   The reason I give it 4 stars despite my suspicions is because I never confirmed if these suspicions were true or not",0.9908,0.768,0.203,0.029,0.6023504273504275

Food:  I got 2x naan, chili chicken, and boneless beef biryani for $12 including tax.  2 meals out of the chicken and naan, 3 out of the biryani,  All told, about 7 lbs of food. The naan was freshly baked and fluffy, charred in places, and not oily at all.  It was delicious, and warms up almost as good as fresh.  (Microwave in a wet paper towel 30 seconds).  You can't beat the price - $0.50 each, and bigger than your head! - with a stick.  (I generally like paratha better, and  will try that next time I'm in. The boneless beef biryani was mildly spiced, and really could stand a gamier meat -- I adore their goat biryani, bones and all! -- while the beef itself tasted like really delicious pot roast.  Still, I'll be going back to my favorite goat. The chili chicken, while not the magenta color promised by other yelp reviewers, was a beautiful maroon.  The chicken was mostly dark meat, and boneless; I think this was a good choice, and wonder whether white meat would stand up to the spices.  The flavor was highly complex -- I could taste about 17 different things going on -- before the heat hit.  And the heat: Fwhoo, did it ever hit.  The chili chicken has both dried and fresh peppers in it, and gets hotter the longer it sits.  I'm pretty sure the cooks makes it as hot for the patrons as for themselves as a matter of course.  I could only finish a half portion, but that is okay because it became snacks, breakfast nibbles, and dinner the next night.  One note:  If you order this, YOU WILL NEED BREAD. I went in at noon on a Sunday as opposed to at nine at night on Christmas Eve (the last time I was in), and genuinely could not discern any difference in quality.  Staff were pleasant, cooking was fast, food was delicious.  This is a third date place, one of those, ""let me take you to my favorite favorite restaurant you might not go into on your own"" haunts. A+ would nom again.  (Next time I will try different things!)",0.9985,0.772,0.217,0.01,0.6029265873015873

2013-04-04,4.0,"Pros:  Reasonable, plentiful, yummy, healthy, parking Cons:  Small tables, lack of chairs, crowd My nephews were in town from Kentucky so Uncle Roy and I took them out for another fun-filled Chicago adventure.  I found this restaurant on Yelp.   Went here  on a late Saturday afternoon where there was still a steady crowd of all people from all cultures flowing in. My main concern was having a table to eat.  After I cleared and sat down a vacated table, some African guy was trying to steal it away from me, he finally ended up at the table next to me but took our chair so we were short a chair.  Another Indian man sat down at the table thinking I was alone there was a bit of a communication gap, I would be flattering myself to say he wanted a date with me, but I really think he just wanted to rest his feet while he waited for his order. soon after he took his seat, the boys came and it was clear what I was trying to tell him.   After 15 minutes the boys orders came out first.  I gasped at the site of 3 bowls of what they called ""Butter Chicken"" thinking chicken pieces drenched in ghee wasn't heart healthy, later the boys assured me the only butter in the dish was butternut squash.  I thought it odd, why wouldn't they call it butternut squash? The added orders of samosas (not so great, glad this wasn't my first experience with samosas), giant plates of biryani rice, and freshly made giant naan breads immediately filled the table leaving me with hardly any space when my order finally arrived about 15 minutes after.  A total of 30 minutes, Chili Chicken must take longer to make.  From the vast menu on the wall, almost everything appealed to me, yet I justified my choice with the idea that chili helps with metabolism.  While I was waiting for my dish the boys let me try their delicious Butter Chicken and I was wishing I had it.  The Chili Chicken (which had no sauce) and Butter Chicken would have actually went great together. Next time go here, I will be a little more familiar about the paratha selections that appear to be smaller versions of the entrees with a side of rice and bread on a silver tray that will conveniently fit the small tables.  Or if I order the bigger entrees it will definitely be take out unless I decide to go when there are less people.  It was tough fighting for another chair and then because of the lack of table space I was doing a balancing act with one hand holding the heavy plate of rice, while picking at my entree and nann from the table with the other hand.  The good part is that I was burning calories at the same time I was consuming calories. 4/11/12 CORRECTION I couldn't stop thinking about that ""Butter Chicken"" so a couple days later I looked up the recipe.  Guess what...no butternut squash involved!  I called Uncle Roy up right away and told him he was a BIG FAT LIER!  He was laughing like crazy.  It is actually a few tablespoons of butter but in consolation, most of what the chicken is soaking in is yogurt.   RIP, Uncle Roy.  The boys and I will miss going out with you on their visits from KY.  It won't be the same without you. The idea that this place is opened 24/7 sounds so inviting for future late night visits but keep in mind when they are sold out of something, they are sold out e.g. samosas.",0.9968,0.827,0.134,0.038,0.5437650312650313

I noticed that people that came after me were getting their food first. I didn't order anything complicated or excessive, so I didn't understand why it took so long. One of the last times I went, I asked where my food was after waiting about 30 minutes. They forgot to put in my order and did not apologize. The last time I went (in December 2012) the cashier was very rude and the food took long again. I had to ask for my mango lassi that I previously ordered. He tried to ring me up for it even though I already paid for it. After I finished eating, I went to the bathroom. There was a bug on the toilet seat so I decided to grab a piece of paper towel to clear off the seat. When I grabbed a piece off the roll, another bug popped out.

So I have a confession to make.  I got Indian food from 2 different restaurants on Friday.  I know that's insane, but I don't get up to Devon often so I figured I would get a lot of food. I had a nice dinner with Cassie D a few blocks away, but the reviews for here were good and the prices were so cheap, I thought I would get a few things from here to eat over the weekend.

The samosas did not do so well the next day, but that was my own fault for thinking they would keep.  The naan was huge and good.  It was still soft and chewy the next day!  I wasn't crazy about the veggie biryani, next time I will just get basmati rice.  The aloo masala and daal lentil were really good.  Everyone liked both of them!  The chicken nihari was fine, but I did not like the haleem.  (In fairness, I have never had either of the chicken dishes anywhere else, so I cannot say that I would like them better anywhere else.  I just learned not to order haleem in the future). The food was quick enough.  (As other people have said, slow enough so they are clearly making it fresh, fast enough so I wasn't wondering what happened to it).

2012-09-23,4.0,"Super cheap food - you can easily spend $20 here for food that would last you couple of days. If you eat in, prepare to spend about $5 to $10 per person for plenty of food. I especially love their naan, roti, and samosa, which runs at 50 cent to $1 a piece. There is also no waiter services, so don't worry about tips. You just order at the counter, wait for your food, and eat at one of the tables. The food comes out pretty fast too, so if you're still hungry, just come up and order more.  During my two trips here, I didn't eat in but instead just take the food to go, so I can't comment on the atmosphere, but expect a mix of people. The first time I visited, which was in Jan/Feb, there were tons of regular Indians/Pakistanis grabbing a quick bite. But I saw tons of white and other ethnic couples on my last trip there. Who wouldn't like it here though? It's cheap and delicious!  That being said, my experience the first time here was only ok. Like I said, I ordered lots of food to go for dinner, and while the food was really good, my dinning partner, who wasn't used to spicy food, couldn't eat a lot. Also, and I apologize for being straight forward, the spices led to an uncomfortable experience in the bathroom. So after the first time here, I decided to hold off writing a review for this place. It might have been a one time unfortunate event. Perhaps I should have gone with something milder, but I am somewhat of a snob about my tolerant for spicy food.  HOWEVER, now that you are forced into reading TMI, I would say that my second trip here was A LOT more pleasant. One night, a friend and I were walking toward the busier part of Devon for dinner. Thanks to the 155 that never showed up, we were both about to faint from the long walk and hunger. So I told him about this spot, and we walked in to get some small bites for the road, i.e. the next 15 mins walk to our dinner spot. He, being somewhat of an expert in Indian/Pakistani food, loved the food and the atmosphere, and insisted that we would come back here again. And after that second visit - I will definitely come back despite the almost one hour commute via train and bus. I'd recommend it to everyone too - places like this don't exist everywhere in Chicago.

Indian food is usually not available 24 hours/day, and I'm pretty sure that this is one of the very few places that is (that I know of) I laugh at all the other reviews commenting on poor service, because that can be solved with a simple phone call and by placing the order by phone. That way you have a good 15-20 minutes to get there, pay, and leave. However, if you don't plan ahead, expect a wait time of roughly 15 minutes (regardless of what you ordered, for the most part). A safe bet that pretty much EVERYONE loves, no matter if you're American OR Indian, is the butter chicken (or 'chicken makhani') and a few pieces of naan, porottha or chapathi (in order of most favorite bread to less favorite). Samosas are also a good go-to appetizer. If you're REALLY craving some food, their menu is pretty big, and you could look at the biryani plates that have a lot of rice and meat. I like this place so much, I plan on bringing my parents here eventually (which they'll love since they're south Indian). They do have plenty of seating area, but expect a pretty middle eastern/late night crowd depending on what time you go.

2012-03-30,1.0,"Scammy scam scammers, shame on you. This review is painful to write. I have been enjoying Ghareeb Nawaz for years--for the same reasons cited in all of the 5-star reviews. The food is good and cheap! If I'd written a review before tonight--before a half hour ago, even--believe me I would have given it five stars. The reason for my sudden dissatisfaction is as follows: Tonight I ordered a number of dishes for carryout. The total came to $20.75. I handed one of the the two cashiers standing behind the counter a $20 bill I had in my hand (cash only) and said ""let me get you the $0.75"" as I reached into my bag for my change purse. As I looked up, I asked how much it would be to add a container of something that was piled near the register (a fruit curry, the cashier said). He said ""$3 more"" (thus, a total of $23.75). So I handed him the other $20 I had in my hand and said ""OK, sorry, I don't have any dollar bills."" He took the second $20 and said ""now you owe me $3.75."" ""But I just gave you a total of $40,"" I protested. He pulled out the cash drawer, with my second $20 as the only $20 bill in the drawer, and said ""see, it's the only $20 in here. You didn't give it to me."" Both cashiers continued to insist I hadn't, and I continued to insist I had, to the point that people in line behind me began to ask what was wrong. I know that one of the two cashiers took my first $20--whether it was pocketed or not, I don't know, but it happened while I was looking in my bag for my change purse. If anything, the excuse that there was only one $20 bill in the till of a cash-only restaurant at dinnertime, with a solid, constant line of customers waiting to eat and a full dining room, is a very flimsy one. Seeing as they were not going to admit what they'd done and give me back my second $20, I took a step back and waited for my number to be called. There's a monitor displaying the images taken by security cameras posted throughout the restaurant, so when I walked out with my food I called the City of Chicago Police nonemergency line to ask what I should do. The officer with whom I spoke insisted they couldn't do much, that something like that was more of a small-claims-type issue. I've seen enough of The Wire to know that if I did that and tried to get them to review the tape, it wouldn't happen for days and the restaurant would insist that they either didn't keep any tapes or they zeroed out the recording each day. End of story, Ghareeb Nawaz made an extra $20 off of me. And in the end, they didn't even include the naan I'd ordered. Maybe I should be content with the fact that over the years we've ordered so much food from this restaurant--so much food for so little money--that an extra $20 comprises a dollar or two extra for each past visit. However, the fact that they so obviously pulled a con, and with such apparent ease as though it was hardly the first time they'd done it, was infuriating. tl;dr: Pay in exact change and don't take your eyes off your money or they will steal it from you.",-0.357,0.911,0.044,0.045,0.44526143790849687

2012-02-12,2.0,"Heard and read enough good things about this place and having a love for Indo-Pak food, thought to give it a try the other week. If there is anything I could agree with everyone on, it would be the price. Ghareeb Nawaz is cheap. And that's where it stops. Two stars only because I thought the food was average at best, but has the potential of being so much better. For starters, I'd suggest they cook using fresh oil and not serve day(s) old food reheated. At least that is how the flavors came across to my wife and I. We ordered one each of the following dishes to share, in order to get an idea of the food quality: Chili Chicken, Chicken Biryani and Beef Nihari. The chicken dishes tasted about average, maybe just above, for what they are, while the beef was tender, though a little salty. Reheats is where the problems come in. The chicken dishes tasted stale, old and the nihari was coated in thick, salty grease. From my experience, that speaks to old, dirty cooking oil, sub-par ingredients and too many left-overs being served up as the next day's lunch/dinner. Which explains why it's sooooo cheap. CHEAP shouldn't mean STALE....DIRTY....GREASY....SALTY. We can all get that from any major fast food chain. Maybe it was an off day. Maybe my standards are too high. I might give the place another try. But then I just might opt to spend a little more and shoot for a buffet from either Tiffin or Punjabi Dhabha.",0.7266,0.885,0.071,0.044,0.5382638888888889

It was mainly ordered for my two year old boy because it is probably the mildest dish there.  We asked for it to be not spicy too and it wasn't.  It was a big amount for just a couple bucks.  Awesome!  Then the chili chicken boti paratha was what I ate.  I liked the wrap part a lot.  It was better than the regular naan.  We left the place bellies stuffed and a box for the leftover biryani.  It was too much amount for my son hehe.  But it was delicious the next day for lunch!

I ordered the daal, lentil soup, and it was nicely seasoned and a good amount for what i paid.  if I had gotten some naan, which i should have, that's a meal right there.  but I also ordered the goat biryani.  I do enjoy a good goat and this goat was quite tender and came in large amount.  It' came with a white sauce that you pour all over it and it helped make the rice more moist and add some extra flavor.  For paying less that $10 i got a ton of food, enough for 2 or 3 meals even. Though that didn't stop me from trying the other dishes my friends ordered.  the masala was excellent and so was the other briyani my friend had. I think this is a cash only operation, but there's an ATM there.  Also there are a bunch of pop's in a fridge that you can grab.  I think next time I'll order a lassi cuz I think that was available.

Indian food is probably my favorite cuisine, but I typically avoid the Devon restaurants because in general I find the driving/parking situation down there too stressful to deal with.  A friend clued me in to this amazing little spot slightly outside the main Devon corridor.  Four of us visited for lunch on  a Sunday.  First off - I was able to easily get parking right down the street.  Already, this trip was off to a better start than my Devon adventures tend to be.  When I walked in and saw the menu board I could not believe the prices - entrees top out at $4.99 which is about one fifth the prices at the other Devon Indian restaurants. I opted for the palak daal lentils and spinach ($2.99), rice ($1) and naan ($0.50).  So lunch was right about $5.  You can't go to Burger King for that!  With prices this low, I was expecting tiny portions or iffy quality but I was shocked - portions are huge, I could easily have gotten two meals out of my order and my food was delicious.  I snagged a bit of the lamb biryani and it was also incredible.

Another plus is that the bathrooms are clean, a rarity in even ""nicer"" Indian restaurants I've been to.

My boyfriend and I ordered 3 dishes, 4 pieces of naan and a desert, it was only $19. Today we got lunch, 2 dishes, 2 naan and desert...$11!! You can't beat the prices and it allows you to try new things guilt-free. So far, I've had Chana Chicken, Butter Chicken, Grilled Chicken, Mutton Daal and deserts Kheer and Double Ka Meetha. Everything I've had has been great. Portions are enough for leftovers. I would say it's pretty spicey but I also consider myself a novice with spicey food, and it wasn't overpowering. Nothing I've had here is the least bit bland. Very good flavor, the meat is all very tender... try it now!! I'm sure they're open! :)",0.9868,0.841,0.159,0.0,0.668423520923521
2011-04-04,4.0,"I was VERY hungry and in the mood for Indian food. A quick search of the Yelps came up with a charming sounding place called Ghareeb Nawaz. Promising. Before I made my mind up, however, I had to consult my Desi council. I sent a text to Preet (""Don't do it homes! You're gonna get shanked!""), Payal (""Umm, are you sure?"") and Krsna (no response) and decided that it was the right move! Ordinarily, this tale would be packed with emotion-churning hubris. I would have learned a lesson, tears would be shed, a tertiary character would have met a sad fate, and I would have emerged stronger, wiser and hungrier for the experience. But, what's that? It's a new dawn and new day. This time around, I make the rules and I decide to go with my gut: Ghareeb is teh (yes, teh) awesome. Is it high-end? No. Would you woo/impress a potential underpants shower by a trip here? Depends. Will you be able to eat two meals worth of tasty Indian food for less than $10? Yes. Oh, yes!! And, in these hard times, isn't that all you need to know?  I guessed it was authentic when I was one of four non-Desis I spied during my time here. I assumed it was cheap when I couldn't get a seat but for 4536336 college kids pigging out in every.single.booth. I knew it was no longer a scary place when I tripped over two strollers and was forced into my happy place thanks to the wails of unhappy babies/toddlers. I was in the right place. The front counter is a bit confusing. There's lots of pushing and shoving and there doesn't appear to be much of a system. My best advice is to get in where you fit in and be ready with your order. I used my attributes to my advantage (bony elbows and side-eyes of steel) to force my way to the front and ordered biryani rice ($1.99), two samosas ($1), naan ($.50) and chili chicken ($4.99). The clerk took it and moved to the next guy. Ugh! I forgot the lassi. Oh well. There'll be next times. After an appropriate wait (long enough to make me think my food was being freshly prepared but not so long that I got angry), I took my bounty home and feasted. The rice was fragrant and well-prepared. I could have eaten 4 samosas. Each one was packed with a delicious potato puff. Naan is naan (except when it's nasty) and my chili chicken was tasty. The heat index wasn't insane, but there was copious amount of cubed chicken and the spice profile was decent. Indeed, I had enough of all my food choices to warrant making another meal out of them. That's saying a lot when you're as dead sexy as I am. Perhaps I need to request hotter and spicier next time. Yes, there will be a next time. It's 24 hours, y'all.",0.9811,0.817,0.119,0.064,0.5769267014164972

Easy, hop in the car/bus and go get what you need from Ghareeb Nawaz! As every other reviewer has already mentioned, everything on the menu is under 5$.   If it's your first time eating there, and you aren't too familiar with Indian food, be sure to grab a menu from the front desk first, 'cause it explains what's in each dish better than the pictures on the Wall Of Food menu above the cash register. (Also, next time you can order your food over the phone and just run in to pick it up!) Be warned, culinary wusses might find the food to be rather spicy. If you are one of these poor souls, you might want to purchase some Kheer (a rice-pudding-like dish, made with vermicelli noodles). It is yummy and kills the burn. (They've got it on the top shelf of the soda cooler.) The food is super-tasty, nicely spiced and PLENTIFUL. You WILL be taking home leftovers, unless you are REALLY hungry. I had the Chickpea Chicken, some Nan, a samosa and Kheer when I was there last week and thought every dish was outstanding.  I also tried one of the drinks made on site, which seemed to be apple juice with  lime wedges and mint leaves floating in it. I liked it. Oh, one last thing. This is not a place to bring a date for a quiet evening of conversation, if your goal is impressing them with your sophisticated tastes. The place is nice and clean, but busy, loud and cold in the winter. I'm pretty darn broad-minded, but the chaotic atmosphere was not to my taste for a dine-in experience. Also, FYI, the only parking is on the street, so you may have to park a block or more away. Update 1/29/12:  Okay, I've been intrigued by the ""Gyros Marsala"" for some time. Well today I decided to give it a try, I mean, I like Gyros, I like Marsala. Why not? Turns out, it is really good! (And a bit spicy.) Be aware, if you want to go for for a gyros like-experience, you have to buy a side order of paratha or naan, cause the dish consists of JUST the masala, with some yogurt and raw onion slices.",0.9783,0.845,0.117,0.038,0.5856472109761582

The place epitomizes dive and is reminiscent both in terms of the food and atmosphere to the Indian places I grew to love while studying in Malaysia.  The counter order, tacky decor, the constant cricket matches on TV, and of course the food comprise a pleasurable, laid back experience.  People are always coming in and out, even in the wee hours near closing time, but service is always fast and friendly.

2010-08-13,5.0,"I have been going to Ghareeb Nawaz for a few years now.  When I first started going, I was one of the few non-Indian/Pakistani customers whenever I went to the establishment. The place was a really basic setup, and there was some Islamic influence on the decor of the place. Today the restaurant has been remodeled. Everything is much cleaner and they got rid of their old bench and table setup for some real chairs. The place has just changed so much, there is a lot more variety in their customers as well. Now, the most important part of any review: THE FOOD! If there's one thing that hasn't changed at Ghareeb, it's the delicious food and consistently low prices. Before getting into specifics, let me tell you that the food here is SPICY. I don't mean chili pepper spicy (Although some of them are that kind of spicy too), but spicy as in flavored. You may have gone to some Indian restaurants that toned down the flavors for a more weak-tongued customer base, well not Ghareeb. The food is very flavorful and authentic. You may want to be careful the first time around! The most popular dishes are the Biryani and Paratha dishes. The Biryani dishes usually come along with a choice of meat, from Lamb, Chicken, Boneless Chicken, beef, or more! If you have a tongue that can handle it, I highly recommend the Chili Chicken Biryani. It is by far my favorite dish on the menu, and is very yummy, I promise! The Paratha is a flat-bread, kind of like the Pakistani/Indian version of a pita. It's very different though! The bread is so good you can eat it by itself, but usually you order it with some meat. If you order it to go, they wrap the meat up in the bread like a sandwich. For $3, you won't get such a big sandwich anywhere in Chicago. There are a lot of choices for Paratha. A good one is Hunter Beef,. which is heavily seasoned sliced beef. Another interesting one is Kheema, which is ground meat. It's the Pakistani version of Taco meat, and damn is it good. Ghareeb is often great but sometimes you will notice the food cooked a bit differently. This is just because of the chef rotation, the food is always going to be good though!  If you can handle authentic food cooked Pakistan style, Ghareeb is the place for you. There is a good chance you may not like certain things on the menu, I recommend starting your way from the Biryani rice and meat dishes and working your way into the various curry they offer.

Anyway.  The palak dal and green chile chicken.  How can I describe the wonderfulness of these two dishes?  They're not meant to go together, I don't think, but they do, perfectly.  The chicken is very, very fresh... fresh enough that describing it that way would immediately come to mind.  It's cooked hot and fast and greasy with a spicy slick of green chile sauce, and is just all around unimprovable.  Except maybe by dipping it in the fiery, veggie-filled dal, in which you may unearth whole peppers if you're not careful.  This dal can be eaten as soup, if you're brave, or scooped up with the buttery, crispy-edged naan that costs something like 50 cents for a huge slab of it. This combination, which easily feeds two people, will run you about $8.50.  For $4 per person, I challenge you to find a more well rounded, tastier meal for miles around.",0.9945,0.742,0.218,0.04,0.6545977011494252

2010-06-07,5.0,"There's a ton of things that I love about being a south sider. There's typically easy parking, good Chicago BBQ joints, cheap bars, the White Sox, tons of taco joints, China Town, and the list goes on. However, not much indian food to be had. Which is precisely why when the boy and myself found ourselves on Devon ave a couple of weeks ago, I demanded that we have indian for dinner.  So our journey started at roughly Devon and Ashland. As it was a beautiful day I suggested the we stroll west, as I had no real game plan on where to go. By the time we got to Hoyne, I was getting tired. That's quite a bit of walking for this gal, as I am extremely lazy. So I see this hole in the wall looking joint and figure what the hell. The boy pulls out the handy dandy iphone and checks out the yelp reviews. 4 stars for roughly 90 reviews? Let's do this.  After perusing the picture menu board, here's what we decide on. butter chicken with biryani, chili chicken, aloo palak, a couple of samosas, two orders of naan, and two cans of pop (they had Squirt, SCORE!) Everything was absolutely delicious. Now, I'm no indian food expert, but I knows what I likes. And me likey very much. The butter chicken was super moist and the sauce was rich and creamy without the greasiness that sometimes comes along with it. The chili chicken had a great smokey flavor and the rice was amazing. The samosas were pretty good, albeit, not made fresh to order. The giant naan for fifty cents? word. Only thing that I didn't so much care for was the aloo palak. It was alright, I mean I ate it. But I prefer the aloo gobi, of which they were out. *sad face* .  All of this grub ran me $21 and some change. For reals. The portions were ginormous! I mean, stuffed my face until I was about to burst, and had plenty left over for another gut busting meal. I will for sure go back. And I'll probably take the red line so that I'm forced to walk.

Green chili chicken: very cilantroy and spicy but is a much milder flavor than the other dishes so it can get drowned out. Great if you have a fresh palate and not tainted by other super salty, spicy dishes.  Lamb Curry: sometimes I LOVE, sometimes...I don't. Sometimes it's too gamey and becomes hard to handle. The sauce is plentiful and great to mix with the other curries. Butter chicken: again, like the green chili chicken, it's a less explosive than my other favorites but still very good. Lots of sauce, which is always a plus for me. Fish dish: flavorful and good...but I can't eat it as leftovers, too fishy smelling, I dont' want my co-workers to hate me.

Since my husband gets home at 11:30 pm, and we recently crave only Indo-Pak food, this seemed like the perfect place to go (11 miles away from home, but who cares?). Guess what? The value of the food completely offsets the gas lost in the trip, and the carbon footprint we leave by going there around two times every week.  We absolutely adore the Seekh Kabab Paratha, Aloo Palak and Chana Masala. The Naan is, of course, great and it is always big and fresh. The Mango Lassi is good. If I were to be picky, I would say that it needed more actual mango for thickness, but I'm satisfied with what I get. Other places charge at least $4 for their Mango Lassi, so I'm cool with that. Anyone, who complains about service: this is not a place to go if you want to get pampered. If you're in store for that- go to five star restaurants and let the waiter charm you silly. First of all, those guys are quite pleasant, you just need to take in the atmosphere of the place. Keep in mind this is not McDonald's, where they're required to smile.

Alright, the food. I just bought 2 Chicken Boti Parathas and what feels like 2 pounds of Chicken Biryani for EIGHT DOLLARS. The Chicken Boti comes in a soft, fresh-made, and i believe buttered, paratha. The chicken is roasted in spices and has some veggies i'm not sure i can identify. Whatever. It's one of the most delicious things you can put in your mouth. One of them will fill you up AND it's only 2.50. They tend to run out of the lamb biryani pretty fast, so today I got chicken. Normally, there's still bones mixed in with the rice, so be open minded.

2007-05-13,3.0,"The prices at this place are absolutely insane.  $3 tax included (and as far as i can tell no tip expected) for most entrees.  You can get stuffed here for cheaper than a Subway daily special. However, and I debated whether or not to include this detail, you stand a 50/50 chance of experiencing Ghareeb's Revenge (tm me) the next day, so make sure you're going to be at home.  The symptoms are mild and unidirectional, so for the price of the food I for one will deal with the subsequent, er, discomfort, albeit only once in a while. EDIT: One other annoying aspect.  On any given day for lunch at least half the menu will not be available.  Last time I called, no butter chicken, no kofta masala, etc.  LAME!",-0.933,0.792,0.051,0.157,0.5220342522974102
2007-04-22,4.0,"I remember eating at Usmania (read: U.S. Mania!) and looking at the prices thinking ""why is this so expensive?"" when I remembered that the only indian place I ever go to is Ghareeb Nawaz. You know this place is good when the place is always packed, and there are about 11 cabs parked outside on the street. However, if you have never eaten Indian food before or are not interested/excited about trying new things, you probably should not come here. The biriyani plates they give you (which look like prison dinner trays) have what looks very undesireable (unless you know what it is) as a sauce and I remember the first time having it thinking ""Hmm, am I really this adventurous?"" But wow it is good. For about $5 you can get the equivalent food amount of 1.75 chipotle burritos. They leave all the bones in there, so be careful if you're not used to that. I can't really compare it to anything other than U.S. Mania and I like this place better. Go.",0.9385,0.865,0.11,0.025,0.5475252525252526
2007-04-19,5.0,"This place is the gem on Devon in Chicago.  Its name means ""poor man"" in Urdu.  If you got a couple of bucks, that will do you right.  The Gyro-paratha (greek gyro meat, indian spiced) is great, as it the spicy chicken paratha.  The Biryani is also good and enough for 3 people to eat for less than $5.  There is a Masjid in the back for the cabbies that wait in the long lunch and dinner lines. So listen, this is how it is.   Go. It's fantastic.  Get two (yes two) parathas.  I recommend the gyro-paratha.  Get one to go, and one for there.  The to go paratha will be wrapped up like a burrito.  The one for there is served on a steel plate with everying in little compartments.  You really have to experience and enjoy one of each.   Its phenomenal.",0.9403,0.856,0.124,0.02,0.46682539682539687

2007-04-01,3.0,"I probably won't bring the Queen (of England) for Indian/Pakistani food to this place next time she's in town, but don't let that deter you. So what if it's ghetto and ""full of foreigners and cabbies"" (as a reviewer wrote)? I see that as a sign that a place may actually have decent food, and Ghareeb Nawaz does. I am noooo where close to being and Indian/Pakistani food connoisseur, but I know what I like, and I like this place. True, they don't have too much of a varied menu, or a large selection of desserts, or m-a-n-g-o lassi (blasphemy! I took off one star because of that), and yes, they serve the food on a metal tray that is best suited in front of an inmate over at County Jail, but you know what? The food can actually be quite tasty, and you can't beat the large portions for dirt-cheap prices! I had the chicken biriyani plate for lunch and not only did I enjoy it, but I had enough left over for dinner! For $3!! My friend got the chicken paratha, and that was pretty darned good as well. I guess it's open 24hrs too... bonus!! As some of the other reviewers noted, it's probably not the best place to take someone you want to impress. Before going, mentally prepare yourself for ""hole-in-the-wall"", if you're not used to eating in places like that, in which case you need to open up your mind because you are missing a world of hella good food! And they take cash only, so make sure you go to the ATM before hand. Will I be going back? Heck, I just ate there again!",0.9964,0.768,0.212,0.02,0.4599206349206349

Everything on the menu is dirt cheap. Naan for 50 cents! man, that is a crazy deal. This is a greasy ass spoon. I wouldn't say its great. Once in awhile, its good, or like I said, you're drunken. If someone brought you here on a date, that person is a cheap ass date. Hah. Biriyani is allllright. The tri-colored kind. I'd stay away from food you see on display that isn't covered. Samosa is ok, but avoid the chicken, unless they just made it. Great place to find all kinds of foreigners and Cabbies.",-0.1996,0.753,0.114,0.133,0.7083333333333334
