They have numerous beer offerings. The menu is fairly plentiful. And it's all authentic faire. The brats are great. I absolutely love the potato salad.

2017-06-03,1.0,"If I could give ZERO stars I would. Resi's Bierstube. What happened? I had such and awful experience there last night when I went with my friends for dinner and drinks. I understand they were busy, but then they should bring in more waitstaff. So we were waiting some time before our order was taken. Dirty glasses were left on your table and never removed, we had to move them ourselves and they still never took them away. Then once the waiter came, I asked for waters and we ordered drinks and food. About 15-20 minutes later, there was still no water on a hot summer night. So I went to the front bar and had to flag down the female bartender as she didn't even notice me standing there and it wasn't even busy up front. I asked her for waters and joked that we were dying, obviously this is not literal as any idiot would understand that. She tells me: ""Oh you're dying, calm the fuck down."" Yes, she actually said that to a paying customer and continued to berate me as I grabbed the waters. Once back to our table the beers/drinks arrived and we just got up and left because of the awful treatment we received. We did go across the street to Laschet's Inn, and what a difference! We had water within 30 seconds without even asking for it and the service was fast, efficient, kind, and courteous. Resi's: just close down if you have a bad attitude and cannot pay enough waitstaff.

2017-02-02,5.0,"Resi's is a classic, last of a few dwindling German stalwarts left in the area. It's more of a tavern, with an amazing patio in the back. The food is cooked daily by the elderly German owner from family recipes, so it's as authentic as they come.  I've never had a bad meal here to be honest. In recent years they added some interesting new options to the menu. The goulash dinner is a very ample portion, with tender cuts of beef. Sausages come from Paulina Market, so the quality is top notch, local and fresh. Thuringer is my favorite. Spaetzle and kraut are homemade and excellent as well. Potato pancakes are excellent, one of the few better options than Laschets, which I also love.  Beer selection is predominantly German lager, typically 4-5 different pale lagers from Ayinger, Weihenstephaner, Paulaner, BBK, etc. Seasonals sometimes. Bottled selection has some obscure stuff, but the last couple 1809 Berliner Weisses have been a little old. They aren't big fans of US craft beer here, so don't expect much. Ask what's fresh on draft and you can't go wrong.  The main reasons to come here are the atmosphere, it's like a cozy time machine back to a simpler time. The patio is the best i've come across in my travels around the city. Shaded by trees and decorated with numerous flowerboxes and German beer lanterns. It's beautiful.

To make matters worse, the waitress was inattentive, frequently absent, unfriendly, and got our order wrong.  A master at avoiding eye contact!  The bartender tried her best to help out.  The waitress loudly blew her off with a ""whatever"" -- I would have fired her on the spot.  I do not speak enough German to know the word that is the opposite of gemutlichkeit, but that was our waitress.

2015-11-29,2.0,"I've been to Resi's twice now.  The first visit was a home run, which is why I give it 2 instead of 1.  Food and beers were excellent. The second visit was downright insulting.  Went with a friend to catch up, we went on a Wednesday evening, about 7;30 PM.  The place was half full.  We got seated.  There was a party of about 10-12 obnoxious people who then came in and sat at the bar and then eventually got moved to the long tables next to ours; but I'll get to that. Now to the experience.  My friend and I ordered, and it was our waitress who also had the table of the 10-12 people.  We put in our orders at roughly 7:40, after beers and scouting the menu.  I got the schnitzel with the soup of the day and my friend the leberkas and the potato salad. A little after 8, the group moves from the bar to the table and put their orders in.  We were still waiting.  20 minutes go by, 25, 30, and now its 8:50 PM and we haven't been served.  We tried flagging our waitress down several times, but she had our hands full with the party so we tried the bartender, who was no help.   Finally the waitress brings us lukewarm soup for me and a regular salad for my friend.  He realized it right away and tried to flag her down before she went off to let her know he had the potato salad, not the regular.  We then see her serve the party of 10-12 their meals, and at 9:05 our waitress came out and said ""sorry for the wait, it will only be a couple more minutes."" Several times we contemplated just getting up and walking out.  The food was good.  That's about as nice as I can put it.  We got no heads up of any delay, we got no heads up that the party I referenced a few times had ""priority,"" if it in fact did--I know some places let you know there's a party or event and at least warn you.  No signs, no heads up until a minute before our food came out that it was coming up.  It was a joke.   And it wasn't just us, it was the other couples and groups there that also suffered.  One could clearly see the frustrations on all of their faces.

2014-12-30,4.0,"As I write this long overdue review, winter has descended upon Chicago, the temperature has plummeted to a frosty 16 degrees, and I am casting my thoughts back to glorious summer, sitting in the back of Resi's Bierstube, in THE BEST BEER GARDEN IN THE CITY OF CHICAGO, enjoying a cool mug of German beer.   That's right.  This place has been here for a long, long time, and the beer garden in the back is (for whatever reason) not that well known.  Sadly, one of the 100 year old maple trees died a few years back, and the other one is in jeopardy.  And that hurts the ambiance a tad.  But let's be clear:  this beer garden is paradise. I recently wrote a review for a nearby Germany restaurant (Laschet's) which got a bit of attention.  But I owe it to Resi's to let everyone know why you need to come to Resi's Bierstube at least once (and if you do, you will come back, I promise you): 1) Best beer garden in the city of Chicago.  Unless you don't like real beer.  This is certainly one of the oldest beer gardens in the city. 2) Best Schnitzel in the city of Chicago (now that the Metro Club is long gone - Peppo, wo bist du?).  Big, huge portions of pork or chicken schnitzel (they even have turkey), cranked out of a tiny little kitchen on pans made before you were born, cooked perfectly (no gristle, which is more than I can say for a more famous place with a bigger rep further north on Lincoln), with or without gravy, and your choice of german potatoes (sliced and fried) or (more better) spaetzle. 3) Huge, fantastic German beer selection including rotating seasonal brews.  In this wonderland of micro-brews and craft beers, one can forget how outstandingly spectacular it is to sit back and sip a cold BBK or Bitburger on a sweltering August evening beneath the trees.  Or to have a choice of several different, authentic Marzen biers during Oktoberfest.  Prost! If you're going non-schnitzel, I recommend the Thuringer plate.  Comes with German bread (""brot"") and lovely brown mustard.   In the winter time, with the beautiful beer garden closed, this place is a bit more like your uncle Hans' basement:  vinyl floor tiles and fake wood paneling and (usually) some loud dudes arguing over sports or politics while the Blackhawks or Bulls are on TV in the background..  It's authentic and very un-glamorous, but I love it anyway. This place is as German as they come.  The waitresses tend to be long-tenured veterans, and in true German fashion, they don't fawn all over you.  So get over it!  It's not bad service, they're just not going to chat you up for 1/2 an hour because there are 25 other people waiting for their beer! Just hold onto that fabulous beer garden in your minds and we can all make it through the winter.

Perfect ambiance for a cold winter night! I tried the pork schnitzel (not the formal name) a giant pretzel (comes with cheese and spicy mustard) patty melt, potato salad, and potato soup. Delicious! LOVED the potato salad, it was kind of shredded with sauerkraut in it, the soup was thick and hearty and a good sized portion, the pretzel was HUGE and HOT with generous servings of cheese and mustard. Service was great! I would have sat at the bar but it was crowded with the regulars, so we were the first group to take a table around 8 pm on a Friday. Kristy - the waitress helped us choose from MANY German beers and said if we didn't like what we picked we wouldn't be charged...she also gave us free apfel shots after dinner. Super nice of her!

I'd love to give it a 5 star review for the delicious food, but it's a little pricey. Also, their hours are limited to late afternoon and evening. It's too bad because their beer garden is great!  For food, I highly recommend the potato pancakes. They are huge, so I also recommend sharing them. I also really like the snitzel. They have different kinds (pork, chicken, beef) with different kinds of sauce (sour cream based, mushroom based) and they are all thin and crispy. The sausages are always a good, safe bet, and they have all kinds. If you're willing to spend a little bit extra, the spaetzle are a great side (small noodle-dumpling like, if you're not familiar). I personally love the potato salad, but it's very vinegary so may not be for everyone. There are many German beers to try, and I believe there is just one type of wine. As I mentioned, the beer garden is great. It's small between a few buildings and has nice trees. It's almost like you are not right off of a busy road.  The service, especially at the bar, is nice.

I've been going to Resi's since about 1975.  And let me tell you, back then it was hard-core authentic German.  Serious memorabilia on the walls, German-speaking clientele, and the most amazing selection of German draft biers.  Russiche eier, hackepeter, and Jaegerschnitzel.  All cooked in the kitchen by one guy, in a space about the size of the galley on a U-Boat.  (Go to the U-505 and look to see what I mean.)   If you knew to ask, there was Poeschel snuff available behind the bar, brought back by patrons when they visited the old country.  And the backbar was decorated with all these collected bits of German kitsch; you could sit there all night reading it (if you know some German.)  And there were some truly arcane German liquors. And I'll never forget one Friday afternoon I got off work early and dropped in for a weissbier, only to walk into a get-together of old guys (well, they seemed old to me then) all singing songs I just knew weren't OK to sing in post-war Germany--and when I quietly asked, yes, they were a bunch of Army buddies who got together once in a while.  ""Which army?"" I asked, and got a look.  Ok... I've been going back on and off for the past 35 years, and noticed the slow but inexorable change.  The decorations got quieter, perhaps more politically correct (but much less interesting.)  The old guys disappeared.  The old guy in the kitchen (and I feel so bad I can't recall his name) passed on, and it took two people to replace him--but the menu still shrank.  Hackepeter is dangerous now, so that's out. But the killer for me was one day a few weeks ago when I was in, made a comment in German, and the waitress just looked at me.  Turned out she told me that nobody spoke German any more.  That's when I knew the Resi's I'd loved all those years had evolved into something else.  The backbar is still there; there's still an excellent draft selection (albeit less than it used to be.)  The food's still good, if not as wide a selection.  But something--some ineffable German spirit--has passed on, and it's just a very decent German-themed bar instead of the true German brauhaus it used to be.

The place does resemble a german pub with one exception. there didn't seem to be any actual Germans. they should have some slight German music in the background.

The table next to us seemed to be getting a lot more attention than our table.  Maybe because we had two kids with us.   My kids were really good and quiet though.  I'm not sure.  The food was tasty, but it took sooooo long to come to the table.  The kids were complaining for at least 20 minutes, not loudly, just to me.  I don't know, but maybe this place would be fun if you sit at the bar and have some beers and you have a lot of time on your hands to hang out.",0.9539,0.849,0.116,0.035,0.4447383891828337

I had no idea what to get on the menu, but everyone we were with recommended the Weisswurst dinner.  Trusting the locals, I went head in and was pleasantly surprised.  On my plate appeared three Weisswurst (a white veal and pork sausage), german potato salad, and sauerkraut.  Mixed together with copious amounts of brown mustard and a dash of horseradish, it was hot, sweet, and incredibly savory.  I hadn't had German food in the longest time, but this was definitely doing the trick.  Moreover, it paired really nicely with liter of black lager I got along with it, but of course you can pick any one of their many German beers on tap or bottled to go along with the food. It's very much a neighborhood and local kind of place: we were the only party in there for awhile, and then as we left, there were more people at the bar, a group of four guys near the front playing a board game over brewskis, and some one in the back enjoying a meal solo.  It's not pretentious, not terribly expensive, and the food really delivers.  Definitely worth a repeat visit next time I'm in town.",0.9886,0.803,0.157,0.04,0.4366666666666666

I imagine I'm not the first because they have a canned excuse for everything. ""Pork prices have increased"". ""People don't want rye bread with carry out"".  And the always popular: ""People have been asking us for smaller portions"", which may be true but....hmmmm... the price is usually adjusted accordingly.

Two of the beers were out so the waitress brought up two different beers without even asking, though she did apologize and tell them what they were drinking.

They served the meal with some lemons. After squeezing the lemons on the chicken, the lemon flavor got into the potato salad and made the taste 10 times better. The amount of chicken was huge.

Even my friends who like the food here have always been specific in what they've said was worth ordering at Resi's Bierstube. While the beer is good but that hardly makes a bar remarkable, particularly a German Beer House with plenty of local competition. The food has always seemed sub-par every time I've been here and, due to several of my friends enjoying their beer garden, this has amounted to at least 5 meals here.  My last dish here was a Hunter schnitzel dish with mushroom gravy and the meat was not overcooked (a first for me here) but the mushroom gravy/sauce was horrible... too heavy, too salty, didn't taste anything like mushroom, and good luck finding anything more than a few specs of mushrooms.  Service also tends to be VERY slow. The last time I visited, I was alone and sitting at the bar. My decision to stop turned out to be mildly masochistic on my part. I had to request my bill twice before I got any response and it still took 10 minutes for the waitress to hand me the bill. Despite the fact that I tried handing her my credit card at that point and her noticing, she never slowed and simply walked over to a customer at a table to have a loud conversation and then ignored me on her trips to and from the small kitchen but never actually returned to accept payment. I was left waiting a full 29 minutes before the bartender, not even the server (?!?) came over to collect my payment. By the way, although only employed once in my life, I have a 31-minutes and I walk policy for completely unwarranted awful service which they barely missed.

2008-12-21,4.0,"I was born and grew up in Austria, so I am making it my goal to try all the German and Austrian restaurants in Chicago. I loved the food at Resi's. First of all - it is the most authentic German food I have tried in Chicago so far. I had the schnitzl with German potato salad and it was good. The people I was with had schnitzl's in creamy sauces and they were absolutely delicious. Especially the ""Turkey schnitzl"" - which wasn't really a schnitzl but more like meat loaf but it was very tasty. Also the beer selection was great. I had checked the website before and I am glad I did because some of the beers were listed on the website but not on their menu. One of those beers was the Goesser Dark which is a very common, Austrian dark beer. They also have a large selection of white beers - German and Austrian. About the interior - I wouldn't say it was very traditionally German. There are some German posters on the wall but in general it looks more like an old American pub than a German restaurant. Also it was pretty expensive for a place like that and instead of Spaetzle or Knoedl, which is a more common German side dish they only had pasta. I heard they have a lovely beer garden which I will definitely check out in the summer. To sum it up - good food, a bit expensive, interior could be nicer.",0.9941,0.816,0.184,0.0,0.46312576312576315
2008-10-24,5.0,"I had not reviewed here? Oops. I was here on a Thursday night. I intended to have something to eat here before going on to another tavern in the North Central neighborhood. I do not have to inform you that Resi's has great beers on tap. I think they're all from Germany; i.e.; Austrian & Czech beers are available - but I want to scribe only in bottles. As it happened, I had only two beers [half-liters] on draft this night: the BBK Kutscher Alt, and the Warsteiner Oktoberfest. They were $6. What I ate was its special of the day: A steak patty smothered in gravy and mushrooms ($14.95). Other main courses, including any number featuring wursts, are $12.95. You have a choice of soup or salad. Having read previous reviews, I opted for the soup [cream of broccoli], and the mashed potatoes. (The potato pancakes seem to get raves, but they're only available a-la carte for $7.95. I was not going to spend that much.) The steak was good. It would get a three-star rating by itself. So what happened that I'm giving Resi's a five-star rating? It was another incident of me catching lightning in a bottle. This might not occur when you're here. At 7:00 pm, a gentleman named Joel, who it turned out, used to be the beer manager at Sam's Wine & Liquors [ yelp.com/biz/sams-wines-… , walked in, greeted Ron, our bartender, and set up a tasting of the mead [!] and beers (Flensburger) that his distributing corporation [Fox Deluxe Distr. Co. {!}] is handling.  (I must have 'beer radar' in my genes. I had no premonition that this was going to occur.) The mead he has is Redstone Meadery [Boulder, CO.] raspberry mead. It was a refreshing mead. The raspberry flavor was appropriate. The alcohol was present, but not overpowering. He also made a custom drink which he hopes will become a ""signature"" aperitif for Resi's based on the raspberry mead.  The Flensburger beers were a pilsner, a dark lager, and a hefeweiss; all in bottles (and regularly on offer at Resi's). I liked the dark lager. It had a slight malt taste which lasted throughout. There were only seven people in the venue. Joel spoke with them all. One table of four wound up purchasing bottles of the raspberry mead ($12) to take home. Hopefully, the data I printed on a bar napkin informing Joel on how to sign-up for the Chicago Beer Society E-Mail list, and the URL of the  beermapping.com  forum, will prove useful in helping him publicize other tastings he is conducting. What he uttered was that Fox Deluxe is a two-man operation. He has the city, and his associate has the suburbs. You can look for its offerings at Binny's [Ivanhoe] and Sam's [c.v.] Transit options: It is still the North Central neighborhood.

2008-07-21,3.0,"In Munchen steht ein Hofbrauhaus Eins, zwei, ... g'suffa! Resi's takes me back to German class in high school, which as close to Germany as I've ever been. It's a traditional beer hall crammed into a fairly small space on Irving Park Road. The hanging sign and cross-beamed plaster facade are unfortunately gone, giving it a more generic look, but inside it's all Deutsche. Big honkin' beer pulls anchor the bar, and the wall behind is crammed full of tchochkes. (Is it appropriate to use a Yiddish word in a German bar?) If you're lucky, you'll hear Beatles songs sung in German playing over the sound system. The menu is limited, and the German selections are primarily sausages and schnitzel. I had the Rahmschnitzel, which is schnitzel (breaded and fried pork tenderloin) served with sour cream mushroom gravy and buttered noodles. Breading and fat -- how can you go wrong? There's also Jagerschnitzel, which has mushroom gravy without the sour cream, and even a turkey schnitzel. Sausages include Bratwurst, Thuringer, Knackwurst, and Weisswurst. A handful of other German dishes -- potato pancakes, pickled herring, veal loaf -- fill out the menu, along with some Amerikanischer sandwiches. Dinners come with soup or salad. Do NOT get the salad. I wish someone had warned me. The soup was chicken rice, which didn't thrill me, but the salad was a plate of watery iceberg with tasteless dressing. Rye bread comes with your meal, but it's like the sliced Beefsteak rye you'd get at Jewel rather than anything traditional. The schnitzel and noodles were good, but they couldn't be bothered with the rest. If you're looking for dinner, go across the street to Laschet's for a much more satisfying meal. When it comes to beer, though, Resi's is ready to serve you. Their focus is on German beers, of course, and seemingly Weiss beers in particular, though this may be a seasonal thing. While some brands may be familiar to you -- Warsteiner, Hacker-Pschorr, Spaten -- most will probably be new. The bartenders are very knowledgeable, and even the servers -- who seem pretty indifferent most of the time -- can make some decent recommendations. I'm not enough of a beer geek to remember the names of any of the beers I drank, but they were all recommendations, and they were all excellent. Resi's has a beer garden out back, which is smallish, but great. They've replaced the picnic tables with smaller metal tables and chairs, so it's easier to reconfigure for different size groups. It's semi-secluded, and the big trees help take you away from the city. Warning: If there are a lot of Yelpers back there, it can get loud. If you sit inside, come early to get a sense of the regular clientele. Regulars are in and out all night, but later in the evening the crowd gets younger, and a little hipstery, which surprised me. The inside gets crowded, because there isn't much space between the bar and the tables, so expect people to be crawling over you all night. Grab a stool if you can -- they're fairly comfortable -- and make the narrow passage someone else's problem.",0.9911,0.849,0.108,0.043,0.4357355001320519

So that aside- on a recent sultry Summer's evening- I had a chance to go to Resi's with the Yelp Beer Garden Club.  My biggest concern?  Knowing that the only German food that I like is a big stein of German Beer and I knew that something else had to go in my stomach as well. Well- problem solved.  While Resi's has the traditional Germanic fare- they also have a menu of regular bar food, so one patty melt later I was ready to take on their beer list. A friend suggested a Spaten beer (crisp and refreshing) which was the perfect choice for the evening.  They have a wide variety of beers both on tap and in the bottle to suit most everyone's needs.  I'd stick to beer here as those who were drinking mixed drinks seemed to find the pours a little weak. The beer garden itself is pretty big with many tables scattered around.  The high fence and trees, however, pretty much keep any breeze from entering the space so you might want to go when the weather is a little more temperate or risk melting in the great outdoors.

We we just going to go in for one beer.  One beer turned into about six and we realized how wrong we were for ignoring this place for so long.  Resi's has a great German beer selection. Resi's has Augustiner, which according to my sources is pretty hard to find. Lots and lots of weiss beer too. The first time we went was a Sunday -- they get deliveries on Monday or Tuesday, so they were out of some of the beers we wanted to try. They had tons of other German options for us though.  Also, Resi's has some of the best potato pancakes you will ever eat. Crispy on the outside and deliciously slathered in sour cream and applesauce.   Great atmosphere. Some nights its empty and the juke box is all yours - if you can fight away the few regulars in there. But other nights there are a ton of people.  A pretty normal north center crowd.
