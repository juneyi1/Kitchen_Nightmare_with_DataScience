2017-08-26,1.0,"I went to Home Bistro tonight looking for a good dining experience and was instead met with an incapable server and an egotistical owner. After waiting five minutes to be acknowledged the server came over to the table and said ""are you ready?"" and things went downhill from there. Asa solo diner i was uncertain if i wanted an appetizer salad and entree or just an app and entree. I wanted to be able to gauge how hungry i was before placing the rest of my order. i understood that this could mean a delay in my order and i expressed that understanding. The server refused to take only part of my order and after considering how rude this was i asked for the owner who also refused to meet my needs as the customer. I ended up leaving without eating a thing. It seems to me that if you arent interested in taking care of your customers and you run a restaurant then you are in the wrong business. Its no wonder the place is nearly empty everytime i walk by.",-0.9399,0.83,0.033,0.138,0.6569444444444446

2017-08-09,1.0,"They sponsored a five course tasting menu for a special event on Monday 8/7/17, and this was the most disappointed I have been in a restaurant in the past 5 years. Reservations are required for this event, so you would think they could manage the crowd, the food, and the service. I've been to HB before and had mediocre meals, but the BYOB keeps me coming back. This bad experience has ensured I will never return to HB. It seems like when things go bad, they go really bad...and there is no attempt to correct the problem or keep customers happy.   The service was inattentive, cold, and not at all concerned with our experience. We were sitting there for 15 minutes with no attention from our server, so I flagged him down so that we could place our orders. I get that they are busy for a special event, but you would think they could staff it appropriately and plan in advance. The server had minimal communication with the table for the entire night.   The first course was an antipasto with whipped salted cod, olive oil, on a piece of bread. It was basically a salty piece of bruschetta, and the whipped cod is not particularly appetizing. Our server dropped a plate of four pieces at the table, made no mention of what the dish was, and immediately raced off. We had to flag him down, ask for four small plates so that we could share the appetizer. The waiter's response: ""sure, if we have any."" Is it too much to expect a restaurant to have clean dishes to use as sharing plates? We got another copy of the tasting menu because we realized that not every dish would be announced.   Second course was much better. Sausage dish was enjoyed by our friends. I ordered the swordfish crudo, with lemon, pistachio, and Calabrian chili. The flavor profile was nice, and the swordfish was fresh and delicious. This was the bright spot of our night.   Third course was awful. I ordered the tripe alla romana, with pancetta, garlic, san marzano tomatoes, and mint. I had never ordered tripe before, so this was partially my own fault for not asking more questions. Tripe is part of the cow's stomach, so buyer beware. My friend is from London, and told me that tripe is usually served tender and can be quite delicious. However HB's tripe was tough, chewy, and tasted as if it was straight out of a fear factor gross-eating competition. It also smelled like it was cow stomach. Ok, so maybe tripe is not my thing.   I flagged down the waiter, told him that I didn't enjoy the dish and asked if it could be swapped out for another salad instead. His response: ""we're running out of food, so there's nothing we can do."" A restaurant running out of food...hmmm. When you run out of a special dish or two, they get removed from the menu. When you run out of food, you close the doors for the night. Any other restaurant would have offered you something else, taken it off the bill, whatever. Some sort of gesture to show that they care about your dining experience. Instead the waiter immediately cleared the tripe dish away without asking me if I was finished with it. If I'm stuck with paying for the dish, I would have at least let my friend pick at the pancetta bits.   Fourth course was the entrée, and this was mediocre. I ordered the orecchiette with wild board pancetta, rapini, chili flakes, pecorino. This dish had some much potential, but...my portion came out with 12 noodles, three pieces of broccoli rapini, and 6 pieces of pancetta. The flavor was decent; the portion was miniscule. It was so obviously under-portioned on such a large dinner plate! I didn't even bother complaining at this point, because I know I would get some absurd line about how a restaurant with pre-planned reservations was ""running out of food"". Resistance is futile, and I think our waiter may have been the manager also. On the way out we saw someone served a plate with at least double the amount of orecchiette.   For the ending, we were served goats milk cheese with honey and figs. And also some cannoli's. They were decent, but small, and at that point we are just looking to get out of here. I was so hungry that we had to stop for fast food on the way home; this was also a first.   Overall, the five course menu was extremely underwhelming. For $50, your money goes much further at other restaurants. You could tell HB was trying to be fancy with their menu, but a lot of the dishes were bland and boring. Perhaps the exotic ingredients were contributing to the cost, but the flavor did nothing to justify the price. Horrible service destroys the experience, regardless of the food. We will not be going back.",0.9789,0.833,0.098,0.069,0.548686563827409

2017-06-28,1.0,"We were so excited to try a restaurant in Boystown with such high reviews (hard to find GOOD food in Boystown).  We did not have reservations but the hostess said she could seat us, as there were no reservations until 7:30pm (this was at 6:10pm and there were only 3 tables occupied).  Immediately after we were seated, I ran across the street to get wine and asked the others at our table to order appetizers.  I returned to find that they did not place the appetizer order, as they didn't allow them to.  The server said that we had to order everything at one time.. very odd, but okay.  We ordered and food came out fairly promptly.  The meal was solid and we were, overall, happy with our food.  Now comes the issue.. It's now 7:23 and we ask for a dessert menu.  The server says (while still walking) that we could not order dessert because they needed the table at 7:30.  I was sure I didn't hear him correctly, but (as stated) he said this while walking away so I asked him to come back over.  I asked again about dessert and he said we could not have dessert as they needed the table for a 7:30 reservation.  Now, I completely understand honoring reservations. However, we ordered with plenty of time to be served AND there were 3 other open tables at the time!  I asked for the hostess, who told me the same thing and handed me our check.  UNBELIEVABLE!!  No matter what, they were focused on having that particular table open at 7:30.  Now, there were 3 other tables open at the time.  Plus, what are the chances that all 4 reservations will show up at exactly 7:30.  And how many times do you check in at a restaurant for your reservation and they tell you it will be just a few minutes before your table is ready.. it happens all the time!  I just cannot understand why (I don't want to say it was race, but I saw no other people of color in there, unlike our mixed party).  We left, leaving VERY upset.   Naturally, I walked back past this place at 7:40.. 15 minutes after we were kicked out.  Guess what.. still 2 tables open!!  Needless to say, they won't take any more money from me.",0.9193,0.869,0.082,0.05,0.4507807807807809

Homemade Fettuccini and pancetta sounded so good, but the pasta was extremely pasty and very very Al dente! Very little flavor even with the pancetta.  How can a chef blow pasta?   Caesar about par to the Olive Garden.

We were underwhelmed with each dish. The beet salad had good quality ingredients intended to compliment each other; baby softly pickled beets, fennel and peanut butter crumble (I think). Good effort yet disappointing in flavor.  Escargot had a rich sauce with stewed m tomatoes.  It was good, snails were cooked great and not chewy.  Cauliflower and cheese fritters were little and fried and served with mayo (aioli). They had inedible strings in the batter. So onto 4 entrees to share between my critics; salmon, chicken sandwich, mussels and oxtail goulash. Initially flavors stimulated taste buds but after digging in and consuming our entrees, taste buds ended up being consumed by sodium.  Prolly course salt or sea salt, but too much salt nonetheless.  Portion control of the servings didn't even hold up against the toss of salt.  Flakey salmon steak was a little great cut cooked through exceptionally, but had a heavy over seasoned crust.  Served atop of fresh black beans, blanched sweet potatoes? (Maybe) and green sofrito.  Chicken sandwich was the bomb served in between pretzel buns with a honey mustard and peanut sauce. Truffle fries accompanied with mayo (aioli) and we couldn't tell they were truffled.  Beer mussels were an epic disappointment lacking sauce and sop.  Loving the richness of oxtail goulash mixed with some kind of little pastas and a dollop of sour cream.

Cozy (perfect for 2-4 people, might be less enjoyable for a bigger group because of small space and general background noise level that would make it difficult to have a conversation across a table with a large group of people), casual vibe with well-prepared food.

Forgettable. -Baby beets: favorite appetizer! Perfectly cooked golden and red beets with goat cheese  Main dishes: -Amsterdam style mussels: I can eat endless amount of oysters and mussels until my stomach hurts. This was the very first time I left more than 1/3 of mussels ever in my life. Maybe I was already full from appetizers but the flavor just wasn't there and mussels weren't plump at all. Fries with garlic aioli were very good though. -gnocchi with lamb meatball and mustard seeds: excellent dish, hearty but not too heavy. -my friend ordered pork belly (special of the day) and he seemed to like it. I was stuffed up to the ears after the meal!! I'm still curious about escargot, pork cheek and trout but there's always a next time!",0.9866,0.758,0.163,0.08,0.5560162601626017

We did a prix fixe menu where the table picked 3-4 appetizers, entrees, and desserts to share. The sizes were quite generous, but the food was hit or miss. Starting at the beginning, I wouldn't order their potatoes: they literally come only drizzled with mayonnaise and ketchup, as one might expect at a low-scale diner. Moreover, I'd be quite weary when it comes to their salads. The first one we got was so spicy that we had to send it back. At first, I figured the chef must have accidentally used cayenne pepper, and a heavy hand at that, in lieu of regular pepper. Turns out, the chef was ""experimenting."" They kindly replaced the salad, but the new salad was the saltiest thing I've had in week. I can't explain how salty it was. Imagine a salt mine. Oh look, I explained it. I wish I could help more, but my memory starts to get hazy from the BYOB, so I'll leave it here.",0.923,0.833,0.117,0.05,0.46346683619410894

My girlfriend was excited about the great natural light near the window, which was perfect for photographing the food. (Priorities, right?)  I ordered the Chinese fried chicken hash, which was surprisingly filling and generously portioned with a big, deep bowl. I also sampled the veggie burger, which was house-made. I'm a big meat-eater, but it was honestly very tasty and definitely something even I would enjoy eating. The fries were great, as well.  They brought out several freshly-made caramel-glazed doughnuts with cinnamon sugar out--complimentary--to help us celebrate our anniversary. The doughnuts were fluffy, very fresh, piping hot, and the perfect complement to our meal. I was still salivating over other menu items because they all sounded great.

I was seated and set up right away with my water and wine though I was the only person from our party to arrive very early.  The menu is trendy/unique/upscale without totally breaking the bank. Their entrée menu was recently updated so it was hard to ask for suggestions from the waiter.  4 girls shared 2 appetizers. The artichoke and edam cheese fritters was rather disappointing...it was under salted and flavorless. there wasn't a lot of garlic aioli either. I don't think any of us preferred it. The garlic and escargot was pretty good. it would have been better the portion was a bit bigger for sharing.  I ordered the milk poached haddock. I didn't care too much for the lightly flavored fish itself but I liked all the accompaniments like the hearty latkas. it felt like the dish could have used some tartness to round out the taste. 1 friend got the trout which was quite crisp and tasty when I tired it. the other girls seemed to enjoy the beef heart- this was my 1st time trying it and I found it only slightly chewy but it didn't have any adverse after taste...so I guess that's good.    overall it's probably 3.5.

When we arrived they let us know that a private party was planned for that night. We were stuck in a cubby hole like space next to two other groups and it was very crammed and uncomfortable, very irritating and non-romantic. The place is small as it is. We ordered the dates, caesar salad, salmon and mussels. The dates were good but over the top rich, caesar was swimming in dressing and hard to eat because too much dressing, the mussels were cooked well but the broth was bad. It tasted like straight up white wine and was very under seasoned. The salmon was also cooked well but also under seasoned and nothing special. The truffle fries that came with mussels were amazing. So french fries were the highlight of the meal. I won't recommend this place to anybody and won't be back. Anniversary fail.",0.8457,0.72,0.16,0.119,0.4443460317460318

After reading all of the positive yelp reviews for this place I made a reservation for me and three friends not familiar with Chicago to eat here on Friday night. Deciding we were not that hungry we ordered 3 appetizers to split among the table. Our waiter was incredibly rude and made a remark about us only ordering appetizers. At 8:15 the manager came over and stated that since we did not order that much food they were going to need us to leave within 30 minuets. We had just opened our bottles of wine as it is a BYOB restaurant, they rushed out our appetizers and brought the check at the same time they brought out our food. 10 minuets after our food came they tried to take our plates away before we were even done eating and asked us to please hurry.

Single. Dish. looked amazing.  The general consensus at my table was that everyone was jealous they didn't order the mussels entree.  It is a massive bowl of mussels that comes with an equally massive bowl of fries and handmade aioli sauce.  In reality, no one was disappointed with their dish, and everyone agreed they would be back to try something different. For appetizers we got the escargot and patatas bravas.  The escargot, while delicious, turned out to not be a great option for sharing, and the patatas bravas turned out to be both delicious and great for a group of 6.

He is an amazing chef and awesome person, but this review is not about him (well, kind of is, but stick with me), it's about the food and ambiance. Mm-mm the food. Yay the ambiance.  I had just moved to Chicago from LA. I took a trip to HB and dined on a multi-course meal of sheer deliciousness. I begged my cousin for every recipe, but he couldn't share secrets obviously, so I have resided to return over and over and over and over again, until I'm dead and buried (or cremated, jury's out). HB is small but in a warm and welcoming sort of way. The exposed brick and lighting make you feel like you're at a friend's house with more of your friends and some of their friends. The staff is amazing and friendly, like they're your friends. This place just makes me think of friends. It's a good friend of mine. Good friend. I really love it because you can have conversations with people and not feel like you have to yell. It's not overly quiet. It's the perfect mix of peace and energy.  I'm so proud of my talented cousin following his dream. To think of him doing anything else brings tears to my eyes, but in the SELFISH sort of way because... delicious food.

My friend and I were there for 2 hours and 10 minutes, with a reservation. The demand killed the evening and our appetites (we still had food on our plates). Clearly, the management poorly manages scheduling and flow of diners (overbooking). I have never been timed at a full-service restaurant.

Being there is no host/hostess, the staff was all in the back and saw non of it. Thankfully another patron at the table next to us escorted him out. I feel bad for the man was homeless, but you don't expect it. The bust boy approached with some extra towels, but notified no one that someone was just picked up off the floor. When I approached the waiter or who seemed to be the owner I explained to him what happened and he seemed like it was the first time this had happened, although you could tell through his attitude it was not. He offered no apology and with an attitude offered for me to bring back my dry cleaning bill.  It was an overall uncomfortable experience.",-0.2846,0.853,0.07,0.076,0.3243589743589744
2015-11-06,4.0,"Having read up on HB, I gave this as an option to my husband for planning our anniversary dinner. We are both happy he chose it. I do not typically like short menus....this girl likes options. However, someone in an earlier review mentioned preferring a few dishes to choose from because you know they are taking care of each dish, as opposed to mass producing for 40 different options. YES!!! That is exactly what you get out of Home Bistro.  For you foodies out there (or those of you striving to be, like me), you need to come here. Do your homework and check out the menu online, periodically - they do change things up. It is a small, intimate setting. We were the first reservation of the evening (Thursday), but within half an hour, most of the tables were taken. I loved the vibe....the young hipster crowd, Gen Xers like us, people my parents' age....everyone brought their bottles, cracked them open, and took in the experience.  My husband had never had escargot, and he was willing to try the appetizer. It had us at hello...escargot, sauteed garlic with roasted tomatoes...the garlic clove just melted - at first, I was put off by a whole clove, but it is obvious it was cooked in the buttery sauce, and it was not garlicky...just ridiculously delicious! When they first served it I was like where's the bread - not necessary! They could probably use a couple of more croutons to help soak up the sauce, but we made sure we did not leave a speck in the bowl.  We then ordered the endive salad...the flavors were subtle...almost a bit too subtle because it was more dry than I would've preferred - just a tad more of the walnut dressing would've knocked it out of the park. Then, my husband ordered the Bulgogi Steak w/truffle fries...it was surprisingly served as a sandwich, NOT what we expected but SO happy with it. My husband asked for ketchup, and I thought the owner (who was helping serve our table) was going to have a grabber by the look on his face, but we didn't see that they had placed the cup with the truffle mayo on the table...oh man, probably the best truffle ANYTHING I've ever had - you have to be so careful with adding Truffle Oil to anything because it can be overpowering but this was subtlety at it's finest!  I had one of the evening's specials, homemade pappardelle in a cherry pepper arrabiatta sauce...how can sauce first taste too sweet, then too spicy, then just blend together to be so absolutely right?! So good! I'm not a huge fan of paying $25 for a bowl of pasta (or for a sandwich, which is why I took a star away - the food is a bit overpriced), especially one that doesn't include some sort of meat or fish, but I loved it! My husband and I both agreed it was close to as perfectly al dente as you are going to get. At first, we thought the portions of our meals looked small, as some previous reviewers mentioned, but we took a lot of time with each course, tasting and observing what was on the plate, so it made it a truly enjoyable experience for our palets. And, it is what I love about this place - unique flavors you really won't have anywhere else. It's exactly the type of dining experience my husband and I prefer - something that is not cookie-cutter and has its own personality....GREAT EXPERIENCE!  The owner overheard us toasting our anniversary, and brought dessert on the house....after The Ketchup Incident, we were pleasantly surprised. We had ordered the Ras el Hanout Panna Cotta. He recommended it, as it is homemade, and he said it would pair nicely with our bubbly. I don't even know how to describe the flavors....I tasted basil, lime, a sweetness I couldn't identify (thanks byob,  by then i was a wee bit sauced). WHATEVER it was, it was so delicious, refreshing and indulgent at the same time. Not Alinea-level fine dining obviously, but a pleasurable, down-to-earth, unique experience.",0.9979,0.832,0.139,0.029,0.5855864944847996

Then the fried oyster tacos and unfortunately the tortilla was falling apart. Not sure if it was because of the brand or because they were kinda cold. Then, our waiter recommended the Osbuco and the fall gnocchi dish so of course we went for it. The Osobuco wasn't tender and for the same reason it did not have a lot of flavor. It came with greens in the side and they were so bitter that we weren't able to eat them. The gnocchis were ok. Not a big fan of the combination but they were well prepared.

No apology, no explanation of what we were about to eat. Nothing. Our initial reaction for both dishes that they didn't look great. I had four little scallops sitting next to some carrots and two slices of parsnips. It was sitting on dry wild rice. The scallops were so incredibly salty that I couldn't eat them. Dry rice is also not a joy to eat. So I had some carrots. My friend thought they were stingy with the chicken thighs. He received two and a bunch of brussels sprouts to fill up the plate. His chicken was also too salty to eat.  Then the bus boy took our plates away. No one took notice that they were full plates! No one asked how our meal was, or questioned why we were pretty much sending the whole thing back. Then after another glass of wine one of the waiters came over and asked if we wanted dessert.

Our friends arrived, with another 2 bottles of wine. We don't play. Anyway, Dionne came right over and took care of them as well...opened their one bottle and poured a couple of glasses for them. She then floated off to give us time to chit chat and settle in. In a few minutes, she returned, sat down next to me on the bench and proceeded to share the specials. We loved that Dionne felt comfortable enough to cozy up to us in this way. We are a pretty open and fun group, so it felt completely natural to have her on our level and just being real and down to earth in the moment. So for starters we had the fried oysters, patatas bravas and the artichoke appetizer. Where do I begin??? The detailed preparation, mix of fresh flavors and presentation were beyond impressive! I can't even begin to explain the explosion of savory delight that occurred upon each and every bite of literally every dish. Unbelievable! I'm so serious! For entrees the two guys got the buttermilk fried smoke chicken sandwich, with slaw and pickles. Ridiculous.....ohhhhheeemmmmmgggeeeeee they were like, ""this is the best sandwich I've ever eaten!"" And, for certain it was. The sandwich came with truffle fries. Now, I'm obsessed with truffle fries and these were hands down THE BEST truffles fries that have touched this mouth. Hubs was like, these fries are kinda white looking, so Dionne told him to try one to make sure they were done. He tried one and was floored with delight. They were perfect. So, get this, as we were going hard on our food and having great conversation, Dionne ""floated"" by again, slid between our friends and swiped a fry off my husbands plate! Lol it happened so fast and we were all like, did that just happen?!? We totally lost our shit and were laughing hysterically as Dionne stood back and winked! She became my hero at that moment. I realize a server can't get away with that kinda stunt with most people, but that she could read our vibe and have fun with us, made the experience one of my favorites ever! I got the soft shell crab special....deliciousness. I'm an east coast girl originally so I could def appreciate this wonderful dish. My gf had the vegetarian dish with spatzel and cheese. It was also a delight. Dessert was next. Oh my oh my. We couldn't decide on one to share so we got all three. The panda cotta with lemon zest, pepper and salt. Sounds weird but was our fave. The bread pudding was incredible and the dark chocolate with walnuts and dried fruit was spectacular.  We will def be back...and often!!",0.9995,0.721,0.252,0.027,0.5815248503773095
2015-05-29,2.0,"The main takeaway: excruciatingly slow service.  They have only one server + one water filler/greeter. The restaurant is not big, but the labor is clearly not enough.  The appetizer came fairly quickly, but 40 minutes after we finish the appetizer, the entrees are not coming for a table of TWO....by that time, we have finished eating the Hershey's kisses I could find in my purse (reserved for my toddler's emergencies). It is getting ridiculous feeling the table so empty for so long.  Other tables around us are also helplessly waiting. They didn't even have bread to help you to get over these long waits, which I expect from this not too modestly priced restaurant.  Finally, I got the server's attention and asked him to check the progress of our dish. He came back saying the chef needs another 5 minutes because the duck breast my husband ordered takes a LONG time to prepare. (I was thinking: gosh, just bring it, we can eat it medium rare.) When the duck breast finally came: it is medium rare. It is pan-seared and it is rare!!!! It is obvious that this dish takes 5 minutes to prepare. Okay, why the server was not honest with us: sorry, the chef is so overwhelmed that he or she has forgotten to prepare your dish in the last 50 minutes!! We are not dumb! The food is fine.  I ordered mussel with fries. The fries' texture is great but they lack salt so I asked for some, and the salt came in a little open dish, so I cannot sprinkle them at all without getting my fingers all in it. The appetizer portion is small: the baby octopus ($13) has three pieces of what taste like mother octopus to me. The overall experience was not good.  Some sincere advice for this place:  1. Hire more people 2. Prepare some bread so people do not starve while waiting for food P.S. My husband added that the place is not romantic because it is quite loud with tables close to each other.",0.9036,0.813,0.106,0.082,0.5681081081081082

Grilled octopus (daily special) - meh, octopus was overcooked, carrots undercooked Tapas-like potatoes - quite good after you stir it together (warning: it's VERY filling) Duck breast - meh, didn't finish it CHORIZO FLAUTAS Think 'a cross between a flauta and a somosa' with a heavenly garnish. While this dish still has growing to do, it was a surprisingly innovative dish with tremendous potential. Outstanding!!! I encourage the chef to take this just a little further...it will be his signature dish. PANNACOTTA was even better. Very interesting in a yummy way. I heard the server say cardamom, but it was more elusive than that, in my opinion. The flavor was too hard to narrow down other than 'spice'. One of the most innovative - yet simple - desserts I've had in a long time. Bravo. Note to restaurant (on the chance they read this): 5 year loyal customer, but visits are less frequent over time. Stopped to analyze it (over dinner with my guest) and decided it was because the menu is too slow to evolve. I can pretty much guess the menu before I walk in. Evolve, please.

The fried oyster was alright, I know the special thing was supposedly the sauce, but not a big fan. Though the roasted duck and pork belly were fantastic. The roasted duck was crunchy on the skin and very flavorful. The pork belly just melts in your mouth, asparagus and risotto came with the pork belly and it was also very good. Thought I could tell that the taste of the pork belly and the duck was very similar, maybe same seasoning? But with the flavor of the meat itself is different, the dish tastes different enough.

2015-04-25,5.0,"We met an out of town friend who was staying nearby and decided on the spur of the moment to try Home Bistro on a Saturday night. It was about 6 pm and even though we did not have reservations they found us a table for 3. The space is small, but charming and the service was very pleasant and attentive without being intrusive (which can be tricky in a smaller restaurant).  For appetizers our friend had the caesar salad and my husband and I had the artichoke and edam fritters with roasted garlic aioli.  The salad was a generous portion for a starter and the fritters were excellent- crispy on the outside and firm/creamy on the inside. The aioli was garlicky and really complimented the cheese of the fritters.  For entrees my husband had the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich with a spicy sauce and pickles. It came with thin cut fries. He said it was crunchy and delicious.  Our friend had the mussels in a harissa spiced broth  with Belgian-style frites. The portion was very generous for both the seafood and the fries, but it was the harissa broth that really made this dish. It imparted a smokey, spicy essence to the mussels that lingered on the palate with just a touch of heat. There were enough mussels that he shared with me, even though they were so good he wanted to just keep eating! I had the scallops with tamarind pico de gallo and again, everything was delicious. The scallops were perfectly seared on the outside, but not overcooked and the pico provided a slightly fruity heat. There was another brush of sauce on the plate but I can't recall what it was, but it complimented the seafood and pico. It was served on a bed of wild rice, but the rice did not overpower the main in any way.  For dessert we shared a thin slab of dark Belgian chocolate with dried cherries and red pepper. It was a perfect light finish to our meal, which left all of us totally satisfied. All the portions are very well calculated- generous, without being too much to finish, and seemed to align well with the pricing.  Home Bistro is BYOB/W but there is a Seven Eleven across the street with a reasonable alcohol selection and we just ran and got a bottle of wine to go with our meal. At first glance some of the menu pairings seemed a little unusual,but after the success of every dish we ordered, we will definitely be back to try some different items next time.

We ordered: Apps: Smoked Eggplant and Escargot Entree: Pork Loin special with house made giardiniera and Rainbow Trout with puree, braised cabbage, and egg Dessert: Cardamon Panna Cotta and Bread Pudding The apps were pretty good and so was the bread pudding.  The Rainbow Trout sounded interesting but it was just a bunch of random stuff paired together on a plate that didn't go well together (I always like to take a bite with a little of everything on the plate and it was not a good combination). My boyfriend didn't really care for the pork either, it tasted like pork with vinegar, and it was not worth the extra up charge for ordering the special.  Lastly, the Cardamon Panna Cotta was horrible, it tasted old, kind of like when you leave pudding in the fridge uncovered for a day and it gets that weird dried out gelatinous texture. There was no way that was freshly made. Also it was too heavy in cardamon flavoring.

The dates were incredibly sweet in the worst way, not to mention topped with brown sugar.  I also ordered the short rib corn dogs.  Mistake number two..  I'm confident any freezer brand corn dogs would hold its own against these in a blind taste test.  They weren't terrible, but not distinguishable difference a standard corndog. $25 into my meal and I was already experiencing buyer remorse, but I stayed the course in hopes of better entrees.  But wait.. Our server hadn't been to our table in quite some time, so our entrée orders weren't taken.  I found this to be odd because every other table I observed impeccable service and attentiveness.  No explanation, but true.  Rarely have I visited a restaurant where they allow water glasses to get empty, let alone sit empty for over 15 mins. While waiting for our server to take our entrée order the busser noticed we weren't eating our apps & offered to take them away.  He also filled our water.  When our server returned, I reminded her to take our entrée order.  We opted for the trout and the short rib tacos.  After another long wait and no water, we finally received our food.  The tacos came with a side of refried beans, which were cold.  The corn tortillas were straight from the package. Not warmed.  The trout was overcooked and tepid.  My guess is our plates sat in the back for a while better coming out.  We picked at both dishes, but left 90% on both plates.  When our server found time to ask, I let her know we were disappointed and explained the misfires with each dish.  She offered no response.  No offer to remake or order a different dish..No offer to remove items from the bill.. No offer to notify the owner, who was onsite.  My friend's company hosted an event in the past and recognized him as he stopped by several tables, not ours.   I requested the bill, paid in full (third mistake), left the food and went across the street to Wood.  In summary, HB has below average to mediocre over-priced food and inconsistent service.  In my top 3 worst dining experiences  of 2014..",-0.5456,0.784,0.102,0.114,0.5635409652076319

However, the next problem came when they ran out of 3 of the items we ordered(there were 3 of us). No problem, there was plenty of good options on the menu so we picked something else.  Once we received our food everything was delicious, the gnocchi and chicken bratwurst were great, the patatas bravas even better, and pumpkin fritters for dessert!!   Like I said food was great, but I probably wouldn't go back or recommend because of the service.",0.9252,0.82,0.143,0.037,0.525

We ended up going with the Eggplant Caponata to start, which had a smoky flavor which almost made it taste like meat. Amazing. I had the trout for the main, and I can't stop thinking about it. I could have that dish every week! The skin was perfectly crispy (would love to know how they got it like that!), and the horseradish sweet potatoes, braised cabbage, and fried egg were perfect accompaniments. I was so full by the end, but kept eating because it tasted so good. There were absolutely no faults with the dish.

The menu photo has a much better description of the courses.  The only minor knock was the fettuccine was slightly undercooked.  Otherwise, awesome meal and a charming venue.  This place is tiny (we counted 14 tables) and can get noisy when filled, but it would also be a great date night sort of place.  At regular prices, I would say it would be on the spendy side.  Server was Amy, and she was very friendly, attentive, and always had a nice smile.  She and the help were also very efficient.  The place has been around for 10 years, and it's high average 4.5 star Yelp rating for 700 reviews is well deserved.  FYI - I don't think there's any free parking in the area - it's standard metered $2/hour with the rest of the area looking to be permit parking.  Overall, great place to try at least once and highly recommended.",0.9981,0.753,0.241,0.006,0.5557086894586895

The food was slow coming out even though there were only two tables with two customers each. I've never tasted such a schizophrenic dish in my life; it's like the chef couldn't decide what it should taste like, so he decided to combine everything under the sun that just didn't marry well and competed with each other. The cherry tomatoes were cold with a slightly sweet vinegar dressing; the polenta was cheesy; the clams were overly salty; the fried kale was also overly salty with a ton of pimenton. Even if I could get past the assault on my taste buds, the amount of food was pitiful, particularly for $25. My sister and I had to go elsewhere to fill up after this meal. We also had to ask for some bread. They produced four little pieces, which came out steaming hot from the microwave. That was their attempt at disguising stale bread, which was of course, made extremely chewy when cooled after being nuked. Then the two servers/greeters were too busy talking to each other to notice that we were done eating and would like the bill to get the heck out of the joint.

Other than that, the service was very attentive and I can tell that they take pride in the dishes they come out with.

We also ordered the mussels, which were on the main menu. We both loved the pork tacos the best, mostly b/c of the spicy kick that it had along with the complementary flavors of the kimchi and Thai mango salsa. The mussels were pretty decent, not like the most amazing mussels I've had. By the time the pork loin dish came out, we were getting pretty full, so we actually only had a few bites of it and took the rest home. Since it was my boo's bday, of course we got some dessert.

I would have much preferred the bed of zucchini ""spaghetti"" and other vegetables to be served hot like the egg instead of cold. Surprisingly spicy. Chorizo and clams main was a 10. Props on that. Polenta was perfectly creamy; the sauce so good I did my best to scrape the plate clean, damning the fact that I didn't have a spoon to get the rest. Pork shoulder main was also delicious, but a little too much like a Thanksgiving meal in July for my taste. Sub the pork with turkey and the raspberries with cranberries and you've got all the flavors of fall -- not midsummer. Regardless, the entire plate was happily devoured. Cinnamon-roll bread pudding for dessert was a huge, heaping portion of bread and cream in danger of tipping off of its little plate.

It might've been dismal outside, but the interior of HB is warm, cozy, and very inviting.  Lots of earthtones and oranges, mirrors, and candles whisk you off to a romantic villa somewhere on the Mediterranean coast.  Once I was seated, HB felt like a perfect refuge. I lucked out by showing up on a Wednesday, since that's their prix fixe night -- $33 for 3 courses.  That's a killer deal for high-end cuisine in a high-rent district. I started dinner with some hot tea -- perfect for keeping those Midwestern chills at bay.  (HB is a BYOB, so no booze on the menu -- sorry alchies!) Course #1 was baby beet salad with honey ricotta, hazelnut streusel, and arugula.  I normally love beet-anything, but I didn't enjoy this salad at all.  The beets were totally undercooked (mostly raw in the middle), and all that raw earthiness clashed badly with the overly-sweet honey ricotta and streusel. Course #2 was much better: pan-roasted Atlantic salmon with couscous, cucumber ralta, and strawberries.  The salmon was cooked perfectly, and the cool raita and sweet strawberries contrasted well with the fish. The real highlight was Course #3 (dessert) -- bread pudding.  I get the impression that this is the specialty of the house, and for good reason.  It's moist and light and crazy flavorful, without overdoing it on the sweetness.  It's probably the best bread pudding I've ever had. Service was very gracious and friendly.  Even though I was dining solo that night, the hostess and server made me feel like part of the family.

However, they pack you in like sardines.

There seemed to be a table of regulars next to us. We arrived at the same time. Their attention was off the charts, got food faster, got check faster, had double the ""how's it going""?  You can live with these things if the food is good, but alas it wasn't.

For appetizers, the 4 of us shared artichoke fritters, pretzel rolls with beer cheese, and escargot. The other two were good, but gee golly, that escargot! My heart may have fallen a little when it was set on the table in a large bowl rather than drenched in butter/garlic/parsley in the typical escargot dish, but this thing way surpassed my expectations. Huge and very tender escargot had been removed from their shells and sat in a near-stew of tomato and mandarin orange. Not the most camera-friendly dish, but it tasted spectacular. Damn, that orange! If you eat nothing else here, eat this. Two of my friends got lamb burgers and seemed to enjoy them enough. When I tasted the patty, it was gamey, lean, and not overdone with seasonings like most other lamb burgers. Don't order this if you don't deeply love eating lamb. My rainbow trout (sustainably farmed in nearby Wisconsin = extra points!) was awesome, and reminded me of the lovely trout mullerin at Katja ( yelp.com/biz/cafe-katja-… ). Two large, thin, perfectly cooked filets shared the plate with rainbow chard, oniony and starchy shoestring potatoes, and a sunnyside-up egg. The different components were fun to eat.

(no corkage fee).  My gf had the pork loin on a bed of polenta and spinach.  Also amazing.  Finally despite being stuffed we could not pass on the bread pudding.  It was good, although not the best I've ever had.  But between the starters, entrees, and great service this place is 5 stars easy.  Oh and the portion sizes were made for humans and not mice.  Definitely a plus.  Cozy, romantic, really a perfect date night.  Worth every penny.",0.9954,0.722,0.247,0.03,0.6021604938271605

But let me say, if all American restaurants tasted like this, I'm all in. Food: fried oysters with polenta (our least favorite, but the polenta was magical), baby beet salad (fresh great quality beats, but the dish is pretty small, especially for 10 dollars) Ok here's what gets the five stars- their chicken thigh special (I NEVER order chicken at restaurants, but oh my god all the components of the dish were fabulous!!!!  Such attention to detail, it was delicious) & the lamb breast (not my favorite cut of lamb but once again all the sauces/garnishes/components were completely amazing) & Amsterdam mussels with truffle fries- my dad said it was the BEST oysters he's ever had (& he's definitely an oyster man) Panda cotta- definitely extremely yummy but not like ""died & went to heaven"" -food overall: 4.5.

It's not big at all and expect to be pretty cozy to your dining party and those around you, as well. I love BYOB places and HB is one of them. Bonus points because they let us crack our bottles while waiting, even bringing out glasses. Once seated at our table, they provided buckets of ice to put our bottles in - a much appreciated gesture. Service is spotty. We would go long periods of time without seeing our server and it always seemed to be when we needed something. Food also took quite a long time to come out. It was a Friday night and very busy so I understand but just a heads up not to expect a quick dining experience here. When the food came out, all thoughts of an upcoming mediocre experience dissipated as my hunger pains were satiated by deliciousness. I had the Berkshire Pork Belly for $23. The pork belly sat atop a bed of german potato salad, house bacon, rhubarb butter, and marinated lacinato kale. The elements of the dish married well together and all melted in my mouth. It was a truly delicious dinner that I'd highly recommend. Food is amazing at HB and I would love to go back to try more. It's a cute restaurant but gets very crowded and noise levels are through the roof with hit or miss service.

2014-03-14,3.0,"*3.5 Stars This is my friend's favorite place in Chicago, so he insisted I try it. We went on a Sunday night, and unforunately the kitchen had run out of a few dishes. One being the mussels that my friend had raved about. 1. Duck Rillete: This was a really good appetizer, but I am a sucker for any type of meat smear. To me, it is really hard to mess up any kind of rillete/pate etc. The cracker/flatbreads that came with the rillete were a really good vehicle for the smean, adn the mustard seed spread was vert flavorful, but not overly. I am not the biggest fan of mustard seeds, so the fact that I was smearing it on so generously says a lot. 2. Meatloaf (special of the night) - This probably had to be my least favorite dish of the night. The meatloaf was cooked very well, with a nice sear to it , and the accompanying roasted brussel sprouts were good. I think where the dish went wrong for me was that it was a little overly salty (and this is coming from someone who loves salty foods, and usually complains that food is too bland), also I think that a warm mashed potatoes would have worked much better with the dish than a cool parsnip/cauliflower puree. Sometimes it is just best to keep it simple, the puree had an odd taste to it. 3. Pork Cheeks Stew - I loved this dish, just the right amount of richness in the broth/soup. The pork cheeks were so tender. In this instance I think the parsnip/cauliflower puree worked well with the pork cheeks. All of the ingredients of the dish worked well together.  This place is BYOB, it is a very relaxed environment, with service that is just the right amount of attentiveness (not hovering, but still checks in on you). We had such a great time at dinner that we literally shut the place down.   I think should they had not run out of some of the dishes I wanted to try, this place could have been a solid 4 stars.",0.9952,0.74,0.195,0.065,0.548090277777778

2014-03-01,3.0,"My husband and I were the first customers when we came here for brunch, so we were able to sit by the window; the bistro itself was very cute and quaint; clean, and very cheerful-like.  Both our server and the manager were extremely nice and friendly!  For appetizers, I ordered the side of the small bowl of Parmesan truffle fries and the Brown Sugar Bacon.  The Parmesan truffle fries were warm but I could hardly taste the truffle, even if it was a slight hint.  It came with a side of ketchup. The brown sugar bacon was not overly sweet, but I was a little disappointed as the bacon themselves were very thin and small.  For the main entree, I ordered the Uitsmijter, which was a Dutch-style plate, that came with two slices of brioche toast, ham steak that was 'griddle-seared,' edam cheese, one sunnyside up egg (my favorite way of preparation of eggs), and a light vinaigrette-dressed rocket leafed/arugula salad.  The brioche were thin, and the ham steak was quite thick - it was a nicely salted baked ham.  The salad was nice as it was very simple and fresh, and I liked the light vinaigrette dressing.  My husband ordered the Slow Braised Corned Beef Hash, which came with two eggs over easy and a buttermilk biscuit with strawberry butter in a little ramekin.  His 'corned beef' was more like my ham steak - thick slices and slightly underseasoned.  The strawberry butter was very nice and complemented well with the toast.  He did find a piece of wire in his dish, so that was a little unpleasant!  We were glad to check this restaurant out in Boystown! :D +Uitsmijter +check your dish for foreign objects!

I'm really disappointed because when we made our reservations for Valentine's Day, we had no idea that it was the $130 prefix menu.  Not only did we have to spend more than we anticipated but we did not get to taste the tried-and-true menu.  When we made our reservations over the phone, no one disclosed the fact that the prefix menu would be the only available menu that night (nor that there was even a prefix menu at all).  The best parts of the meal was the sweet potato soup and the anchovy pinxto. I had the fettuccine for my main course.  It tasted like vinegar.  There was no other aspect of the dish than a mouthful of vinegar.  I did not finish my plate.    The dessert served were 2 different chocolate ""bars"".  Very underwhelming, especially considering it was Valentine's Day. As for the service, the waiter, although nice, was not around very often.  Not sure if I'll be back.

Dolled up, and with a few bottles of wine tucked into a grocery bag, we strolled into the unassuming door located on the west-side of Halsted Street. A cozy, quaint room that appeared to be lit by candle light appeared before us. We were seated within minutes and began analyzing the menu. Everything was tempting! Unfortunately they had already sold-out of the braised pork. This was not a game-changer for me as I had my eye on the seafood special. We ordered 3 appetizers to pass around the table. They were pretty small, barely a bite per person. The beet salad was my favorite, BUT everything was awesome. As soon as the appetizers were complete, the main course came rolling out- and mine was by far the most spectacular! There were TONS of muscles, some clams, and three large shrimp tucked away in this heaping bowl of amazing-ness.Garnish atop was some pickled-like apples and some other greens. I was skeptical about how they would play into a sea food dish...BUT they complimented it to a 'tee.' The broth was superb and once I was done with all the seafood and had all the shells stacked in a separate bowl, I discovered there was still more! There were these braised, short-rib maybe? nuggets of scrumptious meat underneath all the broth. I tried some of the others' food. The Amsterdam Muscles had a strong anise flavor incorporated into it.  I think that flavor stood out more to me as it was a sharp contrast to the muscles I just digested. I helped finish whatever muscles they could not. The gnocchi with meatballs had almost a dessert-like essence and had an infusion of cinnamon to go with. Also a fantastic choice. We had dessert...

I've been in the fall, summer (post Cubbies) and winter, and the menu changes based on season and availability. The winter menu was a little heavier, but some recognizable staples (like the beer-steamed muscles) always seem to be available. #3: The food is reasonably priced and the portions are appropriate. Some of the pasta dishes skew a little large, but the meat, poultry, and seafood seem just right for a hungry guy. #4: The service is superb. The same head guy (beard) seems to always be there, and I even recognize some of the waitresses from multiple visits. The service is relaxed and professional. They don't rush you out - even though they sat us at 5:30 last weekend and told us they had another seating at 7pm, they shuffled some tables around to let us linger until we were done at 8pm (and didn't complain when we asked for refills on our coffees).  #5: They take reservations.

2013-10-21,5.0,"My wife and I could not have been more impressed with the meal we recently enjoyed at HB. We started with the bacon wrapped dates which were served with a crispy, crumbly brown sugar and stuffed with almonds. While a bit on the sweet side to start things off, they were delicious and we could have easily polished off a couple dozen. We had trouble picking entrees because there were a number we wanted to try but landed on the pork shank and one of the night's specials, a veal Marsala pasta dish. We shared the two dishes and both were phenomenal!  The pork shank was expertly cooked and fell off the bone with the touch of a fork. It was served with a delicious apple smear, a cold sweet potato mash and very acidic sautéed kale and onions. We both loved the mash and thought the kale and onions was a bit heavy on the vinegar, but the apple smear went so well with the pork that we actually ran out quite quickly. The veal marsala was the star of the night! Neither one of us wanted to give up the perfectly prepared dish. The veal was prepared like pork belly and served over pasta with figs, mushrooms and a flavorful sauce. It was absolutely perfect! The service friendly and attentive without being overbearing. At one point we asked for more apple smear, and after a few minutes she came back and told us the chef was running low and was a bit flustered at the moment. We thought that sounded a bit odd but continued enjoying the rest of the meal regardless. Then as we were waiting to hear about dessert, one of the other servers drops a whip cream covered bread pudding on our table! Turns out our server felt bad about the apple smear and made up for it with dessert on the house! It was a cinnamon roll bread pudding that we quickly devoured, and was a decadent end to our fabulous meal.",0.9908,0.758,0.171,0.072,0.5975

The dish came with truffle fries. Who doesn't like truffle fries? Almond stuffed dates wrapped in bacon - It's sweet, it's savory, it's crunchy and nutty. There are simply so many flavors and textures packed into these little delicious morsels. I could seriously eat like an entire bowl of these. Milk poached sturgeon (10 stars*) - Now this could very well be my last meal on earth. The fish was amazing and man, the creamed corn went so well with it. And the salsa verde too! I don't even like salsa verde! Braised pork shank - The pork had great flavor and did not leave me feeling heavy. Meat so tender, I forgot to use the knife.

The intimate decor and small space make you immediately want to get closer to your fellow diner. I also love the small-business, locally feel about this restaurant, makes me want to support them instead of spending my (eh or someone else's) money at fancier places.  We stopped by one night for an early dinner. They just started services, and already there were 4 tables. For how small this place is, it was a good sign. Unaware that it was BYOB, I ran to a wine store near by and got a bottle of wine. Things worked out perfectly.  We shared an apricot salad, pork belly, bacon stuffed dates, muscles and truffle fries, and something else on their special which I cannot remember. It was a fish dish. The salad was good, but on the small side. The pork belly had a good portion, but a bit too salty. It had some asian flavoring to it, and well executed - crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. He enjoyed it more than I did, since the salt kinda got to me in the end. Muscles and fries were good, but I've had better truffle fries somewhere else. If I have to rate the food alone, it's a 3.5/5.  They only had 3 people working - a hostess, a server, and a busser. Server was really nice, but I felt like she was overworked. The busser was super efficient and quick, and our water was filled repeatedly.

We ordered basically anything that looked good, including appetizers.  I think we had the aforementioned mussels, some type of fish (maybe salmon), beef cheek; we went H.A.M. although regrettably didn't have any ham.  I remember thinking everything, including the fries, which I usually skip altogether, didn't have much room for improvement, if any.  This is probably a 4.5 stars for me (and I round down), but a big kudos to them for taking care of 5 loud straight dudes when we probably should have been somewhere else.  I'll bring a date next time and take it easier on the Sav Blanc to compensate.

But, all 4 of us agreed the escargot appetizer was excellent, and one of the best we've ever had...(& all 4 of us are food & wine snobs). We also had the white anchovies with mozzarella cheese and pesto sauce...not something I would normally get, but we thought it sounded interesting, and we all really liked it. The 2nd best app, was the artichoke edam fritters. Edam is a type of cheese, and although I'm not a big fan of fried foods, these are REALLY good! Definitely great to share! Both guys got the lamb breast. The dish was full of flavor, but a bit too much of a fatty cut for my husband. I was debating between the trout and mussels, but my friend and I both got the mussels, and they were delicious and generous portion. In the end she & her husband agreed that too many of them were served closed though. I'd definitely order them again though! They come served with truffle fries that were pretty good! My husband ate most of mine:) We were too full for dessert, but was told the bread pudding is excellent.",0.9983,0.696,0.289,0.016,0.5486021505376343
2013-05-17,5.0,"I went to write an update to my original HB review and then realized I have never reviewed HB before. How that is even remotely possible is beyond me. I have eaten here at least 4-5 times a year for the last five years. Huge Yelp GNO nights where we got the whole place to ourselves, intimate date nights at a window table, small group dinners celebrating a birthday...lots of memories here for me. It is truly one of the best BYOB restaurants in Chicago, as well as one of the best restaurants in all of Lakeview. The reason I wanted to update is because I went there for the first time since Joncarl left for Philadelphia a few months ago. I am beyond happy to report that it is still the same friendly service and atmosphere, and the food is just as good as ever. Perhaps a little too much seafood on the current menu. It changes all the time but for some reason seems more fishy than usual. The bacon-wrapped dates are still there and this is all that matters! Small tiny gripe...if I almost gave a table a heart attack by dropping an extremely good bottle of wine on the floor while trying to open it and I knew it was an extremely good bottle of wine given as a birthday present, I would have comped the birthday girl a dessert. I'm not sayin', I'm just sayin'.",0.9625,0.859,0.123,0.017,0.4366071428571428

I'd consider it a little pricey for your average night dinner but not TOO extravagant especially since it's BYOB.

2013-05-02,4.0,"This used to be my favorite restaurant in the city. (It is still good, read below.) This place was a flat out hidden gem. Go on Wednesday for the prix fixe menu (used to be $30, now it's $33). The place is BYOB with no corkage fee. The quality and preparation of food is great. The menu is cleverly assembled and has a good variety to please an assortment of tastes. Whoever designs the menu here is very passionate about food and has a great creative mind. I've had some of the best food of my life at this restaurant. A real foodie heaven. I've been to HB at least a dozen times and it's near and dear to my heart.  I hadn't been to HB in a while and recently took four friends who had never been. While I'm not giving up on HB yet, I have to say I wasn't impressed with the new management. The food was still good, however the menu changed slightly, and the food lacked that incredible edge it used to have. Entrees were prepared well, but not perfectly, and certain dishes had too much sauce or were overcooked. Things like this just didn't happen at the former HB. Don't get me wrong, the food was still good, and for a $33 prix fixe, BYOB with no corkage fee, you certainly can't go wrong. You won't find a better value for fine dining anywhere in the city. One of the high points of this place used to be the service, but the last time I went, they were understaffed and the service was lacking. We were basically brought our food and left to our own devices. Not my ideal vision of service, but it was late (seated around 8:30) so I'll give HB a pass this time. Bottom line, this used to be one of the best restaurants in the city, bar none. You should absolutely go here, as it'll likely be a highly-memorable dining experience. I'm not going to let one mediocre experience deter me from returning. I'll be back to HB, and I hope they are able to return to their old form and deliver a breathtaking dining experience like the HB of old.

Every time ive been there its been great. esp with byob. the service is always great too. atmosphere and vibe are pretty homey and relaxed. we tried some new things. instead of going the normal fitters or oysters route, we chose the liver mouse and pork belly. pork belly was yummy. and i liked the texture and tastes of the liver mouse and mustard seeds and pita chips. then we followed with the endive salad. i thought it was perfect. people who arent keen to mayo on stuff might not like it though. then i went for the seafood stew while he got the lamb. i thought the stew was okay. i usually get the mussels though and kinda wished i did. he said lamb was alright. the meat itself was good but with the creamy minty sauce under it, i am not sure he enjoyed it that much with the meat. then we had the pudding dessert. omg. yes. overall it was slightly underwhelming. the amount of food though is always huge. i suggest for someone who has never been, go starving. like you havent had a bite of food all day if youre opting for the prix fixe on wed. also, dont eat the bread as you will def not make it to the end. its almost a challenge any time i go there because i wanna make it to the dessert part and i can almost bow out by the time entree arrives.",0.9885,0.77,0.166,0.064,0.5555050505050504

The Caesar salad a baby beets salad were very good, but pricey.  The bouillabaisse special was basically only mussels (3 shrimp 2 clams) and for $28 we felt ripped off, because the mussels on the dinner menu were only $19.  My Lamb breast was meager and the side that came with it was not good.  The chicken special was just a small chicken breast and nothing special for $24.

May be because it gets high footfall and it is in the middle of everything. Everything we had was bland, too mealy, spiceless.  The lamb sweatbread was only lamb fat and no lamb. Artichoke fritters had no artichoke but flour. Pork belly was too thick and way too salty. The accompanied squash was inedible - coz it was sprinkled wth salt after being doused in soy sauce.

2013-01-17,3.0,"I'm so torn, this place is one of my friend's all time favorite eats in Boystown and he was excited to take me there. I really wanted to be able to come home and write a stellar review... Let's start with the good (and the good was indeed good). It's BYOB, to some a positive; I'm a Californian and I still haven't quite grasped the concept of BYOB (it seems weird), but I will try to get on board with the Chicagoan excitement of it. They were offering a prix fixe deal (appetizer, soup/salad, and entree) that was an awesome bargain. Between the two of us we got to eat a lot of food! I like that. I had the artichoke edam fritters with roasted garlic aioli, the Belgium endive salad, and the mussels and truffle fries. My friend had the almond stuffed dates, the Caesar salad and the special of the night - sausage over something (I can't remember the description). Our bill for both was $70 (pretty good deal for the amount of food you get).  Let's break it down: artichoke fritters - ok, but very bland. I don't like my food salty, but I seriously wanted to add some salt to these. They were big and kinda fun to break apart with your fingers.  almond stuffed dates - they were good, better than the fritters, but average at best.  endive salad was exceptional! It included pears, goat cheese, pork jowl lardons, and a creamy walnut dressing. I would have been happy to end the meal here. Ok maybe the salad and a sample of their bread pudding! The salad was the best part of the meal and I would go back to try the other great salad combinations.  mussels - oh man, they were the worst I have ever had. They were piled high in a small bowl so most of them weren't submerged in the yummy beer broth, they got cold fast, many were still closed and more than half of the ones opened did not look friendly. I only ate about a 1/4 of the bowl before I pushed them aside. One of my favorite things about mussels is the big ass bowl, the delicious broth to dip a hunk of bread into and steaming mussels that go down smooth. I got none of that here.  truffle fries - omg, so addictive and good! Crispy, thin, tasteful.  The staff is amazeballs and attentive and funny and kind. The place is cozy, candlelit and in a great location to start an evening out in Boystown. I would like to go back and try some other items because the menu is creative and well thought out.

Not blow you away, I'll be back as soon as I can afford it good but very good. Considering it was only a week ago and I can't remember a single dish we had specifically, nothing really stood out. Thankfully they have their menu online to refresh my memory. Almond stuffed dates wrapped in bacon. I didn't get the fuss over these. Has no one else tried stuffed dates before? Because these are exactly the same as everywhere else you've ever had a stuffed date. Are they good? Yes. Are they yelp worthy? I don't think so. We had a special salad with a horseradish dressing and trout that was SOCLOSE to being incredible but just lacked a little bit. It was like they toned it down for the older clientele instead of fully unleashing the flavors. The smoked trout was a wonderful compliment to the dressing though. I had the mussels and they were, well, mussels. I've had better and I've had worse but the truffle fries were quite good.  The special rabbit cassoulet my partner had was like a very rich rabbit pot pie without the crust. It was a perfect winter dish - filling, rich, warm and decadent. I think it was the highlight of the meal, even if it was a bit one-note. As others have mentioned, the service is great. I wasn't as big of a fan of the dining room as it is very small. The chairs are also fairly uncomfortable which was a detraction for me from the meal. And finally, they don't have any way to block the wind so every time someone enters or exits the restaurant expect a blast of cold air.

To begin, they served us chunks of bread with the most sensational balsamic I've ever had. So. Good.  We started with the Belgian endive salad, which was definitely nontraditional, but very tasty. The sweetness of the pears balanced the goat cheese and hog jowl lardons very well. We also had the homemade Italian sausage and clams. Nom. The broth and Italian sausage were so flavorful, I literally did not want this dish to end. The boyfriend and I split the trout and the duck for our entrees. Neither of these are dishes we would typically order, but we trusted our waiter's opinion and were right to do so. Both were unreal, with so many elements and layers of flavor included in each dish. The proteins were cooked perfectly and the maple-orange-chilli pan sauce on the duck was really superb. We finished our dinner with the apple bread pudding that was on special, moist, not too sweet, perfect way to end the meal.

It's hard to find fine dining that's BYOB, especially as a vegetarian.  They had proper glassware, decanted a bottle for me, and the food was truly spectacular. We will be back soon, and I have gone out of my way to tell my foodie pals about this hidden gem.",0.936,0.81,0.155,0.035,0.5397058823529413
2012-12-21,4.0,"We had plans to meet Yvonne and M here which was the good part, the bad part was that I had looked the restaurant up on Yelp and read that there was no Valet parking.  Luckily, we were able to find a metered spot about two blocks away.  You can only pay the meter for two hours which had expired by the time we got back to our car.  The parking gods were in our favor, however, as we did not have a ticket.  I mention this because if you can arrive via cab or public transportation, it might make your night a little easier.  Coming from the southwest suburbs, this was not an option for us. The restaurant is small, almost but not quite too small.  I appreciated not having a table placed immediately next to mine but navigating getting to and from the table was not the easiest.  We all had to make a trip to the ""library"" so this was a small issue. Our server was friendly and quick, good about explaining things and very helpful with the bottles of champagne our table companions had brought.  This was really a big plus because at a BYOB, these beverages did not increase the bill or tip.  Take that into consideration when you tip, you got a service which isn't reflected in the bill. I had the pork shank which was fall off the bone tender. It came with really delicious German potato salad.  I also got to eat one of my wife's meatballs so I was very happy with the food.  For appetizers we had the eggs and the anchovies.  Again, I liked these the best so I got a lion's share.  I am not even a big fan of anchovies but the really spicy pickled part made the dish for me.   Only fair then that when dessert arrived, I didn't really care for the crisp that much so I only had a few tries and left it for my wife.   The food here is easily a five, the overall rating of four is based on the size of the restaurant, the noisiness which made conversation a bit challenging and the lack of valet parking.  If I lived nearby and lost about a foot of height, this would be a five for sure.  We'll call it a four point five.",0.9921,0.794,0.149,0.057,0.4792042042042043
2012-12-17,4.0,"HB rocks! It sure does. We had such a great experience from just calling to make the reservation, John returned my call almost immediately and we were set for a Sunday night party of 4 at 6pm. By 7pm, the place was already packed which tells you something about a place. The place has a very romantic ambiance, very quaint, small and intimate, perfect for a date night or a gathering with another couple. Our server was there immediately, he was super friendly and attentive. He opened up our wine right away which is a major plus about this place, byob and you are set!  He recommended the appetizer special which was deviled eggs with smoked trout, which was amazing, it was savory with a sweet element to it, and a sweet onion crunch on top, bunch of amazing flavors rolled into one, and I'm not even the biggest fan of deviled eggs, but these were truly special. Add them to your menu HB! Next we had the bacon wrapped dates which honestly weren't my favorite. They were good, but definitely better at places like Mercat a la planxa. I felt like the bacon was a tad on the fatty side instead of crispy, and I felt like instead of putting them in brown sugar, they should just be lightly sprinkled. For our main course we had the mussels and the fries with a garlicy mayo alioli sauce. Ooooh sooo yummy, they made up for the dates. They were better than the ones I had in Brussels which is known for mussels, (and the portion you get is enough for two people) and the fries I may have liked even more, super crispy, flavored perfectly and that mayo goodness. Okay, so how could we pass on dessert since everyone talks about their vanilla bread pudding and the one they had that night was an apricot preserve on top with cream, OH MY G. I was never a fan of bread pudding until I had HB's it was gooey, not overly wet, perfect texture and flavors. Definitely a MUST get! So overall, we had a fantastic experience with great service, even better food and a fun double date! The only issue is parking in this area, so come a little earlier unless you're one of the lucky ones who can walk to this place from your casa.",0.999,0.707,0.278,0.015,0.6003563330093942
2012-12-17,4.0,"Sometimes I wonder what makes a restaurant excellent: is it characteristics of the restaurant or is it the company sharing your table? Perhaps an intricate combination of both? Well, for me, my food from HB was outstanding, our party of four conquered two bottles of champagne, and our company was glowing. M and I met up with fellow Yelpers Kathleen M and Clifford S. Getting there was easy for me and M. We just took the 36 bus north and (due to construction) it was redirected along Halsted and dropped us off across the street from our destination. Kathy and Cliff had a harder time of it - their driving commute was an hour and a half from the southern suburbs. I don't know what they did about parking. We all shared two appetizers: something with anchovies and deviled eggs. The anchovy appetizer came on a toothpick: anchovy, pickled pepper, and mozzarella cheese. The pepper really overpowered everything else. We were all surprised that we liked it as much as we did, but I doubt that anybody would choose to have an encore. The deviled eggs were my favorite - and I hate eggs. I probably liked them because the flavor was smokey and not any bit like eggs. That's actually the reason why M was less impressed - she prefers her eggs to taste like eggs. Our entrees were all pretty varied: pork for Cliff, lamb meatballs for Kathy, mussels for M, and duck for me. Cliff's pork was falling off the bone because it was so tender. He seemed to enjoy it quite a bit. Kathy's meatballs weren't so great. She really disliked the polenta and she only ate one of her two meatballs. M and I both really enjoyed her mussels. They had lovely seasoning and did not taste fishy or dirty at all. But it was my duck that was really the shining star of the entrees. My duck had a crusty sear on top and was rare or medium rare in the middle. The flavor and texture were phenomenal. I also loved the side. I'm not sure what it was but it reminded me of gnocchi. Kathy and Cliff shared a walnut berry crisp dessert and M and I shared an apricot bread pudding. Kathy and Cliff really didn't say anything about their dessert. Our bread pudding was burnt on the bottom and my favorite part was the apricots. Our service was okay. Our server was kind enough to chill one bottle of champagne in the kitchen while providing an ice bucket at the table for the other. The people who came to our table were all friendly. We were impressed that our server remembered the specials while simultaneously pouring our champagne. I thought that they could have checked on us more often and also cleared away the regular wine glasses that cluttered our table. After all, we had both champagne and wine glasses on our table for nearly the entire evening. The ambiance of the restaurant was rather casual and intimate. The space is small and noisy. The lighting was dim. The decor was a bit rustic and artsy, but nice. Some photographs were on the wall that were taken by one of the owners of HB. I thought the bathroom smelled like fish. Our bill came to about $75 per couple. M thought that was good. In fact, she commented that she would enjoy going back there again and either ordering the duck or trying another entree. I'd say that the evening was really splendid for me as I got the benefit of good company and a scrumptious entree. I wonder if the evening might have been improved a bit for everyone else if the restaurant was just a hair more consistently luminous.",0.9979,0.762,0.18,0.058,0.5830312407898615

We were feeling fun and festive so we ordered two apps - their deviled eggs and their anchovies, yeah!  The eggs were the bigger hit, great flavors and a just a bit of texture on top. I ordered the lamb meatballs for my main course and I have to stop being seduced by the word lamb, although I have had lamb meatballs other places and liked them.  I was so sadly underwhelmed by my plate.  The bed of polenta was so bland, and nothing in the dish had much flavor.  Boo hoo for me as everyone else adored their entree and were nice enough to let me taste them.  Delicious duck!  Fabulous mussels!  Mouthwatering pork!    I had a bad case of menu envy.   I cheered myself up with coffee and half, okay more than half, of a walnut and something else crisp.  So delicious.   All these positives and just my entree as the only not so great moment in an otherwise really fantastic night.  It might not be my strongest five, but I gotta go with a five star rating!",0.9978,0.633,0.296,0.071,0.6773039215686275

2012-10-07,4.0,"What's in a name? In this case. A lot. HB stands for Home Bistro.  You get the bistro vibe from the stylish decor, candlelight, and elegant furnishings. The Home aspect that it's so small, cozy, and the service is very welcoming and never contrived, rushed, or executes missteps.  The establishment epitomizes both names. And did I mention it's BYOB? I've been here several times and it's always consistent. I'm by no means a Dutch food expert but it seems authentic with a contempory twist. Since I've been several times I will only highlight my faves: The bread Don't laugh, it's good and you'll need it later to sop up some of the sauces. Almond stuffed bacon wrapped dates baked with brown sugar A must order! Unless you're a vegetarian or have dietary restrictions; then order and give to me, then get the hell away. Amsterdam style mussels in beer broth, anise, dried basil, garlic and served with truffle frites. Their signature dish. It's good. The portions are large. Trout special with veggies and I believe cous cous or risotto/rice He found the portion small and the flavors monotonous. I liked the taste and presentation. The menu is small and specials change quite often. I feel for me there's an element of risk ordering since some items seem exotic. Further, it'd be difficult to ask for substitutions with out fear you'd destroy the integrity of the dish (since most are complex). However, I recommend it as an adorable spot for a date or friend session. And like that they take nicer and unique cuisine and present it in an accessible way.

I'm sorry, I really wish that the menu described it as a ""sandwich"" because that's what it is: an elevated BLT. It came on two slices of whatever bread, with more tomato than meat. The meat itself tasted and looked like bacon. I don't know, I was not expecting it at all. It tasted pretty good, but not mind-blowing by any means. Adam R.'s chicken thighs were a much better choice. They were savory and sweet (just like him! ...) and he really enjoyed them.

Came here with a couple girlfriends for dinner before heading out for drinks - we were running late so I called ahead and let the restaurant know that we would be about 15 minutes after our initial reservation.  When we got to the restaurant, we were seated immediately, however service was pretty slow after we were seated. We started with the edam fritters which were tasty if not particularly spectacular.  I had the fried catfish with grits and okra for my entree - it had really good flavor, and the fish was moist and flaky.  My friends ordered the salmon with quinoa and the mussels - both were very well prepared (I sampled them both). For dessert we had this slab of dark chocolate candy with cayenne, green pumpkin seeds, and fleur de sel.  It was the perfect ending since we were all stuffed after our entrees. All in all, I would recommend HB Restaurant for a small dinner (or a romantic date) - the food is really good - just remember to bring a few bottles of wine with you to enjoy while waiting between courses.",0.9864,0.847,0.153,0.0,0.45634615384615385

Now that we have also gone to the real Hearty Boys up on Broadway, it's not even fair to compare.   We had an out of town guest and were so exited to take them to HB Restaurant. Once there we were kind of embarrassed that we had ""over sold"" the place to our guest... I didn't think the food was all that great, and the service was nothing short of weird. I literally could not catch the attention of our server and went the whole meal needing a refill on my drink (!)I did see the only two servers that were there in the kitchen doorway but they were too busy chatting with each other and even waving my arms didn't catch their attention. I think I should give two stars but I'm trying to take into account whatever issues they must have been having that night which led to a fairly disappointing experience. This is the only place where bacon wrapped dates were NOT good... how do you even mess that up?! I think they would do well to change the name and stand on their own two feet to avoid this type of confusion.

All of our entrees were on the salty side and could have used less salt, but the lamb belly dish I got was EXCEPTIONALLY salty. Salty to the point of nearly being inedible.  And this is coming from someone who likes very flavorful food. Who knows, it could have been a really off dish or an off night, but I'd advise one and all to steer clear of the lamb belly.

Our waiter was the owner of the restaurant. He smiled the entire time and enthusiastically offered recommendations and advice on what to order. We were at our table for quite awhile but no one ever tried to rush us. I also happened to forget my credit card. When I stopped back to get it, the card was safely locked away in a safe AND our waiter stepped outside to recommend various bars in the area to try. The service is what earned HB 5 stars. Now, of course, the food is good too! We shared a swordfish special with green beans and couscous served in a sort of teriyaki sauce that was delicious. We ordered the artichoke fritters, but they were just okay for me. They are very rich.  We also tried the fried soft shell crab, veggie burger, and beef sausage. Highlights- the crab comes on a bed of melon, mint, and ricotta cheese that was delicious! The veggie burger came with the most fabulous French fries and tomato jam= awesome. Lastly, the entire beef sausage entree was excellent- imagine a marriage between a Polish sausage and a hamburger. That is the dish I would absolutely order again.

2012-06-21,1.0,"Let me start by saying that I rarely write bad reviews on yelp.  Even when I have a negative experience at a business, I prefer to write positive reviews for good experiences instead.   I've been to HB at least two dozen times and have always enjoyed the food, service, and ambience.  I've brought friends, dates, and family members and have recommended this place to many people. I brought my boyfriend there for the first time last Tuesday, June 12th.  It was his birthday.  He is a classically trained chef who has worked all over the world.  I have worked in the restaurant and bar industry for over 20 years, myself.  We will never return to HB again. We started with the charred asparagus and the fried oysters.  The charred asparagus was served cold, which was fine, we just expected the dish to be served hot due to the verbage on the menu.  The dressing on the asparagus was far too garlicky which made fininshing the appetizer impossible.  The fried oysters were good, but the grits they were served over were full of hard lumps.   We didn't complain about either dish, because it just isn't our style.  I was trying to save face as I had raved about the restaurant to my boyfriend for weeks before taking him there. On to the main course:  My boyfriend ordered the rabbit leg confit with spatzle and two kinds of peas (two?)  The rabbit leg didn't really seemed to be confit and was shredded throughout the dish.  We assumed it would be whole.  It was very dry and rather tasteless and the spatzle was quite rubbery.  He managed to choke about half of it down. I ordered the lamb belly and eggs with spring onion kim chee.  My lamb belly was so salty and tough, I couldn't stomach more than one bite.  The kim chee was also inedibly salty.  What a waste of spring onions!  The deep fried poached egg was delcious, however.  When the owner or manager (not sure which) noticed I wasn't eating my entree, he came over to see what the problem was.  I politely explained that the dish was just too salty for me.  He picked up the plate and rudely informed me, ""Five other people ordered this dish tonight and no one else had a problem with it.""  ARE YOU KIDDING ME???  That comment alone changed a bad experience to a never coming back again experience.  I've honestly never been more insulted in a restaurant, especially by the guy running it. Like I wrote earlier, my boyfriend and I aren't the type to complain or get upset at a restaurant, so we simply paid the check and left.  I don't know if there's a new chef here, or if it was his day off, or what exactly was going on that night but insulting a guest is completely inexcusible.  Perhpas he was drinking another table's bottle of wine in the back.  Regardless, you lost a valuable customer that night HB.",0.5445,0.829,0.092,0.078,0.5129844576719577

I honestly can't remember half the ingredients that were in that dish, but the noodles were super-wide, and there was veal in the sauce, which was seasoned with..... CINNAMON. You can't go wrong with cinnamon-seasoned red meat in my mind.

We started with the infamous Almond-Stuffed, Bacon-Wrapped Dates....yummm!  Order these, don't think about it, just do it.  I don't really like dates but I guess when you wrap them in bacon and bake them in brown sugar I do!   Because we couldn't pick just one app, we also tried the Sauteed Garlic & Escargot.  These are not your typical swimming in butter, garlic overload escargot.  It was a much lighter but very flavorful take on escargot and I thoroughly enjoyed them. For my main I went with the HUGE plate of ""Amsterdam Style"" Mussels.  I have never ordered just mussels at a restaurant but I went with it at HB because so many reviewers raved about them.  The amount of mussles you get is crazy, I wasn't even close to finishing them.  They are served over top of a tasty broth and you also get a side of fries with truffle dipping sauce.  These fries, oh my gosh these fries.  Very thin fries, crispy on the outside but soft on the inside, with some tasty salt on top...these were soooo good.  And the truffle ""sauce"" on the side was fantastic.  I wonder if you could just order these as a side for another dish??  Highly, highly recommend. We finished off the meal with the bread pudding, I believe when we went it was Cranberry & Vanilla.  Very, very good...perfect way to end the meal.   As if the great food alone wasn't enough...they are BYOB so you can have a very nice dinner out without breaking the bank!",0.9925,0.82,0.147,0.033,0.6264784946236558
2012-02-14,4.0,"My boyfriend took me here for an early Valentine's Day dinner and we had a great experience. I had no idea what to expect since it was a surprise, so when we walked in, I was very pleased with the atmosphere. This is a great place for a romantic dinner in the sense that it's intimate and cozy and you can actually hear what the person across from you is saying. We started with the almond stuffed dates that were wrapped in bacon with brown sugar. Delicious! My boyfriend felt they were a little too sweet, but I thought they were great. For our main course, we both had the rainbow trout, which came with fingerling potatoes, green sauce, celery root giardiniera, and soft boiled egg. Word of warning: the sauce does contain anchovies, so if you're not a fan, it might be a little overwhelming. I like anchovies, so the flavor didn't bother me. Also, the addition of the soft boiled egg was amazing. The chef recommended that we cut open the egg so that it would spill out over the fish for maximum flavor. We followed his suggestion and thought it was superb. We wrapped up our meal with dessert. I had a fig and apple crisp which came with fresh whipped cream. I thought it was great and not overly heavy. My boyfriend had the bread pudding, which was cranberry and butterscotch flavor (it changes regularly). He said it was good, but not great. Overall, I had a great meal here and I loved the ambiance. I would definitely like to come back.",0.9967,0.725,0.243,0.032,0.5614219114219114

2012-02-13,1.0,"This place came really highly recommended, so my husband and I were really excited to try it last weekend. Unfortunately, we had a terrible experience. We had a 10pm reservation; arrived on time, and were seated at a table in the middle of the restaurant. Service was a little slow, but we had our wine and it was Saturday night, so that was okay. We ordered the escargot and the sweet breads to start. The escargot were a little rubbery, but the garlic-y tomato sauce it was served in was excellent - the best thing we had all night. The sweet breads were fine on their own, but the sauce they were served with was too salty and totally overpowered the dish. We ordered the beef heart and the pork and clams for our entrees, but our server returned more than a little while later to tell us that they were out of beef heart. They were also out of the oxtail, but they managed to tell us about that before we ordered (we were told that they accidentally left it out all night, which doesn't inspire a lot of confidence!). So, we got the quail instead. Both entrees were extremely disappointing. The pork and clams was basically a mound of vinegar-y pulled pork covered with a layer of powdered parmesan cheese, and a handful of dry, flavorless clams. The dish not only looked unappetizing, but tasted really odd - very salty and heavy. The quail was overcooked and tough, and the sauce it was served on was overly sweet and really grainy (this seemed like a technical cooking error) - really unappetizing. The worst part, and what made us put down our forks after only a handful of bites of each dish, was that there was hair in our food! Both dishes! Actually, that wasn't even the worst part. The worst part of the experience was that our server and the host, who I believe is the chef/owner, pretty much ignored us once our entrees were served. We sat, food untouched, in the middle of the restaurant, for about 30 minutes before our server came to check on us. When we told her (in a polite and diplomatic way) how disappointed we were with the meal, she apologized and quickly whisked the dishes away. She didn't offer to bring us anything else or show us a dessert menu (I was still hungry! It was 11:30pm and I had barely had dinner!). And then she didn't come back! After about 20 minutes, because we had to leave to catch a show, my husband finally went to find her (again, this is a tiny place). She told us that they would comp the meal, which we appreciated, but it would have been much better if she, or the chef/owner, would have actually came to our table to tell us that. Overall, I got the impression that once they knew something was wrong in the kitchen, or with our experience, they decided to ignore us. Whether that was because it's such a small place, and they didn't want other diners to pick up on it, or because it was late and they had pretty much given up on service, I don't know. Bad food is one thing, but bad food paired with rude, inconsiderate service is unacceptable. We will not be returning to HB.",-0.935,0.788,0.095,0.116,0.5368906810035842

So, unfortunately, this meal wasn't as outstanding as last time, and I'm wondering if it was the dishes we ordered.  The bacon-wrapped dates were delicious (though I don't know if this dish has ever been bad anywhere that I've been).  We also shared the sweetbreads appetizer which was very tasty.  For entrees, I ordered a special, the pork belly, while one friend ordered another special, lamb with dates, and the other ordered the gnocci with oxtail.  We all tried each others dishes and agreed that the pork belly, hands down, was the best.  The gnocci with oxtail was nice though nothing special, and the gnocci perhaps a bit too big/doughy.  The lamb was a huge dish; however, my friend felt it was heavy on the dates with not much lamb.  The waitress did tell us that she was the last order for the evening, which made us question whether her portion was the leftovers.  For dessert, we split the chocolate bark, which was nothing special.   So, in summary, our dishes were hit or miss.  Last time I was here, all of our dishes were spot-on.  If you order correctly - perhaps selecting the dishes that repeatedly get great reviews on Yelp - you can leave this cozy BYOB with a 5 star experience!",0.9875,0.779,0.162,0.059,0.511025311025311

He had the homemade sausages and I had the venison meatballs with fettuccine. The sausages edged out the venison by just a hair in the ""who ordered the best"" game. They were the right mix of ground meat, rice and spices to make them tasty and lean. The greens they were served with were great.  My venison meatballs and fettuccine were good. The tomato sauce has a sweet note to it which I wasn't expecting. The table next to us ordered it as well and made the same comment. To be clear, we both enjoyed the dish; it just was a surprise to have a sweeter sauce. They were advertising fried chicken skins which I wish we could have ordered. Perhaps next time.

We got the bacon wrapped dates which were great, the spanish mackarel which was all right, edam and artichoke fritters which were also all right and the sweetbread which was good as well. Then came the salads. The ferro salad is really really good, one of those dishes that makes you want to recreate at home and eat every day if you could. Highly recommend this dish. My mom got the pastrami salad which was good but not as good as the ferro. For the mains, I got the rainbow trout which I highly recommend. Paired with potatoes and soft boiled eggs, the entire dish was delicious. My mom really liked her oysters and truffle fries (actually lets face it all of us probably ate more fries than her; the fries were good)...my sister and brother both got the lamb shoulder which was a bit too strong of a flavor for my brother. The soaked cornbread was also a bit too sweet. My sister's came out too salty which was interesting that two identical dishes came out very differently flavor wise. My dad got the mos expensive main on the list, the poached sturgeon which definitely didn't live up to our expectations. I definitely preferred my trout but maybe it was just a taste preference.

What we had: Artichoke Edam Fritters - these were great!  Flavoring was perfect, they weren't over or under cooked either.  I was pleasantly surprised with the flavor or Edam - I really enjoyed it. Bread they serve as you wait - this was also great.  It was warm, flavored nice and had a balsamic to dip in - I found myself wishing they refilled our bread! I had the Lamb Shank which was a stew with root veggies in a tomato broth served over couscous.  There was a cinnamon flavor to it which was good but at times a little overpowering.  The lamb was good and tender but the dinner was cold.  I didn't and still don't know if it's supposed to be served cold but given it was, the couscous was cold and soggy.  This was kind of disappointing to me.   My husband had the Rainbow Trout which of course I taste tested and it was way too salty for my liking. We finished with dessert.  I will admit - I was hoping they had a chocolate option but they didn't have one.  I decided to go with the Eggnog Bread Pudding.  What I liked was the actual bread pudding, it was flavorful, easy to pull apart.  What I didn't like - it was missing the Eggnog flavor!  If it was just a bread pudding dessert it would be a hit but since it's supposed to be an eggnog flavored bread pudding and it's missing that flavor, it can be a let down.

I would give the restaurant 3.5 stars, if I could... We were visiting family and friends in Chicago and decided to check this restaurant out. The sweetbreads were lovely, well prepared. The ""pate"" was more like a cold, pressed loaf and not your standard liver-y smooth version of pate. For dinner, the pork shank was delicious, scallops delightful... trout was very simple and slightly bland and the braised oxtail gnocchi was VERY salty. Bread pudding was the best of the three desserts - the other two were a nice chocolate and the pear or apple crisp was typical, nothing outstanding.",0.9847,0.731,0.247,0.023,0.652922077922078

The staff is super friendly, and it's BYOB. The food is really great. Some of the stuff on the menu feels a bit southern-inspired, and perhaps along that theme are actually quite salty. For instance, the fried oyster in its batter is very salty by itself, but it comes on a bed of cream cheese grits and vinegar that you eat the oyster with, and if you do it foils the salt. The food is very good, and everybody is so nice. The only thing is to call ahead or make a reservation; but even if you have to wait, the neighborhood is pretty fun to wander around in, or just go up a few blocks to Kafka to get a nice bottle of wine.",0.9946,0.723,0.264,0.013,0.5968333333333333

We struggled half the night to find a place for the wine and the water and the appetizers and forget about the bread plate. That coupled with the fact that the very near neighboring table was also packed with 4 peeps, it was a nightmare. The foccacia bread to start was dry. The balsamic needed some olive oil to spruce it up. The appetizers were alright. The fritters were cooked too much that their shells were burnt dark brown. The figs wrapped in bacon were also overly cooked and just had that bitter bite at the end. I liked my paparadelle a lot but wish it was served hot. The noodles were tasty and cooked properly but luke warm. That was off putting. Dessert was a total let down. Who doesn't have a chocolate dessert option? No thanks to the bread pudding or some sort of custardy thing. Get some chocolate stuff on the dessert list!

I knew it would be great, but as a self-proclaimed 'foodie', the food here was honestly one of the best I've had in Chicago!  Perfect waiters and an exceptional array of chefs. Whoever invented the mint fettucine with duck is a genius. And the beef tongue, although I stayed a bit away from it, was met with RAVE reviews by my group.  My favorite was the corn salad - a perfect mix of sweet, salty and spicy. HIGHLY recommend as a starter. the bacon wrapped dates, a close second -- delectible, yum!!!!!!! Treat yourself to this place. It's BYOB, cute, cozy, intimate, sophisticated, reasonably priced and REAL cuisine.  The only downside would be the plug by the wait staff for the mussels - although good, they were too pedestrian for the 'real' food that was on the rest of the menu.  The chefs are amazing and friendly as well. We had the pleasure of going back in the kitchen and thanking them. We met Victor (the originator of my favorite mint fettucine with duck pasta!) and he was more than gracious.

2011-09-29,5.0,"Ate here last night -- it was only my second time, which is sad because it's right down the street from me! Went for the ever-popular prix-fixe and couldn't have been happier. What really surprised me, though, was HOW MUCH FOOD came with this -- good lord. It was definitely a bit much for two people -- one appetizer, one salad or dessert, and one entree each per person -- but that's definitely not a bad thing for $30! Just prepare to be stuffed, or don't eat much the rest of the day! My mom and I ordered the heirloom tomato and arugula special, the artichoke fritters, the charred corn salad, the pepper parpadelle, the veal bolognese special and the bread pudding. The heirloom tomato appetizer/salad was outstanding, but it's not hard to mess up tomatoes, arugula, olive oil and salt, haha. Nonetheless, I really enjoyed that they made a special point to fit the last of the season's tomatoes into their menu and I was not disappointed! The egg topping was a little strange, but not bad. The artichoke and edam cheese frittes were AMAZING. I mistakenly thought they meant edamame, but this cheese was a welcome surprise. These taste like a cross between hush puppies and super rich artichoke...something. They're not light, so we almost didn't finish them. Almost... The charred corn salad was probably my least favorite. It wasn't bad, but it was just a random mix of things and didn't really do it for me, but I'm also not too big on corn. The spicy walnut crunchy things in it were pretty good though. Both pasta entrees were absolutely incredible. I licked my plate clean, and took home my mom's leftovers (sorry mom!). The homemade pasta was especially amazing in the parpadelle -- super dense and chewy, but not in a bad way. I didn't want either of these dishes to end. Finally...well, just make sure you order the bread pudding if it's on the menu. I can't even do it justice, but I imagine it's made with an entire stick of butter. It was out of this world, and a huge portion (enough for 2-3 easily) to boot. Seriously, get this stuff -- you will die happily. Make reservations early, especially for Wednesdays.

2011-09-10,5.0,"Was in Chicago, IL visiting a friend for a mini vacation. I'm originally from LA and we really don't have nearly a diverse a neighborhood food culture that all the Chigagoans seems to  have.in  fact I haven't even ever heard of a BYOB until I came here.... Well, I have to say, I really can't give this place nearly enough praise. The service was great (though a bit leisurely, which I actually enjoy since when I go out, I want to enjoy my evening eating), The host at the front of the house was amazing and kept checking on us all night for feedback and would talk to us about how the restaurant began and everything. finally, The food...the Food was spectacular.  For the evening, my friend and I started by sharing a half order of their Amsterdam Style Black Mussels, a plate of their Almond Stuffed Dates wrapped in Bacon, The Crispy Veal Sweetbreads and the Housemade Pierogi.   I can't really say which I reccommend more since each one was delicious in it's own right. Here is a quick rundown: Black Mussels: These are the most uniquely spiced mussels I have ever had. I eat a lot of Belgian style Black Mussels and these are probably the most different I've ever had them. The sauce was deliciously spiced in this amazing beer broth that also has star anise and basil in it. Defintiely delicious and different from other black Mussels I've eaten. Almond stuffed Date wrapped in Bacon: It's sweet, it's savory, it's crunchy and nutty. There are simply so many flavors and textures packed into the little delicious morsels. I could seriously eat like an entire bowl of just these. Part of the best things about them is when you get some of the crispy brown sugar crust on it that gives you like a nice burst of sweetness right before you get to the crispy and salty bacon.  Veal Sweetbreads: I love Sweetbreads. These were amazing and came with this amazing house made jalenpeno based hot sauce to go with it. these was crunchy on the outside, but had this rich and tender texture on the inside and played extraordinarily well with the homemade hot sauce. Pierogi: Soft and delicate with this outstanding  foie gras mousse stuffing that interacts so well with the creaminess of the benecdictine spread and the sweetness of the plum jam on top. Definitely a huge burst of flavors with every bite. For out main entrees, my friend had the braised Pork Shank and I had one of their specials, the Crispy Pork Belly. The Pork Belly was amazing. It was crunchy and crispy on the outside, but had this remarkable creaminess to the inside. the sauce it came with was nutty and savory. The Fresh cherry tomatoes just popped in your mouth like little bubbles of flavor. It was fantastic. Finally for the dessert, we shared a decadent Chocolate Banana Brioche Bread Pudding. Now, I've eaten a lot of bread pudding in my life, some great, some not so great. This ranks pretty high up their for me. The chocolate they used wasn't too sweet and had a great bite to it. the bread still had texture with the creaminess. The best part of this meal, however, was the value of it all. back in LA, this would easily cost me double what I paid for it at HB. It was fantastic. They give you quite the bang for your buck. Plus, the host was telling us that they have an even better deal on Wednesdays where you can build your own Prix fixe menu for about $30.  I highly recommend this place to everyone.

One note - They are the perfect restaurant if you want great food before a Blue Man Group performance which is a short distance away. Their menu changes so some of this may not be available now. Beef Cheek with Cheese Grits - I ordered this.  It's basically a beef roast that has a little more fat in it allowing for lots of flavor.  I loved it and the grits underneath melted in my mouth.  A huge hit. Pistacio Scallops - My husband ordered this and he thought it was average with little flavor.  It was the special and he didn't go with any of what the waiter had gotten done telling us were the most popular dishes.  If he tried the chef's experiment and it wasn't good, then it was my husband's problem.  Bravo to the chef for experimenting with different flavors. Fish Dishes - I can't remember what my niece ordered,  I believe it was a trout dish, but not on the menu.  I don't think you can go wrong with any of their fish recipes....all of them were said to be popular orders by the waiter and my niece who is a Pescatarian loved it. Spagetti Bolonese - Not good.  My other 18 year-old non experimental neice tried this and didn't like it.  Too much meat and not enough thick sauce.  I appreciate the chef putting something kind of normal on the menu for people like her, but for an american restaurant with a dutch influence I think they may want to stay away from Italian references; they'll just not be able to compare theselves to the everyday (boring) Italian places in the city.

Burnt Toast? I don't think so. If it weren't for the BYOB feature and awesome location I would think that this place wouldn't survive anywhere else in the city.

What is nice is they are BYOB as well, so you can enjoy a gourmet meal with a very reasonable tab. There is a wine store conveniently located nearby in case you forget to bring your own. They also feature a great Prix Fie on Wednesdays where pretty much the entire menu is fair game (only a couple of the most expensive dishes incur a nominal upcharge) and sometimes have fun events such as an Easter Brunch (that was outstanding). In addition to providing customers with top quality cuisine, they treat their customers well.  I highly recommend the HB to anybody who appreciates good food.

The grits underneath were creamy and supported the pork cheek perfectly. It had flavors on top of flavors a real character in a meal. I also tried the mussels with truffle oil fries. These were like crack. The mussels were tender and juicy. They had a black licorice hint in the back which made them very unique. And the fries were just otherworldly.

However, HB gave us gift certificates for our trouble.  How nice!! FFWD 1 year!  My friend is back in the states and we make reservations at HB again.  This time, we get in, and on a wednesday... which is PRIX FIX wednesday, or price fix, whatever.  So it's 30 bux for an appetizer, main dish, and dessert.  Awesome deal, because the gift certificate was for 30$!  My friend got an EXCELLENT hamburger.  It was huge and had all kinds of goodies on it, including pickled green tomatoes and more things I can't remember.  It also was the special, so possibly when you go and ask for this excellent burger, they will say, ""Sorry charlie, that was a one time thing and now is not that time.""  Don't pout though, the other food was alright. We also got the almond stuffed dates in bacon.  I don't get the hub bub over these.  They were good, but tasted identical to the bacon wrapped dates at cafe babareeba and/or other places.  It's not like you can only get these at HB.  Even though there is no almond involved at other places, I didn't really taste the almond much. We also got a few other appetizers which I feel are not worth mentioning. I got the beef cheek for my main dish, and it was good.  It was not great. It was tender, but I was not surprised because it was braised beef cheek.  That is always tender, at least when I've had it.  Don't get me wrong though, it was tasty, and I probably ate more of it than I should have.

I don't know what it was, but that stuff was like crack.  For our appetizer, we had the veal sweetbreads. I have wanted to try sweetbreads for quite awhile, so this was a big time treat for me. They were perfectly spiced, perfectly cooked, and absolutely delicious.  We had a hard time deciding on entrees with all the tasty sounding options, but we finally went with the beef cheek and the pork shank. They were so good, and I can't even tell you which one was better. The pork shank was so tender that you didn't need a knife, served with mushrooms, pickled onions, and a white bean puree that were all super complimentary. The beef cheek was served with a Henry Bain sauce. I'd never heard of it before, but it tasted kind of fruity, yet a bit spicy (in a horseradish kind of way) and it just complimented the rich flavor of the beef perfectly. It's all about the subtleties here with the flavors. Just perfection, really.  For dessert we got a half order of the house made chocolate bar, and it was just beautiful. I think it might have brought a tear to my eye. Ok, maybe not, but you get the idea. Service was leisurely, but that's what you'd expect here. You don't want to be rushed, and the servers were very professional and extremely knowledgeable.  It had a great unpretentious, homey, atmosphere and we felt quite comfortable there. And for what you get, the price can't be beat. Just go. Do it.",0.9984,0.756,0.236,0.008,0.6387602627257799

Though the taste of my black grouper was definitely top shelf, I thought-bubbled what my friend eventually said out loud... ""that portion is a bit on the small side eh?""   He is a globe trekker that appreciated the tenderness of his braised beef cheek entree... and is probably biased because out of all the fine dining spots in the city, this is his favorite.  My grouper was drizzled with a pistachio pesto and had a bit of black licorice in the taste, I'd swear.  It's an odd combination but one I appreciated, even though I'm not a black licorice fan.   We asked the chef to pick a dessert and he raved about the bread pudding.  He was spot on because the treat was so delicate and fluffy that it toppled over as he gently set it on our table.  Chef was unhappy, but it really wasn't a big deal because we were just waiting to topple it with our spoons, anyway.  The menu suggest that it's a cinnamon almond bread pudding, but I was delightfully overwhelmed with fresh lemon zest and homemade whipping cream on top.

Speaking of the food, every dish was better than the rest.  Here's what we had: Almond stuffed dates (wrapped with bacon and baked with brown sugar):  I'm a vegetarian but was told they tasted even better than they smelled, and lived up to the ones at Avec. Watercress on Skordalia (radishes, red onion, crumbled egg, toasted pumpkin seeds, and pink peppercorn vinegarette):  well-balanced, fresh, and perfect amount of dressing Mussels (beef broth, anise, dried basil, garlic, truffle fries):  the plumpest mussels I have ever had - so tasty you didn't need the broth (although tasty, was not the best we've ever tasted) Braised Beef Cheek (weisenberger mills cheese grits, ""henry bain"" sauce, jus, charred cippolini salsa verde):  amazing Sautéed Whitefish (fava bean puree, curried okra, and malt vinegar reduction):  perfectly crispy skin, and I will never have another puree again Oxtail Ragu:  perfectly cooked pasta and noted by the orderer as the best dish of the night! House made Belgian Chocolate Candy Bars with coconut and cayenne:  so great and the restaurant gave us more to take home The only thing the restaurant must work on is the bread they bring out in the beginning - its cold foccaccia that's a little dry (accompanied by an amazing balsamic reduction though).

Location: Great location - smack in the middle of a busy neighborhood with lots of shops, bars and restaurants.  Parking is no problem with tons of metered parking everywhere. Decor and Mood: Great - it was cozy and not too much of the in-your-face hipster avant-garde going on.  It seemed a great place to either take family, friends, or even a date for a candle-lit dinner. Service: Excellent.  Our waiter was kind and checked in on us often enough.  Endless dipped bread was provided on cue and we never ran out of water.

For her entree, my friend got the veal chili on what had to be au dente noodles which were a little too au dente for my taste - it felt like noodles that had been out just a little too long and were very rubbery.  The chili was nothing special. For my entree, I got the other special of the day which was a Chicken Mousseline - it was NOT too bad but it seemed very one-note.  Like it was missing a major acid or something else to eat alongside.  However, the worst problem by far was the absolute saltiness of the crispy skin - in the end, what could have been a great dish amounted to some one-note over-salty chicken sausages that definitely left me craving a lot of water.

You'll love whatever entree you order, you won't pay ridiculous prices and it's BYOB. I've visited HB three times and had three excellent dishes.

Downsides:   None come to mind....other than it can sometimes be hard to get a reservation for a prime time (friday/saturday nights).

2011-02-14,4.0,"My husband and I were kind of at odds about where to go for Valentine's Day. We wanted to go somewhere new, but we wanted a good meal as well.  We had wanted to try HB for awhile, so I made a res and off we went.  Cute/dark/romantical little place. It's also BYOB, so we brought a bottle of Delirium Noctournm and Prankqster beer. It's sort of a fusion of New American Food and Dutch food, and both of those please me. We had been to Amsterdam/Brussels earlier this year and we had a great time and a lot of great food experiences and I was really hoping HB could match what we had in Europe. We started out with the Escargot / Edam and Artichoke Fritters with garlic aioli and both were super tasty. The fritters were really rich (deep fried, crispy outside with a mild, creamy inside) and the aioli was super garlicky. I loved it, but any more than that small portion would have been too much. It was VERY rich. For main courses, I ordered mussels (""Amsterdam Style"") that came with truffle frites with more garlic aioli. My husband ordered a lamb stew with beans and other goodies.  Now, here's were I am debating how to rate the mussels. I have been to the CAPITAL OF THE MUSSEL WORLD, Brussels. Nothing can compare to those. Those are far and away the most delicious mussels I've ever had. The mussels that HB served were quite different from that (heavy handed on the anise), but still good. They weren't as good as the ones I had in Europe, but I'm not sure that's a fair comparison to make. That's how I feel about that. The frites were off the charts delicious. My husband liked his stew, as well. For dessert we ordered a caramel cheesecake with homemade whipped cream and pecans. My husband was skeptical since he finds cheesecake to be too rich at times, but this WAS THE BEST CHEESECAKE I HAVE EVER HAD. I had such a unique flavor and the light whipped cream cut the richness of the cheesecake. It was sweet and delicious, but light at the same time. Our waitress was awesome and did a wonderful job, to top things off. The bill was reasonable and we would both go back to try other things on the menu.

If I had to come up with one complaint (and it's really not a complaint,) it would be that the place does get loud when the restaurant is full. However, the intimacy of the restaurant, the comfort in the food and the warmth of the staff supercedes this all-too-minor criticism.

The sweetbreads were quite good though, fried but not greasy and very tender.  The escargot was a complete disaster.  It was seriously awful.  I kind of get a sick feeling even thinking about them. I am giving HB 3 stars mainly because the entrees redeemed the restaurant somewhat.  I had a pork knuckle with papardelle.  It kind of seemed more like pork roast than knuckle, but it was good.  My husband had a special that was sausage and grits, which was also good, except the gravy was really vinegary.",-0.9594,0.712,0.095,0.193,0.6073593073593074
2011-01-06,2.0,"After talking with the manager via Yelp I've decided to pull my previous review and update HB with an attempt to be a little more constructive. First, let me say that I know my experience is not the norm and from what my friends have said it was far from it.  But I was not overly impressed with the food at HB.  We did go on a Pre-Fixe night so take our review with that in mind.  And in the end, we saw some disturbing things with regards to service. STARTERS:  Crab Bisque was good, interesting, and surprisingly light.  Mushroom Strudel was good on the mushroom side, but the ricotta did not go well with the mushroom, nor was it mixed well.  We ended up with a mushroom side and a ricotta side and the ricotta was just too much by itself and there were not enough mushrooms to prevent the ricotta from being overpowering.  Pear & Arugula salad was standard. DINNER:  The Haddock was a good standard dish, but uninspired.  It lacked anything that separated this dish from any other fish dish I've had.  That being said, maybe my expectations were too high here.  The Chickpea Fritter with the Haddock was horrible in multiple ways from consistancy to taste.  After speaking with the manager he acknowledged an issue and has said that this has been remedied.  The other dish we had was a Homemade Sausage Special with Molasses.  The Molasses was weak in flavor and runny.  The sausage did not hold an interesting flavor on its own and we took it home to put on a skillet the next morning.  The grits served with the sausage I thought were okay... which is bad news because I hate grits.  My fiance said they tasted like they were from a box, which I admit is my basis for comparison since she is a grit expert in comparison to myself. DESSERT:  I'm not sure if our server did a poor job explaining this dish to us or not.  What we got was this frozen chocolate cake thing, which must have been rushed because it tasted and looked like something you get out of a store with just a little extra plating.  It wasn't bad though. SERVICE:  The bus boy was awesome and provided us with our best service we got here, but this is were things got appalling for us.  We were barely visited by our waiter.  Considering how busy the night was and the speed in which our food came out this was unacceptable.  A couple of kind words go along way to letting us know we still matter.  But what really sent us over the edge was when the manager pushed a two-top into another table that a couple was still dining at, to make room for a party of 4 still waiting to be seated.  Let me say this again - THE MANAGER PUSHED A TABLE INTO THE TABLE OF ANOTHER COUPLE WHO WAS STILL DINNING TO PREP THEIR TABLE THAT THEY WERE EATING AT FOR A PARTY WHO WAS NOT BEING SEATED YET.  Even the people who I know, who loved HB could not imagine this level of disrespect in any restaurant. EXTRAS:  My talks with the manager on yelp were both good and bad.  Overall this place needs to learn to deal with the rush.  The manager first tried to blame us for our bad dinning experience because we intimidated him and he was too scared to appoach us.  But later he had the humility to back up and say he was honestly overwhelmed with the number of people coming in and out of their establishment.  He has said they are working to correct the issue and I really hope they do... and if they do, I'll give them another shot potentially. In the mean time - 2 stars because my previous review used the work ""meh"" which is the yelp definition for 2 stars. RECOMMENDATION:  Don't go on a Wednesday.  Man up the extra bucks and hopefully you will get some better service than we did... and from what I've heard - better food too.",0.9291,0.796,0.114,0.09,0.5064319343556632

I can say, without a shadow of a doubt, that I ate the best chicken dish I've ever been served at HB.  They had a special last Friday composed of a crispy skinned fried chicken quarter served atop Brussel sprouts, parsnips, and some kind of nut.  The skin of the chicken melted richly into my tongue with every bite and the vegetables were a perfect crispy, roasted, buttery compliment to this. Other fine points include the artichoke-Edam cheese fritters served with a mild aoli; delicious - I'd been eyeballing those from the moment I'd laid eyes on their menu and they lived completely up to my expectations.  More cheesy than artichoke-y, but this is not a problem; the flavor is excellent and goes well with wine, which with artichokes, can be tricky. Speaking of wine, BYOB.  I wasn't aware of this fact; I'd thought they just have a ""BYOB night"", but apparently all BYOB all the time.  This is a very, VERY good thing for the budget-strapped winegeek like the one I'm marrying; two bottles of wine with dinner here is less expensive than four glasses elsewhere.

I'm gonna try to sound smart for the next 20 seconds.  (but that's all I can muster... oh.. and I said, ""try"") *Ahem*  In statistics and in medicine we have this concept of ""Pretest Probability"" - which is the likelihood of having a disease even before you perform a confirmatory test.  For example, if I see someone with say...oh I dunno... A SWORD THROUGH THEIR ABDOMEN.... I have a fairly high pretest probability that they injured something, probably severely, inside their abdomen even before I get a confirmatory CT scan.  Apply this concept to Home Bistro restaurant and I had a HIGH pretest probability that everything would be great even before I did my confirmatory test of... the food hitting my stomach.  This was based on: 1) Unique Menu 2) Dutch chef 3) BYOB 4) infamous MUSSELS 5) raved about on YELP  I'll hit the high points first.  The restaurant is cozy and small, very warm and great ambiance.  Very HOMEY and BISTRO-Y, if that hasn't been used yet :) We got by without reservations on a friday by showing up to eat at 5:30 which is a good tip, otherwise no free tables until 9:45 pm Last great thing is BYOB, as advertised HEAVILY.  I'll get into this later. We ordered a lot and honestly I was just disappointed by the taste of the food.  There seemed to be a trend towards heavy, rich and salty in the menu so be aware of that.  1. artichoke fritters - dense, thick, salty, with a side of equally salty garlic aioli (which reminded me of the garlic sauces in LA, see my Zankou Chicken review) 2. Almond stuffed dates -  tasty, yes, but small.  Served in a small tray there were 8 peanut sized bacon wrapped brown sugar dates on toothpicks.  overpriced, which was a trend 3. Crispy Veal Sweetbreads - sooooo dissappointing, this was the first time I was let down by thyroid and/or pancreatic tissue!! Ok, well maybe I've had a string of good luck up to this (see Schwa review).  But first off I claim false advertising because they weren't crispy.  Fried, yes - but soggy and fried.  The sweetbreads were very chewy and the accompanying sauces and hummus were rich and salty and did not enhance anything 4. Mussels - oh the let downs would not end in this meal!  I have heard great things about the HB Mussels + truffle fries.  I was surprised they weren't an appetizer but I wanted them so I ordered them anyways.  At nearly 20 dollars very pricey for any mussels I've had anywhere.  Can't be the truffle fries because I can get those at Big and Littles for $3.50.  Flavor just didn't do it for me.  The anise was very strong, and overwhelming, and most offensive was the salt attack again which was pretty heavy handed and (I'm bragging a bit here)  I have a pretty high tolerance for salt.  The BROTH which if anyone who's had mussels knows that a good mussel dish will have you sopping up the broth with any bread you can find in the restaurant or have you drinking it straight up - not so much here.. 5. Trout, Short Ribs, Pork Knuckle Pappardelle - All Rich and Salty 6.  Bread pudding - VERY GOOD actually 7. Apple crisp - NOT very good Looking back, I realize that French food (maybe Dutch food too, though I wouldn't know) tends to be rich and salty.  BE SURE TO BRING PLENTY OF WINE BECAUSE YOU WILL NEED IT.  Rating based on so many disappointments among the many we tried, obviously there is much more to the menu. Honestly, I think this place is so successful because it is BYOB, and I think the menu pricing factors that convenience into account because everything seems to be 25% more that I think it should be.  The $30 wed pre fixe which seems more reasonable.

I had a salmon filet in a chantarelle sauce which had a particularly tasty, crispy skin, with plenty of pepper that gave it some kick. It came with a cauliflower puree, which I thought was an interesting idea (though cauliflowers aren't the world's most interesting tasting food). But the real reason I am writing this review is the desert. I had a caramel and strawberry brioche bread pudding and it was the single best thing I have tasted in months. It was soft and creamy with the perfect level of sweetness. It's been three weeks and I'm still dreaming about this desert.

My girlfriends and I went to dinner on Saturday night.  We had reservations at 8pm and arrived  promptly before our reservation in fear that we would lose it.  Unfortunately, the ""large"" table was still being occupied by the people who had the reservation before us and they were in no rush.  Unfortunately the restaurant doesn't have a bar and there's barely any kind of waiting room so the bottles of wine we brought to drink couldn't even be opened while we waited.  Sadly we waited about 15 minutes before we were seated, but from that time on everything was impeccable.   We shared the artichoke fritters, fresh mozzarella and bacon wrapped dates to start - both were so delicious, but the entrees are where it's at.  Me and 2 of my friends split 3 dishes - The fluke, mussels and the pork knuckle parpadelle.  All three were so amazing.  The broth in the mussels was so delicious and the fries were extra crispy.  The fluke was maybe my favorite thing it was nice and crisp but so creamy and smooth.  The parpadelle was so fresh and the pork was extremely tender.  We ended the night with the Baklava and bread pudding.  I don't know that those are consistent items on the menu but if they're offering the bread pudding when you're there than I recommend you order that.  It was so good.

Not only were the mussels cooked to absolute perfection, but the beer broth was absolutely divine. But HB didn't earn five stars on mussels alone - the entire experience was wonderful. My date started with the veal sweetbread, which he finished in about five minutes, while I had the cheese tasting. All three Goudas were excellent choices. And the truffle fries that accompanied my mussels were delicious. The waitstaff was very polite and pleasant, and the atmosphere was quiet and cozy. And of course, HB is BYOB, which is very appreciated. It's equally perfect for date night or an evening out with the girls.

The space was set up awkwardly, felt a bit cramped with uncomfortable chairs and tables that are too small, and was too dimly lit even for my taste. The candle on our table went out three times and had to be replaced and re-lit, which was kind of annoying. I would like to see what I'm eating and not have our dinner interrupted three times.  Service was professional, not overly friendly, but just right. The food was the star of this show. Artichoke and edam fritters for starters, unique and tasty. My dining companion had the braised beef short rib which I had a taste of and I wish I had ordered because it was the best short rib I've ever tasted. It was so tender it just came apart, you could eat it with a fork. I had a white fish of some kind (I don't remember and since they have a seasonal menu, I couldn't look it up online) served over hummus with a cucumber salad. It was perfectly cooked and flavorful and the hummus was a nice twist. I honestly don't remember what we had for dessert (I get fuzzy after a bottle of wine), but I remember not being all that impressed by it, might have been a bad pick on our part because they were out of their other desserts.   A meal here can be quite affordable since it's BYOB. Don't even think about showing up without a reservation because this place is really small and there are only a few tables and people tend to linger. The space, ambiance, and service were all ok, but what really matters is the food and HB delivered big time in that department.",0.9736,0.849,0.107,0.044,0.5880511463844796

The place is intimate and romantic but with no ostentation, it has a familiar and friendly atmososphere, and the music is not cheesy.

As a start, they brought us a few pieces of bread (actually focaccia) with some balsamic vinegar and seasoning, which I appreciated. We shared artichoke&edam fritters as a starter, and their soft and creamy heart had already won us over. Then I had the mussels and he had the salmon, and both were really tasty and fresh (special mention goes to the broth that came with my mussels!!). Portions were not huge so we went for desserts, and that was a glorious ending!! We had the ""ho-ho"" (very refreshing, chocolaty roll) and the most wonderful dessert ever, the bread pudding with strawberry conserve. I'm usually not a big fan of dessert, but I totally LOVED it!! Warm and soft, sweet but not too much, it really blew me off!! The service was also excellent, fast and nice. Price is mid-range, but it is good for what you get.

We have frequented tons of places in the city which are all very good, but I am not sure if I would go there again if it weren't for the BYOB aspect. This is not the case here, I LOVED this place regardless of the alcohol.  We arrived to a pretty small and dimly lit restaurant. With the added touch of exposed brick, the atmosphere was wonderful. They had a large table they were setting up for the 6 of us when we walked in. The hostess immediately took one of our wine bottles and opened it, making sure we had drinks as soon as we sat down. They started us off with some bread and what tasted like a balsamic reduction sauce. The menu isn't large, but each of us had multiple dishes we were deciding from. They also had multiple specials which included appetizers and entrees. We decided to go with the crisp fried oysters and the Gouda tasting to start with. The oysters were amazing. They were accompanied by cream spinach and a lemon fennel oil. I am a huge oyster fan, both raw and cooked, and I loved them. My sister, who is not a fan, loved them as well. The Gouda tasting came out with about 5 different cheeses along with some crackers and a jelly. Of course the cheese plate was delicious! Like I said, for entrees we were all torn between a few dishes. I ended up with the Mussels and truffle fries. It was a HUGE portion, I had no chance of finishing it. The flavor of the mussels were delicious and very fresh. The truffle fries were great as well, with the truffle being just subtle enough not to overwhelm. It came with what looked and tasted like a garlic aioli, but I didn't use it as it looked like mostly mayonnaise. The only other dish I tasted was my fiance's. He got the special which was a veal osso bucco a-top creamed corn and topped with bacon and a sauce. AMAZING! I hope they make it a menu staple! Other dishes ordered were the seafood boulibase (which was another special) and the fried catfish. Everyone loved their meals. For dessert we all split 2. We had bread pudding and what they described as a home-made ""Ho Ho."" Both were delicious. All in all, it was a great experience. We brought 4 bottles of wine and each bottle was opened before or as soon as a bottle was finished. They service was great, as the waiter and hostess were both very attentive.

Visits: Once, dinner I could go on about the service*, the atmosphere**, or the price***, but why bother when the real star here is the food? Appetizer - Fried artichoke and edam. ( youtube.com/watch?v=ufJT… ) I probably shouldn't have ordered a deep fried, cheesy appetizer, but ... how could I resist? So good I ate four of the six balls even though I knew I should be saving room for the other two courses. FULLNESS RATING: Full. Entree - Pork chops with mango something something reduction and grits. Oh man, they gave two giant pieces of pork, each like an inch thick. It was crazy. Cooked to perfection and seasoned perfectly - a little salt, pepper, and a slight tanginess from the mango sauce. So good. Only thing I woulda changed was the grits.  I'd rather have mashed potatoes. But it's probably better they offered grits since I wouldn't have been able to fit the mashed potatoes in my tummy. FULLNESS RATING: Erg. That doesn't feel so good. Dessert - I was already stuffed to the gills when I finally got to dessert - blueberry bread pudding. The waiter said it was kinda the thing they were known for, and boy can I see why. Warm, pillowy, sweet, comforting. This is officially going on my list of perfect foods****.  It was so good my taste buds took over my body and scarfed down 3/4 of it before my stomach even realized what had happened.  It got to the point where I had to do the I-ate-too-much wiggle -- you know, the one that goes, ""back and forth, side to side, I need to get more food inside!""

2010-08-17,5.0,"So a friend and I decided that we'd try another new BYOB this summer, so we I began at random just looking on the net, and found some dude's list of BYOB's that he had been to that he really liked.  HB just happened to be on there.  I was shocked to know that it was so close to me, as I live in Lakeview and had never noticed this place -- no wonder, it is extremely small. . . .which I really liked.  If you go, I strongly suggest that you make a reservation before you go.  I'd say it was a very intimate atmosphere.   We began by talking to the waiter and hearing about specials and what he recommended. Come to find out the same owner is currenlty building a new restaurant -- same type of food -- up north in Andersonville. After eating at HB, I will DEFINITLEY be trying out the new restaurant which will be called Vintage. My friend and I generally splite appetizers, but with all the mouth-watering, tempting items we both got our own.  The sizes were right, so eating one on your own didn't detract from your entree. For my appetizer, I knew right off the bat what I wanted:  Sauteed Garlic & Escargot.  It sounded a bit peculiar.  I'm used to eating my escargot just doused in garlic butter. This dish had the escargot very out in the open, so if you can't stand the look of them, this is NOT the dish for you.  What was more interesting is it was served with cherry tomatoes and small orange slices.  Honestly, I thought it was to die for. For my entree the waiter gave me several recommendations. I only eat seafood so he recommended the salmon which I was going to go for, but then I saw the ""Amsterdam Style"" mussels.  Now if you've had the mussels from HopLeaf they are not as good, but these were still damn fine, and it was an abundant amount.  I couldn't even finish mine.  They're served in a beer broth and with thinly cut french fries (I generally like thicker, but these paired better with the mussels) that were called ""truffle fries"" -- not to be honest, I don't know if that means that that is what they were fried in, but again very delicious!  I had sauvignon blanc from New Zealand (my favorite as of late) and it paired well with the light sauce and shellfish of my entree.  Perfet! My friend had the potato salad that has chorizo in it for an appetizer, and pork shoulder for his main dish. Although I don't eat meat, his food looked equally delicious and he certainly seemed pleased as well.  The way they serve their food is beautiful.   We didn't have enough room for dessert, but from what I could spy on at the other tables (I LOVE to check out what others are eating -- I'm so nosey), they looked just as good. I would go back here in a heartbeat.  Its cozy, its classic and the wait staff was wonderful.  No complaints whatsoever on my part!  Best of luck on their new restaurant!",0.9965,0.789,0.158,0.053,0.5848913883735313
2010-08-15,5.0,"What a LOVELY place!   Food is terrific, ambiance is delightful, and the staff are so personable and friendly!  Smiling and energetic Chef Jon Carl came around to most of the tables (including ours) to check up on the meal or answer questions, and the handsome maitre d' David was warm, welcoming, friendly, and fun.  The waitresses were all positive and professional  - the minute you walk into that atmosphere it just sets the tone for a great evening. On to the food:  I'd been drooling over the online menu for a week and knew what i wanted before we even sat down, but then David told us about the specials, and I was hooked - I had the appetizer and entre specials - loved both!  My app was clams and a slow-cooked pork in a savory broth, and my main was Chef Jon's own invention (a take-off on a traditional Louisiana dish) a beautifully prepared cornish hen over a thick slice of bread smothered in a buttermilk gravy with a bacon tomato salad garnish and a side of truffle fries - amazing!  For afters we split a heavenly fluffly white-chocolate mousse, garnished with some kind of cookie-ish crunchiness that we think had malt in it.  The end result was what a box of Whoppers would taste like if they served it in Heaven. For his mains, my husband had the steamed mussels, which he thought were over-salted and over-seasoned (he did pull FOUR star anise out of the bowl!) , and he was perplexed by the pork & clams app -- but even so, he  agrees it's a great restaurant and we'll be back soon to check out everything else Jon Carl has to offer! Last but not least - HB is a BYOB with NO CORKAGE fee!   We walked out for about $80, having just had an amazing meal served by caring, passionate restauranteurs.  Can't wait to go back!",0.9972,0.744,0.231,0.026,0.6086447811447812
2010-08-01,2.0,"If it weren't for all the hype, I could see this getting three stars for average. But I took one away for disappointment. I wanted to like HB very much and you can tell from the reviews that we had every reason to expect a great evening. In fact, I would like to think that we could go back, but there would have to be two very big changes. Things started well. We had a reservation for 5 people at 7 on Saturday. We had none of the parking problems people talk about (no Cubs game?) and were seated immediately.  The warm, family-level friendliness of the staff is all true. The appetizers were as good as promised in all these 5-star reviews you've been reading. Bacon-wrapped figs and chilled creamed corn/crab chowder are worth the trip alone. And the chopped salad was the kind of thing that inspires you to change the way you cook. For most of the food we had after that the creative combinations and flavors were pwnd by a ubiquitous combination of oversalted, overly buttered or oversugared. There was one exception to this on the entree list: the roasted vegetable couscous that my wife ate was light and fluffy and lightly but deliciously seasoned. My wife's comment--the menu was supposed to be seasonal, but most of the foods on it would have been better in mid-Winter than late July. But the killer was the unbelievable noise. When we arrived, the noise was high, but not painful or a complete obstruction to conversation. The music was stuff with words, a little danceable, maybe some Stevie Wonder if I remember correctly. It pushed people to talk loudly, but it was within the range of restaurant noise. Something happened at about 7:45. The tunes switched to all techno-dance and the volume doubled. Imagine being in a room 15' x 30' with no sound-absorbing padding anywhere, and professional dance-hall speakers in every corner rocking out at full blast. Now imagine you have your friends and family with you and you are eating duck with lentils or diver scallops and sun-dried tomatoes and drinking a bottle Chateauneuf du Pape which you've saved for tonight. Forget it. People around us screamed heroically across their tables, not seeming to mind this (made me feel old at 46) and we tried to keep up, but eventually our conversation dried up out of frustration. I suppose I could've asked them to turn the music down, but it seemed like this was the style of the place and even in the pauses of the music the conversation didn't somehow die back as you'd expect. We left without trying the amazing-looking desserts because it was simply too unpleasant to sit there any longer. Final comment: this is definitely an out-of-the-ordinary place with a creative force in the kitchen. But everything seems to get touched up by the salt,sugar, and grease gang before it gets to the table. Maybe in a different location and with a few revisions it could be great. But based on my experience I can't see going back. At any rate, bring earplugs or call ahead and ask about their plans for music that night.",0.9944,0.809,0.139,0.052,0.49944259874492436
2010-07-29,4.0,I love the $30 pre fixe special on Wednesday. It's so much good food for a good price. I liked the bacon wrapped dates and the artichoke cheese fritters. The truffle fries were excellent as well. I couldn't make it through even a third of my main entree (which was the pork belly special with mushrooms and green beans). I took one star off because I thought the blueberry bread pudding was not up to par like the rest of the dishes. The atmosphere is nice and quaint.

Our entree, roasted chicken was spectacular.  My boyfriend brings it up every time I try to keep him from ordering chicken (you know, it's usually not the most inventive dish on the menu) at a nice restaurant.  The flavors were excellent and I found myself fighting him for the skin.

When we arrived for the multi-course family-style meal (they knew I needed some meat on my bones; not really, but let's go with it), I set my Guinness™ cooler backpack on the back of my chair. A co-worker had introduced me to the underworld of icing and I was in too deep to get out now. Our waitress bumped into my bag a few times and asked if she could move it. I pleaded with her not to do so, so that I would not get iced. ""What the hell is 'iced?',"" she asked. I told her. She laughed and exclaimed, ""Boys!"" exasperatedly and went about her business. In the mean time, she poured glass after glass of wine, replaced plates of artichoke cheese fritters with truffle fries, eggplant/roasted red pepper/feta incredibleness succulent seafood, perfectly prepared fish, crisp veggies, mouth-watering chicken, and some of the best desserts I have had in a while (chocolate + sesame seeds = [redacted]). By the end of the meal, my icing victim had left his bag unattended -- as had I. Noting that there was an icing to be had, the waitress notified me that my buddy's bag was sitting in the chair. ""Oh yeah. Danny must have forgotten his bag. I should get it to him."" ""Don't you want to stick one of those things in there?"" Blank stare. ""Those nasty vodka things in your backpack."" ""OH! Yeah! Right!!"" ""Well, you better hurry up. He's coming back."" Sensing sabotage to be afoot, she DELAYED my buddy so that I could place a WARM raspberry Ice in his bag. He came back into the dining room, saw his sad fate and my glee was paramount. Thankfully, in Chicago, you can get a pretty good meal in more than a few places.

2010-07-12,4.0,"Yeah I'm a little late to the HB train but I'm on it now and there's no stopping me! A small group got together for a birthday dinner the other week and I must say, other than a few hiccups things were great. The two issues really shouldn't be issues but they are. I'll get the bad news out the way first. One, the wait time between apps and dinner and dessert were a little long. Not to mention waiting for the check. I was on a tight schedule so they split my check and let me pay but I know my group still didn't leave until 30 minutes after I had left. Two, my friend is a vegetarian and glutton intolerant. The staff was really great about helping her pick things she could eat and/or adjusting menu items so no complaints there but it would seem that if you were going to go through all that trouble you would make sure to bring the dish out correctly and not add the bread to the side of the dish. It was corrected immediately but it irked me. Finally, there is only one bathroom. This can create some chaos when the place is busy. No one likes waiting in line and no one likes you waiting in line right by there table when you are trying to eat. Now on to the good. I don't think I tried a bad thing all night. Luckily I went with a group of people that let me sample of their plates and I of course shared with them. Everything was fan-freaking-tastic! The mussles were to die for, the fried clams were melt on your tongue yummy, the cheese plate was delicious, and the truffle french fries were so good I think inhaled them.

Well, for starters, they are making their own mozzarella which is positively delightful. Served atop yellow tomatoes, cucumbers in a sesame vinaigrette, it's plainly marvelous. The duck? With andouille sausage? And golden beets? Well, this very dish may have swayed my love for the darling beaked birds as live creatures. I've tried duck before and never been terribly impressed, but HB's version with the sausage and beets is really magical. Y.U.M. Cooked to a tender and pink temperature, this duck melts in your mouth. The whole fish is a delightful burst of seafood in your mouth, and the mussels with frites always satisfy the deepest longing for shellfish. So today? Happy tummy. That's always the case when Joncarl is involved. As always, make reservations, as the space is quite tiny. And BYOB. But you knew that. So, I'll remind you: Go to HB. Eat and be happy.

That HB can execute perfection, and repeatedly. Too often I have returned to a restaurant for my favorite dish only to be disappointed by 'second-time fail syndrome'. Have no fear diners, HB gets it done! The condensed 'what you need to know' aka 'what you should order': you will never go wrong with the edam artichoke fritters, bacon-wrapped dates stuffed with almonds and brown sugar, smoked eggplant crostini, pan-roasted trout, 'Amsterdam-style' mussels, any of their chicken dishes, and housemade Belgian chocolate and the bread pudding for dessert.

2010-06-12,4.0,"I pity the fool who happens to find himself trying to enjoy his dinner at the same restaurant as the group I dined with on Wednesday. We take up a ton of space, demand a disproportionate amount of attention from the waitstaff and generally make a scene, usually a consequence of drinking far too much wine with our meals.  So when we first stepped into HB last night for a work dinner, I gazed around with guilt in my heart. This boisterous bunch was bound to tear this cozy, homey little romantic bistro to shreds with our high-maintenance ways. The place had a delicate decor, dim lighting and precious details like antique mirrors that reminded me of a French chateau (if I knew what one of those looked like). But I have to say HB handled us with supreme grace despite their unassuming looks.  First good move: their family style menu. Rather than turning us loose on their eclectic choices, we had a set menu of some of their mouth-watering selections. My personal favorites included their artichoke and cheese fritters, which were like huge fluffy planets of tastiness. I also of course loved their bacon wrapped dates, which were smothered in brown sugar.  The second smart move: BYOB. I know this wasn't invented just for us, but when we have plenty of our own cheap wine and champagne, we're sold. Some of us even managed to get some icing in between courses! To top off a magical eating experience, the service was impeccable. The waitress felt like an old friend by the end of the meal, even asking our advice on her accessory choices and suggesting strategic ways to ice one another.  Cheers to HB for rolling with our punches and coming up on top. Float like a butterfly, sting like HB!",0.9893,0.811,0.159,0.03,0.5203157953157954
2010-06-10,4.0,"Royalty. That's how I felt at last night's dinner at HB. Colleen C, Queen of Yelp Midwest, chose to take our group of sixteen to HB for a family style dining experience.  And while I usually do research on the restaurants I eat at, I didn't get a chance to even catch a glimpse of a yelp review for HB prior to walking in the door... good thing I trust Colleen! So, I walked into this charming restaurant with no expectations at all.  First I noticed the character of the building's interior: a brick wall on one side, mirrors and art on another, and the little bathroom near the kitchen with the sign on it that reads ""library.""  Attentive and friendly service came next and continued throughout the night... and since HB is BYOB, we brought plenty to keep us buzzed and happy for hours! It looks like Abby, Christina, and Mariah already touched on the many courses of gourmet cuisine that we feasted on. The portion sizes were large (just how we like them); the flavors were sensational; and we all left 100% satisfied.   Being queen (or king) for a day (or dinner) is fun! I'd definitely return to HB with friends, family, Yelp community managers, or on a date with my husband... this is the kind of dining experience you should share with those you care about.",0.9889,0.817,0.167,0.016,0.4872619047619048

Good food has character and complexity. GREAT food has soul and that little something extra that MAKES you chew slowly and remember it.  The scene at HB is warm and inviting. Albeit small, our large group had just the right amount of space that made family style dining that much more intimate.  From the vintage mirrors lining the walls to the old school hutch with candle-topped, empty wine bottles, this place just oozed with comfort.  We started with bacon wrapped dates, complete with almond cores, and Edam (artichoke and cheese) fritters that, both, got me salivating from first whiff. Next came seabass on plate. We're talking the whole bass - fins, eyes, bones and all. Clams and shrimp followed. So fresh. Slightly spicy. The last dish, which officially put me over the edge, was chicken atop a bed of cous cous and asparagus.  Despite the lack of space in my stomach, I eagerly indulged in their nontraditional desserts including Belgian chocolate topped with sesame seeds, and strawberry pie with thyme. I carried no shame or regret. HB gave me that little something extra that I will NEVER forget.",0.954,0.815,0.126,0.059,0.4204212454212453
2010-06-10,4.0,"I love family style dining. There's a difference between family style dining and splitting tapas, too! First of all, the portions are larger. Not much larger but there's something to be said for splitting a large plate of food with a table full of people  vs. sharing a small bite.  Second, there's something to be said for the presentation of family style dishes. When they brought out the giant fish (complete with head and tail), I was totally impressed! It's not often I see that offered at a restaurant... Finally, it's the company that makes family style dining so fun. When you work alone 350 days out of the year, being able to see your co-workers face-to-face over a delicious meal is pretty exciting! Passing the plate while catching up on wedding plans or new pets feels good. It's as close to ""coming home"" that we get as Community Managers.

We had a large group -- so large that it seemed we were taking up about 1/3 of the dining room, but the service staff handled everything (including the bunches of wine we BYO-ed) with grace and aplomb.  Top notch service is wonderful, but it doesn't mean much if the quality isn't there in the food. HB brought it, though.  The apps included bacon-wrapped dates, which I pretty much always love, as well as these tender artichoke fritters. Fritters. Wow.  I'm a sucker for fried food a few times a month, but don't eat it much.  If I could eat these fritters closer to home though? That would be dangerous.  They were one of my favorite things I've eaten in months.  What was exceptional, though, was the fact that even in comparison, both entrees (served family-style) that our tables ordered (one fish, one chicken), even exceeded the fritters.  Delectable. The fish was light but packed a flavorful punch. The chicken was tender and made me jealous, wishing I had any clue how to make chicken taste anything like it at home.  Desserts were very good.  I have to admit that I was so full, it was hard to give them their fair chance given the lack of room left in my stomach.  I just had a nibble of each.  I must say, however, that I am very picky about bread pudding, and the texture of this one was quite good.  I'm also a little more curious to experiment with the combination of chocolate and sesame, too.

They were there the second a glass was half empty! When it came to the food, I have to admit - I was a little hesitant when we showed up and there were only a few things on the menu. I was a bit worried there weren't enough items to please everyone. But getting the pre-fixe with the breakfast breads seemed to satify everyone at the table. The breakfast breads and jams were just out of this world. Oh so fresh. Then we moved on to the entrees. AMAZING food. My fiance and I are known for dining out quite a bit, particularly for brunch. I can honestly say this is the best brunch I have ever had!!! Not a ton of selection, but the food is thoughout and prepared just right!! You really don't need additional options when the food is that good. I had the asparagus, coppa and poached eggs. My parents and future in-laws had the quiche gouda, and my fiance had the Kafta Lamb.

2010-03-21,5.0,"HB Restaurant is a quality experience from the moment you arrive to the moment you leave. We recently stopped by for dinner on a Sunday night, and I had the pleasure of eating one of the best meals of my entire life.  Upon entering the rustic room, you are quickly and pleasantly greeted by the host. My boyfriend and I were given a choice of seating, immediately handed menus, and told of their BYOB option. We hadn't remembered wine, but our dinner sparkled on its own, needing no accompaniment. Our water glasses were filled quickly (and kept full throughout the night) and our friendly server told us about the night's specials.  We decided to split the Bibb Lettuce with Roasted Pear Salad, and I must say it was one of the yummiest salads I've ever had. They made it so easy to split the salad, and just brought it out on two different plates, putting the crumbled amish bleu cheese on the side (it was definitely big enough to split).  For entrees, my boyfriend got the 12 Hour Braised Beef Brisket, while I opted for the night's special. It was a mix of slow roasted pork shoulder, cabbage, potatoes au gratin, sausage, bites of duck....I can't even name all the lovely little tastes I had. This dish was honestly one of the best things I have ever eaten. Hot, savory, sour, creamy, sweet, the flavors were so perfectly balanced, each bite was like a little treat.  Not to mention the portions: I ate to my heart's content, and still had enough for a full meal the next day (bonus: the meal was even great heated up in the stove) The service was gracious and classy, the prices reasonable, the portions large, the food phenomenal.

We made reservations in advance for Wednesday night. They offer $30 prix-fix  dinners on Wed. nights. And it's not some crappy selection that they choose for you, you can get whatever you want off the menu for $30 !!!!! How magical is that?  Ok, I had the fritters(fried goodness) mussels(HUGE portion) AmAzInG! and the sour cherry bread pudding- no words can describe my taste buds after that one, the only thing, like I mentioned in the beginning is the frites that came along with my mussels were a tad on the salty side. Who cares, I loved it as did my friends. The staff? Unbelievably friendly. We called over our waiter and the end of dinner to give him a group hug. I must hand it to Lakeview/Boytown.

Food -f-f-f-fantastic!  We got the artichoke fritter appetizers, which were kind of like artichoke-dip hush puppies.  It came with a garlic mayo dipping sauce.  Very tasty.  For our entree we split a heaping bowl of mussels, that came with a huge side of thin fries.  The mussels had great broth and unique flavors.  The fries were also served with garlic mayo and really hit the spot - I think they had truffle oil.  The owner came by and suggested we put a few fries in the broth at the bottom of our mussel dish and let them soak, then eat them ""it's tradition here"". Glad we did.   The main thing this place lacks is size/space.  They do pack you in close to your neighbors and it is hard not to listen in on others.  My hubby and I came with a bag each (mine was wine, his computer straight from work) - so that made it even tighter.

We started with an artichoke fritter desert which was outstanding. I was really looking forward to trying the bacon wrapped dates, but would've had to eat them alone. Next, I ordered a dinner salad which was fine. For my main course, I decided to go with the mussels and they were amazing!!! I've been on a mussel kick lately and they were really so flavorful.  As an added plus, they came with delicious truffle fries. The rest of the table went with the brisket which was also very good.  I must say, this is one of the better restaurants I have been to lately.

The service was really, really, really bad.  We sat there for at least 30 min. before I had to get up and ask someone to please get us water and menus.  I had to get up again 30 min. later to ask someone to please come take our order.  Thank goodness it is BYOB or otherwise we would have never gotten drinks. It turns out it was the owner who took our order and it was clear we were annoyed, and rightfully so.  He apologized and said a staff member had lost a family member that day so they were one man short.  He was very sincere and it is for that reason that I am not knocking off a star for poor service. From that point on the owner was very attentive and gave us a glass of complimentary champagne.  Really nice guy.  The food was very, very tasty.  I had these bacon wrapped figs that were awesome!  The mussels were excellent.  All of our meals tasted really good.

I'm not saying it was bad, just that I would rather spend my money trying other restaurants.  My boyfriend and I went here on a Saturday night with another couple. We had a great table at the front of the restaurant by the main window. That was a plus. We had a couple of appetizers that were pretty good. I personally would skip the almond and bacon wrapped dates since they were not anything special, but the bread they gave with a special kind of sauce was very tasty. Drank some wine and of course ordered our meal. The waiter was pleasant and helpful, but I feel like he was a little too over eager whenever we asked him how a dish tasted. No offense, but you can't use amazing to describe everything and not get expectations a little high.  My boyfriend and I were somewhat disappointed with what we ordered since we both got the same dish. It was the 12 hour braised beef brisket. It was tender, but the flavor wasn't really all that special. One of our friends did get the lamb phyllo dish and it was better than our dish. The fish and chips were another dish ordered at the table and our friend thought it was just ok because it wasn't what she was expecting either.  I love food so I was very open and excited to go to HB, but in the end, I doubt I'll come back just because there are other gems to be tried in the city. It might be worth a trip for some, but maybe my expectations were a little too high and that's what hurt me in the end.  One of our friends did get the lamb phyllo dish and it was pretty good.",0.9924,0.716,0.196,0.088,0.5648875661375662

The service was flawless (I wish I could remember our server's name because she definitely deserves a shout-out...yeah, I said shout-out).  She was super helpful in explaining the menu and making recommendations. We were all a little embarassed not to know much about pork belly, but when we asked about it our server didn't judge us in the slightest. In fact, she said it was an excellent question because pork belly is always prepared differently at different places so it's good to inquire whenever you see it on the menu. She didn't even judge my friend for her terrible taste in wine (white zin).  We ordered several appetizers, but one that really stands out is the rabbit risotto. Who knew rabbit tasted so good?

2010-02-28,5.0,"Once last spring and now again in the dead of winter I have been blissfully enveloped in the cozy blanket of HB.  The food is wonderful (details momentarily), but somehow the service and setting manage to steal the spotlight.  The employees here are full of big smiles, warm enthusiasm, infectious goodwill, and an uncanny penchant for reading minds.  Best restaurant staff in the city in recent memory.  The room is snug and quaint and homey (if a bit clamorous) and creates the perfect mood to enjoy the meal. The first time, I started with the much-recommended artichoke and edam fritters, and have to confess myself disappointed.  I felt that the overwhelming flavor was ""fried,"" drowning out any edam or artichoke.  Thankfully, after that, everything was excellent.  The mussels were wonderfully aromatic (mostly basil) and while I feel that this dish is pretty easy to get right, these were some of the best mussels/broth that I have encountered.  The truffle fries were a bit salty, but tasted great dipped in the mussels broth. My entree was the pork loin, which was excellent--the best pork loin that I can remember ever eating.  I rarely find this piece of meat cooked right, but this was done perfectly--a bit of a crust on the outside and still tender and juicy inside.  And not at all fatty.  With a bit of scallopped potatoes, cabbage, and a few cute slices of sauteed apples, it was a great, great dish. After the spring visit, I looked forward to returning in the winter, because it seemed like a place that would excel at the kind of food which most pleases during the cold months.  And I was so, so right. We started with a brandade which was slightly saltier and fishier than I was expecting, but still worked very well.  I had a bite of my friend's entree, a simple but very satisfying Greek-style lamb pie.   But the real star was my entree, which had piqued my interest on the specials board outside--beer-braised wild boar.  Cooked with tomatoes, root  vegetables, and pepper, dusted with parmesan cheese, and served atop some thick square egg noodles (think big raviolis without any filling), this was the PERFECT winter dish.  It's over a week later now and I can still taste it in my mind...and I want more!  It was so amazing.  All the ingredients worked brilliantly together, and the noodles provided a very nice balance for the strong flavors.  Seriously, I try to avoid hyperbole in these reviews, so please believe me when I tell you that this is one of the ten or so best savory dishes I can ever remember eating in my entire life. Dessert was pleasant but an utter anticlimax after that:  in fact I can't even remember what it was called.  It was a pie in which the ""filling"" was like a really dense chocolate-chip cookie.  I really wanted some milk with it!

Now onto my favorite part....dessert!  Ok so...when the waiter was listing off the desserts, I already knew I wanted to try the famous bread pudding..so we ordered that, and then the waiter said salted caramel brownie and then I was like ok sold!  So then the brownie comes out, it looks like a very thin brownie with whipped cream on top, I take a forkful with whipped cream and caramel sauce on top and at first I am like this is great, its chocolately and warm and gooey with a little hint of salt but as you keep chewing you notice that ew the saltness is not going away and you feel like you are chewing salt!  Ok so HB I love you but can you put a little less salt and a LOT more chocolate into your brownies.  I know you said salty caramel brownie but if I knew I was going to be chewing salt gum, I would have ordered two bread puddings instead!  So now for the bread pudding, it was made just the way I like it, warm bread budding that is warm, intense yet light, drizziled with caramel sauce and whipped cream.  My friend and I were scrapping the caramel off the plates when all of the bread pudding was gone and my friend jokingly asked if I was going to lick the plate..and I actually stopped to think about it.   HB I will definitely be back here!  And I am excited to try all of the other entrees and desserts here!",0.9988,0.746,0.205,0.048,0.6056468253968256

2010-02-01,5.0,"I have to admit, my yelp reviews so far make me look like a novice diner that will give 5-stars to anyone with a plate of food and a forced smile at the door.  Not True.  That being said, HB hit it big on all fronts to score the highly laudable 5 star rating. My first impression took shape when I called for a reservation in anticipation of my mom's visit the upcoming weekend.  The man who I spoke with was extremely accommodating, mentioning that a large party would be there at the time I requested but that they were happy to have us if we didn't mind a little noise (that being said, I didn't notice any abundant noise that evening).  When I confided it was my first visit, my host replied welcome and how happy he was that we would be dining with them.  (who says that in Chicago!?) My mom and I arrived right on time with our bottle of wine in tow.  We were warmly greeted and seated at a cozy table for two.  You can't escape coziness in this one-room candlelit, dining establishment with quotes from famous foodies (like Miss Piggy) painted on the walls.  Almost the vibe of being in a friend's home - but with better food than most friends could prepare!   The food was generously proportioned - more so than I would expect with such high quality ingredients.  We were given little bites of bread and balsamic vinegar to start and ordered the mixed olives.  I ordered the bibb lettuce salad, which was much larger than your typical starter salad and well decorated with pear, blue cheese, pancetta and brazil nuts- very satisfying.  My mom had the house salad, which while more simple, was served with a delicious home made vinaigrette. For our main courses, we ordered the mahi mahi in a tomato ragout and beef brisket in parsnip potato mash, which just about melted in your mouth.  Everything tasted exquisite -  fresh with a well-thought-out balance of flavor.  The beef brisket was more than most people could finish, but still well presented and not glutenous looking in the least. We were too full for dessert, but I can bet it is worth the extra course.  Oh, and did I fail to mention that the byob is free of any corkage charge!  Unbelievable for that caliber restaurant. I cannot wait to return to HB and try even more of their delectable dishes!!",0.9959,0.792,0.172,0.036,0.5598136645962734
2010-01-31,5.0,"For over 20 years my oldest friend , Julie G, and I have been meeting for our birthdays to celebrate together. We met at Bible camp the summer of 1982, and became fast friends and pen pals. She lived in Gurnee and I lived in Racine, WI and our friendship grew from our letters and our annual birthday sleepovers. After college, living across the country from each other, career changes, a marriage and a divorce, we have remained close and finally, after all of these years, live in the same city.  Since moving to Chicago in 2006, Julie and I have continued our annual celebrations by treating each other to dinner and this year decided to try a place that neither of us have tried before. HB was our choice and what a fantastic choice it was to celebrate my 36th birthday.  We arrived at HB around 5:30 Saturday night thinking that it wouldn't be busy during grandpa hours and upon entering the restaurant we only saw one couple sitting at one of window tables. Score! Or, so we thought. The host, who resembled the host from the French restaurant in Ferris Bueller...minus the pompadour and suit...told us that there were no openings. There was a reservation for 30 and another reservation for 10. Damn. Surprisingly, the gracious host and another HB staff talked a bit and seated us right away near the kitchen. At this point we were just happy to have a seat! About 10 minutes later the host came back to offer us the window table that had a cancelled reservation, but by this time we were already cozy at our little table. Plus we could smell all of the delicious food coming from the kitchen! Nevertheless, the staff was accommodating in every way and was just one of the reasons why this experience was so wonderful. Now onto the food.  We started with the artichoke and edam fritters with garlic aioli. in. cred. ible. seriously. I am not a big fan of artichokes and was sort of wanting to try the almond filled bacon wrapped dates that everyone raves about, but Julie is not a date fan so we opted for the fritters and I'm glad we did. Creamy, crunchy, cheesy fried goodness. Everything that a Wisconsin girl loves!  Now for the main entree. I ordered the beef brisket with mashed parsnips, slaw, and jalapeno drizzle. Again...wow. The parsnip mash was creamy, the brisket tender, and the slaw added a bit of tang to make this one of the best things I have eaten so far this year.  And if anything couldn't make our experience at HB any better we just had to each get our own dessert. Julie ordered the sea salt brownie and the decadent bread pudding with dates and caramel topped with 2 candles for my birthday was just for me. All of that soft gooey deliciousness all for me. YUM!  HB was everything you could ever want in a restaurant. Attentive and friendly service, amazing and creative food, and an ambiance great for special occasions or just a nice evening out with your friends.  Thanks HB for making my birthday dinner special and for creating yet another memory for Julie and I to share. God, I love my friends.",0.9989,0.781,0.199,0.019,0.6084226190476192

I had the brisket for the entree and was also able to taste one of their lamb sausages. The brisket was excellent and very tender. The lamb sausage was delicious and was a bit spicy. We then had an assortment of bread puddings and brownies for dessert.

2010-01-28,4.0,"I never write a review based on one visit to a place. After two trips to this BYOB establishment, I can say that it's really great. I've either ordered or tried a bite or two of the bouillabaisse, osso bucco, lamb sausage dish, quail, pork belly, and a chicken phyllo dish. All very good. The only complaint I had on our last visit was the ""creamy grits"" served with the pork belly were nearly flavorless, especially when compared to the other extremely flavorful components on the plate. I know it's supposed to be a starchy base or whatever, but in that mode it's supposed to heighten the experience of the other components, not distract from them because it's bland. Anyway, that's literally the only thing I can think of that needed improvement. Good, attentive waiter seemed to know when to stay and chat and when to leave our group of four to our conversation, which is always nice.

2010-01-23,1.0,"""Just so you know, we have another reservation coming in right after you..."" Yeah, thanks.  I think I got the picture after our server AND the host came to our table less than 20 minutes after we were sat down to remind us that there was another reservation right after ours, so we would need to hurry it along. I made the reservation for 7:00pm.  We arrived at the restaurant at ten after.  As we walked up the steps, I was greeted by a phone call from the host wanting to know if we were going to make our reservation.  Ok fine.  A little strange (most restaurants hold a reserved table for a minimum of 15 minutes, but they're a small place, I get it). It was a party of 3 -- 2 of us arrived first.  We sat down and promptly ordered water and a cheese plate.  Our server asked us if the other member of our party was ""on his way,"" and then again a few minutes later if he was ""close."" We ordered something lady - relax - we just sat down.  This isn't a race.  It's a Friday night.  I know you need to turn your tables and make your money, but we're here to relax.   A few minutes later, a little before 7:30, our third guest arrived.  Before he was even seated at the table the server demanded he give her the wine to open, rattled off the specials, and asked if we needed more time.  Uh yeah, that's be great considering he just walked in and clearly hasn't looked at the menu.  But to quell her anxiety, I ordered another small appetizer which took at least fifteen minutes to arrive at the table.  Between the time I ordered the app and it arrived the server came by and said, ""Just so you know, we have another reservation coming in right after you around 8:45pm.""  Jesus lady, we just took our first drink of wine.  Sod off, really.  But before I could get a second drink from my glass a scraggly, unshaven host appeared table side to tell us (yep you guessed it), the same damn thing.   I'm thinking do I have three heads, is there something gross on my face, what is it about our party that's so offensive to the restaurant you need to rush us out here?  Last time I checked I'm paying you, so back off already.  We quickly ordered our entrees, despite my better judgment to leave the place right then.  Once the entrees hit the table, we sat out a second bottle of wine.  The server stopped to open it, as soon as she saw it of course, and that was the last we saw of her.  That's fine -- it was the best part of the whole evening -- there wasn't a hand on my back ushering me toward the door.   As soon as we slowed down with our entrees, surprise surprise, the check hit the table.  She didn't offer dessert or even check to see how the meal was.  We put our credit cards out, immediately of course, and the host / table siddler, appeared to and whisked it away.  We were only half way through our second bottle of wine.  After we poured the last of it, mind you it's a little after 8:30 now, the host appeared yet again and told us, ""We have a party that's been waiting over 20 minutes.""   What the f*#(@ -- it's a good bottle of wine.  You're a BYO.  Mind if I finish it?  Mind scheduling reservations with reality in mind?  Or just a touch of hospitality, since that IS the business you're in.   And the food, eh, it was decent.  The Amish chicken was good, the risotto underneath was watery and bland.  The Spiced Lamb Pie... well it was alright if lamb is supposed to taste like my working mom's crappy meatloaf topped with cheap ricotta.  And finally, the trout... well the fish was good, but the combination was more like trout alfredo.  I know, whatever, who cares, just shove it down your gullet and get the hell out.  There are more people waiting to be rush through dinner and hack through the soupy food. Overall, I'm gonna go with abysmal.  Thanks Home Bistro... sorry this rant probably took too long.  But I'll say now what I wanted to last night: screw you. :)",0.9944,0.82,0.123,0.058,0.37083045778697954

Beyond that, both the coriander salmon, and the 12-hour beef brisket were excellent.  It's comfort food in my eyes.  And while I didn't have any expectations for the bread pudding, it also was excellent, with a hint of caramel to really bring it home for me.

2010-01-13,5.0,"The food and service at HB has been exceptional all the times I've been here.  First of all, when I go to HB, I usually bring a bottle of wine since it's BYOB, which is awesome.  The atmosphere is nice but casual and very intimate.  It's not overwhelming or noisy, and is perfect for a date.  I've also been here with family and friends alike of varying ages -- and no matter who I was with, we always felt very comfortable and relaxed. As for the food -- the restaurant uses incredibly fresh ingredients, particular in the seafood.  The vegetables also seem very fresh.  I don't always like fish at restaurants, but the dish I ordered last time I was there was superb.  It was done just right, with a lot of flavor, but not overwhelming or salty.  Sadly, it's no longer on the menu.  The good news is the menu rotates so you can try new things.  I've tried the mussels before (which is always on the menu it seems), which makes for a very satisfying dish.  I've also tried a lamb and sausage dish before, and think that their seafood is better than their meat dishes, but both are excellent. I want to make a specific comment about the bacon-wrapped dates.  It seems like these days, every restaurant I go to serves this dish.  A lot of places do it really well; Avec and Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba come to mind.  So unless you want the same thing over and over again, I would recommend trying something different at HB for an appetizer.  It's good but not anything unique. But what is best about HB is the bread pudding!  I don't usually even like bread pudding, but this is the most amazing dessert I think I've ever eaten.  I mean that literally.  It was so good, we ordered another one and I will be ordering it every time I go.  Try it!  You will not be disappointed!",0.9975,0.718,0.237,0.045,0.6529933261183262

2010-01-08,5.0,"I would like to add my voice to the chorus of people singing the praises of HB.  My GF and I went there for the 3-course prix-fixe menu (Wednesday nights, $29 per person).  If you exercise this prix-fixe option, you get to choose 3 courses from a 4-course menu (appetizer, salad, entree, dessert).   We both left very impressed, even after reading all the 5-star reviews on Yelp.  To me, that constitutes a great restaurant and HB is just that. First, the atmosphere and service at HB was fabulous.  The interior was a perfect size as far as restaurants go: big enough to feel like it's a fun, popular spot when it gets full but small enough to have a fighting chance of remembering any face that was there that night.  The noise level was modest and there were lots of great photographs, stencil work, and tile work.  The front-of-the-house staff was friendly, knowledgeable, and appealing.  Our service was on-point and unobtrusive.  The plates were cleared shortly after we were finished and, more importantly, the courses were all timed perfectly, something I really appreciate in a nicer restaurant.  This was one of those rare places where the wait staff seemed more like enthusiastic volunteers than people who are getting paid to work there.  Our waiter that night also had a great suggestion regarding the prix-fixe menu:  Have one person order an appetizer, salad, and entree and the other person order a appetizer, entrée, and dessert (you get to pick 3 out of 4).  That way, the table of two (probably on a date, probably not on a business meeting) gets to try 2 appetizers, 1 salad, 2 entrees, and one dessert!  And don't worry; the portions are big enough to share.  Perfect! So on to the food...  We started with 2 appetizers, the escargot and scallop (there was only 1).  The escargot was good, but it didn't really blow my socks off.  I can't really say I'm a huge fan to begin with so I'm not going to dwell on this too long; I'll let a land snail connoisseur handle that...  The scallop in mustard soup was great.  It was cooked perfectly and came with a little salty treat of caviar on top.  The mustard soup had a wonderful texture and taste.  Next came the Cesar salad and roasted beet salad, both very good.  The Cesar definitely had the heavy ""body"" (raw eggs, anchovies, cheese) that I look for (but never seem to find) in that type of salad.  The roasted beet salad was filled with yummy little candied pecans and an up-front truffle oil-based dressing on the greens.   Finally, the entrée's came out and we stayed impressed.  The coriander rubbed salmon was fantastic, cooked perfectly (med rare) and served on top of a bed of great lentils.  The little candied lemon peels that came with the dish were so good!  The other dish we got was the quail.  It was the best quail I've ever had, hands down.  Juicy meat and a crisp, salty skin... It was so good!  I really loved the duck sausage that came with it too.  I'd give every dish we had 5 stars with the exception of the escargot; I'd give those a three.  But like I said, I don't know anything about snails. So before you eat at HB, do this: Tuesday night, go to the Michigan Ave cheesecake factory.  Order 2 appetizers, 2 salads, 2 entrees, and a decent bottle of wine.  Pay them 150-250 bucks out the door for the meal.  Note the quality of the food.  Then, pick up your favorite bottle of decent wine and go to HB on Wednesday night.  Your meal will cost about 90 bucks with tax, tip, and a bottle of wine, and the food will be INCOMBARABLE.  You'll feel like a genius!",0.9995,0.755,0.237,0.009,0.6248322490113534

We also had the crab basket starter which we didn't realize was just a crab cake.  It was a good crab cake but we felt like we wasted an appetizer (wish we would have ordered something more fun)- I can get a crabcake out here in the burbs. For dinner- I had the brisket cooked in Dr Pepper topped with homemade slaw over potatoe puree. Wow. I've never had brisket like this before. they must have slow cooked it for days! My husband had the pork belly dish which was great but the brisket was a knockout.

HB is one of those restaurants. From its cozy atmosphere created by the antique mirror-adorned wall, beautiful photography by owner and head chef JohnCarl, and makeshift candleholders made from wine bottles left behind by past BYOB diners- to the cheery, accommodating, and just plain cute staff- all the way to the perfect food that I am already craving- HB is a true gem. My two girlfriends and I decided to give it a try after the rave reviews we read on Yelp, and from the moment we stepped out of the cold and into the dimly-lit, bustling atmosphere of HB we were glad we had come. The staff, who had already told us that there would be a wait over the phone, apologized profusely for making us stand, uncorked our BYOB bottle of wine, served us and made small talk while our mouths watered over the food we could see and smell being served around us.  When we were seated no more than 10 minutes later, we ordered the pork with au gratin potatoes and collard greens, the lamb burger, the mussels, and two heaping plates of (to-die-for) piping hot truffle fries. All three dishes were mouthwatering and comforting. My friends and I agreed that it was great value (Entrees between $15 and $24)- and a great spot for a group of friends, a first date, dinner with parents or practically any other occasion.  Loved it.

We liked supporting a small business. Even more importantly than the service, the food was wonderful. We started out eating those almond figs wrapped in bacon, and I almost died they were so good. Then, we ate the crab cake with this really great hot pepper sauce. For our main dish, we split the grouper in red sauce with oysters, and there was more than enough for the two of us.

My fiance had the deep fried haddock, and although I'm not a fan of deep frying fish, this was delicious.

2009-11-05,3.0,"jimandbrittneyeatchicago… Home Bistro was our first go at the Á la Card deck we bought for ourselves as inspiration for the restaurants we'd be patronizing in 2009. Without going into too much of a sales pitch, let's just say this... 52 chef-driven, owner-operated restaurants, $10 off at each, and the deck cost us $30. That says it all, really. As for Á la Card, we say, ""So far, so good."" And we'll probably stop at good for HB this time around. The food was decent, with some high points here and there. We started with the escargot. I've been a pescetarian for less than a year, so I knowingly maybe-possibly-sort of-most likely broke the rules here. And I paid for it. The escargot had an almost gamey flavor, which I attributed to the broth. We ordered the escargot because Jim had never eaten it, and I was hoping it would come out in an escargot dish, all steamy and delicious. Instead, the presentation was only so-so, and the dish ended up a little too meaty and watery. For our second dish, we ordered a beet salad. We both love beets, love goat cheese, and love walnuts (so much so that we often include these items in our salads at home), but this salad almost missed the mark. It was over-salted and lacked something special or unique to HB. But with ingredients like these, it's hard to say it was all wrong. Again, a bit more finesse in presentation may have helped. Brittney's entree was a special that night, salmon on top of clam chowder. Attention Chicago restaurant owners, chefs, and staff: Add clam chowder to a dish, and I will order it. It was so obvious that this dish was one of the night's specials, as can be seen by the presentation alone. Although the goodness of the chowder overshadowed the fish a bit, it's hard to fault someone for phenomenal chowder. The chef took great care with this dish, and it paid off. It was special indeed. Jim ordered the pork. For dessert, we went with caramel bread pudding. The pastry chef was vacationing in Europe, so the only options that night were whatever the not-so-pastry chef could conjure up. It ended up being pretty tasty, but it's rare that either of us would have anything negative to say about dessert. The ambiance of the place was pretty great. The servers and chef appeared to be cut from the same mold. They were all burly men in flannel shirts, which likely serves them well in the heart of Boystown. Overall, the space was pretty quaint and dim. The candles were all lit atop old wine bottles, which was a nice touch. By far the best moment of the evening occurred when the music shifted from poppy-whatever to ""Jizz in My Pants"" by The Lonely Island. We were apparently the only diners listening to the music, because upon looking around to catch a few other smirks and giggles, we caught nothing! We either have impeccable hearing, are extremely immature, or are more in the know about pop culture and dirty SNL skits. You say I'm premature. I just call it ecstasy.

I came here specifically for the lamb burger. No matter what the special was or what was recommended, this is what I wanted. I was with my boyfriend (and another couple) and we started with the bacon-wrapped dates and beet salad. I thought the dates were average, and possibly better in some tapas restaurants. They didn't come with any sauce and I think it needed it.  The beet salad was wonderful. I honestly don't even know what a beet is. We ordered the salad for the feta cheese, which was as delicious as expected. The beets had a nice smooth flavor that complemented the salad well. The salad was big enough to share for an appetizer.  I ordered the lamb burger and it did not disappoint. AMAZING. OMG. This was by far one of the greatest things I have ever eaten IN MY LIFE. The burger was GIGANTIC and so rich and juicy. I could not stop licking my fingers. The fries were borderline orgasmic and would be included in my last meal on earth. They give a mayo dipping sauce, which would normally be a turn off, but it works. And works so well! My boy got the chicken wrapped in phyllo and he LOVED it. I had a bite and all I could think of was ""Boy this really does taste Moroccan."" I don't really know what that means, but if you try it, you will understand. As for the other couple, they started with the heirloom tomatoes which were salty. They also ordered the mussels and the lamb burger. Burger was a great, but the mussels were average. Here are some tips: Make a reservation! Bring your own wine (I splurged for the Trader Joes Charles Shaw. Classy). Dont get there too early because there is not to much room to wait.

We had an 8:30 reservation, but thankfully we called in advance as our table wasn't ready until 9:15 (which in this case was fine because we were running late...but if we there at 8:30, a 45 minute wait, with no waiting area/bar, would have been aggravating).  Once we were seated, service was very accommodating and quick. As they are a BYO, expect to bring your own booze (which everyone seemed prepared with -- including individual cocktail shakers at the next table). In our case they were nice enough to offer to run across the street to 7-Eleven to get mixers for the booze we carried along.  For apps, we tried the artichoke/cheese fritters, which were heavy and dense, but excellent. We also tried the baked crab app, which most everyone liked. Both were generous and fresh -- neither the most healthy.  For dinner, beef stew was had by two, and Moroccan style chicken in phylo by another (and the crab again by one). Both dishes were excellently flavored, but for the chicken, definitely be prepared for serious Middle Eastern seasonings.  The beef on both plates seemed like it could have spent some more time cooking as there was some toughness.  Otherwise, again, the quantity was generous, and the ingredients super fresh. As the truffle fries came highly recommended, we tried those, and they do NOT disappoint.  Nobody could get enough, and we had ask the server to remove them from the table as we would have kept going on the seemingly bottomless basket. One shortfall might be seen in the offerings for vegetarians, or for those that enjoy fish, as both seemed somewhat short in supply, but otherwise, this is a great neighborhood bistro, run by ownership that is eager to provide a gracious meal in a welcoming setting.  Then, getting out the door for $122 (for a party of four), got everyone to agree they would gladly go back to try some different things on the menu.",0.998,0.732,0.232,0.036,0.5378095238095238

For starters, we tried the fried cheese and date appetizers.  The strawberry jam on the cheese sounds odd in theory, but the sweetness compliments the saltiness of the cheese.  The dates...how can you go wrong with bacon, very tasty.  For entrees,  I had the 'whole fish', which is exactly what it sounds like.  A roasted whitefish with vegetables in broth.  I also sampled my dining companions entrees, the mussels and chicken in phylo.  I liked the chicken in phylo better than the mussels, but I'm not really a mussels eater in the first place.  The chicken was wrapped up in phylo and served with couscous and a tangy sauce. (side note: all of the staff were very friendly and it was obvious that they take pride in their work.)

Definitely do yourself a favor & get the halloumi cheese dish, it's still a wonder to me how this cheese can be grilled without melting but the firm texture & salty flavor (similar but not as salty or crumbly as feta) knock it out of the park every time.  For entrees I've had the grouper nicoise which was scrumptious and the vegetable and ricotta pie which is vegetarian comfort food at it's finest.  my boyfriend and other dining companions have enjoyed every other dish on the menu so it seems like you can't go wrong!",0.9838,0.816,0.184,0.0,0.5079562594268476
2009-07-28,5.0,"What a fantastic restaurant. We called on a Saturday afternoon to make a reservation for four. They asked for my number and promised to call back after checking the reservation book to see if we could be worked in. We were called back immediately and worked in at 8pm, as requested.  Our waiter was amazing (Joncarl's partner, if I recall correctly). We ordered everything under the sun that has been praised in reviews; bacon wrapped dates, artichoke appetizer, truffle fries and mussels, flank steak with risotto, and the whole red snapper (which they even beheaded for my mother who could not stand the thought of the fish looking at her). After all this, we obviously had to have desert and the bread pudding was amazing!! I think it was key lime bread pudding...drool!! Sooo good. All this and BYOB-this place is great. Such a laid back atmosphere, but still very classy and we never felt rushed. The waiter even complimented our rendition of Taylor Swift's love story (I can't help it-I love it!).",0.9867,0.793,0.192,0.015,0.5406249999999999
2009-07-20,4.0,"This place was an easy four star review.  I'll use my standard format: The Space:  This is basically the only reason HB didn't get 5 stars.  The space is a fairly unassuming storefront in the epicenter of a bustling boys'-town neighborhood.  It's clean, fun, and just swanky enough, but quite honestly it was LOUD.  My wife and I could barely hear each other.  There was a large group in there, but I imagine there would have been people at all those tables if the group weren't there, so that doesn't change it for me.  Definitely not a place I would bring a first date or someone for a ""serious conversation.""   The decor, however, is quite nice, with framed black & white photographs all over that were taken by the Front of House manager, who was on-site when we were there.  His photo work is excellent, and there are non-invasive signs giving you the web address if you want to buy some of his work. The Service:  Our waiter was friendly, knowledgable, helpful with an ice bucket (for the vino), etc., but it almost seemed like he was working in fast-forward.  I don't know if he just wanted to turn our two-top over one more time before closing (our res was for 7:45 on Saturday and we were on time) or what, but we had to make a deliberate effort to slow down, lest we find ourselves home by 9 on a Saturday night.  Again, very friendly, very helpful, I just felt a little rushed.  Once we slowed down, and we did linger over wint at the end of the meal, there was no problem.  I think I'm making a mountain out of a mole hill here, so I'll move on... The Food:  Oh, the food.  This is really good food.  We've eaten at a lot of the ""Contemporary American"" type places in the city (see Chalkboard, Sola, Erwin, Deleece reviews on my page), and this food stands up to any of them.  The Artichoke and Gruyere fritters made a little bit of pee come out when I tasted them.  They're not greasy, full of 'choke flavor, and oozing with cheese.  I'm not sure you could make them any better.  Wife had the soft shell crabs, the nightly special.  There were 2 crabs, lightly fried, and served on a fresh salad of melon, pickled onions, etc.  I don't even like crab much at all, but tried it and they were fantastic.  I had the smoked duck sausage with white beans, candied bacon, and spicy mustard.  Yum.  I was practically licking the plate clean by the time I finished.  For dessert we had the bread pudding made with pineapple, which scared me at first, but proved a sublime mix of smooth, sweet, and tart.  I was afraid it would taste like some pineapple filling that comes out of a can, but they were using all fresh pineapple, and it worked beautifully.   That's what we had last weekend, and I can't wait to go back for a few of the other items on the menu.  Another thing we noticed was that, like Chalkboard, they don't have any salt or pepper on the table.  I like the confidence it exudes when you say ""my food is good enough, my customers don't need to season it themselves.""  And I'll be honest, I never even thought to look for salt or pepper until my wife pointed it out after dinner.  Truly, good stuff.   So if you're looking for a romantic date (with a guy or a girl), don't do this on a weekend.  But if you're looking for top-noch fare and a good time with friends, this could be your new go-to spot.  And, hey, if you like to go on dates on Tuesdays, I'm sure it will be great.  Maybe we'll see you there!",0.9989,0.78,0.19,0.03,0.5154661367776122

On top of everything, it's BYOB, and they tell you that when you call to make reservations so that you know ahead of time to pick something up if you'd like.  There was no corkage fee either if I remember correctly. I left feeling like the cooking was incredibly similar to anything I might have at home, and at first this was kind of disappointing 'til I remembered that it was the whole point.  It definitely is home cooking, and I guess delicious with that said.  The only thing I didn't care much for was the dessert.  I had a bread pudding.  It was WAY too rich and there was nothing particularly good about it.  It also tasted a lot more like American Dulce de Leche desserts than it did bread pudding, and I really like bread pudding.",0.9883,0.754,0.197,0.049,0.5364197530864196

2009-07-10,5.0,"I love love love love this place.  I actually joined yelp just so I could review it.  I haven't ever bothered to review anything, but I loved HB so much last night I felt the absolute need to tell the world about it today.  The first time I went for a big group dinner (monthly girls night) and loved it so much that I came back two days later for brunch with my mom.  I hadn't been back since, even though I think about it all the time.  I called last night and couldn't get in until a later reservation, so thought I was out of luck.  When strolling down Halsted looking for somewhere else to eat, my friend and I decided to stop in and make sure they couldn't take us, just in case.  Lucky us, someone had cancelled!   We ran down to Kafka for some wine (I love that place, too.. it's just a block or two south of HB and they have such a great selection at a great price).  We came back and were seated right away.  We had trouble deciding, and agreed to split everything.  We got the garlic and escargot appetizer, which I was nervous about because I love classic escargot, and anything but the classic preparation usually disappoints me.  Not this one.  It's so amazing.  It's not overwhelmingly garlic-y, but has full roasted cloves in it.  I hate tomatoes, but actually tried one in this dish, and IT was delicious (which is kinda sacrilegious for me to say).  The sauce was so good, I really want to know what all was in it.  Dip the bread in it, it's so yummy!  Speaking of the bread, they have what I think is a balsamic vinegar reduction that comes with it and even that was amazing!   Anyhow, we also ordered two entrees, but since we were splitting everything, HB served each thing individually (after asking us if that's what we wanted, of course, because their service is so awesome).  Next up we had this veggie and ricotta thing that is new to their menu.  I thought nothing would top the appetizer but this quickly moved into the spot as my favorite thing from last night.  I don't know how they made it taste so good!  It had ""Moroccan spices""... I think there was cinnamon maybe, cardamon?  It was so freaking good.   We had to make ourselves stop eating it so we could enjoy the soft shell crabs that were a special that night.  SO FRESH!  Served on a watermelon salad, which Joncarl said was classic, but I thought was pretty unique.  The food was so amazing, Joncarl and the whole staff made us feel so at home.  We had a friend meeting us and so were going to leave for another drink (I don't like to just sit around drinking at a BYOB for too long after dinner, esp have someone come join that didn't eat there), but Joncarl invited us to move to a bigger table and stay for more wine.  Everyone there was so friendly, I can't say enough about them.  It's small and intimate and... awesome.

2009-07-06,5.0,"This is one of the best dining experiences that I've had in a while. It was A plus from start to finish. Went here with Arlene M. last Wednesday for the prix fixe. She had been here before and highly recommended it, and since I missed it during Yelp Eats I was pretty excited. Normally when I get super excited about something, I build it up in my head to a height that said 'something' could never reach. Knowing my tendency to over hype things, I figured that even if it wasn't all it was cracked up to be - I'd drink too much wine and do some good girl chatting.  Luckily, the evening didn't depend on gossip alone. We started with the almond stuffed, bacon wrapped dates. Mouthwatering. I will be giving these a shot at home some time because I'm now addicted. I got the baked haloumi. Very tasty and served with rye crisps with some type of jam. As you can tell, I'm a big fan of the savory / sweet combos. Arlene got the steak and pomme frites with garlic aoli. The steak was cooked perfectly. Nice salty crust on the outside and juicy on the inside. And okay - I know that pomme frites are just french fries - but these ain't coming out of a fry-o-later 3000. This is french fry perfection. And who doesn't love garlic mayo? I went with the quail (which was actually 2) served over chorizo and potatoes with purple basil. Just wonderful. For dessert I had the bread pudding with caramel and chocolate drizzle, while Arlene got the fresh berries with vanilla whipped cream. It's a good thing that Arlene doesn't mind sharing, because I definitely suffered from 'wandering fork syndrome' that evening.  All of that makes for a great experience but what puts this place over the top for me is the service. Everyone here makes you feel so at home. Like you've been going there for years. The chef stopped by our table a few times to relight our candle (which was being stubborn) and to chat. We talked about food, drinks (as he giggled at our two bottles of wine), to his cats. He was very welcoming and his food is amazing. I am in restaurant love. Can't wait to go back!",0.9931,0.772,0.174,0.054,0.48505050505050507

It's a small place with creative but simple decor to set a bright ambiance that perfectly fits the palette pleasing combinations you'll find.  The specials tonight included a fresh spinach/bacon/watermelon/parmesan app which was delicious and fresh as well as tiger prawns in a curried couscous broth.  Even the mashed pea concoction that comes with the fish (beer battered so lightly it ate like tempura, delicious) was delightful.   I'm new to the Lincoln Park neighborhood but an old school foodie and this jumped to the top of my local list.

2009-07-01,4.0,"Finally tried this place after having it bookmarked for months! Made our reservation for a Friday night and headed over pretty early. Because parking is scarce with no valet, we were actually a couple minutes late. We had to wait a few minutes for a table which isn't a big deal, but since the place is so small, if there were more than the two of us standing at the hostess stand, it would've gotten very crowded.  It seemed like we kind of got lost in the bustle of the night. There appeared to be two servers, both who were incredibly nice, but we were often overlooked. I'm sure this is a rarity, but again, I'm reviewing on the experience we had.  I love the atmosphere of the place, tiled mosaics and fun food quotes bordering the ceiling. Though it's small, you don't feel like you're sitting on top of the table next to you and it didn't get too loud. Perfect volume.  We were seated and after 15 minutes of confusion (I think each server thought we were taken care of by the other.), someone came over to give us glasses for our Belgian beer.  We had to ask about the specials since I'd read they have great ones and none were offered to us (though again, our server apologized and said he thought the other server had explained them to us).  The specials sounded good, but we were already leaning toward some regular menu items. We ordered the almond stuffed, bacon-wrapped dates to start. They were good, but for all the gushing, I was expecting something different from the usual bacon wrapped date I've had at many tapas restaurants. They were tasty, though.  We shared the mussels with truffle fries and the pork loin. Another quick note, we never got napkins or silverware either, so had to ask for that after our food was brought out. The mussels were great. Not fishy at all and there were a TON of them. There had to have been 25-30 mussels in my bowl! Alongside those tasy mussels came the most amazingly addictive truffle fries. I made the server take them away because we were stuffed, but half of the giant bowl was still left! I would go back just for those. Despite the appeal of the truffle fries and the mountain of mussels, the pork loin was my favorite dish. It was served with a cheesy baked scalloped potato side and spicy, mustardy collard greens. Everything was topped with baked, spiced apples that were heavenly with the cheesy potatoes and the tender, moist pork.  We were too stuffed for dessert because this is truly a place you won't leave hungry. The food was 5 stars, but the service was a little sketchy for our experience. We were often overlooked and had to wait quite a while to sit, for the menus, to order, then to get our check and pay. Again, I think this was maybe a fluke, and won't stop me from coming back, though it did make me knock off a star.  Still, great, unpretentious food in a fun part of town.

Kafka is also conveniently located across the street so you can pick up a couple bottles of wine before dinner.

I highly recommend the sauteed garlic escargot and almond stuffed dates. For the main course I recommend the coriander rubbed salmon which was served with asparagus and polenta. The guy at Kafka recommended a nice chilled Viognier that paired really well with the salmon.The wild boar and cranberry sausage had a nice little spicy kick.

2009-06-19,3.0,"So this is my first review to write on Yelp so not only am I a little unsure about my writing skills, I'm a little hesitant to overrate on my first review.  But here goes... I went to Home Bistro with my boyfriend and another couple during Yelp's restaurant week.  I really wasn't expecting too much from the food, mainly due to lack of knowledge about the place, but was super excited about the BYOB.  So I went with little appetite but definitely ready to booze.  Quickly after the waiter brought yhe bread served with truffle butter, I forgot all about my wine.  The bread wasn't amazing or anything, but I'm a sucker for truffle oil.  Because it was restaurant week, there was a prix fixe menu, which I was happy to see had great options!  Despite my lack of appetite, I was still down for three courses.  The waiter did a great job of providing his favorites both on the special menu and off and was very attentive, but not overly attentive, throughout the whole meal.  The restaurant was packed so it was nice to see that the service didn't suffer.   I started off with the Caesar salad - nothing special, but a good way to start off a three course meal.  My boyfriend and the other dude each got the artichoke edam fritter, which was very good but definitely should have been a splitter as it was just big fried balls.  The other girl got the bacon-wrapped dates.  She was literally swatting her boyfriend's fork away with hers to keep him from snagging bites so it must have been good.  Although I was not lucky enough to get a bite of an actual date, I did get to try to the brown sugar balls that came with the dish.  I'm pretty sure it was cooked in bacon fat because it was the best brown sugar I've ever had!   Moving on to the second course, I debated between the mussels and the mixed seafood special.  Because the mussels came with fries and I knew I was going to house a dessert, I went with the lighter option and chose the mixed seafood.  I was not disappointed.  The broth had a ton of flavor and the mix of clams, mussels, shrimp, garlic, and onion, made the dish hearty enough for a full meal.  My boyfriend and the other dude went with the pork dish.  Now don't get me wrong, this dish was awesome, but it was not in any way, shape, or form good for you.  My boyfriend looked over at his buddy's dish and noticed that he had twice as many scalloped potatoes as his dish, but he quickly realized that it was a good thing based of how rich the dish was.  For me, only a few bites of dishes like that are any good.  Both boys were very happy with their meals.  Our other friend got the salmon with lentils.  I'm a big fan of salmon, but this dish was pretty ehh for me.  Although she didn't say it, I think she was disappointed in her order when compared to the others.  She ate most of it though and didn't complain.   Lastly, we each got a dessert with the prix fixe meal.  To get something a little lighter to balance the hefty pork dish, my boyfriend ordered the special lemon custard.  It was really good!  The girlfriend and I ordered the bread pudding at the suggestion of the waiter and we were both very pleased.  Despite our full stomachs, we were both able to finish them off with some unwanted help from the boys.  The other dude got the chocolate bundt cake, which was nothing special and, being that I'm not a huge chocolate fan, too rich/dry for me.   When I finally looked up from my feeding frenzy, I was pleased to find that I still had a whole glass of wine left and I sat back to enjoy while the boys paid.  Overall, Home Bistro was very good and I would recommend it to others (and actually already have) - the food was very good, service great, and you can't beat BYOB!  The bathroom was really cool too.  The only negative to the night were the people lingering in the very tight doorway waiting to be seated.  As is a typical problem for most smaller restaurants, sometimes small and quaint is closely related to tight and cramped.  I don't hold it against them though.",0.9986,0.749,0.177,0.074,0.5574236217784605

I had the edam fritters, which were great, but the portion size was a little crazy - I'm a huge fan of fried food, but four giant fritters was just more than I could handle.  I'm not one to complain about value for money, especially in a nicer restaurant, but a pile of fritters and a bucket of dates can be a bit overwhelming; if you're not on a three course menu, two people to one app is probably the way to go.  My salmon was fine, but outshined by the vegetables and lentils, and the bread pudding was good, but nothing I'd rave about.  The strange portion-sizing appeared again as my friend's order of warm chocolate cake arrived so large and so rich that even the three of us working together couldn't make more than a dent in the side.   All in all, I had a pleasant (if salty!) experience, but I just didn't see the magic all the other reviewers are caught up in . . . The pork with apples, however, recieved rave reviews from my friends who seemed eager to go back, so perhaps some entrees are just better bets than others . . .",0.9966,0.752,0.225,0.023,0.6623168498168498

In contrast, my entree, a lamb burger, looked like it had been cooked in a rocket engine--it was charred to the point of unpleasantness on the outside, but almost raw and kinda falling apart on the inside.

The food is amazing.  Simply prepared, but nothing short of gourmet - I have never had anything that wasn't delicious.  This is a restaurant where you can tell immediately the quality of the ingredients: the fish is always fresh, the mussels never have that ""too much sea water"" taste, and their lamb burger is to die for.  Also, they always have at least one vegetarian entree on the menu, which is an added plus.  I have known several non-vegetarians who ordered the vegetarian options here just because they sounded so delicious (and they delivered on that!)!  And BYOB is always a plus.

2009-05-09,4.0,"I was taken here by the lovely Jo W for a belated birthday dinner. See, I like to celebrate my birthday for at least a month. Its the only way kids, the only way. Spread out the love.  I came here and met my friend Jo for our 7:30pm reservation. The place is cute, romantic and small. Small candles dot each table, as the night wore on, you can tell this isn't a bad place for a group of girls, group of friends or that someone special. But sadly there is one thing that was a killer for this place and that was the noise level. It was loud, not as bad as I have been to in other places, but kinda annoying, I won't lie. However there are quite a few things that make up for all of this hub bub .. bub.  The service was really quite good. Even though our server was stretched a little bit, (plus she looked like a friend of mine who is out of town, kinda freaked me out a little), she was spot on when she was with us. Made me feel like we were the only ones there. Wish I remembered her name so I could recommend her. Its BYOB. Gotta love that. I was lucky to be treated by Jo to a bottle of Vueve Rose, her first rose champagne, I'm such the lucky guy. The food was any where from good to really great. Let's break our meal down.  We started off with the artichoke fritters and the dates. Dates were good, I mean they are wrapped in bacon, how could they not be good? Stuffed with almonds and topped with brown sugar. Now since they are already a little sweet, I thought the brown sugar was a little overkill. Or perhaps I just like mine a little savory. The fritters were great, a little soft and chewy on the inside, a crispy on the outside and not at all greasy or oily. Also, it came with a garlic aioli which certainly had a bite of garlic to it, though I had no problem with that. Then for the main, Jo went with the steak with truffle fries, whilest I went with the pork loin. With all this talk of swine flu this and that, I've been on quite a porky craving. This stuff fit the bill, however I do have some minor qualms. First off the pork is good, although a little over cooked. The potatoes were good, however I felt like the pork was swimming in the left over juices of the apple and cabbage that accompanied the rest of the dish. It was flavorful pool, but I tend to like to see what I am eating, although search for what ever at the bottom was a little bit of fun and at the same time, no diving equipment needed. I really don't eat beef, but her fries were open for the taking and take I did, delicious. Not too heavy of truffle flavor, but just enough to enjoy. Then came dessert. I will say this, thank the freakin' universe no song was sung. Just not a fan of being sung Happy Birthday too. However I will take a candle in the chocolate chip bundt cake, actually screw the candle, I will just take this chocolaty, moist and slightly ooey gooey tasty treat to finish off my slightly bursting stomach. Jo had the bread pudding, which I think she liked, although I think I did spy a look of wanting my cake.... oh whoops... sorry I just polished it off.   All in all it was a really good night to once again celebrate me.

2009-05-03,4.0,"HB apparently stands for Home Bistro.  I can't say I agree - I think it stands for Holy Bacon-wrapped-dates! It was my first bacon wrapped date experience ever.  EVER.  Where have I been??  Seriously, the bacon wrapped dates were delish. I'm going to start with the ""points that lost this place a star"" to get them out of the way, then move on to the good stuff.  - the entrance is one giant clusterfuck, or at least it was when I arrived on Friday.  When I checked in (15 minutes early) the guy up front mumbled something about my table not being ready, gave me no indication of when it would be, then didn't really acknowledge my presence again until it WAS ready - almost half an hour later.  There is no room to stand around and wait, so I'd shuffle to the right when another party came in the door, shuffle to the left when the server needed to get to tables in the window, and no matter where I went I felt like I was in the way.  When my dinner date, Rob L, arrived, he couldn't even get to me because there was a group of girls standing in the doorway because again...  nowhere else to go.  They also seemed short staffed, with two servers and another guy (maybe the owner?) handling all the tables, the host stand, the phone, and anything else.  I think one more person would have made it seem less chaotic.  - one bathroom - unisex - for the whole place.  At least the man before me was nice and put the toilet seat down.  But yikes. *ahem* Now on to the good stuff that made up for the lousy first impression I was getting. Cute decor, and I love that they used old wine bottles as candle holders. We had a table in the very back corner, and it was cozy but loud.  I sort of couldn't hear Rob L or our server at times.  Our server was fantastic, so no complaints there.  She promptly filled our glasses with the champagne we brought, then chilled it for us. We started things off with bacon wrapped dates and the artichoke and edam fritters.  I've already professed my love of the dates, but the artichoke fritters were damn good too.  I didn't realize until later that I didn't try the sauce it came with, but on their own they're pretty good so I don't feel like I missed out on anything. Entrees - Rob went with the pork (apparently the swine flu paranoia only made him crave pork, pork, and more pork), I went with the steak and famous truffle fries.  The steak was good - not the best I've had, but still delicious, and the truffle fries...  well, those things are like crack.  Rob and I kept munching on them long after we were ""done"" eating.  And I was sort of craving them the next day.  So yeah, good stuff. Oh, dessert...  I went with the apple and butterscotch bread pudding, and Rob had the chocolate chip chocolate bundt cake.  They brought his out with a candle (we were celebrating his birthday a little late), and they didn't sing - thank god.  My bread pudding was freaking good, but I have to say I should have ordered what Rob had because all that chocolate was just delicious in a way that should be illegal. Overall, a very solid meal.  I'd come back and try some of the other things on the menu, but trust me when I say those bacon wrapped dates will be a repeat....  mmm....",0.9461,0.751,0.135,0.115,0.48872879036672157

But lucky for you and me, my hubby (the moustached Reuben H) has already done it. Since I started a mussel list - I want to talk a little bit about them. These little babies need some love. I am more than willing to give it to them. They are presented on the menu as ""Amsterdam Style"" and it is quite different from what you can find elsewhere in the city. Here no tomato, white wine or onion but pungent anise, beer and dried basil. That makes for a total different experience but it is still succulent and brings back memories of North Sea Belgian ports. Not 'exotic' maybe but still worth it in my book. Another piece of information: there is much less sauce to soak up with bread than in places visited before.....hence less messy to eat.

2009-04-19,5.0,"Pardon this review for any mistakes that are about to happen- grammatically or spelling or even nonsensical.  For I am admittedly drunk as I type this out. Earlier today I got word that I would be a part of a dinner involving non-English speaking people and the wine that they produce.  That's write- foreign wine producers.  In this case French, for which anyone that knows me should not be a surprise, considering I am lucky enough to be married to a pretty well connect French woman. In the case of this evening, it was all originally due to the lovely Mireille D. a Yelper who isn't able to be super-active, but a wonderful lady nonetheless.  She was contacted recently through her work to help out a duo of young French wine producers to be a part of a series of wine tastings and sales pitches to distributors based here in the US and abroad.  Her job, was to help with translation and interpretation.   Luckily, the job turned out to be cool enough to be an enjoyable weekend, and due to the trio being busy, my wife was contacted to find a good BYOB place to go to on a Sunday night with not too much time to prepare.  HB came to mind to her immediately. So, my wife called today before noon and left a message letting them know that she was interested in securing a table for five around 7:30 in the evening.  Within an hour or so, she got a call, directly from the chef de cuisine, Jan Carl (spelling?) in regards to her request. Remarkably, he remembered us coming in about three months ago for our first meal there.  He even went out of his way with some cordial remarks in French (which from what I can tell is quite good!), and invited us to join them that evening.   My wife explained that we had some guests that are wine producers, and Jan Carl was very excited about what would be in-store for us. Upon arriving, our guests brought out a total of six bottles of their wine for the five of us.  The waiter wasn't quite sure how to react to us for this, but realized quite quickly that we were the drunk-ass Frenchies that brought along the producers of supposedly great wine (and selling for up to $450/bottle- it better had been good wine!).  He was attentive and friendly, and made sure that we were well taken care of. Since our new buddies had been tasting and eating all day long, they made it clear that they weren't ready for the typical American dinner, which by French standards is quite large.  We therefore opted for a series of starters which were all fantastic. For anyone who doesn't understand the HB concept- it is similar to the many ""New American"" restaurants out there, but HB is decidedly Dutch.  For example- the escargot that we had was definitely not the French style.  Our new friends had a hard time finding the escargot considering they are already out of their shells and are in a delicious mix of tomato, orange, bread and herbs.  Very nice!  There are also a lot of other Dutch elements to the cooking that make the HB experience quite unique. We also enjoyed the Gouda plate, which had three different cheeses.  The five-year aged cows milk one from a Dutch woman in Wisconsin was fantastic.  The shrimp and herring specials were very good too.  Herring piled on a rye cracker with slivered onion and creme fraiche was nice in my opinion, and tiger prawns with candied orange rind and a nice sauce was very good too. We skipped main course (I guess in favor of even more wine- and yes, be jealous, very good wine at that!) and were given no problems by our wonderful server.  Dessert orders were taken much later in the night and were very nice- a bread pudding- something decidedly American and new to our French guests, and a pane cotta (spelling?) that was rich, creamy and delicious. Like the terrific hosts that they were, HB's staff allowed us to linger for a long time after eating, finish our wine and conversation- and even joined us eventually.  Wonderful hospitality!",0.9994,0.764,0.206,0.031,0.5437245756888613

2009-03-30,3.0,"Good for groups: NO!  I'm a bit confused why when we called for a reservation of 6 they told us they can't sit any groups larger than 4 together.  Then half the girls here overrated it because they were allowed in as a huge group for GNO.  Was the person on the phone mistaken, do they just play favors?  They even went into details saying their kitchen isn't large enough to bring out food for 6 people at once.  Uhh, OK.   (And it's not like they said they could only do a group as a walk-in vs reservation.  And we were flexible, we could have moved the time earlier, possibly another date, gone in knowing we needed a little more patience, ordered family style, etc).  In the end we only ended up with a group of 4, but partly because we didn't go out of our way to invite more people knowing this would have been an issue. When we showed up to see they had a pushed three 2-tops together for a group of 6, I was less than excited. Disappointed would be a better word. And I'd probably not recommend HB again because of it (as I've done countless times prior).  There's nothing more annoying than a place that pretends to have some policy then doesn't follow it. Then on a subsequent trip, I went with a group of 10 and somehow we were OK to sit down together.  WTF HB, not cool. Anyway... onto the food ...It seems that their menu has gotten a tad more expensive since when they opened (apps in the $11-13 range, most entrees in the $18-25 range).  I'd still call their menu some sort of French country Canadian thing, perhaps Dutch, it's a very nice menu that's a bit different from the norm. For appetizers we had a herring special they had and escargot.  The escargot was very earthy... definitely not your French grandma's garlic butter escargot.  I'm a big fan of their Haloumi as well. I debated between the quail entree and the flank steak, and the waiter talked me into the steak.  The pre-cut-up flank steak is served with a blue cheese risotto.  The steak was good but the risotto was undercooked.   I still ate it though.   And I could be crazy but I think there was supposed to be side of some onion or tomato but there wasn't. For desserts we shared the chocolate cake and some custardy thing.  The waiter poopooed on the chocolate cake and suggested everything but it, though it turned out to be our favorite thing.   4 entrees, 2 appetizers, and 2 desserts came out to be $140+tip.  Yup, their menu has definitely gone up in price a bit... but still not bad by any means. Service was good.  I'm not sure I'd rely on the waiter recommendations as much as we did. Reservations are pretty much required here, and several times now I've tryed calling day of and they were completely booked, so I would even say ""advance"" reservations are required.",0.9912,0.816,0.13,0.054,0.5303418803418805

The service has always been excellent as well - very friendly, attentive, and happy to make suggestions.  On one occasion my wife mentioned how much she enjoyed one of the specials she had previously eaten here.  Though they didn't have it that night, the server said it had been a special the night before and checked with the chef who said he could get it for her.  On another night, craving something sweet, my wife stepped in to request some pecan bread pudding to go.  Since the normal servers were busy, the chef came out to greet her, said he was flattered that she liked it so much, and even though they didn't have the pecan style this evening he would add some pecans to the version they were serving for her.  It was delicious.   And finally, the BYOB aspect is really nice and a lot of fun.  Having Kafka right across the street is a perfect combination.",0.9957,0.777,0.223,0.0,0.669047619047619

And I didn't even think I liked dates, but apparently I do once you wrap them in bacon and bake them in brown sugar.   Entrees: Salmon for me: I ate every last bite Chicken for my friend: loved the mushroom risotto that came with it Mussels for my friend's man: Largest portion of mussels and fries I've ever seen and I think he enjoyed it because he ate it all. We were hoping for a free meal since he's probably the only person able to finish those mussels, but not so much.

YUM! Dessert: 2 orders of bread pudding, because we couldn't get 1 after reading the rave reviews for it on Yelp.  And OMG, we should have ordered 4 orders of it.

I was a little concerned about the bones, but the waiter filleted it for me in the kitchen and I only found one bone in this entire fish. It had this awesome morocan curry sauce on it that was out of this world. All of my friends agreed it was the best thing ordered. The grouper was just OK and a little small, but the chicken and salmon were also delish.  On to dessert! After this amazing meal, there was no way we were skimping on dessert.

2009-02-02,5.0,"Can I just say ""bookmark now""? Would that be a sufficient review? Probably not, I'm just nervous... I know at times I get a little carried away with loquacious narratives on each minute detail of a fabulous dining experience - I can't help it, I'm just so excitable - that I fear you'll grow tired of my rambling and never get the full picture. I see you over there rolling your eyes and clicking away from me in favor of capricious reviews on 'dibs' and 'love'. The surplus of studies on plastic chairs aren't going anywhere, promise. Just stick with me, will ya? And if the maddening ants in your pants won't give on their hold, then like I said, bookmark now - you won't be sorry!!  HB Restaurant embodies flawless execution in every sense of the notion...  From the get-go, planning the January Yelp GNO (Girls Night Out. Duh) dinner was pure simplicity... from selecting the menu, to organizing seating, to working with the staff, things couldn't have been easier on me, truly. I dig the easy button!! Fortunately, once we arrived, the evening's experience wholly followed suit. HB's exec chef, Joncarl Lachman, whom I worked with directly made our evening total enchantment. Really. I know I'm getting all Walt Disney on you, but ask my posse, our event was magical. Perhaps it was the fantastic food or maybe the flattering surroundings? You know what I mean about flattery. Anyone who has ever suffered from a case of bad lighting on a date hears me and should head to HB for refuge!! With buttery yellow walls, oodles of candlelight, cinnamon scented air, sexy vintage mirrors and heaps of charm, I felt very at home bathed in a glow of the HB brand of fabulousness. The new 'chubby' J.Simp should head here for some ego boosting stat.  Speaking of chubby, let's talk chow... after all, it was the best part! Take advantage of their BYOB factor (yes!!) and bring some of your best bubbles or vino to pair with the extraordinary, eclectic menu. If you're not hitting up HB en masse as we did, give them a whirl on Wednesdays when they highlight their prix-fixe magnificence - 3 courses, $29, such a steal! The favs on my hit list were the apps of haloumi cheese with rose petal jam - so melty, salty, sweet - divine! And of course, the bacon wrapped dates that came in a silky coat of brown sugah love, plenty to share with friends! My entrée (also the house specialty), the choucroute was a shellfish lovers dream... piled high with shrimp, mussels, clams and smoked sausage on a bed of mashed potatoes I cried a little bit while eating it. Food porn is so choice.  Taking little bites here and there off everyone's plate I can attest that each dish (mushroom risotto, pork loin, Moroccan chicken, etc. etc.) is adorned with only the freshest ingredients, and not a dud in the bunch. Dessert is no joke, either. HB takes their sweets seriously and took me right to the moon with their blood orange creamsickle mousse ala 'dream foam' and gooey pineapple bread pudding. OMFG! I'd bathe in the pudding if there wasn't a hygiene issue there... clearly I enjoyed myself.  Big thanks to the HB crew, you can see we have no shortage of great things to say about you... and whaddya know, I already have plans to go back... foam party part deux!",0.9982,0.75,0.192,0.058,0.6118152782177173
2009-02-01,5.0,"ANY place that could take the day I was having last week and turn me from a grump to one happy camper gets 5 stars in my book!  HB Restaurant was the location for January's Yelp GNO and what a location it was. From the moment I walked in, a little harried, late and in definite need of a cocktail- this place (and our waiter) charmed me.  I loved the walls painted with whimsical sayings and covered with oversized mirrors. I loved the charm of the large table areas that they put together for us. I loved that it was BYOB and I had brought one of my favorites to the party.  And the lighting? I think I need it for my house as we all looked fabulous (but that's not hard to do when it's GNO and we ladies are lovely!)  As I scrambled in my seat, our server took my bottle of champagne , opened it in the back and made sure we had enough flutes to go around. I was just starting to relax when the first course arrived. Of the three I sampled- two will bring me back: the bacon wrapped sugar encrusted almonds and the artichoke and Edam fritters. As I write this- I am already craving a return visit to HB to get me some more of these treats.  After a little salad intermission- our entrees began to arrive. I had chosen the mushroom risotto which was delicious and creamy and quite a large portion.  And then the parade of desserts came out. Now while I could only eat one of them given an aversion to citrus, the mini bundt cake with the whipped cream was enough for me (although the orange creamscicle mousse almost made made tempt fate!)  Our server made my night by telling me I was ""channeling such positive energy"" (he should have seen me just an hour prior!) my table mates were delightful (a special shout out to Colleen and Amanda who squeezed me in at the end of the table) and the chef coming out to say hi was the icing on the cake.  You can bet I will be back. And while I can't imagine it could get any better- I just wonder how great it will be when HB doesn't have to do the heavy lifting of turning a bad work day into a wonderful evening!

2009-01-29,5.0,"Wow, I think I found a new favorite restaurant. The restaurant is darkly lit and super romantic. Walking in here, the place has a warm and homey feel. The staff was super nice when I got in and offered to put my bottles of wine in the fridge until they were needed. The staff was also super accomodating in waiting for all of the Yelpettes to arrive for GNO.  For an appetizer, I had the broiled haloumi cheese. Wow, that cheese is good. My pieces were perfectly broiled and extremely tasty. Megan G. commented to me that it tasted a lot like saganaki. I was a little confused by the piece of rye bread and how to use it for the appetizer, but it was still good. I sampled the crab cake and all I can say is wow. The crab cake was delicious. In between the appetizer and entree, I enjoyed the salad. It was a perfect salad of dark greens and a light vinagarette. Also, I had a piece of their bread. I want that bread and lots of it. It was fluffy, moist, and flavorful. It was only made better by the balsamic vinegar on the bottom. That bread made my carb cravings even worse because it was so good. For my entree, I had the broiled salmon. My piece of salmon was a little overbroiled, but still satisfying. The polenta and vegetables underneath the salmon were amazing. I tried some of the wild mushroom risotto. That was the richest, most decadent risotto I've ever tasted. Sarah L's moroccan couscous stew smelled amazing and further reinforced the homey nature of this restaurant. I tried one of the truffle fries from another Yelpette. I could eat those fries day in and day out and be the happiest person ever.   The incredible staff brought us the whole selection of desserts for everyone to try. They really know how to please us! The pineapple bread pudding was dream worthy. It was light and sugary. My favorite dessert was the blood orange creamsicle mousse. I'm still dreaming about it days later. Run of the mill creamsicles won't do after that. The chocolate chip bundt cake was good. It was rich, but just not my favorite dessert.  Overall, HB is a great restaurant. The service was impeccible and being BYOB was also nice. I'll come back for the food, service, and ambience for sure.",0.9989,0.73,0.258,0.012,0.6828686868686867

I love the no attitude BYOB service and the overall charm of the place.  Music is always just the right level, however, unfortunately for the other diners, our group of twenty screechers caused quite the din last night.

The almond stuffed dates were so good. I could have eating 10 of them, but didn't! 2. The crabcakes were equally as delicious. The portion size was quite large - it could have been a meal. 3. The simple green salad was a fantastic palette cleanser. 4. The shellfish entree didn't knock my socks off, but was pretty good.  5. DESSERT.

I was lucky enough to have the crab cake to myself. It was served with a cole slaw garnish and it was a decent sized crab cake. Very tasty! The fritters and cheese were pretty awesome too.  For my main meal I had the Slow Cooked Moroccan Style Chicken Couscous. When my meal came out, it was piping hot and full of comforting aromas. Kind of reminded me of chicken noodle soup. Full of pieces of chicken, carrots, and of course couscous! I loved my meal and it was very fulfilling on a cold snowy night. I also tried the Wild Mushroom Risotto. This was very good but rich. It would work well as a side dish. I also grabbed a couple of truffle fries and those were phenomenal!  Then on to dessert! I was extremely full but I managed to get in a few bites of the sweet stuff. There was: Chocolate cake with whipped cream, Pineapple Bread Pudding and Blood Orange Creamsickle Mousse. It was hard to pick a favorite they were all awesome. I loved the bread pudding the most. The grilled pineapple garnish wasn't bad either! The Creamsickle mousse was so light and airy. Never had anything like it before, I want to try that again! The chocolate cake was really good too.  I loved my first GNO experience and couldn't ask for a better restaurant.

Oh my stars & stripes what a wonderful time was had by all the lovely ladies of Yelp last night at HB.  I could not have imagined a staff more accommodating that the ones at HB--seriously folks they were amazing. Although, I have to blame one of the servers for making me get up & go to the restroom a billion times last night--he kept filling up my water glass--thus making Mandi say I had a childs bladder :-)  Let's talk ambiance--if you are looking for a romantic place to take that special someone, look no further. The warm hues, candles, dim lighting, and cozy seating make for some uber romantic tones (hello date night!). The space is also very intimate, so you will not be drowned out in your lovey dovey chit chat by large crowds (unless of course there is a GNO going on).  THE FOOD--my word it is extremely (trust me I rarely use that word) tasty.  The highlights for me--the bacon wrapped dates--like eating delicious candy.  I have to say the brown sugar they put on top is not necessary.  Also, the pinapple bread pudding---oh lordy--DELICIOUS!

A word about the Staff & Chef, they could not have been more accommodating, friendly, useful and all around wonderful if they tried.

Even offered up tips on finding parking as Halsted can be a challenge.  We arrived 1/2 hr. early for our 9:45 reservation.  Seated by 9:35.  Place was crowded, lots of energy, noisy, and every table had at least one bottle of wine on it. We were waited on by John-Carl (co-owner and chef) who likes to do this from time to time to mingle with the people eating his creations.  Nice touch to hear in detail how he travels the world in search of great food, spices and preparation ideas.  Most of the food we had was really, really good. Bread is very good, fresh, and served with a garlic butter.  We decided on three apps and split one entree (the whole fish that we saw being delivered to another table.... food envy).  The Uitsmijter (truffled fried egg on top of maple fried bacon and a bread that tasted like challah).  Oh lord!  The artichoke and Edam fritters... sinfully good, if you like the deep fried taste.  Mussels were just average, small in size and the broth was watery. John-Carl filleted the whole fish (Whitefish) at the table, making it very easy to split and enjoy.  Chunks of calamari and tomato on the top.  He offered Kosher salt and lemon, which the dish needed. Only two desserts available; delivery problems due to subzero weather.  The pineapple upside down cake with  whipped cream and caramel drizzle was a perfect ending to this evening.  Can't wait to return to try other creations here.

2009-01-04,3.0,"We were in search of a BYOB restaurant for a night of great food, great drinks and great conversation. However, finding a BYOB restaurant that is not Thai or asian-inspired in the Lakeview area is difficult. HB could fit us in at 9pm. I did not make the reservation but my friend, Julia, said the man was very helpful and charismatic on the phone.  We arrived right on time. The space is rather small and does not lend an area for you to wait for your table -- especially in the midst of Chicago winter! The room the restaurant is in (it is very small) is decorated very nicely. I can't put my finger on one word to describe it but I liked it.  We were seated near the back to the restaurant. It was very, very dark but the staff realized this and provided us with two pretty large candles to help with reading our menus. They also offered to keep our wine off the tables and chilled (if it needed chilling). Now to the menu. I am a simple girl and I like simple things -- especially when it comes to my food. The food here is a bit fussy. I did not see any dish that I wanted as it came off the menu. However, the waiter had no problem with my special request for mashed potatoes with my flank steak. The flank steak was great. I do wish they would have served it with a larger steak knife. The one they provided was rather wimpy. My fellow diners all were really excited for the lamb burger but they came back to let us know that they had ran out for the evening. They also had run out of another one of their appetizers. I know we were there late but it was a Friday night -- they need to be prepared! The other thing -- there is truffle oil on A LOT of the options. I have a strict no truffle oil rule but could SMELL it in the air. It did make me slightly queasy but the staff kept my water glass filled which helped to subside the side effects. To the defense of truffle oil -- I heard the truffle fries were quite tasty but were just like the skinny fries you got in the high school cafeteria.  Overall, I like this place. It felt cozy and I enjoyed my time here. However, it was not the meal of my life.",0.9955,0.818,0.152,0.029,0.5934761904761905

This restaurant has compelled me to give back to the Yelp community instead of continuing my parasitic ways.... I can't say enough good things about HB.  Let's start with the atmosphere.  Small dining area with MAYBE 20 tables and all the art on the walls are photographs taken by one of the employees.  And the people working in the restaurant are fantastic.  From the moment I walked in the door they treated me almost as if I was an old friend coming to dinner at their house.  Everything was so absolutely friendly and completely unrushed.... there was no formality at all.  Just really comfortable conversations and interactions with all of the staff that we interacted with. Other details; we didn't have a reservation and it was a Prix Fixe Wednesday (had no idea of that before we came in).  But there was a just vacated table in the window that we got when we walked in.  It was the only table that came available over the next 30-40 minutes, so reservations might be a good idea.   Now, on to the food.... I had an escargot appetizer that was an excellent combination with garlic, tomatoes, mandarin oranges and who knows what else. I certainly didn't leave any of the ingredients on the plate.  My main course was a salmon dish that was somewhat boring in the first bite when all I got was the fish. But as I got further into the dish and got mouthfuls that included polenta and all the other things included in the dish this went from a non-descript piece of salmon to a very complete and satisfying main course which was full of flavor.  For desert they were out of my first choice (an apple crumble) but they did have bread pudding on the menu. I'm a fan of bread pudding but really dislike deserts that have strong alcoholic flavors.  I asked our server what she thought about the level of brandy in the bread pudding and she said she didn't think it was too strong, but would bring me something else if I decided I didn't like it.  I went with it and ended up EXTREMELY happy.  It was the perfect end to a great meal.  Oh, and one other thing I have to mention... if you get something that comes with the truffle oil french fries they will forever change the way you think of french fries.  These were incredible. So in summary, great food, incredibly friendly atmosphere, great value with the Prix Fixe menu...

The space was cute and everyone was VERY nice.  This is the kind of place where the chef comes out and talks to you if he's not busy.  Of course, I got what he recommended, the Chef's special, which was an African bouillabaisse, if you will.  It was really good.  My friend got the Pork Pie.  I know it sounds not so good but it was REALLY good.  They need to come up w/ a better name. The nice thing about the Prix Fixe night is that you can switch around, ie order an appetizer, a salad and a main course (skip desert) or get either an appetizer/salad, a main and then get desert.  It's nice to have that flexibility. The cesear salad had a little too much dressing for my taste, but it was good dressing.  We also ordered the artichoke fritters (yum) and the gouda tasting (also yum).  The gouda tasting comes out with fried bread.  Yes, you read that right--FRIED bread.  This restaurant is not kind to your waistline.

A couple of risque poodles dipped in to rawkus applause. We also saw at least a dozetn cross dressing sarah palin costumes parade by the window. The place itself is very cute and cozy, with many small mirrors decorating the walls and low lighting. It has that dillapadated old home feel to it that I love so well. As for the food, the entrees were superb and the appetizers were average. We had the gouda cheese platter (which was served with matzoh, to our jewish hearts delight), and the salmon fritatta (boring- i'd skip it). As for the main courses, I we split the lamb burger with melted gouda (with a side of truffle-fries) and the moroccan chicken, which was one of the specials. Both were tasty and delicious, although both were very rich (almost ruining my after dinner plans for ice-skating). Another plus is the BYOB status (no corkage)- we saved a ton on booze, and the food's reasonably priced to boot. Our tab for two was about 60 bucks.  So HB was great, and if not for the blah appetizers, it'd be five stars for sure.

Baked haloumi cheese had wonderful strawberry jam, though the overall dish is a little too salty (and I absolutely never find things too salty). The arugula/beet/stilton salad contains delicious, fresh arugula although the stilton was not real stilton. What are really wonderful are the moules et frites. I'd say HB's version is right up there with Hopleaf's. The broth is slightly less savory, and I really enjoy the touch of anise. The mussels themselves are fresh and very tender. The fries are up there with the good pommes frites I remember enjoying in France and the Netherlands (never been to Belgium). Moules et frites places in the USA usually give you the shoestring fries, though I've never seen these in Europe. The fries are drizzled with truffle oil and served with roasted garlic aioli. The portion they give you is huge and you will really have to cut yourself off to avoid consuming a delicious shitload of potato goodness.

My boyfriend took me for dinner after I got my job offer; we took a lovely bottle of sparkling wine and went all out with our meal. It's been long enough now that I can't remember exactly what we had, but I can say we had the bacon-wrapped dates (orgasmic) and an appetizer special that was also moan-inducing. Boyfriend got some kind of tiny bird for his entree, and I had the tilapia. It was lovely, even though I don't normally like fish. It was served on a bed of flageolet beans but included raisins in the preparation. I can't turn down an odd combination like fish and dried fruit. I was so stuffed by the time dessert rolled around that I could barely eat two bites, but the pie hole must be satisfied: We ordered something chocolatey that was irrefutably delicious but nearly made me vomit from the sheer volume of food I'd consumed. The food wasn't memorable four months later, but I'll never forget walking out of the bathroom (which was beautifully appointed for a water closet, art for sale and all that) and overhearing the staff talking about their former lives in New York. I stood IN THE KITCHEN talking with them about our old stomping grounds for almost 10 minutes. By the time I returned to the table, my boyfriend thought I'd fallen in, but I was glowing, knowing I'd made a couple of fast friends in the restaurant business. Sweet staff all the way around; I think our server would have told us everything he loved about each dish on the menu if he hadn't had any other tables.

Also, the coffee is really dark.  I know it's a personal preference thing, but beware.  You'll have to use a LOT of cream. The beignets were delicious and were the highlight of the meal, even though they were admittedly from a mix you can buy at your nearest Jewel. Service was rather inattentive.  Nobody came to ask us how our meal was.  If they had, we would have told them that it was unsatisfactory.  Our waitress said nothing when she noticed that two of the three griddlecakes were still on my girlfriend's plate and she didn't want to take them home.

In any case, my friend and I had fun playing with the crayons and table-top bistro paper they provide for the little children in all of us.  When the food finally did arrive, we were very impressed.  My friend got the portabella mushroom egg thing, which was tasty, and I ordered the deep-fried peaches and cream French toast.  Let me just say that I have never, NEVER had better French toast at a brunch or diner before in my life.  It was like a combination of French toast and funnel cake, covered in this delicious sweet cream sauce.  I would go back to this place over and over again just for this dish, but I want to get back to try other things too.  I also need to remember to bring my own alcohol next time as it is BYOB, and they have yummy fresh-squeezed orange juice to mix with a cheap bottle of sparkling white wine (ok, ""champagne,"" but if it's less than $5 at the local liquor store, it's probably not real champagne folks). And just a little bit more: the space itself is small and cozy without much ornament, which turns the whole feeling into something a bit industrial.  There are a few cool paintings on the wall, but mainly it's just an orange painted wall with some writing at the top edge where it meets the ceiling about how great eating food is and all that.  In some ways I didn't like the space that much, but then I realized it makes you focus on the food more than anything, and in a sense that's what this place is all about.",0.9926,0.827,0.136,0.037,0.40864898989898985

I had wanted to try HB for quite some time, and called for reservations. There's a voicemail that tells you to leave a message with your name, phone number, and the time/day you'd like to come in. I figured, I'm calling at 6 on a Friday, we'd better come up with a back up plan. Well 15 minutes later, the FOH manager gave me a call, and got us set up. He said if we wanted to come a little early, they'd open wine for us at the host stand while we waited. (P.S. Stop off at Kafka across the street before to pick up your wine. It's cheap, and the boy working was cute and we danced to Thriller for a while.) I'd probably give it 4 1/2 stars, just because our reservations were at 9:15, and we didn't get seated until after 10, but I'll round up, because of the number of orgasms I began to have once I started eating. Start with the dates. You won't regret it. Dates and almonds wrapped in proscuitto.... oh god. You know when you have to close your eyes because you want to lose yourself in the moment?  Then have the tilapia. My best friend said not to ever order tilapia, because it's a cheap ingredient, so always gets marked up 1000%. Screw that. If I could have babies and settle down in the suburbs with that tilapia, we'd be on our way to Naperville right now. (My friends had the pork and the swordfish, both of which they swore were better. I admit, they were heavenly--but you know you're the only one for me, tilapia.) We were jazzed about the cupcake flight for dessert, but our server (who had the most beautiful biceps, if that's any incentive) said that day's batch came out flat, so we had some sort of cake-y-moussey thing that was a good way to wrap up a perfect meal.

This place just feels like home to me.  Maybe it is because we've gotten to know some of the wait staff on a closer level.  Maybe it is because we've lived in the neighborhood for a few years and have been coming here multiple times per year ever since.  And maybe it is just because of the coziness of the restaurant itself.  Whatever it is, this place has it.   For instance, last night when we were finished with our dessert, I was prepared to get up and say goodbye to a couple of the servers and go ... and then I remembered I had to pay.  That's the type of place this is ... you forget you are in a restaurant and believe you are visiting friends.  The food here is also usually very good and pretty inventive -- though sometimes the chef stretches a little bit (I had a pork cutlet dish last night with risotto and the risotto was flavored with fennel frond, which gave it a licorice flavor ... not what I want from my risotto, personally).  Overall, the menu is fairly inventive, has awesome appetizer and main course options.  And the dessert, oh god the dessert.  If Brent would agree to come make his baklava or bread pudding for me on a daily basis, I would seriously reconsider my sexual preferences ... Overall, this place is just phenomenal.  They treat you like you belong there and they treat you like family.  And in a day and age where service seems to lack so much, when one of HB's servers is also their pastry chef, their front of the house guy is also an accomplished photographer, and the owner was the former executive chef and loved the place so much he bought it, it is easy to understand why the service is so good. You couple good service, with good prices ($28 prix fixe menu on Wednesdays, $37 all you can eat Maryland crab on Thursdays during the summer), a BYOB set-up, and some cozy surroundings, and you get this gem of a restaurant in the heart of Lakeview.  Come for the food.  Come back again and again for the people who work there.",0.9968,0.806,0.164,0.03,0.46016666666666667

I'd suggest making a rez since it's so small. BYOB.",0.9836,0.641,0.359,0.0,0.7261904761904763

2007-01-22,5.0,"Just happened upon this place Saturday afternoon and I already want to go back.  The place is city-quaint, the staff charming and the food delectable. There were a few things on the menu that sounded amazing and I couldn't decide b/t breakfast and lunch...so, we ordered the beniegts to start...fried dough w/powdered sugar...what's not to liked!  I asked our waiter for inspiration...since one of my choices was a ""special"", he advised I should go with it.  Great advice...it was phenomenal...stuffed portobello sandwich w/truffled frites...YUM!!!  It was prepared a la burger on a pretzel roll...the mushroom, the stuffing, the roll...all good.  My bf got the apple and cheese  (forgot type) omelet...which came w/the infamous biscuit and strawberry butter.  He liked his meal, as well. HB is a great spot and has a great vibe...it could just as well be in NYC as Chicago.",0.9843,0.749,0.222,0.029,0.668452380952381
2007-01-08,4.0,"It has been interesting to watch this place transform over the years.  Remember back in the day when it was run and open off and on by some beatnic poet guy?  He made some good omeletes. Its been great to watch the Hearty Boys open their place here, first as catering, then brearkfast/coffee spot and now more upscale dinner/brunch restaurant.  I have been here many times and always enjoyed the food and atmosphere.  The servers are friendly and food interesting.  Our brunch favorite is the strawberry butter which is simply delish on their soft buttery biscuits.  Wish I had more time to dine here more often!",0.9747,0.794,0.206,0.0,0.5053221288515406
2006-12-18,5.0,"This place is hands down one of the best places to eat! Brunch is amazing, dinner is great - and dessert? Don't get me started! I come here often, and I've had plenty of things on their menu - from banana pancakes to crabcake benedict to artichoke fritters - to duck, rabbit risotto, pork chops, escargot, and a cupcake flight - I've not once been let down. And the guys and gals who work there are so friendly. I've always gotten in, even without a reservation, and I've been treated so well! BYOB means that your bill won't be too pricey - so bring  your own vino and drink up! But leave them a nice tip please.",0.9777,0.791,0.2,0.009,0.6284722222222222
2006-12-14,4.0,"Fun place run by the Hearty Boys Caterers, Dan Smith and Steve McDonagh. Brunch is a must. Had the Pumpkin Pancakes and shared the Beignets. I would order the Pumpkin Pancakes over nearly every sweet breakfast item in Chicago.",0.8271,0.796,0.204,0.0,0.4166666666666667
2006-12-02,4.0,"We had an excellent meal with excellent service.  BYOB is always a plus, especially if you know it before hand.  We didn't.  Our fault, but a quick run to Kafka by a new friend landed us a nice New Zealand Pinot to go along with our fabulous food (thanks again, by the way, if you're reading).  The chef gave us the rundown of the specials (there were a ton!).   We started with a venison and cognac pate served on mixed greens with sesame flatbread and a number of accouterments, including some great spicy dijon, sweet delicious beets, a tasty balsamic reduction, classic cornichons and pickled peal onions.   For my entree, I enjoyed a rich, hearty rabbit risotto which proceeded to knock my socks off.  Perfectly prepared.  My partner had a venison stew was laced with some wintry spices and herbs that made enjoying the tender, flavorful meat and carrots that much easier.   Dessert was a ""cupcake flight"" and made for a nice finish.  We split one order (three cupcakes) between the two of us and it was just enough.  The pumpkin cupcake with cream cheese frosting was slightly orgasmic.   I can't wait to go back!",0.9969,0.708,0.292,0.0,0.6235836627140974

2006-09-16,4.0,"A great BYOB spot when you're in the mood for something different.  I love it for entertaining out of town guests.  Small restaurant, takes reservations and inventive menu.  Loved the pork chop and seafood stew.  We have been several times and the service is really improving.  Try it! UPDATE: While management has changed, the executive chef is the new owner.  Among some of the nicer changes, the restaurant has introduced a three-course prix fix menu -- with variety to boot!  Not to mention, on Thursdays during the summer, they serve all you can eat Maryland crab.  We haven't made it yet, but will be trying to get there in August before the crab runs out.  The only true negative is that the service can get a bit slow at times and sometimes you almost need to flag down your server.  But the food more than makes up for the potential service issues.",0.8683,0.86,0.109,0.031,0.5731431966726085
2006-08-26,5.0,"Cute, intimate little spot that is friendly and approachable.  Although a little pricey for an 'average' night out, it makes for a great special occassion and the BYOB option is definitely a plus.  The food was unique and tasty with a great visual appeal too.  We started with the mixed greens/vanilla peaches/chevre  salad - wow, what a great combo of flavors.  We had the pork loin and the steak frites - the pork loin was definitely the winner, but the chimichurri sauce and steak frites fries were delish (especially for someone who doesn't usually indulge in fried foods). The cupcake trio was only average - would expect a more spectacular dessert to match the entrees. Overall a great dining experience and would definitely go again.",0.9805,0.767,0.233,0.0,0.5948571428571429
2006-08-10,5.0,"My sister & I came for the 2 for $50 crab bake on Thursday night.  It was absolutely heavenly & a great deal for the money!  You begin with an iceberg lettuce wedge, then they bring you foccacia & fresh roasted corn.  After you tackle all that can you begin eating the crab entree. Between the two people, you get 20 crabs.  Prepare to get down & dirty!  I was completely covered in crab juice (as I am sure were my neighbors) by the end.  We wrapped our evening with the cupcake flight. Service was excellent!  Our servers were very attentive & friendly, & they even explained to us how to devour the crabs. The brunch menu looks really yummy as well, so hopefully I can convince my husband to stop by on the weekend to check it out.",0.9818,0.75,0.216,0.033,0.657070707070707

On the good side, we were shocked that we could sit down right away at 11 AM on a Sunday morning. On the bad side, for not being swamped the service was terrible. They forgot to bring us out our food, and then forgot to bring the check. The food itself was good. I would go back to try dinner, it sounds like the dinner menu is a lot more inventive.",0.6124,0.774,0.138,0.088,0.5617724867724867

The waiters and servers were both really friendly and really helpful at helping us choose a good meal. I had their seared salmon and it was absolutely delicious. I loved the BYOB aspect and theirs tons of little shops around this place to grab a good bottle of wine.

2005-06-09,4.0,"Quick, Joe, let's race down to the Old Sawmill to see if the man with the eyepatch is still lurking about! No, not the HARDY Boys, the HEARTY Boys. The Hearty Boys have a popular catering business in Chicagoland that's reviewed elsewhere here on Yelp, and have now taken over a defunct restaurant in Boystown with delightful results. It's a funky, fresh place with a casual, relaxed feel that's still a little special in its storefront location. They offer unusual menu items, like my duck breast on a peach puree. It's a no-corkage BYOB place and it works well that way. We brought a chilled bottle of white and a red, and even as we were being seated, coasters for the bottles, a corkscrew, and appropriate wine glasses for each appeared, in mere seconds. The entire crew fawned over Max, my friends' delightful toddler, as he chowed on Cheerios while we zipped through some fig and gorgonzola spread and moved on to stuffed porkchops with smoked oysters and other delicious fare. Service was friendly and efficient and the waitstaff included some nice eyecandy too! I'm jealous that Marc and Beth, my Old Country-via-San Francisco-transplanted to Chicago friends, live just around the corner from this great new place. When they really hit their stride, watch out for this place, it should be a landmark.",0.9901,0.757,0.2,0.043,0.5572611832611831
