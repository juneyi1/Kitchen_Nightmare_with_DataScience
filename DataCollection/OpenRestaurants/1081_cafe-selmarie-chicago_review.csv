2017-08-06,1.0,"LGBT COMMUNITY ALERT:  RESIST CAFE SELMARIE! This Sunday afternoon  I and a local celebrity Queen were refused seating when there were 8 empty tables and no line of waiting customers for the following reasons: From the Hostess: 1.  We cannot seat you at a table because there are no tables available.  2.  Yes there are open tables but the servers will not serve you. 3.  Others - note, no one was present - are on the list and have been waiting and are ahead of you (but no one was seated.) 4.  Never offered to add us to ""the list."" 5.  You can purchase food to go. As we stood there stunned and humiliated a counter person told us: 1.  We have a lot of managers here but none are available to speak with you. 2.  Would you like to buy some food and take it with you?   When I explained that the multiple given reasons for not seating us - all of which were obviously false -- made me suspect that there may be a different reason for not seating us I was told I could buy something at the counter if I wanted and take it with me.  I said I would never spend money in a bigoted place such as this and they said that was my choice.

2017-07-18,4.0,"This is a cute cafe in Lincoln Square. They have a counter with pastries, cakes, cookies, coffees, etc. And they also have a restaurant area. Pro tip: When it's nice, definitely opt to sit outside. The service is friendly and attentive. The menu is plentiful. They numerous regular offerings, as well as a selection of daily specials. The daily specials include drink specials. It's cafe-type food. Think sandwiches, salads, omelettes, etc. I couldn't decide what I wanted, so I opted for several of their sides. I had a side salad, side mac 'n' cheese, and side potato salad. Fair warning: Their sides are pretty big! The potato salad was the smallest of the sides and was absolutely amazing! Very tasty. The side salad (which also comes with most sandwiches, etc.) was quite tasty. Fresh and the honey champagne vinegarette it comes with is outstanding. The mac 'n' cheese was sizeable enough to be its own meal. It was tasty, but a little bit lacking. It could've been kicked up a notch with different cheeses or add-ins or something. George C. ordered the salmon sandwich (kinda like a BLT with salmon) and devoured it. Try to leave room for dessert. Their offerings, which are primarily German, are quite fab. All in all, it's a great price for what you get and a cute patio brunch / lunch spot. We'll for sure be back.",0.9872,0.819,0.169,0.012,0.5300289987789987

2017-04-13,3.0,"Part of me thinks I should wait a day or so before writing this but the maxim that you're only as good as your last meal--or in this case, service experience--rings true and alas, it totally undermined what I have always thought Cafe Selmarie was all about. And for the record, the comments are not about the sit-down restaurant experience but rather the bakery counter.  It is a stalwart, to be sure, one of a small handful of Lincoln Square businesses that have endured through the area's gentrification. (Lincoln Quality Meats also carries the ""old-timer"" banner and I often make a point of dropping in there, too, an acknowledgement of its tenacity.) And mostly, Selmarie is a worthy spot with lovely baked goods that pay homage to an ethnic past while still acknowledging current tastes and trends.  I'm most likely to drop in at holidays. The stollen is terrific at Christmas and hot cross buns are an essential part of pre-Easter traditions. So I walk in this morning, about 45 minutes after opening. There was a brief moment of panic--no hot cross buns to be seen. They seem to appeal to an ever-shrinking audience so I always worry about them becoming obsolete here, there and everywhere. There were two people working at the counter; I asked if they had any h-c buns. She said they weren't quite ready last she checked. Ponytail guy, with all the disinterested ennui he could stir up from his bored, lifeless self, said they weren't iced yet. Nice gal goes back to check and before she even reaches the prep room, someone walks to the front case carrying a tray of the little beauties, icing in perfect crossed pattern.  Working a counter in a charming little neighborhood bakery may not be his dream job but it's his job, the one for which he applied and accepted and for which Selmarie owners pay him to fulfill. Accepting those facts, it is his obligation to represent the business professionally and with a sense of customer service. His affectations and lack of respect for guests or for the owners is pretty repellent. It mattered not a whit to him to either serve a customer or to sell the business's products.  Anyway, nice gal packs up a couple of still-warm hot cross buns. They are exactly as they should be (well, almost; I still dream of finding them set atop the little rice paper base as they were long ago intended to be), so good that I might go back on Friday and Saturday before they disappear until next year. And if I do, fingers are crossed that Bored Guy is on hiatus.",0.9866,0.776,0.137,0.087,0.591425120772947

2016-10-04,4.0,"I came here with my Grandpa for breakfast and thoroughly enjoyed the meal. We both got the mushroom breakfast sandwich.  The side salad (mixed greens, cucumber, tomatoes, light dressing) was fresh and delicious. The potatoes were mediocre. I would have like a bit more crunch, almost tasted like they had been sitting out for a while.  The sandwich itself was fabulous and even though I was stuffed, I ate the entire thing. There was a hearty amount of egg, mushrooms, some kale, and a spicy(?) mayo on a nice, soft bun. I don't like kale so I was happy that I couldn't really taste it, yet, I was still getting a portion of veggies in my meal. The flavor of the mayo was definitely the strongest taste of the sandwich but I loved it so I didn't mind. I will say though, it was a bit of a bummer not to taste much mushroom flavor considering it was a mushroom breakfast sandwich.  The meal came with a side of some type of sauce or dressing (it was vinegary with lots of spices) which honestly confused the both of us since the sandwich had a sauce and the salad was pre-dressed so we both left it on our plates unsure what it was supposed to be used for.  The reason I give this place a 4/5 is because although I loved my meal, the wait staff wasn't very attentive. There was no one around to seat us when we first arrived, although it said ""please wait to be seated"" on the door. During our dining experience they only refilled our coffee once (and only when my Grandpa asked), and they never asked how our meal was or if we needed anything. My water cup sat empty (and I sat thirsty waiting for it to be filled) for quite some time... and when we asked for a refill it took a few more minutes for the guy to come back (without my water) so we had to ask a second wait staff. Regardless, no one was rude to us in any way. Overall, yummy food. Okay wait staff. I hope to come back and try a pastry because they looked delicious.",0.9847,0.806,0.141,0.053,0.5664215686274511

Once seated I got the sense that our server wanted to be elsewhere, just distant, but still professional. I've been doing a Cobb Salad tour around the city, as it's one of my most favorite things to have. My salad tasted great and looked pretty too, then I had salad envy when I saw the size of the exact salad served a couple of tables over. At first I thought I was imagining it, and then I remembered that I took a pic, so I pulled it up, yes definately quite a bit smaller. Also slow on the coffee refill, I would have had a bit more, but waited awhile for my one refill, and wasn't offered any when she dropped off the check. When I was a server I made sure not to keep people waiting on things like coffee and water. Also if it wasn't busy, which it wasn't I'd ask if people wanted a refill when I dropped off the check. I know this place is small, however for a short time there were only three tables occupied, then two counting  us. So no reason for slow service.  Will I go back, sure, I'm hoping this was a blip in their service and preparation of my salad.

2016-04-21,4.0,"Love Selmarie - been coming here for years! Their food is always fresh and yummy. Wednesday night is half price wine night, so it's definitely on our rotation. They lose a star because of the tight indoor seating. I hate it when restaurants have a bunch of 2 top tables in a row - where you're so close to the table next to you, that you can hear their conversation. To their credit, the distance between the tables is a lot more than at other places (I'm looking at you, Gather), and, it's a small space, so I don't blame them for using that space as effectively as they can. They've recently changed the dinner menu - it's much smaller than before. You can't go wrong with the salmon here - no matter how it's prepared, it's always good. I had the zucchini linguine, and it was tasty, but nothing to jump up and down about. The grilled broccoli with pecan crumble was good, if grilled a bit too much for my taste. Salad, service, and wine was great. It says on yelp that it's 'good for kids'. I would suggest not, unless they are older kids - able to sit still for a meal, and not be loud, as toddlers and small children are wont to do. Because the space is really small, there's no room to let a kid get up and stretch their legs, and it's definitely too small to use anything other than your 6-inch voice.  Definitely worth a visit any time/day of the week in the summer when the patio is open. Lovely al fresco dining here in the Square!",0.9898,0.798,0.173,0.029,0.4812375992063493

As a tip, you can also create your own ""standard"" breakfast by mixing and matching the side items. I often order a couple eggs, sausage, and toast from the sides menu a la carte, and the overall price is super reasonable. And when you order toast, they bring a mountain of it (like 6 half pieces of toast). Also, try the mimosas for an extra fun brunch. They are basically a glass of champagne with a splash of OJ, rather than the other way around. If not, their coffee is always fresh and tasty.  I'm not as big of fan of the dinner options, mostly because I find them to be rather pricey. For instance, one time my boyfriend and I literally got soup & salad for dinner and somehow the bill came out to $70. WUT. We never run into this problem at brunch.

But little did i know upon looking around I saw one of the most unimaginable desserts i could even fathom in my mind til i saw it that combined 2 of my all time favorite desserts together. Which was a OREO CHEESECAKE!!! I always love cookie and cream shakes and cheesecake as there own dessert, but putting them together ugh..-DROOLING- I was with another friend the also enjoys cookie n creme just as much but there suggestion was that it would be better if the crust was oreo. On my note i believe it was amazing as it is. Continuing on aside from the oreo cheesecake i ate breakfast there. It was pleasent we sat outside on a beautiful morning where it had a nice breeze and the sun was height enough to provide some warmth. Over seeing the people walking about with there families and the water fountain brought a family welcoming vibe to the place such as a park. Ordering food got a bit confusing because we were looking at there menu, but it was different from the sit down menu so that happened. I ordered the salmon eggs benedict. I'm a big salmon fan getting it for breakfast was a no brain-er. the salmon was smoked to cook the begal used as the base gave it the crispy texture, the grilled asparagus added to the smokey taste, and the egg on top when cut through with the drizzling yolk gave it moisture and was the final flavor when combine with everything made it all perfect for a healthy breakfast in the morning waking all my taste buds.",0.9946,0.794,0.181,0.024,0.6457264957264959

Deciding between sweet and savory is a tough choice, but I did not regret this one!  My friend's smoked salmon breakfast looked like a good, savory competitor.

Thank you Osi V for opening with the cinnamon roll--it was definitely big enough for the 3 of us to get a good taste.  It was a great opener--subtle cinnamon flavor and delicious icing.   For my main, I opted for the smoked salmon breakfast--cold-smoked atlantic salmon, thinly sliced, with scrambled eggs, capers, red onion and a toasted english muffin and a side of cream cheese.  I subbed the potatoes for fruit and received fresh pineapple and orange slices. The smoked salmon was of excellent quality and very tasty. The scrambled eggs were fluffy and well made.  It was all very very good.  Service was friendly, although our server seemed a bit harried--I wonder if she had too many tables to take care of.

While waiting in line I sat on an available stool off to the side to be more comfortable. Several minutes later the host came over and somewhat loudly announced that another woman wanted to sit there and dine; the implication was that I shouldn't be sitting there and needed to move. He also pointed out that she had a cane. While I appreciate him trying to accommodate another patron, I would have appreciated being asked nicely and candidly to move instead of being told and embarrassed in front of other people in the process. Furthermore, I used the stool while I waited to accommodate my own disability, one that may not necessitate a cane and be completely obvious to someone who doesn't know me, but that deserves just as much consideration as the other patron.

We both had the vegetarian chili, which was hearty and flavorful.  We split a roasted brussels sprout salad which was perfectly lightly dressed with caramelized roasted brussels sprouts. So delicious!  The wait staff was super friendly and helpful.  The case of pastries looked amazing but with super full bellies we took a pass.  Looks like this place could be a regular stop this winter.",0.977,0.75,0.23,0.02,0.6747481684981685

Last Thursday, the ""Tomatoe Bisque Soup"" had a strong, spicy taste, familiar with flavoring in Mexico.   Speaking to the manager, I asked why the soup, in Cafe Selmarie which has been serving bakeries familiar with Central European Recipes, is changing Tomatoe Bisque soup to Mexican type flavoring. I was told that calling the flavor Mexican, would be an insult to the cook from Mexico.  If I did not like it, ""Go to the Brauhaus, they are German, this is an American restaurant.""

I was told a 20 minute wait on a Saturday early afternoon for brunch...not bad. We did only wait about 20 mins. We got outside seating on a beautiful fall day! The coffee and almond biscotti was DELICIOUS! Cons- I didn't know who was my waiter, I don't even think they even knew who was suppose to serve our table! It took forever to get service and barely was given attention. I ordered the corned beef hash....was not impressed, I ate half of it. My boyfriend had the roastbeef sandwich and he didn't complain, but he was also not impressed. I think the service turned me off the most:/ And finally only after I got my hot plate did they tell me there were no more croissants....how disappointing:( Overall the bakery is nice, service was quick at the bakery. However once seated don't think you'll get that much attention:/ the food was average. That's why it got three stars, because the food was mediocre and the service was not attentive enough.

I was particularly turned off by their quiche. It doesn't feel ""French"" at all. Is it the cheese, the eggs or the dough? I can't put my finger on it. It was just too big and boring. Mind you, I was thrilled with their idea of making a different quiche for breakfast every day. Unfortunately, the cappuccino too was a very different experience from that of the previous day: too BIG, with a coarse froth and very low coffee content. On the bright side, the service is SUPER FRIENDLY and swift,  the ambiance is nice and bright with well chosen artists exhibiting new work all the time...

I don't mean that in the sense of ""I adore this place so much and I love their food"", though those things are true, I mean that in the literal sense. They cook their food perfectly. Eggs as fluffy and light as a cloud. Cheddar biscuits as cheddary and biscuity as you could ask. Sausage gravy as creamy and flavorful and full of sausage as I've ever had. Every single menu item I've ever ordered here (and I come here a lot), breakfast, lunch, whatever, is perfectly executed, right down to the delicious house vinaigrette on the side salad that accompanies many dishes. Everything is clean and fresh and makes me feel happy. Their breakfast/brunch menus offer simple, traditional dishes as well as a rotating handful of slightly more creative offerings, so there's something for everyone. I even love their homemade potato salad, and I usually HATE restaurant potato salad, since mine is the best. Another HUGE thing they get right is portion size. If you're like me, you love brunch with an undying passion but you feel exhausted by the massively massive portions you receive at most places. Café Selmarie's portions are - as my boyfriend puts it - ""medically accurate"". Just enough, not too much. You can eat the entire thing and not come down with a gross case of the Brunch Sweats afterwards. Ok, so this review turned into a love letter to Café Selmarie. I can't help it.

2014-02-26,4.0,"Went here for a Sunday brunch last weekend - what a neat place. An eclectic assortment of brunch items to please everyone in your crowd. From baked goods to omelets, to a salmon sandwich to interesting Mexican and Cuban inspired brunch dishes.  Tucked away in Lincoln Square on a semi-closed to traffic strip of Lincoln Ave, it's conveniently located off the Western stop of the Brown Line so for those of us with cars, it's easy to get to.  Inside the place a narrow and deep so it you're waiting for a table it can get a bit crowded so be warned especially if you bring small children who are restless just standing there. The service is very good taking a team approach with a server taking orders, others bringing food and a third party refilling coffee and water. Makes it really easy to enjoy yourself as you're aren't constantly looking around to flag someone down for a fork, coffee, to clear plates, etc. The food is the star here. my wife had the breakfast omelet which was served kind of deep dish style with all sorts of goodness including spinach and other veggies in there. Served with home fries and you've got yourself a winner if you're looking for a slightly different take on the breakfast egg dish. I had what appears to be a new dish which consisted of marinated Cuban beef served on top of these two delicious fried corn cakes (hard to describe but delicious) and topped off with black beans, poached eggs and hollandaise sauce. Yum-my! A few things to know - they supposedly do not take reservations but you can put your name on a list and request a time. Sounds like a reservation to me but I guess they don't guarantee it? Confusing. Also because it gets packed they are anxious to ""turn the tables"" so it's not the kind of place where you can hang out. Your food comes out and you eat and then you are being asked quite frequently ""can we get you anything else?"" In other words, a polite way to say ""get the heck out of here."" I get it. You don't want me sitting there all day drinking your coffee. No worries. I didn't take it personally but it is something to note as we went out with friends we hadn't seen in a few months and wanted to catch up.  Overall a nice place and we will certainly return.",0.9674,0.856,0.103,0.041,0.48567197067197077
2014-02-25,4.0,"Being away from home with kids not particularly inclined to try anything new is always a challenge when it comes to meals but being away from home also means new experiences and getting out of the comfort zone. I did a quick search online and found a place highly recommended but I knew parking would be an issue. While I kept looking, a name kept coming back and so I checked out the site and found Cafe Selmarie. I checked the menu online and most definitely decided to give it a try. While it was not really obvious to find (thanks again, GPS...) having available parking close by was a great plus and the building from outside looked nice and somewhat like a French boulangerie. As we opened the door and entered, we were greeted by the sights and smells of freshly baked pastries and coffee. Exactly what was needed in this cold February day. The room was small enough to be intimate but big enough to hold about 2 dozen tables in the main dining room. The warmth of the yellow walls clashed beautifully with the red-colored paintings on white background and our waitress was very helpful. The menu had all these wonderful-sounding dishes that made choosing something even harder. My wife opted for the French toast, my son for the pancakes, my daughter for the breakfast burrito and I went for a pear and Brie omelet.  In all these years, I have rarely seen all four of us so overwhelmed by the contents of our plates. It was hard to finish what we were served but every bite was so delicious. The sweetness of the pear mixed to the stronger taste of the Brie was too much to let anything go to waste. The kids even found some space to left gobble up a pastry while I enjoyed the last sips of my coffee. And as we were finishing our meal, the place quickly filled up and as much as we were enjoying ourselves, we decided it was time to go and let others their turn to enjoy their breakfast too. Prices were correct, about $15 per person but it was well worth it. Our time in Chicago was short so we could not repeat the experience but this place has definitely found itself a must-do on our list for our next time in town!",0.9974,0.809,0.179,0.012,0.39200193423597685

I've made cakes for a living for four years, and for personal pleasure for over twenty.  I hate buying cake because my cakes are just better, and I'm fine with putting in the effort to make genoise and Italian buttercream in order to get the quality of cake that I want.  Selmarie beats my cake every single time.  I have never had better cake in my life.  I don't know if it's just a me thing or if this is an objective fact, but I cannot think of a better cake I've ever had - at least in the range of their selections (I make an amazing absinthe cake that you're not going to be able to find at Selmarie, but that's not apropos of the quality of Selmarie's cakes). And it gets even better: they give you GIANT slices for like $3.25-$4.50.  Do you know how cheap that is?!  Whole Foods sells their house cake slices for like $2.99 and those cake layers are mass-produced and shipped in from a wholesale bakery in New Jersey and the frosting comes in 10 gallon buckets.  Selmarie's cakes are scratch made on the day before at the most.  The whole cakes are even cheaper.

You can alwayds start with an intelligentsia espresso drink, or go for a white russian coffee and make it a good start.  This last time I went for the apple cider with burbon and carmel and it definately made the freezing weather outside a bit better (afterall you don't drink apple cider when its warm outside).

Based on the reviews, I was a bit underwhelmed by the place which is why I give it a 3. Although I have to admit I didn't have a negative experience. I guess my expectations were a bit too high coming in. I am also a bit perplexed as to why this place gets a 'Vegetarians go nuts for this spot' designation. While I am not a vegetarian, I gave up eating beef and pork almost 5 - 6 months ago. With that said, I found that most of the menu items had beef or pork in them. I naturally navigate to seafood or chicken-related options but I was not in the mood for smoked salmon so I got the breakfast burrito with chicken sausage instead of chorizo. It was good, okay. Not spectacular or anything worth coming back for.

The pancakes had a nice eclectic taste with the salty bacon on top of sweetness, it was a very nice contrast. However, there is nothing super special about the pancakes. The brioche french toast was not super impressive, some vanilla pudding was added on top of the pancake along with some drizzle of fruit sauce. I ordered the fruit cup of strawberry and banana as well and it was just diced up strawberry and banana. The other person ordered a side of egg and it was just regular scrambled eggs.

2013-10-08,3.0,"First time at the Cafe. Wait time was a little on the long side but the food was worth it and the baristas on the bakery side were more than obliging to serve us some nice strong coffee (I had the americano, yum!) and put it on our table's tab while we waited. The spiked hot chocolate was delishly rich and was sure to warm up on a cold autumn day. For Sunday brunch I ordered the salmon and eggs with capers, sadly I have forgotten the official name of the dish on the menu, but it definitely had salmon there somewhere... It's definitely a salty dish with the salmon and capers, so if you're watching your salt intake you might want to order something else.  The only reason I didn't give a higher rating was because on the Cafe side, the waitress we had was a bit rude. She initially had an amiable demeanor when we were first seated and then half way through brunch you could tell something was up. Now, I know she's human and everyone has a bad day so I don't expect waitresses to smile every time they come over. But then it came to paying the bill. There were 3 of us and we split the bill. Total was about $60, averaging about $20 per person. We each tipped between 10-20% with an average of 15% total tip; which I believe is average (correct me if I'm wrong?). The waitress looked at our receipts as she was walking away and came back with a sardonic smile saying that FYI we should each be paying 20% tip of the total bill. Let's do the math: 20% of 60 = $12 x 3 = 36? You want us to pay you half of what our meal cost? Perhaps, I heard wrong and she meant we should just be all paying 20% tip, which honestly doesn't change whether you're paying (20% of 20) x 3 = 4x3 = 12 or whether you're paying 20% of 60 = 12  Which made me think she just wanted more tip, but honestly her service was only adequate. We gave up trying to get her attention to get ketchup and asked the next server that passed by. The table next to us even asked to borrow our ketchup. It wasn't bad service, it just wasn't great. So an average tip of 15% is what we gave. Still loved the coffee, the baked goods looked delicious, and the baristas were so nice.

2013-08-08,4.0,"Cafe Selmarie just revolutionized the whole brunch game. Located in the Lincoln Square neighborhood, it was easy to get to considering all the food traffic because it is surrounded by beautiful boutiques that people are actually interested in. After weeks and weeks of dieting and exercise, we didn't want to completely ruin our work outs with a heavy breakfast since we had so much to do that day. So taking a little stroll we finally decided to walk into Cafe Selmarie to see what they were all about. Best decision I made that week was to walk in there! I will admit that the look of the bakery section brought me in, we stayed for the food. David ordered the HOMEMADE corned beef hash. I ordered the Croque Monsieur. We also got this home made soup with potato, green onions, and andoulie sausage.  Lets slow things down at talk about this hash. Glorious homemade Corned beef hash! The Executive chef Bryant kindly came out to school us on how they do it. They get a massive amount of corned beef and brine it in their own spices and make it into this perfectly crisped hash. I looooved my gooey Croque, don't get me wrong. The hash stole the show though. My boyfriend had his love for me truly tested when I kept reaching over to peck at his hash.  Kudos to the chef who let us in on his process and the other selections he recommends. As you might already know, a chef who is involved in his/her food, makes it taste a million times better.  The seating was unpretentious and cozy. They crowd was mixed and  all seemed to thoroughly enjoy their meals, as did I. Street parking was a little rough for Sunday brunch but the walk wasn't too bad.  The beautiful wide arrange of pastries filled the air and made me feel warm inside. You name it, Cafe Selmarie's got it. I am bound to be back for another amazing brunch and I am positive they will not disappoint with their ever changing menu options and pastries.",0.9939,0.834,0.156,0.01,0.5916955266955267

Parking might take a bit - try the side streets. The Western Brown line stop is really close. Tons of cute shops in the nearby area. Service was excellent.  I had a black bean burger, side salad, and glass of white wine on my first visit. The black burn burger was solid, I'd give it a 7. The salad was less so, a 5 in my book. The white wine was excellent and they had a fun menu to choose from. I didn't have room to try dessert, but I sense that was a mistake because that seems to be what they're really known for around here. I think next time I'll just go for the patio, wine, and dessert.

The cafe latte was great, but for a bakery I expected more from the Kahlua Torte that I chose for dessert. It was not the freshest and I think it may have been more than a day old because I could taste it was dry and the ganache was not super fresh like I expect from  bakery.  Next time with such a large selection of dessert, I will ask for the freshest one, I also think they should serve slices of dessert with a little whipped cream which you have to ask for.",0.1969,0.82,0.086,0.094,0.5026785714285714

2013-06-20,1.0,"A friend and I went to Cafe Selmarie because we had been there a few times before and loved the food. We went there on Thursday, June 13. 2013. I believe the server's name was Paul. He was our server the last time a couple friends of mine and I were there. This time he seemed preoccupied and was very rude. We ordered our drinks, a salad and our entrees. I wanted a vegetable instead of potatoes and my friend wanted the sweet potatoes hash instead of mashed potatoes. He repeated the order and said potatoes so we assumed he knew it was sweet potatoes. When the entrees came out, there were mashed instead of sweet potatoes. Our server came over and we told him about it and he said that was not what we ordered. He was upset and surly but said he would get the sweet potatoes. Ten or 15 minutes went by and we had finished the entrees. We tried to find him to tell him we did not want it anymore but couldn't find him. Needless to say, he brought it out and we told him we didn't want it . He proceeded to tell us that we were problems the last time we were in the restaurant and it was the same now. He told us we couldn't make up our minds. He stormed away and came back with our check. We wanted dessert and coffee but he never even bothered to ask us. If you are having a bad day, do not take it out on your customers. We asked for the manager who, long story short, seemed to not even care. We did not want our meal comped, but, she could have offered us a dessert to take home or a discount on our next meal. We would have tried the restaurant again (definitely with a different waiter), but not anymore. We will never go back. There are other good restaurants in the area that know how to treat customers that only asked to change their potatoes to something else. Good Riddance!",0.9185,0.857,0.089,0.054,0.44083333333333335

2013-04-02,5.0,"I'd like to tell you that Cafe Selmarie is bad; that the waitstaff are mean; that the back of house isn't good enough to make ""Kitchen Nightmares"" and that Gordon Ramsay tried to shut the place down. I'd like to tell you all these things, because then I'd never have to wait in line for a table ever again, especially at the outside patio tables in summertime. But I am an honest Yelper, and I can only say the following: 1)  I've eaten at Selmarie since the late 1980's, when it was a teeny tiny bakery with a few sandwiches, and I've never, ever had a bad meal here. 2)  The waitstaff are pleasant, efficient, helpful, and wear black hats that aren't cutesy or obnoxious. 3)  Entering past the bakery case is an exercise in restraint. It's amazing to me that there aren't saliva trails on the glass-fronted case, but I think the staff is very good at cleaning that sort of thing up quickly. 4)  Even the coffee is good. On many occasions, I stick with the tried and true and get the chopped salad. Yum. My favorite. On the weekend, they sell slices of apple strudel. Again, yum. Today, we varied from our standard repertory. I had the applewood-bacon BLT with boursin cheese on marble rye, and that came with a cup of tomato bisque soup. Wonderful. My friend had a salmon wrap with salad side. The busboy tried to take her plate when she had two bites left. He's lucky she didn't wrestle him to the ground. She wanted those last two bites. But don't believe me. Go to the latest ""hot"" restaurant, folks, where the cheapest alcoholic beverages start at $12.00. Stand in line for an hour at some overpriced Yuppie brunch place. Follow a ""star"" chef from restaurant to restaurant. Please. Do all those things. And while you're doing those things, me and mine will be having the mac and cheese with leeks, the crusty and piping hot chicken pot pie, the quiche of the day, the veggie chili, and oh, just maybe, a dessert. Flourless chocolate cake. Raspberry chocolate tart. Apple strudel pie. And . . . oh, I don't know what else, Selmarie. Surprise me.

The fact that one is faced with their extensive pastry case immediately upon entrance sets the appetite in motion. They have a small but fully servicable beer/wine/cocktail list. I ordered a glass of a French white and we started off with the roasted beet salad. The beets were warm and roasted perfectly. The greens were fresh cool and crisp.  Partner order the Chicken Pot Pie and I the Pork Chop. His entree looked delectible the pot pie arrived with two puff pastry triangles artistically positioned on top of the filling in lieu of the traditional pie crust. He said it tasted as good as it looked. My pork chop was accompanied by garlicy mashed potatoes and roasted (I'm pretty sure but not absolutely positive) brussels sprouts. The chop may have been on the fire for a couple minutes too long but any less would probably make most nervous. I had ordered a pinot noir to compliment my entree which turned out perfectly. Partner ordered a cappacino and I an esspresso and we shared tDheir caramel apple bread pudding for desert. Desert arrived nicely warmed with a side of fresh whipped cream.

Everything on their menu is delicious and portioned out perfectly.  The food is of great quality.  They once had an amazing pan seared calf's liver with balsamic reduction that was absolutely delicious.  Our usual goto starter are the Mussels is fantastic butter, garlic wine broth with grilled bread.  The Wagyu beef tenderloin with garlic mash and squash was superb. The presentations on the plates are beautiful.  You'll want to keep coming back here time after time to try something new.  The drinks are also great, they make a tasty vodka lemonade, with homemade pink lemonade.  They also had this great ginger soda and rum drink that was so refreshing.  I am always excited to make it here!  Get over there!",0.9979,0.722,0.275,0.004,0.6998491407582316

I'm always impressed by the spread of cakes, pastries, truffles, and other goodies in the display.  Not only has everything that I have ever had here been of very high quality, but it is also clear that the chefs here are creative and want to try new things.  My most recent time in they had made mini pumpkin pies inside of mini pumpkins (cute AND delicious).  The fact that there is always something new makes me that much more likely to want to stop in when I am in Lincoln Square. Coffee drinks are fine but a little slow.  I wouldn't recommend coming here specifically for an espresso drink, but it's nice that they have the option to go with your pastries.  All considered, this is a great place and I'm hoping to be equally impressed by their sit-down restaurant service some day.",0.9858,0.761,0.194,0.045,0.7016404958677686

Unfortunately that's where my compliments stop. One of the times the hash was cold. I feel like they barely cooked it. Either that or it was sitting there for a while. A week ago or so I went in for dinner. The menu was so boring. There was only a few appetizer options, none of which were appealing. I ended up getting a side salad which was ok, the dressing wasn't very flavorful but it was ok. Then I got a pasta dish, which again was ok, not great, but way over priced. My girlfriend got a steak, and that was good, but let's face it. A well cooked steak is always good. Then we had dessert. The coffee was great. The dessert... Not so great. The raspberry torte was dry. Then the cookies my girlfriend got were stale. My opinion, go for brunch, but there's better places in the square for dinner.",0.9582,0.711,0.196,0.093,0.6198717948717949

Lunch and Dinner are also good options at Selmarie.  Lunch sandwiches are very good and dinner items are a bit more upscale.  My only complaint -- the dessert pastries leave a bit to be desired.  I have tried several cakes and found them to be dry and somewhat unappetizing -- and they look beautiful in the dessert case.

With plenty of seating both indoors and outside on the patio right in Giddings Plaza, it is great for both small and large groups. Expect to wait between 10-20 minutes on the weekend.  Want variety? They have different Saturday and Sunday brunch menus which makes sure you will certainly find something you'll love to order and you won't end up with taste aversion. However, this place also has breakfast, lunch AND dinner, but I've only been for brunch. That being said, my go-to is the chilaquiles casserole. These are not your tortilla chips with salsa on top chilaquiles you are used to and it is fabulous. Freshly baked casserole with eggs and corn tortillas, pulled chicken breast in a spicy sauce. The fact that it is baked gives the top layer a great crispy taste; top if off with some queso fresco, avocado and cilantro and it's a party in your mouth. The brioche french toast is also impressive with fresh mixed berry compote.  I love that they have specials most days of the week, including  1/2 price bottles of wine with dinner entrée purchase, free dinner desserts, and Thursdays a great $22 prix fixe menu. A pleasant surprise is that they have a nice drink list as well with beer, cocktails, and wine.  Kids? No problem.

Café Selmarie has a bakery up front that you have to walk through to get to the dining area.  The fragrances and presentations of the wide variety of bakery goods are very appealing and a strong inducement for in-house dining customers to make carry-out purchases. Our waiter was informative and efficient.  I asked to start our meal with a shared slice of coffee cake and left the selection to the discretion of our waiter.  We were subsequently served a poppy seed coffee cake that we divided amongst us.  The cake was extremely fresh and very delicious.  In fact, one person in our party said it was the best coffee cake she ever had. For our main dishes we ordered the pancakes (three cakes - no short order available) with blueberries and whipped cream, the breakfast burrito, the standard eggs Benedict, and a spinach omelet.  The pancakes and the burrito were rated excellent, the Benedict very good, and the omelet good but rather ordinary.        Note: alfresco dining is offered in warm weather in an area adjacent to the side of the restaurant building next to a park.

The waitstaff actually understands the meaning of a lunch rush - people need to get in, out, and back to work. Props for that. I've stopped coming in for breakfast, just too many other places give just as good quality, but better portions for the buck. That's not to say I'm looking for a huge portion, but I like the option of toast with my meal without paying extra. Also, the acoustics in the dining room are not hangover friendly. At times it's annoying enough to make me rush through my meal to leave, especially when there's a shrieking kid in the room (which is usually all the time). But really, the crown jewel is the desserts. I can't walk out of this place without at least getting something to go from the bakery. Everything is SO GOOD, with the exception of the cupcakes. I can't figure out what they do wrong with them, the flavor is additively good, it's just always dry. I've tried them too many times, even asking if they're fresh. So, I'd say skip those, and get anything else you see. Cookies: Yum! Try the lavender rosemary, sugar, chocolate chip, any kind is a winner. Scones? Yes please! Always moist and the ingredients are nicely distributed. Who wants a scone with 2 dates and 3 walnuts? Here, you're sure to get at least a fruit or nut in each bite! Cakes....

My husband ordered and bloody mary which did not taste right. Not once did she ask how the food was. At the end of the meal she dropped off the bill and ran. Bloody mary still full. It took asking the hostess to get her back and explain that the drink did not taste right. Lack of attentiveness was a real drag.

I guess I just expected more considering the baked goods storefront.  The chili was tasty, but again, the cornbread that accompanied it really wasn't anything special. The salad was great, based on the sole fact that it had fresh ingredients and I love brie cheese, but it's not anything I couldn't have made at home. I gave it three stars because healthy options are hard to find when you are traveling, and while I would not list this among my favorite spots, I would definitely visit again for fresh, well prepared food.

First, the highlights of service: they permitted our party of five to split the check, they let our group lollygag until waaay past their closing time, never once giving us the stinkeye, they were courteous and efficient, but not overbearing. Our waitress exhibited a very pleasant, professional demeanor overall.  I ordered the day's ""special salad"" which was locally sourced arugula, black heirloom tomatoes, basil, shallots, and mozzarella, maybe a balsamic dressing, but it was barely detectable. It was $9 or $10, a huge portion, fresh, flavorful and sent me over the moon. I was in love with that salad. So much so, when I returned to Houston, I did not go home, but straight to Whole Foods first to gather up those ingredients to attempt to recreate the moment again.    To balance out the salad, I also ordered the starter portion of the macaroni and cheese. Small is all you need. This little casserole is rich and decadent. The cheese was gooey and stringy, with crunchy edges. It was such a shame that I could not finish it. I want some now.  For my refreshment, I tried The Poet, an oatmeal stout with a bitter, chocolatey taste. I'm usually not a beer drinker, but I sampled this with the bee eff in mind.

Went for dinner with a few friends on a Wednesday, so we were able to partake in the 1/2 price bottle of wine with an entree special.  The front is a counter area with some delicious looking desserts and pastries displayed. I didn't try anything at the time, but would definitely be up for a return visit just for that. Past that, it opens up into a sit down dining area. It isn't terribly big, but I never felt crowded which is the case at many restaurants without a large dining area. It was also remarkably free of children, which I think is worth noting considering the neighborhood. Not sure how that would change on a weekend or brunch, but I have a feeling it would. The menu is fairly small, but everything on it sounded great. If one thing was lacking, it would be vegetarian dishes. I was thisclose to ordering mac and cheese, but was an adult instead and settled on the spinach salad with a side of sweet potatoes which were a little spicy and very good. There was a vegetable plate listed online which was no where to be found on the menu, but I was totally satisfied with my decision.  Everything was reasonably priced, service was excellent. Definitely recommend for a low-key dinner in the neighborhood!",0.9952,0.761,0.228,0.011,0.5680324074074073

My boyfriend and I went on Good Friday for brunch, and it was pretty busy.  The wait was 20 minutes, but we walked around the square and came back with only a short wait remaining.  The wait was completely worth it.   To start, we got a cup of vegetarian chili and sweet potato wedges.  I love me some sweet potatoes, and these were top notch.  They were so soft, but still held up enough to be able to pick up with a fork.  The dipping sauce for the sweet potatoes was amazing, the best dip I've ever had.  The vegetarian chili was great as well - especially since it came with a ton of melted cheese on top! The chili also came with a giant chunk of cornbread, which was also amazing!  As though I wasn't already completely in heaven, we went on to the main course.  My boyfriend had a the smoked turkey and Brie sandwich and loved it - especially the apple accents.  I got the roasted vegetable stack and was blown away.  As a vegetarian, I've come to detest roasted vegetable sandwiches, as they all sort of blend together and get so bland.  The stack was a revelation!  The goat cheese complimented the portabello  perfectly. The layout is not meant to support large groups or crazy busy days, but the wait you might have to endure is completely worth it.",0.9976,0.723,0.259,0.019,0.6190732513100933

Back in February it was my son's Cub Scout annual Raingutter Regatta so I thought how great to bring sail boat shaped cookies- well, I remember once upon a visit this place had them in the case. So I called, after a few long Ummmmmmmmmm's, they asked if they could get back to me. I could hear it over the phone- although they didn't say it out loud- why does someone want sailboats in the middle of winter?! (I agree) but, sure enough I believe the lovely woman that called me back was named Connie, she said the baker would make them he just had to find the shape as it was in another season's box put away. Thank you, thank you!! Now this is customer service and how you should run a business!  Skip a couple months and I  know that they only make Hot Cross Buns for Easter and they are SO good. For whatever reason I had this great idea to get some and bring them into work today, but of course this great idea didn't come to me until my drive home last evening. I called and as much as she wanted to say 'sure' she needed to call me back after she called the baker to see if he would come in early enough to make them for me for the time I wanted to pick them up. Again, fabulous amazing customer service at its finest, I get the call- Yes, the baker will come in and have them ready for you.  I arrived this morning, early, they were still in the oven- seriously does it get any better??? While I waited I had a Cafe Au Lait, on the house to boot. I picked up my hot Hot Cross Buns, all 3 dozen of them- brought them into work- still hot and they were gone in less than 30 minutes.

As much as my co-workers tried to impress upon me that I'd, actually, just eaten at CS, I didn't believe them. Well, I believe them now.

I didn't want to leave. I wanted to stay, drink coffee, eat amazingly good food, contemplate big issues, take a nap, and wake up to do it all over again. Forget this rat-race American lifestyle. Life is to be experienced and enjoyed with friends and good food. I was reminded of that at CS. I was also reminded that I drink a lot of coffee when it's quality. I'm more of a tea drinker, but whatever they're brewin' at CS is mighty good stuff. I had multiple cups (which our server never allowed to get low). To eat (because fatty needs his food), I took a short trip to a very happy place and chowed down on a salmon scramble that was chock-full of egg, fish and dill. Every bite was a joy. The potatoes that accompanied my breakfast weren't an afterthought. They were delicately seasoned and copiously supplied. I was so satisfactorily full from the experience, I didn't even have any baked goods. I know! Fatty said no! I must not have had a Zima. I never say no after one of those.*  A joy.

2010-12-01,4.0,"Apparently, when you're dating someone, you go to brunch a lot.  And when the bf and I decided to do brunch one recent Sunday, I realized that I really need to expand my memorized arsenal of restaurants to include ""good brunch spots.""  Luckily, I remembered Cafe Selmarie. We walked in on a chilly but pleasant morning and were seated immediately.  Score!  But upon settling in, my whole body was enveloped in a rather stifling heat wave.  The place was hot hot HOT!   We ordered our coffees (cafe au lait was fabulous) and then our entrees.  Now, anybody who knows me will tell you that I tend to gravitate towards the sweeter items on the menu, especially for a meal like brunch.  But for whatever reason (perhaps an overabundance of recently consumed holiday treats?) I went the savory way, and ordered the corned beef hash, while my dining companion ordered the other dish I considered, the lemon ricotta griddle cakes.  (Id'n he sweet?)  Funny story about the corned beef hash ... I'd never had poached eggs before, and in the time between ordering and receiving our food, I'd forgotten that the hash came with two poached eggs on top.  So when the plate was set in front on me, my first thought was that it was topped with two large dollops of sour cream.  Not even thinking about it, I started to dip my fork in the ""sour cream"" and noticed that the texture was ... off.  What the?  About 5 seconds later, I remembered what they were.  Oh yeah.  Duh, Heidi. Back on topic.  The hash was delicious.  The boy's griddle cakes were even more delicious.  He was kind enough to give me a bite and I nearly finished them off for him.  Goooood.  The only other minor negative (besides the temperature) was that it took a bit of effort to get a refill for the boy's coffee, but not a big deal.   Oh, and there was a girl sitting kiddie-corner from us who was wearing the same sweater as me!!  But that's hardly the cafe's fault.  :)",0.9893,0.845,0.127,0.029,0.5494505494505494

2010-11-08,3.0,"Selmarie was my favorite ladies' lunch spot.  Then they hiked up the brunch prices like highwaisted highwaters and now my feeling is ""eh."" The food is good, but stops short of extraordinary.  Several of the options are Frenchy (Croque Monsieur). which is one of the reasons I always go back.  But as my Intrepid Readers know, I just hate to feel gipped. I think the brunch prices subsidize the pastries, which are varied, beautiful, and priced to sell.  The sweets appear to be the chef's true passion. I recently paid way too much for a run-of-the mill turkey sandwich and a tiny sprinkling of greens.  I was still hungry.  I added the pinto bean and sun-dried tomato soup, which was passable.  By contrast, the potatoes (which I got to try) were terrific!  All of the food that I saw looked great and the place was bustling with happy-looking clientele.   Sadly,  we received a tasteless Bloody Mary.  Perhaps it was a fluke, but it's a fluke I'll remember.  On a brighter note, the bottles of wine are relatively inexpensive and thus tempting...and what a lovely temptation they are. For a place with no official gender affiliation, this place is full of females.  This is likely a result of a menu conducive to light lunching, which ladies tend to like.  I'd be baffled to see a group of males buck that trend.  As of now, you'll see a couple stray males who have clearly been convinced to give it a shot by their mothers or girlfriends.  They look apprehensive as they inevitably realize they are significantly outnumbered.  I find this amusing.  The location remains fabulous and the outdoor seating is plentiful and pleasant in the warm months.  In the winter, the small, elongated waiting area gets awkwardly crowded, and you may be packed in like a roomful of Ralphies.   Oh fudge! Cafe Selmarie undershot my expectations too many times in a row.  I will be forced to find a comparable soup-salad-sandwich brunch spot somewhere north of Wicker Park/Bucktown, which seems to teem with such ""contemporary"" lunch/brunch possibilites. I still recommend trying Selmarie for a (ladies') dinner.  The prix fixe is a great deal, and the entrees are conducive to sharing.  Those wild-mushroom ravioli are to die for, but they are rich like only butter and cream can be, and are thus best split with another entree or combination of appetizers. As disappointed as I am, I won't write off Selmarie, as it has been a staple of mine for so long.  I'm done with the weekend brunch, though.  Lunch or dinner on a weekday, sure. I need my fancy-pants sandwiches and low-key dinner spots, and the location and atmosphere meet little competition in Lincoln Square.

We were finally seated after being ignored for several minutes and then had to wait nearly 15 minutes for someone to take our order.  The dining area was not particularly busy (save for a table of unruly children behind us).  While we waited for our food to arrive my husband ordered a cup of coffee which was clearly not the Cafe Intelligentsia specialty brew on display at the hostess stand.  Either the pot of coffee had sat for a good while or they were brewing some nasty off-brand.  Not once did a sever come by to freshen the cup. Relative to the prices on the menu, the food was nothing special.  My husband had the snapper wrap (dry) and I had the mac and cheese.  What surprised me the most about our experience at Cafe Selmarie was the relative roughness and cheesy decor as compared to the prices of items on the menu.  I would have thought that the dining room wouldn't have been dingy and scuffed and adorned with ikea lighting.

Right away the hostess said. She seated us by the kitchen/exit to the yard even though there were plenty of open tables, I think it was because it seemed like a lower traffic area for my handicap mom. Whatever, it worked even though we would get a little draft each time the door opened (which was very often). It's OK, it was high 60s tonight so it wasn't too bad.  We each ordered a coffee drink and a pastry. The Banana Eclair, the Kahlua Cake and the Flourless Chocolate Cake. All were very delish! The eclair was definitely banana infused. I really couldn't say that about the Kahlua though, I could hardly taste the alcohol or flavoring, it was good, just chocolaty.

This time, no one from the wait/management staff said anything to them.   The food was once again very good, but their terrible clientele (and the restaurants' apparent inability to control them) makes this a hard place to enjoy.

It was exactly what we were looking for.  On Wednesday nights- wine is half priced, so my friend went on line to see what kind of wines they had.

They were very accommodating and we were happy . .and all for a very reasonable price.  The food was terrific as well. I started with the marinated goat cheese and greens and he had the lobster filled crepe. Both were delicious!  For our entrees, I went with the herb roasted chicken with mashed potatoes and my friend just told the server to surprise him and bring out her favorite dish. A great idea as the roasted pork with bacon and tomato compote was a great combination of flavors.  I loved that the front of the restaurant is a small bakery, so for dessert we wandered around looking at the display cases finally deciding on a cupcake for me, and a piece of pistachio cheesecake for him.

I went here for brunch this morning with my parents for our weekly brunch session. Reviews on here were outstanding and it's really close to my apartment. I went to bed last night thinking about French toast. The cafe is right off a sunny park in the middle of Lincoln Square. It actually felt like a getaway. It's charming and the fact that it was absolutely beautiful outside today just made the place even calmer. We stopped in at 9AM and already the patio was filled up (bummer!), so we ended up sitting inside without a wait. Not a problem. It was nice because despite being crowded, there was no shouting involved to have a conversation. Brunch spots like Toast leave you so crammed in that you can't hear the person sitting across from you.  I went ahead with the brioche French toast. Wonderful! It was very flavorful which was a great spin on the classic item. I think one of my only complains is that it is a little pricey for the average brunch joint. Not really a problem, but I can't see myself frequently that often. With that said, it really was an enjoyable be to start a relaxing Sunday.",0.9955,0.727,0.232,0.041,0.5087027914614121

Granted, when I stop by I often come with a toddler or stroller (or both), so I don't help the cause, but I can think of a few ways (counterwise, doorwise, and restaurantwise) that they could re-allot their space so that people could shop at the bakery without getting in the way of folks coming to dine, and visa-versa.  That being said - the desserts are to die for. A fruit tart or some sort of ganache from here is worth looking forward to all day. Seeing how they aren't really kid-friendly from what I can telll, we find it easier to send one of us (hubby or I) in to purchase a delightful treat while the other waits outside. We will then devour it in the private of our own home. Not a bad arrangement (especially once we put the little one down, it is truly an enjoyable way to spend the evening). In the summertime, I have enjoyed a delish lunch here at their outdoor seating area (which I find logistically and aesthetically works best for them as a whole, esp being off of the plaza/square area with the fountain and all) .

So, I went back.  My husband and I tried weekend brunch later in the summer.  Food was very mediocre if not down right bland and I've had way tastier chilaquiles (try Tiztal on Clark in Uptown!).  We had to wait, as I expected - the place was packed - so I ordered a sf vanilla latte at the coffee bar.  We sat down 25 minutes later and I STILL didn't have my coffee!  First they didn't have the sf vanilla.  Fine, I'll just have the plain latte.  Then it was something about the milk.  My God, it's a coffee bar on a weekend!  How do you not have milk and syrup?!  When we sat down, I told the waiter we were waiting on a latte - he brought me brewed coffee.  Sent it back and 10 minutes later I FINALLY got my latte.  Which was tasty but by then I was just put off about the whole situation.  They did comp the drink so at least I didn't have to pay for it.  I also have to complain about the number of parents that frequent this place that really need to keep a better eye on their kids.  I know it's an outdoor patio - next to the Square - but that doesn't give you permission to allow your children to run wild screaming disrupting other people's meals.   My last visit, my husband and I went for a Friday night dinner.  Big mistake.  The portions were so small, my husband actually went home and made a bowl of oatmeal because he was starving.  He had ordered the chicken pot pie - it was kiddie size and WAY too creamy.  It had the consistency of paste.  I had the beef stew, which was marginally better, but I'd never get it again as it was served at room temperature, i.e. cold.  Our food was also served in a matter of minutes.  I know the stuff we ordered was probably made earlier in the day, and I don't expect restaurants to make-to-order beef stew and chicken pot pie.  But we received our food in under 10 minutes!  IMO, going out to eat is also about the experience not just the food.  Well, our experience start to finish was finished in under 35 minutes.  It was like going to a classed up and more expensive McDonalds.

I've been coming there on and off for nearly 10 years now and I think it's about time I share some of my thoughts. Starting off with the positive... - The pastries and cakes are amazing, they just are. I can't say a lot more than others because I'm not a sweets kinda guy so I don't really consider myself an expert in this arena as I so rarely partake.  - The ingredients are always fresh and I really give them a lot of credit for that. Everything I've eaten there always felt fresh and was well done. On the negative side... - The service blows, it just does, there is no way getting around it. They either have one or two servers for 20 tables (management's fault) or your server will be hanging out in back doing god know's what (you can see them from the side view) why you wait forever. Despite this I visit Selmarie about twice a year but it is the one place where I just hand the server my card and say ""run it"" because I hate asking for my check and then waiting 20 minutes for it and another 10 to get it back.  - Their portions suck. To be fair it never used to be this way, I think they feel like they are all fancy now since they have some Lincoln Square cred and the neighborhood is all up and coming. Now I'm a little guy and I don't eat much to begin with but I actually laughed when they brought our appetizers the other day. We ordered the goat cheese and lobster crêpes. It was a joke! They brought out a crêpe about the size of a small cigar for 4 people. Now I realize sometimes food is just small but when you order that your server should inform you. Besides, who wants to pay that much money for something that was just okay. It was like $2 a bite.  Anyway, at the end of the day Selmarie makes good fresh food but their service blows and they have an over-inflated view of themselves.

This is one of my favourite desserts to have in Chicago. Not too sweet, yet rich and flavourfui. What a concept. Incidentally, every German-speaking person I know assures me that bienenstich means 'bee sting' and not 'bee hive' as it is called at Selmarie.

We've been known to order the chilaquiles casserole, croissant sandwich, and breakfast burrito for brunch, the ravioli for dinner, and a slice of cake and coffee in between.  All delish.

Well, there happened to be live music playing outside that evening, and a table for two on the patio just opened - perfect, the romance meter just jumped! Little did we know, it was pre-fixe night - ooh joy! The overall everyday menu seems to focus on comfort foods, with macaroni and cheese being the front runner, as we saw it being served to many diners. We chose to go with the pre-fixe option - I had a simple salad, with a light vinaigrette, and pasta with sundried tomatoes, artichokes, olives, Parmesan cheese.... mmmm, nothing out of the ordinary, but prepared very well. My partner had the chowder to start, which had a broth base, as opposed to the favored creamy chowdah. For his main course he had the monkfish in a light cream sauce. I have never tasted monkfish prepared so delicate and flavorful, needless to say this was the star meal of the evening.  It was rounding towards closing time, so there was slim pickins for dessert, and you could tell they had been sitting in the pastry case for the day, as they were cold and did not have an abundance of flavor.  Overall it was a good meal, great company and a fantastic little gem of a Chicago evening with live music as our soundtrack. The service was wonderful, our server was so nice and sweet, she was spot on. We left a wee past closing time, as we got swept away by the romance of it all, and as we were leaving, there was no attitude that we had stayed beyond their hours, it was smiles all the way out as we floated into the Chicago evening.

When we got there around 1 for brunch, we were told around 20 minutes. 20 minutes came and went so i went up to the host stand to ask about our table. I could see into the restaurant and there were plenty of open tables! The hostess was also rude, and told me it would be another 15 minutes.  While we waited for our table, we hit up the sweet bakery. I got a chocolate croissant and my bf got some raspberry cookies with a coffee. I've searched high and low for a close replica of the chocolate croissants i got while in Germany, and i had yet to find one to even come close to being as delicious as they were. But this one was awesome! It wasn't as good as the ones in DE, but it was close enough. The Bakery is AMAZING. The cakes, cookies, and pastries all looked delicious for a carb lover like myself.... I was overwhelmed with choices! Eventually, we were seated outside and waited a couple minutes for someone to even come to our table. We were already ready to order when our server finally came to the table and she seemed annoyed that we were ready so quickly. But with over a half-an-hour wait, what would you expect? I ordered the Egg Sandwich on a Croissant without the vegetables and an English muffin. A minute or two later she comes back and tells me they're all out of the egg sandwich. I looked at her like WTH? I asked what exactly were they out of, eggs? Croissants?(Which i know they weren't, because i saw some in the bakery....) Cheese?! She said she didn't know, and would be right back. How can you know you're out of something and not know what it is? She comes back and tells me  they're out of the vegetables that go on the sandwich. I politely remind her that i asked for no vegetables on my sandwich. So she tells me that it wont be a problem. After that, i was just seriously annoyed. The food was good, nothing too special. Eggs were fluffy, and my bf liked his corned beef. His egg was a little weird, but other than that i only have 1 other complaint: no grape jelly. What is with all these places that have NO grape jelly?!?!?!?!?! Isn't grape jelly the standard?! I understand having strawberry, but blackberry instead of grape?! Seriously, breakfast/brunch restaurants, GET SOME GRAPE JELLY! Its a GRAPE idea! Ok, that was cheesy.

I'm very partial to their salads, and the warm, marinated goat cheese with mixed greens is a favorite of mine.  But the one I find myself wishing for -- it's a special, not a regular menu item -- is the Salad Lyonnaise which strikes just the right balances to make it a meal without being overwhelming.  Their mac and cheese or vegetarian chili are more likely to stick-to-your-ribs, and are great choices for colder weather.  The specials are always reliable, creative without being ridiculous.  Nobody is going to try to serve you foam here and tell you that it's a meal. Of course the baked goods are the real stars of the show, and even if you're not eating in, you can take home some amazing breads and pastries.  I was head-over-heels for their chocolate hazelnut dacquoise, for years, but I am now told it's only being made by order.  I am heart-broken over this and I hope they'll rethink their decision. But it isn't just the fancy pastries which satisfy.  Something as homely as their breakfast bun will send you into your day with a smile on your face and a feeling that you've done right by yourself.  Try it with a cup of their coffee. I can't even imagine not visiting this place on a regular basis even if the parking situation is becoming more dire by the day.  (Thank you Chicago, thank you so very, very much for this new parking outrage!)  It's worth the annoyance, in my opinion, and remains one constant bright spot in an ever-changing landscape of trendiness and yuppification.

My second visit confirmed my feelings about this place.  I just don't see how a mediocre pricey brunch place like this can survive in Chicago when their food isn't any better than diner fare.",0.9772,0.813,0.162,0.025,0.535363247863248

Because Lincoln Square really needs to look more like Lincoln Park, right? With chi-chi restaurants and chains! Hello Lincoln Square developers, Cafe Selmarie deserves to and needs to and should stay! It was there long before the neighborhood got trendy, and grew alongside that darling stretch of Lincoln Ave. Also, it's one of the few truly accomplished restaurants in the 'hood, but less spendy than Bistro Campagne. And, as I learned last night, it's a pretty great place to take small children.  The fear of Cafe Selmarie's demise is what drove my friend Shane and me to take our charges for the evening--2 year old Calvin and 3 month old Nora Claire--out to dinner. As someone who does not have children, I was nervous as hell to take such young ones to an establishment like Selmarie. But we went. The bus boy set us up on the charming patio overlooking the fountain, immediately outfitting us with a high chair. He also graciously helped me remove another chair for Nora's stroller. The kids' menu at Cafe Selmarie is great! They have everything from PB&J to chicken cutlets to penne pasta. Much to his delight, Calvin's grilled cheese sandwich, orange slices, and applesauce arrived with Shane and my chevre chaud salad. Oh, and did I mention that they put his water and milk in a cup with a lid and a straw? Brilliant!  Our chevre chaud salad was delicious, despite that at its arrival Nora decided she needed to cry. Shane and I took turns passing her across the table and alternating who spread the hot garlicky goat cheese on toast points for the other. Our waitress was very understanding and sympathetic, and I didn't correct her when she called me ""Mommy."" For our entrees, I had the wrap of the day, a tilapia wrap, and Shane had a grilled salmon salad. The tilapia was moist and wrapped up with a delicious slaw. It came with grilled potato wedges and broccoli. So healthy and delicious! Shane's salad looked great: a beautiful salmon fillet laying on a bed of interesting greens and fennel.  It was past the kiddies' bedtime (7:00!) so we took dessert to go. Calvin loved munching on his ghostie cut out cookie as we walked back to his grandparents' condo, and after the babes were in bed, Shane and I enjoyed our orange chocolate decadence (my all-time fave) and an ""impossible cake"" that had this amazing layer of flan on top while we watched ""Paris J'taime.""  As I sat on the patio, listening to the fountain, watching my fellow Chicagoans stroll by, eating my delicious wrap, rocking a (finally) sleeping Nora in her stroller, I felt a mixture of happiness and sadness, but not too much sadness.  I realized that I loved Lincoln Square, and Lincoln Square loved me.  Thanks, Cafe Selmarie, for 25 great years in a great neighborhood! May you flourish for at least 25 more!

And then we stopped. Because it's not that good. I'll leave others to review the dining experience. As a vegetarian, my options were typically limited to the same two less-than-tantalizing menu items (I don't eat fish, either). It's the bakery that proved most disappointing--and frankly I'm mystified by all the reviewers who say otherwise. If, like me, you view dinner as the means to dessert, you can't help but be lured by the confections on display in the bakery cases that dominate the cafe's entrance. Yet no matter what we ordered, it was always a let down, with the taste--dry and flavorless--never matching the delectable appearance. ""How can you screw up cake?"" we kept asking ourselves. ""Did they forget to add the butter?"" Sure that we had chosen poorly, or been served a stale slice, we kept going back expecting different results. But it was always the same. We recently received a gift certificate to the cafe from a neighbor, who I'm sure thought she was doing us a favor. So we were compelled to give the place one more try. As I was halfway through my piece of flourless chocolate cake, I wondered why I was still eating it, when it essentially had all theh flavor of cardboard. I've had better pastries at IKEA--seriously.

I like their restraint in preparing what is usually a major calorie bomb; which allowed me to order a side (or as we say in Chicago,) a ""rascher"" of bacon.

And so, deciding to save a fancier brunch place for better company in the coming weeks, I headed up to Selmarie this morning to offer  it one last opportunity to impress me. My wait at 10:30 was only about 15 minutes, which surprised me on such a beautiful late summer weekend. The hostess, who referred to me by name every time she addressed me (big points!), thanked me for waiting and led me to my table outside, overlooking Lincoln Square's Giddings Plaza, the epicenter of my Maclaren-pushing, NPR-listening, LL Bean-wearing neighborhood. My server, Jim, was lovely to behold and gave me plenty of time to peruse the menu before I ordered. By the time he returned with my coffee and mimosa -- with a splash of Triple Sec, garnished with a fresh strawberry -- I was ready to bite the bullet and order my chocolate banana griddle cakes. Jim assured me it was OK to indulge; it was Sunday, after all. Yes, good boy. To put this lightly, my meal made me rethink all my grievances with Selmarie. Thick and perfectly cooked, studded with miniature chocolate chips and topped with perfectly ripe, fresh-sliced bananas. Smothered in hot melted semi-sweet chocolate. Sweet Jesus, those pancakes could have ended a war. I...couldn't stop eating. The clinking of silverware, the sounds of shrieking children playing outside the restaurant's patio faded away. Just me and the pancakes. I caught a couple across the patio looking at me intently for a moment; I smiled and went back to eating. They apologized for intruding and told me they knew exactly what they'd be ordering next time they came -- the happiness on my face was a living advertisement for whatever it was I'd ordered, they said. ""It's crrrrrrrazy good!"" I replied. And went back to it. Jim checked up on me a few times throughout the meal. He even brought me some extra bananas to garnish what was left of my pancakes. I wanted to take him home with me for spoiling me so. My self control got the best of me, and I stopped with a few bites left. The melted chocolate had congealed over what remained of the pancakes, and I was ready to keel over and die anyway. I lazily finished my coffee and mimosa, basking with my book in a brunchy afterglow and never feeling rushed to give up my table.

It was heaven. We sat at the counter and with our little pile of delights and well done tea, it outshone the Ritz! Literally. We had afternoon tea at the Ritz the day before and that was overpriced and underwhelming...Selmarie spur of the moment was delightful! So Mom loved the place and wanted to come back for breakfast the day of her flight. We only had an hour before we had to bring her to the airport but that should have been enough, right? Wrong.

Our waiter kept looking at us, making eye contact, and then scurrying away before anyone could ask what was going on. We even waved him over and he ignored us. He finally came over, offered a coffee refill (ignoring the tea people) and then turned and walked away so fast I'm not sure if he even heard us asking him to wait. Stop! Please! Hey! Hello! Yeah, it was that weird. 35 minutes went by with nothing and the clock just kept on ticking. We asked another server (placing food at a table who had just arrived ten minutes earlier to get our waiter). When he finally showed up he said our food would just be four minutes more.  No apology. No explanation. Nothing. He went to walk away again. Incredulous, we asked to see the manager and we watched our waiter continue to serve food to other tables before getting the manager. He kept acting busy (really it was a few tables) and rushing around before the manager ever came out.  By this time we had our coats on.

The strawberry roulade and the raspberry custard tart are two of the most perfect baked treats I've ever had.  I also came once for breakfast and had blueberry pancakes that were to die for.  I do have a couple problems with this place, as much as I wanted to give it five stars just for the pastries.  1) It is packed at breakfast and we waited 40 minutes for our food (pancakes!) And our server never even checked on us.  2) I ate here for dinner once and the prices were more appropriate for a more gourmet restaurant.  3) recently I was buying a raspberry custard and couldn't find my visa. I realized I had left in in the atm. The girl helping me didn't care at all. She didn't even fake it. She just smiled awkwardly and was like ""okay"" and took my bag with the beautiful custard back. A cute local bakery should be able to just give you the damn thing at that point, and know that you'll be back. Anyway, I usually don' t like the service I here.

The weather cooled off quite a bit so we didn't sit outside. Inside was nice, but not overly crowded. Unfortunately we usually catch up and occasionally discuss the book more frequently than we talk about our food. Needless to say I never heard anyone complain about what they got and we all pretty much cleaned our plates so I will take that as a good sign.  I had one of the specials, a seared ahi wrap with a citrus chutney and creamy chipotle dipping sauce served over sweet potato fries. The wrap was quite good, but I think it could have been better if: (1) the ahi was cut into smaller pieces, I felt like I was eating bitefuls of either fish OR chutney, not a nice mix of both like it should be and (2) some of the dipping sauce should have been on the wrap - every time I dipped my wrap the chutney would fall out making it very messy to eat.  The sweet potato fries were cut thick, almost like steak fries; they were more like seasoned, sliced baked sweet potato than fries, but were pretty good. Our server was very attentive, always there to make sure we were doing ok and fill up our ice tea's, etc. without hovering. It seems from the reviews I've read the place is known for breakfast and its baked goods.

Its outdoor patio spills into the square and the tranquility of the place has deteriorated temporarily while construction of yet another set of condos takes place nearby.  The café has a very European feel; from the bustling waiters to the cozy indoor space.  I feel the food is a little overpriced given the portion size, but perhaps it goes with the typically European concept of quality over quantity.   It is often crowded which may lead you to believe that it's a very, very special place to eat.  I fell for this and we ate here for my 27th birthday.  That meal might have been the moment when I realized Café Selmarie really ain't ALL that, although we did have fun at the German festival afterwards.  I love stopping by this place on my way to the El in the mornings and getting the ""Selmarie Morning Bun"".  It is such a scrumptious cinnamon roll - devoid of excessive sugar and frosting but overflowing with flavor from some refreshing secret ingredient.  It's the perfect substitute to the pedestrian doughnut.",0.9851,0.86,0.132,0.008,0.47182539682539687

I made reservations here for brunch at 1:30 for my entire family (a party of 7).  Per my childhood days and the great reviews on Yelp, I was excited to come here because the menu looked so good! (Please note the use of the word ""looked"".) We got there early (a little after 1pm) and the ""hostesses"" were quick to tell us that they would 'do everything they could to try to get us seated early.'  OBVIOUSLY, that was a lie. (Please keep in mind that there was an open table for 6 when we got there.  Another chair could have easily been brought to the table to accomodate one more.) Around 1:20, one server told us that the party whose table we would be occupying was in the process of paying and would be leaving shortly.  By 1:40, they still hadn't left.  When asked about the status of our table, the hostess said that the party was paying, but just sitting there.  Ok?  And...? (Also, please keep in mind that I was with 2 children, one 3 year old and one 2 year old.  They were obviously HUNGRY at this point.  Who wants to starve children?) Again, we asked about the status of the 6 person table and why we could not sit there.  Apparently, the hostess had concern about the extra chair 'blocking' the way for the servers.  Couldn't they have put the chair on the OTHER side then, so that it wouldn't be in ANYONE'S WAY? Also, there were 2 tables of 4 that were open at the same time.  (4+4 = 8, right?)  I mean, if they did simple math, they could have realized that we could have sat at those tables, too.  Genius! All the hostesses could offer us were words of, ""I'm so sorry.  We can't make them leave."" :giggle, giggle, ha,ha: (I don't know why they were laughing because I OBVIOUSLY was NOT amused.) Really?  I remember being at (nice) restaurants where the hosts have politely asked us to leave as another party was waiting for our table.  We would always oblige as we were DONE and satisfied with our meal. My family ended up leaving as the kids were incredibly hungry at this point.  I came back to speak with the ""so-called' manager who REALLY did NOT offer up any value-added information, except for ""I'm so sorry.""  I also did not appreciate her fake, sugary sweet attitude.  I don't need that from you, honey!  Please don't patronize me. She did NOT EVEN OFFER any type of comped ANYTHING (a cookie, even!) to compensate for our dissatisfaction.  Great customer service. Granted, I wouldn't have taken it, but an offer would've been nice. Oh, I also have to mention a time back in 2006 when my sister and I came here in the afternoon.  Or tried to anyway.  We came to the door and it was locked.  We stood outside to read the restaurant hours and one of the employees unlocked the door to let a customer out.  However, although the employee CLEARLY saw us standing there, they didn't seem to mention anything about being closed.  (It was the middle of the EFFIN' day and we were there during an hour of operation.  It was locked because......?)

2007-03-19,5.0,"So. I keep thinking about reviewing Selmarie. But I don't. Because I work there. And I know from the talk threads about how people feel about reviewing your workplace. So I will make it very clear. I WORK HERE. I AM BIASED. I also hesitate because one of my managers (Hi, Anne!) reads Yelp on a fairly regular basis. We currently have a list of all our good reviews hanging in the front window. Say nice things, and you could be up there too. But in all seriousness. I really, really like Selmarie. I eat here every day. Not necessarily because I want to, but because it's there, and I kind of have to. I'll give you a rundown of items as they come to me. Sorry in advance for the length and the vegetarian slant. Menu: *Veggie Chili: excellent. *Salads: good in general. The pear salad is only served as a special. It's my favorite. Order it. But leave me one. *Sweet Potato Fries: hands down favorite thing on the menu. I love sweet potatoes. I love chipotle dip. *Grilled Cheese: Jaime makes the best. Get multigrain bread, and add tomatoes and avocado. Yum. *Soups: delicious and often vegetarian. My favorites include: butternut squash, pumpkin, sweet potato, tomato bisque (ask for croutons), tomato florentine. There's a lot of non vegetarian ones that I haven't tried, but I'm sure they're good too *Mac & Cheese: tasty. Many different cheeses. This ain't blue box. *Quiche: goodness. Get the Italian veggie with sundried tomatoes. But again, save me some. *Breakfast Burrito: second favorite thing on the menu. I wish I worked more mornings so I could eat this more often. *Breakfast Potatoes: come with burrito. Add to the deliciousness. *French Toast: get the one with the berries. It was the most amazing french toast I've ever had. Honestly. Desserts (I work at the counter, and if you ask, I will be honest, but here I'll just list my favorites, in no particular order): *Sacher Torte (say it with me: soccer): I explain what this is about 80 times a day. But it's still my favorite. *Raspberry Marzipan Torte: mmm, marzipan. *Tiramisu: so, so, so good. *Tres Leches: dripping with condensed milk and sweetness. *Strawberry Roulade (say it with me: roo-laud): sweet and light and fruity. *Mixed Fruit Tart/Raspberry Custard Tart/Raspberry Chocolate Tart: I'm a fruit addict. All fresh. All delicious. The Rasp. Chocolate is sinful. *Morning Bun: the lemon glaze gets me every time. *Chocolate Mousse Torte/Raspberry Bavarian Torte: the first time I had these, I wasn't too thrilled. Recently I tried them again, and have honestly been converted. Both are amazing. *Spanish Almond Torte: mmm, more marzipan, and apricot preserves. Cookies (all excellent, again, my favorites): *Kolachkys, Apricot Circles, Raspberry Hearts, Raspberry Almond Tartlets, Florentines, Wedding Cakes, Rugelah, Oatmeal Chocolate Almond Coconut, Sugar Cookies. So, yeah. It's ALL good. You really can't go wrong. I, of course, get sick of it all. That's only because I look at it/have it every day. But you don't work there, so you won't. Edit: I guess there's some question as to Selmarie's reservation policy. We *DO* take reservations. But *only* for parties of 6 or more. Except for weekends, you probably won't need one anyway. If you are desperate for something Selmarie, and don't have 6 people, call ahead when you're on your way. We will kindly put you on the list.",0.9994,0.716,0.246,0.038,0.6304417544261293
2007-03-19,2.0,"I have been meaning to try Cafe Selmarie for months and finally went.   Didn't know what time it opened and actually arrived early so we were seated right away.  Within 20 minutes of the restaurant opening, it was packed and there was a line.  (This will deter me in the future.)   The boyfriend and I aren't too fancy when it comes to breakfast.  We usually just like eggs and potatoes with some meat.  So the menu looked a little too fancy for us.  We ended up both getting the breakfast burrito.  Neither of us liked it and ate less than 1/2.  The waiter didn't seem to care that we hadn't touched our food and handed us our bill.  Not a big deal but it would take some convincing to get me to go back.  Or maybe I will try lunch as long as I know there won't be a crazy line.  (Walked by later at 1pm and there was an hour wait!) Also, if you don't like kids you probably shouldn't live or frequent Lincoln Square.  And places like this restaurant are reasons why!  Although almost all of the babies and tikes at Selmarie were well-behaved yesterday, there were a lot of them!  Didn't make a difference to us but I know some people don't like going to places with kids around.",0.9556,0.901,0.09,0.008,0.4045518207282914

2006-10-23,4.0,"I've been picking up pastries or ordering takeout lunch from Selmarie for a couple of years, but I only recently went there for brunch.  What was a strong like before turned into love after tasting three of their brunch menu items.  The interior of the dining room is bright and lively, and if it's warm, you can sit outside with a view of the nearby fountain.  I had the breakfast burrito, which was delicious.  My friend had a mushroom? bread pudding that was rich and decadent and we also split the cinnamon orange french toast, which was good but not extraordinary.  The mint and pomegranate mimosas were definitely unique, but started to get  a little too minty halfway through.  Between the atmosphere, breakfast food, and the delicious pastries, cookies and cakes they serve, I have to say Selmarie is pretty sweet.",0.9962,0.67,0.33,0.0,0.6685185185185185

2006-09-12,4.0,"The Sunday brunch at Cafe Selmarie is a mix of the commonplace and the cosmopolitan. The Mediterranean tart with carmelized onions, artichokes, olives and goat cheese (there was more, but I can't remember it) doesn't sound too good - especially when you figure in the topping of blackberry sauce - but it all works, and it was delicious. My roommate had the more traditional eggs and bacon, which looked solid, and bonus to the bacon for being less strips and more slabs. The staff was also quite friendly, but the atmosphere was a little to modern-art-museum-y to be a restaurant. Still, it looked good, and the desserts up front looked even better; the place offered a macadamia nut tart that looked like it might kill you three bites in, which would be the equivalent of being strangled by Maria Bello mid-coitus.

Cafe Selmarie has European-style baked goods, and the line here for weekend breakfast and brunch is, as you'd expect, outrageous.  But their selection of salads (greens with goat cheese, chopped salad, usw.), sandwiches (roasted portabella, smoked turkey and brie, croque monsieur, etc.) and pizzas are just as good.  It's a dilemma.  Most items, even for dinner, are under $10, and they have beer & wine.   I love it most as a place to go with a friend for a nice wedge of cake, served with a cup of their good coffee.  It's bustling here, but you can have a conversation without having to shout, too.",0.8939,0.844,0.12,0.035,0.6666666666666666
