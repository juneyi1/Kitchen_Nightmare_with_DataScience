The real draw is the pasta dinner for two. It's under $50 and you get 2 meals each out of it.  Marco's Meal for Two Choose any Appetizer or Flatbread or Two Side Salads Choose Two Classic Pastas Choose One Dessert Plus Two Classic to Take Home! I like the atmosphere and environment here. Their pasta is good (minus their fettuccini - I wasn't impressed). Their Chicken  Parmesan and spaghetti and one giant meatball are my favorites. Their lasagna is also good. In terms of drinks, their sangria is weaker but flavorful and we had two pitchers of the red sangria during our girls night. As far as brunch is concerned, they really out did themselves. Their lemon ricotta pancakes are insanely good and fluffy. Their crab benedicts make my mouth water just thinking about them.

I find the gin and tonic's here, very refreshing. My favorite dish is the basic baked ziti, I love it. I hate to say that this time here, my server was not very good.

2017-06-30,5.0,"So a little story before i go into details.  My boyfriend and I have been wanting to go eat and he suggested pasta places to go eat. We were right around the Trump hotel because our first suggestion was this place across the trump hotell. We were in briefly to check the menu and ' alfredo pasta ' was not there, so we left onto another restaurant. There was a place right across the place we were previously at and so we check at the place, the menu of course and we did not see alfredo pasta. At the point, we were already burnt out and tired from all this walking since we walked from the bean which isn't really far, but it was pretty hot.  After stopping at two pasta places, my boyfriend simply typed in ' alfredo pasta ' into google hoping for a suggestion. We were so tired and I said ' this is our last chance, if it does not go right, we're cooking. "" So, we popped into Maggiano;s and of course, i asked nicely for the menu. The server/host gives me the menu and finally, we are so happy and thrilled. My boyfriend literally smiled through his whole excitement, it made me so happy honestly.  At this point, I'm relieved because the inside of the building is so fancy, and EVERY TIME i go to a italian restaurant with the exception of Olive Garden, my boyfriend and I drop into one of those fancy places, but like we aren't even dressed up not knowing how it is. So, we go in there really casual, i mean it's a nice day out, so :)  Anyways, as we sat down, we had two different servers and the reason is because one was leaving, so someone else took care of us. But the first one made sure we were comfortable, asking if we needed anything to start off with. Someone from the kitchen brought bread for us to chow down on, which was pretty fresh and good! :)  After being served bread, i took forever to make my decision and my boyfriend obviously wanted his pasta ( alfredo ) w/ shrimp. I'm more of a marinara person, so i ask about the soup for the day and the new guy, Jake describes it, and i got it. Tasted pretty good ( clam chowder ), their version is red on that day, but i don't know about the other days. So i order my pasta and i was so happy, it tasted so good, and we even had dessert.  Before I go on about my dessert, it was buy a pasta, take one home. Basically, buy one, get one free and we took all the food home that we couldn't finish in addition to what they gave us for free. Alright, time to spark up this story. I mean, how do you eat lunch/ dinner, idk, we got dessert even though we were filled to the extreme. My boyfriend got some like chocolate-cake truffles/ balls, they're white chocolate if I'm not mistaken and I got a spark of their creme brulee. I love creme brûlée, i would have it any day. After paying for our thing, our server came and still asked if we needed anything, when we were done. 10/10 service. After this, their manager came up to us and greeted us. Wait, before i continue, the server greeted us welcoming us, since it was our first time there. So, let me continue my story. The manager gave us little coupons and asked us about the food and experience and other locations they have around a few different states. Lovely!  The service, food, people, everything. I would rate this place higher if possible ! 11/10!  :)  well done, thank you so much! :)",0.9995,0.751,0.232,0.016,0.6129820179820181

I never got a chance to their food but it's okay, there's lots of places that will gladly    provide great service.. oh and btw for  being ""a fancy restaurant"" please make sure you wash your glassware and utensils property as they looked dirty!

They serve all the Maggiano's staples, but in the banquet hall, seems like the quality goes down in the mass production of food. Everything is mediocre, from the salads to the cookies.  That said, I really like the event space. Dark wood everywhere and a large room that can seat probably up to 200. The bathroom is upstairs, which is inconvenient, but it's clean, kinda fancy, and has lots of mirrors (thought that would be a plus if you're having a wedding reception here). There are a couple of bar areas off to the sides of the entrance, which is nice. Overall, a good option if you're looking for a traditional event space, and don't care too much about the food being off-the-charts.",0.8056,0.803,0.121,0.076,0.5811287477954145

Our waitress was Katie in the lounge area and I do not think either of us have ever had a better waitress. Katie had great recommendations, and such a positive attitude. She made the meal a whole event for us and truly made us feel welcomed. Because of her she has started a new tradition for us for date nights. As far as the food (which is why everyone is going there obviously) each course got better and better. We chose to do the Marcos meal which was a great deal, an appetizer, two classic pastas(which we did the five dollar upgrade for chicken parm for one entree), a dessert and then two pastas to take home! We started with the chicken and roasted pepper flat bread which we could have made a meal out of alone, then the chicken parm was delicious but what really stood it was the mushroom ravioli. It was recommended by Katie and the couple next to us who have made it a tradition to return (from Portland) just to this Maggianos for this ravioli. We ended the meal with the tiramisu that was super light and worth cramming in our tummys. As you can tell I have nothing but great things to say about this restaurant, and it's because it is very well deserved.

It was a glorious return to form. I had the gnocchi with Italian sausage, the crispy zucchini fritte, and the chocolate zuccotto cake.  It was way too heavy, too rich, and too good for me to come back here regularly, but while I was sitting inside the restaurant I was very happy.  (Naturally, the doggie bag thing is still a thing here.) With so much good Italian in Chicago, it's hard to imagine making this a regular occurrence, but for one night, it was fun rolling back down memory lane.  Next time, though, I'm doing family style, especially if it's still the same deal--two dishes each from the five major sections (apps, salads, sides, entrees, desserts).  I miss being able to eat everything in sight, but when you hit your 40s, the portion size thing is a thing!",0.9592,0.859,0.113,0.028,0.3594667409884802

Their service was very, very mediocre, our food wasn't ready by the time they said it would be and I had to wait about 8 extra minutes for it. No thank you, or any words except for ""sign here"" for the credit card receipt. Also, keep in mind, they carry out section is completely separate from the actual Maggianos restaurant. So when I walked into the actual restaurant, since it was my time, I walked in and nobody came to seat me or acknowledged me until I walked over to the bar after a couple minutes and the bartender, in a rush (even though there were no other customers at the bar) told me that I'm in the wrong place and I have to go around from outside, make a left and then it'll be the next door to my left. Once again, very, very mediocre service. Because of all this, I will probably refrain from ordering takeout again unless it is just chicken parm, but their service and timing is not that great.

2016-12-01,5.0,"Better than good.  My compliments to the chef and everybody that made my meal memorable. I haven't been to this Maggiano's in a long long time, so far back I don't even remember when I was here last. I think it's because there's been such a proliferation of new restaurants in this area that I have a tendency to overlook the older establishments in favor of the newer hipper kid(s) on the block. Which in hindsight have been either a hit or miss for me. So when I reluctantly went to this place last night, I didn't have high hopes.  I thought it would be tired, have lower food quality and sluggish service, in other words, not as good as it use to be.  So much for my bias!  Which is a shame because this place still serves excellent tasting Italian food at reasonable prices considering the quality.  I say reasonable in the sense they don't stint on the ingredients, everything here is first-rate.  Funny I ended up here because originally I was going to eat at Bub City but they were so crowded and noisy I decided to go here instead.  Maggiano's at the time I went, around 8PM on a Wednesday night was more quiet, comfortable and spread out, so I knew I could have a peaceful meal all to myself without bumping elbows.  I had just come from one of those long drawn out focus groups and I was literally starving to death, so at that point I was ready to eat the table, that's how hungry I was.  I also remembered that they had good lasagna and tiramisu on past visits.  The moment I walked in I was surprised it had a good vibe, the greeter was cheerful and very accommodating and let me sit wherever I wanted.  I sat on the bar side only because there weren't as many people there as in the main restaurant.  Plus it wasn't cramped and lo and behold they had those old leather banquettes!  Talk about comfortable. This time though I ordered the chicken saltimbocca, which I had never tried before.  But as luck would have it I got the *wrong order, instead I received a dish called chicken francese, which turned out to be a blessing in disguise, it was simply sublime.  The chicken was topped with a light parmesan crust & lemon butter sauce and came with crispy vesuvio potatoes and a side order of linguini.  Honestly words can't describe how delicious this whole meal was...it was that good.  Let's just say it was lick the plate good...although I literally had to restrain myself from making a fool of myself in font of the whole restaurant!  BTW, I also ordered their spinach salad, suggested by Nick my unobtrusive server.  Now that's a delicious salad in and of itself, it comes with pine nuts, crispy Applewood smoked bacon, red onions and a nice splash of balsamic vinaigrette.  Tasty. I think the real reason I enjoyed this meal so much was because I hadn't eaten for several hours, my stomach was past empty, plus it was extremely cold and damp outside.  All which conspired to rev up my appetite even more.     No dessert this time, but definitely will order the next time when I'm by this way again. This was a great meal! *Nick offered to buy me a glass of wine the next time I go there because of the mix-up.  Thanks Nick.",0.9919,0.782,0.138,0.08,0.5332356124267889

The wait staff was attentive, knowledgeable and available when needed, but not over bearing.   The appetizer was amazing.  The Panzerotti it was like Italian empanadas.  The exterior was perfectly crispy and was well balanced with the cheesy, saucy interior.  The sauce was fresh tasting not likely pre-made or out of a can.  Highly recommended. I had the Linguine De Mare.  It was overall prepared very well.  The pasta was perfect.  The sauce was amazing, a bit spicy which I loved.  The lobster and some of the mussels were a bit overcooked.  Not bad, but worth noting.  My wife had the Shrimp Fra Diavol.  It was perfect the flavor was amazing, perfectly blended and rounded.  Everything was perfectly cooked.  The fresh in house pasta was perfect and the shrimp was done exactly as it should be. The lemon cookies are dynamite.  Worth trying without question.  Light enough to eat even after a big meal, but still fulfilling.",0.9978,0.646,0.335,0.019,0.6068137254901962

I highly recommend the Pomegranate Martini and the sausage and pepperoni flat bread. I love that the flatbread had an extra thin crust.

The service.  Our server was fine.  Nice and fairly attentive.  My biggest complaint was a photographer that was walking around.  I really don't know how to describe this.  It was like the photographer at an amusement park trying to sell you a souvenir photo.  A woman came by with a camera and asked if we wanted a group photo.  She said it was free about 4 different times, which is a red flag right there.  After her very long and obnoxious monologue, we agreed.  We had a large group of about 15 so she took a group photos and then some smaller photos of the couples.  The whole thing took way to long, like 5 minutes.  It was very distracting.  Then she comes by at the end of the meal with the  group photo and individual photos.  She says the group photo is free and the individual ones are $15.  I really have no idea what this was about.  It was tacky, uninvited, rude, and distracting.  This is something I would see at a 4 year olds birthday party.  Not at a restaurant that I'm guessing is trying to be fine dining.  There was nothing fine about this.  Just so tacky.  Not necessarily because they were charging for the photos, just the whole thing in general.  We couldn't get her away from our table fast enough.  It really was one of the most bizarre things that's happened to me at a dinner.  It left an awful impression.",-0.905,0.791,0.091,0.118,0.5058629148629149

We arrived for lunch and were immediately sat in a big comfy booth (with reservations of course). Now for the food: We started off with the caprese. It was good. The mozzarella was good and the tomatoes weren't cut too thick. It was drizzled with some sauce, I think white balsamic vinaigrette. My husband said it was too sour, but I like a little bit of tang. I always order a side of kalamata olives with caprese. I had the salmon ceasar salad. The salmon was cooked perfectly, but I always request for my salmon to be cooked at about medium rare to medium. Overcooked salmon is the worst. The ceasar dressing was good, but I'm not sure if that's what I ate that was chock full of garlic. My husband had the margherita flatbread. He said that it was just ok. Our little one had the cheese ravioli. She devoured it. I had a hard time trying to decide if I should give 3 or 4 stars. The food was good. Nothing really spectacular.

Last weekend, we were looking for a place to eat before the band started at Blue Chicago.  This is one of the choices that popped up on Yelp, and since it's just across the street, we chose it.  Had no trouble getting a reservation the same day. The crowds must have moved on to trendier places. It had been years since I'd eaten here, and I was happy to discover they still serve good Italian food.  I started with my old favorite, the Maggiano's salad: crispy prosciutto, blue cheese, red onion and a slightly sweet dressing... I'd forgotten how great it is.  Followed it with the mussels Tuscan style.  The mussels were plump and perfectly cooked, but the broth would have benefited from more seasoning.  (Soaked up the broth with the non-focaccia Italian bread.) My friend, a light eater, had one of the flatbreads (a meal by itself), plus the gnocchi and Italian sausage in a tomato vodka cream sauce.  I had several bites of the gnocchi, and it was heavenly.  We split the six lemon cookies, just as light and lemony as I'd remembered them.  The coffee was pretty good, too.  What wasn't so good was our server.  He was efficient, but so detached it bordered on unfriendly... not at all like the staff you almost always find at a Lettuce restaurant.  Now that that this restaurant isn't so crowded, I'm definitely returning.  There are now lighter versions of some of the standard dishes (complete with calorie count), which look interesting.

In arriving to check in one of the other attendees Barb asked me if I was nisei (2nd generation Japanese/American) to which I responded I am Sansei (3rd generation Japanese/American).  Then she asked me about Manzanar which is a one of the camps where the Japanese/Americans were incarcerated during World War II.  I told her my cousin Cory produced and directed a film called ""The Fisherman of Manzanar"".  As it turns out she knows my cousin, WOW what a small world.  We went to Maggiano's in River North to attend a dinner seminar on financial planning which proved to be very informative and raised enough concerns about our current plans to raise questions.  The presenter Mary was very informative and gave information that made us want set up a future meeting with her to discuss our current plans. After the presentation they served us a family style dinner which consisted of a house salad, meat lasagna, breaded parmesan encrusted tilapia w/spinach, mushroom ravioli al forno, chicken piccata.  For dessert they had tiramisu & profiteroles.  All in all it was a great presentation with a very good meal with some very enjoyable dinner companions",0.9204,0.897,0.078,0.025,0.36977272727272725

It's really well-appointed and above my standards, but they make it very clear that they're happy to have me there. Some restaurants are upscale too, but they're trying to be exclusive...

I prefer being greeted warmly whether I'm in a 3-piece suit from work or in jeans and a Cubs hat because I've been running around the city all day. Maggiano's does that. And they play Sinatra-style music all day, which is another bonus. The food is amazing comfort-style all-day kind of cooking, their pasta is phenomenal, and the veal is excellent - their portions are enough for at least two meals, so expect leftovers. It's not a diet place by default (though it can be if you try, and they are very helpful with any dietary modifications), so expect to leave happy & full. They have career-waitstaff, so everyone seems like they've been there for years and can offer suggestions on what appetizers go best with the entrees, what wines go well with whatever...

With that, we left for Wisconsin and drove all day, me trying to conceal my excitement and my nervousness the whole time.

Last week I attended a City Club of Chicago luncheon here, with Chicago Public Library library commissioner Brian Bannon as the featured speaker. From the looks of the fliers distributed on the round tables, it seems like many of the City Club's lunchtime speakers are hosted at Maggiano's. Having not been here before, I was uncertain what to expect. What struck me the most is all of the dark wood reminiscent of a bordello or pre-Prohibition drinking establishment. I appreciated that there was a place to put my coat right away, and that the check-in process was seamless. It was easy to find my assigned seat, although it would have been nice to have been able to order a beverage (iced tea or diet coke) so that I could stay alert. The dishes were served family-style. Standouts were the stuffed mushrooms and salad. In fact, I probably could've gotten by on just this and bread. The veal entree was over salted (and I am a fan of salt) and the ravioli dish somehow managed to be simultaneously gummy and undercooked. I did appreciate the dessert setup, coffee and a plate of cookies, as it was good not to have to face down a dessert plate while trying to take notes, especially with the speaker coming on after lunch. I was able to see the slide presentation, even though I was near the back of the room. The acoustics were decent, and I even noticed some television cameras filming. I was decidedly less focused on the dining experience than I would have been during a typical restaurant outing, but found the offerings overall sufficient and the service unobtrusive. My only quibble is that I wish the plates had been cleared a bit more swiftly - certainly in between courses and after food service was done- but that is a small nit to pick considering the size of the event.",0.9657,0.901,0.09,0.01,0.45355673133450913

I like the atmosphere (upstairs), and the classic Frank Sinatra music in the background. The bad: The food was pretty mediocre. Again, I've had a hard time finding a good Italian restaurant. Maggiano's is overpriced in my opinion. Besides the dessert, I wasn't wowed by the taste. We tried a few different dishes, one being the chicken piccatta. I thought the chicken was way too dry, and the pieces were pounded down to the point that it was like cardboard.  Our room had a ton of pillars, so it was hard to see.

I'm just gonna go ahead and get straight to the main point - if you order a classic pasta, they give you another order (doesn't have to be the same classic pasta) to take home. It's like a fancy Olive Garden!! We came in around 5 because it was a work dinner and it was pretty empty. However by the time we left, it was already crowded! Impressive, considering it was a Wednesday.  We started with the calamari and bruschetta. Calamari was very well seasoned and crispy. It was very tasty but could have used a higher squid-to-breading ratio. Not bad though.  I ordered the Chef Mann's country style pasta and boy was the size seriously for a Mann! (Capital M). I'm a sucker for hand twisted noodles and these were very chewy and perfect for the lighter (than alfredo or marinara) white wine sauce. The shape had little pockets to collect the milder sauce. I obviously doused it in red pepper flakes but the little bits of sun dried tomatoes were a lovely kick of flavor every time I bit into them! They really shined with a milder sauce. I grew up on Korean BBQ so I'm totally comfortable eating large chunks of cooked garlic (okay, I love it) but not everyone is alright with that. I will warn you- I found large pieces of garlic in this dish. Do NOT order this on a first date! Unless your man loves garlic. Or if it's a bad first date with a vampire! I did not like how the sausage in this dish was torn up into tiny oddly shaped pieces. Especially when the baked ziti next to me got sausage pieces that were like 4x the size!

It was my first time, and it will absolutely be my last time. It took a while for our food to come out, and once it did, both orders had issues. My friend is observing lent so she couldn't have meat today. Her pasta had chicken instead of shrimp, so we had to send it back. That wasn't the worst of it though. My salmon on my salad was SEVERELY undercooked. I am so happy that I went to cut the entire piece up before eating it, or I definitely would have taken a few bites before noticing and gotten sick. The waiter was apologetic, but when I tried to change my order because I didn't want to risk it happening again, he sort of brushed it off and still had it remade. It was fine the second time, but I was still a little put off from it. I was also frustrated that he didn't listen to my request to change my order. Everything that we asked or needed seemed to take longer than it should have. The waiter would make jokes to try to ease it, but it was still frustrating. Also, they didn't do anything in terms of compensation for the salmon issue. It obviously wasn't something that they had to do, but it would have shown good faith of an apology for serving me raw fish. It goes beyond a wrong order or timing issue - that is someone's health. The overall experience was really bad, and to be honest, the food was not good, regardless of the annoyances that came with the meal.

Maggiano's is what Leona's used to taste like in the early 1990's.  The dark tomato chunks and sauce in their baked rigatoni pomodori pasta seductively beckoned me closer... and the first nibble of the finely-herbed chicken sausage on top forced me to MOAN OUT the most x-rated utterance. Not a blink from Julie or the new trainee behind the bar, as they must be used to it.  I took another bite and slapped the beautiful dark wood bar top.  After tasting a few different reds, I settled on the 2011 J. Lohr Cabernet, which pairs perfectly with this dish. Julie carefully explained that this 6 oz. pour was more expensive than the others, but i PFFFFTTT'D when i saw that it was only $10 on the tab.  That's downright cheap for River North, baby.  The puffy clouds that sat near by is bread but could've floated on away as they were light, buttery and indeed ambrosia. You see... after strutting up Clark Street a few blocks, I sauntered right inside, past the slightly-bewildered valet guys and plopped right down to the bar. Julie asked if I was lunchin' and I said abSOTIVELY posiLUTELY. She reminded me that I also get a 2nd entree for free. So about $7.5 a piece and each comes out plentiful enough to feed about 3 people (OK 1.5 Mid-Westerners haha). I'm not anti-chain, but do it RIGHT! They dish up Flintstone-sized portions and the flavors are there.  Someone here in the office'd hotted up a cheesy Hamburger Helper type dish around 11am on this festive Friday and I made the mistake of walking through the pantry.  That pleasurably took me back to my poor Mississippi childhood, in which such moments would have been a treat.

The beef was lacking flavor, and the asparagus were dry, but the mashed potato was delicious. - Tiramisu. I like it a lot, I would say it's comparable to Buca di Beppo's tiramisu. I would go back and try other pasta dishes and appetizers.",0.992,0.709,0.235,0.056,0.5949074074074073
2013-04-07,3.0,"I'm a fan of Maggianos. Every now and then I get a craving for their basic spaghetti with meatballs. I don't know why, but I do. I guess it's just cuz I enjoy it.  My Mom likes coming here, and since there was a group of folks in from out of town (we had a table of 10) it seemed like a good place to come. They have room to seat us (unlike a lot of restaurants downtown where the quarters are tight and cramped) and they do the ""family style"" option of serving food.  Overall, I enjoy Maggianos food because i think their food actually has flavor, even the basic spaghetti/meatballs. A lot of restaurants, in my opinion, go too easy on the seasoning and so the food can be boring. Not here. Overall we've been to this location a few times, and the food is always consistent. They're always willing to work with you on tweaking your order to your liking, or maybe making something a little different. Last night we did the family stye and everyone loved everything ordered. The service last night was pathetic, unfortunately. But this is not the standard. It's usually better than it was. In addition, they charged us incorrectly (causing about a $50 difference on the bill) but once I pointed it out they were more than happy to fix it. They were HORRIBLE about refilling drinks last night. I was just drinking soda, and at one point sat for about 10-12 minutes with an empty glass and they were nowhere to be found to refill it. Tisk-tisk. Overall - i do usually really enjoy the food here. I'd probably suggest Maggianos out in Schaumburg more than I would downtown. To me, there are SO many restaurants to choose from when downtown that it doesn't make sense to hit a ""chain""restaurant like this. HOWEVER, with that being said - it WAS a good selection based on our need to seat a larger than average group. Personally, I wouldn't have chosen maggianos, but I was more than happy to come here and eat their delicious food. Oh and the bread. mmmm-mmmmm good.",0.9944,0.773,0.173,0.054,0.47922619047619053

Unfortunately, Maggiano's did not get the full 5 stars because we had a horrible waitress named Heather. She was rude to us for no reason (I am always very nice waiters/waitresses because I know how tough of a job it is!). She basically ignored us the entire time we were there. Ironically enough, the people seated at the table next to us had an amazing waitress who was kind, attentive, and accommodating. We actually ended up asking her for a few things when our waitress was nowhere to be found. Then when our waitress found out, she left in quite a huff to find ""that girl"", as she put it. Also, I ordered a latte after my meal which I never received. I was quite disappointed. By the time we left, she had neither remembered nor mentioned it.  The food was delicious- definitely the best Italian I've had in a while. The prices were moderate for an Italian place- pretty typical fare for great food. We had the 2 for 40 deal, which allows you to pick an appetizer, two simple pastas for entree, dessert, and 2 simple pastas for take-out. That's a lot of food for $40!! We had the chicken and green pepper flatbread (absolutely delicious), pesto ravioli, garlic aglio, and chocolate zuccatto cake. We also got the ravioli and spaghetti and meatballs to go. Everything was so good that it makes us to want to go back for more!! Our compliments to the chef, who did an amazing job with the food.

I went here a year ago for a work function, and the chef called me ahead of time as I have lots of food allergies, and we planned a menu. I arrived at the function and ate a delicious meal.  I went here last night, and the chef called me a couple of days ago, and he told me to let the staff know when I arrived so we could talk. I had to ask three different members of the waitstaff before someone actually came and got him. The first two people just totally blew me off. By the time I actually got to talk to him, he was clearly stressed as dinner was about to start and he had next to no time to make me a meal, and while what he made was tasty, I easily could have eaten four plates of it and still had room for the (non-existent) dessert I ordered. Seriously, how hard can it be to make a fruit cup?  I understand that this is the fault of the staff and not the chef, but I really expected more. While I've had good experiences here, it only takes one bad experience to really change your opinion on the place.  Overall: the chef is good at what he does, but the waitstaff is unprofessional and my experience was disappointing at best.

A mix of country bumpkin from Daddy's side and southern chic from my Mother's. Three vastly different groups, all of whom are skeptical of parking attendants, let alone new family members, nestled into one dining room.  What could go wrong?  Absolutely nothing, under the care of events coordinator, Dana! Laid-back until it's time to get down to business, Dana walked us through the menu at our initial tasting, smoothed over payments (sometimes the guy's family forgets these little details), and laughed off exact deadlines for selections and payments. The night of the event, she was there with her game face, ready to make sure my Godfather had his scotch, the centerpieces were all on the table, the groom's cake was displayed just so, and the bar was quite stocked.  Though our dining room was a little cramped (note to us and now you dear brides, booking the rehearsal dinner further than two months out would have been a smarter choice and left us with more room options), it made for getting up and talking to family and friends much easier.  The food was spectacular (brides, this isn't for you. You aren't eating the night before the wedding) with a salad, three appetizers, three courses and dessert. And wine. Lots and lots and lots and lots of wine. The southern belle in me insisted on keeping traditions with a groom's cake as the main dessert. Those not in the know- a groom's cake is a rich, decadent chocolate cake given to the groom and his family by the bride, and is usually a kitschy shape or design. Ours was our college mascot.

2012-10-02,3.0,"My review is totally based on a private dining event. I will be as specific as I possibly can be.  First let me start out that the booking process was great and they were able to accommodate a party of 25 with a weeks notice.  When we arrived for our 6 pm seating at 550, the tables were not set up, and they were in an odd formation. Basically you couldn't see all the tables in a row because one was off to a side.  Not normally a big deal but it was three tables over two small rooms it was just odd.  We requested the move the one table in line with the other two and told they couldn't as they would not be able to reach the folks against the window. Not really sure why that would matter we were eating family style.  Nonetheless one table was moved to sit between the two rooms and the third was accommodated. So now everyone can see each other. This was critical as we were in town for a team building event and not everyone ha been together during the day.  Onto the next issue. We had 2 servers and one waitress who did double duty as bartender. I gotta say this lady makes the best Cosmo I've ever had.  However everyone complained about her lack of something. J'nai sais quois.  When moving tables she told people they had to get up. Not please could I have you stand from the table - move  Seemed put out that we arrived early also.  So needless to say we all get situated and our last three MIA team members show up  And we start serving dinner at 620 ish. Some team members were starving. Nothing I can do about that, but we were expected at 6. The food -plentiful and very good. We started with bread and chopped salad and maggianos salad. House salad was truly delicious.  Apps were fried mozzarella and bruschetta. Wish their had been more mozzarella per table and that it had been warmer. It was room temp. Big party I didn't complain.  Next up was bow tie pasta, and penne with eggplant. The bow tie amazing. Perfectly al dente and tasty. The penne - whole grain ain't my thing but the eggplant was not my thing.  Followed by salmon with lemon and herb and chicken piccata.  Both delicious perfectly cooked consider the large team for dinner.  Desert was Nonna's chocolate cake which was one big ol' piece for the whole table  After one bite you can tell why !  Holy sambuca!  Yep sambuca in te cake. Not everyone cares for sambuca an it was a strong licorice flavor.  For the 2 nd desert we had profiteroles with vanilla ice cream and chocolate drizzle.  The profiteroles were a little stale but great desert option  So overall a really nice experience.

You can just tell that these ingredients are just low cost full of perservative and blahblah. I feel sorry for the people that cant notice this to btw. That being said, I live right by it and the way that they have carry out set up is really convenient and on a rare binge I will shamefully resort to maggianos.

I had a Lettuce Entertain You GC that I wanted to use, and when my GF suggested Maggiano's. I thought why not.  The first thing I noticed was that the Corner Bakery was gone, which is why now you now get a basket of basic ""Italian"" bread instead of an assortment of interesting fresh breads and crackers that you got in the 90s.  The bar server, who was very pro, explained: ""they got rid of the bakery and expanded the bar because the bar is more profitable"".  So a bit more bar profit is more important than really good bread?  This diner disagrees: booze is everywhere in this country, good bread is very hard to find.  The piano bar is...a...um, interesting addition to an Italian restaurant.  The chopped salad was large and tasty. The shrimp and rice thing was good, but I was a bit surprised to get like 16 shrimp and yet a 1/2 cup of rice...some more rice  would have been better.  Maybe the chef thought that less rice would make the shrimp look more abundant, not really, I mean there were over a dozen good-sized shrimp, which is fine.  Just add more rice already.  The service was good, but a bit green.  There is actually a deal here now where you get all this pasta to eat, and a second meal of pasta to take home.  I don't get that: is it cold, frozen, yesterday's???  They should remove that, because it makes their food look too cheap, like Olive Garden or something.  There were also some empty tables on the Friday night we were there; interpret that any way you want.  I think I'[ll leave Maggiano's for the tourists, and stick to Taylor St. and Melrose Pk.",0.9941,0.818,0.158,0.024,0.4884353741496599

We made a reservation around 7:30 on Friday via OpenTable for 8 the same night.  We got there about 10 minutes early and immediately started to get twitchy.  My stress level was just too high for a place like this that particular Friday night.  Waiting in the bar with women squealing at each other over their drinks, a man on my right acting like he's selling the after dinner mints, and a 5 year old on my left making some loud noise repeatedly, almost made me ask if we could leave.  And it was only 7:55 at this point.  At 8:10 we were told our table was ready.   The server seemed harried.  Also, his hair was a mess.  This made me giggle.  After almost dropping about 3 glasses he finally spilled my iced tea.  Not a big deal.  The fact that he yelped ""Oh God!"" when it happened was very amusing.  Poor guy.  I'd be a mess too if I was running around this place all night. The food was actually pretty good.  We started with sausage and peppers, they were very good.  The sauce they were served with had basil in it, a pleasant surprise.  I ordered the spaghetti with a really big meatball and meat sauce for my entree.  He had the lobster carbonara.  It was good.  I ate about 1/4 of my dish before finally giving up.  The server asked if we wanted dessert, we both said no we were way too full.  I asked to have my dish wrapped up to go.  He said ""No problem.  And what would you like for your second pasta?""  Faced with this question I could only return a quizzical look and ""second pasta?"".  He said ""yes, you get a second pasta to take home with you.  I suggest the baked something or other (I don't remember what it was), it's really good"".  I said ""sure"" (still sporting my quizzical look).   Now, the American in me thinks ""Lots of food for a low price! Score!!"".  While the healthy person in me thinks ""WTF (that stands for What The Fuck)!!!  No wonder so many people in this room are overweight!"".  Why are you giving away 4 servings of food to one person for $12.95?!  That's kind of ridiculous.  Why not just lower the price of the Classic Pasta's by half?  I'll gladly pay you $6.95 and only get 1 huge serving of pasta (which is enough for 2 people).  I realize this is a little crazy of me, but I really can't patronize an establishment that is contributing to the delinquency of the masses like this.  Before the whole ""second pasta incident"" we had been talking about how many overweight people there were in the restaurant (I'm talking obese here, not just a little chubby).  I guess now I know why: they can eat their weight in pasta for the low low price of $12.95.   The food was good, nothing you can't get from half the Italian restaurants in the city.  The service was just eh.  The ambiance is non existent.  And they are making it easy to be unhealthy.  No thanks, I'll pass on Maggiano's next time.",0.9434,0.82,0.106,0.075,0.5105415499533148

It was the food -- with the large menu, I consciously wanted to order something I did not have before, and found the baked rigatoni with chicken sausage to be a delight. The sausage was lean and somewhat spicy, and the pasta nicely cooked. Yet beyond the food, the service was outstanding. That really made the meal work well -- Chris, the server was particularly helpful with regard to timing, questions, and initiative. It really made me glad we came, even on what was a busy night at Maggiano's. Update (December 2012): The food is fine, but sometimes the service needs attention. Without listing problems, I advise customers to ask clearly for the service they want, since it can vary between the members of the staff. Perhaps management will improve the situation, but until then, it's important to take charge yourself. When the wrong item arrives, ask for the correct one. Unfortunately, one waiter responds to such things with a smart remark, and if that occurs, ask the manager for a different waiter.  Kudos to the reliable servers, whose efforts are solid",0.9906,0.747,0.208,0.044,0.5689836678473041

There were13 of us and we were here for my best friend's birthday party. Maggiano's told us that we have to go with their family style option since we have a party over 10, and we were fine with that. We selected the Classic option (~$27.95/person). I would have to say that the food we ate were not worthed $27.95/person. I probably would've enjoyed a better meal at a less-fancier Italian restaurant and only have to pay $13. Did not get money's worth. We started with 2 appetizers: Calamari and the spinach and artichoke al forno. The calamari was okay - we got a LOT of tentacles. 80% of the plate was filled with tentacles, not as appetizing if we were given other parts of the squid. The spinach and artichoke al forno was okay - LOTS of cheese, very little spinach and artichoke. I guess that's how you can fill up a plate as dip. Very cheap, I would say. We had 4 entree - the chicken saltimbocca (which was dry and VERY salty. We had a lot of this chicken leftover), linguine & clams with wine sauce (LOTS of pasta, very little clams. The clams were all chopped into tiny pieces so we pretty much ate a lot of pasta to fill), grilled salmon & lemon and herb (this was the best dish. Yum!), and chinati braised beef (not bad..it tastes average and no complaints). We finished dinner with 2 desserts. We had tiramisu (which was very good!.. moist and coffee-ish) and the noona's pound cake (the cake was very hard.kinda like cornbread but it was tasty). Since it was my best friend's birthday couple of us told our waitress and the host that it was her birthday hoping they would do something for her, but unfortunately we had to make mention of it several times til someone came out with candles and cookies to celebrate.

I have honestly never had a bad experience here - save from the one week I was employed by them and had to choose whether I wanted to fail my college classes or fail the Maggiano's menu quizzes.  Maybe I should've chosen Maggiano's, since that was several years ago and I'm 80k in debt and don't even have a degree to show for it.  I am glad I tried to work there for one week, because I gained a deep love for the food there and also learned that the places I should work at have Sharpie all over the tables and are still living in the glory of having Barack Obama as a former regular... but enough about the Medici. I had only been for dinner before a couple weeks ago, and have never been dissatisfied.  Last year, we came on my birthday and ordered family style for the first time, which I loved because I got to pick everything AND take home all of the leftovers.  This year, my boyfriend and I came for lunch on my birthday (and dinner at Nacional 27 with mom that night AND family dinner that weekend at Wildfire - I told you I loved LEYE places!) and were shocked to learn that if you order a signature pasta dish, you get to pick an ENTIRELY DIFFERENT ADDITIONAL order of pasta TO GO!!!  We left not only with our leftovers, but two full additional orders of pasta!  We couldn't believe it!  I could maybe understand offering customers a free to go order of the SAME pasta, since they would just make it all together in the same pot... but no!  We had ziti and lasagna while we were there and then took home another order of lasagna (for me - I had the ziti, but their lasagna is AMAZING) and gnocchi!  How can you beat that!?!?  Lunch for days!",0.995,0.75,0.188,0.062,0.5341402187556035

I had a fabulous time. The servings are massive and the prices are reasonable. We went home with so many leftovers, we ate like kings and queens for a couple of days.

2011-03-02,4.0,"I was quite surprised to learn that I had never reviewed Maggiano's before, considering I've eaten here umpteen times.  The food is consistently and reliably good. The menu is extensive enough that everyone can find something they like. It's never going to elicit ""oohs"" and ""ahs"" (at least from me), but it's solid, hearty, Italian fare, served in generous portions, by friendly staff.  I like that you can go to any Maggiano's and it's exactly the same as any other Maggiano's in the LEYE empire (although I think some of them are not owned by LEYE); that is, no surprises; you always know what to expect.  Highlights include:  *Mozzarella marinara  *Chicken francese, served with an arugula salad and crispy garlic potatoes  *Rigatoni 'D'  *Chicken pesto linguine  *Toasted pound cake with caramelized bananas  *Profiteroles  Their family-style dinner is also a good value. Every time I've gone with my family, we leave with bags and bags of food.  They used to have the option of ordering pastas in half-portion sizes, which they've discontinued. Instead, the menu states that you can take home a complimentary pasta. I think you have to ask for this specifically because the few times I've been since they started this deal, the server didn't offer it and I had to ask. Hey, I have no shame in getting a free entrée.  Maggiano's is like watching the same episode of your favorite show over and over; you always know how it will turn out.",0.9861,0.798,0.162,0.041,0.4679166666666667

The dining room we were in was maybe a quarter full. There were plenty of staff around. Just none that came to our table. We sat there for about 15 minutes, by which time I had worked up a serious craving for some raspberry lemonade after re-reading the menu about 20 times. We stood up and took our time getting our coats on and stuff together. No one came over to our table. We stopped by the hostess stand on the way out to tell them we were leaving and no one had come by to greet us or even take our drink order. They weren't really very apologetic and we were out the door.  We ended up going to Volare and getting great service and good Italian food (from real Italians, loved the accents!)

Recently I haven't been to Maggiano in a while since I wanted to cut down my carb intake, but the 12.95 for two meal deal was too good to pass up. The current promotion gives you a classic pasta dish for today and a take home for tomorrow. Previously I would fall head over heels for the meat lasagna covered in melted cheese and sauce with a heavy helping of italian bread to soak up the excess. This meal unfortunately was not the same. The lasagna came on the cold side and given the size of the meal, half way through everything just tasted cold... Nevertheless the first few bites were okay. I completed the meal with tiramasu which was amazing, but expensive (7 dollars for a small slice, luckily I had a coupon for free dessert). My take home meal was a baked ziti which was good the next day, but it didn't have the wow factor. Fyi the meal also is cold and comes from the fridge when you check out. Other than the food, the ambiance is nice for  a quiet date with a live piano music in the bar. Service was quick. Pro: very large filling dishes, friendly staff Cons: food could have been warmer, also on the saltier side. pricey desserts Hidden gem: Sign up for the eclub to get 10 dollars off your next visit.

Maggiano's might be a chain, it still delivers tasty fare in a old-fashioned atmosphere that is just PER-FECT for all these gloomy winter nights when you venture outside in order to be pampered and eat like a hog. We arrived early on a Saturday evening after a movie and there was still a 30-minute wait for a table in the dining room. Take notes kids. Make a reservation if you want the grand chic of the white tablecloth 'cause it's not going to happen otherwise.

Tuscan style, please: white wine sauce (and I suppose quite a bit of butter from what I could tell from the velvety wonder of the sauce),  cannellini beans,  sun-dried tomatoes, finished with lemon and roasted garlic. The wild boar canneloni with balsamic sauce, the gnocchi and the baked zitti with sausage were all hits and the 'chou' part of the profirerole (the puff pastry if you prefer) was spot on. Never had anything remotely as good in the US. Good to know: - piano/singing many nights of the week - wine is pretty cheap, with a few bottles under $35 - when you order a classic pasta dish, you get one free to go. Seriously. That's quite a great deal in my book. - if you come with a party of 4 or more, consider the Family style dinner. 3 options: light ($19.50/person), classic ($26.95), chef's choice ($36.50). A lot of food to be had. - they sell the profiteroles by the piece. $2.95 each. Such a great idea for a light sweet ending. But beware: these are BIG.

We both had a modest sized dinner salad with our meal, she selected the Ceasar salad and I the tossed Italian salad.  Both were excellent.  My filet was accompanied by roasted potatoes, which were ok but not necessary as far as I was concerned.  I was plenty stuffed without them.

2010-08-23,5.0,"Went to Maggiano's last week, my second visit, and this place ranks up there as one of my favorite restaurants (and one of my mom's, too, if you're keeping track).  The place is nice, classy, and although it's a chain (Lettuce Entertain You), it doesn't feel like a chain, no birthday songs or chicken fingers to be found. We got the family-style serving, which meant we all got to try a lot of different things, and since we'd been before, we delved a bit deeper into the menu, e.g., getting the brazed beef cannelinni instead of, say, lasagna. It was a good choice, something different. And, as with our first visit, I thought everything was very good to excellent. Some things they do very well (the ravioli are always superb) and some things are just good (the pork medallions weren't anything to write home about). Everyone is very nice. The place also has a classy feel, even if it's faked, but still, unless you're trying to notice that.... Overall, if you want to get a lot of food, try something a bit different, and try a lot of different things, this is the place. A bit pricey, but that's River North, and overall, it's more than worth it--we took home as much food as we ate.",0.9472,0.869,0.117,0.014,0.5679166666666665

They have done so many weddings at their venue that everyone is completely on point the entire night. I worked with Jeffrey and he is fantastic. He makes great suggestions on food and packages. They don't try to up sell you either. There are a few different packages to pick varying prices. If you are on a budget they will work with you to figure out creative ways to play around w/the packages. For example, instead of a dessert table I had more appetizers. Instead of picking the package w/the cake I had an outside cheaper bakery bring in a cake. They didn't charge a cutting fee or anything. Although we didn't have the bar open during dinner, they kept it open for the head table just to be nice. The minute I walked into the reception the entire place looked fabulous. The lighting was ideal and it looked really nice. I went to fix my hair and one of the servers immediately came up to me to see if I needed a drink or anything. This was how they were the entire night. Some of my guests had particular health issues and they made accommodations for him so he could eat the food.  Honestly, it was fabulous. My guests had a great time and its in the heart of the city. We had a lot of out of town guests and Maggianos helps you get  better rates at the local hotels. So it was nice for my guests to walk back to the hotel from the reception easily. For me, I really wanted a city wedding. Although its not cheap, you aren't going to break the bank either.

SO as a personal assistant at my boss's house, I go through his stuff to organize it, etc.  Recently i found this gift card for $50 for a Lettuce Entertain You restaurant.  $50 dollars to an doctor= petty cash, $50 dollars to a poor college student = baller status.  Needless to say I had to convince him to give it to me.  After i achieved this task, I chose to go to Maggiano's because of their family style option.  If you don't know what this is, you pay a flat rate for 2 of a large selection of pasta, salad, appetizer, entree, and dessert.  The best part is that if you finish a dish and want more, they will refill it for you and if your SMART, you will force feed yourself to finish the first dish and take the refill home. (obviously my plan). I walked out with bags absolutely stuffed. Unfortunately, my waiter looked at my boyfriend and i like we were nuts when we wanted all that food for ourselves so I was resentful that he was making me feel so gluttonous for doing so.  He also kind of sucked.

The stuffed mushrooms were huge and so tasty. We then had a family styled dinner that consisted of bread & butter, Cesar Salad, Maggianos Salad, Rigatoni ""D"", Lasagna, Chicken Parmesan, and Salmon with Lemon and Herb. My favorites were the Cesar salad, rigatoni ""D"", and the Lasagna (and I normally do not like lasagna). The Chicken was okay too - but a little on the drier side. The salmon was overcooked, so I didn't care for it too much. For desert we had the apple crostada and the tiramisu. The Apple Crostada was so good - like eating hot apple pie with ice cream. Yum!

Then the appetizers: Good salad, delicious spinachy-cheesy goodness, fried zucchini, stuffed mushrooms and some meh bruschetta. Good start. Then I had the veal and mushroom ravioli, which was super rich and pretty good. Dad had the pesto- delicious. Mom had sausage ziti- okay. Pseudsgrands had some sausage beefy goodness that was awesome. Didn't really get much further around the table than that as I was still fairly unacquainted with the other grandkids. Manners- lame. We finished with some apple carmely goodness for desert, which was rad. And at 8:00 PM sharp, they dim the lights dramatically to shoo the families out.

It's easy to throw garlic in any dish and cover your mistakes...but damn. Isn't Maggiano's supposed to be a quality restaurant? The service is getting bad as well.

I'd walked by this place a million times and was really hopeful. But boy was I disappointed ... I ordered the Mozerella Marinara appetizer, which turned out to just be a square piece of cheese breaded and covered with their absolutely benign marinara sauce. It wasn't sticks like mozarella sticks normally are, but just this square. And it wasn't even enough for more than two people to enjoy. The sauce was absolutely plain, nothing interesting about it. If anything, it was even too benign for a pasta sauce. A sidenote: The raspberry lemonade is delicious. Order it. For my main course I got the Chicken Parmesan, an easy, easy meal choice, no? Well, first they somehow lost it and nearly my entire table was done by the time I got my food. The same nothingness-filled marinara coated two pieces of chicken. I also got a salad with the meal, this being a choice I made between a side of pasta, salad, etc. I thought this was a pretty crappy setup.

Nothing cutting edge or modern about the decor. This may be the way they want it to be - designed/themed or whatever, but it didn't work for me. THE FOOD. okay, we had platters brought out to our various tables - platters of baked tilapia in a lemon garlic olive oil & pea sauce over a bed of spinach, a hearty hearty meaty gigantic platter of lasagna, baked chicken breast with mozarella and marinara sauce, and angel hair with marinara. All were tasty enough for mass cooked meals for a large group. Usually a bit more in the taste dept may be compromised when dealing with large groups. Thing was, i was starving when I got here.

Let's start with the good: easy to get in on a Monday night, lots of dishes to choose from, big servings-we all got 1/2 serving pasta, and some of us had leftover.   The Bad: the food is just not good.  Go a few more blocks and you can be at La Scarola, drive 5 more mins and you can be at Le Luce or Rosale's in Little Italy.   The fettuccine alfredo sauce was like the make -it-yourself baggie powder that you get at grocery store.  The baked ziti(one of their signature dishes) was way too salty and the cheese on top was just baked globbed on.  This list can go on.... Service was okay, but not the top notch that I am used to at other Lettuce restaurants, e.g. Shaw's, Nacional 27.  Overall, it's a thumbs down for me.",0.5739,0.875,0.082,0.043,0.43688271604938267

2007-09-30,2.0,"Back when I was partying like it's 1999 I was all about Maggianos. The parents would visit me at NU and we'd go to Old Orchard for shopping and HUGE portions of pasta (another thing that contributed to the freshman 15).  I wished we had an Italian restaurant like this back home...and then my wish came true and there was not only a Maggiano's in Boca Raton, but pretty much in any other mall around the United States.  But by this time I'd discovered the finer things in life (ex: La Scarola and Rose Angelis) and Maggianos just wasn't doing it for me anymore.  Yes, the portions were still enormous, but I  was busy dieting trying to lose that freshman 15! ;) And the Italian food is really just....bland (and this is coming from the girl who could eat pasta for breakfast, lunch, and dinner).   Until last night I've never even visited this downtown location of Maggiano's because why would I go here when I could get my fill of pasta at so many other amazing italian restaurants nearby.  This isn't the suburbs after all....we have options in Chicago!   That being said I do have to say that if you're planning a party they do have very nice banquet rooms. I attended a very well done party here last night where the downstairs space itself was lovely, the staff was attentive, and there was plenty of room to move around (people were even dancing).  I still found the food to be bland, but food is usually compromised at these events anyway when you're serving a bunch of people.",0.9924,0.817,0.171,0.012,0.4863095238095239

Again, I should reiterate what most have said, portions are humongous.  If you are ordering per person, it's easily enough for 2-3 meals.
