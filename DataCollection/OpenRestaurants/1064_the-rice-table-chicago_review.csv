2017-07-20,1.0,"I gotta say, I was less than impressed with this The Rice Table dinner.  For starters, it was really, really warm outside the day I went and the room had no AC. Also, the room was so loud, I could not hear anyone at my table, making conversation really difficult.  Additionally, we all sat (sweating) for 45 minutes until any food came out.  There was no welcome or introduction or explanation of any of the courses.  And the food itself was just not great. But the worst part: the final course was mussels, and there were at least two closed mussels on the platter that was passed to me - and eating those could make you ill.  They should never have been served.  I skipped that course entirely. Was glad when it finally ended.",-0.7018,0.803,0.079,0.118,0.7057291666666667

Wonderful Javanese authentic dishes, perfectly spiced, nothing was too hot and flavors came through beautifully. Although the $50 seems a little pricey, second helpings were there for the asking.  Too many dishes to pick out a fave. However, dessert does need to be mentioned baked by chef Chris, 13-15 (?) layers spice cake, delicious served with vanilla icecream. We were a table of six friends and enjoyed the atmosphere (A/C could've been  on and fold-up chairs were not very comfortable, but then this is a ""pop up""). It''s been a long time since I had a good rijstafel not since Amsterdam years ago! It was so nice to meet and chat to  owner Jane. We will definitely be back! Oh yes and BYOB a nice ice-cold white chardonnay from Kumeu River, New Zealand was perfect (a very  lite, crisp Chardonnay).

Being Dutch Indonesian, I want the food to be authentic and to taste like the food I grew up on. The Rice Table was absolutely yummy. We all loved the well prepared dishes that were perfectly spiced and hot but not packing too much heat.  The serving amounts were just right (you could always ask for more, if needed) and the variety of dishes were very well balanced.  The terong balado, basically eggplant, tomato in a sambal base was killer. Rendang beef and braised chicken in a spicy coconut sauce, curried vegetables and tempe, etc all delicious. And to top off the meal, they served Spekkoek or multi layered spiced cake with a scope of vanilla ice cream kissed with cinnamon. I was in food heaven.

2014-02-26,5.0,"This is a review for the pop-up dinner, or Rijsttafel, that they put on at Vincent's restaurant once a month. Prior to Rickshaw Republic opening, this was the only place to eat Indonesian cuisine in Chicago, so my fiancee and I decided to go last year. All I can say is that the experience was terrific. The food is unique, with a heavy emphasis on spice and heat, using flavors that you don't find in other south Asian cuisines. The owner of the Rice Table came around to every table during the meal to explain each of the 15 different items that were served. If you wanted more of something they brought it out for you. Everything was delicious, and I've been wanting to go back ever since. For $45, it's a great value, and since the menu changes every month, it'll always be a different adventure each time.",0.9393,0.898,0.102,0.0,0.5279761904761904
2013-03-07,4.0,"This is only my second Yelp review but I use it extensively.   I was visiting Chicago this past weekend to see my best friend from college become a Dutch citizen (his mother's Dutch).  In order to help celebrate this very special moment in his life, I made a reservation at Vincent, which I had been to before and really enjoyed. The day of the reservation, one of the staff from Vincent called to let me know that on the first Sunday of the month they hold a rijsttafel and wondered if I would still like to keep my reservation.  I said absolutely, always having wanted to try this aspect of Dutch/Indonesian cuisine and I thought my friend would be thrilled. Well, we both were~! I've traveled fairly extensively throughout SE Asia and am a member of the James Beard House in New York City, so I don't mess around when it comes to food. Not only was everything incredibly fresh and well-spiced but also delicious.  I had the absolute best rendition of beef satay that I've ever encountered--which to me was thrilling.  Better still,  one of the owners of The Rice Table really went out of her way to explain each of the myriad dishes and to make sure we understood the tradition behind a rijsttafel, including the all you-can-eat aspect and the expectation that the guests should linger over the food and stay as long as they'd like.  She checked in on us a few times and could not have been more hospitable. In short, a really great place and very much worth the price (I believe it was $55 per person). I highly recommend. T",0.9982,0.735,0.265,0.0,0.5300430495430495

After a few minutes they brought our plates of food, and after comparing the items with the menu, I realized that they had forgotten the tempeh, crackers, peanut sauce for my husband's skewers (I don't eat meat), and tofu on my husband's plate.  So, yeah.  The kitchen (which was under a tent outside, a pretty challenging situation I realize) and our server didn't realize that major parts of our meals were missing!  That being said, I really liked the tempeh a lot.  It was supposed to be sprinkled on the food, according to the other plates I saw go by.  $15 for the meal was ok, but I felt that it really should have been a few dollars since the quality is on par with a neighborhood ethnic restaurant--good, but nothing remarkable.  The servers clearly were not prepared to deal with all the people.  There are lots of kinks to work out! We decided to pay an additional $4 and split the dessert and coffee pairing, which was 2 pieces of fried banana (hot and good) and a thousand-layer cake (pretty dense, but delicate since they were very thin slices).   The people were friendly, but this operation just needs a lot more work.  $34 plus tip was pretty pricey for what it was.  I wouldn't mind going back, but I wouldn't make it a destination.",0.9876,0.828,0.131,0.041,0.5498148148148148
