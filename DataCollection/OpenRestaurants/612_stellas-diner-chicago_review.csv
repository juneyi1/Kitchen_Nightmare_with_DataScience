The diner is cute, and it has a nostalgic feel.  The staff is super nice although the one rule on the weekend was a little annoying.  The weekend rule: your entire party needs to be there to get seated and there's really no good waiting area.  I'll give this place another try, and get some of the other Yelpers favorites to see if it was just a off item on the menu.",0.9676,0.778,0.158,0.064,0.6283333333333333

I ordered the avocado and cheddar burger with fries, and a chocolate milkshake. Everything was good, I ordered my burger medium but it could have been more medium.  The one thing negative I would say is that around 9:30 they said they were closed and that if you hadn't gotten food yet you weren't going to get it. And at 9:45 they said it was time to pay because everyone wanted to go home. They technically close at 10pm and while I understand wanting to go home after a long week, it isn't hospitable to customers to kick them out. So I didn't love that interaction, but I will be back to try breakfast soon...and get another milkshake.",-0.8784,0.903,0.022,0.074,0.3886002886002886

Their chili is a little sweet to me but I am extremely fussy on chili. The people are friendly and treat you like family.

It looked like they set up for movie or TV scenes. I don't know but it was so. The area around was under road construction but I walk around anyway for exercise.

I wanted to like this place so badly as it's right by my apartment and the aesthetic ticks all the boxes for an american diner, but the food is just not worth the money. It's a little bit pricey too.

Anyway, Stella's has never disappointed me in this regard. The backdrop of a diner may not be instagram worthy (eyeroll), but I have never left feeling anything less than supremely satisfied. The servers are attentive, the food always comes out hot, and I haven't tried anything I haven't liked yet.",0.909,0.732,0.188,0.08,0.6628205128205129

This is typical of a lot of restaurants in Chicago during brunch but having no designated waiting area sucks. Not only for the people waiting but for the people eating or staff trying to move around.  Service was where the three stars come in. Everyone forgets at least heck on your table to see if anything is missing. Drinks and parts of our food order made it at the tail end of our meal.  The food itself was okay. You get what you pay for here. Nothing to rave about but it doesn't taste like cardboard. The skillet is the way to go here. The waffle was good but my sausage links may have been old.

It was significantly busier than where we had just left and yet were seated after a mere five minute wait and had our food within twenty minutes of being seated.  Our waitress was as attentive as she could be given how busy she was and she still managed to catch a minor mistake before I had to say anything, given small OJ when a large was ordered.  The food was excellent. Ordered a gypsy skillet which has hash browns, diced ham, onions and mushrooms with my eggs over easy. Cooked to perfection and filling.  After paying and leaving I was stopped almost a block away by a busboy who found my wallet on the table and instead of putting it in lost and found chased me down Broadway. I mean, who does that!

Which i thought was rude, I tip well, being in the service industry myself. He then said, how about tipping 20%? (Which I already did). I told him okay and tipped the ""20%"" he suggested. Did I calculate wrong? Nope! He made me tip more than 20% I was very disappointed with the treatment at the cash register. I respect waitresses being a waitress myself. Overall, food =good, service=good, payment process=embarrassing. Make your own decision, but I am not going back to be treated like that. P.s.

One tips when he or she feels his or her servers deserve it. Don't judge others for what they can or cannot afford. I've been in the service business. I know how it is. How about instead of judging your customers, treat your servers better. Pay them more. Give them a larger piece of the income.  I tried not to let the manager ruin the review, but honestly the food is not great. Its average, just slightly better than an IHOP, and left me hungry. The servers are sweet. But all managers are a reflection of the establishment and in this case Stella's fails to meet expectations.  Thank you for speaking to me on the phone. I believe we will have to agree to disagree.

We waited 10 minutes for a waitress to acknowledge our presence (after stacking the menus on a ledge and looking around for service). We ordered fries, onion rings, and a brownie sundae. We then waited a half hour for their arrival. The food was flavorless, though that is beside the point. In preparation for our sundae, over the next 30 minutes- we stacked our plates, used the restroom, looked around bewildered, received multiple water refills from the busboy, and began boiling with frustration. I grabbed my purse and walked over to the front desk to wait for the manager, who had been manning it most of the night. The waitress suddenly noticed me!

2016-02-06,3.0,"I've been to Stella's a solid 15 times. It's okay if you're looking for a cheap fast breakfast but the quality just seems sub par considering the neighboring options. They have ""NO SUBSTITUTIONS"" written clearly on the menu- always a nice way to let you know they're not too accommodating so just pick something and run with it. What puzzles me is the dichotomy between the wait staff and the host staff. The wait staff are professional and friendly while the host staff, particularly the woman on the weekend mornings, leave much to be desired in the customer service department. Please note I have really only had breakfast and lunch (maybe 1-2x) so I can't speak for their milkshakes, one thing they are supposed to be known for.  If you're in the neighborhood it's worth a try if you're little pressed for time, if not try Wilde down the street.",0.9437,0.83,0.138,0.032,0.4503968253968254

2016-01-17,5.0,"I went to Stella's with a group of friends for a casual dinner on a Saturday night and was blown away by the amazing service and great, classic diner food.  We called ahead for our group of seven, and they were able to easily accommodate our size. We were greeted and seated immediately once we arrived. Waters were quick to the table, and our server, Laura, started us off with a recommendation for the garlic bread. I'm so glad that we followed her suggestion - the bread was delicious and one order was more than enough for the table. I don't think I'll ever go back to Stella's without ordering the garlic bread to start!  Laura was also happy to give recommendations for our meals and answer any questions we had on the menu. I ordered the turkey pesto sandwich with Cajun fries. Others at my table ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich, rueben sandwich, and the chicken tender basket. All were more than happy with their choices. My turkey sandwich was huge - enough to bring half home. The fries were just the right amount of crispy and the Cajun seasoning was very good. The meal also came with a small side of creamy cole slaw which was delicious. Since Stella's is BYOB, we brought a few bottles of wine to enjoy with our meal as well.  What made Stella's stand out to me was the service demonstrated by the staff and owners of the restaurant. Gus chatted with us throughout the meal, providing laughs and stories to accompany our food. Laura was attentive but not overbearing, and both she and Gus seemed to genuinely care about our dining experience. All of the staff seemed to be in a great mood, and enjoyed interacting with the patrons. At the end of our meal, Laura brought over small scoops of complimentary ice cream and was easily able to split our bill seven ways.  Our whole group left Stella's happy and satisfied.

The real stars here are the staff, however.  The server was funny and friendly and really awesome.  But the buss boys who came by and refilled water and coffee were the best.  They didn't hang around us, but the instant we needed something, even if we didn't realize it, they were there to take care of us.  Seriously, nice job guys.

I, on the other hand, (following my waitress' recommendation) got the chicken Parmesan spaghetti with the French onion soup and mine was DELICIOUS! The soup had plenty of perfectly-broiled Gruyere cheese on top- so good. Then my food came out- the spaghetti was perfectly cooked and the chicken was deliciously seasoned and prepared. I devoured my food and left a happy camper.  The enjoyment of this diner seems contingent on the food you order. I suggest asking your server for food recommendations!

I came here with my wife and infant son in the morning on New Years Eve 2015. We took some time to look at the menu...the manager (who i think is the grandson of the founder) noticed that we were weighing options and offered to give us advice on other neighborhood options if this was not what we were looking for. We decided that this looked good and went with it. We ordered skillets, one veggie and one with avocado.  Both were filling and satisfying and reasonably priced. Our waitress was attentive and super sweet. Best of all it was clear that his was a neighborhood joint...the staff seemed to know most if not all of the blue collar the guys who were stopping in for their morning meal.

First, the food is great quality yet there's nothing fancy or trendy about it. In turn, the prices are on-point- $8-10 for a skillet depending on your ingredients. The menu has something for everyone, service is fast, and my coffee cup is frequently topped off. Even if there's a line for a table, turnover is fast so you won't wait long. This doesn't mean you're rushed through your meal either; they just happen to be quick at taking your order and making your food.  I've also noticed that the same servers continue to work there for years and years- I can only assume it's a well-run business if people stick around so long, right? That gives me extra incentive to frequent this place. Other added bonuses- there are all ages at this place and it's lively without being overtly noisy.

Cons: -Don't know.  Didn't see anything wrong. It gets very busy here, so come early.",0.9694,0.819,0.153,0.028,0.4809848484848485

Their blackened chicken salad is one of my favorites as well. Love this place considering it's about 30 yards from where I live on Barry. Not to mention if you've had a fun Friday/Saturday night, the following morning if you order from them they make quick to get your breakfast/lunch order out fast, 15 minutes tops. The staff is wonderful, on a side note; I was walking past the place to go to my car and I saw a waitress come to inform a few out of towners that the parking on the end of Barry Ave was free after 6 at the green meters.

The owner Gus is one of the kindest and most thoughtful people I have ever met and the food is great.   I ordered some food from them via Grubhub and the order was missing fries.  I also accidentally ordered the side mac and cheese thinking it was the meal.  I told the driver upon arrival that I though the order was wrong.  I didn't complain, but the driver mentioned something to Gus.  Ten minuets later I get a call from the owner, apologizing for the mishap and insisting to bring me over a corrected order.  He listened to me and let me tell him what had happened, which in and of itself is a miracle. Most place just cut you off and say sorry nothing we can do for you.  I told him that wasn't necessary but he did it anyways and even tiped his own driver.   I have to say that in a time when no one values their customers, I completely understand why they have been around for so long.  He went out of his way to please one customer and I'm sure he does the same for others.  I love this place and I sincerely hope that all of you support local business that have the same type of integrity and pride about their product as Stella's does.  5 MILLION STARS in my book.  I'll be coming back for years to come.  Thank you Gus for making me feel like a special customer.

We then realized winter was upon us, it was dark at 6pm and 20 degrees so we defancified and decided on Stella's.  As a diner, Stella's earned five stars in my book. I got the Monte Cristo sandwich, while the food didn't knock my socks off it was certainly tasty and fulfilling, and I would order it again. The coffee was hot and my cup was filled multiple times throughout the night but what really blew me away about Stella's was the service. Our waitress was cute and funny and prompt and possibly the owner who was manning the cash register showered us in compliments and sincerely thanked us for coming in.  If your looking for decent diner food, a warm atmosphere, and somewhere they don't mind if you take up a booth for a while, Stella's is your place",0.9765,0.848,0.152,0.0,0.6205782312925169

Stella's ended up being one of the best breakfast experiences ever - it's now become the place I take family to when they visit. Their vegetarian skillet just tastes so fresh and light - something you don't associate with diner food.

It's never a long wait to get a table (even on Saturday and Sunday mornings/noons) and the waiters and waitresses are always so pleasant and provide quick service.

She never once made eye contact with us, and was not at all a friendly face I would typically associate with a diner. When we went, it was an unusually cold day in Chicago, yet the restaurant had the AC on FULL BLAST to the point where several of the patrons were wearing their sweatshirt hoods.

Finally when going to pay for the check, the girl at the cash register had a difficult time cashing us all out.

I can only split by amounts.""  I guess I didn't see the logic behind this... just add up the cost of an omelette and a coffee, and that's what I'll pay!

Sometimes a sandwich or the buffalo chicken salad. I don't have a favorite dish there, I like all of them that I've had. They completely cover the biscuits with gravy, unlike some places that you have to ask for a side of it to fully cover it. The service has always been great, sometimes a little too fast to greet us once seated, but I'd rather be greeted promptly than waiting 30 minutes.

Then he sat down in our booth and long story short he proceeded to say the single most creepy thing a complete stranger has ever said to me. ""You have beautiful skin. I'm a skin guy. I would take you home and bathe you, rub lotion on you, and take you to the bed and make love to you."" I nearly choked on my food.

However, I expected the dish to have more favor, such as a bolder cheese sauce. I will say Stella's baked mac and cheese was better than most attempts in Chicago. Just not the best. The diva cake was plainly warm chocolate cake, chocolate / fudge sauce and ice cream. While I did eat it all, the dish was nothing special. Again, I was expecting a bold chocolate taste with the diva cake after reading the reviews. Yet, I have tasted better cupcakes in Chicago.

2012-04-22,2.0,"If I had to sum up our experience at Stella's, I would tell you it just just utterly forgettable.  There was nothing that was necessarily wrong or bad; it's just that there wasn't anything GOOD, either.  While this place has lots of great reviews historically, you'll notice that the more recent trend hasn't been so flattering, and I have to agree with the more recent sentiments of feeling underwhelmed and unimpressed. Prices are decent (not great), but the food is really just ho-hum.  Just thinking about it makes me want to yawn.  Between the four of us at the table, we had the French Toast Special, Banana Nut Waffle, Pancakes w/Sausage, and the Chorizo Jalapeño Skillet (special of the day).  Nobody disliked their food, but we all felt our money would have been better spent elsewhere.  Nobody was excited about any of it... and trust me, these were four people who get VERY excited about good food!  My waffle was by far the best meal at the table, but it was no better than anything I could have made easily in my own kitchen. Service was fine -- took our order, brought our drinks, brought our check and that was that.  No ""how's everyone enjoying their meal?""  No ""can I get you anything else?""  She wasn't rude or anything -- again, just... blah.  Not sure I could pick her out of a prison line-up, actually. And the place?  There was really nothing special about it.  It was just a standard, faceless diner.  Totally forgettable, just like the rest of the experience.

2012-01-03,1.0,"I dined at Stella's about six or seven years ago, and remember deciding I would not be back. A few days ago I didn't feel like walking to Melrose Diner (outstanding), so I looked up Yelp reviews on Stella's. Based on the 4-5 star reviews, I thought that my first visit must have been a fluke.  It was not. Once we were seated, a kind gentleman brought coffee, but unfortunately I realized after he left that there was no sugar. Perhaps not a problem, I thought, because good coffee doesn't need cream or sugar. This coffee needed a lot of sugar. After about seven minutes, our kind waitress arrived.  We ordered and she brought me sugar. I received my food and realized my omelette did not have cheese in it. I accept responsibility-- I noticed the description of my vegetarian omelette did not include cheese, but I thought that part of being an omelette meant there was cheese. I just thought I didn't have a choice in what cheese was on it. The menu asks for no substitutions, so when I boldly asked to add avocado, I figured I couldn't make any other changes.  The cheese-less vegetarian omelette had no taste to it. The avocado was warmed inside the omelette, making it a little gross. I would have expected the slices to be added to the top after the cooking was done.  I added as much salt to the omelette as I could bear and tried to eat it, but it was beyond repair. The staff was very nice, but the food wasn't. I feel that others likely expect cheese in an omelette, and would probably be disappointed like me to find it not there. In that case, I would think the wait staff would warn you that there is no cheese, so you can add it if you want it. But I guess that goes against the substitution rule. I will never return to Stella's. In six years, if I wonder why I said I won't go back, I can now refer to this rule and save my taste buds from numbness.",0.7726,0.818,0.097,0.084,0.5050000000000001

It's your standard diner menu at typical Lakeview prices (so typically under $30 with coffee & tip for 2). Definitely a cheaper alternative to The Bagel, which is right across the street.  The breakfast is good, with hearty portions. My eggs have always been prepared exactly as requested. The omelet menu could use a facelift, but you can always request the fixings you desire. I've never had runny eggs or any other bad experiences, as some reviewers suggest.  Sandwiches are hot and delicious, and I'd highly recommend the cajun fries. Their sanwiches fill me up, and my girlfriend usually has enough leftover for lunch for the next day. I've yet to try any salad/soup/dessert/burger, but I nearly ordered a milkshake today when the couple at the table ahead of us had there's delivered.  Every time I've been here they're quick on the poor with the water re-fill, but I always have to ask somebody to get more coffee. Seeing as this is a diner, this is a small pet peeve of mine. We've also had to ask for cream multiple times. Other than that, the servers are friendly and seem to genuinely want you to enjoy your experience. If you're in the area and love brunch as much as I do, Stella's is well worth trying for yourself. Also, learned on Yelp it's family run, which is always a business worth supporting in my book.  I'm a fan of the outdoor summer seating. If you're coming between 10:30 - 12:30 on a weekend, expect a wait, but this is true of any diner worth the feast.",0.991,0.794,0.171,0.035,0.4038608776844071

They weren't crunchy, but the flavor was really good for soft hashbrowns covered in breakfast items. The skillet was also MASSIVE. I could eat about half of it before I had to stop eating.

This place has some pretty good omelettes, and they don't give you a hard time if you're nitpicky and want to add some extra details, like egg whites.

I know I'm obsessed with pancakes and all, but sometime's a guy's gotta take a break you know? The food and coffee here is good, and the portions are big.

For those of you who aren't breakfast fanatics like me, there are plenty of other choices.  I've heard the mac and cheese is delish (think I'll try that next time).  Their menu ranges from soups to various salads to quesadillas to burgers to a wide variety of sandwiches.  So there's something here for everyone.  Prices are also reasonable. I like that Stella's is low key and definitely has a diner feel to it.  The wait staff are friendly and the guy (I think this might be Gus) who handles the cash register greets you right away.  He seems to know a lot of the patrons that come here which gives Stella's a real family feel to it.",0.9917,0.794,0.183,0.023,0.48959435626102304

The food is fresh and flavor-able while still managing to be 'diner fare' which equates to good ole comfort food.

2010-07-01,1.0,"I will never return to this establishment!  I have eaten at Stella's Diner probably 8-10 times over the past few years. My husband and I have eaten there alone and have brought large parties with us. We enjoy the large menu and the food has always been good (not fabulous, not bad). The service has been good on occasion but more often the servers seem snotty and harried. But, it is often less busy than neighboring The Bagel or Melrose Diner. But all that said, after my recent experience, we will NOT return. Yesterday, (a Wednesday at 12:30pm) two adult friends and I wished to dine on Stella's outdoor patio. My two friends entered the restaurant and approached the host stand, with our two strollers, while I waited outside with our dog. They asked for a table outside and the host, who claimed he was the manager, took a look at the two strollers and said ""I can't accomodate you."" He told them he could seat them inside at which point they replied that we wished to be outside, and that we had a dog.  In the meantime, I had already taken a seat at an open table at the end of the patio. There was no one else waiting and I assumed we would soon be served. A busboy went ahead and moved two tables together, brought water and menus. My dog was leashed beside me the entire time on the outside edge of the table.  Inside, my friends explained that there were three empty tables outside, including a table on the end, with ample room for two strollers and our dog. After taking a look briefly outside he again said ""I cannot accomodate you and we dont allow dogs."" My friends left, completely dejected and came outside to relay the story to me.  Now, I also need to say that I have walked past Stella's approximately 100 times in the past four months as I was on maternity leave and walked my dog to the lake via Barry. There have OFTEN been dogs sitting alongside their patio tables.  I went in to speak to the host/manager and asked him why it was he ""could not accomodate"" us. He just kept reiterating the same line, with no explanation. I explained that we could easily fit the two strollers, and he replied that they don't allow dogs on the patio. I explained that I see dogs there frequently and he said that he ""got a ticket"" this past weekend during the Pride Parade and that he is not allowing them anymore, except one blind guy that he lets bring his dog.  So, needless to say, we left.  Now, if a restaurant chooses not to allow dogs on their outside patios, that is certainly their prerogative. But, I see dogs there all the time, which is why we chose Stella's as our destination. I feel strongly that we were turned away because we had two strollers and were too much of a hassle for this particular host/manager. He made the decision the he couldnt ""accomodate"" us before he even knew we had the dog outside.

I went with the family, a party of 8, because it was a Saturday night and I couldn't think of anywhere else that may be able to accommodate a party of this size the night before Valentines Day.  The place was empty, so points for that. Anyway, I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich, its usually my comfort food after a long day, and its usually fairly difficult to screw up, so I was craving it.  And oh my was I disappointed. The bun was not fresh, so it was crumbly and falling apart... on top of that the chicken isn't actually a single entity, it was 3 chicken strips, making the already crumbling sandwich even more sloppy.  Then add to that the runniest ranch dressing I've ever seen and it adds up to the most complicated eating experience I've had in a while.  And one look at me would tell you that I get a lot of practice. The fries 'looked' like they would be good but they were really soft and flimsy. I know Diners are more of a late night drunken hang out, but I've had better food at Applebees.  I was really disappointed.   I was here several years ago and didn't come away with such a negative impression, so maybe this was just a fluke, but I don't think so.",-0.1711,0.842,0.078,0.08,0.6049744897959182

We were seating within that time frame at the weirdest booth in the diner - the one between the front room and the back room. No window view, only the wall on either side. One side of the booth sits up really high and it is kind of odd to eat in that position. Very uncomfortable.  We both ordered skillets - gypsy and the mexican one. The hasbrowns were so oily/soggy - I hate that. One of the skillets had sausage in it and it was overpowering the whole thing - chorizo really would have been a better choice. On the other, about half of the onions (and the skillet was probably 1/2 onions anyway) were still raw. The bread was good (probably not fresh baked) but it was cold when it got to the table.  Our waitress really didn't seem to care. She acted surprised when I asked her to describe the special - and she certainly didn't volunteer much information. She seemed really preoccupied and didn't bring out our whole order until we reminded her about the missing items. She was distracted but not with serving. It seemed like we were an inconvenience.

We needed dinner, and as we were trying to find parking (another conversation entirely), we noticed Stella's. How can you not, really, with a giant utensil-clutching hand extending from the building...When we sat down, my sister remarked that it had a really comfortable, friendly ""feel"" to it, which we think is important in a restaurant.  I imagine the menu would be a tad overwhelming for someone who doesn't know what they're in the mood for, but it was a sandwich night for my mom and sister, and a gluttonous night for myself, so we ordered a BLT, grilled chicken sandwich (on a croissant with swiss and bacon), and chili cheese fries respectively. I didn't try either of their sandwiches, but the BLT looked pretty well stacked. My sister had to remove a sizable chunk of her sandwich because it was gristly, so I have to remove some points for that, but otherwise it was well seasoned and very yummy with the bacon and cheese. I've never had chili cheese fries before, so I have no idea how they compare, but I certainly finished them. The chili itself was delicious, but it slightly overwhelmed the cheese and the fries.  What really impressed me was the service. Our waitress was an absolute doll, and the food came out promptly. Apparently the owner, Gus, could tell we were new, and came over to have a chat. He was delightfully friendly, and when I mentioned I was new to the area, he told me to stop by any time I needed anything from him or his family, who started the place and still hang around - recommendations for other restaurants, help with bus routes, a place to do homework. It could have been creepy, but it seemed to come from a genuine place, and I always appreciate such kindness.  Is it the best diner food I've ever eaten? Nah, not yet anyway.

I've never tried the burgers but I'm sure they'll satisfy.  I just read a review from someone else about the garlic bread.  Being a huge fan of stinky garlic bread I think I'll try that next.  If I recall correctly the menu brags that even Dracula would like the garlic bread.  :)",0.9961,0.752,0.229,0.019,0.5950292397660819

The biscuits and gravy are amazing (especially when hungover) and for lunch fare the turkey pesto sandwich with their delicious cajun fries are very  yummy. And the shakes and desserts are a must! I have always had good service, there is one waitress that seems to be on another planet but she's sort of entertaining at the same time. And there is a funny owner man that seems to be running around.

I've had the lunch or dinner food on occasion, and it's very good as well.  But really, we all know the best meal of the day is breakfast.  Except for dessert.  The individual apple pies are really good and usually fresh out of the oven.  If you don't eat a big meal, get the pie ala mode.  Speaking of ice cream, the shakes are great.  And while we're on the subject of drinks, the freshly-squeeze orange juice will go great with your eggs and potatoes.",0.9963,0.703,0.29,0.006,0.5681666666666667

I found the place on Yelp as an alternative to Clarke's, which I have already been to.  I also am not a huge fan of Lincoln Park.  The place is pretty nice inside, but its really girly  with the neat looking host and the brightly colored walls (I'm not sure if this is in boystown or not).  I expected this by the number of womens reviews that I saw, but I still felt comfortable there nonetheless.  The host seems really nice, and the waiters are the same.  There was no wait for a table.  Once we sat down, random busboys were constantly stopping by asking if we needed soft drink refills as I watched the three bandanna-wearing cooks make food through a little window at the opposite end of the diner.  I enjoyed this place because it was very clean, and everyone that worked there seemed like they legitimately wanted it to be a good place.  I like those kinds of places, and they are a rarity these days. They had a great menu.  I think the best part about it is how there are apparently a lot of Mexicans working here who have a strong influence on the food that they make.  Why try to make some crappy standard food when you can turn ordinary foods into Mexican-influenced-diner food?   I would definitely eat here again to try some of the other things.  For example.  I ordered the spinach spinwheels for an appetizer, which I highly recommend.  They came in a light sauce, and with just a dot of spicey sauce on top of each one and around the plate..   The white sauce suggested that they were going above and beyond to make them good, and the spicy sauce that decorated the plate suggested to me that the Mexican cooks knew that a little flare to an otherwise potentially boring appetizer was probably for the better.  They were very right.  Mexicans really are the best cooks. I ordered a breakfast quesadilla (I had to go Mexican), which was on special for New Years Day.  They claimed that they came with jalapeño hash browns.  I was really excited about that.  The quesadilla was everything that I wanted it to be.  It came with sour cream and freshly made pico de gallo.   My only complaint is that there were no jalapeños in sight.  I just got some standard hash browns.  That sucks because I really love jalapeños.  I can't really think of another reason than this to take a star off of my rating, because I really loved the place.  I just don't want to accumulate too many 5 star reviews which could lessen my credibility.",0.9977,0.758,0.188,0.055,0.48333639053978045

Also, it's family owned, which means that while I'm noshing on an English muffin, I have to listen to Papa shouting for Anthony or whoever to take out the trash, or he's grounded. So that's awkward, but adds personality to an otherwise pretty cliched 50's-ish diner. Eat there but not that often.",0.911,0.871,0.108,0.021,0.6649999999999999

First off, the service here is great.  Every single person you encounter from the hostess to the server to the cashier is super friendly no matter what time of day or how busy it gets in there.  Plus the owner really takes pride in the neighborhood and recognizes people that live in the area. Breakfast-  This place really fills up on the weekends and quickly.  I have never had a long wait and they seem to move tables pretty fast.  In the summer it is never a bother to really go outside and sit on a bench though during the winter the place is a bit too small to hold everyone inside and you might have to brave the cold during your wait. I go to Stella's for the staples and enjoy the skillet style dishes (great hangover cure) and the pancakes.  The best part is that they serve turkey sausage and it is great. Tip:  I was eating breakfast last weekend and saw the table across from us had brought a bottle of champagne.  They ordered oj and I believe I heard the server say there was no corkage fee and that it was fine to bring in.   Dinner/Lunch- Like I said before I really enjoy Stella's for the diner basics.  I have taken both of my parents here and they have raved over the sandwiches.  I absolutely love their burgers.  They make to order and they have been cooked perfect every time.  The fries are good.. a great blend of crispy and tender.  The mac and cheese is super creamy and definitely tastes homemade.  The milkshakes are also old-fashioned and delicious.  They are thick and need a spoon initially but if you let them melt a bit they are perfect with a straw. I will keep coming here as long as I am in the neighborhood.  I also leave here feeling full and happy. **** Also.. during the sumer they have a great oudoor patio.  I usually bring my dog to tie up next to the table and the server will bring out a dog dish of water for my pup.  Very cool!",0.9949,0.819,0.169,0.011,0.5372962962962963

She was less impressed than I, but I did trade with her halfway through in an attempt to salvage her morning meal attempt. Service, meh. The busboy kept our water full, so at least we had something to drink. Coffee cups are typical small, thick, diner mugs, which means that they hold about 4-oz of coffee.

We ordered coffee, which came pretty quickly, but getting a refill on our tiny cups took eons.  In fact, I'm still waiting. Perhaps it was because it was busy, or because we were outside, but it felt like we did an awful lot of waiting for whatever our request was. I ordered a skillet and did not read the reviews carefully, as my sagely bf did, so I neglected to ask for the hashbrowns cripsy. So that meant I got a soggy mess of potatoes under my egg skillet. The cheese was American. I guess that's okay when you're hungover, but for me, it's not okay overall. It was nothing special; I think there was some avocado thrown in on top. The bf had a spicy breakfast burrito, which was SO much better than mine, probably because he had crispy potatoes and I didn't. I wasn't blown away; it was pretty average  breakfast food. I don't really feel like I need to go back. I'm relatively hard to impress when it comes to breakfast, I think, and Stella's just didn't live up to the challenge.

The service is very friendly and you can tell they have their share of regular clientele by the staff knowing many of the customers by name. The last time I was there I had the most delicious asian chicken salad. It's good stuff.,0.9635,0.719,0.281,0.0,0.499465811965812
2007-02-20,1.0,This is a fun little place that does your average diner fare. The breakfast portions are really big. I can't wait for it to get warm out so I can try one of their milkshakes. EDIT: I went here on Saturday with one of my girlfriends for breakfast and to do a little grad school work. After I paid $5 for a bowl of oatmeal the waitress told us we needed to get going because it was getting busy. A) That is like THE worst thing a waitress can say; B) there were a dozen empty tables in the back; C) When we left 20 minutes later there was no one waiting.

2006-11-18,5.0,"This was one of the first restaurants I ate at after moving here a little over a year ago--- I admit the reason I first gave it a try was its convenient location 2 blocks away from my apartment. But as I have learned from my many breakfast, lunch, and dinner experiences here over the past year, it is honestly a great place for good, yummy, consistent ""diner"" (or to us metro-Detroit natives, Coney Island-esque) food. Gus (Stella's son) always greets me with a ""Hi Sweetheart/Beautiful/etc"" which might sound creepy but it's not--- that's just a testament to how warm & friendly he is with all his ""regulars"" or ""semi-regulars"" (such as myself).  Now, I don't consider myself a picky eater, I just like to substitute/modify my meals. ;-) But the wait staff never flinches when I make my somewhat ""finicky""  requests  & one waiter even worked with me to figure out the cheapest way to charge me for the salad I wanted to create by working off the ingredients/prices of salads already on the menu. My favorite thing here is hands down the challah french toast (different from the regular or stuffed that's found on the menu). I barely see anyone eating it, maybe b/c it's a special listed on the little chalkboard hanging by the kitchen & only available on Sat/Sun mornings. But it is seriously divine, as it comes with fresh strawberries and a vanilla cream sauce--- can we say YUMMY? (Look for other specials on this chalkboard every day--- I think this is too often overlooked!) Also, don't pass up their creative milkshakes & pumpkin spice cake (and I don't even like pumpkin)!  (FYI: They offer breakfast at non-breakfast times; you just have to ask for the breakfast menu.)",0.9938,0.811,0.177,0.011,0.5212704953776381

2006-09-24,4.0,"Yum.  Stella's Diner was pretty effing good today.  I got picked up from yet another Megabus (see my review) trip to St. Louis and Leigh, Zach, and I all went to Stella's for some brunch.  Stella's is an okay looking joint, the booths are comfortable, but their personality is a little canned.  Superhero art lines the walls of the back room and menu language is somewhat forced.   The most important thing is that the food here is good.  I had the stuffed french toast and even though I will always be a loyal Breakfast Club fan, I wanted to venture out and try someone else's stuffed frenchy.  Stella's did it differently and just as good.  They were a tad stingy on the cream cheese filling, but it was citrus flavored which kind of blew my mind.  The topping was a mango-citrus syrup with little pieces of orange zest and it was so good.  no need for maple syrup. For dessert Leigh ordered the triple chocolate pudding.  holy shit.  That was seriously the best pudding I've ever had.  Apparently they take chocolate shavings and mix them into pudding goodness.  Its all homemade and amazing.  I recommend this joint for their food creativity. ** Definite minus for me was that their was only one bathroom for each sex. This is one of my biggest pet peeves. Why not just have two unisex bathrooms instead?  Things would go much quicker.",0.9886,0.744,0.194,0.062,0.5648148148148148

2006-08-05,4.0,"When I first moved to Lakeview, Stella's was the first place I went to eat in the area, in the midst of an insanely stressful post-move day.  I love going to diners when I'm stressed, as they seem to transport me back to a calm, homey childhood like place...and Stella's was no exception.  The decor is rather simple, with seating for all sizes of groups. Some restaurants make you feel very strange if you're dining alone, but quite a few people seemed to be grabbing a late breakfast or lunch on their own, which was good in this context. Also a lot of couples and friends.   The first time, I had an open-faced turkey sandwich which was a bit better than usual, with tender turkey and real mashed potatoes, although the gravy was a little strangely coloured. Also recently went back with a group of friends for Sunday brunch after Ann Sather's was inpenetrable, and we were not disappointed. Real fresh fruit french toast was delish, and my friend raved about the eggs benedict. Great after a long night!  Service is pretty fast and relatively attentive, and Stella herself seems to be up by the cash register throughout the day, talking to customers and presiding over everything.  Good choice for good food!",0.9909,0.746,0.198,0.055,0.4834047619047619
