The service is also great and quick. We had the Salmon Gone Wild appetizer to start, and it was delicious. This dish consisted of very fresh, thick cuts of salmon with their house made wasabi. It was a great refreshing appetizer. We also ordered a few rolls- Unagi Maki, Halloween Maki, and Rainbow Roll. All were excellent and fresh. Very good fish quality too!  Overall, our experience at Sai Cafe was very satisfying. I was very content with the fresh salmon cuts. Yum!",0.9854,0.682,0.267,0.051,0.5981578947368421

I got my usual at a sushi place, a Chirashi, and it was great. The pieces of fish were like slabs of fish really, cut very thick and neat so you really got your money's worth.

The outside is a bit deceiving as I thought it would be small and basic inside or I wasn't quite sure what to expect. I loved the inside! It was nicely decorated and I felt comfortable at the same time. Boo and I were seated straight back from the entrance, at a table across from the sushi bar top. I enjoyed the curved bench. The other room looked very nice too. Being pretty late imo, many people were still dining. There were a number of dates, a few friend get togethers, and a number of regulars. We got a couple maki rolls, soft shell crab app, tekka-don, and a beef Japanese style fried rice. My tekka-don came with a miso soup and that was very good. The soft shell crab looked amazing and it pretty much was. The vinegar sauce that paired with it was fine, just not my first preference. All the food came out at appropriate times. We enjoyed the fried rice...the highlight here though is definitely their sushi/sashimi. All I can say is...quality! Their fish is super fresh and their rolls are made to perfection. On point with the rice to fish ratio and temperature and cook of the rice. I enjoyed their menu as it wasn't overwhelming but had enough variety. Since I'm a sucker for green tea anything, the green tea crème brulee was a no brainer. Boo got the chocolate mousse. While we agreed the chocolate mousse was good, it wasn't amazing. That crème brulee though was sooooooooo amazing. Green tea flavor was enough for me to taste but not overpowering for my bf. You can taste the delicious eggy flavor as well. The textures were spot on! It was PERFECTION. Best dessert I've ever had? I think we have a winner! Let's not overlook Sai's quality service as well! Definite 5 stars. We were seated and greeted promptly, regularly checked on, waters always refilled, server was helpful and friendly, and the owner I believe even stopped by.  Prices were very reasonable.

2015-08-29,3.0,"Oh Sai. How your star has fallen. Sure, it's still pretty tasty and I will never complain about winding up here with the power old-school combo of KFG and KAM, Sai has started to rest on its laurels a bit too much for my taste.  Came in like a wrecking ball around 8p on a Friday night - business was brisk but not slammed - started with house salad + ginger dressing (duller than I remember) and the ""salmon gone wild"" (belly, salmon roe, flying fish roe, chopped wasabi) - the fish is still fresh, slightly sweet, and lush, but as K remarked, the portion size as diminished slightly over the years - then moved into the toro tartare (tuna + fresh wasabs, black tobiko, and yam chips) - tasty, nice mix of mushy and crunchy, but did my heart pitter-patter with joy? No. In the past have loved the hamachi jalapeno, but I couldn't get any other takers tonight so I had to pass. Eased in to a salmon/avo roll - as expected, was fairly nice - I mean, it's hard to eff up that many glorious omega-3s - but, the rice was a bit off in terms of texture and was so bountiful that it took over the delicacy of the ingredients wrapped inside - also hit a veg roll (spinach, cuc, kampyo, oshinko, asparagus), tasted fine, but again, the rice was running the show instead of what was within. KFG hit the spicy white tuna crunch (roe, scallion, avo, tempura crunch), her perpetual favorite, and KAM went for the halloween maki (salmon, wasabi, tobiko, green been tempura) - both were well enjoyed. Miso is $2, salads are around $7, the sashimi starters are $16-21, hot apps (yako tori, tempura, soft shell) range from $7-14, noodles around $12-15, non-fancy maki are $7-10, fussier choices are $12-14. I don't remember whether it's one or two pieces per order of sush - most clock in at $3-4.

The entrance to the restaurant took me awhile to find since the sign for the restaurant is on the corner of the building but the actual door is on the side. The decor and environment of the restaurant was what you'd expect from a Japanese fusion restaurant though the lighting was a little too dim in my opinion. Now onto the food, we ordered the Tako Sansai as an appetizer which had a very delicious marinade. The yakisoba was good but it wasn't anything special. It seemed more like chow mein than actual yakisoba. The sukiyaki came in a regular bowl but I was hoping for a stone bowl so that the soup would still be kept warm. The actual flavors and ingredients were good though. The dragon maki was actually much better than any dragon maki I've had in awhile so I would recommend getting some sushi here.

2015-04-25,5.0,"Having experienced the best sushi breakfast at Tsukiji Fish Market, I have sadly become a sushi / sashimi snob. So, me giving 5 stars to a Japanese restaurant is extremely rare.  Food: For two people, we ordered the following:  - Seaweed salad - $7: your regular seaweed salad with pickled cucumbers. Nothing was wrong with it.  - Toro Tartar - $19: we wanted to order 2 slices of toro sashimi ($12 each) but was upsold the tartar instead. It came with what I believe were thinly sliced, fried lotus chips as well as black tobiko. The flavor was amazing, melts in your mouth amazing. We tossed everything together with a little bit of soy sauce. The toro did seem slightly cold for my liking, but overall the bites were really delicious.  - Sashimi entree combo - $38: the entree came with tuna, white tuna, escolar, salmon, and hamachi. I prefer buttery fatty raw fish, so really loved the escolar and salmon. Tuna was really fresh compared to other Japanese restaurants I've been to in Chicago. Hamachi was okay, I've had fresher. White tuna was also just okay. I didn't get any ""almost frozen"" fish, or anything that was super fishy.   - Scallop handroll x 2 - $10 each - really amazing. I don't have really good pictures of all the hand rolls because the sushi chef handed them to us one by one. The handrolls were definitely my favorite part of the meal. The scallop handroll had some kind of sweet mayo sauce and avocado in it, so rich and creamy, and great after taste. I'm not even really sure if this is on the menu, but I have seen photos on Yelp and really wanted to try. $10 each is slightly pricey, but worth every single bite.  - Uni handroll x 2 - $14 each - My favorite, and just simply delicious. There was sooooo much uni in every bite and I couldn't get over how good it was. Again, $14 isn't cheap, but really yummy and worth it! - Dragon roll - $14: your regular dragon roll. Eel tasted fresh and cooked with a good bbq flavor. No complaints. Service: - Service was amazing. I loved the hot towel at the beginning of the meal, and I think every other minute someone came over to ask us how our meal went. It was just one of those restaurants where everyone made us feel like we were the center of attention. We went on a Friday night and the place was not extremely busy, but there were also a couple of tables there, yet we still felt like the head sushi chef, the host, and the waitresses were really attentive.  - We sat at the sushi bar and I swear that every time we were taking a bite, the head sushi chef was staring at us to make sure we liked it, and if we had a slight complaint, it was immediately addressed. For example, during one moment I said, ""Oh I want more ginger"". Next thing I know, some ginger dropped magically onto our plates...kind of creepy but also amazing.  Overall, good experienced. For two of us, our bill came out to $140 plus tip. We really enjoyed it, and if I ever feel like splurging on toro and uni, I will know where to go in Chicago.",0.9989,0.73,0.215,0.056,0.5498663976924848

The ratings were solid and it was conveniently located literally steps away from the subway line. The restaurant itself is in a nice neighborhood and the restaurant itself while on the outside looks kinda run down, the interior is nicely decorated. They had hanging chopsticks as decoration and it was pleasantly surprising. We were greeted promptly at the door and immediately seated at our table for our reservation made on opentable. After sitting down, we decided to order hot sake and choose what we wanted to order for food.  We decided to go with the spicy oyster shooters, fried tempura, sashimi plate, and a few rolls. This place is obviously a typical ""Americanized"" sushi joint and the fish was OK but nothing amazing. I also did feel the sashimi was really cold and slightly chewy indicating to me that it was probably frozen and served. The food items were fine again but the oyster shooters just tasted really spicy and the tempura is hard to mess up I feel.

We got the sashimi platter and udon to share between the two of us. The sashimi platter was beautifully done with thick slices of bright, colorful sashimi. Each piece was melt in your mouth delicious except two that seemed to be almost frozen! The udon was also very good with chewy noodles and crispy tempura on the side. I think the broth was a tad bit on the sweet side, but it was still delicious!  I'm so glad I ventured into Sai Cafe and will definitely be back. This is no bootleg AYCE low quality joint; though don't get me wrong- I'm not saying I don't love those places as well (Sushi Para II). Sai Cafe focuses on their quality and it definitely shows.

My friend and I both shared the tempura udon noodles and combination sashimi entrée (white tuna, another white fish, fresh salmon, yellowtail, tuna) and both were very delicious and satisfying. The tempura was nice and crispy, the broth had a lot of depth and was salty and sweet, and the noodles were chewy the way I like them. The sashimi was really fresh (my fav was the white tuna) and each piece was a nice size. This really hit the spot since all the sushi I've eaten lately has been AYCE and the quality is just not up to par to places that are a little more expensive like Sai.

We also had some salmon rolls and tuna rolls. Well, rolls should not be made with minced fish. But they did use minced tuna & salmon, which is not like one for ""negi toro"" because it was not fatty part either.

On the plus side, some of the more exotic slices like saba, ikura and ama ebi were all very fresh - perhaps because they are so infrequently ordered. So the mega-popular cuts are stale, and the slices rarely ordered are fresh - makes a lot of sense, no?  Tuna rolls were also generous and well seasoned. I think it would be amusing to start a sushi restaurant near some of these famous places and put a sign in my window saying ""only fresh cut sushi"" and see how quickly all the other places abandoned the practice.  Pre-cut fish is no better than a steak someone heats to rare in the morning, then reheats for dinner hours later.",0.8048,0.797,0.12,0.083,0.6572916666666667

The crazy maki was so large it was impossible to eat without making a mess and causing a scene. Maybe the name of the roll should be changed to the ""messy maki"". However, the roll was very good and had a lot of fish for the money. The tuna roll was solid, nothing special. My other friends had the volcano roll which they enjoyed and a vegetable noodle dish.

They are friendly, informative and love to tell you about the sushi you are eating. Every time I go, I learn something new about sushi, and try a new piece. If you want a new experience, a different kind of date, or are new to sushi, I definitely recommend asking for a seat at the bar.

I know they've expanded since we've gone but it was pretty big (area wise) when we were there. The service was pretty good and the rolls came out fast and I don't know how they are, but I would have to say, the rolls were HUGE, and by huge, I mean, I think the Chicago maki was probably one of the BIGGEST rolls we've ever had, I literally couldn't put the pieces in my mouth, and half of it would fall out, yeah talk about a classy rice falling out of my mouth look. Not so much. I guess you get your money's worth because the rolls are decently priced and the rolls are big and there was definitely a lot of fish in them which I always prefer, but I guess I am complaining that if you're on a first date, it is not a very sexy look having to shove that huge roll in your mouth, so that did not impress us. Overall, would I come again? Maybe if I was in the area because the sushi was decent, I would just ask the server for suggestions for smaller sized rolls next time, and hope that I would end up happy with my selection. The place has a cute, dim-lit ambiance and fun for a group of friends you feel really comfortable with. Sai, we shall see if if we see you soon for some stellar sushi.

2012-08-01,2.0,"Heard about this place when Zagat released the article ""Chicago's 5 Best Sushi Restaurants"" yesterday (7/31/12) and decided to check it out today. The Good: Spicy Creamy Tako Maki- The flavor was subtle but still bold & good. Flying fish egg & scallions, 2 of my favorites for sushi and they did it well.   Pacific Oyster Shooter- Spicy & good sized. They were delicious. If you're feeling frisky mix a vodka shot with it. Very good. Quick friendly service. Almost too much time at the table on our servers part, but truly can't complain about that! The Bad: Volcano Maki- Not recommended. Waay too strong of a taste with the creamy lobster, kind of taste like miracle whip which was very off putting.  Yaki Tori- Burnt, two tiny skewers, and the tiny veggie cuts have a weird bitterness to them. Chicken was bland.  The Ugly: Soft Shell Crab- Ew. Actually repulsive. Couldn't even finish it and could barely chew it. This is one of those things you can barely describe, it wasn't bland, it wasn't bitter, it was just....a gross injustice. Drinks were waay overpriced and the selection was very small.  Overall the bill for all that, without drinks, was $55. Not too bad a price but I would not come here again for sushi. Definitely nowhere near the sushi I've had at other places.

Don't get me wrong, the food wasn't horrible.  It was average.  I've had sushi just like it plenty of times and I didn't complain.  The problem is:  I've had sushi just like it plenty of times all over the place (and for cheaper).    I'm from Chicago and have lived here most of my life so I'm no sushi expert but I know a few things.  The maki rolls seemed anything but inventive, creative or exceptional.  Excessive use of mayo or any sauces/ spices is going to overwhelm all other ingredients.  Someone should teach a seminar about appropriate amounts of Tobiko and Masago. The fish was fresh enough to eat but I feel it was simply not as good as I was lead to believe.  Why hast thou forsaken me Dolinsky?

My husband and I ordered the following for dinner: Soft shell crab - good, but nothing special($10) Toro tartar - NOT available except weekends!! disappointed :( will try next time Chirashi - very average compared to what I am used to and expecting, but the best out of 3 other places that serve this rice bowl which I have been to so far.  It has one or two pieces of the following:  white tuna, salmon, tuna, yellowtail, cooked shrimp, and i think something else...fish is fresh but not the greatest cut, wouldn't ordered again. ($21) Hamachi-Don - Excellent!!! most likely will be my must-have from now on.  Much better cut than the chirashi, but than this is also more expensive.  I think it has about 7 or 8 big pieces of hamachi ($26) Uni - i have had better, but it is still nice and tasty and best in chicago so far, good when I have a craving for it ($5 a la carte) Ama abi - Excellent!!! The shrimp is very very fresh and most definitely sweet. The fried shrimp head in the vingear sauce is declicious. One small beer. Total with 20% tip is about $100. Service is very attentive, but waitress needs to be careful of almost touching my food with her finger when she puts the plates down. Portion is a bit small, so it is a bit pricey for the price we paid.  BUT at least they serve you FRESH stuff. We sat in the dinning room with the sushi bar, it is nicely decorated, very comfortable atmosphere.  But I would still come back again even if it was just a hole in the wall ;)  So I think I normally would give this place a three star for the good, above average food and everything else, but since it is in Chicago,  I think it deserves a 4-star if others have such low standards.  Good sushi is so hard to find in Chicago!!!!    Keep it up Sai Cafe!

2011-07-24,4.0,"My wife and I are from Japan, grew up in Tokyo. We are temporarily staying in Chicago this year. To be honest, we got disappointed a lot of times since we started living in Chicago with most of Japanese restaurants. But this Sai Cafe is a kind of exception. They are doing a great job. They are using very fresh fishes at the satisfying level even for us Japanese and their chefs certainly have authentic technique to cook rice, flavor it and shape it into Sushi. Especially their Dragon Maki is fantastic. It would be loved even in Tokyo, I assure, since they know what is good eel and how to cook it properly. About Nigiri (usually Sushi, not Rolls) are shaped with very good skill, sushi rice is properly seasoned (actually that is rare here in Chicago), and they are doing a good effort to get fresh fishes as much as possible (we know well we can not expect in Chicago; an inland city as much freshness of seafood as in Tokyo). Apparently they have good chefs and chefs are doing their best in limited environments.   Only one disappointing thing we experienced there is their soups. Both of Miso Soup and Clear Soup is not good. Broth is thin. I couldn't taste soup stock. Miso paste used for Miso Soup is apparently cheap one. Clear Soup has too many ingredients though Clear Soup is supposed to be enjoyed with its taste of soup stock. It tells us that chefs are probably not from Japan. Maybe, they are trained at very professional sushi restaurant somewhere but it seems they have no idea what is the authentic Japanese Miso and Clear Soup. That kind of ignorance can hardly happen to Sushi cooks trained in Japan. I am very sorry for it. I hope they would get a chance to learn about soups from someone, since Miso soup has a strong power, at least for Japanese, to reverse the total evaluation of restaurant. I think so it does for American customers who are familiar with good Japanese foods. (They can get an idea at Oysy. Their Miso soup is much better, though it is a little weird experience for us that they serve their Miso soup at the beginning of lunch course. We have Miso soup 'during' meal, or at the end of meal when we have alcohol).",0.9878,0.824,0.139,0.037,0.5505623973727422

My boyfriend had the volcano maki which was also delicious and spicy and the spicy tuna maki was surprisingly good even though it looked alarmingly raw and red.

However, I will say it's good they have a great bartender on hand as the overall space of the restaurant is cramped. I definitely suggest reservations.

If you're looking for crazy elaborate sushi, this is not your place to hit up. But if you're looking for something to satisfy a simple taste palette, you'll like Sai. These are the kind of sushi spots I prefer because it's minimal. The focus is on the fish, rather than how much spicy mayo one can glob onto a roll of rice and seaweed. They do have those type of rolls, but are limited. I enjoyed all the sushi we ordered. As far as the appetizers go, my favorites were the hamachi jalapeno and the sake kawa.

This is because I came with a gift certificate which I won in a fundraising raffle, which Sai Cafe did not honor. You see, apparently when Sai Cafe donates gift certificates, as they did here, said gift certificates are only valid for 6 months. This despite the fact that the certificate clearly says that it is valid for one year. Apparently they warned the organization for which funds were being raised. I don't recall if the organization warned me in turn. But it doesn't really matter, I still think it's Sai's responsibility to change the language of the certificate. I don't have it in me to demand anything from them that they were nice enough to offer for free to begin with. But they certainly look cheap for offering something and then not following through with the offer. If there was a single cent paid to them, I would consider this a breach of contract.

Big on the actual fresh fish fare and minimal on the flare and soy indulgence so many others seem to think are necessary, the chefs here focus on cutting a prefect sashimi and pairing it with delicately prepared rice that doesn't overwhelm and mask the fish's flavor.

It looks like it will be a small restaurant walking in the door.  Don't be fooled.  There are two other dining rooms through a hallway to the left (although I like the main room more- the other rooms have kind of a weird decor- or at least did the first time I was there a year or two ago).  We came in yoga-ish clothes because we were on our way to a class, and no one even blinked at it- so yes, definitely pleasantly casual.

I remember Sai Cafe being around over 20 years ago long before there was a sushi restaurant  on every corner or every Thai and Chinese restaurant decided to add sushi to its menu. We always sit at the sushi bar and are treated to great service and  guided what fish and rolls to order by Dann our favorite sushi chef. I know that Sai gets whole fish and cuts it to the desired pieces them self I think this is one of the reason all the fish is so fresh. I like rolls but the fish is so good and fresh here I order straight up fish most of the time I had 2 pieces of fish I  had for the first time and loved. I would of never ordered either of these fish unless the sushi chef suggested them to me.  The first fish was salmon let me say I'm not a big salmon lover but Dann insisted and gave me what is called a belly cut of Norwegian salmon it was so sweet mild clean flavor I will never look at salmon the same and until then never even heard of a belly cut. Dann took the whole fillet of salmon and the belly cut and showed me how they fit together. The second fish was Spanish Mackerel mmmm yummy I would of thought this to be a stronger tasting fish but it was mild sweet and creamy. A few other faves I have at Sai  are the Hamachi Jalapeno, the Ahi Poke and the creamy octopus . I like Uni ( sea urchin) my wife does not they made up a beginner  piece for my wife. On top of the rice they place a slice of crab  topped with  uni capped with a slice avocado and a dab of  fish eggs. It had the flavors of uni I love but added  flavors so the uni was not so strong. The restaurant has s nice atmosphere  the people are very friendly and helpful and if you have any questions they are eager to help.

2009-11-29,4.0,"I hadn't been to Sai in years, but I recently took a date to Sai Cafe for dinner, and it was as good as I remember.  From the the prompt greeting as you enter the door, to the excellent attention we received during dinner, the service was excellent.  Since this was a spur of the moment dinner (no reservations), we were pleasantly surprised to find that there were a couple open tables, and we could be seated right away on a Saturday night at 8pm. The food was delicious- there are few sushi places in Chicago that can compare to Sai when it comes to overall consistent quality and presentation.  The fish is so fresh and tender it melts in your mouth.  Two of my pet peeves at sushi places are when the rolls are so big you feel embarrassed to eat them  in front of your date, or that they fall apart when you grab them with chop sticks.  At Sai the rolls are made the perfect size, and they never come apart.   And they don't drown the sushi in sauces or wasabi, they come out with just the right amount of every ingredient so that you can taste each flavor.   The presentation is not flashy, it's simple and understated.  I love when you go to a nicer sushi restaurant and you get a real steamed towel, not the disposable in a wrapper. Yeah, the decor is looking a little dated, but it's a neighborhood institution now, so you have to look at it that way.  It's not meant to be a flashy upscale place like Sushi Samba Rio or Japanais.  The bar up front is small but stylish, the first dining room by the sushi bar is very nice (guys- if you make reservations, ask to sit in this dining room), but the second dining room where we sat is a little older.  Still, it was just fine for a dinner date, with candles on every table and in the windows, and the volume level was perfect for conversation. The price is pretty damn good for a nicer sushi restaurant.  We had edamame, 4 generous rolls, 4 huge pieces, 3 small bottles of hot house sake, and the total was $70+ tip.  Not bad for a date night in the city.  You could easily spend more, that's just what we spent given the rolls and pieces we picked.  And we left stuffed.

I couldn't believe that I had lived in the neighborhood for so long and not known about Sai.  It's very small, but quite and intimate (just the way I like it). Even though we dined on a Friday night, it was busy but never overcrowded. We sat in the back dining room area away from the front door and the kitchen which was nice.  The service was nothing special, but I rarely find the servers in sushi restaurants to be friendly. Our waters were always filled but there were quite a few times when I was looking around for our waitress when I needed a glass of wine.  We started off with the Veggie Tempura which was very good. We tried a variety of rolls. The Crazy Maki, Unagi Maki, Fashion Maki, and Negi Hamachi Maki. Of course it was too much and we had to take some home but everything was fabulous and very fresh.  I give them an A for presentation, service was a C+ at best and the food is A+ for sure.

We had the edamame, miso, and three rolls: Ebi Tempura Maki, Volcano Maki and the Spicy Tuna Maki.  The spicy tuna was about what you'd expect, but the other two rolls were standout.  The Ebi Tempura was a giant sized roll cut into four, which are always fun to enjoy.  The Volcano Maki was very tasty and covered in tempura bits, but it was a bit hard to split because the pieces came piled on each other. Overall, the service and food were good, and the prices were much more reasonable than I expected.  But a word of caution: they don't really give enough wasabi.  I for one love the rush of realizing I had just put a bit too much on a piece of sushi...and the ensuing nasal explosion.",0.9481,0.844,0.107,0.049,0.45527210884353736

The hostess gave me a 20% off appreciation card, so next time I will probably stick to the sashimi and sushi.  I give 3 stars for the appetizers and 4 stars for the sushi.",0.9909,0.778,0.17,0.052,0.45893592004703115

At the beginning of the evening the service was very good. The waitress was knowlegeable and actually knew the difference between white tuna (albacore) and super white tuna (shiro maguro) - a big plus since for some reason I've encountered many sushi waitstaff who do not.   We tried the pan fried scallop appetizer, which was great.  Some of the scallops were more done than others, but none were overcooked and the sauce was not overwhelming. Unfortunately, we did not order any sashimi.  This is a great place for it since the fish was excellent.  The salmon, tuna, super white tuna were all very fresh.  The unagi was crizpy and warm like it should be.  The mackarel was also very fresh, but not as salty as I like it (I think this is just a personal preference though).  The texture of the rice was perfect - it was perfectly sticky and unmangled.  My only complaint with the rice is that it should have had a little more sweetness to it.  Again, perhaps I'm just being picky, because the fish was so great. We tried 2 rolls - the spider roll and the white tuna something something roll.  The rolls were good..the white tuna roll that everyone raves about was ok, but I thought it lacked texture.  Of course that did not stop me from finishing it. My last nitpicky complaint is that some reason, the waitstaff was tough to find at the end of the meal.  I think they were trying to close up the room we sat in and were running around.  Not a big deal at all though.

The folks that frequent Sai are true loyalists.  We go about once a month and sometimes see familiar patron faces. The owner once told me that 80% of his business is repeat.  That's quite impressive seeing as though I view that corner/area as more of a transient population.  The head sushi chef has been around the block as well, having sliced fish on multiple continents. You can probably tell I am fiercely loyal to Sai.  For objectivity...You most certainly can pay 25%+ more at some other Chicago sushi restaurants and get some exotic touches that are personally appealing (whether service, decor, sushi).  This may even equate to a better one-time 'experience' in your book.  But if you had to choose a handful of sushi bars and go 5 times to each one, I think Sai would be your winner on service, freshness and overall consistency.  You walk out the door with a 'value' element as well, which is unique for sushi restaurants of this caliber.  I think thats where Sai is coming from and why I keep going.",0.9791,0.825,0.141,0.035,0.5022108843537415

2008-03-14,2.0,"It was disappointing to see on Yelp that this place was a 4 star place - well as of today anyways.  We were seated promptly even on a friday night at 7pm.  I'm not sure why the place would get crowded or take reservations because there are far better sushi places in the city.  Our waitress was a little lacking in patience when we were indecisive about what we wanted to order.  We did start out with some miso soup, and it was kind of gritty in the end, which was kind of surprising.  We ordered the Rainbow Maki, Volcano Maki, Halloween Maki, and an Unagi maki.  Typically this would be more than enough, but it didn't feel very filling.  The makis themselves didn't have any unique flavor or taste to them.  It was kind of ehhh.  There's nothing special about this place that makes it stand out, nothing unique on the menu or anything at all.  My friend had to ask for water several times even though she first asked for a pitcher.  She does typically drink a whole pitcher of water when we go out to eat.  The prices are kind of expensive for some makis.  I think some were $7 or $8 for something simple (unagi or california roll) that I've seen for $5 or $6.  The owner seemed really nice.  He seems to make his way around to say hi to everyone and is generally pretty friendly.  Unfortunately that's not enough to make me come back or recommend this place.",0.9444,0.865,0.094,0.041,0.6366931216931219
2008-02-20,3.0,"The fish here is fresh.  But Sai probably should be relegated to local sushi shop status rather than a destination. The menu, as many have mentioned is pretty old-school, nothing particularly fancy - although the dynamite and the tora nome (tiger eyes) definitely caught my eye on the hot appetizer list, but the one appetizer ordered, the seaweed salad was no good. I brought out the usual measuring stick - chirashi.  Fish was large and juicy, but the sushi rice...couldn't quite put my finger on it, it wasn't particularly mushy or hard or too vinegary, but something wasn't quite right. Another barometer I like to use is the ubiquitous California roll - I'll never order it but if it's incidental to someone's order I'll try it.  Granted, it's not really Japanese, but you figure if they don't make that right, well, it's not a good sign!  They used fake crab, and they put way too many cucumbers in there, was not good.   The volcano roll was a nice concept and well presented, but it was a tad too creamy.  Likewise, the spicy white tuna crunch also looked nice, and as Bethany L mentioned, the tempura flakes were a nice touch, but the tuna itself was weird (def not on par w/the white tuna sashimi in my chirashi) and not spicy enough. Service was pretty good, water was refilled multiple times, and while doing my usual ritual of trying to remember all my nihongo for the various fish, the manager/hostess noticed and came over and pointed out what was what, so that was nice. Overall, solid place for fish.  If it's rolls you want, head over to Sushi Wabi.",0.9912,0.787,0.178,0.035,0.516421568627451

Let's see shall we?** *** So Sai Cafe was one of the first sushi joints I ever tried in Chicago. I lived down the street, it was convenient and the sushi was surprisingly good. You'd never know it from the interior since it hasn't been updated since the early 90's. But the Halloween maki rocks, the Baby Salmon Sashimi is melt-in-your-mouth good and the Kani-su with huge real alaskan king crab is ahhmazing! Confucius Say: good fresh sushi in ugly surroundings much better than bad sushi on fancy lucite stool. **Ok, so I would have left my review at that and amply succeeded with my goal but a quick peek at their website has left me thinking they may have undergone a renovation recently since it doesn't look the same old Sai Cafe. Pretty back-lighting and geometric ceiling decor. Huh?? They are also touting a new location in Logan Square called Hachi's Kitchen which must have shiny new interiors since its, well, new. So maybe those are the pics I saw. I will research and update, but in the meantime you still won't go wrong with their sushi offerings so give it a try.  ***I'm a complete failure.",0.9155,0.827,0.124,0.049,0.46705447330447336

2008-02-02,3.0,"Sai Cafe is odd. We have a friend in from out of town who originally wanted deep dish pizza, but we managed to talk her into some good sushi, instead. Sai Cafe is right around the corner and I'd never tried it, and after seeing the reviews here we figured it was worth a shot. We got there right after they opened for dinner (about 4:45), so the place was totally empty. While generally I would think was a good thing, allowing my friends & I to catch up in peace, it turned out to be a little strange. I guess because the place was empty, we had about 5 different waitresses sicked on us. They would show up about every 2 minutes to ask if everything was okay. They would constantly refill waters even after we said that we didn't want anymore. When my roommate joined us, they immediately brought her a hot towel. She  took a few minutes to take off her coat and hug our visiting friend - and the waitress showed up, rather impatiently, to push the hot towel toward her and make her wash her hands. Perhaps the most bizarre thing was that toward the end of the meal, as my roommate was wiping her face with her napkin, one of our many waitresses came over and pulled the napkin OUT OF HER HANDS, then folded it onto the table and walked away. It was so damn weird. The sushi was pretty decent. The bagel roll was better than I thought it would be, with a good ratio of cream cheese and salmon, but the salmon was a little tough. I also got the spicy white tuna crunch rolls, and the tempura flakes were a lot better than what most places stick on their sushi, but the tuna was very mushy and the spicy sauce not extremely flavorful. My roommate was unimpressed with her tempura; she said it was too oily and soggy. Gyoza was really great, though. I think I would stick to ordering takeout from Sai if I did business with them again. My friend and roommate literally ran out of there exclaiming ""Get me out of crazy town!"" It was a bizarre experience.",0.9839,0.775,0.141,0.085,0.5606516290726816

2007-11-01,5.0,"I would like to start off by saying that.... Sai Cafe is my FAVORITE restaurant. (and this is a really long review) They deserve an indefinite amount of stars. yes. really. I've been here more than 3 dozen times and they always know how to treat me tummy good. real good. I love fish. I love raw fish. Sai has plenty of it... Generous cuts that are so fresh and buttery soft that I could just gobble it all up. I always order a sashimi platter when I dine here...Slices of glistening hamachi and sake placed in front of me....no... nothing else makes me more excited.  Sai Cafe makes the best Toro Tartare appetizer. In fact, I love it so much I wouldn't mind naming my first child Toro... or Tartare (I'm pretty sure my future husband wouldn't enjoy it all that much though). If I could, I wouldn't share a single piece of it with anyone. Next best appetizer goes to their Oyster Shooters. Those things are orgasmic. I've had them at Bob Sans and Matsuyas before and they have nothing on Sai. The oysters are cold and fresh and the sauce compliments the flavors so well...*drools* The Soft Shell Crab appetizer here is pretty good too. They do a great job on frying them, crispy without being oily. It comes with this light and crisp cucumber type dipping sauce that goes really well with the soft shell crabs.  For Maki, I usually order the White Tuna Crunch and Volcano Roll (obviously very popular here judging from all the other Yelp reviews...). Both are yummy and plated really well but I'm not much of a roll person... I end up still ordering them anyways... I love Uni. Sai always serves up the freshest, sweetest pieces of Uni. They also have a yummy Yaki Soba and Udon that I order from time to time to fulfill my noodle cravings. I would also recommend the Dynamite, Goy-Za, and Scallop appetizers but you have to try the Toro Tartare and Oyster Shooters before you order anything else (or I'll be mad at you). I'm impressed that their entrees are so nicely prepared too. I had their Sea Bass and Teriyaki Chicken entres. Usually Japanese restaurants are either good at sushi or their hot dishes and Sai perfects both with such ease  For dessert, they have an awesome Green Tea Crme Brule and Chocolate Mousse cake (comes in the shape of a pyramid. Awesome!). I've also had their Mochi and ice cream. All recommended.  The Dimly lit rooms and exposed brick walls make the restaurant so inviting. It's quiet enough for people around the table to hear you and noisy enough to know that everyone is having fun and the table over isn't listening in on your conversations. The waitresses are great and the service is prompt. Once in a while, the owners would move from table to table for a little conversation and make sure everything is going good.  I'm a bit hesitant writing this review. I can usually get a table here on Fridays and Saturdays being a walkin so I hope you Yelpers dont fill up all the ables before I get there.... grrr.

2007-01-10,5.0,"Easily one of my top sushi places.  The sushi is always fresh and moderately priced.  The atmosphere is warm, low-key, and inviting with various different rooms throughout the restaurant.  They have a bar as soon as you walk in which is a great spot to have a drink while waiting for any of your party to show up.  It's a welcome change from many other sushi joints featuring typical modern decor with loud dance music.  My favorites include the spicy white tuna crunch (awesome!), unagi-don, white fish tempura, and escolar nigiri.",0.9665,0.768,0.232,0.0,0.5504901960784314

2006-11-08,5.0,"This is my most reliable sushi place.  It is good quality at a great price.  At Sai Cafe it is all about the Escolar.  It is a super white tuna that melts in your mouth.  They have the best Escolar that I have tasted.  The rolls are great and they have new special rolls all the time.  The wine list is good and reasonably priced as well and they have an extensive list of sakes.  The staff is always very friendly in here...they greet you when you enter and as you leave.  The restaurant is large too so it allows for a lot of customers at once.  I have never eaten something that I didn't like here.  Last night I had their Escolar roll (I know, I really am obsessed!) that had jalapenos and cilantro in it, which was really good.  Highly recommended.  In the summer they have a nice patio set up as well.",0.9905,0.737,0.244,0.019,0.5479585326953746

We used to live near there an go to the restaurant and eat, we went so often that the owner always stopped by our table to chat, he taught us a few things when we sat at the bar. I highly recommend Sai, the food is fresh and inventive and you can't beat the prices for the quality they serve. We still order from there at least once a month...
