Gyros sandwich tasted fine but very skimpy. Here's the kick. Small soda served loaded to brim with ice so needed refill by the time the soup even arrived! Drank refill with soup but if I wanted another refill you will have to pay for it again!! Cmon are u nuts!!! So bill came to $12.87 before a $2 tip !!!$  It's a skimpy Greek Gyros so I suggest you go to a GOOD GYROS sandwich shop which atte plentiful as we all know and save yourself big$$$$,0.9506,0.771,0.168,0.061,0.37454545454545457

I should have left a review years ago but after receiving yet another fantastic meal today I decided it was time to give them their well deserved 5 stars. My husband loves their perfectly cooked and well portioned gyro. Always good quality. My obvious favorite is saganaki. It's pretty easy to mess up, but they always cook it to perfection, nice and golden. Their house made tzaziki is the best I have ever had (and I really try it from any Greek establishment I visit). Chicken Raganati is never disappointing and the lemon sauce they put on their side of rice is soo flavorful i think i could drink it. I have never received a wrong order or anything missing. They have great service (Pat used to be my favorite waitress) and the owner is just always so sweet. They have done some remodeling over the years but have kept their traditional wall that just gives me a wonderful nostalgic feel when i walk in.

2016-09-06,5.0,"My family has been coming to Central gyros for over 20+ years and with every subsequent visit, they've never failed to disappoint us. The main reason for the five stars is due to their consistency in providing quality gyros paired with efficient service. The owners and staff are super nice and they always greet us when we come in through their doors; making us feel welcome and at home.  Naturally, over the years the menu prices have increased. Despite the inflation, the gyros plate is definitely worth the money. The gyros plate offers double the meat; so you know your getting the most for what you pay. Their gyros are moist and seasoned to perfection. The tzatziki sauce is also worth mentioning. The rich and creamy tzatziki sauce is incomparable to others I have tried. It's nice and thick; with just the right amount of tang. My only critique on the gyros was I wished they were a bit more crispy on the edges. Perhaps that's personal preference but besides that, their gyros are extremely enjoyable! The interior space is substantial and can hold about 60-75 people comfortably. The busboys constantly make rounds to sweep the floor, wipe down, and clear the tables; ensuring an eating space that is clean and odor free. Vibrant Greek themed woodwork can be seen on almost every wall. There is also a full service bar in the restaurant serving up drinks and cocktails. Metered street side parking is available.

2016-08-05,4.0,"I saw an episode of ""Chicago's Best"" almost four (4) years ago featuring Central Gyros.  At that time I didn't really call myself a foodie and and thought a can of Campbell soup would be much better than a poppin' hot homemade Gyros plate.   Sorry, folks.  I'm now a changed person, or at least I can say I've changed a lot since moving to Chicago.  ""Central Gyros"" is one of many restaurants I pass by on Central frequent, yet tonight hubby and I walked into this place for the very first time.  I brought several ""uninvited"" guests to dine with us as well: pidgey, rattata, drowzee, jynx, eevee, and spearow.   As many of you may have figured it out, ""Central Gyros"" is a poke stop.  Let's just say this in unison: Oppa'a!   We ordered one of the most popular appetizers: saganaki, or Greek-style pan-fried cheese.  There was a wedge of lemon on the side, and I squeezed some lemon juice on top of the saganaki.  It was quite delectable.   I must admit that their gyros plate is a little on the pricier side, but the portion is large enough to split into two (2) meals.  The gyro meat was delicious, so was the tzatziki sauce.  I could tell the quality of everything was superb.  Service was also very prompt and responsive.  In addition, the boss did a round of greeting to each table to ensure that everyone of us enjoyed the meal.  The total for a gyros plate, a vegetarian plate, and an order of saganaki came to $31 and some change.  I didn't know how hubby was able to finish his veggie plate.  He should know that Rosa J. isn't going to wake up early on her day off to fix him some breakfast, and he better not to touch her leftover gyros!",0.9901,0.856,0.135,0.009,0.49623015873015874

Braised Lamb - a whole shank, with some of the tomatoey sauce it was braised in, and potatoes and rice.  Everything was good but shanks are always my fave!  LOVED this.

The pita is browned to perfection with butter, and they have the best creamiest sauce. Central gyros meat is too gray. I did love that it was shaved because I like my meat very thin. The portion was skimpier than I am used to. The raw onions were cut just right. My mother had hers with grilled onions, and they have the best cut grilled onions I have ever seen; perfectly thin. The sauce was fine, but it could have been creamier and more flavorful. The pita was not browned the way I like, it was too soft. I ordered a chicken Souvlaki and I would not order it again. The portion of chicken was so skimpy it made me mad, and there was too much pita bread for the amount of meat. The chicken itself could have used more seasoning. The cheeseburger was OK. The beef tasted more like a fake pepper steak burger out of a box.  The onion rings are SO SO good.  The delivery fee is $4, which is too high in my opinion.

Waitress arrived promptly and was also very pleasant. No complaints so far... We started with some mandatory saganaki (OPA!) which was then quickly followed by a gyros platter.  Taste wise, it was everything you could ask for and this is how gyros should be served to the public. But one complaint I have to bring up is the small portion of gyros meat/lamb they provided.  When paying over $11 for a gyros platter, they simply do not provide enough lamb!  From the comments on Yelp, it appears they used to offer much more and may have scaled back as of late.

2013-05-19,2.0,This place used to be great a long time ago. But on my last three visits the experience was less than enjoyable. Mly last visit was the first week on May/2013. I was the only diner. I asked for the Gyro sandwich deluxe special. Although the meat was plentful it wasn't hot and the pita bread was not even fried in a little of oil as I've seen in other places. Fries tasted like they've been under a heat lamp for awhile. It's only because I didn't know of any other decent place in the area and it was on my travel bus route. Would I return?

Also, they have a ridiculous delivery range, and will happily tote your food to all corners of the earth. One thing I noticed in there - EVERYBODY gets the saganaki.

2012-07-07,4.0,"It's good to know some places are just as good- or better than you remember!  Last night, this was put to the test.  We started our night at Ambrogio's, but didn't manage to eat much of anything (see my most recent review for further explanation), so we took a short drive to my ""other fail safe""- Central Gyros.  We were so glad we decided to come back! We kept dinner very simple.  A slice of Spinach Pie, the Gyros Combo Plate and some Baklava.  Everything was delicious, but the Gyros are the real star.  In Chicago, we can usually find Gyros on almost every corner, but Central Gyros perfected the process- Nicely spiced meat, thinly sliced, browned lightly on a flattop, and then piled high on a toasty pita.  One one to describe it?  NIIIICCCCEE! Now ordering the combo plate allows you to tap into meat-ecstasy by giving you: Gyros Meat, Souvlaki, a Piece of Greek Sausage and a nice portion of big and crisp steak fries.  It is a simple plate, but a nice wave of flavor. It was perfect to compliment the spinach pie. Unlike Spanakopita at most other Greek restaurants, Central Gyros makes their spinach pie round... Well, like a a pie and then they serve you a nice sized wedge of spinach, feta, phyllo glory.  Its thick enough to share between two people, but not too dense either.  It is really a happy union of dough, cheese, spinach and Greek goodness. Despite eating through most of their menu over the course of many years (nothing EVER disappointed by the way) and always leaving satisfied, I haven't been here in a few years due to moving out of the neighborhood.  It's a bit of a pity, since the food is still solid after all of these years and I feel like I had overlooked it's overall goodness.

2012-02-21,3.0,"One comment from our group was that we got short-changed when the saganaki was set aflame (in comparison to some of the explosions taking place for other tables). But that's not the reason why I only gave it 3 stars. Central Gyros is just too brightly lit! Maybe with less candle power in the overhead lighting, that flaming cheese appetizer would have seemed more impressive? It is one big room. It has eye-catching 3-D murals. It is clean and not too noisy. All of this is very good. Plus, you can park free at the city garage structure just across the street. We were entrusted to a friendly and conscientious waitress who had a Greek accent, but could easily have been mistakened for someone's Polish babka (perfect for this neighborhood!). We will all fondly remember and come back for their fried kalamari appetizer, which many among us thought was the best they'd ever had. Their dolmades were al dente outside, but a bit mushy inside. Many of us had the gyros plate or the even larger, gyros combo plate (with added slices of sausage and skewer roasted pork souvlaki), both good bargains and tasty too. The broiled salmon filet was thoroughly enjoyed and consumed. And the Fisherman's Plate was also a winner (although inexplicably, the fried squid there was different than the kalamari appetizer). The one odd dish was their pastisio, usually a modest loaf of creamy, cheesy macaroni-like noodle and ground beef. Central presents an intimidating 8-inch cube of this traditional Greek recipe. Be ready to take part of that home. This has long been the Greek outpost among the Polish and Mexican eateries in this very old neighborhood.

2011-12-22,4.0,"Normally most of the rating I give comes from the flavor of the food and other details such as service, cleanliness, portion size and ambiance although important are details that I factor in but not too heavily.  On this review though I'd say the food flavor was a 3 star experience and the other details are what pushed it up to an overall 4 star rating. I really really want to be blown over by this place because of some of the exceptional reviews I've read here on Yelp.  I even waited to review it until I'd tried it 4 times to make sure I was correct in my assesment of it.  I've only tried the Gyros so that is the only food flavor I'm basing the flavor portion of this review on. The gyros have a good flavor.  Certainly nothing to complain about, but nothing to excite me or motivate me to take visitors from out of town there.  Like I mentioned I'd give the flavor a 3 star A-OK rating. What has impressed me is portion size.  I always order an extra pita bread because the gyro is piled so high with meat that it easily makes 2 gyros for me and I have a pretty healthy sized appetite.  I certainly feel I get a huge bang for my buck when I order here! Also very notable are some other factors.  I'm a huge fan of good friendly service and everytime I've gotten food here the service has been extremely friendly.  At some restaurants a carryout customer doesn't get the same level of friendly service as dine in customers but not here.  I always feel like the people I'm interacting wtih really appreciate my business and are happy I'm there.  The management here has done a fine job of putting together a good staff. Although I haven't dined in yet here while waiting for my order (which is never a long wait) I always observe the dining area to check it out.  I'm impressed with what I see!  It's a very nice restaurant that as far as appearance goes I would not hesitate to bring family or friends too.  The tables not being used are always cleaned up and the place basically just looks really sharp. Next time I visit Central Gyro I will order something other than the gyro and I will dine in.  With all the postitive things this restaurant has going for it I wouldn't be surprised if next time I review this restaurant I'll maybe be able to give it's flavors a stronger rating and maybe even bump up the overall rating a little.",0.9983,0.764,0.215,0.021,0.5788314758527524

You see, prior to the Whole Foods crowd cutting in on our dandelion green supply, the Greeks have always known that dandelion greens are soo good for you. They also are about as close as you can get to Greek soul food.  But I digress..The fried zucchini, and eggplant are lightly dusted with flour, no heavy bread-y Italian seasoned coating. The same goes for their fried ""kalamaria""- and that means the whole calamari, including the crunchy tentacles..no bready calamari rings here. Granted, it is not my mother's cooking, but frankly, most foods like pastichio, mousaka, spanakopita, etc., are so labor intensive, I don't cook them myself. So go and get your all American gyro sandwhich, which, by the way, is something Greeks never, ever, make at home. I mean, cooking on a spit is traditional, but it really is something Greeks did traditionally on Easter, in the Greek countryside, as part of a major feast that would feed part of the village. But go ahead and order a gyro, and ask for the pita to be well grilled, and the meat to be seared well, with the fixings on the side. But I also ask that you consider trying the Greek sausage which is sweet and fatty, butterflied..or the trimmed lamb chops, charred..and order some greens, fried calamari, or bakaliaro (salted cod), saganaki (fried salty cheese to be shared), skordalia (garlic dip) taramosalata (pink roe/caviar), grilled octopus, and so many other dishes that central Gyros does a pretty good job cooking.

It had been at least 10 years since I had eaten here so I decided to see how it's doing now. Yeah, the Gyros is still pretty decent, but I have a few minor complaints and pointers. A)They put a lot of Tzatziki sauce on the Gyros, so either ask for it on the side or for them to go easy on it if you don't like a large portion. The Tzatziki sauce is some of the best I have ever had anywhere. B)The Gyros meat was a bit luke-warm when it arrived. I don't like things piping hot and then you have to wait 5-10 minutes before eating, but this Gyros could have been a little warmer. C)The Gyros meat portion size was lacking for the price (almost $7 after tax.) If there was more meat on it it would be much more worth it. The meat was cooked just right however-not overcooked or undercooked like many places. Bonus points for not being greasy. D)The pita bread seemed really fresh and was nice and warm.

We ordered take out from there last night. Maybe its the type of restaurant you have to eat in for the food to be good, but I'm kind of guessing not.  We ordered gyros plates, saganaki, and the fish roe salad (taramasalata). The gyros was greasy and, I think, not heated on the grill prior to being sliced off the spit.

It was quite empty though and we were seated right away, with glasses of water to sip on. There are a lot of lunch specials that are good deals for what you get. Our waitress was super friendly. I ordered the baked lima bean special with a greek salad. I forgot to ask for the dressing on the side and it was unfortunately completely drenched. They were a bit stingy with the feta cheese, just one piece in the whole salad! The baked lima beans were new to me, I decided to be brave. They seemed more like fava beans - they were huge! Served in a tomato based sauce with onions and dill. I liked it, and it was a very large portion - I definitely had leftovers for another day. One coworker ordered the chicken breast sandwich special which came in a pita with large fries and a cup of lentil soup. The soup tasted as if it were out of a can. The chicken sandwich looked great and the fries were terrific. Other coworker ordered the fish filet sandwich w/fries and a cup of soup special. He got the lemon rice soup which he really enjoyed.

2010-11-18,3.0,"Every once in a while, I jump on the ""Check Please"" bandwagon and try a place that's been featured on the show. Recently, Central Gyros was on, and it sounded good and touted large portions. I met my main squeeze for dinner there last night. One mistake I'll never make again is driving down Belmont Avenue in rush hour to get there, but after traversing the strip known as Little Warsaw, I am pretty sure I am now fluent in Polish, so there's that. Anyway, street parking is quite easy on this stretch of Central, so that is one thing it has going for it. We sat down around 7, and I was a little surprised that this place wasn't busier on a Wednesday night, at prime dinner hour, especially after just  being on ""Check Please"", but it did eventually get busier. The saganaki was purportedly very good and evidently was a bigger portion than what you'd get at a standard Greektown restaurant, so we started with that. While it was good, it was by no means any larger than what I'm used to. We also ordered cups of Avgolemono (egg-lemon soup) and my bf was intrigued by the beer choices. He figured ""when in Rome"" and wanted to try a Greek beer. And that is exactly how it was listed on the menu: ""Greek beer,"" it had no name. He's the adventurous type so he ordered it anyway. It turned out to be ""Aris"" and was pretty much the equivalent of a Greek MGD. We got the soup and while mine was piping hot, my bf's was tepid at best, which was strange. The soup was good, but I've certainly had better. For our entrees, we decided to split the much-lauded gyros sandwich as well as a chicken shish kebob dinner. The shish-kebob dinner came with soup, which the waitress tried to serve us. Explaining that we already had soup, we asked her if she couldn't simply charge us for just one of the soups we already had. She seemed confused by this, but then agreed. Both the sandwich and the shish kebob were good, but not mind-blowing. Again, I was expecting bigger portions. I also thought the kebob would have had more to it than chicken and onions, like maybe peppers or tomatoes, but it didn't, and the rice that came with it had a weird gravy on it, not the usual tomato-based sauce I am accustomed to. The server was really sweet and friendly and seemed to know many of the customers. The food was decent. I really have no complaints about the place, but I'm not sure I'd be squealing with delight at the idea of coming back here. It's a good option on the NW side, but I'm certainly not willing to brave the drive through Warsaw again to go here.",0.9965,0.789,0.164,0.048,0.521560347409404

On the show, they said the restaurant arguably had the best gyro in the city, so my expectations going in were very high. Unfortunately, I was a little disappointed. I was expecting to be blown away, but instead I thought it was just OK.  For an appetizer, we ordered the Saganaki, which I will say was very delicious. For the main course, I ordered the standard Gyros Sandwich, and my husband ordered the Gyros Plate. Normally, you get a lot more meat with the gyros plate than the sandwich, but in this case, the meat portions seemed too similar given the price difference ($6 for the sandwich and $11 for the plate). The gyros meat was tasty, but I wasn't blown away. The Tzatziki Sauce was good, but I didn't feel like there was enough poured onto my sandwich. My husband's gyros plate came with two small containers of the sauce, which wasn't enough. I suppose we could have asked for more, but I just hate it when places skimp on the sauce. A friend who accompanied us to Central Gyros ordered the Braised Lamb, which came with Egg Lemon Soup. He said both were very good. Central Gyros' decor is warm and welcoming, and I really liked the colorful 3D murals that are etched into the walls with interesting textures. There are no booths in the restaurant; only table seating is available. You can also order food for carryout.  Overall, I wasn't too impressed with Central Gyros.

After much reviewing I decide on Central Gyros Restaurant in the Cragin neighborhood.  My wife and I use to stop here back when we were dating, over 25 years ago.  We have gone several times since then, but it has been a while. We start with two orders of Saganaki (Flaming Cheese).  This is the BEST!  It starts to bring back the old memories.  The seven of us polish off the Saganaki in no time.  Next we have the Fish Roe Salad (Delicate Dip of Whipped Fish Roe or Fish Eggs).  It is a pink colored spread that is sooo light and delicate.  We use four baskets of bread to finish off the Fish Roe between the seven of us.  We also ordered five bowls of the Egg Lemon soup.  It is a Greek Lemon soup with Orso or Rice mixed in.  It is light on the lemon and continues the wonderful tastes and memories. On to our main course meals.  My oldest son orders the half slab of BBQ Ribs with thick cut French Fries and Coleslaw.  He says it is good, the BBQ sauce is a bit spicy, but otherwise good.  My youngest daughter orders Chicken Tenders served with thick cut French Fries.  She also said her Chicken Tenders were good.  Good old Dad gives them a try and has to agree, they are good.  My youngest son orders his usual, a 1/4 Lb. Cheeseburger with Melted American Cheese, Lettuce, Onions, Tomatoes, Pickle and those thick cut Fries.  He polished off that Cheese Burger in no time flat.  I thought he must have inhaled that burger! My wife, my oldest daughter, her boyfriend and I all ordered the Gyro Sandwiches (which is a combination of Beef and Lamb finely seasoned and fried to succulent perfection!  Then sliced and served on Pita Bread with Onions, Tomatoes and Tzatziki Sauce, a type of cucumber sauce).  Maria and I went light on the Onions, and our oldest daughter went without the Onions and Tomatoes.  Our daughter's boyfriend also had a side order of those thick cut French Fries. The restaurant was half full on this Father's Day.  As we came in everyone greeted me with a ""Happy Father's Day"".  The wait staff were attentive and friendly.  The owner even stopped by a few times just to make sure everything was fine and going well.  There was free off street parking right across the street.  I even got to watch portions of the Brazil and Ivory Coast World Cup match.  This was truly a GREAT Father's Day! Our total bill came to roughly $97 dollars, which I thought was reasonable for seven of us with three appetizers and five soups.  Also with the seven main course dinner orders.  It came to less than $14 dollars a person, on average.  The service was friendly and prompt.  And with the free parking right across the street, I highly recommend Central Gyros.  You don't need to head to Greektown to get high quality Greek food, at reasonable prices, with friendly service.",0.9976,0.796,0.159,0.045,0.4255843110190935

Details: Went for the free Kronos gyros day (yay!).  Normally, I'd expect restaurants to give me an attitude about anything free or discounted.  NOT HERE!  Our waitress was soooooo nice to us.  I didn't feel like I was supposed to order more items from the menu so she could make a bigger tip (you know you've felt that way!)  And when an elderly woman came in, she was promptly escorted to a table near us and they answered all of her questions about the free gyros in the most gentle and pleasant voices.  They explained she didn't have to order anything else but if she did, her gyros wouldn't be on the check.  If she only ordered a gyros, she wouldn't pay a cent.   Maybe I'm overly excited b/c I was so surprised about the cuteness and friendliness that I had received that day.  If anything, go for the food.  They made my gyros exactly like I wanted, well done so it has crispy edges, on top of a soft, pillowy flat bread.  Drool!   The saganaki was super delish, lemony, salty, cheesy, flaming ;)  The fries weren't bad - typical steak fries, of which I'm not a fan.  But I'm coming back for more!",0.9918,0.78,0.196,0.024,0.6129365079365081

2009-02-02,4.0,"I was shopping grocery stores in the 1987 Sprint on the northwest side of Chicago (& River Grove) on Friday. Returning to the domicile here, I figured I had missed dinner and should bring something back to eat. My last grocery was the A & G Fresh Market. I snaked south on Central, parked in the concrete garage, and came here. Central Gyros has been around a long time. I am certain it was in business thirty years ago. I am mildly surprised it does not herald this in its advertising. Then again, I seldom eat|ate here. When younger, and shopping at Belmont & Central (haplessly, not even the concrete parking garage constructed in 1983 has helped it maintain a base of shops ~ if you want to study a faltering business district; here it is), I usually wound up at one of the fast food outlets along Central, or _Jerry's_ [now defunct] at Belmont & Luna. In my mindset, a place calling itself a ""restaurant"" meant higher prices and inherent tipping. I was also unfamiliar with *gyros*. My taste horizons have expanded over the years [good for me], and I decided to give Central Gyros a shot. Gyros have muscled their way into my pantheon of foodstuffs. Lamb is not pork. I had read elsewhere that the gyros here were above average. I had take-out. This is a regular dine-in restaurant with a sufficient amount of tables to accomodate up to 75 people, and an extensive menu. It will even do catering. I ordered the gyros sandwich without tomatoes. The slivered onions were very fresh. The tzatziki {there's a word to remember for Scrabble®} sauce was on the creamy side. I would have liked more of it. The gyros were quite good. The blend of beef & lamb was succulent, and there was a good amount of it in the pita. This costs $5.95. This is in line with most of its other sandwiches. Dinners (which include french fries | rice, and soup [salads are $2 extra]) cost $10.25 - $20.95. I've had gyros at smaller take-out stands like Kings' #2 and a now-defunct stand which was just up Belmont Ave. from here. (It closed; was torn down; and the lot now has a Dunkin' Donuts.) I scribe this ranks highly amongst the others I have had. I am giving it four stars because its value is average. One of these days I hope to find a five-star gyros venue. Transit options: This is easy. The #77 Belmont bus and the #85 Central bus run during all the hours that this is open. Walk one block south from Belmont, or egress the Central bus at Barry Ave. It is on the east side of Central Ave.",0.9582,0.903,0.073,0.024,0.39966450861799696

2008-03-23,4.0,"I went to Central Gyros a few years ago and remembered trying a salad with Feta Cheese for the first time. I learned I wasn't a fan of feta cheese then. Today, though, I suggested to my family to go to the restaurant for Easter Sunday. Aside the salad, I've only had gyros as part of my Greek food experiences...and those were at local burger joints that had gyros. So my review on the food here is a stepping stone to other Greek restaurants and tastes. Anyway, here goes: Description of the interior of the restaurant: You walk in and to your right is a bar, not sure about the selection though. Didn't take details about the decor but aesthetically, it was decorated enough to be pleasing and positive. Since we [or me] had never actually experienced Greek restuarants I asked our server what she recommended. She suggested the saganaki, which almost 95% of the people in there order, the Spinach pie for those who like spinach and cheese, and Fried Zucchini and/or Eggplant. She also suggested something with fish but warned since we were still new, that it has an obvious fish taste. So my family went with the Saganaki. The saganaki appetizer - it's fried cheese that they light aflame right before serving and shout ""Opa!"" It was hot [not spicy hot], tasty, and delicious. The loaf of bread they gave us was room temperature - some people like theirs warm but I didn't mind it. It was soft, not crunchy, and for 5 people it was gone within minutes. Next I had some chicken and rice soup, not sure what the name of it was but it was really lemony. I repeat - really lemony. Tasted fine for me though and it was piping hot. Then came the Pastitio. I didn't expect it would be so huge! It looked about 2-3 inches thick and a 3x3 inch piece. Never tried it in my life. It looked to be a Greek lasgana and the taste was different. Can't really describe it - it's different.  Finally the desert, I had some creme caramele [sp?]. It looks like lecheflan/flan but it doesn't taste like it. It's not creamy, more a jelly texture and not as sweet as flan. It was good though. Yum. Also! The women's bathroom was clean and decorated. Greek music played overhead and it was a one person stall. So overall, this for me is 4 stars. The food tasted good and our server was very welcoming and helpful with our first time visit.

2005-08-02,4.0,"Their gyros is awesome - I'd recommend asking for extra tomatos. Their menu is obviously more involved and they make great saganaki. The restaurant is a great place to bring the family out to dinner as the decor is very vibrant and fun. The staff is great and the prices are completely reasonable. They have desserts, too, that are ready to be picked up and taken home.",0.9829,0.665,0.335,0.0,0.5583333333333333
