When I finally got my food, the presentation of my sashimi plate was disgusting. It looked like it came on a clear ugly microwave plate. The cuts of the sushi were so crappy you could barely grab them with the chopsticks. My boyfriend got his food 30 minutes (panang curry, which was so gross) before mine and was nearly done by the time mine came. It's just not a good quality place. Bathrooms were super grimy and walls were not clean. Thank god I got a groupon and just paid tax on this meal. Crappiest sushi and service we've ever had. Don't come here!

The chicken fried rice, and Tofu fried rice is what we got, both were very fresh. Not a ton of butter, so no upset stomachs. Also worth noting the portion size was not very large, so if you are looking to binge out, you might want to order something else to split.

As a big time sushi fan, I immediately went for the Japanese menu (they have a Thai one here too - I'll have to try that out next time).  Let me tell you, the sushi tasted wonderful, the presentations were well put, and everything, down to the little plate the bill came on seemed well thought out.   So... Food looks good....  Does it taste good?  Why, yes it did!  We ordered a few different rolls - all were tasty (tho' the specialty rolls had more oomph obviously).  We also decided on a few pieces of sashimi.  The fish (roll or sashimi) tasted fresh, and was quite delicious.  The one thing about the sashimi pieces, that I will remember for next time?  These pieces were HUGE.  Much bigger than most places, and quite easy to share (two cuts per order).

The area we sat in was definitely the nicer side where the sushi making station is located. The details are a little lacking: music is sometimes not on, and when it is, it's often very unfitting; some tables had lit candles, others didn't; but nothing was the end of the world. Food: That's really the most important part of dining choice, in my opinion. The stuff we ordered was fantastic! Spicy tuna roll, sweet potato roll, pad thai, soup... yum, yum, yum!!! I'm a bit of a Pad Thai snob, and this definitely won my vote of one of the better pad thai dishes I've had in the city. The sushi rolls were small which I LOVED - not these 4 inch diameter rolls that there's no way you can fit the whole thing in your mouth. They were perfect. Value: Excellent! It's BYOB, no corkage fee. We made a reservation on Groupon reserve and got 25% off the meal. Thai dishes are generally $7-$9; rolls range, but overall, the prices were great. Service: Service was fast and they were very friendly. Not much else to say here! Overall: Really enjoyed this restaurant and we'll be back!

No sushi bar which I sometimes like to sit at when dining alone, but no biggie.  Some interesting options on the sushi menu. There's also a Thai menu but sticking with sushi tonight. First thing that sounds good is the Wasabi Shumai - only they apparently don't have that anymore. So skipping apps and going for a roll - spicy tako sounds good and they have that.   Then going to add some nigiri to my chirachi so going for salmon roe but - they don't have that either. Hmmm. So next best thing is tobiko which they do have so that'll do with some smoked salmon. All set now. Despite the questionable start, the meal was fantastic!  I was really impressed with the quality of the fish.  Talk about a generous cut - wow!  Amazing quality, well prepared, beautiful presentation and reasonable priced.   Where I tend to not gravitate towards restaurants that do 2 cuisines, this one is totally an exception.  Grab a bottle and go - you will not be disappointed.  Ok, maybe make sure to pick a first choice option and a back-up selection or two, but whatever you end up with, I'm sure it will be great!",0.9969,0.71,0.251,0.039,0.6777471686562596

She talked about how it was a hidden little place that had amazing sushi! Now, I am not a huge sushi fan, but I decided to try it anyway and it was nice to get out of the house. She told me the best part of this restaurant is that Sunday's and Monday's there is an all-you-can-eat menu for $20! We went on a Sunday and did the all- you-can-eat option. I don't like raw sushi (I know, weird), but they have a roll called ""Squiddy"". It has a fried calamari on the inside of the roll and spicy mayo on top of it. I was obsessed with it. It was so tasty and yummy and definitely memorable. I get 3 rolls of Squiddy every time I go, along with 5 pot stickers, and 4 egg rolls, all for $20. If I want more, I can simply order more and the price will stay the same.             The only downsides are that if you can't finish your food, you will have to pay for what is left over...so I suggest you order as you go or how much you think you can eat. Also, the bathroom is a single person bathroom and feels tight and small. All of that is workable and not the end of the world. Those are the only reasons I rated Kitchenette 4 stars instead of 5.            I recommend  people try it, and as a side note, it's BYOB. Their food tastes great and the miso soup is tasty too! The inside of the place is cute, nothing over the top or special, but it's comfortable and has a nice ambiance.

The other reason this place was so good for a birthday party was that it was BYOB.  The staff was very accomodating bringing ice buckets, glasses, opening our wine, and everything else you would expect.

I recently moved to this area from East Lakeview where you're practically tripping over any number of awesome sushi places, so of course I went here as fast as I could to find a replacement.  A friend and I went for lunch last weekend and walked into an entirely empty restaurant. Eek! It's not like we walked in at 11 am, it was after 1 pm.  The prices are great, but the portions, at least for the Thai food were small. BUT you get an appetizer, soup and your entree, so it depends on how you look at it. My friend had the green curry and really liked it; he just felt like he should have ordered double to be full. I think it would have been ok for me.  I had the sushi lunch special which consisted of a California Roll, a ""maki"" roll ( I didn't know spicy tuna fell into the maki category) and either soup or salad. Meh. Maybe it was prepared in the morning, but it definitely wasn't prepared after I ordered it--it looked like it had been sitting. It was ok, not the best but not the worst.

2009-07-22,4.0,"Probably closer to a 3.5 star rating, but I'll give Kitchenette the benefit of the doubt for a few reasons. We went for lunch.  Not knowing if it'd be open the next day, a friend called to see what time it opened.  Reason #1: Cute Engrish - ""Eleven and a half"" she was told.  Now in getting here for the actual lunch, we came around 1145 and were a bit dismayed to find it was not open.  Oddly, on the glass outside, there was printed that it was open ""Mon-Tue-Thur-Fri, Sat-Sun"", Wed being omitted.  We were fearing the worst, but someone who had been waiting with us told us the owner was coming and that, in fact, she worked there.  Fortunately, we had nothing but time, so we popped open some beers on the sidewalk (it's BYOB) and waited. Reason #2 - fresh fish.  When the owners finally arrived, they came with what appeared to be, freshly bought fish from the market.  There are a multitude of menu options at Kitchenette: a lunch menu, a Thai menu, and a Japanese menu.  Normally I'm very against this ""excess"" choice as it leads to lack of expertise in any of the choices, but my friend had been before so I withheld judgement.  I opted for a lunch combo of rolls.  For $11, I got a California roll, and  my choice of 2 hand/regular rolls, which turned into a spiny salmon and a spicy white tuna roll.  The rolls were adequate, the taste of fish somewhat lost in the spicy sauce, however, i did like their artistic presentation, which still counts for something in my book.  My main reason for coming here was that I was told the scallop was tasty, so I ordered one.  It was a good size and delicious, although the one i had last week at Matsuya was slightly larger, tastier and cheaper.  I also ordered a amaebi.  Reason #3 - I got my fried shrimp head!  The amaebi itself was very good, although I'm not quite sure why it had a distinct scent of lime.  I've ordered amaebi in Chicago before, but most places don't keep and fry the head for you.  Although the fried shell on the head was a bit much, I was just happy at having it brought back to me. There isn't much for decor at Kitchenette, but the owners are very friendly, as is required when you run a neighborhood restaurant.  Given the numerous sushi choices up on the north side, I still favor Matsuya since it's cheaper and a smidgen better tasting imo.  However, I would be open to returning to try their Thai menu.",0.9853,0.826,0.118,0.056,0.4610233918128655

One of the first things I noticed was the low prices, but I was a bit dismayed upon the arrival of food, because those prices are commiserate with the portion sizes.

We weren't given plates or chopsticks (or any utencils) until asked and they asked how many! Uh there's 5 at the table, I think we all needed it! Then we asked for more paper at least 5 times before they finally got it. 4 out of 5 of us asked for bowls for the soy sauce, instead we got another bottle of soy sauce first, then 1 bowl, then asked again, got another 1, and then asked again until the waitress brought one for everyone at the table. We specifically said 'bowlS' not 'a bowl'. I could have been a bitch and walked up to the area where all the plates and stuff were but my friend calm me down. It was ridiculous. I guess if you like to taste not-so-fresh sushi and experience not-so-good service, you can try it and judge for yourself. This place doesn't get too busy and if it is, the food and service is the same. I finished my plate of sushi before my husband got his.

2008-08-03,3.0,"Wanted a quick meal along the way to Violet Hour and we heard from a friend that they have all u can eat sushi.  So we thought to test the sushi out and fill up on Thai food.         We shared the salmon skin roll ($5.50), spicy salmon roll ($5), spider roll ($7), salmon steak ($8.95), and Red Snapper fillet ($9.95), thai ice coffee ($2.50) and green tea ($1).         Let's start with the bad news.  The rolls, esp the spider roll was skimpy on the meat.  It was cheap at $7 but there were only 5 pieces.  The sushi rice was too damp and mushy,  They cooked the rice with way too much water.  I would give the rolls 1 star.      What saved the day were the entrees which I was very pleased with.  The Red Snapper with hot and spicy sauce had great flavor for the price.  I think the skin could have been a little more crispy, but I was satisfied with it.  For the health conscious, the unadorned salmon steak is a great option.         FYI the all u can eat sushi is Sunday and Monday for $19.99.  After last night's performance by the sushi chef, I don't know if it's worth going.  I would definitely go back for the Thai food though.  And the small box of chiclets with the bill was the deal closer.

2008-07-30,3.0,"3.5 stars based on my delivery order of Vietnamese Spring Rolls and steamed vegetables. The lady that took my order was very friendly and thorough. When I asked for the ""mixed vegetables"" steamed, rather than stir fried, she knew what I was talking about and asked if I wanted the sauce. I replied, ""yes, on the side, please. and I don't really need the tofu, just vegetables"". She repeated all my residence info back to me to ensure there are no mistakes. My food arrived in a timely fashion. I am disappointed that the steamed vegetable container was not full. I think if one is charging $6.95 for a ""mixed vegetable"" dish, that includes a protein of your choice, if one takes out the protein, the chef should put more vegetables in the dish. Maybe I should have specified to substitute vegetables for the protein but it seems like common sense to me. As for the Vietnamese Spring Rolls, I'm going to call these ""sinewy sweet"". They definitely have some outstanding qualities (tightly rolled, vermicelli finer than angel hair, greens almost cover the entire circumference of the roll), but the sweetness is almost cloying, I hate to say. Its the baked tofu in the roll. And the syrupy sauce. It really is syrupy, almost like maple syrup. The menu describes it as sweet and sour. Combine this with baked tofu, not regular tofu, and its a little too...synonym for sweet. But I'll still eat them. The vermicelli in there is awesome, so delicate! And really fresh lettuce, mint and cilantro.",0.9889,0.807,0.157,0.035,0.5026098901098902

2008-05-02,5.0,"Aftering hearing so much about this place from friends who live in the area, I was excited to give it a try this week. I was a little wary of the fact that a) it served both sushi and thai and b) there was no one in it (breaking the first rule of sushi eating: don't eat at a sushi place that is empty. I was pleasantly surprised. This place is muyyyy cheap AND a BYOB, while still managing to  serve good food. We ordered an appetizer and a few rolls and then we each had our own thai dish, while proceeding to drink rum and cokes and the bill was pretty reasonable (with leftovers.) Sushi: Was not the best I have had, but the rolls were done very well and far exceeded expectations. Pricing was reasonable and in line with a normal sushi place. Thai: Definetly the better option, for around 6 bucks you get a healthy portion of delicious food. I had the basil chicken which was fantastically spicy and tasty. Other companions ordered noodle dishes which were just as tasty.  Service: Very good, albeit we were the only ones...we brought a handle of rum and they were very attentive with the ice etc. Ambience: Standard decor, was homey...was told by companions that even when crowded it is still quiet which is a plus. Plan of attack: If looking for an inexpensive meal, then this place gets a high five. Bring some boos, I think the thai is the better part of the menu (and cheaper,) but the rolls were good. One thai dish by itself is probably not enough so go with a thai dish each and then split a roll or another dish and have enough for lunch tomorrow and still spend $10 a person.
