2017-08-24,5.0,"My hotel concierge from the Peninsula Hotel recommended the Pierro Gourmet, (attached to the hotel on Rush Street) for breakfast after I inquired about finding a place to eat outside of the hotel. It's officially attached to the hotel but not inside the actual premises.  First impressions; quaint, warm and so very inviting. You walk in and immediately smell the aroma of coffee and pastries. I asked for a table outside in the patio that runs parallel to Rush street; there are approximately 8-10 tables available on the patio. They have done a great job of the patio with the decor, kind of forget that you are on a Main Street if it were not for the traffic & pedestrians.  I ordered scrambled egg whites with veges and a granola bowl; both of these dishes were outstanding. The coffee I will mention was also superb, one of the best cups of coffee I have had in a long time.  My server Dorota was exceptional , very sweet and attentive. I returned the next day for coffee and a muffin and was served by Vanessa who was also equally amazing.  Defiantly a 'go to' but be prepared to pull out your wallet as it's not cheap, but what isn't in Chicago?? Loved it.",0.9911,0.779,0.191,0.03,0.5276811594202898
2017-08-17,5.0,"My friend and I met a super nice local woman who recommended this cafe to us for breakfast on a recent trip to Chicago.  It was so nice- and I will start by saying I had a superb cafe latte.  Nice and thick and rich and strong....  YUM.  We arrived at around 9 am and there was plenty of room for us, we chose to sit inside, where we had a nice view outside as well.  The tables were nice, with really pretty napkins and cups- it was so French looking.  Very pleasing way to spend our breakfast. I had a breakfast flatbread that had scrambled eggs, tomatoes, gruyere and chives- it has bacon but I am a vegetarian and opted out of that.  My friend had the same thing but said the bacon was delicious! If we would have been by later we would have tried out some of their fancy bakery items and/or some wine, but alas we did not.  Another trip!",0.9813,0.777,0.208,0.015,0.6174999999999999
2017-08-17,4.0,"This French restaurant is excellent for brunch. We had a large table and tried several items. The French Onion soup has an extremely flavorful broth! Everyone really enjoyed their freshly prepared dishes. The downside is that they don't take reservations even for large parties, so waiting for a table is often quite long. When we were seated, they didn't have enough servers and warned us. I think with their fine cooking if they'd improve overall operations, they could be a 5-star place.",0.915,0.769,0.186,0.045,0.41978021978021984

2017-07-17,5.0,"Ooh La La I am in love when it comes to this lovely French cafe that is hotel located at The Peninsula. The back to back dates I have visited Pierrot Gourmet have been met with excellent service accompanied by delicious food. I have had two visits to this lovely bistro one on July 14th for Lunch and one on the July 16th. On my Friday visit they were celebrating Bastille Day or in French la Fête nationale which includes a special menu for lunch and dinner. I started my lunch with a cup of their French Onion Soup and a St. Germain Fizz. The St. Germain Fizz was refreshing but with a hint sweetness. The French Onion soup let me tell you is the best one I have had to date. French Onion soup is my favorite type of soup to a point that if it is on a menu - I am ordering it. Pierrot Gourmet's French Onion soup is one of the books and the top of my list. It is balanced and it is like a warm hug. For my main entrée I decided with the rotisserie chicken and hands down it is the best chicken I have had. The rotisserie chicken is accompanied by rotisserie potatoes, arugula, parmesan, chicken jus. Then yesterday I tried their Banana Foster Waffle which accompanied by buttermilk waffle, whipped cream, caramelized banana syrup.  This is the ideal breakfast when you're hungry in the morning - these waffles are the image in your head you are thinking of that leaves you mouthwatering over the thought of them. The coolest part is the coffee - I got a large latte while my friend got a cappuccino and it took awhile for them to come out. But when they set the coffee cups down it was easy to see why...they did the coolest latte art I have ever received. Mine said Coffee Queen and was accompanied by a crown fit for royalty. While my friends had a I  Coffee on her cup with a drawing of a coffee cup. We felt guilty drinking our coffees because they were so beautiful. We ordered dessert as well to top it all off - my friend ordered the cinnamon bun while I opted for Raspberry Rose Macaron. The Raspberry Rose Macaron is accompanied with vanilla rose cream, raspberry gelee, fresh raspberries. The burst of sweetness in this treat is refreshing as the you get the taste of vanilla rose cream combined with the fresh raspberries. I also love that the top of the macaron has tiny flakes of gold on top. The host at Pierrot Gourmet is always friendly and has a smile on his face.The service here is really good despite it being busy both times I came in. The nice thing about this location is that you have the choice of indoor or outdoor seating. The indoor seating is alright it is cozy when you are seated inside. The outdoor seating on the patio is my absolute favorite because I love to people watch and it allows you to enjoy the outdoor summer weather.  Pierrot Gourmet has exceeded my expectations and I cannot wait to come back again soon!",0.9992,0.76,0.234,0.006,0.5784722222222223
2017-06-15,4.0,"This review is just for the desserts from the dessert case and the drinks.  I tried the chocolate coconut macaron-probably the best macaron I have ever had! Perfect harder outside and soft, moist inside, and delicious! The passion fruit eclair was so yummy-I don't usually buy eclairs because they are so big, but this one was smaller and skinny so I had to try it. It tasted like tropical heaven! Finally I bought the pistachio white hot chocolate made with almond milk. It had had whipped cream and real pistachios on top! I'd never had anything like it before-super unique! I stole a bite of my sister's chocolate cake, and it was yummy too-not too rich and the perfect amount of sweeetness.  The service was great, and the barista asked me what kind of milk I wanted and whether I wanted to add whipped cream or not. It was a little pricey though ($6 for the small hot chocolate).",0.9927,0.759,0.241,0.0,0.5613636363636364

2017-05-09,3.0,"This updated review reflects the service at Pierrot Gourmet for lunch yesterday. Since my last review I had dinner here once and dessert here. First off, food was still wonderful. We still ordered the little french salad and the chicken. In addition, we had the asparagus pasta and crab pasta. Both were smaller portion noodles; however, they were savory and well paired with seafood. For dessert, we finished with crème brulee. Highly recommend all their desserts. I have tried a number of them now, and all of them are a fantastic treat to complete a meal. Our waitress's name, I believe was Diesawit. There were more attentive staff than her. The table next to us, didn't receive much service either. The time from our main course to place an order of dessert was ten minutes. It took an additional sixteen minutes (I have a habit of timing things, once service slows down at a point) after we finished the crème brulee to receive any attention. I understand we are not ordering more, so it felt like we were being ignored. Pierrot Gourmet offers classic french savory courses and desserts that will swoon people in. But the service, or lack off, turns people off on returning for another visit. When I had dinner here two weeks ago, the service was fine even though the whole restaurant was packed with diners. It makes me wonder, that on a quiet Monday afternoon does time slow down?",0.9344,0.897,0.084,0.019,0.38465811965811975

2017-04-08,3.0,Pierrot gourmet is usually a place I frequent solely for macaroons. Today I decided to try the food & it fell short of my expectations. I felt like it had mere truffle essence or truffle oil which always has little to no actual truffle in the ingredient list. The top portion of the dish however was extremely flaky & the bottom crust was extremely buttery but in a good way. Proceed with caution while eating because it's served in a cast iron skillet & will remain piping hot for quite some time.,0.6746,0.903,0.08,0.017,0.5363636363636364
2017-04-02,4.0,"I came here for brunch with my parents when they came to visit from out of town. It was fabulous, and all of us enjoyed our entrees thoroughly. A tip: they don't accept reservations and the restaurant space is small (especially when the outdoor seating is closed), so be prepared to wait. To start, we ordered several baked goods: the pecan roll, the cinnamon roll, the pain au chocolat, and almond croissant. Everything was fantastic, but I especially liked the pain au chocolate--it was super flaky and the chocolate was smooth and rich. What a fantastic start! I also ordered a vanilla latte, which was yummy. Just the right amount of foam, perfect temperature, and great flavor. I had the alsatian scrambled eggs as my entree: eggs mixed with asparagus, potato, ham, onion, and brie cheese. You could tell the eggs were slow-cooked, because they had that velvety, custard-like texture. All of the mix-ins tasted great together. The scrambled eggs also came with a petit salad, which was mixed greens with carrots, cherry tomatoes, and a very light vinaigrette. Delightful! My parents ordered the breakfast flatbread and the chicken and sweet potato popover, and I tried a little of both their entrees. The flatbread was topped with bacon, sundried tomatoes, and cheese. While the flatbread was very crispy and the toppings were tasty, it was somewhat too greasy. The chicken and sweet potato hash was wonderful and so was the poached egg on top, but the popover itself was too chewy and I didn't like the mustard sauce. The biggest downside was the service. Our initial waitress was very friendly and hospitable, but halfway through our meal, she informed us she would be taking her break and a different waitress would take care of us for the remainder of our stay. Unfortunately, this new waitress was nowhere to be found. 20 minutes later, when we finally flagged her down to ask for the check and a box for leftovers, she acted like she had been there the whole time-- no apology, nothing.

I had been walking past this quaint French eatery for months when I was managing the Banana Republic a few streets over. During the summer, the patio is always filled with stylish diners and the food always looked so good.  Location: Right off of Michigan Avenue conjoined with the Peninsula Hotel. Subject to waits because of this. Definitely touristy, but because its a lesser known name, its not as bad as one would think. Decor: Reminiscent of a French country cafe, diners truly feel as though they've transported across the pond and ended up at some romantic cafe off the beaten path frequented by the producers of a Nicholas Sparks film.  Service: QUALITY! Sirs/Maams, Mr. Jackson, etc. Very refreshing. Attentive, and courteous. No other words. Food: I ordered the quiche lorraine which came with a petite salad, and the vanille mille feuille dessert. The quiche lorraine was orgasmic. I finished the salad first so I could really take my time with the quiche. I loved the dressing of the salad. It was very thick, but tasted amazing. The vegetables tasted very fresh. The quiche...okay quite frankly it was the best quiche I've ever had in my life. Even better than the ones I had whilst visiting Strasbourg and Paris a few years ago. The leeks were so tender, the bacon was SO chewy and salty which complimented the creamy gruyere perfectly. The CRUST. WAS. PER. FECT! Now, the only part of this experience that was meh for me, was the dessert - which I seriously thought was going to be the star of the show. For $7, I was not impressed with the vanille mille feuille. It was just okay. The portion was quite small so I would hope the only reason why it is priced this way is because quality ingredients??

It was filled with plenty of leeks and a good amount of gruyere cheese. I got an almond croissant to go and was al little disappointed. Not only was it hard around the edges, but the filling seemed to be missing, so I did not get a taste of the almond filling that accompanies most almond croissants. On my second visit, I had the pecan cinnamon bun and wow...this definitely made up for the dry croissant. Make sure they warm it up...it was delish! For my main course, I had the country biscuit sandwich and I will be back very soon for another one.  Both times, the waitstaff was excellent, which is to be expected as they represent The Peninsula.

My girlfriend ordered the Tart Chocolate Caramel and I settled on the Chocolate Obsession and a hot apple cider. The cider was very good, definitely hit the spot on a cold evening. The desserts are $7, which I think is fair given the location and high quality. The chocolate obsession is a fairly large portion and loaded with chocolate, really good!

Ever.  Rolled up on the day of TG, confronted with a 30min wait (small space - seats probably 50-65 max) - and thank goodness that we stuck it out, despite Stevo pressing his hands against the glass, actively starting down diners. At first glance, menu seems simple, granola, scrambled eggs, a country biscuit sando - but that completely downplays the deliciousness of what's in store for your tastebuds. Breakie flatbread graced w fromage blanc, bacon, scrambled eggs, onion, gruyere, oven-dried tomatoes, chives. Popovers with a chicken and sweet potato hash. A slice of quiche with a tender crust and an eggy, softly firm interior, speckled with zucchini and goat cheese. Flatbreads with pesto, dried tomatoes, mozz, boursin, truffle oil, basil, shooms. Cider beer dip with a pretz roll of gargantuan proportion. Hummy with tender pita and olives. Sandos packed with grilled chicken/arugula/mozz/tomato, salmon/remoulade/tomato, or angus/truffle mayo/shallot/msuhrooms/cheddar, salads ranging from kale/brussels/almonds/feta/dijon to chopped shrimp/avo/mango/peanuts/honey-lime dressing and steak/field greens/potato/blue cheese/onion/corn/bacon. For obvious reasons, my heart was stolen by the behemoth bowl of chia/almond milk/slivered almonds/bananas/bluebs/glory - M and D went for the egg white frittata (dried tomatoes, spinach, feta), both thrilled with the filling results, S hit the salad nicoise hard (seared tuna, arugula, frisee, green beans, tomatoes, anchovies, balsamic), to which he said ""oui, oui"". Ensure that you save some extra room in those spandex as the dessert case is unparalleled in its fabulousness - we went for the macarons (lemon, pistachio, chocolate, coffee, skipping the pumpkin spice, nutella, strawb mascarpone, caramel fleur du sel) - millefuilles, dacquoises, caramel creams - palm-sized cookies in oatmeal raisin, double chocolate, peanut butter - you literally cannot go wrong. I can't remember the prices - but I do think that the flatbread was $19, the omelettes were around $16, my bowl was glory was $14ish, fruit bowls for $11, coffee (delish, PS) $3.75 - brunch for 4, including 7 macarons was $140 - though I think it could be done more cheaply, as we ordered 6 entrees and dessert....soooo....yeah.

After 30 minutes we hadn't heard anything.  We called the restaurant and got no answer.  We called GrubHub, and the girl on the phone was very helpful.  It's now 9:30 and she said that the restaurant did not contact GrubHub but they would contact them to help us.   She called back and said that the restaurant manager would not send us the cheese plate that they forgot, and that they would not make another order.  He said that they were ""busy.""  I think that he was ""busy"" eating our cheese plate. GrubHub was great, and refunded us for the purchase.   Here we are now over two hours later and we didn't get our cheese plate and our cat is still gone.  I spent over a decade in the restaurant industry and this type of contempt for customers is completely unacceptable. So thanks, Pierrot Gourmet, you made a really terrible day even worse.  I didn't think that our day could POSSIBLY get worse, but you have exceeded our expectations.  I often see people on Yelp say that they wish there was a zero star option, but this restaurant made me wish that there was a NEGATIVE star option because this restaurant, the guy who answered the phone and lied to us, and the manager tonight are among the worst that Chicago has to offer.",-0.9653,0.822,0.066,0.112,0.524223602484472

My parents were visiting, so I thought it would be the perfect place to sit outside and have coffee and a share a pastry. We we're in a bit of a time crunch, but the host/server informed us it would be 10-15 for a table outside. After the allotted time he said another 10 minutes at most. Finally, after half an hour went by, I found myself wondering why I was waiting over half an hour for a cup of coffee... After 35 minutes, we were finally seated. We had our coffee/tea and shared a pastry. As someone who drinks pure darjeeling tea, the tea almost had no color or flavor, even after steeping in the teapot. I enjoy dark coffee, but this coffee was overly bitter. Finally, when the bill came, I noticed I was incorrectly charged, which just added to the blunder of misfortunate events. The pastry, as expected, was exceptional and the only redeeming quality of our visit. Next time I'll skip the wait and pay half the amount and just pay a visit to Oak Street Starbucks.  I'm really sad to have to write this review, maybe my expectations were just too high.",-0.6336,0.862,0.058,0.081,0.5495833333333333

Appellation Wines were all extraordinarily crisp and bright and easy on the palate. Standouts included:  Tangent Albarino 2013--a lovely semi-dry white apertif wine, delightfully easy to drink, and great with appetizers. Tangent Sauvignon Blanc 2013--lovely and balanced and not nearly as astringent as the typical New Zealand type. Gorgeous with the very generous plate of tarragon poached lobster, avocado and corn.  The Paraiso Vineyards Chardonnay was delicious and paid its respects very nicely to the second course of grilled nectarines and a helping of the incredibly smooth and rich house-made ricotta cheese with honey drizzle. OMG.  Their Trenza Tinto Tempranillo 2000--beautiful, rich red accompaniment to the nearly fat-free chunk of short rib beef served with unique elements like pickled cherries and fried green tomatoes. A surprising, lightly spiced Baileyana Firepeak Pinot Noir went perfectly with the chocolate and cherry dessert. Candles on the table. Sparkling glassware. Attentive service. Relaxed vibe.

I don't know, but it just created an illusion that French pastries are best at French Boulangerie, though in reality it probably was made by a Tom or Dick or Chun Lee. Pierrot Gourmet is part of The Peninsula hotel in Chicago and though the hotel chain is a Hong Kong Shanghai hotel, it is so luxurious more than any French hotels.. or l'hôtel...? Funny, cuz when I think of Hong Kong, I'm thinking of dim sum where wait staff throwing plates and shit at you. Not exactly luxury that came to mind. However, Hong Kong produced hotels like Peninsulas and Langhams.  The Peninsula Chicago has been a favorite for awhile for me, especially for afternoon tea. Their pastries and scones were great and made beautifully. I was also exposed to a lot of the baked goods at Pierrot Gourmet by my friend, Christina, whose husband works at the hotel. She used to bring anything Peninsula to help promote her husband's hotel but also she probably got great discount...Hehehe. I used to do dishes for her in culinary school for passion fruit macarons from here. Oh, they were so good. Her daughter had a birthday party once and the cake came from here, and again it was passion fruit cake. Mon Dieu... C'est trés fuckin yummy! I was across the street staying at Park Hyatt this last visit. After a breakfast at NoMi the day before that was just okay but cleaned up my pocket chains, I decided to walk across to Pierrot Gourmet. My sis and niece were still asleep. Too bad, as it would have been great to sit down and eat there. I got myself a latte and several croissants - regular, almond, and chocolate. I also got their caramel pecan roll.  They were devoured as soon as I got back to the room. Almond croissant was so good and was my fave out of all the pastries I bought. My sister loved the pecan roll and my niece liked the pain de chocolat aka chocolate croissant for sure.  I will have to remember to order birthday cake from them sometime. I often forgot about this place and  how good and exquisite their cakes and pastries are.

""...a stock character of pantomime...,"" you know, those classic whiteface clowns that seem so sad, often with a little black teardrop on their cheek. But add ""Gourmet"" to Pierrot; this place knows how to turn that frown upside-down.  I've had this place Yelp bookmarked for a while, to either go there for breakfast or for a pastry. I ended up going late one afternoon with a friend. It's a homey place that is warm and bright, even on a gray day. If mimes could talk, one would be outside singing, ""(Come in here 'cause) Gray skies are going a clear up! Put on a happy face!"" Excellent, friendly servers, as well. She got a little cake that looked like a yellow sunrise, filled with coconut, which she enjoyed greatly. I was starving; so I had a soup and half sandwich. The soup of the day was butternut squash, and let me tell you that it was phenomenal. It came with some cream (crème fraîche? I can't remember) and some toasted pumpkin seeds on top. The sandwich was basic ham and brie on a very fresh baguette. Nothing wrong with that. It also came with a small salad with fresh greens and some red and yellow cherry tomatoes.  Unfortunately, I felt too full to have a pastry (I really should have at least had one of those scrumptious-looking macaroons); so I'll have to do that on my next stop, and there definitely will be another.

The chicken sweet potato popover was perfect. The sweet potatoes were appropriately soft, and the bread crust was just the way I like it--more toasted than not toasted, and the crunchiness of the crust added a nice contrast to the sweet potatoes.  I've also been here for the macarons! The macarons here are the best I've had in Chicago. Flavors I've had are strawberry, raspberry, cassis, mango, chocolate, mint, special Christmas peppermint ones, and vanilla. I especially like the crust and the flavoring of the macarons!

But not at all elitist although it easily could be. Having a wife that grew up in France and Switzerland, the bar is set pretty high when it comes to cuisine steeped in European culture, but this place has delivered on all fronts so far. A recent trip to the northwestern hospital campus downtown for the birth of my second child had my family staying nearby for several days. So that gave parents, grandparents and an aunt several things to try on Pierrot's menu, and each dish brought rave reviews from family.  Quiche Lorraine - the best my wife has ever had. And the woman is a quiche expert. Waffles, great. Chocolate and almond croissants, stellar. Bacon frittata, perfectly balanced and light. lunch items we tried included truffle Mac and cheese and the lobster roll. Not items you expect on a cafe menu but both were exceptional. And the French onion soup was wonderful as expected. Dessert options abound in the pastry case. We went deep on macaroons based on a hunch, and they were stellar. All of them. Good macaroons are hard to find stateside, so I rarely get them as they usually disappoint. Crunchy and light with both new and traditional flavor options, these were a huge hit. My biggest thing is espresso. There is great coffee roasting culture in Chicago, yet I find that many restaurants can't pour quality  espresso consistently. Usually the machine isn't setup well or not cleaned enough, or perhaps the barista is not delivering, but it's hard to find a quality espresso place with good food and vice versa.

2014-08-29,4.0,"I first heard of Pierrot Gourmet several years ago while chatting with a colleague.  He advised me that there was a tiny little bakery/cafe attached to the Peninsula Hotel that served the best croissants he'd ever had.  At the time, I lived in the burbs, so never got around to investigating his claims.  Last year, however, I moved into the City and because I lived around the corner from the Hotel, PG quickly became my go-to breakfast spot.   My colleague wasn't exaggerating when he said ""tiny.""  PG is very small, but all of the taste that imbues the corridors of its parent Hotel glows from the polish of its rustic-like silverware and polished wooden family-style tables.  Be prepared to sit elbow-to-elbow with other guests, unless you get there early enough to corner one of the smaller/more private tables.  PG also has limited seating outdoors when the weather is nice, from where you can judge all the misguided folks who are waiting in line at Giordano's across the street (Gino's East is clearly superior!). Was my colleague as equally accurate with his assessment of the croissants?  Probably not.  I've had better.  The macarons were pretty decent--they are beautiful and come in pretty packaging, but again, nothing to write home about.  The breakfast entrees were very...interesting. Tasty? Yes.  Perhaps a bit too adventurous for my American palate?  Maybe.  Think pungent cheeses, unusual cuts of meat, and words on the menu that you can't always pronounce.  If you're into that stuff, PG will definitely satisfy. But here's where they literally take the cake: the artistry in their pastries.  PG makes THE BEST red velvet cake I've ever eaten.  Moist, mouthwatering, and lined with a delightfully tart cream cheese frosting that never tastes chalky.  I've ordered this cake (48 hours in advance) for every major birthday and familial event since I discovered it and it NEVER disappoints.  I even ordered it for the Pacquiao fight last year and it was a HIT.   The mini-desserts look like something out of a jewelry store--so much so, you feel bad about destroying the obvious effort that went into their creation.   I recently brought home two boxfuls of them for my sister in law's bridal shower, and my mother said, ""They are so beautiful, they look like sculptures!""  And they are as delicious as they are lovely.   The only reason I give this place a Four is because the service can be hit or miss.  Often times, I've been required to wait 10 minutes to get a croissant to go or to pick up the aforementioned to-die-for red velvet cake--even though I've already paid.  Also, I've been witness to more than one unhappy customer who's cake order mysteriously disappeared, despite documentary evidence (a receipt!) to the contrary.  These are kinks one might expect in a 3-star establishment, but anathema in a place that endeavors to live up to the 5-star reputation of its parent Hotel.   All in all, though, a lovely little spot in the Gold Coast.  Highly recommended.",0.9958,0.788,0.153,0.059,0.5053904761904762

The other pastries are wonderful as well and we've tried the eclair (ah-mazing), almond croissant and pain au chocolat. Dine-in wise, they have a good selection of European inspired dishes which are good. My fav is the Niçoise salad which comes with seared rare ahi tuna. Don't expect super fast service though.

I dislike desserts that are overly sweet, but the desserts here are perfectly balanced.  I came here with my mama on a Sunday evening for a Mother-Daughter dessert date. We chose the salted caramel chocolate tart and the crème fraiche cheesecake. Wow. Just wow. The salted caramel chocolate tart was a flourless chocolate cake covered with the most delicious salted caramel glaze. I'm not a huge fan of cheesecake in general, so I was initially very hesitant about ordering it. However, it came with a pretty, swirly-blueberry-white chocolate shell-thing on the outside, so that was my original motivation for ordering it.

It's hard to decide which one is better but if you have a bit more of a sweet tooth, I'd go with the caramel. The strawberry mascarpone is super yummy though and I always get it! A close third/fourth is the raspberry and the nutella both of which are quite good too. The two that are more unusual are the cassis (it's like a black currant jelly) and the coconut passion fruit. Both of the fillings were on the sour side but that could be because I had the sweeter macarons first. I also couldn't taste the coconut as much as I could the passion fruit....surprisingly enough!  I don't know if this is a typical thing but the last time I bought 6, the lady gave me one for free so that's always a plus. The macarons are also quite sturdy. I dropped my bag at least two or three times while walking down the streets (ugh, clumsy) and they were weren't as cracked as I expected them to be when I got back home.

Often times, when you go to an establishment that is connected to a luxury hotel like The Peninsula, you'd imagine that the ambience is more formal, stuffy, and dare I say, froufrou? Well, this place didn't have that, and I loved that. We came around 4:30pm on a Monday during the holidays, and there were quite a few people relaxing over tea, having a dessert, and in general, just shooting the breeze. It wasn't a packed full house, and the spacing of the tables provided good amounts of privacy and space. We sat near the window with a tree behind our table. Nice and cozy! Initially, we just wanted to have a few macarons and some tea, and call it a day. But after reading the reviews and the menu, we decided to sample some savory dishes as well. So, we ended up going with their Quiche Lorraine, and asked our server to split it. Priced at $12, it was the perfect amount for the both of us. Each of us received a sliced wedge, about 2"" x 6"" size. The crust was buttery and flaky, and the eggs were so light and fluffy that you almost forgot you were eating eggs. The amount of bacon, gruyere cheese, leeks scattered throughout was balanced and fragrant. Super fresh. Mmmm :) Paired with it was an awesome petite salad. I LOVED the dressing. It was a mixture of lemon, blood orange, honey, S&P, olive oil. I'm sure there are more ingredients in it, but that's what I predominantly tasted. Oh my..I can't wait to try and recreate that at home because it was sublime. The delicate and subtle flavors of the dressing was tossed in the perfect amount with the greens, and with a few slivers of parmesan cheese...HEAVEN. For dessert, we purchased some macarons ($2.30 each) to go and they were all excellent. By far my favorite macarons right now. Fluffy, chewy, and airy filling; just the way I like them. :) We had a passion fruit mousse ($7) for dining in. Excellent like the savory quiche, the passion fruit flavor shined through marvelously, and had a marshmallowy texture to it. The small amount of black sesame seeds that rimmed the bottom of the dessert was a nice nutty and crunchy offset. The icing to the dessert was the small sliver of dark chocolate that had a nice artsy graphic design. Great for sharing, and nothing was too sweet. By far, one of my favorites to grab French macarons right now, and I look forward to the next time we return. :)",0.9984,0.786,0.204,0.01,0.5867366155501746

We got there right before the dinner rush came in and opted for a window table in the cute bistro. Literally 3 minutes after were were seated, the rush came in and every table was occupied.  Even though we had to flag down our waitress and put our order in along with the mad rush's, we got our food in good time.  We ordered their duck confit flatbread as an appetizer- SO good!  Would order again and try some of their other ones.  Great combination of flavors including the smokiness of the flatbread itself.  My husband had the truffle mac and cheese which came with a side salad. I'm not usually a fan of truffles but it was really good.  It had the gooeyness and creaminess of your typical mac and cheese, but then the top and side pieces were crunchy and chewy- yum.  I had the shrimp and grits.  I keep ordering it because I keep forgetting that I've tried it before and don't like it.  I wasn't a fan, but not because their's was bad specifically.  The hubs really liked my dish a lot.   They have a case of desserts in the front of the house that tempted me after dinner and I limited myself to 2 macrons (nutella and strawberry marscapone) which were both delectable!  Service for the most part was great, especially the host, who I'm assuming was the GM?  He seemed to exude the type of confidence and service that you would expect at the Peninsula.",0.9796,0.78,0.144,0.076,0.5939484126984126
2013-11-23,5.0,"1) Food: Excellent in both quantity and quality. We had clam chowder soup, French bibb salad, chicken flatbread, duck confit, and wine. I like how they seasoned the salad; it was very light and delicious. The flatbread was amazing, and so was the duck. I like how they cooked a variety of vegetables with/on the food. The only thing I didn't like about food was that the duck was a bit too salty. Also, make sure to ask for the special menu if you're not given it at first. 2) Service: Excellent, excellent, excellent!! First of all, I liked how the server let us decide where to sit rather than just telling us where to sit. Also, the waiter willingly changed our seat to the one beside the Christmas tree when a couple who had eaten there left just after we took our seat (And yes, they have cute Christmas trees in the restaurant!!!!!). He was also kind enough to answer all our questions about their menu and very patient with us even though it took a very long time for us to decide what to eat.  3) Ambience: Amazing. The interior is bright, warm, and cozy. I felt like I was dining at a European village inn or something while on a backpack trip, or I was invited to a home dinner in France (I might have overstretched a bit, but I liked it as much.)

Over the last year I have been here 3 times with friends and on every occasion I had absolute worst experience.  1. First time I came here was for brunch and the food was not bad. It was overpriced, but not bad.  The food took too long to come out and they came out one plate at a time. Considering we were a group of 6 people, and we waited for everyone's food to arrive, we all had cold food. 2. The second time I came to see my wife and her friend. They had arrived an hour before me and were having drinks. There were only 2 chairs at the table so I could not sit. I stood there for 20 min, and nobody walked over to offer me a chair or ask me if I was going to order anything. We asked for the bill and left!!! 3. The third time I here was final straw. We were in a group of 6 and were told there was a 20 minute wait.  We were also asked not to leave as they will not hold the table. After being there for over 45 minutes still waiting, I was surprised when I saw another group of 6 walk straight in and sit down. When I asked the manager, she told me that they were there earlier and had their name down. What really upset me was that they kept the table free for them to arrive for more than 10 minutes contradicting what they said earlier.  I have never been to this place again after that and do not recommend it to anyone.  They do have great macaroons, but their service leaves a bitter taste in your mouth.",0.2359,0.835,0.085,0.079,0.5493253968253969

They are right in the heart of down town Chicago, just one block off Michigan Avenue under the Penninsula Hotel.  I've been going there for breakfast on every visit to Chicago over the past 10 years.  Great orange juice, coffee, pastries and frittatas. Expensive, but really, really nice!  Highly recommended. Although on my last visit (May 2013), the pastries seem to be a lot smaller than I remember... :/",0.851,0.777,0.162,0.061,0.5664790764790765
2013-06-04,4.0,"Came here on a rainy Sunday afternoon with my mom around 1ish and the place was packed. I originally really wanted to sit outside as they have such adorable outdoor seating, but since it was rainy we decided we had no other choice than to sit inside the little cafe of the Peninsula Hotel and oh thank the sweet lord that we did because the place is adorable. It reminded me of some cute Parisian cafes from Europe so I am definitely a fan of that. Plus, their open case of dessert is just jaw dropping, you literally want to try every item in that case, and I'm not messing around, everything looks amazing.  We had to wait 15 minutes to get seated as it was packed, but no biggie, and we got a nice table in the end of the restaurant. It wasn't too loud so I liked that aspect. Our server was very nice and we started with the french onion soup to go with their yummy complimentary bread. Oh was it yummy, and I'm not even a fan of french onion, but Pierrot Gourmet does it right. That stuffed us up already but we had to try their sliders with beef tenderloin, sweet onion jam and a yummy mustard. They are only $5 and served with a yummy salad. Wow, one of the best non-burger sliders I've ever had served on a pretzel bun, yay. Okay at that point I was pretty stuffed from all the carb intake but like I said, I still needed to try the whole dessert case. All kidding aside, we went with the raspberry napoleon like dessert with vanilla creme to share. It was amazing, not overly sweet, super fresh and we gobbled that right up. The desserts aren't cheap but they are worth every penny. I did see the infamous PB&J macaroon but it was just way too big for me to handle. So instead I opted with the nutella macaroon and it was very tasty, but I'm just not the biggest fan of macaroons, shh don't tell anyone. However, next time I'm getting that big hazelnut chocolate ball of ferero rocher, that looked amazing as well. My mom also go the cappuccino which she enjoyed but next time will get the latte as they are more creative with those. I got an almond croissant for my hubby to go as he loves those and he said it was okay, it was a tad on the crunchy side so I hope we didn't get yesterday's ones but I think they make everything fresh daily. I will definitely be back to this quaint, little and perfect lunch spot in Chicago.",0.9994,0.681,0.295,0.025,0.5562619047619048

2013-04-22,4.0,"If I hadn't just walked off the street in Chicago i would have said i was in a charming french cafe in marseille. Stepping in, there is a bright atmosphere with people eating together on pinewood tables. The food is complex and uses uncommon ingredients/ recipes. The deserts were second to none.  Two downsides: It's very busy it took us 40 minutes to get seated for a group of 4 at 11am. It's expensive relative to other cafes.   Complimentary Bread - 4/5 Great bread. Strong crust whith a heary whole wheat inside. If it was warm would have been 5/5 but still exceptional. Cheese Fondue - 5/5 Using emmentaler brings more flavor than usual fondue cheeses. The dipping bread is made in house and had a hearty whole grain quality. Crab Cake - 4/5 Not fried but baked with low amount of battering, really letting the crab meat stand alone. The meat was moist and tender. For $13 though i would have thought it would be much bigger. Although delicious your really not getting good value. Whole Wheat Crepe  3/5 In concept it sounded amazing. Whole wheat crape with seasonal vegetables and goat cheese. Unfortunately i thought the kale was bitter and detracted from the overall flavor and there was a ton of kale. If they'd ditch the kale and added some honey this would be a 4/5. It's not that i don't like Kale either, i eat it but it just didint work in this crepe. Raspberry Chocolate Tart - Unratably good From the look of things you can't go wrong with any desert here although this one is especially good. Taking a bite sends me to chocolaty heaven.  The bottom is a sort of dark chocolate graham cracker, inside a dense mouse, outside is a thickened shell of raspberry sauce. It's big enough for two although due to my wifes kindness i ate about 3/4's.  I'll have to come back for the deserts.",0.8933,0.82,0.107,0.073,0.4930833333333333
2013-04-22,3.0,"**REVIEWS MACARONS ONLY** -___________________- Is what I can say about the Peninsula's Pierrot Gourmet macarons.  It was so highly rated on Yelp and located in the Peninsula, I assumed it would be great.  My friend surprised me with $70 worth of macarons from here.  I was crestfallen BECAUSE I read so many great macaron reviews from here.  I had every flavor offered, so I am providing an expansive review (i.e. not just a review based on 1-2 flavors).  It wasn't shit; of course, they didn't use crap buttercream filling.  They used ganache and other substancey fillings, which is how a real European macaron should be filled (i.e.many Americanized bakeries have crap buttercream-filled macarons, which don't give the authentic macaron experience). I think Bon Macaron is good; the owner was trained in France for macarons and she is obsessed with macarons and has a lot of macaron-based certificates lol.  But inconveniently, she ONLY takes private orders. I also used to really like Leonidas Chocolate's peach macarons.  But I believe they changed their macaron baker, as the owner posted that on Yelp.",0.9744,0.811,0.162,0.027,0.659047619047619

Filling up - My husband and I shared the cheese fondue and crab cake apps and the whole wheat veggie crepe off the lunch menu, along with a chocolate raspberry tart for dessert. We had more than enough food for our feast. *Fondue came in a tiny pot and was ultra rich Gruyere cheese. It would have been better to have more than just apple slices and bread to dip, but honestly, we could probably just eat spoonfuls of the cheese and be happy. *Crab cake was mostly big lumps of meat with minimal filler - just the way it should be, but it sat on top of the coleslaw and my husband's never much of a fan of slaw. *I loved the crepe because it was the perfect consistency with a thin crust, plus it was healthy yet hearty. Tons of squash,a variety of mushrooms, kale and goat cheese filled me up, but of course we needed to save room for the... *Decadent dessert.

2013-04-09,4.0,"This is a review for their macarons. If macarons are not your thing than please disregard this review.  The pricing is a bit high (imo) but that might be due to the fact I had previously lived in New York and London and in those cities the variety of restaurants and pastries that carried macarons were more accessible as well as the pricing being more kinder on the wallet. Unfortunately, this is not so much the case here in Chicago. The macarons in Chicago range from great to moderate in terms of taste but it can get pricey to purchase just a couple of macarons. Luckily, the size of these sugary goodness at Pierrot Gourmet is decent, which I can't say for other Chicago bakeries/pastry shops that sell macarons and more often than not can be tiny!  The macarons here really are lovely though. I highly recommend! They're soft yet chewy (the perfect texture), all of the flavors are delicious, and the packaging is adorable. The staff can vary depending on what time of day you go. Sometimes they're friendly and helpful and other times they can be cold and stand-offish.  Overall, I do highly recommend this place for the macarons and their sweets but not so much the food- which is priced a bit high for sandwiches, soups, etc. I ordered soup here before and it was served lukewarm which luckily their server re-heated right away and apologized for.  **Also, the location also can be tricky if you haven't been here before.",0.9971,0.742,0.236,0.022,0.5562581168831168

2012-10-26,5.0,"In the four days I was in Chicago, I ate 37 macarons from Pierrot Gourmet. I slowly felt myself transforming into a giant, delicious, melt-in-your-mouth macaron. I consider myself a sugar tourist: my sole purpose of visiting different cities is to sample their sweets. Pierrot Gourmet macarons were the sugar highlight of my Chicago trip!  The flavors that were available were lemon, salted caramel, blackberry, raspberry, nutella, pistachio, and chocolate. Salted caramel was my favorite, and Chocolate was my least favorite. I am not a huge fan of lemon flavored sweets, but the lemon was surprisingly one of my favorites. It had just the right amount of tartness and there was a smooth white filling inside. Each macaron at Pierrot Gourmet has three layers. There is the outer cookie, the filling, and then something special in the center. The blackberry and raspberry ones had a bit of jam in the center, surrounded by filling. The salted caramel had a chewy caramel in the center. A perfect macaron to me is one that has a slightly crisp exterior that gives in when you sink your teeth in. The inside should be moist and chewy. Pierrot Gourmet macarons fit the bill! I tried the giant PB&J macaron, and I liked the idea of a giant macaron more than the taste. It was basically a peanut butter and jelly sandwich with macaron cookie shells instead of bread. It was a little overwhelming. I will definitely stick to multiple normal sized macarons instead of the giant macaron next time I go!",0.9876,0.843,0.146,0.011,0.5663690476190476

2012-09-29,5.0,"The first thing I told our waitress today was my last visit at Gourmet and how my order of sausages and eggs took more than 40 minutes. I told her that I had gotten a email message from the manager apologizing for the inconvenience in service (this is true) and that I would see to it that the manager was true to his words: That the service would be better the next time I came.  A 45 min wait was reduced to 20 min! It made the already delicious sausage frittata even more enjoyable.  Other great details that made this a particularly memorable brunch: my friend was Croatian and so was our waitress Gordona. Well, they started talking in Croatian and that only added to the great service we were getting. All the time that was happening, I was getting back at my Spanish with my Croatian friend's friend, an exchange student from Spain. Not to mention the knowledgeable insights that my consultant friend (from China) shared with me, a Korean born in Hong Kong.  Overall, I was very very satisfied with the time I spent at Pierrot Gourmet today. One of the maxims I value is that fruitful conversations and business happen more likely when you're eating at a place that has great food and service. It only adds to the experience.  There was one small thing that I did want to point out because I feel it is my duty to be impartial and observant of things that could be improved: We were given a  table right next to the windows where the terrace was located on the opposite side. The space between the tables and the windows was too narrow for me to get in. I'm not sure what to propose as a solution, but I'm sure the Gourmet staff can handle that flaw. Also, when you're passing out menus, don't commit petty mistakes like handing out two lunch menus instead of one breakfast and one lunch menu.

Once we found it, we immediately made ourselves at home at the community table. The place was reminiscent of Le Pain Quotidien in NYC-- simple, well-prepared dishes with top-notch ingredients.  I sipped on my mug of hot chocolate while we shared a beet and burrata salad. Came with a generous amount of creamy burrata cheese and fresh cuts of apples and citrus to complement the earthiness of the salad. The breakfast bread pudding was a decent sized muffin-like item with a good balance of a soft-leek- ham interior and crisp exterior. The wild mushroom flatbread which soon followed was nothing short of comfort with its hot, cheesy-crispiness-- gotta love anything drizzled in truffle oil!  I couldn't leave without toting back some macarons. While it seemed others had the same idea (certain flavors were out), I savored each bite from lemon to mint chocolate chip. Though, I still consider Vanille the best in the city thus far.   For the weekend, it quickly filled to capacity. I do plan on returning for their sandwiches- looked like it came with some salad and soup. Else I may just stop in at their display case to get my macaron fix.

The atmosphere is quite tense here.  On my daily walk in jeans and tennis shoes after work, I felt out of place as I stepped into this ""casual"" bakery.  You don't feel like yourself here; you don't feel the hospitality of good service.  You feel....like you are stuck in a cold and arrogant place with delicious macrons to comfort you.",0.9836,0.757,0.194,0.049,0.5555714285714285

Located in the Peninsula Hotel, Pierrot Gourmet also has a tasty-sounding, if thoroughly expensive, brunch menu. As for us, we went straight for the pastries, filled with delicious goodies. Alas, there was no coffee eclair, something I've been searching fruitlessly for since my days in Paris. There's still pretty much everything else under the sun, including the purpose of our visit: macarons. There were 10 flavors, from the standard (vanilla, chocolate, etc.) to the seasonal variety (peppermint, for example). Unfortunately, the macarons disappointed. The filling was minimal and not nearly enough, and the cookies didn't hold up nearly as well as other macarons we've brought home via airplane. They also had a huge macaron, the PB&J, that thoroughly intrigued us. After all, our best macaron ever was the Pierre Herme's world famous Ispahan. Unfortunately, the PB&J fell far short. The interior is as it says: peanut butter and jelly. There's some honey roasted and sugared peanuts in there which totally rocked. But I would have preferred for them to try and go with a traditional cream filling, infused with PB&J character. As it was, it didn't read like a macaron tasting like a PB&J sandwich, but rather a PB&J sandwich that was trying to masquerade as a macaron. Like the smaller macarons, the PB&J cookie shell was unduly hard, not nearly fluffy and lightly crisp enough for it to be considered a macaron masterpiece. Still, if you're in and around the area, Pierrot Gourmet is a decent place to check out, if only to admire the pastry shelf. That's always fun.",0.9698,0.839,0.111,0.05,0.6338235294117648

We were told 45 minutes, but we'd been reading the menu they had posted outside and were intrigued by many of their brunch selections. To make a long, long, long story short, we ended up waiting an hour and a half for our meal. We'd never have waited so long had we known, but they continued to tell us it would be just a couple more minutes.  It's a small place, so it's understandable that there was a wait, but there were only 4 of us and table after table of couples was seated before us. They literally seated 10-12 pairs of diners who came AFTER us, before us. I have a hard time understanding why they couldn't just push together two 2-tops to make room for us at some point during the hour and a half. Needless to say, we were cranky and hungry by the time we were seated. We were all ready to hate the place, but honestly, the food was AMAZING. And I don't think it's just because we were at a point where passerby were beginning to look like turkey legs (Looney-Tunes-style). I ordered the salade nicoise, which was really fresh, generously portioned, and legitimately french (i.e., anchovies and really good olives). We ordered a couple of flatbreads for the table and they were amazing. Really great flavor combinations. I also got a big bowl of berries with my meal, and while it was a little too expensive, it was the perfect side item.  Everyone was really happy with their food and we found the waitstaff to be very friendly and helpful.

My breakfast pastry was much better though.  I had the chocolate croissant, which had a good dark brown color on the outside; they got a good flavor out of the crust.  The croissant pastry was light, flaky and a little bit crispy.  The chocolate was good and there was an even balance of it throughout the croissant.

Both were pretty good. My daughter had mac and cheese and it taste good, a lot better than kraft in a box.  We had to bag up the mac and cheese.  The staff was so nice, they washed my babies spoon and put it into a zip lock bag with the m&c. Afterward, we visited the desert and order nutella and chocolate macarons and a vanilla frosted chocolate cupcake.  Their macaroon are pretty good, crispy on the outside and not too dense with a nice filling. Their cupcake is surprisingly good. The frosting was light and the cake was moist and fluffy.  A few days later, I stopped by to try more flavors of the macarons: passion fruit, coconut chocolate, poppy lemon, and pastahcio. I was only not a fan of the passion fruit.

Owned by the spectacular The Peninsula Hotel group to which it is attached, this corner bistro has all the makings of a top notch place to nosh French country style.  Its a lovely casual space with a cabinet of STUNNING (looking) cakes and pasteries. More on that later.  Our breakfast food was expensive, and on the whole, very good tasting. But the service on two occasions was awful and my wife's mushroom fritatta had virtually no mushrooms.  Our breakfast service took forever. The server was unfriendly. Our table wobbled, there was no salt and pepper on the table, and we waited and waited. Other partrons were VERY frustrated that it took 10-15 minutes just to get a check.  Two days later, and since I was staying at The Peninsula and since it was my birthday and I was craving cake, I decided to come down to Pierrot Gourmet to sample one of the seductive pastries. Unfortunately for me, they closed at 9pm. I arrived at 8:57 and was brusquely rebuked. If you say you are open to 9pm, BE OPEN.

The room is very inviting, and I was surprised (pleasantly) to find long shared farm tables as seating in the center. The remaining tables are all two-top near the windows. The place is fully staffed with very friendly and very gracious servers and you can expect to be waited on or helped by a number of them. They seated me at the end of one of the large tables, set me up with water, and offered a New York Times while I waited. Nice touch. Influenced by the other reviewers here, I ordered the Pen Chicken Salad. What a perfect size and mix of ingredients with the usual understated European light dressing. Shaved cheese on top. Bread to accompany it. And the iced tea was worthy of describing as one would a wine: ""light, seductive nose, golden hue, full-bodied, yet not over-bearing, with a soft finish,"" I made my way slowly through the bed of spinach to find little treats of shredded chicken, cashews, pistachios, dried cranberries, apple slices, bacon and eggs. I tried to eat it with some French politeness and European reserve (instead of shoveling it in as I really wanted to). Delicious and perfect light lunch choice.

I went here for a birthday lunch with a large group of friends, and was delighted by the ""Wilkommen"" (Welcome auf Deutsch) and the Bavarian colors draped from the ceiling in honor of Oktoberfest.  I will warn you that charm started to wane when we sat waiting for about an hour, when told our party of 12 would have to wait 30-40 minutes... but you can see that I still give them a top rating. After the experience, I'm not holding the quaint seating room size against Pierrot Gourmet.  As for food, I ordered off the Bratwurst Platter mit Kartoffelsalat und Sauerkraut from the special Oktoberfest menu. I sampled friend's Sheppard's pie - very savory with lamb, I believe. The flat bread pizza and sandwiches all looked good. Whatever you order, you MUST save room/money to try the peanut butter and jelly macaroon - moist and delicious. Pistachio one was fine. Service exceeded my expectations. Neither my water glass nor coffee sat empty while I sat there. They brought us take out containers for the fruit tart we brought in from the outside.

2010-09-21,4.0,"While staying in Chicago for 4 days, we ended up having breakfast here twice.  I mean, I kind of feel like this place was pretty mediocre, and yet, I can't stop myself from loving it. We (my husband and I) really enjoyed the cozy/classy atmosphere, the presentation, the service. Day one, I had the orange crepes with mascarpone cheese. Crepes aren't my favorite, but my husband had just confessed that he'd never had a crepe before and I ordered them just so he could try one. They ended up being phenomenal, very buttery and rich and orangey and not soggy at all. The edges had even become a little crisp (under a broiler, perhaps?). I would definitely reccommend them!  My husband ordered a Gruyere/mushroom frittata, and loved every bite of it. The next day, I had a cheese danish. It was strangely shaped like a croissant, but nevertheless tasty, flaky, dreamy.  My husband got the scrambled eggs, and we were both blown away by the size and quality. It must have been a 5 egg scramble, such was the heap of fluffy eggs (with potatoes, ham, asparagus, and brie) on the plate, that also included a very fresh mixed green salad on the side. I stole quite a few bites since it was such a large dish, and enjoyed it immensely.  Our only real complaints have to do with beverages... My husband is a tea drinker, in a serious way, and was disappointed to find an establishment as classy as this, next door to and a part of the Peninsula, which is famous for afternoon tea, serving super crappy bagged tea. Mighty Leaf? Are you kidding me? I know 99% of people out there don't care about tea, but for the tea lovers out there who may be expecting more from a breakfast spot affiliated with the Peninsula, get ready pay out the nose to have grocery store tea with your breakfast! Strangely, my coffee drinks were a little inconsistent. I had a great cappuccino that totally made my morning, but when I ordered another, I got a latte. I mean, I think the person making it indented to make a cappuccino, but it came out a latte. Still tasty, but, you know, not the same drink...Yeah, I am that person. Anyhow, overall we had a great experience here.  They had a pastry case up front filled with beautiful sweets, and I really wanted to get one, though I never had the chance.

We also did not receive our food for over 40 minutes when I finally got up to ask someone else. The dishes were sub par at best - an average egg fritada with ""sun dried tomatoes"" that was bland and tasted of regular tomatoes; a Belgium waffle dish that came with a bug on a waffle and sour tasting whipped cream. Fruit flies also surrounded our dishes.

Anticipating, then slowly, very slowly savoring every bite. The same goes for reviewing. When I love a place, more often than not - I jump on the computer and write a paragraph or two to celebrate their glory. Or I wait. This time, I waited.  Almost a month. Pierrot Gourmet is one of this rare spots in Chicago where I feel like home. The name, the atmosphere, the food, the wine, the aesthetics....yes, it's home alright. French without the snobby Parisian attitude; just the chic. Do I like? No. I LOVE. My friend and I ogled the flammenkuechen side of the menu, and were instantly sold. So, now - these are not German my friends. But with such a name they have to, you say?!? I know, I know, it's a little confusing. But the Alsatian dialect is very close to German....and flammenkuechen - or flam, to make it simple - are a staple of Alsatian cuisine. And of my childhood spent in Lorraine, just next door. The snobbish Parisians, not very good at twist-tongues, would call them 'tartes flambées'. It was as good as I remembered. Maybe even better. Nostalgia does that to you. To keep it somewhat 'healthy' we also shared the best salad I had the pleasure to order in a very long time: the Pen Chicken Salad. Greens of course, dried cranberries, fresh pear, pistachios, bits of bacon, manchego cheese, pulled rotisserie chicken drizzled with a smoky bacon vinaigrette. Pinch yourself, you are not dreaming.

He had been once before for coffee and dessert. Just a short walk down Rush brought us to the hidden fresh cafe nestled inside the Peninsula Cafe.  We were quickly seated at a table, because unfortunately there was a 10-15 minute wait for outdoor seating, which I was bummed. I ordered an iced tea. My friend ordered a diet coke. We were both intrigued by the soup of the day (potato leek with truffle oil. The flavor was creamy and very balanced. I didn't even need to add salt and pepper like most soups from restaurants/cafes. I opted for the soup special of the day- cantaloupe ""soup"" which was more like a gazpacho. It was a chilled puree of cantaloupe followed by a skewer of cantaloupe, basil, and prosciutto. I thought it was very light and refreshing. It was almost like a sweet/savory popsicle. Strange simile I know. The main entrees were for (friend) the pen salad. I mentioned to him that I read on yelp about the raving reviews of how delish it was. He concurred. The roasted chicken had great flavor. I changed my order (because I can never decide!) from the quiche ""Lorraine"" to the Orange Marscapone Crepe. I have to say I was bit disappointed. The cheese was all melted and I was left with a soppy wet orange liquor, butter, cheese sauce in the skillet. Don't get me wrong, it was good, just not what I expected. The friend and I agreed that it might have been better served as a cold crepe. The warm crepe cooled down that smeared with the marscapone mixture and drizzled with the orange liquor, then finished off with the sprinkle of almonds and orange zest. I also felt that it fell flat on flavor. Marscapone is very rich but not very flavorful. I thought vanilla bean would have added more depth to it.  Overall, the place was cute, the price was a bit obnoxious, but that's what you get for bordering The Peninsula Hotel.

Even though last time I was there they were no longer serving coffee in bowls, it's still delicious (if a little less fun to drink)--deep and rich without being acidic. The European breakfast is amazing, and they have a killer steak salad. I recommend saving room for the cherry cobbler, which is tart but tempered by the cinnamon, or the creme brulee, which is just how it should be, all richness smoothness underneath its shell. It's expensive (if all you're looking to do is pick up a cup of coffee and a salad, that can be done at sundry other places for a fraction of the cost), but it shouldn't come as a shock, since you're dining at a cafe attached to the Peninsula Hotel. It's worth it for the atmosphere and the occasional need to spoil yourself. The inside is wonderful--the decorating is warm and inviting and cozy.

It's a strange place mainly because I would not expect to find something so cute in this part of town. I am salivating as a write this. I had the BEST frittata I have ever had. The best.

I didn't though, mainly because I was on a first date. Nevermind the fact that I was in public. I would have done it anyway. The service was spotty. The quarters were kind of cramped. And yes, it is expensive for what you get. That being said, I would definitely eat here again.  Now I know you're dying to know how my date ended? Did he get laid? Did I kiss him? Did I kick him in the nuts? None of the above my friends. At the end of the date, he told me that he only changes his sheets once a month. I groaned and he said, ""But wait. You will be so proud of me. I turned over a new leaf in 2005 when I actually began using linens. Until that time, I only slept on a mattress. I had it all figured out."" No, apparently you didn't and still don't have it figured out Mr. MIT PhD. If you did,  you would know that women aren't aroused by bare mattresses or month old sheets.

The professional, courteous, efficient wait staff guaranteed that I would be returning for another delicious respite off the Mag Mile.
