Some of the food from one box was in the other. It honestly looked like it was run over. Surprisingly, the food was still warm. We ordered the pot roast, which wasn't dry but didn't have a lot of gravy.  We also ordered the onion rings, which were huge but didn't taste that great. The last order was the avocado shrimp wrap. The wrap was huge and VERY tasty - so large it'll also be lunch for tomorrow. The sweet potato tots as the side were perfect.

A woman picked up and before I could even finish saying the words ""take out"" I was put on hold.  However, I really wanted this chicken Caesar salad so I patiently waited on hold. 5 minutes. 10 minutes. 15 minutes. All the while I got to listen to the lively conversation of the servers-- a mix of swear words & relationship statuses.  After 17 minutes on hold I realized it would be quicker to walk to their location than wait any longer. So after 21 minutes on hold, my girlfriend and I are standing at the bar. No one ever approached. All the while.... still on hold.  It wasn't until 22 minutes on hold when we were hung up on.

The drinks are poured well and the food is very good, albeit classic bar food. Supposedly everything is fresh, which I believe.

Special shout-out to Jess who we've had as a waitress several times now. She made us feel like regular's on our very first visit and is the gold standard by which all other servers should be judged. Truly Fantastic.  It's a great atmosphere for a group of friends or a family dinner, and the food is fantastic. The menu is surprisingly large and varied, everyone will surely be able to find what they're looking for. I'm continuously impressed by their ability to serve multiple different types of great food. Just a few of the things I've loved at Bridget's include burgers, pizza, wraps, sandwiches, fish and chips, ribs, shepherds pie, sriracha mac and cheese, even jambalaya. The one must order item on the menu however, is the sweet potato tots. They're amazing. I also highly recommend their brunch menu on the weekends.

2016-05-07,4.0,"I actually really like Bridget's.  It first seem like a hotel bar.  But it's really not.  It's much more like a neighborhood bar, grill, sports pub and such. Let's start with the beer and alcohol, since it's a bar.  Their beer selection is good.  Not great, but good.  They have some nice selections on tap, and a few more in bottles.  No, not the best in the world, or even in the neighborhood.  But a good selection and a few that are more or less unique to Bridgets.  Of course, they have a full bar as well. Their food is also good.  Think fairly typical pub fare but with a bit of a twist.  Their pizzas are quite good, as are their burgers and various sandwiches.  I have yet to try everything they have to offer, but what I have tried was quite good.  And, if you want something a little different, a variation or substitution, ask them and they will set you up.  They seem really flexible. And on tat topic, the staff.  They are awesome.  I was sitting off to the side once, watching a game.  I ordered my second beer and the bartender got busy and forgot about me for a bit.  No big deal, really.  But when he realized that he had forgotten me, he bought me a beer on him.  Way too nice, but greatly appreciated.  It's this kind of customer focus that brings me back. Bridget's is a great place, with good food, good drinks, and better people.  Definitely worth a visit.",0.9963,0.698,0.257,0.044,0.47125000000000006
2016-03-20,4.0,"I used to be a regular here as I used to live within a block and I have been back occasionally for a beer and trivia. It's a nice secret gem as the next closet bar/restaurant is on Broadway. Bridget McNeill's a good place to watch a sports game as they have a good amount of TVs and you can almost always find a seat. It does have a cozy atmosphere and it's not too loud to have a conversation with someone. The staff is pretty friendly as well and food comes out timely.   Their food is good and it is relatively cheap compared to a lot of other places in Chicago. It's your typical bar food. I usually get their West Coast Turkey Wrap, Turkey Club, or a burger. Their sweet potato tots are pretty solid as well. I also recommend their Mac and Cheese and Fish and Chips. I never had their pizza, but it looked pretty good.  They have a good selection of liquor. One thing I wish that they had is a bigger draft selection as I am a huge craft beer fan. I don't think they have changed their draft list in the past two years, but a $5 Two Hearted Ale on Wednesday nights is a great deal! One of my favorite shots is an Irish Car Bomb. However, they don't have any of the ingredients, but they make it just as good by using Left Hand Milk Stout, Tullamore Dew, and Rumchata. I call it the Bridget McNeil's Irish Bomb.

For the purpose of an accurate review, I will only speak to the current management, food, service, amenities to which I have been exposed. Entering the bar is awkward. There's no clear signage and you have to enter through an apartment door on the side. I know this now, but it was embarrassing walking around outside trying to find the entrance. I understand that most of the clientele is from the apartment above it. However, for new clientele that do not live in the building, such as myself,  I would recommend some basic signage  to avoid those unfortunate circumstances.  Service has always been decent. The wait staff is friendly and quick. I did see them congregating around the bar chit-chatting with each other while my party was waiting for the check last time I went. It was approaching closing time, so I can understand this as things were winding down and they were probably excited to clock out. They have a variety of board games you can play as well which can foster lively conversation.  The food is pretty good, consistent bar food. I ordered the Sunrise BLT last time I went. This sandwich is a BLT with Avocado and an egg on top of that. It came with a side of sweet potato tots, which were awesome!

Everytime I come with my boyfriend he gives me the same cranberry and vodka ( at least I think it is vodka he mixes).  When it comes to food the only thing I really love here is the pretzel and cheese and wings as well. I mean I've had better wings but for a bar food it is good.

The sriracha mac and Cheese is so-so.  However, on my last visit this past Sunday everything food wise I ordered was wrong and the food tasted a bit weirder. For instance the Inferno Burger had nothing that made it the inferno burger...in fact it had Swiss cheese instead of cheddar and then none of the special toppings that the burger usually includes. The mashed potatoes I received with the burger were not the normal ones I've gotten there before, no flavor and so bland. I compare them to powdered mashed potatoes at an elementary school cafeteria. I didn't even want to finish them.  All that being said, I think the cook was new and needs some training from the other staff members.

As good as Joe's stone crab which is one of the best of I've had.  Also.

2014-03-25,5.0,"5 stars all the way! Bridget's hosted a surprise party for my husband this weekend. It was a fantastic experience from start to finish. When I first started looking for places to have the party, I started getting minimum $$ that I had to spend at the restaurants (for a Sunday afternoon?). I didn't really get that. When I called Bridget's and talked with Sam (the manager), he told me that was not something he liked and definitely not something he would do at his restaurant. Huge plus. He took my information and sent me a quote for the party within a few days. As I got the invite list together, I realized there were probably going to be a lot more guests than I had initially estimated (about 80 vs 50). I asked Sam if they would still be able to accommodate us, and he said that was not a problem and they were happy to have us. During the whole process of planning, Sam was quick to respond to my e-mails, and said that it was most important to him that all the guests really enjoyed themselves. He made some recommendations for the party menu, and different ways they could serve the food (all at once, in shifts, etc). He was fine with letting us bring in a sign and a cake. He told me they would honor drink specials on that day as well ($8 pitchers of mimosas and $10 pitchers of Bloody Marys!) On the day of the party, I had no worries (except to get the guest of honor there around the planned time), and the entire staff at Bridget's further guaranteed that I need not have any. The food came out as planned, no one was without a drink if they wanted one, dishes were cleared quickly, and the staff was just overall very friendly and helpful. Also, the food was delicious! We had sliders, chicken strips, two different salads with a variety of dressings, nachos, stuffed mushrooms, and bruschetta with a white bean dip as well as the tomato topping. (I especially enjoyed the chicken strips- YUM). Come here for delicious pub food in a relaxed and friendly setting with great service!",0.9964,0.769,0.2,0.031,0.6055555555555555

2013-10-07,3.0,"I went to Bridget's with the idea of getting some pub grub and a drink or two. Upon arrival, I wavered on the grub part because I was apprehensive about a place like Bridget's having good food based on the atmosphere and the thin crowd. So ultimately I decided to only have one drink at Bridget's.  Bridget's is in sort of an odd location for a pub. It's down at the bottom of a building in the turnaround. What's more, I just couldn't escape the feeling that a pool was once where this bar is. The floors, ceiling and walls all just said pool to me. I'm sure if I lived in the building I'd get accustomed to it and forget it, but this prevailing thought just can't be shaken. Mind you, I got a good pour of the black stuff and service with a smile, so there was certainly nothing wrong with the service or the product.  Lastly, the crowd when I was at Bridget's, while thin, was somewhat older, although there was a raucous bachelorette party doing that silly painting party thing.  If I lived in the building or in the neighborhood, I'd probably rate Bridget's higher, but it was pretty much a three-star experience for me.",0.9805,0.818,0.155,0.027,0.5908352229780801

2013-05-22,2.0,"First, to be fair, I would give Bridget's a current rating of 2.5 stars if I could.  At this time, they are perfectly middle-of-the-road. However, while I was also a neighborhood regular prior to the ownership change, I can honestly say that I'll continue to be a regular.  While the prior incarnation did have a comfortable, neighborhood ""Cheers"" vibe, it did need a tweak here and there.  What's more, for every step back, I genuinely believe the new owner is trying to take two steps forward.  It simply takes time.  That said, here's one guy's specific likes and dislikes so far. Interior/Exterior: Good - New bar configuration and high-top seating by the window and pole.  Fresh paint, new patio furniture and flower boxes.   Bad - Bring back the the bar lamp post?  Please replace the ceiling fan bulbs with soft bulbs - those clear bulb suck.  Oh, and what's with the art?  I don't get it. Ugly - I REALLY dislike the concrete floors!  It's too noisy now and half of the ""cozy"" feel went out the door with the carpet. Menu: Good - Love the new wings, though I wish you'd toss them in the kitchen, using a traditional Buffalo sauce.  Fish and chips.  Homemade potato chips, though I'd slice them thicker and charge $2 (great bargain, despite the whiners).  The Classic pizzas.  Your burgers.   Bad - Higher prices and smaller portions are an issue.  A good portion size at a reasonable price is key to a neighborhood pub.  $19 for a 14"" pizza - really???  I begrudgingly get the removal of popcorn machine, but it wouldn't hurt my feelings if it came back. Ugly - I feel horrible writing this, but the harsh reality is the chef just doesn't do it for me.  Most of the menu changes and additions are average at best and the menu is all over the place - ""Tonight's menu features spaghetti and meatballs or chicken and waffles with orange butter.""  Huh???  The foundation of a ""neighborhood pub"" is value - better than average, traditional pub fare, with a few unique items that sets them apart, all at value pricing.  I don't need Teriyaki-style Cedar Plank Salmon, w/ jasmine rice and sauteed spinach.  Just make me a good Ahi burger on ciabatta, add some of your excellent fries, and serve it at a reasonable price.       Beer/Booze: Good - The addition of more tap beers!!!  Solid liquor selection for bar size. Bad - You need even more beers on tap!!! Ugly - I know I'm not the only one, because I've heard the conversations, but your beer selection is just... well... weird.  I know it's summer, but you I think you have more wheat beers than lagers.  Where's an English Bitter or a Murphy's to counter the Guinness?  Are you an Irish/English bar or not? Staff/Service: Good - Admittedly, you have to get to know some of them over time, but all of the servers and bartenders have ended up being friendly, genuine and actually take time out for personal interaction with customers. Bad - Even the good ones can sometimes use familiarity with their customers to let things slide sometimes, whether it's speed, attitude or what have you. Ugly - I swear it's nothing personal, but for lack of a better definition, I just don't think a formal dining chef is useful, necessary or even particularly wanted in the neighborhood pub setting.  An occasional solicitation of feedback from the regulars is great, but I'd rather see you in the kitchen, trying to figure out why the club sandwich is served on multi-grain, instead of sourdough or white as it should be.  :) Again, just one guy's opinion.  But echoing what others are saying, I think your major challenge right now is deciding what you want to be.  I say think about and listen to your present and near future neighborhood demographic - they're telling you... are you listening?

We discovered some new things about this place that we didn't even notice last time being there due to the enormous crowd.    This place is actually more cozy feeling when there aren't that many people there. While I wasn't sitting that far away from the back the first time I was there, I didn't even see the cute fireplace and comfy lounge area that they have for customers. It gives the bar a home library type feel while sitting in the back.  The bar up front and the area in the center are decorated more pub style allowing you to not forget that you are in a pub even though you may feel at home. The sweet lamp posts on the bar are a really cool touch.    For the first time, my fiance and I were also able to sit comfortably and enjoy dinner here. Last time, we ordered their tasty french fries, but it was so packed that it just  took too long to even bother getting other food. This time, we ordered your typical pub food stuff; however, the food is way tastier than your normal pub food. You will also find new items on the menu that you will not only find in your typical pub, but also in many restaurants. First off, the croquettes were fantastic. They were literally one of the best palatte pleasing appetizers I have had at a place (now that makes two of the ""best"" food items I have had anywhere that come from here).   Their croquettes are filled with three different type of baked cheeses in a fried mozerella type crust formed in a ball that sit on a platter of a very tasty marinara type sauce. HIGHLY recommended.  They are also not skimpy with their avacado on their sandwiches like many other pubs are (if other pubs even offer avacado slices on sandwiches). It was also on cibatta bread. Yummy. It exploded with flavor. My fiance had the chicken sandwich there, and that was even tastier than what I had. I want one now. The chef (who is also the owner) is not your typical ""pub food"" cook. He puts a spin on his food. There has only been one other bar/pub I have been to that had me saying, ""Holy cow, this food is delicious."" Now, there weren't many people in the bar when we went, but we also went around dinner time and not 10pm. One would think that if there weren't a lot of people there, then maybe the waitresses go up to their customers more being kind of a nuissance. Not here. I really liked that our waitress was friendly and helpful, but not ""in your face every second"" annoying while we were enjoying our meals.    The only thing that I am still disappointed about is not wanting to be there for their quiz nights, because I am a big fan of quiz nights in bars. It gets way too crazy and claustrophobic for me. A bar that packed where you have to sit against a wall the whole night or stand because all of the tables are literally taken well in advance is not my scene; however, it's not like that every night, so that makes me happy.If you like crazy filled bars, quiz nights, and excellent pub food, then go there on Wednesday. If not, go there another day and try the croquettes. My fiance and I will be back.",0.9954,0.851,0.122,0.027,0.5338101604278075

Yowzers. We started off with some spinach artichoke dip which was yummy. It was served with homemade pita triangles that were just a bit fried, greasy, and delicious. There were chunks of artichoke, spinach, and tomatoes. Mmmmm, I'm drooling. I then had the baja wrap aka a HUGE chicken, guac, salsa, cheese wrap. It was very tasty & fresh, but the chicken was really cold & I would have preferred it heated up. No fault of Bridget's, just a personal preference. Ryan got the steak quesadilla's, which blew my wrap outta the water. It was loaded with onions, peppers, and steak & came with sides of guac, sour cream, and salsa. I was really jealous of his entree, but he was kind enough to share.  Megan was a lovely waitress & was v. attentive. She's super cute too, just sayin.
