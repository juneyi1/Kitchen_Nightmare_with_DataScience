2017-09-01,4.0,Went here for breakfast while visiting Chicago. The breakfast was really good. The selection is very basic but the food was really good. The prices are very good too. I ordered the 2 egg plate with fruit & whole wheat toast. The fruit came first--which was great! The eggs were cooked exactly how I like them.,0.9677,0.703,0.297,0.0,0.5060714285714286
2017-08-29,5.0,If you need a drink and can only afford one - go to Ceres. This place is lowkey during the day but it's prime time is 5 pm on Friday (Thursday nights can sometimes be a big night as well). Ceres is in The Board of Trade and they make the strongest cocktails ever - don't order a margarita- it will take like a handful of Tequila shots. They literally fill an entire glass with alcohol and then put a splash of the chaser - like you're coke comes on the side or your glass of rum. People start the night here and then go to Reverie or another bar after because it closes early (I believe 8 pm). Warning: don't drink more than two drinks.,0.8047,0.893,0.083,0.025,0.505

2017-06-01,1.0,"It has been awhile since I've had truly terrible service. And last night's experience at Ceres won the prize by far. This was probably the worst service I've had in years!. First of all, from the moment I walked in, staff was inattentive and not helpful in directing me to the patio section where we wanted to sit. After a few minutes, I pointed to the ""happy hour draft beer"" section of the menu and asked the waiter what kind the Three Floyd's seasonal was. His response was, ""It's like a beer."" This conversation went on for another minute... What kind of beer? ""It's the seasonal"". But what kind is it? ""What do you mean?"" Is it a wheat? Ipa? Pale ale? ""I don't know, it's the seasonal"". After some prompting, he finally went to the bar to ask. I did get an answer eventually (it was an American pale ale) and I ordered. Later, my friend ordered a wine and it came out in a dirty glass. She pointed it out to him and she asked for a new one. The second glass of wine also came out in a dirty glass... it actually looked like the same glass because it looked like the same dirty spots. After we asked for the drink to come out in a clean glass (this would be the 3rd glass), he said to my friend that her wine glass came out dirty (twice) because we were sitting outside and there's just stuff flying around. That's pretty much a quote. ""The glass is dirty because you're sitting outside and there's just lots of stuff flying around...."" Then he said... ""I'm not going to give you wine any more. You have to order something else because all the glasses are going to be like this."" Even though the service was so bad, the beers were cold and the chips/salsa/guac tasted fine. We did not order anything else though and due to the horrendous service, I will not be returning to this restaurant.",0.9416,0.785,0.13,0.085,0.5160462735462736

2017-03-03,2.0,"Ceres Cafe has changed so much and not for the better.  Ceres Cafe was once a hidden gem that attracted Stock Brokers / Traders, Government Employees, and a variety of those working office jobs in the Financial district of the Chicago Loop. You could go with friends and chat with strangers over drinks that were poured so strongly that even the fastest drinker learned to sip. Now, it's a mad house times ten!  Ceres Cafe attracts a large crowd of those who just want to get drunk for less than $10.The patrons come from all over the city pushing in the now long lines wrapped around the door on Thursday's and Friday's. Security is needed on most days because patrons actually engage in fist fights and other violent acts after a few too many. This was once a place where you could go alone for a drink and find yourself chatting up a friendly stranger. Now you are likely to be followed against your will if you dare try to come across as ""too friendly"" it can be easily misinterpreted as an open invitation by the overly aggressive men who now patronize this place.  In my last days of stopping by Ceres, the following happened: 1 - A completely wasted stranger walked over and took a hot wing off my plate and ate it. 2 - A guy across the bar took several pictures of me with his phone and then called me a b***h because I politely asked him not to take pictures of me.  3 - Two girls visiting the bar with their male co-worker got into a fist fight because they both liked the same guy, but he wasn't interested in either of them. It's kind of scary to have two girls punching each other while standing next to you. Please don't miss lady's, because I can't have anyone messing up my face. I am not interested in a Black eye. 4 - A drunk guy approached the table to flirt with my friend and insisted that he wanted to make out with me. After attempting to steal my friends debit card he kept trying to kiss me. I was screaming for help for three minutes and being completely ignored, I convinced this drunken fool to exit the table. It sounds funny, but I'm 5'1 and he was well over 6'0 tall I was terrified. Ceres bartenders, waitstaff, security guards, and other patrons did absolutely NOTHING.  5 - Several of the very mild-mannered and extremely sweet waitresses had the worst case of oral herpes, I have ever seen in my entire life. Imagine someone handing you a menu and their entire mouth is covered in oozing cold sores. :( They were so kind, but.... it doesn't make you want to order anything.  6- My glass had lip prints on it, which is terrifying if you refer back to #5.  7 - They stamp your hand like it's a club. You leave and you may not be able to get back in due to the huge crowd of people waiting to enter. Try explaining to a security guard that your coat, umbrella, and friends are sitting inside waiting on you when he's already at capacity because when you left he let someone in to replace you. *sigh* Terrible.  So, with this being said unless you are a bit low on funds and cannot afford to buy drinks in a less crowded place this establishment is more of a hassle than it's ever been. They have friendly bartenders, but it doesn't make up for the way the crowd has changed over the years. I don't know if a business can fix this. They may need to close for renovations and move the bar to the middle of the floor to have a better view for security and start charging more, which sucks.",-0.1097,0.765,0.119,0.116,0.48749111584932464

My friend and I decided to have dinner there one Friday and we were about to pay our bill which came out to $50. I usually give a small tip on the paper and give more cash to the waiter. Everything was finished as far as my card and I was waiting for the waitress to come back to get the rest of her tip but a short white male came to out table and told me that my $2 tip was unacceptable. I ask what his problem was as he cannot tell me how to tip. A tip is not guaranteed and he cannot tell me how I choose to spend my money. He then tell me that he checks all of the waiters tips to make sure that everyone tips more than 5%. If I'm not mistaken 5% of a $50 bill is only $2.50?!?!? He then tells me that many of his waitresses tend to quit because of the low tips. I then proceed to tell him that maybe he needs to increase their pay. I also tell him that every waitress already knows the expectations of the job. You make $6, $7, or $8 with the added tips, which are not guaranteed. I do not have to tip anyone anything and for him to tell me that I needed to tip a certain amount was just rude. He then tell me that if I continue to tip this way that he would have me banned from the establishment!!! How can you ban someone for actually leaving a tip?!?!? It's not like I left $0 and I still had money in my hand that I was planning on giving the waitress when she came back. Long story short, I went back the following week and only got an apology from another manager who didn't know for sure who the person was because she claims they have temporary staff come in when things get busy. I felt extremely offended and would have at least gotten compensated for my troubles. If I do go back, as I do often, and I see that worker, I will definitely speak with him and the owner.",-0.816,0.806,0.091,0.102,0.43122519841269846

I had never been but my friends strongly recommended it as their drinks were ""good and strong"". We made it at about 345 and were seated quickly. The restaurant was PACKED and pretty busy so we weren't taken back that the waitress hadnt approached us immediately. In fact a nice waitress from a nearby section came to our table (about ten to fifteen mins in) and apologized for the high wait time then told us our waitress would be with us in two minutes. Fast forward another 15 minutes (no lie its 415/420 by now) and still no one has been to our table. We watch as our waitress (Helena) serves the tables surrounding us. We wait a few minutes more and then my friend stops her and asks if we can be served because ""we've been waiting thirty minutes now just to order"". Helena debates her and tells her ""you haven't waited thirty minutes AND it's busy"". We watch her try to walk away and my friend begins to stop her and tell her the orders for the table. Helena was annoyed at this point but takes the order down anyway. About five minutes later we have our drinks (Traders Punch) , which btw were delicious! Then a few minutes later we have our appetizers. Cool? Hmm nah! Helena puts a large plate of cheese fries on the table. We all look confused and seeing as to how terrible our first interaction was, we reluctantly tell her that we didn't ask for cheese fries but for a large plate of regular fries. Strike two! Helena proceeds to tell us that that's what we ordered lol... I suggest just eating the fries because I wanted her to go away... But Helena insists she get the other ones and so she does.. Cool? Hmmmm nope! Helena comes back with a SMALL plate of regular fries... I'm being punked right? Then we explain again what we asked for... We stop and say, ""can you just bring one more order of small REGULAR fries?"".... She obliges and walks away. Ten minutes pass and we realize she's never coming back to our table. We flag down the other waitress in the section next to us and she grabs the manager/owner. He clearly flustered AND busy apologizes and comps us a plate of chips w/ salsa and guac. While we appreciated it, it didn't help any further that night. Helena came back to rush us out (we were still drinking and by this time there were open tables near us). She wanted us to close out the tab (still intended to spend more money) and then came back every few minutes to ensure we didn't walk out on the bill. We paid the bill and my friend was pissed. So pissed that she wrote on the bill, "" no tip, get some manners"" lol. Before I move on, I understand how petty this is but at the time of the incident... Helena got what she deserved.. I've never seen such blatant disrespect from a server in my life.  Five minutes later Helena kneels down next to my friend and I and says ""YOU PEOPLE are the ones who need some manners, get!"" Things got foggy after that because everyone including myself began arguing with her. The manager was again apologetic but insincere and eventually stopped listening to the story... Helena came over and acted as if she had done nothing wrong and we left feeling sad.

The restaurant was recently redecorated with an art deco feel. Definitely a much needed and appreciated improvement. In addition, the menu was re-concepted with an edge toward more healthy options.

They were given menus and their food even before we got to see a menu. We did not even get complimentary bread while we were waiting. Our waitress was also very short when we asked for napkins and to explain what kind of vegetables their lunch special came with. The food was also not that impressive. We ordered the special of the day which was a fried filet fish with tortilla soup. It was $9.95. A cup of soda was $2.25. The soup was salty and the fish was sour, probably too much lemon. The fish was also not very fresh. I would not go back based on the poor service and mediocre food. Not sure if it was because we were dressed casually or it was because I have a disability. It might have also been because it was at an off hour but other people who were dressed casually seemed to have gotten better service.

The only complaint that I have is that they started charging for a side of your mixer and they used to just give you the can on the side.

The food here is pretty straight forward American. I love the french fries, which come with all of the sandwiches, and where else can you get a good tuna melt for lunch in the Loop? Nowhere that I know of. My coworker and I love to go here when we want some no nonsense comfort food at a good price. My favorites are the tuna melt, bot club, and chicken pot pie. It's the type of place that serves out the food that you imagine it would look like when you hear about it (that makes no sense--roll with it!). This is one of my favorite lunch spots--it's not the healthiest and doesn't have the most creative food (I certainly wouldn't come here on a day when I wasn't at work), but when I crave some diner food, nothing else fits the bill quite like Ceres.",0.972,0.81,0.161,0.029,0.5453416149068322
2014-02-14,4.0,"Ceres isn't for the weak.  2 words I'd use to explain Ceres are: Alcoholics Paradise.  Ceres is BY FAR the best pour for a drink in the city of Chicago.  They take stiff drinks to another level.  Your rum and coke is essentially a glass of rum and they either splash some coke (and its really just a splash) or just give you a full glass of rum and hand you a coke to pour your troubles.  And thats with every drink there.  Most people are done by their 2nd drink.  And if you are really a lightweight, you may not even make it through the first one.  Its been countless times where you will see people passed out in booths or just plain drunk falling off the barstool.   Their food is average but no one goes here for the food.  Going to Ceres for the food is like going to the strip club for conversation.  Its great they have it but thats not what you are there for.   Because of the popularity of Ceres in the last couple years, Friday after work has became the meeting spot.  Its even gotten to the point where you may wait outside to get in.  Its always packed on Fridays now so unless you have a friend who managed to get a table before the rush, be prepared to packed in there.  And the best part about Ceres is the fact you can take your drink to go in a to go cup.  You can just go to back and grab one.  Considering how much alcohol they give you, drinks are extremely cheap especially for downtown.  I'd recommend if its your 1st time going, go during the week.",0.9861,0.851,0.124,0.026,0.42748447204968937

Keep in mind that the restaurant markets itself as a cafe and not a steakhouse. Cafes generally appeal to all audiences and diets, and this is where the place disappointed. As a vegetarian, there were zero main courses on the menu that I could eat. I can accept that if restaurants can work around that (for instance, provide a veggie patty in lieu of meat), but they had no such options. As such, I ended up leaving simply because I wasn't able to order anything - in a cafe in Chicago, a city whose restaurants normally appeal to an extremely diverse community. Even a basic, rudimentary veggie burger would have sufficed, as I'm not at all a picky eater outside of my single ethical restriction. Essentially, I had an easier time eating at Buffalo Wild Wings than I did here. That's disappointing.

On another occasion, which forever ruined Cere's for me, again after asking multiple times to see a food menu, and then asking to order, and then waiting for it to arrive, I asked the waiter if he knew about how long the food would take (politely--I really just wanted to know if I should continue to stuff my face with popcorn or wait for the food.  I wasn't upset at that point, having become used to everything at Cere's taking forever).  His response was, ""Well, it has to cook, baby.""  With the most infuriating, condescending smirk. I have never in my life been so disrespected by a waiter, and still wish my friends had not talked me out of speaking with a manager that night--after his remark, we should not have paid the 18% gratuity that he added to our tab.    Overall, Ceres is fine if you're poor and want a very strong drink, and sometimes the service isn't intolerable (like I said, I've been there many times), but the times it has been bad have ruined it for me.  To be safe, I'd recommend going elsewhere.",-0.3423,0.842,0.08,0.078,0.47693333333333326

About halfway through my salad I noticed I did not have ANY avocado, red peppers, or green peppers on my salad. By then it was too late to send it back, so make sure you check that you got what you asked for! I feel like they are SOO busy the cooks must be overwhelmed and mess up on orders. So in the end my salad only had lettuce, chicken, tomato, and feta on it. The so-so: Kind of a frat house atmosphere. Extremely crowded, can't hear the person next to you, people walking and standing around, popcorn all over the ground, waitresses getting bumped into and spilling drinks, liquor promotion girls walking around in short skirts giving away free mini-shots, drunks all over, etc. But that's what it's supposed to be like, just keep in mind the type of atmosphere it has! Somewhat slow service, but they were soooo busy that its justifiable. Didn't even get a glass of water with our meals!!! The good Inexpensive food, inexpensive and strong drinks, very lively. Free popcorn if you are there during dinner hours (we did have to bug our waitress about getting some to our table though).

I was so looking forward to having a new place to go, and, one that sounded like it would be low-key and unpretentious. The restaurant definitely is low-key. It appears to be managed and staffed by several long-time employees, which is frankly refreshing to see. It was also very crowded, with several clients being greeted by first name. The menu is pretty standard -- salads, burgers, etc. They had a few interesting specials that day, including a pot roast that one of my guests had and spoke highly of. I had the much-touted grilled cheese and it was fine. Just fine - nothing great. The cole slaw was quite good. And for this alone, I would go back. I had a side salad, however, that was pretty disgusting. Lots of rusty lettuce that I left on the plate without any apology from the waitstaff. So - why the three stars? Well, in part because while the food wasn't offensive (except for that nasty salad), it was also not great. But mostly, the three stars are there because of some highly unprofessional behavior we witnessed as we left the restaurant. Our server told us to settle up at the cash register, instead of with her at the table. She offered this because we suddenly realized the time and needed to dash, and she thought the regiser would be faster for us. So, up we went to the register where we ran into -- there really is no better word for this -- a gaggle of servers. About 6 or 7 waitstaff were hanging out at the register waiting to get tipped out. (I should note that this was at about 1:30 pm - and the restaurant was still pretty full. I was absolutely confused why they were settling up the till when the lunch crowd was still there.) The gaggle did not move for us until one of us expressly said something to get their attention. At this point, the lead waitstaff -- the woman working the register -- told us we would have to wait because she was removing something that was stuck in her hand. And, indeed, there she was -- a waitstaff member doing minor surgery on her hand with a seweing needle, using the main counter as her work service. Classy. To make things worse, once we said we wanted to settle up with her, she grabbed out tickets and said, ""Whose table was this? I'll bet it was xxxx."" Then the gaggle laughed and nodded in agreement. She continued, ""She's probably too busy talking to actually do any work."" SO - completely unprofessional. AND, completely contrary to our experience with the waitstaff there. In fact, the ONLY waitstaff we saw working that day was OUR server. It was the gaggle who were lollygagging about, too busy criticizing their colleagues in front of customers to actually ring them up. We were so annoyed by the whole experience and found their behavior quite off-putting.  So - yeah - three stars. Be nice people. We've got just this one life. Someone not pulling their weight?

We replaced the chicken parmesian with the salmon.  It was quite good. The hamburger was good, but despite a request, no mustard was provided.  (It's interesting that in ""mustard town Chicago,"" the ketchup is there, but not the mustard!)

Grippin' it and rippin' it without much an ounce of class, Ceres is the after hours playground located dab smack in the middle of the Board of Trade and is the perfect fiddle for downtown workers looking for trouble by the ounce. Ceres gets CROWDED. You might find every seat, every table, barstool, and inch of carpet occupied by one person or another not sure on what direction they're trying to go. Dedication and focus will be rewarded once you sit down surrounded by 1970's decor and your server magically appears. Take my recommendation: Skip the beer and hit up the COCKTAILS!  I had heard from many a reveler tell tales of the stiffness of these drinks. Order a gin and tonic, you will get a can of tonic on the side. The stiffness of these cocktails is hard enough to break many a man so I advise caution to sip slowly and drink out of your can before you find yourself scuttled in front of the statues beside the Board.",0.4819,0.93,0.038,0.032,0.5014957264957265

2011-12-28,3.0,"Location: 4 out of 5 This category is biased, as I work a mere block and a half away from 141 W. Jackson.  Public transportation is plentiful, and as others have mentioned, the clientele (at least at lunch) ranges from those working in the public sector to those working in finance. Customer Service: 3.5 out of 5 I was seated very quickly, and my waitress was for all intents and purposes, very quick to bring out my drink, food, and the basket of assorted breads and crackers.  She was also quick to refill my water.  But hrm...she lacked a certain...I can't put my finger on it.  Oh wait, yes I can.  She lacked friendliness and charisma.  I would have happily waited a few extra minutes here and there had she just smiled once or asked how I was doing before curtly taking my order.  And maybe it's due to the other diners who come in who are just ""come in, eat, get out"", but I personally would have appreciated just a little bit more personal interaction.  I do need to reiterate that service was very quick and efficient though. Ambience: 3.5 out of 5 The main dining room does look a tad nostalgic.  It's almost like eating at an old-school diner with the wood trim everywhere.  Think an upscale cafeteria like S and S, but with more inviting booths but commensurate tables.   I went on a weekday between Christmas and New Year, and found that it was very quiet and peaceful, even with other customers there.   Selection of food: 4 out of 5 Actually - the selection was quite eclectic.  Burgers, fish sandwiches, lots of salads, open faced turkey sandwiches, open faced roast beef sandwiches, roasted turkey with dressing, liver sausage sandwiches, even food of the Tex Mex persuasion, and even steak.  Daily specials rotate, so it may be a good idea to check them out first.   Quality of food: 3 out of 5 I myself had the open faced roast beef sandwich with mashed potatoes and gravy.  I would rate it as being average to slightly above average.  The beef portions were generous, but noticeably chewy/tough.  The gravy wasn't made from any discernable drippings of any meat product (shucks), but it was a good complement to both the beef and the potatoes.  Plus, gravy on white bread is pretty delicious, though most of you would probably never admit that. Price of food: 3 out of 5 Commensurate with most sit-down full service places in the loop.  Burgers are probably a little cheaper than Poag Mahones, sandwiches seemed to be right on par with what I've seen elsewhere, and the ""full dinners"" are priced similarly to Berghoff.   This may be the only place where you can get two drinks for the same price as your food... but beware. Overall Rating of Cocktail: 2.25 out of 5 Others have already beat a dead Sarah Jessica Parker to death (get it, a dead horse?) about the quantity of alcohol in the cocktails, and I agree - it's a lot.  When my no-personality waitress brought my Bloody Mary over, she said, without the tiniest of smiles, ""Good luck.""  Upon tasting my drink, I had two immediate thoughts:  a)I can hardly taste any mix or tomato juice, and b)the well/house vodka they use is of inferior quality.  Now - I'm not accusing Ceres of using Popov, but I'm almost certain that the type of vodka they use is worse than Seagrams.  Say what you will about Seagrams' American wheat lineage, but it makes a decent Bloody Mary, even if it comes with a screaming headache the next morning.   Suffice it to say that although you get a lot of alcohol at Ceres, it's not necessarily the best quality.  My drink was 4.96 (not including tax), so I guess you get what you pay for.  I could see, though - how drinking here would be very attractive to people looking to blow off steam.  Or for those trying to hide from their wives or husbands by sleeping on the couch after they soil themselves.    Overall: 3 out of 3 This is a very strong 3 star review.  If my waitress had been a little more friendly and I had not ordered a drink, it would easily be a 4 star review.  It's a neat place to have lunch; I wouldn't go there weekly or biweekly, but I'll definitely keep it on my list of restaurants to go to once a month or so.",0.9917,0.822,0.116,0.063,0.48608917748917757

The pot pie was just okay, the taste was pretty good but I think I actually got more chicken in the soup than the pot pie which made it a little disappointing. Our waitress though, was very friendly and quick to check on us. They serve soft drinks in cans and not from the fountain so refills are obviously not free.

I figured a diner would do a decent milk shake. Portions are large, service is friendly, and the food is average.

When you are in the Loop, drink where the traders drink.  A mixed drink consists of a large, full glass of alcohol, about three small cubes of ice, and a can of mixer.  Since there is no third container for you to mix the drink, this means the beginning of every drink is a whiskey sensation.  Ceres is my new favorite after work bar in the Loop. Actually, it may be my new favorite bar, anytime, anywhere.  Located in the Chicago Board of Trade Building: this may be what brought the economy back from the brink. Being here makes you want to run upstairs and invest in whiskey futures.

What we got was an outstanding experience, one of those places where all the little things are done right. We arrived to a very crowded, very loud, very full bar and as we were scanning the room a busboy?waiter? asked if we needed a table and proceeded to move around tables+chairs in the room, (politely) moving other customers' tables to make room for our group to fit. Our waitress seemed pretty new, but knew what she was doing. Had our drinks and nachos ordered right away, arriving surprisingly quickly for how busy it was.  The drinks: WOW. Gin and tonic, tonic on the side? Be prepared for a cocktail glass full to the brim with straight gin plus 2 lime wedges, and a can of tonic dropped down next to it. The only rough part was figuring out how to mix the two without first downing 2 shots of straight gin through my straws... And all at the same price ($7) you'd get for a watered down G&T at any other random Chicago bar! Food: generous basket of buttery/oily/delicious popcorn at every table. Nachos were excellent -- strong salsa, real cheese, even beans (chili?) on crisp and salty tortilla chips. Yum.  The little things: not so little: outstanding service going above and beyond. 3-4 napkins placed under your utensils (I always feel like I need more), great ambiance despite the high volume from the crowds, unpretentious, and a place to which I will definitely return.",0.9964,0.79,0.21,0.0,0.5469089566763987

Unfortunately, that was the highlight of Ceres Cafe for me.  The service may have been swift, but it wasn't especially friendly.  The woman who greeted me insisted on putting me in the far corner of the patio all by myself.  When I asked to be moved a little closer to the action, she basically refused.  I almost wanted to sniff my pits to see if I was offensively stinky or something.  When the server arrived, I again asked to be moved and she was more agreeable about it. Pricewise, this restaurant is $3-$4 more than it should be for lunch.  Granted, the portions are large, but it's just too much food and too much money at lunchtime.  They need to scale back both aspects.  My three steak tacos from the specials menu plus an iced tea came to $13. The tacos were fairly tasty.  Each was comprised of two corn tortillas and a large mound of carne asada.  Oddly, they melted cheese on top, but I love cheese, so no complaints about that.  Their pico de gallo tasted homemade, which was a nice touch.  Beans and rice came with the dish. When I walked through the inside of the cafe to use the facilities, it felt like an entirely different restaurant.  Inside feels cool and dark and like a dated ""businessman's lunch"" place, where they might drink martinis with their club sandwiches.

2008-06-16,4.0,"Growing up I had a great uncle whose Dr office was in Ceres, CA.  I was at that office numerous times and he employed young nephews and other relatives to work around the office - painting, mowing the lawns, etc.  When looking for a place to meet my cousin (one of the previously employed) and his wife for drinks in Chicago, I came across the Ceres Caf. It seemed a perfect fit. I arrived to find J&J sitting in the outdoor area enjoying what I learned was one of the first warm Friday nights in the Windy City this year, and the first weekend they were serving outside. A minute later the waitress brought us each a slice of pizza - complimentary. Later it was popcorn.  When my Manhattan arrived it was well made and, as other reviewers point out, quite strong (except it came over ice and I had to strain it myself).  The second one was perfect. One of the best I have ever had.  And the prices were very reasonable. The crowd was filled with traders and other professionals just off work having a drink before heading home, locals meeting up before heading out on the town, others flirting and exchanging digits.  I only went inside for a minute, but I would guess the group inside was as equally fun and entertaining.  The inside of Ceres is classic Chicago style. The only wrinkle in the evening was when J and I were smoking a cigar, the manager come over and told us we couldn't smoke in the patio area, but we could go over the fountain 20 feet away and smoke there (though we couldn't take our drinks). Mind you, we observed a number of others scattered around smoking large cigars and many cigarettes.  Since I had come straight from my flight, I had my suitcase, so we figured since we were obviously out-of-towners, we weren't given the same privilege as the regulars.

AMBIANCE - Dimly lit, very comfy chairs, like drinking in one of the dining clubs.  No B96-ers or WNUA-ers here.  Just a good old fashioned place that the REAL Sinatra and the Rat Pack would be happy to haunt. Outdoor seating available, but it's getting cold! DRINKS - A credit to it's legacy when three martini lunches were common, these bartenders, nay Servers of the Gods, will do you RIGHT.  Ladies, be careful what you order, because any well drink will put HAIR on your CHEST.  Man, these drinks were stiff and GREAT.  You don't get a JUICE Cosmopolitan here, you get a colored cup of frozen vodka.  Martinis?  Filled to the RIM, like they should be. SERVICE - The waitresses here are the SWEETEST and have the same tradition as the bar.  They take care of you, but you REALLY better take care of them.  The ones who have been around treat you like family and you feel it right away.  Drinks refill within a look and a  hand wave, popcorn just after the drinks, and they will suggest the right appetizers so you don't send it back.   You never miss a beat in your conversation or company.  Tip them well, come back, and you get your favorite table. FOOD - Typical bar food, but try the Whitefish sandwich on Wed and Fri.   Too much to eat for one and just tasty as heck!

2007-07-05,4.0,"Having been working in the financial / investment industry since 1995, I have spent a great many Friday evenings at this place.  Ceres is an old-school bar, the type where money types used to hang out and smoke cigars, while drinking their scotch on the rocks and discussing the thousands of dollars they made or lost that day.  This place is famous for their ""Jack and Cokes"". If you order one they will bring you a rock glass filled to the top with just Jack and a can of Coke (which you cant pour into the glass!) for about $5-6.  Unfortunately this place has tremendously gone downhill due to some external factors. Now you see all types of people in there, runners, clerks, office people from the buildings next door, etc... it is still a great place to have a drink but you wont get that old, classy feel anymore.  The food is pretty good and is priced accordingly. $10 dishes in the South Loop is the norm.  This place is open quite early for breakfast (get the nova lox bagel!) and closes at 8pm every night. Fridays are when it is worth going though, as thats when it gets packed with people from the surrounding buildings.  They accept credit cards, parking is non-existent, waitresses are friendly and helpful, Ive known most of them for years and it is not a bad place to make new friends. I do warn you though, the drinks are extremely strong. Be careful, especially if you are not a heavy drinker.  Enjoy!",0.9929,0.792,0.179,0.029,0.5665360501567398

The menu had a really good selection and wasn't as pricey as I expected.  These days, a sandwich in the Loop can run almost 10 bones so I did not mind paying the same for a good-sized salad.  I went with the Asian Chicken which was expertly chopped and very delicious.  My dining buddy had the chicken taco special which looked tasty and well worth $9.  The waitress was great so no complaints on the service at all.
