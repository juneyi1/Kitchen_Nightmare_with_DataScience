I love this place again because is hard to find a nice front lady plus the good food in this area.  The lady even told me they will soon put some thai food in the menu too, cant wait because i love pad thai !!

And she charged my card 50 cents more without noticed me. 50 cents is not a big deal but it is not acceptable without my permission. And than when my order was done.

2015-11-21,2.0,"Completely meh. I stuck with some standards, 'cos it was the first time I'd ordered from here. Pork Chop Suey and steamed pot stickers. The potstickers were like giant, swollen ticks. The dough was thick and sticky. The meat had an okay flavor, but they were bland overall. They might have been better fried, and I should have ordered them that way. The sauce was not what I was used to - the usual potsticker dip is a thin liquid with lots of vinegar - this was oily, with hot peppers. Not a bad flavor that, just not what I was expecting. The chop suey - pork happens to be a favorite of mine - was fair. The liquid overall was sort of slimy, viscous and vaguely sweet. The taste was pretty bland, I had to put too much soy sauce on it.  And it was surprisingly pricey for food so dull. Nope, won't get fooled again.",0.9377,0.766,0.162,0.072,0.582936507936508

Cheap food given in large quantities.  If getting your ""fill"" has more importance than flavors,  then please enjoy.   Over the many years they've occupied space here,  food has never gotten better.  Still looks about the same.   Whenever I see that sign I'll utter its name aloud & laugh.   See,  about a decade ago (and some change) before the condominium went up across the street,  a friend would drag me into this crappy takeout.  He did so because of an attractive counter person whose attention he'd hoped to attract. I ate (more than I wanted too) crappy food for almost two seasons. He was too chicken shit to close the deal you see.  But, she was nice enough to play along until he finally got the nerve.  I'd never been back until recently.  Curiosity of ""fast food"" Chinese take-out places often causes me an ill received decision.  (For clarity; an ill conceived consideration leading to an ill received conclusion.)",0.6354,0.709,0.162,0.129,0.5889761904761904

2014-10-17,1.0,Horrible customer service. The lady is extremely rude n they r very cheap.  I've been going to this place with my family for years.  I personally don't like the place very much but my family for some reason drags me there. I went to order some food and of course the lady took about 3 phone orders before she would take my other. We got a bunch of food. I asked if we can have some sweet and sour sauce. The lady said its 25 cents extra per pack! Why? Cuz they are cheap!  Then we get the food and she gives us no plates or forks. So I ask for plates and forks because we dined in. The lady said how many? With an attitude of course. I said 6. She freaked out and said 6???? Lol soooooo cheap!  The food is not even that great either.,-0.8801,0.825,0.049,0.126,0.5460714285714285
2014-05-21,3.0,"This is one of my favorite little hole in the wall Chinese restaurants. The prices and portions here are really good. I love the Mongolian beef at this place and their fried rice, it's been consistent for years now and I love consistent restaurants. The inside of this place is terrible, probably not somewhere you'll enjoy dining it at and the service is average at best. This is the spot for cheap take out Chinese that'll hit the spot, they have a huge menu so you'll have a lot of options which is cool you always change it up and try new things.  If this place was just take out and the service a little better I would give it 4 stars all day. So I guess it's fair to say my rating is 3 1/2 stars.",0.9732,0.771,0.192,0.038,0.5302272727272729

2009-12-23,2.0,"What you get in quantity, you lose in quality. I think the service, prices and the quantity of food you get for the prices are great. Four stars for that. But I feel the food is prepared with the lowest quality ingredients and flavorless sauces. I have ordered, numerous times, the Schezuan broccoli with white rice. The broccoli is always soggy, not al dente, and the broccoli is always drowned in an oily, flavorless and over spicy ""Schezuan"" sauce. The rice, on the other hand, was soft and cooked perfectly though, but then again let's hope they would perfect rice at least. It's a quick stop for patrons of the small strip mall and CTA workers, but for me, it's no longer a stop at all. Give it a shot, you may like it.

Ok, it should have been called grease fried shrimp pellet rice, and huge veggies in broth adorned with chicken.  Damn, these people are STINGY!!!
