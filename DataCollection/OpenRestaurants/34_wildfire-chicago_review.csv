2017-08-19,4.0,I have been coming to this restaurant for over 14 15 years now so I guess I kind of like the butt I seen that it's a popular Chicago downtown restaurant I believe in generally has something for everyone even your picky eaters the menu is extensive you're literally going to page and page of appetizers main dish and salad tubes wine list is impeccable the day weekend we were celebrating an anniversary my daughter went with the combo platter which included like a half a chicken and a half a slab of ribs I went for a seafood dish and my husband went for a steak dish no complaints everybody was excited and happy the bread was a big hit at the table where some bread people so we actually love Brad being able to see kind of through the kitchen and getting the food prepared the way it was nice and we told them it was our anniversary we got free dessert to share my drink Choice was actually a martini flight and it was for distinctive flights each one different and each one equally as delicious as the first I really recommend trying the flight so then you know how each Martini taste which one you like and which one you don't but I love them all this is a great restaurant to celebrate a special occasion birthday or anniversary all great date night cuz it's dark and dim and also very cozy also seems like a lot of people come here for post business conferences I'm very popular even on the week night will be back,0.9947,0.782,0.206,0.012,0.5985407066052227
2017-08-19,4.0,"This is another brilliant effort from Lettuce Entertain You. It's much more old school than their other restaurants, and really does capture the look and feel of a 1940s steakhouse. Not only does it offer some of the best steaks in town, it also offers some of the best steakhouse prices in River North. Both the food and the wine list is priced substantially below those of other restaurants, including some of Lettuce's other restaurants. Highlights of our meal included the house salad (the smallest size is huge), the very traditional French Onion Soup, and the very creative tuna tartare. The bacon wrapped scallop appetizer was also quite good. My horseradish crusted bacon-wrapped filet was just as good as it sounds. In fact, I think it was the best steak I've had in Chicago, and I've had a lot of them. Creamed spinach is a good side dish. The wine tasting flights offer four interesting selections for $15 or less. Where else can you get that in River North? Our server was friendly and attentive. And of course the Lettuce Entertain You Frequent Diner Club points make it an even better deal. Highly recommended.",0.9921,0.798,0.202,0.0,0.4964102564102564

2017-08-04,4.0,"4.5 stars. Came here for a work dinner with colleagues. I was pleasantly surprised. The have a fairly extensive menu, including a variety of beers, wines by the glass and bottle, and cocktails. Although they are a steakhouse, they also have a large variety of seafood, chicken, pizza, and even other vegetarian options (not just salad but also a veggie burger.) Food was very good, and prices are also pretty reasonable. Sizable and filling portions. Service was attentive and enjoyable.  We ordered the baked goat cheese appetizer and Caesar salad to start. Both are yummy and enough for 5 people to share. The bread basket is also very tasty and served warm. For my entree, I ordered the potato-crusted scallops with a side of potatoes au gratin ($28.95). WOW SO GOOD. My entree came with 8 good sized scallops with cooked spinach. I loved the crispy potato crust. The potatoes au gratin was a hefty portion and also so so yummy! Very cheesy and creamy just like I like them! I liked that all entrees automatically came with a personal side, and while I couldn't finish all my food, others I was with found it to be a very filling and satisfying portion. They ordered steaks and enjoyed them.   Waiters were constantly refilling waters and checking to make sure we were able to order any additional drinks we wanted. Overall vibe is more traditional with some families there. Not necessarily trendy but definitely a very satisfying experience overall!! Would recommend.",0.9983,0.695,0.305,0.0,0.6363789682539682

The service at the bar and later at the table...not so much. Actually, let's call those an epic fail. Issues on our visit were inattentive barstaff, inattentive server, slow service and a side with two meals served cool/cold. The latter was acknowledged and addressed, but even that took a while. I'd rate our food a solid 4.5-stars and the service a very generous 2-stars.   The restaurant was fairly empty when we were there and at this price point, good service is an expectation. The quality of the food supports the prices but it should go hand-in-hand with good service.  Unrelated to anything but important to some, the rest rooms are clean and spacious.

The scallops were fantastic in the sauce, but the filet left a lot to be desired.  For everything to go right on the medallions my filet was overcooked and dry (I ordered medium).  I had the scalloped potatoes with mine and we shared the sides.  The evening was topped off with a chocolate cake and vanilla bean ice cream.  It was an OK dinner to start off a great evening.  I expected more from a restaurant which has a 2-person bill of $120 before tip.  If you do go, I recommend reservations as this appeared to be a local favorite.  It was packed when we left at 1930.",0.9843,0.811,0.182,0.007,0.5018796992481203

I ordered the shrimp and crab soup. It was great but yet again the corn that was in it kind of ruined the flavor. The corn cut through the taste of the rest of the soup which wasn't great.

The kitchen is open so you can see the team working hard Negative: *Service: The restaurant was very busy and, although there seemed to be staff everywhere, we had to flag down our server a few times for things like the check. Dessert took about 20 minutes, by which point we no longer wanted it and were ready to go! *The details: This restaurant is quite pricey--my steak was somewhere in the $40-$50 range. For that price, I expect an ""over and above"" attention to detail. This restaurant does not offer that. The dishes and presentation are more casual ""supper club"" than refined steakhouse, my steak was overcooked, and the service was just ""getting it done.""

Yup, I got it bud, I know what kind of restaurant I made a reservation for! Let's see how great this ""steak house"" makes steaks.  First off, I thought the steak was really under seasoned and dry (I ordered my filet mignon medium). Although they give you a great portion, I think it's overpriced. The side of gratin potatoes was mushy, gray, and had no crust. The calamari was good. The drinks were okay. For the prices you pay, the service (and food) should be much better. If they desire to price the steaks the way they do, perhaps there should be linen on the table? Maybe not have the kitchen showing? Idk just my complaint. It's sort of odd that the kitchen is open and has bright white lighting (looks chaotic) and then the dining room attached to it has soft yellow lighting.

First, we made reservations and they still had us waiting 15 minutes after our reserved time with no where to sit, and a handicap individual with us. Next, our waiter was rude and disengaged to begin with. He was snappy and didn't answer any of our questions about the menu. He kept shutting the menu, when they were open and we were reading them, to point to the name and say ""steaks and chops are what we are known for, just get those and it'll be good"". He said he would be back with bread...but it never came. He brought it 25 minutes after we had been sitting and we didn't have silverware or plates. Then it was another 10 minutes waiting for those things. Then we ordered a small salad for the table to share, which was another 20 minute wait.  The table across from us with the same waiter called over the manager to complain multiple times about how horrible the service was, how their food took an hour to come out, and how their food was not correct and missing items. Food: Cesar salad was really good, except we got a bigger salad for the table but it still had a small chicken breast which wasn't nearly enough for the entire salad. Waited another 30 minutes for the main meal.. Ordered two filets, medium, and both came out well done!! The porterhouse was ordered well done, came out medium. The waiter took them back and we had to wait another 25 minutes for them to come back. When they came back the entire order was messed up. Took them back again, and another 10 minutes to come back, and again messed up.. the medium steaks were rare. Such a mess. By this point it was two hours since we sat down and we still didn't have our correct orders. Food got taken back AGAIN and finally came out correct another 15 minutes later. So to reiterate, they had to take the same food back 3 different times to try and cook a steak correctly. Finally, an hour after the food initially come out, it was all correct. It was all pretty tasty after the fact, but definitely not worth the hassle. The waiter brought the dessert tray but wouldn't give us even a minute to look and decide before quickly taking back the tray and saying to let him know whenever we decide. Desserts were average for taking another 20 minutes.  3+ hours of wasted time and pure hassle.

I don't really know how they size things here, but the small salad here is larger than most entrée salads at other locations. It also comes with a pretty large price tag at $16(for a chop salad).

The place is pretty big and nice, looks like a typical steak house in Chicago.  We started with the roasted beet & goat cheese salad, in my opinion, is was perfect. It had just the right amount of each ingredient, was big enough and tasted excellent!  We then moved to the main courses, I decided to try the Bison filet which, in that regards, I have to say, was one of the best decisions i have made lately LOL. The bison was so soft, tender and delicious! very lean with almost no fat. My wife had the filet Mignon which was cooked perfectly (she ask for medium) and tasted very good, we each had the mashed red potatoes as a side. Since it was also out anniversary, we got a free dessert ""on the house"" which was really nice of the place.  I will say that the service was really good, the waiters were really patient, welcoming and polite. the dishes came out pretty quick, and moreover the steaks were served warm.

I wish I wrote down the name of the wine, but we had the most delicious malbec that paired nicely with our meal. Appetizers: The bread was pretty good, nothing spectacular but it wasn't just plain ole roles or just a quarter baguette. One looked liked a dark rye with raisins and the other was a different kind of white bread (could've been a baguette). We ordered fried calamari for the table which was standard. Entree: There were three of us. The other two ordered a petite filet mignon and prime rib french dip. The filet was ordered medium rare but definitely came out medium - bummer, but still good overall. The prime rib french dip was delicious, definitely no doggy bag! I ordered the regular filet mignon, medium rare, and it was delicious! Nothing fancy, with a side of fries (which were standard). Service and Decor: To start with the decor, the restaurant was beautiful with dark wood everywhere. I really like that style, definitely raised the class. Our waiter provided very good service, no complaints! In fact, he saw that we were celebrating something, and even brought out a complementary piece of chocolate cake - very kind and observant!

2016-09-14,1.0,"I have been a Lettuce Entertain You member for 10+ years and have dined at the majority of their restaurants.  I generally like the various Wildfire locations for the service and decent food.  In fact, I threw a party for 100 guests at one of their suburban locations.  It was great. That's why this is so painful for me. Two of my three kids have milk and egg allergies, so generally I cannot order from the kids' menu.  In fact, I always bring egg and milk free food from home in case I find that no accommodations can be made.  But generally I can order something simple like plain chicken breast, prepared with a little salt, pepper and oil, which is what I did in this instance.  Like I have done pretty much a million times at other restaurants, including other Lettuce eateries.  In fact, I did this a few days prior at Beatrix. At Beatrix, I was charged $8/10 TOTAL for a beautifully cooked, organic chicken breast that my 2 dairy allergic kids split (as they are young and do not eat much).  The server was also really nice and threw in freebies like kids drinks for both kids even though he did not charge me for them.  I did not expect this and was surprised when I got the check.  I appreciated the small gesture and thought this is why we dine at Lettuce restaurants. Fast forward a few days later back to Wildfire.  I order 1 plain chicken breast for my 2 kids to share.  It comes out on 2 plates, butterflied and split, as we have experienced a million times at countless eateries.  To my surprise, when the bill comes out, we have been charged $22 for ""Lemon Chicken."" Really?  We have ordered this item countless times, sometimes at restaurants more upscale than Wildfire, and we have never been charged the price of a full entree.  Instead of being apologetic about charging us incorrectly for an entree that probably involved complicated sauces and side dishes, which is what I assume the Lemon Chicken is, our waiter seems taken aback at my inquiry.  He says he will discuss with the manager.  The manager comes over and says he has taken off my husband's $7 beer, to ""even things out.""   He then asks ""is that ok?"" in a mechanical voice.  No, that is not ok.  First, your server incorrectly charged me for a much more complex, full dish.  Second, he did not seem to care.  Third, even with your ""customer service,"" I am still paying $15 for 1 single plain chicken breast.  With taxes and tip, this is around $20.  I decide to just pay and leave bc at this point I realize no one here is getting it.  I could raise a fuss, but the point is I should not have to.   Very disappointing.  The staff here demonstrated a fundamental misunderstanding of not just customer service but also of common sense.",0.4192,0.875,0.067,0.059,0.5143367346938774

But that doesn't make you a good steak or chop house, that makes you average.  And, while I want to be fair to the place, the most memorable thing about my visit was how the casual contrasted with the finer dining experience that Wildfire was trying to provide.

2016-06-19,5.0,"OMG where do I begin?  Last Sunday I celebrated my daughter's 15th birthday.  She loves steak so I had to pick a steakhouse.  I am so glad that I picked Wildfire.  I made a reservation for 5 around 4:30.  It wasn't crowded when we arrived but as time went on the place started to fill up.  As usual I'll break my experience down into sections. Atmosphere- I have always had an old soul.  Walking into Wildfire was like joining the days of the Rat Pack.  The room in dim lit and filed with soft leather and wood.  The walls are lined with nostalgic photographs from the old era.  You feel opulent and comfortable at the same time because while the surroundings settle on wealthy, it doesn't feel snobbish. Service- I had no problems in this department.  While definitely a team environment, our server ROB was our dominant caretaker.  Our order was taken and delivered correctly and in order.  No one had to ask for refills, he was on top of everything.  He checked in on the table the right amount times, not too pesky not too scarce.  He was super friendly and polite as well as considerate.  Funny story, we had separate checks, my mom's card declined for what we later learned was a bank era.  She gave another card that went through.  Rob was very polite in the way he handled the situation, in order to provide the least amount of embarrassment.  Little did he know, my mother doesn't get embarrassed, LOL, but it was appreciated.  He gave my daughter a birthday dessert and even said thank you several times even after the check was settled.  Rob gets a 10 out of 10 for service. Food- So none of the rest of my review matters unless the food is good right?  Well it was the best steak I've had.  Now, we started with the crab cakes that were terrific, the Moroccan chicken skewers that were common but delicious, the spicy sauce was really great.  We also had the bacon wrapped scallops that were amazing, and finally the calamari that was good but nothing special or different than any other calamari I've ever had.  The Mango-tini I had was to die for.  If I weren't driving I would have had a few.  This place isn't cheap but they give you your money's worth.  The portions are huge.  My mother enjoyed her ribs, my aunt swears she had the best turkey burger she's ever had.  My daughter and I and her friend had steak,  My daughter loved her NY strip with the Parmesan crust.  I had the rib-eye with the blue cheese and Parmesan crust.  At medium rare this steak cut like butter, the temp was on point, the char was perfect and the seasoning was divine.  The butter swarming the plate added so much flavor and richness.   Everyone had to take food home because we were just too full to continue.  My daughter said the brownie and ice cream dessert was creamy and moist and she finished it all. All in all, I have nothing bad to say about Wildfire, I would definitely recommend it as I will certainly be back.",0.9988,0.696,0.237,0.067,0.5351226551226552

We tried to tell him but he didn't understand us and went to go get our waiter Jacob. Jacob took FOREVER to come around so now, you had a steak on the table bit waited an additional five minutes for the side of mashed potatoes. Another 5 thereafter for the salad.  Please guys. Serve the whole entree at once. Another steak was overcooked. When we told the person who brought the food, he went to go to get the waiter. Who took forever and when he got to the table,  gave us attitude. Jacob said ""I can only do what I can do, I don't work on the grill"" ...no kidding Jacob. We know that waiters don't cook. But you SHOULD be responsive to your table when the food comes out incorrectly. Another meal was just not to one of the diner's liking. She thought it was flavorless.

Wildfire is primarily a steakhouse, though it doesn't bill itself as such.  The decor is traditional steakhouse, with lots of wood and black-and-white photographs of scenes from the 1950s. The choice of appetizers were fairly uninspiring, but we landed on French onion soup (salty) and fried calamari (oily and overcooked).  Not a great start. The mains were better.  The beef dishes were universally tasty, but the temps on the meats were off.  I ordered prime rib medium and it came out medium-well.  Another ordered his prime rib medium-rare and it came out rare.  The filet that was ordered rare came out medium-rare (almost medium).  On and on it went.  For a steak(ish) house, not cooking to temp is a sin. The sides that came with the meats were subpar.  The double baked potato with cheddar cheese had ZERO flavor, except for a dash of paprika.  Actually, it tasted a bit like cardboard (no exaggeration) as confirmed by another guest.  It went virtually untouched.  The wild rice tasted like it came from a box (I'm quite certain it didn't) and had corn (atypical) and an odd sauce.  The au gratin potatoes needed seasoning and could have been crisper, but they were passable.  The creamed spinach was watery.  The mushrooms were good (but salty) and, while I didn't try them, the fries looked good from afar.  Not a great hit rate. One more thing, the wine list is pretty lousy, chock full of uninteresting mass-market selections.

2016-02-03,2.0,"I normally love Wildfire which is why I chose to have my birthday dinner there a couple weeks ago. The restaurant was busy when we arrived and we were given a table next to the kitchen. It was alright. Our server checked in with us and was attentive, but our orders took a fairly long time to arrive. When my meal arrived I found my steak had been over-cooked, I had requested medium and it was closer to well done. I requested for it to be remade, which they did. However it took longer than you would imagine (considering it only needed to be medium). By the time my new order was brought back out the rest of my party was done eating--it took that long to remake. So I had to eat my meal on my own while everyone else just sat around waiting for me to finish. I would have hoped that the staff could have expedited the order, or offered to remove the steak from the bill considering they had to remake it (and it was my BIRTHDAY). They had previously done something similar when I went there for a friend's birthday a couple months before. I didn't receive any compensation (not even a free drink as an apology), and didn't enjoy my meal since I felt rushed through it after waiting so long for it. I was very disappointed in the experience and I'm not sure I'll be returning.",0.6219,0.889,0.068,0.043,0.5403000594177065

We came here last Sunday for dinner with friends. There is valet service as well as street parking. We were seven and had a nice sized table in the middle of the dining room. We started out with drinks and ordered the wildfire chopped salad to start. The portion is large enough to share with 4 to 6 guests. It is always consistently good. They have a nice selection of wines and a decent drink menu. One can order flights of martinis or wines if there is some indecision. I had the Moscow mule. For dinner I ordered the bacon wrapped filet mignon, with horseradish crust topper, cooked rare. I got a giant baked potato as my side. My dinner was very good, but I think I would just get a filet cooked plain next time. The bacon and horseradish topper sort of detracted from the filet. See pictures. The prime rib is excellent; I usually get this cut of meat. They have a large selection of desserts. For dessert I had the caramel apple pie a la mode.

I actually hate lemon, and this tasted nothing like lemon, so if you are looking for something lemon-y, don't go for this. The chicken was incredibly moist with a bit of spice from the pepper. I really do recommend it. The mashed potatoes are also great. They're very rich. I passed on the roasted vegetables. I could tell just from looking at them that they were overcooked. Everything was brown and shriveled.  Finally, the triple chocolate cake for dessert was awesome. I could have eaten the whole platter, if I was by myself.

Unfortunately, it was pretty bland. Though the atmosphere was great: quiet enough to have a conversation, spacious, kinda cozy, and the service was ok, the food was disappointing. I was there for Restaurant Week. I had the wedge salad, NY steak with feta topping, creamed spinach, the key lime pie, and a martini flight. Food was part of Restaurant Week menu. Salad was fine, steak was tough and bland, creamed spinach was standard, martinis were overloaded with sugary mixes and so were not to my taste. I expected at least that the steak would prove delicious, but alas, it was pretty terrible. I am glad I did not make this purchase at normal prices though even during Restaurant Week I left thinking I could have spent the money (oh, I also had a beer-the best part of the meal) WAY better somewhere else.

2016-01-07,1.0,"Went for NYE dinner last night, figured it would be busy and service might be a slow but that would be anywhere. Made a reservation for 6:45 a month in advance but was still sat near the kitchen, seems to be an issue here after reading reviews, we should have spoke up since we made our reservation fairly early. Traffic past our table was non stop with dishwashers running glasses to the bar, waitstaff dropping and breaking dishes near-by. When we were 1st sat the restaurant was not completely full and a table in a quieter area would have been available. By the time my husband and I realized we were never going to be able to hear each other speaking clearly over all the kitchen chaos and had begun to get aggravated the place was starting to look a little busier and so then we felt stuck. If we were to ever go back, which I'm sure is a non-option anyway, sitting away from the kitchen would be something we would request when making the reservation. Our waitress seemed distracted and rushed. Yes, yes it was NYE and we were a measly table of 2, not her top priority for a tip of course, at least that is how we were treated. We are not big drinkers as we've gotten older and with this being our first stop for the night we didn't order any alcohol so I can't say anything about the bar. They did have martini flights going out to tables that I noticed looked really yummy. I ordered a side beet and goat cheese salad, potato crusted scallops with sweet potato and my husband ordered skirt steak with mashed potato. So we waited... And we waited... The water glass guys deserve a big pat on the back, the must be watching to refill every time you take a sip. My salad finally arrived only for the waitress to apologize for forgetting my salad. Well funny she says this because right behind her comes a good runner with our meals. So now I have a salad I haven't touched since she forgot and our food is ready. If I had to guess I would bet she saw our food was up and remembered the salad. So yep. Completely forgotten and now our dinner was being sent back to the kitchen to sit under a heat lamp. How great for our food. I told my husband to take his steak but he felt bad and said it was fine. About 5 minutes later as I was finishing my salad a different food runner came back with our food who didn't seem to care that I had 2 bites of my salad left. He must have really wanted our plates out of the kitchen. He asked who had the scallops, when I said I did and he went to take the plate and put it somewhere on our little table in front of my salad I had to stop him an ask why not give me a second and give my husband his plate 1st. As he was slamming our plates down I rushed to eat my 2 bites of salad and our waitress rushes up to apologize. The food runner or whatever he was gave our server the dirtiest look (I couldn't blame him at that point) he slammed my plate down as I was passing my salad plate so there would actually be room since he didn't seem to care if my plate would fit on the table or fall in my lap. After slamming the tray carrier closed he left without a word and our server just stood there. I said something to her about the guys attitude and she brushed it off. And so we ate. My food my warm, not hot. The scallops were not as crispy as a potato scallop should be but they had been sitting now in the buttery sauce with spinach for who knows exactly how long. I did eat it all since I was hungry but the integrity of the food was lost from sitting under a heat lamp.  My husband was never given a steak knife so he used the bread knife. His steak was cooked ok since he likes it well but he did say it was cooled off and that wasn't the best. He did not finish all I it because it had gotten too cold. Had the waitress remembered my salad or asked if I still even wanted it or just our food that was ready so it wouldn't get cold it would have been a better main course. I asked for a new bread knife since my husband never got a steak knife and she looked annoyed. Annoyed! That I wanted her to do her job. Our table was cleared and within seconds she had a tray of desserts over to show us. We almost ordered dessert. Almost. My husband, who hadn't eaten all of his cold food was still hungry. But after all the issues we just wanted to go. It took her 10 minutes to ask if we had made a decision about dessert. Then another 15 minutes to get us our check and finalize payment of the bill. We spent more time waiting around for her than it took us to eat our cold food. We live an hour from the city, we haven't gone out for New Years in about 4 years. We don't actually get a whole lot of date nights these days as it is. And all the other reasons adding to our disappointment. The point is even if we went out every night of the week a bad experience is a bad experience and in the service industry out experience was unacceptable. 1/8/16 Manager, Dale, called to apologize for our experience and to obtain more info to address staff.",0.0941,0.847,0.079,0.074,0.4385017760017759

It was okay, but tasted much better after I put salt and Cajun seasoning in it at home. However, there was a good amount of seafood in it, so I'll give them that. My BF got the crab cakes (we've had better) and the Mac and cheese, which he absolutely hated. It was an interesting Mac and cheese, large noodles in a ""pool"" of cheese. I wish they'd use lump crab meat for their crab items, it would be better than the scrap meat/filling combo that they pulled. Maybe I'm too harsh. I did eat a burger before I went.

I've generally stayed away from their appetizers from a lack of creativity and not being well prepared. This last time I decided to give them a try again and learned they've upped their game. Their calamari has definitely improved - it used to be one of the worst in town, now it's one of the best. It sounds odd, but ask for a side of the mustard they have for the pretzels... it is delicious with the calamari! The steaks here are quite good, just not amazing. You definitely get your money's worth, though - they are the size of your head. The Ribeye is the way to go here - for the price, it's one of the best in town. The Porterhouse inexpensive, but it is thinner than a normal one and they've overcooked it on me a couple of times. The Medallions Al Forno are a solid option as well, be warned: They come out looking small, but I've never been able to finish them. All dishes come with one side, and you have many delicious options to choose from. I would also put their cedar planked salmon up against just about anyone else's in Chicago - it is very, very good. Now the bad news: Avoid the martinis. I've tried and tried, but have been forced to give up having them here. I am a purist: London Dry Gin (specifically Bombay Sapphire), no vermouth, with a twist. That's all I get anywhere, so I know what to expect every time. I don't go for sweet martinis, which they are known for. I don't know if it's the cleaning products they use, or they're not thoroughly rinsing out the shakers, but every Sapphire martini I get here has an aftertaste of bubble gum, or rose or something unidentifiable. I have sent them back time and time again, only to get another ""interesting"" finish. I had to give up - good thing they have a pretty decent wine list!",0.9895,0.726,0.177,0.097,0.5603846153846154

The prime rib was amazing and delicious. I heard the salmon and chicken were on the same level. The portions were insanely large which only made things better. Key lime pie and triple chocolate cake for dessert was perfect. Drinks were cheap and nice.

If it wasn't for the fun people I were with, the atmosphere would have been nonexistent.  I ordered the three medallion filets. They were cooked to perfection. Had a very good side of creamy Spinach and the crab and shrimp bisque soup was mediocre. Everyone seemed to have enjoyed their food but I guess my big problem was the bill. Yeah , sure it is downtown and sure the service was good but I don't see the value in a restaurant like Wild Fire. There are so many restaurants in Chicago where you can get an outstanding meal for 25 bucks.  It's overpriced, has a bland atmosphere, and is filled with stuck up people.

2015-10-18,2.0,"I have to eat gluten-free or I get very sick.  I want to begin by saying that the gluten-free menu at Wildfire is good and has a lot of choices.  Also, the food is usually okay (see below for the exception to the rule) and I have never had an issue with cross-contamination, at least not yet. My first complaint: the service lacks.  On a recent visit, our server asked if anyone wanted an appetizer or salad.  Three of us did.  When the first person asked for soup--before anyone else had a chance to say what they wanted, she was almost off and running before we pulled her back to hear what everyone else wanted.  This happened TWO more times during the remainder of our meal.   Also, I told the server that, when we had dinner, I would like a glass of wine, yet when I ordered my first course and told her which wine I'd like to have with it, she neglected to bring it.  When I mentioned it to her, I said ""I'm still waiting on my wine,"" and she said she wasn't sure if I wanted it, because I said I wanted it ""with dinner.""  Well, yes, I did say that, and the way she said it made it very clear it was my fault she did not bring my wine. Okay, so maybe she thinks ""dinner"" means the main course.  It doesn't, but let's give her that one and say I was wrong.  That said, I had just told her I was now WAITING on my wine, and she neglected to bring it.  Eventually, about 20 minutes later, I had to pull another server aside and ask him to please ask our server to bring it. Our table asked for more bread. She brought only more non-gluten-free bread to the table, and she plopped it down in front of me with no concern for crumbs that might fly in my food or the fact that I would have to then pass it to the people who wanted it . . . and I am so highly sensitive to gluten (even a crumb can make me sick for a week), that I really shouldn't even be touching the board to pass it.  Very uncaring.  I will say that only one person asked her to bring more bread to our table, so perhaps she assumed only he and all the other guests at the table wanted more bread (she brought a ton of it), and perhaps she assumed that I didn't want any . . . but she might have asked.   There have been other times that the service has not been the best, especially during busy Saturday nights.  It is as though the servers have an attitude -- they just want you to order, eat, and get the hell out so they can sit the next party.  When we have good service, we tip very generously, and if we take a little longer to dine, we tip even more.  But when a server acts as though he/she is just there for the money and not for customer service, we still tip, but no more than 15% . . . and frankly, if the service is bad, even that's too much, but we don't go there.  I'm a nice person.  I wasn't rude to the server at all during dinner and gave her the benefit of the doubt throughout.  My daughter worked as a server in an up-scale restaurant, and I know how demanding and difficult being a server can be, so when I say we had less-than-the-best service, I really mean it.  It takes a lot to put me over the edge. Only on one occasion did we have excellent service, and that is when my husband and I dined in the bar area.  I am so sorry that I did not get the server's name -- the service was excellent.  That said, we did go at a slower time, so maybe that had something to do with it. So, maybe she was having an off night.  Goodness knows I've had them, and I forgive that, but sadly, the kitchen was having an off night, too . . . On the same visit, I ordered the gluten-free pepperoni pizza and a salad.  The pizza was horrible.  The crust was soggy and the pepperoni was extremely salty.  At a dive, a similar pizza might be somewhat acceptable, but NOT at a better restaurant where they should have an eye on quality and taste. The service was so poor, I didn't send the pizza back.  It assumed it would be a painful experience.   Even years back, I might have said the pizza was ""passable.""  But now, there are outstanding gluten-free pizzas available at other, similar restaurants, as well as outstanding gluten-free flatbreads.  Wildfire needs to serve a pizza that doesn't taste like cheap, frozen, soggy yuck.  AND, if they are using frozen pizza, there are ways to make a frozen pizza taste great.  Shouldn't a restaurant the caliber of Wildfire know how to do it?   If a restaurant goes to the time and trouble to serve gluten-free food, they should go to the time and trouble to make the dining experience as good as it is for those lucky folks who do not have celiac disease.  If you can't do it right, then don't do it at all.  There are plenty other restaurants out there who know how to do it right.  Gluten-intolerant customers don't have to choose you . . . but we'd like to, if you can get your act together.",0.9588,0.817,0.103,0.08,0.5605331035923143

I ordered the Bleu Cheese and Steak salad and there was 4 tiny little slices of steak that were so rare I had to send it back. They did recook them but they were so small not worth the 15.95 for the salad. A lot of lettuce but that's pretty much it. My friend had a Cesar salad and didn't care for it either. She ordered a small and they brought out the large. Then my friend is a worker at another restaurant that gives discounts at other lettuce entertain you restaurants. Wildfire is a lettuce entertain you restaurant so she asked for her discount. Our sever argued over the discount and was so rude about it. He ended up giving it to her but it was embarrassing.

Much better than the pork chop. Appetizer selection for the group, bison meatballs, scallop wrap, calamari were excellent. I should have stayed with that. Respectable wine selection. Did not care for the continuous attempt to up sell dang near everything. The wait staff was kind about this but it was incessant from start to finish.

2015-09-16,4.0,"I came here with a friend for dinner on a Monday night. I`m not sure what we were expecting, but an old-timey steakhouse was definitely not it. Also, the place was POPPING for early on a Monday evening (~6:15pm) probably due to their half off wine bottles deal. It also could have been due to their special Rosh Hashanah menu (Noodle Kugel, Matzo Ball Soup, Chicken, Brisket, and a few other classics). Although I didn't order from it, I appreciated that they had it. As neither of us had prepped for a steakhouse- we weren't prepared for that heavy of a meal and opted against the red meat choices. All of the steaks looked incredible though as I observed other tables, and the sides were great. We split the house salad which was good (had I been hungrier I would have opted for the chopped salad, it looked delicious) and ate the entire loaf of the everything bread that they give you when you sit down. It was DELICIOUS. For my main meal, I got the salmon with the redskin mashed potatoes-- both of which were great-- I love when the skin is kept in the potatoes. The salmon was a good sized portion, but I was glad I got a salad. My friend got the pizza. As a picky pizza eater, she was apprehensive about ordering it at a steak house but decided to when she saw it was wood-oven baked. She was very happy with her choice, and it was also nice that the pizza wasn't extremely large-- it was a bit larger than a ""personal sized"" pizza but smaller than a normal medium pizza.

I took my girlfriend to this location to use some LEYE gift cards. I thought she'd enjoy the supper-club atmosphere and quality of the food. And she did...just barely. Man, Wildfire, what happened? You're off your game. You used to have a great atmosphere, harkening back to the days of old. Now you're over-lit, too cold, and a few too many ads at each table. You're the TGIFridays parody of what A Wildfire should be. Don't get be wrong, you weren't BAD. The servers were attentive, but tried to push the booze and desserts a little too hard. The food was mostly good: Lobster and Crab Bisque was great; the chopped salad has really fallen off...it used to be a highlight and is now flavorless...seems like it came out of a plastic bag; her lamb chops were spot on; my prime rib was overcooked and yet was not served warm enough (to be fair, this could have been a by-product of the very chilly dining room). In the end, everything was average, and I have no need for an average steakhouse in Chicago. Dim the lights back down, get rid of the ads, retrain your servers to be about service instead of sales, and bring back the quality of your food. I'll be back in 3-4 months, and this review will either be raised to a 4-star or dropped to a 2-star as appropriate. YOUR MOVE, WILDFIRE.",0.9922,0.805,0.162,0.032,0.4792534722222222

Here it goes: - Baked goat cheese: warm and soft, in a tasty tomato sauce. - Bison meatballs: also in a sauce, quite nice. - Chopped salad: If I were eating here in a smaller group, I think this would make a good meal, actually (perhaps with dressing on the side). Full of goodies like chicken, tomato, avocado, and tortilla chips... and bleu cheese (not normally a fan of bleu cheese but it was fairly subtle). - Chicken breast: not sure which one we had, but it was good. Pounded fairly thin and  had good flavor to it.  - Cedar-planked salmon: great flavor to this. Another highlight. - I believe we also had a red-meat dish. It was good. - Veggies and sides (mashed potato) were very good.

2015-02-08,3.0,"We came here for a family birthday dinner.  Wildfire was picked because it had a good gluten free menu and could satisfy a picky eater's limited palate.  First, if I could rate the bar separately, they would get one star. We arrived early and we headed to the bar to wait for our dining companions. My husband asked the waiter for a negroni cocktail.  He looked at us quizzically and said they didn't have it. Eventually he said he would check with the bartender.  That should have been our first clue that they had no clue.  Our waiter comes back with drinks saying they could make it. The color was too brown missing the pinkish/organish color.  It was not a negroni - clearly missing the Campari/Aperol component. As my husband said, it was just bad. Our waiter never came back to check on our drinks and we vowed to stick with wine for the remainder of the night. After the bar experience, I wasn't expecting much. However, our waiter Paul saved the day (and this review for them). He was friendly, helpful, and attentive.  Wildfire had an extensive gluten free menu apart from the obvious steak choices which is a big plus.  They brought my sister gluten free bread taking care that it was on a separate board with separate butter so there would be no ""mixing.""  The food was overall pretty good although some things were better than others. We ordered the spinach dip appetizer with the gluten free flatbread.  It was good and the flatbread was surprisingly tasty and satisfied the ""gluten-lovers"" at the table.  The table got a mix of entrees with most people ordering steak.  Everyone was pleased with their steak at the temperature they requested. My sister really enjoyed the gluten free mac and cheese which was quite delicious. I ordered the seafood platter which was a combination of salmon, shrimp, scallops, and a crab cake. My favorite was the salmon and the crab cake.  Delicious.  The scallops missed the mark. They were three very small scallops that were wrapped in bacon.  The bacon, however, was not crispy but rather soggy, and the scallops were a bit chewy.  The complimentary flourless chocolate cake for the birthday was a nice touch.   Overall, aside from the bar issue, Wildfire had good service and solid food.  The main reason we would go back is the gluten free menu options.  However, we live in Chicago with steakhouses galore and if I am going to go to a steakhouse, Wildfire probably wouldn't be my first pick.",0.9918,0.831,0.139,0.03,0.5132486772486773

I also opted for a small $2 up charge to get the Mac & Cheese as a side, which was good but nothing to write home about. Finally, the dessert choice was the berry crisp with real honest to goodness vanilla bean ice cream. The dessert was fantastic, the perfect merriment of tart berries, balsamic, and sweet, creamy ice cream.

I had to ask for the wine and cocktail list again to cue him that we were thirsty.  We ordered two petite filets which took 45 minutes to arrive at our table.  My broccoli was ice cold and the filet was overdone... clearly it had been sitting.   Never once did my server ask me how things were and if I needed anything else.  As a former secret diner I know that he failed miserably by not asking this.  When the check came we were ready to split after 1 hour and 20 minutes of misery.  We had a gift card and LEYE gold card with $$ too.  He completely messed up the transaction and when we confronted him throw the envelope on the table and told us to talk to the manager and walked away.  The manager was apologetic after we addressed the issues and took care of the bill however.    Sub par service won't bring us back.

Started with the ""Old Kentucky Home"" bourbon cocktail, which was deeply tasty but too sweet (which I anticipated, since it involves orange marmalade, in addition to Makers 46, O3 orange liqueur, and sour mix).  Caesar salad was a little overdressed, though the dressing was very good (obviously house-made), and I liked the use of coarsely chopped rather than leaf romaine (plus they brought me plenty of anchovies).   I had the ""Ellington"" combination of a Parmesan-crusted ""petite"" NY strip and a skewer of five (smallish) garlic shrimp. The steak was a big disappointment.  I pushed off the Parmesan ""crust,"" which was not a crust but more of a wet, mushy blob and too strongly flavored. The steak itself was underdone (I had ordered charred medium, it came out medium rare) and wasn't tender or flavorful enough to be worthy of a supposed meat emporium like this.  That's the main reason for my stingy two-star rating.  (I'd do 2 1/2 if that were possible.) The mac and cheese side dish, though, was yummy.  My glass of wine -- St Francis ""Red Splash,"" a Merlot-based blend -- was jammy, full of bold cherry flavor, but a bit too soft and flabby to stand up to steak.  My dessert -- an ice cream sundae that involved chocolate-covered pretzels -- was very good.  Service and the pace of the meal were fine, though my waiter always seemed in a hurry and didn't establish any sort of bond.

Also, I overheard a conversation at the table next to us that led me to believe it was a pimp and one of his female employees! Come on! We were with friends from out of town and they chose WILDFIRE on Erie - but I would never chose that restaurant again.

This is the toughest review i've ever given because I love BBQ... baby-backs, St. Louis, brisket, pulled pork - dry rubbed or sauced - hot or cold, breakfast - lunch or dinner. So giving this a 1 Star rating is like publicly, criticizing a family member. The other evening I ordered dinner and was excited to try the baby-backs. The only discernible flavor was that of the BBQ sauce, which turned out to be merely, a cosmetic treatment covering up one end of the rack that was paper-thin-meat, dried to the level and texture of jerky. In that I had a whole rack, I'd hoped some of it to be salvageable... but not even close. You'd probably be right, if you guess that it was reheated in a micro-wave. The thicker portion of the rack resembled  rubber - not tough - just rubbery. It was like chewing dense gum... it didn't break down, it just changed shape.

Everything took forever from getting a server, to getting menus, ordering and receiving our drinks and food. It all took incredibly too long. We arrived at 9:45. We knew what we wanted and didn't ask any questions so it should have been seemingly easy for our server to take care of us. Tables around us were asking her questions and taking up her time.  That's when you would expect a manager to step in and notice she needed some help. Managers and bartenders standing around chatting while the server in the bar area was busy. There was a manager standing next to us while we were waiting for everything and he was watching a ball game on TV and chatting with other employees that didn't seem busy. There were probably 5-6 different opportunities for him to step in and be of assistance had he been paying any attention at all. Didn't happen. It was frustrating. The food was alright. Nothing to write home about. Far too many options in the neighborhood to have to put up with that. Been to Wildfire dozens of times in the suburbs and always received good service and had great food.

It tastes sooo good! Really moist and buttery with real pieces of corn throughout the bread. We were starving and went with two appetizers. The skewers and the meatballs. The skewers had great flavor throughout and I really enjoyed the mushrooms on the skewers the best. The meatballs were also delcious and well seasoned. For my entrée I had the blue cheese burger.

The service was excellent, and the food somehow managed to even top that. Despite the noise level, it still created for a rather intimate setting; I would describe Wildfire more as energetic than I would disruptive. I ordered the Filet Mignon Trio special (3 cuts, each breaded with a different breading) with mushroom, Parmesan, and double baked potato. My girlfriend got the Petite Filet Mignon, like she always does. This was my first time and I was amazed; it is not very often that I can say a place is both a restaurant as well as a culinary experience. They have a very nice selection of wine and the food is cooked very close to you so you can see, hear, and smell it before it gets to you. The dessert menu is presented visually in the form of a tray with each dessert on it. They all looked good, but we got the special flourless chocolate cake topped with vanilla ice cream that they serve for birthdays (just ask for it). The bread, the steak, and the cake are definitely the best I've ever had. To top it off, the waiter even came running out the street after us after we left a bag there.

2013-12-29,5.0,"On Christmas Eve I took my wife and 8-month-old daughter to Wildfire for a nice dinner.  I have often taken my wife there for dates in the past (their filet mignons are spectacular - and their turkey dinner?  Amazing - but anyway...).  The waiter was courteous and masterfully juggling several tables on such a busy night.  We never felt like we were waiting for him.   On this particular night, we felt like we just wanted lighter fare.  We ordered an appetizer, drinks (their winter nut brown ale is incredible), sandwiches, and some side items to feed the baby.  The waiter remembered our rather complicated order (I asked for a jalapeño bacon cheeseburger, cooked medium, with jalapeño jack cheese on whole wheat with a side of cottage fries) food was great up until I noticed two small issues with my food.  I saw a hair on my cottage fries and the burger was cooked rare - very rare.  I mentioned this to the waiter and he was offended.  He demanded that he get me an immediately new round of food.  I said the fries were not that bad - after all, if I can handle a baby, nothing grosses me out anymore - and that the burger was going to be an issue because we cannot stay out very long with the baby before she starts getting crabby.  Well we came to the agreement that they would set us up with a take-out container for my meal.  The manager, Petros Diakatos, arrived at this point and offered us free dessert to take home.  Well at this point I thought the issue was taken care of.  I asked the waiter to take my beer away, as I was hoping to drink it while eating the burger.  He apologized once more and upon his return, announced that the entire bill - totaling well over $100 - was going to be on the house for our trouble.   Let me recap this for you - I had a minor issue with my sandwich and fries, so they gave us two full desserts, an appetizer, two beers, a glass of wine, two sandwich orders, and four sides on the house.   I couldn't believe we would get such service at such a hectic time.   We left a generous tip (still much less than we had budgeted for the evening) and went home with a mountain of food, and plenty of Christmas cheer.   Once arriving home, I dug into the food.  It was delicious and plentiful.  We had much more food than we could eat, and the quality was divine.   My wife and I understand that mistakes happen - especially in unruly situations.  What really matters is what happens next, and Wildfire truly mastered the art of taking care of their guests.",0.9962,0.812,0.154,0.034,0.5615614478114478

Cons: Food took forever and we ordered burgers and there weren't many people there. My side dish - wild rice was raw. I sent it back and still got back crunchy rice. Maybe it's supposed to be that way but I did not care for that texture. The server brought me another side instead without hesitation.

2013-12-15,3.0,"Being in the line of work that I am in, expensive lunches and dinners sort of comes with the territory. Christmas parties are always the best because companies always expense the entire dinner--therefore we pretty much have free rein of the place. I've been to Wildfire before, but it was when i took a date to their Schaumburg location over five years ago. I knew that it can get expensive, depending on what you ordered. But one thing is for certain, I knew the food was excellent all around. Our group got seated in the main dining area. The place had a lot of Christmas decorations up, but I got a 1920's vibe to  it. Pretty cool. The dining area was spacious, with a long liquor bar out front and several doorways to party rooms out front.  To get the most bang for my buck, I ordered a filet mignon/scallops combo plate. Many in our group ordered single steaks or cuts of fish for their meals, and their portion sizes were the same size as my filet and plate of scallops. Woo, more food for me! I loved the taste of both dishes...the filet was nice and tender and the scallops had a nice buttery taste.  The service was excellent. On this night the servers were very busy. When they first brought out my plate I got meat and a plate of shrimp. ""This doesn't look like scallops,"" I told the waitress. She admitted that she screwed up the order and quickly apologized. The others in the group got their orders correct. After asking my permission, they started eating while I started on my mashed potatoes. The surprising part? The kitchen (again, this was a very busy night) got my correct order and brought it out; the others at our table were just three bites in to their dishes. What service! I like this place.

Apparently ordering some that is without gluten is very ODD haha. I also order the french onion soup, which confused him even  more because as I knew there was gluten in that soup. He treated me differently from then on out and I almost felt like he was watching me because I wouldn't ""admit"" to a gluten allergy. I just wanted to try the gluten free crust that's all!.

2013-11-30,4.0,"I'm used to suburban restaurants having sprawling interiors - not inner-city ones! Wildfire has a large, split-level dining room with tables and booths. It has luxurious dark tables, chairs, and carpeting. A faux, gray rock wall lines the semi-open kitchen along the far side. It feels like a lodge except that it's so freakin' huge. Wildfire had a lively din but I was able to easily hear my dining partner and server. There was also a mixed bag of folks that weeknight evening. There were all ages, all races, and visitors from other countries. Some people were dressed in their Sunday best, others in business clothes, and we wore jeans. M ordered a steak and I had the shrimp and crab chowder followed by the fried chicken special. I think she was satisfied with her meal. I don't remember her saying much about it. I thought my food was okay. I've definitely had far superior fried chicken at other restaurants. I think it was just a meal for us instead of dietary experience. Our drinks were really good. M got a bottle of wine (it was later re-corked, bagged, and sealed so that we could bring it home) and I had two martinis. Dark & Stormy martini tastes like a watermelon Jolly Rancher! It was super sweet (and I don't normally go for that, but this was yummy). I also got a bourbon drink with rumchatta that they fashioned into a martini for me. I loved the mature, sweet, and creamy combination! The service is really where it is for Wildfire. Our server was incredible. He explained that he's been a restaurant manager before and I think that his experience helps him to understand the intricacies of great service. He really took good to great. For example, he noticed that my fingers were getting sticky from my Dark & Stormy martini. He came over with a dish with two moist towels and a lemon wedge. I still don't know how he could possibly have known that my fingers were sticky! If it weren't for our server this review probably would only be three stars because the food was unimpressive - especially for the price.

Went alone on a Tuesday night after work, seated immediately - ""bit quiet"" according to one of the wait staff. Got served by a conscientious waiter who I couldn't really understand, so I just nodded mostly. He suggested the Ribeye and mash potato side. I chose the melted goat cheese as a starter. The breads were delicious and the wine excellent. The melted goat cheese thingy was okay I guess, a bit boring and equally filling - should have gone with the chopped salad. The 16oz Ribeye arrived in a timely fashion but even though I ordered medium-rare it was tough enough that I had to hack through it with the handy saw they provided - lotsa gristle and except for the char-burned outer, exceptionally tasteless. I guess they got Mrs O'Leary's old cow that set fire to Chicago all those years ago and kept it in the meat locker until tonite. The mash side was pureed to a liquid paste (yuk), but the roasted veges were yummy. After hacking my way through this cow, I was in no shape to do dessert, but they looked spectacular. $83 all up. Lawry's was a 5, I guess Wildfire is a 3 to 3.5.

My sister had the macadamia nut crusted halibut, I'll take her word for it being delicious since I'm allergic to macadamia nuts. My step dad had the mushroom stuffed salmon which he said was delicious! My husband had the chicken & ribs combo and was beyond happy with his choice. I went with the filet trio (how do you not?!) and I had them with crusted with parmesan, horseradish and the mushroom. The horseradish crust is byfar my favorite.  They sent out a special dessert for my sister and we ordered the skillet cookie as well. A delicious and very filling meal!",0.995,0.706,0.249,0.045,0.8478021978021979

I also love their fish, which I probably eat as much as I do the rib eye.  It is always a challenge to figure out what to eat when I go.  Five stars. I have been GF for over a year and I love, love WILDFIRE for their GF efforts.  They even have GF bread.  For those of us who are GF, we usually only have a few choices when we go out, but Wildfire goes above and beyond for the GF community.  The restaurant also host periodically GF dinners, similar to the other tasting dinners.  Five stars.

The last visit - to the Chicago Wildfire location: not quite the stellar experience we had hoped for. The biggest flaw? One of our guests had ordered a Ribeye cooked medium rare.  It arrived Medium Well and cold to the touch.  We requested that the order be prepared properly and it took more than 30 minutes for the re-fired meal.  Everyone else was done with their meals - we would have ordered dessert for the table, but since one guest was still eating the entree, we waited.  By the time his meal came and he had eaten, we decided we had just been sitting there too long.

Afterwards we were starving and got a recommendation from the hotel concierge to visit Wildfire. She explained that you get more for your money and their portion sizes are generous. We walked the 10 blocks or so to the W. Erie St location. We arrived around 6 on Saturday and there was no line. It's a very spacious place and comfortable seating. I asked the waitress if they had a gluten free menu (totally expecting to eat chicken and rice) and they did. I was pleasantly surprised! I was even more surprised when I saw the options for gluten free food. No salad and bun free burgers over here. It was like I had never left the world of wheat! There were burgers (WITH buns), pita chips, cake, cookies, pastas, etc. I was floored. lol For those of you who can eat wheat, you just have no idea. Meal and ratings below: Appetizer: Flat bread with spinach and artichoke fondue  (4/5) At first I was scared to eat the bread. lol It looked so real and wheat like that I was sure they made a mistake in the kitchen. I called the guy who dropped the food off and asked him again. He started laughing and said, ""Yes, enjoy your meal"". I took one bite and it was fantastic. It even had a crunch on the edges like pita bread. The spinach dip was a little thinner than I would've liked but it was good. Entree: Grilled Chicken Club burger (5/5)- Cooked perfectly and my bread wasn't too hard or soggy. Just what I had been missing. I wanted to order another one to-go but didn't want to appear too greedy. Side: Au Gratin potatoes (4/5) Would have like them cheesier but it was a really big portion Dessert: Flourless Chocolate Cake (5/5) - Awesomely rich! That is all... Even though I ate all that food, my total cost wasn't unreasonable. If there is anyone out in downtown Chicago who  is gluten free or are with a GF person, definitely recommend.

It was a horrible experience thanks to the following Waitress - Rude and not helpful. Never came around to ask if we were doing okay. Every time we had questions she would act like we were dumb for asking them. He spoke to us like we were teenagers.  We were all girls at the table though, maybe she felt intimidated? Food - Ordered the crab cakes for appetizer and they were decent. However, the main entree I ordered was not very pleasant. I had one of the combinations they have (NY steak and the shrimp). Meat was alright but the shrimp were so small and way overcooked. I remembered I had the surf and turf in the Schaumburg restaurant and it was AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!! Drinks - I had the fruit punch martini or something like that. It wasn't very good and it was so warm. It was difficult to finish. I also lost my debit card there and when I came back to the restaurant to get it and waitress didn't even offer to help me look for it. She said ""you are on your own if you want to ask the people that are seating at the table you were at"". The manager also didn't know what to do. He just gave me a bunch of cards to look through and that was about all the help he provided. I never heard from them since I had dinner there. I had to cancel my card.

The kind of place I would take my date, business associate, or parents. Sat down and ordered food. The menu is great. We got the filet, and it was huge. Very tasty, and cooked perfectly. The potatoes au-gratin were ok, but a bit overcooked IMO (they came out like a slice of lasange, which was unusual for us). Broccoli was good but had some lemony-butter thing going on, which was also kind of weird. Next time I definitely want to try the BBQ-rubbed potato. Our waitress was OK but you could tell she was stressed out or something. When you deal with a large table you have to expect some questions and a lot of requests (nothing out of the ordinary) and roll with the punches.

The ambiance was nice, but it did nothing to help the cramped seating we had in the main dining room, obnoxious patrons, poor service and expensive prices of mediocre food. When you pay close to $200 for a group of 3, having no alcohol or desert, you expect to come away having enjoyed yourself, no wishing you had saved the time and money to go to somewhere else, even a chain restaraunt.",0.7479,0.767,0.133,0.099,0.658129833129833

Juicy delicious chicken, tangy and sweet barbecue sauce and a side of macaroni and cheese that is al dente and perfectly salty was a treat. Not to mention it was my birthday and all I wanted was a good meal to celebrate the last year before my quarter-life crisis.  Well I got the delicious meal I wanted. I also tried the calamari, shrimp cocktail (you really can't mess this up),  and the chocolate mousse pie for dessert. All were excellent. However, I recommend the cookie skillet dessert, because it blew me away. I don't usually like pecans, but the cookie and ice cream were so good I didn't even care about the nuts. I also recommend the coconut pineapple martini. It's as close as you'll get to a pina colada at Wildfire, AND it's skinny! So drink up all that sugar guilt-free (sorta). ! Great for groups- they were very accommodating to our party of 8.  My only gripe is that the seats in the middle seating area are SOCLOSETOGETHER. The guy behind me whacked me with his zipper as he was putting his coat on, and a few of us got backed into by the people next to us pulling out their chairs to get to their table. I had to say ""sorry"" to about 5 bus boys because there simply was no room for them to walk between the tables so I'd have to squeeze myself in close to my table for them to get by.

For starters, they still bring bread to the table! In a very tasteful way of course, as it is single big roll for the table, but always warm and soft. And their chopped salad is by far the best salad Ive ever had. I find myself craving it all the time which is weird bc it is simply a salad!!

2012-12-24,4.0,"Overall, very good experience.  We ate here on a busy Saturday night before Christmas 2012.  Place was absolutely packed when we walked in at 8:00 and I thought, Uh Oh, but we were promptly seated for our 8:00 reservation.  So far, so good. The restaurant is big, and the atmosphere fun, loud and lively.   Service was friendly, professional and attentive (but not overly so). We started with a small Chopped Salad, which was more than enough for 2 people.  Very good starter. We then shared a NY steak.   Based on reviews we pondered various crusts and sauces.  We ended up passing on the crusts, but ordering two sauces.  We did not like the bernaise -- found it to be too sweet, and the consistency too close to mayonnaise (a line that is sometimes crossed because this is made with clarified butter and egg yolks).  We both liked the peppercorn sauce, although I found that it overpowered the flavor of the steak -- so really not necessary if you're a steak lover.  As for the steak, the flavor was not quite as good as what you'd get at a top steakhouse, but it was still very good especially for the price -- $31, which is about $15 less than you'd pay at a top steakhouse.   And, it was a perfectly cooked medium rare.   If you're looking for a good steak at a fair price, then this is a very good bet.  If you're looking for an outstanding steak -- and are willing to pay the price -- then you're better off at a top dedicated steakhouse. Really good kids menu.  Daughter had the petite filet and mashed potatoes, son had the chicken tenders and fries.  All very good. My only criticism is the wine list, which, despite being long enough, was pretty mundane/unimaginative and with a very, very high markup.  (We are wine geeks, so have a good feel for this.)  On average, I'd say markups at Wildfire are about 3X full retail price (some were creeping even closer to 4X.), which is at the high end of the range for restaurants and I believe is bucking the trend of most restaurants pricing wine more fairly.   We finally landed on a Pride Merlot, which at $67 was a relative bargain.  I would suggest that the ownership of this restaurant (and its sister restaurants) take another look at approach to this, as it definitely casts a shadow over the overall dining experience -- at least for their wine drinking clientele.  Overall we had a great experience, very good meal, and would definitely recommend this for groups and families.",0.9991,0.728,0.252,0.02,0.5934519774011301

We were fortunate enough with a group of 10 to have a private room, we didn't specifically ask for this but it was a pleasant surprise. Sometimes when with a large group of friends, the quality of the food may get missed. The food was great and everyone enjoyed their meal. The warm bread is always a great start whilst you wait for the food. We had the chopped salad in a huge bowl as it was something that everyone could share, meat was off to the side in a small bowl! Always love a good prime rib from Wildfire and this was no different. Service was excellent throughout the meal, despite being hidden away in a separate room, the servers were always close by. The only downside (partially bound to be due to us) was the fact that when it came time to leave, we had been there a while chatting and thus the restaurant was mostly empty. It wasn't past closing time but evil looks were sent in our direction and we had an honor guard procession when we did leave.

I went for my birthday last month, and we had the soft pretzel appetizer with two dipping sauces: cheddar and honey mustard. TO DIE FOR! Then I got the steak trio. A specialty of Wildfire is that they offer ""crusts"" to their steaks, flavors including double baked potato, cheddar, parmesan (the three I got), and more! We also got potatoes au gratin, again incredible. For dessert I was surprised with chocolate lava cake! Could my night have gotten any better? The drinks are appropriately strong, which is important when you're paying a pretty penny for them. The staff is knowledgeable on the menu-an obvious requirement for such a place, as well as friendly.  The atmosphere is a little loud so if you're looking for a quiet intimate dinner, maybe opt for a different place, but that aspect of the restaurant didn't bother me at all! It seemed a lot of people used it as an after work drink spot, and there were a lot of group parties as well as couples.

I was halfway done with my martini when I noticed one of those gnats taking a little swim in my drink.  I didn't see the point of ordering another drink since we couldn't get rid of them so I just had to leave my tasty drink untouched for the remainder of dinner.  This kind of thing would make me think twice about returning :(",0.9403,0.794,0.142,0.063,0.5546296296296297

So it may have been 6 years apart, but both of my experiences at Wildfire have proved to be a memorable and delicious meal, without having to involve bank robbery to pay for dinner.",0.9833,0.767,0.17,0.063,0.49639498432601886

Being a Texas native, I am really picky when it comes to my red meat! Wildfire did not disappoint. I made a reservation through the Yelp app which was really easy to do, and we arrived at 8:45pm. We were seated within 15 minutes, and the place was really full which was a good sign. First thing I noticed was that they had a very vast menu full of choices - I went with the horseradish crusted filet (medium rare) paired with a caesar salad and au gratin potatoes. Not sure if this is a Chicago thing, but I noticed that medium rare wasn't as juicy and bloody as I am normally used to, and it lacked seasoning. In Texas I am used to my steaks being a bit more saltier, and medium rare means I can run my meat across the plate and sop up the juice! It wasn't just the restaurant's style because we went to another steakhouse the next day (see other review for Harry Caray's) and it was the same deal. Regardless it was a really good meal at a fun restaurant with a great atmosphere. You can dress casually, and although a bit pricey it is worth it. Great drink selection as well - I went with a local blonde. Service was a tad bit slow, but it's pretty busy and they bring out bread and butter to hold you over just like most steakhouses.

2012-06-13,5.0,"For what it is- Wildfire has it right. This is one of our go-to places for a nicer meal if we're celebrating something; it's a bit cheaper than most of the steakhouses but still has delicious food and a much more extensive menu.  I don't even know where to start with the food. My favorite thing to get here is probably the crusted fillet medallions. It's not on the regular menu, but I've seen it on the specials menu every time I've gone, so I assume they always have it. You get 3 medallions, and you get to pick a different crust for each one (or the same one). Always cooked exactly how I like it, and I love crusts on my steak. The roumain skirt steak is also really good, and so are the tenderloin tips (our family had a long discussion and were split down the middle about which was better). The cedar planked salmon is also really good.  I don't usually talk about salads, because they're pretty hard to screw up, but I will here, because Wildfire makes GREAT salads. The chopped salad is my favorite: tons of ingredients and it is actually chopped, unlike at some places that call it a chopped salad and then give you a piece of lettuce the size of your head. For appetizers, the artichoke dip is pretty standard and the goat cheese is very good. The only thing I don't really like here is the pizza. They taste fine but they are kind of small and almost remind me of a microwave pizza, so I'd recommend skipping those. For vegetarians, the penne with wood roasted vegetables is actually surprisingly good. There are a lot of vegetables in it, and cheese, and it is not drenched in sauce. Peanut butter chocolate pie is phenomenal, though the peanut butter flavor is not that strong, and the ice cream sandwiches are also really cute and tasty for a hot summer day. Chocolate cake and cheesecake are also always reliable choices.

2012-06-10,5.0,"Mostly a review on the service: The food here is super good but you know what makes food taste even better...good service!  I find Wildfire to be as true as possible with regards to reservation times.  We have to keep in mind that when one makes reservations at 7pm, your table will not be waiting empty at 7pm.  I have never worked in the restaurant industry but I image the table timing is based on how long patrons stay and dine for, which can be unpredictable. Despite the unpredictability, Wildfire seems to get it within a 15 min window and keeps me coming back.   The servers here are polite, fast and courteous. I don't ever feel rushed and am given a five star dining experience each and every time I go.  The wait staff always gives great recommendations.  I am from out of town but every time I come in I try to plan at least one gathering around a meal at Wildfire...because it's just that good.  I have to say though that I almost docked a star because I came in town recently and tried to see a favorite manager, Hafiz (sp?), at Wildfire but I was told he is at a different location now  :(   Oh so sad because he was seriously the most fun manager I have ever encountered!  He has a way of interacting with people that makes you feel like a well welcomed guest and he remember special details that make the meal more enjoyable.  I think he is at a suburb location and I wish they would bring him back because it's too far to go!  Anyway, I still appreciate the restaurant and will keep coming back because the food and service are TOP RATED!",0.9945,0.774,0.193,0.033,0.588095238095238

For an appetizer we had the crab crusted shrimp - which are tasty little succelent morsels to start your meal off. Their bread is always fantastic here. My husband wanted to go on the healthy route and opted for the coffee rubbed bison filet, medium rare. It was perfectly cooked and the coffee really lended a great flavor to the meat. For a side he had the giant baked potato with all the fixins. I had the cedar planked salmon, which was just so moist on the inside with crispy bites on the outside from the carmelization of the soy glaze. I complemented that with the BBQ rubbed sweet potato... YUM! By far, one of our absolute favorite things on the menu here is the ice cream sandwich for dessert.

The Chicago location was packed on a Friday night.  They had five martinis for $5....all three of us opted for the Lite Long Islands-very good and they went well with the appetizers and dinners we ordered. Quick recap of the dinner....My prime rib was extra fatty...meh...I iike a little fat, but my friend ordered the same thing and mine looked very different in the fat department. The red mashed - awesome, broccoli -nasty the seasoned butter that accompanied it had separated and almost tasted watered down, au-graten potatoes  were just bad, the lamb was cooked correct but extremely salty. Calamari with sauces - very good.  Caesar salad was delicious. The other salad (garden) was gross and sent back. The key lime pie - i've had better, too much whipped cream, but the cream was a thick consistency. A complimentary flourless cake for the guest of honor was super and a nice surprise.  Dirty dishes left behind by previous diners....not cool and really gross since they were hidden under clean plates. Not a good way to start out the meal. Drinks (cocktails) remained empty for a long time before being asked if we would like more. I understand you were busy on a Friday, but this should be automatic especially when serves are just congregating in corners.  Only half-price appetizers if you sit at the bar. I am giving this place a 4 because setting up the reservation and questions asked via email were promptly addressed and answered.  I have been here before and it has been a fantastic experience.

I ordered the medallions with parmesan, mushroom, and double potato crusts, and my friend ordered the lamb chops. both of us wanted our meat medium. The medallion crusts were good. i particularly loved the mushroom crust. The lambchop was kind of all over the place. Some areas were very tough and hard to cut through. Having ordered a medium, i was expecting to cut through the meat with ease. Also, it took a very long time to chew both the medallions and the lamb chops. 2 of my medallions were medium-well, with slight pink and mostly cooked, and the mushroom medallion was the only one that was at a medium with a hint of red (no wonder it tasted so good). Plus, to ruin the mood, idk if the waitress was glaring at me, or a table in back, but man..... way to make the atmosphere uncomfortable.  Not the most enjoyable moment when you see someone death-glaring at you.

Great advertising technique of behalf of the restaurant because we might have never known about the place without it. The feeling when you walk in really is like a 1940s steakhouse. Great ambience!  The waiter was friendly and gave great service. The appetizer was good and so was the french onion soup, although a fairly small portion for a cup of soup. We split the turkey burger and that was very good. All the different types of steak on the menu sounded delicious! However, I was eating with someone who doesn't eat steak and knew I would be unable to finish one on my own but next time I am making it my mission to try one. The server assistants who fill your water glass make sure the glass is never not filled to the rim with water, which is nice but sometimes a little annoying when someone reaches in front of you every five minutes to make sure you drink all of Lake Michigan during your visit.

This is a great way to try some of the different offerings. I had the pizza, friends had crab cakes, shrimp, and some other goodies and talked about how great it was. Someone else ordered the steak and it was massive and he said pretty good. I think my favorite is the House Salad. It is gigantic and can probably serve 2 - 3 people but it is amazingly delicious and fresh.  The drinks are pretty solid as well and they have something for everyone. A wine flight, mixed drinks, martinis, the works. Service is pretty good too.

I have yet to find out when french onion soup has changed to a sugary very sweet recipe. Yes another F for this dish. Funny all of us went for the sirloin steak I had mine medium rare and out of all 4 steaks mine was the best but the outside was dark char grilled almost as if they forgot it on too high flame. I worked around the burnt pieces and finished about two thirds of my steak. very tasty and juicy. Not sure what the deal is with the sour dough bread in wine sauce below the steak. I'll ask the chef next time I visit. Also we brought wine from our last trip to South Africa and only paid $10 corkage which was a steal. similar bottle sold in the restaurant would have sold for over $150 per bottle.

My only complaint with it was that it was soaked in their vinaigrette.  Some of the greens were getting a tad soggy and losing their crispness.  Though overall, was pleased with the dish. --The gf ordered the lemon pepper chicken, she loved it. I tasted it, it tasted great, nice citrus kick. Our sides were the macaroni and cheese (excellent) and bbq baked sweet potato (huge!).  --I ordered the filet medallion trio (I chose blue cheese, baked potato, and mushroom as crusts).  I ordered them medium, though that's not exactly what I got. I cut into the first one and it was between medium-well and well-done.  I cut into the second one and it was between rare and medium rare. I cut into the third one and it was definitely rare. I showed the 2 that were underdone to the waiter and he didn't seem to acknowledge that they were undercooked (to my preference), just simply asked if I want to have them re-fired. I said ""yes,"" knowing in my head that they probably would come back out well done. I got the filets back and sure enough they were well done.

My wife didn't really care for her cedar plank salmon; ""too sweet."" Cottage fries and fresh-cut fries were very good, if not terribly creative, sides. Calamari was tender. We always cringe in anticipation of rubbery squid. Not a problem at Wildfire. Wine was adequate. I didn't get a wine snob vibe from the waiter which was fine. It's just not that kind of place.

It was a pretty large salad and could easily be a big meal for someone. Multiple people got steaks which they really enjoyed, and a few of our friends got scallops. The scallops were overcooked and had sand in them, according to my friend. She's not one to complain, so they must have been bad if she mentioned them. I got a veggie burger along with another friend and it was pretty tasty, especially for being at a steakhouse. It was a pretty big portion and so I had to take half home for leftovers.

Recently my wife and I had the opportunity to get out on a date by ourselves and we decided to hit Wildfire.  We got here at about 5pm and were informed of specials in the bar area...half price apps and 5 dollar drinks until 6:30pm...to the bar we go!!! Typically I like sitting at the bar but we happened to meet the waiter who was servicing the high tables in the bar.  After two minutes of banter, we decided to sit at the table.  I am just going to get this out of the way...the 5 star review is for our waiter Mike G...talk about personality and customer service all rolled up into one.  Restaurants would kill to have such a talented person serving their customers!!! We decided to go tropical and had a few of the Pina-Colada-Tini's...they were kind of a Rum version of a Cosmo.  They were really good but I had to warn my other half that the pineapple hides the alcohol and to take it slow. We also loaded up on the apps.  I asked our waiter to space them out.  The conversation was quite funny because I have asked waiters to do this before and everything hits the table at the same time.  Mike G told me that he would never let this happen...he also told me that it is not hard to do and all of your apps should never hit the table at the same time if you asked for them to be spaced out.  Mike G speaks the truth!!! We started out with the shrimp stuffed with crab...it was recommended as one of the top apps here.  I will say that it was okay...my other half was a little grossed out because the poor shrimp seemed to be drowning in butter.  As far as I can tell, butter makes everything better.  When our waiter checked in on us...we informed him we were not impressed with the shrimp!  He actually went to the chef and asked if we could have an order that was not drowning.  The chef completely shut down our cool waiter.  Lucky I don't have your name Mr Chef and I am not ruining this review by taking away a star...Mike G was too good to ruin this night. We then moved on to the pizza with spicy chicken sausage.  I have to tell you that I was impressed.  I would have never thought that this place could pull off a yummy pizza.  I also saw that there were more varieties to choose from too. Our last app was the Braised Short Rib Ravioli.  I must say that the dish looked terrible.  In fact, I felt kind of sad we ordered it.  We split them up and when we tasted them we each looked at each other and realized it may have looked ugly but it sure tasted delicious.  The broth was amazing too...I wish we would have had some bread to dip in the juice.  (We did have bread earlier but I did not need more bread...I will just remember that next time) Mike G felt really bad about the shrimp and was still trying to make things right.  He honestly went above and beyond to make us happy.  He wanted us to walk away from Wildfire as happy customers.  He looked at us and said, ""Do you like crab?"" And we said, ""Yes!""  He then ran off and said, ""I'll be back!""   As the time passed we enjoyed a few more Pina-Colada-tinis...so smooth!!!  Then two of the most beautiful crab cakes hit the table.  They were so delicious...best crab cakes I have had in a long long time.  This kind of service to make a customer happy was worth our trip to Wildfire and will make us come back again.   Mike G is one of the most amazing waiters ever.  My 5 star review is for him...he saved our visit here and we will come back because of him.  His detail to our table and to the other tables in the bar was amazing.  We had a great time joking with him and talking food.  He also made sure that we were taken care of too.  So many waiters will ignore there tables until the check comes and then they try and turn on the charm.  Mike G was a delight and I highly recommend you request him to be your server because you will not be disappointed!!!",0.9986,0.774,0.17,0.055,0.5686588306208559

I would suggest making reservations.  We waited for over an hour the first time I went (no reservations) and were seated within 10 minutes of arriving with the reservations.  We had crab cakes and shrimp stuffed mushrooms for appetizers.  The crab was ok...not steller the mushrooms were ok as well.  I had the beef short ribs and my date had the medialions with the different crusts...he seemed to enjoy it but I must admit that my short ribs were a bit fatty.  All in all a good experience.  Maybe not a romantic venue...but it would be a great place to go with friends who would like to share good drinks and eat hearty peices of meat. lol,0.9964,0.73,0.259,0.011,0.5176666666666666

I tromped down the block wondering how awful it was going to be. I opened the first door and *ish* I opened the second door and was instantly bathed in the honey glow lights of an old style steak house - so elegant , so refined, so old school I swear I sighed with pleasure just standing in the bar. The happy hour was so pleasant that I brought friends back a few days later and we indulged in a full on heavy calorie laden food fest. We had the calamari and drinks ( I had the Martini flight which is a darling idea, but they don't stay cold enough to really enjoy all FOUR mini delights. I had the smallest fillet crusted with horseradish and OMG - I don't eat steak often, but this was spectacular.

Eating out all the time can be really expensive but we wanted at least one great sit down meal.  I highly recommend Wildfire. It is a moderately priced alternative to Gibson's or Morton's that will not disappoint.   I'll start with the food. Our party split two appetizers.  A small thin sausage pizza and a goat cheese dip of some sort.  The goat cheese was so-so. The pizza was very good.  Next was a greek salad. Very tasty with a nice mix of feta cheese and garbanzo beans. Highly recommend the filet trio for your main dish.  You can try their different crusts that come with their steaks.  I went with the horseradish, mushroom, and parmesan cheese. Terrific dish.  We split a piece of key lime pie for desert.   The service. Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the food and Chicago.  Visiting here at the beginning of our vacation was very helpful. He made recommendations for pizza as well as directions for places we were visiting.  I appreciated that he took his time to answer any questions we had.  The prices. You can eat a very good meal with salad, appetizer, potato and steak and even desert for just under $100 for two. This is w/o drinks.

Can't say this is the best crab cake I've ever had and the crab definitely isn't fresh. Flavors are great, but I probably wouldn't get them again. - Chicken and portabello skewers ($9): Sounds exactly like what it is. Breast meat and pieces of mushrooms on a skewer, roasted till drippy. Good to share, otherwise you get tired of the shroominess real fast. Salad: House chopped salad ($13 for a small): This salad was HUUUUGE.

The restaurant is a touch loud and yes, as others have mentioned, it does have a spooky corporate glow... but I have been able to eat a very nice, seemingly fresh meal catered to my specifications every single time we have come here. Even when I was on a diet where I could only eat fish and veggies, I happily ate their cedar-planked salmon and veggies all the way to yumtown.  They have a very nice gluten-free menu, especially for meat eaters, but those of you who get by with the occasional fish dish will be exceptionally pleased with their offerings. The fish is dee-lish! The chicken chopped salad always makes the whole table happy and the staff always prepares it for us with everything on the side (for one kosher, one lactose-free and one gluten-free diner).

Several dips were ordered within the group and from the sounds of it-the dip was dish delish.

I realize there is an unwritten rule in the Yelp Law Book that it is not cool to do a review on: 1. a chain restaurant such as a Lettuce Entertain You establishment; 2. a restaurant that already has so many reviews. But frankly, my dear, I don't follow the rules. I love Wildfire - I have always loved Wildfire - I simply have never had a bad meal. I have never had bad service here, either. Ever. Still dreaming of Wildfire's Homemade Chocolate Cream Pie... From the appetizers to the salads to the entrees to the desserts. Every single item I have eaten has been delicious and has kept me coming back for more. Continuing to dream of  Wildfire's Homemade Chocolate Cream Pie... See, I don't always need ethnic foods or bizarre and outlandish foods like bull testicles and fried brain and pig anus and chicken feet. Nah, sometimes I just want: - a good salad. And their House Specialty is fabulous w/ roasted chicken, avocado, tomato, blue cheese, bacon, scallions, tortilla strips, corn, tossed with citrus lime vinaigrette - fabulously crispy fried calamari - extra crispy for moi - oh baby! Best I have ever had. The sauces are perfect.  - shrimp and crab bisque  - mouthwatering steaks! To die for. Every bit as high quality as some of the big name steak places in Chicago. - a reasonably priced nightly special such as spit roasted half Long Island Duck or a eight hour barbeque platter featuring baby back ribs, pulled pork, sliced brisket, cornbread muffin and baked beans. And one more thing - I would walk on hot coals for their Homemade Chocolate Cream pie. It's seasonal so get your piehole in there before it's gone. You can buy a whole one, too.

2011-03-22,3.0,"Whatever the female version of getting a ""culinary boner"" is, that is what describes what eating fried chicken does to me. Their Monday night fried chicken special prompted Jennifer I. to meet me for a decadent, artery-clogging dinner last night. We both settled on the fried chicken special, which, priced at $17.95, ain't cheap, especially considering their sister restaurant, Joe's, is only $14.95, and it's among the best. We were dismayed that the fried chicken ended up being boneless cutlets of chicken instead of on-the-bone pieces. My primary motivation for feasting on fried chicken is the crispy skin, and this had none. It was more like eating chicken from a tv dinner (and not in a good way). The breading on the chicken didn't really stay on when you cut into it and the chicken was also a little dry. Fried chicken on the bone generally stays moister. I was pretty disappointed and I also felt deceived; the menu should state that this is not traditional fried chicken. I'll still keep it at three stars because everything else is usually pretty good. Steaks and chicken are all fine, if not extraordinary. Standout sides include creamed spinach, au gratin potatoes, and brown-sugar rubbed sweet potatoes. Their salads are always fresh and plentiful. My favorite dessert at WF is their key lime pie, which is a small round pie, with crushed gingersnap cookies, tangy lime filling, and a small mountain of fluffy whipped cream sprinkled with fresh lime zest. It's tart, creamy, and wonderful. I've eaten at each and every location of Wildfire. You've eaten at one, you've eaten at 'em all. The service is always pleasant and efficient, and the food is consistent.

My husband ordered the mushroom crusted pork chops.  He let me have a taste and immediately I wished I'd ordered that instead.  I was under the impression this was a steakhouse or was I let astray?   Our bill wasn't as high as we expected which eased the pain a bit.  Maybe because we left off the salad.   I can't say the food or service was bad, and I certainly wouldn't say to stay away.  I just don't think we'll be back since there are so many other options in the city.",0.9755,0.816,0.138,0.046,0.4851020408163265

As you walk in, everything inside is rich, dark colors.  Great seating, we were seated at a large corner booth, very plush leather booth, perfect for business conversations. They have a great menu - steaks, chops and seafood.  My colleagues had some type of a crabcake dish, but I can't remember I wasn't listening I was still taking in the interior of the restaurant.  Really nice.....I had the salmon w/glazed potatoes. They brought cornbread as the ""bread"", it had actual corn in it.  Delicious. They had a great selection of martinis, but since it's business meeting, i skipped and had cranberry/ginger ale mix.  My salmon was delicious, cooked perfectly and the potatoes were amazing.  I think the crabcakes had blue cheese in it and my colleagues couldn't stop talking about it.  1 of them also had the soup of the day and I believe he inhaled it.  Some kind of a cheese/broccoli soup...maybe, like I said I was paying attention to the bar area and the interior of the room.  It's like they really studied space planning.

Excellent.  Probably the best steak I've ever had and it was only $32 and probably 20 ounces.  It was cooked to perfection and I had enough for breakfast the next month.  Yummy.

It reminded me a lot of Corner Bakery's chopped salad. I ordered three steak medallions with crusts on each. There were six crust choices and I ended up with sauerkraut, mushroom, and bearnaise. All of them were great led by the sauerkraut. I actually found myself knocking the crust off the steak to eat the meat and crust separately.

I rarely give out 5 stars, but this place deserves it. It has a classy atmosphere, similar to what you see in a 50's mobster movie. Our server was very knowledgeable of the menu and gave great recommendations. I've tried other steakhouses in Chicago, thinking it was because of the corn-fed beef that the area uses, but Wildfire does a very good job of cooking their meats. I highly recommend the prime rib. It is a very generous portion and the meat is very juicy & tender. I also tried their Mac 'n' Cheese, Spinach, and Mash Potatoes as sides and they were all very tasty. I finished the meal with the Key Lime pie, which is by far the best I've ever had. The meal didn't break my budget either. At most upscale steakhouses, the bill would have been 30%-40% more.  Great food, good atmosphere, fair prices.  A little about my credentials: I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky, engineering image.

We all chose to order from the fixed price menu.  The husband and I had the halibut, our friend had the prime rib.  I had a salad and strawberry rhubarb pie for dessert. We had a wonderful time.

2010-03-29,1.0,"I think it is funny for people to give 4-5 star rating for a place that labels itself a Steak, Chop, and Seafood place, and all they rave about is the salad???  We had a gift card to burn, and friends in town tonight - so I let myself get talked into Wildfire for the first time in two years...  This place makes me think of a well decorated Sizzler or some other crap hole fake steakhouse where they sell you on a steak loaded with junk or ""crusted"" as they call it, to cover the poor quality of the meat.   The sides are sized ok, but the quality is not what you'd expect from a $30 dinner plate.  And for $2 more, you can get a runny pile of noodles they list as ""Traditional Mac and Cheese"" which maybe means in the sense that it will remind of when you were 8 years old eating Kraft Mac and Cheese from a bowl.  And concerning the seafood part, I could not have had more a more foul tasting portion of seafood if I had picked it out of a dumpster @ Lake and Halsted.  If you insist on punishing yourself with an overpriced crappy meal here, do yourself a favor and avoid ALL shellfish - trust me on this... food poisoning sucks As it has been said by so many other reviewers, go to a real steakhouse downtown and enjoy the difference.  Yeah it may cost more, but its because you are not eating at a place that serves school lunchroom quality meals ~",-0.8014,0.807,0.087,0.106,0.5296296296296297

This place screams steakhouse with the decor drenched in dark wood and the upbeat atmosphere. Towards the back was the open kitchen which slightly threw off the dark decor but leaked out the enticing aroma of charred meat. We were a party of 14 yet the service was just attentive and on point. I know at times, when accommodating a large party, some dishes tend to come out faster than others thus creating an awkward moment between the haves and have nots until all dishes arrived. However all of our entrees came out at the same time piping hot, ready to be eaten. We started off some some of the pizzas which were great to nibble on yet didn't fill you up as you prepared to gorge on the main attraction - the steaks!  I chose and devoured the 10"" prime rib cooked perfectly medium rare, charred on the outside, buttery and beefy on the inside with bare bones seasoning. The rest of my group either ordered steak or the fish special and were pleased and stuffed.  We couldn't leave without sampling a couple of desserts - It's a totally different stomach! A few plates of berry crisps and apple skillet pie were passed around. Simple yet solid dessert, a perfect ending to a great meal and worth the additional calories.

And here, all seemed to relax and my fears of being in a fancy franchise changed.  Orders of drinks, ribs and sides were placed and although some predictability remained, those ribs were really good.  The sides were fresh and the sauce was plentiful.  The St. Louis ribs had an enjoyable blend of herbs that made it stand out more than the normal BBQ, and to try both, get the Ribs & Ribs for a half slab of both.  One side per dinner,  along with cole slaw and apple sauce, all you need.  Dessert was ice cream covering a plate of a cookie. Yes, the food was good, but as some have said, it's filling but with predictable flavors.  The smells are good, they pull you in and the food is ready to go.  At this point, it's all subjective in opinion... To me, a fancy franchise like these are smoke and mirrors.  You get what you hope for, but surrounded in a decor of kitch-filled deco.  It's nice, it's fun, but you've seen it before in this large space filled with eaters.  The waiters and bus boys run around getting people in, getting them out, so they can get off as well.  Although satisfied with the food overall experience, I know better can be found for the same price elsewhere...a thought that couldn't slip from me.   Good food, but my goal now is to find richer flavors from ribs in a one of a kind place.",0.995,0.815,0.166,0.019,0.5456746031746031

This delicious teaser includes the Cosmo, Apple Martini, Raspberry  Martini and my favorite, the Stormy NIght. Next up was the small chopped salad which is big enough to share and good enough to devour in 2 minutes flat.

(slice)  If you are familiar with the Lettuce Entertain You restaurant group, you've probably heard of Wildfire. If not, Wildfire is one of the many great restaurants of the group.  I've been here about 3 or 4 times and have yet to be displeased with the food.   My most recent visit was last night (a Friday) at 9 pm. And, seriously, folks were packed like sardines up in dis biyatch.  Reservation is a must.  I started with the shrimp and crab bisque, which I give a 8/10. The consistency could have been a bit thicker, but the soup quickly disappeared, regardless.  The main event of the evening was the surf and turf...and I fa sho caught a killer wave and hung 10, dudes. Totally narly lobster tail and flavorful steak (as I chomp on another bite of my leftovers). My side was mashed potatoes, which was a great compliment.  The waiter was an older, shorter gentleman (roughly 50) with white hair (including a nasty shag in the back).  I was a bit surprised a place like Wildfire would have a waiter of his skill on staff. No disrespect to him, but he just seemed more of a Applebees waiter than Wildfire.  On his follow-up visits to the table, he did this drive-by with the line ""you guys have everything you need, right?"" Uhh...thats extremely assumptive, and if you werent at the next table by the time I could answer, maybe you would know the answer to your question. (And if he called me ""buddy"" one more time, I was going to get my WWE on and drop an elbow on his face. LOL). He meant well and all, but really could use some polishing.

2009-12-30,4.0,"What a great way to celebrate the end of the year, and decade for that matter, with a reliably satisfying meal at Wildfire. I was a little surprised to see a packed house on a tuesday night during the holidays, but then again, people always know where to find good food. Even though there was a very tempting three course meal option for $30 (great value), we opted to navigate the menu on our own. We started with baked goat cheese in tomato sauce (how very tapas of us) that was served with an interesting pita-like bread. No complaints, a great way to start the meal. For round two we decided to mix in some healthy greens in the form of a caesar salad for two. Very large serving, which we almost finished because I am always on the lookout for high end caesar salads. The dressing wasn't too heavy and the cheese didn't overpower. A nice dose of fresh pepper and I was very content. Now for the main course, I may have made a fatal flaw. Since the previous night I was at Hub 51 (notice any pattern with LEYE??) and ordered filet tacos, I had a taste for something that swims even though I know for certain that steaks at Wildfire are first rate. With that being said I ordered the special of the day, Crab Cake Crusted Trout served with wild rice and a mustard sauce. I should have ordered a steak (as my smarter girlfriend did). It wasn't a bad piece of fish and there were no major disasters, I just didn't want to eat the second half of the dish and could not find any real flavor to enjoy. The mustard sauce was too creamy for me to use which is unfortunate because I love mustard. The crab cake crust was interesting, something I don't think I have ever tasted before. There were bits of corn and red pepper in the mix, which worked well with the side of wild rice that also included corn and peas. The major problem though is that the fish did not have any flavor, period. Some of my first bites actually tasted a little fishy, and then as I kept going, lost everything all together. My eating partner agreed that it didn't taste like anyone. Odd, and better than tasting bad, but disappointing. The petite filet on the other side of the table looked and tasted wonderful. None was left to take home. Her side of mashed potatoes were also delicious, creamy and buttery just the way they should be. (I also used them to sample the BBQ sauce since we didn't order anything BBQ. One of my favorite sauces I have tasted yet...for future reference). With little room left our server tortured us with his dessert tray presentation. Even though I may have fumbled my entre this one time, I thoroughly enjoy Wildfire and can see why it is one of the most popular Chicago establishments. Great food with spot on service all combine for an enjoyable dining experience and all for a price that is more than justified (steaks for under $30).

Having said that, I truly enjoyed my meal here.  I was with a group of about 10, for a graduation dinner, and we were treated with a respect usually reserved for smaller, higher-margin groups.  We were a bit over dressed, having come from a formal graduation, but we did not feel uncomfortable, as there was a wide array of clothing from casual to formal all around us.  We ordered a variety of food, some of which was a big hit and a few minor misses.  My filet mignon (pepper crusted if memory serves me) was delicious, cooked to my preference, and came with a delicious side of mashed potatoes.  It was so wonderful I ended up finishing a partner's identical filet as well! The miss of the meal was probably the beef wellington, which had a poor crust and rather bland tasting meat.  Overall, the ambiance of the restaurant was quite enjoyable, quiet but not hushed, but colloquial as well.  If someone were to suggest a return to Wildfire, I'd have no qualms, but by my own volition, I'd like to try other steakhouses over this.  Of course, if I was stuck in Oak Brook, this would be my first choice for steak!",0.993,0.745,0.205,0.05,0.5345238095238095

My friend ordered the prime rib rare but the server said the rarest they can cook it is medium - rare. It came out as medium. I am not much of a dessert person but do not leave until you have eaten the snickers ice cream sandwich and peanut butter cup cake. Atmosphere: the place is modern, dark and sophisticated with a pleasant smokiness scent in the air from the food. HOWEVER, we were seated in room that has little atmosphere. It resembled a banquet room you'd see at a Holiday Inn - bright lights, green rug and generic furniture. Service: Our waitress was sweet and knowledgeable. I have to say the food runner and buss staff were not so refined. Runners didn't know which food belonged to whom. Bussers didn't clear items that obviously needed to be and did not sweep up the crumbs between courses; didn't fold the napkins when my friend was in the loo (the napkin was just pushed aside).

2009-08-22,5.0,"Well, what can I say that has not already been said. I've been a ""loyal"" patron of Wildfire for over 10 years. Hands down the ABSOLUTE BEST steakhouse in the state. The downtown Chicago location has the best ambiance and servers by far, but the suburban locations are fabulous as well.  The Wildfire has me so spoiled, I never eat steak anywhere else because I always end up disappointed. Even if I go to a ""steakhouse"", I order ribs or prime rib because I know the steak will not be up to par. The Stuffed Shrimp appetizer holds a special place in my heart, not much can top it. Entree - Medium Rib-Eye w/parmesan crust and a side of broccoli. All the sides are to die for, so take your pick. Regardless of your cut, be sure to ask for ""Parmesan Crust"". I guarantee you will thank me.  My bartender at Wildfire downtown is Luis (Hispanic pronunciation Lu-iz not Louis). If you pay $12 for a drink, you should get a $12 drink. With Luis, you pay $12 and get a $20 drink! He is TOP NOTCH, so you'll only need 2 drinks.

I mention Cheesecake Factory because it's just as crowded and touristy. I liked my food just fine. I got a sirloin, which was very thin but had a great peppercorn sauce. They advertised cottage fries that came with the steak but they were really overcooked, overcrispy potatoes, which is fine because I didn't overeat.

The food is pretty good, but nothing too special or ""wow"".  Standard, crowd-pleasing fare.  The chopped salad is one of my favorite ways to start the night, and their chocolate cake is the perfect ending.

I'm a sucker for goat cheese, and the somewhat-but-not-too-sweet marinara sauce it's surrounded by is the perfect partner. Mmmmmm. I've never really had an issue with my entree, probably because I stick with my two main staples: Prime rib and the garlic chicken. The prime rib is solid, juicy, well-cooked, and flavorful. The garlic chicken, though, is even better. It tastes like the caramelized onions and garlic that it was cooked in. Oh man. So good. The garlic mashed potatoes aren't anything to sneeze at, either. The thing that I'm convinced keeps bringing me back is the key lime pie. Even if I am completely, explodably full, I still order it to split with a bunch of people.

The outside looked awesome and the atmosphere inside was so cool. I was so excited for the meal. I asked when we walked inside if it was possible to be seated early. He said if we were ok with a 2 seat booth than we could be seated immediately, but for a normal size table it would no be until 7. We decided to go with the small table, but before we even got our water they came over an offered to move us to a full size booth, which we did do. The waiter was extremely nice and the bread which he brought over with him was delicious. I ordered the New York Strip with fries and my girlfriend ordered the Filet with the wild rice. For a New York Strip steak the piece was not very fatty. There was only a couple of bites by the end that were, so this was a huge plus. The steak however, ordered medium, was extremely dry. Thankfully the plate was covered in juice so I soaked each piece before eating. The girlfriend's piece was also a bit overcooked, but she was not as lucky as to have the extra juices on the plate. The reason both were overcooked and kind of dry was because they clearly were sitting under the heat lamp for A LONG TIME. The plates were so scalding hot that you could not even touch them. The top of the girlfriends rice was very dried out, another sign of being under the heat lamp for a while. Although we did not try a dessert it did look really good.

My rice pilaf was hard as a rock on top, it was dry and tasteless, despite the many flavors piled in. I couldn't even eat it beyond a few tastes because it was so dried out. The boyfriend suggested this was likely the result of it sitting under a hot lamp, and he was probably right. My steak was a little overcooked, and the amount of juicyness that I expected was lacking. It wasn't dried out, but it wasn't as juicy as it could have (and SHOULD have) been.

Having only been there once, I can only comment on the ribs and the chicken caesar salad.  We started out at the bar where he ordered a blue moon and I asked for something ""sweet with a cherry."" Unfortunately for me, I forgot to mention how much I dislike martini's and the bartender made me a berry concoction (I think it was a berry berry martini-it's not on their menu though) with raspberry vodka. It was so loaded with the vodka that it tasted to me like the cherry NyQuil I have been taking the past few nights, so I didn't finish it.  I had the salad and it was okay, but to be honest I've had better from cheaper places. The dressing was a little odd, not really caesar, and the chicken (though I ordered the regular and not char) was too much on the char side for me. It looked okay, but most of what I tasted was burnt chicken, and I am not a fan. It was harder to chew and dry.  My boyfriend only had one bite and told me it tasted fishy (I don't eat fish like he does, so I can't really say), which was kind of odd. He ordered the ribs and they were okay, made better by extra barbecue sauce he had to request. Fries were decent, not too salty, and not too overcooked.  For dessert we ordered a smaller version of the ice cream sundae, but it had melted most of the way by the time they brought it to us, which isn't bad, but it takes away some of the fun of ice cream sundaes.  Overall, the experience was decent and I'd go back to try something else. Our dinner companions enjoyed their steaks, so that's probably what we'll have next time we go there. Also, it was kind of fun sitting next to the sign that said Savoy Room"" as that's my mom's maiden name and I always find that amusing.

We usually avoid waiting for a table and just saddle up to a high table in the bar-where service is attentive and quick (and on Sundays-prime for football viewing.) *One side note, my bf ordered the honey glazed ribs recently and thought they were quite fatty.*",0.93,0.851,0.131,0.018,0.6212500000000001
2008-12-15,3.0,"I just tried Wildfire out for the first time a couple of weeks ago. It was a sunday evening and we were freezing from having spent an hour outside in the cold walking around at the zoo. We warmed up with a nice bottle of malbec and I had the peppercorn crusted filet (Medium). The filet was cooked to perfection and the redskin mashed potatoes were delicious. I was completely full from having eaten a smore and drank a large cocoa at the zoo in addition to my meal but I managed to split dessert with my girlfriend which were miniature keylime pie slices. Yes, I was glutunous and I paid for it later. Food wise, it was a great place to eat.  As for atmosphere, it lacks any identity. There are large black & white photos of old movie stars and musicians which give it a somewhat generic feel. The open kitchen in the back is a nice touch but with the River North location it tends to bring a very touristy crowd. The price is not exactly cheap so I expected the clientale to dress a little better. I'm not saying everyone needs to be decked out but I think people walking around in sweatpants and football jerseys steals a little class from the place. I can't fault Wildfire for having patrons who dress badly but I can at least be the voice of the fashion police and try to persuade a few people to have some class and dress it up a little. Jeans and a nice shirt will do. If you want to wear pajamas order delivery at home or go to McDonalds.",0.9773,0.836,0.129,0.035,0.4746825396825397

We were plenty full with this and didn't have any room for dessert even if I wanted to.  :(.   Pros:   Pretty inexpensive wine list (even if it isn't the most sophisticated list) Great crusts on the steak Cons: Service was just ok.  I think b/c we only ordered one entree she stopped being attentive as she started.  She didn't explain anything.  I understand how annoying it may be that we share an entree, but we always do an appetizer and drinks which equates to two entrees (and then some if I end up drinking alot :) ).",0.9956,0.722,0.233,0.046,0.7351190476190474

2008-11-10,3.0,"I have but one requirement of any steakhouse, and that is to simply cook my steak as I've asked.  My request is unwavering and really easy: medium-rare. It should be red and warm in the center, throughout the piece of meat. I can cook my steak this way without fail. Actually, Outback can cook my steak like this without fail, and a handful of other steakhouses I've been to can do this without fail. Wildfire did not do this.  I went to dinner at Wildfire a few weeks ago and ordered the filet with mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes were tasty, if a little room-temp and slightly pasty. It's okay, I actually kind of like the spackle thing, it helps me sop up juice on my plate. The piece of filet that was served to me was downright burned on the outside. It was, at best, medium for a few slices directly at the center of the piece of meat. Everything else needed red wine and mashed potatoes to swallow down. I would have mentioned something to our waiter, but he only swung by a moment after the food was delivered and then once again much later to ask if we would like dessert.  Other things:   - a friend of mine was without silverware and we had to flag down a busser to get a fork off the dessert tray  - we were sat directly outside the kitchen area and by the dessert tray, so every few minutes I had to duck when the tray was lifted mere inches from my head  - it was kinda loud in there, but I liked the atmosphere overall  - the manager came over to say hello when he'd learned our party hadn't been to Wildfire before  - the wine list was extensive and affordable, for the most part  - the key lime pie was exceptionally good So overall, I'd say, eh. I would go back again if invited, but the impression left was just sorta ok. Didn't knock my socks off, but it seems like a reasonably good restaurant.",0.9968,0.819,0.181,0.0,0.3443476577622919

Now, I love steak and I especially love a good steak house, which I don't classify Wildfire as, but they do serve up a good side of beef, and it's not as expensive as a real steak establishment, yet just as tasty.  We were dining with friends and had a reservation for 7:30 last night and it was PACKED in there. So crowded it was hard to move anywhere once we stepped inside. Despite arriving on time, right on time as a matter of fact, we still has to wait about 20 mins. for our table, so we grabbed a drink in the bar area. It was a little hard to navigate in the bar area because several people, I guess, decided to forgo their table and eat in the bar, so in addition to the large crowd you had waiters navigating thru the human maze carrying huge trays of hot food. We were glad when our buzzer buzzed to be seated.  The dining room was equally as crowded and equally as loud. Despite sitting in a u-shaped booth we had to shout to hear each other. Our waiter was very nice, attentive, helpful and pleasant. My husband and I split the crab cakes for an appetizer, and to be honest they weren't really that great. Some of the best crab cakes I've ever had came from Houston's..ahhh, how I miss Houston's. Anyway, I prefer them to have little to no breading, just crab. I had the rib-eye: cooked perfectly, very tasty, very tender. The horseradish crust, however, was just, eh. It was mostly oily and not all that tasty. The white cheddar potatoes Au gratin...to die for, trust me. Cheesy, creamy, a nice brown crust on top, yum! My husband had the fillet trio (tasty), and our dining companions had the mahi mahi and NY strip- all very good.  We were way too stuffed to indulge in any of the gargantuan deserts presented to us, and it was getting too loud and too hot, so we took our leave of Wildfire. From our seat we had a direct view of the kitchen and the open flame used for cooking, and I don't know how those poor chefs survive back there. I couldn't imagine eating there in the summer.

The filet mignon was probably the best of the lot and they were all very well cooked, but I still think the one I had at Chop House was the best so far. The desserts are all homemade and they bring you a tray to pick from. We opted for the peach and blueberry pie with peach ice cream - that was delicious and the ice cream was especially good (not sure if that part was homemade but if it wasn't I'd like to know where they get it!).

The place is set up great for a party like ours- along with plenty of big tables for big groups and a section at the bar for small parties (like 2).  Everything on the menu looked tasty, and I loved the extensive drink portion. I started with the sangriatini, which was good but I would have been just as happy with sangria. It didn't seem strong enough to be either sangria or a martini...I shared the chopped salad for a starter, which was very good. We ordered the dressing on the side but it arrived drenched- which was ok because it wasn't a cream dressing, but I was still a little shocked considering Lettuce Entertain You restaurants pride themselves on high service standards. Our waitress was nice, and everyone makes mistakes. She realized after we'd been in our salad and offered an apology.  For dinner I had the scallops- they were small scallops and there were so many. I couldn't eat all of them. The lemon butter sauce was very good, but a little salty. I didn't feel like I could take my leftovers home- how would re-heated scallops taste? I shudder at the thought. Other orders we had were chicken breasts in some sort of lemon sauce, surf and turf, and a steak salad. They all looked good and were huge. So note to self, next time return ready to share entree or get an entree you can take with you in a doggy bag. I also had a wine flight which is definitely the way to go.

I had a few bites of the steak trio forced upon me as well (""You cannot just eat goat cheese and salad.""  Why not?); the bernaise, baked potato and parmesan crusted options.  These were way too rich for me.  All I could taste was salt and butter, and hardly the steak at all.  Of the three, the baked potato one was the only one I took a second bite of.

This is a good place to go with any size group, they have separate rooms for large parties and do a very nice family style menu, you can also get it if your party is 6 or more and you can all agree on the same items from the menu, you select 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, 2 salads and 2 desserts and share. I almost always get the same thing, the horseradish crusted filet mignon ($29.95) is always good and so is the french onion soup.

The atmosphere was cheesy to the max.  The wine list was as corporate as any Applebees... Geyser Peak this, Geyser Peak that...   They even had a room that Geyser Peak paid to put their name on.  The crowd was very mixed... some people dressed up for a nice meal out, others looked like they were ready to go work out at the gym.  (Maybe this doesn't happen at the suburban location)..   There was a pole with plaques on it, did those people pay to have their name plastered there forever?

I opted for the Bearnaise, horseradish, and blue cheese.  All in all it was very gimmicky, I didn't find that the toppings added much value to the meal.  They were kind of... just blah toppings.  And they were more ""hot"" than ""crispy"" ...The blue cheese topping was not memorable.  The horseradish was kinda mush and not very spicy from horseradish, kind of bland.  The Bearnaise was very herbal, I probably could've done without it...  In the end, a traditional normal steak of some sort would have been a better choice.   The dessert menu was so predictable that we named 5 out of 6 things on it before they even brought it to our table.  The snickers/peanut butter ice cream sundae was tasty.   2.5 stars maybe...  I think we spent $250ish for 4.  For this price point, you can do a LOT better in Chicago.",0.9891,0.886,0.1,0.014,0.5342638888888888

The only thing I would complain about was our bus boy...he kept cleaning our stuff away before we were even done.  He even sprayed some cleaning chemicals on the table while we were still eating...pretty strange...hopefully it was just this guy.",0.9876,0.715,0.244,0.041,0.7800751879699248

But, I digress.  I met 3 other Yelpers for an quiet evening of  carnivore-ic delights and conversation.  Raise a glass!  Garson! MEAT, all around!  RAWR! I was taken by the decor.  The restaurant is large, and open; not at all 'dark'.   Lovely vintage black and white images lined the walls.  On particular favourite of mine was a side shot of a gentleman holding / looking at a Martini glass.  Another, a very Lauren Hutton-type image, partially in  shadow, holding a cigarette.  (non pc in this day and age, but STILL a great photo!).  We were shown to our tables, and began to peruse the menu.  So much to choose from!  Famished, I decided upon the Bleu Cheese encrusted Filet - Medium Rare & Mashed Potatoes on the side; and started off with the Lobster and Shrimp bisque.  For a filet, my steak was, to my mind, enormous.  I should note that Medium Rare, at Wildfire, is a bit more rare than I'm used to. I decided it was a regional difference, having come from the West Coast, after all.  Needless to say, the steak was delicious. For dessert, I chose something light.  They had a lovely berry crisp that consisted of blue berries, strawberries and black berries. Great evening, over all!  I would recommend Wildfire for any reason you may have for dining out;  Even for no reason at all - except to enjoy some incredibly good food, fantastic service and great ambiance.",0.9953,0.803,0.188,0.01,0.5876116071428572

Here's what I liked about my experience at Wildfire: 1)  Strong, delicious drinks.  I had a few of the pomegranate martinis.  I don't know if it was the painful day I'd had at work, or if the martinis were that good, but it was all I could do to behave like an adult and refrain from polishing off an entire drink in one swallow; 2)  Attentive staff.  My water glass was never even half empty before it was refilled by our waiter;    3) Relaxed atmosphere.  It was very welcoming and comfortable. 4)  The mashed potatoes - they were mashed with skins and not too buttery; and last, but certainly not least 5)  The filet.  I ordered the filet trio (to be prepared ""rare"") and chose for my three crusted toppings mushroom, Bearnaise, and horseradish.  I'm telling you, rare is the way to go.  I have no idea why anyone would bother to have meat prepared any other way.  It was so good that I actually wanted to close my eyes for a second in an attempt to shut out other sensory input and fully enjoy / savor each bite.     The friends I was with ordered dessert to share - the chocolate lava cake and the chocolate chip cookie skillet (which is served with ice cream).  I had a few bites of each, and they were good, but I'm not a dessert person, and so I really couldn't say how their desserts compare to desserts at other restaurants.   I will certainly go back to Wildfire, though when I do, I will be faced with a tough decision - should I try any of the other delicious-sounding items on the menu, or stick with the mouth-watering filet trio?!",0.9946,0.78,0.192,0.028,0.5216666666666666

We had dinner with friends last night at Wildfire, and I was completely disappointed. Here's what happened. - My girlfriend and her boyfriend got there before us and were waiting in the front area.  She's a tiny little thing, and the front of the house sign FELL on her.  Nobody from the restaurant came to help her and my friends had to go up to the hostess and tell her what had happened.  The hostess' response? ""Just don't stand near it.""  No apology either.  - We had to wait about 15 minutes before the server even took our drink order. - Cocktails are pretty watered down.  I had a gin and tonic, and all I tasted was tonic.  BF had the midnight storm signature coctail (this name could be wrong), but it was pure sugar.  This drink is so sweet, it will give you a sugar high. - We ordered three appetizers and one of them was wrong.   - The calamari was dry and bland.  Without the sauce, it tasted like deep fried rubberbands.  - I ordered the cedar plank salmon.  It was D-R-Y and unflavorful. The side of broccoli was drenched in butter. Like swimming in it.  - BF ordered the Lamb with cheddar au gratin potatoes and creamed spinach.  I tried some of it and made a face. I think they put a cup of salt in the entire dish.  In the meat, potatoes and spinach... all I tasted was salt.  Are they trying to kill their patrons? Or maybe just drink more?? - The apple tart dessert was just OK. The serving is large, but the apples were a little undercooked and crust was a little overcooked. But it came with a big scoop of ice cream, so it was ok.  - There was a fruit fly around our table that wouldn't leave us alone for the whole dinner.  + On a positive note, they didn't charge us for the wrong appetizer and sent the right one over.  + The baked goat cheese is pretty tasty. + The ribs are pretty tasty. As is the prime rib - but get it medium rare.  + Ambiance is warm.  There were holiday lights and wreaths everywhere.  The fireplace is a nice touch too.  Feels like you're going into a steakhouse in a ski resort. But it's very noisy. + $300 for six people, for drinks, appetizers, entrees and desserts is a sweet price for a great night with friends.

Of course I came to yelp to narrow down a restaurant with the right price range, neighborhood and yelper approval. Wildfire is what popped...so we went with it.  Alot was riding on this dining experience - my empty tummy's happiness, my mood, my cummulative first impression of Chicago, etc.  Right on Yelpers - this place was the perfect dining experience to represent Chicago in my mind until I find my way to the windy city again.  The restaurant has an overwhelming nostalgic feel, despite never living in the time that inspired it. Its dark, its jazzy and you almost want to look around for a camera bc it surely seems like a place that should be part of an old movie set. Drinks - We ordered the martini sampler. Neither of us ever drink martini's but the atmosphere almost seemed to require it. Delicious!  Apps - Stuffed mushrooms and Crab Cakes. Stuffed mushrooms were good, crab cakes weren't worth the calories or money in my opinion. More breading than crab and there were vegetables mixed in? Not BAD, just didn't really work for me. Dinner - Ummmm. YUM. Trio of filets. 1 parm crusted, 1 mushroom crusted and 1 baked potato crusted. I don't know if this is a concept specific to Chicago steakhouses (the crusts), because I've never seen it before, but  it is absolutely brilliant I must say.

The main differences between Wildfire and the ""heavy hitters"" is that Wildfire is more affordable, actually serves a side dish with their steaks (crazy, I know), and does it without the holier-than-thou attitude. Fine, maybe you don't get to pick out your own cut of beef, but, seriously, do I give a crap which steak I get? Um... no. That's just a stupid gimmick anyway. I'm sure that 95% of people, myself included, don't know what the hell they're doing picking out their own steak. Gimme a break. Anyway, Wildfire's food is mostly all fantastic. Everything from salads to burgers to the crusted steaks and daily specials. Granted, not everything is phenomenal, but hey, I'm not complaining. They still have the best spinach and artichoke fondue I've ever had in my life. Their steaks are not the most ultimately amazing steaks in the world, but they are very very good. Really, you can't go wrong. My only real complaint is that they took my favorite steak dish of all time off the menu. They used to have these tenderloin tips which were served in a housemade worcestershire sauce. Seriously, it was a god damned orgasm on a plate. Alas, they replaced it with the much less impressive Basil Hayden Bourbon tenderloin tips. But, I digress.

Of course when I've come to this location, I've never actually ordered a meat-based entree, but rather picked off others who have. I tend to stick with the seafood. Ooooh, the seafood. I may be in love with the Teriyaki Glazed Ahi Tuna steak which is sashimi-grade tuna encrusted with black and white sesame seeds, marinated with a light soy/ponzu sauce and lightly seared on the outside. The beautifully tender tuna steak comes with a side of wasabi-mayonaise, more soy/ponzu sauce and plenty-o pickled ginger. The fried calamari is a must-try. If you have no plans to save room for dessert, at least ask to see the dessert tray. That just may change your mind. Service is usually above average and very friendly. Who knew that they have such an aweseome children's menu as well?",0.9743,0.846,0.138,0.016,0.5099439775910364
2007-06-21,4.0,Wildfire is a pretty good (and safe) choice if you're in the mood for American cuisine for a reasonable price.  All the chains are about the same.  Most things are good.. but some things are misses in my opinion.  I am not a fan of their ribs or their NY strip special (which is not a steak just thin strips of it). I like their steaks (prime rib and Porterhouse) and fish  dishes.  Their chopped salad is pretty good and so is their woodfired mussels.  The desserts are pretty big too.. so you can share it if you just order one.,0.9709,0.731,0.228,0.041,0.5747448979591836

2007-06-11,2.0,"Upon recently moving to the River North area, my boyfriend and I have been making date nights out of the hundreds of restaurants within walking distance from our apartment. ""Wildfire"" caught our eye as there were many people waiting for the valet and the menu seemed right up our alley- as we are total carnivores.  We were seated right away and caught a glimpse of the ""decade"" decor and fire behind us. Water was served without ice and only filled half the glass....I should have walked out after this, as our experience got much worse.  Ten minutes later our waitress arrived and practically forced our order out of us. Guess she was too busy at 9pm on a Sunday night. We decided on a wine flight, french onion soup, chopped salad, lamb for me and porterhouse for him. She returned another ten minutes later to inform me that the lamb special was out.  I requested that the manager allow me to have the other lamb dish she recommended for the special price- but he declined. I ordered the prime rib instead. At this point I was slightly disturbed and the fruit flies flying around our bread were not helping the mood.  The salad was tasty, the soup was overly salty...and the wine was decent.  When the steaks arrived.....i gagged at the color- it looked rare to me and the two bites I had instantly made my tummy hurt. He hardly touched the porterhouse as well, because the consistency was stringy and mushy....I'm still unsure why that was.  After complaining to the manager for the second time- our practically untouched steaks were taken off our bill and the waitress finally got the hint that the overall experience we had was far under par. Regardless of their last second attempt to satisfy a customer, I will not be returning to any of the Wildfire's. So $50 bucks later- sans steak- we walked home with two tummy aches. Take my advice and try Sullivan's a few blocks south- for a few bucks more a pop, its well worth it.",-0.8378,0.874,0.051,0.076,0.38234126984126976

I've been here plenty of times, and the quality is what keeps me coming back. SOME (and I'll repeat) SOME Lettuce Entertain you restaurants can do that. Goat cheese for an appetizer is a must, and I always suggest the chopped salad, as it's one of the best I've ever had. This means it of course can't be too healthy, loaded with blue cheese, pasta, chicken, avocado, and don't forget the bacon.  The Filet Trio is always on the menu no matter what. It's listed as a featured special but it's always on there. I'm not sure if Wildfire is the originator of the encrusted flavors on top of steaks, but they were the first I've seen to have them and I love them for it. Horseradish, Blue Cheese, Parmesean, Peppercorn, whatever your flavors are they have them, and if you get the Filet Trio, you get to choose three different crusts if you like.

2006-09-13,2.0,"I know I have not been yelping of late, but this restaurant needs to be mentioned.  DISCLAIMER: Said review is temporary, because I feel I need to revisit the restaurant again, before ripping a new hole. When a friend named TURBO comes into town, you are obliged to partake in the finest meats and cheeses.  Ergo, after consulting with my Yelp Colleagues, I thought Wildfire would be a safe bet...unfortunately I was led astray. Atmosphere: Granted I walked in with a collared shirt, while my friend TURBO adorned a T-shirt and Backpack, but the atmosphere appeared a little more business casual.  Walking in you notice it is a pretty crowded and noisy place, almost like a cramped Fogo, but adorned in a more upscale steak house decor.  Tables are close together, but cozy, and a roaring fire near the back of the room for effect.  Not the best place to have a conversation.   Service:  We nicknamed our waiter Waldo....because most of the time we had no idea where he was.  He was there when we ordered, and pretty much when things went bad...I will go into that later.  Overall they are dressed professionally, adding to said ""upscale"" atmosphere. Food: ""sigh"" so we ordered the Chef's Recommendation Filet Medallions Trio, small ""mini steaks"" which offer you the option of using different ""crusts"" on each.  Side note: Apparently Wildfire is known for their ""crusts"" i.e. stuff they put on their meat for added joy and rapture.  They also give you a guide on how to cook your steak, Rare/Med/Med/Well etc. so effective you don't screw up.  The Filet Medallions Trio when it came out was remarkably small, maybe 9-10 oz total.  Also only 1 side comes with your meal.  I had ordered as per manual my steak Med/Well.  First Filet Medallions was exquisite, one of the best steaks I have had.  However, when I came to the next two they were burnt beyond well done.  I ate the second one out of denial, but by the third I knew something was up.  TURBO being the carnivore he is got his steak med/rare, and it came out more Med/Well, so this might be pathologic.  SInce Waldo was no where to be found we ended up waiting almost a half an hour before we could say our piece.  I wasn't out for blood (mmmm medium rare), but  wanted to speak my mind.  We met with Waldo and maybe the assistant chief to the secretary (or something) Manager, who apologized.   Mommy Factor:  Ehh, if all went well I am sure mom might not mind this place.  It is really noisy, and the frenzied wait staff might turn her off. Date Factor:  Again upscale to be a good date spot, but close quarter might kill a degree of romanticism.  Though there was a couple both dressed in matching blue, I nearly choked on my overdone  Medallion. Bling:  Our meal was $28 a piece, which was our ""steaks"" and one side, with all the bread two strapping lads could eat.  In the end, since I was politely angry, and using phrases like ""inadequate degree of quality assurance"" and ""only a modicum of concern"" the apologetic waiter put the meal on the house.  Which I had to say I appreciated, but in hindsight was justified. Ohh well. Again I have to say I am not comfortable keeping 2 stars, because the first steak made me think this could be a really good place.  However, it goes to show that even Michael Jordon missed a layup once in a while.  Though I want to revisit in future to see if this was a fluke.",0.9961,0.791,0.152,0.058,0.4774673821548822

This Wildfire I didn't enjoy as much, just because it was so crowded.....there was a 2 hour wait for a table, so we ended up sitting at the bar. Eating at the bar was not a good experience, there were people all around us and it was hard to be comfortable. Every five minutes someone was on the side of me, hollering out their drink orders in my ear. We were there fairly early (about 5PM) but I guess on a Saturday that is the start of the dinner/cocktail hour crowd. Also the service was OK.... Outside of that, the food was really good. I had the Saturday special, NY Sirloin and crusted shrimp with fresh garlic spinach....the shrimp were too DIE for.....

2006-08-12,5.0,"I love Wildfire. Excellent food, excellent service, excellent atmosphere--everything is simply, well, excellent.  I don't eat beef, pork or lamb myself, so I am proof that Wildfire is great for more than steaks! I swear by the soy-glazed cedar plank salmon, which is always delish. Sides are huge and wonderful, especially the mashed potatoes and broccoli. Appetizers are always good, especially all the seafood options, and desserts are always huge and outstanding!  I love the warm and cozy interior, with the sort of swing-era feel, dark wood, old cocktail bar feel, and rock wall with chickens roasting.  However, for me, the service always meant the most. Since I was a teenager, my family has been extremely devoted to LEYE restaurants, most notably Wildfire and Joe's.  I had some serious medical issues when I was a teenager and for some time had to have fat/calorie/protein figures for everything I ate. While I rarely ate out at the time, we did want to go out for a meal. After having several Chicago restaurants tell us they were unable to provide us with all ingredients and nutritional facts, Wildfire faxed us the figures within 24 hours, and we had a marvelous meal.  Our family grew to know the manager by name, and that example grew to be a perfect example of why we have always been loyal Wildfire patrons.",0.9958,0.746,0.244,0.011,0.7010044642857143
2006-08-07,4.0,"I am not a cheerleader. And I don't give bad places a second chance...As for Wildfire, this is obviously a big, charismatic chain outlet of Lettuce Entertain You. Beyond that, it completely satisfies the pallette in every way. Big flavors match the big atmosphere. Yes, it's crowded and thus noisy, but the food is what counts for me. Never, and when I say this, I refer to the three occasions I have eatin here in the last two years, NEVER have I had a bad meal here. Every person I go with has been equally satisfied. If anything, overly satisfied. You want to keep eating until you are stuffed. The secret is to try for the ""perfect meal"". Get the full experience, but leave feeling 99.99% full. (I hate to feel bloated after a meal. Ruins my night.)     Get an appetizer, but be careful, you must save lots of room for the entree AND drinks/water. Best to share here. Great for date #3 or more. Pecan encrusted Halibut IS always wonderful. The filet tip trio is always devine. But my favorite, and perhaps the most decadent (and healthy) is the BBQ rubbed sweet potato. This is worth the price of admission. Tender and sweet. And it's huge. Please be careful as all items are quite (Americanized), thus large. You need a big appetite here or count on a heavy doggie bag.      The key is to eat slow, enjoy each bite and let the experience envelope you.
