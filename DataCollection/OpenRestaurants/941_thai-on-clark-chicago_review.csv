Panang curry was decently spiced, plenty of basil without being overly sweet; The pad see ew while nothing that blew me out of the water was at least not overly sauced; both were a good portion. Lunch specials start at $7, but even aside from those golden hours, regular entrée prices are only a dollar or so more, so Thai on clark always tends to be an affordable choice. Especially given its convenient location 5 minutes away, it's probably on my list of standby restaurants for a meal now whenever you don't have other plans.",0.6684,0.914,0.061,0.025,0.5749216524216525

They were both horrible to say the least! The chef had put way too much fish sauce in the Fried Rice, so much so that we could taste nothing else but the Fish Sauce and ended up only being able to eat a bite or two before we had to give up. As for the Rama Chicken, that was just some rubbery meat with GLOBS of Gelatinous Peanut Butter ""Sauce"" (if you could call it that) on a bed of boiled Broccoli. That too was put aside after only a bite.  If you are thinking of going to this place, I'd highly recommend that you rethink your choice.

As we were all very hungry by this time, the men in our group kind of cut to the chase & asked if we'd be able to put enough tables together to seat us altogether. They were very accommodating & welcoming & had everything in order in no time.  I, being gluten-intolerant, was a little nervous as the host's English seemed a bit limited and my Thai non-existent (and in my experience that makes the discussion of ingredients a little tricky), but our server, Brian, was highly fluent and a gluten expert to boot! He quickly listed various dishes that could be customized to meet my needs. Holy Schnikes!  I had the BEST (gluten free) red tofu curry of my life to date. I had asked for spicy...and I'm one of those people who uses habaneros when the recipe calls for jalepenos, so I'm usually disappointed with the restaurant version of ""spicy.""

The first few times I'd been there, the cuisine was uninspiring (I focused on curries) and left me wanting more. But, ToC happens to be right down the street, and this proximity gave us a sort of pseudo-relationship -- an acquaintances-with-benefits situation you might say -- and I kept going back. Eventually, I found the back page, the dinner menu, and found some real gems on there. As goes with relationships, the rocky beginning has persisted beyond the slow start... and the current problem is: I keep breaking their stuff.  I don't know what it is or why these things keep happening, but I'm starting to develop a guilt complex. First, it was their bottle opener (they're BYOB), which was cheap and flimsy, but still. Then, it was a water glass. Most recently, my date knocked over their jar of red sauce, breaking the ceramic dish and spoon.  At this point, do I break it off? The guilt is starting to rack up, but I guess I still persisted when they were getting all the benefits of the relationship (my money, while I was getting ok food), but now that I'm getting the benefits (good food, but my money's subsidizing their in-coincidentally failing infrastructure) ...

What it comes down to is average-to-slightly-above-average food, great service, and some of the lowest prices I've seen. First of all, the service is always incredible, whether you're getting takeout or dining in. Last weekend, they threw in an order of crab rangoon after we had to wait for just three minutes. Three minutes is not rangoon-worthy in my opinion, but hey, nom nom nom. The food ranges from amazing to all right, depending on what you get. I highly recommend any of the curries, particularly green curry or panang curry. Definitely the high point of the menu for me. Their potstickers are also amazing. The only thing I would not order again is the Pad See Eiw -- the noodles were oddly rubbery.

I proudly add another two stars to Thai on Clark.  And...the owner is so gosh darn nice.  I'm sorry to you Mr. Owner for only giving you 3 stars in the past.",0.9769,0.759,0.189,0.052,0.6824999999999999
2008-12-01,4.0,This is my Thai place which is saying a lot since I have so many options on Argyle. It's just lo-key and I like the family vibe. You'll notice they are not the fastest due to the fact that everything is piping hot to order.,0.3612,0.943,0.057,0.0,0.5750000000000001
2008-11-04,1.0,"I ordered delivery here last night. Never again... I was told it would take 45 minutes, it took 1 hour and 10 minutes. When I called to check they were not friendly or apologetic at all about the long wait.  Then my lukewarm food came. The pad thai was sticky and bland, and had gross dry pieces of pork in it and was oversweetened.. The sesame chicken was chewey meat with a soggy exterior. I should have known better than to get sesame chicken, but it sounded good. The crab rangoon had a weird flavor, too. An all-around flop. There are far too many other choices to even think about giving this place a second try after slow and bad service and crappy food.",-0.8678,0.795,0.066,0.139,0.5412037037037037
2008-10-28,4.0,"I like the cheesy decor. I like that this place is family owned. It's pretty great when the server tells you that Mom is making your pad thai and spring rolls.  Seriously, I'd take Mom over Mario Batalli any day of  the week (to be blunt, he would too I'm willing to bet)! Perhaps it is because I hope to be adopted by a woman that can cook (attention: I am taking applications!).

2008-08-31,5.0,"I am very lucky to have Thai on Clark be my nearest thai restaurant.  We started out going here to take advantage of their lunch special: soup, appetizer and entree choice for like $5.50, less than 6 bucks.  Then I started branching out into other menu items, the tofu soup with chicken is a pile of fresh veggies in a clear chicken broth-excellent hangover cure/cold day healing.  The spicy basil with chicken is perfect, but the other night we took advantage of the BYOB policy; I had the Jungle curry, my husband had the Rama curry, it sent this place into the 5 star category. Not only is the food spicy when advertised, but just quality across the board.  You can't beat the service and the price.  heart heart love love neighborhood thai place.",0.9751,0.812,0.188,0.0,0.6658163265306121
2008-07-13,5.0,"I get better Thai food here than on my three trips to Thailand.  The yellow curry (which most places don't even offer) is great so is the spicy basil noodle and the pad thai.  The atmosphere is simple, but clean. Service is friendly and fast.  I love the fish cakes and the tempura!  I will say that I prefer to eat in.  But I think most food is better fresh from the kitchen vs. delivery.  It's BYOB with a liquor store just a half block down.",0.9698,0.709,0.252,0.038,0.4616213151927438

2007-11-11,5.0,"I love this place.  I live just down the street and come here very often.  The reasons are pretty simple:  1) It is good Thai food.  Is it the best I've ever had?  Probably not, but their green curry is amazing and they will make it as spicy or as mild as you want them to.  2) It is cheap.  2 people can have drinks, entrees, and an appetizer for less than $25 3) It's comfortable.  I can wander through the door in sweatpants and no one will care.  4) It's quick.  If you feel like speed-eating you can be in and out in 40 minutes.",0.9753,0.75,0.227,0.023,0.5141798941798942
2007-04-22,2.0,"I don't have any ill feelings towards Thai on Clark per se, but I've ordered takeout from there several times and have never been blown away by the food. It's alright for when you're desperate for food and don't want to wait very long (I live very close by), but there are far superior options elsewhere in the city for around the same price range.  In general, I'd lean away from going here unless I was dying and really needed some (mediocre) yellow curry or something. :P",0.8494,0.825,0.131,0.045,0.5746428571428572

I tried it...it's alright.  Not as good as other Thai places I've tried and I've tried a lot.  I had their Pad See Ew beef.  It was too watery.  Maybe I'll try it another time but this time I give it a 2.

2006-07-16,3.0,"Maybe I haven't given this place enough of a chance, seeing that I've only been here once.  However, nothing here really seemed all that great.  If I go back and have a better experience, I'll change my rating.   As Amy mentioned, the wood panel & mirrored walls are less than glamorous.  And the place is fairly small.. I think 5-6 tables total.   My friend and I both quickly found something that sounded good on the menu and our orders were taken quickly.   The iced Thai coffee was good, but we both agreed that our entrees are done better at other area Thai places.  The mild curry that I ordered is a little cheaper than it is where I usually order from, but in this case, the more $/better taste wins out.   I didn't think the serving sizes were that big; my friend plowed through his entree and while I happened to have leftovers this time, if I had gone in on a totally empty stomach, I would have nothing for lunch tomorrow.. and that would make me sad.  I thought the service was friendly enough and fast enough because we were there for a leisurely lunch, but had I been in a hurry, I would have been annoyed by the waiting for the check and then to get change.   If I happen to be on the 4600 N block of Clark and am jonesing for Thai, I'd give this place another shot.  Otherwise, I'll just stay closer to home where the food is better anyway.",0.9651,0.808,0.14,0.053,0.489367816091954
2006-06-02,5.0,"If I had a car, I'd drive here once a week to have Thai.  But I don't.  And the Clark bus can be a little sketch at times (in my opinion).  But I would walk here for this shiznit.  It's just THAT good.  This place is rub-your-belly, sigh-contentedly good.   The restaurant is by no means glamorous (think low-budget 70's decor), but it has a cozy and unassuming atmosphere, which I chalk up to the fact that it's family-run.   It's BYOB with no corkage fee (woo hoo!), cheap (double woo hoo!), and just plain finger-lickin-good.  Though I don't think many people lick Thai food off their fingers.  But I digress.  Appetizers, main dishes, you name it, I love it.  The menu is quite extensive, whether you want something to spice up your life or take the palate-friendly and wonderfully seasoned route.   And the portions are big enough to feed 2 people (unless you're a linebacker with a gargantuan appetite). The service is great and friendly as well (once again, thanks to the fact that it's family-run).   My only regret on my first visit here is that my group of friends neglected to bring enough wine, and there isn't a shop close by, so I would suggest overestimating booze consumption. Remember the trifecta: good food, good prices, BYOB.  You can't lose.",0.9922,0.732,0.217,0.051,0.49596273291925463
