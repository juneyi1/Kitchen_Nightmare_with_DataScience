However when I got there, the host said he didn't think we were coming and went to go check. The hostess then came and she knew where our party was. So that worked out.  The service was what other patrons stated. It was busy and tough to get our waiter. We ordered our appetizers and food. 2 of us ordered pork chops and they were thin, which is not the way most places serve. But we both complained about how dry they were. We waved down the waiter and told him. He said be right back. He came back with I think a manager. She said to have them redone. So I commend them for the graciousness to redo them. But some of us had hot meals and the pork chops the first time came out cold. The redo of the pork hops came out hot and with juices on the plate.  We then asked for the bill. We had 3 sangrias, ice tea and a VIRGIN mango martini. The charge for the virgin mango martini was more expensive than the sangria. We asked and the waiter said that's how much it is and he doesn't make the decisions. There's no alcohol! Isn't that the expensive part of a drink.

When we asked to separate it the manager made a huge deal out of it. To the point where I finally just gave up and paid the whole bill myself. Luckily it wasn't super expensive.

We had the Pastichio and Kota Fourno (baked chicken) and both were decent. The chicken had good flavor and it's usually my go to at Greek restaurants since I'm super picky about other dishes.

When I motioned to my glass he brought it, but apparently thought it was my third. In hindsight I should have mentioned he forgot my drink but I could see he was busy and we were in no hurry; I didn't want to be rude.

2017-02-28,1.0,"I hate to give 1 star reviews but this was a 1 star experience.  My family and I go to Greek town for an all out, delicious Greek experience (once a year).  This year we went to Pegasus and it was very disappointing.  We walked in (with a reservation) and were told that there was a 15 minute wait and were told to hang out at the bar.  Not a big deal so we went to the bar.  Half of us ordered drinks and the rest were in the process of ordering, when we were told to close our tab because our table was ready.  Again, not a big deal, but annoying since there were 5 people ordering drinks.  When we got to the table we were greeted by our server with menus.  He gave us the menus, took the remaining people's drink orders, and left.  We waited for about 10 minutes before drinks arrived and ordered our appetizers.   Appetizers- Saganaki: we ordered two saganakis and when they arrived the waiter literally stood behind us, next to another table and did the whole shebang.  He never once told us that was our order or to look, or even the big/loud OPA!  So we were surprised when he walked the cheese over to us and we didn't even get to see the production.  I get it, not really authentic in Greece BUT authentic in the Chicago, Greek town experience.  Give me the damn OPA! Main Course- Really disappointing.  We all ordered avgolemono soup and it tasted, and looked like, cream of chicken soup.   Two people ordered the sampler.  It looked as though they had thrown in a bunch of stuff with little attempt at presentation.  The phyllo dough in one of the dishes wasn't even browned.  The lamb was poor quality and the pastas were basic (at best).  My husband didn't hate the gyro platter (but he did not love it either). My pasta was just sorry looking. Cocktails- Not good.  Poor quality liquors seemed to me to not have proportions right.  The raspberries in my drink tasted old. Service- The service was very slow for a Sunday evening and it seemed as though they were under staffed.  The bus boys didn't call our waiter when we asked for him and they didn't bring us more water when we asked for it.  Our server was absent most of the time that no one got more than one cocktail.  We began to joke that the next time he came by we would just order everything we needed for the evening and the check.  All in all, we must of seen him about 4 times all night. It seemed like he was having an off night.  Not a problem, per se, everyone has off nights.  The issues were exasperated with his absence so we all became irritated with the lack of water/drinks.     The worst part was that the other waiter 'told' on our waiter and then our waiter got reprimanded in front of everyone in the restaurant.  It was extremely uncomfortable and it just sucked because I ended up feeling bad for our waiter.  Come one manager, we're all adults, take him aside and have a PRIVATE conversation.  It's my experience that if the service staff is out of sorts it's because there is a problem with the management. After all is said and done our bill totaled over $300 and it was not worth it, AT ALL.   We won't be back.",-0.9951,0.83,0.045,0.125,0.4790529100529101

Definitely tasty with the oil and vinegar adding a great flavor to the combination.  As for the lamb dishes, the braised lamb with the lemon sauce was very delicious. The lamb was tender, moist and was complimented by the potatoes. For my dish? (The braised lamb with tomato sauce placed on a bed of spaghetti) No, just no. I'll sum it up very quickly for you. Dry lamb placed on top of dry spaghetti does not go well, if it was moist it would have been delicious. And the near tasteless tomato sauce didn't do anything to help lubricate the dry plate. 3 stars for the salad and the other lamb that was served. As for mine?

Our dish then where brought out, I again went with a safe dish and ordered the Gyros Piato and my wife ordered the Moshari Tashkebob. The gyro was served with mostly onions and three wedges of Roma tomatos, five wedges of pita and a small side of tzatziki sauce. The beef and lamb was well seasoned but the sauce lacked flavor and also needed more cucumber. The rice pilaf was nothing more than boiled brown rice with no flavor what so ever. Bottom line for my dish, the protein was The only worth while part of the meal.

Update:  I'm updating here because I have been hassled by the restaurant more than a few times now to respond. I really hope they don't ask for further communication. I had my experience, I posted about it on yelp because there are many restaurants in Greek town and I think reviews can help people decide where to go.

I asked what kind of seasoning was on the chicken and the waiter replied with oregano and greek seasonings, I asked if they can do the lemon and oregano that is on the half chicken to which he replied no they can't change the seasonings, which I thought was weird but fine I kept my order the same. Our kalamari and salad came out one after the other which was great, I had to ask the waiter for clean plates every time.

The waiter never came over to our table to tell us what was wrong we had to flag him down and say can you check on this for us. He was busy bussing tables and ignoring us. Our food finally came out my husbands was fine but the tomatoes were not ripe so he couldn't eat those with his gyro and his three potatoes that he got he didn't like. My chicken plate had a huge piece of chicken with tons of seasoning, three slices of peppers, one eggplant piece and one piece of zucchini and a scoop of rice. I ate maybe half of the chicken as it was over seasoned. The waiter never came to check on us to see how the meal was, or if we needed anything else.

Very well done. However, we sat on the rooftop and WOW, what a VIEW! It is absolutely a world-class view, you have a direct shot of the Sears Tower and, if you go at the right time of day, you are not in any direct sun but the entire skyline is. SO COOL and beautiful. There are plenty of tables on the roof (all plastic, cheap chairs), covered and uncovered, and the whole vibe is just very relaxed and chill. So enjoyable.

Food: We came of Saganaki and that is what we started with: two orders.

2016-05-23,1.0,"Well, I rarely post on Yelp. But we had such a disappointing experience at Pegasus last Saturday that I could not ignore it. We thought that we might dine on their rooftop, and in fact that's why I we chose this restaurant. It turned out they were serving an extremely limited menu on the rooftop, so we elected to go downstairs to the main dining room. That's where the trouble began. I guess that the flaming cheese was OK. But it was impossible to enjoy it because the bread was so bad. The horiatiki (village) salad for the table was dreadful. The tomatoes were inedible, and they included next to no feta cheese. We needed to order a new and separate plate of cheese in order to augment the salad. Before the salad arrived, the bread was stale. We sent the first basket back to the kitchen. The replacement basket was truly no better. Now people are thinking about ordering their dinners. My husband enjoyed his Seabass, however I could see that the portion was skimpy. Usually a huge fish is served and filleted.The braised beef and macaroni was tasteless. My step daughter could not eat her spinach pie because it was soggy and tasteless. Three of us ordered the special lamb with artichokes and egg lemon sauce. Just speaking for my portion, the lamb was fatty, bony, and the artichokes were not properly cleaned and prepared. One at our table enjoyed his chicken Alexander. And the lamb chops appeared to be OK. But when it was over and done with, we had spent $50 per person for what was essentially a terrible dinner. Service was adequate, however the meal itself was truly disappointing. Remind me never to go there again. Greek Isles is so far superior that there is no comparison. And if you have the energy to go out to Lincolnwood, Psistaria is even better. We used to joke that they had one central kitchen for the Greek restaurant in Greektown.

Brooke was extremely inviting and friendly and even offered a couple of menu suggestions for my approaching dinner. When my guest arrived we were seated by a friendly hostess, were met promptly with water, and shortly after our server greeted us and introduced himself.  He eloquently described the specials for the evening and quickly brought us our drinks from the bar.   Not being a foodies or Greeks, we had so many questions about the expansive menu.  This is where I was most impressed. Howard was able to answer every question we lobbed at him.  When my guest asked for a couple of vegetarian options he quickly pointed out three specific dishes that all sounded delicious!  She had a vegetarian pasta with artichokes and sun dried tomatoes that even my carnivorous self couldn't help but want to taste. I had the tomato braised Colorado lamb (a confirmed suggestion by our server and bartender.) This was possibly the most tender, moist, flavorful lamb preparation I've ever had.

2015-11-14,2.0,"Really disappointing. We had intended to go to Greek Islands, but they had electrical problems and were closed. We reluctantly walked across the street to Pegasus, well aware of the 3.5 rating on Yelp. Overrated, as we were soon to learn.  NB: I visit Greece several times a year on business. I lived in Athens for several years as a youth. Greek cuisine is my favorite cuisine. I've eaten at good tavernas and bad tavernas. I'm perfectly happy with average taverna fare.  We asked to be served mezedes style, as we ordered saganaki (I know...my daughter wanted it), kalamari, horiatiki, horta, and the lambchop plate. They brought out each dish individually: first saganaki, 15 minutes later the kalamari, 15 minutes later the salad. When the older Greek gentleman (owner?) stopped by the table, I had to specifically ask that the Horta and lamb plate be brought out at the same time. I would have been embarrassed as a Greek to have served the horiatiki salad with a laughable solitary 1 inch cube of feta (no exaggeration) on top. I mentioned it to the Greek, and he brought out a dainty plate with 5 more little cubes (well after our salad was finished). If this were an American run place, I could forgive, but the presence of Greeks in the building made this particularly egregious.  They could not keep their hands off of our plates. The wait staff kept trying to remove dishes from the table that still had food in it, plates from in front of us that still had our food on it. The first time it happened, we asked nicely to leave them as we're still finishing. The second time, I was annoyed.

The spinach rice kind of disappointed me, it had a creamy spinach mixed into the rice which was also mushy.

The waiter brought it over and literally lit the cheese on fire on a metal plate that is also abundant in alcohol and olive oil. The flaming process fried the cheese and gave it a crispy exterior while maintaining an interior of melted cheese. Exquisite!   My sister in law also ordered baby octopus as an appetizer. They not only grilled the baby octopus to give it a little charred flavor, but it was so well done that the texture of the octopus transformed from soft to chewy. Talk about satisfaction!

2014-12-24,1.0,"I wanted to like this place. I really did. I heard about it from a friend of mine who highly recommended this joint for some authentic Greek food. I think they forgot to make Greek food; it was more like low-budget Italian food. Think a step below the Olive Garden. My dish had so much oil in it I had to pour it out on a separate plate, and it was suffocated in a garlicky cheese. There are places out south that I can go to get the same quality of food for seven dollars a plate, but with more flavor. However these plates cost an astronomical 20 bucks each. My husband and I also got mixed drinks, which were also horrible. My husband's drink was very watery, and mine had way too much thyme syrup. I only drank about a quarter of it. How horrible! It's Christmas Eve! I want a buzz not a sugar rush. * insert sad face* We also had the meatball appetizer, which tasted more like an authentic Greek dish so if anything get that, even though that was only just okay as well. Overall I think this place would've been right on time for a greasy spoon joint if the prices mirrored the quality of the food and I was drunk and hungry as hell. I'm definitely never eating Greek food in the city again. I'll just have to travel to Greece for the real deal. Service was great though!",-0.7252,0.811,0.1,0.089,0.4620935960591133

However, our service was excellent and we were given pretty good recommendations. Plus, the rooftop dining area gave us a relaxing late afternoon in the sunshine and breeze. Basically, an overall pleasant trip had me rounding this up to a 4.   I came for post-work tapas with 3 of my co-workers and we very much indulged in a whole slew of dishes after a busy day. I think tapas are a great option for small groups that want to try a ton of different plates at a reasonable price. I would recommend getting a couple of dishes to start off and then adding more if stomach allows.   Soutzoukia - The meat balls are delicious but the sauce tastes like Greek pasta sauce. Skippable or not depending on how much you really like meatballs.  Gyros - Awesome! Comes with lots of beef and lamb. Very flavorful but salty to the max. Dolma - Excellent homemade yogurt sauce on the side. The dolma was standard. Souvlakia - Pork kabobs! One of my favorite plates but also very salty. Arni Kebob - A good choice if you're into lamb. I thought this was just average but lamb isn't really my thing.  Melitzanosalata - This grilled eggplant spread with pita bread is such a good appetizer if you're looking for a lighter type of spread.  Tirokafteri - This one is a spicy feta and cheesy spread with pita. I wouldn't say this was spicy at all and it's heavier and saltier than the eggplant one but I still enjoyed it.",0.9914,0.785,0.184,0.031,0.5427083333333332

I ordered a gyro meal and then got a gyro salad. I knew it wasn't right but didn't complain because as I stated above it was tasty. And in the end it did save me a few bucks, so there's that I guess...  Then when we were trying to pay the bill, my friend and I were splitting it on two credit cards and the employee took them and then was gone for I'd say at least ten minutes. He finally came over and said it would just be another second but if the system is down, tell people a little faster so we're not confused about what's happened to our cards. Really I'd give the service tonight probably just two stars. Shame since my friend raved about this place.  My friend liked her spanakopita. It looked good and big, nice portion size.

2014-07-10,1.0,"We went here as a group of 7 and were very underwhelmed.  Please note that they were not busy. The saganaki was the only great part and even then we had to request bread for it.  For a Greek restaurant, I would've expected the Greek salad to be exceptional but it was not at all.  They only offered it as a side salad (I don't eat meat) and it was large chunks of onions and tomatoes plopped on some romaine with three olives and one (I said ONE) piece of feta cheese.  Seriously? The waiter (Nikko) was very loud and never stuck around for more than 5 seconds to see if anyone wanted anything.  He kept running away after asking one person if they were good with everything.  We had to wait so long for anything because all done person by person. Our table was long and we had to continuously ask to pass the bread basket back and forth.  When we asked for a second basket we were told by the waiter that we already had a basket.  What?  We can't have more that one at a long table.  We always had to request more bread and water - it was never offered.  When we did stop the waiter long enough to get this request he would shout across the room at some poor bus boy to do it for him.  I had been here before and ordered a pasta dish that I didn't like (fennel involved) and when I ordered another pasta dish the waiter said ""Oh no, you don't want that one its too plain.  You want this one-(and pointed to the dish I did NOT want).""  I said no I want the one I ordered.  I've tried the other one and didn't like it.  He then seemed disappointed and tsk-tske'd me.  What?  The meal came out not what I expected at all and portion size SO small.  I thought I was getting noodles with tons of vegetables (per the description) but it was just spaghetti and tomato sauce.  I could've made it better.  It then took another ten minutes to waive the waiter down just to get some parmesan cheese on top. I am a vegetarian and there was little to no meal options for me. My mother-in-laws dish of fish was also not per the description and very oily.  This was also a birthday and it took the waiter until my mother-in-law started opening her presents to start actually being available when we needed some space.  My 5 year old niece told her mom she wanted ice cream and the waiter said ok right away!  and he went and got it for her without even asking her parents if it was ok.  Only after he brought her the ice cream did he ask any of us if we wanted some.  We had never gotten dessert menus so he had to go back and get those.  Finally, only my brother-in-law wanted ice cream with sour cherries- 20 MINUTES later he received it! Our meal started at 6pm and we did not get out of there until almost 8:45.  WAY too long. Besides the saganaki, the one other positive was that the rooftop was very nice, however, they only served small plates up there.   This is great for a happy hour but not for a meal.

I was immediately greeted by a *very* friendly host who gave me a flower, which I put in my hair, and seated us in a busy section, though there were a number of open tables throughout the rest of the place. We quickly learned that our waiter had been working all day and was extremely tired and beyond caring what kind of impression he made. I wondered why the host didn't seat us in the fresher, more energetic waiter's section, but it seemed that was too far away from his wandering eye? It took a while for us to order and receive our drinks, and the flaming saganaki came out with a half-hearted Opa... It was delicious, however, and we proclaimed little Opas! of our own over the salty lemony gooeyness in front of us. For my entree I had the spanakopita and this is always kind of a bland, but still good plate of food, no matter where you have it. I liked it, but as a plate it's kind of colorless and not exciting. I'm all about a regular home-cooking kind of place that doesn't add foams and useless garnishes just to make their plates look pretty, but when you get a white plate with a colorless square on it that has some dark green and white coming out of it, you kind of wish for a tomato or something to brighten things up.

This week I placed a delivery order: yuvetsaki (chunks of braised beef over rosa marina pasta), arni kapama (chunks of lamb over spaghetti), and a classic Greek salad. A friend and I tried all 3.  The yuvetsaki was very salty. I had to add some brown sugar and a splash of white vinegar to cut the saltiness. Afterward, the dish tasted better. I still couldn't really taste any herbs, but at least the tomato flavor came through. Some of the beef was fine, but most of it was overcooked and dry.  Compared to the beef dish, the arni kapama seemed under-seasoned. The lamb was tasty, but there were more chunks of pure fat than lamb in the dish. Compared to how some other restaurants serve this dish, the Pegasus version was skimpy on the lamb. The pasta was bland--not nearly as flavorful as I've had at other restaurants. Arni kapama is supposed to be tastier than this!  But here's my biggest complaint: The takeout containers were absolutely useless. They were too thin and dangerously flimsy. The bottom of one container--the one holding the yuvetsaki--split open on its way to my apartment, so that dish was leaking everywhere when the delivery guy handed it to me. The container holding the arni kapama also broke on the bottom while I was pulling it out of the delivery bag. What the hell, Pegasus?  On a positive note: Eh, the salad was very good and, strangely enough, that takeout container didn't break.

2012-09-26,3.0,"Pegasus just wasn't what I remember it to be back in my college days. ((Then again, any meal that cost more than 5 bucks or didn't consist of ramen noodles was typically pretty darn good.)) From what I remember I would have given it 4 to 5 stars. Now, I'm stretching for 3. Does the atmosphere remind you of something straight out of Greece? Sure. I assume so anyhow. Either way, it's cute and different in a Greek family home kind of way. No modern and contemporary designs here.  However, the food lacked a little something to be desired and the service a whole lot more. Don't get me wrong. The food wasn't bad. In fact, it was pretty good. Just not for the price tag. Example: 15 bucks for a plate of gyros? I expected those babies to be top notch, otherwise I would have walked a half of a block and grabbed one from Mr. Greeks, which is equally as good and a third of the price. I ordered the Yuvetsaki ((a fave from my college days)) and found it to have the same delicious flavors, but was significantly more salty and oily this time. The braised beef could have been a lot more tender as well. Boo. I did love the baklava, saganaki, and the dolmas. But again, kind of expensive for what you get.  The service left me irritated. Our server was very hands off and often scarce. When he did wait on us, each of our requests felt like we were putting him out. I didn't think that asking for water and lemon was a big deal. Thank goodness the server filling up the puny water glasses was on top of it or I would have been taking numerous trips to the bar for refills. But, the best was yet to come. We ordered a couple rounds of Ouzo and was fairly grossed out to find hot pink lipstick residue on some of the glasses. Gross. I don't want to know where those bright pink lips have been. When we told the waiter, we got them replaced with nothing more than a shrug. No comp, no apology. Nothing.  Would I go back? Eh. Maybe. I'm confident in saying I would try somewhere else first.

2012-08-05,4.0,"As many times as I've dined at Pegasus in the past year, I have no idea why I'm just getting around to writing a review. I think I've been taking the Greek delight for granted. Earlier this week I took my family there for my son's birthday. I've now decided we can't limit Pegasus to a ""special occasions"" restaurant. I thoroughly enjoy the almost festive (but not loud) environment, and the scenery reminds me of the Mediterranean Greek coast--to which I have never been. For warm appetizers I strongly recommend that you try the Saganaki (Imported Greek Cheese, Flambe), a must in any authentic Greek restaurant, and either the Garides Mikrolimano (Sauteed Shrimp with Feta Cheese, in Tomato Wine Sauce) or the Mydia (Steamed Mussels with Tomato, Parsley and Garlic in Ouzo Broth). Stay away from the Gyros unless you're starved--that's a meal not an appetizer! To have balance at your table consider at least one cold appetizer. We had both the Hummus (classic Mediterranean Garbanzo bean spread) and the ""Gyro sauce"" Tzatziki, which is a simply a delectable creamy yogurt & cucumber dip with garlic and olive oil. Would it be too pedestrian to say yummy? Ok, they are both REALLY good. From the broiler you cannot go wrong with a classic American staple with a Greek name: ""Brizola."" A New York top sirloin strip steak served with mushrooms and not too creamy whipped potatoes. However, the reason to go to any restaurant in Chicago's Greek town is lamb, and Pegasus has two delightful lamb chop dishes: Merakli Meze, traditional thin cut Lamb Loin Chops broiled to perfection and served with potato riganatti (or fries which I'd skip); and the Paidakia, two center cut, tender and succulent juicy Lamb Chops served with oven roasted potatoes and vegetables. The Gyros Piato served with the traditional Greek Tzatziki sauce, and Dolmades (seasoned ground Beef and Lamb mixed with white rice, wrapped in grape vine leaves) are also wonderful traditional Greek dishes prepared to perfection at Pegasus.",0.9928,0.827,0.151,0.022,0.4197311460469355

I came with a biiiiig party for a friend's birthday, but service was still fast and the food came out hot.  We ordered several bottles of cheese, and started with delicious saganaki and bread.  I think our table ordered 7 saganaki.  Everybody loves the hell out of that stuff!  Self included.  For my entree, I got the Pikilia #2, which is a combo of Greek standards.  It included Pastitsio, Spanakopita, Roasted Leg of Lamb and Chicken Riganatti, and also had some rice and potato alongside.  Big plate!  Everything was good - I especially liked the pastitsio because I really love savory pasta. The lamb was tender and flavorful too.  I'd easily order those as their own, stand-alone entree in the future.  It was $17.95 for that entree - so it's not a hugely cheap place, but the portions are SO BIG that you can easily get another meal out of your entree, especially if you start with saganaki and a salad or something. Haven't tried a Greektown place yet that I didn't like it!  Who can argue with cheap house wine, flaming cheese, and huge portions of savory deliciousness?  I can't say Pegasus really stood out to me above other yummy Greek restaurants in the area, but it certainly earned it's place among them.",0.997,0.721,0.25,0.03,0.5981792717086833

My experience at Pegasus was superior in every way.  My server, Maravina (sp?) was very friendly and helpful in all respects.  She greeted me with a big smile and took the time to explain the specials.  Once again I ordered the dolmades (I love these things when they're done right) and they were excellent.  Obviously hand made, they were much bigger and far tastier than the ones I had the night before.  I ate them slowly, rolling my eyes in happiness.  Now I know the feeling my cat gets when I give him a can of tuna. For an entree, I had Kotopolou Fournou.  Yeah, I couldn't pronounce it either so I just pointed at the description.  It is a half chicken, marinated and broiled with potato and grilled vegetables.  When it arrived, it looked too good to eat.  The Chef obviously knows his aesthetics as well as his food.  Long story short, everything was just too damned good.  The chicken was perfectly seasoned and cooked, the grilled vegetables were obviously fresh and not overcooked, and even the lowly potato was notably tasty.  The bubbly Maravina also told me that the chicken was Amish.  Or at least raised by them is my hope; the prospect of dining on poultry with religious convictions unnerves me. So now I'm happy.  If I return to Chicago you can bet I will visit Pegasus again.  I highly recommend.

We got there at 6:30 - probably a little early for the Saturday night dinner crowd - but were seated promptly.  Our waiter was a slightly older fellow who was distantly pleasant at first but warmed up considerably over the 90 minutes of so of our family dinner.

Probably like any other restaurant, they sang Happy Birthday and donated a dessert-for-one-plus sharers.  And as someone who's lived in Evanston for 23 years now, I like the complimentary valet parking.

The atmosphere is cute, but not very festive. Everytime I've been there it's kind of empty. We wanted to sit on the outdoor veranda but were told it's only for appetizers or desserts, and NOT dinner - very disappointing seeing as that's the MAIN/only reason we chose this place.

Food: The food is really comparable to Greek Islands. Similar prices, similar quality. We had everything to from octopus and swordfish to pasta and it was all quite tasty. Service: Obviously this depends on your waiter. Ours was about the worst I've ever experienced. We started by ordering wine and appetizers, but one in our party wanted an appetizer (octopus) as a main course. I didn't even have time to tell our server this and she had already taken off.

Of course when you order dinner after your appetizers are already gone you end up spending 45 minutes sitting at the table with no food in front of you. This did not seem to concern our server. We had run out of bread but no one made an effort to refill our basket. By this time our kid was getting pretty restless, so I didn't get to order the dessert I had been eyeing all evening. We got to the restaurant at 7:30 and left at 10:00. I don't need this to be fast food, but this is unreasonable especially with kids. Moreover, our server was rude, acted angry when we tried to get her attention, and was short with the table next to ours as well.

My husband ordered the gyro plate and it was also generous with the portion size, but one thing that drove him nuts was that they cut the pita into triangles.

The decor of the restaurant is nice and authentic and really makes the visit enjoyable and feel like we're right where we're supposed to be - to get some good Greek food. Even though we cam here early, around 430pm on a Sunday, the place had quite a bit of tables occupied already surprisingly, which can only point to good things! The menu is extensive and there is a lot to choose from. We decided on getting appetizers of fried eggplant (delicious, tasted kind of like chips) and this stringy melty cheese which was much too salty for my liking. The main dish I ordered was a combination of various greek foods including gyros, Pastitso (Which I forgot that I did not like that very much last time I had it at a different Greek resto. It tastes fine, I'm just not a fan of the dish or macaroni, for that matter), Doima (yum), Spanakopita (delicious!) and rice pilaf. I was satisfied with the food. My mom said her lamb was perfect and she was very happy with it, while my dad (who doesn't like trying new things, shame on him) got a New Yorker and said it was one of the best steaks he has ever had (surprisingly, at a greek resto?). He said it was up there right with Texas de Brazil.

Of course we called ahead to ask if they take reservations but the broad on the phone said they don't take reservations between certain hours on the weekends. OK, that's absolutely understandable. As we arrived we were immediately told we can be seated but we asked about the rooftop and if it's available. Host's answer was ""Well, you can go upstairs and take a look because I don't know."" We walked away and after climbing really steep staircase we arrived on the infamous rooftop. We were seated right by the kitchen door, but when we asked if we could get a table closer to balustrade but she said, ""Aww, I'm sorry but that table is reserved."" When we called before we were told that no reservations are taken on weekends. It was really confusing. We stayed at the table by the kitchen door, but after some time of waiting and looking over the skimpy menu we decided to dash. We went downstairs where we were seated. Everything seemed so nice until our waiter arrived. Ignorant, nonchalant d-bag. That about sums him up. WORTS SERVICE WE HAVE EVER RECEIVED. Busboys did more around our table than the waiter did.

My experience really deserves a 0 as I didn't even get to eat/drink anything other than the water & bread placed on the table when we were first sat, because we ended up walking out Once we got to the table, we started talking since we hadn't seen each other or gotten together in awhile. When our waiter came to get drinks, we told him that we hadn't looked at the menu, and he said he'd come back in a second. When he got there, we were ready to order.  I was doing the main ordering since we were going to split 4-5 appetizer plates so that we could enjoy a few different  items. I ordered our appetizers, and the waiter turned away pretty quickly to leave. My friend said, ""Excuse me, I think I'm going to get a salad."" And waived him back real quickly.  She ordered one of the salads, and then second guessed herself as she was trying to decided between 2 options. She asked him, ""Which do you think..."" and before she could finish her question, he interrupted her and said, ""Well, what I think is that I need to get the saganaki for this other table since you don't know what you want.""  AND TURNED RIGHT AROUND AND WALKED AWAY! My friend, who is a Southern girl with great manners, looked as though she had been smacked in the face with a fish. Looking around the table in awe, she asked my other friend and me, ""Did that seriously just happen?"" My other friend laughed nervously, which she does in uncomfortable situations, and I said that indeed our server had just been a prick. Being that all 3 of us have served, we found it completely unacceptable for our server to say that to us in such a foul tone. We did notice that there were a couple tables behind us with 5-7 people, and perhaps he was feeling busy and rushed with that stress. But if this were the case, you need to set expectations up front with your tables. If he would have said to us, ""Ladies, I'm a bit swamped tonight, so I just wanted to let you know that I'll be running around."" We probably would have been aware of what his stress level might have been. Also, what he SHOULD have done is said something to the sort of, ""I'm so sorry, but I must get their saganaki appetizer out, let be come right back and help you choose.""  However, being that he DIDN'T provide that information to us (if that was the issue), he should have NOT come to our table to provide us SERVICE if he couldn't dedicate a few minutes in helping us pick out dishes for the table. When he did come back after serving the saganaki to the other table, he came up defending himself saying, ""You know sometimes I have time to help but sometimes I don't. I just didn't have time."" Still in that impudent tone! And at this point, I interrupted him and said, ""Listen, we've all served, too, but this is COMPLETELY unacceptable."" He didn't want to discuss this, admit fault, etc. He just told me he ""didn't have time for this"" and walked away.  I told my 2 friends we were leaving, went to the hostess and asked to speak to the manager.  She pointed to the gentleman who was also behind the welcoming/hostess stand and identified him as the owner. I proceeded to tell him what had happened, and I then told him that we didn't have time to waste on his restaurant for that service. He was just quiet the whole time but did say sorry when I was done explaining.  So, sir, if you're reading this, let me suggest you either staff more on Saturday's, encourage your staff to ask help from you or others in running out basic appetizers to tables OR, perhaps, fire the eh-hole.

I've been there many times previously over the years, and the food was consistently good, so for that I'd give them 4-5 stars... hence the rough average of 3. OK, I feel that's fair : ) Zero class, but what did you expect.... On 1/9/11, I made reservations at Pegasus for 7:30 pm on same date. After valet parking, and my wife and I seating my ten-month old twins and three-year old, the manager refused to accept the  restaurant.com  $25 certificate issued 1/8/11. He claimed that Pegasus cancelled their relationship with  restaurant.com  as of 1/7/11. He said that it was Pegasus policy to refuse these coupons (and that they have refused three others), but that this was between Pegasus and  restaurant.com , not between my family and Pegasus. I could not understand this argument as he persisted in refusing to accept a coupon that was based on Pegasus participation in the  restaurant.com  program and stated on its front that it does not expire. He has obstinate and we went to the restaurant only because of the coupon, so we left. The restaurant was nearly empty. Presumably, Pegasus participated in  restaurant.com  to attract more business, which we were. Having ordered over $15 in drinks alone for two adults by the time they refused the $25 coupon, should have indicated that we are a worthwhile investment. Instead, Pegasus displayed a classless business practice. (We went to Iberico for dinner, which was filled with diners.) I spoke with  restaurant.com  on 1/11/11 and they still had Pegasus listed with them.

I saw something similar on the menu at Pegasus, the Kotosalata ""Pegasus"" salad, which promised grilled chicken, feta, mushrooms, peppers and green onion.  So I ordered it.   It was a small portion (for a salad that's priced at over $11) with grilled chicken that is nowhere near as flavorful as Athena's version, one little cube of feta, a smattering of green onions, a few olives, boring white button mushrooms, some sad tomatoes and cucumbers.  Not appealing and not exciting.  The dressing was even weak.  It was much more of an oily, unflavorful vinaigrette than true Greek dressing.   Sigh.

Let me begin with the walk -in. My first impression was that this was a fine dining kind of place, fancy white tablecloths on the tables, white linen napkins nicely folded to hold silverware (no paper napkins here) and wine glasses on the table.  Cha-ching! This ain't no gyro stand! Our waitress was kind of scary at first. She came to the table and asked us what we wanted to drink in a demanding manner.  We chose to have a bottle of wine and she came back with it pretty quickly.  We also asked for bucket of ice and she stated 'thats where I'm about to go, to get the bucket.'  Okay lady, calm down. We just want our wine cold.  Eek! So then the bread came out and it was good.  Only thing is we didnt see our waitress again for about 20 minutes.  Are we supposed to eat all the bread in the basket and drink all the wine before we order?? I dont know Greek customs but I found it a little strange.  And there were about 5 tables in the restaurant.  Eventually, she came around and we ordered.  I had the chicken rice soup with egg lemon and I LOVED it.  It was SO GOOD.  Also good on the menu was this cheese that is set on fire right in front of you and the waiter/ress yell Ooopa!  We got the cheese but minus the show so I was a little disappointed.  We saw our waitress do it for other patrons so we were kind of upset we didnt get to see ours on fire. :(  The cheese itself was delicious and I'd gladly order it again. Onto the main course, I ordered the roasted chicken with vegetables dish and it was very good as well. It was a lot of chicken, almost a whole half of a chicken but it  was seasoned so well, I ate most of it.  Yummy! By this time, it was past 4 so we moved the party to the upstairs patio with the remainder of our 2nd bottle of wine.  Also by this time, our waitress came around and was quite the nice lady!  The patio was NICE, the view of downtown was spectacular and the set up of the patio was incredible.  We were seated closest to the part of roof where you can over look the sidewalk and I deemed it the best seat in the house.  Our server came up right away and was hands down the funniest man I've ever met.  He was hilarious.  Not only did we make friends with him but almost everyone upstairs.  The bus boys, severs, rooftop owner, even some customers... all thanks to wine bottle #3.   I'm not really sure what I ate at the rooftop but it tasted like flan, it was some greek word that sounds like ""Colossal Booty Call""  So we called it that all night... day... I mean afternoon. After 3 bottles of wine and a strange business card from the JayMan (don't ask), we decided to leave and head to Orbit Room.   Pegasus was awesome!

My wife ordered something on the menu and it was not how the menu described it. we sent it back due to her dietary restrictions. The waiter rolled his eyes at us and took her new order. When the bill came they had charged us for both the new dish and the dish that we did not eat due to a bad description. Thinking this was just his mistake as he was rushing us through the whole experience I pointed it out to him. He said they can not take it off the bill, because he would have to pay for it. I asked to speak to the manager. To which he came back a minute later with the item taken off of the bill. I still demanded to speak to the manager. At this point the owner came over a very nice man named Caesar. Caesar tried his best to apologize for the waiters rudeness, but he did admit to the management telling the waiters they will have to pay for any messed up orders. He followed by saying he rarely does this but this is what he tells the waiters. Being in the service industry I find it very insulting when managers threaten the Waite staff. Mistakes happen and that is part of being a business owner. This was not a 40 dollar stake but a 4 dollar fried calamari. He went on to say that when mistakes like this happen the restaurant goes ahead and returns the dish but charges the customer the greater of the two dishes. He continued to apologize for the waiters rudeness and blamed it on the fact that he had 4 other tables with parties of 6 or more and he probably wasn't as concerned with a mere table of two. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? This is what was actually said to  me. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. The next time I go to Greek town I will visit a restaurant that will take good care of me no matter how many people are in my party.

2009-01-14,4.0,"Pegasus is probably the best Greek restaurant in Greektown Chicago. They have great food, good drinks, and a wonderful rooftop. I wish dining were available on their rooftop, but it's only for appetizers and drinks. Pegasus has a Greek pasta dish, made with orzo, bechamel sauce, cheese and shrimp that's to die for (I forget the name). Their fish dishes can be a little on the pricey side, but are totally worth it. The flavors are so simple (olive oil, salt, pepper, garlic and herbs) that it doesn't mask the real flavor of the fish. Be aware of the market prices though...sometimes their specials are at market price, and can end up cost almost $30-40 for the one dish. And of course, you have to get an order of the saganaki!

2008-10-24,2.0,"The ONLY reason I'm giving Pegasus 2 stars instead of 1 is because I've had enjoyable visits in the distant past. However, due to a recent encounter with the host, they have forever lost my business. I chose this restaurant for my family birthday dinner because I was craving Greek food and my father had brought me here many times as a teen. Due to my family's proximity to the city, we required a later reservation and I was assured that they would accommodate our entire party if they arrived within a 30 minute window of our reserved period due to the amount of people coming separately and from a distance. Anyone that has organized a group of guests knows that occasionally things do get mixed up - especially when older people are involved. When my boyfriend and I arrived, I was under the impression (from a phone call) that two of my guests were already in the dining room. The exchange went as follows: Me:      Hi, I have a reservation for L***** and I believe a few of us have already been seated. Host:   No, your guests are not here. What time did I tell you to be here? Me:       We were told it would be fine if we arrived between 10 and 10:30. (It was 10:05) Host:   No one is here. It's after 10. I told you to be here at 10. Me:       Can I look in the dining room? I just received a call saying that they had just been seated. Maybe they didn't know I had a reservation. Host:    No, and we are not serving you. To be fair, the mistake was on my guests' part. They had gone to The Parthenon instead. However, the host refused to honor the window of time allowed on our reservation and his candor was completely rude. His tone of voice was completely condescending as he stood cross armed and angry at people ready to patronize his establishment. We ended up moving the party down the street to The Parthenon where the entire group was served without a reservation.  Part of the appeal of Greektown is the friendliness of the staff within their dining establishments. I have never felt anything less than overwhelmed with hospitality at any of the restaurants on that strip of Halsted. To have the converse displayed was a stark contrast to the big friendly dinner I was expecting.

It's important to know that the rooftop deck serves only appetizers, so if you're hankering for a pastitsio or moussaka, this ain't the place to get it.  But you can make a hearty meal the small plates, trust me!  And it's a great way to try lots of different stuff.

Walking through the traditional restaurant, you would never guess that there's a rooftop looking out to the city as well as some residences. On a hot, steamy summer night, this place is perfect for a beer garden with a covered bar and lots of seating. There's also a great view of a Greek DirecTV ad where the bearded man watches you drink and promotes the service; very Greek Big Brother. The servers were excellent and really hot. Seriously, the tall blonde server is lustworthy. When I got there, I grabbed a spot and met Linda and Count Gregula and we got some beers right away. Since it's an appetizer menu on the veranda, we split the saganaki. I got a plate of spankopita. I thought that the saganaki was okay (no flame action), but liked my fried pillows of spinach and feta. The prices seemed a little high especially with a filled deck. I'm surprised that they don't do a happy hour special with those appetizers. After the food, I mingled with all of my Yelpers who I haven't met before, just met, or hadn't seen in a while.

But unfortunately, I was disappointed. Things started out really well. I made a reservation on Wednesday for sixteen people, thinking that there was no way they would be able to accomodate us a mere three days later. But the gentleman who took my reservation was happy to book us. We got to the restaurant and our table was located in the very back, so it was nice and private. We all noted how quiet the restaurant was, even though most of the tables were full. Luckily we had already ordered our first round of drinks at the bar, since our waiter did not show up for at least 15 minutes of our being seated. He came by, said hello, and then disappeared again. 20-25 minutes later we flagged him down so that we could order our appetizers. He more or less made the decisions for us, which was nice but it was in a kind of smarmy sales-y way. Either way, we said fine, just bring whatever you think we should have in whatever quantity you recommend. The appetizers came out very quickly, and they were pretty standard. But it turned out that our waiter overestimated our appetites, because we nowhere near finished the apps. Then it was at least another 20 minutes until he took our food order. Again, we had to flag him down. He only had two other 4-tops from what I saw, so I don't think the guy was that busy. We wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt and think that he just didn't want to rush our party, but I don't really think that was the case. For my entree, I had the lamb special. It was lamb on the bone in a creamy dill gravy with artichokes and carrots. The sauce was good, but the lamb meat was tough and overcooked. I ate less than half of the dish. Everyone else at the table agreed--the food was okay, but nobody was jumping up and down over it. For dessert, we ordered a bunch of things and passed them around the table. I sampled the baklava (awesome), chocolate mousse cake (awesome) and galaktoboureko (mediocre). The galatkoboureko was the only dessert at the table that was not completely polished off. A few of us had cups of coffee, and then visited while we waited for the check. Right before we left, I witnessed a little blowout between our waiter and a man who appeared to be the owner/manager. They did it out on the floor right in front of the kitchen, which seemed really unprofessional and uncomfortable but luckily for them no one else really seemed to notice. While I appreciate the fact that they did not hurry our party, the 3 1/2 hour meal was a little bit too slow for us. And the food was mediocre at best.

2007-08-13,4.0,"I went with a large group of 13 people and sat on the rooftop deck, which had a view every bit as good as advertised.  It turns out that they only serve drinks and appetizers on the deck, which was a little bit off-putting at first, but this can easily be turned to one's advantage for a tapas-style dining experience.  For one thing, the appetizers menu is very broad, featuring perhaps 30 or 40 selections, including all the staples that you might expect at a Greek Restaurant (from a marketing standpoint, they'd probably do better to call them ""small plates"").  More importantly, a lot of the small plates are very good on balance.  Although there were a few ""misses"" like the squid, and the food can range toward the salty side (probably an intrinsic characteristic of Greek cuisine), several dishes were outstanding such as the spicy lamb sausage, the zucchini, the very crabby crab-cakes, and the chicken wings.  The portions are reasonably large and you can really fill yourself up for perhaps $15 per person. The service was not without its bumps.  As with other Greektown restaurants, the attitude can veer from overfriendly one moment to standoffish the next.  One item came very late, and they were out of the spanakopita but didn't inform us until well after the food had been ordered.   Still, I give a *lot* of wiggle room to any place trying to accommodate a 13-seat table.  With the exception mentioned above, the food generally came out of the kitchen very quickly while it was still hot and delectable.   I've probably had more bad experiences in Greektown than good -- a lot of the restaurants are dangerously close to being tourist traps -- but Pegasus is one that I would recommend.",0.9865,0.837,0.134,0.029,0.4978112244897958

I know, we stuck with water, didn't order drinks, or an appetizer, desserts or coffee and I know that restaurants prefer big spenders. He just seemed to really convey that...and then we used my NPR card and got one of the meals for free...he made a little comment. I just didn't feel great after leaving here. I certainly wasn't expecting ingratiating service, we didn't ask for anything extra, (except my friend who asked for help deciding what to order), and we didn't tie up the table for a long time by lingering and we left a decent tip. I guess I just feel that the waiter conveyed his disappointment that we weren't going to be a big spending table...

They offer well-known Greek favorites like mousakas, panakopita and gyros, of course, but they also traditional Greek foods like kotopoulo fournou and neframia. A friend of mine who spent a few months in Greece with a theatre company was delighted to find that Pegasus carried retsina, a Greek wine. Let me state up front that retsina is for the daring of palate - it has a very unique flavor that is obtained from pine resin; it is definitely an acquired taste, although not bad. The food here is great and I always find it relaxing. The best thing here is the rooftop dining area, which is open usually from Memorial Day through Labor Day, and which offers a great view of the Loop area. To make the rooftop dining area even more fun, they have a live Greek band there. (not sure how often - call ahead for details).
