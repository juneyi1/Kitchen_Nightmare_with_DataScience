2017-09-03,4.0,We tried this deep dish pizza place for the first time. We got there on Saturday so it was 45 minutes wait. The restaurant was packed. We got the Lou which was okay. Honestly I have had better deep dish in Nashville. Also the pizza took another 45 minutes to arrive. I give it 4 out of 5 because of the friendliness of the staff.,0.8689,0.841,0.159,0.0,0.5055555555555555

When you get there, check in with the hostess and they will text you a link to check your position in line.  Be sure to go to the counter next door to put in your pizza order since deep dish pizzas take about 30-45 mins to cook.  In the meantime you could order a drink and drink it outside while you're waiting for a table",0.9413,0.854,0.146,0.0,0.4376543209876543

2017-09-01,3.0,I ordered the Chicago style pizza and added pepperoni. It was pretty good. Not sure if it was worth the money or the 45min wait.

I get they were busy but there were quite a few people waiting much longer than told. If I order take out again I'll definitely give myself a little more time.

We came here on a Saturday at 1pm, so of course we knew we'd hit the lunchtime rush. We were told it would be a 25-35 minute wait, ended up being only 20. The nice part is you can get your pizza started on, it takes 35 minutes for them to make it. So you can order right at the counter while you wait. VERY convenient!  When we were seated, our waitress was very kind and attentive. Brought us our drinks, and then once the pizzas got there offered to serve us each the slice we wanted. We ordered a classic cheese deep dish and a medium thin crust, half cheese half toppings. The deep dish was AMAZING. Of course, this is our first time trying authentic Chicago deep dish, but really it was VERY good. The crust was thick, but scrumptious. The sauce wasn't too sweet, and the thick amount of cheese was just incredible. We absolutely loved it. Not one complaint. The thin crust was okay, not anything different than what we've had at other pizzerias, but again great sauce, fresh toppings, overall great taste.

There were three of us and we ordered a personal Lou's (no meat, cheese and veggies) and then a small Chicago that had sausage and cheese. The crust is to die for, very buttery and crispy even though a deep dish. Tomato sauce is really good and the Italian sausage was sweet and perfectly seasoned. Lots of cheese on both. We also thought the calamari was very good and it came out quickly and was hot and crispy. Only thing that keeps this location from being a 5 is ambiance. It's just a really busy place with more of an ""Italian Denny's feel"" but we were ok with it.

We had a group of four and wanted to try the two and probably would've been better off with two mediums. (Or one large could easily feed party of 4-6.) The Lou was definitely my favorite. It was soooooo good. The crust was yummy and it was full of sauce, cheese, and flavor. The Lou's had much more flavor than the pepperonis.

Since this place is pretty much always busy, my friends and I opted for take-out and have the pizza in our hotel instead. We had the Malnati Chicago Classic, which comes with butter crust. Regardless of what you're ordering, get the butter crust. It's delicious and addicting at the same time. The pizza was ready in about 45 minutes; not bad considering it's deep dish and it was insanely busy on a Saturday night. Needless to say the pizza was one of the best I've had. The only small issue I had was that it was a bit soggier than expected, though that might be due to the fact I had take-out instead of ordering in. The tomatoes were ripe and fresh, definitely not canned at all. The sausages were delicious and lean at the same time. Finally the cheese...lots of it. Stretchy. Yummy at the same time.

2017-08-07,4.0,"4.5 stars Anyone who's grown up in the Chicagoland area has his/her own preference deep dish... and while I haven't managed to pick my No. 1, Lou Malnati's is certainly a top contender. Sure, they're a chain and now have locations all around the area but that hasn't led to a decline in the quality of their food or flavors. To be honest, I've only ever ordered pizza and MAYBE an appetizer or two. But come on, if I'm going to Lou Malnati's, I'm going to for pizza.  While you can definitely pick your own toppings, I like to stick with the Chicago Classic sausage deep dish and the ""Lou"", a vegetarian deep dish. In the Chicago Classic pizza, the sausage is really slabs of lean meat opposed to ground sausage since it's nestled under your sauce and gooey cheese. While the sauce and buttercrust are already great, for a little kick, I do always add red pepper flakes. Not needed by any means but I find that it does help to enhance the experience some more... and I'm not normally a red pepper flakes kind of person. The buttercrust doesn't get the rise of a typical pizza dough and is more dense. I find this gets soggy less quickly and is a better vehicle for this style of pizza. As for the ""Lou"", this is also a pretty classic mix of mushroom, spinach, and tomatoes. The two pizzas are quite different in flavor profile and even though the veggie pizza is pretty substantial, it tastes much lighter compared to the Classic. Sometimes when you have a veggie pizza, you can feel like you're missing out on flavors but I've never felt that way with the ""Lou"". For a group of 6, we preordered a large and a small, waited 20 min for a table and our pizzas came out 15 min later. So even if there's a long wait for a table (depending on location), be sure to put in your pizza order in advance because it really helps to save the wait once you're seated.",0.9944,0.836,0.152,0.012,0.4794508794508794

Our kids don't like sausage, so our server hooked us up and rushed out another pizza, not charging us for the classic. So we had a whole pizza to take with us! And the pizza was soooooo good.

Didn't mind the long wait since this was touted as the place to go for Chicago pizza. I loved that we were able to order our pizza while we waited. Ordered appetizers to go as well, so we were able to eat our appetizers while we were waiting for a table. Once seated, we thought our pizza would be ready in 5-10 min. We both ordered personal sizes of the ""Lou,"" so we figured it shouldn't take long. We were seated after about 30 minutes and the pizza was supposedly going to take 35 minutes. After waiting at the table an additional 20-30 min, I went to check on it and was told the waiter would bring it out. Went back to the table and after waiting for the waiter, inquired about the pizza. Another 5-10 min and suddenly our pizzas appeared. Now, the pizzas were good. The crust is crispy and buttery, cheese has a nice crust to it, and the sauce and toppings were a nice ratio. Never heard any apologies about why it took so long. By this time, we'd been there for almost an hour and a half, including the wait. The wait, combined with the attitude and rude comments I overheard from the waitstaff, are enough to ensure I won't be back.

The pizza took about 30 minutes to make, which gave me plenty of time to get ready and walk over. I ordered a personal pizza, which was about 8"" wide, with onions and green peppers inside. I will say, the pizza is baseline kind of expensive and then the extra price for toppings is steep, but for a special treat it's definitely worth it.

It might not be the most convenient place to just suddenly drop by, because of the wait time, but, their sauce, crust, and flavor is great! So, it's no wonder everyone goes here. Customer service could use a little brushing up, but this is a small point. Much of the front staff is very young. It would also be nice if somehow they could figure out a better waiting area or have a bar, but because space is probably limited, this might be tough. In general, however, we've always enjoyed their great pizzas, especially their deep dish.

2017-07-20,1.0,"I wish I were exaggerating when I say that I had trouble even swallowing my meal, gagging at the flavor and texture. I love Chicago stuffed pizza, and I wanted to branch out after eating now countless slices of my #1 go-to, Giordano's -- my favorite aspect is hands down their chewy, flaky, buttery crust, followed by the slightly zesty but mild tomato sauce, and of course the thick layer of cheese. Most other places I've tried (such as J.B. Alberto's) achieve that same basic taste, but fall short of the buttery taste in the crust, or their sauce is insipid, too smooth. But Lou Malnotti's isn't even close; it lacks every aspect I enjoy in deep dish. Though I paid the extra charge for their so-called butter crust on my pizza for one, what I bit into was a cracker (nowhere near thick enough, not even capable of flakiness or chewiness) that's only discernible flavor was reminiscent of cardboard with a lingering taste of grease -- which also felt terrible to chew, and the more I did so, the harder it became to swallow. The sauce and cheese were similarly flavorless, or at least whatever flavor they possessed was overpowered by the greasy cardboard taste. Had I been anything less than famished from having skipped lunch, I wouldn't have forced down more than my initial slice, and even as hungry as I was, I couldn't finish what was a modestly sized personal pie. I suppose I'm thankful for the experience, because now I can go back to enjoying my Giordano's secure in the knowledge that I find it vastly preferable to the other big names, but that silver lining still only earns this one star.",0.9273,0.861,0.091,0.048,0.43397932816537477

Their pizza is simply the best.  There are a couple things that Lou Malnati's so great and unique. Firstly, their pizza is awesome and they know it. How do they account for alllll of the people who want it? Multiple ways!  1) They have 48 locations in Chicago (2 new in Phoenix, AZ!)  2) They offer online ordering (in case you don't want to wait in line) 3) They offer catering, in case you want to please a whole bunch of people without the fuss of leaving your own home 4) Most incredibly: they allow you to SHIP A PIZZA. To anywhere nationwide! Have you ever thought while eating, ""hey I wish so-and-so could try this but they live somewhere else"" (I have), because now you can FIX THAT. And they offer deals based on how many your order! It's a slam dunk. Company aside, this restaurant location is one of the most fun ones in Chicago. It's in the middle of everything, and close to a bunch of bars and clubs so when you're done eating you can go out on the town (if you're up to it, I was pretty full).  I came with a group of about 20 people and we ended up having to wait a few hours. It was not ideal, but we knew what we were getting into. After finally being able to get seated the staff was so nice to us regardless of the size of our group. Everybody ordered apps, everybody ordered drinks, and they didn't seemed stressed at all. We ordered 4 deep dish pizzas to share and even that was a lot. Regardless of what type you get, it will be delicious and you will want to eat until you regret it. We got cheese, sausage, pepperoni, and the ""Malnati Chicago classic"" and I have zero complaints about all four. If you want to know what eating their pizza is like, it's like taking a bit of a memory foam mattress covered in cheese (in a great way). I wanted to have this pizza as my new pillow.  The only issue we had was we had a friend in our group who was lactose intolerant. We asked for one of the pizzas to be without cheese, but in the time it took them to cook the pizzas (~40 more min) they had forgotten and there wasn't anything for her to eat. The staff was extremely apologetic but it was a little awkward because since it takes so long to cook the pizza, she just had to scrape it off one of her slices.

Giordano's had a more old-school, homey Italian feel to it in terms of decor, while Lou Malnati's was a bit more modern. We came in at prime Saturday lunch time, and the wait was only about 15 minutes. They took our order at the counter while we waited so that they can get started on cooking our pizzas, which I thought was really smart.  My boyfriend and I ordered a personal ""Malnati Chicago Classic"" (sausage and tomato) and a personal ""The Lou"" (spinach, mushrooms, and tomato). Of the 2, I liked the overall flavors of the ""The Lou"" more. However, the ""Malnati Chicago Classic"" is made with a butter crust which made it more crispy, buttery, and therefore, better in that sense. This was my first time trying deep dish pizza ever, and what I most enjoyed about it is the how the cheese oozes out in between the layers of topping and crust, and is super stringy and, for lack of better words, more cheesy than regular flat pizza.

If you like fried food, they were fresh made and a nice alternative to mozzarella sticks to try something different. I also ordered a glass of Cabernet. The pour was large for $8 and it was a decent restaurant wine for the price. Our pizza still took some time to arrive even with preordering. It was delicious. The crust was buttery and crispy almost like a cookie on the bottom. The cheese was obviously quality. The sausage over the top tasted like it was made there and the same with the tomato sauce.

It took us forever to get seated -- you need half your party there before they'll seat you, and some of our crew was running late. One of our crew had to leave kind of quickly to catch a show, so we were able to order a pizza before we were seated. Unfortunately, even with the head start the pizza didn't come out for 75 minutes (!!) so our pal had to leave hungry. The pizza was pretty delicious. We had a family size salad as well, which was huge! One large pizza and a one salad was more than enough for our table of five-minus-one. The manager did end up comping our food, so I'm not too upset about having had to wait. I think in the future I'd come back here for the pizza, but I would likely order takeout and eat it in a park or at the beach or something.",0.7946,0.905,0.072,0.023,0.6163492063492063

2017-06-14,4.0,"***4-4.5 stars*** I only tried 2 deep dish pizza places during my time in Chicago. Lou Malnati's was the first. This location was right next to our hotel, so we conveniently walked over for lunch on a Wednesday (6/7/17). For those that aren't familiar, Lou Malnati's is one of the most popular deep dish pizzerias in all of Chicago. They have been around for a long time. The place that everyone talks and raves about. Fair to say, I had pretty big expectations walking in. I ordered a small cheese deep dish pizza, priced at $12.55. Their deep dish pizzas take about 30-40 minutes to cook, so be prepared to wait a little. It's worth it. Every pizza here is hand made from scratch with high quality ingredients. Service was good for the most part. No real complaints. Our server was pretty attentive throughout the meal. The menu was straight forward, and ordering was not an issue. The restaurant wasn't crowded, which was nice. I was expecting it to be packed. The pizza here was really good. I enjoyed their pizza considerably more than Giordano's, and definitely thought it was better. I liked the dough, and the sauce was superb. The pizza was cooked really well. I also liked that this pizza wasn't overly cheesy. It had the right mix and ratio of ingredients. All in all, this place met expectations, but didn't quite exceed them. I thought the pizza was delicious, but it didn't blow me away. I would definitely come back here again, but am curious to try other places next time I visit Chicago. For the price, Lou Malnati's does provide a pretty good value. I was stuffed. The pizzas here are definitely quality.

We also ordered the sampler which came with mozzarella sticks, cheese balls, fried zucchini, and fried mushrooms.

2017-06-13,4.0,"How can you go to Chicago without getting a deep dish pizza? The debate of the best deep dish seems to be between Giordiano and Lou Malnati's. While I cannot say if Giordano is better or worse, I can confirm that Lou's pizza lives up its delicious fame! Before I sat down, I was impressed with the restaurant's efficient ordering system. Waiting is expected in one of the most popular chains for the city's most iconic food, but Lou Malnati's turned this disadvantage into a method to counter deep dish pizza's notoriously long preparation time. Instead of having you wait for your seat and then wait again for your food, Lou Malnati's allows you to order before you wait so your pizza will arrive shortly after you are seated! This restaurant also uses a texting system so you are not forced to squeeze with fellow patrons in the lobby to secure your spot in the line. Restaurants everywhere should do this! Now the pizza itself was as great as reputed! Initially, I was stunned by how tiny the Lou's Classic personal pizza was, because it was almost as small as a large quiche, but as I dig in, I got over the small size for two reasons: 1) The pizza was simply delicious! The sausages were flavorful without being too salty and complemented well with the zesty cheese and the tangy tomato sauce. The crispy buttercrust was also delicious on its own! 2) Surprisingly, the personal pizza filled me up despite its size! Perhaps the small pizza was really packed. Anyway, if you are in Chicago as a visitor, do yourself a favor and get a deep dish pizza. This place's deep dish pizza will make you understand why it is such an iconic dish! Ugh, just typing about this is making me want to return to Chicago... --- tl;dr version: 1) One of Chicago's most famous deep dish chains 2) Efficient ordering and waiting system 3) Small but filling pizza that is famously delicious!",0.9926,0.809,0.159,0.032,0.524049464747139

2017-06-12,5.0,"As a Chicago girl through and through, it's basically in my DNA to love Lou Malnati's. Oh wait, no. It's part of being a human. Lou's rocks. No debate. I grew up going to the Buffalo Grove location and although the food is consistent at all Lou Malnati's, this is why the South Loop Lou's deserves all 5 stars... When you go to Lou's, you have to be hungry. The pizza is super filling. However, going to a restaurant when you're hungry and ordering a pizza that could take 30-45 minutes to bake is not always the best combination. Luckily, I typically call ahead my pizza. This is a pro tip that reduces your wait time for both a table and your pizza. This time around, however, my trip to Lou's was impromptu. My friends and I were so hangry that we didn't think to call ahead our pizza. We were more focused on getting to Lou's. When we walked in on a Sunday at 3:00pm, there was a 15-20 minute wait which is basically 30 seconds in Lou's time. Usually the wait is much longer. The highlight of waiting was that they place your pizza order when you put your name down on the waitlist for a table. This is pure genius! I've never seen this at a Lou's before! Maybe it's because I usually call ahead but it also could just have everything to do with brilliant efficiency at this particular location. Either way, I was so happy about this. The house salad never disappoints. I could eat the sweet vinaigrette dressing with everything. Lou's also happens to have the best ranch dressing. The real MVP of the house salad would have to be the croutons. They are buttery. They are flavorful. They are perfect. The pizza is obviously amazing. I do not eat Lou Malnati's as often as I should, it is always a treat to eat the pizza fresh out of the oven. I think Lou's is drastically different when delivered, carried out and fresh. Fresh is undoubtedly the best.  The service at this location was really great. Our server was awesome and very attentive.

I am not so sure; maybe another restaurant. The calamari that we ordered was good though. Otherwise, it was a good experience.

Incredibly for pizza, mine was under-seasoned. Perhaps because mine was vegetarian, if you get pepperoni or some salty meat, it might be better. Portions are OK. The personal size is small (but dense and rich) and an OK meal for one. But the nightmare is the wait and organisation. There was a crowd of about 100 people packing the sidewalk and the entrance to the restaurant, with no formal queue system and no signs to direct you where to go. Some are waiting to pre-order, some to collect, some to be seated. The staff laughed because I was the third person in a row to ask about my collection in the wrong place...a clue that maybe some signs would help. If you order online and push to the front the wait isn't actually that bad, but the process is a shambles. Roped queuing lines, a number system - anything would improve the situation.

The first bite set the tone to a great lunch. I made it thru 80% when my stomached said 'no more',  This is a nice spot. Not a large restaurant by seating counts, but the food is worth a visit.

I think their deep dish (and possibly their thin crust) has actually improved over the years. I've had an occasional inconsistency, but generally if you specify exactly what you want when you order (such as extra cheese, thicker crust, a little more crispy, etc.) they deliver the results. Salads are also great.

Can you believe they even have a ""ship a pizza"" option?!?!?!? I almost want to order a couple of their deep dish pizzas right now and have them deliver it straight to my door in Cali.  THE PIZZA: Our group got a pepperoni and sausage pizza. It took about 40 minutes to make  because they handmade it from scratch. The texture was perfect to my liking. It was thick like a true Chicago style, but not overly thick and crusty. The crust was flaky and buttery and the cheese was soft and gooey. The sausage and pepperoni were wonderful additions as well. At other places, I found that pizzas may be a little heavy on the crust or the cheese that it overpowers the toppings that you put on. That was not the case here as all the ingredients blended together nicely. THE WINGS: Stunning. Chicago is known mainly for their pizza, but while less decorated, the wings in this city deserve some accolades of their own as well. I had some of the best buffalo wings of my life here at Lou Malnati's. The tastiness of these wings were unparalleled.  BEER: They have a bunch of awesome craft beers. It was our last night in Chicago so we decided to get 3 pitchers of beer and chug them to see who can gulp down a pint the fast LMAO. Twas' a good time indeed.  SERVICE: The staff was nice and attentive. They were very knowledgeable and the waiter came over to us and told us the approximate minutes it would take our pizza to come out throughout our wait.  Overall, Lou Malnati's hits on all cylinders and is a must-try in the great city of Chicago.",0.9968,0.786,0.196,0.018,0.5898869648869649

I tried the sausage and cheese and there was sausage in every bite. I'm a crust person so I was a bit disappointed that the crust was rather flavorless.

Maybe it was because of all the hype, or maybe it was because we made the mistake of trying Giordano's stuffed pizza first, or maybe it was because the pizza here just wasn't THAT amazing. With only three and a half short days in Chicago, and most of those days packed, we made the executive decision to visit this restaurant on our last day instead of going to the Navy Pier. We figured that with all the hype, it would be worse to miss out on Lou's pizza but in retrospect, I think the pier would have been the better choice (don't judge..sometimes food beats all else, especially when it's supposed to be otherworldly).  We came over at 11:40, and were soooo excited to order. We each got a personal pizza and some drinks along with starters and anxiously awaited. As soon as our pizzas came out, we were disappointed. They looked....tired if that makes any sense. Depressing maybe is the better word. Nonetheless, we dug in, and were quickly disappointed by the lack of emotion we felt (at Giordano's we were practically dying of joy with every bite and were praying that the moment would never end).  We were so unimpressed, that we didn't finish our food and didn't dare to order dessert. We just paid and left as quickly as possible, unimpressed that we gave up a local 'attraction' for this. We got amazing dessert elsewhere (another review coming soon) and left the memory of this sad pizza behind. Could it have been bad luck? Maybe. Or maybe we had the better pizza first and had we not, maybe we would have loved this one. Who knows.

It wasn't until we contacted Grub Hub that our food was delivered within 5 minutes (we live 3 blocks from the restaurant).

2016-12-17,3.0,"As history goes the Chicago deep dish pizza was created at Pizzeria Uno in the 1940's. The man running the kitchen at the time was Rudy Malnati who continued to do so until he died. Lou Malnati also worked with his dad and left to start Lou Malnati's Pizzeria. Lou's half brother Rudy Jr. started Pizano's and Pizzeria Uno's former cook Alice May Redmond went to work for Gino's and supposedly perfected the crust there. The long and the short of it is there's a lot of deep dish pizza joints in Chicago that claim to have had a hand in it's creation. I considered going to Uno or Due in Chicago but was put off by the revues reporting that it was nothing more than a tourist trap with dubious quality. It seemed Lou Malnati's would be my best chance at getting a Chicago style deep dish pizza. I ordered the personal Chicago Deep Dish Classic, the name which is trademarked. It comes with Lou's lean sausage, some extra cheese and vine-ripened tomato sauce on Buttercrust (also trademarked). Seems there's a lot of trademarking going on. I'm not from Chicago but I loved eating at Kylie's Chicago Pizza in Seattle and I've eaten Windy City Pie (Pequod pizza clone) as well as Delfino's so they're my only frame of reference.  My first impression of my pizza was that the tomatoes were bright and fresh just like Kylie's. The sausage was... just sausage and the cheese was as you'd expect. I came to Lou Malnati's though because of the famous Buttercrust (again, trademarked!).  My impression of Lou Malnati's started to take a nose dive with the crust. My lasting memory of the crust was that it was impacted. Like someone had smashed a disk of pastry dough into a form and cooked it. It wasn't difficult to chew in the way a high gluten dough would be but rather because it was so hard and dense. I think the crust was the biggest downfall of Lou's Chicago Pizza. Really to be honest the only thing I thought was above average about it was the tomatoes. Maybe my expectations were too high. They say the best Cuban food isn't in Cuba. Maybe the best Chicago Pizza isn't in Chicago.  I'm headed to Giordano's later in the week so we'll see how they fare. I did get a nice dark Oatmeal Stout to go with it though so there is that.",0.995,0.827,0.148,0.025,0.4475238095238095

They were so buttery and flaky and paired with the fresh tomato sauce and stringy mozzarella cheese it was a match made in heaven. The proportions of the ingredients were great so one never overpowered another. Getting the bread was a great choice since the pizza takes 25-30 mins to come out.

I ordered ""The Lou"" which had Spinach mix, mushrooms and sliced roma tomatoes covered with a blend of mozzarella, romano and cheddar cheese on garlic Buttercrust. So good! It was very flavorful that's for sure. You can choose from personal pans, to small pan, medium pan, to large pan.  Here are the prices: Personal Pan (serves 1)- $9.75 Small (serves 2)- $15.35 Medium (serves 3) $19.95 Large (serves 4)- $24.55 There were some other choices as well like cheese pizza, sausage or pepperoni and cheese, The Malnati Chicago Classic which had Lou's made sausage, cheese, vine ripened tomato sauce on top of a buttercrust, and also for those health conscience people on a low carb diet the ""Crustless"" pizza which is made with a sausage base, mozzarella, and vine ripened tomatoes. Prices all vary, and I have only included the prices for the type of pizza that ordered and ate.  The server who helped us was very friendly and made some suggestions of what is popular as for their deep dish pizza selections. The menu was pretty extensive too. There were appetizers, salads, soups, pastas, sandwiches, and pizza. So many things to choose from, but since I have been trying to watch my food intake, I decided to just do the deep dish pizza since that is what Chicago is known for! I highly enjoyed my pizza. It came out on a hot pan and the waitress served our first slice to us. The pizza orders take about 30 mins from the time you order, but if you are a first timer and let the waiter or waitress know, they will give you a heads up about that.

I'm sure people associated Beyonce and other big-named artists with the pizza when they talk about the illuminati. Well friends, it's Lou Malnati's pizza that will give you the best touristy food experience. Out of all the major pizza chains, Lou reigns on top for me for one reason- the crust. It's not oily nor flaky, but perfectly baked, buttery, and delicious. Their secret seems to be well kept because other deep dish joints have not done their crust as good as Lou's. Each time I've brought visitors here, we always order the Chicago Classic, which contains sausage, cheese, and tomatoes. While the sauce is not as present in their pizza, it's still baked perfectly into each large slice and makes for one hearty meal. The layers and layers of cheese on top also give it a nicely needed kick of HELL YES. If you simply want to try the pizza, a personal size will do for even a party of four. These slices are large so do not underestimate the power of deep dish portions! So please come and check out Lou's for a great deep dish pizza. Mind you that lines get long and you may end up waiting up to an hour for a table during a dinner rush. You'll be able to order your pizza in advance so that it is delivered within ten minutes of you being seated after waiting nearly an hour for the table itself.

Being a Texan, I was skeptical seeing just how many pizza joints we passed by to get to this place. I was thinking this BETTA be good. Also side note: I really thought my Chicago native friend was saying, ""Illuminati's"" so naturally I had all these conspiracy theories in my head. We went in on a Monday evening around 9pm with a party of 6. Guess what? NO wait! But really though no one probably eats something as heavy as a deep dish that late lol. We put in our orders and then had to wait - the only semibad part. All of the pizza is MTO, so as expected it takes a while to pop these out.  Now for the flavor. Woah! We ordered the Lou, which was the perfect mix of spinach, cheese, and sauce. It had strong oregano, garlic and black pepper flavors. Definitely NOT bland. One thing they have right is the ingredient proportions!!! This pizza has more cheese than anything else - exactly what a pizza should be!!!!

Ya, ya I knowww you're ""supposed"" to eat this with a knife and fork and probably should but I was wayyy too eager and hungry to care - picked it right up no shame once it got to a more reasonable size.

2016-10-31,1.0,"It was my first time in Chicago so my mindset for lunch was to eat some Chicago Deep Dish pizza! I was starving by the time I entered around 12:30pm to get a table on a Saturday. By that time we were told our party of 4 was going to have to wait about 30 minutes, but we would be texted when our table was ready. We could order appetizers ahead of time, but the pizza would be ordered when we were seated. We saw people who came after us being seated before us. When the waitress finally came back to us over 40 minutes wait time, she apologized and did say we did have a ""large party"". I did not think 4 seats counted as a large party (a regular square table seats four people!). We ordered the spinach salad with chicken on the side, brushetta and a pie of the Lou deep dish pizza. Everyone except one person had experienced dining at Lou Malnati's previously. Bruschetta was good; bread was toasted well with a good crunch and tomatoes and basil were flavorful. The salad tasted like a tug of war on my taste buds. It was too tart from the balsamic vinaigrette. Yes, I do realize balsamic vinaigrette is sour but this was like having an attack on the taste buds every time you ate a forkful. Also the spinach leaves were left whole so the whole thing was difficult to eat without it hitting the side of your mouth and splattering the vinaigrette on your cheeks. The goat cheese was tossed in and it too begged for your attention as soon as you tasted it. The flavors of the salad were all doing their own thing instead of complimenting each other like a good dish does. The waitress came and served us each a slice of pizza from the pie. This pizza was like a heavy brick of dough with topping cooked onto it. The crust did not have any taste; it wasn't chewy, flaky or appetizing at all. It was a like a thick pie crust at the bottom of the pizza, like a nice wall of cement at the bottom. It had the aroma of a dough that had risen too much (that yeast smell). This pizza does not have any sauce on it, which may have hindered the overall experience. My friend had tried the cheese deep dish previously and she even said that was not that great either. Even the extra oregano and parmesan I had sprinkled on top did not help that much. We picked this pizzeria due to its location and high yelp rating, but overall I think it was a big let down. It has turned me off towards Chicago style pizza for now. We didn't finish our pizza so we packed up the rest to go. You know how some leftovers taste better the day after? Well the Lou Deep Dish did not taste better after.  Every time we walked past this place it was packed, but I still do not know why.

I ordered pizza from this place for the first time a couple weeks ago, ordering a medium deep dish half-pepperoni (for a friend) and half-greenpepper (for me, a vegetarian). I was disappointed with the pizza because their was pepperoni baked into the pizza on my side, so I had to throw away most of my pizza. I wrote a message to the store letting them know about the situation and if they could be more careful next time.

I order the Stuffed Spinach bread (a perfection of spinach blend with cheese and herbs stuffed inside a soft and crunchy bread outside and dip with a marinara sauce on the side) the cheese is chewy where u can pull out a long string for it. When u see that you will know this is a good pizza place.  I also order the personal size Malnati Chicago Classic deep dish pizza. The crush is crunchy with the perfect thickness of the bread topped with ripened tomato sauce blend with the flavorful sausage.

The pizza was very good, definitely better than Giordano's and Gino's East. Of the three, I would definitely rank Lou's the best for stuffed pizza, followed by Giordano's, and then followed by Gino's east.  The crust is very buttery and flakey, and the sauce is chunky and very good.  My only complaint about the pizza is that they never put on enough sauce.  I will order extra sauce the next time I come to Lou's.  The soup was not that good, but I really came for the pizza. The wait staff was nice but not very attentive.  i was not asked once for a drink refill, but I will say they are efficient at cleaning the table when you finish and quickly providing and processing the check - I think they are on a mission to get you in and out as quickly as possible to keep the people moving through since they have lots of customers to serve.  Lastly, as most people know, you can order frozen pizzas to bake at home, which start at $12.55 for the 9"" pies.",0.9933,0.861,0.132,0.008,0.4781421029950441

The butter crust on the pizza was like perfectly baked, and the flavor of the meat came out in every bite. I would definitely come back just for that alone! My only problem with this establishment is that in addition to the wait to get seated, we had to wait another 20-30 min. to get food, and by that time I was already HANGRY. I thought that the point of ordering first was that by the time we got seated, our food would be ready very shortly. Other than that, great food. :)",0.9945,0.776,0.194,0.03,0.5154761904761905

We ordered the buffalo chicken wings as an app, which were very good and saucy. We also ordered a deep dish pizza. I thought the crust was nice and crispy and had a great amount of cheese; however, I feel it did not outdo Giordano's pizza. I wish Lou had more options when trying to pick a pizza and have the pizza be a bit more saucy to match the amount of the cheese.",0.9152,0.877,0.123,0.0,0.7213333333333334
2016-09-01,3.0,"My first Chicago deep dish experience. Unfortunately I haven't had any other deep dish pizzas to compare, but I definitely was not disappointed with our choice. Amazing. So much cheese. Just the right amount of topping. The base was perfectly cooked. We tried both the original and the spinach. I personally preferred the spinach. There just seemed to be more flavour to it. The only downside was the excruciatingly painful wait. This place gets busy. I would recommend trying to hit this place up outside of the busy typical dinner timeframes. Try to visit either later or earlier in the evening, before you end up having to wait hungry for up to an hour. The service was also slow. Although we had pre ordered, we still had to wait almost half an hour at the table for our food to reach us. It was a little disappointing, and felt that staff could have been a bit more proactive in seating people faster. Considering the huge line, there were many tables which would become vacated and waiting to be cleared. Then there was a huge lag between tables being cleared and staff calling the next guests.  Despite the food being fantastic, service contributes majorly to an experience for me, so unfortunately I couldn't quite justify rating the overall visit as high as their potential could have warranted. It's a popular place, but I'm sure there are some other locations which may offer a better all round experience.",0.9823,0.731,0.185,0.084,0.5619675156884458

I was with a group of about a dozen people and we were able to sit once half of us arrived. After that, I never felt like it was a group dining experience in a negative way. Our server was on top of his game getting our orders placed and drinks refilled.  So the pizza... I split the Chicago Classic with three other people. Perfect size. It came out hot in the pan and our server quickly distributed the first slices. The chunky tomato sauce on top was different for sure. I'm not sure if that's my cup of tea, but it was quality. I was excited deeper into the bites hitting the cheese. The sausage was thinly sliced and nicely distributed, not to mention tasty. The buttery, flaky crust was probably my favorite part. We also had a bruschetta for the table, which was as good as any other bruschetta I've ever had. They didn't offer drafts and the bottle selection wasn't too big. I ended up with a Lagunitas Something Something. So the deep dish verdict?

We put our name in and our pizza order in so that it would be ready by the time our name was called for a table. Otherwise you will end up waiting an additional 45+ minutes once you sit down. We had to stand at one of their tables outside and wait because the lobby was PACKED with people so it was hard to even get in and place your order. Get out of the way people! When we were finally seated my Husband ordered a cup of Minestrone Soup to start which he thought was tasty. I ordered a Goose Island 312 beer to keep it local and it was OK. Having beers in bottles here seems to be big, not too many places have a lot of beers on tap. I ordered a Personal Thin Crust Cheese Pizza and it was OK. I wasn't really a fan of the texture of the crust, but I thought the sauce had good flavor. There wasn't too much cheese either. A personal size was perfect for me because I'm not a big eater. My Husband ordered a Personal The Malnati Classic Deep Dish Pizza and he thought it was OK as well. Not the best he has had in the city.

I can easily eat 2 of those and was hoping to have leftovers. So I was disappointed by the size especially for the price. I ended up ordering a salad once the pizza came to ensure I was satisfied.

I feel like Giordano's and Pequod's are too thick and have too much cheese so I get full really quickly and feel fat and sluggish afterwards. Lou Manalti's deep dish is noticeably thinner than the other two so I'm not drowning in excess cheese. Also the buttercrust is a game changer! I've tried the following: - The Malnati Chicago Classic deep dish. Medium (serves 3) $19.95.  Made with Lou's lean sausage, some extra cheese and vine-ripened tomato sauce on Buttercrust. this is my favorite of the two pizzas I tried, mostly because I need to have meat on my pizza lol. tbh I'm not even a huge pizza fan normally but I love and dream of this one!  - The ""Lou"" deep dish. Medium (serves 3) $22.25 Spinach mix, mushrooms and sliced roma tomatoes covered with blend of mozzarella, romano and cheddar cheese on garlic Buttercrust. for the vegetarians and vegetable lovers out there, this is also delicious. maybe I will consider adding meat to this one day and it will achieve perfection.  - Malnati Salad. Family size (serves 4-5) $13.95 Romaine lettuce, tomatoes, black olives, mushrooms, salami bits and gorgonzola cheese with our Sweet Vinaigrette and romano cheese. OK. let me be real.

We ordered a medium deep dish pizza with sausage, olives, onions, mushrooms and peppers. When the pizza arrived 35 minutes later, since it does take time to cook. The waitress cut the slices and slid the steaming hot slice onto our plates. First bit was delicious, the sausage was full of flavor and the tomatoe sauce was perfection. Trust me after one slice you are full but you cant resist so you will find yourself going in on another slice, haha. The medium pizza was perfect for 3 people, we also ordered the wings, which were finger licking good , and a few beers. What a great way to start our visit off.

2016-07-22,2.0,"I was recently visiting Chicago for work (from Washington, DC) and my hotel recommended I go to Lou Malnati's down the street..  The place was packed with a fairly long wait, so clearly it's a popular place.  I also spoke with friends in Chicago who said it's a very popular local chain.  I didn't know either of those things when I first went there so my review is just based on my experience. My travel colleague and I agreed that this was the worst pizza we've had in years.  To clarify, we both ordered regular (thin) pizzas and not the Chicago deep dish that I believe the place is known for.  The pizzas took about 1 hour 20 minutes to be prepared so we were excited for great food, but I swear I could have bought a frozen pizza at the 7/11 down the street that would have tasted better. The pizza was paper thin like a cracker and was difficult to bite into because it was rock hard (also somewhat burnt but not terribly).  There was very little sauce and no real flavor.  It tasted like they forgot to put salt in the dough or something because it had no flavor either.  Local friends asked me if I liked the cornmeal texture on the crust and I said that we didn't have anything like that, so maybe the restaurant forgot to add it.  That would have definitely improved the pizza for me because I'm a fan of pizzerias that do that. The interior was very interesting and had amusing decorations.  The hostess and our waitress were very friendly (front desk woman was somewhat rude, though).  We left a tip for the service but not the food quality.  Based on our experience my colleague and I would not recommend this restaurant. However, I would be open to giving it a second chance based on the high recommendation I later received from friends (they think it might have just been this location and not the chain in general).  The fact that's it's such a popular chain is a good sign, but all I can do is comment on my experience.",0.9956,0.752,0.199,0.05,0.5370189420189421

We had this strangest server - who seemed more interested in looking out the window than taking our order. When she finally did, she was very awkward, and seemed uninterested in serving us. Our deep dish pizzas arrived (which took 45 minutes) and she served us- she did it specifically because ""the pans were dangerously hot"", she said - so I stick to the memo, and asked her if I could have another - as in if she'd SERVE me another - and she just said, ""yeah help yourself""!? I wasn't asking for permission, I was asking for help! Also just in case restaurant management is reading this, my table was broken - (where you turn the square table into a circular one: the expansion part of the table was dangerously wobbly)  Other than that, atmosphere was really nice - busy afternoon,  great view!",0.9626,0.76,0.169,0.07,0.6083333333333334
2016-07-20,3.0,"Perpetually crowded with only average pizza despite its reputation, Lou Malnati's Pizzeria may be worth a visit during an off hour, but don't go out of your way.  Yeah, Giordano's pizza is better. Really the review can be summed up with that sentence. I've settled the great Chicago (tourist) pizza debate. But before we get to that let's talk about the really long wait to get inside - it's best to come during an off hour, as this place was packed. To the restaurant's credit, they're pretty quick at seating, so we were seated in a very reasonable 45 minutes.  So of course we ordered the Chicago Classic deep dish pizza. It was only okay - the biggest problem I had was the ratio of cheese to sauce. It may be heresy to say, but there was too much cheese not enough sauce - the sauce wasn't traditional sauce but a sort of stewed tomato sauce. If you're a fan of cheesy bread you'll probably love this version of pie, but I love sauce more, and I just wasn't fan of this interpretation.  Overall, Lou Malnati's offers a pizza that some will love and others will find only average. I fell in the latter group, as I think there are better and less crowded pizza places in Chicago.",0.9955,0.754,0.232,0.014,0.48107526881720425

So there are two top dogs for the deep dish: Lou Malnati and Giordanos. My friend in Chicago recommended going to Lou Malnati as a first timer.  My friends and I stopped by on a Monday night at around 7pm. The restaurant was spacious (with tons of seating) and lively. It was packed and the host informed us that there will be a 20 minute wait. We were told that it would be best to order the pizza while waiting since it takes half an hour to prepare. Note that you cannot order appetizers until you get a table.  What was ordered: - Combination Platter - (Breaded mushrooms, breaded cheddar cheese bites, and mozzarella sticks with marinara sauce and ranch dressing) - Classic (Lean sausage and extra cheese) - I always go for the classic or the original when I first try something. It was delicious, but very filling and heavy. - The ""Lou"" (Spinach, mushrooms, Roma tomatoes, Romano and cheddar cheese) - This was my favorite of the night. It felt lighter than the classic.  The pies come in different sizes: personal, small, medium, and large. We went with two small pies. I was the only person at my table who was able to finish two slices. We ended up getting the leftovers to go. Granted my friends are not big eaters, but seriously the pizza was super filling. Lastly, service was great.

I decided to give it a try because I always see lots of people waiting outside, and I've heard good things. To be honest, I already have my favorite go-to pizza places around the city, but like I said, I wanted to give Lou's a shot. We come in, ask for a table for two. They say 15-20min wait (around 9:30 on a Friday night). Okay. The hostess told me that a few hours before the wait was 2+ hours for a table for two. Bless anyone's heart who actually waited two hours to try this mediocrity. Moving forward, eventually we're seated after 25 mins of waiting. Server got us drinks, everything was fine. We opted not to get any appetizers since nothing on the menu looked good. Finally, 45 minutes after we ordered it, the pizza comes. Overall, I would describe this pizza as completely bland. Literally nothing in it has an ounce of flavor. Crust, completely bland and dry, sauce not a HINT of spice/seasoning, even the cheese was just bleh. I really wanted to like this pizza, I really did. But it's honestly embarrassing that tourists come here and think this is ""Chicago pizza."" Trust me, there around people better pizza places in Chicago. The only good part about the pizza was that the sauce has chunks of fresh tomato in it, which I liked. Unfortunately, this still didn't give the pizza any flavor whatsoever. My and my boyfriend had to dump a ton of red pepper flakes and parmesan on top of our slices to even be able to eat it. Overall an expensive disappointment. If you're in the area (south State St.) and you're hungry, try Devil Dawgs up the block. It has great Chicago style dogs, excellent burgers, and great friend chicken. Skip Lou's.

If this were for a single person that'd be fine, but it was a thank you gesture for co-workers who helped out with a huge sales initiative.

I had to hold for about 5 mins before she was able to tell me that.

All ingredients were garden (and animal) fresh, and that crust, oh lord, was perfectly baked with that signature deep dish flaky crust. Excellent!  Service was excellent as well, with our waitress a constant presence offering to reorder drinks for our boozy party. We also shared their family size Malnati Salad dressed with their house made Sweet Vinaigrette. It is so delicious that they offer bottles to go, and I should have grabbed a couple.

2016-05-08,4.0,"Malnati's is definitely my favorite of the Chicago deep dish ""chains"", and while I'd been to other locations before, this was my first time at this particular Malnati's. Please note that my four-star review is for the food and the food alone; if I could give the location and service a separate review, it would be more like 2.5 or *maybe* 3 stars. As other reviewers have noted, you put your name in with the host and then place your order at a separate counter, so that you are waiting for your food (the deep dish pizzas take quite a while to cook) while you're waiting for your table. Of course the pizza (we just got the cheese, but of course with the buttercrust!) was perfect, and I also suggest the Stuffed Spinach Bread as an appetizer. Again, my main issues are with this particular location - first, because the entryway is VERY narrow, which makes for a crowded and confusing experience when trying to approach the host and then move on to order your pizza. Additionally, once we had our food it was like our table didn't exist at all, and we eventually even had to flag down another server to get our check. I understand that they were busy but seriously, we didn't see our server once after she brought out our pizza. Also, I don't know if it was just that day or what, but the music in the bathroom on our side of the restaurant was so loud that I actually had to cover my ears when I went in there.

2016-05-01,4.0,"This is my first exposure to (authentic) Chicago-style deep dish pizza. I say authentic because there was a place called Pizza Chicago in California we went to often but after having this, I realized it's nothing like the real thing. We got a Malnati Chicago Classic and a Malnati Salad. The Buttercrust is very distinctive - it has a hard crunch from the cornmeal used at the bottom, almost like deep-fried Chinese mantou. The entire thick crust was flavorful - the Pizza Chicago in California was basically just bread, but here the fragrance of the butter on the bottom really helped accentuate the flavor of the center, which is one of the hardest parts of a pizza to get right. The toppings were all excellent - compared to good NYC places I would say their taste is more hearty but less refined. The salad was very good but it's just a standard salad so I don't have much to say about it. Because of how filling deep-dish pizza is, you can only eat so many slices before you're full so it's a great deal.",0.9422,0.864,0.1,0.037,0.4569619047619047
2016-05-01,3.0,"Coming from New York, it's hard to beat New York's thin crust pizza. However, when in Chicago, you must try the deep dish pizza.  We arrived at Lou Malnati at around 7:40 pm on a Wednesday and were quoted a 10 minute wait. Not bad given its a restaurant for tourists in a tourist location. The best part was that the hostess informed us that if we were ordering deep dish pizza, to place our deep dish order in advance because it takes 30 minutes to cook. Music to my ears because we were waiting for our table and our food at the same time! They also text you when you've been placed on their wait list and then text you again when your table is ready. New York can take some notes there!  Once seated, we also ordered the trio of dips with pizza chips. The three dips consisted of garlic, artichoke and cheese, and hummus. Of the three, I liked the hummus the most. The artichoke and cheese was okay as it was a bit too cheesy; I didn't enjoy the garlic spread, but my friends enjoyed the garlic one the best. The pizza chips weren't really pizza chips in my opinion as I thought they were just toasted flatbread with tomatoes on top.  Then the deep dish pizza arrived. We were extremely disappointed because it didn't look like a deep dish pizza. It wasn't thick as we expected; it just looked like a sad drooping pie. The taste lived up to its looks as it just tasted like dough and huge globs of cheese. Where's all the tomato sauce and pepperoni ?! Of the 6 slices, I think we only had like 10 slices of pepperoni at most. The crust was also too hard as well. Unfortunately, none of us finished our 2 slices nor did we want to take the leftovers of the pizza and appetizer home. However, at least now we can say we had deep dish pizza in Chicago!",0.5222,0.829,0.083,0.088,0.5504010695187166

However,  the staff,  and relaxed atmosphere helped me warm to the place.  There are TVs and beer.  The beer menu is relatively small, but has a fantastic variety of diverse  local and national craft brews.   But the food,,, I ordered wings and a single serving deep dish Chicago pizza.  The wings came out quickly with plenty of celery and Gorgonzola cheese/dressing.  Great little improvement from ordinary Bleu cheese!   The pizza was unassuming.   That is until I bit into a piece.  The sausage was no run of the mill bland sausage.   The flavor popped out.  Then, the cheese. Lots of it and thick like a cheese stick.  The sauce was just right.   Not too watery, or too thick.   Not too much garlic, ,,,you get the point.   But, the whole pizza was completed by the Buttercrust.  It is fantastic.  All I can say is that I wish I lived nearby.",0.9854,0.814,0.155,0.031,0.4580357142857144

Curds were cooked far too long in old grease and we didn't even eat half of them. Then the salad came out. It was delicious and the only highlight of the meal. We waited and waited on the wings and when they finally came, they were barely warm and had way too much sauce. The pizza eventually came and it looked terrible. We ordered the classic, which is sausage and Roma tomatoes. The flavorless crust had a thick layer of cheese and then it seemed a solid layer of a sausage patty covered with Roma tomatoes. None of it had flavor, it was way too much cheese, and very unimpressive. And the worst part is the waiter noticed we didn't eat the curds or hardly any pizza and never said a word.

2016-04-20,3.0,"Several people recommended Lou Malnati and we saw a little feature of the pizza from this restaurant in a tv show, so my friend and I decided to give it a try. We went there on a Sunday afternoon after going to the Shedd Aquarium. We were seated at Table 32 right away but the shade that was on the window didn't help much. My friend had the seat with the sunshine shining directly towards her direction, it was very uncomfortable. The sunshine was shining on my back but I didn't mind it. Our waitress was Kaitlyn, that's the name that was listed on our check. Her service was very slow. She barely came by to check up on us. I asked her for recommendations but she seemed impatient and asked, ""For what?"" I said, ""Well, any of the foods."" She recommended the classic deep dish pizza, nothing else. We ordered two personal pizzas: The Lou and The Classic, and a House Salad with red vinaigrette dressing. The salad arrived very fast. The pizzas took a while. The waitress didn't inform us about the 30+ minutes wait for the pizzas until much later. I observed the other customers and some of the staff. The manager with glasses (he's in one of my pictures) was very friendly and helpful. I felt that he was the hardest working person there. He helped buss tables, asked customers if they needed anything, delivered dishes, and more. Yes, he's the manager and managers are expected to help when the staff is busy, but I felt like the waitress was supposedly to be doing some of the things he was doing. I saw her pacing around at some point, but maybe I am wrong, maybe she was pacing to go do something. Either way, her service was extremely slow and she didn't seem interested. The salad was good sized and the red vinaigrette dressing went well with the veggies. It was sweet but not too sweet. The veggies seemed fresh. The Lou pizza was both my friend's and my favorite compared to the Classic. We liked the mushrooms and the veggies.

We went on a Friday night and were quoted a 45 minute wait and ended up waiting for an hour. They have an app that lets you see your place in line but it's deceiving because we were ""next"" for 15 mins or so before we got a table. They let you preorder your pizza so that it cuts down on the wait time for the pizza to come out. Great in theory but in reality it only cuts down your wait by 5-10 mins because they don't place the order till you sit down.  We finally got our pizza an hour and a half after we got there and it was undercooked. The dough was not done. Our server tried to reassure us that it was still safe to eat because there are no eggs in the dough. But who would want to eat raw dough?!! They put it back in the oven and it was burnt when they brought it back out. Only later did we discover a short HAIR baked into the crust. This is just absolutely disgusting but we didn't discover this till we had left the restaurant.  We had the malnati Chicago classic (sausage) and the lou (spinach, mushroom). The Lou had absolutely no flavor to it. It was bland and it was torture eating it. The malnati Classic was better than the Lou (but that's a really low bar)  but I wouldn't say it was good.  Raw dough and hair aside, the pizza here was not as good as the pizza at giordano's.

The personal size pizzas are in fact true personal pizzas, very small. There's a good amount of toppings. While we did not like the pizza (probably due to geographic preferences), we loved the Spinach Salad which came in a huge huge portion. We also enjoyed the calamari.

The restaurant is full of old pictures from as far back as early 1900's. The history is really interesting and I love that the family shares these pics with the public and their story on every menu. We got the Chicago Classic. Every ingredient was fresh, delicious, and perfectly blended for a great pizza!! The sausage was so good. The cheese was plentiful, creamy, and covered the pizza. The sauce is so fresh that I think it was just made! We also had a salad. I ordered a small house salad... Big enough for two and extremely fresh! We also had the cookie for dessert. The ice cream was so good that it made the entire dish. The restaurant is clean. The staff are super friendly. The wait was about 20 minutes on a Friday night about 6:00.

We decided to order a couple brews to quench our thirst while we decided what we wanted to order. After looking it over we go for the medium size Malnati Chicago Classic pie that serves 3. The pie takes 30 minutes to bake so we enjoyed our brews while we watch other tables around us devour their pizza. Finally our pie arrives, bubbly, golden crust, yum! First slice hits the plate and it doesn't' disappoint , definitely need a fork and knife for this..the sausage topping was very generous, the proportion to the rest of the topping perfect.The crust was excellent, stood up well to the topping, buttery, chewy and crisp on the edges..just a great experience. Service: Great services, fast, friendly, attentive. Our waiter made recommendations on portion sizes and was very helpful.  Atmosphere: Designed like what I imagined a pizza parlor would look like, plus lots of seats allows for lots of hungry diners to get their pizza on!

The menu said the cheese bread was supposed to have garlic in it but you could barely taste the garlic. It tasted very bland. The marinara sauce that came on the side was not the best addition (the bread tastes better alone), and there was not enough for the whole order. I still ate the bread but I would not order it again.  The pizza was good but did not blow me away. The dough was tasty and soft, however it didn't have much of a crunch, and since I love Detroit style pizza I love a crust with a great crunch to it. The cheese was the best part and they put a lot of it on the pizza. All the veggies tasted fresh.

What is more quintessential Chicago thing than the mighty Deep Dish Pizza? I have been to other popular chains, hence curious me, picked this place.  We were greeted and seated right away. The interior is a standard Italian restaurant format cozy and welcoming. We ordered Medium sized The Malnati Chicago Classic with green peppers and olives. The waitress warned us that it would take half an hour for the pizza. So at least there upfront and clear about it.  The pizza looked good. The crust was nicely browned and the contrasting Parmigiano-Reggiano on the tomato sauce was a nice touch. When the waitress placed a slice/piece, it was intact. The Pizza tasted good. Chewy mozzarella was just melted right amount and buttery crust was may be too crusty. The pizza sauce was well, I would say not the best I have had. The Italian sausage was not spicy, but I wish it was bit more spicy. Overall the Pizza was good.  Oh I'm giving Three stars because of the aftermath. I think I got food poisoned that night. Prime suspect is the pizza. However I'm not leaving other food I had that day. I would visit another location of this chain to write another review.",0.8351,0.827,0.117,0.056,0.4828924162257496

2016-01-22,3.0,"You know, there might be something to this deep-dish phenomenon after all. New York-style pizza is really my favorite, but at Lou Malnati's I discovered I can love deep-dish too. The key is in the expectations: it's really more like lasagna than pizza, so once you understand that, you can sit back and be amazed. The overall experience is definitely that of a chain restaurant: there are huge groups of tourists (we were behind a girls' volleyball team) and there's a whole procedure to ordering and getting a table (done in that order, which makes sense because there's usually a long wait for both.) Our server was polite but harried; he looked completely slammed even in the middle of a weekday afternoon.  We began with their house salad, in which they use crispy, fried bits of pepperoni as croutons -- talk about a stroke of genius! -- but it was nothing special, and the dressing was way too sweet. We didn't finish it despite the inflated price tag. Despite these quibbles, however, there's nothing on this earth quite like their incredibly rich ""pizza"" casserole, with a buttery pastry crust, thick sauce, crispy pepperoni and an avalanche of melty cheese. It really was amazing, and the next time in Chicago I will make time for a repeat visit. Meanwhile, I need to stop writing Yelp reviews when I'm hungry!",0.9896,0.798,0.168,0.035,0.49528447742733456

The crust was thin and crisp, yes. There was lots of gooey mozzarella cheese topped with loads of sausage and tomatoes but somehow, it's missing a ""wow"" factor. I thought it was just me but everyone I ate it with echo my sentiments. It could've been over hyped is what it is which made our expectations soaring high. It's too bad though. To be fair, I probably should have dined in but I'm partly relieved I didn't because there are just too many good places to eat in Chicago and if I had the same outcome as when I ate it at the hotel and at home, I'd be bummed out to miss out on a better restaurant in this city.

Although everyone has their favorite deep dish pizza in Chicago (mine being Pequod's) this has to be one of the top recognized names along with Gino's and Giordano's. Lou's has a crispy crust, ample amount of cheese, and a large tomato chunk style sauce. I really wouldn't even consider it much of a ""sauce"", but more of a topping. Needless to say, there really isn't anything out there like it. One slice and you are full. The sausage also comes slab style across the entire pizza. I personally request and prefer their sausage pieces instead. Also, be sure to order the butter crust. It adds a great flavor! Other lesser known option that is nice is the lower-fat mozzarella cheese. I really could not tell the difference. As another ""healthier"" option, they now serve poultry sausage, which is also delicious.

We decided to go with a house salad individual serving and The Lou- spinach, mushrooms, sliced roma tomatoes covered with mozzarella, romano, and cheddar cheese on garlic Buttercrust in a medium (which serves 3 people). First thing we noticed- Lou's has giant portions. Our individual serving salad and pizza was good for 4 people; we couldn't finish our food! The salad had a bunch of toppings which was great, and after waiting 30 minutes (the wait time is on the menu), our deep dish came! The pizza was... delicious.

The crust was also nice and crisp, and it was great with ranch sauce. The food here was fantastic, and the service was also very attentive.

2015-10-23,3.0,"Sorry, Lou, but I just don't get the hype.  When visiting Chicago, I always make it a point to get deep dish pizza at least once.  On my last two trips, I tried Gino's East and Pizzeria Due (Uno's sibling), so I figured this time, I'd give Lou's a shot.  Since I was there in connection with a large convention, I figured the wait would be at least an hour, and was prepared to settle for take out.  However, I was quoted a wait time of 35 min., so I decided to wait for a table.  The quote was exactly right, and I put in my pizza order ahead of time to expedite things. I decided to try the Lou's salad for an appetizer ($9.25), which consists of romaine lettuce, Roma tomatoes, black olives, mushrooms, salami bits, and romano cheese drizzled with Lou's signature sweet balsamic vinaigrette.  This salad is quite generously portioned, despite being an individual size, and I wasn't able to finish it, since I needed to save stomach real estate for the pizza.  Despite that, it was quite good, and turned out to be the highlight of the meal. For my pizza, I ordered a small Lou ($16.30), which consists of spinach, mushrooms, and sliced Roma tomatoes in addition to the usual ingredients of crust, cheese, and tomato sauce.  Given that the small is designed to serve two people, I decided to order it rather than the individual size because I wanted to take leftovers back to my hotel to eat for lunch the next day.  While I will say that the butter crust is notable, and is superior to the crusts of other deep dish pies I've tried in Chi-town, I was less than impressed with the flavors of the other components of the pie, which didn't have the depth and marriage of other deep dish pies I've tried.  Like all deep dish pies, Lou's pie is quite substantial, so expect it to sit on your stomach like a brick, and plan accordingly (I forgot this the next day and regretted it). For dessert, I had the individual sized classic deep dish cookie a la mode ($3.50), which I'd eyed but never tried at other deep dish pizzerias.  While the temperature contrast was nice, again, I found the flavors lacking in depth, and the size was smaller than I'd envisioned.  I should have either ordered the regular portion or something else, such as the brownie sundae. Overall, while my meal at Lou's was certainly filling, it didn't quite meet the standards I was expecting in terms of flavor, particularly given that it's the best rated of the major deep dish chains in Chicago.  While I'm glad that I tried it, next time, I think I'll try a different deep dish pizzeria that I haven't tried yet, such as Giordano's or Pequod's, which seems to be a local favorite.  3.5 stars.",0.9957,0.869,0.122,0.009,0.4203642269680006

No biggie, we were led to a booth by the window and our server was on spot right away. The restaurant did have wine and beer available. Our waitress suggested appetizers but we weren't interested, until she mentioned that the pizza would take about 35 minutes. We opted for some bruschetta to tide us over. It was pretty basic, no balsamic involved, but the shaved parm and/or Romano was tasty. It took the edge off our hunger but I don't think I would order it again.  We ordered the Malnati Classic. This pizza was a succulent explosion of flavor! There was a savory snausage pancake layer on top and underneath that was a blanket of delicious, buttery, melty cheese and tomato sauce bursting with flavor. The crust was perfectly prepared.

To my surprise and excitation, both of my uncles live literally around the corner from the main location off 8th and Wabash in the South Loop area. So I certainly suggested we grab some pizza from there for dinner and oh it was an ""unforgettable"" (in a Nat King Cole way) palate experience.  Though they're famous for their original Chicago style deep dish, they offer thin crust as well and so since we all prefer thin crust style, we ordered two loaded large pizzas with pepperoni, ham, and onions and two orders of wings with gorgonzola for dipping. One word: Flame!  Regarding an authentic and tasty pizza, there are two criteria: the quality of the cheese and sauce, and both were amazing. Lou Malnati's pizza is very tasty and that butter crust alone is worth a 3 hour drive from Indy. My mouth is watering now thinking about it!

2015-09-09,4.0,"This is the second time I've had Lou Malnati's in Chicago.  The first time was at the location in River North on Wells.   This time was a little different.  We didn't eat outside and I was able to pre-order what I wanted while we waited for our table.  Pre-ordering cuts down on the time for your pie substantially since it takes a good 45 minutes to make by the time they get your order to the kitchen. Not pre-ordering would mean sitting down, waiting for a server and then telling him/her what you want and then waiting another good 45 minutes or so.  Deep dish takes time no matter where you go and they are made to order. We came in on a Sunday afternoon and it was a bit of a wait for a table.  Straight ahead from the entrance is the pickup and pre-order counter.  You can order drinks at this counter as well and drink them before you get your table if you wanted a drink beforehand.   The check in for a table is the hostess just to the left of the pre-order table.  The waiting area is basically when you come right in and there's 2 dining rooms to either side of the entrance.  The entrance and waiting area basically divide the dining areas from one another.  There are fridges beside the entrance/exit doors as well for take out etc.   We waited about 20 minutes for a table and another 20 minutes for our pie.  I had went ahead and ordered the medium sized Malnati Chicago Classic.  The classic is as on their menu, ""Made with Lou's lean sausage, some extra cheese and vine-ripened tomato sauce on Buttercrust.™ It's authentic Chicago!"" The buttercrust is trademarked!  Funny but seriously good.  Lou's buttercrust is like a pizza lover's pastry as it's more like a pie crust but with the right amount of crunch and density and it doesn't get soggy even with all the tomato sauce and cheese.  Basically it keeps its structural integrity with the toppings just layered on thick. The sausage is in fact lean and not spicy at all.  On the table they have pepper flake and cheese shakers so you can dress it up even more if you wanted. Our server who was quite friendly and helpful was more than happy to cut our slices and plate them for us.  I didn't really need help but it's almost as if she had insisted.  She did however forget that we had ordered a calamari appetizer which actually worked out because the medium pie was large and there were left overs.   I went with a 312 pale ale, local brew of course and it was nice. I figured we'd go to this location in the South Loop because I wanted to avoid the entire River North/Magnificent Mile tourist/busy areas.  This location was still busy but the wait wasn't very long considering we were able to pre-order our pie while waiting for the table and this area of the city is far less busier than north of the river. Still, Lou's is my favorite among all the others we've had before (Uno/Due and Gino's East).",0.9868,0.876,0.095,0.03,0.4463955026455027

The spinach salad was very average: the goat cheese was nice, as were the strawberries, but the rest of the salad isn't worth mentioning. The deep dish pizza was incredible. The sauce actually tastes like tomatoes, which is something pizzas across America can't seem to get right. The crust has this great crispiness contrasted with the softer inside. My only gripe was that the surface between the crust and sauce/cheese was a bit too soft, which may have been by design, but made me think it needed just one more minute in the oven.

2015-08-28,4.0,"First bite of a real Chicago deep dish pizza, in Chicago! Quite delicious! The wait from ordering the pizza to having it arrive at the table was about 35 mins. I tried the Classic and the Lou, personal pan size. I liked the Classic alot - the buttery crust, layer of  sausage, stretchy soft, warm mozzarella cheese, and chunky tomato-y sauce on top. The buttery crust was much crisper and had subtly more taste than regular crust. The Lou was good, but not as good. It consisted of cheese, spinach, white button mushrooms, and a layer of tomato sauce on top. The regular crust used for the Lou was more bland. The cookie pizza was a chocolate chip cookie warmed in a hot little ramkin, topped with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, and a cherry. It was sweet and tasty. The whipped cream was too much for me and I had to scrape it off. This is a casual, comfortable, warm-lighted pizza restaurant. I would love to come back for another deep dish, and to get a larger size! (One more thing, the deep dish here wasn't as deep as I thought it would be.

It was a very nice touch to give us the pagers in advance as well a menu and told us to go ahead and place our order for pizza while we waited. They would put the pizzas in and cook them halfway and when our pager was called, they would put the pizza back in and cook the final few minutes. However when we got in and finally got a pizza it seemed that the crust was overcooked slightly. I ordered the sausage deep dish with several extras. The sausage was very good large pieces and the pizza all together was pretty good, however it did not live up to my expectation.  The service was not good as our server was not very attentive to our drinks as we ran out of water and refillable pops and she never noticed.

On a Monday afternoon there was still a bit of a line. The wait was about 30 minutes but I was really happy that they allowed you to order your pizza while you wait so that when you get to your table, the pizza doesn't take long. Deep dish pizza typically takes quite a bit of time in the oven so it really cut our time in staying at the restaurant. They offer a personal size that feeds one, and then small, medium, large, etc. The small is supposed to feed two, so my friend and I decided to share the Classic Malnati deep dish pizza. We also shared a stuffed spinach bread because carbs are so delicious, so why not? The bread came first and it looked like a small little loaf. We were surprised when we cut it open. The bread was piping hot and inside there was ooey, gooey cheese and spinach! It came with a marinara sauce to dip. The bread was fabulous! The outside was perfectly crisp and the small amounts of bread on the inside were nice and fluffy. The cheese was melted and I enjoyed the spinach pieces. Perfect pair with the marinara sauce! Our pizza came shortly after (yay for not waiting too long!). The server cuts the pizza for you and serves each person a slice. The Classic comes with a layer of cheese and then a huge layer of sausage. We are not talking little bits and pieces of sausage, we're talking a whole circle of pure meat. They take their meat seriously and don't skimp here! On top is the lovely tomato sauce. I really enjoyed the pizza overall. I thought that they put the right amount of tomato sauce (I've experienced places that put way too much sauce) and the meat was quite lean. The only thing I didn't like was that there was just a bit too much cheese. I felt like it was becoming a giant stringy mess that I probably could have choked on if I didn't chew an incredible amount of times. The best thing was the crust. It tastes like perfectly toasted dough with a light spread of butter. I love how crisp it is and the crunch it makes. The small pizza serves two and gives four large slices. My friend and I each had a slice and we couldn't finish the other two slices. The portion sizes are generous and we probably could have just shared a personal size pizza. Service was pretty good. The ladies who took care of us were so lively and cheerful (it was infectious!). We were checked up on a lot in the beginning, but then my water was never refilled. Other than that, the ladies were really great despite it being so busy. For the pizza for two (plus leftovers) and the appetizer + a beer, the total was about $30. I found this to be really reasonable for the amount of food we got. Plus, it's not Chicago without  going to a deep dish pizza place!",0.9991,0.75,0.22,0.031,0.5490510697032436

2015-06-24,5.0,"I traveled to Chicago for one reason: To find the best deep dish pizza in America.  After visiting 7 different places which included big names such as Giordano's, Gino's, Uno's and Pequods, Lou Malnati's takes first prize by a hair.   This famous pizza establishment rises a smidge over the pack with their remarkably sweet, thick mozzarella cheese and buttery, flaky, golden crust.  Nothing in Chicago was more impressionable than these two combined as each bite made my eyes widen.  The cheese, which is brought in from Wisconsin, stretched an impossible length that would make you believe you could mini-jumprope with it.  It's like Lou's took string cheese and laid a blanket of it across the pie. Fantastic. Pizza enthusiasts have formed a cult following for Pequod's caramalized crust, but I still feel Lou's tastes better.  Although Pequod's may be caramelized,  in the process of doing just that, they burn parts of their crusts, eliciting a charred taste that isn't enjoyable throughout.  To achieve my orgasmic pizza experience, order the ""Malnati Chicago Classic"".  (A small can easily serve two people, giving each two big slices and costs $14.65.)  This pie comes with large, lean, sausage, and vipe-ripened tomato sauce.  I also added pepperoni to have complementing meat tastes which cost an extra $1.90.  I personally wouldn't recommend ""The Lou"" as the spinach and mushroom mix seems to make the pizza more watery and monotone in taste--a totally contrasting experience compared to the Malnati Chicago Classic.  You may have noticed that I didn't mention much about the sauce, toppings, or the depth of the pizza.  This is because the sauce at Lou's lacked the erumpent layering of flavors that Giordano's possessed in their pies.  Lou's compensates for this flaw with their delicious, sweet cheese and flavorful toppings. In regards to the deepness of the pizza, Giordano's wins there too since their pies are at least 2.5 inches deep, whereas Lou's is about 1.5inches.  The toppings at Lou's are impressively large, but in regards to taste, Pequod's wins there.   ----- Conclusion: 4.5 Stars.  In a perfect world, I'd take Giordano's sauce, Pequod's generous/gargantuan toppings, and Lou's cheese and buttered crust.  If pressed to choose only one pizza place in Chicago, I'd urge you to come here to satiate your deep dish cravings, and I wouldn't feel bad about it.  Just be patient as the deep dish pies take close to an hour. Extra Notes: -Accepts credit card -Lunch Specials: (From 11AM-2PM Daily) One topping personal deep dish pizza for only $8.75!  Comes with salad and drink too -Decor has a classic, woody, feel, but has terrible lighting.  Not the most optimal place for food pictures -Servers are kind and will even serve you the pizza as it comes out.  You can request to do it yourself for photo ops. -I waited 45 minutes to be seated and another 50 minutes for the pizza to be ready.  Patience is key--don't come completely famished or else, bring a snack while you wait. -Restrooms are clean",0.9964,0.844,0.138,0.018,0.49274483378256956
2015-06-23,2.0,"To say I was underwhelmed is an understatement. This place is way overhyped, overpriced, and the pizza does not live up to it at all. First of all you have to wait a long time to get your pizza so many people call their orders in ahead of time. I had a coupon for a free appetizer so I decided to get the fried calamari and eat that while I waited over 30 minutes for my pizza! I got the Lou Malnati Chicago classic which is simply sausage deep dish pizza. Let's go over the ingredients in the pizza. First of all, they use a butter crust, which tastes like it belongs with a dessert and not a pizza. It's okay but not my favorite. The crust on the edge of the pizza is about 2 inches tall and almost a half inch thick.  I noticed most people in the restaurant did not even eat this crust so that tells you a lot right there that it really isn't all that great. Not to mention the fact that there isn't enough sauce on the pizza so you can't even dip that crust in some sauce to help it go down easier.  On top of the crust is a thick layer of mozzarella cheese.   I noticed it was really thick in the middle of the pizza almost to the point to where you could choke on it but it was thinner on the edges. Normally a sausage pizza has chunks of meat on it but here it's an entire layer of sausage just like the cheese, which is too much. On top of the sausage is a layer of chunky tomato sauce. All three ingredients were pretty bland; there wasn't much seasoning to stimulate the taste buds.  There were too many tomato chunks and for some reason they do not peel the tomatoes so you get pieces of skin throughout the pizza, which should never be in a sauce. My waitress never came by to ask me how my food was, I assume because I guess their reputation precedes themselves so they don't think they have to! I ate three out of the four pieces; if I had not gotten the calamari I would've eaten the entire thing. But I would say most people would only be able to eat half of it; it's pretty heavy and filling.  I spent over $20 there with tip; I would rather spend five dollars and get a Little Caesars mushroom pizza!!!",0.9449,0.893,0.074,0.033,0.4995319495319496

The pizza had a thick buttery crust, with a layer of sausage and topped with chunks of fresh tomatoes. I really like how the sausage was a layer, and not chunks because each bite got an even piece of sausage. The tomatoes tasted fresh.  It was delicious and now, I can only daydream about it.

2015-06-09,5.0,"Ok so, being an east coast resident I have always heard about deep dish pizza and of course the ever popular Lou Malnati's. I had reservations about deep dish pizza, especially because I like thinner crust. So for us, coming here was just an obligatory stop during our trip to Chi.  And then we actually ate the pizza (the Malnati Chicago Classic and ""The Lou"")......and wow. I was pleasantly blown away by how tasty the pizza was, and how each component of the pie shined on its own. The sauce, for example, isn't that pre-made tomato puree smothered with garlic and dried oregano. Instead, the sauce tastes homemade and has a lighter color and less aggressive flavor than most other pizza sauces I have had - it actually tasted like vine ripened tomato. I would even venture to say that this was some of the best pizza sauce I have had, period. The crust was buttery and crunchy. Although it was thick, it didn't taste dough-y - the perfect foundation for the pie. The Malnati Chicago classic was my favorite of the night, with a complete layer of sausage (not bits and pieces) and of course that vine ripened sauce - just excellent. The ""Lou""was a vegetarian pizza with mushrooms, spinach, tomatoes. Also very delicious and was very pretty as it came to our table.  Lou Malnati's also clearly has the formula right, they coordinate your pizza order with your wait time so that guests don't have to wait 45-60 minutes upon getting a table to enjoy the pie. Furthermore, we also tried the Malnati salad (romaine, tomato, mushrooms, olives, and salami in a their sweet vinaigrette), which I would also recommend to break up the carb overload from the ensuing pizza.  It's also worth noting that I also tried another deep dish place on my trip, which isn't a tourist trap, and is supposed to be known for their crispy deep dish crust. That place was good too, but Lou Malnati got the nod from myself, and the three others in my party hands down. The Malnati deep dish crust might not have that caramelized cheese edge, but its still better. Also, service was good and if your sharing (which I cant imagine you wouldn't do considering the size of the pizzas) the prices are very very reasonable.

However, thanks to tips from Chicago locals, I found Lou Malnati and it  changed my mind! This is the real deal, and though I haven't given up NY-style pizza, I would love to eat this all the time.  Food: 5/5 We had the Malnati Chicago classic, which has sausage, extra cheese, tomato sauce and Lou Malnati's signature ""Buttercrust"". I think that the crust is what made it stand out. Most deep dish pizza that I've had ended up with crunchy sides and a soggy bottom, but this was perfectly crispy all around. The butter also made it amazingly delicious. This was a great pizza and it is very filling. A small was enough to fill the 2 of us and we had no extra room for anything else.  Of note, it does take 20 minutes to make the pizza so you will be waiting quite a while. If you are hungry, get a salad or something while you wait.  Recommend: The Malnati Chicago Classic Service: 3/5 We were here around 5pm so we missed the crowds and the place was almost empty. No waiting at all! Staff were friendly and nice, they also warned us that the pizza would take 20 minutes. Atmosphere: 3/5 Feels like a sports bar/diner. You come here for the food, not the ambiance.

The crust too was basically flavorless, even though they advertise it as ""buttercrust."" I didn't notice any flavor of butter or anything else. Not even a little salt. The whole thing was underseasoned and only tasted of cheese.  The service is weird too. The waitress took my order, and because the pizza takes a half hour to come, I didn't see anyone for another half hour. No check-up on water or anything. then when my pizza came, she cut a slice and disappeared until it was time for the bill.  The worst part though is that they screwed me with their menu. I saved this for last bc I had already written the food details into Yelp before my bill came. Basically, they inexplicably name their pizza sizes different for deep dish and other crusts. The other crusts have S M L and XL sizes. The deep dish pizzas have personal, S, M, and L. You guessed it ... Personal on one is Small on the other. So when I ordered my pizza after looking at the whole menu, I asked for the ""small personal"" malnati's special ( a deep dish)  not realizing there were conflicting size labels. And again, you guessed it, I got a small deep dish instead of the Personal, and was charged $15 instead of $9. So ridiculous.

2015-05-12,4.0,"I was in town for a business trip alone a few months ago when it was brutally cold, and I was staying at Palmer House.  I hate going out to sit-down places when I'm alone, so I ended up ordering delivery online from Lou's based on a recommendation from the concierge.  I've been to Chicago a few times before, and Giordano's is my only reference point for Chicago pizza, so I decided to go with something different.   I'm really glad that I gave them a try! I got a Personal Pan size sausage & mushroom with the butter crust (amazingly only $10.95),  and an order of BBQ wings ($8.95).   I'm pretty critical about anything bbq since I make a lot of my own, but these were good.   The butter crust was really good, and I was surprised because it wasn't ""bready"" at all like many other pizza crusts.  It was a pan pizza, but thin and crispy and very tasty.   The only negative comments I have about the pizza is that it really lacked seasoning, in my opinion, and the center of the pizza was a little soggy.  I expected it to have a lot more flavor than it did. Kudos for allowing paper plates/napkins/utensils kits to be ordered on the online ordering page!  I hate ordering delivery at a hotel and not having any utensils available. With tax, delivery charge, and tip, the bill was about $30.  It was worth a little extra to not have to walk all the way down there in the cold after work.   I will definitely try Lou's again (but maybe ask for extra seasoning or something).",0.8714,0.828,0.102,0.07,0.5689682539682539

I got a personal cheese deep dish pizza and it was so bland and disappointing, I actually got bored while I was eating. It tasted of nothing, the cheese was stringy rather than oozey, it was barely luke warm. In England we have a frozen pizza brand called Chicago Town and it tastes about 5 times better than the pizza I had here. Also the atmosphere - it just feels like a cheap chain restaurant where people take their kids for cheap bland food.

The pizza was outstanding!   Wow, blew me away.  Much much better than Giordano's.  Giordano's salad was better though. The crust was flaky and the amount of marinara and cheese was much more proportionate for my taste. The sausage on the Classico was the biggest factor.  Great flavoring and the each flavor balanced real well. Price - for 3 people, family salad, drinks, wings, and a medium pizza, $50.  Giordano's cost me $33  for a small pizza with an individual salad just only me the night before.

When I asked a friend who used to live 30 miles south of Chicago, where I should go, he said he likes Lou Malnati's best, so Lou Malnati's it was. I was impressed, (but disappointed), at how modern the restaurant is. For some reason I was under the impression is was an old school, divey place. But it's nothing like that at all. I was really hoping for someplace more local and dumpy feeling. But that's fine, whatever. Our group shared the Chicago Classic. Damn those slices are filling. I could hardly finish two. The bottom crust is thinner than I expected and the edge crust is good. It's very thin and crispy. The sausage is too mild, it lacked flavor, which is too bad, because you get sausage in every single bite.

The great thing about deep dish pizza is that there is so much cheese that you can hide things that are healthy like spinach in it, and feel better about yourself even though you don't really deserve to. The veggies also add some great texture to the cheese-crust combo. The sausage pizza is also pretty great -- it's like a layer of sausage on the pizza. It's downright impressive.

2015-04-23,4.0,"It almost seems redundant for me to write a review of Lou's given the vast quantity of people who have already sung its praises. Despite that though, like the faithful Yelp'er I am, I will not let that discourage me from offering my own, NY-Born &Raised opinion. Food: I have had Chicago-style pizza before, and have always thoroughly enjoyed the completely different pizza experience it offers compared to that of a traditional NY-style pizza. Personally, both types of pizza (NY and Chicago) do not even belong in the same conversation because they are two wildly different interpretations of my favorite food. This, of course, is ironic because they utilize the exact same ingredients. Though, it is in the execution of these ingredients, and the compilation of these ingredients that creates an entirely different pizza eating experience. Lou's is probably the standard for Chicago-style pizza; compiling sauce, and cheese on top of an incredibly well-nuanced butter-crust. Starting with the crust, it amazed me how that crust hit on several different flavor-notes in my mouth. It started of slightly flaky and buttery, then had a pleasant undertone of olive oil, and finished with a clean and pleasant sweetness that significantly added to the overall flavor of the pie. The crust was incredible, and IMO, as good as it gets for Chicago-style pizza. Crust: 5 / 5 The cheese left a little bit to be desired for me. I like a little bit more of a salty-bite to my cheese to contrast the inherent sweetness of the tomato sauce, and the flavors of the dough. Despite that, the cheese had a great texture, was appropriately compiled on the pizza (not too much, not too little), and added to the overall flavor of the pie.  Cheese: 4 / 5 Sauce: This is certainly where it is at for Lou's! Excellent sauce, bursting with fresh tomato flavor with an inherent sweetness and a smooth underlying acidity that really elevates the entire pie!  I was a big fan of the sauce because of how nice and clean of a tomato flavor it had. It did not taste like the inside of a can, was not overly acidic, and was not overdressed with sugar to try and mask the acidity. This sauce may the definition of 'balance'. Sauce:  5 / 5 Overall Pizza Score: 5 / 5 Service: The service at Lou's was less inviting than I had hoped for. It wasn't rude, and I am sure that the mass volume of people that frequent the restaurant could play a role in the general lackluster performance of the staff (because serving a lot of customers is EXHAUSTING); but I was hoping for an authentic, Italian feel to the hospitality. Unfortunately, it was staffed with a lot of younger people who seemed disillusioned with the hordes of people constantly inside the restaurant. Despite that, the experience was still positive. Service: 3 / 5 Atmosphere: I really enjoyed the atmosphere at Lou's in terms of the aesthetics, the seating options, the furnishings, and the overall cleanliness. What I wasn't a big fan of was how crazy-busy it was both times we went. Of course, this is of no fault to Lou's, as they have an excellent product. For me though, I like my dining experiences to be a little more personal and a little more intimate. Because of how many people are here, the overall volume of the restaurant is high, and the environment seems like controlled-chaos. Again, good for Lou's; but just know this when you go! Atmosphere: 4 / 5 Price: For the quality of the product I received, and for the personal pizza which (if I remember correctly) was about $8.00, I think that I paid an appropriate price. The quality of the ingredients were of the highest variety, and the entire experience was very positive. Price: 4 / 5 Final Thoughts: if you are coming to Chicago for the first time and have not delved into the world of Chicago-style pizza, or even if you have limited experiences with it, this is an excellent starting point. I have a feeling that even if I were a Chicago-native, though I would definitely want to try Lou's competition, I would bet that i would find myself coming back to Lou's time-and-time-again for what I believe to be, one of the best Chicago-style pizzas in the world. Yes, that is a lofty claim given my relatively novice palette for Chicago-style pizza; but until I have another that rivals it, I dub this the standard for Chicago-style pizza.",0.9979,0.827,0.151,0.022,0.47647251001183594

2015-04-12,3.0,"Went on a Friday night in a group of two around 9pm. There wasn't a wait and we were seated immediately. The waitress came over and asked us for our drinks. Once we said we wanted beer - she said she'd have to grab the beer list from the table on our right. Instead of grabbing the beer list - she checked how the table over was doing. She then got that table new plates. She then went and got a pizza and served it to the table on the left. They were disappointed with their pizza. They had ordered half pepperoni and half sausage. When it came out - it was pepperoni and sausage mixed. They asked the waitress if it was mixed and she said yes - was it not supposed to be? And they said no but that they would eat it anyway. No other solution was offered to make up for the kitchen's error. About five minutes later she came to check on the table on our left and realized she had never given us the beer list! We went ahead and ordered everything (drinks, appetizer, meal) at that point to avoid waiting any longer. She brought us our water and beers. Beers were all bottled so they were fine - but upon taking a sip of our waters we realized it tasted off. It tasted like watered down Sprite - even had a touch of carbonation! We asked the table to our left if they were having that issue. They said no  - but that they could even see the carbonation in our glasses compared to theirs! It had been about five minutes and we hadn't seen our waitress so we asked a waited to grab us new waters as the ones we had tasted like watered down sprite. Our waitress brought us out the new waters - saying that the drinks were in pitchers so it was totally possible we got old Sprite. After that rocky start - service got progressively better. We got the three cheese bread as an appetizer. It was tasty - but nothing exceptional. I had a small thin crust pepperoni pizza and my boyfriend ordered the small deep dish cheese pizza. Again both were tasty - but again nothing earth shattering. I didn't particularly care for the seasoning of the crust but it didn't affect the experience too much. Overall, it was good pizza and good cheesy bread but nothing out of the ordinary.",0.8383,0.892,0.062,0.046,0.4102837127030675
2015-04-10,4.0,"My favorite deep dish The Lou Special. It is veggie with 4 cheeses. It has a buttery crust. This perfection  takes 30 minutes from the time of ordering. To pass the time, we enjoyed a tasty spinach salad dressed lightly with sweet and savory balsamic dressing. We added chicken that was diced and still warm.  Then came the stuffed spinach cheese bread. Cheesy goodness with a rich tomato based pizza sauce for dipping. We enjoyed the 'bread' - really a euphemism for a buttery, crisp crust to contain the cheesy goodness.  The best surprise was that since the kitchen was a bit backed up, our wonder of ooey, chewy, cheese wonder was free.  Nice service! The pizza came out sizzling hot. A sprinkle of red pepper flake and Parmesan made the perfect enhancement to the spinach, mushroom, tomato, and garlic deep dish delight. We left wonderfully full.

2015-01-28,4.0,"Lou, you will forever always have a place in my heart. I went with some coworkers for dinner here and ordered the Classic sausage pizza. Please note, it takes about 30 minutes for the pizza to come out. So if you are really hungry, order a side or appetizer to snack on, otherwise, get ready to chat up your group or play some games to kill the time. This was my first time having a Chicago deep dish pizza. I have to say, it wasn't exactly what I expected, but it was still good. The pizza looks (and is probably heavy), but it didn't taste heavy. Their sauce tastes pretty fresh and even with a layer of sausage across the top of the pizza, I didn't feel like it was oozing too much grease and fat.  I just expected deep dish pizza to be a lot thicker and with more cheese, but this was a good first dip into deep dish pizza! It was about $30 (including tax and tip) for a medium pizza that fed all of us and had 2 slices leftover.",0.9435,0.852,0.119,0.029,0.43416666666666676
2015-01-28,5.0,"Out of all the deep dish pizza places I have had in Chicago and California (where I live) Lou Malnati's is my favorite by far!!!!! Reasons why this is the best: 1. The butter crust gives a deliciously flakey and flavorful addition to the pizza. When you get down to the crust at the end, you just want to eat it instead of throwing it away and regarding it as extra carbs. 2. The sausage was evenly disbursed around the pizza and came in sausage patties instead of normal balls at normal pizza places. This made for a full bite of delicious sausage flavor. 3. The tomato sauce and cheese were balanced just right. At other deep dish places I have been to, there is too much tomato sauce, and I am not a huge fan of tomato sauce (it's too tangy). The ratio between the two were perfect, neither overpowering the other and complementing the pie as a whole. I definitely recommend eating here!

However, because I'm one of those people that love all sorts of toppings, I went ahead and got me some mushroom, spinach, sausage and pepperoni. Not bad, not bad at all. The only tiny observation I have to make is due to the fact that everything's added to the pizza raw - and being a deep dish - the spinach does not cook well. It remains quite raw. And there is a large amount of it. Not bad, just an observation.  The second time I decided to go with strictly cheese and hit the nail on the head!

2015-01-13,3.0,"My experience just okay. I will start off with the food. We started off with the Calamari appetizer. It was really good. Not too salty or greasy. Also came with a good portion. I would order it again. After that we got the small size Lou pizza. It was very cheesy and kind of tasted healthy due to the minimal grease and tomato's and spinach. Not bad. After that, we saw an amazing looking desert and ordered the cookie sundae. It as amazing. I feel next time I would order the bigger portion since we got the one that was single serving. All in all, I liked the food. Now for the service, We came around 5:45 before the dinner rush arrived but spent an hour and half there. Our server Robert kept forgetting about us. I can understand if he had many tables to attend to, but the first hour we were only 1 of his 2 tables. I also realize that the pizza does take time to cook, however I was very observant of how fast his other tables were getting food. He forgot about our waters which remained empty for 10-15 minutes. Also note that their glasses are pretty large so he should have noticed this prior to both cups becoming completely empty. It still was not busy yet because he had plenty of time to socialize in front of us with his coworkers. 45 minutes into the sitting our pizza finally came. Shortly after that, the table next to us whom arrived 30 minutes after us got their pizza as well. We just ordered 1 small pizza. Once the pizza was finished we still gave him another chance and tried to order drinks and desert so we asked for a couple menus. He forgot to give us the drink menu or ask about it later on, so the next time we saw him we just pointed at the tables desert next to us and told him we wanted that. After that, he went and refilled another tables drinks and socialized for a good few minutes and afterwards made eye contact with me and flagged down a fellow co-worker to put in our order. I will stop at that because the experience makes me angry because of the fact I can tell he has much experience working at the restaurant. He knew the menu very well and gave good descriptions, but lacked in the ability to simply give us attention. We were not a cheap table either. We ordered a appetizer, pizza, and desert.  In conclusion, the food was decent but the service was terrible. Make sure you get someone other than Robert unless you don't drink much or plan to stay for a couple hours. I normally feel hurtful for using names of the employees in reviews, but I feel it should be said.",0.934,0.872,0.082,0.046,0.49124737945492664

The toppings were delicious.  Pepperoni was crispy but not overcooked.  The mushrooms, onions, and olives were fresh and added a nice sweet and salty balance to the pizza. Finally the crust.  The crust to me is buttery and not ridiculously thick.  The crust to me is the biggest difference between Lou's and Gino's.  Both are good in their own right but for me Lou's just has a little more something.   Overall good food, good service, and consistency is why I continue to come back.  I would definitely recommend Lou's for your deep dish pizza cravings.",0.9913,0.789,0.211,0.0,0.5083201058201058

NOTE:  Our deep dish pizza required a 30 minute cooking time. We passed the half hour talking story, sharing our likes and critiques of the Chicago sites we visited, and waited eagerly in anticipation.  Or at least I did.  I was terribly excited when the pizza was finally ready.  Served piping hot, our server happily put a slice on both of our plates and told us to ""enjoy.""   FOOD:  The small pizza allowed us two slices each.  Firstly, I'll tackle the crust.  It was very crisp and surprisingly not very oily.   A medley of cheese, sausage, and tomatoes covered the crust completely.  All the said ingredients were a heavenly combination that my taste buds thoroughly enjoyed.  Of course, every last morsel of the pizza was devoured and we left very FULL and satisfied.   SERVICE:  Simply outstanding.  Our server was a very friendly and patient young lady.  She answered all our questions about the menu and local beers, and checked on us in a timely manner throughout the meal.

The sausage, pepperoni, and tomato sauce were an excellent combination. Adding the pepperonis are a must. They layered everything perfectly with the perfect amount of toppings with each bite. The Lou is their vegetable pizza with spinach and mushrooms. It was pretty good but I preferred the Malnati Classic over the Lou. The Lou had too much cheese and not enough tomato sauce.

We only waited 15-20 minutes after arriving around noon on a Saturday, which wasn't too bad, but we had to wait another 30 minutes after being seated. They take your order while waiting since the pizza takes a while to cook. It's such a smart idea. In hindsight, I'd rather wait 30 minutes seated than an hour. We got the regular cheese and the sausage. Both were great and I couldn't stop eating. When I became full after I started my second slice, I lamented that I could not fit more in my stomach. It was cheese-y and not oily, with a great crunch from the crust. Next time I go to Chicago, I'll definitely be back.",0.9299,0.804,0.134,0.062,0.3983211233211233
2014-10-02,5.0,"I enjoyed my first Chicago deep dish experience at Lou's.  It's just a couple of blocks from the S Michigan Avenue Hilton conference center.  We had no wait to get in at 6:30 on Wednesday night.  The atmosphere was fun and  the service was great; you could tell the employees liked being there and they liked each other. Our waiter, Jason, was helpful with ordering suggestions, taking care of us, as well as really nice.  We had a big lunch earlier, so Jason recommended a small pie and a salad to share. He warned us that the pies take 30 minutes to cook, and we were drinking beer, so we wanted a light appetizer while we waited. it was all  very fresh. The salad was very good with housemade dressing, mixed greens and nice toppings.  The pie had delicious fresh tasting,chunky tomato sauce.  The sausage was lean, I prefer a spicy sausage, but this was good and not greasy. There was a plentiful layer of mozzarella~also  not greasy. My favorite toppings were the spinach mix with basil and garlic, and we added extra garlic~ yummy. The crust was a slightly hard cookie like texture~ you had to pierce it with your fork to break pieces away, but with a light buttery taste.  They had a good bottle beer selection, we had 2 different Goose islands, and there were several wines~ I think you just chose a type of wine~ not brand.  Fun casual dining~ good food, good service, nice atmosphere~ happy customers.",0.9935,0.72,0.229,0.051,0.5807843137254902

2014-09-27,3.0,"My sister and I were first time Chicago visitors for the weekend and of course, we could not leave without trying deep dish pizza. After finishing some touristy ventures at the Wilis Tower, we were close to the south loop location. When we got there it seemed pretty busy, but luckily for 2 on a Sunday night it was only about a 25 minute wait.  Tips:  - They don't take reservations so if you're with a bigger group I'd say try and hit this place not during a rush hour  - You pre-order pizzas at the front before you're seated (It saves about 15 minutes of wait time at the table). You can also order drinks here while you wait, but do so at the same time that you pre-order the pizza. They just put it on the tab of your table which is pretty cool! Appetizers, salads, ect. are ordered at the table.  - Pizza's come in personal, small, medium, and large sizes. We got an appetizer and a small and we were stuffed! (For 2 people , a small was a about 2 large pieces - so we ended up taking home the extra two and eating them for breakfast...not the healthiest but whatever haha)  We got some hard ciders while we sat and waited. They had a couple of stools, which was nice since we had been standing in line at the Wilis for what seemed like forever (not to mention my sister was breaking in her new heeled boots... ).  The quoted wait time was pretty accurate and when we finally got to our table our server promptly arrived and took our appetizer order. We decided to get the calamari on top of our pre-ordered small  Malnati's Sausage Classic. It was pretty busy so it took a little bit for our app and pizza to come out, which is why they stress pre-ordering I guess. All in all, the calamari was surprisingly delicious (I mean, I never hold high expectations of seafood at a pizza place...but I was pleasantly surprised). The Pizza was pretty good, but not amazing. The crust was pretty unique - followed all the hype about crispy, buttery crust, but the flavor of the pizza itself wasn't that unique. I mean, you know what they always say about pizza - when it's good it's good, and when it's bad...it's still pretty good. I mean it wasn't bad, but it wasn't bad but.. you get what I'm saying...it was pizza.  All in all , it was pretty good. It wasn't so amazing that I wouldn't be willing to try another place over it though. I'll probably update this review once I am more knowledgable on how one truly rates a good Chicago deep dish pizza.  TL;DR// I Second all other reviews about buttery, crispy crust. All in all, the flavors didn't amaze me and I'm still interested in trying other deep dish pizza spots in Chicago.",0.998,0.785,0.184,0.032,0.6155142496392496

We ordered The Malnati Chicago Classic and added olives. Mm extra cheese! The crust was crispy and golden, though I am not sure what buttercrust is supposed to taste like. My Chicagoan cousins think deep dish here is strangely watery. Honestly I like most pizzas, and I enjoyed my slice here. However compared to my first deep dish experience elsewhere, I would say that there wasn't as much substance here and the sauce did seem runny.  We also shared the calamari and BuffaLou wings. The calamari was a good starter. It is very breaded. I do not eat wings, so can't comment on the latter. VERY friendly and outgoing server.

This crust on their pizzas is really buttery & crunchy on the outside yet soft & not crazily breaded at the bottom. The sausage in the Malnati Classic is juicy & has a slight kick in terms of spicy. It's nicely complimented by the thick tomato sauce. And the crunch of the buttercrust does a good balance for your taste buds. If you're planning on sharing a salad, get the regular size. It's enough to feed about 4 people. Plus you save money! Try to beat the dinner rush. It does get really busy. And try to order your food before you get seated to save some time.

2014-09-16,4.0,"Listen, I'm an at-heart New Yorker who deeply loves her thin crust pizza more than most things in this world. But this does not mean that I can't appreciate good pizza in general. And Lou Malnati's makes good pizza.  I trekked by myself to their South Loop location based on the Yelp reviews, ordered a Malnati Chicago Classic, personal size, and a small house salad with red wine vinaigrette. As far as salads go, this one was the same iceberg lettuce salad you will find at any diner, or Denny's, or wherever you go that serves a cheap salad. It was fine - not offensive, but nothing special. As deep dish tends to do, it took quite a while to come out. Honestly, the service was pretty slow overall, but I wasn't in a hurry so it didn't matter. You may make note of this though if you ARE in a hurry.  As a fan of greasy pizza, I found the slight oil buildup from the cheese and the butter crust a welcome side effect of baking. I understand there are people who tend to dab the grease off the top of their pizzas with a napkin, and if you fit this description maybe real pizza isn't for you in general, but know that if you order what I ordered there will be grease and it will be plentiful. The ingredients were simple and tasty, and the ratio of cheese to sausage to sauce was perfect - the right amount of each in every bite.

The server served each of us a slice of pizza, it was hot and cheesy and amazingly good. It was very heavy, and filing. Not greasy at all. The sausage covered it completely, not like most pizza places where there is a sausage here or there, The cheese was thick and gooey, and the sauce was great.

They say you are either one or the other when it comes to deep dish here in Chicago, and I just moved here and tried Giordanos and then tried Lou Malnati's and the crust just wasn't up to par at Lou Manaltis and it wasn't as stuffed and packed with cheese and meat like Giordanos either. If I am going to eat deep dish pizza and take in all of those calories, then I want to take in as many as I possibly can!  Now, had I not ever had Giordanos, this place is still pretty good. We were able to get seated right away coming at 6pm on a weekday, but by the time we left, the usual long long long line and wait was here. So beware of that fact about this location in particular. It is a big restaurant, but obviously the demand is higher than the space they have, and it always takes a little while for the pizzas to cook since they are deep dish style. We didn't get any other food here at all other than pizza, so I can't speak to anything else, and the service also was fine, but really just not as exciting of a deep dish experience for me.

Their pizza is classic Deep Dish Chicago style pizza with enough dough to make the doughboy actually laugh instead of giggle. There are several TVs in the dinning area to enjoy some sports.

If there is a longer than usual wait, they will make a pizza, cut it into small squares and set it atop the counter for customers can enjoy while they wait - customer service at its finest!

After working myself up to not just run to Potbelly to work on my own potbelly, I ventured onto the street seeking something special. The doorman, who genuinely goes by the moniker ""Showtime"", assured me that Lou Malnottis was the place to go; the joint that made Chicago famous (never mind that World's Fair or any leading-edge architectural wonders).  Like any cheese-loving American, I've eaten enough pizza in my lifetime to feed Paraguay for a week. Some mediocre, some ranking among the best meals I've ever had, but never unbearable. This ranked somewhere at the bottom of the mediocre category. And to think; Chicago is famous for its deep dish pizza. I ordered a basic pepperoni and cheese single pie, and after waiting for almost an hour to sit and another 45 minutes to get the food, I found the sauce to be watery and tasteless and the meat was nearly missing.

It's been my experience in Chicago just in general that there are lots of lines and lots of waiting for food that's maybe 3 star quality.  The customer service was phenomenal. Super friendly & professional. Super informative. I felt like they were trying their best to make us, as customers, happy. Especially during huge rushes and tons of people standing around confused and agitated. Because there was a 45 minute wait JUST to be seated, we got it to go. The food came earlier than expected. We walked a few minutes to the hotel. Dug into the still hot pizza. One personal size. One the next size up for my husband.  We were starving so I ate the whole thing. My husband tried but he couldn't even get close to finishing his. Even as someone who was starving, I couldn't say that I loved it. The crust was great, very buttery. The pizza itself was fine, with basic marinara and chewy cheap mozz cheese. The main source of flavor in Chicago seems to be salt. Everything is seasoned with salt. EVERYTHING.  The tiny personal size is super deceiving . I thought, I can EASILY eat two of these if I can eat a whole medium pizza from Papa Johns. But after I finished it I was so full I couldn't move for an hour or two. I was full and I was SO THIRSTY.  I'll be honest. I think this place makes a super delicious 5 star pizza compared to places that are ONLY in Chicago and with judges who don't eat pizza except at Dominos, Papa Johns & Pizza Hut and think Olive Garden has good pasta. But if you pit them up against the best pizza in NYC or California, they would be at most a 3 star pizza.

Our pizza then came out!!  I was so excited!  We got half pepperoni and have of ""The Lou"" which consisted of fresh spinach, mushrooms and sliced tomatoes covered with a blend of mozzarella, roman and cheddar cheese on garlic buttercrust.  This LARGE pizza was $28.45.  We ordered the deep dish pan pizza.   This thing was huge that they serve it for you.  So if you are a foodie and like taking pictures, be on the look out for your pizza because they serve it for you.  I thought the pepperoni pizza was delicious but I wasn't to fond of ""The Lou"".

The problem with the pizza at Lou Malnati's is that it's not delicious.  Let's start with our appetizer. We had garlic bread -- or rather, pieces of a dry, half-burnt baguette with only a faint hint of garlic. The bread was stale, in desperate need of some olive oil or melted butter to resurrect it. Sadly, there was none to be found.  On to the pizzas. We split two personal pizzas, the only two on the menu that carry the restaurant founder's name: The Malnati Chicago Classic & The Lou. The former was blanketed with an absurd amount of sauce, and the crust and sausage were bland. The latter was watery (from the spinach and tomatoes), bland (lack of seasoning), and had an odd three-cheese blend (cheddar... really?). Neither calorie bomb was worth finishing.

2014-06-17,4.0,"Visited Chicago for the 1st time ever and based on a local's recommendation, I put Lou Malnati's on my ""to go eat"" places ... and boy was I happy with that decision! Right after I landed, my first stop was Lou Malnati's for lunch and what a great way to start my vacation. I got here on a Saturday at about 1pm, apparently just before the heart of lunchtime here because a huge line formed after I was finished at 2:30pm. I was well aware that there were many locations for Lou Malnati's, but as for this location it was quite a big restaurant, well-decorated and very clean. We got seated right away when we arrived and was greeted by a very friendly waiter. Since it was our first time here, we asked him for deep dish pizza recommendations and also the portion sizes. He told us the most popular toppings were sausage and pepperoni and that the small could probably feed 2 people, while the medium would be pushing it. Ultimately, we ordered the medium deep dish pizza with half sausage and half pepperoni (not realizing what we had gotten ourselves into). He also informed us that the wait for the pizza would be about 30 minutes, which is standard for deep dish pizzas. When the pizza finally arrived, it was an (Angel's singing) moment. Cheese was oozing on the top of it and it absolutely smelled out of this world! The waiter scooped one piece for me and one piece for my friend to start us off. The pizza was some of the best I've ever had! I'm a New Yorker and love NY style pizza, but it now has some serious competition! The cheese on the deep dish pizza was so thick and bubbly, smothered in a sea of red tangy marinara sauce. The toppings were plentiful and the breading on the pizza was crunchy. I'm usually not a fan of the breading and crust on NY style pizza, but I devoured the entire deep dish slices with no issue. The breading was so moist with flavor, yet crispy, kind of like a piece of garlic bread. It really held together well, considering all the cheese, sauce and toppings on it. The only regret we had was ordering a medium pizza because as we were completing our 2nd slices, it became obvious that a small could feed 2 people (considering how thick the pizza is). Basically a small pizza is 4 slices, while a medium is 6. In addition, we had ordered a combination platter appetizer so we wet our appetites a little too much. My recommendation is, if there's just 2 people at the table, don't order an appetizer if you plan on ordering a medium pizza, else do order an appetizer if you're ordering just a small pizza. Either way, it will hit the spot!",0.9891,0.873,0.098,0.029,0.47811511617634056

My waitress was very attentive and helpful. She pointed out how I could save money by combining some things after hearing me order items a la carte from the menu.  I also like that the restaurant provides nutritional information on its website.

I'm sorry to say that thjs pizza is only marginally better than Pizza Hut. Why? Because it's the INGREDIENTS, stupid. Why does Italy make the best pasta/pizza? Part of it is expertise but most of it comes from top tier mozzarella, tomato sauce and fresh toppings. I ordered the 'Lou' with spinach, mushrooms, tomatoes and mix of mozzarella, Romano and cheddar cheese. All these ingredients could have been bought from Trader Joes down the street. The mushrooms were likely baby Bella - run of the mill. Thank god the spinach was fresh, not frozen. The tomatoes were mediocre in quality certainly not San Marzano quality. The mozzarella supposedly comes from a dairy farm in Wisconsin but it had very little taste and no creaminess whatsoever. Adding cheddar cheese to pizza is also highly suspect. The crust was comically terrible. Flaky without any real chewiness or flavor or airiness. And this is 2014 - put olive oil on pizza not butter for god sake. To be clear, every pizza place does not have to use the best ingredients. But to call this the best pizza in your city? I'm stunned.",0.9799,0.769,0.166,0.065,0.6014630779848171

This was my first time eating an authentic deep dish pizza so my expectations were high. The crust was great and perfectly baked. It's a pet peeve of mine when the dough is undercooked but I didn't have that issue here :) the sausage comes as a patty that covers the entire pie rather than crumbled pieces of meat.

Prior to this, I really enjoyed the loop location of Lou Malnati's--the chocolate chip cookie dessert pizza was a favorite. However, after this incident, I have not (and will not) return.  A friend and I went in for lunch one day. We went in at 1 PM. My boyfriend was going to be joining us, but gave me his order to place along with ours so that he'd get his food at the same time as we did. He wanted a small pizza. We placed the order (I was having garlic bread, and my other friend was having wings). The waitress told us it would be a 15-20 minute wait for the pizza, and asked if that was alright. Of course, it was. My boyfriend had an hour for lunch, if he arrived in about 15 minutes as was expected, he'd have more than enough time to eat.  Well, he arrived 15 minutes after we ordered, but his food did not. The pizza took over an hour to get to the table. It arrived as he was getting up to leave. Not only did the pizza take that long to arrive, but the garlic bread and wings did as well. They were cold upon arrival, but the waitress wanted to bring everything out at the same time. The server was quite rude about this mishap, but not as rude as the manager--who was absolutely horrendous. The server explained that ""she had warned us that there would be a wait"" and ""we shouldn't have ordered it if we were on a time frame."" She then called the manager over, who very harshly and loudly explained that ""the waitress said there would be a wait, the pizza only took 50 minutes to get to the table--not slightly over an hour, and that it was my boyfriend's fault that he didn't get his lunch because he ordered something that would take a long time to cook."" Even though I did not ask for a comp, she told us that she would not be comping his meal because ""I could take it home for him and he could eat it later."" I'm a soft-spoken person and was polite as possible, but the way she spoke drew attention from other customers surrounding us. It was humiliating, and put a damper on our day.   I understand there being a wait on certain items during lunchtime, but saying something will be 15-20 minutes and it taking over an hour is unacceptable. If it's going to be that long of a wait, just say it will be that long of a wait. The situation could have been handled much more gracefully on the managerial side.  This is no longer a location that I recommend to friends and family. I have gone to another location once, and did not have an issue there.",-0.5153,0.867,0.066,0.067,0.5402611367127497

Even from the moment we walked into this packed restaurant & was told it would be an hour wait (which ordinarily would have made me walk right back out!) but we decided to stay and I'm so glad we did for I really wanted my family (especially my Dad for we're both die-hard fans of Chicago-style deep dish pizza!! Our favorite being Pizzeria Uno & Due but that has changed now!) to enjoy the Lou Malnati's experience!! While we waited, starvin' like Marvin, watching & smelling the awesome pizzas going past us, I thought I was going to faint from hunger then like manna from Heaven, the staff brought out a complimentary thin crust half cheese & half spinach pizza to keep our growling stomachs quiet; We were so grateful for their generosity! Then all of a sudden our table was ready:  45 minutes wait, not bad! That's because the waitstaff, managers, bussers, & hosts and hostesses were moving at lightening speed to clean off tables, reset them & get them filled with hungry customers! It was a pleasant sight to watch. As we sat down, the server already knew our order b/c when you first arrive, after giving the hostess your name & getting one of those buzzers flashing lights thingy that let's you know when your table is ready, you enter your pizza order to the cashier for it takes 30 minutes to make. We order the combo plate appetizer of mozzarella cheese sticks, breaded mushrooms, & cheese curds...which were all amaze-balls! Then the main event came to the table: a large Chicago Classic double sausage, mushrooms, & onions pizza! As we looked at the huge slice in front of us (I love how the servers cut the first slice for you!), we said our grace & dove right in...using a knife & fork of course! It was so good as I knew it would & my family loved it...they are now converted followers of Lou's just like I am for I haven't been back to Pizzeria Uno & Due since I tried my first slice of Lou's! But wait it gets better, after all this great food (we all had one slice only, that's all we could handle b/c they were so big!) the staff brought out their signature dessert which is a chocolate chip cookie baked into one of their small personal pizza size pan with French vanilla ice cream & whipped cream topping to wish my Dad a Happy Birthday!!

Both pizzas were really good.  The crust was really good as well.   The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it didn't blow me away.  The reason it didn't blow me away is because I've had deep dish pizza at Masa of Echo Park (in Los Angeles) and it was just as good, if not better.   I'm not sure whether to be disappointed that it wasn't way better than Masa, or if I should be extremely happy that I have an awesome deep dish pizza place 15 minutes from where I live.

2014-03-05,5.0,"I have to start by saying that I have never been a fan of ""Chicago Style Pizza"". Being from the south side of Chicagoland, I have always been way more of a thin crust guy. I am also a pizza snob, so much that my friends and family will not bring up the topic of pizza in conversation when I am around :(.  I currently live in Cincinnati, home of the worlds worst pizza. The only standards by which a Cincinnatian grades his (her) pizza experience is by price and how fast they can get it. So, having said all of that, I was traveling through Chicago last month, with a group from Cincinnati. They begged me to take them to an ""authentic"" Chicago style pizza place. I reluctantly agreed, but didn't know where to begin to find the best. I remembered Gino's and Uno's from many years ago (don't get me wrong, I like those places, but definitely NOT as much as, say a Dags thin crust). I called my brother and asked what he thought. Without hesitation, he recommended Lou Malnati's on State. So that is where we went. Atmosphere was good. Pizza took a while, which irritated a few of my Cincinnati travelers. Beer selection was nice and service was top notch, which kept most of our group occupied... and then the pizzas arrived. There were works of art. Really, they were beautiful. I was still a bit skeptical. These aren't pizzas, these are lasagnas or casseroles... My pie, which I was splitting with another traveler, was mushroom, sausage and green pepper. I would not allow any suggestions of foreign substances on my pizza, such as bacon, pineapple or sun dried tomato. I was convinced after bite one. The taste was as good as the presentation. This is one of the top five pizzas I have EVER eaten. I have craved Lou Malnatis ever since. Next time I am in Chicago, it will be my first stop! That is, after I pick up my appetizer on the way in. My Al's beef sandwich! Last thing. I saw a youtube video on Chicago pizza. I think it was John Stewart, or some other fool like him. The video rips on Chicago pizza. Calls it a casserole and not a pizza. Before Lous, I may have agreed with him. Not anymore. I am now on board with the whole deep dish idea! Hey John, try a Malnati's.

2014-02-10,2.0,"Tonight I finally tasted Lou Malnati's Pizza and I'm just not able to understand how so many people are ranting and raving on Yelp about its greatness. Although the pizza wasn't the best, the delivery was on time with a very nice driver, and the pizza was pipping hot when it arrived. These things are important and greatly appreciated, but it doesn't make up for the taste of the pizza.  The pizza ordered was The Lou which is the veggie pizza and a deep dish cheese, which were well presented. The pizza just couldn't help but taste ordinary, despite looking extraordinary. The Lou had a little flavor due to the spinach that taste as it was seasoned, but it wasn't plentiful. The Cheddar cheese was also unappealing it was more like extra fat because it adds nothing to the flavor of the pizza. The bottoms of the pizzas toward the middle are prone to sogginess. Cheese pizza was just as bland but it tasted better than The Lou. The sauce seems more like heated broken tomatoes than a flavorful pizza sauce.  Maybe it could just be the two items that were ordered and the pizza is better than what I've experienced.

2013-12-31,5.0,"While I have been fairly loyal to Giordano's every time I come to Chicago, I am never going to turn down a good deep dish pizza.  On a recommendation from a friend, we decided to head over to Lou Malnati's around lunch time on a Sunday. It was almost a mile walk from the hotel, but we enjoy the chilly weather and were fueled by the warming anticipation of delicious Chicago pie.  We arrived with ultra-precision timing. 5 minutes later and we would've been in the middle of a gigantic lunch crowd with a lengthy wait. Luckily, we only had a 5-10 minute wait. We pre-ordered our pizza, to keep our wait time down once we did get a table. Rather than make the mistake of ordering a medium stuffed Chicago pizza to split between two people, as we had horribly done at Giordano's a couple days prior, we intelligently went with the SMALL butter-crust, sausage and pepperoni.  Once seated, we ordered a caesar salad to split between the two of us. The salad arrived quickly and was quite delicious. It had plenty of creamy caesar dressing, tomatoes (different, yet awesome), shaved parmesan and crunchy croutons. It was a good Caesar salad! The pizza came as soon as we finished the salads and....GOOD LORD this pizza was INCREDIBLE! The crust, while still incredibly thick, was deliciously crispy. While differing greatly from the cake-like crust I had come to expect from Chicago pizza, I loved it. The cheese was gooey and stringy, the pepperoni was flavorful, the sausage was delicious. I questioned the sauce on this pizza at first, as it seemed to be pretty straightforward chunky tomatoes from a can, with little spice or enhancement. I guess I'm used to a thinner, smoother pizza sauce with lots of spice and flavor. The wonderful key to this pie, however, is a perfect balance of flavors and textures. The sauce perfectly compliments the crust, which perfectly compliments the toppings and cheese. While I was a loyal Giordano's fan any time I visited the city in the past, I can safely say that Lou Malnati's is now my go-to Chicago pizzeria.

2013-12-22,5.0,"I have been anticipating my first slice of Chicago Style ""Deep Dish"" Pizza for most of my adult life.  While keeping a calm outer exterior, I was giddy like a 8 year old on Christmas morning, as I walked into the doors of Lou Malnati's Pizzeria on the famous State Street a bit south of downtown Chicago. I've always despised thin crust pizza because I can eat crackers at home, the whole point of a pizza is the voluptuous crust, well, in my opinion. I ordered a couple starters, the calamari and Caesar salad.  They did not disappoint The batter on the calamari was light and crispy and seasoned perfectly which allowed the flavor of the squid to shine through. It was served with a chunky marinara-like sauce that had never seen the bottom of an aluminum can or the felt the quivers of a freezer. The Caesar salad included diced tomatoes and shavings as opposed to ""shredded"" parmesan cheese.  The dressing was fresh, flavorful and sharp as a good Caesar dressing should be, I filled my mouth forkful after forkful to hide my child-like excitement for what was to come next.  The waitress set a medium sized ""butter-crust"" deep dish pizza topped with homemade sausage, anchovies, black olives and onions. Yes, I said anchovies and I meant it!  While my first reaction was a sliver of disappointment on how ""runny"" the sauce looked atop this masterpiece,  this all dissipated as I took my first bite into my inaugural Chicago pizza. And for a moment I was speechless.  I couldn't find the hyperbole to capture what I was feeling, tasting and soon devouring. Strings of mozzarella cheese were hanging from the corners of my mouth, sauce slightly dripping from my lips, and I wasn't ready to really stop. I took a few more bites and fell madly in love with, yes, pizza.  While the toppings were fresh, bountiful and cooked perfectly, the star of the show was the crust. Every bite had layers of texture.  A nice crisp buttery outside and then a wonderful soft yeasty middle.  Mr. Malnati could have have put pickled pigs feet on that crust and I would've enjoyed it nonetheless.  Thank you Chicago and Mr. Malnati for this surreal, out-of-body, culinary experience.  I'm adding a star next to his bucket-list item of mine, a star because I will have to return and do it all over again.",0.9907,0.824,0.136,0.04,0.4854166666666668

So just enjoy it, enjoy the variety. Do you only eat one type of steak, or chicken made one way? Only roasted, but not fried.

Before you know it you'll need a fork lift to get you out the door.  As much as I'd like to rave about the pizza menu, my personal favorite is the Malnati's salad.

One suggestion would be to ask for the dressing on the side because some cooks tend to have a heavy hand. Overall, I love this place.",0.9957,0.748,0.242,0.01,0.4655092592592592

We started off with the Trio of Housemade Dips and Crispy Pizza Dough Chips : Roasted Garlic, Artichoke and Giardiniera-Topped Hummus. This was sooo good! The garlic was super strong, so the favorite of the day was the Artichoke dip, and the Hummus was a close second!   Ordered the Malnati Chicago Classic : 9in, Sausage, Extra Cheese, and Vine-ripened Tomato Sauce on Buttercrust. Delicious! Crust is perfect, slightly crunchy and crispy with a somewhat thin crust on the bottom. The sauce is very hearty and rich, with a slightly sweet taste. A bit on the watery side but still yummy!  Really wish the sausage had a bit more flavor, but they label it as a ""lean sausage,"" so that probably explains it. We showed up a little after 11am, so we beat the rush and the food came out quickly.

2013-10-04,2.0,"[Out-of-towner-review] Chicago, you let me down big time... I'm sure I'll be ridiculed, but everything around my experience was no bueno. Staying at the Hyatt for a tradeshow, left me with minimal food options close by. When a few employees suggested Lou Malnati's I decided I'd invest in the taxi ride and go try the myth, the legend...Chicago Deep Dish Pizza! Everyone failed to mention that there really isn't seating for one. So, with over an hour wait for a table, I wasn't going to take up an entire table for just myself. I decided to order it to go, already as waste of my taxi, I could have had it delivered. First fail. Keeping it simple, I ordered an ""Individual"" Cheese Deep Dish and their Chicken Cesar Salad to go. After paying for my meal, not cheap either, I was told it'd be about a 30min+ wait. So with no one to hang out, in a city I've never been, I saunter over to their neighbor 7-11. Grab some snacks and stuff for work, and head back to chill in their patio. Looking bum-esque with multiple 7-11 bags, I played on my phone while I waited. 45 minutes later, I have my order in hand and hailing a taxi back to my home for the week to devour this highly touted pizza! I went to open the box and somehow in transit everything has slid off the pizza. Weird thing is, I never tipped the box the wrong way, so I'm not sure how this even happened. Everything was cold, because I ordered it to go. All of the crust, the bottom and the sides were hard as rocks. Not just a little hard, like break your teeth hard. I was over after the 2nd piece. The cold flavor was okay, but it wasn't near the comparison that people rave about Chicago pizza! The salad was the only saving grace, it was huge - because it's meant to be shared or family style, not for a party of one. The dressing was good, which can make or break a salad. I ended up wasting about 75% of it, but at least it tasted well. I know my experience can be attributed to situational factors, which is why I'm willing to try it again. Their service was far from good, but I can see how stressful working here could be. Every seat was taken, the patio was packed, and there were two lines the entire time. I was just over it, but the food didn't help anything out either. I no longer believe the hype...",-0.9033,0.811,0.08,0.109,0.4925487012987013

The portions are pretty spot on... the 9"" is made for two people, which provides two healthy portions of extra thick slices of pizza for each person. The Classic is made with ""lean"" sausage. I mean, if the fact that it's lean sausage makes you feel any better about eating a huge pizza slice with lots of cheese and sauce... have at it! It was really good though, so all diets are out the window when you go to Lou's. And it seemed like the sausage was almost in patty form, spread across as a nice layer within the pizza slices. I really liked that instead of the small round sausage pieces that you usually find on a pizza. I went on a Sunday afternoon, within an hour of the store opening, so there was no wait. Normally, when I pass by Lou's it's packed. The restaurant was still full with happy customers when I was there (speaks to everyone's love of deep dish I guess!) but at least you won't have to wait during an off peak time.

We ordered the Malnati Chicago Classic and added garlic and mushroom. We were super hungry that night, so we also got the Chicken Louie. It's a mix of chicken, fettuccine, and cream sauce. Errm... Learn from our terrible mistake: stick with the pizza and forget the pasta. Our pizza was ready when we got there. However, they forgot to make our pasta. We had to wait an extra 10-15 minutes for that. Make sure they give you everything when you pick up your order.  The Malnati Chicago Classic was amazing! The buttercrust is definitely worth a try! The pizza was loaded with sausage, cheese, and tomato chunks in the sauce. The extra garlic and mushrooms added an extra burst of flavor. (Garlic always makes everything 1000x better!) The pizza was truly delicious. We were a bit overwhelmed with the deep dish style, but it was worth it! Don't overestimate your appetite. The pizza is super filling. A sad note about the pasta: it was tasteless and horrible. (But it DID come with garlic bread! That wasn't too good, either...) We had a bite of the pasta, looked at each other, and slowly pushed it away, in a silent agreement that it really, really wasn't the best. The cream sauce and fettuccine was an absolute miserable fail. The chicken was stale and really, did not contribute much to the dish. There were only a few slices tossed into the dish, anyways!

We ordered  calamari fritti, stuffed spinach bread, the lou deep dish pizza and the Chicago classic deep dish pizza.  The calamari fritti was fine not bad but not special. The stuffed spinach bread was not my dish, the bread outside was too thick for me but some of my friends love it. They love the fact that there were a lot of cheese inside. The Lou deep dish pizza was the one that I would definitely recommend to you. Usually I love pizza with meat, I mean who doesn't. But the lou was amazing.

I ordered that, the House Salad (which my server obligingly had chopped for me), and the Tilapia Piccata w/Sauteed Spinach and Mushrooms. Everything was hot, fresh, and tasty!

Luckily, I was only a quick 5 minute walk from Lou Malnati's. I will say that flat out, this was the best deep dish pizza that I've had. Then again, that's not saying too much considering the fact that I've been to only about 5 deep dish spots, but nonetheless, this takes the cake in my book. Right when I got here, I was blown away with how long the wait was. Being that I was by myself, I just figured that it'd be much faster if I just got my pizza to go and eat it at the park. Looking at the menu, I finally settled on ordering a small Malnati Chicago Classic ($15). This pizza comes loaded with a thick layer of cheese, fresh tomatoes, and a pretty hefty layer of sausage. The icing on the cake is the buttery crust. By myself, I could only eat 3 of 4 slices and portion-wise, this pizza will get you full, almost too full. With their sausage, it is literally a layer of sausage. Unlike other pizza joints where the sausages come in chunks, it looks like they just placed a sausage frizbee on top of the cheese.  The thing that I love best about deep dish pizzas are their crusts, and boy does Lou Malnati's do them right. It wasn't burned, nor with the undercooked doughy taste. In the end, I really wish that I had some more space in my stomach because it seemed such a waste to end up tossing half fo my last slice. There are tons of places on my bucket list that I need to try out here in Chicago, but I definitely was not dissapointed with Lou Malnati's. They serve up some mean deep dish pizza.

We ended up ordering calamari as an appetizer and a small deep dish sausage with butter crust.  I've never had calamari before and was a little apprehensive about ordering it from a (what I considered) random pizza place, but it was crispy, light, and utterly delectable.  It came with this marinara-type cocktail sauce which I also loved (and I hate HATE cocktail sauce).   As I said above, if I was given a choice between styles of pizza to eat, Chicago deep dish would probably be near the bottom of that list.  HOWEVER, Lou Malnati's might have changed my mind.  It's not super saucy and the sauce itself does not taste like sugar, which are things that automatically kill a pizza for me.  The cheese was thick but not unappetizingly so.  And the thing that NAILS it is the treatment of the sausage.  The sausage is not clumped on the pizza...IT IS ITS OWN LAYER!  GENIUS!  Every.single.bite.has.sausage.   I'm a fan.  I know there are probably endless places in Chicago for deep dish, but I would not feel sad if I never got to try any of these places.  Just get me some darn Lou Malnati's!",-0.8857,0.812,0.079,0.109,0.5894255050505051

When I was in grad school, my family mailed me the frozen pies. Long story short, Im a fan. I am in town at a conference and staying at the Hilton, so I picked up a deep dish cheese pie and took it back to the room. I opened the box and it looked perfect. With the sauce on top of the cheese, though, it is hard to tell. I always look at a take out pizza to make sure it isnt burned, has the toppings we ordered, etc.  Maybe I need to up my inspection game. There was too much cheese, and it almost seemed like the pie was a but undercooked. The sauce was a bit runny. Really disappointing. The last time I was in Chicago, I stayed further north and so ended up getting Giordonno's. Same routine (take out to the hotel) and IT WAS THE BOMB. Im not saying this to try to persuade you to go to G's. Rather, just that I dont think my bad pie was a result of the walk back to the room. Im guessing this might be a location thing.

2013-05-15,4.0,"For those of us who aren't from Chicago and think that ""deep dish pizza"" means a thick crust and lots of bready-ness...  WRONG.   Deep dish pizza is basically a pizza pie.  The crust is like a pie crust... on the thin side, buttery, crispy actually, and then it's pressed into a dish with high sides (dough pressed up the sides too) and then filled to the brim with sauce, cheese, and the toppings you opt for.  It's very heavy and greasy because of the massive amounts of cheese (and in our case, sausage... yum), not the crust.   We ordered the suggested one (I forget the name now, but I guess it's their signature one), and it was amazing!  I'm a thin-crust girl (and I mean crispy, tortilla thin), but I really enjoyed this.  It's still not my favorite pizza, but I'd never ever turn this away.   The amount of grease pooling above the grooves in the cheese, amongst all the sausage, was quite a sight.  Don't let that hinder you though.  It's a good grease to indulge in every now and then!  Make your tastebuds and belly nod in approval.  The grease sits in all the right spots.  It isn't the type of grease that is there for no good reason, y'know?   We ordered the one that feeds 2, and frankly, both of us would've been able to go for the one that feeds 1.  And I can put a lot of food down.  Managed to eat 3/4 of this pizza (most of it was me... oops), and barely had room for the complimentary chocolate chip cookie pizza (hotel coupon, thanks!).  It is awesomely good, but very sweet.  And the amount of ice cream they pile on it, is enough to feed an entire Kindergarten class birthday party.   The prices are decent... the ambiance is cozy and clean, and the service is extremely friendly.  Oh, if you get there and there's a wait list to be seated, they let you order your pizza before you're seated... so you don't have to wait too long once you do get a table.  Supposedly, deep dish pizzas take around 20+ minutes to bake.  I guess they don't want to leave their customers hungry, or, they just want you to leave earlier and free up a table.  Haha.  Nonetheless, nice of them to offer it.",0.9952,0.823,0.148,0.029,0.589455636955637

Count me in. We also added some spinach in there. It was gorgeous. The crust was probably my favorite part of the pizza, along with everything else. Loved using a knife and fork to eat the pizza, and made sure that I included a piece of the crust with each bite. The sausage was ridiculously good. It's not pieces of sausage, but rather a sausage patty that covers the entire pizza. So freakin delicious.

The server offered to place it in the over for me but when it came back, it seemed warmer but nothing else had changed. I just stuck to our fried appetizer (zucchini, mushrooms, cheddar cheese and mozzarella sticks) which also became very overwhelming because the order came with a mount of fried morsels to be dipped in either marinara or ranch.

2013-04-07,3.0,"I'm extremely partial to NY-style thin-crust pizza, but given that Chicago deep dish is also very popular, we decided to make stopping at a famous local shop one of our first orders of business in Chicago. Arriving shortly before noon on a Friday at Lou Malnati's, the dining room was almost empty - but it quickly filled up as we were there, speaking to the popularity of the pizza. The servers were very nice, kindly apprising us that the pizzas here take around 30 minutes to cook...so if you are looking to grab 'n go, you're going to be disappointed...but if you are hungry, definitely get an appetizer while you wait. I will say that I was a fan of the Chicago classic, which I got in the 6"" personal size. The crust is deeper, for sure, but it wasn't overly thick, which I appreciated - one of the things I don't like about thicker-crust pizzas is that they just take up a lot of real estate in the stomach, but the crust didn't come off as such, and I really like the buttercrust that was used. The combination of the sausage, tomatoes, and extra cheese (which I would definitely recommend, as it seems like the standard Chicago pizza here doesn't come with much cheese) really work well together to come together as a full meal. My fiancee was less impressed with her pizza, mainly because the regular crust isn't as good as the buttercrust, but also because there's a lot more tomato than cheese on the pizza, which ends up making it a bit soggy. We got the bruschetta while waiting; while the flavor was good overall, I did feel like the tomatoes overall are a bit on the watery side, which dilutes the flavor and freshness of the tomatoes overall. In short, Lou Malnati's is a nice introduction to deep-dish Chicago pizza. It's definitely a very solid choice if you're looking for standard deep dish pizza.

Now there is a ton of pizzeria around town, but this place has been around since the 1970's and is family owned.  Walking up to the pizzeria we were greeted with a crowd of people waiting outside as well as inside for a table.  Thinking to myself ""Oh great this is going to be a super long wait, I am kind of tired and hungry.""  We were greeted by the cashier who was a friendly and outgoing gal. She asked if we had been here before to which we both said no it's our first time.  The cashier warmly welcomed us, handed a menu over and said we could place our order with her so that when we were seated (which was less then 15mins) our food would be almost ready. Love, that idea! We started out with: Three-Cheese Bread: Giant French bread with three cheeses, a touch of garlic and dipping sauce. The Malnati Chicago Classic: Lean sausage, extra cheese, and vine-ripened tomato sauce on Buttercrust. We were seated towards the back of the restaurant, which was cozy for the two of us. There were a couple of plasma TV's around with the Summer Olympics on.  Our server was nice and delivered our food to us quickly. She made sure that we were happy throughout our stay as well.  Prices were not bad for this popular joint, the pizza was delish (it was my first time ever trying a Chicago style pizza) and I have to say that I do not think I will be looking at other pizza's the same way again! As for the Three-Cheese Bread, I could not stop eating it! I love garlic and cheese bread. If I had, my way I would make it part of every meal that I have! It was so good in fact, that Minh had to take the basket that it came in away from me otherwise; I would not have finished my pizza!

A couple of places recommended Lou Malnati's for authentic Chicago deep-dish pizza, so we decided to give it a try. I'm assuming that it's usually pretty busy during weekends and peak lunch and dinner times, but we came at an especially unfortunate time (the day of the Chicago Marathon), so our wait time around lunchtime was almost an hour. Luckily, they let you place your pizza order ahead of time so it's ready within minutes once you're seated. The restaurant has a very vintage, home-y feel, with lots of pictures of the owner and his family on the walls. I thought the amount of tables and seating was somewhat limited, especially given the popularity of the restaurant. But it's a nice, casual, laid-back atmosphere and would be good for families with children and large groups.  Thankfully, the deep-dish pizza did not disappoint! We tried the Malnati Chicago Classic, which comes with sausage, extra cheese, and tomatoes served on Buttercrust. We got the 12"" Medium, which serves 3, and comes with 6 pretty large slices. The pizza was mouth-wateringly good - super soft crust, lots of cheese, flavorful and extremely delicious! As their menu says though, this is definitely the type of pizza you need to eat with a fork and a knife - it will get messy!  Our waiter also recommended that we start out with the Stuffed Spinach Bread, which is stuffed with cheese, spinach, garlic, onion, and tomato and served with marinara sauce. The spinach bread was SO GOOD that I got it again the second time we went to Lou Malnati's a couple of days later. We also got the Chicken BBQ Club Salad to share, which comes with grilled chicken, tomatoes, mozzarella, cheddar and salami. The salad was REALLY good and they definitely didn't skimp on the BBQ chicken like some other salads do. To be honest, there were so many other ingredients in the salad besides lettuce that I didn't even feel like I was eating a salad. Despite the place being really busy that day, we still received really good service and we didn't feel rushed at all. Our waiter checked on us, brought our food out in a timely manner, and boxed up our leftovers for us quickly and easily. If you're in Chicago and looking for some authentic deep-dish pizza, I would highly recommend Lou Malnati's.

2012-11-05,5.0,"This was my first deep dish pizza experience in Chicago, and I was not disappointed at all.  We got here at 8pm on a Friday night, and was told there would be a roughly 20 minutes wait. While waiting, we were actually able to order our food beforehand.  After we were seated, we waited on our bruschetta and a ""medium"" sausage cheese pizza. The bruschetta came out fresh and warm, with just the right amount of garlic and oil soaked into the bread. The tomato topping was delicious, and offered a great balance to the warm bread.  We were pretty hungry, so we weren't actually sure how filling the medium pizza would be. When it was brought out, we were actually disappointed by the size. However, once we started digging in, we realized just how filling the thick crust was. I was done after basically one slice, but being a man, I managed to finish two.  What's great about their pizza is that despite having a lot of crust, there was enough melted cheese, tomato sauce and sausage bits to have a good ratio of topping to crust. I actually thought there was too much tomato sauce, but at least it's better to have too much than too little. The only issue i had with this place was that I wish they had a larger selection of pizza. I think they only have cheese and sausage. But then again, if it ain't broke, don't fix it right?

2012-10-04,5.0,"Lou's pizza can be summed up in three words: ""delicious, buttery crust"".  The pizza is excellent, by far our favorite deep-dish pizza in Chicago.   Toppings are good, plenty of yummy cheese, and that crust, oh that crust!  They run a very good operation by allowing you to order your pizza ahead of time which reduces the wait at the table.  Most recently we went on a Sunday night around 6pm, only a 15 minute wait for the table and our pizzas were there within another 25 minutes, not bad at all.  We also had a ""family size"" spinach salad which was quite good and a new addition to their menu.  It helps to balance out the sinful deliciousness of their pizza with some greens! By far the best pizza in town, it's consistently great every time we go!  If you are looking for a classic chicago-style pizza, this is the place!",0.986,0.768,0.211,0.021,0.6917424242424243

2012-09-16,4.0,"For most of my life, I have never been a fan of deep dish pizza. It was heavy and just seemed like too much dish for my liking. Give me a thin, crackly slice of New York style pizza and I'm much happier. However, a trip to Chicago could not be complete without trying the iconic food. And Lou Malnati's made me realize that I'd eaten ""deep dish pizza"" before but I had never truly had deep dish pizza. First, I really appreciate Lou Malnati's system of waiting for your table. Since the pizzas take so long to cook, while you're waiting for your table you can pre-order your pizza (put your order in and give them your wait time) which is ingenious. We ordered the Small Sausage, Well Done and got the Malnati Salad. The salad was great..it had everything right up my alley (salami, cheese, and a sweet tangy dressing) and was generously portioned. The pizza was delicious. My favorite part is that the sausage doesn't play a supporting role to the pizza with occasional appearances but makes its presence known with a entire layer. Ordering well done seemed to be a good balance between that crispy crust I like while also eating a deep dish. A small was plenty for 2 people. I don't think I would like deep dishes at other places because from what i've heard they're much thicker crusted and have much, much more cheese in their pies. Two aspects of deep dish I'm not generally found of. And so Lou Malnati's was the perfect choice for me.  This place seems to get pretty busy during dinner hour so if you come after 5 or so expect to wait for awhile.",0.9919,0.802,0.165,0.033,0.4971026592455165

2012-09-09,3.0,"Upon arrival, the process for ordering can be confusing and chaotic as heck, especially when the U. of Iowa Hawkeyes are swarming after a winning game. =P When you enter, you need to go to the tiny host/hostess stand on the left, NOT to the counter in front of you, to put your name on the list. The wait time was 45 minutes, not bad considering there were probably at least 50 people ahead of us waiting for the tables. This place really needs a bar/sitting area for those who wait (none available). The host will give you a menu and a buzzing device. You can place your order with the people at the counter so that you don't have to wait another 45 minutes for your pizza to arrive. I thought this was neat because it definitely cuts down on the amount of waiting time. Once we sat down, we probably waited about 15 minutes for the pizzas to arrive. We did order two large pizzas for the four of us, and it was WAY too much food. We probably should've ordered a large and a medium. So why the three stars? It just wasn't Gino's East where we've eaten before and also ate the next day. The sauce wasn't flavorful; I've no other words for this. The butter crust that people rave about really wasn't anything spectacular or different from what I can get in Houston. I also wasn't a fan of the sausage patty inside the pizza; Gino's East gives you a choice of crumbled sausage versus a sausage patty. The patty to me made it slightly more difficult to eat the pizza. I also think a patty doesn't emit as much grease compared to the crumbled sausage, and you need as much fat as possible for flavor. Although the system seemed to be more efficient than Gino's East or Giordano's, I prefer to wait longer for a tasty pizza. Of course pizza is an individualized preference, so I highly recommend you also try the other two Chicago style pizza chains for comparison. Good luck!",0.9549,0.885,0.082,0.033,0.46138624338624334

OMG, I could live on this. On the side, we ordered the Malnati salad, which was the perfect complement with a slightly sweeter taste from the house dressing. The combo of Gorgonzola cheese, salami, tomatoes, mushrooms and olives in romaine was a different twist to the typical Italian antipasto salad too.

Last time in Chicago (3 years ago), I had Giordano's.  That was outstanding (see profile pic).  I heard a lot of great stuff about Lou Malnati's Pizzeria.  I have to say-- good, not great.   First, my girlfriend and I were seated immediately during lunch on a Thursday.  We sat at a booth that had a table nearly chin-high.  I think it's meant to facilitate the rate that you can get the food into your mouth and limit any mess on your clothes.  Our server came over immediately, and took our order.  She warned us that the large garden/house salad was big, but I reassured her that I'm an elephant in human clothing.  I immediately regretted my decision upon receiving this salad.  For under $10 they brought out a trough with tongs. I can't believe we fit that much vegetation into our bodies.   As for the pizza, we ordered the Classic Chicago Special-- deep dish with roma tomatoes, sausage, and extra cheese.  This is where things went awry just a bit.  First, it says a 9"" pizza serves two.  I don't know who those two people are, but they must have stomachs the size of Chicago.  A 9"" pizza is easily enough for 4.  It was brought out hot and served table side-- nice touch.  The unfortunate news is that the pizza components were not evenly distributed.  That is to say, my girlfriend got most of the sauce and some cheese, and I got a half pound of mozzarella with some diced tomatoes.  She loved it. I couldn't stomach it, and took off at least half the cheese.  The crust was unbelievable, and the house-made sausage was scrumptious, too.   Bottom line: One star for service, one star for excellent pricing, and one star for great flavors.  Minus one star for a lack of execution (it was like eating two different pizzas), and minus one for not living up to the hype.  Maybe I'll have to give it another try when I visit again.",0.983,0.832,0.123,0.046,0.4730392156862745

Service:  Friendly and speedy.  Our waitress was very polite and our drinks never hit bottom.  With any deep dish pie, you have to wait 45 minutes for it to cook.  So, enjoy a beer or two while you wait.

2012-01-15,4.0,"So, I finally visited Chicago for the first time completely randomly. I was trying to go to Austin to visit a friend. But New York weather conspired to make me miss my connection from DC. Knowing that that would be the case we tried to rebook while still on the ground at LaGuardia. The service agent said that the way I could be in Austin at the earliest would be to overnight in Chicago and fly out in the morning. So we dialed up our friend in Chicago, got his OK to let us crash with him, and flew out to the bitter cold of Chicago, for which we had NOT dressed or packed for properly -- the weather in NYC had been great. Besides being able to see our friend, we decided to make the jaunt to Chicago worthwhile by getting some deep dish pizza. After wrestling with my data connection on the plane and on the subway, we finally decided that the best place to go to that was on the way to our friend's apartment in Hyde Park was the Lou Malnati's in the South Loop. Exiting into the biting, below-freezing cold from the subway we frantically Google Mapped to get our bearings (as quickly as possible to prevent our fingers from falling off) and finally found our way to State St, hauling our overnight bags. So picture the scene when our frozen asses stumble into Lou Malnati's -- obviously underdressed, cheeks flush with cold, and carrying baggage. The first thing the host says to us is ""Man, you guys look cold."" Luckily, as it's around 9:30pm by now, we are seated promptly in a booth. We decided to order up the medium-sized Malnati Chicago Classic so we'd have leftovers for our ass o' clock flight the next morning. And... when we bit into the pie almost 20-25 minutes later (they do take a long time to bake), the whole experience had been worth it. Gooey mozzarella cheese that stayed gooey long after most pizzas congeal. The delicious butter crust. And the Italian sausage, best I have had in a very long time. I started characterizing my bites as crust bites, cheese bites, herby sauce bites, and sausage bites -- the individual flavors were so well defined. Now, the sauce was a tad bit watery for my taste, but I think that is a trademark of traditional Chicago style pizza. It was A-OK since it was so flavorful. The gift kept on giving. After roughly 4 hours of sleep after some late night events with our Chicago-based friend, we got up to go back to the airport and grabbed the takeout box from the fridge. When we finally got back on the subway we opened it up -- still good. The crust, still respectably crispy. The cheese finally congealed but what do you expect? Lou Malnati's pizza. Good hot. Good cold. Good in the cold. You know, most people try to do normal tourist stuff if they've got a couple hours: see a museum, take some pictures of the skyline.

I'm personally not a big fan of deep dish pizza, but since I was in Chicago, I had to get a taste of Chicago's deep dish pizza vs. the ""Chicago style"" pizzas we have in the Bay Area.  Being that I wasn't familiar with the area, I turned to Yelp and was interested in two places.  While texting with a friend who had came to Chicago earlier this year, he recommended that I go to Lou's because he loved it.

FOOD: *Buffalou Chicken Wings ($7.95) - Delicious!  Even though I took the food to go and had about a 10-15 minute walk back to my hotel, the chicken still had a slight outer crisp and a good balance of spiciness.  You have the option of ranch or blue cheese as dipping sauce.   *Personal Chicago Classic w/Mushrooms & Garlic ($8.35) - oh my goodness...soooooo delicious!!  The Chicago Classic is the house specialty and a must try!  It traditionally contains sausage, cheese, and a tomato sauce which was less like sauce and more soft pieces of ripened tomatoes.  I did decide to add mushrooms and garlic like I usually do and they didn't skimp on the toppings.  The best part of the pizza was the savory buttercrust which did not get soggy (even when I had the leftovers in the morning).   Lou's does have thin crust and pastas available to order, but I definitely recommend trying one of the deep dish pizzas.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it!",0.9949,0.841,0.154,0.004,0.4704761904761903

The saving grace was the fact that A) there was no wait at 8 pm on a Sunday night and B) the Pizza wasn't that expensive.  We went with basically the same set up we got at Gino's East. Beer, cheesy garlic bread and a pizza. First off, they don't have any beer on tap, it's only bottles, which was a disappointment. When I think pizza, I think pizza and beer. We would have probably had a couple pitchers if they had them! So we had some of the Goose Island 312, which was good,but it's MUCH better on tap. We ordered the ""Malnati Chicago Classic"" which included their house specialty sausage and famous butter crust. Sadly, I wasn't impressed with either. There was a lot of cheese, but even the cheese wasn't very good. Also, the crust was oddly crunchy, like a cracker. The cheesy garlic bread was pretty bland too. We loved the cheesy garlic bread at Gino's East, but the stuff here was not very good.

So good but wish I skipped that bread and shoved a second slice into my belly! The second visit was towards the end of my trip so my waistline was begging for mercy. I chose the Lou Malnati signature salad, medium of course, and told myself the salami crumbles didn't count. My friends had the pasta, the lasagna, and the Caesar salad.

2011-08-07,1.0,"I just don't get it with Lou's. So many people swear it to be the best pizza on earth. I actually think it to be average or possibly even below average which is hard for a pizza to do. It's hard to make a bad pizza but I believe Lou's is close to that. I've given Lou's plenty of chances throughout the years and always end up getting dragged there by someone. I've probably been to at least six or seven different Lou Malnati's locations. Lets start with the base of the pizza which is the crust. The much hyped butter crust is bland and almost tasteless. Why they charge a little extra for the butter crust is beyond me. I can't  hardly taste the difference between either. The cheese, or lack thereof is lacking is both taste and quantity. A cheese can make or break a pizza and in Lou's case, I believe it breaks it. Maybe if they put more on or something it would help, but I think the cheese itself is lacking overall flavor. The veggies. If you like veggies on your pizza, Lou's are again.....just average at best. They neither enhance nor detract from the overall taste of the pizza. The sauce. Again, average to below average. If I watch another pizza show on TV with Mark Malnati mentioning how great his tomatoes are, I'm going to vomit. Sorry Mark, but your tomatoes are bitter and lack the fresh taste you keep talking about. I've had fresh tomatoes and I've had great sauce on a pizza and yours are neither of those. Ok, lets move on to the meats, which I believe are the back breaker for a Lou's pizza. The pepperoni. It's really hard to screw up pepperoni. Really hard but Lou's did it. I'm not sure what it is that gives it that unpleasant-like taste. Maybe it's too spicy. Maybe it's too thickly sliced. I don't know but it just doesn't taste like a good pepperoni should tatse. Now the worst part of a Lou's pizza. The dreaded Lou's sausage. Never in my life have I encountered such a foul tasting and smelly sausage as Lou's. Sausage is my favorite ingredient on a pizza and this one is the worst. If you must get a pizza from Lou's, get it without the sausage. And if you must get a sausage pizza, either eat all of it, or leave it there. Lou's sausage will stink up your car, fridge or house for days if you take it with you. I don't know what they put in it, but I've never had any pizza stink so bad like a Lou's with sausage. It makes me a little sick just thinking about it while typing this out. They seriously need to stop having Lou's on any type of food shows representing Chicago pizza. I believe it gives Chicago a bad name in the pizza world. There are so many far better choices out there for pizza. On another note, I do love the Manati's salad. Their sweet vinagrette dressing is awesome.

When we entered the blonde hostess said the wait was around 30 mins which was by us. after 15 mins we decided what we wanted and pre-ordered and got our drinks.

We noticed that the manager and brunette kept telling other patrons to pre-order. The blonde hostess just gave us the buzzer and I don't think even she wrote my name down on the notebook because my name was not on the list.  The manager again made up for it.

You know, just to rub in the guilt after downing multiple slices of cheesy deep-dish goodness. A pizzeria is always a great place to bring a big group of people because you can just order a bunch of pies and everyone will have something they like. Since we all wanted to try something new, we got four individual pan pizzas. At $5.50 this is a ridiculously delicious and filling bargain! Toppings cost extra though, so they can add up quickly. At lunch time you can get a special that includes a personal pan, side salad, and can of soda for only about $7. When you order a pizza the waiter will ask something like, ""Would you like to-"". At that point you should just cut him off and say YES because he is talking about adding the butter crust option to your pizza. Indulgent golden, buttery thick crust. Seriously, it is 50 cents extra, just do it. You think the pizza on the header of this page looks good? This is even better! Be prepared to wait at least 30 minutes as all pizzas are made fresh to order. For starters, i recommend the spinach bread.

I usually order carry out because I live near by and I've never had to wait over 40 minutes of my pizza, which is great considering how insanely busy this place can get on weekends.  Plus they just expanded the restaurant so I can only assume that the kitchen is getting even more overloaded on orders. The quality is always top notch and the staff is extremely friendly.  The only reason I knock off a star is because I'm a big fan of different kinds of beer, especially with pizza.  Lou Malnati's doesn't claim to be a bar in any way shape or form, but their beer list is just too limited FOR ME (on days when I do sit down and eat inside).  If I wasn't so picky about my beer, this place would easily get 5 stars from me, and should from most others, for sure.",0.9836,0.855,0.136,0.01,0.5084415584415585

2011-06-02,4.0,"After seeing too many Food Network / Cooking Channel / Travel Channel shows featuring the competition of Chicago-style deep dish pizzas at Pizzeria Uno and Lou Malnati's, my girlfriend and I decided that we should engage in the discussion as well and visit both locations.  We agreed that we would get one fried appetizer dish, one medium deep-dish pepperoni pizza, and soda. (Dessert only if we felt we could truly handle it.) So here's the experience at Lou Malnati's (our first stop of the two): We arrived around 4:30pm, which we hoped would be early for the dinner crowd and we were pleasantly surprised to see no wait and we got to go straight to a table.  It didn't take too long before we got to place our drink order, and for the appetizer, we went with the sampler.  Because if they offer enough fried foods that you can offer a sampler of the majority of them, that's the best bet if you've never been there before.  We placed our order for the pizza as well. It didn't take too long before our appetizer arrived.  There were breaded mushrooms, which my gal won't touch.  I ate them all and found them to be pretty average on the scale as far as breaded mushrooms go.  Actually, they ranked pretty high, as I've never apparently had a REALLY GOOD breaded mushroom.  The breaded zucchini was delicious.  She'd never had a breaded zucchini before, and I think she liked 'em.  The cheese sticks were okay, but the crowning acheivement of fried-dom were the little fried cheese cubes.  Great cheddar taste, melts in your mouth, just beautiful overall. I mostly used the ranch dipping sauce, as the marinara felt a little chunky to me.  I'm not a fan of tomatoes at all.  I can stand most applications of tomato, including ketchup and pizza sauce, but if there are chunks of pure tomato, I lose my appreciation quickly. The pizza arrived as we were finishing up the appetizer, so that was nice timing and I guess a pretty good speed for deep-dish pizza.  Our server dished out the first two slices, and we dug in.  The pepperoni had a nice flavor; good level of crispiness around the edges.  It had a good amount of cheese, I suppose, and not too much sauce. The sauce, however, did have chunks of tomato in it.  I picked out some of the larger, easier-to-catch culprits, but I didn't let it ruin my overall dining experience.  I have to say that the butter crust was superb.  It takes a lot to get me to eat my crust, especially when a deep-dish pizza contains so much of it.  I didn't even need to slather it with extra pizza sauce to make it palatable.  Though a little bit made the flavor that much better. Three full slices with crust apiece and we were full.  No room for dessert, unfortunately. I like that despite the fact that we could see the line growing in the front room as more and more people were waiting for tables, we never felt rushed while we dined.  It was a wonderful experience and we'll likely be back to try out more of the menu (which is surprisingly large for a ""Chicago Pizza Joint"") and maybe one of the specialty pizzas.  We just wanted to be fair between competitors and get a pizza that would be equal at both, and I loves me some pepperoni. So yes, we'll be back.  And despite any results of the competition, we'd recommend this place to out-of-towners and the like (as long as you time your visit so you don't need to wait in the giant line).",0.9984,0.804,0.173,0.022,0.5675038402457758

Familiar atmosphere- amazing corn meal crust but the pizza guts were very disappointing.  The cheese was not the quality that we expect and the overall favor was lacking.  I think that SF deep dish places like Zackery's (East Bay) and Little Star (SF) have started to dominate because of the high quality of their products.   I thought it was possibly because I am just not a fan of the deep dish (dd) but my dd hub agreed with my review.  A few days later we gave Gino's a try (see that review).  I reached  my quota for DD for the entire year at the begiining of February.   People were waiting for tables and the restaurant was full of happy people stuffing themselves.  It is possible that we are just the odd balls or just spoiled by living in California.  Maybe a bit of both.  Curious what others from SF think about this place",0.9804,0.799,0.16,0.041,0.5237499999999999

We came in on a busy Friday night, and waited about 30 minutes for our table (though they said it would be around 60 minutes, so we went to another bar to get drinks, and then had to chug which left me a little tipsy).  Our deep dish, which they said would take an hour, took more like 90 minutes... which was fine, except that I was drunk and starving. We got two larges for 6 people, and ended up with wayy too much pizza.  Fortunately the leftovers landed at my place and I enjoyed oven-reheated pizza for the next couple days.  I really like their crust, compared to Gino's East at least - it's crispier and more buttery, without feeling like you're eating some cheese on top of a bread-like brick. Anyway, we had fairly attentive service and enjoyed the very crazy hair on one of the bussers.  My visiting amigos, who had never had proper deep dish, enjoyed it, which is all I can ask for.",0.9443,0.813,0.132,0.055,0.5259259259259258

2010-08-17,4.0,"I've been eating Lou Malnati's deep dish pizza since I was a kid, it's one of the best Chicago style pizza's around.  The original location, in Lincolnwood, by far has the best pizza in this chain.  It has something to do with the ovens or something - the crust is just better and crispier.  But I do not live in Lincolnwood, so when Lou's in the South Loop opened I was a happy camper (although their Wells Street location is really not that far either). There's not a whole lot to say other than it's traditional Lou's pizza, not quite 100% as good as the original location but still pretty darn good.  Don't even think about getting thin crust - go somewhere else for that - deep dish is the only pizza to order here.  I recommend either the sausage or Lou's (vegetarian option), both are wonderful.  The ""sauce"" is one of the elements that make this pizza so good - it's simply stewed tomato's - so good and fresh.   Last time I was there I tried something called the Malnati Classic (I think) - I don't know if it was new or specific to this location, but I had never seen it before...  Basically it's a sausage deep dish with a butter crust and extra cheese.  I love cheese, I didn't think it was possible that there could be too much cheese on a pizza , or too much of a good thing, which is why I wanted to try this one.  But I was wrong - there is such a thing as too much cheese, it just wasn't balanced out by the rest of the ingredients.  Stick with the regular sausage or Lou's. For salads, the Malnati is amazing with their sweet vinaigrette.  The smaller size is perfect for 2-3 people.

This pizza certainly has potential, because the toppings are amazing.  The Lou's is loaded with vegetables, from tomatoes to spinach and a number of other vegetables.  Adding the sausage was a good move to get some protein on this pizza.  The problem I had here was the crust - the waitress said it was supposed to be a crispy crust (as they are known for that), however, my friend and I could barely chew the crust.  My friend had the pizza from here before and said it was harder than usual.  I don't mind a crispier crust, but when the entire pizza is difficult to cut up, I had to demote this pizza a few stars down.   I hope to be back here again to try it out, and hoping to not be disappointed by the deep dish crust.  However, that was certainly strike 1 against Lou Malnati's.  Time to try the other pies in this city.",0.9475,0.832,0.128,0.041,0.4475033068783069

I always found deep dish pizza back home to be too thick, too doughy, and not at all delicious. Considering Chicago is well-known for its deep dish pizza, I was excited to see how it's really done. I sat down at Lou Malnati's, and waited for my pepperoni personal pizza. The menu warned of a 30 minute wait, but I'm going to assume that is for normal sized pizzas, since mine arrived in a prompt 15 minutes. When I first bit into this, I realized that I only hated deep dish pizza, because I never had true deep dish pizza. This was incredible! The crust had a great crunch to it, a buttery taste, and it melted in my mouth. The cheese was so gooey that I found myself having to break the strands with my bare hands. They were right to suggest a knife and fork. The sauce on top works so very well. You get more of it, and everything stays put. No cheese sliding off, no sauce oozing out. Speaking of the sauce, it was hearty and fresh. The pepperoni was also under the sauce, but on top of the cheese, and was also delicious. My girlfirend had the cheese personal pizza, and was just as amazed.

It lacks both high food quality and good service. I should've known what I was in for from the moment I called to place my order for PICKUP. I had to give the order taker my name twice and telephone number twice and towards the end of the call was told the pizza would be DELIVERED in an hour.  I had to correct the order taker and asked if she meant it would be ready for pickup in an hour? She then said, ""actually it will be ready for pick up in 30 min""... Then, I got to the location and parking was terrible, I drove around for about 10 min before finding a spot. There should be a reserved area in front for patrons picking up orders (like the river north location). So I finally pick up my thin crust and deep dish pizza, get home excited as can be to eat what is typically delicious lou's pizza, but to my surprise I got 2 extremely soggy and messy pizza's!  Slices from both were falling apart in my hands.  I don't know what the cooks did wrong, they either left too much tomato juice in the sauce, didn't cook the pizzas long enough, or piled on the butter/grease...Maybe it was a combination of all three, not sure.  I definitely won't be back at this location, I mean I would've gotten past the unfocused service had my pizza's been their typical deliciousness, but this location is mis-representing what's supposed to be top notch pizza.  For some phenomenal legitimate Lou's pizza try the river north or lincoln park location.",-0.2736,0.85,0.083,0.067,0.5517145593869732

He seemed dead-set on claiming New York style as far superior to our gooey, corn-mealy gardens of tomato, and I needed him to know that was impossible. I was resting a lot of trust in the hands of this particular branch of the fast-growing chain, but I sincerely thought they could exemplify the tradition better than Uno's or Due's. Something about those places has rubbed me the wrong way since I sampled their franchises in Boston and San Diego and tasted the greasy, stomach-ache-causing standard recipe they've shipped out to all corners of the country. If that's what they think is acceptable to serve as an ambassador to our city, then I don't really want to fuel that fire with my hard-earned money. Even if the pies they serve in Chicago aren't as offensive as elsewhere.  Rant aside. Could this South Loop Lou's pull it off? I didn't have the guts to ask afterwards. I can tell you that their french fries were certainly up to snuff, and the buckets of Goose Island 312 are a nice touch when you're trying to show Chicago off to someone. The pizza was definitely better than My Pi's, but it wasn't necessarily as good as what I've had at the loop Uno's either.  I'm going to have to seriously rethink my pizza rankings now, and reassess where I take guests. I liked having a unique place, not a place people had seen at malls nationwide. But alas.

First off, if you're going to be remotely near the Loop and have something on the menu called 'Lunch Express Meal' then please have more than one waitress in the whole restaurant - she was sweet but we had to hussle back.  It took forever for her to take our order and then forever for it to come out. The salad, eh.  It was salad with a decent vinaigrette dressing and a TON of small, tiny tomatoes.  The pizza I was not enthused about.  I think the big chunks of tomatoes in the sauce kinda threw me off.  I thought it was pepperoni at one point and got quite the surprise biting into it.   The girl looked so strangely at us when we're throwing our credit card at her to ring us up pronto.  Really though, Loop lunch place this is not.  Unless you like scarfing down your food and literally running back to your office...then by all means.  If I go again, I'll make sure I have more time and will not get the ""express"" lunch, that they so loosely termed.",0.7372,0.874,0.075,0.051,0.40830558330558336

2009-03-25,5.0,"I've reviewed many other Lou locations.  I got very excited when this new location opened 50 feet from my back door. The cooks in the South Loop didn't disappoint me! This is by far the best Chicago Deep Dish pizza. It is very refreshing and not overly stuffed with cheese. This is the main problem I have with some other people's favorites like Gino's, Uno, and Giordano's. TOO MUCH CHEESE.  Lou's pizza's are stuffed with fresh veggies and great tomatoey sauce.  DEFINITELY get the Malnati Salad to start with.  GREAT!  My favorite pizza is ""The Lou"" with sausage, deep dish.  We've also gone for the low-fat cheese lately, which I think cuts down on the liquid content of the pizza.  The thin crust is also very good.  I can never resist partaking of a crisp Barq's root beer.  The flavor compliments the pizza amazingly.  If you don't stuff yourself, get the cookie and ice cream at the end. WOW. They have a great deal on weekdays. You get a pitcher of soda, a salad, a large pizza, and dessert for $30.00. This is amazing and too tempting! They also have a nice lunch special as well!

Having said all that, the pizza is very good.  Their butter crust is top notch and the ingredients for the most part are spread pretty evenly.  The Lou special is one of my favorites, as well as the standard spinach.",0.9376,0.807,0.148,0.045,0.46953968253968253
2009-01-29,4.0,"Thanks Gous for Chicago Style Pizza. I thought they said Illuminati also, but I was fooled LOL Lou I must say is the best Chicago deep dish that I have had since I came to the great city. Their pizza's are like pies with a tasty butter crust. They only have two types of meat, Pepperoni and Sausage, but when it comes to the taste of the pizza, that is all that you need. Their thin crust is also.  The best thing about lou MaInati's is that they place their tomato sauce on top of the pizza, which has been soaking in some type of wine or beer. The butter crust and the also the delivery service is fast and efficient. I am not to sure about Lou MaInati's outside of the city, but the one downtown....MAGNIFICO!!!",0.9851,0.751,0.213,0.037,0.5449074074074074

The sauce tasted a little weird, and the crust was not quite right.  I'm no pizza snob by any means, so yes, the food was edible, and I'm sure there are other things on the menu besides pizza.

2009-01-17,4.0,"The Illuminati make pizza? I'm in Chicago for work and I wanted deep dish pizza. I mean, it's Chicago ... what else would I really, really want enough to brave the ridiculous cold weather this week in order to pick up?* So when I asked around the booth at the convention for the best place to find some deep dish goodness in what I've found is called the South Loop area, I thought I heard Illuminati as the response. I don't know if it's because everyone here sounds like they're right out of Fargo, but it took two or three repetitions to find out that the place they were suggesting is actually this one. The pizza itself was great. I made the huge mistake of assuming that a medium pizza hadn't been Midwesternified and was something one person could eat, but the part I could actually eat was fantastic. When it got to the hotel, it was still absolutely piping hot (shockingly, compared to New York delivery) and the box was really clever, making sure that everything stayed where it was supposed to.** I ended up getting sausage and onion and was pleased with the amount of toppings included. They offer cans of soda and six packs as well, but no two-liter bottles. If you need napkins or plates (as you might be staying at a hotel like I am), make sure to ask for them. The only thing I would have liked was a little more flavor. The sauce and cheese really didn't offer anything and the crust was a little stiff as opposed to the doughy kind I like, but that doesn't make this bad by any stretch of the imagination. And, for the love of all that's holy, if you're ordering for one, make sure to get the small. * - Apparently y'all think ahead on how cold it can possibly be and made sure everything's available via delivery. I appreciate this and, if I lived here, would have to have a gym in my building because I'd never leave my building between December and March. ** - You shouldn't end sentences with a preposition, says my grammar teacher mom.

The pizza sauce it very well seasoned and fresh. For deep dish this is my favorite. For stuffed pizza, Giordano's is the best. The two types are actually pretty different, so it wouldn't be fair to compare. The deep dish has a thicker bottom crust. There also isn't another layer of dough on top. Stuffed also has more cheese it in. So when I'm in the mood for a little bit of a lighter pizza, I go for deep dish, but if I'm going all out fatty, bring on the stuffed pizza.",0.8971,0.862,0.127,0.011,0.5511904761904762

I've always appreciated that you can get the individual-sized deep dish  throughout the day and not just at lunch.
