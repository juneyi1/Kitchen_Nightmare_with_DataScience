2017-08-20,5.0,"5 stars for the bread basket but 4.0-4.5 for the rest (based on one visit on the Osteria side - there's also a pizzeria side) My husband and I came to Chicago for a mini-moon and this was one of our first stops for dinner, recommended by a colleague as one of their favorite restaurants in Chicago. We sat outside - the ambiance was perfect and the drape lighting was romantic. There happened to be a street singer/keyboardist on the other side of the street which put the icing on top of the cake in terms of a perfect date night out. The bread basket was the best bread basket I've ever had period. It was warm, perfectly toasted, and the inside of the bread was full, perfectly soft and chewy. The olive oil with pieces of mushroom - SO GOOD. I could have ate the bread basket for a meal and called it a day. For appetizers we ordered the octopus - my husband loved this. It was very tender and not rubbery at all (which I personally find strange since I expect my octopus to have a slightly chewy texture, but that doesn't seem in vogue). It was VERY oily. Sitting in 1 cm of oil. But he liked it. I ordered the seasonal market risotto which happened to be sausage risotto with snap peas. It was flavorful, al dente for sure, but slightly salty and heavy. I wished there were more snap peas to lighten the dish, and the sausage pieces were very small. My husband ordered Chicken Mario which had a delicious crispy layer and was tender/perfectly cooked on the inside.  Overall, we really loved our experience here and would come back in a heart beat the next time we're in Chicago.

2017-07-31,5.0,"A friend wanted to bring the guys out for dinner at one of his latest finds for good Italian food, so we made the trip to the city to give it a shot. The restaurant is located in/next to Embassy Suites, but do not let the location fool you, this is not your typical hotel restaurant. They had a very nice but crowded sidewalk seating area, we preferred to sit inside and were led through the bar and into one of a few back dining rooms, which were spacious, nicely decorated and had beautiful brick arches that made it seem like we had just walked into Italy! My brother and I split a Caesar salad, we liked it and thought the portion size was just right to split. I really enjoyed their bread and oil, plus the (roasted?) garlic cloves they give with it. I had a glass of wine from the northwestern Piedmont region, which was nice and dry, flavorful, and enhanced by probably the biggest bulb on a wine glass I've ever seen. Each of us ordered our own dinners. I had the short ribs with a side of pasta cacio e pepe, my brother had the wild mushroom ricotta cavatelli, friend 1 had chicken Mario, and friend 2 had a meatloaf special. Everyone thought their food was fantastic! The pastas are all clearly handmade, cooked perfect al-dente and were super flavorful. The last time I had cacio e pepe was in Rome last summer, and I was very impressed at how close Osteria Via Stato's was to what I remember having. Spot on! My short ribs were also delicious. Perfectly melt-in-your-mouth tender with a nice zing in the wine sauce, as well as the potato puree on the bottom. I've had quite a few amazing short ribs, and while this one isn't #1, it is definitely towards the top of the list. The service was another high point of our dinner. Although it did take quite awhile for us to get our food, we were in no hurry and our server, whose name escapes me, took good care of us as well as was engaging and even a little witty and funny to our group of 4 younger guys. All too often servers are too quiet, and sometimes even too talkative, but this was perfect. Overall we really enjoyed our dinner at Osteria Via Stato. It is a straightforward place with a simple in a good way menu, high quality ingredients and good service. It isn't exactly inexpensive, but many choices are very reasonable, and they have an interesting family style prix fixe option as well. A nice, easy option for quality River North Italian food without splurging. Will be back for sure!",0.9994,0.709,0.278,0.012,0.5873029100529101
2017-07-24,5.0,"""When life gives you LEMONS make LIMONCELLO."" According to Osteria Via Stato. This is exactly what everyone who attended the Limoncello Course at Osteria Via Stato did on July 22, 2017!  Participants learned how to make limoncello ""the Italian way.""  The course highlighted the restaurant's Chef David DiGregorio's 'cello program which is seasonal and highlights various fruits and ingredients which are infused with grain alcohol or Vodka at their peak. There were approximately fifty people in attendance and the course was $20.00 per person. The course provided an informative history of Italian limoncello production from the regions of the islands of Capri, Ischia, and Procida; the Sorrento region; and the Amalfi Coast.  The course was based upon Osteria Via Stato's house made recipe and tasting the process of limoncello as it evolves over time.  All participants also received a complimentary recipe card and a generous sample of house made and creatively bottled limoncello to take home. Participants were seated at tables and learned the steps of successfully peeling the skin from lemons ensuring not to have any pith or the white part of the lemon rind in the peeling process.  Participants then were walked through the process verbally and tasting wise with the production of limoncello.  Participants tasted what the process was like at three days, one week, and finally the finished product. Upon the completion of the course about limoncello preparation, the class was provided with tasting samples of seasonal raspberrycello and chocolacello.   The course was lead by Wine and Beverage Manager Matthew Dolin.  Mr. Dolan gave a thoughtful and informative introduction and overview of the process after which he circulated around to all of the tables engaging in pouring the cellos and interacting and answering all questions by participant guests.  Mr. Dolin also stated that this was the second year that Osteria Via Stato has held this course and that it is open to the public. I wish they would offer this course on a more regular basis as they make other seasonal cellos such as blood orange cello and grapefruit cello which would be fun to sample. The cellos (Limoncello, Chocolacello, and Seasonal Cellos) are available on the Osteria Via Stato Dessert Menu at the restaurant listed under the ""Digestivi & After Dinner Drinks"" under the section of ""House Made Liqueurs.""   Truly a magnificent and unique concept for a Chicago Italian restaurant to make house made limoncello and other cellos and to invite the public in to learn about and enjoy ""the fruits of their labor."" FYI-Fun Facts 1. Limoncello should be served cold 2. In Italy unique cellos such as Limoncello of Pistachio are available 3. It is my understanding that individuals can purchase limoncello or their seasonal cellos by the bottle by calling the restaurant in advance as the restaurant makes cellos on a regular basis.",0.9902,0.913,0.087,0.0,0.4677933177933178

2017-06-15,1.0,"I attended the event ""Prosecco on the Patio""  last night, it is a tasting hosted by Osteria with 20 different Proseccos and pass around appetizers. I bought tickets weeks in advance as it was sold out. Firstly, the cramped room and patio they held it in was shoulder to shoulder.....you sometimes had to wait at a table behind 10-20 people just to get a partial pouring in your flute. They sold way too many tickets. Secondly, instead of serving appropriate tasting fare like cured meats or cheeses (which actually enhance good wines with their fat content) they served extra spicy bacon wrapped items and very garlicky meatballs and fried vegetables. The appys totally destroyed your palate and made it impossible to discern the subtle differences between the beverages we were there to taste. The people who orchestrated this event have absolutely no concept of what to serve at a tasting. I mentioned something to one of the staff who said he would let them know.

2017-05-09,5.0,"We had our wedding and reception at Osteria Via Stato in the April of 2017.  If we could give Osteria Via Stato 100 stars we would!  Choosing them was the best decision we made when planning our wedding.   We began by looking at spaces like lofts, museums, etc. and found them to be too expensive and then changed our mindset and looked into restaurants that hosted weddings.   Here is why we would recommend Osteria Via Stato: 1.)  Value:  In order to secure the space, you just need to meet the food and beverage minimum.  No other rental payment is required.  The wedding packages they have are very competitively priced and you get a lot for your money.  The packages also include a wedding coordinator for your event, candles, printed menus, basic table linens, cookie box party favors for your guests, and dessert.  Because everything was all inclusive, we saved a lot of money compared to the other locations we looked at.  It also saved us a lot of time because we didn't need to set up or tear down anything--they took care of it all. 2.)  Food:  Because the venue is a well-established restaurant, the food is amazing.  The best part is, you and your guests get to select from one of four entrees the day of the wedding.  They were very adept at meeting a variety of dietary restrictions without any problem. 3.) Service:  The event coordinators, Allison and Michelle, are amazing.  They respond to all emails promptly and are experts in their field.  On the day of, Allison was our coordinator and the event went on without a hiccup.  She ensured everything flowed smoothly and stayed on time and always had a smile on her face.  The wait staff is amazing as well.  I can't say enough about their kindness and professionalism. 4.) Ambience:  The venue has a rustic and romantic vibe to it.  Because of this, we had to spend very little decorating it. 5.) Location:  Osteria is right in the heart of River North so it is close to public transportation and within walking distance to many hotels.  We didn't have to arrange for any type of shuttle to help our gets get around. 6.) Bonus Perks:  Because they are a Lettuce Entertain You restaurant, we earned a lot of points through their loyalty program and now have a huge LEYE credit we can use at any of their restaurants. This was by far the most important and best decision we made for our wedding.  I'd highly recommend this restaurant for a wedding or other large party.",0.9975,0.817,0.178,0.005,0.5330979748221127

They were so friendly, greeted me, showed me to the meeting room restroom, whatever I needed. I could tell they were trying not to disrupt the presentation, and did a great job. Tables were cleared, food was delivered in a timely manner, waters were always filled, and they even brought a large refill for my iced tea that was ready at my disposal. The food was great! I didn't order the short rib, but it looked amazing. I had the lemon chicken breast with broccoli and it was great. The dessert (a chocolate tart) was rich, but the portion was just right. Creamy and delectable. They also served bread, meatballs, assorted olives, salad, and a farmers bruschetta. Everything was awesome. The venue is casual but you could definitely dress up.

2017-04-05,5.0,"If you're here searching whether you should host your wedding at Osteria via Stato: DO IT! We rented out the entire restaurant (and pizzeria) for our August 2016 wedding. Long-time Streeterville residents, we wanted to be married downtown, but we had a long invite list precluding many downtown venues and didn't want to be married in a ballroom. We wanted something more intimate, as well as a strolling dinner rather than seated dinner. I (the bride) had been to Osteria before and loved its charming interior, and then I saw it on the list of downtown venues. It was the first place my groom and I visited, and we were sold! With the help of Allison and Michelle with OVS, we had our perfect cocktail-party style wedding. We married on-site beneath one of the arches in the main, gorgeous dining room, and the staff flipped the ceremony space to tables and a dance floor while the guests were in the pizzeria or outside patio for cocktail hour. The venue was so charming that we didn't need to add much decoration. Although we were local, my parents live out of state, so the OVS event team was especially accommodating to our many visits to the space and by hosting many meetings with us. As a bride that wanted to put my trust in other people to handle everything, I couldn't have been happier working with the OVS team. On our wedding day, Allison and the chef went above and beyond by fixing what could have been a major wedding-day mishap -- our (very small, 6"" round) wedding cake was delivered on its side (by another vendor), ruined! Allison ran to the store and bought us a replacement, and the chef jazzed up the decorations to be closer to what we had originally designed. We also had a blast with the restaurant staff at our wedding, at our tasting, and at a special dinner we had introducing the bride's parents to the venue. They host so many events and weddings over the course of the year, and they handle the large crowd with ease. The OVS event team also serves as a day-of wedding planner, helping with scheduling and the flow of the day (down to holding the curtain and cueing the walk down the aisle!). Photos here:  blog.brittanybekas.com/w…   As a review for the restaurant in general: Highly recommended. Everyone at our wedding raved about the food -- we're still getting comments 6+ months later. The ricotta cavatelli is my favorite pasta dish of all time. We also love the parmesan-crusted sweet onion appetizer, which tastes kind of like french onion soup, although it's just the onion. Very unique- we've never seen anything like it before. The veal meatballs are amazing, as is the short rib. I think OVS is underrated in the Lettuce Entertain You group (which is overflowing with great Italian spots). Although it is connected to a hotel, it is so charming inside, and the food is delicious. I'm thrilled to come back every year near my anniversary (at least!). This isn't a tourist spot- locals should love it. Go!",0.9987,0.805,0.179,0.016,0.5180083857442347

The service was outstanding and really made the dining experience something special. Earl was exceptionally knowledgeable about the menu and made great recommendations on wines, as well.

The beets were perfectly done and the dressing was just right, very flavorful without being overwhelming. Two of us had the beef tenderloin entree and there wasn't a bite left on the plates. It was fabulous. Two of us had different pasta dishes and we loved those, as well. There wasn't much room left for dessert, but we were having such a nice time that we ordered it anyway.

2017-03-21,4.0,"This, I believe, is a first for me. I'm updating my review and as part of the process, will be reducing my previous score by one star. The reality is that even though this place is great, I should have never provided it with a five star ranking. I ordered the same three appetizers (yes, I got three) that I tried about 18 months ago - the veal meatballs, cheesy onions and the roasted garlic. Literally, all three of them were just as amazing as I remembered. I'm convinced that no one makes a better veal meatball. I was pretty full after the apps and really did t even care to get an entree, but I twisted my own arm and tried the spaghetti arabiata. It was very nice. The pasta was well cooked and the dish had a little spice to it. Maybe it was a little plain, but I can't knock it too much. The service was on point. Polite, attentive, clean. Regarding the atmosphere, it is right off the hotel lobby which is less than fantastic and they literally have one bathroom which seems to always be occupied. So, patrons continuously ha e to walk out into the lobby to find a different bathroom. The other note I have to make, and this is more of a personal thing, I can't go to this place by myself because I don't think I can NOT order all three apps. They are too good. Great meal. Def deserving of four stars, but five star reviews need to be reserved for the select few. Thank you.  -------   Previous Review Below ------- Food: very very good. I was there with a large group. Before we actually sat down, appetizers were passed that included ricotta, sirloin and pizza. All were terrific.  We had roasted garlic and olives with warm bread to start. It was absolutely fantastic and somewhat unique. Then came the veal meatballs which melt in your mouth. They are insane. Then the salad and onion and melted Parmesan cheese. The onion and cheese dish reminded me of some concoction that I would come up with at 2 am after a night at the bar, but it was amazing. A must if you like onions. For entree I was able to taste the short rib, eggplant parm, chicken Mario and trout with butter sauce. All were very good, but my entree, the short rib, did not blow my socks off. Homemade cheese cake for dessert was second only to the cheesecake at the capital grille although I thought the camel sauce was a bit burnt.  Service: as good as it gets. Destiny and mark or Greg (I can't remember the guy's name) were awesome. They were so nice and attentive. Couldn't ask for anything more from them. Atmosphere: a bit upscale but not up-it's.  Clean. Crisp.  I had a great experience here. Everything was great. However, I want to be fair here. My short rib was just good. Also, they only have one single bathroom for the entire restaurant which is ridiculous. And they only have white napkins which can leave Lindt if you have black pants on. Outside of these three comments everything was amazing. A special shoutout to the staff. They were warm and they cared. It showed and earned this place my second 5 star review.

Came back got my pizza took and then the host had to go on a scavenger hunt to find parmesan cheese which I thought was surprising because it is connected the embassy suites where I was saying and I figured they would get a lot of take out. Also I gotta say I was expecting much and that is exactly what I got. Probably the worst pizza I have had in awhile and it was like $16 bucks. If you are staying at the Embassy suites save yourself the time and money and walk a block I think there is a CVS or something and just buy a frozen pizza or something its got to be better than this place and probably quicker. Im beginning to loose hope and give up on the restaurants from Lettuce Entertain You in general. I've had bad service at this place in Chicago and I had bad service at Mon Ami Gabi's in Las Vegas.

We chose OVS for our wedding as we wanted great Italian food along with gluten free options. Look no further as Osteria Via Stato went above and beyond our expectations! It is no easy task to find a wide variety of gluten free food for the bride and groom. But Osteria checked all the boxes for us down to dessert by making a crust-less cheesecake. And the arugula salad is addicting as well as the Parmesan crusted onions. Please keep in mind all our guests had all the gluten they wanted with the fresh baked bread and other food throughout dinner. The staff knows their products and the chef takes great care preparing the food .It was a bonus in earning our Lettuce Entertain You points for our wedding. Allison, Michelle and Abby answered all my questions and accommodated our requests without any issues. It was wonderful to hear from the vendors I was working with that they had a long standing relationship with OVS. Not to worry your guests and vendors will all be fed well. The menu selections are amazing and the tasting was outstanding. The service is top notch as no glass was left empty for long.  The atmosphere was very inviting and the ceremony was beautiful in the intimate space. The staff set the mood with dozens of candles being lit for the night. Our guests couldn't rave enough about the food and how cozy and welcoming the space felt to them. This coming from Italians was confirmation for me that I selected the right place.

The best part of the party was the staff. Nadie was our lead waitress, and she was so patient, attentive, and helpful. From rearranging seats to accommodate our guests, to noticing we were missing favors at various seats, Nadie had everything covered. I cannot say enough good things about working with her! My sister also worked with Abby to coordinate the event details, and she said Abby was always very prompt and accommodating of requests.  The food was also excellent. For appetizers, we did a house salad, bruschetta, their famous onions, and meatballs. We were kind of skeptical about picking meatballs and onions, but both were full of flavor and impressive. For entrees, we had the option of short ribs, white fish, a chicken and a vegetarian pasta... clearly I don't remember the chicken and vegetarian options well because our party is a heavy meat and fish kinda group :) Short rib looked like a normal sized portion but turned out to be huge - very flavorful and moist. White fish was a sizable portion, mine in particular was a little dry, but flavor was rich and buttery.

Lots of pizza was ordered and I had a slice or two of the margherita pizza and sausage pizza...both were equally as good.

2016-11-07,4.0,"I came across this place as its near the hotel I was staying at. Upon entering it, the amount of noise was deafening as there were two large parties filled with the usual boisterous buffoons I find to many times in restaurants. I sat at the bar where the noise was still somewhat loud, I asked the server (Patrick) if they could make my Sazarac and was told they didn't have all the ingredients (what a surprise), so I settled for an Old Fashion. The drink was good and strong and had nice flavor so I began to peruse the menu for something. A few of their dishes sounded pretty good but I ended up settling on two 'small plates' consisting of the Veal Meatballs in a Pomadora sauce and the Spaghetti Ariabiatta. I expected 2-3 meatballs, but ended up with a plate of about 15-20 little meatballs as you would find on a party platter. The spaghetti was excellent and had good taste. I had read about the hand rolled Gnocchi with the slow braised duck ragu which I nearly ordered but selected the smaller plate. However, I struck up a conversation with the young lady next to me and she was happy to share hers with me. The next time I'm there I'll order the full plate as it was extremely delicious.",0.9898,0.806,0.177,0.017,0.5430335097001765

Upon arriving on Saturday evening we had a reservation for 7 ppl, we sat in a room to the right of the entry. There was a loud wedding party going on wth the doors open to the restaurant which was quite annoying to hear their dj and party during dinner.   Well once we sat down our server seemed annoyed with us at the beginning, we ordered drinks and waited 15-20 minutes still with no drinks, then another server was taking orders from us and not really sure who was supposed to be helping us and after some time i finally found the manager to talk about why we have sat at 9:30 and at 10:20 we still didnt have drinks. Once the food came it was delicious. Upon the server bringing our tickets the manager had comped our first round of drinks yet on the tickets it did not reflect that some tickets had the comped drinks and others didnt and the server was so rude like whats the problem. The service itself was terrible, brett the manager did as much to help us out but the server himself was terrible and I hope they got it figured out. We chose to not leave a tip because the service was so bad, THEN the restaurant CALLED one of the people in our party and asked about the tip and said the server would lose money because he would have to tip out. I HAVE NEVER EVER HAD A RESTAURANT CALL ABOUT THE TIP. A tip is based on service and is optional!

Osteria Via Stato seemed like a nice spot not too far from me, and I didn't want to pass up any opportunity to try out a hidden gem nearby. Had a Classic Caesar Salad here, as well as the classic Penne. Fairly average food, and while none of it was bad, it honestly tasted pretty indistinguishable from most any of the other decent Italian restaurants I've been to in the past. To be honest, if I had the time and patience I probably could have made those dishes at home without all too much effort, and for a fraction of the cost. And for something that tasted just average, it was a bit pricey for what you're getting. $18 for a dish of pasta and $10 for a salad isn't unreasonable, but especially with the penne, you'd expect a larger portion size.",0.7498,0.889,0.081,0.03,0.5202380952380953

We had signed up for a 4 course asparagus dinner that evening, but when we arrived we found out it had been cancelled. Unfortunately, because I signed up through an email to their main office - they didn't have my phone number to call me and let me know. Both the manager (Matt?) and then followed by Chef DeGregorio and a gentleman who handled the wine pairing, preceded to give me and my partner a complete dinning experience with all the dishes we were looking for - and a couple added on top for good measure. The crispy asparagus w/ spicy aioli was the perfect blend of crunch & heat, the risotto w/ lobster and shrimp was divine and the dry aged ribeye was absolutely melt-in-your-mouth perfection. Their kindness and willingness to go out of the way to make what could have been a very disappointing evening into something that I will remember for some time to come was heartfelt and way above anything I could have imagined. I will be telling everyone I know about what a fine establishment this is -- and most especially what a great staff.",0.9892,0.753,0.202,0.046,0.6607407407407407

Woods)  I will upload the picture, but I will start by saying I do not recommend this item. The salad was yellow, and it was satrated with huge chunks of parmesan cheese, which overwhelmed the rest of the flavors. It was a good size portion, but I couldn't convince myself to eat it. I opted not to take my leftovers, even though I despise wasting food. I also would like to comment that the waiter neglected to add the Lettuce Entertain You points, and when I called to get them adddd, they only added part of the points I thought were earned (how does $40 equate to 12 points?)

This deal started with a round of 4 or 5 appetizers that are unlimited - they were all unique and tasty; the pear bruschetta was probably the most notable and worthy of a second helping. Then they brought out two pasta dishes that are also unlimited and both were solid. After all this (and no room left) we received our entrees (you only get one of these). The short rib was really tender and definitely one of the better we've had in the city. The veal and sausage meat entree was also good.

I have had a majority of their menu and there is not one thing I have not liked. Start with their bread and roasted garlic cloves. I could just eat the olive oil garlic cloves by themselves they are that good. For antipasti the La Queacia Prosciutto. Salad, get the Chop. Onto entrees get the short rib, filet or scallops. For sides, I love the broccoli, I promise it will be the best broccoli you will ever eat. Yet, I need to warn you their vegetable is seasonal so the next time I went back they had Brussel sprouts, equally as amazing as the broccoli.

There are plenty of good sounding entrees, including a good amount of vegetarian ones. I decided on the eggplant parm because eggplant is time consuming and tricky to make at home. So I was shocked when the food came out legit within 5 minutes. Granted, not many people in the restaurant, but eggplant takes forever to make even if semi pre-cooked. When I tasted it, I could tell that it wasn't super fresh. If it was made fresh, the bread crumbs, even after being topped with marinara, would still have a slight crunch and olive oil taste on the edge. So, I wasn't fooled Osteria!

We came here with family a couple of months ago and were really impressed.  It is a nice but comfortable atmosphere.  Both times we went all of the staff was exceedingly friendly and helpful. The food here is outstanding.  The trout I had yesterday is one of the best entrees I've ever had. Last night my husband and I celebrated our 5 year anniversary here.  It was a perfect night to eat outside, so we sat on the patio.  We ordered the Italian Dinner Party which is $40 per person.  It was perfect.  I told the waiter we didn't eat beef or pork, and he said that was fine they would just switch those parts to something else.  When food was being delivered, we were told each time what type of meat was in a dish.  This was a really nice and reassuring touch! The bread and roasted garlic are amazing.  We had the pea brushcetta in place of the short rib brushchetta and it was quite good.  We ordered seconds of the Italian vegetable salad, it was very good and close to being healthy.  I'm not a huge fan of polenta, but it seemed fine.  The Parmesan encrusted sweet onions was amazing.  It really blew me away.  The pennete pasta was fine, but not my favorite.  The mezze rigatoni with chicken was great.  We debated about getting more of it, but were getting full.  You can order as much as you want of all of that!  It was a lot of food though, so even though my husband and I are good eaters, we only ordered seconds of 2 things (salad and broccoli)! I would have been quite happy to end the meal here.  In fact, maybe we'll come back and do just those parts since that's only $25 per/person. But then our entrees came out.  I had the trout, and my husband had the chicken.  The chicken Mario was great, but the Local Trout was one of the best things I've ever eaten.   The entrees came with crispy calabrian potatoes which were delicious and broccoli which was very nicely cooked. My husband was shocked when I said I was too full to order desert, but really at that point I was uncomfortably full.  I had been full for a while, but just kept eating because everything was so good.

So we stumbled into this place because it was close to our hotel and it stays open late and it has good reviews in general, so we decided to give it a try.  And it was a very very pleasant experience for me and my GF.  We were one of the last tables to get seated, and we sat outside in a balmy beautiful Chicago summer evening.  We had: Food: 5/5 Spicy Rhode Island calamarie Arugula salad Cavatelli w/ wild mushroom and ricotta cheese burnt caramel gelato   While I wouldn't describe any of the dishes as earth-shattering or eye-popping, they are nonetheless well-made with quality ingredient and prepared with finesse and thoughts.  They are the dishes with execution and presentation that just let you relax and focus on enjoy them. Ambience: 5/5 We sat outside so we can enjoy the beautiful evening.  The fixture is comfortable and good looking, the lighting is soothing. Service: 5/5 Our water was replenished all the time.  Our waitress was attentive, polite, personable, knowledgeable, smart, and really good at taking care of us.  We were the last table to leave and we never felt rushed or neglected even for one second.     Costs: 5/5 For what I got for the money.  I think it's worth every penny.",0.9898,0.803,0.169,0.027,0.5344246031746032

We did the Italian dinner party and boy was it a lot of food, which makes me happy, but the antipasti and pasta (which you can have more orders of ) alone will fill you up. The salad was light and refreshing. Gorgonzola and pear bruschetta was pretty tasty. Roasted garlic with balsamic vinegar and olive oil was yummy, although I prefer it without the balsamic. I also very much enjoyed the polenta. The mortadella and provolone was probably the only thing I didn't care for. We also ordered a couple plates of prosciutto which were yummy. Both pastas, the orecchiette and gnocchi were very good. I had the risotto of the night as my main entrée. I thought it was okay, but definitely better things to be had here. The sausage didn't quite come through for me and the whole dish wasn't as cohesive as I would have liked. Rice was cooked almost perfectly. Tried the parmesan crusted chicken and that was very tasty and tender. Just when you thought you were clear of endless food, there's more...the sides! Didn't try the brussel sprouts but the potatoes were yummy with the perfect crispy texture.

Starter bread: Was psyched up about this from other Yelp reviews and it did not disappoint! Absolutely loved the dip. If they gave us bread that stayed warm for longer I would've been even more delighted.  Italian sangria: Got it with white wine. Lovely drink if you like sweet cocktails.  Grilled octopus: The octopus was drilled beautifully and the potatoes were the right softness. However, the lemon scent was too strong for our personal liking. I would reorder this dish in the future if the dish were less sour.  Ricotta cavatelli: Definitely my FAVORITE of the night. I have a bias toward anything with mushrooms and this one did not disappoint. The sauce was fragrant and just the right richness.  Pappardelle with slow-braised duck ragu: In contrast with the ricotta, this one was bland! The pappardelle also felt a bit crumbly. The duck ragu+sauce / pasta ratio should definitely be increased. Would not \ Braised niman ranch short rib: Excellent dish. The meat is very tender and juicy and the garnishes complemented it perfectly. Goes well if you're sharing (e.g. 1 full pasta + 1 protein) since it's quite a sizeable portion for one.  Warm bread pudding with vanilla gelato: Can't go wrong with this one!

2014-12-12,5.0,"Decided to try this place because of the Yelp reviews for my birthday dinner. This restaurant is amazing!! I am so glad we made reservations because the place was packed. As soon as we arrived they sat us for our reservation immediately. There are two sides of the restaurant, one is the pizzeria and the other is the nicer restaurant side. The atmosphere is very relaxing.  When we got sat we where given this amazing garlic vinaigrette sauce for our bread. It was to die for. The bread was perfectly made it was fluffy and just tore apart so easily. The waitress was great and answered any questions we had. The wine list they have is HUGE!! Luckily, they have a program called ""Bring me the wine"" and what you do is tell your waitress what you think you will have for dinner and they bring you a glass or bottle of the wine that will pair perfectly with your meal. I told her I wanted the Linguine with clams and she brought me the most delicious white wine I've ever had (wishing it was 5 oclock somewhere right now). For appetizers we ordered the Spicy Calamari and the Grilled Octopus and both where so delicious. The portion on the grilled octopus was a little on the light side but that's fine since we ordered the Calamari also.  For dinner I had the Linguine with clams. It was so good I ate my entire plate. The portions are not huge so it is the perfect amount. The wine was flowing and the waitress was great at keeping up with us. One of the best dining experiences I've had. I will definitely be back and I do high recommend this place to someone. If you like Italian food and wine this is the place for you!

2014-12-12,1.0,Went here on a Thursday night with my husband for my birthday. We did the family style dinner. Each salad and app was served individually about 20 minutes apart from each other. It took 1 hour and 30 minutes to get our main meal- which wasn't tasty at all. I got the chicken and my husband got the short rib. Wait staff ignored us all night and apologized at the end of our dinner by giving us free shots and a bar of chocolate. All I wanted was our food served in a timely way and a tentative server. I would never go back again.,0.6908,0.9,0.077,0.022,0.4511904761904762
2014-12-02,4.0,"Osteria Via Stato was the perfect place for a warm dinner and a glass of wine last week. I loved the entryway and the bar area, so cozy and warm with its fireplace and crowded tables. We were led to our dinner table in the main dining room and seated promptly it the beautiful cavern like space. Our server was courteous, efficient, and provided multiple recommendations for both wine and food. We started off with a cup of the soup d'jour- a fennel chicken vegetable, and some wine to wash it down with. For my main course, I ordered the pasta arabiatta as I was craving some spicy warmth. I liked it, but didn't love it. The pasta was really good and the portion was huge, which is what you expect at an Italian restaurant, but it wasn't as spicy as I wanted it to be nor did it truly distinguish itself with any unique flavors. I was not displeased at all; I just wanted something a bit more memorable. I would certainly go back to Osteria Via Stato and perhaps order something with a little more pizazz. If you have a large group, this would be a great restaurant for a special occasion as it is spacious and has a large menu.

2014-11-30,1.0,"Wow - what a disappointment.  Huge Lettuce fan - love Antico Posto.  In the city thought hey I can have a great meal here.  No. Where did they go wrong - let me count the ways ... 1. Half empty restaurant - one of my kids just wanted buttered noodles - someone else wanted pasta of the day but they usually only serve as part of a $40 full course meal.  Made it seem like they were doing us some huge favor ... really? 2. Food took forever.  See note about half empty.  Why? 3. Short Rib risotto was so salty it was inedible. 4. Clam pasta (vongole) would have bene good. If they had FULLY WASHED THE SAND OUT OF THE CLAMS.  I mean really?  I was sort of annoyed my wife hadn't retuned it on the first crunch of sand but she soldiered on.  I wouldn't have. 5. My kids eat the gnocchi at Antico Posto like it is going out of style - I have an 8 year old who can eat two full adult portions.  But then Antico doesn't produce heavy sticky Gnocchi that could replace spackle. 6. Oh and the buttered pasta - same issue we have at Antico - the only reason I can't give it 5 stars ... drowning in butter.  So much so my kids need to tip the plate up on a knife so it pools down on one side and then they eat from the top. Some not major issues 1. Pasta of the day sausage/ cauliflower orecchiette pretty tasty - though little cauliflower. 2. Roasted cauliflower ... eehhh not much of a roasted taste. 6. Focaccia solid - olives/prosciutto good. Maybe slow night and the ""B"" team in charge ... then time for a new ""B"" team. It would have had two stars but still a bit pricey - so one it is.  Lettuce you have many great places - this places needs an overhaul in the kitchen or you can return it to a Papagus (Greek restaurant in that space Lettuce had years ago).",0.9871,0.833,0.129,0.037,0.5030650252525253

2014-11-14,2.0,"Just ate here for the first time. The food was great, and staff was friendly enough, but still a bit disappointed in the overall experience with regard to time and the valet parking. I will first admit while we had a 7:45 reservation- we were a few minutes late. However, I called to warn them off that and they said it wasn't an issue. There are two sides to the restaurant: a ""pizza side"" and a more formal dining side, which takes reservations (but has no pizza). Ironically, we decided to eat on the reservation side in order to avoid a wait; however, we ended up waiting longer for our reservation than some people did for walk-ins on the ""pizza side"". Our reservation was at 7:45, we arrived at 7:55 (as I said we'd pre-warned them of our late arrival and told it wasn't an issue), but weren't seated until sometime after 8:40.  When we were finally seated, we were promptly served water and bread (with a delicious garlic  dipping oil), but it took about 30 minutes to get drinks and place an order. Aside from slow service here and there, the food was delicious and our waitress was friendly enough (probably over booked in her section).  However, the kicker for me was the parking situation. Valet is $14 for 3 hours (pretty standard for Chicago). When we left and finally got our car we were told it would be $17 bc we'd exceeded 3 hours. Monetarily not a big difference, however after pulling away- we realized that we were actually under the three hours as we left at 10:50 and had given our ticket at 10:45 (reminder we got there at 7:55). Even if we had been late, it is also a bit irritating to have to pay an excess fee when our delay was a result of the restaurants reservation/time management.  All in all the food was good, but I would not use their valet or go there expecting  time efficient seating or service. Only go there if you have time to kill.......bc you will do just that. I will contemplate giving them a second chance- but was unimpressed by overall service. However- I cannot comment on the ""pizza side"".",0.9246,0.854,0.088,0.059,0.4855555555555556
2014-11-07,5.0,"Wow, we just had to share how wonderful our wedding at Osteria via Stato was on 10-4-14! When we began our search for a venue, great food, great wine and a unique, intimate setting were all on the top of our priority list.  We also wanted a downtown location that was easy for locals and out-of-towners.  As soon as we started working with Osteria's on-site event planner Allison, everything started falling in to place. She was full of ideas, calm as a cucumber, and willing to amend our plan as our guest list kept growing. Being that we were two brides, you can imagine that our questions never stopped. And never once did Allison get rattled or sound annoyed.  The night our our wedding was absolutely stunning. We had 130 seated comfortably around the arch for our ceremony, in rounded rows as we requested. The setting was charming, welcoming and intimate. We had a 3-piece orchestra for our processional and recessional with plenty of room to spare. We moved to the pizzeria for our cocktail hour, which was a little crowded but that was mostly due to the nasty weather outside and we couldn't make use of the outdoor patio like we had hoped. Drinks were plentiful and easy to get, and the passed apps were lovely.  Dinner and toasts were in the front 2 rooms and the space was stunning! White table cloths on the round tables and the beautiful butcher block wood tables were left without linens, for the perfect classy yet rustic vibe. And the food was absolutely delicious. Our guests were all raving about the perfectly-cooked filets, as well as the other four offerings. The salads, veal meatballs and other starters left everyone feeling so much more fulfilled than a traditional wedding meal. Throughout the meal, the wait staff was amazing, never leaving a glass empty or anyone wanting anything. Bill and Maria were the waiters at our head table who had also served us on our tasting, they came in special just to work our event and both were spectacular.  After dinner, we had a 8-piece band in the back room and the dance floor was perfect. Again, drinks were always full, late night pizzas were served and the staff was perfect. Allison and her team were a pleasure to work with and it was so reassuring to know that her team had all the details handled, especially since we opted not to have a wedding planner.

This was just the second time I had octopus, the other time was at Costa Del Sol in Hartford and I don;t remember the meat being as tender and tasty as it was last night. The dish had a few chunks of potato in an olive oil & garlic dressing. It was amazing. My entree was Spaghetti Arrabiatta in an intensely delicious sauce of crushed tomatoes, olive oil, and Calabrian Chilies, I went for the smaller portion (a steal at $5.95, and added a side of shrimp to the dish. The dish reminded me how wonderful a simple spaghetti and tomato sauce can be when the pasta is perfectly cooked and the sauce is stellar. I LOVED my dinner. Seriously. I also tried a few forkfuls of the night's risotto special- tonight it included some braised short rib. It was ridiculously good- melt in your mouth goodness..

It's delightful to taste the food and not the result of salt on food.  Reluctantly tried the braised Niman ranch short ribs for the first time, and I'm so glad I did. I though no other short ribs can come close to the awesomeness of Magnolia Cafés, but I was wrong. While MC's are fabulous, so are OVS's. Both are two of the best in all of Chicago and both serve generous as far as portions, too. Nice for those of us who love having leftovers the next day.",0.984,0.72,0.227,0.053,0.6198412698412699

All were fantastic! We chose the wine tasting option everyone raved about the wine. Wine glass was never empty.   We chose the standard Italian Dinner for groups but substituted Penne with Chicken, Mozzarella and Tomato Cream Sauce in place of the Chicken Mario. (Touch choice since both are fantastic but we wanted a pasta as a choice.) I tasted 3 out of the four at our table and all were superb...lake trout and beef melted in your mouth. The veal meatballs CAN NOT be topped!  Yummm.  They were very careful to substitute salads and desserts for the 2 guests with allergies.  We had set up the whole dinner through Allison via emails and phone call who was very attentive to EVERY detail including table placements, seating arrangements, and dinner and appetizer choices. She even set up a food tasting for the bride and groom to help choose the appetizers and menu.  The evening was better than I could have hoped!  Thank you.",0.961,0.876,0.104,0.021,0.5828125000000001

The salad portions here are huge, so I was happy I got the small size of the pasta. The salad was very good and had a light dressing. The pasta was also delicious and just spicy enough. I also tried the seasonal mixed green salad and the ricotta cavatelli. The salad was filled with walnuts and cherries, but I found the dressing a little too heavy and sweet.

2014-02-04,5.0,"We had dinner here because we are considering it for a rehearsal dinner this fall. Mark, our server, was excellent. He not only shared information about the food, but he also knew everything there was to know about the space we were looking at as well.  He brought several items out for us to try because he thought would work well for the rehearsal dinner and I thought that was very nice of him. We tried the roasted garlic with warm bread, which was very good. I had to try it out and I'm not even a bread person! Next we had the mini veal meatballs which were amazing. I could have had nothing else and been happy - needless to say, we cleaned that plate! Mark also brought us parmesan crusted sweet onions and marinated olives. Both of these were good, but our preference was definitely the roasted garlic and meatballs. Because we wanted to try as many dishes as possible, we ordered the Chicken Mario, the short rib ravioli, the salmon and the special risotto dish that they were offering that night. The chicken was very moist and thanks to Mark's suggestion of squeezing a little lemon on it, it was very flavorful. The salmon was excellent as was the risotto dish. The ravioli was good, but we were looking for more of a tomato based dish and it just didn't happen to be that. Of course, we had to try the desserts (research!) and had the ricotta cheesecake and the chocolate tart. The cheesecake was probably the best we've ever had and should not be passed up. The chocolate tart was good, but the cheesecake was exceptional. I decided we had to try the homemade chocolate candy bar as well. This turned out to be completely different than what I had envisioned. It was a solid chocolate bar which the waiter broke into pieces and was served alongside almonds and candied orange pieces.

2014-01-24,4.0,"My husband and I dropped in after roaming around the Rush/Ontario area, trying to find a decent place to grab some grub. I heard from a close friend of mine that Osteria Via Stato was a great place to eat. It was very chic and elegant, dimly lit and all. We might have been slightly underdressed (as others were in their dresses and pearls), but never once were we ever put to shame! Our waitress was named Natalie, and she was hilarious, very sweet, and was full of great recommendations. The restaurant gives you this crusty bread and their house-marinated olives (olive oil infused with slices of lemon and a bay leaf) - these olives are quite addicting, especially the smaller kalamata-like ones - salty and brine-y with the bread. For antipasti, we started off with the restaurant's signature 'Parmesan-Crusted Sweet Onion,' which was basically sliced rings of onions baked in the oven with olive oil and cheese melted on top. It tasted like French onion soup, but without the soup. Having it smeared on the crusty bread they give you in the beginning was like eating with croutons, and it was pretty good. There were about 4-5 slices, and it was good enough to share. For the main entree, I ordered the Papparadelle, which was covered with the tomato-meat ragu. Supposedly the ragu was a signature sauce of the restaurant chef's - it tasted like any tomato sauce with chunks of beef in it. It was okay, but nothing to rave about. My husband ordered the Slow-Braised Painted Hills Short Rib, with melted leeks, organic carrots, and drizzled with red win sauce. The rib itself was a size of a 6oz filet mignon, and it tasted like good pot roast. As our sides, we ordered the Calabrian Potatoes, which were very crispy, oven-baked goodness, topped with Calabrian chilies and herbs - it was a little bland, but dipping it into the red wine sauce of my husband's dish made it even more better. For dessert, we had the Ricotta Cheesecake with Huckleberry sauce and the Gelato tasting platter. The Ricotta Cheesecake was light and not as heavy as your regular New York-style, but it was very tasty; it came with a side of Huckleberry sauce with 3 huckleberries - yum! The Gelato platter usually comes with 3 scoops out of the 5 choices, but Natalie was nice enough to give us a tasting of all 5 - coconut, chocolate, pistachio, vanilla, and caramel. Each scoop either had a Pepperidge Farm sugar cookie, pistachio nut shavings, amaretto cookie shavings, or a side of hardened fudge sauce. Everything was totally filling. The price isn't as bad as I thought, the service was excellent, and our overall dining experience was quite nice. +house-marinated olives +Parmesan-Crusted Sweet Onion +Slow-Braised Painted Hills Short Rib +Ricotta Cheesecake with Huckleberry sauce +ask for Natalie :D",0.9986,0.796,0.197,0.008,0.5487901105986213

2014-01-15,2.0,"Strike one - Lack of greeting/layout of restaurant.  Dined here last night for the first time with my husband. I happened to enter at the same time a large private party was arriving, which caused a lot of confusion. The hostess greeted the party, but after seating them she never came back to greet me. The host stand is near the bar - which is not directly near the front entrance, or clear that I should check in there. After asking a fellow patron (not employee - they were nowhere to be found) how to enter the restaurant, I checked in at the hostess desk asking to be seated. Strike two - Rude staff. When gave my reservation name the hostess promptly told me that she could not seat me until my husband arrived, but that I was more than welcome to drink at the bar while I waited. Their policy is that they do not seat people until a complete party arrives. However, I explained to her I had been waiting and would like to put our order in before my husband arrived - this was a special occasion, and we'd like to order a bottle, so I didn't need a glass on top of that beforehand. Didn't matter that I was about to drop serious cash on wine + dinner, she refused to seat me - and told me so very condescendingly.  Strike three - Judgement. Judgement galore. Maybe it's because I look young, maybe it's because we're a bi-racial couple, maybe the entire staff on Tuesday's is incompetent, I don't know. But from the hostess, to the coat check, to our server, I felt as if my husband and I were looked down upon the entire time we were in this establishment. When I pointed to the menu to order a specific bottle of prosecco, our waiter snapped at me ""Well yes, but which one... we have lots of different types, you know."" Yes. I did know. Which is why I was showing you precisely which bottle I wanted to order. Then when my husband was asking for recommendations, our waiter again seemed to be very put out that my husband pronounced ""arrabbiata"" incorrectly, and was hurrying to leave our table. Seriously? The food WAS fantastic - as was the speediness of the food service. However, the incredible lack of customer appreciation is the reason we will not be returning.

Two pastas came -- one (tomatoes, beef) was very, very good; one (collard greens) was way too salty. 3. We did a seafood stew and a ribs dish. Both were very good.

2014-01-08,3.0,"Stopped in for dinner with my husband on New Year's Eve and while the ambiance and food were both enjoyable, neither of us were particularly wowed by the meal. They had a special tasting menu option for NYE that allowed us to taste a ton of their menu items so we went with that.  For starters they brought out marinated olives, roasted fennel, a mixed salad of sorts, and I believe a polenta dish. The salad was very good and they brought more out for us when we finished our first plate, but the rest just weren't all that impressive. The next course was pasta and they brought out portions of the gnocchi, which was pillowy soft and very delicious, and I believe some kind of farro pasta that neither of us were big fans of. For the main course I had the short rib and my husband had the filet these were probably our favorites of the meal. Along with the mains they brought out a couple sides that were, again, not very memorable.  With this tasting menu we also received dessert and a choice of Italian liqueurs. My husband had a variation of flourless chocolate cake along with limoncello and I had a bread pudding with the chocolate-cello. The desserts were good but just not something I'd feel like I have to go back for.  Osteria Via Stato was recommended by a friend who has eaten at numerous fantastic restaurants so I'm thinking that maybe this dinner was just a fluke because we just weren't huge fans of the menu items we were served.

Beet and Caprese salads are must haves if you're here for the first time.  Both were really good and the beet salad had mostly beets and a tart dressing, which made for yummy slightly sour and smooth taste.  For my entree, I had some kind of pasta primavera with tons of veggies and mushrooms.  My husband loves veal and ordered the veal entree and was not disappointed - he recommends it. All in all, a good date night for two people on Valentine's day.  The place was busy but not too packed, no kids in sight (thank the heavens) and service was prompt but not in the way.  The entire place is warm, dark and reminded me of an Italian wine cellar.  I enjoyed the atmosphere and it was quiet enough that I could enjoy the company of my husband without yelling.",0.986,0.829,0.165,0.005,0.4922339155097776

If you are looking at the event menu options and don't see the exact package you think you want- ASK! She is unbelievably flexible and wants you night to be fantastic. 2) FOOD. How many weddings have you been to where you heard people saying that it was the best meal they've ever had? Not just the best wedding food, but the best meal? I'm willing to bet 0. But we have had no less than 50 people tell us how amazing the food was...they're still telling us and the wedding was 2 weeks ago. 3) Management/servers. The manager and servers were attentive and happy, and they made our night extremely memorable by not being too memorable, you know what I mean? 4) Drinks. We loved the open premium bar and loved not having to worry about drinks being full and poured correctly. They are very professional. 5) LEYE points! We had a Frequent Diner card and got a ridiculous amount of Lettuce Entertain You points that we will continue to use on meals in Chicago, Vegas and here in LA. How many wedding venues will get you money back for your event? Again, I'm willing to bet the answer is 0.

Since the race is such a huge deal for all of us, we had to prepare for it correctly so Nike was nice enough to book us a party room last night and provide us with a big pasta dinner.  The group was treated to a nice family style buffet: veal meatballs & Parmesan crusted onions for apps, Paccherri & farfalle pastas for first course, and a diner's choice for the main plate. I ended up ordering the island salmon, which came with a side of potatoes and salad. Most of the food was pretty standard and unimpressive, although I did like the flavors of the Parmesan crusted onions and the crunchiness of the potatoes. Other than those two dishes everything else was just OK.  Walking in, I wasn't surprised that the ambiance was high class. The room was nice and quiet, and the wait staff was great. Even though we were a big group the service time was way too long. The group leader was at my table and I could tell she was less than impressed with the place.

If this is what you think, you would be dead wrong although it is pricier than what I am used to paying for a meal, by no means was it overpriced. I highly recommend to go off of the Italian Dinner Party menu. It is a three course meal served family style for less than $40 per person. It takes a little longer to complete your meal this way buy if you have the time, it is definatley worth it.

2013-10-04,2.0,"Unfortunately, my personal experience was not as good as the overall rating for this restaurant.  If I had to describe this place in one word, it would be pretentious.  In other words, their attitude indicates they think their food, service and ambiance is better than it actually is.   FOOD -  Our table had a combination of chicken and fish dishes with salads and sides.   The chicken was decent but it wasn't worth the amount spent on the meal.   The fish, on the other hand, was downright terrible, according to my wife.   The potato sides were oversalted and had way too much garlic.  I normally love both salt and garlic, but these were way beyond acceptable limits by anyone's standards.    We decided not to say anything about the food at the restaurant- mostly because noone ever asked us how our meal or experience was.  SERVICE -  Service was ok, overall.  Our server was a little haughty and not overly-friendly, but not necessarily bad at his job. I noticed a difference in his attitude after our table decided to order ala carte instead of investing in the $40 per person italian buffet. Guessing that's related to the potential tip or maybe something I said.  No idea, but uncomfortable for us.   The staff that actually refilled our beverage glasses, bread and took our plates were outstanding - very nice and friendly.  My only comment for our server and the owner of this restaurant - if they read this- would be to do a better job making people feel welcome.  This was our first visit to the restaurant and probably our last.  While we weren't overly impressed with the food, the fact that I felt judged and unwelcome by the time we left is the main reason I wouldn't give this restaurant a second chance.",0.9811,0.794,0.138,0.068,0.4918859649122805

2013-08-28,2.0,"I have been to Osteria several times before and have always liked the food....especially the veal meatballs! Tonight I had the risotto special with braised short ribs and wild mushrooms....spectacular!  The reason for my review tonight has to do with the service which several other reviewers have commented on and I have experienced myself in the past-tonight, however I was perturbed enough to take the time to write it in a review.  I pulled up to the restaurant (my friend was already inside waiting for me at a table) wanting to valet. There were several parked cars in front leaving only the taxi cab lane vacant. There was no visible valet sign and the outside seating host was busy standing at his station doing nothing  except being  very good at avoiding noticing me in my car trying to get his attention to see if there was valet service (it was early and it was possible, although it would have been inconvenient, that valet service had not yet  started for the evening).  After several minutes and no valet and no hope getting the hosts attention I pulled up in front of the parked cars into what was now the valet lane for the hotel. I was approached by the bell boy who asked me if I was checking in and proceeded to tell him that I was there for dinner and had already waited behind the parked cars behind me. He was nice but did not offer to help or to go get the host from the restaurant so I got out of my car (to the bell boys objection) and walked up to the host who was now talking to a waitress and in short, asked him what was going on. The waitress saw fit to answer for him and proceeded to tell me that I would have to wait! There were several ways I could have responded to this snot who injected herself into the conversation, one of which was that I wasn't talking to her and second that my frustration was not in having to wait but in not being acknowledged, not knowing where I was supposed to wait for the valet, if there was in fact valet as there was no sign posted  and finally in being told that I would have to drive around again and wait in the taxi line! Understand that you simply do not drive around the block here, because of all the one way streets it's 2 blocks south then several blocks back north only to go south again in order to make it back around again-a round trip that takes a minimum on 10 minutes!  Restaurants are in the service industry and there is fierce competition in a city like Chicago, it is not enough to have good food....you have to actually treat your customers like you appreciate that they are taking the time to dine and spend their money at your establishment. It is NOT ok to treat people as though they are on their own until they get in the door and to be met with attitude when faults of the establishment are identified and challenged.  My overall opinion is that the staff is poorly trained in terms of quality of service, our waiter was great but the bus boy and server were abrupt and clanged plates around like we were at a greasy spoon...it was all in all a very lack luster performance... The only reason for the 2 stars is the food.",0.9413,0.859,0.08,0.061,0.47636212624584723

Their bread is amazing. Warm and fluffy on the inside and perfectly crusted. Even better was the balsamic vinegar, olive oil and roasted garlic clove dip it was served with. The Short Rib Bruschetta was so good that I would've been perfectly happy if it was the only thing I ate! The pickled peppers and celery added a punch of colour and took what could've been a mundane dish to the next level. Back to the taste: moist short ribs, crispy bread and a great flavour combo. This dish is a star! The free-range veal loin was the best veal I've had in a long, long time. The quality of the meat was exceptional. For dessert you MUST get the homemade chocolate bar.

2013-08-09,1.0,"I've always had very good experiences with LEYE restaurants but was very disappointed with Osteria and left the restaurant feeling like I was scolded. First off, the hostesses were very cordial and friendly so this started off great +1 I don't know where or how the disconnect happened but my friend and I wanted to share a prix fixe of $39.  We asked if this was possible. The waiter kindly let us know that was not possible since we would have to order prix fixe separately and we cannot share.  OK, that's fine, but as a compromise he offered to let us do the $25 prix fixe and add an entree separately.  This way he gets us to order a prix fixe and still satisfy what we wanted.  That's great, we get the antipasta and the pasta + an entree.  We will gladly pay more than the $39 as long as we just stick to sharing the plates and not pay two prix fixes, which was the point.  The $25 deal would include *unlimited* helpings of antipasta and pasta.  Wow unbelievable!  I guess that is a great way to market the prix fixe menu :).  I thought it was extremely clear that we did not want to have two prix fixes. I won't comment much about the food but would recommend the salmon.  The ragu was also commendable. The bill comes and I get charged for a $25 prix fixe and the $39 prix fixe.  I kindly inform the waiter that we just wanted the $25 prix fixe and the entree separate.  The next thing I know, I am being ""educated"" on what a prix fixe is as if I've never had one before.  We had only one re-fill of the salmon and everything else was just tasting plates.  This prix fixe was marketed as unlimited plates but why the re-fill needs to be marked on the receipt? He apologizes for any misunderstanding we had but would not change the bill.  Somehow we have to give my rationale several times before we finally get a manager to come over.  All the while, the waiter speaks very loudly as if to make us feel embarrassed by our predicament in front of everyone else and force us to give up. Manager comes over and we re-iterate.  He also speaks very loudly.  Again, no solution and we start talking for another 10 minutes.  He mentions we got a re-fill of the salmon antipasta so we should be paying the full amount.  I'm sorry but when you say unlimited I will take your word on it...in fact, by only re-filling one tasting plate, how is that taking advantage? We compromise in the end by having us pay two prix fixes at $25 each.  OK fine.  Next thing I know he comes back with giving the amount we had proposed in the first place.  Couldn't we have done this 15 minutes earlier?  After we thank him for giving us this bill (I thought customer was king here?), the table next to us decides to scold us for being so loud and obnoxious and complained that we were complaining about $20 (the nerve and arrogance that they don't care about money!). My point is, there are bound to be these things that come up (misunderstandings whatever) and as a manager/waiter for a well respected restaurant in river north, there should be more respect to the customer.  We received none of that and in fact we left embarrassed and scolded.  This could have been resolved by taking a couple minutes and listening and being in our shoes.  We would have come back since the food and ambience is fine but given we can't afford to encounter another mishap here, we will have to pass.",0.9961,0.767,0.156,0.077,0.5740217391304349

2013-04-27,4.0,"Random date night, and we wanted something fun, and out of the norm. This place OVS was pretty convenient between home and work, and I though worth trying. It is super easy to get to, and there are a lot of choices around there for food and drinks. The patio looks pretty awesome, but it wasn't quite patio weather - though some Chicagoans were braving it! This corner location would equate to amazing people watching. We had a reservation, and were seated immediately, through some double doors to the dining area. Atmosphere was good, as it is a large restaurant, but split into multiple rooms to give a better sense of intimacy, and the noise level was perfect for a date night. Wine list is extensive, definitely to the point of being overwhelming, I'd read up on your Italian wine selection before making a stop here. Our server was great, attentive to what was going on, yet left us alone to our own conversation as well. She also did a good job with portion size selection, giving us good advice about how many plates to order.  We ended up sharing an antipasta app, a small pasta and the short rib entree. This was a great combination and the amount worked really well with two people (and the nice, warm, crispy crusted bread that was provided).  The pasta was really the star of the show; orecchiette pasta with homemade sausage rapini. Pasta was cooked al dente, and the sausage had nice firm texture and really meshed well with the white wine sauce. Overall, while nothing stood out, I'm a fan. The staff was friendly and helpful and the food was good and well timed for a date night dinner. While there will be other Italian restaurants that have more of a ""homecooked"" vibe, for river north, this was a very good choice!",0.9983,0.716,0.27,0.014,0.51629329004329

2013-04-03,5.0,"This review is based off of my experience during Easter Brunch on 3/21/2013. During my Easter vacation to Chicago, I knew I wanted dine at a restaurant that had an Easter brunch. There were many great reviews of Osteria Via Stato having an amazing one so I made my reservations accordingly. I love the location of Osteria mainly because it's about a 2 minute walk from Holy Name Cathedral, so it was easy to plan brunch. It's also attached to Embassy Suites and is great for Chicago visitors. The restaurant is a dimly lit restaurant with the windows covered by drapes. It gives a romantic feeling but I wished they would have opened the drapes to let the light in, especially during brunch time. Giving our name to the host and getting a table was easy and quick, always a plus. The server explained the different stations for brunch, was attentive and friendly. Brunch was quite delicious and included: an omelet & ham carving station, main entrée station, appetizers & pastries, a dessert table, and a candy station. I loved every station but I will highlight what I believe to be the best parts. - They used delicious eggs and the cooks know how to make it moist and fluffy at the omelet station. - The appetizer section had a delicious variety of cheeses and raw salmon filets. I also loved their beets & arugula salad as well as their different breads; it is an Italian restaurant. - They had home-made sausage patties that were to die for. - Their dessert section included fresh made cinnamon & sugar donuts that are prepared right in front of you. They were flakey on the outside and fluffy on the inside: perfect. - The candy section brought me back to my childhood of eating mounds of chocolate for Easter. After experiencing Osteria Via Stato's Easter brunch, I can understand why many local media reports rave about it. The pricey $40 brunch is definitely worth the food quality and overall experience. My only negative about this restaurant is their single occupancy bathroom.",0.9969,0.764,0.209,0.027,0.552371794871795

We came here to scope out a potential party for a group of 20 or so.  We wanted to try the food and look at the available rooms before recommending this place and we're totally glad we did.  This location is old and not in the best shape. Case in point, the first room that they suggested to us was dumpier than my parent's 1957 built bathroom with the pink and gray tiles and psychedelic mirrored wallpaper.  Ugh, I could not believe they have this literal rectangular box with no windows designated as a party room. So depressing... and the table inside it was composed of two tables of which one was taller than the other.  Imagine a bigger maximum security jail cell with a flat screen TV and you're almost there. Thankfully the second room was nicer, but it was too big for what we needed. The bread and the garlicky balsamic starter were delicious. We ended up trying two pastas and they were both good, but nothing spectacular. The service was a little weird, as our waitress kept engaging our baby as we're trying to have our meal.

2012-12-26,4.0,"My wife and I dined at Osteria Via Stato for their Christmas Eve Feast of the Seven Fishes. This was our first time there, and the experience left us ready to return. I first have to note that the restaurant and staff were very accommodating with regard to my wife's gluten intolerance. Our server, in particular, was very conscientious to make sure that every dish in the prix fixe menu that could have a gluten-free substitution did. Our reservation was relatively early, for 6 PM, but the restaurant quickly filled up in that hour, and becoming quite busy. While I wouldn't characterize it as a quiet, relaxed dinner, despite the liveliness it was never too loud. Our server was working very hard, yet still took the time to make sure all of our plates were correct. We also selected the ""Bring Me Wine,"" which features unusual or more rare pours. The December feature was wines from Sicily, which, coincidentally, had been selected by our server. Each was interesting and tasty. Each glass was perfectly aerated, arriving fresh but already opened up.  At too many other restaurants I've received glasses where the bottle has clearly been open too long, or where it was just opened, and the wine had not adequate opportunity to breathe.  I was impressed at how well the staff got many details right, especially given how busy the restaurant was. All the food was seasoned just right -- no over- or under-salting. On our prix fixe we thought the appetizers were the star of the show. The fried calamari was some of the best I've had in a long time. It was fresh and tender, lightly bathed in olive oil and chili pepper. The grilled octopus was similarly fresh and tender, without any rubberiness.  My wife got the seared scallops on a wild mushroom risotto as her entree. The risotto was the star, again, one of the best we've had in quite some time. The scallops were tasty and cooked correctly, if not incredible. I got the flounder, which was lightly breaded in a lemon sauce. The flounder was perhaps a touch overdone, but still moist, flaky and flavorful.  For dessert the gluten-free option was a grantia which my wife greatly enjoyed, while I had the richer huckleberry cheesecake, featuring fresh, local huckleberries. We paired them with house-made liqueurs, a limoncello and a huckberrycello, the latter of which was unusual but delicious.  We were both quite happy and satisfied with our Christmas Eve dinner. We're most interested incoming back for appetizers and wine again, convinced that Osteria Via Stato is a good, mid-priced option for food in River North.",0.9978,0.795,0.179,0.025,0.5460423752834467
2012-12-17,5.0,"I left wondering, when can I repeat this meal?  That is how good a meal at Osteria Via Stato is.   I have to admit I had never heard of this place before so I wasn't quite sure what to expect going into the meal.  Though there is an a la carte option, our group decided to do the Italian Dinner Party meal which includes Antipasti, two pasta dishes, a main course and sides for $38.95 a person.   Note: this doesn't include any beverages or dessert.  However, for the amount of food you receive it's not a bad price at all.  All the food served to us before the main courses would have sufficed for me.  Seriously, it's a lot of food.  And it's endless.  So, if you are like we were and just LOVE one of the dishes (such as the short rib brochette), you can get more.  By the time my Scottish Salmon arrived I was stuffed, but I wasn't about to stop eating and I am so glad I didn't!  Now, I have to preface my next comment.  I think it's important to mention I order Salomon a lot when I go out to eat.  I say this because the Scottish Salmon is AMAZING.  It is quite possibly the best Salmon dish I've had at a restaurant.  Also, I was leery of the butternut squash that the dish comes with, but honestly it just enhanced the flavor of the fish even more.  Even though we were stuffed, we had dessert anyhow.  Though it was good, I wasn't wowed by the dessert I had; however, the others in my party partook in their homemade chocolate bar and said it was very good.  Oh, one other thing... the wine.  This restaurant has a great selection of wine and we appreciated our server's input on our selections.  Also, when it became evident that we weren't going to finish our second bottle of wine, he was kind enough to charge us by the glass vs. for the whole bottle which I thought was considerate. Speaking of our server... he did a very good job.  I wish I had his name so people could requests him, but I unfortunately don't. Lastly, the environment.  There is a fun, upbeat vibe to this restaurant. and is definitely a place good for many different occasions.",0.9978,0.77,0.206,0.024,0.5168567251461988

I always get the chicken Mario, which is delish, I never miss the caprese salad, and the margherita pizza. Oh, and the Calabrese potatoes, crispy, a bit greasy, but yum!   Every month, they have a few different wines and beer on the hand written menu to try, and they also have seasonal cocktails.

This place is always fresh and always so good, and has something new to try as far as drinks and apps go. I can never stay away from this place for too long! As I mentioned before, this place has seating in the pizzeria side, and the regular restaraunt side, and this makes a difference since you get 2 different menus.

The server brought me a side of parm for the rest of my salad and I practically licked the plate. I had the gnocchi with sage and brown butter, possibly the best version I've ever had. They make it with ricotta so they are lighter than potato gnocchi. They also had a nice golden brown touch that gave an extra dimension of flavor.

We came back here for dinner this summer and had a good time.  The food was pretty good and enjoyed the limoncello at the end of the meal.  This place is so loud though that it was distracting at times.

I really liked the dark, cavernous feel of this place, and our server was great.   The downside is that it's overpriced for what you get.  There are two sides to the menu:  One ""family"" style for large groups to share, and the other a la carte.  That throws a red flag immediately:  To me, a la carte means less food and more money out of your pocket.  But since there were only 4 of us dining, of course we went a la carte.  2 people in our party ordered the 6oz filet mignon, which costs $33, and all that was on the plate was the filet.  Absolutely nothing else.  No vegetable, no potatoes, nothing.  $33 for a small serving of meat.  Really?!  Two people in our party ate only salads and drank water, yet our bill was $200.  So clearly the heft of the price tag comes in the meat and booze (2 filets & 5 glasses of wine total).   What little food we got was decent, but I've had better for the same price or less in the great city of Chicago.",0.9899,0.812,0.167,0.021,0.5384761904761904

All dishes, with the exception of your entree choice, are to share. If you run out of something, just ask, and they're happy to bring you more of any of the antipasti or pasta dishes. As if it couldn't get any better, their dishes are made with fresh and local ingredients (think La Quercia prosciutto, Nichols Farm veggies, and Slagel Farm eggs). My faves: // Antipasti: Marinated olives; veal meatballs; parmesan crusted onions // Salads: Roasted beets; arugula salad // Pastas: Pappardelle with 3-meat ragu; gnocchi with crispy sage brown butter, parmesan // Entrees: Braised beef short rib; Umbrian farro  Service has always been fantastic. The servers are helpful, attentive, and extraordinarily knowledgeable about the menus. Not to mention, they are very flexible with switching out menu items on the dinner party menu.. I explained my dietary restrictions and they had no problem accommodating me. No questions asked, they swapped a couple dishes for me.  The ambiance is rustic and romantic, creating the perfect atmosphere for a great date. But I've also gone numerous times for a girls night out as well. One downside, there's one bathroom (meaning one toilet) in the bar area. So if you're not up for waiting, you have to hike your rear-end through the Embassy Suites hotel to their second floor bathrooms. It's a little ridiculous which is why it's not deserving of a full 5 stars.  Overall opinion: Incredible.",0.9917,0.808,0.15,0.042,0.540625

The crust is so thin that in some parts it just falls away where it has been charred by the brick oven it is cooked in.  We tried the margherita and the potato and bacon. The potato and bacon pizza is sauceless and the perfect contrast for the fresh basil topped saucy goodness of the margherita pizza.  I wish there was more cheese on the margherita but it probably would've collapsed the crust. Both were fantastic all the same and prices were reasonable for such a tasty treat in the middle of downtown. Pizzas ranged from the $12-14 range for and 11"" that one person can easily finish.

I had come here previously (well, to the pizza place...more low-key) and thought the food was pretty good and normally priced.  So, when my friend told us that, per management's direction, our group of 12 HAD to partake in this ""family-style, prix fixe"" menu for $40, I was little confused.  Like, is that necessary?  Why couldn't we just order off the menu?   We also couldn't choose any of the vegetables, pasta or antipasta....only our main dish.  And, while there were alot of items to choose from, what if there was that instance where NOTHING appealed to anyone in the party?  They're just SOL, ya know?  (Sidenote: Don't get the seafood stew.  It's NOT good.  I made that mistake and that's probably why I can't get myself to write a semi-positive review of this place.)

The appetizers were very good and ran the gamut from pizza to calamari and these awesome little crispy cheese rolls. After an hour we were called into dinner. The spread was awesome.

Dessert was a slice of chocolate tart, topped with whipped cream and candied orange peel. What can I say, but YUMMMMMMMMMMMMM My only complaint with Osteria was the acoustics. It was designed like a grotto and conversation was very difficult with even the person right next to you. I spent the whole night having to yell and ask people to repeat themselves.

The dish of bread and olive oil with bits of roasted garlic was tasty, too - I wish there would have been more oil/garlic because there was a TON of bread and bread is MADE for sponging up yummy stuff like that. My friend got the pappardelle, which she enjoyed. I got the gnocchi, which isn't your normal potato-based gnocchi; it's parm-based, iirc. So I thought that sounded fantastic. Not so much. While pretty much all gnocchi include flour, I could REALLY taste it in this dish. So much so that I couldn't eat more than a few. And they weren't light, but kinda gluey. Parts of them stuck to my teeth. The thin tomato sauce served with it did it no favors, either - I swirled my pieces in my friend's spicy sauce from the veal meatballs. To drink, my friend had her usual chardonnay and diet Coke (not together!) and I got a couple white peach bellinis. I'd be lying if I said that wasn't perfect. Not too sweet, just the right amount of bubbles...perfect. And it'd better be, for $11 per wee champagne flute.  And dessert? Dessert was AMAZEBALLS.

Creamy and not tooth-achingly sweet, perfect consistency...someone in the kitchen really knows what they're doing. The gelato is enough for me to come back.

The restaurant atmosphere was very classy, cozy, and not noisy.  Since I was by myself, I sat at the bar in the pizzeria section and ordered a margherita pizza. It was made of tomatoes, hand-pulled mozzarella, and basil. The ingredients were so fresh. The crust was paper thin and perfectly toasted. Every bite was light, fresh, and not greasy. To some of you, the portion looked like an appetizer. But it was enough to fill my stomach. It was the best pizza I have had. I am not a drinker, and I ordered a glass of ice tea. Even just the tea tasted freshly brewed and had full taste of tea leaves, and it was not watery. To complete my menu, I had a lemon gratin as the dessert. It was very refreshing, and it was a perfect compliment to wash down my pizza.  My bill with a quite generous tip was just $24. It was surprisingly inexpensive. I am sure that it would be more than $30 if I eat the same items in the SF Bay Area. Too bad that I don't know when I can come back to Chicago next time.

2011-12-07,4.0,"Osteria Via Stato is nice, but I don't like it as much as Quartino, the Italian restaurant right across the street. OSV (and its sister restaurant, Pizzeria Via Stato) is a Lettuce Entertain You restaurant, so you can count on it being good, but it probably won't be great. The food and service are both pretty good. On my last visit I had the creamy polenta (which was very good) and penne w/ spicy tomato cream & chicken (which was fine, but didn't stand out). My friend shared the polenta & ordered the gemelli with house-made chicken sausage, toasted garlic, breadcrumbs. His pasta was decent, but didn't really satisfy as an entree. OSV allows you to order their pastas in smaller, appetizer sizes, and I think the gemelli would make a better starter or side than main course. One neat thing that OSV offers, which would probably be best for a group dinner, is the ""Italian Dinner Party"", which gives you family style antipasti, pasta & sides for the table and one entree per person (of their choice, from a list of 8 or so) for $40 pp. You can optionally add ""Just Bring Me Wine!"" for $20 or $40 per person (I guess it depends if you want good or cheap wine?) which adds three glasses of wine paired with the meal, chosen by the restaurant. The look of OSV is rather unique, and kind of cool. It's dimly lit and almost looks like you're dining in a cellar. Of course, unlike a cellar it's not cold or damp. To be honest, if you can get a table at Quartino I'd go there instead, but if not this is a perfectly legitimate Plan B for a hearty and tasty meal in the area.",0.988,0.785,0.161,0.055,0.5894126984126984

2011-11-21,4.0,"So my husband and I dined here Sunday night. It was our first time here although we did try the attached Pizzaria Via Stato last year (we liked it). We thought it was delectable, upscale Italian. We would definitely go back. Service was excellent. As others have mentioned, the warm bread with roasted garlic/balsamic olive oil was a a phenomenal start. We probably could have sat there all night and been satisfied on just that (and wine). Also you are given the choice of complimentary filtered still or sparkling water. There is always someone on hand to promptly refill your glass. They have a family style menu about $38.95 per person and you get quite a bit of food. However we decided to order from the al a carte menu. Many pasta items were around $13 for a full size and entrees were around $25. My husband started with a mezza litre of red, I don't know which, and it was a generous amount of 2 1/2 glasses. I had the seasonal bellini which was cranberry, very good. We decided to forgo salad this time and instead shared antipasti: the mini veal meatballs and the artisinal cheese plate. The meatballs were perfect, good sized, tender and flavorful and a clean red sauce with fresh basil. A good portion. The cheese selection included a salty hard cheese, a creamy soft cheese which was a blend of goat, sheep and cow, and a blue gorgonzola. Also served with warm toasted crostini and accompaniments such as candied nuts and honey drizzled apples. I want to say the meatballs were around $7 and the cheese $11. We both opted for pasta. He ordered the handmade gnocchi, and OMG, they tasted as good as they looked which was like heaven. Delicate, melt in your mouth in a simple red sauce. I have never had gnocchi this good! $13 I think. I got the Gemelli with house made chicken sausage and garlic toasted breadcrumbs. Total comfort food. Savory, and the sausage was flavorful. It was also crumbled in the dish which I prefer to sliced, coin shaped sausage. Have to say though. my husband's gnocchi was out of this world so I recommend it to anyone. We were stuffed and tired so skipped dessert but will try it next time. The staff was very attentive and gracious. They also wrapped up some of the bread to go with our leftovers. Ambiance, quiet and dimly lit, romatice (we were there in the evening).  Overall a great place with a good variety of Italian food.

The only complaints on this venue for a wedding or event that I have is that it was a little warm and they didn't really seem able to do anything to bring the temperature down.  Also the bathrooms aren't ideally located so your guests have to leave the restaurant and use a bathroom in the hotel that is attached.   Overall I give it 5 stars.  It was a pleasure working with everyone there and looking back it was the perfect evening with a fabulous location in Chicago and really impressive food.,0.9929,0.772,0.204,0.025,0.5802867383512544

There are some fine(r) dining Italian places that do a good job with the menu, but they lack personality and tend to feel just like any other upscale restaurant--the kind of places someone in Italy (an actual Italian, not a tourist from the States) tends to avoid, since they're kind of the antithesis to Italian cuisine. What's also nice about OVS is it's sophisticated, yet still accessible. They're not so pedantic that people can't eat like Americans (the main courses, for example, are superfluous if you design your meal authentically, but are embraced and rapaciously devoured by tourists and ""Italian"" Chicagoans). If you have no basis for comparison and eat Italian food anywhere, there's no need for you to make a special trip here.

The soup was a cream of potato with roasted chicken, it was delicious... not too heavy as I usually think with a cream of potato.  I got their version of a ""BLT"" for my sandwich it looked and tasted amazing, not sure what they did with the bacon, but it was perfectly crisp, with just a slight taste of honey.  And dessert... a chocolate torte with candied fruit garnish, i licked the plate clean, enough said.  My co-worker had the ""Americano"" pizza, can't remember what was on it, but she said it was amazing and I'll take her word for it, since she devoured it.

So delicious.  It wasn't overly rich and there were plenty of two different kinds of mushrooms to make it feel like I wasn't just eating pasta.  After such delicious food we of course had to give dessert a try.  We got the gelato platter which comes with three flavors that you can choose. We chose Chocolate Hazelnut, Burnt Caramel and Almond.  They were all superb, but I liked the Burnt Caramel best because it was super sweet.   To avoid some of the problems listed in other reviews, go on a weeknight!

The good aspects: we were seated immediately, there was a decent atmosphere, and courses were served swiftly, one after another. The bad: plates were removed from the table very aggressively, often before we were finished with them, forcing us to grab food off the plates as they were removed.  Also, the courses were hit or miss, with some (seafood stew) being very tasty but most being average at best, leading us to feel that the meal as a whole was overpriced.  Finally, they didn't box up one of our entrees despite our request for them to do so.

The front room bar, which has a pizza menu, and the back room restaurant where they have an amazing spread of Italian food. If you enter through the hotel, don't get all uppity and just sit down. (Only idiots do this!) You have to make your way to the hostess stand across the bar area (where you enter). Once you do that, you have to decide where to sit: front or back. Once you do that, it's all downhill from there. The restaurant food is amazing (but all the desserts have liquor in them, which is only problematical if you are like me and unable to drink).

We decided to leave all together.  It became apparent to us to that the staff doesn't encourage return business because it relies entirely on the visitors from out of town.

They definitely accommodated my food allergies (like changed/added to a dish without complaining), which if you read any of my reviews makes me want to go back again and again.

There is a main dining area and a more causal pizzeria featuring brick oven pizzas. I took a group of clients to the main osteria. We opted for the Italian Dinner prix fixe menu. Each diner selects an entree from an option of 5. The meal begins with a series of antipastis and pastas served on large platters. The mozerella balls were fresh, soft and delicious. A classic marinara sauce accomplied the veal meatballs. These were also tender and juicy with approporiate seasoning. The pasta dishes were prepared ""al dente"" and has adequate flavor profiles but would not be considered memorable. I had the short ribs entree served on a bed of creamy polenta. The ribs were excessively fatty, beyond what I would have considered acceptable. My clients seemed to like the Chicken Mario and crusted filt options in particular.

First, the service was really unpleasant.  We had a large group and our party was completely understaffed.  It was easily taking 25-30 mins to get a drink.  Second, the food was decent but consistently cold.  They kept bringing food out from the kitchen that looked fresh but it was cold. It was a little annoying considering we were ordering a ton of food and drinks and probably had a huge bill.  Finally, at the end they forced us out of the room even after we asked if we could keep the tab open and continue drinking.  Again, annoying!  I understand that they may have needed the room for something else but it would have been nice for them to realize the potential and accomodate us in some way.  The other part of the restaurant was completely empty!

The waiters and hosts are always friendly, attentive, and helpful.  I typically sit on the pizza side, it's a little smaller, darker, and feels like a dinky old Italian kitchen. Which is awesome. The bread and oil that you start with is just unreal. I don't know how they flavor their bread, but it's always baked to perfection. The martinis are stiff, which is always an automatic plus. Depending on my mood I switch between the cheese pizza, margherita pizza, or the spectacular celery Caesar salad. Recently, I went with the cheese pizza. It's insanely thin and light which is a breathe of fresh air to most local pizzerias. I really can't find a complaint.

With that concept in mind, we ordered appetizers.  I had the potatoes with lemon aioli, and the aioli, and I can think of no other way to say this, was luscious.  I'm a sucker for savory lemon foods anyway, and this was just. so. good.  The potatoes were a little greasy, but since they're simply a vessel for getting aioli into your mouth, thumbs up!  He had the prosciutto and mozzarella, which was half good, half bad.  The prosciutto itself was perfect--La Quercia, which equals good.  But the mozzarella wasn't so good, and the portions were off.  25% of a mozzarella ball and TONS of prosciutto?  We're not complaining, but it was a little strange. For main dishes, he ordered the spinach ravioli, which was really, really good.  It's not a huge portion even at full size, so it was perfect after the apps.  The presentation is very simple: butter, truffle oil, ravioli.  It tasted fresh, and you can't ask for more.  I did experiment, and ordered half portions of the cavatelli with mushrooms and the rigatoni with chicken ragu.  I have to say that the cavatelli was transcendent.  Easily one of the better pasta dishes I've had in Chicago.  The chicken ragu was...ordinary.  I would never order it again, but I plan on inhaling some of that cavatelli again, I can promise you that.

For our annual awards banquet, I wanted a departure from our tried, true, and boring mainstays. Through a series of emails to the LEY event planner, I planned my event quickly and easily. I never worried about the quality of experience we would have because the planning was through. When I arrived for our event on a cold, rainy Tuesday, the Osterio Via Stato staff had already helped board members with arranging tables and preparing for the event. I really didn't have to worry about it any snafus throughout the night. Our banquet room was a cozy, quaint room off of the main dining room. It gave an intimate feel to our awards banquet. During cocktail hour, servers attentively took drink orders and made sure guests were comfortable.  Our banquet menu was spectacular. We started with salt-encrusted ciabatta bread served with roasted garlic and basalmic vinegar. The bread was fluffy, soft, and a little crusty. Osteria's one of those places that you remember the delicious bread from. Our group was next served a family-style chopped salad. The salad is notable for its addition of celery. Mmm, crunchy chopped salad! Next, we had a choice of entrees ranging from short-rib to chicken to salmon. I chose the salmon. Wow, it was perfectly cooked. Our tables were also served family style purple aspargus and roasted potatoes. The meal was delicious and satisfying. For dessert, we were served Italian cookies.

We started with the caprese which was fine.. your basic mozerella and tomato salad which they serve with toast points.

It was very good (what's not to like about anything cooked in butter) but really tiny... The fiance had the pappardelle with the chef's Signature 3-Meat Ragu and that was just like cafeteria style pasta. Noodles are not home made and the sauce was so weak (cmon, that's the chef's signature sauce???!).  With all the good italian options in Chicago, I will not be dining here again.

Sold. In the lead-off spot was the creamy polenta w/ wild mushrooms which was creamy goodness. My taste buds forced me to use pieces of bread to wipe the dish clean of its tasty sauce. Next was the arugula salad w/ bacon and dates I think, which was the tasty green portion of the meal that makes you think it's ok to stuff your face w/ food. The 3rd dish of the night was the penne w/ spicy tomato cream and chicken, which continued the trend of good food. Similar to the polenta dish, I once again ripped pieces of bread to sop up the creamy, antioxidant-filled, non-artery-clogging sauce (that's what I had to tell myself, after all, it was tomato based right?). And finally, in the clean-up position, we topped it all off (more like went over the top) with the special pizza: mushroom/goat cheese/leek. Had a flaky thin crust, and after forcing down a few slices, I had to throw in the towel. All that washed down with Two Guys Monarch beer... not bad, not bad at all.

I felt like the two connecting rooms we occupied could have been in separate zip codes, the only thing uniting them were the event's speakers, who stood in the opening between the rooms so we could all see and hear. From my vantage point I could only a handful of people seated on the other half of the space, it gave the event a lack of cohesiveness.  To start we had olives (blech!), frisee salad, veal meatballs and bread served family-style; I didn't try the meatballs, but the rest were all good, but no standouts. I did love that, unsolicited, our server emphasized that she would be more than happy to replenish our salad or anything else we needed. For our mains we were given a choice of papardelle with a meat ragout, chicken mario (a breast served over baby broccoli), salmon drizzled with some sort of butter over mashed potatoes. I went with the salmon, which was just ok; it was moist and flaky, but I found the dish too rich.  For dessert we dined on almond macaroons, shortbread cookies, and bittersweet chocolate with candied almonds. I didn't try the macaroons, but the shortbread cookies were great. The chocolate comes out in a slab, about 12"" x 3"" wrapped in paper and the server smashes it with a spoon to break up the chocolate and dumps almonds over the top. The chocolate was delicious, but messy; the small shards of chocolate melt quickly on your fingers.

I live in the city and have passed this restaurant a hundred times with the intention of eating there one day. That one day came last night and boy was I disappointed. It started with the rude valet guy (to be fair the other valet guy was nice) who told me I couldn't park there as I was waiting for the Valet guy to come up. I've valeted my car 1000x in this city and never had someone tell me that I couldn't park there and to move my car while I was waiting for valet. Once inside we were right on time for our reservations and were promptly escorted to our seats (that was a positive). Once we sat down we realized that it was only a pre-fixed menu tonight and my wife who is vegetarian was going to have a hard time since nearly every single dish included meat. Not a huge deal since she's not a fussy person but when discussing the menu options it seemed like a huge hassle for the waiter. The service was slow, not friendly, poor wine suggestions, and a complete disappointment. The food compared to other Italian restaurants in the city was at best average.The only positive is that the pre-fixed menu was $40/each and they do serve you a lot of food which is the reason I gave it a 2 star instead of 1. I am usually a fan of leye restaurants and dine out frequently.

The Italian dinner party is an excellent choice, especially if you're visiting the area and want to get a taste of an enormous amount of real Italian food. Be patient as they bring it out- it is all you can eat, but it's also a gut bomb. I'd wait til you've received all of the courses before requesting more. Also, if you order this they ""prefer"" (I don't know if prefer means ""insist"") that everyone in your party order this as well. My only little complaints- I don't know if this has to do with when we were there (a weekend evening), but the place was very loud and bustling which was a bit of a strange contrast with the muted romantic atmosphere created by the candlelight and fancy table setting. Also, they quit serving dessert with the Italian Dinner party. You can order it separate, but like I said, tiny gripe.

2010-01-25,4.0,"Overall I love this place. I started going to the Pizzeria Via Stato side (yes, they are in the same building yet somehow different in that you can't eat the main courses at Osteria in Pizzeria and vice versa, but some apps are the same). I've been to both sides many times and have always enjoyed the food and service. It's very darkly lit with candles on every table so it can be a very romantic spot for a date.  Since this is strictly about Osteria I'll stick to that side in this particular review.  For starters the wine selection is decent, not huge and BTW I'm not a wine connoisseur. They don't have a large beer selection especially on tap. I am particular to an Ebel's Weiss by Two Brothers which comes in a bottle. I love the crusty bread they bring out to your table. It's accompanied with roasted garlic cloves in olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Since the bread has a wonderful crunchy crust and yet is so incredibly soft inside, it's perfect for dipping. For apps I love the mini veal meatballs, they are very flavorful and melt in your mouth. The octopus and fingerling potatoes are a delicious choice for an appetizer, if you like octopus obviously. I enjoy the tangy vinaigrette that it has and think it cuts some of the fishy taste some octupus can have. I've also tried the artichoke dip that is pretty typical, although tasty. One of my favorite things here is the beet salad with goat cheese. First of all I'm sold with goat cheese anything, but the beets have a delicious tangy flavor that makes them taste pickled even though they are called ""roasted beets"". I also love the homemade pumpkin ravioli and the homemade ricotta gnocchi. Both are pretty small portions but with a full coursed meal (which is how I almost always like to order) it's more than enough food. The gnocchi is lighter than a potato gnocchi and definitely tastes homemade (although why do they need to say that when it should be implied!). My husband has gotten the carbonara, which I think tastes too rich due to the amount of bacon they use. And I do love bacon for the record. My friend has gotten the lamb here before but it's not always on the menu. To finish the meal I like the espresso gellato that has tiny crunchies on top (the best part). They also have given us a chocolate bar with sugared orange peel and almonds that my husband is obsessed with. Anything for free always tastes better in my book. I love finishing my meal off with a nice cappuccino and theirs is delish!  The best thing about this place to me is the value. Two people can eat four courses and have drinks for under $100. The food/cost ratio is way higher on the food side to me.",0.9992,0.76,0.227,0.013,0.5872157434402334

You better come hungry too, well...you don't have to if you want a nice lunch the next day. They start you off with an assortment of bread with a great dipping sauce (roasted garlic and balsamic I think). Then comes the round of appetizers shortly after. The mushrooms where amazing!! After the apps its time for some pasta. One with white sauce one with red. Both are pretty good. All of this you get to share with your table, family style. Also, at any point in the meal if you want more pf the appetizers/pasta/etc you can ask and they will get some some. Very nice touch. For the main course each person gets to pick what they want. I chose the special of the night (Duck with a cranberry based sauce - AMAZING) and my date went for the chicken which was also great. The main course comes with two sides - brussel sprouts (made with garlic and bacon, trust me its good) and potatoes.  This great dinner will run about $40 a person. If you want a wine pairing (for each course) that is an additional $15 each or more depending on the wine group you chose. We got the $15 pairing which was very good.  We couldn't stomach dessert so I cant comment on it. The dessert menu looked great, they had gelato too. Interior is very nice, dimly lit so a bit on the romantic side. I think it would still be a great for a group though. They sat us near the window, so it was a bit warm due to the heat vents..

The atmosphere is also lovely, with a comfortable ambience and beautiful accents. Even when every table is full, you never feel that it is too noisy or overcrowded. The dress is a business casual, with but you often see tourists and suburb people wearing jeans, t-shirts and sneakers. The only reason I give four instead of five stars is due to the slightly declining quality of the wait staff. I've been going to Osteria for about 3 years now, and it seems that the wait staff, though perfectly competent about the menu, polite, and never make you feel rushed, they have started to lack the attentiveness and pizzaz that I had come to expect. The waiters seem to be much less helpful in suggesting dishes or selecting wines, and seem to care much less about making sure their customers feel attended to and taken care of. Dishes are brought out in a timely manner, but they are merely placed on the table with a quick ""enjoy!"" before the waiter is off, even when there are few customers in the restaurant.

2010-01-15,3.0,"I took my friend here last weekend for a delicious dinner and we both liked it for the most part.  The restaurant is uber romantic with low lighting and solo tea lights at each table. We both started with girlie cocktails.  Two bright pink cosmos, can ya get any more girlie than that?   We then shared the calamari appetizer, which was pretty darn good.  The breading was light and the dipping sauce was alright, too. For our main courses, my friend ordered the pork shank with kale and white beans.  It was so fall apart tender!  I kept stealing little forkfuls of pork from her plate.  I went with the dish that contained all of my favorites: scallops, mushrooms and butternut squash.  I was disappointed because my scallops were slightly gritty and there was a lot of oil on my plate.  It wasn't a bad dish by any means, just needs to have a bit more attention to detail. While everything was overall pretty good I wasn't blown away with anything in particular.  If you are downtown on State St. it'd be worth a shot to stop in, but I wouldn't go out of my way to dine here again. Also--don't check your coat, otherwise you may become a popsicle sitting near the window.",0.9391,0.832,0.133,0.035,0.52
2010-01-13,4.0,"I recently went here with the sole purpose of using a gift certificate that was burning a hole in my pocket. I've had it for over 18 months and wasn't all that excited to put it to use. I had been here once before when it first opened and I didn't remember if I liked it, but I know I didn't dislike it either. I went in with an open mind. It was going to be practically free, after all. As part of the Italian dinner party, you're given several courses of starters and pastas, followed by a main course. Dishes are seasonal, based on local ingredients. One glass of chilled Prosecco later and I was ready for the feast to begin. First up was fresh mozzarella with chili oil and roasted garlic drizzled with balsamic. I can't get enough of garlic, and this was delicious. Then creamy polenta with roasted wild mushrooms. Earthy and rich. Next came a cauliflower soup that tasted like pureed cauliflower with just enough cream to make it silky. It was decadent. I wanted to lick the bowl, in fact I may have. One dish I remembered from my original visit was roasted onions with parmesan, which they weren't serving, but the server was kind enough to scare us up an order. This was my favorite appetizer - basically french onion soup without the soup part. Heavenly. Then a couple of unremarkable pasta dishes. One was a papardelle with bolognese and the other was a rigatoni with cauliflower and spinach. I didn't eat much as I didn't want to fill up on pasta. My entree was the Chicken Mario, which was an organic chicken breast sauteed in brown butter. It was so flavorful and chicken-y tasting. I don't order chicken in restaurants very often as it can be dry, but this was so juicy. I added a squeeze of lemon and it was perfection. Entrees are served with spicy roasted potatoes and brussel sprouts. I am not a brussel sprout fan, but these were caramelized and had bacon bits mixed in. It's amazing what a little bacon can do to this otherwise humble vegetable. I skipped dessert because I couldn't eat another bite, but had something on the dessert menu really spoken to me, I'm sure I would have found room. I would happily go back, with or without a gift certificate. A solid dining experience.",0.9965,0.803,0.167,0.03,0.46863143631436305

Stone arches, thick wood tables, low lighting...this place is perfect for that hot date and equally perfect for group dinners and celebrations! I was here for a late night snack, so I can't comment on the Prix Fixe menu, but loved what we ordered a la Carte! The artichoke bruschetta sounded heavenly, but we had to go with the red and orange beets with goat cheese and mixed greens. I'm part Polish but have never liked beets. But this beet salad was ""Beet Happening!"" Yum. Even though the homemade Pumpkin Ravioli looked yummy and was made with Wisconsin Pumpkins, this 'Sconny boy had to go with the gnocchi. Not a closed-shell gnocchi, like most I've had, this was a nice lighter take on the classic Italian dish. To me gnocchi is to Italian food, what mole is to Mexican food; it's a unique dish that speaks volumes about the restaurant. Osteria Via Stato's gnocchi was very good, but still had me thinkin' about that Pumpkin Ravioli.... Service was excellent all night! We went with the ""Just Bring Me Wine!"" special of 3 flights for $15 per person. We were brought a dry white, an earthy red, and a wonderfully fruity red called Librana Ciro, from the Calabria region. ""To Calabria!"" We lingered well after others had left, finishing our wine, and our server said that was quite alright!

The atmosphere is very cozy and subdued--very fitting for a cold autumn's night in Chicago.  We were accompanied by a few sales execs from Boston and immediately they were very impressed.  The service was phenomenal as was the food and wine pairings.   1.  I had picked the wines prior to the event--required if choosing the Italian Dinner Party Option.  Both were ventures between Mario Batali and italian wineries.  Tocai Friulano Bastianich 2006 (white) was light and fruity which paired very well with the appetizers and first courses.   Morellino di Scansano ""I Perazzi"" La Mozza (red) was a medium-bodied sangiovese that paired very well with the pasta and second courses.  Very smooth and calculated movement from the white to the red, and was very well suited as we progressed through our courses. 2.  At the table: Salt-crusted ciabbata bread-good but I didn't enjoy the sweetness.  Marinated Mozzarella with fresh basil and chili-also very good.  Shaved Prosciutto and Apple-Stellar.  This was one of the freshest slices of prosciutto I have had apart from Pastoral's selection.  Olives-Good. 3.  Antipasti:  Caesar Salad and Calamari-Good.  Parmesan-crusted wood roasted onions-PHENOMENAL.  I have never had onions presented in this fashion with a creamy and slightly torched cheese crust.  Delish! 4.  Primi:  Parpadelle with Duck Ragu-Yummy.  Fresh Cavatelli with Mushrooms & Brown Butter-TO DIE FOR.  This is one of the best pastas I have ever had, and I've been to spiaggia and the likes.  This surprisingly is up to par with the quality, taste, and ingenuity of the pricier venues.   5.  Secondi:  Prime Ribeye with crispy shallots.  SUPERB.  I have been to several steakhouses:  chophouse, gibsons, david burke, tavern, keefers...you name it.  This might be the best ribeye I have ever had, 20oz. on the bone, charred to perfection and cooked exactly to Medium. 6.  Sides:  Calabrian Potatoes and Brussel Sprouts-Very good. 7.  Dolce:  Double chocolate tart-simple and a fine end to a perfect meal. This was one of the best 5 course progressive dinners I have had and I forgot to mention the best part: each course, with the exception of the second course, is UNLIMITED.  We were too full to oblige, however, this option is perfect for hungry groups.  OSTERIA-understated indulgence.",0.9978,0.778,0.188,0.034,0.39622222222222225

There was constant tending to beverage levels and dishes.  We ate the Italian feast where multiple courses come at you. The antipasto was my favorite part. They offered delectable little meatballs and fresh mozzarella and olive to start. Then came the onion parm bake and a beet salad with feta. The next course was the pasta where a linguine with pesto and a penne with bacon pasta was offered. The main is where I have my problem. I ordered the pork chop and gf ordered the shortrib. Both were extremely over salted. While the cuts were nice and presentation was appealing the taste of salt was just to overwhelming.  Overall it seems to be reaching to hit its price point. While the service is excellent and they really do dress up to be considered high end.

2008-04-07,2.0,"I hadn't been here in a while, and they've made quite a few changes.  Now there's an a la carte menu, but they still encourage the ""family dinner"", which is what we came for anyway. The level of what's included in the prix fixe has definitely declined.  There was only one meat-based item in the appetizers this time... veal meatballs (not my favorite).  The others were (a) tiny balls of fresh mozzerella -- three of 'em!  (b) sliced onion baked with parmasen, (c) roasted radicchio with a vinaigrette dressing. All pretty low rent. The two pastas were too similar to each other, and they were served in the tiniest bowls I'd ever seen.  One was a basic meat sauce (yawn!) and the other was a tasty homemade sausage-based sauce. Finally, the entree list has been expanded a bit, but more than half of the choices had upcharges!  (It used to be that the only upcharge was for the steak).  And the upcharges were not small... most were $8 and some (like the steak) were $12.  We selected entrees that did not have upcharges... I chose the shortribs and my husband had lamb.  They were nice, but in no way would those be considered full portions. The whole process only took about an hour... in the past, this was a two hour dinner.   I might have felt better if the prices were lower, but this was $39 per person without upcharges! Basically, guys, if you really can't do a good job at $39, raise the price.  Don't downscale the food or kill me with upcharges.",0.7693,0.851,0.085,0.065,0.5616666666666668

There is definitely not a lack of service.. plates and silverware are taken away and replaced, and water glasses are constantly refilled (you have the choice of still or sparkling). Which was nice.. one of my brother's pet peeves is when he finishes a glass of water and has to wait for a refill, to the point where he has gotten up and taken the pitcher back to the table himself after waiting too long. I also liked that the water was served chilled, instead of cooled with ice. But I guess that's enough about water. They start you off with a plate of olives and some bread. No butter, but the oil in the olive dish is great for dipping the bread in. We decided to do the prix fixe menu that they say they're known for. Appetizers were nothing spectacular, but were still delicious, and we ordered seconds of a few. My brother ordered a gorgonzola-crusted filet mignon for dinner, and said it was probably the best steak he has ever had, which is something since he loves to order steak. I also ordered steak and thought it was delicious, and my wife ordered veal. She also had wine flight, and the tastings were very generous.. pretty much amounting to 4 full glasses of wine. Not sure how often I'll go back since it's a little more than I like to spend when going out for dinner (we paid extra for the steaks, and ended up around $50/head for food), but I would definitely recommend it.",0.9947,0.827,0.168,0.005,0.5270531400966183

2007-01-23,5.0,"As my boyfriend put it best, ""solid performance!""  We went to this restaurant over the weekend after hearing mixed reviews and still eagerly wanting to try it.  As to be expected on a Saturday night, the restaurant was busy and we were asked to wait on our reservation.  We found our way through the crowded host line to the bar area and I squeezed my way in for a few drinks.  We were feeling pressured to stand in one  of two awkward locations - either pressed against the other bar patrons or literally sitting on top of the customers who were unfortunate enough to be seated on the aisle adjacent to the bar - the same thoroughfare used to get to and from the coat check and hotel.  Needless to say, we were anxious to be seated.  I enjoyed my ginger pear bellini, although my boyfriend was a little disappointed by the limited gin options.  We were seated shortly after the rest of our party arrived, and from there the night just kept getting better.  We were unsure of what to expect as far as seating arrangements seeing as we knew this restaurant was known for their ""family-style"" dining.  While we passed several communal tables - we were escorted to a more typical tableclothed arrangement.  We were immediately greeted by someone offering complimentary spring or sparkling water  - which by the way was not more than a quarter empty at any point in the evening before being refilled.  The server came by our table shortly after presenting us with the menus and wine list - as she went over her presentation to us ""newbies"" it was clear that she strongly recommended the family style dining. For $36/person - the table got unlimited servings of 5 different appetizers, two different pastas, one entree from a list of about 12(some of the options are an additional upcharge), and unlimited quantities of 2 sides.  This gave us an opportunity to try as many things of the menu as possible without having to do much choosing (and to be honest we didn't even look at the a la carte option).  The wine list was equally catered to all knowlege ranges - offering a typical bottle list, about 40 red and whites offered by the glass/half-litre/bottle and a list of the top 40 wines they offered under $40.  We chose a bottle and a mezza-litre and were well on our way.  We loved everything we tried and highly recommend getting your hands on some of their carmelized onions with melted parmesan, the short rib over polenta and filet with blue cheese crust, and don't miss desert if not just to try their candied orange peels (made in house, blanched 7 times, carmelized and sprinkled with sugar and having the likeness to candy store bought crystalized orange slices).  Each person that brought food to our table had impecible service skills and carefully described what we were about to indulge in.  I would most definitely go back - and hopefully next time get a chance to sit at the communal tables - where people seemed to be having just as much fun sharing their experience at Osteria Via Stato with people they had just met sitting down.",0.9926,0.849,0.121,0.031,0.4707682539682539
2007-01-17,4.0,"Impressive selection of wine from many different Italy Providences.  They just recently added an Italian-inspired a la carte menu, which we had the pleasure of trying during a wine tasting event we attended there last night.  All of the new wines paired with the a la carte items were very tasty.    This was our first experience at Osteria Via Stato, although it definitely won't be our last.   As a side note, the restaurant is constantly holding wine tasting and dinner events through Lettuce Entertain You which are reasonably priced ,and they are always an enjoyable experience.",0.9313,0.854,0.146,0.0,0.431118881118881
2006-12-02,5.0,"I've now been here three times and enjoyed each visit.  My girlfriend and I went here on our first real date almost two years ago and we stopped in again the other night after a few drinks at Pops for Champagne. The rustic interior gives it a nice feel and the fact that your party can share a table with neighboring diners adds to the liveliness of the place.  My previously-living-in-Rome girlfriend loves the atmosphere and says it reminders her of a true Osteria in Rome.   Our most recent visit yielded new information.  They now offer a full menu from which you can order a ""normal"" meal.  Luckily, they still offer what they call the ""Italian Dinner Party.""  I must say, I find this new option a little saddening, as the original concept was a lot of fun. Of course, we ordered the dinner party and the ""Just bring me Wine,"" which pairs a wine with each of the courses.  The food was all excellent and the wine was especially nice, due to the special offering where we got the mid-level wines for the price of the low-level selections. The service was attentive and informative.  Each dish was explained and served promptly.  There were also several opportunities for us to have second helpings of the Antipasti or Pasta dishes.   Despite the change, I still enjoyed my visit and I'm positive I will be returning from time to time, just make sure they keep things up to snuff.  A lovely place to go, if you ask me.",0.9942,0.775,0.208,0.017,0.5286734338458475

2006-11-08,4.0,"This place was a great location for a business lunch with my department. The menu was selected in advance, but I did have a selection when it came to the main course. The pumpkin soup was to die for. I've been trying to replicate it but have failed pretty miserably each time. Also, this is the only time I have enjoyed brussell sprouts. Although what doesn't taste good when it is covered in butter (insert Paula Deen reference here).",-0.7756,0.703,0.118,0.179,0.7104166666666667
2006-10-29,4.0,"I would really like to give this place a 3.5 star, but whole numbers are the only option.   I was visiting a good friend in Chicago and she took me here.  The atmosphere was really great.  The people that put together the space did a great job.  We had to wait a bit for our table and so we ordered some wine at the bar.  My friend wanted white wine.  Since Sancerre seems to be my white of the moment  I asked the bartender if he had any.  Boy, did I get the stink eye!  I know this is an italian restaurant, but, I didn't think my question should have been so repulsive to him.  They have California wines on the menu for goodness sakes.  Why not french?  So, we ended up ordering an italian white of course. Now to the meal.  I don't want to get too detailed.  I just want to talk about the stand out moments.  Let me start by saying the bread is some of the best I have ever had.  I would have been satisfied just going there for bread and wine.  My friend and I opted for the tasting menu which comes with several courses.  One of the first courses was a salad that was absolutely delicious.  It had a blue cheese dressing that was so mild that even my blue cheese hating friend loved it.  Another earlier course was an onion tart that was outstanding.  Next came two pasta courses.  They were good, but not as memorable as the salad and onion tart.  I just remembered thinking that the pasta was perfectly cooked.  Next came my entree which was the braised shortribs in a red wine reduction served over polenta.  It was good, but a little bit over salted.   The service was very good.  My only criticism is that the server didn't seem to be too knowlegable about the wine.  But, that didn't really bother me.   Overall it was a lovely dining experience.  I recommend it!",0.9982,0.724,0.239,0.037,0.4429279279279278
2005-08-25,4.0,"I just discovered this place a couple of months ago.  It is primo, you get wine pairings with your meal and it is very authentic italien.  You don't have to eat in the dining room, they also have a great bar area as you walk in where you can get great wine and small appetizers such as a cheese board if you are not that hungry. I highly reccomend it.",0.8481,0.885,0.115,0.0,0.6525
2005-08-13,1.0,"I had read about Osteria Via Stato in Bon Appetit and it seemed to come highly recommended from a variety of food related magazines and online reviews. Went there after dinner for cheese course and wine - what a mistake. First of all it took forever to get our glasses of wine, and when we tried to order the cheese our server was not familiar with the cheese selections. When the cheese finally arrived (we ordered 5 cheeses), the pieces were miniscule even by restaurant standards, and one of the cheeses had a horribly off taste. The three of us tasted it to be sure (2 of our group are professional chefs) and everyone agreed it was bad. We called over the cheese monger and he actually argued with us about the state of the cheese. He wouldn't even taste it to confirm - just told us he had been in the business for 20 years and knew what he was talking about. So pompous and no idea about service. I won't be recommending this place regardless of who owns it.",-0.8303,0.888,0.035,0.077,0.5528888888888889
