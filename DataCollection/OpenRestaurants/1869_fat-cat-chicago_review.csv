They have really great burgers & recently updated their menu to include some nice new items.  They always have great weekly specials. Who can turn down a $5 burger, and it's not a tiny cheap burger, these are juicy & beefy! Thursday night is $5 Martini ( Uptown Royale & Riveria are excellent!)  The staff are friendly & always have a couple good recommendations on their extensive draft list. Another must try on their menu is the Pimento Grilled Cheese!

2017-08-17,3.0,"I oftentimes when moving to a new area, I venture out looking for my go-to restaurant, coffeeshop, bar, grocery store, and library. That's when I found Fat Cat. I got hooked.  I love the open space and so much sunlight during the day, and the low lights and music at night. I have been there about four times so far, and they have been great, until I went back on a Friday late afternoon with the plan to stay for at least a couple of hours with a friend.  I walked into Fat Cat alone and told them that I will order a drink and my friend is going to be here shortly. As it began getting busier, they completly lost their table-side manners. And just because I was one, or two when my friend arrived, we were completly ignored as they shifted their complete attention to their bigger parties, which there weren't many of them. No smiles, ignoring tables (I saw other people with their hands up trying to get their attention, too), service was very slow, and I really had to flag them down to come take care of my orders. What bothered me is that I found them many times gathering in a corner chit chatting while we were still waiting for them to come to our table. I was seated on a table I didn't want, wasn't served water or given menus, like they always do. I felt totally forgotten.  Their food isn't consistent on busy days, either. For example, I always order the Calamari when I go to Fat Cat, and it was always crunchy, deliciously zesty and in a good portion. This time it came soft, and the quantity was so much less than usual. That's when I could tell clearly it was frozen. The cook came and dryly put the Calamari on the table like he didn't want to be there! And I had to ask them to bring plates, napkins, and utensils.  You see why it's taking me a while now to go back.  Fat Cat, you have such a great place, just keep it together when it gets busy please, if you want people to continue visiting. People want to feel welcomed and comfortable. You have the potential.",0.988,0.808,0.134,0.058,0.46142453951277485
2017-08-14,4.0,"I first stumbled upon Fat Cat during my boyfriend's birthday last year. I was instantly drawn to Fat Cat because it easily accommodated our large group size. They have ample tables for no matter what group size you bring to them.  Whenever they aren't hosting something they have the pool table out. The bar is up to date and colorful. I love that they offer daily deals that range from martini night to discounted foods on certain nights.  Fat Cat is the place to go if you're looking for someone to sponsor your adult sports leagues. I had the great fortune to work with the Manager Drew to get Fat Cats to sponsor our recent Beach Volleyball team. Drew gave us shirts, a 20% off our bill, and we always had a table ready for us when we finished our games.  Since we had a eight week league, I had the opportunity to try all of the different dishes whether ordering it myself or nabbing a bite from my friend. Fat Cat was very consistent with their food quality. The drinks were reasonably priced and they have a massive drink menu so there is something for everyone.  The one thing that did cause frustration was that we had to repeatedly remind the waitress about the discount (even though we had the same waitress every week). The waitress would some times not give us the discount or wouldn't remember that it was 20% off and not 10 or 15% off. Once the manager that was on duty found out about the issue, she ensured we got our discounts going forward with no issues. I would definitely recommend visiting Fat Cat!",0.9617,0.874,0.1,0.026,0.4657894736842104

The salad was excellent and big enough for two people.  I'm from Buffalo NY and the wings were pretty darn good.  The Buffalo wing sauce was good and hot.  The wings were a good size and cooked perfectly. The only thing I would change is their blue cheese dressing.  It was good but not like what is traditionally served in Buffalo.

This could be an awesome place but t feels like the staff just doesn't care a whole awful lot.  The service was ""fine"" but the food was mediocre.  Just ok.  And the wings were rubbery undercooked skin. Pouting sauce tasted of flour (not cooked down enough).  Calamari was acceptable.  I will say the drinks were really good and reasonably priced.

2017-06-06,4.0,"What's better than a working lunch? A working happy hour!  I met a friend here to a plan an event we were co-facilitating. We slipped in just before the end of happy hour, ordered some $6 manhattans and some 2-for-one apps: buffalo wings and panko friend mac & cheese bites.  The manhattans were small (a little heavy on the ice, which shouldn't be in a manhattan) but tasty. I'd probably go for the $6 glass of wine or something else next time. There were lots of beer and wine happy hour options and 2 or 3 cocktails. The buffalo wings were big, tasty, and had a bit of heat. I would definitely get them again. The mac & cheese bites were bigger than I expected and the textures were different than I'm used to. The panko added some nice crunch and the cheese inside was really creamy over some penne.  My friend also had the pork belly sandwich and was thrilled with it. The fries were overly salted, almost inedible, but we were so full from the other items that it didn't really affect that meal. Our server messed up our check a little, but it got crazy busy by 7pm, and she was managing a lot. She fixed it right away and was really attentive despite the crowd, so it all balanced out.

2017-06-03,3.0,"i want to give them more like 2.5 starts as opposed to 3, but i'll do the 3 because of the presentation. Overall, the meal was mediocre due to lack of seasoning. Like, there was no seasoning at all. It tasted like i was eating water. i order the fried chicken sandwich (13.00), and the pineapple upside down cake (6.00, comes with ice cream, but i didn't get the icre cream because i ordered delivery and did not want it to melt). Chicken was fried well done, as i asked; thank you guys for that. It was a pretty clean piece of chicken breast as well; tasted very natural. Nonetheless, none of it was seasoned. The remoulade was also not flavored; it actually took away the little flavor the chicken breast had. And the poor fries- i mean seriously... at least season the fries; i just don't get it.  Lastly, the beautifully presented, flavorfully moist pineapple cake is pretty much deserving of 2.7 of the 3 star rating for this review. It saved the meal, and my palate... However, it was the size of a cupcake and it costed 6.00 (mind you i opted to not get the ice cream that came along with it). Nonetheless, i was expecting a better sized portion. It was so good, i find it insulting to my taste buds to only give me such a small bite of it, especially for the price paid. However, i do understand that this is more of a bar/waitress type restaurant, so it's not as surprising to pay 6 bucks for such a small dessert. i would not order it again unless i can get more than one, otherwise i'd simply be teasing my palate, which isn't a pleasurable experience.",0.9854,0.761,0.167,0.072,0.6114406966490299

The food is consistently delicious and the cocktail/beer menu is varied and tasty!  I was here for brunch with my fiancé in the patio and service was so slow I felt like I was being held hostage. Our server (Katherine) had blinders on and would rarely check in with tables in her section. Took 15 min to get a beer after it was ordered. Some tables sat for 15+ minutes with having their order taken or waters dropped. She didn't appear to be using her book to write down orders resulting in taking orders from one table at a time. Agonizing.  I serve in a busy Wrigleyville bar/restaurant so I understand being slammed but she didn't communicate this to us or any other table if that was the case. The manager (I think), Drew, ran drinks, took orders, and processed bills for the patio which was really helpful and supportive!  Of course I'll come here again because the food is that awesome but I'll be more mindful of flagging down this server if she's taking care of my table again.",0.9731,0.874,0.115,0.011,0.5710648148148147

The crawfish wasn't seasoned well and pieces were funky, I was worried about it making me sick and it did a little. The set up was nicer than it needed to be. Any crawfish boil I've ever been doesn't make you pick your crawfish one by one and put them on a ceramic plate. It was a bit much. Again, the seasoning was just non existent so it made it not worth the work of picking them one by one. I also was disgusted by the ""King Cake"". It wasn't a traditional King Cake but instead a regular white cake with decorations. A King Cake typically has filling and is a much more condensed cake. It was very odd. The Hurricanes were good and that's it. I know this is Chicago but I couldn't help but leave very disappointed. I will not be going back.",-0.9229,0.814,0.043,0.143,0.4529842706313294

My friend and I both ordered the Hot Mess Burger, which was described to be their own take on the Big Mac. I don't know if I can really say that it's like a Big Mac other than it being a burger with similar toppings, but I guess that's a good thing if you think McDonald's is trash because this burger was glorious.  Unfortunately, the service was a really lacking. Our server let us seat ourselves (no big deal), but didn't bring us any napkins or silverware. Considering that my friend and I ordered a burger called a ""hot mess,"" that was a bit of a bummer. Our food came, but it took a while for our server to come back for us to ask for what we needed so we had to just sit with our plates for a while.

She quickly brought our stuff we asked for, but didn't make an effort to apologize for not having given us napkins or utensils in the first place. She wasn't rude about it, so I guess that's a plus?

Without modifiers or substitutions, the food came out quickly! I personally enjoyed the poutine. It was covered in gravy, cheese curds, bacon and scallions.

2016-10-23,1.0,"Wow, what a rip off... We stopped in here to try their brunch.  I'll give them points for food tasting good.  But that's where the good ends. After walking in, and seating ourselves, we sat there a good while before a waiter finally noticed us and dropped off menus.  He eventually comes back to take our order, and again to drop off our orange juice.  The orange juice tastes like the cheapest store bought orange juice, and is served in a glass half full of ice, so really you only get half a glass of orange juice.  More on this later.  After the orange juice is dropped off, another waitress comes by to drop off menus.  Um, we already ordered, and have been here probably half an hour now?  Hungry and wanting food? Well it takes at least 20, maybe 30 minutes, after ordering before our food finally arrives.  I don't know, maybe they were waiting for the chicken to lay an egg or something...our orders were simple enough, and they didn't appear to be slammed, so no reason I could see for it to take that long. Waitress comes by, and asks if we need anything else.  Some jelly would be nice...she comes back with 1....yes 1 little packet of jelly, the same cheapy jelly packets you get by the dozen at your run of the mill diner..  Um, are they stingy here much? So we eat.  Small portions, fitting I suppose.  And then the bill comes.  And my husband about falls over.  That orange juice...that mediocre ice filled orange juice?  They wanted $4 each.  Really?  Maybe if it was fresh squeezed, and more then a couple sips worth.  It was watered down store bought juice loaded with ice.  It was worth about $1.50.  They also charged $4 for EACH little pattie of sausage.  UM???  THE MENU SAID IT WAS $2!  Here's a copy/paste from their website of what we ordered...we ordered the Breakfast Crock with turkey sausage.  Please tell me if I missed where it said adding sausage is $4: Breakfast Crock 10 Scrambled eggs, kale, caramelized onions, house potatoes and cheddar. Choice of toast. Add any of the following for $2: seitan, turkey sausage, pork sausage or bacon. I didn't miss something, did I?  Also, this sounds quite pricey for what you get.  Maybe 2 eggs worth of scramble, lots of onions for filler since onions are cheap, and 1 piece of toast.  Yes, 1.  And that added meat is served on the side...one would think it's part of the crock - at least that's what they served us today. So if our waitress is reading this, you got stiffed on a tip for A) overcharging us, B) severely slow, and unapologetic for slowness, service, C) expensive crappy orange juice - who on earth serves orange juice in a glass half filled with ice?  Or with ice period?  D) did I mention overcharging?",0.8635,0.89,0.066,0.044,0.4520394979697305

2016-05-12,2.0,"I used to like this place. The food is still good, but there has been some questionable business practices that have made me question whether I'll come back again. Once I went in and ordered a food special off the menu, pointing to the item on the menu in front of the price and then the bill came and it was double and was told they don't honor specials during concerts. Fair enough. But how am I to know some obscure band next door was playing? Or maybe tell that to me when I am pointing to the price and food item? Fast forward to the other night, there is now a warning at the bottom of the menu in very tiny lettering stating this. So Monday night I am there and I asked the server if we missed the $5 burger special she said no the menu is confusing that Happy Hour is from 4-6pm but the special was all night. So I order a drink from the menu she handed me and pointed to the drink with the $6 price tag. When the bill came it was $60 for two $5 burgers and two drinks. I asked what happened she said it was really confusing, but that the Happy hour prices are from 4-6 and that the real prices are in the back of the menu, and flips it to me showing they are $12 and $13. One of the drinks was so weak it tasted like straight pineapple juice, she offered for me to pay $5 for an additional shot. Pay $5 to make it be full strength? Uh, no.  The Happy Hour menu should never have been handed to me in the first place if the specials were over, and maybe if I am pointing to a drink and its price when ordering maybe saying ""this isn't the real price because our menu is extremely confusing/misleading and it's actually now $13"" She just said ""Sorry about that"" when I said it was misleading, but didn't seem to really care at all. This all coupled by the fact that we had to order water three times and never got any before I finally went to the bar and got it on my own. And the music was incredibly loud and bad. I probably won't be going back. It just seems shady and no one seems to care. It's a shame too it's a nice bar",0.9373,0.771,0.126,0.103,0.5566468253968255

The atmosphere here was also pretty cool, kind of eclectic decor and mooood lighting.  The cocktail list was also really good.  We started out with old fashioneds, but both found them to be a bit too sweet for our liking.  But the flavor was there, they used proper big ice cubes and had a great orange peel twist, if you don't like it too sweet maybe just note that when ordering.  The next drink however was the show stopper...Spanish Gin Tonic.  If you are a G&T fan, get here ASAP and will probably be the best you've ever had.  It's served in this giant goblet of a glass and is just so super refreshing.  It has juniper berries in there, which must add to the flavor b/c seriously was the best G&T I've had (even beats out my general fav of a Hendricks with cucumber!). Food was also really good as well.  I had the turkey burger, which had a really moist and nicely seasoned patty, topped with caramelized onions and a cranberry chutney.  Really good overall, but wished the chutney had a bit more tart flavor.  My friend had the beet carpaccio, which definitely exceeded expectations.  ""Carpaccio"" made us think it may be kind of small, but it was huge, with tons of beet slices, topped with goat cheese, arugula etc. etc.  Really yummy.

Pretty cool deal and doesn't cost anything beyond the individual beer amounts. You can't drink all 12 in one sitting since they are all beers with a high ABV. We also got Reuben Balls and 2 orders of wings to start, with Asian Zing and Spicy BBQ sauces. The Reuben balls were awesome, I just wish there were more! The Asian zing was a chef favorite, but none of us were too impressed. It was a little sweet, and we were all spicy guys. The spicy bbq was better but didn't blow us away. Later we got more wings (classic Buffalo sauce this time) and dusted calamari. The calamari was really good as well, I just wish it came with a cocktail sauce instead of the OK tangy aioli it had.

2015-09-20,5.0,"I am a very picky diner. I manage an upscale Italian restaurant in the city, with a restaurant group that has five concepts and 30 storefronts to their name. I am also on the opening team for our new sports bar concept slated to open in 6 weeks. I worked my way up after serving for more then ten years. I love restaurants.  I know them well.  I have been coming to Fat Cat for years, especially on football Sunday. I often come in with my fellow Vikings fan and his daughter, but lately by myself.  I was sad to see the manager Andrew leave, he will be missed. He always took ""over the top"" care of us.  The new management has picked up right where the old left off. The new manager (black glasses) has really gone above and beyond two weeks in a row to find a TV to put the Vikings on for me. She has been genuinely  attentive and courteous with no hint of annoyance at my many requests.     The service staff is really fantastic. They are always knowledgeable and friendly. I am not exaggerating,  I have never had a dud in the lot. That kind of service consistency is rare in this industry.  I was a bit worried when they switched chefs recently,  as the food and service is why I come (I don't drink, and that's another thing, I am never made to feel uncomfortable that I don't drink  and I value that) but the new dishes are inspired and delicious.  I recommend any dish with the pork belly. The shredded beef hash today was also rather good. Lean tender beef. Perfect SS eggs.  Kudos to my server today, I never had to ask for more coffee once, and I drink about 5 cups.  Full disclosure-- I recently moved from uptown to edgewater and tried a competitor closer to my house,  suffice to say that was my mistake (review coming later once I calm down from it).  So I came back to old faithful. Fat Cat. Keep it up ladies and gentlemen, people are taking notice. I know I recommend  you often and now my wife (Hospitality Manager) has started bringing industry friends as well.  I even told my corporate Executive Chef that if he's ever in uptown, the pork belly and service are worth stopping in for.  Mychal Rayne",0.9942,0.762,0.174,0.064,0.48514567443138873

It will be fun! Only $11 a turn, folks. You have been given a half-filled martini glass with a lime wedge on it, containing about 4 ozs of rather orange-colored liquid. The drink you ordered contains only clear or pale yellow ingredients. Also, it's incredibly bitter. What happened? Rogue Campari promo team? Dropperful of the essence of the Trump campaign? No one knows! Here's a prosecco topper for your bitter, orange-colored mystery ""drink"". Thanks for playing. Is that guy in the cargo shorts playing with that woman's hair? She doesn't seem to know him. That's weird and he just knocked over a chair. Hey do you have another $11? Let's play again, I really like a Martinez.

Beers, pork nachos and we both got the house burgers. The nachos came and we used the vinegar on them thanks to the waitress's suggestion. It seemed strange at first but it was awesome. Besides the vinegar, these were hands down the best nachos I've ever had. I wish more places back home (New Jersey) made pork nachos. The pork was so juicy they have to serve this dish is a type of bowl to prevent a mess.  Next the burger. We weren't expecting it but the burgers were even better than the nachos! Brie cheese, bacon, heaven. Burgers were also cooked to order, which I find is somehow a rare (pun) thing to find these days. The beef was juicy and full of flavor.

We decided to eat at Fat Cat before a show at the Aragon.  Our bartender was funny and engaging, plus she made great recommendations all evening.  My favorite drink was the bloody mary which was wonderfully spicy and peppery.   Foodwise, my burger was well cooked and the fries were crispy and salty.  They provided a hot pepper infused vinegar which tasted even better than the regular malt vinegar I like to splash on fries.  I'll definitely head back for $5 burgers on Mondays. Before heading out, I noticed a pool table and shuffleboard table in the back.  Combined with the TVs, I think this will be a good place to hang out and watch some football this season!",0.9843,0.768,0.215,0.018,0.6173076923076923

The results are schizophrenic, as though a team of morning-zoo radio show execs tossed in every motif they hoped would resonate with the 'edgy"" 18-34 white male demographic (like the cringe-inducing ""tough guy"" Sopranos grammar throughout the menu--which, by the way, seems to have been written to make you to say ""balls"" as much as possible). All this and a build-your-own mimosa bar for mom!  Fat Cat's real problem is inconsistent food. Interesting recipes too often fail for slacker follow-through. Sometimes their spicy bean burger is the best burger--vegetarian or not--I've had in years (no, really), and other times it's a lukewarm mess that tastes like refried beans plopped straight from a can. Fat Cat's ""House made"" sauces are often delicious...when the kitchen remembers to include them. And why even bother with that french fried jalapeño on top of the ""Cajun"" burger when, 3 times out of 5, it arrives to your table ice cold and rock hard. If Fat Cat doesn't care about doing right the little things that separate gastropub food from bar food, it should ditch its gourmet pretensions and just do bar food right.

Now, admittedly we were with a largish group (8 or 9 of us) but the place was only 1/2 full when we arrived. We were immediately told ""ten minutes"" to clean a table for us. Really? Ten minutes? Sure enough, that's how long it took mostly because they didn't bother to hurry. Twenty minutes after we sat down was when our drinks arrived. THEN the food order was taken. Forty minutes later our food arrived. Yup, we're now 1 hour 10 minutes into the experience. We were starved and wolfed down our food, but - of course - it took extra time to get the bill. All said and done we were at Fat Cat for 1 hour 50 minutes - for beers and pub food. Oh, and the place never got that busy. If Fat Cat could figure out their service problems, they'd do gang busters. We were there because their chief neighborhood competitor - Crew - was so busy they had a line out the door so it's not like the customers aren't available.

Kranshaft is at best a 5 dollar beer you get it locally, so why the near import price? 2. Their food though creative isn't that great. I got the friend mac n' cheese balls and those things are huge. They better be consider 4 is 8 bucks. Now here is the problem the mac n' cheese is really cheese pasta incased in breading. Pencil Points/Ziti noodles are not macaroni noodles. Thus this not mac and cheese. 2a. The first order of mac and cheese I got was hot on the outside and ice cold on the inside.They were quick to fix this and even gave me a beer while I waited. The second one was hot nearly all the way through, but two bites into it I was over it. It really just isn't that good. Yes it is creamy, but it is more milky than cheesy aka tasteless.

I was surprised that the bar was so empty for a bears game, they have plenty of t.v's. It took me a few seconds to realize the problem, I did not see the Bears game on any t.v.  I asked the bartender if they were planning to show the Bears game, she said that it was on one t.v., really? That is goofy to me seeing how this is Chicago. I had to talk really loud because the bartender could hardly hear me over the song ""Take My Breath Away""that  blasted in the nearly empty bar while football games were on (I guess they are back to the 80s music again; one step forward and two steps back). I asked the bartender if they were planing to turn to music off and turn the sound on for one of football games. The bartender's response still boggles my mind, ""Maybe a little later, if it gets more crowded."" Maybe it would be easier for them to attract a sold crowd for a 12pm football game if the customer knew that they did have to listen to 80s music blasting during a football game. Fat Cat it is ok to have an identity, besides the place people go before a concert.   I told her thank you and that I will go somewhere else. I did, I went to bar a little further north on Broadway that has no problem having an identity, the bar was packed, the Bears game was on most of the t.vs. and if the someone wanted to watch another game there were a couple of t.vs dedicated to other games.

That being said...this is what went down at the ol' Fat Cat: We had spoke to the events person, who was working there before she up and left...without calling or notifying anyone, about hosting a private party.  Things were awesome, had all the paper work, and then when time came for event to happen...NO one didn't have a clue as to what we were talking about, when we arrived. HOWEVER, the manager  for the evening there (Chris, I believe is his name) came to the rescue!  Sure it was awkward having to watch him kick people out, while they were still eating...he apologized more than he should have...again it wasn't his fault or Fat Cat's fault that past employee left everyone in the dark. Anyway, they got their sh!t together quick!  Every ones face sauced up from the amazing wings & drinks, fun times in the photo booth, pretty cool tunes from the DJ, and they have an amazing wait staff.  I go to fat cats to hang, have drinks, eat wings, enjoy my company and the polite staff... along with other bar activities.

Knock the volume by 1/2. You'll get more business. I have a background noise problem and a lot of people I know do too, and you know what they do? They pass you up and go to crew two doors down instead where the volume level is reasonable an the same sports are on. Food: I love the Aragon burger (aeoli, chorizo, carmelized onions) and the Thanksgiving Sandwich (green bean casserole, turkey cranberry and stuffing on the sandwich).

2011-08-12,2.0,"As a frequent patron of The Annoyance, when the comedy shows let out I usually haul my friends over into the Fat Cat for cocktails and chatter. I've noticed a weird trend though. When I bring a gaggle of female friends to Fat Cat, good times are had by all. The drinks keep coming, and food is tasty. The waitresses are friendly and stop by frequently. Everything is good! But when it's just me and my boyfriend, we get an unbelievable cold shoulder. The waitstaff gave us weird looks, threw menus at us, snatched them back as though we are inconveniencing them by ordering, and abandoned our table to the ages after slopping down drinks in front of us. Flagging down a waitress for a second round or things like silverware was nearly impossible, yet I frequently saw them clustering behind the bar talking and actually even looking over at us, waving. After failing to get more drinks for 20 minutes, I finally had to go up to the bar and request the check personally because our waitress had migrated over to the righthand side and never bothered to come back. I get the feeling that couples aren't wanted because we aren't a big group or flashy-dressed tramp-stampers on the cucumber hunt. I guess we take up valuable space in the cavernous and usually empty lefthand seating area that could be used by sloppy-drunk frat guys. But the frat kids weren't there when we went, so there wasn't even the excuse of overcrowding and being lost in the hubbub. It was really puzzling, because with groups of 3 - 7 the service kicks butt and takes names. But when it's just the two of us, we're lepers. This has happened twice already, and I'm ready to move my impromptu post-comedy hen parties elsewhere because of it.",0.9386,0.834,0.106,0.061,0.446360153256705

The thing is, I've stopped in here about half a dozen times, because it's so close, or because other friends who don't know better suggest it, and I go along. I always--ALWAYS--regret it.

Not so much. * When we got there, we could see TWO servers for the whole place, and ONE bartender (at least one other server eventually showed up, and from what we can tell, the manager pitched in). People at tables were going to the bar and standing in line for their drinks, rather than waiting 15 minutes to get  a cold one brought by their server.  * It wasn't the kitchen's fault--a member of our party peeked in on her way back from the bathroom and saw full plates of ready food topping every available surface. * How does a restaurant run out of lemons? Well, they did. So, our iced tea was sans fruit--until they ran out of iced tea. I switched to Diet Coke. * We ordered appetizers (wings). It was 20 minutes before our server even checked to see how we were doing. When he saw we didn't have our food, he went away. The food didn't arrive until nearly ANOTHER half an hour later, when it was brought over by the manager--who didn't apologize for our long wait, or ask if we needed anything else. We weren't the only ones. We saw other patrons staring toward the kitchen, chins resting in hand, looking disgusted. One table of women got up and left half-finished beers.  Like I said, this isn't the first time we've had crappy service. Once, the waitress took forever to take our drink order, waited an eternity to bring our drinks back, and--when she finally did, she saw a friend standing two tables away so rather than drop off our drinks and go chat with the pal, she practically THREW our bevvies on the table, landing in a corner of a table where neither of us could reach, then walked away. She didn't come back to take our food order, just kept on chatting. We walked out--she called after us, ""Sorry, guys."" Never again.

2011-05-20,2.0,"First I should say  that Fat Cat is in my neighborhood and we go there 3-4 times a month because of the convenience.  However there are few things that bug me about this place.   First, on nights when there is a concert at Aragon or Riviera, they have an abbreviated menu.  As a semi-regular, I am expecting the usual menu but the abbreviated menu does not contain the items I normally order.  I understand their desire to keep the kitchen running smoothly on concern nights, but A) not many people order food right before going to a concert, and B) the regular patrons get fucked on these nights.   Second, I recently ordered a Maker's and ginger ale and it cost $8.  Eight dollars!  As a reference point, a 750ml bottle of Maker's cost about $30 and it yields about 25 1oz shots.  This means that Fat Cat is charging approximately 7x the cost of the shot.  Normally margins for alcohol in the food/service industry are 30-40% but this is about a 600% markup on the cost of the supplies.  And that calculation is based on the 750ml bottle that you would find at Jewel-Osco -- you know these guys get bulk discounts at a restaurant supplier so it is probably even cheaper for them to purchase.   Next, the food is not great.  There are some novel appetizers (which you could argue are overpriced), some turkey sandwiches (quality fresh turkey), and burgers.  That's about it -- glorified bar food.  It's decent but you can find better quality and variety at T's just a few blocks away in Andersonville.   The last point I want to make is picky but important to me.  The last few times I have been there they have been out of soap in the restroom.   No soap in restaurant bathroom, are you kidding me?  And they have 2 dispensers!  You would think one of them would have some soap in it but both were empty.   I am not normally compelled to write reviews but I believe it is worth mentioning because I am tired of overpaying for a mediocre experience.",-0.5101,0.858,0.069,0.073,0.4199760010104837

2011-03-10,3.0,"I have a story similar to most reviewers: was in the neighborhood, just had dinner, wasn't ready to call it a night, wanted a drink, had one, meh, went home. It seems to me that Fat Cat is missing out on a fantastic opportunity to capitalize on post-meal drinking needs but, for some reason, it doesn't quite hit. It might be a couple of things. 1.) The service. While not bad, it wasn't remarkable. I understand the bar was crowded and our server had a pretty big territory but he couldn't have been less engaged. I was in a large group of folks with service industry backgrounds. People know how to tip and tip well. Perhaps being shown the least bit of interest and we would have taken care of the rest. Instead several people went to the bar to get drinks on their own, drink suggestions were lackluster and forced (when asked what he would recommend), drinks were spilled (it happens, I get that), and the table wasn't bussed for a while. Our server was not in the mood to wait on us. I get it. I've been there. But, you have to get it together. 2.) Drinks. The cocktails were pretty inventive-sounding and it's obvious the bar has taken some time to come up with a good beer, martini and cocktail selection. In the most part, however, my table found the previews to be better than the movie. My Gunnison Garden sounded spectacular and tasted okay. It wasn't a bad drink but for the description and ingredients (orange vodka, elderflower, cucumber, lemon), I was expecting the.most.refreshing.drink.evAr! It was okay. I enjoyed my draft seasonal much more but that doesn't really showcase much other than the bar's good taste in picking it. The bar itself is rather noisy and rambunctious. It's a sign that people enjoy themselves, and that's a good thing. For my crew, however, it was tough to have a conversation amidst all the activity. Perhaps a trip to the back room is what's needed to truly get Fat Cat. But, as a patron of the front room on a Saturday night, it was an 'okay' experience.

Sometimes I wanna get my cheap drunk on. Don't make me do it at home! - Food menu isn't that expansive or creative. - ONE TIME THE MS. PAC MAN MACHINE BROKE... but they fixed it. - Very crowded during concert nights at the nearby venues. And when it's a concert night, their food menu gets even more limited. Le sigh. Verdict: While it has an impressive beer selection, the food isn't anything special.

I do not understand the Concert Menu.  Why not just have the full menu (which is not exactly an encyclopedia to begin with) free, but push a few Concert Specials that will get people in and out? The beer I wanted (Goose Island Sophia) was out of stock, so the server suggested another Goose Island beer.  It tasted like dirty socks dipped in chocolate.  The point wasn't to have another Goose Island beer, the point was to have another amber not-hoppy thing. I ordered a Coke instead, only to be brought Pepsi.  1) NOT THE SAME.  2) Just tell me you only have Pepsi and ask if it is okay.  It is not okay, I will take water, thank you. Pork Belly Sandwich = Tasty enough, but so greasy it made me feel like I needed a shower and gave my stomach the sads later. My dining companions' burger and Southwest Chicken wrap were ok, and everyone liked the fries.

I would define it as ""refined"" pub grub. Had a burger and the flavors just didn't pop the way I thought they would. Still good, but a touch bummed out. I would like to try everything on the menu because it all sounds good. My wife had a grilled cheese that was really good as well.

It has a really interesting interior and plenty of different types of seating.  It wasn't over decorated and  overstuffed with tables that I had to negotiate between to get a seat.   My friend and I decided to grab a seat at the bar because we wanted to see the television.  We noticed a sign on the way in that said they were broadcasting Glee and thought it would be fun to have a beer and watch the season premiere.  We should have asked, but didn't and it turned out that Glee was only showing in the backroom.  Since it wasn't the reason we came, it wasn't a big deal, but it would have been nice if something on the advertistment stated that it was only showing in the backroom. Again not an issue, but would have been nice to know without having to track someone down to ask. They have an extensive beer list and I appreciate the setup that delinates between the different beer styles so I could easily find something I liked.  I noticed that carried a few ciders, but am hestitant to order American style ciders because they add so much sugar I find them too sweet.  I mostly stick with English and Irish ciders.  I asked the bartender if she had tried any of the ciders before and if they were sweet. She offered one particular cider from Oregon and said it was similar to an Irish or English cider.  I was really disappointed because it was incredibly sweet and I couldn't even get her attention again to ask for something else.  She spent a lot of her time looking at her nails with her back against the bottles.   At the same time I ordered the cider I asked about the bean burger and if it was any good.  I was told it was good and to try the burger.  There are really no words for how bad this bean burger tasted.  I didn't think it was possible to make something with such a revolting texture and bland taste, but somehow they managed to accomplish this feat.  It reminded me of refried beans that were formed into a patty and put into a skillet and briefly cooked.  This was truly a terrible sandwich.  The fries that it came with mediocre, but to Fat Cat's benefit I really prefer a different style of french fry.  I tried the spicy malt vinegar that they offered, but it was uninteresting.  I should have sent the burger back,  but was just so frustrated I was more interested in leaving than in trying to find something else to eat.  My friend ordered the grilled cheese and liked her food a lot. Some of the servers were very friendly, but our server just seemed bored and a little too cool to be waiting on tables.  I was already frustrated with the food, the bad cider and the disinterested server, but the seats we picked were  probably what ruined my evening.  The rest of the wait staff tended to congregate around this end of the bar just chatting.  I was privy to a server complaining about his neighbors who have loud sex and how much he didn't appreciate hearing them.  I found it ironic that I had to sit and listen to him complain about it, loudly.   In the end I got out with a $22 bill for a bean burger, a cider and a Stella.  A lot of money for an evening I wish I would have spent elsewhere.",0.9923,0.791,0.139,0.07,0.4838342440801457

I really enjoyed the vibe the place had. The bar was impressive, and the overall essence of uptown was plentiful. I especially liked the collage of black and white photos of the neighborhood including but not limited to Capone, Aragon, the original Greeen Mill, and the Riviera.  The staff was very nice and attentive. I came shortly before the kitchen was closing, they they were still eager to give us a food menu. Outdoor seating is a plus, and the floor to ceiling retractable door/windows make this an AWESOME place to be on a cool night.  I wish i could speak more on the food, and one day I' will be able to. The vibe of fat cat made me proud of the neighborhood I live in, so take that.",0.9908,0.778,0.214,0.008,0.6167142857142858
2010-08-25,1.0,"I went on Sunday night and it happened to be Mad Men night.  Great! Love the show, however they have a Mad Men menu with what they call ""specials"" and this along with rude service is where my disappoint lies.  First things first, if you go on this particular night expect to watch the show because it is blaring throughout the bar.  Cool.  Just stay away from the Mad Men Food and Drink menu.  I ordered a gimlet for $6 and it was in a tiny glass and pretty weak.  Not to mention that I had to wait a minimum of 10-15 min before I was even served due to the horrible rude service.   I thought I would try some food off the specials menu and ordered cucumber and dill sandwiches.  Don't be fooled by their dollar food menu!  Save your dollar people!!!  Yes, the sandwich was $1, however it was cut into two cute mini triangles that fit into the size of my palm (no exagerration here) on white bread with no cucumber!!!!!!!  I certainly wasn't expecting anything grand but this was hardly anything at all!  It looked like food for a toddler.  The server had a serious attitude problem. She worked Sunday night Aug 22 and her tables were along the north wall when you walk in to the right.  Long dark hair in a pony tail and very petite.   She rolled her eyes at us when we told her we wanted to sit outside because we preferred to talk and didn't want to bother people inside the bar.  She got pissed off when the hostess came around to our table to see how we were doing and if we needed anything (which she should have been doing) and when our server found out that she had taken our order she huffed and puffed like the big bad wolf annoyed that she had taken our order.  She probably visited our table once every 20 min.  I used to wait tables and this is a big no no.   Bottom line... Reconsider your specials menu on this night or seriously improve your food because even though economic times are tough and we all would like a dollar menu, the food has to be decent.  Who in their right mind thinks that a single piece of wonder bread with some dill spread crap is appetizing? It's highway robbery even if it s $1.  Train that girl to have a better attitude and remind her she works for tips.  Not sure if I will be going back.  Bummer!",-0.9427,0.778,0.092,0.13,0.561341823551126

She also didn't seem annoyed with us when we stayed at our table for more than three hours and was very attentive the entire time. Two meals, six drinks = almost $60+tip is not terrible in my book. My only complaint is that at a certain point, the music was turned up so loud that it was unbearable. My companion was literally six inches away from my face and I couldn't hear what he was saying.

2010-08-05,1.0,"I wanted to love this place, I really did. It is around my corner and would have been a great neighborhood bar. However, I can't even begin to put in to words just how terrible the staff and management at this establishment are, but just so you get an idea I am going to do my best. I would also like you to keep in mind that I am a 25 year old who has worked as a waitress since I was 15. Customers do not come more sympathetic then me. We take a corner table. 10-15 minutes in a waitress finally appears with the menus. There is no hi, no smile, no hello, no how are... well no ANYTHING. She drops the menus...filthy menus, I mean absolutely filthy. They aren't just filthy, but one of them has no food menu inside of it. That is fine my husband just shares with me. Lets say another 10 minutes pass and she( I don't know her name because she didn't think that was something important to tell us)comes back. ""So can I get you something to drink""...well yes you can, in fact we are also ready to order. My husband at that time decides to inform her of the fact that his menu has no menu, and she replies ""I know""  then proceeds to take myself and my friends order. Well you know? Then what in the hell did you give it to him for? He was just informing her it was missing so she could put an actual menu in it for the next customer. Either way she takes our orders then not his and disappears. She comes back drops a menu where at that point he informed her he had already looked at my menu and knew what he wanted(duh we had plenty of time to share menus).  We ordered an appetizer(the bean dip), a buffalo chicken sandwich and salad, my husband ordered the house burger. We wait.....we wait.....we wait.....we wait.....(get the point) and we wait. 40minutes later she comes back to check on us. I informed her how long we've been waiting that one of us now need to go to work soonish, to which she replied ""well had I known that I would have put a rush on it"". I'm sorry excuse me? You honestly think that waiting  40 minutes for an app and a couple of sandwiches is acceptable? She disappears, then finally we get a manager who just looks dumb founded and doesn't really think that our complaint is valid(it is...trust me it really, really is) Our waitress surfaces with our food that looks to have been under a heat lamp for 40 minutes. Appetizer with our meal, burger so under done it's mooing( was ordered med well), no dressing with the salad and tasted like well....you guess. When I point out that you are serving our appetizer with our meal the response I get is "" that is how we do things here"". Really? You do? Seriously? Then why don't you put your appetizers under entrees??!?!? I can't at this point even go in to how poorly management handled this, how poorly the waitress handled this. They were given opportunity after opportunity to rectify the situation and fell flat. It was as if they couldn't be bother, as if this is acceptable service. Never, ever, ever in my time dining out or working in restaurants have I ever experienced anything like this.  When they didn't seem bothered about the waitress being rude, the food not correct, burger under done, appetizer with meal, or the fact that we have been there for an hour and a half with barely any service. We left and no you will never get a dime out of us ever. It's a shame because I would have loved to support a local business.

2010-07-17,1.0,"It hurts to give this place one star, especially since I used to go to this place at least once a week, but after stopping in there after near a year's absence, I have no choice.  The service has become very slow. Sure, we weren't drinking, but that seems no excuse for lousy service. My wife is very pregnant so her drinking would be a horrible idea, and the beer list is not what it was so I lost interest in it.  The beer list has shrunk rather significantly in the last year or so. They used to have anywhere between 5 and 8 special beers available each month, some were seasonal and some were beers they only had for a limited time. They no longer do. The regular beer menu seems to have shrunk too. I remember being able to order certain beers there all the time that no longer are carried.  The food, however, is the biggest bummer for me. The fried Mac and Cheese, cut into triangles, was missing a few corners and looked carelessly put together. It came with two sauces, a spicy ketchup which was how I remember it and another sauce (a remoulade, I think?) which is very very bland now. It used to be one of my favorite sauces in the world.  The chicken wings had sauce poured over the top of them instead of being tossed in the sauce like they once were. You don't get the sauce flavor in the entire wing this way.  The sauce wasn't quite as good as it used to be either, but it's hard to put my finger on exactly what the difference is.  The Velveeta Burger was the biggest bummer of all. The burger seems slightly smaller. That didn't really bother me as I tend to have a smaller appetite than I once did anyway, but what did get me is that they have significantly pared down the toppings. This used to be a big burger, covered in a thick slice of melted Velveeta cheese, piled high with caramelized onions, and topped off with a healthy dose of Fat cat Sauce (sort of like A-1) all on a toasted bun. Now it is a smaller burger, with a thin slice of mostly melted Velveeta, a slight smattering of caramelized onion, and a dab of Fat Cat sauce on a bun that I'm pretty sure wasn't toasted. It used to be paired with a mountain of slightly overcooked fries. Now it comes with a small pile of slightly undercooked fries.  Bad service + significantly smaller beer list + bad food = 1 star.

We had the hummus with pita and veggies and it was really good. And to counteract the healthiness of the hummus, we also got the basket o' fries, which came with an aioli sauce for dipping.

2010-03-14,4.0,"Wow, time flies. I cut out an article on Fat Cat from Chicago magazine in September 2007 and hung onto it since then (along with all my other ""I'd like to dine/shop/visit there someday"" clippings). Flash forward to this week, when my boyfriend and I were planning to go to lunch with my folks. We wanted someplace that wasn't another boring chain, someplace with an accessible menu (the parents are picky eaters), someplace with a bit of a vibe to it...I let him loose in the file of Chicago clippings and this was the one we came up with. Good choice!  Fat Cat was casual for lunch but not just another boring bar and grill. The menu wasn't too huge, but everyone ended up with something different and we all enjoyed our meals. They also have a cocktail menu of mixed moderns (Peanut Butter Martini, anyone?) and classics; I was delighted to see the Aviation, a 1920s drink (dating back to the era when flight was still a novelty) tinted a soft sky blue with creme de violette (don't think of blue curacao or electric blue snowcones; this is a much subtler shade). The pastel color belies a kicky cocktail: this is gin, maraschino liqueur and lemon juice (sans the usual cherry, but garnished with a spiral of lemon rind). The lemon pulp could have been more thoroughly strained, but a good drink overall, and nice to see this one in its classic form.  As stated, sandwiches made everyone happy. Mom and I both went for turkey: the Thanksgiving Day for her (turkey, stuffing, cranberry, on toast, with a side of green bean casserole), the Urban Turkey for me (no, it wasn't throwing gang signs; I would call this more ""metrosexual"" turkey: freshly roasted meat, not dry as is often the case, topped with thinly sliced green apples, blue cheese and caramelized onions and served as a panini. The sandwich held together well and all the flavors blended beautifully).  Dad got the ""Straight-Up Burger"" (pretty much what it says), and my guy got the Ho-Burger, a burger with a Hawaiian twist, with BBQ sauce & pineapple on it (he said several times he was surprised at how well the pineapple went with it). With the exception of Mom's sandwich, everyone had  a side of fries, which were cooked to a brown so rich I thought they were sweet potato at first. Nice and crisp, no doubt about it.  Vanessa, our waitress, was pleasant and laid-back, bustling around with the Bloody Mary cart (it was still brunch hour) but still keeping us in her sights.  Only down side: the music was cranked just a little high for this hour of the day (since St. Pat's is coming up, it was a mix of Celtic music with '80s-'90s standards like R.E.M.) Don't get me wrong, I really love Irish music, but people with a hangover from Friday night might have been *really* flagging down that Bloody Mary cart for some hair of the dog with the sound cranked up so loud.

My boyfriend had read about everyone meeting up at Fat Cat before and after the show so we decided to check it out.  I have nothing bad to say. We walked in and were told we could sit anywhere. We had the good fortune of sitting in Chris' section. He was patient while we decided what to order and then was constantly asking if we wanted more as soon as one ran low. We also got coupons for a free shot after the show!  We decided to go back the next night before the concert again and made sure we sat in the back by the pool table (which had a jager bottle in the felt!). The boys played some pool and Teresa served us. Just as good as Chris!  When Chris got there, he remembered our order from the night before and served us whenever we needed something.  I can't say enough nice things about the bar (clean!) and the food (great!) and the wait staff (amazing!) I will recommend this bar to anyone going to a show up north and even if they aren't. It is worth the trip! ANYTIME I go to Chicago, I will be hanging out there.  Teresa did a great job serving us. Chris is an amazing server!

We never waited for a drink and never had to tell him what we wanted. Even if we changed what we were drinking he would remember that too. Unbelievably nice guy as well!

2010-02-02,3.0,"As a self-proclaimed Bloody Mary aficionado who moved to Edgewater from the uber-brunch-friendly Roscoe Village, I've been sadly disappointed with the selection I've found in the Edge-Andersonville-Uptown area. After being left unsatisfied by the old brunch standbys (like Ann Sather), we went out this past weekend with some friends to Fat Cat.  First off, I loved the retro Americana style of the place. The brunch menu was delicious, if a bit pricey, and everyone enjoyed what they ordered - from spicy chilaquiles to a healthy helping of biscuits & gravy and their signature B.A.T. (Bacon, Arugula and Tomato) sammy. But the thing that took this place from a decent three to a solid four stars -  for brunch, mind you - is the holy grail of Sunday morning hungoverness. Enter the Bloody Mary cart. For a cool $6-7 (pretty standard for BMs), you got to choose:  1. Your poison - from Stoli to Kettle One to unique distills like Bison Grass infused vodka or even top-shelf tequilas.  2. Your rimmer - from classic celery salt to the swinetastic bacon salt (I swear I could put that bacon salt on every dish I eat for the rest of my life). 3. Your garnish (for $1 more) or should I say, your Totem pole of goodies - choose from giant shrimp to beef jerky and the standard olive and pickle fare. Lots of choices, right? We're just getting started. When all the accoutrements are assembled, they roll up with the greatest show on wheels. The cart includes five different mixes (House, Clamato, Gespacho, etc.), an assortment of dashes (Worstcheshire, hot sauce, Ponzu, Olive juice, etc.) as well as a dozen or so other delectable items (wasabi, bacon bits, horseradish and more) to make your make your bloody your own. Now, I'm not going to say this was the best Bloody I've ever had - or even the best in Chicago - but the sheer joy I felt when building my temple to Sunday buzzdom was enough to make it one of my most memorable tomato juice experiences. I certainly recommend Fat Cat for brunch to anyone. I'm planning on trying it out again as a late night hang, but it'll be hard to outdo the cart of destiny.

2009-09-17,4.0,"Before checking out a show at the Aragon this weekend, we tried another restaurant recommendation from a friend who has yet to steer us wrong.   Fat Cat, on Broadway just north of Lawrence, was a perfect pre-show spot - from the eats to the setting.  And apparently lots of people seem to agree with us; when we got there at about 6, the place was hopping. Fat Cat has one of those great retro vibes - very 50s mod, starting with the cool neon sign outside.  The open dining room, with a bar placed prominently in the middle, is dotted with vintage prints and ads.  And while the menus are an afterthought for a lot of restaurants, these guys got it right - the cover of Fat Cat's narrow, rectangular menus looks like one of those worn hardcover books kids might have checked out of the library when our parents were in grade school.  They complete the whole atmosphere. While we weren't in the mood to stuff ourselves stupid we were almost seduced by the appetizer menu.  It's packed with all the bad (read: good) things your doctor would freak about like fried mac and cheese, corn doggy a trios, and reuben balls. But we were here on a mission.  Clark had decided what he was going to order about five or six days earlier (note:  this is not unusual) - the Thanksgiving Day sandwich.  This sandwich proved to be a really, really good decision. The menu describes it as a turkey sandwich, with bread stuffing and cranberry between two pieces of toast with light mayo. And that is exactly what it was (sans mayo, at Clark's request). The turkey was just a tad bit dry (the cranberry gave it the moisture it was missing), but the stuffing knocked my socks off, and anything with cranberry is amazing. The toast wasn't just toasted, but also pressed on a grill, giving it those nice little hash marks and a bit of the gristle taste it needed. Instead of fries with this dish, it came with a side of green bean casserole. This too was really excellent. When we first took a look at it, we thought that it was just green beans, French fried onions, and what looked like cream of mushroom soup, but upon further inspection Clark found that there was ""a bunch"" of cheddar cheese underneath it all. Now that was a nice surprise. And to top it off, he washed the whole thing down with a ""dead guy ale"". I, on the other hand, was dying for a good old fashioned cheeseburger (or Straight Up Burger as they call it here) and fries.  The burger was great (and served on a cool square plate).  I ordered it medium with a slab of melted cheddar and they definitely delivered -- slightly pink on the inside, but with a kind of crispiness around the edges and cheese dripping down the sides...and, oh yeah, the perfect amount of grease.  It was a good size for me - I was able to eat the burger, about 90 percent of my fries (Clark stole the rest) and didn't feel like slumping over in the booth and taking a nap afterward.  The fries were pretty standard but crisp ; while they're advertised as seasoned, I didn't detect a ton of flavor. We dropped about $33 here (plus tip) for the two meals, a beer and a Coke.  And it was worth every penny. By the way, if you're just going for drinks and diversion, Fat Cat seems to have plenty of that too. We hit this place on Final Four night and found there are several TVs for watching sports as well as a pool table or two in the back, not to mention that they were also playing the movie ""Heavy Metal"" on the TV right above us.

One of our friends met us after a really long day/night of work and wanted to eat something. I had leftovers from the restaurant and she happily started eating as she was informed the kitchen was closed. The server came by and said she wasn't allowed to eat but could eat it outside. We respected the rules but found it odd that she said it was unethical to bring outside food into a restaurant even though the kitchen closed and hence turned into just a bar. She ended up bringing the manager over who said that it was a rule we couldn't eat but one that wasn't really enforced, and apologized for the situation. However it was so awkward at this point, my friend put the food away. Everyone treated us well, however the server was extremely sensitive and I thought she was going to start tearing up, and we tried to calm her down, so I felt bad for the overall situation.

My friends ordered hummus at the bar which never arrived. We moved to a table and only after we had ordered our food from our server did the bartender come over to us and say he never put the hummus order in. Oops.  Also, I ordered a burger with cheese and a side salad. The server didn't mention any additional costs for the salad or the cheese. And I don't recall seeing the add-on prices on the menu (I looked). So it wasn't until I saw the bill that I realized they charged me a few extra bucks. Boo. I mentioned it to our server, and she was like ""um, yeah, sorry, there's an extra charge."" She should have at least offered to take one of the charges off. That's customer service 101.  That said, the Straight Up burger with Velveeta I had was delish.

Maybe it's the music, or the creative food presentations but I like what I see and hear. When you walk in the front door, hints of the 30's and 40's whirl around you. Plush booths comprise most of the seating space along with tall bar tables by the windows (which open up in the summertime). There's really good people watching in this area too which makes for good laughs. I'm one to try out the specialty cocktails a venue offers. There needs to be something unique and crazy to keep me coming back. Fat Cat exceeded my expectations with fresh and very breezy cocktails. Try the Uptown Lemonade. I don't know what the heck they put in that thing, but I was feeling pretty good after a couple. The Prohibition is their take on a rum runner, I also suggest this one. I'm always on the lookout for beer selection and they have a surprising 16 beers on draft, along with 35 in the bottle. Their wines are decent, but nothing to rave about at this time.  The menu has FUN written allover it. The appetizers make me giggle inside. Corn Doggie A Trios?? I'm in awe. It's basically their homemade devil dog, vienna and polish sausages dipped in corn batter, then deep-fried and served with spicy ketchup. Can we say AMAZING??? This is better than the carnival folks. Get some now!  On the other hand, the Reuben Balls are interesting. Maybe it's because i'm not that fond of Reubens. Cool concept though, I give them props.  They have salads too for the people who browse for healthier items. The salads are totally loaded with lots of goodies so I'm not sure how healthy they actually end up to be, but the salads going past my table looked great.

It was a Monday and they had $1 Mini buffalo chix sammys and $5 Winter warmers (a choice of about 6 warm yummy drinks from mulled cider to hot toddy).

It's one of the best chicken sandwiches I've had. The hummus plate was very well presented with lightly steamed or blanched broccoli, carrot slices, pita, bagel chips, and cucumbers. The hummus had a little too strong of a flavor to me (tasted like indian curry a little) but it was still very refreshing and I'd eat it again. I enjoyed a pint of Rouge Mocha Porter which was delicious and my sister had one of their specialty beer mixtures. I can't remember the name but it was decadent with dark cherry flavors. It was amazing. We also shared a Hi-Hat which is a muddled basil, grape, vodka, and  ginger ale and is so light and delicious, I could probably drink 20 of them.

2009-02-03,3.0,"This spot in Uptown near the lively intersection at Lawrence and Broadway is a good stand-by. Decent food and drinks, made up mostly of staples like the cheeseburger, club sandwich, wings, salads, and so on.  The atmosphere here is really easy on the eyes; not a bunch of bullshit hanging on the walls. Just dark woods, floor-to-ceiling windows that wrap around half the restaurant, and an open floor-plan built around their bar, with a variety of tables and seats...think contemporary street-side ""Cheers."" The restaurant is always kept at least moderately clean, though it would look a lot sharper if they put in a little extra elbow grease. There are television screens everywhere, which is good to keep in mind for big televised events. Mostly they play sports. Sometimes they'll have someone walking around with a quiz, asking trivia during commercials, or something in the like, which is often irritating. But I at least give them an A for effort. Some patrons really seem to enjoy it. Though the service here is far from superb, especially on a busier day, it is always very friendly. The cocktails are satisfying. They have some talented bartenders. For Sunday brunch, I recommend their Bloody Mary. Most of the food on the menu is safe, though often overpriced. I've been in for brunch a few times, and never been disappointed by anything I ate, only what I was charged. Also: Their standard brunch special (eggs, toast, hash, bacon, etc.) is served on a really awkward, antagonizing moon-shaped plate, making for an exhausting eating experience. Ask for a normal plate.  All in all, not bad a bad spot. Like I said, good stand-by. Food has a lot more potential. Drinks are great, but could be even better. Service needs to wake up.

2009-01-31,4.0,"We went to Fat Cat for the first time last week. The only thing I could remember from reading the reviews about Fat Cat, was that there is loud music played during weekend nights. I can think of a thousand things I'd rather do than sit in a restaurant/bar, scream at my friends, and miss out on conversation because my hearing sucks. Off to a quiet lunch we go! We walked in (with our canes) shortly after it opened and there was one other table. In my experience, when getting to a restaurant right after it opens for the day, the food is not as good as it could be. I'm not sure if it's because they aren't ready, they have a less experienced cook on staff, etc. HOWEVER, as of late, we have been having experiences where the food is actually better at these slow times because staff isn't rushed. In fact, we won't even order food at our neighborhood joint, Bar on Buena, if it's busy because of this. We were expecting typical bar food. I went with the Thanksgiving Day sandwich because well, I could eat Thanksgiving type food any and every day of the year. I was worried when I saw my green bean casserole. There was a layer of onions and beans sitting on a pool of gray sauce. I was having serious doubts until I tried it--holy $hit balls! Looks were deceiving and it was very tasty. The sandwich was also really good and after finishing nearly all of it I realized I should have done the ""low-carb"" thing and ate it sans bread. I had issues walking home because I ate too much. The 'band got the Buffalo Chicken sandwich and said it was one of the best he's ever had. He got it with a side of chili cheese fries, which he liked but I was not too crazy about the taste of the chili.  Staff was friendly and attentive.

2009-01-17,2.0,"I've been to Fat Cat a handful of times and in all experiences, I can summarize that it just lacks something. What that something is exactly, I'm not so sure.  But what I can say positively about Fat Cat is that it is finally a place in the area that offers a large lounge, minus a Sports Bar or American Brewpub type theme. It is atheistically beautiful inside and they offer a spacious outdoor seating area during the warmer months. I like that they have valet service. Their specialty drinks, when ordered, have been very tasty, and I like that they offer a specialty cocktail list in addition to their full service bar.  Now for the bad.... For starters, let me mention the women's bathroom. I have no idea why, but it happens to be the darkest bathroom I have ever step foot in. It is so ridiculously dark that you can barely see where it is you are going to the bathroom. Call me crazy, but sometimes, I actually like to look at myself in the mirror while I'm washing my hands. I know, this sounds so crazy, but stay with me. I sometimes like to see if maybe I happen to have something stuck in my teeth, or to, GASP, put some makeup on! But this task cannot be completed in the light of what I will guess at is a 10 watt bulb, if that sort of thing even exists. It might as well be lit by a flashlight. It's that damn dark.  I haven't been there since the Summer, so I will give Fat Cat credit that maybe someone has complained about the lighting and that it has changed, so this part is forgivable.  What is not forgivable is sitting at a cocktail table for a good ten minutes before even being acknowledged by a cocktail server. Each time, it's been the same thing, a not so busy time of night, mixed with a not so packed lounge, mixed with an absent minded server, too focused on catching up with coworkers at the bar than checking on tables. I had to physically go to the bar on one occasion to get the menu so that we could order some drinks, and I just settled on ordering them from the bar versus waiting for our server to finally introduce herself. It was a Sunday night. For the food, I would say sub-par bar food. I certainly wouldn't crave it, nor would I remember it. And, I found it a bit off that their kitchen closes so early, even on Friday and Saturday nights. They could make a ton of money keeping it open, seeing as it would be one of the only places in that particular area with late night nibbles beyond Mexican or Gyros.  So why am I so hard on Fat Cat? Maybe because I see its tremendous potential and I want it to survive and thrive and stay open for years to come. I want to love it, because even though I have had some not so stellar experiences there, that overall, I love the feel of the place and I like what it could become. That even though the homeless people have begged for change from me as I sat outside on FC's outdoor patio drinking PBR one hot Summer night, it was a moment that I would never really forget, nor could experience quite the same way in any other neck of the woods.",0.9821,0.849,0.101,0.05,0.46133056758056773

The crowd was a nice mix of people and everyone looked to be having a great time. The bar is great; it's situated right in the middle and is a huge U shape. There's a pool table in the back room (I had no idea this place was so big) and big cozy booths on the south side of the joint. My only complaint: the music was a tad bit too loud for conversation. In addition to having a cold I know have almost no voice left from having to shout to be heard. The music selection was nice though, very varied. We even did a little dancing, although that didn't seem to be the norm.  The biggest selling point of the evening was when our waitress counseled me against ordering the lychee martini. I wanted to branch out and try something new, she warned me that lychee is an acquired taste and that if I don't love ginger I wouldn't like the drink.

Cuban Pork Belly Sandwich (there is literally almost nothing better in this world than pork belly and this is in my Top Three Sandwiches I've Ever Had... the other two being my own inventions.)

The new ones they brought weren't very clean either and another member of my party refused to eat off of them all together.

No one in our party of 8 would eat them. The portions were much too small (not that we minded, since nothing was very good), and the plates, themselves, were too complex and fancy for such uninteresting fare. We ordered an array of appetizers and received more mayonnaise and dipping sauces than actual food. But that's not all! I had a terrible stomach ache from gas all night, and into the next morning, even though I ate very little. That is very rare for me to experience. If the dishes are any indication of the kitchen conditions, then I don't doubt it was Fat Cat causing my illness. Overall I thought the service was good, and the servers were pretty friendly. BUT, one of the servers was very inappropriately dressed. Not only was she falling out of her top (which was way too small and barely on her chubby frame), but she was constantly adjusting her clothing to keep it from falling off her body. She was touching her skin, clothes, and hair, then touching food and drinks! Gross! She looked too obscene to be at any job other than the strip club. I question the quality of the management at any restaurant that allows their employees to work looking the way she did. My drink ""The Big H"" was very good, though, and the beer selection is also good. BUT, they don't have every beer that is listed on their menu, and substitute one for another. Finally, I thought the prices were pretty steep for all of these problems, and food from a box. I feel like my money is going to pay for the expensive decor and customized plates to each dish. It certainly isn't going to quality ingredients for good food and/or clean conditions. Overpriced and overhyped. I will never go back.",-0.8663,0.826,0.077,0.097,0.5042378543442375

There was not a single jazz song played overhead the entire time I was there.  Now I love rap and dance music as much as the next guy but it really seemed out of place in both the neighborhood and the bar. Besides one of the bartenders having a rock-a-billy haircut (which is sort of pushing it) this bar felt like it could have been anywhere.  The menu could have had jazz themed entrees but they blew that chance. Beers are really expensive ($6.75 for a Guinness) and though I didn't order well drinks apparently those are even pricier.  Which, I guess would be acceptable if you were paying for atmosphere. Apparently they have sports bar trivia on Sunday.  There is table shuffleboard and a nice pool table that, even on a Saturday, was not packed.  And a Golden Tee machine.  Maybe they're trying to be the area around Lawrence and Broadway's overpriced sports bar and that's their theme. In general, despite the entirety of Uptown being parked to the max with a big concert at the Aragon on the Saturday I went (I ended up parking at Broadway and Berwyn after driving around for 75 minutes), this bar was empty.

We stopped in around 10 pm on a Friday, hungry and thirsty, and the inside was...clubby.  I guess I had the wrong idea when I thought this place was chill.  The music was waaaay too loud for decent conversation, so we headed out to the patio.  We were ignored by the waitress for a good 10 minutes until some guy who seemed like an owner or manager came over and gave us some menus.  When the waitress finally came to our table (yes, tattooed and cute, but not so nice), it seemed as though she had way more important people to serve than us, and took our order in a big hurry and left.  I hate it when waitstaff makes you feel that way. I started with the Gatsby cocktail, because I love Hendrick's gin.  It was a big drink, served in a pint glass, so I was pleased about that.  But it was a very weak drink, and I was not so pleased about that.  My guy had a dark beer (can't keep beer names straight).  Later the waitress came over and tried to cover for being so rude earlier by asking my guy if he liked his beer because ""nobody ever likes that beer"".  ????  Great save, tattoo chick. Since it was late, we just ordered one entree to share, the pork belly sandwich.  Now, I've had some delicious pork belly, but this wasn't it.  It really should have been called a pulled pork sandwich, because that's what it was.  It was decent, maybe a little bland.  I enjoyed the cheese fries very much -- very salty and crispy, just the way I like 'em.  My second drink was the chocolate peanut butter martini, and I have to say that saved the night.  It really is as delicious as they say.

Reasons for not getting that elusive last star - our waitress brought our entrees out five minutes after bringing out our appetizer.

When we got there we chose to sit inside as it was a little hot out, we were greeted immediately and told to sit anywhere we liked.  We chose the bar as we typically do.  The bartender was extremely nice and friendly got our drinks and took our order. I had the Velveeta burger medium w/ fries.  The burger was cooked well and I could taste a hit on A1 so maybe they mix that in while cooking.  They have a great spicy vinegar to put on your fries and it was excellent, it was not over powering like malt vinegar can be. Some other interesting points: Many different kinds of draft beer (our bartender was very knowledgeable about the options) Large room with high top tables, U shaped booths and a long bar Outside seating is on both the north and east sides of the building.  The first couple of areas have lounge chairs and a table so that you can relax and have a drink outside versus cramped around a table like many outdoor areas.  With that set up it appears they don't mind if you are ""just having drinks"" They do carry out but no delivery.

They usually seem to try too hard.  After reading the review of Fat Cat, I decided to finally give this place a try.  I'm glad i did.  My friends and I had a very pleasant, very ""I am important, you better take care of me"" type of experience.  The door guy was friendly and set the stage for the even friendlier, attentive staff.  Our waitress was a cute red head that didn't stop smiling all night, and maintained a proper balance between making sure we didn't want another round and not interrupting our conversation every four minutes to see if she could up the bill.  The music was too loud and a bit predictable.  It felt like the DJ was trying to grab the attention of the people sitting outside instead of provide back ground music for those of us sitting inside.       The red-head was very honest about the menu in response to our questions.  It's refreshing to get a waitress who will say, Yeah, Reuben's balls are yummy, but the hummus is where it's at, especially if you want to share.  She was also helpful in navigating the amazing beer selection, and offered mid-price range suggestions, instead of immediately trying to get us to order the most expensive beer on the list.  In fact, when one of my friends asked her about the Kriek, a delicious Belgian cherry flavored ale, she said it was one of her favorite beers, but continued on to suggest a seasonal draft that was actually four dollars cheaper instead of raving about how good it was. Overall, the service was great, the food was well-prepared and still hot , not warm when it  arrived at our table (best grilled-cheese ever! If heaven were made of garlic and pesto, this would be it)  and the music was questionable, but the dancing waitresses made it worth listening to.  Definitely want to go back and try the brunch menu, red said the pancakes were amazing, and the chef/manager was in love with bacon, always a plus.

From what I hear, not a rarity in the hood, (thanks for the tip Erika G), but a pleasant find for me. We settled on two beers and after ordering our second and last round looked and ordered food. Some really nice and not your typical bar foods. Thumbs up to having grilled chicken strips, for me it is happiness. Yet I did not go for that, I went with the pulled chicken buffalo chicken sandwich, with jack cheese and blue cheese crumbles. Tasty. I also asked our waitress for a side of the aoili... I think she brought me ranch, le sigh. Valerie got their Thanksgiving turkey sandwich which she said she thoroughly enjoyed. The prices aren't a steal, but they aren't a rip off either.

Problem is - they need to turn the music down!  The bartender (or whoever is making the playlist) has great taste, and they're all too happy to take advantage of the ceiling mounted Bose speakers filling their cavernous space with old Morrisey songs.  Every seat that we could find had a speaker blasting in our ears, making it difficult to even talk to one another.  Really annoying - maybe crank it down about 10db, guys?

The bartender welcomed us and invited us to sit wherever we liked, which pretty much meant the one open table in the back. They had a mimosa bar with a champagne fountain--where you could choose between orange, pomegranate, pineapple, and white cranberry as the mixers--for only $9 for an unlimited supply, which really helped NYD be a bit more bearable.  They're going for a retro-50s kitsch look, which you can see in their light fixtures and menus, but which is negatively impacted by all the flat screens shooting out football, and which no one even seemed to be watching anyway. Seriously considering  the mushroom and goat cheese frittata on the brunch menu, I felt like I needed fries so I went with the black bean veggie burger. Apparently this place is a collaboration between the guys from Five Star and Silver Cloud, and you can see the Silver Cloud influence on the menu, which includes such comfort food oddities as fried mac and cheese with bacon pepper. While my companion and I were waiting for our food we amused ourselves by observing the bartender, who seemed to clearly enjoy his job and be genuinely happy serving his clientele. At one point he even exclaimed ""this place is awesome!"" and we giggled at his unbridled sincerity. We were amazed that he could be so genuinely happy without being annoying, cloying, or other such -ing adjective. My veggie burger was actually two veggie burgers on one bun, plus avocado and cheese, along with lettuce, onion, and tomato. Puzzled as to how I could get this thing into my mouth, I discovered that the bean patties were actually somewhat pliable--sort of like falafel--and could be smooshed down to an easier to handle diameter. And wow, was it tasty--perfectly spicy, fragrant and delish. The fries that it came with were phenomenal. Somewhere between steak frites and your run-of-the mill fries, they were mega crispy with skins left on, and a pleasantly warm, mushy interior. The beer bottle case condiment container has a house blend spicy vinegar which is packed with hot peppers and a few cloves of garlic, and goes well on the fries. Despite the whole 50s thing they've got going on, for some perplexing reason they played nonstop porn groove and 70s funk the whole time we were there. They've also got a pool table in the back, and, according to the sign in the swank, low-lit ladies bathroom, offer swing dancing (partners not required).

The Braised Pork Belly Sammy has taken a lot of heat from other reviewers.  I ordered it and loved it.  It definitely does not bear any resemblance to a pork Cuban, but it didn't seem like that's what the chef was striving for.  The combination of chili vinegar, pork fat and spicy aoli did indeed leave the sandwich dripping with oil, but the effect was succulent rather than repulsive on my palate.  The hand cut french fries were top notch.

2007-10-15,1.0,"Terrible.  So I stopped at the Fat Cat with a friend last week or so; I had really been looking forward to coming here since it opened. I had read that it was a combination of the owner from Silver Cloud and the owner from 5 Star. I've never been to Silver Cloud so I wasn't too interested by their role, but I like the 5 Star a lot so I thought I would give it a go.  Decor- very nice, reminds me of 5 Star in a lot of ways. I like the wall with  open windows in the summer, the whole place has a nice laid back feel to it.  That's really all I can say about this place that is nice. The food was bad. Not mediocre, not average, bad. Normally I can over look something like that if the service is good but the service here was even worse.  The waitress came over to take our drink order. I asked her if they had any rye and if so which ones. She looked at me like I was talking another language and asked me if that was some sort of beer. Ok- she's a waitress and maybe she doesn't drink a lot, I understand that's fine. I tell her very nicely that no it's not beer it's actually a type of whiskey. At this point she does the right thing and says, I really don't know, let me ask the bartenders. So she comes back and says to me, ""yeah- we have quite a few, it's probably just easier if you walk up to the bar and look."" No problem- I like to look. So I belly up to the bar and the bartenders (plural) point behind them and say- ""there you go."" I look at the where they point and all I see is Johnny Walker, Makers, Knobb Creek, Glenlivet, Jack Daniels, etc. I says to one of the bartenders,   ""You don't have any rye's back here.""  And she looks at me and says, ""You want what?""  ""Rye, R-Y-E"" I say.  ""What is that? I've never even heard of that."" she replies.   I say, ""It's a type of whiskey, you know- scotch, bourbon, rye."" ""Oh no- we don't have anything like that here"" she replied.  Okay so here's my problem with this whole exchange.  The waitress I can understand not knowing what rye is, but the bartender? Give me a break- it's your whole job to know these sorts of things.   Thoroughly annoyed I ordered a Makers Mark and water.  When the waitress brings it to our table it's in a pint glass filled with water, ice, and a shot of Makers Mark. I downed that in about 10 minutes, when I ordered my next drink I asked for Makers neat with a water back. This confused our waitress as she needed to come back to the table twice to ask about it. When she returned the third time I had a pint glass of water (no problems there) and shot of Makers in a tumbler. Why is it so hard to just pour a freaking drink properly? At that point I was done.  Our food arrived; it was greasy and cold and was just a perfect way to cap off my first and only visit to Fat Cat.  Hire better bartenders that know what they're doing.  Train your wait staff so they look like they know what they are doing. Expand your selection of whiskey.  Make your food edible. Do all that and maybe I'll think about coming back again.

Despite using annoying, hollow-headed Rachael Ray-isms such as ""Sammy"" to describe it on their menu, I ordered the sandwich in anticipation, fondly remembering the Cubans I've feasted upon numerous times in Miami, with each one holding a vise-like grip on my heart--or aortic valve--figuratively and literally. With the bar set pretty high, I wondered how Fat Cat would serve up this culinary treasure of the Northern Caribbean. Would it be succulent, melting in my mouth with every bite? Will the sweet and spicy rub come across, and how did the Chef render it? Who, in their right mind, would serve Cuban Pork on stiff Italian bread like a Ciabatta roll?  All these questions were answered when my food arrived and I took the first bite. As I sunk my teeth into it, the synapses fired chaotically in my brain, my face recoiling in horror. I wouldn't--hell, I physically couldn't--take another bite. Never mind the fact that the seasoning was incredibly off its mark, the fat hadn't been rendered off at all, leaving the grease and viscous fat pieces to squirt into my mouth. I calmly placed the ""sammy"" on the plate, and pondered how on earth anyone could possibly let that leave the kitchen.

Not one redeeming quality about the meal, aside from the fries, which if you can't do at $8.00 a plate, you need to be canned.

The bartender that greeted us was very friendly and patient, and was happy to offer my friend a taste of a beer he wasn't familiar with. We also ate and thought the food was above average for bar food. I too had the grilled cheese with pesto and it was awesome--very garlicky. My friend had a burger with arugula, cream cheese and bacon--also quite good, if a little decadent. I loved the fries, but did prefer them without their spicy house vinegar (which made them much too soggy).

Disgusting! The glass was replaced and we placed our orders -- I got the fancy shmancy grilled cheese (with pesto on panini) and the bf got the Cuban pork sandwich, hoping that it would be absolutely as delicious as a Cuban pork is supposed to be (or so he says).  The food came and the fries were okay. The olive oil they provide to go with them in spicy and the combo is mediocre at best. My grilled cheese was honestly pretty delicious, and I highly recommend it.  The Cuban pork sandwich, however, according to the bf, was nothing but the FAT and was completely unedible. So he noshed on a few fries, a bit of my grilled cheese, and had nothing else but coke.  Now, my bf loves food. He loves to eat. He was hungry! And the sandwich was disgusting ... it shouldn't have even left the kitchen. Obviously someone needs to teach these chefs (if they are ...) how to cook a pork sandwich.  Unfortunately, we won't be giving this (what looks like a super trendy) joint another chance ... mostly because of geography, but also because that sandwich was fat-sgusting.",0.9693,0.784,0.145,0.071,0.697936507936508
2007-08-29,4.0,Came here for dinner after reading reviews on Yelp.  I totally agree with it being to loud.  It took awhile for the server to come over and take my initial drink order but then the service was pretty smooth.  And no prices on the menu VERY annoying- especially since they are in a plastic cover so its not like they are trying to save on printing with beer and price changes.  So why four stars- the food was awesome and jeez its pretty hip for uptown so I am very excited about having yummy food within walking distance.  But can someone please tell them to turn the music down- it was dinner at 7pm on a Monday not seven beers in on a Saturday.,0.9719,0.716,0.212,0.073,0.7558080808080809
2007-08-18,5.0,"5 stars because my night was crappy until I came here. I didn't think I was going to like anything.  I ordered the buffalo grilled chicken salad with ranch instead of bc and a fat tire. I LOVE dry meat- but the chicken on my salad was so moist I had to grab it with my fingers to make sure it wasn't just fat pieces. Had I ever known that meat could be moist, spicy and lean like that- my standards would have been WAY higher. I was amazed. The lettuce looked and tasted great.  My only complaint aside from how unbelievably LOUD it was in this place, is that I like black & malty beers and there were none. The beer selection is very large, but none of it was obscure in the direction I like to drink. At least they had Fat Tire and a big ice can to keep the bottle cold in.  Someone else at my table ordered the cantaloupe martini- WOW. I don't even like drinks like that, but this one was amazing.  Good mix of patrons. I noticed that the DJ was the same one that I saw the night before at Bob Inn. Weird- but he's pretty good, so they get points for having him.  Almost everything (sandwiches and salads- not entrees) were priced at $7-$10.",0.9949,0.745,0.227,0.028,0.6797438672438673
2007-08-14,4.0,"I went with a few friends on a Monday night to celebrate my birthday and being a Monday, it was not crowded at all.  We arrived at 7:30 and asked to push 2 tables together at the window which they gave me a weird look for because they had larger tables big enough for our group but I wanted to sit at the window because it was a nice night and the windows were open.  I was the first to arrive and was pretty much ignored for awhile but eventually our waiter came around and gave me some menus and took my drink order.  4 of us ordered Fat Tires which came in our own individual ice buckets.  Everyone seem to really like their food and it's pretty moderately priced.  The drinks on the other hand were more pricey than we were used to.  Our waiter, Joey, was a lot of fun and even gave me a free desert for my birthday which we all shared.  We had decided to go there prior to seeing the write-up in the Red Eye and were a little worried that it was going to be too crowded with people wanting to check it out.  But all was good and we hope to make it a regular place in the future.",0.991,0.786,0.186,0.028,0.46841025641025635
2007-08-11,4.0,"The interior design of Fat Cat is art deco and playing off the rich history of Uptown; however, it is a great place to watch a game with a nice array of plasma TVs throughout the bar.  As far as bars go in Uptown this one is nice and the crowd is usually made up of unpretentious locals - unless if there is a concert at the Riv or Aragon. Fat Cat offers a wide variety of comfort foods and has a nice selection of martinis and beers.    The service was top-notch and the staff was very friendly and accomidating.  My burger was cooked to perfection and look forward to going back soon.",0.979,0.779,0.221,0.0,0.6307692307692309
2007-08-11,3.0,"This bar has the potential to be a 5 star, but right now it sits at a solid 3.  My first complaint is no prices on the menu. I don't want to talk to the bartender for an hour to figure out what everything costs. It forces you to just order what looks good, and most likely your drink will end up being $7 . My other complaint is with ambiance, if they wanted to, they could be a speakeasy type place as the decor is classy and fit to that...however, theres a ton of TV's playing sports all over the place.which cannot be avoided. There is no closed captioning on the TVs and it is very loud inside. I didnt see the food prices but the food looked pretty gourmet, which is is a plus.I might try going back for some food and give it a second run, but the horrid misuse of ambiance and the lack of prices on the menu put me at 3 stars.",0.3962,0.772,0.118,0.109,0.48494397759103647

2007-08-06,2.0,"I really want to give Fat Cat more stars than this, but I just can't. My initial impression was positive. I liked the use of the space, the understated decor, the wraparound bar. The beer list, though a tad short, had some interesting options available. The waiter we had was attentive and friendly.  The problem came with the food. To be honest, the hot wings were okay, not amazing, but a good enough appetizer. Unfortunately, our sandwiches (both of which were recommended by our server) left much to be desired. The Thanksgiving Sandwich was unpardonably dry and desperately needed more than its meager dollop of cranberry sauce. The stuffing also seemed to be from a box, while the thin white bread was toasted to crumbly stiffness. The Cuban Pork Belly sandwich was not pressed, and rather, was served on a ciabatta roll in, I kid you not, a pool of oil (possibly vegetable or a very light olive). The pork was (broken record) dry, and I suppose that the oil pool was meant to compensate for that. That's a cruel and unusual calculus for a sandwich to be the victim of, and ultimately, it crumbled under the pressure. As much as I love my triglycerides, the oily underside just completely obliterated my ability to sense of any other flavors in the sandwich. On the plus side, the fries and the table vinegar were quite good. The side of green bean casserole was a surprise too with fresh green beans rather than canned. The sides speak to the potential here. I will definitely go back (with fingers crossed) in a few weeks to see if they have worked out some kinks. Until then I will likely go to Crew if I'm in the neighborhood and looking for good bar food.",0.7887,0.743,0.139,0.119,0.57289898989899
2007-08-03,3.0,"I live in the hood, so we went over at the spur of the moment. My wife & I were severely irritated there were smokers around us.  Why allow smoking in a new joint when it will be banned in 5 months? Just start out with out it!  My food was good, but the wife's burger, which she asked for as 'medium' came to her as well done.  Really well done.  She shoulda sent it back, but we didn't want to bother.  We mentioned it to a manager on the way out & we said we were cool, no biggie, but just to mention it.   The place is cool, we will go back, maybe when the smoking ban starts.  I dug the beer list a lot & like the openness of the place.  A good addition to Uptown. ######edit######### I added a star.  Went last sat afternoon & had the bbq sandwich.

2007-07-31,2.0,"I went to check this place out on a Saturday night with a few friends after reading about them in TimeOut who touted them as a 1940's classic cocktail bar. I thought the place was nice, yet was not expecting a bunch of plasma screens showing sports. I was expecting some cool jazz, but instead got a bit of 1980's rock n' roll. Don't get me wrong, I like those things, just not what I was expecting from a ""Classic cocktail"" bar. Check it out. You may think different. It is a much needed diversion on that stretch of Broadway.",0.8773,0.861,0.128,0.012,0.47291666666666665
2007-07-26,1.0,"Okay, against my better judgment I went back to Fat Cat a couple of weeks ago with some friends who whined and whined until I agreed to join them. Also, I wanted to give it a second chance to see if anything had changed. Well, it hadn't. Even louder head-banger music, greasy food, an undrinkable sidecar (why do they advertise for retro cocktails???) and then a martini spilled directly into my lap by the waitress. Oh yeah, one that I had purchased at the bar. And oh, yeah, the manager said they wouldn't charge me to replace it - ""we'll take it off your tab."" (Umm, I already paid for it!)  That's more than three strikes, don't waste your time.  Original review: They don't get it, I don't get it. Is this a 40s bar, a sports bar, a neighborhood hangout, or none of the above? This place was all over TimeOut and other news last week hyping their ""retro"" bar, so we decided to check it out.... but the 80s music, 40s-ish decor, and too many plasma TVs showing sports games betrayed that description. On top of that, the bartender admitted he didn't know how to make a classic Old Fashioned, and there wasn't a good selection of bourbon. Wait three months, then see if they've figured themselves out.",0.4267,0.836,0.104,0.06,0.3223958333333333

2007-07-26,4.0,"A group of us tried out Fat Cat tonight to celebrate the end of our summer league volleyball season. At first we thought we would be out of place, a bunch of sweaty, sand covered rec players with non-matching beach clothes entering an establishment that from the outside appeared to be a little more classy, both ambience and clientele, than what we expected. However we were warmly greeted by the host and waitress who grabbed chairs and quickly made us feel at home, even though a group of people sitting behind us were dressed to the hilt.  Initially we were disappointed that they had an abbreviated food menu limited to appetizers, as they had a special event planned for later that night. Nevertheless, we made the best of a limited food menu, the beer menu made up for it. Let me warn you now- the french fries, I don't know what they put in them, but they are very tasty, and very addictive. We even ate the sad, soggy looking fries that most people ignore. And we ended up ordering some more. At Fat Cat, you will eat the last of the fries. They are just that good.  Aside from the fries, the nacho chips and salsa were pretty good, I would dare say that they were better than most Mexican restaurants I've been to. The battered corn dogs with sauces were ok. If I wanted a hotdog, I could probably get a decent one fully loaded for the same price as that appetizer.  Now for the chicken wings. We ordered two orders of wings, one normal, one hot. They arrived steaming hot and smelled pretty good. Bonus points- the wings were of above average size for bar food. For those that are intolerant or afraid of spicy food, the hot wings aren't that hot. Buffalo Wild Wings Medium flavor is hotter that Fat Cat's hot. The normal wings do have an elevated zing to them that may throw off people expected a plainly flavored wing. In my opinion I enjoyed the normal wings better than the hot wings. Their beer menu is diverse. No you won't find everything under the sun, and you can forget about most mainstream light beers, but there is something for everyone. Tonight they did run out of several beers that happened to be my friend's first choices, but the waitress was quick to point out alternatives that they would like. I tasted a few of the alternatives, and the staff recommendations were dead on. From the menu I picked something at random to try, and ended up finding something new and tasty. As the night went, the clientele became split between bums like us and people with a more classly style of dress. The ambience combines the best elements of a classy sit down bar with the casual feeling of a sports bar, without the snobbery or slobbery associated with establishments that claim one of the other.  Yes, they are new, and need to iron out the kinks, but it's off to a promising start. Unfortunately I was unable to try their hamburgers tonight, but I will be back. Pros: Friendly waitstaff, good for groups, laid back environment. Cons: New establishment kinks that need to be fixed. To sum it up: Laid back with a touch of class.",0.9964,0.806,0.148,0.046,0.4940189440189441
