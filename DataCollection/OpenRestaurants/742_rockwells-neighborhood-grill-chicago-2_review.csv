2017-08-19,5.0,"This is probably my current favorite burger joint. I maybe have a burger once or twice a month so I like to go someplace I really like.  This is a comfy neighborhood place that is as laid back as it gets. Basically a big bar with about 15 or more tables. Additional outdoor seating in the summer. On Fridays you'll find them filled with young families. If you don't have a kid under 10 at your table you might feel a bit left out.  There are a zillion burger combinations including a daily special with a number of side dishes such as black beans and corn, bbq beans cole slaw and of course fries. The blackened fish taco is also really good. Oh by the way they have about 100 beer choices. This is not an exaggeration.  Just a few steps from the Rockwell brown line stop you can easily take the el over and make this your neighborhood place even if it's not your neighborhood.",0.9582,0.855,0.132,0.013,0.4086309523809523
2017-08-16,3.0,"Been coming to this bar for the last 2 years. Since we live right down the block it's very close and convenient! Always had great service and experience, until last nite.  We came in for dinner & the bar was not crowded at all with several tables to to pick from. We decided to sit up by the windows away from everybody else.  Guess what? Mother comes in with her son, and they sit right behind us. Seriously? The kid was out of control, jumping over the railing, crying, kicking my chair & hitting the window.  Our server wasn't  that good. She brought our chips  and salsa, and we ate them. She then brought out our main meals, but left the empty chips and salsa plate on the table. I should've said something but I was waiting for her to take it away on her own. She didn't. After our meals, we finished our drinks at a very full table of empty dishes. I asked for a root beer  and she brought me an IBC bottle.... didn't tell me it was in a bottle, so I wouldn't be getting a refill. She should've told me in the beginning, root beer comes  in a bottle. My wife could never find her for a refill either. She dropped off our check and left. We had issues with the credit card machine.... and our waitress was nowhere to be found. I had to get up and walk around...for help. I found the hostess who was more than willing to come help us. THANK YOU! She was sweet. I just thought we got bad service, when the place wasn't even full....Will we be back? We're not sure...........",0.8839,0.868,0.077,0.055,0.46593101343101345

2017-07-14,4.0,"Steady & reliable casual neighborhood family bar & grill. Be ready for lots of kids b/c they are family friendly & everyone w/ small kids go here! The service & food is great too. No doubt their burgers are cooked perfectly to your order but this time I mixed it up. I got the roast pork sandwich (basically pulled pork w/ no sauce), hubs got the taco salad & my daughter had their grill cheese. The waiter suggested I have the spicy sauce on the side b/c it's super spicy! So I did thank goodness b/c it WAS HOT!!!! I was able to portion out the spicy sauce to my liking. The sandwich was a bit dry, so a side of BBQ would have been perfect. My hubs enjoyed the taco salad and wished it was bigger. My daughter absolutely went nuts for her grill cheese (w/o the tomatoes). The bread was like Texas toast & the cheese combo was perfect & had a little kick to it. She was head over heals for it. The fries here are totally made from scratch & soooo good. I usually dip them in their ranch dressing, hello perfect pairing!!! The food & service is solid. But there's one tip I want to give....bring a sweater!!! The AC was on blast-you-into-the-arctic!!! It was near painful by the end of our meal & I couldn't get out of there fast enough. Yikes!!!

Solid beer selection and the burgers were good. Three star rating is due to their fryer being down, many menu items being unavailable, and my burger order being wrong. Only reason this is noteworthy is because our server repeated back to us our exact order and we confirmed so I didn't really see justification for it being wrong. Delay on getting the bill because the ""inside was so busy.""

A lot of names get thrown around when discussing the best burger in Chicago and I believe Rockwells very much deserves to be in that conversation!

Bonus they have nice outdoor seating on a relatively quiet street.  They have a bunch of different ways you can prepare your burger! My favourite combination is  the Angus beef patty (with a garlic and pepper char crust), wheat bun, pepper jack cheese, arugula, raw onions, yellow mustard, avocado, grilled jalapeños, and grilled onions!

2017-06-10,3.0,"Found this place on where else....but YELP! My partner and I both had burgers, with my partner having a build your own burger, while I indulged in the Santa Fe Burger. Prices are very reasonable, and the service is good, but not stellar. Our accompaniments with the burgers, for my partner, was a side of fries, while I had a side of Mac and Cheese. Opportunities for improvement are as follows:  Service, while it started out good, our waitress kinda disappeared half way through, failing to refill our drinks. The burgers were on point, however, the Mac and cheese was just ok at best. There was very little cheese on the noodles, and I felt like I was eating just buttered noodles basically. Not horrible by any means, but I wish there was more cheese! Overall 3 solid stars on this experience with Rockwell's. Please note, if you are paying by card, you have to process the transaction on your own at your table, which is arduous at best. We did not feel welcomed during our visit.

I stopped here for a quick beer and a snack and didn't end up getting a beer as they didn't have any on tap that I liked.  I really loved the tortilla soup. It's like regular chilli and white chicken chilli had a baby... I'll let you sort that one out for yourself.

2017-05-19,4.0,"So this place isn't too far from where we live, it's off the main streets so it's on the nice quiet side street. Inside the bar and dining area can be very loud and gets crowded for lunch brunch and dinner is.  When the weather is warm there is a nice outdoor side patio which is where I prefer to sit. They have a nice large beer selection so if that's what you're into this is a good spot to try out. For brunch they have mimosa and Bloody Mary specials. Also if you're an avid user of any sort of reward programs, they use five star.  We've been here a couple times and have often had their sandwiches and burgers. Food is decent, not great. So the 4th star is for the atmosphere in the outdoor seating. If I were giving a rating based on food alone it would be 3 stars and that's because my Burgers have often been dry or completely over sauced and the sides are usually pretty greasy. Would not recommend for a date night or dinner is the focus but definitely recommend if you're looking for a Chill Spot to sit outside on a patio with your dog and drink a couple beers.",0.8145,0.858,0.096,0.046,0.6830952380952381

2017-04-14,1.0,"Hard to express the disappointment.  My man and I went in for something to eat and a few drinks.  The beer menu was extensive and the drink menu was intriguing.  Drinks named after colors.  I decided to have Mr. Green which sounded very interesting, whiskey, green chatrues (spelling?) whipped egg whites and who knows what else.  It came, I tasted it. It really missed the mark in taste, color and presentation.  I called the very pleasant waitress over to tell her that the drink was not to my liking, very weak....disappointing and I'd like to have a glass of the same beer that my man was drinking, which was very good..  We had order burgers, and the works.  She walked away and moments later the 'manager' came over with the beer I ordered and the glass of watered down excuse for Mr Green. The 'manager' informed us that even though we didn't like the drink, we had to pay for it, because it was a good drink, made exactly to the recipe.  My mouth dropped open.  I told him but it was watery and tasted like there was no alcohol in it.  He said, too bad, you don't like it, you still pay for it.  I asked if he was the owner.  He said, he was the manager.   My man told him to cancel the food and give us the check.  We left immediately.   So the drink which what would have cost the 'house' roughly $2, the 'manager' lost what could have been a $60 tab.   My man decided that we are going to find the owner and suggest that his 'manage' needs some training in customer service, how much one table of two very grown people would spend on an evening there or the 'manager' should find another job, maybe loading truck where he wouldn't need any sense of how to treat customers.",-0.1487,0.867,0.064,0.069,0.3594222222222222

She took our order in a very timely matter and the food was out in no time!  Menu: Lots of options of burgers/sandwiches as well as other fast foods like tacos and chicken tenders. There is a good array of appetizers and salads as well. Food: We did a make your own burger ($10 for the basic beef patty/chicken/garden burger with basic toppings like pickles, tomato, lettuce or spinach and onions + $1 each for other add-ons) and chicken tenders ($10 I think). The food itself was mediocre. The burger party wasn't super flavorful and the fry on the tenders wasn't as crispy as I would have liked. I think it's because the batter was really thin. The fries were not super crunchy but fries are always good! They also have a couple $3 beers which is nice! I am giving this a 4 star rating because the staff was friendly, the food came out quick, and the portion size was very large, and it was fairly cheap.

We had chips and salsa plus cheese fries for our apps and both were amazing. House made tortilla chips with a nice salsa that had great seasoning but wasn't too spicy. House made fries with cheddar and bacon - can't do better then that. I had a burger with chihuahua cheese, bacon, and fries. My daughter got house made chicken strips.

The burger menu deserves your attention as well. The Tatanka burger (anyone get the reference?) is excellent. Recommended for bleu cheese fans! And speaking about flavorful, the taco salad, or anything with their house made chorizo is delish! Now for the excellent beer menu.

My husband and I have been patrons for years but we've recently noticed a real difference in service. Rockwells has always been family oriented-which is cool-but lately it's become hectic in here with all the youngsters running around and I feel like the staff is at their wits end. Think a Chuck E Cheeze level of stress in what should be a cute neighborhood cafe. Today we went in to grab lunch and wanted to sit outside. There weren't tables (no biggie) so we said we'd wait at the bar with a beer til a table opened. They said 5 mins. 20 mins later we are still there when a huge family half way into their meal gets moved to outside. WTF. We flag some staff-and it quickly becomes apparent that they forgot the lowly non-child-bearing couple at the bar. Also fine (sh*t happens). What's not cool is not taking ownership of the situation. Just apologize and maybe offer to comp our beers. But when everything's a zoo where's the time for that? It took 10 more minutes to get a bill.

But when the servers are dodging little kids riding scooters inside the restaurant or you can't use a table until it's cleaned up after what looks like a food fight, it just isn't fun for anyone there. Well I guess it's fun for the kid on the scooter. Is this a complaint about the strange sense of privilege the people with kids tend to have? Or a complaint about the management letting it get to that point? A little of both I suppose. I wish I didn't have to put up with it regardless. To be fair, it has never prevented us from going.

Cheeseburger for the kid--that's easy.  My husband and I split an order of nachos and the Burger of the week (or month I can't remember) with a side of Texas Haystack Onions.  Everything was delicious.  The nachos--made with homemade tortilla chips, topped with black beans, jalapeno, tomato and we chose ground beef.  It's none of that bar pump cheese either, it's a home made white cheddar blend and it was really good.  Our burger was a beef patty, cheese, bacon and a potato pancake--and it freakin' worked.  Grilled to a perfect medium, it was definitely an a creative and delicious burger.

2015-04-28,4.0,For the price a great bargain~ the price difference between going to McDonalds and Rockwells is not great considering what Rockwell gives you. It is not just a burger joint or a neighborhood tavern with food. The Blacken tilapia sandwich is usually pretty good and you can never miss with the burgers. The taco soup and the hot hot hot jalapeno soup are great smalls. For four or five bucks they give you a pretty nice bowl but I have often had to sent it back to warm it. Although I dont drink I know the bar seems well stocked with beers. It has veered toward a more  southwestern cuisine with their menu change and a bit too many cheesy dishes for my taste. Yet Rockwells can always be counted on in a world of fast food joints and carry out.  Bruch is great but a bit pricey going as high as 13$ for bacon and eggs and coffee. The atmosphere is a lot more sober than a sports bar as it where parents go to get away from their kids. The two TVs usually have sports and it is common to strike up a conversation with the strangers sitting next to you. I am a very hard grader living on retiree money and Rockwells may not compete with Randolph street but I dont like to be doted on even by friend~restranturs.

2014-06-18,4.0,"I love Rockwell's. I live slightly less than a mile away, so it's become my go-to restaurant to take out-of-town family and friends when they visit. It's a cozy neighborhood place with friendly, attentive service and what I believe is the best burger in Chicago. (Trust me, I've been to Kuma's, Bad Apple, etc., and nothing beats a Rockwell's burger for me.) They also have a great beer list, which my beer-drinking friends have appreciated. My only disappointment coming here is that the fries can be hit or miss. I've been here and had great fries, and other times the fries have been greasy and soggy. For a while I would get chips and salsa as a side with my burger because I didn't want to take the chance of getting gross fries. On my most recent visit, the fries were amazing, but that could be because we showed up for lunch really early and the fries were fried in fresh oil.

2014-06-08,5.0,"We took the kids to Rockwell's last Saturday from a recommendation from one of my clients and loved it. We did not have to wait for a table and actually got an 8-top for the 4 of us, awesome when you have two little mess makers like we do. The service was great, server checked on us several times throughout our meal. There were coloring books, crayons, and lollipops for the kids. Server was patient and offered suggestions when my wife was trying to make up her mind on a drink. My Margarita was tasty and mixed properly. Great food, kids had quessadilas and corn dogs and they liked em. My wife had the Santa Fe burger as it was listed as a favorite here on Yelp, and it was delicious, I snuck a few bites. I had the steak fajitas and it was huge. If my parents were with us they would have split that and still not finished, but I finished every bite it was that good. Cool thing is that with fajitas you always run out of meat and tortillas but at Rockwell's they give you plenty of veggies and corn tortillas chips on the side to either dip or do what I did and crush them into the veggies/sour cream/lettuce/salsa and have yourself a nice taco salad. A few too many grilled onions for me but they're on the side so no big deal and that's a good thing for some people anyway. Our server was great, didn't catch his name but big dude with tats and a beard, very nice fellow. Iron Maiden concert on the tv's and old Michael Jackson music playing at a comfortable level, classic! At the end of our meal a nice gal with a terrific smile came by and showed me how to use their new system where you slide your credit card at the table so you never have to worry about your identity being stolen which, she explained, would never happen at Rockwell's anyway, which was very believable. They have a really great beer selection including some Three Floyd's and other upscale craft beers I'll try next time if it's not too hot out.

2014-05-27,5.0,"I went with my sister I ordered their BBQ Bacon Burger- a plate of French fries covered in cheddar cheese, green onions & bacon pieces called the cheddar fries, my drink was limeade and kiwi which was out of this world. My sister had the skirt steak sandwich which was very chewy. It wasn't cut on the grade and she took it out of the bread and cut it into to smaller bite size pieces. She also had a salad and a root beer cause the ginger ale was flat. That night was almost pleasant but seeing a couple with 3 small children the 1 older child was quiet, the other 2 were a bit noisy. I thought is this is a bar? Why are there children in a bar?  I didn't know there were any children until they were allowed to get a dum dum aka lollypop there was a big basket full of them until I heard the small boy screaming and running towards the basket. Good thing that he still had on his bike helmet. I wouldn't want him to hurt himself by falling down.  I loved the limeade with kiwi and the burgers were big, buttery and the bacon was so big and crispy. I would do this again. But for lunch only do the plate of fries & a salad there were so many French fries on that plate. If you look up you will see the magnetic bottle caps on the furnace duct. Depends on where you are seated. I also loved the sitting in the window, until we moved to another smaller table. A large group wanted our table in the window, not sure what that was about.

2014-05-15,3.0,"I give this place 3.5 stars, but hear me out why I would round down. This place is a great neighborhood bar & grill in the cutest little nook in Ravenswood, but when I came here last weekend, the series of events led me to be ""hangry"" (I.e. angry because you're so hungry... which leads to a trail of unreasonable things irking you) so let's avoid that feeling (and that term) altogether in the future. But more back-drop later.  Rockwell's Neighborhood Grill is dog-friendly, which is fantastic (!) and was the reason I chose it in the first place.  I'm not from the neighborhood, so it was kind of a trip to head out to Ravenswood but I thought I'd give it a shot. It's also very kid-friendly (you'll see lots of young families) and there is a wide age range and demographic who dine here.  I was able to try a generous portion of their Penrose P2 pale ale before I ordered it on tap and their burgers are the highlight of their menu (I got the Sante Fe). STANDARD BURGERS, LONG WAIT FOR PATIO Burger, fries, a great beer selection and an outdoor patio sounds like the perfect combo. And it could have been, had we not had to wait so long.  I came to Rockwell's with a group of five, hoping to snag some outdoor seating and enjoy good food and company while my dog hangs out at our feet. NO RESERVATIONS: I called earlier Saturday morning and asked if they took reservations.  The lady on the phone said that they don't, but took my name down anyway, and said they will look out for our party at 7pm.  So I made a pseudo-reservation.  Or, at least, I gave them a genuine heads-up that our party will be coming.  If not, no big, the wait shouldn't be that bad right? When I checked in at 6:50pm with the host and gave my name, there was no recollection/indication of my call... so my name wasn't passed down.  I am able to deal with that.  But 50 minutes later, still standing on the sidewalk, with a growing escalation of ""hangry-ness"" and a pooch walking in circles around our feet, I couldn't wait any longer. I went inside and asked the availability of an indoor table for five, to which the host said, ""Oh of course, this table opened up 30 minutes ago.""  Well, yes, perhaps you could have offered that to us?  The host did no wrong... but I was hangry beyond reason and logic.  I told the rest of my friends that we could finally be seated, and walked back to my car to keep my dog there for the rest of dinner. LESSON LEARNED: Next time I should leave the dog at home.  Got it.  But really now, if you're not from the neighborhood, this probably wouldn't be the best place to go out of your way to ""seek out"" their standard fare.  If I lived in Ravenswood, I could see myself come here more often because their burgers are decent, their beer list extensive and it's a great community establishment (events, fundraisers, dogs).  If you come here during peak hours expecting patio seating on a gorgeous Saturday evening, eat a small dinner before you come.  Or only come for drinks.  The rounding down 0.5 stars was prompted by... (the long wait and) wishing my dog was a little human or something. Granted, the host did try to give a warning that he didn't know when guests would leave, but to come here at peak hours when it's warm out... eek.  And congrats if you made it to the end.",0.998,0.81,0.157,0.033,0.4641284538506761

Their veggie burger is so huge and fantastic that I forgive it for containing a bit of cheese--I recommend subbing it in for the beef in the Santa Fe burger. Great dog-friendly patio on quiet, tree-lined Eastwood. Solid cocktails, including margaritas (on special Wednesdays!) with fresh-squeezed lime juice. An amazing rotating craft beer selection, about which the servers are knowledgeable.

Burgers are big, always cooked the way you want them, and nice & juicy.  Overall, I think their burgers rank up there at the top of what you can get in the city.  You can also get any burger as chicken sandwich or gardenburger at no additional cost.

My hubby said that he was ready, but I might need more time since I wanted breakfast food and had to get something else.

A great neighborhood grill that has really cleaned up and reformulated it's food and drink in the past couple of years.  I'd put their Santa Fe Burger up there as one of my favorites in the city o' Chicago.  As well, their fish tacos are damn solid.   As for their beer menu?  Extraordinary.  Their tap list is smoking, often offering 10 unique, yet appropriate offerings.  Their bottle menu is well thought out and expansive.   The staff has always been more than friendly and accommodating and i've always gotten good service.  I respect that they have a inviting and family-oriented atmosphere...people with kids like to go out to eat, too...shit, I know that and I don't even have any rugrats.  If you're really pedophobic, simply come after 7pm and all of the strollers will be snugly tucked behind their respective condos.",0.9718,0.744,0.157,0.098,0.500297619047619

Sit down by the window, order one of their custom burgers, which given their highlighted spot on the menu I figured would come out correct, unlike special orders elsewhere. I asked for veg instead of fries, only to have fries on my plate when I got my order. Okay, fine, I still work in the industry, probably the chillest guest he'd have all day. But the quip about how I ""probably wanted the fries anyways"" with a shit eating grin? Yeah, no thanks pal.

2011-08-08,2.0,"A few years ago, Rockwell's was a regular place for us - until that one fateful evening where we were so utterly ripped off ($7 for an appetizer, which was a handful of stale, store-bought chips and a small container of greasy queso cheese = outrageous) that we refused to ever return. Up to that point, we considered the food to be pretty great, regardless of how costly it was to eat there.  So tonight, after a long hiatus, we decided to try again - it was raining, we were craving burgers, and Rockwell's IS just down the street.  What a big mistake. Prices are the same, but the one thing they had going for them - food quality - has sunk like a stone. We ordered the Monday appetizer special - 6 buffalo wings for $5. They were good, but TINY, a totally stingy serving. Celery and carrots scattered carelessly on a plate with a tub of ranch dressing (Horror! What, no blue cheese dipping sauce?!) The Husband then had a Santa Fe burger, with his old-favourite side, the black bean/corn salad - what used to be prepared from fresh and flavourful ingredients is now a ghastly medley of watery, Aldi-bought slop that is so completely devoid of flavour, texture, and colour, that it would only appeal to a half-starved dumpster rat. It's even more disappointing because it's summertime - fresh corn is 5 for $1 at Harvestime and everywhere else, tomatoes are plentiful and delicious...and this was just seriously lazy. The Husband then proceeded to do a rare thing - cover his burger (and black bean/corn salad) in salt - as it was so utterly bland that it required emergency saltery. The tortilla chips on the burger were stale. My burger was good - the BBQ bacon whatsimy. But when I go to a place like Rockwell's, it's all about the fries. Which were soggy, and also completely bland. How could they be so flavourless?! Covering them in salt improved them slightly. It was really quite depressing. Our server from the first half of the meal was lovely, as was the server from the second half (we were not there that long). But the place was less than half full, and as nice as the staff were, service was less than attentive. We waited 20 minutes to pay our bill, then left a wee bit angry. We were willing to give them another chance - and we're honestly not that difficult to please - but they lost their opportunity to impress. BLAND food, BLAND.

You take that chance every time you go there.  What is not fine, is when a kid is making the most high pitched, annoying scream imaginable, and her mother is mocking her encouraging to repeat the action.  Pretty classless on her part.  I wanted to go up to her and scream in her ear! With the new menu comes new prices.  Eleven bucks for a salad is pretty steep! Steer clear of the breakfast burrito.  Pretty bland and generally awful.",0.8436,0.75,0.148,0.102,0.557094330400782

I introduced this place to my wife a year ago.  Each time we go, she has to check the sign outside for the day's meat special.  Big fan of the flat iron steak, she.  If not that, then it's a battle between the nachos and the fish tacos.  I've seen the eyes dart back and forth on the menu for minutes on end.  Tacos.  No, nachos.  No, steak.  Wait. Okay. Nachos. Tyler is one of our fave servers, but I'm not knocking any of the other floor peeps (I can't recal their names).  But if the tables are full, which they can be between 5:30 and 7:30 nearly every night, we sit at the bar and hang with Jim.  He's great to sit and gab with in between him taking care of the orders for the house. I am a fan of the French Dip...and the Burger...and the Southwest Chicken sandwich.  I think you get the idea.

I would stop in at Rockwell's after work for nachos and a beverage on a weekly basis, if they had decent specials.  Unfortunately, they don't.  That's why I've only gone here a couple times, even though I live right around the corner.  Maybe they're going for a pricier, more family-oriented atmosphere, and don't want a happy hour crowd.

I have worked in customer service since I was 16, and there is nothing worse than parents who drag kids into places where kids don't belong, or bring ill-bred monsters who don't know how to behave in public, make some noise, make a mess, ruin everyone's good time and leave blissfully ignorant of the havoc they wreak. In my latest career venture (""fast casual""), it has become apparent to me that once you have kids, you forget how trash cans work.  It's bizarre and inexplicable. That being said, Rockwell's is amazing.  I don't generally like to go out to places that actually cater to kids, because once you do that you invite all the horrible, horrible parents.  But there is something about this place, and magic happens there.  I have eaten there a half-dozen times since the beginning of the summer (maybe even 7 or 8, lost track) and I have never been in the company of anyone but the most well-behaved little angels and their totally kickass parents. I've eaten inside once, but outside on the patio is where it's at.  Under a little tree-cover on a mostly residential street, it is the most beautiful place on a beautiful day, where dogs nap, children frolick, and you dine on the world's most excellent cheese fries. And also, there's booze. Service is very friendly, drinks are cold, and the food is amazing.  The menu is just large enough and incredibly well-priced.  The cheese fries (with cheddar, bacon, scallions, jalapenos and ranch dressing) are the best way ever invented to give yourself a heart attack.  The chicken nachos are drool-worthy, as are the ""texas toothpicks"" (fried onions an jalapenos), the burritos, chicken sandwiches, fresh yummy salads, and the chicken flautas which are crisp and light.

The crux of the matter is this.  This place is almost too ""neighborhood"".  The food is good.  Love the burgers.  I actually enjoy the attempt at Mexican ""inspiration"" in the dishes and the black bean and corn side is fantastic.  The place is well-lit depending on the time of day (bright for lunch and a little darker for the evening). The bar options aren't the most expansive but I know what I like and don't come here to experiment.  There are always nice people in this place, whether it be the servers/bartenders or customers and it is very kid friendly.  AND the prices aren't bad at all. There is little not to like... Except that there is nothing that makes me LOVE this place.  I LIKE it's proximity to my home.  I LIKE that my girlfriend and I could wake up and stroll over and think nothing of it while enjoying a quality meal and no sexual tension. I LIKE the patio seating though the obstacle-course-like cache of strollers in the summer make me want to punch kittens.  I LIKE that it's not a sleezy/flashy spot trying to be something it's not.  It is a solid 4 star place... But I hardly ever choose to go here because nothing stands out about it.  People are cordial but not too personal so I would choose another spot if I want to feel like a regular.  If I want to get drunk I will choose some place that closes later with no babies around (buzzkill!)  If I wanted stellar food I would choose a place a little more... stellar.  If I wanted to party I would choose some place bigger and more club-like.

The place is casual and very neighborhood-cute.  The tasteful exterior and vintage photographs that cover the walls inside make it a good fit with the aesthetic of Ravenswood Manor, and the experience of dining there is pleasant and comfortable.  I also give Rockwell's props for serving dinner relatively late for this area -- 11 pm on weekends.   The service is friendly, totally unpretentious, and the food comes out fast. Now for the food.  We ordered cheese-fries as the appetizer.  The fries were completely buried under a mountain of hard, congealed cheddar.  When I dug them out (by flipping the cheddar mountain over), they were totally soaked through with grease, to the point of being soft, limp, and translucent.  Rockwell's brags about their cheese fries being made with real cheddar rather than an artificial cheese product, and I applaud the sentiment; but in this case, a little Cheez Whiz would have been better.  My entree was a fish sandwich with a side of pasta salad.  The fish fillet was really bland and needed salt and/or lemon.  (No lemon was served with it, though the waiter promptly brought some when I asked.)  The pasta salad smelled and tasted sewery -- I could not eat it at all.  The sandwich bun was the only well-prepared thing on my plate. Maybe I made bad menu choices, or maybe it was an off night.  I'll give Rockwell's another chance if I'm looking for a late dinner spot again, but if you're eating before 10, there are much better food choices in Lincoln Square.",0.9853,0.853,0.125,0.022,0.633

Ben especially noted how much he enjoyed the grilled veggies on the salad. After inhaling my salad, I noticed that Peg had cleaned her plate. Peg is the ultimate grazer, so for her to clean her plate like that is pretty remarkable. She said that not only was the cheeseburger really tasty and cooked as she requested, but the side salad was really good, too. We all had coffee; I had decaf, but Ben and Peg had the real stuff, because they were about to drive to Indianapolis. They both remarked on how tasty the coffee was - it's Intelligentsia. Our waitress, Holly, kept our cups full, made sure I got decaf and they got regular, and kept replacing the creamers, because Peg was putting so much in her coffee.

2009-06-09,3.0,"Sadly enough, I must say that my overall experience was mediocre---3 stars for ya Rockwell's.  I was really hoping for better since I love the location being so close to the adorable ground-level Rockwell El stop.  Rockwell's is one of maybe 3 restaurants in the radius of 3 blocks or so.  This is probably why it has tons of advertisements from the surrounding Manor and is swamped with families and children screaming from every corner of the room, ay!  Thank goodness Yelp reviewing doesn't require good listening skills. I guess Rockwell's could be considered a ""gastropub"" but the food wasn't all that stellar.  I tried the Louisiana Eggrolls as all the Yelpers recommended.  They were homemade egg rolls (just like a Chinese joint but Tex-Mex style) stuffed with a mix of andouille sausage, jack cheddar cheese, chicken chunks, onions and maybe two other ingredients.  With the accompanying chipotle ranch dressing I will admit they were fairly yummy.  For those sensitive palates, it is a tad spicy but definitely do-able. I will give RWs a thumbs up for offering a Wheat/Hopps-free beer but too bad practically 75% of the menu includes wheat products (lots-o-'wiches).  I had the Chicken Breast Sandwich and my partner had the French Dip.  Both were just average and if it weren't for the homemade french fries, I could have gotten the same thing at Portillos for cheaper.  They do give you a choice of sides like a good sized side salad (get the dijon vinnagrette), homemade pasta salad, and a black bean & corn salad. A note to the owners, the decor is primarily old framed images that have no thematic connection and cover the entire wall.  Please add a little more something...please.",0.9409,0.818,0.118,0.065,0.45462962962962966

Here's a plastic container w/o any utensils so you may get food remnants all over your lap.  Fish sandwich is somewhat respectable - homemade tartar sauce forgettable. Veggie burger was tasteless.   Where are the owners? Managers? Are they laundering money in the back and the restaurant is just a front?  I would give less than a star if I could.,0.6425,0.91,0.069,0.021,0.45952380952380956

2009-02-23,4.0,"I went to Rockwells for the first time this past weekend.  There is an genuine neighborhood feel to this old style Chicago eatery.  Like just about every apartment in Chicago, Rockwell's is long and narrow. Tall ceilings, and an old wooden bar. It's not exactly in the middle of Lincolnsquare and parking wasn't an issue for us but we were there at 7pm on a Saturday and parked right in front when someone left. So I'm not sure how easy or hard it is to find parking. The menu had a lot to offer. A lot more than I expected from what looked to be a small tavern on the outside. I ordered a cup of Tomato and Onion bisque soup and Rockwell burger. My Girlfriend ordered a BBQ chicken sandwich and a cup of torila soup. The soups we're exceptionally well done. Especially the tortilla soup. It tasted like a blend of chili and soup that wasn't too chunky but not too thin. It was topped with strips of baked tortilla, a pinch of cheese, and a 1/4 slice of avocado.  Very good! The Tomato and Onion onion bisque was much more simplistic and essentially it was a tomato soup with some flair. It was topped with melted cheese. I liked it.  The burger was good. Very good. They tend to cook them on the rawer side. I ordered mine Medium-well and the middle was more pink than I would expect. I was happy as the server told me to expect that when I ordered.  This is important when you order. I imagine rare would be very rare.  The Rockwell burger comes with a medley of extras including grilled onions, lettuce, tomato, mustard, and pickle. I added ketchup because I'm an American and that's what I do. I also opted for fries which were of the diced potato variety and quite good. There were many sides to choose from. My GF ordered her BBQ chicken sandwich with a balsamic noodle side that was fresh and a good mix of dressing and vegetables. Not too soggy and not too raw. The Sandwich itself was very basic. Tender and with an ample amount of sauce. The sauce was average. might have been sweet baby Rays. It was a darker kind but not entirely molasses.  Beer prices were OK... $3.00 for Miller and Bud light. I Opted for a Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald for $4.00. Complimented the burger well.

Rockwell's dcor is a nice mix of Chicago and local family pictures, giving the place a warm personalized feel. The staff is friendly and helpful, always knowledgeable about the specials. There are some specialty items like the Cheese fries that will really know your socks off. And the selection of drinks is more than adequate. Additionally, there are some secrets to ordering that only locals know about,....sorry guys I can't give away everything. Pros: Ample Choices, Awesome quality/quantity Cons: No Lunch hours during the week, Parking sometime difficult to find. Overall Rating: 4.25 of 5 Recommendation: Highly Recommended",0.9562,0.766,0.182,0.052,0.5415686274509803
