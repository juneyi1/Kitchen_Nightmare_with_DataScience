Parking is not available so be prepared to pay the meter. I've only had the 1/4 chicken special from here and it's always cooked to perfection. The rotisserie chicken is full of flavor and so juicy, it will keep you coming back. The dish is complimented by white rice & beans and a side salad. The side salad is like nothing I've ever had before. It's a mixture of shredded lettuce, cabbage, and white onion. It tastes well when mixing with the  rice and beans. I usually get the Postobon, a manzana (apple) flavored soda. It has a unique taste that makes the entire meal completely satisfying.  This Colombian cuisine offers a wide range of authentic dishes.

2017-01-19,2.0,I have been to Brasa Roja before and liked it. I just ordered it from Postmates... the food delivered was NOT anything I remembered when I dined there. The chicken was flavorful but too dry and too much garlic (even though yes I ordered the garlic chicken). I ordered a side of sweet plantains. FYI in order for plantains to taste sweet they must be ripe. They clearly didn't use a ripe enough plantain. The rice was decent what I expected. The empanadas were ok as well... mine was delivered cold but I don't blame that on the restaurant. Not very satisfied :(,0.9764,0.709,0.255,0.036,0.667948717948718

I usually stop at BR and eat it at Templestowe Pub when it didn't offer food, but now they do but don't mind you bringing it in. Service: I wouldn't call this place the most friendly of all places but have good decent people who will help you and serve you. I got my order and was satisfied and very well wrapped up to go, while my buddy wanted tacos but one of the gents here suggested to another place for tacos. Good peoples here. Misc: These folks moved across the street from the Montrose Avenue south side of the block to the Northside almost directly across the street.

2017-01-03,5.0,"Looking for a place open late on a rainy Monday night, Brasa Roja was bright and welcoming.  Inside there was a carryout counter with the rotisserie set up behind it. Further back was a large dining area with many tables, some large and small. The walls and ceiling were bright and colorful with intricate murals. There were a few occupied tables, and the waiter in the back motioned us to a table towards the back. There were some large family groups dining in, so they can easily accommodate a larger group.  The food was very good, humble and traditional, hearty fare. You won't leave hungry.  We had the churrasco, chicken soup, Colombian tamale (huge), and empanadas. All were delicious and homemade. The tamale was one of the largest i've had, it was the size of a brick. Unique and delicious flavor, with plenty of pork. Bone and skin included, fyi. The soup also had some interesting cuts, like neck, liver, and hearts. The steak was huge also, and served on a sizzling metal platter.  Service was quick and very friendly, he made some suggestions which we appreciated.

2016-08-23,4.0,"After an amazing trip to Colombia, I was in the mood for some Colombian cuisine. I immediately went to Yelp to see what Helpers recommended aside from the normal ""Las Tablas"". A quick browse showed Brasa Roja as the top spot! After reading the reviews, and looking at the numerous pictures I figured this would be the perfect place to visit.  Upon walking in I immediately took in all of the delicious smells and did a quick scan of the restaurant. The restaurant was crowded, and cumbia could be heard playing over the speakers. Right as you enter, there's a giant grill with pollo asado (grilled chicken) constantly going. I was so distracted by the chicken that I pretty much forgot why I was there. As I stood there, a waiter came by and asked whether I wanted to eat there or take the food to go. After saying I wanted to stay, he pointed to a table and told me that I could seat myself. Once seated the waiter brought over the menu (there are 2. The red menu is in Spanish, and the black menu is in English). I came in with the intention of ordering everything that sounded remotely tasty, and I just about did it haha The food: I started off with 2 empanadas(meat filled pastries) and an Arepa con queso (like a corn pancake filled with cheese). To drink I had a Jugo de Maracuya(Passion fruit smoothie). When you order this drink, you have the choice of having them make it with water or milk. For the main course I ordered the Bandeja Paisa (traditional dish from Medellin, Colombia.. Pictures to come later).  Within 5 minutes, the appetizers were out, and they looked amazing. The empanadas were filled with just enough meat and potato, and the arepa was just the right temperature, and the cheese wasn't overwhelming. The passion fruit smoothie added just the right touch! Not too long after, the main dish arrived, and man was I surprised. The bandeja paisa is my ""go-to"" dish when I order Colombian food, but this one looked like it had taken a year's supply of steroids. There was so much food I literally had no idea where to start. As I sat there literally like a deer in headlights, I figured I would make life easier and just eat everything at the same time. My taste buds literally went crazy!! Every single thing was delicious! From the rice, to the steak, to the pork. I'm usually the kind of person to finish everything on their plate, but this time I couldn't even get through half of it and that says a lot!!  The service: As I mentioned before, the place was packed and people we're constantly coming in. The staff did a good job of getting folks seated and taking orders. After that, it pretty much seemed like folks were on their own haha. I observed a few other tables and noticed that they had to keep reminding their servers to bring things (napkins, drinks, etc). Even at my table, the waiter never came back to check on us or to refill the water. In the beginning I understood since it was pretty busy, but it seemed to be a trend throughout the whole place.  Overall Brass Roja gets good recommendations from me! The food is good and plentiful, and you don't have to wait forever for it to come. (I actually ordered more food to go haha). I can't really complain about the service although it could be a little better, but since the food was good I'll just ignore it haha.",0.9963,0.853,0.126,0.021,0.5137085137085137

Yummy chicken at an incredibly low price is so hard to find nowadays...enter La Brasa...my kids get their mango licuados from this place (although we ask with little sugar otherwise its a tad on the sweet side and then they wont sleep)  So..I know this place is not fancy by any means but personally as long as its clean and the service is good, I could care less if the menus are old..the ceiling needs work etc..sometimes you pay more because of the location or the chef that went to Le Cordon Bleu..here its a no frills good old family owned restaurant.  Their empanadas are very good and I especially cant resist their stew (sancocho) made only on Sundays. Minus one star because sometimes their chicken is a bit on the salty side... But I can always count on La Brasa to feed my family and I at an affordable price which again Im finding it harder to do in Chi-town.",0.9635,0.822,0.136,0.042,0.546574074074074

Since most things are charcoal grilled..the taste is amazing, not to mention you receive oodles of food for your $$ For those that mentioned the meat being dry..it's not! You combine the ""chimichurri"" sauce with the juicy chicken or steak and it's divine  Service is great and instead of this place looking high end, the money is clearly invested in the food. Although, I can really appreciate the hand painted walls which takes you away to the scenery in Colombia  My recommendation for first timers that have never experienced Colombian food, you're in for a treat: try the Empanadas for your appetizer (1-2 per person, depending on hunger), Matrimonio or the Bandeja Paisa for your entree, and the Colombiana soda to drink. The rotisserie chicken is also excellent! even to go, it's awesome to slam at home like a King or Queen",0.9891,0.767,0.218,0.015,0.7076190476190476

For $6 (the price recently went up. It used to be $5), you get a thin rib eye steak or a 1/4 chicken, the most amazing tasty rice, beans, and an nondescript salad.  Most of the time, I have gotten carryout, but when my husband's family is in town, we eat in. Yes, the place needs a bit of TLC, but the food is extremely tasty. They do seem to have issues pacing meals and getting all of the food out at once. For example, they served everyone who was having steak, but not the chicken entrees until a few minutes later. Also, it took them longer to serve my plantain with guava and cheese.  It is also popular with people of Columbian descent. We noticed many families there who were ordering dishes of their homeland.

2015-12-06,3.0,"I got a recommendation from a Colombian girl, to try this restaurant for their national cuisine. 6.15 p.m. Saturday. I come in, have myself seated and wait to be served. The first impression was very good, staff is VERY friendly. Cozy atmosphere, cheerful Latin music is playing, people keep coming in, some for take out, some to dine in. It's not too loud. I'm looking at that awesome Rotisserie grill and can't wait to get my teeth into their chicken.I get the menu and realize, it's only two pages, all items printed in big font with big white space between, so yes.. my choices are quite limited. That's fine with me. I ask my waitress about the specials, and, to my surprise, she only mentions the beef ribs.. ""Okay"", I think to myself,  go ahead and order the ribs and the Rotisserie chicken. As I'm heading towards the bathroom, I notice signs of ""run-downess"".. It's not too bad, but it's bad enough for you to make a note of it. I'm coming back, just had my order served and ready to enjoy it! The ribs were.. okay. Overly charred and kinda dry. So was the chicken.. dry..  I've taken time to read other people's reviews, some claim it was the best rotisserie chicken they had tried. To me, it was a very mediocre rotisserie chicken. In the end, I received a check for $27 just for the two dishes and bottle of Malta, a Colombian pop. I think more fair price would've been $20-$22. That was the last nail in the coffin. Again, my kudos to a VERY friendly staff there and I loved the atmosphere, but... On my way out, I got a couple of bunuelos, $1 e.a. Kinda liked them, they taste almost like Russian donuts.  Making a small talk with the grill man while being served, he says - I like your ..., what do you call this.. (points at my wallet) - The wallet? Do you like my wallet? - Yes, yes, I like.

Recommendations: to start get yourself at least a couple empanadas, as a main dish I'd recommend either the rotisserie chicken that's thrown directly on the coals right before it's served to you and is nothing short of succulent or the national dish called the bandeja paisa which is heart cloggingly delicious. As you eat be sure to wash it all down with a guanabana con leche ""milkshake"". Finally, for desert try the brevas con arequipe.

Chicken comes with potatoes and fried plantains. They also, have rabbit on the menu. I personally enjoyed the rabbit a little more than the chicken. The texture wasn't very different, but the rabbit did seem a little sweeter. They do offer many other Columbian dishes but this isn't your typical Columbian steak house. This has more of whole in the wall Triple D type feel to it. Not romantic in any way. I believe they do carry out as well.

They definitely have good food: The roasted chicken is deliciously flavorful and moist, but my favorite things are the Colombian-style empanadas, which have a masa crust instead of a flour one (on a funny note, they are referred to as ""meat turnovers"" on the English menu, but ""empanada"" is one of those crossover words like ""taco"" and ""quesadilla"" that need not be translated); nevertheless, at $1 a pop, they are a can't-miss! Service is ... serviceable, but it's often rushed and no-frills. I'm not bothered by this given that it's a quick, eat-and-go kind of place. However, what bothered me at my last visit was seeing the cooks wheel a garbage bin full of raw whole chickens on spits from the back to the wood-burning grills upfront. I'm assuming -- and very hopeful that I'm correct -- that this bin has not been re-purposed, and that is is exclusively used to transport chickens.

The first time I bought takeout, a 1/4 white meat chicken and it was as dry and flavorless as a spoonful of sand. The second time I went, my husband and kids joined me and when we entered, I saw the owner sitting at the back table by the kitchen and he was on the phone but made eye contact with me, never once signaling me to take a seat, so basically ignored us. So we sat by the front and an elderly couple and their adult children came in and also stood at the front waiting for direction on whether to take a seat or wait, the owner just looked right at them without saying a word. They figured it out, like we did, and just sat wherever they fancied.  We ordered our drinks, a coke, and an empanada from the smiley waitress and she leaves, five minutes later a male waiter comes by and asks us what we'd like to get started with and we informed him we had already placed that order with the waitress so he leaves. He comes back a few minutes later with our drinks and proceeds to take our dinner order. I order the matrimonio as did my husband and my kids ordered the chicken breast plate. Had to order rice and beans on the side as the dish didn't come with it. Minutes pass and our food arrives and I ask about the empanada  which I had a craving for and he was surprised and said he didn't know I ordered it.  All of our chicken dishes were dry and super garlicky. I love garlic but not enough to sweat it out of my pores at the end of the day. The beans were flavorless as was the rice.

When we sat down we were handed the english menu.

Honestly-what do they put on this chicken? some ancient secret Colombian ingredient only sold by the gram here in the states?

The churrasco is yummy too- I can't decide whose is better, theirs or Las Tablas. The chimichurri sauce is almost identical. I would rather have the yuca than the arepa that you get at LBR. It's a tasteless white corn cake that I can do without. I don't even think a slice of cheese alone could help it. But that damned chicken? I tell everyone about this place. Prices are pretty reasonable. I ordered a 1/2 chicken, rice and chimichurri, they were out of platanos tonight, so they  gave me 3 potatoes instead. All for $10.30. The only complaint is the $2 side order of rice. Kind of a joke, but maybe its cuz I'm 1/2 Asian and love my white rice with just about everything! Empanadas aren't bad-could use more filing though. The dinner with the fried egg, steak and chicharron is friggin good too. too bad they don't have a steak and roast chicken combo.

This was the best chicken I have ever had. I have driven past La Brasa Roja prob 500 times in the last month and have never even noticed it!  What is on that chicken? Do they bottle it?  I bought the full chicken meal, when I brought it home I got a quick ""oh, I am not into Columbian Food, what else did you get"" from hubby. Then he tasted it and wanted to go back to pick up another!",0.8947,0.912,0.088,0.0,0.546969696969697
2007-03-30,5.0,"All I can say is WOW. This HAS to be the best chicken in Chicago! The place is one of the places you would just pass up walking by, but once inside and tasting the chicken you will be hooked. They are wooden charcoal cooked and are fresh. And yes the chicken is dirt cheap for the taste. They also have other items like beef ribs, but once inside there is just one thing you will want. If you are looking for a place I definitely recommend La Brasa Roja!",0.9631,0.743,0.228,0.03,0.6225
2007-03-01,4.0,"""So What'cha, What'cha, What'cha Want?"" If I had to guess, I'd say Mike D, Adrock and MCA rolled a fat one and rapped their asses over to La Brasa Roja to indulge in some chicken before they scratched down the lyrics to Finger Lickin' Good.  The birds at LBR are marinated in some crazy Colombian nectar-of-the-Gods and slow-roasted to perfection.  My mom said, ""What do you think they marinate this delicious chicken in and do you think they would give me the recipe?""  I said, ""Mom, there ain't nuthin' in the world that could make chicken taste so good--it's heavenly!  And, I think they would have to kill you if they told you the secret to their success!""   Despite what a lot of foodies think, you don't have to pay and arm & a leg, or sell your one-of-a-kind Mickey Mantle card, nor do you have to promise your first born, to enjoy a fecking delicious meal here in Chick-a-go.  The proof is in the pudding, kids. Or, in this case, el pollo.  Sure, this place is the size of a NYC studio, and yeah, the cold air takes y'er breath away when someone opens the door,  but you can get a 1/2 chicken dinner with all the sides for like $4.95.   In fact, I think I heard Bob Barker yell out from the kitchen, ""Let's make a deal!""    If you want some traditional food, ask for el calentado con los heuvos y el carne...or los patacones (fried green plantain cakes) or las empanadas and jugo de lulo con leche (a Colombian fruit made into a juice blended with milk).  The only thing I was kind of disappointed about were the arepas (Colombian corn cakes and the Colombian version of the Mexican tortilla); I have eaten better hockey pucks with more flavor.  Spanish 101: La Brasa Roja means The Red Coal and is quite apropos when you see how the succulant chicken is prepared.",0.9549,0.874,0.098,0.028,0.6408119658119659
2007-01-15,5.0,"We love this place. My husband is Colombian, so when we moved around the corner from this little place, of course we had to try it. It was great. The chicken is the most popular, and when you walk in, you will immediately know why. You can't help but smell it. We just took 10 people and spent only $102 (including the tip) and most went home with left overs. The Arepas (corn pancakes) were better than anywhere else we have had them, but you have to get the ones with queso (cheese) or they are bland. The Empenadas (meat and potato filled turnovers)  were just like Tia (auntie) makes in her kitchen. And the sauce is great. Put it on the Empanada/Arepa and it brings out the flavors. Carry out is usually only 10-15 minutes, and dine in is about the same. Service is great! Being Colombian helps with this though since we didn't have any trouble communicating with the staff. If you want to be brave and try some Colombian beverages try the Colombiana (Champagne Cola). My husband loves the Pony Malta, I HATE IT!   I would recommend for first timers bringing a friend and sharing a whole chicken, and getting 2 empanadas, 1 arepa co queso (the appetizer not the one that comes with the meal - it is different) to share (they are very filling and expand in your stomach), and 2 Colombiana. 07/02/07 I have been reading other's reviews and since we live around the corner and love the place, I would say If you were disappointented with the Arepa, it was probably because it was the one that came with the meal. It is just Mas Arepa Flower and water then heated. The Appetizer that you order is actually Arepa con Queso, and is so much better and has so much more flavor. Consider trying this one next time you go and don't even bother with the other one unless you just like them. I bring them to my mother-in-law and she eats them with her coffee the next morning, which she says is what she used to do when she was younger in Colombia with her mother.  Also they do accept credit cards, and there is not minimum. We use our debit card all the time for a to go order of under $10.",0.9976,0.79,0.193,0.017,0.5226190476190478
