There was one small incident where the someone spilled water and it seeped down the small counter where we were sitting and got all over my shirt and coat.

2015-11-30,5.0,"I'm writing this post to specifically address Blake M.'s comments from 10/31/15.  Blake M., I don't even really know where to start with you. Did somebody do you wrong? Perhaps you fell down, intoxicated on Halloween night before you wrote this? Are you feeling unfulfilled in your life? Do you enjoy...anything? I'm referring, you're probably wondering, to the 91 Yelp reviews that I personally took the time to read after first coming across your review of Third Rail Tavern.  The pattern looks something like this:  Summer House...ONE STAR River Roast...ONE STAR Osteria Langhe...ONE STAR  Celeste...ONE STAR Here's one of my favorites from your review of Wildberry Pancakes ""Waitress also upsold me a pour over coffee, which wasn't on the menu, and told me it was only $1 more than a normal coffee order. Will never go back."" BLAAAKKEEEE. WHY? This woman has done nothing wrong, yet you belittle her. Even when you like something, you refer to it as being 'not horrible'. This is no way to live your life.  Or Osteria La Madia  ""Servers have no idea how to make recommendations for wine with food, and when they do, they point at selections and say 'guests like this one.'  Who is training these people on the beverage?? Pretty lackluster showing.""  WAIT. Are you industry?  Or II Sogno  ""The inside is stale and old, and pretty much lacks character and is upstairs so kind of strange, and stairs are dirty and not clean either. Pretty good idea for a first impression."" Thanks for pointing out that the upstairs is...strange. Oh, and for making the distinction that the stairs are dirty and ALSO not clean. Because those are two entirely different things.  Lastly, from Bar Siena ""The little donuts they promote for dessert, at the end are pretty cruddy. Greasy and flavors a seem to be made from processed foods catalogue. Lazy and unimpressive."" Jesus, Blake. THEY'RE DONUTS. You either have expectations that are unattainable or the palate of a god damn panda bear. I really feel for the woman who you'll one day make your wife.  ""You could stand to lose a few pounds, Carol."" ""Are you really going to wear that out tonight, Carol?"" ""Your performance was inspired, but honestly I've had better. ONE STAR, CAAAAROLL."" Poor Carol M.  In fact, I found almost ZERO Five Star Reviews. Of those I did find, one was a storage facility that you deemed 'perfect for my needs'. Funny how easy you are to please when your persistent and insatiable hunger isn't involved.  Listen, Blake. I get it. For whatever reason, you feel the need to prove you have superior knowledge over what's good and what isn't. When a highly anticipated restaurant opens in the neighborhood and rave reviews begin popping up on whatever pretentious fine-dining blog crap that you read, you cannot wait to get on Yelp to proclaim that it was, 'just okay'. Look. It's fine. This is who you are. But why. WHY Third Rail Tavern?  ""This place has awful burger."" - Blake M.  Blake, Third Rail has nine different burgers. NINE! Not to mention their great selection of mouthwatering sliders. Is there a specific burger that you're mentioning here? Are you implying that because a burger that you ate here was 'awful', this would suggests that all the burger(s) are then also awful? Or has the word 'burger' become just a word that you throw around in the singular in so many of your reviews, like 'concept' and 'beverage' to prove once and for all that YOU ARE BETTER THAN US.  At this point it doesn't really matter. I've spent the last six hours trying to figure you out but I just can't anymore. Blake, there are many things that Third Rail 'IS'. A One Star Tavern is not one of them. So when you 'head over to Beer Bistro and enjoy good beer and better food', I'll be at 1133 W. Madison with a Tavern Burger in my left and the best bloody mary in Chicago on my right, enjoying my life. You should try it sometime. Cheers.",0.9958,0.801,0.135,0.064,0.5462046096977605

My husband and I went in for a quick lunch while out running errands one Sunday.  It was just before noon, so football was kicking off and they had plenty of TV's on.  After waiting forever to place our order, another employee walked up to us and told us he was changing the channel to the ""Red Zone.""  Then he looked at me and said ""do you even know what the ""Red Zone"" is?  I was so startled by such an odd question that I just looked at him.  Then he looked at my husband and said ""She doesn't even know what the Red Zone is, does she?""....all while laughing.  It was so sexist...and odd...and RUDE.  My husband assured him that I do, so then he kept going....he says to me ""well what's your favorite team playing today?"" I told him I didn't have a favorite, that I was a hockey fan, and he just laughed at me.   We almost walked out, and really should have.  The food was horrible, it took forever, and the entire time I was just waiting for this guy to come back so I could tell him how ridiculously rude and sexist he was.  Luckily he didn't pass by again as it saved me from a confrontation that was unnecessary on a beautiful Sunday afternoon.  You want to be a sports bar?  Fine.  But you have enough competition on Madison street that you can't get away with being an asshole to ANY patrons, especially women.  It was easily one of the rudest encounters I've experienced at a restaurant...ever.",0.9358,0.743,0.153,0.104,0.5767361111111112

The good: service and food were great and as a place to catch a bite to eat prior to going to the UC I would still HIGHLY recommend this bar The bad: watching a hawks game here was extremely frustrating.  Yes, they play the TV audio during the action and yes they have a lot of TVs however unfortunately the place is way too packed to really enjoy the game and the TV's were dated.  Unless you are adjacent to a TV I felt that most people in the bar were more concernd with socializing  than actually watching the game.  Definitely not the same vibe you get from other west madison hawks bars.  Furthermore, many of their flat screens have AWFUL and i mean AWFUL pixelation already and need to be updated. One last thing, I admire the head bartenders enthusiasm and beating of the drum to get everyone fired up for the hawks, however the ""Detroit sucks"" while comical initially became fairly played out by the 3rd period of a stanley cup game.  Especially because we were playing the LA Kings in game 5 of the western conference finals.  This was even more frustrating when, with 1minute left in regulation, the chant morphed into ""Boston sucks""- again a bit premature in a game that wasn't over.  You can imagine how pissed off I was when LA ended up tying the game with 14seconds left.  The hockey gods surely didn't appreciate that one.  Most probably wouldn't have cared, however for those non-bandwagon fans looking for a great Hawks bar I would look elsewhere.",-0.2604,0.749,0.124,0.127,0.46301504629629625

There are daily drink and/or food specials, and they seem to be able to make all sorts of trendy or frou-frou mixed drinks and shots. Prices are neighborhood-moderate ($5 pints); bartenders friendly; and you can run a tab, of course. There's waitress service at the fifteen or so tall tables, a few of which are perched in the Madison St. windows looking over the streetscape. There's outdoor seating in the summer. Tidy, well-supplied, and well-lighted bathrooms. For sports types, the walls are lined with monitors (classic old Chicago photos fill the spaces in between), and you can usually get the accommodating bartender to tune the nearest one to your game, although you may have to live with the sound tuned to the big game on the other TVs (Hawks, Bulls, Bears, etc.). But when they're on their game they kill the commercials and fill the time with recorded tunes. The place does get crowded before games at the United Center a mile down Madison. Best time to arrive? 15 minutes before game-time, after everyone going to the game has left. I have to admit I've never been to Third Rail after 10pm, so I have no idea what the late-night scene is like. Could be an entirely different animal than I've experienced.  Third Rail looks like and has the feel of the old Chicago corner tap, slightly modernized. Great place to hang out.",0.9887,0.843,0.129,0.027,0.40420054200542005

I had no food here, but the things I saw looked and smelled good. There are plasmas everywhere and great sightlines for gamewatching. That's pretty important around here. They were quick to change the Blackhawks game, that seemed to be on every TV in the joint, over to the Bulls just in time to see them rally from 23 down to win in double OT on the road.

Anyway, the four of us went to Third Rail for a quick bite and some beers last night. We generally go to Beer Bistro for this type of thing, but Third Rail had $2 burgers so we figured why not. The place is SUPER dark inside which definitely lends itself to being more of a bar than a pub or restaurant. Their menu is pretty small but since we were there for the burgers, it was a non-issue.  I have to say that for two bucks the burgers were really tasty - good enough at full price too!. Since its a Thursday special all condiments and sides, etc are ala carte where normally they're included - our bill came to around $60 total with 4 burgers, two sides, and probably 8 beers - totally reasonable.

2008-03-28,2.0,"We visited the Third Rail Tavern on March 27 at about 5 PM.  At this early hour, there were only a few patrons at the bar.  My wife and I ordered a cabernet sauv, and it came cold.  We talked to our waitress a bit, and she returned with two room temp cabs., all was well.  She got to talking and yucking it up with some of the bar patrons, and it took about 20minutes to get our food order in.  I thought it was odd that she did not write our order down.  I just thought this was the way they did it here.   When our order arrived,  30 minutes later, it was brought by a different waitress.   The things I asked for, like grilled onions and bacon on my Blue Burger were not there.  Also, she never put in the side order for the Tavern Fries.  I wanted to get this corrected, but now our new waitress was seated at  the bar enjoying her dinner, yucking it up with the other employees..  I think they need need a little more focus on the customers, and maybe not so much on themselves? I will say that the food was well presented and very flavorful, cooked to the desired doneness.  The ambiance of the room was very comfortable.  The service just isn't great.  Don't know if I would recommend it just yet.",0.9354,0.884,0.09,0.026,0.4378123338649655

2008-02-29,4.0,"Nice, laidback bar with a casual, comfortable vibe.  The food is better than the average fare you'd get at a bar, though it's still just bar food.  My ""T Chase"" (chopped sirloin sandwich) was quite tasty, though my request for medium rare came out far closer to medium well.  Their tavern fries (ie. fries covered with garlic and parmesan cheese) were tasty too but I think they could be even better if they use real garlic and parmesan, as opposed to the powdery stuff that I think they used. Beer selection is ok -- nothing too impressive but any place with Guiness and Fat Tire on tap is good enough for me.  They also have a martini menu that is a bit overpriced for what they are ($12 per martini, $14 if you want them to make it a large).  But they do have drink specials every day so you can get away with not spending a ton of money if you're looking to save a few bucks.   At the end of the day, I'm giving this place four stars primarily because of their terrific service.  Friendly bartenders who understand the importance of being attentive without intrusive.  Depending on what day you go, definitely make an effort to introduce yourself to Ben, the bartender from Australian.  Nice guy -- he hooked us up with beacoup free shots throughout the night (I think he was interested in my friend but, hey, whatever works you know?).  I'll definitely make my way back to Third Rail again.",0.9955,0.767,0.221,0.012,0.5776014109347444

2008-01-31,4.0,"I stopped by the Third Rail last night to meet a friend, grab a bite to eat and catch up.This place came recommended to me by someone who hasn't steered me wrong yet and this was no exception. The Third Rail is beautiful.  Long (at least 40 feet) dark wood bar, high tops scattered about, a tin ceiling and exposed brick walls make this a great place to sit and have a drink with friends. My friend was running late so I had some time to sit and chat with the bartender who was great and who made me feel welcome right away (I hate walking in a bar by myself!).  She introduced me to some of the other people who were seated around me so within minutes I felt right at home.  When my friend finally arrived- they treated him like he was a ""regular"" at the place which is just what I would expect from a neighborhood bar like this. The menu, while smallish in nature, delivers some pretty decent food.  We both had the patty melt, some of their special Parmesan cheese coated fries and the onion rings.  The sandwiches were great-served on marbled rye with lots of cheese and sweet grilled onions with the burger being delicious and cooked perfectly.  There are daily specials- last night it was $3 Goose Island Beers, $4 Jack Daniels and half price appetizers up until 7pm. They have a wide range of vodkas and their beer list has a good selection of  both imports and domestics.  I would have expected the place to be busier on a Wednesday night but most of the crowd left before 8 so there were only a handful of people in the place which was fine with me as it wasn't noisy and there weren't people yelling over my shoulder for a drink. I found the music to be a bit eclectic- it was all over the place in terms of genre, artist, etc. which I liked.   When I asked the bartender about it she explained it simply, ""It's the owners ipod on shuffle"".  Actually wished I had met the owner as his taste in music was right up my alley.   So will I be back?  Absolutely.  In this area of the West Loop- there are lots of choices in bars, but while I once felt a bit like Goldilocks deciding where to go, I may have found my new favorite.  The WestEnd?  Too loud. Jaks Tap? Too quiet.  But the Third Rail?  Just right.  See you there.",0.9918,0.853,0.131,0.015,0.5205935553807893
2008-01-11,3.0,"I'm internally conflicted about this place.  I come here very often, but I am not a big fan of the ""polished look"" that other Yelpers have mentioned. I am not a big fan of big screen TVs, that nearly kill any attempts this bar makes at keeping the atmosphere classy and sophisticated. Also, the food menu isn't very impressive.  I am not a big meat eater - and my only options here are:  - a bland grilled cheese sandwich - a bland  salad - a side of fries Not very creative! (for a ""polished"" bar). So, why do I come here so often?  Well, here it is: - Schneider Wiesen Edel-Weisse... my favorite beer in the whole wide world, and only a 10 minute drive from my house! How can I resist!

All that's missing is the beer.  Only four beers?  Seriously?  I had read other Yelp reviews before I went, but figured they may have upgraded in the last few weeks.  My beer was $5.  My wife's wine (cheapest they have, according to the server) was $8.50.  The food was cheap, and it was ok - nothing special, though it was a step up from normal bar food.   I think this place charges too much for their beer and tries too hard with their food.   I think something will have to change with this place - they seem to be having some sort of identity crisis, as it's not clear what they want to be or what crowd they are targeting.  Maybe I'll try it again sometime, but for now if I'm looking for a beverage and a snack in that area, I'll go to Beer Bistro or Jak's.",-0.8913,0.796,0.073,0.131,0.40523809523809523
2006-12-11,4.0,"Ya know...we ended up there by accident.  Planned on going across the street to Phil & Lou's, but they were closed for a private party.   This review is all about the food and the single Third Rail Cosmo I drank.  Burgers were great, they really were.  Love the buns that they use, cheddar was great and the side of fries (parmesean & garlic) were so tasty!  Loved 'em.  I tried the onion rings as well which were good, a little too big and overly breaded for me, but my husband liked them.  We started off with the boneless buffalo wings, we got the hot, didn't find them to be very hot, but they tasted great.  Didn't like their bleu cheese dressing though, way too sweet. The Third Rail Cosmo was good.  Not great.  While it's cute that it has a tootsie pop in it, I'm not the tootsie pop lovin' type...and I wasn't expecting it from a bar like Third Rail and I didn't really like the touch, but hell, maybe someone else would.  It's more of a trendy clubby touch I think... I liked the look of the bar, liked the dark look...the liquor layout on the bar was fun to look at.  Our watiress was very nice and attentive.  I felt comfortable being there and I would definitley go back.   Definitley happy that Phil & Lou's was closed to the public that day or we may have never tried Third Rail.   I imagine my next trip will be more of a 4-star experience, so I'll give it 4-stars today.  I'll just order a beer next time.",0.9976,0.687,0.263,0.05,0.4888988095238096

My friend Suzy and I went to third four times during the first couple of weeks they were open.  We ordered a lot of drinks, tipped well and met and chatted with the bartenders, managers, and owners.  We were all on a first name basis-- great, right? Well, last Saturday at 9:50 we decided to begin our night.  We rushed through the freezing, slippery, ice and snow to go to the bar that we felt most comfortable in my new neighborhood-- Third Rail Tavern.  We walked in, found a place at the unusually busy bar, and ordered our drinks.  We were settled in.  Within moments, one of the ""Third Railers"" that we were now on a first name basis with, came over to talk.  He shared with us that there was a private party going on for his best friend's birthday (who we knew as well)...  So we went over to the Birthday boy to give him our best birthday wishes. After our birthday wishes, we were pulled aside and told that we were not invited to the party, but it would be over in 10 minutes, at 10 pm, we could wait outside or come back.  So, at this point we had to ashamedly grab our coats, and do the walk out with our heads down as everyone watched.   This is not the way to treat regulars at a new bar!  If they had stopped us at the door, I would have had no problem coming back in 10 minutes..... But making us do a walk of shame out of our neighborhood digs, NOT COOL. And the disgusted faces we were getting from people as we were walking out, you would've thought we had leaches crawling on our faces. Maybe my pride is bruised easily, but I will not be going back to Third Rail on a regular basis anymore.",0.9933,0.769,0.17,0.061,0.39404492112825457
