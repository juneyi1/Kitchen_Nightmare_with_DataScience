2017-08-11,2.0,"To keep it short, and despite the great service and vibe: Both beef plates (mine was a strip steak, hers was short rib) ranged between rubbery bad (strip steak) and meh (short rib.... how do you screw up ribs). The ""exotic"" sauces they came with were nothing to sing about. The starters portions were small (Lobster Potstickers were very tasty, but were exactly 5-6 pieces). The Watermelon salad was not as good as the one I make at home, and it too had microscopic portions. The desert was equally small. The upside down pineapple tasted meh. Overall, food ranged between bad and meh, while the atmosphere was great. We would have enjoyed a better meal literally anywhere else in a 5-mile radius, but we were looking for Hawaiian, and this place had 4* reviews. Based on the food, I'd advise against going there. Oh, the Kimshi Mac and Cheese was incredible, but it's Mac and Cheese. You can't screw that up.",-0.882,0.82,0.047,0.133,0.5040123456790124

I've been to Roy's twice, and each time I've gotten several of the specials from the aloha hour menu. My favorite is the ebi roll and short ribs (which have great flavor), but I've also tasted the ahi roll (tasty, but the butter sauce threw me off a little bit), the fries (which come in a pretty large basket), spring rolls (6 rolls per portion), and lobster dumplings (5 dumplings per portion). Their $3 longboards are also very refreshing.  Service is friendly and very quick-- I've come both times at around 5PM, and it's not too busy around then.

We were seated promptly and ordered our app quickly, which was the special sushi roll of the night, and the rest of our meal. We had cocktails from the bar, so we took some time to look at the wine menu. We noticed three large tables in our vicinity, so we knew there would be a rush of some groups. Little did we know our server would be so busy with these tables, he would stop attending to us for quite some period. We were eventually comped my boyfriends meal due to the steak being cooked incorrectly TWICE. Our server, when he was able to return to us and realize what happened, was VERY apologetic. He did his best considering the large party. They also took our picture and presented us with a  nice card after our dessert. It was a lovely way to celebrate us. Unfortunately, based on the quality of the food, my boyfriend refuses to return. I work close by, and I will stop in to try the Aloha Hour at some point to give Roy's another chance.  Food:  Special sushi roll (two types of tuna with spicy sauce and jalapeños): HOT, but delicious! 5 stars Shellfish Sampler: Lobster tail was good-4 stars.

Waygu New York Strip - Boyfriend ordered it medium and specifically said ""pink in the middle"". It came out medium well. Our server was busy with the large party he was also assisting, so it took 15 minutes before we could alert someone that it was not correct. The brussels sprouts on the side were not cooked at all.

2017-03-17,3.0,"Ehh. From NOLA. In Chicago on business. Ate by myself at the chefs table. That didn't keep them from screwing up though. Ordered the lakanilau roll. The wagyu beef was at most a sliver the size u would put on a slide under a microscope. They also forgot the tempura asparagus that was supposed to be in the roll. I'm sitting at the chefs table yet it took me about 20 minutes to get someone to ask me if I was enjoying it. Um, no- what tipped u off? I've been sitting here in front of your chefs for 20 minutes and haven't taken a bite?? Once it was made properly I'd give it a 2/5- so wouldn't recommend it. The poke bowl others in the restaurant ordered looked pretty good. Wish I'd have ordered that. Got the mahi mahi for an entree. Cooked perfectly though could've used salt- like any amount would've been good. They absolutely checked on me right away this time. I hate complaining though so I didn't say anything about the salt, plus I had some soy sauce left from my roll.  Sitting at the chefs table I witnessed things sitting in the window for an HOUR!! before being delivered to a table and some were fried items! They weren't even under a heat lamp! I Also saw several things being sent back to the kitchen. I hate being mean on a review so I'm giving 3 stars. I almost always give at least 4 but I just can't. Sorry- I really wanted to love it. The chocolate soufflé was pretty freaking good I must say. Though- I ordered it at the same time as my entree and it still took forever to get the dessert after I was finished eating. And I'm a slow eater.  I know sometimes going to eat by yourself, you run the risk of being forgotten or not cared about bc your bill won't be as much as the 4 top in the corner but I never tip less than $25 no matter the bill. I tipped $30 here and my bill was $128 with tax. So- please don't ignore me. I do it just to show servers that they shouldn't ignore single seaters.  Anyway- would I recommend it?

2017-01-09,3.0,"I was very much looking forward to dinner at Roy's. I hadn't eaten at an Hawaiian restaurant in a very long time, and reviews looked decent. I also received an email for a discount on Sunday and Monday, so I decided to venture in. The restaurant is located next to Holy Name Cathedral and a more businessy location in Chicago. When we got there at 6:30-ish pm, there was only one other table. By 7:30 pm, there were a handful more. Anyway, I really wanted to get a poke, but there was 2 on the menu: rainbow poke and poke bowl. I was told that the rainbow poke was more of a minced poke staked up on top of rice in a tower form and the poke bowl was more like sashimi and traditional poke. I opted for the bowl because I wanted the more traditional style with bigger chunks of fish. Nope. Got a bowl that looks like a deconstructed tower with finely minced fish. It was ok, but not what I was expecting. Tuna tasted like it was defrosted or a few days old. The salmon had some chewy parts. And the hamachi had a few gamey pieces. The original avocado slices they gave me was so tough and rubbery that I couldn't even break it apart on my plate, but they did send a new plate of ripe avocado for me. Overall, this was just meh and not worth the retail price of over $16. Then I had the ribeye steak. I asked for rare+ and got medium. The quality wasn't very good as it was a bit tough. But the sauce and asparagus was good. Again, at over $42, I expected it to be much better than it was. The only thing that I would definitely have again is their chocolate soufflé. It's not actually a soufflé but a molten lava cake. Surprised they didn't name it something to do with volcanos like Hawaii is known for. But anyway, that was delicious.  And the mango mojito was also a thumbs up. With misses in the starter and entree departments, I couldn't give this a 4-5 star rating.

It was so bland, I've made better miso myself and I always thought mine wasn't that good. Their water also tastes like sulphur (not sure if this might be a regular for Baltimore?), and for the price, I hoped to at least leave the restaurant full. I got the salmon with rice and cucumber, and the size of the salmon was worth 3$ at the grocery store. It did taste good, but a little bland on the flavoring.

The couple in front of us had no reservations and were told to wait fifteen mins so basically making reservations saved us 5 minutes... uh huh. Anyway we were seated in a dining room that had many empty tables- (why did we wait?) next to a large table of eight, Apparently a retirement party. I should have asked to move... You guessed it they were loud and boisterous. You know the kind, they act as if they are in a private home with no regard or consideration of others.. ugh We waited approx a half hour for a bowl of soup and a salad for me. Soup was warm not hot and the chunk of salad needed more dressing and bring your own croutons- I had four. The menu was fixed so why the long delay? So service was slow... the server had pretentious flowery canned statements she would serve between courses which was annoying. Not that we saw much of her. Our empty martini glasses sat on our table almost until we left. We had ordered them and finished them long ago. Main course- chateaubriand was good- the food was fine to good. However there is more to dining than just an ok meal and it wasn't exactly cheap either... I thought this was a nicer restaurant than it turned out to be. The whole meal took two hours and not because it was well paced or we had lots to eat or drink. They really weren't that busy judging by all the empty tables.... I really wanted to leave about halfway through the meal. Of course our server was prompt with the check. After our entrees had been delivered she never showed up until the check. Not cool.

Other restaurants with much lower stars were suggested by locals, but I trusted yelp. I walked into the bar at the same time as another gentleman. We both waited for the bartender to get off his break, or what I assumed was his break, maybe 5 min. Other gentleman ordered a beer, the bisk and the burger with fries. Right after that the bartender asked me if I would like a drink. I stated food first and then asked him what is the 1 thing I should have (i always ask this question). He recommended the black pepper rockfish, so just asked him bisk (it's 20° out) or the lobster pot stickers. Pot stickers came out right away. Didn't know lobster was brown, but I was hungry. Finished them and waited, waited & waited. Other gentleman finished his meal, paid & left. Still no entree. I thought I'd check and see if I was being irrational  (hangry) or not. So I checked the time I sent a text which was after walking in. 40 MINUTES. Then the bartender let's me know he just checked on my food and it was on the grill. Don't lie! 10 min later my fish came up with 4 half slices of fingerling potatoes for over $40. I tipped 10% which I never do because the front of the house should always cover for the back of the house. 1 touch in 40 min is not covering.",0.5087,0.919,0.047,0.034,0.2896258503401361

Wasn't even sure they were open. Started ok - menus, water. Then we ordered and waited, and waited, and waited. Looked around noticed others were also waiting.  I wanted something light and healthy, and I thought this being a place for fresh fish I could have a sushi roll and call it good. I ordered the sunrise roll (see photo), not realizing it was fried. I guess the word ""crunchy"" should have been my clue. It was gross. The coating was so thick I couldn't taste the fish, and the rice was gooey and flavorless. They brought me a bucket of soy sauce and maybe I was supposed to drown this thing.  The pieces of the roll were swimming in a sauce consisting mostly of rapidly congealing butter. It was disgusting.  Husband ordered an egg and brioche and was brought a burger with egg. We had waited more than 30 minutes for the food so we just didn't notice at first that it wasn't the right dish. A manager came over and asked about it, but didn't really make any apology or excuse, although they did adjust the price to reflect what we actually got.  Asked for some ketchup for the fries and the waiting began again. At that point a manager walked through the dining room and noticed our unhappy eyes searching for the  world traveler who had been sent out for ketchup.  Instead of asking if anything was amiss, he called out my husbands captain American shirt, pointed and said something affirmative about the Avengers or, I don't know exactly because he never stopped walking.

And then we waited for desert (we pre-ordered the hot chocolate soufflé, so we couldn't just skip desert). Ultimately, what made the long wait so unpleasant was a table of eight people next to us, shouting to be heard above the general din of the dining room. They weren't the only loud table, but they were the closest to us. It made conversation almost impossible. Our server did check back with us, refilling our drinks on a regular basis while we waited.

The pineapple upside down cake and chocolate soufflé were hits. Will definitely be back!! Kayla was our server and she really could not have been any better. My little brother didn't like the sauce on the filet and she took it back no problem and had a new one out in 5 minutes. Even gave him a vanilla ice cream at the end to make up for it.

When we arrived at 8:20 we expected to wait a few minutes and were told it would be a 30 minute wait because some tables were staying seated longer than expected. We were very understanding, asked them to call us when our table was ready. We walked around for 30 minutes and hadn't received a call, so we came back and asked what was going on. A different hostess again told me that it would be 30 minutes. I gave her my phone number again and she said she would call as soon as it's ready. Never got a call. Will never attempt to eat here again. If they cannot honor their reservations they shouldn't take reservations. Update: not only did this happen last weekend but I received a message from them asking if I would be open to a phone conversation. I responded saying that I would and left my phone number. I have yet to be contacted and I posted this review 8 days ago. I urge you not to make a reservation here, there's a good chance they won't honor it.

My coworker and I went for restaurant week and had the tempura-crusted ahi roll which was surprisingly good! Crispy on the outside and fresh fish on the inside so what's not to love. The main was a braised short rib which broke apart with my fork and was flavorful. I would have given more stars but my chai creme brûlée was not what I was expecting. The custard was too heavy to be a creme brûlée. My coworker's chocolate torte was like a heavy brownie and would have been the better bet.

2016-01-31,2.0,"This 2-star review is for last night's experience at Roy's.   To be fair, I have been here twice before and both visits were 5 star, but last night Roy's dropped the ball.  The review is not a one-star because the girls at the front desk were very nice and the food was tasty. First, we were seated a few minutes shy of an hour and a half after our reservation.  Appreciate that -- an-hour-and-a-half.  As if waiting isn't bad enough, they gave us no indication, when we checked in, that they were THAT backed up.  They said that a lot of their reservations were running late and that the restaurant was a bit behind, but common!!  When I check in, you need to tell me that you're a good hour+ behind so that I can decide if I need to go elsewhere.  We had tickets to a show and needed to get out by a certain time.  They did however come around with free fruity drinks twice and once with wanton wrapped spicy rolls for those of us waiting.  Ok, so one half of a spring roll and 2 drinks to pacify me, thanks.   We are finally seated in the small side room and unfortunately for us, there was a birthday party that took up most of that room which meant a loud and rude dining experience for the other 4 small parties that were unlucky enough to share the room with them.  This birthday party was clearly drowning out the other sound in the room and management should have either given them the room to themselves, or asked them to keep it down.  Roy's a nice restaurant and their loud, selfish behavior was ruining the evening for the rest of us.  As a result of running late to begin with and not being able to hear my friends sitting 2 feet away from me at the table, we ate quickly, didn't order wine and left. Our server was very receptive of our need to get out of there by 10PM and our food was brought in quickly.  Another contributing factor to my 2 star review was that my cod and scallops were supposed to come with lobster risotto. Instead of risotto, I was served cubed potatoes.  When the food was brought out, none of the staff running the food, nor our server, mentioned anything about it.  You can't just bring me something else without explaining yourself.  Not at an upscale seafood restaurant.  This isn't Denny's where you're going to substitute pancake syrups. We made our reservation a month ago and were very much looking forward to our Roy's dinner.  It fell flat on its face. I will seriously reconsider dining here again.",0.9896,0.837,0.12,0.044,0.5119329805996473

Unfortunately, many others had made the same decision, so the lobby was bustling when I arrived. I put my name in and went to the bar, and mostly enjoyed the Hawaiian martini there (the pineapple was divine). But long after the 30 minutes had elapsed, we sat at the bar, while walk-ins were seated. I reminded the hostesses that we were waiting at the bar, and then about 15 minutes later, I went back again to ask when we would be seated. The manager apologized for the oversight and offered to give us a credit on our bill, which was very nice of her... However, our service was incredibly slow. We waited another 10 minutes just for water... Eventually our server came to the table, with another waitress-in-training behind her. It was insanely slow. Taking orders took forever, they promised a complimentary appetizer due to the wait... which then also took forever. Mind you, this was a business dinner, not meant to go on for 3-4 hours. The lobster potstickers were tasty, the edamame was good, too. They ran out of the filet mignon potstickers (more delay time) and eventually brought out dinner. The parmesan-crusted cod with scallops would probably have been delicious, if served hot. As it was almost cool to the touch, not so much.

2016-01-15,2.0,"Meh, not impressed. My appetizer was pretty decent - Hawaiian Poke - but having just been to Hawaii, and eating different varieties of poke almost every day, I was very disappointed that it wasn't at all the same.  My entree was the Butterfish (Alaskan Black Cod).  It was coated in a sweet/burnt-flavored Asian sauce, not good. The fish itself was decent, but that misoyaki sauce on it was just not yummy. The furikake rice was good, no complaints there, and the baby bok choy was good too, but I could have eaten more than just ONE tiny piece of it on the plate.  My husband decided on the Roy's Trio (Hibachi Grilled Salmon - Misoyaki ""Butterfish"" - Roasted Macadamia Nut Crusted Mahi Mahi). When they brought it out to him I almost laughed at the portion size. For like $33 I was expecting a full entree, but the plate was one of those long rectangular 3-compartment tasting dishes.  Each compartment contained a very small piece of fish, likely not more than 2 oz. per piece.  He had ONE tiny baby potato on his plate (more of a garnish) and ONE tiny piece of baby bok choy in another compartment (again, more of a garnish). He said the Mahi Mahi was mushy and absolutely tasteless. He thought the Butterfish was okay, but he too thought the grilling sauce was off-putting.  The salmon was apparently the best of the three and that's pretty sad considering he isn't even a salmon cheerleader. Luckily, the saving grace was the chocolate lava cake for dessert. It was great. For almost $160 (before tip) for the two of us, I would have expected an AMAZING meal, but alas, it was not.",0.8957,0.762,0.128,0.11,0.6105714285714285

On another note, having been to Hawaii many times and eating everywhere from little hole in the wall places to 5 star restaurants, the menu didn't even resemble anything other than a boring steakhouse/seafood restaurant made for unadventurous Americans.  Hawaiian cuisine is a mix of aesthetically pleasing, colorful, generally sweet island cuisine with some Japanese/Asian influence.  If you like to order a steak, but also want to pretend you're eating another culture's food without actually having to, this is the place.   I don't deny that their food is good looking - it just didn't seem ""Hawaiian.""  If you want someone to bend you over and feed a steak to you ass-first, and then empty your expense account all over the floor, try Mortons.  If you want to try something legit, Baltimore has a lot of other places to offer.",0.9145,0.87,0.088,0.042,0.48263888888888895

My wife and I are both vegetarians and we split an order of the tofu steak. They were nice enough to split the order for us so we didn't have to go through the hassle of splitting it up on our own. They also comped our dessert which was a great gesture. Our servers name was Julio and he made sure everything we ordered was vegetarian and that we had a great time.

Lol  And still, Valet met us with umbrellas and a smile. But let me back up, we asked for a specific accommodation online at OpenTable as we made our reservation, low and behold, Roy's made sure all was taken care of. Our waiter Danny, talked with us, smiled, and was super cool. Everything we asked for,  he made it happen, for example,  non-alcoholic drinks. . No problem for Danny! He made some awesome tropical concoction that pleased our palates. The food-Perfect. You'll be salavating before you take your first bite-no joke. If you have the pineapple upside-down cake, be ready for a straight mouth-gasm. The night was so awesome,  I called to thank Ashley (the manager) for having such great staff and giving us such an awesome experience.   If you don't believe me,  call Roy's,  Tiffany (the Maitre d'),  super courteous,  super sweet, might answer. If she does,  she'll set you up for a night you'll enjoy from top to bottom.  Thanks again for great food and great service. Wish i could give 5 and a half stars.

We ordered the butternut squash gnocchi appetizer (fantastic) and our cocktails- Sangria and a Manhattan, were really good.  Salads are on the smaller side but were good.  My husband's main course of scallops were wonderful. My short rib- which has always been my favorite Roy's dish- wasn't as good as in the past.  There were tomatoes on it (??) and it wasn't as tangy as usual- also the potatoes were kind of watery.   For dessert you MUST order the chocolate souffle- and don't share it!  It was absolutely fantastic as always.

2015-05-29,1.0,"I honestly have no idea how this place has more than 1 star by any reviewer.  I cant imagine they had an entirely different experience because we had several items- all of which seriously lacked.  We also noticed another couple next to us complaining about the food.  I never post on Yelp, but felt the need to warn people about this place.  If you want to spend lots of money for really sub-standard food that has been ill-prepared, then this is your place!   My boyfriend and I dined her on a Thursday night.  We sat outside which had a nice atmosphere.  Our server was fine, nothing crazy spectacular with service or ambience but adequate, had the food been up to par.  Honestly we spend $250 on a meal and I wanted to get fast food on the way home because it would have tasted better. As another reviewer stated the value for the food is a joke.  We spent $250 for two people.  The food tasted like a marginal chain restaurant.  We maybe should have spent $100- including a bottle of wine for the value. The edamame that was brought out to start was soggy.  The spices overpowered it.  I think that can be said of almost all of the dishes.  The sauces and spices sound delicious in writing but the flavor combinations are off and they don't mask the fact that the food isn't properly cooked. My sangria was ok and my boyfriend's margarita also average- not good enough for us to even order a second drink so we switched to wine we knew.   For appetizers we had the Lakanilau roll and lobster potstickers.  The potstickers could have come from any take-out Asian restaurant.  The roll however was quite good- the only worthwhile item in the lineup.  Had the roll not been good, we probably wouldn't have ordered dinner because the drinks and apps were pretty bad.  I wish we hadn't stayed. For entrée my boyfriend had a steak with truffled bacon mac and cheese.  The steak was overcooked.  The mac and cheese was also not good.  I ended up eating it just because I was hungry because my entrée was not edible.  Seriously though you have truffles, bacon, cheese and pasta.  How could that not be delicious?  It didn't have enough cheese to pasta ratio and certainly not worth the calories.  AT ALL. I ordered a combination dish with lobster, shrimp and crab cake.  The crab cake was terrible.  No real flavor.  Seriously this is Baltimore- if you can't get that right it's sad.  The shrimp were edible but nothing to write home about.  The lobster was atrocious.  It was pink in color (a light pink not a lobster pink) and rubbery.  I couldn't eat it.  The creamy jasmine rice was way too heavy on the sauce.  It had more than the mac and cheese- not right.  The flavor wasn't right on it.  It made me gag when I put it in my mouth.  We did mention the lobster and received a free chocolate dessert of some sort.  It did nothing to redeem for the meal because the food is bad, just bad.   Summary- Do not go here.  At all.  For any reason.  Save your money and enjoy someplace else- any place.",0.9845,0.791,0.129,0.08,0.5409013605442178

2015-05-12,2.0,"Roy's is like a girl who is really pretty, but actually so insecure about her looks that she feels the need to cover up all her natural beauty with layers and layers of makeup.  I took my boyfriend here for his birthday dinner, and I don't think I've ever been more disappointed at having to spend around $200 for a meal. I kept thinking about all the other things I could have bought him for his birthday besides throwing it away at Roy's. (As a caveat, the manager stopped by to ask how our time was, but we didn't mention having any issues. At the time, we just needed to sleep on it to realize what went wrong) SERVICE: I want to start off by saying that service was GREAT. The bartender was really nice and the drinks were pleasantly strong, but tasty. Our server at the table was TAMMY, who was incredibly personable and seemed genuinely excited about all the dishes on the menu. She was also very professional and all our food came out as ordered. The birthday picture and dessert at the end was really special, and hands down, she alone is saving this from being a one-star review.  VALET: They have valet. It's 8$. The girl who parked our car was very nice.  SOFT SHELL: Ugh- Do not get this if you love soft shells and treasure their delicate, tender nature. Definitely do not get this if you have never tried soft shells because it will turn you off of them for life. The breading was so thick and covered up any inkling of crab taste. Think 85% breading, 15% crab. Then, the actual pieces of crab we could taste were gritty, mealy and really fishy. For $22- not worth it. Even at $8, it wouldn't be worth it.  AHI POKE: Another one of Chef Matt's creations. (Maybe steer away from those and stick with the regular menu because this one and the soft shell were just off). I'm from Hawaii so as soon as I saw the word ""poke,"" I jumped at the opportunity to get it. What a disappointment. The tuna was chopped in small pieces (I was hoping for much larger chunks- at least that's what I grew up with), and the marinade of ""nut jus"" gave the tuna a skunky flavor and incredibly oily texture. It was served over this wasabi mayo that my boyfriend described as tasting like gasoline.  RIBEYE: Probably our favorite dish. Really buttery, tender, and they nailed the medium-rare temperature. The steak was well seasoned and every bite was heavenly. The bacon-mac on the side was not memorable and not too flavorful.  TRIO: I switched out the butterfish and instead got the ahi tuna. The tuna itself was delicious, but it was covered with this blackened seasoning that tasted like sandy burnt chalk, and the tuna was sitting in a pool of mustardy sauce. The fish was completely overwhelmed. The mahi mahi in the center was a little dryer than I'm used to, but again, it was drowning in a sweet pumpkin like sauce. The salmon on the end was really flaky and buttery, but was in a sour shio-like sauce. The portions were about average, but overcompensating by drowning perfectly delicious fish in sauce made me not want more.  SIDES: The green beans had chinese sausage (yum), but were REALLY SPICY so beware. The fried rice was really mediocre and had a hint of kimchee spice.  CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE: Really chocolately, crispy outside, overall satisfying. PINEAPPLE UPSIDE DOWN CAKE: Definitely order this! My favorite out of what I ordered. The edges were crispy and tasted like melted butterscotch and the inside was so fluffy, warm, and soft. A few of my bites tasted like baked ham, but maybe it's because they use the same oven?  PRICE: With tip, our meal was $200. That's A LOT to pay for subpar food. I also paid a separate tab at the bar- around $30 for two cocktails. And then the valet was $10 with the tip. So this was a $250 venture that was a giant WASTE OF MONEY. I know that Roy's recently changed hands, so maybe that's why the food tasted like it came from a bad cookie cutter chain, but the high premium price is just NOT WORTH IT.  OVERALL: Will we ever back? Not likely. Do I wish I had a time machine so that I could go back in time and stop myself from making this horrendous mistake? Definitely. We had a really disappointing time in terms of food- all the perfectly prepared proteins were smothered in strange sauces and it was all so ridiculously expensive. We still had lots of laughs and the service was wonderful, but for the price, I'm expecting to at least be satisfied.",0.9988,0.751,0.182,0.067,0.495736499109993

Kimchi had a funny tin taste to it. The firm soft boiled egg with a crust was good. It tasted like a $15 plate.

We showed up 25 minutes early for our reservation and the host said it would be more around our 7:30pm reservation, we were seated at 7:50pm. Even with never leaving the hostess station, I was asked 4 times if I had been helped, sad that your hostesses can't remember who they talked to and even sat one couple who came in after us before seating us. Also, why is the coat room with an out swinging door in front of the hostess/waiting area? This caused people waiting to constantly be moving around to try avoiding being in the way. In the result causing a lot of unnecessary confusion.  Once we were seated in the dining room, it was a much more peaceful area, though I had a hard time seeing the menu since the lighting was so dim and the only light source was that of the wine cellar behind us.

It's only Til 7 and bar seating is limited to get there early!

2015-01-10,5.0,"Preface, this review is from an event standpoint. We just had our wedding reception dinner here and couldn't be happier with our choice. From the beginning planning to the end of the meal, entering was perfect.  We started looking for a restaurant in September to host a reception dinner of around 35 people and found Roy's. Merritt was the coordinator we were placed in contact with and she was such a pleasure to work with. We came in to see the different rooms and taste the food. As soon as we started eating the sushi, we were sold. Everything was prepared right in front of us and was absolutely delicious.  Plans changed with the time of the meal, from a late lunch to a dinner time, and with the number of purple, from 35 to 70. Merritt didn't even flinch and accommodated our changes without hesitation. She was extremely helpful in finalizing the menu and ensuring that our dietary restrictions were incorporated. All of the details were handled, such as table arrangements, printing custom menus, and accommodating our cakes being dropped off. The day of the reception, everything went perfectly. I appreciated so much that I didn't have to worry about anything with our guests arriving before us. The cakes were set up on our serving trays, wine was offered, and appetizers gradually came out over time. The entrees all looked amazing, which I had the Mahi Mahi and that was phenomenal. I didn't hear anything but rave reviews on all of the food, including the dessert trio, which came out with cookies that were so fresh out of the oven, the chocolate chips were still melted. Oh and on top of that, we were only charged for those who showed up to the reception, which for a wedding means a lot, especially during flu season. Overall, I couldn't be happier with our experience from start to end. We would absolutely recommend them to anyone looking for an event dinner and will be returning ourselves to celebrate our anniversary next year.",0.9683,0.86,0.107,0.032,0.5966165413533835

This wasn't ideal.  Anyway, when we first got there for our 5:00 reservation, there weren't too many people in there. So WHY did the hostess want to take us to a table/booth (what I call the half booth, half table situation) RIGHT next to a baby. A baby that was crying at the time. It put us in an awkward position, as I had to tell her to about face and move us to another table. Why with a very open restaurant, would you do that?  So we were sat at a booth near the kitchen, which was ok. We could see the servers hanging out and that was less than ideal, but they weren't being loud or obnoxious, so it wasn't too bad.  The meal starts with delicious, fresh edamame. SO GOOD! We skipped drinks, as we had a date at the Meyerhoff right after and decided to do our drinking there. I ordered the mac and cheese as an app. I loved it! This was the perfect blend of cheeses! The truffled breadcrumbs on top were perfect!  For my meal, I went with scallops. Scallops and pork. It looked like a tiny portion, but it was extremely filling! It was flavorful and worth every penny. They recommend you get the scallops medium, and that worked for me. Such perfection on a plate!  For dessert, we ordered the eggnog creme brulee and could not have been more pleased! It was creamy and delicious and not too sweet.  The service, with the exception of the hostess stand, was excellent.  Minor things that I didn't like, but the food was great, so I can sweep all that to the side. I definitely want to get back ASAP.",0.9976,0.742,0.22,0.038,0.5969387755102041
2015-01-03,5.0,"Roy's is a go-to spot for me and my foodie partner.  We have actually never sat down for a dinner in the dining room but we have gone to their happy hour like 25 times lol.  It's the best happy hour in Baltimore!  The Hawaiian martini is one of the BEST drinks I've ever had.  It's very busy on Fridays, especially if the weather is warm.  Slows down a bit in the winter.  Good note:  They have a Saturday happy hour, which few places do in Baltimore.  They change the hh menu seasonally so check out the website before you go!",0.993,0.679,0.321,0.0,0.5476984126984126
2014-12-23,2.0,"I'm shocked to see so many excellent reviews of this place. I recently took my parents here in hopes for a nice meal and, while I will admit the food was good, I was shocked at the prices! I've had MUCH better and MUCH MORE for far lower prices than this. In terms of the atmosphere, it seems like a great place to take a date that you feel the need to impress. The lighting is dim and it's relatively quiet. However, for anything other than a date night it just seems silly...there was one woman at a table nearby using a cell phone flashlight to read her menu! No need to dim the lights that much, folks. The service was excellent and very fast, but I was a little surprised when the waitress clarified in front of me what ""medium rare"" means for steak. No real concerns about it...just seemed odd especially in a place where that stupid steak was costing me $30.  In terms of the Hawaiian Fusion concept, I wasn't impressed. While there were plenty of interesting fish items on the menu, I didn't find that the majority of the menu stuck to the concept all that well. After all, I got a bone-in rib eye that came with a side of truffled mac and cheese. My Dad got Roy's Trio (which, his name being Roy, he cracked a MILLION jokes about) and it included mahi-mahi...but that was about as ""Hawaiian"" as I felt it got there. Finally, my Mom ordered the scallops, which came with pork belly and the tiniest salad I've ever seen. Again, the food was all good. But I'm talking like MAYBE $20 a plate good. And for my meal that personally feels like a stretch. My mom couldn't get over that she was paying $10 per scallop. Each of the portions in the Roy's Trio were also alarming small. My meal came with a substantial rib-eye, but overall I wasn't impressed. I didn't think it was cooked as perfectly as plenty of steaks I've had in much cheaper venues. Overall, I would really not recommend this place to anyone other than a guy trying to impress a girl with his wallet. Food was good, service was good...but the price tag is WAY above what either was actually worth.",0.9827,0.775,0.15,0.075,0.5770542635658916
2014-12-20,5.0,"Roy's is the famous Hawaiian fusion restaurant that has been a staple of Harbor East before it settled on the name Harbor East. We parked in the (quite reasonable for Harbor East) parking garage under the Four Seasons and walked across the street Roy's for dinner on a Friday night. It was 6:30 and the place seemed pretty full, at least the bar area we could see. Part of the bar faced onto the kitchen, a must for foodies looking for a show (their happy hour deals looks very good.) Our seat in the dining room had a view of the bar, which added a lively atmosphere to the entire meal. Our enthusiastic server offered us a cocktail form a large list but we opted for wine from their extensive list and a Guinness. We started with a Beef Short Rib Bi Bam Bap, which had tender and tangy meat served over tender seasoned rice with a perfect fried egg on top to mix in. I found it rather rich for an appetizer, but a wonderful dish to share around the table. We also ordered a sampler that included five of the appetizers. Most everyone at the table agreed they were all excellent, although I found the spring roll fresh and crisp but not overly flavorful. I did quite enjoy the lobster potstickers  and the Sczechuan ribs were cooked perfectly. For an entree I ordered the macadamia crusted mahi mahi, which I gather is a signature dish at Roy's, but offered me the only real miss of our dinner. The crust was much lighter and flakier than I expected, but perhaps it roasted so long in the oven that it dried out faster than I could eat it. It tasted fine enough to start, but by the end there was almost no moisture to the fish. My wife's braised short ribs were tender and sublime, absolutely perfect. Our friend ordered Roy's Trio, which included the mahii mahi as well as salmon and butterfish. The butterfish was the real star, incredibly super tender and one of the best things we had tasted yet. Somehow we found room for dessert, enjoying the pineapple upside down cake with coconut ice cream, and a semi-molten chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream. The chocolate cake was good, but the coconut ice cream complemented the other one magnificently. Roy's is great, and we can't wait to try their happy hour, and as much as they specialize in seafood, they really know how to prepare meat. They really know how t o make you want to go back.",0.9986,0.784,0.208,0.009,0.5732109788359789

2014-11-14,5.0,"I'm not usually too keen on chains, but Roy's Restaurant, or at least the Baltimore branch, is fantastic. When you set foot inside Roy's you can expect delicious food and excellent service. The hosts, wait staff, and busers are all pleasant, polite, and helpful. The dishes I tried and really enjoyed: Big Island Ahi Poke (a special creation by Roy Baltimore's chef Matt) Misoyaki ""Butterfish"" First thing, I would encourage you to try one of chef Matt's special creations because these dishes are unique to this particular location and illustrate the resident chef's strengths. The ahi poke was prepared with avocado, wasabi sour cream, and kukui nut jus (whaaaaaa?). It was phenomenal. Luscious and the perfect balance of buttery and salty. Also make room for one of the Roy's classics, like the aforementioned ""butterfish."" This dish is prepared with Alaskan cod, marinated in teriyaki-soy glaze and accompanied by bok choy. Tom N. said they had used a more buttery, less Asian inspired sauce for the fish in the past, but that he equally enjoyed this version. We both were reminded of ca kho to, or Vietnamese caramel fish. The setting is also pretty swanky, in the more traditional sense, though not overly stuffy. I like that. Though most guests come in smart business casual outfits, people in clubbing clothes or jeans won't receive a hard stare. You can basically wear whatever you want as long as you behave. Definitely make a reservation if you plan on coming on a weekend, as there will most likely be an hour-long wait for a table.",0.9982,0.712,0.283,0.005,0.5589105339105338

2014-09-02,1.0,"Wife and I were going to enjoy Roy's again to celebrate another anniversary and a night away from the kids. Our previous experiences (10+) have been great.  We made our reservations for 8pm Friday night. We arrived 10 minutes early and had a drink at the bar.  One drink turned into 2 drinks turned into a 40 minute wait and seating at 8:30.  I joked to my wife, here come the lobster wontons as a free appetizer.  I was wrong.  Instead of the wontons, we received the calamari (it was very good).  We ordered the aloha sushi roll, tuna for me, misoyaki black cod for her, and two chocolate soufflés as we can't share.  Last visit, I ordered the scallops (which are great), but 3 total scallops is just not enough. Sushi was great and I'd get it again. My tuna was excellent. I like the tang of the soy mustard sauce with the mellow taste of the tuna.  My wife had the black cod.  I've had it before and it is very good.  Not this time, her first bite brought a look of disgust. I warned her about ordering a cold water fish in the summer- they're going to be small and not the thick chunks you get in the winter.  She had the tail end piece of the fish and she didn't like it one bit.  I tasted it and it was fishy and very sweet.  Too much of the grey fat on it for her liking.  I told her to send it back and she refused.  If she did, I probably would have run away in shame.  Anyway, we ended up swapping plates and I sucked it up for the team.  I'm not thrilled because I think that stinky fish may have ruined my chances of dining at Roy's again.  Dessert was awesome with the chocolate soufflé.   Now, my big complaint.  Our server was absolutely terrible.  We ordered drinks and the appetizer appeared before our drinks arrived.  That's fine, but when we finished the plate we don't need to hear a comment. ""wow- you guys aren't playing around"".  I felt like saying, we've been waiting 40 minutes for our reservation- yes, we're hungry.  I also like that every other table around us received the bowl of edamame, but us- the starving people in the middle.  To add insult, the server forgot to put in the soufflé until  we finished our dinner. So yes, we had another 20 minute wait until it arrived.  This guy couldn't get it right.  I don't know if it was a late night for him or we were in a bad area for his serving section, but we were left alone most of the night with empty wine glasses.  The simple things alluded this server.",0.6596,0.761,0.124,0.114,0.5261964285714285

2014-07-20,3.0,"We arrived looking for the valet parking we read about and, not seeing a ""valet parking"" sign or valets anywhere in front we drove right by Roy's and continued on to a valet parking sign that turned out to be for Flemmings.  There they told us to make a U-Turn and go back to Roy's.  I felt kind of dumb until I found out that our friends did the same thing.  So my first message to Roy's is to invest in a valet parking sign so your customers don't have drive around an already congested circle to find your valet service.  That said, $8 valet parking is appreciated. Our server was very nice (""fabulous"", to use her favorite word) and was very knowledgeable of the menu and very efficient in her service.  She kept the table clean and approached us with a frequency that made us feel well taken care of but not bothered.  She was a positive. As for the meal, it was just okay.  The drinks were good, but very pricey.   I had the pork Osso Buco ($25) and it was just okay.  The pork shank portion was small.  It was tender but had no particular spice or flavoring.  There was a spattering of a tasty dark brown sauce - not enough sauce IMO.  The shank was surrounded by small chewy cubes of well done pork along with tasty grilled brussell sprouts.  All of this was served over a pool of red pepper polenta that was again pretty bland and somewhat chunky (I'm not knocking it for this, but if I'm having creamy polenta I prefer it to be more like creamy grits).  The dish was not terrible, just not flavorful or memorable.  Overall though it was a let down and there was nothing Hawaiian about it other than the shank was pork instead of veal. My wife had the petite filet and butter poached lobster ($35).  The filet was good and cooked MR as she requested.  The lobster was half a chick served in-shell with no claw.  She certainly could have asked, but she was expecting the lobster to be out of the shell and the meat actually poached in butter which sounded mouthwatering.  But it looked like the lobster was grilled first and then just topped with a buttery sauce.  The lobster itself was tasteless and not quite cooked all the way.  Lobster is supposed to be sweet and succulent and this poor creature was neither.  She had some sort of potato side on the plate that was tasty but I don't have the details on that, only that I enjoyed the bite that I had. The one dish that shined was our friend's Ahi ($32, I think).  It was served seared (raw inside) with a wasabi-type sauce.  I had a bite of it and immediately wished I had ordered it.  The tuna was fresh and melted in my mouth.  I don't have any additional details about the dish other than our friend thought it was a great meal and the bite I had tasted really, really good. Our other friend ordered a sampler-type dish ($?) which was three small portions.  I don't really have much info on this other than she seemed to enjoy it.  She didn't rave over it, but she did say it was tasty and well executed. For sides ($7 to $9) we got the lobster mac and cheese and kimchi.  The mac was very tasty, spiral pasta noodles in a bechamel like sauce, however, there were no chunks of lobster or even a lobster flavor, just some chunks of bacon.  It was good, but I would have never guessed it was ""lobster"" mac from the flavor.  The kimchi was just okay, too many carrots and not enough cabbage.  Four of us were sharing it and half of it was still left when we were done. The balance of our check was cocktails.  Our friends had the signature pineapple martini-type drink before the meal arrived and liked it.  I had two Kirin beers with dinner and my wife and our friends had glasses of chardonnay to start and then ordered a bottle.  To finish two of us had TF 20-year port and my wife had a chocolate/chambord martini-type drink and our other friend a coconut/pineapple martini-type drink.  I tasted the drinks and they were both very good.  This is kind of where they get you because the cocktails I believe were around $12 or $14 each and the glasses of wine were $17 each.  I'm not sure how much the bottle of wine or my beers cost, but the $17 glasses of wine made the price of the meal balloon quickly.  We did drink more than usual but our bill, with a $25 off coupon wound up to be over $150 per couple. All in all the experience was good but the food just okay - and isn't that the main reason one would return to a restaurant?  The service was excellent, the drinks good (although overpriced IMO).  One other thing is that I can't say that I left with a big impression that the cuisine was ""Hawaiian fusion"" - there was nothing overly Hawaiian about anything.  For the food, the tuna dish was the standout, the sampler was very good, but the pork and surf & turf were lacking flavor and personality.  For what it cost I honestly can't say that we would return.  If I did go back, I would get that tuna dish for sure.",0.9991,0.826,0.153,0.021,0.49957780902225357

2014-07-01,5.0,"I'll admit, I was a little skeptical at first. I had no idea what exactly Hawaiian fusion was. Plus some of the other reviews weren't so great, but others were and so were personal friends experiences so I was excited to go on a date night with my lady. It was very easy to find, and there is valet parking in front for $8, which is probably much easier than trying to find parking on your own. Inside the front desk staff was very friendly, and since we had made reservations they took us right to our table. I do love the decor of this place. The color scheme and lighting is quite pleasant. I ordered one of the Kona Lagers to start and they brought out edamame complimentary. For an app I tried the vegetable spring rolls which was about $8 and came with three, paired with an interesting sauce I'm still debating on if  liked or not. For now we'll say 6.5/10.  For an entree I debated between the californian white sea bass vs the roasted macadamia nut crusted mahi mahi. While the sea bass was a limited time item, the mahi mahi has been on the menu since the place opened, a classic and staple of the place so I went with that. Best decision ever. It was cooked perfectly, and the lobster sauce it was served in was delicious, as were the potatoes and asparagus. I also ordered a side of the truffle bacon mac n cheese, which was a much different take on mac n cheese, but it was quite possibly the best side I've ever ordered. The service here was excellent, and the bathrooms were well maintained. The bar seemed to be extremely popular during happy hour.

The lobster dim sum was amazing and the sauce was even better- we just wished there was more.

Our waitress, Amanda, also brought out a pretty ice cream and fruit dessert for my birthday and took a picture of my boyfriend and me for the birthday picture frame from the restaurant. She also didn't charge for my cappuccino because it took a while to come out.  Overall, Roy's had fantastic food and outstanding service.",0.9951,0.776,0.224,0.0,0.6459415584415585
2014-06-22,4.0,"I came back for dinner and can still attest that Roy's is four stars. The restaurant mixes classic techniques with Pacific flavors. From start to finish, I enjoyed a very nice meal in the heart of Baltimore.  We started off with misoyaki butterfish lettuce wraps in a vinaigrette sauce, shallots, and cucumbers. The butterfish was delicately flavored. I ordered seared sea scallops in a potato purée with pork belly, fennel, apple, and honey coriander glaze. The scallops were perfectly seared, the pork belly was good, and in the honey coriander glaze and potato purée, the entree was fantastic and well-executed.  Of course, my favorite - the chocolate soufflé. We knew we wanted that as soon as we sat down, so we ordered it while ordering our appetizers. Therefore, once we finished our entrees, the chocolate soufflé came right out. A classic melting hot chocolate souffé dusted in powdered sugar, served with a delicious raspberry sauce, with a side of vanilla ice cream. The hot chocolate center oozed magically into the raspberry sauce, making it the most perfect dessert concoction.  Service was top notch. Our server, Ashley, was attentive and friendly. No lag or wait time and our drinks were always replenished without asking. If you're looking for a more upscale dinner, definitely try out Roy's!",0.9866,0.817,0.164,0.02,0.6440806878306878
2014-06-20,4.0,"Came back for a second time and I must say, things were different.  Not the service, because that was still stellar, but the food was much better on all fronts except for one small issue about the Short Rib, which I will delve into in just a bit. 1st)  Started off with an Off-the-Menu item which starred a seared and crusted sea scallop on top of a gochujang vinaigrette, with a Korean inspired butter lettuce wrap with house made kimchi, smoked mushrooms, and pork belly.  The scallop was perfectly seasoned and extremely tender.  The vinaigrette went with the scallop very well as the acidity cut through some of the brininess of the seafood while not the attention away from the scallop.  The slight kick from the gochujang tied it together very well.   The wrap was very refreshing, yet still very hearty.  The blend from the crispness of the butter cabbage with the pork belly and smoked mushrooms played very well off each other.  These smoked mushrooms were no joke as they were packed full of smoked flavor that heightened the earthiness of the mushroom.  To help balance this dish more and as a part of a tradition of this dish, the kimchi was lightened up everything with its sourness.  This was a great start. 2nd)  From the menu; Shabrinas Spicy Snow Crab Roll.  Because my wife is pregnant, this was offered without the raw tuna on top and due to this, it could of been just slightly better.  With that being said, I guarantee this roll would be a 10/10 because it was still very good without it.  The snow crab was mixed with a spicy sauce of sort, but the crab flavor was still very pronounced.  The spiciness, as the menu calls, was there.  The sauces were sweet and savory and married well with the spicy interior to tone it down just a bit.  Since there was no tuna on ours, all the sauces made the roll just a bit too much on the soggy/mushy side as there was avocado in there too to give it a natural buttery-ness to it.  If the tuna was there on top, it would of been perfect, as the raw tuna would of added a second platform for the sauce and assist with the texture.  The finely diced cucumbers also played its roll by adding a nice snap to the bite.  Very delicious roll. 3rd)  Hibachi Grilled Salmon and Glazed Sesame Short Rib.  These are menu items and I prefer one over the other.   Normally, I'm not a fan of salmon at all if it's not in its rare state because establishments tend to dry it out from overcooking since it's not a fatty fish.  But here... not quite so.  The fish was moist and cooked just enough to where it was done and not raw.  It was flaky.  It was sweet and acidic from the ponzu sauce and bed of pickled veggies.  Great umami flavor.   I would definitely eat this again.  However, I'm not so sure with the Short Rib as I feel it fell just slightly... short.  The braised short rib had great hearty flavors and was mostly fork-tender as I could easily pull the meat apart, which is always a great sign.  However, parts of the upper portion was indeed dry and I suspect that the culprit was a sear.  I found myself searching for more of the wine sauce to sop up because of this.  All in all, this was my only gripe.  It was served with a cloud of fluffy buttery whipped potatoes with asparagus and bearnaise sauce.   4th)  Duo of Pineapple Upside Down Cake with Roasted Coconut Ice Cream and Chocolate Souffle with Vanilla Ice Cream.  Boy.... Both sides are freaking great.  The pineapple cake goes so well with the coconut ice cream.  If you put a little bit of both on the spoon, it becomes a luau party for your taste buds.  You couldn't ask for a better marriage.  The cake was moist with chunks of pineapple.  It also seemed as though the pineapples were torched to the finish because it was slightly snap/crunch.  The coconut ice cream had strips of roasted coconut that added texture and made it all more coconuty-er.   Same as last time, the chocolate souffle was a hit.  However, the center was much more oozy.  It was very nice.  Rich dark chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream when you need to take a break. I actually rate this restaurant 4.5. Next time, I'm bringing friends.",0.9991,0.808,0.168,0.024,0.45586929330831766
2014-06-13,5.0,Went to dinner here with my boss and coworkers. It was wonderful! All the appetizers that were served were great. Their sushi is quite good but I would'n get sushi here as the main entree. There are many other better sushi places around here. I got the Misoyaki Butterfish. Oh it was SO good!! I almost didn't order it because one of the coworkers said it was extremely fishy and she wasn't a fan. Maybe it's cuz I'm Asian and I've tasted way fisher things haha I'm very used to that and this honestly was not fishy at all to me. This fish was super tender and flaky. The sauce they had on the side was amazing and the jasmine rice was great too! They covered in these poppy seed looking like things and it just added so much unique flavor to the rice! They had some kind of wasabi sauce over the 2 little bok choy's they gave us which was alright but I inhaled a huge amount of wasabi by accident. almost died but.... it was refreshing at the same time LOL. One of them got Ahi Tuna which was great!  The famous chocolate souffle was great as well ;) very chewy on the outside and gooey and chocolately on the inside. I really want to come back to try that Pineapple upside down cake everyone raves about.  The price here is very steep for the amount of food that they provide for you. I know some people will think it's crazy and I honestly probably wouldn't go there unless someone was taking me there on a date or whatnot ;) Overall it was a wonderful experience and I would love to go back to try some other dishes ;),0.9979,0.7,0.26,0.039,0.595568783068783

2014-06-02,3.0,"Came here with a friend last night for dinner.  Had really good reviews, and the pictures looked very nice, so I wanted to try this place.  She's allergic to shellfish, would turned out to be a reason for the 3 stars. First, the atmosphere.  It was a very nice atmosphere, not loud at all which was a definite plus.  A perfect place to take a sig other for date night.  There was a ""candle"" on our table, that I thought was a candle, so I carefully set it aside so we could have space in the middle to share our meals.  I opened the cover to see if it was in fact a candle, but it was just a blinking light bulb.  Thought that was rather tacky, but I'm not going to deduct stars for that.  5 stars. Second, the server.  He greeted us immediately upon seating, which was nice.  But then disappeared for a while.  When he finally came back, he asked us if we were ready to order.  I figure for a restaurant of this apparent caliber, he'd at least ask us if we were interested to hear about the specials, but he was just ready to take the order.  So I piped up and said my friend was allergic to shellfish, and what would he recommend.  He stated what his favorites were, and my friend and I were like is this guy serious because we read the ingredients list of the meals and they all contained shellfish.  We had to remind him on several recommendations that she was allergic to shellfish so she couldn't have that meal.  Even in his recommendation spiel, he mentioned several different types of shellfish!  Thought this was rather bizarre, because that's usually Server 101 to not mention meals with a patron's stated allergen.  He clearly was just reciting things off of memory rather than really considering our needs in each dish.   I figured he was of no help so I just said, please give us a few more minutes.  So I went directly to Yelp and checked out meal tips and landed on a couple that were without shellfish.  I was more miffed by this experience with the server than she was, mainly because I have worked as a server before.  1 star. Third, the food.  We ordered a sushi roll for appetizer, the Sunrise at Haleakala Roll, and the Braised Short Ribs and Roy's Trio, without the lobster cream sauce, for entrees. Sunrise at Haleakala Roll:  It was bland, and the sauce it was placed on top of wasn't very flavorful as well.  I don't like depending on soy sauce for flavor with my sushi rolls, but that's what I had to do.  The crispy asparagus was probably the only positive about this.  It might be because we had just gone to a sushi restaurant for lunch, and tasted the greatest roll I've ever had.  But that's in another review.  2 stars. Braised Short Ribs:  If you are Korean, then the ribs basically tasted like .  The sauce and mashed potatoes made this meal, and it was very good.  Definitely a dish I'd rec if you come here  4 stars. Roy's Trio:  Besides the fact the portion size was for ants, it was okay.  Just okay.  Since we didn't go with the lobster cream sauce, the Mahi Mahi was placed on top of a red potato.  Very bland, and probably would have been delicious with the sauce, but since we didn't have it, it was bland.  The grilled salmon was pretty good, but again, the portion size was tiny.  My friend wasn't a fan of salmon, so besides a piece to try, she let me have it.  The butterfish was also pretty good.  If you are hungry, I would not recommend the Roy's Trio.  3 stars. Roy's Restaurant didn't live up to the hype, but at least I can check this place off of my list of Baltimore restaurants to try.  If I could give this place half star ratings, I'd give this place 2.5 stars.",0.9988,0.798,0.175,0.026,0.5219520202020203
2014-05-28,3.0,"This place is  a chain, with chain-like atmosphere and over attentive chain-like service. While we are usually opposed to chain restaurants, we decided to give this a shot because we had received a $50 gift card to the Outback group (of which Roy's is a part) and because Living Social was offering a $20 coupon. Despite our deals, we still paid nearly $100 out of pocket. It was definitely overpriced and I don't think the cost was worth it.  We were really pleasantly surprised about the food! We started with the calamari.  I had the spicy seafood hot pot at the recommendation of our server and it was delicious! I would order this to-go if I could! They also provided and replenished deliciously seasoned and complimentary edamame. If I was rating just on food, it would have been 4.5 stars... but experience is pretty critical to us. We were asked to order dessert before our meal was served. I understand that some of your desserts need more time to cook, but I have absolutely no interest in deciding if I want dessert before I eat my meal.

For my main course I ordered the Roy's Trio which had a small sample of three different fish selections.  The fish was very good (though the Mahi Mahi was over cooked) my complaint was that the plate was all fish with very little vegetables on the side. For dessert we enjoyed the Pineapple Upside Down Cake with Coconut ice cream, the Chocolate Souffle, the Creme Brulle, and my daughter's ice cream sundae -- all were out of this world fabulous.

For appetizers, we had the lobster potstickers and the vegetable spring roll.  Both were incredibly unexciting if not outright unimpressive, with the best part of the potstickers being the miso butter sauce and the spring rolls fairly plain and easily mistaken for frozen food.   For our dinner entrees we had the grilled fillet mignon and the misoyaki butterfish--which our server strongly recommended. The butterfish was alright, though the sauce wasn't all too special and the furikake rice was a bit strongly seasoned.    No notable remarks about the steak--it was cooked accurately--medium rare, but lackluster in flavor.    Fortunately, the dessert was the saving grace.  We ordered the chocolate souffle which was rich and nicely accompanied by vanilla ice cream and raspberry sauce.  I'd definitely recommend the souffle for dessert, at least.  Other than that, Roy's had a nice atmosphere and good service.  I appreciate the more creative offerings the chain and found the meal okay, but probably not worth another visit.

We had a reservation but when we arrived we waited a good 20 min to be seated and we had our son with us this time and he was just about a year so putting him down would have been chaos. So I did what any parent would do and held him in my arms for the wait. Once seated we ordered drinks and they came pretty fast. We made our orders for dinner and waited over an hour for our food. Now you might be asking why 5 Stars if it was this bad well here's why. We really hate to complain however before our food came out the restaurant manager came over and apologized for the wait and offered us free drinks on the house. However being the type of people we are we declined but thanked her for her concern. Once our food came it was really good. For dessert we were brought out a huge boat shaped plate of desserts with everything they had but the one I ordered. I mentioned it to the waitress and she promptly brought out the dessert I ordered. At this point the manager came back with our bill. As she handed it to my fiancé she informed us that our $200 bill was taken care of by the restaurant and she apologized again. As well they have an event every few Saturdays for children and comped that for us to bring back our son. I was very impressed that they hold themselves to such a standard they didn't even give us a chance to say anything they addressed it before we could.

2013-10-05,3.0,"Sorry people, but I was not impressed with Roy's. In fact, no one in our party would go back. Now, I love good food and the food here was good, but I go out to eat because I am hungry. There were 6 of us and we all left hungry after spending $135 plus tip per couple. However, if you are OK with spending a lot of money for 15 bites of food then by all means, visit Roy's.  Let me give you an example: Got an appetizer California roll $9. Then a meal featuring Butterfish. It was a tasty piece of marinated Cod approximately 2"" x 5"" long. It came with a tiny flavorful chewy piece of Bok Choy that looked more like a garnish then a veggie side dish. Then there was the small tasteless, dry, triangular shaped, clump of white rice. This dish cost $35. My sangria was $10 and my Chocolate Souffle was $11.  I realize that on print this looks like a lot of food. You may think my appetite should have been satisfied. You may even think that I am some huge pig that requires a trip to an all you can eat buffet. But, I can assure you that the portions were small enough to have left my 5'2"" 118 lb body still longing for nourishment.  So, although Roy's food was prepared well, I will not be visiting them again. I am the sort of diner who enjoys an even balance between money spent and fullness of tummy.

The person I spoke with on the phone was incredibly polite and friendly, and I received a follow- up email confirming the reservation. I explained that we'd be celebrating a moms night out, and when we arrived, the table was decorated with ribbon and there were little cards that said ""enjoy your moms night out!""  Our server did a very good job and the food was delicious! I ordered a sushi roll with lobster, crab and Waygu beef -- hands down the best sushi roll I've ever had!! For my entree, I ordered the surf and turf (lobster and filet). My filet was a little overdone, my server brought me a new one out promptly and they bought my dinner for the trouble -- which really wasn't necessary since my second filet came out cooked perfectly, but a very nice gesture all the same.  The only small inconvenience was that they don't do separate checks, which became a little time consuming at the end.

2013-07-16,4.0,"My 2013 birthday tours rolls on to Baltimore for a trip to Roy's Restaurant.  Roy's is located in downtown Baltimore and is surrounded by several other high end restaurants and hotels including the Four Seasons and Marriott Waterfront.   Parking is extremely limited as there are very few street parking options.  There are parking lots/garages in the vicinity however valet parking is cheaper and more convenient (I believe it was $8).   Roy's has a sexy decor.  Dim lighting, dark tones, close seating arrangements, and candles on the table.  Looks like I may have to ""work"" for this meal! Service is pretty good.  There are a lot of servers racing all over the restaurant.  Our server in particular was generally attentive and knowledgeable about the menu however she was also not shy about trying to up-sell.   Roy's specializes in Hawaiian fusion cuisine.  We ordered Roy's Canoe Appetizer, Roy's Roasted Macadamia Nut Crusted Mahi Mahi, Parmesan Crusted Hake and Roy's Melting Hot Chocolate Soufflé. The complementary edamame had nice seasoning but overall it's a crappy dish IMO.  Would much rather have a bread basket. The bartenders at Roy's are quite skilled and put out some large and colorful drinks.  My fruit punch concoction had a lot of layers of flavors that worked well together.   Roy's Canoe Appetizer featured Grilled Shrimp, Short Rib Agnolotti, Shrimp Lumpia, Spicy Tempura Tuna Roll & Lobster Potstickers.  The presentation is nice although each individual component is on the small side.  On the bright side, everything was delicious.  The short rub agnolotti was very flavorful and delicate.  The spicy tempura tuna rolls was fresh and had great flavor balance.  The shrimp lumpia offered great crunch from the wrapper and packed clean flavors with each bite. Roy's Roasted Macadamia Nut Crusted Mahi Mahi was served with Maine Lobster Essence.  The Mahi Mahi came in a nice portion size and was well seasoned.  It was perfectly cooked and melted with each cut of the knife.  The freshness of the fish was evident in its taste. Parmesan Crusted Hake came with Crab Bisque and Lobster Potato Risotto.  The parmesan crust offered a great texture contrast with the crunch and the tenderness of the fish.  The seasoning on the hake was subtle yet noticeable.   The lobster potato risotto was surprisingly large for a side but was delicious.  Generous servings of lobster and potatoes that created a fantastic pairing in all aspects.  The risotto was well seasoned and was also quite creamy due to the cheese.  The potatoes offered a little crunch and starchiness that also added flavor and texture depth.  Generous amount of lobster = happy me.  Phenomenal dish! Roy's Melting Hot Chocolate Soufflé is one of their popular and signature desserts that requires you to order at the start of the meal due to how long it takes to prepare.  It's essentially a molten cake and definitely reflects high end sophistication with the execution and plating.  The chocolate flavoring is rich and intense.  Good dessert although it's not really my thing. Roy's is definitely an upscale dining experience that's worth the 45 minute-1 hour trip from the DC area.  The ambiance, service and food provide an experience that's both memorable and satisfying.  The price tag will definitely not remind you of IHOP or Applebee's but your stomach and palate will thank you later.  You could also be like me and just get someone generous to flip the bill!",0.9991,0.774,0.212,0.014,0.5699747474747475
2013-07-12,4.0,"Roy's was a tale of 2 courses. My wife and I had 2 appetizers and a main entree. First, we tried the lobster potstickers. We agreed they weren't very tasty. They didn't even taste much like lobster. For a fine dining place like this, they should have had more lobster in the potsticker and had more flavor. We also ordered auntie lai's sushi roll. It was a nice roll, but not worth $14. My wife and I love sushi and have tried many places, and this roll didn't stick out as something that should cost twice what most specialty rolls cost at our favorite places. Onto the main entree. This is where Roy's really stood out to us. I ordered braised short ribs and my wife had the fish trio. Both plates were phenominal. The short ribs were the best I have had and it was a large serving. I'm a big boy and I still thought it was big. My wife's fish was also some of the best I had tasted. The sauces went so well with the fish they were paired. As for atmosphere and service, it couldn't have been better. The wait staff was attentive but not overbearing. They were extremely polite as well. The bathrooms were exceptionally clean as was the rest of the restaurant.  The location was great. I'm not a fan of downtown baltimore, but that section is quite nice. Parking was easy on Exeter Street. We took in a movie after dinner across the street and they validated our parking, so 5 hours of parking was only $5 in a garage. All in all, Roy's was a great place for dinner and a movie date night for my wife and I. We simply suggest skipping appetizers and going straight to the main dish. Our overall bill was $120 including tax and tip, but the main entree's are well worth it for an occassional nice evening out.",0.9964,0.776,0.197,0.027,0.4917293233082706

The Lakanilau Roll (Wagyu Beef, Snow Crab, Tempura Asparagus,  Avocado, Sesame Miso, Truffled Greens) was very tasty; had a very thin shaving of raw beef draped across the top; truffled greens were and earthy foil.  The appetizer sampler disappointingly did not arrive in the promised ""canoe"", was hoping for some spectacle.  The four fried items were all right, not spectacular, kind of what you'd expect:  Shrimp Lumpia was large chunks of shrimp in a crispy shell; Crab Rangoon was fine backfin in a slightly creamy filling in a crispy shell; Lobster Potstickers were minced lobster salad in a crispy shell, Spicy Tuna Tempura Roll were 2 pieces of mild maki in a crispy shell; all came with a slightly gussied up sweet and sour sauce.   The sticky ribs were the best part, but very sweet, tasted mostly of the hoisin glaze, meat was tender and falling off the bone.  The BLT Iceberg Wedge Salad was the standard classic (seemed a little out of place in a fusion joint), but it was very good; cool, crisp iceberg, lots of bleu cheese crumbled a top, crisped thick cut bacon bits, chopped egg, ripe grape tomatoes.  Desserts were stuck in the decade of excess, as well, but were delicious.  The Melting Hot Chocolate Souffle was sufficiently oozy and chocolatey; the Pineapple Upside Down Cake was sweet with sticky fruit and a moist vanilla cake.   Flavors were well-blended, nothing was too Asian or too continental; pretty seamless melding.  Place was bustling and packed on a Friday night, service was attentive.  Price point is fairly high for the chain-like experience and quality, but might be worth it if this your idea of adventurous dining.",0.9946,0.801,0.165,0.034,0.5421758740126088

2013-05-18,1.0,"I've been to Roy's in L.A. and loved it! I've been to the one in Baltimore twice in the past two years. both times, it was crowded and noisy. If you like yelling over people  to be heard this is the place for you! I find it very unpleasant.  In my opinion, they should put up some partitions with sound absorbing material, and segregate the large parties in to another room, instead of putting them in the middle of the room!! The wait staff, both times, slow to take drink orders, slow to take meal order, and slow to refill glasses. There were two large groups - and that looked like where they were spending their time.  To start with we order the calamari. In LA it is served with a sweet chili sauce which is very good combo for fried calamari. Here they serve it with a mayonnaise sauce with a flavor I don't recognize - It was not a pleasant taste!  With out a zesty sauce the salt and pepper calamari is just bland... and a mayonnaise sauce makes it even more bland. I guess the chef is a french fries and mayonnaise kind of guy. Yuck! Would be nice to have this  fact printed on the menu.  Regarding the wait staff...  I ordered the upside down pineapple cake and my guest chocolate soufflé which Roys is known for.  When deserts came out, hers came, and then I waited for mine. 10 minutes later, the waiter was no where to be found, called over the manager-  a few minutes later he shows up ,  he says, he didn't hear me order any desert. When I order it I specifically asked him if it was gluten free, and both  I and my guest remembered him repeating our orders back to us.   He offered to place the order - but by that time we were done.  Manager never came back to check on what happened with desert.  My guest really enjoyed the chocolate souffle. They do that well.  I had the Hibachi Style Atlantic Salmon. it was well presented. The taste was not spectacular. The sauce could have been better.  The food was not as tasty as Roy's in L.A. I do not recommend this place, there are other nicer restaurants in Baltimore.",0.976,0.885,0.09,0.025,0.5027214541730671

I had the crab dynamite crusted tiger shrimp.  Again, the crab and shrimp were both over-cooked, dry and too salty.  Every mouthful was followed by a drink of water because it was the only way I could get myself to swallow. Finally, for dessert, we had chocolate bomb and chocolate chip pistachio cookies.  Chocolate bomb was served cold, but the cookie was actually surprisingly good.  At least that was warm.

Looking over the wine menu I came across a prefect appetizer champagne to complement  the lobster sushi we started with. The bottle service was fair, though the wait staff hovered off near the table some of the time and didn't pay attention to our glasses. The sushi was good, paired with fresh ginger and wasabi. I ordered a macedonia encrusted mahi mahi fillet which was paired with potato and asparagus which was decent, but wasn't too outstanding. For the cost, the dish was large; however, which is a plus in my book. Also the suggested pairing of wine from our waiter really helped to accompany the flavors of my dish.  We finished the night off with their chocolate raspberry souffle which takes 20 minutes to make so please order in advance, because it's well worth it.

The sauce tasted of raw flour, and the the dumplings were rubbery and tasteless. The braised pork shank was quintessential comfort food, and the portion was ample. The parmesan-crusted hake was great by itself, but completely overpowered by the mustardy wasabi sauce.

2013-01-05,5.0,"My husband and I went to Roy's this past Sunday for my birthday while we were visiting family in Baltimore. We absolutely LOVED IT.  Upon arrival there was curbside valet for only $8 (the parking garage around the corner would've been $17 for two hours so that was a deal). We had a reservation for 6:30, but arrived 15 minutes early so our table was not ready. We were advised that it was happy hour so we waited at the bar where we were pleased to find the cocktails for only $6. I ordered their version of a Mai Tai. (tasty!)  Upon seating we ordered the crabcakes, but a few minutes later our server returned and advised I had an outdated menu and they no longer offered them. However, since I'd been given the wrong menu she advised she would ask the chef to specially prepare one for me. A few minutes later when she came back to take our order she realized she had forgotten and advised she would not only get the crab cake but provide another appetizer while we waited. We were given the lobster potstickers, which were fabulous. (Our crab cake came out later which was also delicious and noticeably fresh.) For dinner I had the butterfish and my husband had the 3 fish platter (teriyaki salmon, butterfish, and some type of encrusted fish that we found to be rather bland). The butterfish was AWESOME! Flavor all through and the jasmine rice I found to also be good. I did have to quickly move my fish away from the wasabi because my mouth was on fire but that's not really a complaint. I got their version of a Pina Colada which was also good, but I found it had a bit too much coconut as I got closer to the bottom of the glass. Since it was my birthday, we already had cake at home and did not order dessert but they did give a small piece of chocolate cake and coconut icecream as a ""birthday gift"" and took a photo and put it in a frame.

2012-08-06,4.0,"Short version: the food was pretty good but I'm not sure if I'll go back at regular prices. If you do go, order the mahi mahi. Went here with the girlfriend for restaurant week so I'll be reviewing both plates. If I was just reviewing what she got it would be a 5 star review, if it was just what I ordered it would only be 3 stars. Appetizer: She got the watermelon salad. The flavors were good but it was literally four small bites. This would be fine on a 5+ course meal but definitely not enough food for a 3 course meal. I got the steamed buns, which were tasty. They would have been even better with sauce, which was tragically obscured by a fallen cucumber slice that landed directly on top of the sauce. Entree: She got the mahi mahi with portugese sausage. Nice portion size on the mahi mahi everything on the plate was wonderful. If I came back to Roy's this is what I would be ordering. I got the hanger steak with pommes frites. The hanger steak was excellent the pommes frites were borderline inedible. They were cut extremely thin (thinner than shoestring) and then burnt. They tasted like burnt potato chips. Dessert: We both got the chocolate torte. It was good but a little too much liquid fudge for the amount of ice cream/cake on the plate. If you like eating hot fudge out of the jar this is right up your alley. Overall a solid meal for $30.. not sure if we'll be back though at regular prices.

Came here over the weekend for Restaurant Week to celebrate 2 birthdays.  Seems like half the tables there were celebrating birthdays.  They each got a candle on their dessert, except our birthday boys.  Maybe our waitress forgot, but I told the front desk when I made the reservation, and we reiterated it to the waitress when we were ordering.   Food-wise, we all ordered from the prix-fixe menu, the Crispy Pork Bun was good, but mine only had 2 thin skimpy pieces of pork compared to others.  I got the Lemongrass Grilled Shrimp as my entree, and it was delicious.  Don't really care for the Shanghai Choy on the plate, that didn't have any flavor.  The rice onigiri sprinkled with nori and sesame was good as well.  For dessert, I got the guava strawberry tart with pistachio ice cream, there's a slight tartness from the guava, but it was perfectly balanced with the pistachio.  The other choice was the chocolate torte, that was a lot sweeter than the tart, with gooey warm chocolate oozing out from the center. They have a bar, but only have bottled beer, nothing on tap.  We got 2 beers and a mango mojito.  The Mojito had mango puree!

It was cute how the hostess greeted me with an ""Aloha"" - oh the warm fuzzies that I got.  People there were really sweet and actually pronounced  the Hawaiian words right on, so that was a plus.  I'm the kind of person who cringes when I hear people say carry-ohkey or cahrahtee.  Actually I cringe at myself when I start saying the american version of karaoke and karate because of course, people don't know what the hell I'm saying.  My boss actually likes me saying it. She likes it when I correct her when she says bentu and I say it's bento.  Anyways, went there for my bday. Fresh ahi for my sashimi, which was soo good. I had the miso butterfish, which rocked.  It was so fresh and it was melt in my mouth good. I missed home after chomping on it.   Hubby had some pork dish, I don't remember what it was but his stuff was just as good.  Chocolate souffle was to die for.  Great birthday experience there for me. You know, I'm the kind of person that if customer service sucks, regardless if the food was 5 star, you still suck. If your establishment is a shit hole dive but the food and customer service was good, hell, that's 5 stars for me.   They exuded the Aloha Spirit and trust me, when I left Hawaii, it remained there.  East coast is the land of where I am waiting at a stop sign and someone honks their horn at me because I waited there for 2 seconds.  Oh yeah, so I got a free 4x6 picture with a Hawaiian themed mat for framing.  AND a thank you card for celebrating my birthday there.  Talk about the Neiman Marcus treatment.   Good eats, knowledgeable and very friendly staff - so go there if you want some Asian fusion.   It definitely made me book a trip home for the summer.",0.9831,0.757,0.162,0.081,0.5019585253456221

Furthermore, our reservation was honored within a reasonable amount of time after our arrival, despite the fact that customers were continuously streaming in off the street and were being told that there was an hour and a half wait. I noticed at once that the air conditioning wasn't 100 percent effective. The noise level was horrendous--which makes things worse for someone with a hearing problem. In addition, there was no place to sit while waiting for our table. Also, I was really looking forward to the Hawaiian Colada but was told that, ""The machine is broken.""  Our food arrived rather quickly. No bread was served beforehand, but the waitress did give us three pieces of some kind of crouton cracker. My lady friend enjoyed the shellfish sampler, which she described as, ""Very good but not great"". My Hake was tasteless but this was compensated for by the delicious crab bisque sauce which gave the fish a nice taste and flavor.

I do not blame Roy Yamaguchi.  He does not own or have anything to do with this restaurant.  Roy sold his name and his concept to OSI Restaurant Partners years ago, so I should not have been surprised when my evening made me think of a fancy night at Outback Steakhouse.  (OSI also owns Bonefish Grill, Carrabba's Italian Grill, Flemming's Steakhouse, and used to own Cheeseburger's in Paradise.) Am I being too mean?  Not when I compare the restaurants still owned and overseen by Roy Yamaguchi to this location. Service was lacking, presentation was ok, but not perfect, and the food did little to invoke the Hawaiian Fusion ideal. It was tasty enough, but did not combine flavor and ingredients enough to invoke home.  I will say that the pineapple upside down cake was the best I've ever had. It made me wish I'd ordered it instead of the chocolate soufflé.   Oddities- the bar is strangely placed.  It is small, and tucked between the entrance and the restrooms.  The kids menu is quite nice, both in presentation and selection.   Am I sorry we visited?   No. Did it do anything to assuage my desire for a taste of home?  No.  As much as I wish it had.  No. Will I visit again?

On our first visit, we ordered our favorite sushi roll, and we're disappointed to find that what usually has wonderful amounts of fresh fish, was mostly rice and cucumber. For $15 for six pieces, I expect some fish! My entree was great, but my husband's filet was over cooked. On our second visit, we skipped the sushi. Our appetizers were fine (we went with some Baltimore only options thinking they might be better). However, both our entrees, while cooked appropriately were highly salted. It might just have been who was on the line that night, but when I am paying this much, I expect that to get straightened out. And I would have sent my meal back, but our waitress basically disappeared after dropping off the entree course, as we had already ordered dessert since the chocolate cake takes some time.

The hanger steak was devine and perfectly cooked!  I can still taste it and the chocolate souffle was more like a lava cake, but still excellent.   I did feel as if they put the dessert in the microwave to heat it up because it was burning hot and there was a lot of steam coming out of it, but it still tasted good.

2012-04-10,3.0,"My wife and I decided to come here for a fancy night out.  Roys is located in Harbor East. I say fancy because I knew this place was expensive and could hear my wallet whimpering when we walked it. It's a cool space with a bar located to your left when you walk in. We were promptly seated and given menus. Our waitress was very helpful and knowledgeable about the menu. The beer list left something to be desired but they had some good wines so I went with a white.  I did notice they had a large list of cocktails to choose from. My wife went with the sangria I believe. She said it was really quite good.  The Food: They start you out with a complimentary bowl of edamame. They were awesome. Now, when at a seafood place, go with what they are known for. We started out with the Big Island Style Poke. This was served as you would receive a tartar. The fish had a hint of soy with avocados and white rice. It was topped with fish eggs as well. It was a very light and fresh way to start the meal. I loved it. For entrees I went with the Cast Iron Seared Monkfish with Lump Crab Risotto, Bacon & Bleu Cheese Butter Sauce and my wife went with the Roy's Original Blackened Island Ahi Spicy Soy Mustard Butter Sauce.  My wife and I actually switched entrees when we got them.  The ""spice soy mustard"" sauce was like eating fire. It literally tasted like burning and I like spicy foods.  It was like getting punched in the face with a heat fist! But overall the dish was very tasty when you were ready for the heat. My second grip is that the tuna was ordered medium and there was not a speck of pink in the fish. For 30 fricken dollars for a piece of tuna, it better be prepared properly.  The monkfish was delicious and my wife crushed that dish in like 2 minutes; I barely got a bite of my own meal that I ordered.    Overall the meal was good and the service was spot on. My complaint comes back to the tuna. If you are paying that price for a place that is known for seafood, come on, medium is medium, there needs to be some pink in the middle of that tuna.   Will I come back, yes; it was probably the freshest seafood you can get in Baltimore.

2012-03-17,2.0,"I'm sorry, Roy's.  This isn't going to be kind. The husband and I decided to take a chance on Roy's after my awesome experience at the Yelp Elite event ( yelp.com/biz/elite-event… ), and I think we'll probably be back another time to try happy hour and appetizers, because really, the Yelp event was a great time. But this is about dinner. And dinner at Roy's, in my opinion, is the equivalent of a Big Mac in a Tiffany box. So what is it that bothers me about Roy's: -   Corporatespeak OMG, I hate it when it is so abundantly clear that everyone who works there has been given a script.  The server: ""Are you gentlemen still enjoying that, or may I clear it for you?""  The hostess: ""Enjoy your experience, gentlemen.""  The manager:  ""Are you gentlemen enjoying your experience?"" This sort of approach does not incline me towards enjoyment in the slightest.  It feels wholly inauthentic, and when used in the context of caring the result is the polar opposite.  All I know is that you care about the words you're saying, and I feel like I'm being managed. -  The Prices This place is expensive.  Two prix fixe menus and three drinks was $120.  Which I normally wouldn't bat an eye at, except.... -  The Utterly Forgettable Food The approach to the food is exactly the same as the approach to the language.  Roy's hits all the right notes in a perfunctory way, but any sort of love or caring behind the food is utterly absent.  I started with a grilled pear salad, on which I am certain the kitchen counted the slices of pear and number of pecans that went on the plate, and the pear was clearly under-ripe, hence missing most of its sweetness.  My salmon entree was adequately prepared, but the salmon itself was a mediocre piece of fish.  The sauteed spinach that came on the side was heavy-handed on the bacon.  And the list goes on. My husband summed it up perfectly when he said, ""This is wedding reception food."" -  The Broken Promise If you're going to cast yourself as fancy and formal - and Roy's clearly does, both in their approach to the guest, and their prices - then you'd better bring the goods.  You'd better be Charleston. Roy's is not Charleston.  Roy's is closer to Red Lobster. And here's what really annoys me:  For the $140 we spent, we could have gone to Woodberry Kitchen, where every single meal they've served me has made me gasp with enjoyment, the food is as authentic and honest as you'll find anywhere, and the staff just seem happy to see you and have never once called my dinner ""an experience.""",0.9967,0.794,0.174,0.032,0.5212347729789589

Now, back to the actual restaurant.  There's a very large bar/waiting room and coat closet as soon as you walk in the restaurant.  We were warmly greeted and waited about 5 mins before the table was ready.  For a starter I had the Big Island Style Poke. It was delicious! I grew up on a tropical island, and tuna poke was a favorite in my house.  Great citrus and tangy flavors.  I also loved that they served it with a little bit of rice.  For my entree, I had the rockfish with lobster crab risotto.  The fish was cooked perfectly.  I loved that they left the skin on.  It was nice and crispy.  As much as I enjoyed the fish, if I got this dish again I would do it for the risotto.  It was so creamy and luscious.  You could really taste the lobster and crab and bacon.  Absolutely divine!!  My husband had their scallops served on wild rice, and he said it was really good, too.  Overall, a great first experience at Roy's!

2012-03-02,2.0,"I may be a contrarian on Roy's, at least after a single visit.  It's strictly in the ""meh"" category for me - it's expensive, not terribly original, and serves food that's good-but-not-great. We started with cocktails - the Original Hawaiian Martini and the 1988.  Both were simply OK; it's an instance where they delivered kitsch flavor with elegant presentation (which seems backwards to me) We grabbed the canoe appetizer - one place where you get the kitsch presentation with the elegant food.  The tuna roll was the standout; everything else was *almost* interesting and different, but didn't take the ""Hawaiian"" far enough. For the main courses, we got the beef short rib and the seared ahi tuna.  The short rib was... a really tender beef short rib, with little flavor to differentiate it from a high-end pot roast.  The ahi tuna was perfectly executed and generally outstanding - certainly the highlight of the night. We were pretty excited about the pineapple upside-down cake for dessert; it turned out to be fresh-from-the-oven muffins with pineapple in them.  Again, a great idea executed adequately, but falling short of awesome.  Where's the damn cherry?  You can't have a pineapple upside-down cake without a cherry on it! Here's my final thought on Roy's.  If I'm paying north of $60 a head for Hawaiian fusion food, I expect to see something Hawaiian - which doesn't mean just sticking pineapple or coconut on everything.  Where's the ""slow-cooked pork wrapped in taro"" interpretation?  Where's some high-end Spam concoction?  How about a gourmet Loco Moco?  A shaved-ice cocktail?  Come on, Roy, start fusing!",0.9913,0.795,0.17,0.035,0.6246510673234812

The servers and hostesses are polite and professional and make the experience even that much more enjoyable. Their menu has something for everyone and every dish I've ever had at Roy's was nothing less than excellent and extraordinary. The last time we visited Roy's (Feb. 15, 2012), we were celebrating my mother's birthday and we pretty much ordered half the menu. Everything was phenomenal. We brought my 12 month old son and they were SO accommodating. They set us up with a high chair, a coloring book, crayons and even IMMEDIATELY (2 minutes after we sat down) brought a complimentary cheese quesadilla and veggies/dip for the young'n. They sure know what ""baby friendly"" means. They also give every table complimentary edamame. Delicious. We started with the appetizer boat for 2 (which included dumplings, pot stickers, and some sushi). We also ordered the crispy calamari and one of the lobster sushi rolls. (yes I know....a little excessive for the first course....but we do it big). The sushi rolls are not your standard 6 piece roll. I believe there were 10-12 pieces in the roll (can't remember exactly), but it was definitely a generous portion. My husband ordered the shellfish trio (scallops, lobster tail and tiger prawns). I can tell he enjoyed it because I don't think he stopped to breathe or blink until it was 100% consumed. I ordered the Roy's trio because I couldn't decide what fish to get (they all sounded delicious). My trio came on a sectioned plate with 3 small (but generous) portions of each fish, each accompanied with its own sauces. The trio was a macademia crusted mahi, a salmon in wasabi and passion fruit citrus glaze, and a butterfish. This dish was absolutely incredible and they even gave me a side of the japanese rice (my favorite). My sister ordered 3 sushi rolls (this was way too much food for just her. Like I said, the rolls were big). I tried all 3 rolls and was impressed by each (one had seared kobe beef on top. yum). My mother ordered the short ribs (which is usually my go-to at Roy's). Probably the most delicious item on the menu! I just love this dish. (I forget what my dad ordered. oops). We ended the meal with a mini chocolate souffle (on the house) for mom's birthday and we also ordered a normal sized portion. This souffle is a chocolate lover's heaven. There is a generous portion of hot chocolate that oozes from the center of a moist chocolate cake. TO DIE FOR. Very rich, but very worth it. They took a picture of all of us and put it in a Roy's frame for us....also complimentary. I think this is one of the best places in town to celebrate a birthday.

2012-02-05,2.0,"Since regretting not trying Roy's while in Hawaii a few years ago, I finally found an opportunity to try one on the mainland. I was wondering how one of the initiators of the Hawaiian fusion movement from the 80's could translate his success into a nationwide chain of well over 20 restaurants. What happens when a celebrity chef goes that big and can't monitor quality on a frequent basis? I found out the results were not good for an upscale restaurant chain. Roy must have left his culinary genius in Honolulu and in another decade. The menu was seafood centric, somewhat inventive, but seemed to cater to mainlanders rather than islanders. We were staying at the Inner Harbor and happened to coincide with Baltimore Restaurant Week (Aug 2011). The Restaurant Week prix fixe menu was akin to getting dessert free. Restaurant Week is an opportunity for a restauranteur to expose his cuisine to a broader clientele. For the appetizer, I had the Crispy Duck Leg. The flavor was that of Chinese roast duck and was quite meaty and lean. Good flavor, but not much crispy. Crispy is possible when it's roasted the same day. This was the highlight of my meal. My wife had the Roast Pork and Watermelon Salad. Watermelon was intensely red and sweet. The roast pork was somewhat dry and lacked a crispy skin. It seemed like it was made the day before and warmed over. For the entree, I had the Crab & Potato Crusted Mahi Mahi. Mostly potato with little crab. It was overdone being dry but somewhat edible; middle under the potato crust was slightly moist while the outer 20% was dry and chewy. This poor execution was EXTREMELY disappointing considering Coastal Flats in Northern Virginia is consistently good at NOT ever overcooking seafood at half the price. For red meat, when you want medium rare, most places can do that. Medium well would be a disappointment with much dissatisfaction if meat was ordered medium rare. For seafood, the cooking time is much shorter requiring attentiveness resulting in fish that is delicate, moist and succulent no matter what kind of fish (it has to be slightly underdone in the kitchen to be the correct doneness when arriving at your table). The green Thai curry underneath the Mahi Mahi was good with a slight, sweet spiciness, but somewhat toned down in the depth expected from an excellent Thai curry. The fried rice on the side was good resembling a Chinese sticky rice with chicken and sausage but with regular long-grain rice. My wife had the large shrimp, also overdone and crunchy in the wrong way. Dessert was good in a predictable, straightforward, conventional way. Creme Brulee was fine with some berries on top. The Strawberry and White Chocolate Cobbler with ice cream was fine though the white chocolate was barely noticeable under the ice cream. Cobbler was light being mostly berry without the heaviness of a country-style cobbler. My wine was a French pinot noir from Trimbach. Somewhat fruity sweetness and low acid that's inoffensive but not fully committed to depth of flavor, nose, body, or finish -- a fitting microcosm for our Roy's experience. Service was efficient, cordial and somewhat hurried. All staff encountered were friendly. When each course arrived, the server repeated the description on the menu. The noise increased noticeably as the restaurant filled to capacity. Contributing to the noise level was the open kitchen. The shouts from the sous chef and Executive Chef indicated the elevated stress level of the kitchen as the kitchen tried to keep pace with the surge of orders during the peak. Clearly, at least one of the seven line cooks was not keeping up. Since we were there for our wedding anniversary, the cute and somewhat cheesy Waikiki touch was the Roy's posterboard picture frame at the table. As dessert was served, the assistant manager came by and took a picture of us. It reminded me of my parents mid-80's visit to Don Ho's restaurant and show on Waikiki. Nice momento, but I do not like being reminded of a subpar $100 dinner for two.",0.9806,0.822,0.109,0.069,0.45246479446479443

Since it seemed like everyone who came in after us was getting sitted first. She finally asked if we wanted a drink on her. That we can go to the bar and order a drink. My boyfriend got a sangria. I got there house martini it was blah so I asked them to switch it out to a sangria which they did. Sangria was good. As we were sipping our cocktails in about 10 mins our table was ready.  As soon as we were sitted the manager brought us a free appetizer on the house. I  was not a fan of half sear raw tuna. My boyfriend seem to enjoy it. We also got free edamame sprinkled with some kind of spicy salt.  The filet was a cheap cut it had fat on it. I didn't like the fact that I was only allowed to get it medium. It was still tasty though. The mashed poblano mash was extremely tasty. The broccoli and carrots on the side were undercook and nasty.  My boyfriends mahi mahi was good and tender it had no fishy smell. Once again I wished the mahi mahi had a bit more flavor maybe even a wedge of lemon on the side. The hot sauce was literally water down hot sauce on the side. But the crab dynamite was overpowering with fish smell. The polenta tasted like bland breakfast grits very under seasoned.  Flourless chocolate torte tasted like every other restaurants hot lava cake. Nothing special. Not even the ice cream on the side was special. Next door flemmings has this wonderful vanilla ice cream from Texas I believe. The creme brulee was blah. Average creme brulee.  Other then the fine service. The food seem to lack in flavor for such a highly rated place. I am only giving 4 stars due to the service. It was extremely over packed and loud inside. My boyfriend and I could not even hear each other. So much for a romantic dinner. I understand we went for restaurant week. But seriously it was like a club inside.

Three coworkers & I managed to snag 3 of the last few bar seats at 5:10pm and waited a few minutes for the couple next to us to leave to snag one of their chairs, which a group of old hawk-like men almost stole! And they had the nerve to huff and puff about it... who knew chivalry was dead for 60 year old men too?!?! (I forgot to mention we were a group of  four women.) Anyway, I LOVE their drink menu! I've had 3 of their specialty cocktails so far... and tasted a couple of my coworkers'. My favorites are a tie between the Ginger Pineapple Mojito and the Asian Colada. Both are delicious! Not too sweet or too strong! (The Asian Colada has fresh basil... I think I really like fresh herbs in my drinks... they seem to be my favorites lol.) Anyway, tasted one coworker's mango mojito, and another's something else.. I liked both. Their signature martini (I forget the name) is a taaaad strong for my liking (please see my review of Pazo for how I feel about drink strength.)  I was not a huge fan of the 1988, which I tried on my first visit. I drank it anyway, but I wouldn't order again. Calamari is good, I don't love calamari in general, but I liked this one. Lobster potstickers were rich and delicious, especially when dragged along the plate to scoop up sauce... We had a sushi roll with crab and a slice of waygo beef on top.... I cannot remember the name but it was also quite tasty! Bryson, the GM, came over and chatted with us and gave us his card, he's great... as was our server/bartender. I barely recall hearing her name... I want to say Julie? Juliet? I could be completely making that up. She was a tall thin brunette. At first she seemed busy but eventually she stopped and talked with us about where we work. I did notice when I went to the restroom that every employee stopped to let me pass and smiled/said hello. What a great sign! Props to them on the little details!! The only reason I'm not giving the full five stars is because I think they need to expand their happy hour... I've gone in 4 times and gone elsewhere twice because it was that crowded... waiting for happy hour is just not something I'll ever do because you're losing time that could be spent happy hour-ing elsewhere. haha The first time we were able to get seats it was because they had the private dining room open for HH, whereas tonight people were literally lined up along the wall waiting to snag bar seats... which I find uncomfortable if I want to have a leisurely drink after work.

My favorite dishes, and the ones I highly recommend, are of course their desserts, both the Chocolate Souffle Cake and the Pineapple Upside Down Cake. They are out of this world good, and made fresh too!! The Mahi Mahi (one of the more popular and cheaper entrees on the menu) wasn't as good as I had expected, tasted a bit bland to me. Another entree option we tried was the three course tasting entree, which consisted of three different items from the entree menu (one of them being the Mahi Mahi). But considering how small the portions were, it was a bit disappointing. Might as well have gotten a full size order instead, and it is generally cheaper too. The appetizer, Avocado sushi something, was really good too! Definitely set the mood for the rest of the meal, although in my opinion it tasted even better than the entree dishes.

The staff are very friendly and attentive; the manager even came over to the table to wish me a happy birthday.  Someone else mentioned that the portion sizes were small and I would have to disagree. The sizes were about right for me given the fact that by time I got to the main course, I was already full.  Overall, I can say that I have absolutely no complaints about Roy's.

Unlike other high end restaurants, they didn't charge me to use a semi-private area for the group of 16. I was able to truly customize the menu which was 3 courses. The day of the event everything was superb!!! Each detail of the event was put together perfectly. When we first entered the restaurant, there were some tables still eating in the area where we were to dine (the lounge). However, the situation was handled professionally by the hostess staff, and they kept me informed on their efforts to hurry up the guests in that area. The menus created by Christene made my mom smile ear to ear!! They had her picture on the menu and happy birthday. I appreciated that they were put on the table face down so that each guest was pleasantly surprised when flipping over the menu. I'm not sure if this was intentional, but it was a wonderful touch. The food platters (crabcakes,ribs,calamari) was the highlight of the evening. Everyone thoroughly raved about the food. I know this was a pre-selected appetizer platter that is not normally on the menu, but I was thankful they all worked with me to create this dish. The entree meals were hot when served and again everyone enjoyed the dishes that were plated perfectly. The waitress and her assistant were phenomenal. Both were very patient and helpful. They checked on the table frequently and made a noticeable effort to call my mom and I by our names. OUTSTANDING!!

We had talked about Roy's numerous times over the past year or so.  Each of us had heard great things from friends that RAVED about it.  So my GF goes for it.  She makes her selection and I was happy with it.

2011-10-06,5.0,"Roy's is one of Baltimore's best hidden secrets. From the intimate and dim setting, to the excellent service and fresh menu times, the Hawaiian themed restaurant never seems to disappoint. I've personally made Roy's my location of choice whenever celebrating my birthday. Not because of the very nice location, or the great service, or the delectable entrées, but primarily for the dessert. Let me tell you that this dessert is like something I have yet to experience elsewhere. Roy's special dessert is a pineapple upside cake, baked to order, with coconut ice cream, fresh strawberries, and a palm tree shaped cookie. I love it! The food at Roy's is the highlight of this restaurant. The menu features a unique cuisine based on a Hawaiian and Asian fusion of food's to recreate island favorites enjoyed by many. The glazed ribs are probably the most popular item at ribs, and I see how. Tender, fall off the bone ribs, accompanied by jasmine rice, is a fantastic combination for the meat lovers. Now whenever I go to Roy's I choose not to get an entrée but instead get the canoe appetizer which features szechuan pork ribs, blackened ahi, sesame shrimp, spicy tempura tuna roll & lobster pot stickers. With so much variety to choose from, I just can't not get this meal whenever I go to Roy's. Other menu highlights include, fresh sushi, Hawaiian fish, surf and turf meals, and fantastic meat entrées. The overall atmosphere of Roy's is very dim, highlighted by warm yellows and bamboo accents, all accompanied by subtle island music. There are two sections to sit at- the kitchen room and the dining room. If you are looking for a nice, quiet meal, then I recommend that you sit in the dining room. However, if you're looking to emerged in all the action of an open kitchen, then I recommend that you sit in the kitchen are. Either way, you will have a great time. Roy's is a very nice restaurant, despite the premium prices, that allows guest to experience a little bit of the Hawaiian islands, all in the convenient location outside Baltimore's Inner Harbor.",0.9981,0.778,0.222,0.0,0.5426962676962678

2011-09-17,5.0,"After previously having an unsavory experience at Roy's, my husband and I decided to give it another try.  We can honestly say that the few times we have had dinner there before were likely ""off"" nights, and not representative of the service and food excellence that Roy's provides.  We generally always have a great time at their Aloha happy hour. On a busy Friday evening, we made a last-minute reservation and were seated promptly.  After ordering our usual cocktails, we received two of the most amazing appetizers, the lobster dim sum and the pork buns.  With a heavy background in Chinese cuisine, I was extremely impressed.  The lobster dim sum filling was delicate, fresh from Maine that morning, and melt-in-your mouth.  The wrapper was consistent with traditional dim sum.  These delightful bundles were then served with truffle foam, a lobster puree, and English peas.  This was my favorite of the evening.  The pork buns were served ""open-faced.""  Unlike traditional pork buns, the pork was packed with flavor and traditional Chinese barbecue seasoning, but it wasn't filled with all of the sauce.  Refreshingly, there were red onions and watercress, that gave the pork bun added crunch and flare.  My husband loves pork buns in general, and these were by far his favorite. For entrees, my husband ordered the special of the evening, the Hawaiian ono with bacon risotto and truffle foam on top.   I decided to order the parmesan-crusted mahi mahi, with lobster potato risotto and lobster bisque.  Both were served medium, and the plating of the Hawaiian ono was truly impressive.  It was a tower of ono served over a bed of risotto, and the truffle foam formed a dome on top.  My mahi mahi was done perfectly: the parmesan crust was a dark golden brown - crunchy but light, and the fish was moist, flavorful, and delicate.  There was certainly no need for a knife.  The mahi mahi was served with a lobster potato risotto, and I was delighted to find many succulent pieces of lobster in the risotto.  The potatos were done perfectly so as to match the consistency of a risotto, and there were yellow wax beans served on top of the risotto that were lightly seasoned, well-cooked, and delicious.  The mahi mahi also wasn't swimming in the lobster bisque, which was much appreciated so as to preserve the taste of the mahi. By this time, we were completely stuffed and declined dessert.  To our delight, we were given freshly-baked cookies and ice cream for us to take home!  This was absolutely first-rate customer service that has made us (and I am sure many others) loyal Roy's fans. Our waitress, Brandy, was outstanding, friendly, and genuinely excited about food.  Her service was excellent, and we couldn't say enough about how much better this experience was.  The chef came over to check in on our food.  People here genuinely just want you to leave the restaurant smiling.  Thanks to everyone for making that evening memorable!",0.9989,0.775,0.214,0.011,0.6108730158730159

I saw from Yaka H's review in 2010 that the macademia nut encrusted mahi mahi was not on the menu for the winter restaurant week, but it was this time around! Two friends in our group of 5 got it, I had a taste & it was delicious. I thought the green curry was too strong & masked the taste of the fish, but my friends loved it & thought there should have been more sauce! Backtracking a little--three people got the duck spring roll appetizer, one got the pork belly watermelon salad & I got the beet salad. They weren't the best beets I've had, not quite ripe yet & the greens were a bit bitter, but the other appetizers were delicious. I probably dropped the ball on that one =/ Two from our party got the arare & chili crusted shrimp (perfectly seasoned & cooked!), two got the mahi mahi & one ordered the short ribs (also cooked really well!) For dessert, two of us got the strawberry cobbler & the others got the chocolate torte. Chocolate torte was super soft, inside was perfectly melted and not too sweet. The cobbler used really fresh strawberries and the dough part was also perfectly crunchy but soft at the same time. I wasn't as pleased with the service at Roy's as I was with my other restaurant week experience at Capital Grille & I guess it was because it was during dinner, but the place was SO LOUD. Not even a good kind of buzzing atmosphere--I literally could not hear the people at my table :( The impression I got from Roy's was that it's really a very versatile place--you can chill there for happy hour, come here for drinks & get appetizers with friends, or even go out on a romantic dinner.  One caveat: I found out later that one person from our group got sick in the night, right after our meal. No one else in our party felt sick, so I'm not sure if it was Roy's-related, but I guess you do have to be cautious about seafood!",0.9928,0.726,0.183,0.091,0.6146825396825398

2011-07-08,3.0,"We've been meaning to go to Roy's for a long time, even though we're typically not huge on chain restaurants. Practically everybody gives it glowing reviews, and from the way the misoyaki buttefish is described, you'd think it tasted like winning the lottery. A $50 off coupon that was expiring seemed like the perfect reason, so we tried it on a random weeknight. His plate: wedge salad with applewood smoked bacon Kalbi Grilled Hanger Steak, with brown rice futomaki, almond and red pepper chimmichurri Strawberry Angel Food Cake, with kiwi and strawberry compote, and fresh whip cream Her plate: Auntie Lei's Aloha Roll (spicy tuna, kaiware, cucumber, yellowtail, salmon, avocado, garlic ponzu) Hawaiian Style Misoyaki Butterfish, with Hong Kong sizzling oil and soy vinaigrette Roy's Melting Hot Chocolate Souffle, with raspberry coulis and vanilla bean ice cream We were not very impressed. For the price, we thought it was an okay deal - once you factored in the $50 coupon, which effectively made it half price. For the full price, we won't be back. Service was overly attentive and obsequious - without personality or interest. Our waiter seemed rushed, and was trying to provide lots of information about things we'd already asked him for, and it resulted in a strange experience. When we tried Flemings last year, on a similar coupon, our waiter was back and forth many times, but seemed relaxed and casual, as far from fake as possible. The highlight of the meal for me was the sushi - it was fresh and very cleanly prepared, good flavor and very little rice. It was definitely an island spin on traditional rolls, but I could taste each kind of fish despite the strong flavors, and I really enjoyed it. I typically avoid eating the dyed pink pickled ginger, but theirs was fresh and mild - very good. D's salad was underwhelming, and he felt that it was under-dressed and didn't have enough bacon. This may be partially a personal preference, as it appeared that Roy's meant the bacon more as a garnish. Our entrees were both underwhelming - the steak was cooked well but not interesting, and the fish was not quite the right texture. The misoyaki flavor just didn't come through enough - the fish was cooked nicely, but required a lot of chewing and by the time I finished each mouthful, it was almost flavorless. I think this, too, may be a personal experience issue - having had miso-marinated Chilean sea bass (back when it was an occasional treat, before we swore it off), this texture just couldn't even try to imitate it. Yes, it's more sustainable. But maybe it needs to be marinated a while longer, or in a stronger miso mix. Desserts were good, but both were things that we could make ourselves. In all, it was a lovely dinner... but we're pretty picky. If we were paying full price for this meal, I don't think I'd be as ambivalent about it. After this dinner, I stopped at Roy's ""Aloha Hour"" on my way to class (it being half a block away is very tempting) for some $5 appetizers. This may be the best way to experience this restaurant - the bar isn't huge, but there's plenty of room on a midweek evening to stop in for a quick bite. I was in and out in half an hour, and tried the lobster potstickers and a spicy ahi roll. Next time I go back, I'll snap some pictures. The lobster potstickers (3 to a plate) were okay - I was glad they were only $5 - but the spicy miso butter sauce they come with is fantastic. The spicy ahi roll was delicious, and a good deal - five pieces and a tiny pile of salad.",0.9976,0.798,0.156,0.046,0.5563277061103149

Sadly, I'm finding that the more I dine here, the less impressed I am with the food. Recap of my most recent meal: I was disappointed with the Sunrise at Haleakala roll. I must have missed the fact that this was a deep fried roll. In my humble opinion, if you're working with beautiful sushi grade fish, it's important to taste that. But instead, all I got was crunchy batter and asparagus. The other starter at the table was the Vietnamese Chicken Lettuce Wrap, which again was another deep fried item - far too reminiscent of a spicy hush puppy in a butter lettuce leaf. The Misoyaki Butterfish entree was not at all good. Not only were the bok choy and rice soft and mushy, but so was the fish in due part to its lack of a proper sear - that's more on par with a moderately priced chain than this caliber establishment. Oh, and the thick, sickeningly sweet vinaigrette overpowered everything. My husband's Kalbi Grilled Hanger Steak was at least decent.  Overall, a less than stellar experience for the price we paid. *Note - Roy's seems to be a very popular Cougar hangout, more so than any other Harbor East restaurant.

2011-03-31,3.0,"I was excited to eat at Roy's for years. I had always been interested in Hawaiian Asian Fusion food but Roy's was somewhat disappointing. The interior was very nice, accentuated by yellow and purple colors with nice lighting. As soon as one sits down, the staff brings you fresh edamame seasoned with shiso leaf and course sea salt. My party and I started off by ordering two types of sushi for appetizers. One of the rolls was a spicy tuna roll with avocado, raw salmon, kampachi, and tuna on top. The other roll was a california roll with avocado as well as asparagus topped with real authentic seared kobe beef on top. The sushi was absolutely excellent, definitely the highlight of an otherwise mediocre meal.  The spicy tuna roll was $12 while the kobe beef roll was $18. The menu is designed to have as many fish dishes as possible based on the seasonal availability and regional specialty. I ordered Roy's signature entre, which was a 10-12oz portion of Ahi Tuna, seared until medium rare and then paired with jasmine rice, baby bok choy, with two different sauces along the side of the plate. The first sauce was a mustard type of sauce, the other being a light cream sauce with citrus. Neither sauce complimented the overly seasoned piece of tuna. The best part of the dish was probably the rice and baby bok choy, sadly enough. My guest ordered a seasonal specialty, kampachi with jumbo lump crab on top. This dish was served with a similar cream sauce that the tuna had, as well as ""dirty"" spicy rice with small-diced vegetables in it. The kampachi was seasoned and cooked better than the tuna; however, the ""jumbo-lump crab"" seemed canned or maybe not of the highest quality because it tasted watered down. While I wasn't satisfied with either entree, I must add that the wait staff was top notch. Our waiter was very friendly and attentive. Additionally, the kitchen and restaurant in general was properly staffed, having plenty of chefs and runners, which expedited food service. All in all, my experience at Roy's was less than spectacular. For a restaurant that specializes in fish, I couldn't believe how inept the dishes were. On a final note though, I would return to Roy's, but only for sushi and drinks, hold the entrees.",0.9944,0.827,0.148,0.025,0.5713480963480962

My husband surprised me with a date night in Baltimore and Roy's has been on our 'to try' list for a while. The location in Harbor East is perfect. The decor was fun, clean and beautiful. That's about where the positive ends. We sat at the bar and had a few drinks before our dinner reservation.  1. My mango mojito was the worst one I've ever had. They put half a lime in your drink to take up space. For $11, I was expecting a little more.  2. We had to ask for edamame and it was cooked well, but was either bland or overly spicy. It was a nice change from the standard bread or chips.  3. We ordered the california rolls to start. They came out REALLY fast, but without soy sauce, chop sticks, etc. We had to wait for our server to come back and asked for them. Either way, it was tasteless and I was starting to wonder what people are talking about with these 5 star reviews.  4. 45 minutes later and two more check ins from our server telling us our food would be right out and still no entrees. 15 more minutes and two visits from a manager and still no food. We were sitting quietly, not really complaining, just trying to figure out how much longer we were willing to wait. There wasn't a wait for tables and we watched other groups get their food when they were seated after us. My husband started the 5 min countdown before we would cancel and just leave. As we're looking for our server to cancel, our food arrives.  5. Roy's Trio: butterfish was my husband's favorite, but was a small portion and i thought it tasted like hoisin sauce. Ahi tuna was barely seared, but had a nice texture, seemed fresh and had a good sauce with it. Salmon tasted like dried ice. The accompaniments were a joke and more of a garnish. This was a $30+ meal and was way overpriced. I'm used to expensive meals, but the quantity and quality didn't deliver.  6. Shellfish Sampler: Two yummy scallops that were the best part of the whole meal for me. Two stuffed shrimp that were medium sized and not stuffed. It had a dollop of tasteless mush on top that after sampling i took off and just ate the shrimp. Lobster was small, but cooked well. Risotto was flavorless and neither one of us ate it. Another $30+ meal that didn't deliver.  We were so let down and just wanted to get out of there! We asked for our bill and they told us we didn't have one. We were really impressed that the managers comped our check without us asking or really complaining. I want to add a star for that fact alone, but I just can't with the poor quality of the food. So, we tipped our server and finally got to leave.  Side notes: I asked for a straw in my water and the server grabbed one from the bar with his bare hands, walked it over and stuck it in my drink. Yuck. The restaurant wasn't packed, but was fairly full so, the noise level was much louder then I thought it would be. I had to keep repeating myself because my husband couldn't hear me.  I really wanted to like this place, but just couldn't get over such a negative experience. If you want fresh seafood, make the trip out of the city to Catonsville Gourmet. Its delicious and so much cheaper for better quality food. Oh yelpers, why did you fail us?

2010-07-28,5.0,"Founded by chef extraordinaire Roy Yamaguchi in Honolulu, Hawaii in 1988. He was the first chef ever to marry the European Cooking techniques, local ingredients and bold Asian spices, with a focus on fresh seafood. Roy calls this style of cooking Hawaiian Fusion cuisine since his dishes are created with a Hawaiian state of mind. It's been about two years that a good friend has highly recommended me to visit Roy's. Finally, for Baltimore restaurant week I and a friend decided to give Roy's a try. Now, I am a total addict! My favorite seat in the house is at the ""chef counter"".  I am always socked that more people do not to sit here and watch all the action. So, down to my experience: Few minutes after seating, one of the managers greeted us with a crispy Hawaiian Egg roll on the house. Soon after, our server appeared, she was an extremely welcoming person who introduced herself and the daily specials. She took our order for a bottle of the Chateau Potelle, a fresh and fruity Sauvignon Blanc that would exquisitely accompany the seafood dishes we were about savour. Roy's menu changes every day, but there are certain favorites that you'll always find on the menu. This evening, the two of us each ordered an appetizer and an entrée. To finish it off we also ordered the twenty minute Chocolate Soufflé to share for dessert. Instead of a typical appetizer (although not much at Roy's is really typical) we ordered the Crunchy Golden Lobster Potstickers which are delightfully accompanied by a spicy Togarashi Miso butter sauce, we also ordered the price fixed menu appetizers called the Roy's Hawaiian Fusion sampler which was a sample of a shrimp stick, a pork rib and the chef special creation (in our case a lobster dumpling) . The Lobster Potstickers are actually a larger portion (6 0r 8) and it is definitively more suitable for sharing that the sampler, which consists of only 3 small portions. For our main dishes we ordered the Lump Crab Dynamite Stuffed Rainbow trout and the Teppenyaki Seared Rim Fire shrimp this to be served with Pad Thai style noodles. As we finished our appetizers my companion and I noticed the attentiveness of the staff. Everyone was so prompt and polite and we always felt as we had first class services. At one point, Executive Chef Rey Eugenio came toward our sitting area to greet us and asked feedback on the food. Chef Rey who is a very welcoming guy, chatted with us regarding his gorgeous kitchen and his team. Our food which we had been watching being prepared arrived. Both dishes were carefully presented and it was a feast to our eyes. Both meals were cooked to perfection and magnificent to our senses. My pad Thai style noodles and giant grilled prawns were just a tad spicy and alluring with Hawaiian flavors. My companion trout, which I also tasted was a bit spicier than mine, the trout cook to perfection and delicately moist and delicate in flavors. Lastly we were presented with our Chocolate Soufflé, which is a flour-less Chocolate cake that flowed with a molten center. This luscious dessert was complimented with a delicious Vanilla Ice Cream.

We were excited that they had a bottle of Dry Creek wine on the menu and were very pleased with it. Our entrees were the macadamia nut encrusted mahi mahi and the Ahi tuna.

2010-06-08,1.0,"What a dissapointment after going to the one in Hawaii. From the drinks to the dessert, about the only good thing was the service and the Edemame.  I ordered the 1988 Martini.  It was so sweet, I had to send it back.  I replaced it with a Sour Apple Martini, which I would have sent back also, but I was just to thirsty. I then ordered a Jack and Ginger, figuring they couldn't mess that up, bad also.  I think Simple Syrup is a staple in every drink.  Moving on to appetizers.  My husband ordered the Ahi Sashimi, which were only 4 slices that were so thin, you could almost see through them.  I played it safe with a salad, but it was so lukewarm, that went back.  For dinner, I ordered the Filet Mignon which I had to salt 4 times, all the flavor being in the sauce over it.  Not to mention that it wasn't even an inch think.  It looked like something I could have gotten at Applebee's.  By this time, we're both so dissapointed, we didn't finish our meal.  My husband ordered a Pineapple Upside Down cake to take home (we just wanted to leave by that point) and after taking a bite, it was so dry, I threw it out back for the raccoons.  If Roy Yamaguchi had had our meal, he would have been mortified.  I don't usually leave such a bad review of a restaurant, but for these prices, I felt it necessary.   So much for a wonderful Anniversary Dinner.",0.8908,0.863,0.089,0.047,0.47292568542568536

2010-05-22,3.0,"I have to re-review this after going back for I believe the fourth time. Either Roy's is going downhill, or my tastes have just matured a bit.  We were there tonight.  California roll was good.  Fish and chips lacked flavor but were interesting.  Arugula salad was fine but ordinary.   But the main dishes, an ahi tuna in a wasabi sauce with bok choy, and a scallop with ""egg roll"" dish, were not good.  The ahi itself was bland, lukewarm.  The sauce added taste but was very heavy, and tasted like it wasn't freshly made.  The fish was way too much to eat.  The scallops tasted like crunchy mush with a bad offtaste, and were served with essentially two huge egg rolls. And the bill, for what you get relative to other things in Baltimore, is kind of outrageous.  This isn't Woodberry Kitchen and it's certainly not Charleston.  So why is it priced higher? This was the first time I really noticed that Roy's served food very much like a chain restaurant served food - it's not that much different from a Cheesecake Factory or a McCormick and Schmick's, but priced much higher.  It's predictable, assembly-line, with too big portions and heavy premade sauce.  If I had only been here this one time, I would've rated this place 2 stars; as is, I'll give it 3, but I'm not optimistic I'll ever go back.",0.9289,0.842,0.111,0.047,0.4652611367127496

Located in Harbor East, the place is what I expected to see: upscale and elegant.  Once the maitre d' found out we were there for a birthday, she quickly set up the table with a cute birthday card and some ribbons.  Then our server and manager at some point came to greet my friend a happy birthday.  Lastly, they took a picture and printed it out on paper for us to keep.  I thought it was all very charming. While Roy's has several classic dishes among the chain restaurants, the executive chef of Roy's in Baltimore (Rey Eugenio) has a specialty for Filipino cuisine, so it was nice to see some of the special dishes.  I had the ""1988"" martini with lychee liqueur and grapefruit vodka, and I thought it was fruity and easily drinkable.  We then started our meal with the Thai Shrimp salad and the mochi ahi sashimi, and both were delicious.  My friend got the salmon with white beans that was also really great, but the standout dish for me was the Kajiki (white fish with a very meaty taste...) with pomegranate reduction and citrus quinoa.  It was very easy to eat and had a great texture.  We ended our course with the signature souffle and the pineapple upside-down cake (which we had to order ahead of time so they can bake it fresh).  They were both great, but the souffle was phenomenal (moist and creamy)!!!!

We came for lunch because I had really wanted to try the Macademia Nut Encrusted Mahi Mahi, which was not available on the prix fix dinner menu.   We started off with a complimentary bowl of spicy seasoned shelled edamame beans. For the appetizers, the salad with miso-sesame dressing and the curry seafood chowder. In addition, we also ordered Sunrise at Haleakala. For the entree, the M academia Nut Encrusted Mahi Mahi and the Honey Dijon Beef Short Rib. For dessert, the M academia Nut Tart and the Dark Chocolate Ganache Tart. For an appetizer, the prix fix salad was hugeeee! The Sunrise roll was delicious and a familiar concept. The mahi mahi was also quite delicious. Very tender (had it cooked medium, as recommended) and the crunch and aroma of macadamia nuts was delightful. SX's short rib was good too. It was tender, but not as tender as Korean short rib meat that had been braised/stewed. I guess it might have been due to the lack of fat or different cooking style.  The timing to received desserts was a little slow. The macadamia nut tart was very similar to a pecan pie and was served warm. It was warmed a bit too much though, as the crust on one side was almost on the verge of being burnt. The ganache tart was luscious with a chopped nut bottom, but was a bit too rich for the both of us.   We will definitely be back to try the other fish/seafood dishes.  Coming here for Restaurant Week is a great way (and cheaper way) to sample the service and food at Roy's.  We made a reservation online (very easy to do) and the service was courteous and friendly.

2009-10-15,5.0,"Relocating to Baltimore was a bit of bittersweet process. I come from MoCo/DC where the food can be amazing, but there's always a variety and its consistent! Baltimore is truly hit or miss when it comes to cuisine. Honestly, it worried me.  But again, this is what Yelp is for.  So my 21st birthday was coming up and I wanted to go somewhere totally nice where my friends and I could go dressed to the nines and have a exquisite dining experience. It seemed like all the arrows were pointing to ROY'S. From the pictures and the reviews this definitely seemed like the ideal place to spend a lovely birthday dinner with loved ones. The food seemed pricey (and it is), but it seemed like it was worth it for the ambiance alone.  My dinner at Roy's almost didn't happen because for some reason their private dining options were full (aka the kitchen doesn't want to deal with another 20+ reservation that night). Fine. A little discouraging, but I managed to get it down to 10 ppl to make it work. So on that fateful October 7th night, my group of ten came to Roy's at our 6pm reservation. They have valet and we got it validated right away. We were seating right next to the window which was awesome. Our server came around very fast and was very attentive all night (as annoying as we probably were). We ordered one appetizer, the lobster potstickers and it has a very unique taste, but so damn good! I'm not going to go ramble on about the meal everyone ordered, but I will tell some highlights.  Their crabcakes- best I've ever had ANYWHERE (besides my mother's) No filler. No disappointment. To me, exactly how a crabcake should taste.  Roy's Classic Trio- I'm not a big seafood person, but I did want to try something beyond the cheeseburger/milkshake combo I love... it comes with butterfish, ahi tuna, and grilled salmon. I liked 2/3 fish (salmon and ahi tuna). The butterfish was good, but again I'm not a huge fish person.  Pineapple Upside down cake- LOVED this more than the chocolate souffle, but that's because I love pineapple and chocolate is often too rich for me.  Chocolate Souffle- VERY good! It was very rich and decadent, but I loved the raspberry sauce it came with. It was delicious and definitely worth the visit (which btw, is the sole reason I chose this place...wanted to try it lol).  I had one of their martinis and I'm not a huge drinker so it wasn't that good to me. It was huge and a strong drink, if that matters ;) One last comment...this is definitely a great place if you want to celebrate a special occasion. Picturesque scenery and great ""photoshooot"" locations nearby! Check out some of my pics. I'm lucky it didn't rain that night like it was supposed to!

2009-08-31,5.0,"We went here last Saturday for my birthday dinner (my 3rd time at Roy's) and everything was SO ONO! It's definitely worth the $$. Roy's has got to be one of my favorite restaurants. The birthday greeting on our table was a nice touch. They also took our picture (which they do for other tables celebrating special occasions) and gave us a printed copy as a keepsake.  For starters, we got the miso butterfish and calamari. My husband can't stop raving about the butterfish. The calamari was cooked perfectly. The sauce was very good. I got the fish trio (butterfish, salon & tuna) for the entree. I LOVE the salmon & butterfish (better than my husband's butterfish in my opinion). Very flavorful! The tuna was also good but the wasabi sauce was too strong for me. My husband loved it though. I am not a big chocolate person but I would have to agree that the chocolate souffle was out of this world!!  One downside (which wasn't Roy's fault) was the valet parking! They mislabeled the valet ticket so they couldn't find our car. We waited for like forever!

We called ahead and they actually had curled ribbon and a mini Happy Anniversary sign with our names on the table. Such a nice touch!  Yes, the plates are expensive, but they were so worth it! Instead of bringing bread, they brought seasoned edamame!  I had some sort of cocktail that the waiter recommended, and it was delicious. We split an appetizer that the waiter recommended, which was also delicious.  Okay pretty much everything we had was delicious.  The portions looked small (especially for the price) but with all of the food, they turned out to be just right.  They helped us leave room for the delicious dessert we split... we chose not to go with the chocolate dessert and it was such an awesome choice!  Highly recommended for celebrating a special occasion, but only if you have a lot of time to relax and wait...

2009-05-25,4.0,"I've eaten at Roy's Baltimore twice.   $35 can't really be beat for a 3 course prix fixe. The sunrise at haleakala and the lakanilau rolls are truly amazing.   The sunrise at haleakala is a fried roll with asparagus, salmon, and tuna.  The lakanilau has dynamite crab and a slice of kobe beef on top.   It is also very good and a great dish to share.   The first time at Roy's, I had the filet mignon which came on a bed of risotto and mushrooms in a red wine sauce.  The beef was tender perfectly cooked. My second visit to Roy's i had the Mongchongo fish which came on a bed of crispy asian noodles with black bean sauce.  It was a very tasty and delicate fish.  I highly recommend it.   The chocolate volcano is the best dessert they have and you can't go to Roy's without trying it. The pomegranate mojito is a tasty, fruity drink that I had both times at Roys. In terms of service, it's been a bit spotty.  My first visit to Roy's, the waitress wasn't very attentive or helpful.  She didn't go over any specials or recommendations.  My second time at Roy's was to celebrate a party and we had 7 people.  Our waitress and the staff was extremely helpful.  Roy's is one of the better places to eat in the inner harbor area. Side note: I've eaten at Roy's Orlando and I thought that location was a step above Roy's Baltimore food wise. ---------- Edit: Roy's recently started serving lunch.  I tried the kobe beef burger and it was the best burger i've had in my life.  It was so flavorful and came with a side of sweet potato fries.  It was only $11 too!.",0.9953,0.811,0.189,0.0,0.4865432098765432

2009-02-25,4.0,"Roy's Restaurant is nestled at the heart of the inner harbor, on the cusp of the President Street cobblestone circle.  The valet was staffed by about five people on a Saturday night, and their service merited the eight dollar fee. There was no wait to hand off the keys when we arrived, and the car was back in my possession quickly when we ready to go. The valet asked to have the ticket validated inside the restaurant, which doesn't make much sense since it isn't free or discounted in any way. Good thing we made reservations because the place was packed. The hostess quickly had our table waiting and was ready to take our jackets, gloves and scarves. If it's cold out be sure to take advantage of this complimentary coat check. Our server Elizabeth was very energetic, and knew the menu inside and out. Instead of rattling off the names of the specials, she described each one in detail. She was a little speedy on the run down of the menu descriptions, but that is understandable since her section was full. We began with water, which is served in glasses typically used for white wine. We ordered a dirty martini with Grey Goose vodka, very dry, and the Hawaiian Martini. The vodka martini came with only two olives, but they were pretty large. The taste of pineapple permeated the Hawaiian martini, and the alcohol was not very prevalent. Edamame is served for the table, in the same manner that bread is given at a steakhouse or nachos are served at a Mexican restaurant. For regular appetizers, we ordered the lobster California roll and Kalbi sirloin. The lobster roll came as an inside-out eight piece maki, with a sparse drizzling of red tobiko on top. It was rolled loosely but tasted very good. The quantity of lobster meat appeared to be half a tail, so this was probably one of the best priced sushi choices at only nine dollars. The Kalbi sirloin had flavors softly reminiscent of the grill, and the meat absorbed much of the flavor from the edamame fried rice bed underneath, giving it a delicious tang. Our entrees included the braised pork pot roast and Japanese style Atlantic salmon yakitori. The pot roast had a beautiful circular presentation, and tasted homemade. It had a slight teriyaki flavor offered by the pork jus, complemented perfectly by the creamed corn sauce drizzled on top. The salmon yakitori was absolutely delicious. The presentation was ordinary, but the flavor negated any artistic need to compensate. The salmon was moist and melted in my mouth like butter, and the kimchi and edamame infused fried rice was an excellent choice as a starch balancer for this dish. The dessert choices are limited, but this is probably due to the overwhelming popularity of Roy's signature dessert, the melting hot chocolate soufflé. The exterior has a texture between cake and fudge, and the interior is a delicious molten chocolate core ready to spill abundantly as the fork breaks into the delicately crumbling soufflé. Roy's was a wonderful dining experience with a carefully created atmosphere and special attention paid to the detail in the local Hawaiian decorations and menu creations. It isn't authentic Hawaiian food by any means, but it is surely a unique concept worth enjoying with your family and friends.",0.9987,0.797,0.186,0.017,0.5590123244810745
2009-01-07,3.0,"Like many who love Roy's, I've also had few very memorable meals.  Unfortunately, our last two meals there did not live up to the high expectations established from our earlier visits.  The dishes we used to love are no longer executed like it was done before and it has changed for the worse.  This obviously leads to disappointment.  One example is the short ribs.  The meat became less tender.  Less sauce is served with the dish now and it became saltier also. I was tempted to give out the 4th star just due to their chocolate souffle.  This dessert remains awesome and is our bar for rating other chocolate desserts. Also watch out for Valentine's day dinner here.  The fixed price menu on V-day is expensive.  The more expensive sets (steak or lobster) on V-day 3 course menu ran $75-$85 per person.  A college couple next to us had to share one lobster set course.  Poor kids.",0.7458,0.808,0.111,0.081,0.4715999999999999

2008-03-03,5.0,"Maybe it was the [stroong] pineapple martini, maybe it was the company, maybe it was the restaurant...Or maybe it was all three? All I know is that this was one of the most enjoyable meals I've ever had! Happy birthday, Jenny!! :D I came here with a group of 18 people on a Saturday night and score #1 for Roy's is that they were gracious and willing to accommodate us on such short notice (a few days). When we sat down, a flurry of servers came to fill our waters, place napkins on our laps and take drink orders. But the most amazing thing they did was put edamame on our tables. ""Who ordered this?"" I asked. I saw some shrugs, and then someone told me the magic words: ""They're complimentary."" Can it be? It was. Not only was the edamame free, but they were also dusted with some kind of spicy spice (redundant? Maybe...). It was details like these that really put this restaurant over the top. The amazing value that is the prix-fixe menu is usually not available for large parties, but they made an exception for us. $35 for an appetizer, entree and dessert (a la Restaurant Week) is available year-round.  Appetizers: - I ordered the miso salmon & tofu salad which could have passed as an entree; The portions were really that generous.  - The other appetizer option (a roll) was also pretty good, but the salmon & tofu was much better. Entrees: It was difficult for all of us to order our entrees because all four options sounded so good! So we did what any group of Asian people would do: We ordered everything and then shared our dishes!  - The tiger shrimp with coconut curry was light and extremely tasty. The shrimp itself was pretty sizeable and noticeably fresh.  - The sirloin served with crispy onion rings was cooked exactly how you ordered it. One person ordered it medium; another medium rare, and you could actually see the difference. Nice. The onion rings were nothing spectacular.  - I can't remember the third dish...But it's my dish that I can't forget. I ordered the short ribs which came with vegetables (brussels sprouts, shallots, etc.) and a potato pancake thing. All of it was delicious. I didn't even need to use my butter knife to cut into the ribs - It just fell apart when I poked my fork in it.  Dessert:  - The dessert options were chocolate souffle cake with ice cream or some kind of prailine...something. Can you tell what I ordered? The chocolate souffle was soft and creamy...Not too rich. I tasted my friend's prailine thing, but I could barely taste it with the memory of my chocolate souffle on my tongue. It was perfect. I know this is getting long, but you also need to know about their incredible service. Here it is in bullet form: (Thanks Julie for the reminder!) - Attention to detail. They placed ribbons on our table and wrote a friendly message on our birthday girl's dessert plate with chocolate syrup. Yumm... - Attentive but not overbearing service. When did our water glasses get filled? I thought I didn't have a knife - How did it end up here? We asked questions like this all night and realized that the service was so fabulous that it was unnoticeable.  - The service was also timely - With a group our size, we were pleasantly surprised that all of our food came out at the same time. It's a logistical mystery how they were all warm, too.  - Generous with everything. Not only were the portions generous, but the server accidentally spilled a few drops of someone's martini as she was moving it, and BROUGHT A WHOLE NEW DRINK.  Check out the pictures. I highly recommend Roy's, especially for a date or special occasion. We all left feeling great, feeling full and feeling happy!

2007-02-22,2.0,"I'd heard good things about Roy's in the past, but my experience there left something to be desired. As the hostess directed to the table we had reserved on a Wednesday night, we noticed that we there were empty booth tables available, which would have been great for us since we had a sleeping toddler with us. The table they had set up for us had separate chairs at each space, and a high chair for the toddler, who obviously could not sit in it, since he was asleep. When this situation was brought to the attention of the hostess, she politely but forcefully denied our request to move to a booth, saying that we wouldn't fit at such a table. She didn't seem to want to be persuaded otherwise, so we took the table originally designated for us. The lackluster service continued later that evening when our waiter asked whether we were at the restaurant for any particular occasion, pointing to my tie and jacket. This would have been a fair question, but half the dining room was sporting ties, and I had on jeans and a rumpled shirt to boot. It just seemed like a callous and unwarranted comment in such a context. The food itself was slightly less disappointing. Our fried calamari was unique in its preparation, though the sauce it came slathered in was a bit unbalanced. The entrees lived up to the Roy's philosophy of fusion cuisine, but some seemed like experimental dishes rather than definitively prepared meals. A trout dish came with a crab imperial that lacked much in the way of actual crab. The highlight of the evening came in the form of dessert. Roy's upside-down pineapple cake was a huge hit and saved this particular Roy's from earning a generally unfavorable impression from us. To be honest, though, the following evening, I dined with the same party at Oceanaire, just across the street, and came away far more impressed. With so many fine restaurants cropping up in Baltimore, Roy's must do more to stand out from the crowd and justify its pricey menu.
