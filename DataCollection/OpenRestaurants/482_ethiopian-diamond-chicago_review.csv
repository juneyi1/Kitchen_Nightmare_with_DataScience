You'll feel full, but Ethiopian food tends to be healthier than most, so not too much guilt there. I look forward to coming back here again since I live in the neighborhood!

2017-07-31,4.0,"Just wow. This family owned place is wonderful FLAVORS (5 Stars) Ethiopian flavors are just wow. It was just the right amount of tartness balanced with a touch of spiciness if desired 1) Injera (aka the spongy bread that comes with all orders): This item remided my friends of it being an in between of an Indian Dosa, typically has a tart batter from fermentation, and sourdough. In short we kept calling it  a wet dosa due to the moisture with the perfect amount of sponginess  2) Black lentil: avoid this if possible. I say if you're into lentils get them when you're eating Indian or middle eastern cuisines. Almost tasted bad but it was actually just the spice combination 3) Doro Wat: We tried the medium level spicy dish but can say any level that you can handle is a must. 4) 41 Duba Wat: Not just vegetarians, but everyone will go crazy for this. The combination of pumpkin, injera and ""Diamond Berbere"" will have everyone licking their fingers SERVICE (4 Stars) If the food wasn't impeccable, I would have a problem with this. I do understand this is a family run business but there are 2 possible solutions to the slow service: A) hire more servers during busy times B) have the owner and server make more rounds while checking on the employees (totally do-able with out spending too much money) ATMOSPHERE (5 stars) I love that this place wasn't too crowded and filled with families.

2017-05-11,5.0,"This is the best Ethiopian restaurant in Chicago. I've been coming here for about 15 years, and I bring lots of family and friends here to experience Ethiopian cuisine (usually for the first time). It's one large room with a full bar, and there's a real communal spirit, which encourages the group experience -- which is the best (and most fun) way to enjoy Ethiopian food. First of all, let's dispel some myths. Ethiopian cuisine is varied and plentiful. Just because we in America in the last few decades have seen and heard about how there has been terrible famine in that part of the world, it doesn't mean you won't eat well and eat much. I scarcely have ever left any Ethiopian restaurant without feeling full (or wishing I could have stopped myself from just... six... more... bites).  Also, yes, Ethiopian food is ""spicy"" in the sense that it definitely uses spices. But it doesn't mean intolerably spicy or super-hot spicy. I recently took some newbies to try it for their first time, and they cannot handle any amount of spice heat. I explained this to our very friendly waitress, and the kitchen handled it perfectly. Still retained the flavor of what would have been the 2 or 3 ""hotter"" choices I ordered, but for the more tame tastes of my guests. They were thrilled. Just as important, the style of eating is worth telling new guests. Silverware is unnecessary but they will provide it if insistent. Look, if you can eat pizza with your hands, and dip tortilla chips into salsa, and pita into hummus/tabbouleh/baba ghanoush, they you can handle eating Ethiopian food. You tear off a pancake-like bread called injera that tastes somewhat similar to sourdough, place the little piece on top of the meat or vegetables on the communal platter, and pinch. Then you pop that in your mouth. Clean hands is important obviously. The restaurant has decent restrooms and even an extra hallway handwashing station which is easy to access.  There's plenty of space. Large and small tables, and even somewhat more authentic seating in a lounge area. Enormous mural artwork adorns the walls, showing historical and cultural life in Ethiopia. Service is friendly to the extreme. Such nice people. I've become accustomed to many of the faces, even though over time staff has come and gone, and they are all so nice. The manager and/or the owner are always around, and there's almost always someone buzzing around if you can't find your own server. They want to help make your experience great. They're proud of this place, and they know you will enjoy it. Hardly ever a language barrier, and if so, another staff member can rescue the befuddled busboy, etc. Now to the food. FABULOUS. Your mouth will thank you again and again. E.D. has a wide variety of choices, including beef, chicken, lamb, and fish, as well as about 10 to 12 vegetable choices. I love taking my vegetarian friends and family here, because they are so happy to have so many choices, and even omnivores may be able to do without meat here, that's how good the vegetable choices are. For the uninitiated, there are meats that are sauced or stewed, usually called a ""wat"" (pronounced like ""watt""). You can also order the meat without the sauce, and it's still seasoned, but more like what you would see as small chunks (very small kebabs) called ""tibs"". When I order, I usually get at least one wat and at least one tibs. Usually changing up the meats is a great way to get some variety, too. So, perhaps a chicken tibs and a lamb wat. Again, the vegetables are fabulous. Few cuisines consider the veggies the stars of the meal, but honestly, they probably are at least the co-stars or the stars when I eat here. The one with the most spice heat is the red lentils, then the most exotic, the pumpkin wat. Almost all the rest are mild, and they're all great. I like the ones with cabbage, carrots and potatoes; another with green beans and potatoes; the collard greens or the spinach (they're very similar, but both are good); the yellow lentils are very mild and similar to chickpeas. You can't miss with this place. A great dining experience. Because everything is served on large platters (which can be swapped and rotated around the table), it's conducive to group discussion, sharing, and friendly contact. A full bar with many unusual choices (international brands, and their honey wine) is right there and always stocked well. Sodas and such for others. And some great coffee too (Ethiopia is considered ""the birthplace of coffee"".) Remember this is foreign cuisine and served by people who are originally of a different culture, so some allowances needs to be made for service and language. Patience and tolerance will get you far. These people are here to show you how wonderful their food is. Enjoy!",0.9994,0.797,0.186,0.018,0.5359263672107709

We did request forks as this is not our first foray into Ethiopian food - we've never encountered the spicy notations on other restaurants menus before however.. It is so delicious and always accompanied by their type of bread called Injera. It's very light and sponge like. It's used to scoop / pick up the food. That's a ton of carbs so we like to do half & half.  The Chicken & Beef Tibs was accompanied by a really good dinner salad that was lightly spiced. & then there was also some potato's & lentils, also super yummy. All was served on a large platter on top of Injera. There was also another plate of Injera should you need it.  If you aren't into sharing off a communal platter let your server know.  After lunch we spoke a very lovely lady who either worked there or was a friend??? She showed us the seating area with several Ethiopian style seats with tables designed to hold the communal trays. They had a little band area set up and they play music at night. And she told me about their delicious coffee & how it is kind of a ceremony & an important part of get togethers.  It apparently is very flavorful due to the brewing process and clay pot it is served in.

2016-08-26,4.0,"Stopped by after a beach day to eat and I am glad I did. The food was delicious! This was my first time eating Ethiopian food but definitely not my last!  As we walked into the restaurant I noticed two big Ethiopian families sitting and eating and I was excited because I felt like that was a positive indicator of good food.  My friend ordered the vegetarian sampler and I ordered the Tibs Wat. The waitress asked if we wanted all the food together on the same platter and we agreed to share. They brought out the platter and I'm glad we shared! It was a circular tray with little piles of the food over their spongy flat bread (Injera). The waitress explained that you use your hands and use the bread like a tortilla to scoop the food, which was right up my expertise. My favorite little piles on the plate were the Tibs Wat (spicy but good) and the Yemisir Wat (red lentils). I think I just loved the berbere sauce! We also had the appetizer sambusas which were delicious, I loved the spinach one. It's surprising how fast you get full because of the injera with the food. I had great left overs the next day!  Service was approachable and friendly. With great food and good service I will definitely be back.

2016-08-14,2.0,"This was my first time trying Ethiopian.  I must say it was a fun and new experience to eat with no forks! But, the food was okay to me, I don't get all the five star reviews?!? I wanted to stay safe so I ordered the diamond salad and the sambusas  (I only tried the potato one which was really good). I wanted to try the spinach. They seemed to have messed up our orders so we didn't get enough spinach. All was pretty good, especially the sambusa.  Then I shared the Ethiopian sampler which wasn't bad, but wouldn't be something I would crave to have again. The chicken and steak was just okay with not much flavor, spinach and collard greens are greens (not sure how you can mess that up), and the lentils were okay too. The ""bread"" really had no taste, had a spongy feel to it. I don't get why everyone raves about it. It was very hot and humid in the restaurant so eating all this spicy food was not so thrilling. I tried the one hot sauce and was sweating!  Besides the food being just okay, the service was incredibly slow. It took our waiter almost an hour just to take our order, 1.5hr to bring us water (mind you, we're sweating BC it's so warm in the restaurant), he never asked if we wanted other drinks (guess he doesn't care about tips probably BC they add gratuity to the bill),  food took a while, and of course the bill took another half an hour. Mind you it wasn't even crowded being a Sunday at 2pm. There were probably five other tables.  We made reservations and when we got there, they said they didn't have anything.  We called that morning, a few hours before! Then we ordered coffee and we never got that either! They must not give a ****, business must be doing just fine... It's so funny because the waiter, maybe owner of the restaurant didn't seem phased by our experience.  He smiled and acted super friendly as if he was on top of his game!  Needless to say, he has some competition so they better get their act together because people will go elsewhere.  It's Uptown, there are other Ethiopian restaurants.",0.9888,0.823,0.135,0.041,0.5583786583786584

I've been going to Ras Dashen to fill the gap because it was also within walking distance.  Two weeks ago, my wife and I were trying to figure out what we wanted for dinner, and on a whim we just decided to give this place another go, since we haven't had Ethiopian food in a long time and it was also the closest.

We never had to wait long for our food to arrive, but I feel the slowness others complain about might be a bit of an ""ethnic flavor"".

There were about 9 other tables that were full so while it wasn't packed, that seemed like a good crowd for a Monday. We were promptly seated and given menus and water. We told the server we were only there for dessert so she got us dessert menus then never came back. I figured since there were only 3 items on the dessert menu that the waitress should be back fairly quickly but I watched her walk around and talk to other staff and I couldn't flag her or anyone else down. They didn't seem particularly busy, they were mostly just gathered around a counter talking to each other. We gave up and left somewhere after the 20 minute mark. I figured I had annoyed her or something but after reading other reviews, I guess that's typical. It's unfortunate because the place smelled wonderful and I love Ethiopian food.

Our waitress was very courteous, even though her English was a little rusty. I'm docking two stars because we had to wait over an hour and a half for our food.

But service inside the restaurant was enough to discourage me from ever trying to pay another dine-in visit to Ethiopian Diamond. My boyfriend and I went to the Diamond last night for Valentine's Day.  We arrived around 8pm and were seated shortly thereafter. Sounds like a pretty smooth night in the making, right? WRONG.   The restaurant seemed to be very short-staffed for a regular Saturday night, let alone Valentine's Day.  At first our server seemed able to keep it together: she took our drink order, took our food order, and delivered our carrot soup appetizer all in a swift and timely fashion. And then came the painfully long wait. After about an hour, she delivered a second round of carrot soups and apologized for the food's delay. We finally got our large platter of injera and some other delicious foods a little AFTER 10pm. So we basically waited two hours for our meal. Ethiopian Diamond offered a special prix fixe type of menu for Valentine's Day and it was supposed to include, among other dishes, quosta, tikel gomen, and yatkilt wat.  Our platter, once it arrived, was missing all three of these sides.  When I brought it up to the server, she apologized and went back to the kitchen to pack the missing sides so we could take them home with us.  We also never got the dessert that came with the meal, and by the end of the night, we were beyond disappointed and too tired to want to stick around any longer to haggle over the bill, so we basically just gathered up our carry out boxes and vowed never to dine inside Ethiopian Diamond again. Our server did take the drinks off our bill (bf had two beers and I had a glass of honey wine) for our unpleasant experience, but we were still charged full price for a meal whose included dessert we weren't even served. I'll stick with Demera or Ras Dashen next time I have a hankering for that deliciously spicy Ethiopian fare.",0.6791,0.865,0.076,0.059,0.5112306674806676

Here is a narration of our nightmare:  1) First they pushed us to small tables which is kind of tight for 4 people. Knowing their serving plates are big they should have more spacious tables and sitting arrangement. 2) Our company ordered the same food as we did. Our attended didn't even checked what is going on. After 45 min, I had to go myself to the manager (Rob) to request if we can get our food as our company had almost finished their food.  3) After escalation we got our food which was almost 1 hour after we ordered our food.  4) Our company finished their food and then our food was served we had very tight space. No attendant came to check and take the plates away. Our company had to pick her own place to take it one of the attendants to take it away. Shame on you guys!  5) Lastly, we got our desert and only 3 people got their forks. I am not sure how to eat ice-cream with my hands!  6) At the end, insult to injury and kind of a slap on our face manager gave us 10% discount (I would keep minimum 20% tip) on the bill (Which was already paid). We had to go to manager how is he planning to give us that discount since it's prepaid. He had no answer. (Smart move Mr. Rob!)  7) Finally, manager (Rob) said maybe they can put it on the gift card. Does he expects us to come back to a place after such a bad experience? This money doesn't even pay food for 1 person's dinner. So, we had to ask him that we don't need that money and give that to our attendant. For a restaurant which charges $150 for 4 people is by no means qualify for a cheap restaurant. If you want to enjoy and have a better dining experience then this is definitely not a place for you.",-0.9523,0.866,0.047,0.087,0.5278769841269841
2014-11-23,3.0,"Here we go... 1) The sambusas - these were pretty bad. They only have Lentil, Potato&Carrot, and Spinach. There were no meat ones on the menu. They were all very bland and the dough was very tough. Skip these. 2) The salad was just okay - nothing to write home about. Skip it. 3) We had the E4 and E5. From E4 - Tibs Sampler 09/13 Combo Zil Zil Tibs/Doro Zips  (marinated steak and chicken) these were terrible. It was like fajita fillings but without any seasoning. Definitely skip this. 30 Yesmir  Wat (spicy lentils) - the best of the whole group! 33 Gomen (Collard Greens) was bad. really bad. skip it. 34 Quosta (spinach) - it was good if you are into that sort of thing. my vote is to skip it. 35 Tikel Gomen (cabbage & carrots) - it was good but not the best we have had From E5 - The Traditional Platter 06 Tibs (grilled steak) was terrible. It was like fajita fillings but without any seasoning. Definitely skip this.  12 Doro Wat (spicy chicken leg) was good, I would recommend it if you are here but I have had better. 17 Yebig Alicha (mild lamb) was pretty good, not the best 30 Yemisir Wat (spicy lentil)  - the best of the whole group! We should have had two portions of this since it came in both E4 and E5 but we definitely only had one portion. Skimping out on us! 31 Kik Alicha (yellow split peas) was okay but not the best I've had 33 Gomen (Collard Greens) was bad. really bad. skip it. 37 Dinch Alicha (potato & carrots) was okay, a little too bland - we have had better. Skip it. So overall, my recommendation is #1 - Yemisir Wat followed by Doro Wat. I would also want to try Kay Wat although we didn't have it so I can't say yay or nay. No need to get a sampler platter here given that it's super hit or miss. 4) Desserts - these were terrible. Absolutely terrible. Do yourself a favor and skip them. Even though the Groupon doesn't say anything about exclusions, our server would not let us order the chocolate Diamond. I offered to pay the extra dollar (the price difference between the chocolate diamond and the next most expensive dessert) and she wouldn't have it. She wanted us to order three desserts. The House Special was terrible. Just fried chips with crappy vanilla ice cream and some hershey's chocolate drizzled over it. The Destaye was in the sambusa dough and it was SO TOUGH you could barely eat it. Not to mention the filling was terrible. 5) Ambiance - this is a big place with a couple unique pieces of furniture. They also had a guy singing, he said he's there every other Sunday night. 6) Service - slow. Confusing. She didn't tell us what each of the dishes were when she brought them out. My advice: if you go here, do not get the Groupon. This place should not be selling Groupons that highlight all of their shortcomings (sambusas and desserts). The only things you need to get from here are a couple specific entrees (not sampler platters). If you do that, you'll have a great time! *I read other reviews that said the spicy dishes are really, really spicy. I didn't find that to be true at all. They were definitely well spiced, but not anywhere near too spicy! So don't be afraid.

2014-09-02,5.0,"I was wandering around the area and decided on this place because they have a nice outdoor patio seating so our dog could sit by us. Food: We got the potato and spinach sambusas. The potato sambusa was delicious, was very hot and freshly made. The filling was mashed but well seasoned. I could have passed with the spinach version though. It was a bit bland and the spinach was fresh but almost tasted like it was boiled before stuffed in the batter. I had the chicken (doro war) which were chicken thighs in a spicy brown sauce and came with an egg.  This was SO ridiculously good and just enough kick and spice to it. Warning for those who don't like it hot/spicy, they mean spicy when they state it on the menu. My partner in crime had the Yebeg Tibs Alichia which was lamb in yellow sauce (also milder in the heat dept). It was also very good but after taking a bite of my chicken, this seemed almost bland. However, both were cooked perfectly -- tender and not overdone. The injera was also very good compared to prior experiences (I had injera elsewhere .... where it tasted a bit off-putting with the sourdough aftertaste). The lentils were meh, but I was never big fan of lentils. I loved the salad (which was almost like fresh salad on healthy leaves of green and little bit of chili), and the vegetable curry. Overall we were stuffed. Service, the manager/owner was SUPER nice, very attentive and hospitable. We were the only ones sitting outside so we were cautious that he might forget us given it was an afternoon and people kept walking in. However, he came out multiple times to check on us and refill our water cups. He also came to greet our dog, which was enjoying the calm day and sun under the table. Overall, I thought the service we received was excellent. Ambience: awesome. Inside they have more seating and what looks like a bar. They had some music and incense as well as traditional/cultural decorations that I found tasteful and not overdone. I would have sat inside if I wasn't so eager to get a tan, and wanted the company of my dog. I definitely will try to come back when I visit, although I do want to venture other places.

2014-03-23,5.0,"Anybody that knows me knows that I don't cross into the north side much. Ironically, most of my friends and even a cousin of mine currently reside there. In the last ten years, I've opened my mind to types of food that didn't involve pepperoni, hot giardiniera (what!),  and celery salt.  With that being said, I'm kind of like a pioneer to my immediate family. When I suggested to my mother that we go to an Ethiopian restaurant on the way to visit my cousin's new baby, she looked at me as if I'd grown another head.  ""Ethi-what?"" she said. ""Ethiopian...you know, African..on the eastern side. Trust me, it's amaaaazing."" The look on my mother's face was more than distrustful. To my surprise, she succumbed to the peer pressure from my wife and I. I've only tried one Ethiopian restaurant before (it was actually Erirtrean, but cut me a break, they used to be one country,) but I was already in love. We went for lunch time, guaranteeing that there would be plenty of room to eat. After all, I like to keep my elbows out! Enough with the pleasantries, le's get to it! THE GOOD:  -The service was awesome. Both servers tended to us as was needed. The young man working there explained everything patiently and with enthusiasm to our party. He was even a good sport to my teasing when I playfully grilled him on who actually made their honey-wine. When the food was brought out, he explained what was what, and made sure that we had everything we needed (napkins, water, honey-wine, injera.)  -Fooooood! My mother and I split the ""E2,"" which is a combo meat dish that has two veggie sides. My Mom was impressed with the mature and complex flavors of all of the dishes. She enjoyed the chicken and lamb portions the best, with the beef taking third place. As was I, she was mesmerized with the concept of injera.  - Honey-wine!  The best I've had yet! Yes, it's only the second one I tried, but it was smoooooth and tasty! THE BAD: Nothing, although the fatty in me wishes there were bigger portions! It fills you up for sure though.

This was our first experience with Ethiopian food, and we were really excited to try it. It was fantastic. We started off with a couple glasses of the honey wine, which was really good, but a little too sweet to drink a lot of it. We got the beef and the potato sambusas, and they were excellent. Crispy and hot, and we wanted a bunch of them. Off to a great start.. For the main course we got the spicy beef, spicy chicken, lentils, and potatos. They came out on a big round pan with a layer of the injera underneath. It also came with a side plate of extra injera. The injera was really excellent. The texture was soft and spongy and had like a sourdough taste. It went excellent with all of the items we got.  The beef was my favorite, and the lentils was probably my least favorite. The meat had a nice mild spiciness to it, and the chicken was fall of the bone tender. You can tell it had been stewed for hours. So good. It didn't seem like a lot of food at first, but there is plenty there. It didn't' take long to fill us up.  When we were done with that, they brought us out a chocolate molten cake with icecream and sang my wife happy birthday.

I mean, I knew going into it, it was a unique experience and that I would probably like it. I just didn't know how much I would actually love it. Everything at Ethiopian Diamond was spot on. The service, the food, the ambiance.  My first adventure into Ethiopian cuisine was with a group of 8 friends. Some of us had eaten at Ethiopian Diamond before, and some of us hadn't. We started out with a plate of Sambusas. Not knowing which ones to try, we got a few of each flavor. The flaky little triangles were all delicious, but the spinach and the lentil were my favorites.  As for our entrees, we asked our waiter to bring us two large plates of whatever the chef recommended. We really didn't know what was good - and wanted to try whatever the server and chef thought were best. This proved to be a good decision. We were brought two platters with a mix of veggies, chicken, beef, lamb and fish. We asked for some mild dishes and some that had a kick. I can't tell you what exactly I ate, but the lentils, collard greens, and spinach were by far my favorite. Not to mention I loved the injera. Does it look and feel like a sham-wow? Yes. Does it taste kind of like sourdough bread? Yes. Was it kind of odd using it as your utensil? Yes.  The bonus of the evening was the lava cake the server brought out because he knew it was my birthday. He made sure we didn't leave without celebrating with dessert. 5 stars on service alone.

2013-10-22,5.0,"We've been back here many, many times since my original review and I've definitely changed my tune with regard to my preference - Ethiopian Diamond is definitely my favorite Ethiopian restaurant. The service is usually excellent, the food quality is very consistent and the dishes are all delicious. The Ethiopian spiced tea is very yummy, their coffee is good though I actually prefer the Ethiopian coffee at Lalibela.  We usually get the kitfo (raw, please! the plain, gomen (collards), or garlic versions are all very tasty), doro watt (which for a while seemed terrific, but now seems more good, but not mind-blowing - not sure if that is the dish or just me) or one of the ______ alichas or tibs (their beef is good, lamb is okay and chicken is very tasty). We now often get the Shiro which is like a chickpea flour stew/gruel that is OMG DELICIOUS. We got it once when we went with some vegetarian friends and were astounded by the yumminess and added it to our repertoire since. The sides come out randomly, rather than you selecting as at Rash Dashen - we occasionally order an extra side which has given our server some confusion on occasion. All the sides are good, but our faves are the gomen (collards) and kik alicha (split peas).  There is plenty of vegetarian stuff on the menu. We've tried the shrimp/fish entrees which are alright but not something I'd really recommend as well as the Shimbra Assa (Chick Pea Fish) and Duba Watt (pumpkin). Again, they were alright but not something we've added to our regular ordering like the shiro. We don't ususally drink with dinner but their house-made honey wine is pretty tasty - kind of yeasty. I'm not sure what they've been doing over the past year or so but I think they hired some weird restaurant consultants or something. They redid a lot of their service in ways that don't really make sense to me and redesigned the restaurant to look a lot more New American than Ethiopian. We don't avoid the restaurant because of these things, but it's just kind of weird and not really a ""pro.""",0.9961,0.784,0.191,0.026,0.5390215727425027

We came in a group and ended up ordering a combo as well as several entrees. The quantity is quite limited based on how much you pay and how much is actually given.  The owners and staff were very nice, though.  I would return but there are so many cheaper and more quaint Ethiopian restaurants in the city that I would probably opt for those, though.",0.8367,0.879,0.099,0.022,0.39017857142857143
2013-09-15,2.0,"After I posted this review I went back on Yelp and clicked on the link above the reviews to sort the reviews by Date and I noticed something that I found to be interesting.  Since August 3rd if you count my review there have been 7 reviews of this restaurant and of the seven there are 5 that rated this restaurant as either 2 or 3 stars.  I will concede that 7 reviews isn't a big enough number to say with certainty that it's a sign of things declining here.  However, I do believe it's significant enough to make me wonder if maybe there have been some recent changes in this restaurant's staff that are is impacting customer satisfaction. While I can't say I've eaten at a lot of Ethiopian restaurants I have eaten at enough to know two things about Ethiopian cuisine.  First that I really love Ethiopian food and second that the flavors here while basically good overall fell short of the other restaurants I've eaten at. As far as the prices go it may have been just slightly higher than other Ethiopian restaurants I've eaten at, but not terribly bad.  For 2 meals and 2 drinks our total came to $36.  If you're planning on going and sharing a meal with another person be aware that on the menu I did read that they charge something like a 20% additional fee for the 2nd person that's sharing the meal.  Personally I don't find that to be a negative thing, but for some this might be something objectionable. The interior of the restaurant was really nice.  Both my friend and I thought it was really nice while not being overly stuffy.  As far as the restaurant interior goes I'd say this would be fine for a first date.  It is not a place that will dazzle a lady, but it's also not a place I'd be embarrassed to take a lady on a first date. The service was definitely worthy of 4 stars, so kudos for that.  There were a couple of ladies working the dining area during our lunch and both of them stopped in a couple times during the course of our meal to make sure we were doing ok.  For my comfort level it was just the perfect amount of service to make me feel like they cared but not enough to make it feel intrusive. I had the Doro Tibs which is my favorite dish in Ethiopian restaurants and my friend had the beef Tibs dish.  My chicken was good, but it lacked much flavor.  Besides the fairly bland chicken flavor in the dish the only other real flavor I could detect was the onions.  It was basically good, but realistically it tasted more like something I'd cook, I'm not a good cook so that's not a good thing, than an Ethiopian dish.  My friend's beef Tibs dish was very similar to my dish in it's blandness.  One of my favorite parts of eating Ethiopian food is the injera bread.  Unfortunately even that was a bit of a letdown.  It was basically good but just not very flavorful.  The flavor was about what I expected, but it was very subdued.  It reminded me of some injera that I'd bought in a small grocery store that was a bit of a disappointment.  Also, both my friend and I both noticed that the injera was very thin compared to what we've been served other restaurants.  Since the injera bread is basically serving as you silverware it really should be more substantial so it can hold your food more securely. So the bottom line is if you're familiar with Ethiopian food I'd say yeah stop in and see for yourself since lots of others rate this place much higher than I am rating it.  If anybody in your party has never eaten Ethiopian food then I'd say to definitely go someplace else where the flavors are more robust and a better representation of Ethiopian restaurants.  That way the first time experience will be sure to be more representative of Ethiopian flavors.",0.999,0.779,0.192,0.029,0.5295357686453578

He said it was a good variety of meat and vegetarian options especially since it was our first time. His tone of voice wasn't the friendliest, but it didn't bother me really.

We order 2 sampler dishes because (1) they can easily feed 3 people and (2) we would get one for free because of the CPR discount card.   Their food was really good (as I had remembered it) and their honey wine is awesome (I had 2 glasses of it).   Our only issue was that the host of the restaurant was really rude and curt towards us.  We told our server (who was really cool) that we had a discount card in advance and she took the card to ring up our tab.  The host came back and said that they would charge us a ""$7 sharing fee"" since we only ordered 2 sampler plates (which are huge btw) and there were 3 people at the table.  We were not told in the beginning of that fee.  We were kinda ticked because the fee defeats of the whole purpose of having a Chicago Public Radio discount card.  I've noticed in the last 2 years that many restaurants are catching up to how people are trying to save money in a lousy economy. Many restaurants will not accommodate large parties of people (this is my ranting of diners and restaurants in general) and they will no longer seat you unless your entire party arrives.  My boyfriend, who came 5 minutes early, was rushed to the bar by the rude host and he just waited for us.   A lot of places charge ridiculous fees and really just want you to ""eat and leave"".  They charge fees for ridiculous things and many places will not honor Groupon or other coupon deals.  Irksome.   The food at E.D. was excellent but the host was just really crass towards us.  Their food gets 5 stars but the host was just a turn off.

2013-02-12,5.0,"I fell in love with Ethiopian Diamond Restaurant early on when I moved to the city. I've tried other Ethiopian restaurants, and none compare. I can only speak to the vegetarian dishes, as I've never sampled the meat dishes. The taste and presentation of the food is always consistent. I have never had a ""bad"" batch of food given to me. The service is quick and friendly. The restaurant can become very busy on nights closer to the weekend, but service seems to remain the same.  The staff are very friendly and helpful if you have a dinner partner who has never had Ethiopian before or one who doesn't know the differences between one dish from another. The appetizers are excellent and always made fresh. If you run out of injera at your main course, they happily bring you more and don't charge ""extra"" for more pieces of injera. However, I've never eaten to excess, so there may be a point where they would begin charging a few extra dollars, but I just don't know. At one point, I was stopping in for carry-out on a weekly basis. Although it saves some money by not having to pay for service, be prepared to spend a little more than the usual American restaurant for a meal. However, it's definitely worth it. Sometimes I can get three to four meals out of ""E3 for one,"" which is the vegetarian sampler. A must-try is the tej (honey wine). I've tried tej in other restaurants, including NYC, and Ethiopian Diamond's tej is the best. It appears less filtered than other tejs in that it's cloudy and has a bit of sediment at the bottom. I think that it gives it more flavor, body, and visual interest, as compared to a purely clear tej.  Ethiopian Diamond's atmosphere is inviting and comfortable. It's definitely a nice place for a date if you're comfortable eating spicy food with your hands. Eating ""family style"" is a healthy experience in itself. Throughout the weekends, there are often performances, anything from a keyboardist covering a number of jazz and/or jazz-influenced pop songs, to a trio on stage.  Hands down, this is my favorite restaurant in Chicago (so far). I love it so much that I will most likely plan a party for my big 3-0 there. Another plus is that there are often Groupons readily available and other discounts (such as 20% off lunch if you bring in a takeout menu).

2013-01-19,3.0,"I think this was only the third, or maybe fourth Ethiopian restaurant I've ever been to, and the last one was quite a while ago, but I remember liking the cuisine a lot in the past, so either my palate has changed, or E.D. just wasn't knocking my socks off.  I ordered a ton of food as a sampler, intending to take home whatever I couldn't finish. First was the ""Tour of Ethiopia"" deluxe combo platter. The beef and chicken sambusas were both good, though rather small. Diamond salad, though simple was also quite good. Yebeg Tibbs Alicha was my entree, and I got spinach (Quosta) as a side.  Flavor on the Yebeg was ok, but a bit bland, and the supposedly-boneless pieces of lamb were filled with gristle and bits of bone. I estimate the entree portion contained 1.5 ounces of actual meat, which I found skimpy for the price. I normally love spinach, but their Quosta had a harsh, funky topnote, like they used an overwhelming amount of processed garlic rather than fresh, and there was also a ""dirty"" aftertaste. Oh, well, moving on to what should have been my to-go box, I sampled the E2 ""Taste of Ethiopia"". These were spicier dishes, mostly watts, so I hoped this was where the Diamond would really shine. While the sauces were more flavorful on this group, the meat again was mostly bones and gristle and the portion sizes were even smaller. Everything was kind of thrown and squashed into a Styrofoam box together, so the injera on the bottom got ruined and it was hard to tell what was what. The chicken leg was pretty good, and the boiled egg served with it was a nice touch. The lentil dish and the beef chunks were also good, bordering on very good. My second order of spinach eventually got thrown out, after it languished at home for a while with the rest of the leftovers. Service was pleasant, (I was practically the only one in the restaurant) and communication was easy, though after recommending a beer that was listed as $4 on the menu, my server charged me $5.50 for it.  I'd give the overall experience and value 3 out of 5 stars, however my friends really like this restaurant, so perhaps I just caught them on a bad day.",0.9963,0.778,0.18,0.042,0.5763124274099883

We went with our vegetarian friends, so we were ok with going vegetarian (we've had the meats before- different, but all excellent).

2012-07-16,2.0,"2/5 stars, but consider it a strong 2/5 or a weak 3/5. A lot of glowing reviews for this place. I think it's because Chicagoans have not experienced really good ""working class"" Ethiopian food, and they perhaps think that it is a very exotic (possibly gourmet?) cuisine that needs an Epcot Center ""Cuisine of the World""-style presentation. The Ethiopian Diamond makes you feel like a tourist, with the overdone decor & over-priced small portions. That being said, it's tasty food & the spacious dining room makes it an excellent location for larger groups. Don't believe the hype on the reviews -- Chicago is looking for an uptown Ethiopian place to award the ""best of"" ribbon & the Diamond is the garish obvious choice -- but enjoy it for what it is at any rate.

I'm very grateful she recommended this particular restaurant. Everything was absolutely delicious. We went vegetarian, as we are frequently wont to do. We ordered a Veggie Combo, which gave us three choices (sorry, i don't remember exactly!) and the Yemisir Watt, a spicy lentil dish. Oh boy was this delicious! We rolled injera into our hot little hands and scooped up fabulous food. We tried, oh we tried so hard, to eat it all, but it was too much for our girlish appetites. We had to take some home with us. Can't tell you about the alcohol, because we stayed sober. Such good food deserves full attention! Service was prompt and professional.

I will note however I was not able to sample any meat at Ras (due to an accompanying vegetarian friend) and I finally was able to enjoy the glory that are Ethiopian meat dishes at the Diamond. If my memory serves me correct we had the .... Kitfo (Ethiopian Steak Tartar) which was out of bounds, crazy crazy good with a bite of  the Injura and their ""cottage cheese"" (I have no idea what it's called). I *think* we had the Dinich Alicha (potatoes) for our vegetarian option and the Yebeg Watt (spicy lamb). Everything was so good it was unbelievable. All of this was served with the cottage cheese, greens and lentils atop Injura with heaps of extra Injura on the side. Every bite was perfect, savory, spicy, amazing. I love the sour of the cheese and the Injura with the creamy & spicy of the meat, greens or lentils.  A friend had their honey wine, I did not sample it but she was drinking this stuff up like it was going out of style. It was really freaking great apparently. I had a glass of wine, I chose one at random, don't remember which one but I remember it was good. The boys got some Ethiopian beer, they seemed to be unimpressed by it but it was all about the food anyway. This place was packed around 8 - 9 on a Saturday night, I was actually surprised how crazy busy it was for so ""late"" ... this just proved to me how good this place must be (is) and that all the locals know it.

I am probably influenced by my tendency not to care for dessert. Drinks, such as tea, honey wine and so on, are excellent, but they will tack on a bit to your food bill. The restaurant has a full bar.  Ambiance: I have been there twice for lunch, but never for dinner. The lunchtime ambiance is quiet and comfortable. It is rarely full and busy at lunchtime. This is an excellent destination for friends to have lunch.  Price: Food prices are quite reasonable. See the menu on their website. Portions are overly generous.

But I try.  And try I must at Ethiopian Diamond! Whether or not the food will make it safely to my mouth from the shared plate at the middle of the table will raise anyone's doubts... but what does arrive safely is completely delicious.  Gluten-free folks can call ahead to place orders of gluten-free (or black) injera. If you're a gluten-free, or mixed table, they'll be certain to serve the black injera underneath your entrees as well. This place is usually busy and LOUD. The service is usually very slow if you're here with a large party, especially if you've got separate checks-- but even if you're only a few, just getting greeted at the door might take a good, long while. I don't really mind because I absolutely need my occasional fix of gomen. There is a stage at the back of the restaurant where musical performers play instruments that I can't name.

The service is average.  Waitress only takes our order and forget  to check on you. There is a big trick about the way you should order food when you come with a friend. If you want to have the right quantity of food on your plate you should order it on separate plates NOT on one big plate. If you do not follow this rule you might realize that the place is too pricey! Atmosphere is relaxing. When I am in near by again  I might stop by again!,0.8582,0.848,0.107,0.045,0.39656084656084656

The service was poor.   The waitress only took our order and then checked on us once later.  Of course, she also brought the bill.  Otherwise, it was a man and woman serving our food and drinks.  Or just plain - no service.        ( I went with a friend, so it was just the two of us.  The place wasn't busy, since it was lunchtime on Sunday.  ) We wanted more tea, but nobody ever helped us once our food was served!!  No one ever removed used plates from our table, so I had to stack them all up and put them to the side. The bartender/another waiter kept wiping his nose or blowing his nose, but never washed his hands.  From the moment I walked in until the moment we left, there were a lot of crumbs  and garbage on the floor at the next table over.",0.2887,0.901,0.043,0.056,0.4197802197802198

Standing on its own, Diamond is an above-average place with a lot going for it. Compared to the other place, though, Diamond's portions are smaller, (slightly) more expensive, and definitely not as tasty, and you can't mix and match selections as easily. The next time I want Ethiopian, I'll go to the other place, but if Diamond was the only game in town, it'd be a good choice.",0.8994,0.805,0.166,0.029,0.5255555555555556

This place kicks every other Ethiopian restaurant's ass in Chicago, Australia and the East Bay (all of the places I have tried Ethiopian, a total of around 20 different restaurants). The bread is spongy and actually made with traditional teff flour, and the berebere chili sauce they cook everything in well seasoned and super delicious. My favorites here are the vegetarian sampler (I rock the yemsir watt--the best dish here--gomen and altkit watt) and the beef or lamb tibs. The sambusas are great, as is the sauce you dip it in (a sweet chili sauce). Service is good, but plan on waiting a bit for your food.

I've had every birthday, New Years, and celebration there because the food is always delicious, the prices are very reasonable, and the staff are friendly. And eating with your hands is fun! The injera (bread) is the foundation of the meal and the best I've had anywhere. I usually go with the teff injera--which is gluten-free, $2 extra and has to be pre-ordered. However, it has a bit more fiber than some people are accustomed to and a few friends have had a hard time digestively for a few hours afterward. I do just fine with it and have taken dozens of others there who also love it. Others, like my SO, just prefer the taste of the sourdough injera it comes with better. If you're not gluten-free, I'd recommend ordering a little of both for your first time and seeing how you like both options.  The ""stews"" are amazing. I just discovered you can order some of the vegetable as sides, which seems to be a good value. The red lentils and the spinach and okra veggie dishes are my favorites, but I've tried them all and have yet to find one I dislike.

We had a great time at another nearby Ethiopian restaurant, so we were looking to vary our experiences and perhaps taste some new dishes. This restaurant was a large rectangle, filled with a number of groups enjoying a lively Friday night dinner with plenty of adult libations and good food. There is great art on the walls to provide a particular utopian perspective of African every day scenes. Towards the rear of the dining room there is a riser with musical instruments where a very talented musician played a tribal fusion sort of music, aided by pre-recordings and adding his own beats, harp, or horn accompaniment. The dishes were pretty much the same as in the other restaurant, and served in a shareable platter over injeera. Delicious accompaniments came with our three entree choices: kik alicha (split peas in onion and ginger sauce), yatkilt watt (string beans, carrots, and potatoes), and yebeg watt (spicy, bone-in lamb). Our eyes were bigger than our stomachs, and yet we enjoyed almost every delicious handful. Some leftovers had us hanging our heads down in shame. For our beverages I chose an ethiopian pot of tea (fresh made so be prepared to wait a little0 that comes with a small glass to drink it from, and a sugar container so you can get it as sweet as you want it. He chose one of the Ethiopian beers (I forgot the name!). For dessert we shared a destaye (my happiness): a triangular pastry with a very thing filling, surrounded by a number of fried pastry squares, topped with whipped cream and some chocolate sauce drizzle. Delicious and just a nice way to top off a nice dinner. Towards the back of the dining room there are two ladies restrooms, a public wash basin/sink for washing up your hands after eating, and a gents' restroom. We were entertained not only by the musician, but by the comedy of errors of a nearby table of a 20-somethings triple-date. They ordered two incredibly large bottles of average wine (a red and a white) to go with their meal.

We started out with three orders of sambusa: Lentil, spinach and potato and carrot.  Of these, only the spinach seemed a little on the greasy side, but went well with the lemon.  We ordered three entrees: the shiro was flavorful, creamy and thick, with just enough spice to contrast with the soft, sour injera.  Dinich alicha was also perfectly spiced and fresh.  The doro watt, which the restaurant warns is spicy, is actually really spicy (a little too much for me, but my friend, who is a spice fiend, thought it was just right.)    The three dishes were served communal style on a large pizza-like platter, along with multiple side dishes, including a vinegar-flavored salad, yellow lentils, red lentils and collard greens.  After eating our way through the first round, we odered extra injera to scoop up the sauce-soaked remnants on the tray.  Before tip, the total bill came around $43 for three people, a bargain, given how stuffed we were.  I felt so guitly about using the Groupon that I ordered extra food to go.    I hear that they opened a second location in Rogers Park, which I have not tried; if only they would open a location downtown.   P.S.  It's definitely better to go with a large group of people, but only if you are okay with sharing.",0.9959,0.808,0.173,0.019,0.4671758166076348

2011-04-06,5.0,"So for the past several months I've been getting cravings... for Ethiopian food. I have no idea why, aside from the fact that it's delicious. Anyway, Ethiopian Diamond is so close to me that I end up giving into these cravings often.  While they do offer takeout I find the dining in experience to be fun. There's nothing like sharing a giant plate of food that you eat with your hands with a friend. Plus, if they're nice friends they let you sample their food!  On my first trip I stayed strictly vegetarian, and it was good. I had heard that the lamb here was fantastic though, and while I'm not a huge lamb fan I thought I would give it a go. Yeah, it's really freakin tasty here. Actually, everything here is really freakin tasty. I have yet to try a dish that i wasn't a fan of. But the lamb, yum!  The service has always been prompt and friendly, and a couple of months ago they did something great. I paid via credit card, wrote in the tip, and then wrote the total in. Yeah, I added another $10 to the total which would have been double the tip I intended to leave. Since it was my own idiot move I never called or made a fuss, let them have the extra $10. Well, as it turns out they charged my card for the correct amount and were kind enough to ignore my poor adding. I thought that was a stand-up thing to do and now when I go I tend to leave larger tips.",0.978,0.745,0.166,0.089,0.5533333333333333
2011-04-06,5.0,"So I joined Kate W. for my virgin voyage into the wonderful world of Ethiopian cuisine last night and I am ~so~ glad I tried Ethiopian Diamond! As most people have already written, Ethiopian food is served on a community platter.  Each dish is arranged on a large piece of bread - I apologise for not remembering the names of anything but the bread basically looks like a giant, thin, spongy pancake.  The only prevailing flavour is sort of lemon-y, which really complements the dishes quite nicely! I chose a chicken dish served ""watt"" (spicy) with a side of a potato,carrot combination (it tasted a bit like aloo gobi, if you've ever had that).  Kate had lamb with a side order of lentils.  Kate encouraged me to try a bite of her food.  Now here's the thing:  I do *not* like lamb.  Just... no.  No.  After a little cajoling and assuring me that she doesn't usually like lamb either, I tried a teeny, tiny bite.  Confession:  I felt a little like the guy in ""Green Eggs and Ham""... 'Say, I do like lentils and lamb! I do! I like them, Sam-I-Am!' I'm a little embarrassed to admit this but here goes:  I actually uttered the word ""foodgasm"" during the meal.  Back off, man, this shizz was unbelievably good!

So I was very happily surprised when I came to Ethiopian Diamond and really really loved the food. I love communal eating, and this place is the embodiment of it. We came here with a bunch of people we didn't know very well, and the style of eating definitely encourages everyone to get along and dig into each others food without feeling awkward. I was with my significant other, so we did one of the samplers. I can't recall exactly what 3-4 dishes it came with, but there was a spicy lamb dish that was by far my favorite from our order. My favorite thing I tasted that night however was someone else's beef tartare with garlic. It sounded a little out there, but it was amazing and I think everyone was secretly jealous they hadn't been brave enough to order it.  We had a big group of 9 people and were seated quickly, so it's definitely easy to bring a lot of people here. The atmosphere is nice, they had someone playing a variety of traditional instruments.

2011-03-19,1.0,"So, so, sad... I LOVE Ethiopian food. The warmth of the spices reminds me of soul food---but a lot healthier.  :)  I've seen a few reviews that were upset at the texture of the injera...but that's just how injera is: spongy, soft, with a slight savory tartness to it if its good. Myself and my boyfriend went here 3 times over a period over two months (November/December 2010) and were EXTREMELY disappointed. But allow me to start from the beginning...this does get long (as we had really terrible experiences) however if you want one experience to read, please check out our last outing in late December. TERRIBLE. Early November outing  - We went on a Friday night and they were packed! The hostess said that it might be a while for a table and we were okay with waiting. Twenty minutes later she asks ""Oh! Did you want a traditional table? We always have some of those available."" Wait, you mean to tell me you had a table open and you didn't even offer it to us when we walked in? FAIL. Traditional Ethiopian table (which was beautiful and colorful!) versus waiting for another table to open up? Hmmm...aren't you one smart cookie?  When we were finally seated, I asked the waitress how the pricing of main dishes and sides worked and what came with a meal. She didn't even know!!! After she took our order she vanished as quick as a guy caught on Cheaters, hardly ever to been seen again for the rest of the night---of embarrassment I hope.  During the 40 minute wait for our food, my boyfriend noticed that the water glasses of the couple next to us were different from ours---which was different from the set of water glasses at the table behind us. Not a huge deal but it just looked tacky. After contemplating getting up and leaving, our food finally arrived. IT WAS WONDERFUL, however overpriced. Most Ethiopian places offer a main dish with two sides for somewhere around $11. At this place the sides came separately and were $3 each extra! Geez! After waiting another 10 minutes after eating to have my credit card charged, we left. We actually chalked the whole thing up to them being crowded and promised to come back later, when there were less people... ...MIS-TAKE... Early December outing -We went here praying for better service (since there was not a crowd)...alas, not to be.  Our female server (who I was told was the owner's sister by my bf) took our order. After beginning to eat we needed napkins. It took us 15 minutes to get her attention and we didn't see her at all after that. After we finally got the bill we left disappointed again with the service.  ""Maybe another time?"" We said.. Late December outing -This was the last straw. When we arrived and were seated we noticed a heat lamp on the table behind us? Why??? Because it was FREEZING! The owner (and TERRIBLE waiter for the evening) apologized for the cold because the heat was shut off. That should have been our first sign to bow out. I don't know about anyone else, but to me, COLD RESTAURANT = CLOSED FOR THE NIGHT. And what the hell was one little desktop heat lamp going to do for that huge restaurant???? But let me continue.... We ordered our overpriced food, and when it came we happily began to devour it. However the server had given us two measly little rolls of injera that we polished off in two seconds. After having to flag the guy down, he promised to bring out more injera in hurry---which was 15 minutes later. Mind you, this is 15 minutes of me and my bf staring at each other waiting to eat in a cold restaurant. We finally flag him down again and he brings us two more measly rolls of injera for the smorgasbord of 6 different stews and a salad we had in front of us (normally needing 6-8 rolls of injera), before he could run away, we asked for more injera. At this point he tells us that he would have to charge us for extra injera. WHAT????? We had been to several Ethiopian restaurants several times and had NEVER been charged for extra injera. We said no thanks and continued to eat our now cold food.  After we finished we awaited for SOMEONE, anyone to give us our bill. After waiting another 15 minutes and seriously considering just leaving to see if anyone would notice, the guy arrives with bill. We paid with exact change, no tip, and RAN as fast as we could go, you know, with the ice slowly building around the place and all. Maybe I'll try this place again...in 6 months and see if its better. But with the wide assortment of Ethiopian restaurants in Chicago and Evanston, I don't think so.

Vietnamese, Thai, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Indian, really, if it's from the Asian continent, I'll pretty much eat it without question. But it gets old. Without question, 75-80% of my meals are some form of Asian cuisine and while I love it, I needed something DIFFERENT. I wanted something tasty, warm, homey, comforting, and still a little spicy because I'm from the South and I don't live a day without hot sauce. On my way home from Office Hours I knew what I was craving: Ethiopian. Okay. So maybe my first foray into Ethiopian, a good 6 years ago, didn't end so well. Suffice it to say that I ate something that texturally didn't agree with me and I had to pay my bill, go home, and lie down right away. Not fun. But it wasn't the fault of the cuisine or the people, only my sorry excuse for a mouth, so I wanted to try again, and by virtue of proximity, Ethiopian Diamond was to be the redeemer of this great food. Being partially filled up on Office Hours croissants, my girlfriend and I shared the vegetarian sampler. We chose kik alicha, quosta, and dinich alicha, plus a side of shimbra assa. It came out quickly (really quickly) and hot and delicious. I mean, this was it, what I'd been both afraid of and mesmerized by for years, and it was perfect. Every single thing I tried was incredible, even the tiny tomato salad on the side. I quickly mastered the use of injera and got my eat on, and I was so pleased. The food was authentically African but I couldn't help being reminded of my childhood and traditional Southern food. I wonder how much influence Ethiopian food has had on soul food in the Southeast. Probably more than people realize. Now, I've been craving Ethiopian all week and wanted to try all of the other places in town, not to mention the other various African cuisines this city has.

Vegetarian platter was pretty amazing and sambusa was also quite good, love the texture of minced meat and vegetable. Injera and kay wat (lean beef meat in spicy sauce) were exceptional. For beginners, combos is a great way to start as you get to try different things from chicken, beef, lamb to vegetable. Oh and don't look for silverware, you gotta get your hands dirty!

I'm proud to say my first meal was at Ethiopian Diamond, and somewhat bummed that I won't eat there again until 2012. Overall the other reviews were spot on.  We split the Vegetarian Taste of Ethiopia. It was delicious, colorful, well spiced, packed with flavor, and just plain fun to eat. The injera almost had a slight tangy taste that I hadn't had with other injera, but it was a good thing. It paired perfectly with the Hakim Stout, especially this time of year. Live subtle jazz floated through the air from the back of the restaurant as an eager to please staff bustled about topping off your water and bringing you more bread.  Someone tipped them off that it was my birthday. They stuck a candle in my dessert and kicked off the birthday song which was accompanied by other guest joining in the singing... embarrassing but overall a great experience.",0.9791,0.79,0.18,0.031,0.45510204081632655
2011-01-05,5.0,"I used to eat at Ethiopian Diamond nearly every other week. Many, many delicious vegan options. Sharing the serving dish and eating with one's hands makes Ethiopian dining an intimate experience. Even large groups of my friends have been accommodated here. I usually get either the Veggie Combo or the vegetarian ""Taste of Ethiopia"". For the first, you choose three items from their list (I pick spicy lentils, split peas and collard greens); for the later you get five set items: chickpea ""fish"", spicy lentils, split peas, collard greens, cabbage & carrots, and potatoes & carrots. I will order one or the other based on my appetite. Either way, it is a lot of food. I usually can eat all the actual dishes but never quite have the room for all the injera (bread) underneath. The sambusa appetizers are very much like samosas; there are potato/carrot, lentil and spinach vegan ones. I stopped ordering them because the entree is more than enough to stuff me. Not so much a fan of the Hakim Stout they have. It's a very sweet dark beer. They have other beers in bottles, as well as their honey wine (which may or may not be considered vegan, depending on your views).

2011-01-05,5.0,"LOVED it! I haven't been to an Ethiopian restaurant in quite a while, and never in Chicago. So I was excited to see that Ethiopian Diamond had such great reviews, and I was in the mood for some serious ethnic cuisine, and this fit the bill. First off, there is A LOT to choose from on this menu. They have all kinds of meat (lamb, beef, steak, chicken) and a nice array of seafood options as well as vegetarian. We decided on a sampler menu, either ""taste of Ethiopia"" or ""tour of Ethiopia"", the tour being a bit more extensive and expensive ($19 vs. $16 for the taste). The ""tour"" is also only available with meat as they were not able to substitute with seafood or veggie. So, since I knew nothing about anything on the menu and what it actually was, I decided to put my trust in the experts and opted for the vegetarian ""taste of Ethiopia"". And I was not disappointed! It came with lentils, a couple of potato dishes, chickpeas, and some kind of collard green. Everything on the taste was absolutely delicious, I only wish I had enough room in my tummy to finish it! That sponge bread really fills you up, and they give you more if you run out, with no extra charge (I don't think). We also ordered the sambusa. I ordered spinach and lentil. My favorite by far was the lentil sambusa but the spinach was excellent as well. Lastly, we finished off our meal with some Ethiopian coffee. Very tasty and a nice way to end our experience there. The staff is all very friendly and the space is absolutely huge, so would be a great place to bring any size of group. They also have what I believe is a full bar and there was a little stage in the back, which leads me to believe they offer musical performances on certain days. Highly recommended, and because it's in Uptown, there is plenty of parking. Looking forward to coming back and trying more authentic Ethiopian cuisine.",0.994,0.838,0.154,0.008,0.5845681063122924

Easy street parking and no wait to be seated. I got a variety (tour) and enjoyed it. We were a bit disappointed with the slow service- both in coming around to take our order then again after the food arrived when we asked for some extra things on the side. We made a point of not starting to eat until it arrived which was over 5 minutes. That seemed a little unrealistic as they weren't extremely busy/crowded. In the end it was a good experience.

We may vary some of the veg, but as long as the red lentils and collard greens are included, I'm so very happy. The Shimbra ASSA (that's the chick pea faux fish in a rich, flavorful, spicy sauce I could eat with a spoon) is the star. I think of it as Ethiopian falafel. Yemisir Watt is the spicy red lentils, deeply colored, almost creamy when scooped up with its spicy robe of flavor. The gomen is sensational collard greens, mild, but with a little kick of garlic. Tonight, we rounded out the platter with Kik Alicha, mild yellow split peas and Dinich Alicha, potatoes and carrots in a mild but tasty sauce. We warmed up as soon as we came in with a pot of their hot tea, it's reminiscent of Constant Comment, for those who remember that spiced, orange-scented tea. And while I don't normally sweeten my drinks, just a 1/2 tsp. or so of sugar mellowed the flavors nicely. Service was attentive and warm, our water glasses were filled regularly, more injera was offered and we were urged to take the flavor-infused injera home.",0.977,0.886,0.114,0.0,0.5477272727272727

2010-11-19,2.0,"We've eaten there for the second time now, and at the other Ethiopian restaurants in the area a few good times, and I have to say this has been the worst Ethiopian I have experienced ever. The first time we were there it was not as bad. This time however, it was not satisfactory. The beef in the sambusas was practically tasteless. The spinach side dish, I am 100% positive, came from a frozen Green Giant entrée- it has the exact same color and taste. And the meat, oh my god the meat...maybe they just had a bad day, maybe they bought something old, I do not know. And no, just because something was cooked on a skillet, not in a pot is not an excuse for it to be as hard to chew on as a sole of a shoe (not that I ever tried, but I do imagine that's how much fun it is). It's just like going to a good steakhouse and hearing: ""Well, you've ordered your steak well-done, now you have to just live it down an chew on it forever"". No, that's not how it works. I've had the exact same dishes at the other places and they were never like that. They did bring us other things to try for free to make it better, but we still got the attitude like we just do not know what we are talking about, and it is our first time at an Ethiopian restaurant (which it was not), and it was our fault for not knowing what we are ordering (which was not true- we dine Ethiopian at least once every two weeks). The food is also not as spicy as in all the other places, which may be a plus to some, but is a bad thing for us. The only thing I can have no complaints about is the hot tea- very well brewed with some excellent spices. Ethiopian cuisine is our favorite, right next to Indian, and we've checked out all the places possible on the North side. I'm sorry to say that, I don't like being negative about things, I'd rather just try to eat what's in front of me, pay and just never go back to places, which disappoint me. This time however, it was too much, especially compared to other places. It was more expensive, with very limited options for the combination plates, it provided less sides than other places do when you get a combination plate, and the serving sizes were smaller.  Sorry, not going back there, I'll stick to the places a few blocks south on Broadway, which names I will not mention just out of respect, but they are easy to find.",0.992,0.794,0.141,0.065,0.49059833928254987
2010-11-14,4.0,"So far, this is the best Ethiopian restaurant I have been to in Chicago.  In fact, this is probably the best Ethiopian I have ever had period.  I had my go-to spot back in San Fran (Waziema) that served up my favorite Ethiopian, but I had yet to find a place like that in Chicago until I dined at E-Diamond last night. The only other Ethiopian place I had been to in Chi was Demera, which was good, but not nearly is good as Diamond IMO.  Diamond has a vast selection of entrees to choose from.  Of course if you go Ethiopian you've gotta go family style, so we got the Kitfo Na Gomen, Doro Tibs, and Yebeg Tibs Watt.  Everything was very well portioned and tasted phenominal.  I'd never had anything like the Kitfo dish before, which is ground beef mixed with their homemade cheese (tasted similar to goat cheese to me).  It was awesome.  The lamb was nice and spicey just like we ordered it, and the chicken definitely hit the spot as well. Another plus for this place was a chill little jazz band playing in the back of the restaurant.  Apparently they play every Fri and Sat night, which adds a nice touch to the place.  It's a pretty spacious restaurant too, so even though it was crowded, you didn't feel too cramped.  Oh, and they have a full bar equipped with a nice variety of Ethiopian beer.  If you're a dark beer fan (like myself) you can't go wrong with the Hakim Stout.  Also, their Bedele beer was really good (nice malty flavor). All in all was very impressed with the place.  I've eaten at maybe 4 Ethiopian restaurants prior to this one, but I'd never had food better than Ethiopian Diamond.  They got a lot of creative entrees and everything I  had was delicious.  Throw in a live jazz band and it's official for me: best Ethiopian restaurant I have ever been to.  Good stuff.",0.9986,0.722,0.27,0.008,0.6173423423423424

We all wanted to try different things on the menu, but some don't like spicy and some loved spicy and of course we didn't want to go crazy and over-order food either. Our server suggested the Tour of Ethiopia option. Each person receives two sambusas, garden salad and one entree. The group then gets 2 sides to share as well.  All the food is served together on a large piece of Injera bread. If you're like me, the injera that's left on the platter that soaked up the juices from the entrees really is the tastiest part of the meal. But until then, you're given plenty of injera bread to tear up, scoop up your meat or veggie with the injera and eat. No utensils here (except for the salad--they placed forks on the table for that.)  The server suggested 2 chicken, 2 lamb and 2 beef entrees. I'm sorry I can't tell you which was a tibs, watt or alicha preparation as our server offered to choose the entrees for us as he promised a great variation for us to try. The food was good, but it wasn't bursting with flavor as I had hoped. The dishes our server said was spicy, had a little heat but not enough for me to call ""spicy"". The spinach and lentil sides were good, but like our entrees, not as flavorful as I've had at other Ethiopian restaurants.  I really liked the sambusa--crispy puffs stuffed with your choice of beef, chicken, potato, lentil or carrot. Well prepared and flavorful.

The only comparable dish I can liken it to is Indian samosas only different in taste but absolutely delicious. The main course is served on one large platter that is shared by everyone. The platter is covered with a layer of injera bread which is a kind of spongy, slightly tangy bread that is very soft. There is extra injera rolled up on the side which is used to pick up the various dishes served on the platter. I personally could live off of the injera alone - it's that good. There are various dishes or combinations you can order made up of chicken, meat, vegetables, etc. Some are very spicy and others not but everything I have had so far has been fantastic.  I usually take home the left-over injera bread and it is delicious the next day.

2010-09-20,5.0,"Simply the best Ethiopian food in Chicago, at least on the vegetarian/pescatarian side of things.  Though I have noticed that the quality of certain dishes can sometimes fluctuate, the fluctuation is between ""amazingly delicious"" and ""religious experience"".  Every single dish on the fish and veggie menus is a safe bet, but the Shiro (a sublime paste of sorts made from various ground beans and seeds, spices and shallots), Quosta (spinach with hints of garlic and ginger and perhaps other ingredients that dropped straight from heaven), and Yemisr Wat (a red lentil dish with an incredibly subtle berbere sauce) are absolutely essential.  The injera bread is always warm and serves as the perfect compliment to every dish, and the various Ethiopian lagers and Ethiopian honey wine complete the picture. The portions, while sometimes seeming a bit small when your dish arrives, always turn out to be more than enough (this is especially the case if you order an appetizer of spinach or lentil sambusas--a filled pastry much like an Indian samosa); if I clean the plate it is only because the deliciousness of the food overrides my stomach's protestations.  That injera is filling (and super healthy--it's made from teff, one of the most nutrient-rich grains in the world) stuff! The prices are all very reasonable; I've rarely spent more than $20--tip included--on a full meal there. As other reviewers have noted, the restaurant is basically a very large box and thus could easily be a very unpleasant place to dine, but somehow Ethiopian Diamond manages to always feel warm, intimate and welcoming.  One big part of the equation is the exceptionally friendly ownership and waitstaff.  In this area there is no fluctuation at all; it is the most consistently friendly service (and *genuinely* friendly, not plastic friendly) I have experienced.  I also love eating at one of their traditional woven tables; the giant dish that everybody's meals are served on (over a giant pancake of injera bread) fits perfectly into the concave top of the circular tables.  The place just has a really good feeling to it. On Friday nights there is live music, and if you're lucky you will catch a one-man band performance of the legendary Kelan Phil Cohran, who performed back in the day with Sun Ra and helped form the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians in the '60s.",0.998,0.778,0.205,0.016,0.5692857142857143

You can't go wrong with one of the combo options (you will likely waste time and money trying to work out your order a la carte.)  I'm crazy for the kifto, as it handily satisfies my periodic fleischeslust.   If you're down with raw meat, make sure you try it. If you haven't had Ethiopian food before, you should know this: the vegetables are mushy.  Delicious, but mushy.  This is not the place to get crisp, steamed broccoli. The full bar is a plus, though I warn you that the plum wine is as sweet as it sounds.  I recommend going for the beer instead. Ready for the kicker?  Ethiopian Diamond is the only place I have found that will give or sell me mitmita, the deep red, cayenne-looking hot spice used in many of their dishes and served on the side with every order.  I always make a special request for mitmita  as I leave, and I have always been met with a gracious and generous response.  Having mitmita on your spice shelf is well worth the momentary awkwardness it takes to get it. There is something inherently happy about the scene at Ethiopian Diamond.  Perhaps it's the expanse of traditional decor, perhaps it's the way the Ethiopian community gathers there while creating a welcoming atmosphere for others.  It's a feel-good place regardless. I'd make my way up to Ethiopian Diamond more often if the check didn't add up so quickly.  It really does.  I've always found my experience worth it, but the bill still stings a little.   Try it out.  Revel in its uniqueness, and if you like spice, ask for extra mitmita!",0.9966,0.759,0.209,0.032,0.5796185296185298
2010-08-26,4.0,"I'm not too adventurous an eater but this night I was willing to try my first Ethiopian restaurant ...and boy, was it a hit!  I trusted the owner's recommendation ... and went with the Toro Tibs Watt, otherwise known as white-meat chicken chunks in a spicy sauce.  While the spice got to me at first, I not only gobbled it down, but enjoyed the remainder for lunch the next day.  The bread is both funky, playful and worked perfectly with the meal, which was accompanied by yellow split peas.  I even enjoyed what I assume is a more ""American"" salad on the side, the lettuce and accompaniments were very fresh and lightly dressed.   Since I was almost the only customer in the place at the time, the owner kibitzed with me at the bar (where I sat to eat) the whole time, which was a delight.  For dessert, I talked her into adding a little of ""my happiness"" in the House Special -- which was a huge hit with me and her.   Although the total tab for 1, with 2 glasses of regular merlot, was a bit pricy ($38), I will definitely go back when I'm feeling a bit flush and order the same thing over again (did I say I wasn't an adventurous eater)?-",0.9933,0.77,0.206,0.024,0.5269965631076742

Everything was WONDERFUL! The injera was nice and spongy (not too vingear-y like some places I've encountered) and the food was hot and delicious.  I think the one thing I didn't love is that my favorite Ethiopian place (I'm avoiding names... but it's just down the street) allows you to pick two sides with each entree. So, say you got the doro watt, you could have picked the lentils and split peas as your sides and it would have been cheaper than having to order the vegetarian sampler like we had to do here at Diamond.

2010-06-19,5.0,"This is our (my bf and I) favorite Ethiopian restaurant in Chicago, and we've been to most of the known places. I am giving the place 5 stars, but if I could give half-points I would give them a 4.5. Although meals here are a bit pricier than other Ethiopian places in the neighborhood, the portions are generous and the food is totally worth it. FOOD PROS: The food here is excellent, a good balance between the feel of something home-cooked and something with restaurant quality. Unlike many other places, the food is served very warm (if you're getting cold vegetarian items, not counting the salad, you came on an off-day). I recommend getting a combo plate for your first visit, so that you could taste a number of the items and figure out your favorites -- each place has its own recipes. Their YE-MISIR-WAT is my favorite item -- this red lentil dish is much more moist than most other places serve it, and as a result the sauce really seeps into the injera bread and transforms the taste in a great way. The collard greens GOMEN dish is good, as is the cabbage-and-carrots dish TIKEL GOMEN. I haven't tried a lot of the meat items, but the chicken and beef TIBS (strips of meat, well cooked) are very simple and very delicious -- I can't get enough of them. They cook everything in vegetable oil, which is nice. The desserts, one of which is a small chocolate cake surrounded by deep-fried sweet dough and whipped cream, tasted really strange to me at first, but grew on me until it was difficult not to order them all the time. FOOD CONS: I am not a fan of the appetizer SAMBOSAS, which are small and pricy. Among the vegetarian dishes, I think the yellow lentil dish KIK ALICHA lacks the rich flavor of the other items on the menu, and I find that the spinach dish QUOSTA has a strange greasy after-taste. Their Ethiopian honey-wine is so-so: it tastes too much like sweet fermented juice, not enough wine or honey.  Lastly, the injera bread is made with half teff-flour and half wheat-flour. Most places do that, but it makes your meal much less gluten-free than authentic Ethiopian food can be. I have once been served fridge-cold injera bread, which was terrible, but I think it was an off-day and this hasn't happened since. SERVICE: The service is very polite and speedy, but disinterested. You often get this vibe from the waiter that he or she would much rather be chatting with their acquaintances (people who always seem to be around, at the bar or one of the tables) than talking to me. No matter how often my boyfriend and I come here, they never recognize us or at least never show that they do. But I'm fine with that, as long as the service isn't bad, and it never has been. Finally, a CAUTION to vegans and the health-cautious: ask your waiter whether the dishes include clarified butter (niter kibbeh), a staple of most Ethiopian cuisine. Just because something is cooked in oil doesn't mean it didn't have clarified butter included into the actual sauce. I have a suspicion that their dishes include this obvious staple, but never asked.",0.9958,0.829,0.135,0.036,0.5166390306122447

2010-04-01,4.0,"I was really psyched to go to this place after reading the reviews and mostly due to their willingness to make specialty ""Black Injera"" which is a 100% Teff version of the Injera. This is a great accommodation for Gluten-Free and Celiac afflicted foodies who yearn to appreciate ethnic cuisine unrestricted and unmodified. I called ahead to insure they could make Black Injera for me and my party (three separate times to be positive) that night and to triple insure that it was really 100% wheat/flour/gluten free. I was assured each time that they could make that for me with no problem at all.  Upon arrival, they did in fact deliver the Black Injera as promised, although they neglected to admit beforehand that they would charge us a total of $6 dollars for making the specialty Injera. A reasonable charge, but annoying nonetheless since they didn't decide to tell me until I had ordered. In my opinion, that was not too honest since at this point I could not change my mind. The two of us ordered the meat sampler that came with 5 samplings. 1 spinach 1 lentil, 1 lamb, 1 chicken, 1 beef. It was all very tasty. I was surprised how flavorful the spinach dish was. The Black Injera was spot on and was hardly any different from standard Injera that I have tried elsewhere. I highly recommend the spicy chicken, it was by far our favorite. In the end we were very satisfied with our food but found it difficult to understand how a sampler plate and Injera (no drinks or extras) added up to $50! Mathematically it figured out, but in our opinion it was a lot to pay for some relatively very simple dishes that literally only fed two, no leftovers. Lentils, spinach, and dark meat chicken are some of the least expensive items at any grocery store. So if your looking for some good Ethiopian food, you wont be let down by this place, just come prepared to pay a pretty penny for the comforting and upscale atmosphere. Other notable features: Easy street parking, very clean and presentable restaurant, nice decor and atmosphere and attentive service.

I also highly recommend the honey wine.  So sweet, but it still packs a punch.   Responding to Lousie's comment, every time I've been here and we've ordered meat and vegetarian dishes, the wait staff has asked whether to bring them on one plate or separate plates.  I don't think it's fair to give the restaurant two stars because you're unfamiliar with how Ethiopian food is served.",0.9926,0.758,0.23,0.012,0.6139999999999999

We went with a group of 11 people and service was pretty good with how busy it was.  My Fiance ordered the St. George beer, recommended by the waitress, it was very smooth and light. I ordered the honey wine which was pretty good, but not fantastic.  For our entrees, we ordered the Tour of Ethiopia which consists of an appetizer, entree and sides. We got the Lentil and Potato and Carrot Sambusa for the appetizer, the Doro Tibs Watt for the entree (spicy chicken) and Ordinich Alicha for the side. We also ordered the lemon Tilapia which wasn't that great. It was a whole fried fish that tasted bland and I would not order that again. I can go to the Uni-Mart in Schaumburg for fried Tilapia. The chicken however was fantastic. You scoop it up with your hands with the Injera (Ethiopian Bread) - looks like a white crepe but has a sour light pancake taste to it. It totally complemented the chicken and side dishes.  The only bad thing about this restaurant is the menu. They should offer better descriptions or even pictures so that you can get a better ideal of what you are ordering.  They do pile on the food on one big serving dish, so if you are a vegetarian, I would highly recommend that you ask for your food to be separated just for yourself.

My dining companions and I started out with a Sambusas of each type.  I tried the lentil, and the spinach and both were very tasty.  I was a little weary of biting into them because it was difficult to tell which ones had meat in them, and which did not.  We all liked the sauce that these were served with. For my entrée I ordered the Yatakilt Watt, and this is where my dinning experience takes a turn for the worse.  The two men that I was out with both ordered the Kitfo (Ethiopian Steak Tartar), which is fine I am okay to be at the same table with people eating meat... but when the food came out, all three of our meals were served on one large plate.  So on either side of my vegetarian portion, sat two piles of raw-looking beef.  I was totally disgusted, and worried that the meat juices would leak toward my food.  The meat on the plate made me anxious and uncomfortable, so I ate less than two bites of my dinner, due to loss of appetite.  :(  THIS COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED!  Now, I realize that I should have asked about the serving procedure beforehand, and requested that mine be served on a separated dish. What I tasted of the food was  good, I just couldn't get over the meat on the plate.   I feel bad giving this restaurant a negative review, especially because it seems to be so well loved by the Yelp community.  So, I am being very honest when I say that all of my issues with the Ethiopian Diamond were my own fault...

In the intervening time, I had a great window seat and enjoyed watching the world pass by on Broadway. My wooden chair was ornate a comfortable. The table was large, the dining room is gigantic (complete with long bar and band space) and the bathrooms are super clean!! That's a HUGE plus with me. The Diamond is located in a fantastic stretch of Edgewater. I had never been to this part of the neighborhood. I greatly enjoyed the tree-lined streets and big houses. If you're looking for a homey atmosphere while you're in the thick of the city, you might look up Edgewater. PSA over. The food: So delicious. I ordered the E4 and subbed out beef for more lamb. The meat was flavorful, tender and extremely easy to eat only with fingers and bread. I had forgotten how similar Ethiopian veggies are to soul food. The cabbage and greens would have been as at home at Army & Lou's as they were on my plate. I'd also forgotten that the table's order comes on one gigantic metal plate. I am an only child. Sharing was something that took time for me to learn. In primal situations, I forget how to do it. When I am eating delicious food and others have access to it...sometimes...things happen. Sorry for the attempted fork stabbing, friend. Look at it this way: you have really fast reflexes. That's a good thing I helped you discover. The Diamond helped me discover that I can't wait years to have another helping of this delicious food. Who wants to come with? I promise, no attempted stabbings.",0.9978,0.762,0.199,0.039,0.6067687074829935

Very good. :) Yes, you do eat with your hands. They have napkins though... And they do provide the disposable wet naps after the meal (as opposed to warm wet towels -- not very eco-friendly, are they?).

I usually don't go knuckles deep into my food with people on the first dinner.  B. I like a little more variety among meals... like when you order a meal and it has several sides. I get that it's meant to share and they do have a veggie sampler option where you can choose 3 of their select veggie options but I don't know... some sort of something different would have been cool. Next time I'll be a little daring, get something spicy and some apps to satisfy my side cravings.  C. I want to recommend they serve the food on something other than a stainless steel plate for the food but I don't know if that's tradition or not.

2009-09-29,5.0,"Myth #3018 about Ethiopian cuisine: Ethiopians are not technologically advanced enough to take reservations at their restaurants.  The group who wins a machete fight in the waiting area is seated first. Fact #1 about Ethiopian Diamond restaurant: You can make reservations online in advance for this particular restaurant.  Absolutely no knifeplay required.  In fact, since like at almost all Ethiopian places you eat with your hands, there are no knives outside the kitchen. Planning Veggie Supper Club is often a challenge.  There have been some months with up to a 75% flake rate.  Some people say vegetarians are picky eaters.  I saw that's not true, but we are apparently very fickle diners who decide at a moment's notice they don't want a particular restaurant.  The September dining excursion was not an exception.  Our reservation for 20 quickly became 10 in about a 24 hour period.  Ethiopian Diamond, used to large groups did not even bat an eye and managed to adjust on the fly (which as I stated in an earlier Ethiopian restaurant review is not a side dish of this cuisine - neither, for that matter are bats or eyes) and made the dining experience one of the easiest yet. Like most Ethiopian places, Ethiopian Diamond serves large groups family style on a giant piece of injera (sponge bread used similarly to Indian naan) that ends up closely resembling an artist palette (the color range of Ethiopian food is second to none).  And like most other Ethiopian places, you can order a combo to experiment with the full range of flavors and textures ($11.25 for three choices is a bit more pricey than some Ethio places but the portions are large). But there is one difference that's the only one that matters - Ethiopian Diamond is the biggest and best place in the city (that's just my opinion but I'm sticking to it).  The injera's just a little bit spongier and more savory, the gomen's (collared greens) just a little more tangy, the dinich alicha (potato cubes and carrots) is the best in the city.  The plaques on the wall don't lie. Though I'm surprised no one's eaten them yet.  The rapidity that the food disappears here borders on insane. Luckily, no one was harmed in the quick devouring of all of the delicious choices.  But probably only because none of us had knives.",0.9798,0.816,0.119,0.065,0.5417310167310168

2009-09-23,5.0,"My second time at Ethiopian Diamond was for Veggie Supper Club: IX. Although I am a devout meat eater, I appreciate vegetarian dishes and have a couple up my chef sleeve. There's plenty on the menu here for both meat-eaters and vegetarians to enjoy, and I decided to go veggie, as I always seem to do for Veggie Supper Club meetings! There was a bit of a wait for our server to acknowledge that our group was ready to order. This may have been due to our party still having their menus open (a sign you're not ready to order), but I think the server was told we were expecting more people, hence she was probably just being polite and waiting. That was the only negative all night! Our server helped with any questions on the menu, and helped us choose yummy African beers, based on preference (Lager, Stout, Pilsener).  Most of us chose the Vegetarian Sampler; an easy way to try three of the dishes for $12. I got #30, 31 and 37! Don't they sound great? They were Yemisir Wot, a spicy chick pea dish, Kik Alticha, a yellow chick pea dish, and a potato and carrot dish soaked in garlic and ginger that was excellent! Everything satisified, and we were given plenty of spongy injera bread to dig in. The meal was excellent. The one other time I was here was on a Friday night, it was crowded, so it's best to make a reservation through the website. They also had a gentleman from Sun Ra's band playing music, and it was quite obvious he was a skilled musician and not just background music.

I'd really like to thank E.D. for putting numbers on the menu, it saves diners the embarrassment of trying to pronounce the dish names; although it would be funny to listen to people try.  Food comes out family style on a giant round tray. If you have issues sharing your food or having items touch one another you may have some problems. The dishes are eaten using Injera, a thin, crepe-like bread; in other words you are eating with your hands. I have a feeling that was the reason my friend hated Ethiopian, it's hard to be dainty on a first date eating this food, but in my opinion it's worth potentially offending your dinner date.  My food was amazing, my favorite dish being the Yatkilt Watt, string beans, carrots and potatoes in sauce. All three of the dishes I got were billed as mild, but this was definitely the spiciest of the three. It wasn't uncomfortably spicy, it just had a nice kick to it.  Service was friendly and attentive. The menu is expansive, with something for almost every type of diet including vegans. The place is really big, which makes it ideal for group dining excursions.

The cabbage thing was to die for. The injera is a bit weird. Looks and feels like fake spongy skin, but if fun to grab the food with. Stick with the Ethiopian beers and take a pass on the honey wine.

Ethiopian food is very close to Indian food except they use a distinct red chilli pepper in their seasoning unique to Ethiopia. This place had a vegetarian appetizer - the ""Sambusa"", very similar to the Indian ""Samosa"". We ordered them filled with Lentils and Spinach, served with Tamarind & slices of lemon. Overall, the appetizers fell short - greasy and not very flavorful. We rarely order them but we were with another couple. Skip the appetizers. What we ordered was the vegetarian ""sampler"", an assortment of flavored, simmering waats (stews) made from lentils, cabbage & carrots, greens, fresh salad, and a chick pea ""fish"" stew called Shimbra Assa (entirely vegetarian). The bread is a spongy, slightly sour, and made with Teff flour, which the diner uses to actually scoop up the waat. Funny thing is that there are several Ethiopian restaurants in the area, this seems to be the best. Always great, consistent vegetarian food. For those who like it spicy, order the ""awaze"" or hot sauce. This place also serves great African (and other) beers as well as traditional Tej (honey wine) - a warning - its VERY sweet.

2009-08-18,3.0,"I always thought I was cool and exotic because I love sushi.  I might not be a world traveller but I'll try just about anything.  It never occured to me to try Ethiopian food.  I had NO idea what to expect or what they would even serve.   This past weekend a world traveller offered to take me on my first Ethiopian food adventure.  I was nervous. I won't lie.  But I agreed to go. (Mostly because the guy who invited me is cute).  The place is HUGE.  And it was also packed.  A really good sign for a newcomer.  We sat by the window at an odd table.  It was a cool table- wicker and charming.  Unfortunately the base was so thick that we literally had to either straddle it or sit sideways.  Kind of uncomfortable.  But part of my exotic world travels.  I thought it was kinda cute that you get a mini chair to place your beverage on (because the table just isn't big enough for the platter of food they bring).  At first I thought the mini chair was a foot rest.  Maybe some sexy Ethiopian man would come by and rub my tootsies?  Maybe it was a chair for a kid?  Nope- it was a chair for my diet Coke.  Anyway, the menu was intimidating because I had no idea what anything was.  They do define things for you (much the way a sushi menu does) but I let my more knowledgable ""world traveller"" companion do the ordering.  The food came quickly.  I like that- I was hungry! The presentation.  It was both pretty and gross all at once.   Pretty because it comes on a platter.  And on that platter are piles of different foods.  Lamb, Chicken, Beef, lentils, spinach.  It was colorful and a really unique cool presentation.  Then of course the unleven bread. Gross because the meat looked kinda like diarrhea to me.  I did not mention this to my world traveller companion because I didn't want to ruin his meal.  But I was sort of torn between grossed out and intrigued.  My tour guide lead me through the experience.  He showed me how to break off a chunk of the unleaven bread and use it to pinch the food with and chow down.  I prefer to eat with a knife and fork.  It took me 7 years to accept chop sticks as ""utencils"" and to actually use them for sushi.  For 7 years I ate sushi with a knife and fork.  So to be told I'm to use this bread as my ""utencil"" was sort of a kick in the pants.  I did it though. The meat was good.  All the meat was really really good.  The sauce was really tasty and not too spicy.  It was just yummy.  I was pleasantly surprised. The downside was that they serve you meat and bones.  And until you bite into it, you dont know which you are getting.  But the bone thing only happened like twice.  The spinach was AMAZING!  I think I liked that the most actually.  I was not a lentil fan.   But the unleaven bread- EW.  I did not like it.  It had ZERO taste. And the texture was like... rubber.  I couldn't get past the texture of the bread.  If I could have had a fork and just eaten without that dang bread getting in the way, I'd have been much happier.   The service was terrible.  I think our waiter must have had too many tables so it might not have really been his fault.  But there was a point where I was literally waving my arms over my head to try to get ANYONES attention (we needed the check because we had a movie to get to) but no one paid any attention.  My Ethiopian tour guide had to get up and go to the hostess stand and ask someone if they could by chance find our waiter.  All in all I'd return IF they would allow me to use a fork and just eat the meat and spinach.  If I have to deal with the unleaven bread it's a no go.  I am really proud of myself for giving it a try.  I feel more worldy already.  In fact, I think I'll stamp my own damn passport.  I'm a world traveller, baby!",0.9951,0.781,0.141,0.078,0.6200102880658436

The vinegar sponge bread is similar yet so vastly different from Indian nan. The accompanies the kefta (steak tartar) so well. The spices have very fragrant aroma with a blistering heat on the tongue. The dark beers really taste great and counter balance the spices and other exotic flavors very well.

I met a friend on a Wednesday night, and we were seated right away. The space itself is huge and open, so even though there were about 25 other people there our conversations weren't drowned out by our neighbors. The decor is big yet unimposing and definitely adds to the ambience.  I wanted to try some of everything, so we got the vegetarian taste platter. Everything was delicious! I loved the lentils and chick pea ""fish"" and collard greans, and the sourdough bread was excellent as well. The watt has a lovely spicy kick. I even enjoyed the cabbage, and I usually dislike cabbage. And I am a huge fan of cuisine that does not require utensils; it adds to the fun of the dining experience!

About ten years ago, my cousin mentioned she had met some friends for Ethiopian food and the first very childish thing that came through my mind was, ""Ethiopians actually have food?"". Yes, I am very embarrassed for that ugly moment in my life. Well I have matured and my taste is refined ... less burgers/fries and more meals.  Wanting to help the local economy and get some good food and drinks , I decided to check out what was going on around my area. After a brief scan of some Edgewater , Rogers Park,  yelp.com  reviews, I found Ethiopian Diamond.  We walked in around 8:00 pm on a Thur. night and the place was half full or empty , whichever way you want to look at it. We were seated immediately and the waitress arrived pretty quick (asking us what did we want to drink). We looked over the menu and although it is pretty overwhelming, with it's combination/mix and match type orders we quickly chose the chicken,lamb,beef platter ($15) with a okra spinach side ($3), and some beef and spinach Kamusa (4 for $6). The food looked well prepared and served nice a neat, just like the pics on their website. We began to dig in and quickly looked up at each other with that yummmm look, in our eyes. The food had a great texture but it is true about the little bit of blandness. The sauce that accompanies the platter is what makes the food go from good to great.  The waiters are a little bit cold but nothing to whine about. The only thing that was kinda bothering, is how they brought the check as soon as we were done (like if they were watching you from some hidden camera) and kept coming back to see if we had the money ready.

I must admit, even after reading all the rave reviews on Yelp I was more than a bit skeptical whether I would enjoy the food. I am happy to report that E.D. exceeded my expectations greatly! Myself, DH and 2 daughters went last Saturday eve. fairly early (5:30 p.m.). As we sat there, the place filled up pretty quickly.  The menu was quite daunting, not being familiar with any of the dishes whatsoever and unfortunately the waitress, while very pleasant, was not too helpful. She did not walk us through the menu or recommend any dishes, in spite of several questions I asked. That minor quibble aside, we really found the experience unique, very tasty and fun to eat with your hands! We started with some spinach and some potato sambusas - the spinach were def. the better of the 2 - the potato ones were a bit bland. DH and I ordered a sampler with 1 beef and 1 lamb dish (can't remember which now); and daughters had chicken dish that included a hard-boiled egg and a vegetarian assortment.  When the waitress first brought the huge platter with what appeared to be small dollops of meat/veg/lentils I thought that it looked rather mingy - but after 20 mouthfuls of these offerings accompanied by the injera bread, I was totally stuffed. We all agreed that it was very tasty and different from anything else we'd had (including Indian food).  I would also recommend the honey wine. I did not find it too sweet; it was a nice counterpoint to some of the spicy dishes. Service was pretty good, even though the place was quite busy, we just wished we had a little more guidance as we were obviously neophytes. We would definitely return here.

Lucky for me, Colleen introduced me to E-Diamond during my last visit.  We had a very romantic meal there starting with our wine (I had the honey while she went with a more traditional glass of Cab Sauv), shared salad, and a main course that we enjoyed sans silverware. Abeba, our waitress, was sweet - she helped us through the menu and once we decided on the Tour of Ethiopia, she helped us with our 'picks.'  We chose (as Colleen also stated) the following: spinach and lentil sambusas, diamond salad (fresh with a tasty light dressing), lamb and okra entrees, split pea and collard green sides, and extra injera...  OMG - everything was delicious - there was a ton of food... it was fun to eat, and the combination of flavors wrapped into the injera (spongey Ethiopian bread) was orgasmic...

My wife has enjoyed Ethiopian food when in Europe, so she's been wanting to get to an Ethiopian restaurant in Chicago.  A Yelp Friend recommended we go here, so we did.  The décor is minimal but clean, much better looking on their website than in person.  Service is very attentive.  For my first Ethiopian meal, we ordered a combo for two, the ""E-1"" meat sampler, with kay watt (beef), doro watt (chicken), yebeg alicha (lamb) and other tasty dishes.   I adapted fairly easily to using the Ethiopian injera bread to scoop food and had a great meal, with plenty left over to take home too.  I enjoyed the spices in the watt dishes, but was underwhelmed by the quosta spinach and the chicken.  I loved the yebeg alicha.   Maybe when I've tried the other Ethiopian restaurants in Chicago I'll be ready to give Ethiopian Diamond more stars.  But not based on this visit - I liked it, I'll go back, but it's in the OK category, not great.",0.9954,0.695,0.272,0.033,0.6053030303030303

When I first started eating here I was a vegan and it has outstanding vegan/vegetarian options. The vegetarian platter is a winner. I've rejoined the carnivores and I love the lamb and other meats just as much! My only issue with ED is the same as almost everyone else -- it's so blasted far. But I've been known to make special trips up there by myself. In the middle of the week. Because I just HAD to have some ED. It really is among the best you'll find in the city.

See, Mimi and me share an office and we use to see each other all the time but lately it's not the case anymore. Different schedules, different work priorities therefore a lot of catching up to do especially in the gossip department (much more fun than the 'I feel like a loser' one). So I decided to take matters in hand and 'reunite' in front of a good meal. After much investigation we settled up on ED and we didn't regret it. Honey wine....I loved it. It's of course sweet but not like the way a white wine can be sweet...no...it's subtle, velvety, rich and unctuous. A delight. We shared the Dibs Sampler (three kinds of meat - chicken, beef and lamb and three vegetable sides) and it was delicious. Use the spicy sauce they give you - it really makes the flavors come through. We sat at a traditional table - lower to the ground, round-shaped and slightly larger than the big plate they bring the food on. It was nice, intimate if not the most comfortable.

I typically order the vegetarian sampler for two, which really is more than enough for three people, if you add an appetizer of sambosas or something like that. I'm not a vegetarian, but I've flirted with the concept enough that I'm fully satisfied by the vegetarian options here, especially the spicy lentils and the chickpea fish, both of which are really yummy.  The key to liking this joint is the bread. If injera doesn't suit you, then you probably won't enjoy the food. My half-assed yet standard description of the flavor is like sourdough bread that someone smushed and sat on for weeks and then popped little bubbles in and made it stretchy. An ineloquent description, but a description nonetheless. Personally I love the stuff, and have to remember to balance the amount of injera with the amount of tasty fillings, because, yes Virginia, there is a Santa Claus-sized gut waiting to show itself over the top of your belt when you keep chowing down on the bread.  The Ethiopian beers are great - I can't remember specifically which ones I've had and not had, but they are quite crisp and go well with the meal. I personally don't care for the honey wine - way too sweet for my tastes, but I know some people swear by it.  As others have mentioned, go on a Friday night for the music, but be prepared for it to be loud. If you can dig having your eardrums rattled a bit, it's worth it.

I have only had ethiopian one other time in my life, but for some reason, the sponge bread sounded like the only thing that could possibly cure the nauseousness I was to experience for the next 7 waking hours of my day.  Of course, it wasn't until 7 pm that I actually mustered up the strength to get dressed and venture out of the house, but when I did, my friends and i were very pleased with the outcome. If you have read any of my other reviews, my best friend and hetero life partner recently turned vegan, which puts a real damper on my social life as we used to do quite a bit of eating together.  Turns out, ethiopian is like a vegan dream!  There were 6 of us and I sure am glad I called for a reservation beforehand because the place was nearly full-maybe there are more injera-craving drunks than I thought.  the very friendly and accommodating host sat us at a great table in the middle of the restaurant and gave 3 of us who had never eaten Ethiopian the protocol.  We ordered 2 veggie dishes (cabage something and lentils), Chicken Watt, yebeb (lamb) tibbs, and whatever their beef equivalent of tartare was.  It was all very good, the chicken was my favorite, and I agree with an earlier review that said spicy might speak more to flavor and degree of spice rather than if a food is hot and makes you want to drink a pitcher of water.  I intentionally wore jeans instead of elastic waistbanded pants bc I was worried about overeating-it did nothing.  That effing injera must expand in your stomach bc I was fullll afterwards, as was everyone else.  All in all, I liked this place because it had a good selection of food, nice seating and overall space, but I think I like the injera at Ras Dashen down the street more.  I also have a cold and ate some garlicky things that I never would have otherwise, but my sense of taste is kind of off today. oops.

Partly because I love the look on people's faces when I tell them I'm going out to eat Ethiopian, but mostly because I LOVE the spices, the injera bread, the friendly service, and the coffee.  Ethiopian Diamond is my go-to choice for Ethiopian. The menu is large, and the prices fair. The portions are larger than other places I've been (Demera, I'm looking in your direction). I reccomend getting a sampler of some kind. Don't just order one entree. Part of the fun of Ethiopian is having a large tray of different dishes that you can dig into with the addictingly sour Injera bread. Recently, my eating partner and I order then Veggie sampler, and added two Chicken entrees. I also had a beer brewed in Namibia. We had enough leftovers for us BOTH to take home another meal's worth....all for only $45.  I only eat Chicken and veggies so I can't comment on the lamb and beef dishes. The Doro Tibs Watt (spicy chicken cubes in a spicy sauce) are my favorite. The lentil dishes are all great.  Treat yourself to some Ethiopian coffee as well. Ethiopia is the birthplace of the coffee bean. More tips for first time Ethiopian diners: 1. Don't use TOO much injera bread, try using smallish pieces and grab smaller bites. The bread will fill you up like rice, and leave you unsatisfied because you didn't eat enough of the ""real"" food.  2. Don't be bashful about getting your hands dirty. If you have reservations about sharing a big tray of food with someone, make sure you dine with someone you are close with.

First, lets get to the real most important part of eating here: it is ALL FINGER FOOD. This is like reliving your inner child desires of eating with your hands, for a very respectable dinner.  So first, we ordered the Ethiopian equivalent to Samosas...we got the spinach kind. It was extremely good! Meanwhile, the date elected on ethiopian tea, and I got a mango drink. Ethiopian tea is....I don't know, very fresh and nice. I'd compare it to the handmade teas I've had in Israel, but then again that isn't really ""unique"" of a tea flavor. It was good though. Meanwhile, the meal itself comes with no silverware.Now, lets get to how that works. We ordered the veggie platter thing for 2 people, and it was awesome. Spicy red lentils, this amazing spinach combo, the potatoes were good (I hate potatoes, it takes a lot for me to say that), but okay. So you've got all of this food there, but what do you eat it on? This dough that is all spongy and absorbent, seasoned with lime, and you just pick it up and eat it with that. This is not like a taco, remember, you have no silverware.   On top of that, this bread (which looks like a sponge on one side)....is actually what all the food is served on top of! So if you don't finish it all and take it home, you'll see that the bread absorbs all the oils and flavor within the first couple minutes of when they wrap up the food. It was like 30$ for the veggie platter for two, and it was a lot of very good food. Also, the waitstaff was polite and very quick to refill water when it got low. Also, table space is kinda tight, so if you aren't going in as just 2 people, you will definitely want to reserve seating. This place is pretty packed!

2008-08-31,3.0,"Two things that I learned at Ethiopian Diamond last night: 1.  Ethiopian food is great! 2.  The dining experience is annoying. I was ready to deal with eating with my hands.  It wasn't my first choice, but I'm capable of trying new things.  (FYI--I hate getting food on my hands.  My mother will tell you stories about how, as a very young boy, I would come inside filthy from playing in the dirt but would insist on having all foods, even such as bananas, cut up and eaten with a fork.  I've loosened up a bit, but I'm still quite fastidious.  So this was a tough one for me to begin with.) So--it wasn't eating with my hands.  There were three main points of annoyance.  First, when we came in, we were seated at some sort of elevated basket instead of a regular table, even though there were several open.  Good luck leaning on this thing, or trying to get closer than two feet away.  It is basically a tall wicker hassock with a shallow basket atop it.   Second, when the waitress brought our beer bottles, she apologized for having ""no cold glasses.""  Well, how about a room-temperature glass then?  By the time I overcame my puzzlement, she was gone. And thirdly, they play live American jazz music, apparently.  They kicked it off with some Henry Mancini (not the Pink Panther one, but the one that sounds similar) and went on to play a bunch of other traditional Ethiopian jazz music.   On the upside, the food was really good.  We started with carrot and potato sambusas, which were kind of small and a bit bland.  Our main meal was the chicken tibs and the yellow lentils, but they gave us a couple of extra items on the house (?) or perhaps they were sides--a slightly spicy vegetable stew and a chopped spinach dish.  Nothing was phenomenal but it was all above-average, and I would be happy to return if they could guarantee me a real table and a fork. The biggest head-shaker of the night was just before we left when a girl at a nearby table gave me a Lewis Black moment when I overheard her say, ""Ukranians make the best chocolate.""  Seriously, I don't know what the fuck she was talking about, but I had to restrain myself from punching her in the face.  If she'd said ""I was in a chocolate shop in Kiev last fall, and it was soooo good"" I would have bought it.  But ""Ukranians make the best chocolate"" is too dumb to be allowed to live.",0.9832,0.806,0.127,0.068,0.45542095159742235

The best time to go is mid-week.  It's rumored that food shipments arrive to the restaurant on Monday, so the ""freshest"" food would be on the days immediately after (Tuesday, Wednesday).  I only know this through heresay. Granted, the food is good to great every day, but I admit that the food generally tastes better on Tuesdays than on Sundays. And, if you want to avoid loud, blaring, in-your-face, I-can't-hear-what-you are-saying music, then don't go to the restaurant on Friday nights.  It's been about 6 months since I've been to the Diamond (I've moved out of Chicago), but I'm guessing the restaurant still has Phil Cohran playing his music every Friday night.  Don't get me wrong, his music is nice, but it is WAY too loud.

One of those nasty places (in the same neighborhood) made me feel like there was a Gremlin in my belly trying to shred its way out with claws and a Dwarf axe. Never again-and it will be a while before I get wild and venture to another Ethiopian spot before I exhaust all of the resources that the Ethiopian Diamond has to offer (they have a masssiiiive menu). As soon as we walked in we noticed a live Jazz band playing in the back. We were seated right away even though everyone was extremely busy. Our waitress was very genuine in making sure that everything was satisfactory and she was quick to show a warm smile as did every person that we interacted with-even the busser).

You'll be eating without flatware, from a shared tray full of crepe like, spongy bread, which is delicious.  Be prepared for bright colors and strong flavors. Two minor critiques: 1) The lentil sambusas, a fried pastry similar to a samosa you would get at an Indian restaurant, were marvelously prepared and presented, but the lentil filling was short on salt -- something I generally hardly use any of to begin with. If they had not been served with a vibrant, sweet, fruit sauce, they would have been quite bland.  2) The spicy shrimp I ordered still had the tail shells in place -- making eating them out of pieces of bread with my hands very, very tricky if I didn't want to actually eat the shells as tiny, sharp shards.

2008-07-22,5.0,"I'm throwing caution to the wind, absolutes out the window + being completely bias when reviewing Diamond's.  I lived on Granville for 5 yrs. + Diamond's was my weekly spot, be it dine-in or take-out.  A friend put it best when commenting on Ethiopian Diamond's: ""I never have to eat at another resturant. Ever."" Perhaps ""never"" + ""ever"" are stretching it, just a smidge but if you've ever had the pleasure of dining here, then it's a tough dispute.  I spent many holidays here, have taken almost anyone/everyone who has visited from out of town + even had the honor of a mini-cooking lesson within the kitchen. The staff are pure sunshine (Yes, I just typed that) + by far some of the friendliest I've been waited on.  Ok, so the food: I know there have been a handful of Ethiopian resturants opening almost on top of eachother but you'll be pressed to find shimbra assa (chickpea mock ""fish"" w/ spicies) anywhere else ...In fact, Diamond's prides itself on being the only resturant with such a dish (from a family recipe).  My dining companions + I alway order an appetizer of spinach sambusa (use the lemon!) and the vegetarian combo for one: shimbra assa, yesmir watt (spicy red lentils), kik alicha (yellow lentils + my personal favorite), gomen (collards), tikel gomen (cabbage w/ carrot) and dinch alicha (potato w/ carrot) ...And yes, I just did that from memory.  Tip: The combo for ONE could easily feed 2-3 people. The portions are large and trust me when I say, Ethiopian food is best ate fresh opposed to leftovers.  Tip: Always ask  for extra injera! (Just in case) Tip: Ask for ""hot pepper sauce"" or the ""berbere sauce,"" that's usually used for meats, on the side ...Very tasty w/ even the vegetarian dishes. Dab a little on your injera + scoop accordingly. It'll definitely clear up any sinus issues.  Their Tej or honey wine is worth ordering the karafe opposed to by the glass. They make it themselves w/ their own hops + it's dessert in a glass.  Given the fact that Ethiopian food is rather filling, Ethiopian Diamond's has the best space amongst it's competition ...Large + airy w/ lime green walls ...A perfect spot to enjoy a pot of buna (Ethiopian coffee, very dark + tasty).

Though she seemed to be standing around, doing nothing?)  The host could tell something wasn't right and came to check on us. Maybe the waitress' brain had been devoured by parasites, maybe that was the problem? Or maybe I was just demanding because I wanted a combo of food my child would actually eat.

Kik Alicha are split peas cooked in a mild sauce of onion, garlic & ginger. -- Gomen, Yebeg Alicha (mild), Quosta: Gomen are chopped collard greens simmered in a mild garlic & onion sauce. Yebeg Alicha is lamb meat booked in a mild onion, garlic, ginger & basil sauce. Quosta are chopped spinach simmered in a mild garlic & onion sauce. -- Dinich Alicha & Kay Watt: Dinich Alicha are potato cubes & carrots cooked in a ginger, garlic, & onion sauce with Ethiopian spices. Kay Watt are lean beef meat cubes cooked in a spice homemade ""Diamond Sauce"". -- Tikel Gomen & Dinich Alicha: Tikel Gomen is sliced cabbage & carrots cooked in a mild sauce. Dinich Alicha are string beans, carrots and potatoes cooked in a mild onion, garlic & ginger sauce with Ethiopian spices. Injera: Injera is the traditional Ethiopian bread that is part of every entree. It's a pancake like bread on which the various stew dishes are served. The traditional way of eating it is with your fingers. A bit sized piece of injera is broken off to pick up a mouth full of the chosen dish.

2008-02-08,5.0,"I ate here last spring, so it's impossible for me to give a detailed review of the food, but I remember being absolutely floored, and I have thought often of this meal and discussed it with others.  First of all, the method of eating Ethiopian fare lends itself to good feelings:  Entrees are served family style (for lack of a better description) and eaten with one's hands using a spongy, sourish, flat bread called Injera.  Injera is made with teff flour, which is ancient and remarkably nutritious.  It also makes for some strong and flexible bread, perfect for scooping up these incredible wat stews, as they are called.  This method is not unlike Pakistani dining, and the flavors are somewhat similar.  Because the food is stewed, expect tender succulent meat and vegetables that have absorbed all of the complex and exciting (but not unfamiliar) spices used in Ethiopian cooking.   To give an idea of the flavors, expect saffron, ginger, coriander, basil, cumin, and thyme, as well as a chili pepper.  There is nothing subtle here, everything is loaded with flavor.   The atmosphere is warm and relaxed even while the restaurant is small and busy.  Don't feel like you've been ignored if you have to ask your server for the bill, apparently that's just the way things work.  You're expected to take your time and enjoy.  And you will, yes you will.",0.9877,0.809,0.158,0.033,0.5742753623188407
2008-02-02,5.0,"one of my favorites in Chicago.  Veggie options excellent, meated options are likely excellent, but I've never been there with a meat eater (but I have been probably 30 times).  Everything is spiced to some degree, but it is quite well balanced, and not as intensely hot as some of the other Ethiopian restaurants-- I'm not a fan of the tendency to just keep pushing the ""hot"" button.  Still, if you like it hot, ask for a side of berbere sauce.    A few of my faves are the shimbra assa (chick pea fish-- it's not fish at all), yemisir wat (spiced lentils), Shiro (spiced chick pea flour dip), gomen (collards) and tikel gomen (cabbage and carrots) I recommend bringing some tupperware and ordering everything on the menu that you want.  Leftovers get better over a couple days, as the spices meld. Have a glass of the tej, a cousin of mead, or get a beer.   The beer selection is a little limited, but they now have victory Prima Pils--  ask for it even if it's not on the menu.  They might have other good beers too.  Wine and spicy food doesnt make sense to me.. the coffee service is pleasing, and they often burn a little frankenscence.   The place is pleasing, the staff very friendly.   Highly recommended for casual, enjoyable social outing.",0.9925,0.784,0.198,0.018,0.5982205513784461

2007-09-04,4.0,"Ethiopian Diamond is at the end of my street, but I've been going here for eight years or so.  In fact, I can't compare it to other Ethiopian restaurants in Chicago except maybe Mama Desta's about seven years ago...  I can compare it to Ethiopian restaurants in DC, and African restaurants in Chicago, though.  All in all, Ethiopian Diamond is one of the best: cheap, fresh, flavorful, and with prompt and decent service. One thing that ED has going for it is that it is always busy - every day of the week, lunch and dinner, there are diners in there. That means that your food is always fresh, and that it usually comes in a timely fashion.  One of the big problems with many African restaurants - in Chicago at least - is that they tend to cater to the take-out trade.  A related problem is that the menu is something like a wish list instead of a practical guide to the food you can actually get on any single day.  That's the way it is in many African restaurants in Africa - it's better to ask what food is available before you even look at a menu.  The result is that you end up waiting - sometimes hours - for your food.  So in that sense, Ethiopian Diamond is not particularly authentic - you can realistically expect to order most any item off the menu and get it in a reasonable amount of time. Still, I usually order the old standby - the vegetarian platter for two.  This has its drawbacks - I don't know the names of the dishes at all! - but it's a good deal for a healthy, filling meal.  Usually you'll get red lentils, split peas, a potato - carrot dish, braised collards, and a small salad in the middle of your injera (the spongy flat bread made with tef flour that's used for scooping up food).  There may be another dish there, too, but I forget.  I've had other dishes here, too, but because I'm normally here with kids we don't have time to be too choosy.   My beer recommendation is Kebele, an Ethiopian beer that comes in a generous half-liter bottle.  It's a typical African lager, maybe a bit on the malty side, but without any obvious distracting corn or rice flavors.  And because it's in a half-liter bottle, you can split it.  There are usually other African beers on offer, but they tend to rotate in and out.  They're all more or less the same unless you can get a Nigerian beer (eg Star, Gulder) - these are usually made with a high proportion of sorghum instead of barley due to protectionist government policies in that country.  Order your drinks, though, the first time you see a waiter or waitress - the staff here is generally attentive, but they don't flutter by often to take drink orders so get your order in when you have a chance. The other thing to pay attention to is the dcor.  What I like in particular is a large painting between the front door and the bar depicting modern Addis Abeba - complete with buses, cars, and airplanes.  Usually African restaurants try to play up the rustic and exotic aspects of their cultures, so Ethiopian Diamond's dcor is refreshing. Two cautions to the picky diner.  First, I would think twice about coming here with a large group.  I have done so in the past, and it's the only time when the food has taken an unacceptable time to reach the table.    Second, because the restaurant is spacious, cheap, and you eat with your hands, it is popular for people such as myself who come with small children.  If you come before 8 or 9 pm, you will probably hear and see kids in the restaurant.  Please don't give them and their parents dirty looks for enjoying the diverse cuisine that Chicago has to offer.",0.9932,0.874,0.098,0.028,0.39575396825396814

The good news was we had a prix-fixe dinner for $16.00 per person which was delicious and filling. The bad news was we waited for one hour for our food, after waiting approximately  45 minutes for the entire group to be complete and seated. The explanation for the delay was that it ""takes a long time to make this good food."" Now we had four or five identical platters with the identical assortment of the same absolutely flavorful but stew-like food (which presumably could have been simmering in a pot for hours.) So there were no individual, made-to-order dishes, and I don't see what could possibly have taken so long. I would not have called the service here generally attentive or gracious. It seemed as if they just wanted to get rid of this frugal bunch of French-speaking, non-drinking patrons. Of course, were that the case, we would have had our food earlier!  Oh, well, I just thought I would raise that issue in case you are bringing a group. That way you can manage your expectations about service, and perhaps bring a scrabble game.  I would recommend it highly for groups, however, because it is a good value. And eating without utensils is great fun.

I had wanted to try an Ethiopian Restaurant in Chicago for a while and the Yelp recommendations were pushed over the edge when an Ethiopian cab driver told me the injera (sour bread that is seemingly ubiquitous in Ethiopian restaurants) was authentic and tasty. I headed over to Ethiopian Diamond a while back and found it fun and worth a look, but not worth returning for. SETTING - The front looks just the same as any cheap ethnic restaurant, flat square tables, those uncomfortable chairs you spent hours in awaiting your visa at some random consulate on Michigan Avenue, and fluorescent lighting.  Head to the back corner and you'll find cool looking chairs and round tables that are even more uncomfortable.  Want to stretch your legs out?  You better part them very wide to make it around the base of those tables.  Ladies - careful now! FOOD I tried a variety of different things and have to say, as an Indian, I'm pretty disappointed.  It all tasted Indian/South East Asian but just wasn't as good.  Call me evil.  Call me an anti-cultural-relativist.  It was okay.  It was even good.  It just wasn't that great.  You can get almost all of the same stuff at an Indian restaurant for the same price (albeit a bit unhealthier).   Sambusas?  Get real samosas. Chicken?  It had spring onions in it which was a nice touch, but none of the tanginess you could get at a Thai or Vietnamese restaurant.
