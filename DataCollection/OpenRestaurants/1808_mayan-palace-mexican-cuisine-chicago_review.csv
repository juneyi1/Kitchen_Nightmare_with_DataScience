2017-08-29,4.0,Came here because of the positive Yelp reviews and was not disappointed! The restaurant looks tiny from the outside and I was afraid we would have to wait to be seated but they have an entire back room as well as a little mini patio in the back. The food was okay and definitely fill and satisfied my Mexican food cravings but the real star of the night was the margs. They have half off margs Tues and Thursday so take advantage of that! You can get them iced or frozen (like a slushie) and with or without salt on the rim. They're also HUGE which is great for sharing or even for yourself.  I would come back for a good time with those margs.,0.9892,0.746,0.254,0.0,0.4519537480063796

2017-06-06,2.0,"I live close by and walked right in one night. The dining room was small with only around 10 table, so it wasn't busy, but I found the food very underwhelming.  The chips were very salty and the salsa was runny, so I didn't eat much of it. I'm usually the one to jump on free chips... The Queso Fundido was the MOST disappointing dish of the meal. The cheese has the taste, texture, and color of canned generic nacho cheeze sauce and didn't seem fresh at all. We couldn't even finish it.  I enjoyed the chorizo in the Chorizo Taco, but felt the corn tortilla was too soft, undercooked, and the shell broke in half. I did enjoy the tang of the Ceviche, the seafood was freshly chopped and covered in avocado (which is always good to see). The enchiladas were small, room temperature, and wrapped in the same corn tortillas as the taco, so they were flimsy and seemed undercooked. The flavors in the sauce were balanced, but overall, the dish wasn't that great. For the last dish, I had shrimp in a spicy sauce and it was too spicy to eat, so I took it home to try later, and found I could only eat a few pieces at a time.  Overall, I didn't enjoy much of my meal, so I won't be back.",0.712,0.844,0.088,0.068,0.3885176651305683
2017-06-03,2.0,"They can keep two stars for their margarita deal but otherwise there is no reason to go there. We had their queso dip and it was the worst I have ever had at a ""real"" Mexican restaurant-they basically took a jar of Tostitos queso and put it in a bowl and microwaved it and served it up. It was really gross and fake tasting. Also didn't like their chips - really thick and too hard to bite into. Also tasted like grocery store tortilla chips. Also want to comment about the service. As I said my friend and I shared margs and queso and salsa. Well at one point in the evening (when we were on our second PITCHER of margs), I politely asked for more chips for the remaining salsa we had. The waiter rudely said ""ok are you gonna order soon because I'm not just going to keep giving you chips."" I totally was not trying to freeload-our bill was already $40 at that point!

We were told unequivocally 'yes, all margaritas are 1/2 price.' The bill came and it was $33 for 3 skinny margaritas. Our waiter (a different waiter - they seem to rotate them around) said they were not 1/2 price. I told him we were told by the other waiter (now nowhere around, conveniently) they were. He said to me ""You come here often, right?"" I thought he was going to say he'd take off one of the three margaritas, which I think would have been a fair make good for the misunderstanding especially for a lung time patron which they knew I was.  Instead, he said ""you should know which margaritas are 1/2 price."" Seriously? For saying that, let's just say he chipped in on the difference with his tip.

To start with they have the standard selection of imported Mexican beers along with giant margaritas (and I mean giant). Complementary chips and salsa were on the better end, fresh and plentiful.  Also tried the guacamole, which didn't blow me away but was much better than average. Main dishes were large and well cooked, no absence of flavor, though the sides (rice, beans) could have used a bit of work.   All in all exactly what I expected based on what I paid for, without any of the often apparent corny pseudo-traditional atmosphere.  Staff was attentive and helpful, food was good, prices were reasonable.  I will definitely be back.",0.9811,0.793,0.19,0.017,0.44484890109890113

The gf then got a red sangria, which was okay, but very strong.  For entrées, we got the Mayan enchiladas and the Diablo steak. Gf absolutely loved the enchiladas, which had potatoes and chorizo. Tasted too much like breakfast food to me. The Diablo steak was good, but not what I was expecting.  Overall, as our second foray into Chicago Mexican food it was a mild success.

The interior leaves something to be desired since it was nothing fancy except for a bunch of tables lined up along both sides of the restaurant with the kitchen near the bar. For food, chips were instantly served up to the table alongside salsa. Great chips with plenty of jalapeno in the salsa.  Since none of the specials looked that appealing, I went with three a la carte tacos: steak, chicken, and shredded beef. Though nothing special, each one was enjoyable and quite large, being packed with meat, cheese, and sour cream. But damn you definitely don't come here for the food. The margaritas here are delicious and STRONG. Half way through the tasty passion fruit drink, I was feeling it. Good stuff!

The queso and margarita came promptly in spite of how busy the place was, and then everything went down hill from there.  The queso was topped with pico de gallo and when I attempted the first scoop I was met with a puddle of pico de gallo water right under the first layer. It was disgusting! I sent it back. The margarita was unbearably sweet! And I could not taste the tequila. It was worse than those margaritas in a bottle you get on a plane for five bucks.  For the entree we ordered the ceviche and the steak fajitas. The ceviche was clearly made with frozen seafood. I couldn't really tell what was shrimp and what was fish. It had this awful after taste that ice cubs get after being in the fridge for too long!  The fajitas were also a big let down. For $16 you get eight small pieces of chewy steak, 1/4 cup of canned refried beans, and 1/2 cup of bland rice.  Now, I wasn't expecting to be blown away. This was in fact a last minute choice.

He was never far from the table and consistently refilled our chips and our drinks. The guacamole was good and I really appreciated that their pitcher of margaritas did not have any ice in it - so many place fill those pitchers up with ice and give you nothing to drink!

Up came Mayan Palace- a ten minute drive from our condo.  Street parking was not turning over as quickly as we like, but we lucked out a few minutes later. We were welcomed by ""Augustine"" and shown to a table. He asked our names and introduced himself- not just to let us know who was serving us- but to let us know he cared about his customers. We did not want to be rude (that's my story and I sticking to it) so we ordered the house margaritas- lime standard w/salt for Hubby and pineapple for me. They were very good and reasonably priced for the area at $8.00 each. The guacamole was to die for but the chips could be either a bit fresher or made a bit lighter. Everything else was top notch.  Hubby had the chimichanga and he liked that it wasn't greasy. I had to steal a couple of the yummy potatoes from inside- I would like a side order of those alone! We both liked their refried beans- creamy, not pasty. I had the steak enchiladas suiza- delicious but the sauce was a bit ""hot spicy"" for me- next time I'll ask for a milder sauce.  The flan was very good and Hubby ate it in 4.5 seconds (ladies and gentleman, a new world's record) and my refried ice cream was very tasty. I like that they don't load it up with too much cinnamon and the coating wasn't greasy at all. Very nice with chocolate sauce and whipped cream.

Once I was certain I was going to live, I perused the menu and ordered margaritas for my companion (who was running late) and myself.  I am very partial to Cesar's margaritas, so I was prepared to be disappointed.  However, I was pleasantly surprised.  I ordered the Patron margarita, mango flavor.  It was very smooth and quite tasty, but for $12.50 I could have gotten twice the margarita at Cesar's. I ordered the chicken flautas, which were good but a touch overdone.  Not tooth-chipping hard, but a few seconds less in the deep fryer would have made them that much better.  The rice and beans had fantastic flavor!  My friend had a quesadilla that she seemed to enjoy.  We finished up by sharing the fried ice cream, which was pretty comparable to, say, Chi-Chi's (does that place still exist?).",0.9871,0.789,0.172,0.039,0.5561019536019536

My ""premium"" margarita at Mayan Palace was REALLY good.  I hate when margaritas taste like Cuervo mix...and Mayan Palace's couldn't be further from that.  Granted $12.00 is pretty expensive, but with the 1800 tequila, Mayan Palace hit it out of the park.  YUM! Now, let's get to the food.  Very good salsa but it comes in a small cup, so it's difficult to get your chip in there (that's what she said).  Other than that it was very tasty and they always refilled it when we ran low.  The guac was also very good.  Fresh tasting (it better be!).  Our server was very good.  He immediately asked us if he could make any recommendations and asked us what sorts of things we liked.  He then proceeded to walk us through 4 or 5 menu items each that we might like.  I thought that was great...and he really nailed it.  The food was really good.  It's ""normal Mexican"", so nothing unbelievably fancy.  Burritos, enchiladas, and all the normal things.....plus a few different items.  I had a steak that was called Diablo Carne Asada (I think).  It was very tasty.  Almost like short ribs in a very spicy mole-like sauce.   My only beef with the Mayan Palace is that it feels kind of cold in there.  Not the temperature, but the decor.  Even though the lights are dim and the walls are rustically painted, it still seems a bit cold.  That may keep me from going there in the winter time and also knocks off a star for me.  It just doesn't feel especially cozy.  Other than that....great.   Great service and tasty food!",0.9944,0.811,0.161,0.028,0.5813636363636364

However, just like the girl with orange complexion in the middle of a Chicago winter... something just ain't right about Mayan palace... All the chicken dishes I had tasted slightly fishy.  And when I say fishy, I don't mean questionable, but rather a raw fish aftertaste... I usually polish off everything on my plate, but I left some of the chicken enchiladas untouched.  The chicken flautas were better (because the fried shell helped hide the taste of the meat) but I could taste that something was wrong. The service took a while, but I was with a group and sometimes it's hard to service everyone.  None the less, I had come from the gym (as most of my reviews go) and I was absolutely starving.  Two full baskets of chips and salsa later, plus appetizers and I was already full when the entrees finally came. The chicken fajitas were just okay.  They seemed healthy, were fairly bland, but not memorable.  I sampled a bit of the Chile Verde, a green salsa pork dish that I believe put my stomach into an uneasy feeling.  Not a fan of that dish, but then again I don't like pork all that much. The only real memorable part of the dinner was getting desert which was fried ice cream.  Frying + any desert = Good and unhealthy.  This was my first experience eating fried ice cream, and I was pleasantly surprised.   All in all, my group and I had a great time hanging out with each other despite the poor food experience.  I most likely will not go back to Mayan Palace, unless I am in desperate need of a huge margarita on a random Thursday night.  I do appreciate that the staff was nice, and that there was a good atmosphere, but that was not quite enough to make up for their deficiencies",0.9856,0.779,0.157,0.064,0.5760346224288532

The chips and salsa are excellent. The salsa is just spicy enough that we always ask for more and put it on everything. I've had some other appetizers here - the queso fuendido is meh but also not something I enjoy many other places, the guacamole is excellent, but the free chips and salsa really can't be beat. Favorite entree: flautas. Fried deliciousness. Their rice and beans are so so excellent. One of my friends who is Cuban and loves Mexican food also raves about the chicken and mole. I've also had their chimichanga, tamales, and enchiladas, and all have been really tasty. Pitchers of margaritas are also a must. The peach is my favorite since it isn't overly sweet, the strawberry is misleadingly tasty (as in you can't tell at all how much tequila is in it), and our most recent favorite is the jamaica flower, which internet searching tells me is flavored from the hibiscus flower. It tastes citrus-y and is a beautiful pink color. The service here is always really great. They pour your margaritas for you even though the pitcher is sitting at your table and you could do it yourself. They're always so nice and accommodating.

It's got enough traditional flair to it that it's not americanized, but enough of a twist so its not following gradma's old cooking skills (which I equally love but its truly an art to balance contemporary styles with traditional ones successfully). Second...can you say best margaritas in the city..at 1/2 price 2 days of the week! Yes, its true, they have amazing margaritas, and that 1/2 price on Tues. and Thurs. also includes the pitchers! Just be careful..they don't *seem* strong and they can quickly sneak up on you. The atmosphere is cozy and very welcoming, and if there's anything I could rate the best out of my endless list, it's the service.  Absolutely impeccable. I've been a server for 5 years or so now and never in my life have I ever encountered the service they provide here. My boyfriend and I eat here enough to call this our second home, but it's not because of that that they know us by name. Our very first visit they took the time to get to know us, and the by the second visit they were welcoming us as if we were old friends. The owner, Rudy, is an awesome guy, say hello if you get a chance. You can see how much passion he has for the place when you talk to him! He's also the owner of Taco and Burrito Palaces found on Halsted, more of your traditional fast food mexican joints, fantastic as well though. I've had many of the dishes on their menu and there are a couple I love: *BEST TORTILLA SOUP EVER! So fresh and full of flavor, absolute must! *Any of the filete de Huachinango or Tilapia, these are filets but very meaty and suprisingly filling, I like it al ajo which is packed with garlic but that's how I like it, full of flavor! *Pork in salsa verde...sooooooooo tender, the meat literally falls apart in your mouth, and I'm typically not a huge fan of pork. So delicious though! *Mayan Enchiladas! Filled with chorizo and potatoes, topped with melted cheese. Enough said. Just as a side warning: If you decide to indulge yourself here, beware you will probably find me stuffing my face and it's not a pretty sight!",0.9982,0.76,0.208,0.032,0.5493197278911565

UNTIL NOW. Yep, the carne asada, ritas, black beans, and chips all had that authentic taste I'm used to.  Let me be clear, this is not Tex-mex.  I don't even like Tex-mex.  This is REAL Mexican food.  They have half price pitchers of ritas on Wed, nights which would make this place a really good bargain.  But even without that I felt it was reasonably priced and our waiter was excellent.  Very friendly.  And the decor was super cute.   This is officially my first favorite Mexican food place in Chicago.

The waiter misinformed us that all margaritas were half priced, so just as we were about to order the a pitcher of the most expensive kind, he says ""oh no, the special is just for the house margaritas"". Fine. I order a pineapple ON THE ROCKS and my husband ordered a banana frozen. Of course, both come frozen. I tried to drink it down, but just couldn't, and called the waiter over for a do-over. I literally watched the bartender pour my drink in the blender, add some more pre made pineapple crap on top and then crank up the blender...nothing worse than a foamy, weak margarita. The hubbie thought his was ""Meh"". The people next us had normal looking margaritas and seemed to enjoy them, so I asked them what kind and my husband talked me into trying one (Lime). That was much better, I have to say. So I had another. He tried a Lime one as well, but frozen and liked that one better. By the time we left, I could tell tequila was in them and had a nice buzz.

2010-06-06,5.0,"I may be about as picky of a person as they come in terms of food choices. Having said that, I find it only fitting that I give this authentic mexican establishment five stars. It has that 'something' quality that makes me wanting to go back. I'll start with the pros: 1. Out of this world Margaritas - hands down. Every time I come to this friendly  neighborhood eatery and order a Margarita, I end up leaving loaded (even on just one). Mayan's Margaritas make others seem synthetic. Try the Patron - the next day, you'll be glad you did. 2. Robust Salsa. Practically considering salsa a food staple, Mayan's salsa not only delivers on its freshly made taste - it definitely has some serious zing. Not to mention, the excellent servers refill your table's chips and salsa constantly.  3. Seating. As I have lived around the block from Mayan for the past two years, we're always greeted with friendly servers or the owner and seated shortly thereafter. I only have had to wait once in the small bar area for about 10-15 minutes and have rarely made a reservation. There have been numerous occasions we have not made reservations and called on a whim to see if they have seating and they always will tell us to ""come over"". I have never been disappointed whether I've arrived with one person or 5. 4.Service. As aforementioned, I am a picky one to please. Nothing will make me more aggravated or turned off from a restaurant than their service. I do not go to work every day and half a$$ my job, so I expect the same general standard when it comes to restaurant service. Mayan seems to be family operated and everyone pitches in to make their customers feel welcomed, re-filled, and pleased. In addition, I have never had a problem making a substitution on a dish (or omitting cheese). Did I mention reasonably quick service? 5. Fish/Shrimp Tacos. AMAZING. Corn tortilla, crunchy cabbage, mahi mahi or shrimp (have had both), pico de gallo, avocado. MMMM. They are that good. I always go in with the intent of trying something new on the menu, but more often than not, I choose the tacos. 6. Ceviche. Shrimp/scallop/pico de gallo, avocado, lime juice. Delicious. Served with saltines, but awesome with tortilla chips and great for sharing with friends. 7. Junior burrito, shrimp fajitas, tortilla soup, combination plates - all delicious - I don't have one bone to pick with the menu at Mayan. Also, the items are not laden with grease, covered in cheese so you can't see what you actually ordered, or dripping in oil as many mexican restaurants serve their food. I do not have any 'make it or break it' cons. The only thing was: the last time we were there, these obnoxious girls were practically yelling as they were talking to one another in the table directly next to us. We could hear more of their conversation than we needed to - luckily we were on our way out shortly thereafter. It seems to be much louder and compact in the front of the restaurant, but Mayan does offer a back room. Actually, the back room gets pretty rowdy, too. I think that's just an effect of the tequila.

The mango margarita on the rocks was wonderful.  It looked like they blended fresh mangos and added it to the mix.  Delicious!  I also tried the tamarind margarita, which was tasty but not as good.  It was a little too sweet for me.  The margaritas are very strong (watch out!), which I didn't realize until we got up to leave!  Whoops...

All right, so I haven't tried THAT many Mexican restaurants, but it's because I went here for the first time last winter, fell in love & never looked back. Why risk eating at a shitty place when I know I'll be satisfied every time I eat at Mayan Palace? There isn't anything on this menu that I don't like. I have been going here at least twice per month (typically three) since May and have tried a bunch of stuff on the menu. I highly recommend the queso fundido appetizer, Mayan enchiladas entree or Quesadilla Supreme entree with chorizo. My boyfriend loves the Burrito Suizo and our friends enjoy the chicken fajitas. Go on Tuesdays or Thursdays for half price margaritas.

I was being dragged along in tow by my wife who was having a crazy ass paper fetish that day (spent almost $50 at that Paper Source place). I had a crazy hankerin' for a margarita so I yelped it and voila: Mayan Palace. And guess what? It was our lucky day! My tequila craving became almost full blown delirium when I discovered that house margaritas were half off! We also happened to be in the neighborhood too. Couldn't have worked out better for us. Now, to the food. It was good, had large portions, but I believe there was some American-ized palate pleasing going on with some of the dishes. There is no reason for whipped cream on flan and the ceviche shoulda been spicier. Not even the bottle of hot sauce he gave us for it could do it any justice. Those margaritas were awesome though!

2009-09-29,4.0,I went to a birthday dinner at Mayan Palace and had a great time.  The restaurant easily accommodated our party of 12 with no problems.  Service was fast and efficient and the food was pretty standard.  I'm starting to think I'm not really the big fan of Mexican food that I once was because all my friends love this place but I thought it was pretty typical.  I had chicken enchiladas and while I wasn't crazy about the sauce the enchilada itself had a great flavor.   Two very friendly ladies brought around free samples of a margarita special they were having that night and they were awesome!  So awesome in fact that we had almost four pitchers.  Probably the best margarita I've had in quite some time.  All in all a good experience at Mayan Palace and it will definitely replace some of my other go-to Mexican places.,0.9965,0.626,0.356,0.018,0.5631904761904764

2009-08-04,5.0,"Mayan Palace Review Point #1 - Don't let the sign which otherwise might signal this is a cheapo, low-quality joint scare you away!  Honestly, I think this could be the #1 reason people don't go here and/or know about it until I rant and rave for 20 minutes about it.. Review Point #2 - Go here....now.   I'm somewhat of a Mexican food addict and can say without a doubt this the best Mexican restaurant in the area.  Yea, the front room is small and crowded (but mostly because people love this place so much) and the back room isn't an open-air patio and more like a covered tent (maybe my ONE complaint about this joint), but everything else is TOP NOTCH.. Service - nicest, most attentive service I have ever recieved, even compare to top-quality, five star restuarants.  You will not wait long for anything, and the servers even tag-team with each other, continually checking to see if you have everything. Food - excellent.  Guacamole is superb, always fresh, and I can say probably even better than that fancy tableside stuff you can get at the expensive mexican joint in Old Town on Wells (I won't name names..).  Try the more traditional dishes, but really anything is good.  My favorite is a traditional pork dish, the Chile Verde. Margaritas - good, not stellar in my view, but they just don't make them here like they do where I lived in Colorado so I'm a bit tough to please.  Nowhere in Chicago have I found a GREAT margarita, so if you think you've found, let me know!  They have a special on Tues and Thurs that packs the place so you know they must be pretty good. Overall experience - Awesome.  Like I said, go here.  I'll occassionally chat with the owner (usually after a couple margaritas so I can't remember his name at the moment) and tell him how great this place is.  I hope they continue doing well and expand into a bigger space, while still keeping all the things that make this such a wonderful place. ....if you're interested in a great #2 in the area, try El Nuevo.  Great patio, good food and service.  Otherwise, not sure I'd suggest many other places in the Lakeview/LP area considering quality, price, and overall experience for what you pay for..",0.999,0.706,0.269,0.025,0.5283068783068784

I had shrimp/fish tacos and they were sooo good. The fish was grilled and very cumin-colored. I am not sure what the marinade was, but that particular day, anyway, I will say they were the best I ever had. I am not a fan of radishes, but the radishes on top worked. I devoured my meal and thought of Yelping throughout.  As good as our food was, the service was even better. We had two waiters constantly coming to our table which was far, far away in the back, the only people way back there. You know, the sort of seating where the waiter does the three-stop only: Take the order, bring the food, bring the check. Not so! Someone was always making the hike to us without fail. Not at all intrusive, but we never wanted for water, chips, margs, or anything. I cannot say enough about how nice our service was.

We selected Mayan Palace for dinner because it met our three requirements: (1) Mexican food and margaritas, (2) close to where we were meeting our friends post-dinner, (3) accepts reservations. As an added bonus they offer  restaurant.com  certificates too. When I arrived, late as usual, my friends had already ordered a pitcher of margaritas to get the party started. I was a little disappointed that they settled on strawberry margaritas, I prefer regular ones on the rocks but I was pleasantly surprised by my first sip. Most times the flavored margaritas come off as syrupy spiked Slupree-like drinks, but these were fantastic they weren't syrupy tasting or artificially oversweet at all. My one complaint is that we had some trouble understanding our waiter and vice versa. In his book No + No = Yes; when the guacamole we told him we didn't like or want arrived at our table he quickly and graciously whisked it away no questions asked. I was also a bit put off by him repeatedly trying to charm/push us into ordering another pitcher or another round after declining and explaining we were running late to meet friends elsewhere - enough! He was good at making sure we had chips, salsa and water throughout our meal,  despite telling us the same lame joke three times during said meal. I ordered the Veggie Burrito Suizo dinner topped with salsa verde and it did not disappoint. The salsa has a little kick to it and complimented my burrito nicely.

However, Mayan Palace is also a step above some of the sketchier restaurants in this area (taco burrito palace #2, la bamba) in that it doesn't make me wonder if I might be getting sick after my meal.  The margaritas are tasty and half price on Tuesdays and Thursdays which is really the biggest selling point for me.

Jerk :)) so we don't end up actually getting here until about 615.  All the tables either have people at them or are marked reserved.  At this point Kelly gets very sad that it looks like she won't have the lovely-smelling Mexican food, the scent of which pulled her in by the nose.  HAVE NO FEAR, there's a giant room in back! Who would have known! You have to walk through a makeshift hallway that is clearly actually an alley to get there, but that added to the charm.  So we have time for margaritas and an appetizer.  Chips- perfect.  Margaritas- so good (and I find it hilarious that they try to give me the strawberry one my date ordered and give him my house margarita with salt :)).  Quesadilla- just enough to get us past starving so we can make it to the movie.  Well long story short- movie was sold out. So based on how promising round 1 was, we decided to come back to Mayan Palace to have the dinner we were supposed to have.  This was probably around 7:30-8, and there was still no wait for the back room.  We started off with the tortilla soup (date was still talking about it the next day, it was THAT GOOD).  After 2 more margaritas each and chips (I think all of which they again tried to reverse based on gender stereotypes- but I like my salty goodness!) we barely put a dent in our actual dinners, but my leftovers are calling my name (2 more hours till I'm home and can have them for dinner!).  Only thing I didn't LOVE was the salsa, but I like my salsa chunky so that was the only issue. Service was so friendly, I definitely enjoyed my evening here, both part 1 and 2 We have been back already too (only 2 weeks after the first time so it has to be pretty good).  After 8:30 it apparently gets pretty crowded, but I think we only waited for a table for about 15 minutes.  It would be a lot better in the summer if you can wait outside- here it is a bit of a pain, and I'd hate to be at one of the tables next to the bar.  Also I think we got charged for soups that never came but I am not sure because I didn't see the bill :) Hopefully we will make it for the margarita specials soon!",0.9899,0.792,0.139,0.07,0.5342114150624789

The staff here is outrageously nice! I picked up a lime off the floor that had fallen from a plate the waiter was carrying, and you would think I had just saved his life. The rest of the meal I was his hero, continually telling me how nice I was and saying thank you. When leaving he helped me put on my coat, and handed me a sculpture he made of me out of margarita salt. Okay I made up the part about the sculpture, but the rest is all true I promise.

The one thing was, being so small, we really weren't allowed the opportunity to sit and talk. They pretty much asked us if we were done to leave, but we were occupying a lot of space, and there were quite a few people waiting for tables so I sort of understand....

My fiance looked on yelp for a mexican place to eat tonight, he picked Mayan Palace and I had low expectations for a random mexican place in Lincoln Park. I thought it would be heavy and greasy and quick and I'd leave stuffed and feeling gross... BUT!!! This is the best mexican place I've ever visited! My fiance is a total food snob, KNOWS mexican food, and he loved it too.  We were greeted right at the door by the friendliest wait staff who asked our names and sat us immediately. Also, the tables aren't loaded with extra stuff (ads, plates, etc... I hate sitting down to an already crowded table!). It is truly a place where you feel like they WANT your business, they are there to provide great service and great food. The food is light (I had quesadillas - NOT heavy and greasy!), the guac is very smooth and light, tastes like it was JUST whipped up in back. The sodas are big and refillable (from a fountain!) and the salsa is PERFECT, spicy but mild and a great consistency.  My fiance had ceviche, and said it was super light, like a healthy salsa with protein added... Like other reviews have said, our server introduced us to the other wait staff, everyone working there got along really well, and everyone eating there was raving about the service and taste of the food. They called us by our names when asking if we wanted refills and when they brought our food. I think thats sweet, and a personal touch, and it impressed me. Our perfectly filling dinner was about $30 with soda and a beer, and I left a big tip.  It is without question our neighborhood place now, and it is light enough to eat there often, not heavy and greasy like we've found most mexican places to be.

I get that friendly service goes a long way to making a good restaurant experience, but there is such a thing as being TOO attentive to customers.  As in, ""you just thrust your face in mine two minutes ago to ask if I was doing okay, and guess what, nothing has changed since then, so yes, I am still doing okay, and you're starting to creep me out.""  And when you ask me three more times between ordering and when my food comes (a time span of about 20 minutes) - then I'm beginning to get annoyed. Also, when the waiter came to the table holding the water pitcher at a 30 degree angle so that he is literally pouring it all over the floor, my feet, my friend's legs, and the table, and then proceeded to say ""Would you like some water?"" I had to try very, VERY hard not to laugh in his face.  And the food... I was hoping that the extremely attentive service was not overcompensation for poor food, but it turns out my fears were justified.  I ordered combo #5 and found it to be quite bad - the tamale was all dried out, with leather meat inside, the enchilada was sub-par and overly greasy, and even though I ordered a corn tortilla for my quesadilla, I'm pretty sure I could have made the same thing at home with ingredients from Dominick's ""Hispanic Foods"" aisle.   All in all, a disappointing meal at what I was hoping would be a great new place (Yelpers led me astray for the first time!)",0.9343,0.77,0.139,0.091,0.5985736999625888

(We were in their covered, heated outdoor patio which was just slightly colder than their normal inside room.) Once again, we wouldn't go 3.4 seconds having an empty glass, cup, or basket of chips without an offer for a refill. This place is amazing. The service alone makes you want to eat here.

And yes, their margaritas are killer because they are fueled by what you put in your gas tank. And they taste that way, too, which is why I always I opt for a low-cal alternative, the pina colada. But this is a review for Mayan Palace--which is giving Cesar's a run for its money with their carne asada. And the margaritas are absolutely EXCELLENT. I only tried their basic house margarita, so no fancy flavorings or top-shelf tequila. But whatever they do to it, they do it just right. I don't drink margaritas often, because, often, they are mediocre. If this is your gripe, or if you are tired of settling for less-than-the-best, go to Mayan Palace. You will not be disappointed. Have it with a steak--it comes w/grilled onions and guacamole. What more do you need?",0.0807,0.821,0.096,0.083,0.7510714285714286

I met a friend at Mayan Palace last night, and we were both shocked at how good it was, despite all the raving reviews we'd read beforehand. The staff is warm and friendly, even when they have to fight through a crowd of people waiting for tables at the bar. Two men greeted me at the door and told me it'd be about 20 minutes before we got a table, and within 10 minutes, we had fresh margaritas from the bar (omg BANANA) and were seated at our table. My friend and I split the queso fundido, which was dripping with healthy deliciousness and served with piping hot tortillas, followed by my chicken enchiladas suizas and her combo platter. I can't speak to hers--and it was so smothered with food from edge to edge that I couldn't even tell you what all was on it--but my enchiladas were good.  And I say only good because the sauce tasted more than a little like barbecue sauce (there goes that star), which I can respect as a Kansas City native, but not in my Mexican food, please and thank-you.

As other reviewers have mentioned, the service at Mayan Palace is great and the staff are extremely friendly.  There is not a lot of space in the restaurant, and the tables can feel a bit cramped.  It can get especially crowded on Tuesdays and Thursdays for half-price house margaritas.  In the summer they open the back patio which provides a ton more seating, even if it feels like you're eating in someone's backyard.  This is definitely a place to go for the food and friendliness, not necessarily ambiance.",0.9694,0.866,0.134,0.0,0.5103125

The menu is ginormous and it took me FOREVER to decide (my dinner pal was not too impressed since she decided on the Taco Salad first thing).  A last minute decision, I went with the taco - tostada - cheese enchilada combo.  A good mix with rice n' beans.  The enchilada was probably my least favorite - I think it needed some meat for flavor.  Still, I want to come back and try everything.  I think this is economically possible due to the wallet-friendly total.  Always a nice surprise!",0.9669,0.74,0.211,0.049,0.45833333333333337

2006-09-14,5.0,"I recently moved to Chicago from Memphis where I had a favorite Mexican restaurant that I would eat at nearly once a week. Now that I am living in the Windy City I have been on a search for a new favorite. And I think I have found it. My wife and I went there the other night after 10pm (they are open until 11pm Sunday-Thursday and midnight Friday-Saturday). Upon sitting down, we were offered the standard chips and salsa (Warning: the salsa has a bit of spice to it.) We also ordered guacamole as an appetizer which was not only quite tasty but plentiful. For the main meal, I got the Steak Enchilada Supreme which comes with rice and beans. Like the salsa, the dish here had a little spice to it. And while certainly not overpowering by any means, it might be a little too much for those who like their dishes mild. Myself, I like the little kick and the meal was quite delicious. Also, the dish was clearly served with very fresh ingredients. As for the restaurant itself, the place was small but charming and relaxed. And the service was very prompt and generous.
