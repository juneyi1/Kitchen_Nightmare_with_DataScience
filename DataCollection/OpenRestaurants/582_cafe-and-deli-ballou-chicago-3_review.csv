What really makes this place special isn't the tangible elements mentioned above...but the very genuine hospitality. I can honestly say that Khosro went from being a friendly host upon our first visit to a genuine friend after our second, third, and all our subsequent visits.

I am currently studying for the biggest exam of my life to date and need a decent place to study with internet (just moved into a new apartment, and just my luck, the internet has been a pain to set up).  Day 1 went something like this: I ordered an iced chai and a breakfast bagel only to realize afterwards that I had forgotten my wallet. Not much of a surprise to me but still quite embarrassing. As I inform the waiter that I have to leave/come back because of aforementioned reason, he happily gives me my chai and tells me he'll make my bagel as soon as I get back. I'm already sold at this point. My chai was everything I needed it to be walking back in 80-degree weather. If you're looking for quiet, this is your place. I got just as much studying done as I would if I were at a library except that here you get chai's too. The only reason I don't give it my full approval is due to the fact that they don't open late.  At all.  Regardless, I've been coming here ever since I forgot my wallet and plan on doing so for more wallets to come.

The one who helped me seemed like owner/manager, he was very sweet and did not look down upon me for having a groupon .. which i always appreciate! Side street parking ( for my lazy butt) and the fact that its away from most ""hip"" milwakee ave place is such a HUGE PLUS! They have two corners to lounge around and ample tables/ chairs. When i walked in, the manager was just chillen on the side, drinking coffee and working on his ipad ( looking like one of the patrons) but was readily available to assist me as i entered. He was very sweet. My large dirty chai was 4$, which is comparable to starbucks. Unfortunately, i was not a huge fan of it, it was a bit too watery for my taste. I was ofcourse too shy to ask him to fix it, as i was using a groupon. But if i do return, i will ask him to make it a bit more heavier ( milkier). I also got a bagel with CC which was 4.50 ( a bit priceier than im used to for just a bagel with cream cheese). But with my groupon, i was not complaining. If i went in there without a groupon, i would probably have eaten at home or gotten a quick bagel for 1.00 from dominics. They looked like they had two diff types of cakes in the shelf priced at 3.00/slice, which i think is reasonable .They also have jazz bands on sundays and poetry days, which i may return for :) Free wifi a +++ I havent checked for plug availablity unfortunately.

Also, the owner's not a hipster at all. He's Iranian, very friendly and very, very funny. He also gets excited if he sees you playing chess in his establishment, and may ask you for a game.

Well, I happened upon it today and had a very different experience. The barista this time was not friendly and from the beginning he seemed annoyed that I had come in. I was hoping to get out of the heat and cuddle-up in the corner with a cool, iced-late. I got situated on the pillows and he brought over my drink - probably the WORST iced-late I've ever had. I tried another couple sips but couldn't drink anymore. I went up to him and said I thought the coffee tasted a little burnt. He acted pissed that he had to remake it and brought me a new one. This was even worse. I really didn't want to interact with him again, so I tried to choke it down - horrible! It tasted like the milk was sour this time. I gave up after 2 sips.

But the lights were on, and a few people were hanging out, so we sauntered in to the sounds of a cellist playing on a little stage in the front window.  We walked in to what felt like a private party, but ended up just being the intimate setting of this coffee shop. The decor is pretty great, quirky interesting art hanging on the walls, chairs and couches, as well as a little pillow and table area set into the other front window's ""stage"" area. The guy working there welcomed us right away, and started chatting us up. Very friendly, and informative about all their menu items and where they come from. The fare itself was not amazing, but it was good. The mocha was pretty standard (although I only got a single shot, so maybe it's not fair to judge). The pumpkin cheesecake was all right, but the coffee cake was really good.  All in all, this is a great little coffee shop to hang out in if you live in the area, or if you happen to be sitting out a band or two from the bottle.",0.9923,0.789,0.167,0.044,0.5407154528478058

The real thing that won me over was the playlist: mellow, appropriate, but quality tunes -i.e. Ben Harper, Arcade Fire.  You can really enjoy a book or cram for a test here.  I wouldn't recommend it for a serious chat or group meeting.  The place is very cozy and your conversation is likely to disrupt others.   PS- outdoor seating!!",0.9609,0.7,0.207,0.093,0.6810606060606061

COOLEST FEATURE:  Pillow window seats!  So comfy that you feel a little inappropriate sitting in them. Personally, I come to this cafe, named after the boat that brought the Ukranians here, to lesson plan in a more library-like environment (getting me out of my apartment where I am more likely to watch youtube or fall asleep than do my work).  But if you want to enjoy the atmosphere, you better start coming in droves, bringing your friends (and maybe even some enemies) because hot damn it is expensive to run a coffee shop in chicago and we would not want starbucks to buy it out.",0.9768,0.824,0.142,0.035,0.5099206349206349

It's the name of the boat that brought the cafe's founders to America and on one wall, you can find documentation about this. Inside, it's like an upscale indie coffee shop. Not so upscale as to have attitude, but much nicer than a hole-in-the-wall coffee shop.  Tables are large and comfortable, there's enough light to read. At times it's been a bit warm before the AC was turned on, but the owners are obliging. There are big overhead fans that are set at just the right speed, and even on most sunny days, these keeps the temperature just right. The owners take real pride in their place, and it's clear that people from the neighborhood know them.

It's always been really convenient when I don't have time or resources to make it myself. I just started a new job and was able to swing by yesterday morning at 7:35 a.m. to get my iced coffee and a danish before jumping on the bus. I was so excited that I had this option as the office only has regular hot coffee that is just terrible.  Today, I headed out the door and went directly to Cafe Ballou, an action I expected to be my new morning routine, only to discover that they don't open until 8 a.m.  I was so disappointed. I don't understand the idea of a coffee shop not opening until 8 a.m. Isn't most of the point to get coffee in the hands of people in the morning? Don't most people have to be at work by 8.m.? Wouldn't it then be a good decision to open a coffee shop before 8.m.? Maybe the a.m. folks are not their target.

As soon as I pulled up I knew I was going to like this place. The outside matches the inside -- whimsical and creative. The inside has a mish-mosh of cozy and cool second-hand furniture. I mention the atmosphere before the coffee because it's the atmosphere that makes me like this place so much. There are random knick-knacks around and a lot of things to look at, but it doesn't feel overwhelmingly cluttered. I especially like the menu to the left written on a mirror with a neat frame. Oh, and free wi-fi! I got my usual soy vanilla latte to go and a breakfast sandwich of egg & cheese on a croissant. The latte was not that great, actually. They brew Intelligentsia, so I was expecting better. It was just a hair better than Starbucks. (I don't mind Starbucks coffee but their lattes are sub-par. Caribou is way below Starbucks, if you are trying to determine my taste rating-system.....or lack thereof.) However, my croissant was very yummy! It took a while to prepare everything, but I expect that in a small coffee shop and don't mind at all. I appreciate that it's just one person making my stuff and they put care into it. Feels small-town to me. I will be visiting again to try a normal cup of joe and enjoy the ambiance and a book. The ladies behind the counter were very lovely. I walked out feeling very pleasant about the whole experience. The lack of one star is for the not spectacular latte.",0.9947,0.759,0.208,0.033,0.5466534391534392

Technical barista expertise on a scale of 1-10: I give a ""3"".  Also -there's hardly anything else going on in this treeless, concrete-heavy, car-infested stretch of Western.  The service was so-so. Some relative of the owner brought their kid into the cafe when 3-4 people were quietly reading and let the child yell, talk loudly and shamelessly misbehave for attention. That irked me.

2007-09-18,4.0,"Today is my birthday and it promises to be adventure packed. To kick off the day, I decided to venture into Chicago and enjoy an afternoon at a cafe before heading down to Chinatown to join friends for a bacchanalia. I wanted a charming little place with free wi-fi and plenty of outlets for laptops; near Metra's Western station, my sister's studio, the Empty Bottle, and other transportation options; and with a good assortment of grubs. How does an out-of-towner locate such an establishment? Read Yelp, of course! I settled on Cafe Ballou based especially on Yelp reviews that touted its European flavor. Unfortunately, I couldn't tell what was especially European about this cafe other than the photographs and map of Eastern Europe. Its ambience is more country shabby chic than Old World European. The space definitely has a woman's touch. An assortment of Chicago free publications were available. The tables were generous but not so huge as to prohibit conversation. The wi-fi, as touted, was reliable as were the service and the food. Christina, the owner, was not there, but Jennifer was very friendly and helpful. Their house-brewed iced tea was very flavorful and the chicken sandwich and salad solid (although I think she mistakenly gave me turkey rather than chicken). Overall, although this cafe is not really my style, I can see a lot of people really enjoying this space.
