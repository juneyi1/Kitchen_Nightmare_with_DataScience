2017-09-02,4.0,"Many local Argentinians have recommended this place to me and said that it is the best in the city. It also just so happened that on the way to Jeni's, our uber driver also recommended it to us. I went in with friends, as a group of four.  We ordered the Medio Pollo al Limon and Lomo Relleno. The amount of food we anticipated was not even close to the amount that we got. We thought what we ordered would be a good amount of the four of us. The amount that we got could feed a small village. The Medio Pollo al Limon could have fed at least me and 2 other girlfriends. The lemon and chicken combination was delicious. It had just the right amount of tangyness that was present but still enjoyable. The Lomo Relleno was a tad overwhelming. The meat was cooked so perfectly. It was tender and flavor was present wherever your teeth sunk in. However, I must say that it was a bit too salty, and the mushrooms that were included in were extremely salty. We only finished half of the Lomo Relleno, and I took about a quarter of it home and ended up splitting it into 4 meals (I could only eat so much of it each meal).  This is definitely somewhere I would refer to as romantic. The lights are extremely dim and for the most part don't light your table. Candles brighten up your table, but can be sensitive for some eyes. At Tango Sur, the amount of food definitely matches up with the price you pay, if not more. Make sure you're super hungry, or that you're coming with a big group!",0.9905,0.843,0.143,0.014,0.5575140809011777
2017-09-01,4.0,"Was recommended here by our Uber driver, who's Argentinian. I came with a group of four, and we ordered the Medio Pollo al Limon and the Lomo Relleno. I'm not sure if it was because we weren't super hungry, or if we had just ate early, but these two plates were MORE than enough for the four of us. First off, the atmosphere in Tango Sur is ideal for dates, as it is very dark and each table has only one light provided by a candle. My friend and I blew out the candles because our eyes were starting to water, but the girls in our party were oddly not affected by it. When the food arrived, we had to use our phone's flashlights because we couldn't see what we we're eating, it just looked like a big steaming pile of darkness LOL.  The Lomo Relleno (42 dollars) is for two people, but it can honestly feed 3-4 people. The meat is very tender and chewy, and has enough juice to make it very flavorful. The only downside is that eating such a big portion as this dish can be tiring, and also gets to become too salty. There are strips of portobello mushroom on top, that make for a good side dish when your mouth is tired from chewing the meat. This dish is HUGE. The four of us only ended up eating half of it, and my girlfriend and I split the rest to take home. I had enough meat for two dinners!! The Medio Pollo al Limon (18 dollars) is also a pretty big dish, and could satisfy two people. I really like lemon/sour food so the chicken was very good. in my opinion. It also came with a side of potatoes that were also tasty and very soft.  For the price you pay, you get a tooooon of food, so be sure to really gauge how hungry you are before you and your friends each order an individual dish. Also, bring some goggles with you if your eyes be sensitive to things such as onions..and candle flames hehe.",0.9929,0.81,0.148,0.042,0.5615242165242165

The bread was also great and nice and warm. For dinner I had the filet and it was cooked to perfection and the mashed potatoes included a nice flavor to then. Overall my family and I were very happy with this place and hope to return again before going back to NY.

We brought our own bottles of wine since it's BYOB. We started the meal with corn and ham and cheese empanadas and a provoleta. Both we very good. Only issue was the provoleta didn't come with more bread so we had to flag someone down to get more. We all shared the parrillada para dos which was steak, short ribs, chorizo, sausage, fried sweetbread and blood sausage. I am usually not a fan of blood sausage, but this one was very nice. The steak was great, as was the short ribs. The chorizo was fine. I'm not a fan of sweetbreads because of the chewy texture, but I heard they were good too. It came with salads on the side which were also nice. We all left very full and still had some leftover to take home, so our whole meal probably could have fed 4 adults.

2017-08-20,4.0,"Whether it is their amazing steaks, the atmosphere or that you BYOB Tango Sur is popular for a reason. They do not allow call aheads. Someone else mentioned a reservation, though I was not aware they accepted them. So either try a reservation or make sure you have the time to wait (and we wanted two hours on a Saturday night) because it is worth it. The staff is not good at estimating how long the wait will be. I suspect that this is due to diners lingering after the meal after having succeeded in scoring a table. The staff does not rush diners out the door either. There are several bars in the immediate area that are good so as long as you plan ahead and are not immediately hungry. You can also go buy a bottle of wine at their sister restaurant next door.  The patio is pleasant and the interior is dark, lite primarily by candles. It's a romantic and cozy atmosphere, though it can get a bit loud. The service is friendly, though a bit slow (again, make sure you have enough time as to not feel rushed). While Tango is a steak place they do offer other options. One in our group was not a red meat eater and ordered the half chicken. I was impressed how well they did chicken. Perfectly roasted and seasoned. My steak was amazing and cooked exactly to order. It came with mashed potatoes, and this is where I was disappointed. If you are going to do a great steak do not ignore the side. Others ordered sweet potatoes, steak fries and asparagus and all of these sides were very good. So stay away from the mashed and you'll be satisfied.",0.9875,0.791,0.159,0.05,0.5781381381381381
2017-08-18,1.0,"Talk about ruining a perfectly good Saturday night, as this was one of the worst dining experiences this foodie has endured. Arrived at 8 pm and left at 12:30 am. The host took our names down at 8 pm and informed us it would be close to 10pm but they were sure to get us in sooner. At 10:10 we inquired about the wait and were then told it would be 15 more minutes. We were eventually seated at 11pm. We had the antipasto for an appetizer and weren't totally impressed, but hard to screw up deli items. Then we had the Pariladas for Two (possibly misspelled). It came with a house salad, which resembled the ingredients & presentation of the toppings of a burger. The meats eventually came out and the presentation was outstanding, but unfortunately that was it. The sausage (chorizo) was fine but the rest was very fatty and chewy. It was so rough, I chipped a tooth while chewing. We did proceed cautiously to order dessert and ordered the cheesecake. It was actually very very good. If you want a dark cozy spot with a great vibe that is BYOB and you can hang out and clog tables however long you desire and could careless about food, then this is your place. The best part of the experience: going down to Grasslands and eating their breadstick appetizers as we were filling time during our long wait.

We tried a spinach and cheese empanada and eggplant empanada, which were both delicious. We also shared the seafood salad, which was very light and refreshing. Our main course, however, took FOREVER....we had to ask the waiter where our food was it took over an hour! Finally when the food came, I immediately regretted getting the Lomo rare. It was basically like eating raw chewy beef. The other steak dishes were very deliciously cooked and seasoned though. We also brought an ice cream cake for my birthday that we had the restaurant store in the freezer. However, the waiter brought it out and left it sitting at the counter without giving it to us. By the time he brought it over, my cake had melted! I was devastated. We ate whatever ice cream soup was left and couldn't take it home.

It only took 15 minutes to grab a table on a Saturday night and the vibe was exactly to my liking.

From the various proteins ordered that night the stars were the parrillada and lomo relleno. They were all cooked perfectly to our liking, and coincidentally paired very well with the wine we brought. It was actually this restaurant that inspired us to learn how to make chimichurri sauce at home. The filets with spinach mashed potatoes were also very delicious.

First off, his seat was wet when we first sat down , we didn't notice because of the dark atmosphere so he had to sit through dinner with his pants soaked.  Server took 10-15mins to get back to us to take our order. That was still fine considering we weren't ready when he first came over. My bf got the fillet mignon, medium, and it ""tasted like bubblegum"", according to him. I tried a piece and it was indeed chewy like rubber. It looks like it's done right, medium like requested, but we just got a really subpar meat. I don't remember having a fillet mignon this bad. My Tbone veal was at least decent. I liked the spicy sauce that came with it. AFTER the busboy cleared our plates, we waited at least 20 minutes and the server never came back to offer us desserts or the check.

The empanadas and antipasto apps were also delicious. I tasted everyone else's meals as well, and they were all great. The vibe is rustic, casual, and welcoming. And, of course, BYOB. The bad: The service was not up to expectations. Our waiter didn't really have app recommendations. After ordering apps, he took a long time to come back to take our main order, and then our bill took a considerable amount of time.

My favorite dish to order here is the filet, and to split it. Nobody ever believes that it's enough food for two people with its $29 price tag. It is, I promise. If you're worried, try an appetizer, empanadas or antipasto. Yes, there will be a wait. Prepare yourself, delicious meats are waiting on the other end for you. It's also BYOB and they have an area in the back for waiting and it's stocked with wine glasses and bottle openers for you. The wait here does not bother me. I personally enjoy the atmosphere, I like it noisy. Everyone seems to be having a good time and enjoying the company of friends and family. It is dark, again I dig it, it adds to the whole experience. Also, I would bathe in the chimichurri. Everything 5 star. I also have to mention on time I was here, sitting next to a nice couple, seemed to be first date vibes by questions they were asking, slightly awkward vibes, etc. They were dressed very nicely, he was wearing a suit.

They have outside seating which is cute during the warm season. All male staff with a vintage Argentine/Spanish feel to it. Happy medium place in terms of dress attire and price. You can either make this a dress date night or a more casual date night. No complaints for our waiter. We asked a couple questions regarding the food and he was helpful however I wish I would have asked more.  Tips:  1. It is VERY noisy.  2. Extreme dim lights. I'm a huge fan of dim lights but Tango Sur had them just a tad too dim.  3. BYOB - My guest were a little disappointed I didn't inform them. I basically didn't really clearly see this. Lacked advertisement of BYOB.   4. Depending on your plate and appetite make sure you ask or read menu carefully. I made the mistake of not ordering a ""side"" dish. We ordered an empanada which is a smaller empanada but tasted amazing! Our main meal was the parillada for 2 which is ONLY meat. Most plates come with a small side salad but I had an appetite and should have ordered a side of veggies or potatoes. The meat was great however It was a tad too salty. I am a pink Himalayan salt consumer and the meat left my lips/mouth tingly, dry & dehydrated, holding onto water for a couple day's (bodybuilder & health nut problems) lol. They also serve awesome bread that was nice & warm & fresh with butter!  5. When I called to make reservations I was a little bummed they didn't question an occasion for reservation.

And the pastry encasing the fillings were the perfect crunchy texture. I wish we could've tried all the different kinds they had on the menu but the beef and chicken ones were delicious. We ordered the el filet and the costeleta for our main course and they are SUPER generous with their servings. I mean, we could have easily ordered just one of the dishes and we'd still leave with happy tummies! Tango sur knows how to cook their meats, I haven't had such a perfectly cooked steak in a looonngg time and the mashed potatoes that came as a side were on point. As delicious as the food was, there was no way we could've finished everything but that just meant we had leftovers to look forward to the next day :)  Not only did I love the food, but I loved how it was a candlelit dinner.

This place is a living, breathing joke that has people fooled into thinking that its some place that has great service and great food. Two friends and I went around 7:30pm on a Friday night, was told it would be about an hour and a half wait and that we could grab drinks at the place next door (that they own as well). We came back and waited and we went inside as it started getting cold. The long-haired waiter with some low-grade Mary J. Blige bob-cut asked us--two African American males and one Middle Eastern male--to wait outside but didn't ask the three straight Caucasian patrons to wait outside. He remarked that if we didn't wait outside, he'd have to call his manager. However, when he finally did ask the other three to wait outside, they refused and he said to them that he didn't want to call the manager to cause a scene and ruin everyone else's experience. When I asked him why he didn't make the other three wait outside, he remarked again about not wanting to cause a scene. When I pointed out the perception that he asked us to wait outside vs. them (even though our names were on the last way before theirs were), he said he ""understood"" and apologized and and I said, ""No, you don't understand. You're basically asking US, who were here first, to wait outside and you're letting THEM wait inside because you feel THEY would cause a scene vs. three who were here first and haven't said a word except say thank you when our phone numbers were taken.""

So next to the racial discrimination by the host, the food was decent. There wasn't anything about the food or service inside that made any of us confirm why is this place so popular. There are TONS of restaurants in the city of Chicago. People are better off going to McDonald's, Chipotle, Wendy's or the Dairy Queen around the corner from this place and getting a better experience than this joke of a steakhouse.

2017-03-02,1.0,I'm really disappointed with Tango Sur. I had a reservation at 7pm for 15  and parking is a really big issue. We kept circulating the streets to find a nearby parking and nothing. We had to park in a public parking space and paid $16 for it. Valet parking would be convenient in this location. We ended up leaving because we did not feel welcome as we walked in. Don't know the person's name but he looked like the manager. He was standing in the host station and i believe he was Caucasian. He immediately scolded at my arrival and said that he needed my table at 9pm for another reservation. I let him know that parking is an issue and my guest would be here at any moment. He seemed flustered at said that they needed to be here in the next few minutes. He said to go stand in the corner by the door and wait. Not only i felt rushed but I felt unwelcomed. Disappointment is the word for this place. I wanted to celebrate my husband's birthday and this place went sour in 1 minute. It doesn't matter if the place has delicious food. Good service starts at the door and it ends when we leave. We will not be coming back.,0.8361,0.865,0.076,0.059,0.4180555555555556

2017-02-20,4.0,"Before I rave about the food, BE WARNED: This place is ALWAYS busy, and even if you make a reservation (as we did, weeks in advance for our Valentine's day reservation), you will likely have to wait for your table for upwards of 30 minutes to an hour.  If you are the kind of patron who can't stand this amount of waiting, this may not be the place for you. If you can stomach the waiting, IT IS WORTH IT.  Honestly, the wait time is the only reason this review is for 4 stars instead of 5 for me.  We ordered the fried cheese appetizer (excellent, if cheese is your thing, and it is absolutely my thing) and split the Para Dos as an entree, which is a collection of different sausages and other meats that arrives at your place still sizzling and smells as good as it tastes. For meat lovers, this dish is heaven. It is designed to be split between two people, and if you're moderately hungry, is the perfect amounts. There is a salad course that comes before the meat, which is nothing special, but you don't go to an Argentine steakhouse to eat salad. The restaurant is dark, candle lit, romantic, and has a distinct Argentine influence that is evident in the decor and music.  While getting into the restaurant and dealing with the front door staff could have been more pleasant, I will say that the wait staff inside the restaurant were all friendly, efficient, and professional.  My top three tips: 1) This place is BYOB, no corkage fee! If you're worried about not finishing what you bring, don't worry, they'll re-cork for you. 2) Be vigilant and patient when waiting for your table.  Continue to ask the host about your reservation/status of your table and make sure he remembers your name and the number in your party. You will eventually be seated, but you can expedite the process by keeping your party in the front of his mind. 3) Order beef, it's their specialty!",0.9893,0.844,0.131,0.025,0.618832671957672

2017-02-20,1.0,"I had a very unfortunate experience here last week. We made reservations for 2/14/2017 on Valentine's Day about 3 weeks in advance for 9pm. When the 14th came, we called at 6pm to confirm the reservations and we were told everything was good to go. When we arrived at 9pm, it was a much different story. We were told by the host there were no available tables, and even if we had a reservation we would have to wait in line outside. We weren't the only ones who didn't have their reservation times honored, there were at least 20 other people waiting outside for their reserved tables. This would have been excusable considering the busy Valentine's Day evening, however, the host was very detached, unconcerned and rude when speaking with us and the other guests outside. We told him we had a reservation at 9pm and he said he would check on it for us, but then did nothing and continued staring at the line outside. When we asked him the approximate wait time, he said "" We're dealing with a situation right now and we'll let you know.""  For one of the most well known Argentinean restaurants of Chicago, this level of service is embarrassing and casts a very poor light on the rest of the staff and the restaurant as a whole.

WE WAITED 3 HOURS! we were so hungry; we would not have chosen not to eat on principle. we were not brought our appetizer, we voiced our issue with the texture and temperature of what we ordered and were continually asked ""well what do you want to do?"" ultimately, we were given half off our meal, but it is already affordable, so that's not what we cared about. we wanted our time back; the buildup and anticipation of a great eatery that hugely underdelivered when we could have spent our time elsewhere that isn't complacent with their four stars or confusing being busy with being good. it will catch up with them if they are not careful.   Tango Sur- we are not stupid; a lot of people cook their own beef and know a filet when they see one. you are not serving premium cuts of beef to your after 10pm crowd on Saturday's. if i am misguided, your waitstaff had every chance to prove me wrong, but they just held a flashlight to my meat and debated me. i am genuinely disappointed to have lost my favorite 'special occasion' place.",0.912,0.773,0.128,0.099,0.5685867895545315

2017-01-02,2.0,"I'm afraid this quaint little Argentinian steakhouse is sadly overrated. The decor is lovely and my companion and I were enchanted by the lovely staff and actual candlelight. We started with the prosciutto and melon. Fairly good though I'll admit melon is out of season, so not the best choice for a January evening. My companion had the steak Vesuvio, stuffed with cheese and spinach. I had the bone-in ribeye with olive oil and garlic. Beautiful flavor in the Au jus on both steaks however regrettable this did not translate to the steak itself. Our primary concern was the apparently low grade of beef used - the tough, almost stringy texture suggested frozen meat that was thawed before being grilled to our request of medium. Extremely disappointing given the $30 price point for each steak. Both entrees came with potatoes - mine with mashed potatoes (very nice actually) and my companions with wedges - soggy from au jus. We also ordered a side of sautéed spinach so we had some green to round out the meal. The spinach again was clearly frozen - coagulated, dry, and overwrought. Perhaps we caught the kitchen staff on a bad night but I we won't be returning to Tango Sur.

From my limited experience of Argentina, the Chimichurri sauce at Tabgo Sur is much more garlicky  (pleasantly so) and less acidic than you would find in Buenos aires. I LOVE IT! The provoleta is as good as it sounds. If melted provolone on a plate doesn't sound good to you, don't get it. If it does, you won't be disappointed.  The Ensalada Tango Sur is nothing to cry home about. It's just crispy lettuce with a few large round pieces of sliced tomato and rings of onion. It's only $6 for a reason and I honestly think it should be provided for free or t lest half that. I came for the bife de chorizo. I have not yet had a bife de chorizo in Chicago that's as good as what I experienced as a student in Buenos Aires. This is close but not quite there. I ordered it medium well and they served it well and tough. Steak should be crispy outside and tender and juicy inside. Never tough. No matter how you order it.

In regards to main entrees, I've only had their steak meals.  During my most recent visit I tried the steak that was stuffed with spinach and cheese (I forgot the name of this dish), and it was a really good meal.  The portion sizes for the steak are on the larger side, and it would be possible to share a steak meal with 1 other person.  Leftovers from this place aren't bad either though.",0.9887,0.822,0.156,0.022,0.5799227799227801

However, that does not excuse this restaurant's completely unorganized, antiquated reservation system. Our party of three arrived on a Saturday night a little before 8:30pm, and my friend put his name down for us. It's essentially one man holding a tiny black notepad that you probably get at the dollar store. He scribbled my friend's name in there and quoted 9:45pm. Not ideal, but we decided to wait. We're all chatting and drinking while we wait to be called. When 9:45pm finally rolls around, my friend noticed that various party sizes (including those who waited after we arrived and parties of three) kept being seated throughout the time we waited. My friend went to the host to inquire about our position in line and get the approximate remaining wait time to which the host replies that they're busy. Another 20 minutes roll by, and we decided to leave and dine at Machu Picchu where there was zero wait. It's apparent that he didn't go in order and just flipped back and forth through his scribbles to find the next party of his choosing.

Best thing ever. And the servers (there are a LOT of them) are all very nice. I'm sure I'll be back soon to try more dishes,0.9884,0.724,0.276,0.0,0.6988783068783069

We both ordered the bife ancho, medium done. The dipping sauce that came with the steak was pretty good. While I thought my steak was flavorful and good, my partners steak was not cooked well. Her steak was burned on the outside and left not too well cooked on the inside. My steak did not have a burned or bitter taste to it. Unfortunately she couldn't eat much of her steak.

2016-09-06,4.0,"Aside from the wait time to get a table here, I really enjoyed the ambiance and food here. The interior is VERY dimly lit and they have each table lit with real candles that seem to burn way too quickly and spew wax over the candle holder and onto the table. Not really a big deal, but I could imagine some people having issues with a constant flow of wax onto the table. To be honest, I can't say that I've been to an Argentine BBQ place before, so here we go! Anyways, first thing is first... BYOB. Yep. You read that right, this place is BYOB. So feel free to bring a bottle of wine or two to enjoy with your meal, or if you're like my friends a bottle of wine per person. *SMH*  I came in knowing that we would go for a meat platter or two here, so we did start with two orders of salad to share for the table. I don't recall which salad we had ordered, but I do remember it having mixed greens, tomatoes, & onions. Nothing fancy really but overall fresh. We did start with some empanadas (Beef, chicken, and spinach & cheese to be exact) and of the three, for sure the spinach & cheese was my favorite. The beef and chicken empanadas were enjoyable not to take anything away from them, but I just preferred the spinach & cheese is all. Be sure to lather those empanadas up with the provided chimichurri sauce! For a table of four, we ordered one order of the Para Uno (short ribs, sausage, beef sweetbread, and black sausage) and one order of the Para Dos (short ribs, flap meat, sausage, beef sweetbread, and black sausage). Food was good for three people, but this was definitely more than enough food for the four of us. Meats were all tender and juicy and as I recall the black sausage being somewhat on the sweet side. Overall really enjoyable meal in my opinion, just be prepared to EAT. I would come back again. For now that's all I got on this one, 'til next time cheers!",0.9969,0.824,0.176,0.0,0.478152557319224

I love that this place is BYOB and has reasonably priced steaks.  But my steak was just not good.  I had a bone-in rib eye.  It was excessively fatty and, while I asked for medium, was waaay overcooked to well done.  I could barely eat half of it.  Two other people in my party were also very disappointed with their steaks.   Service was also subpar.  One person's order was screwed up. It happens, not a big deal, just fix it.  But our waiter handled it very poorly.  He offered no apology and was very resistant to taking it back to fix it despite the fact that it was wrong.  We also made it clear how we wanted our check split and he just put it all on one anyway.

They don't take reservations for parties fewer than 6, so we showed up about 20 minutes after opening on a Friday. We got there, and they told us the wait would be about 75 minutes, but that they are guessing they would seat us at 7:15. No big...except we'd been lugging around a bunch of booze. So we went down to the Italian restaurant next door, that also happened to be BYOB, and ordered an appetizer while we waited (plus, it gave us a chance to prevent our beers from getting warm)! About 6:35 (more than half an hour before they told us the table would be ready), I got a phone call from the host, telling us our table was ready. We were still mid-appetizer at the place next door, so I told the host that we were next door but would finish our appetizers and would be there in 10 minutes. I got an audible sigh on the other end, and ""um..okay."" As others have remarked, the ambience is dark, sexy, and..a bit cramped?! The restaurant wasn't huge, but it seated a good amount of people. I had a party of 4 so we ordered 3 empanadas, a numero uno, a numero dos, and spinach mashed potatoes. The food was OK. Not great, and the meat was extremely tough. The portions were large, and with tip, we were looking at a mere $27 a person.

The chimichurri sauce was so delicious with the steak and this dish was decadent and huge.   BYOB is a huge perk, I greatly enjoyed the red I brought from home with the steak (and appreciated saving the money!).   The service for a huge group was on point.  The atmosphere is very dark with candles, would be kind of romantic if it wasn't so loud and a bit hectic.   Overall highly recommend.",0.9952,0.7,0.3,0.0,0.6042500000000001

2016-08-08,4.0,"Nice spot near Wrigleyville in Chicago. My first recommendation is if you want to see your food try to get a table outside. We had a party of 8 and did the call ahead and had no trouble getting a table outside. The appetizers we had were awesome! I would go back for just the empanadas and the melted cheese dip!  I got the filet and shared it with another person. Believe me, unless you are ravenous, you can share it too and be completely happy. The filet comes with TWO filets and a side of their spinach mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes were tasty and the steak was cooked perfectly! Very satisfying meal.  I do have two gripes about the place. 1. They require you to do a splitting cost if you are going to split the entree (I hate that). and 2. They touted the splitting cost by saying it added another side salad to meal for the person you were splitting with. Talk about a letdown when those salads hit the table. I wouldn't even call it a salad. It was basically the topping you put on a hamburger. Couple leafs of lettuce, couple tomato slices and a couple onion slices. If that was your first impression of the restaurant it would not be a good start. Lucky for us we had the delicious apps to begin and just set the crappy salads aside. Work on those and this place easily gets a 5 star.  One huge plus about this place is that it's BYOB. No corking fee, nothing. That is one helluva perk. I really liked the place and I would go back in a heart beat.

When he finally came back to help us, I gave him my name and told him that we had a reservation for 6:30 (it was 6:35 or so) He looked at his watch and said ""it'll be 15-20 minutes.""  I said ""what's the point of a reservation then?""

The steak is of high quality, and prices are VERY VERY reasonable for what you get! The one issue I have had with Tango Sur is that certain tables (inside and outside) are much better than others - I do not believe you can reserve a specific table, so we ended up waiting a bit longer than our reserved time so that we could sit at a decent table.

We came back at 8:45 to check in with the doorman, and he snobbishly told me he said 9:00 or 9:15 pm. We waited around out front until 9:15 and then decided to go elsewhere to eat. I think basically you have to smooth talk the doorman and persuade him to like you in order to get seated, there actually is no first come first serve guideline that the restaurant follows. It's like trying to get into Studio 54; ""you're hot, you can come in"". I'm sure the food is just fantastic though. ...",0.8053,0.89,0.077,0.033,0.4611111111111112

My boyfriend and I have been here several times with friends and family from out of town and everything we've had has been delicious.

We also have had the lomo for two and it's a huge plate! Depending on how hungry your table is, you could arguably split this between three.  I was hesitant to check it out at first because they don't take reservations for parties under 6 but they have this great waiting room in the back where you can open up your wine and get your night started while you wait for your table.

2016-07-08,5.0,"I'm an Argentine-American and I go here when Argentines come to town and miss the old country...unless of course I'm making an asado at home lol. I've traveled this country sampling many of the Argentine restaurants in various cities and the encased meats from tango sur are up there with the best.  The morcilla may even be the best in my opinion. The Chorizo (sausage) and Morcilla (blood sausage) recipes are brought from the old country via the owner's father (R.I,P.) who is a butcher that migrated here from Rosario, ARG in the 60s.  The meats you get in the restaurant are all the same meats from the butcher shop next door and they are DELICIOUS. I have purchased many a meat from their meat case and they are always spot on. Yes, that little 'mercado' to the left of Tango Sur is a full-fledged Argentine butcher shop (pro-tip: cash only). That's how the whole thing got started...as a butcher shop. Not bad lol. The Parrillada para dos (mixed grill plate) is an excellent and classic way to sample all the different parts of an Argentine bbq.  Sure there are many more things you could add to it but the staples are there.  I saw a post about the sweetbreads being chewy...I have never had that problem.  Mojellas (Sweetbreads) are hard to grill because they require a longer cook time.  In order to make them crispy many cultures fry them, in Argentina however grill is king.  Everytime I've had them at Tango Sur they are super crispy and delicious. Same goes for the chinchulines (small intestine) which I saw someone write about. SIDE NOTE: You have to ask for them, they are not on the menu.  Chinchulines are by nature a little more rubbery than a lot of offal but I have to say prepared excellently at Tango Sur, crispy, greasy, delicious. As for the ambience, I see people complaining on Yelp about the lighting and general chaos lol. What they don't realize is that for better-or-for-worse you really couldn't get a more Argentine environment then what you get when you go to Tango Sur.  The candle lit vibe is something that got popular in trendy argentine bars, the over-abundance of people is part of that charm, think big cities like Buenos Aires and NYC. It should also be mentioned that the often longer wait times for your meats is also an Argentine STANDARD lol. Hence the famous term 'latin time.' I get it, this is America and we are used to what we know, but if you want authentic...this restaurant spares none.  Not to mention that most of the people that work on the floor and are from Argentina. In conclusion, this is one Argentine-American's perspective  (who grill's authentic Argentine asado/bbq literally weekly), and maybe some will disagree but I have brought quite a few 'argies' through here and they all seem to agree with me that when it comes to meats and vibe, few places are more true to argentine form then Tango Sur.  It's not a fluke that there are 2 hour waits almost daily.  The place is delectable, insanely affordable for meat...and BYOB.

2016-07-01,2.0,". I came because everyone raves about this place . My first time yesterday was not so good of a experience. We aimlessly walked in both sides looking for the maitre d to see about a table , to no avail didn't see anyone but waiters running like headless chickens. We then stood outside hoping someone will come out. Pretty soon the hostess was outside and sat us. That's when the experience went down HILL. We sat for 15 minutes BEFORE we got water and a bread bowl. 20 minutes LATER no waiter, no menu. We sat 35 minutes never meeting our waiter, no menu to order from. The bus boy gave us a menu finally. I had enough and went to the assistant manager i believe . I kindly told him we have been sitting for 30 minutes and have yet to see a waiter. It was so bad the table next to us noticed that the vacancy of service to us and offered some of their food that they have not eaten . It was a birthday party so that was sweet, of course we declined. But very sweet of them. The manager apologized and when I came back from the bathroom there was a man finally at our table. We ordered 2 filet mignons and a salad. Maybe 15 minutes later our mozzarella salad came. The kicker. Dry. No olive oil. No red, sherry vinaigrette. I only know because after we finished our salad he gave us 2 free ones ""on the house"" ! And he gave us olive oil and and another dressing. I'm thinking, if we ordered a salad shouldn't that have been on the house ???why in the hell do we want to eat two salads? And the one that we paid for??? you forgot to give us the dressing ???so we ate dry lettuce with mozzarella cheese. I was done. By that time when the food came I could not have been appreciative , we were sat at 7:13 pm....I looked at my clock it was 8:25pm. Still no entree meal! LOL just dry salad and water. That is unacceptable , I don't care how busy the establishment is. The service was Unacceptable. I would never , ever come back here again. Or recommend it. We barely saw our our waiter however when the check came he stayed at our table and waited for the checkbook . I gave him this crazy look and he looked and saw that both of our water glasses were empty , yes we didn't even get our water filled during our meal. so he went to go fill up  our water  glasses at the end of the meal When my food is already wrapped in a doggy bag by the busboy??

An orange/salmon shirt guy seemed to be a step above the servers and yet did nothing to make any of my requests come true. I had to ask 4 different servers including orange shirt, about our birthday celebrant, because our server never came back to us.  The one time he did check in on us, after taking our orders, was to abruptly ask how our food was, told him the lomos was very tough, otherwise everything is fine. His response? Well that's because it's a big piece of meat... Huh, pretty sure he should take this kind critique to the chef; being a big piece of meat doesn't permit it to be super tough.  Food: - Empanadas were faulty, but if you really want to try, I'd recommend the beef.  - Lomo (for 2) again was very tough, like they hurried just enough to scotch the outside. The sauce was good, but none of the flavors seeped in the meat.  - spinach(?) mash? Good, tastes the same as mashed potatoes. - el filet was very tender and just the perfect salting (unlike lomo) and really the only thing that carries most of the 2 stars given.  - chicken was alright, not bad not mind blowing. -  We came Thursday evening so it was super packed, but I was annoyed to see other tables being attended to more often than ours, and just unacceptable.",0.9845,0.785,0.165,0.051,0.588888888888889

Being a foodie (aka one that likes to shove things down my mouth), my supervisor recommended I try Tango Sur. She insisted that it was her favorite steakhouse in Chicago, so I was thrilled to finally try this with my friend from out of town. First things first, be sure to make a dinner reservation. On a weeknight, reservations seem to end at 18:00, but we were able to get a table for two outside in the patio for 18:30 with no problems. The interior was very ambient and looked like it was made for date nights. Sitting outside, you get the nice summer breeze and people watching opportunities. Now, for the food. Between the two of us, we ordered three empanadas (Corn, Spinach & Cheese, and Sweet Beef), and the Para Dos- a large grilled meat stand of short ribs, filet, chorizo, blood sausage, and more. The empanadas were BOMB. Each was baked to perfection, and the fillings inside had so much flavor. We loved trying each of the different options and appreciated the effort they put in to making it delicious. Next, the Para Dos meat fest ($40) was amazing. The spare ribs and filet was juicy and tender, while the chorizo gave it a nice fried kick to our meal. Our food did get cold pretty quickly given the low heat of the grill, but if you consume it when it's fresh, it is amazing. Everything we ate, we dipped it with their amazing chimichurri sauce. Seriously, it was so addicting, and one of the best I've had in Chicago. I wish I had a bottle of that for home! Not to mention the BYOB service is great! Our water was incredibly friendly and helped us uncork our reds and poured the first glass. We ended up eating so much food, and for the price we pay, it was definitely worth it. Cheers to Tango Sur!

Deelish I ordered the churrasco, medium rare. It came out medium well. Chewy AF.  Spinach mash potatoes. Sounds good right? Buttery AF. No spinach flavor whatsoever. Also tastes identical to the regular mash potatoes. It makes me wonder if they just added some green #5 to inflate the price. As far as ambiance goes, I don't know what they were trying to go for. If it was romantic, it was way too loud. If it was for groups, it was waaay too dark. We had one long Roman Candle to light up our whole table. It was so dark, I forgot who I came with.

2016-04-19,5.0,"We came here on a weekday with reservations. We had a group of 8 and the restaurant was very accomodating. Maybe this isn't the best place to bring a table of 8 for an informal company outing, but we were all eager to try the food here & had fun nevertheless. I say this because this quite a romantic spot. I'd say 85% of the patrons were there on dates and then there was our table of unromantic singles who were there for the food and the food only. The ambiance is lovely as the place is only illuminated by candles. The only downside to the seating is that there is no privacy - it's an open layout and tables are very, very close to each other. We had to gag through a few overly adamant PDAs and listen to first dates describe their families and another woman who wouldn't stop talking about her ex while on a date (bad move, girl. You'll probably end up being an old crazy cat lady if you continue like this). Point of the matter is: you can hear nearly every conversation around you whether you like it or not.  A great remedy to the aforementioned is the fact that this place is BYOB. We didn't know ahead of time so while we waited for our appetizers we sent a few of the guys from our group to a nearby liquor store for wine and beer. No corkage fee!   The service was impeccable and I've never felt so doted on in my life. Our server was very attentive & pleasant. The bussers and runners were almost too attentive. They would hover over you to snatch up a plate as soon as you put the last bite in your mouth. I know I would be crucified if I were a man writing this, but I am a woman (""socially acceptable"" double standards) --- the staff here was almost entirely male and received quite a bit of attention from the females in our group. I dare say, we had eye candy all night. I'm almost sure they weren't used to the attention because  - again - most of the patrons here are on dates. I think it's safe to say that if you are here on a date, you shouldn't be eying the handsome wait staff. Tall, dark, & handsome - all of them with appealing accents & excellent customer service.  Food wise, everything we ordered was amazing. We opted to order three apps (provoleta, jamon crudo con melon, and jamon crudo con palmito ) and then six entrees (all meat) and split everything on shared plates. We all ate well & even had leftovers. All the meat entrees were melt in your mouth fantastic. The seasonings were different and much more potent that what you would get at an American steakhouse. Delicious.  None of us ordered any of the pasta entrees or desserts so I cannot rate them. The sirloin, short ribs, and strip steak were all cooked to perfection. Maybe not the best place to bring a vegan.  The only thing that put me off was their butter. They had delicious house made bread and served it with that butter that comes in square plastic containers with the foil top. The same kind of crappy butter you'd get at ihop or Denny's. Considering the ambiance and overall menu, it was a stark contrast. They could possibly serve their butter as a whipped dollop on a butter plate or even carved off a butter block. It's all in the details.  However, I don't think this warrants taking off an entire star. Definitely recommend for the impeccable service and delicious food.",0.9973,0.795,0.154,0.051,0.5763370998116759

It doesn't matter - you'll leave feeling full and warm from the wine you've no doubt brought three bottles of, and undeniably happy.

2016-02-16,4.0,"Okay I swear this place has been on my bookmarked list forever and I'm sooo happy that we finally ventured out over here for my friends birthday. We had a party of 12 so we definitely had to make reservations in advance. I've been to Argentina so I had high expectations of a good Argentinian steakhouse. Upon arrival, it's dark, intimate, exposed brick walls, great music playing, seriously a great atmosphere. However, the only reason I don't give them 5 stars is because it's fully jam packed in there, I wish they spaced the tables out more and took less people in since you kind of feel like a bunch of sardines in a tight can. That's the only downfall I can think of as everything else is pure positivity. The service is pretty good and it's byob so what can be better than relaxing with your friends, catching up over a few bottles of red to go with your steak. The food is phenomenal, the portions are huge and so worth it for the money. Let's start with the empanadas, they are fantastic. We tried, the beef ones as I our server said those are his favorite, we also had the chicken and the spinach and ham. All of them were fantastic but I have to say that the beef ones truly were the best, they had a kick and lots of good flavor. These empanadas did remind me of what I ate in South America. Now onto the meat, we shared the filet plate with the spinach mashed potatoes and so glad I did because it is a LOT of food. I mean there's no way I could have finished it by myself and for $30 for that plate, I truly thought it was an exceptional deal. And who knew that I could like spinach mashed potatoes. Divine I tell ya. Now, I was already full after my appetizers and perfectly cooked steak, but I knew I had to try their dessert. I ordered the dolce de leche flan and it was amazing, super finishing touch after an amazing meal, and I could bathe in dolce de leche I love it so much. I would absolutely recommend getting their flan because it's light and flavorful and doesn't make you feel like ""why did I get this after I was already so full."" Overall, such a great experience, drinking malbec with my friends and eating delicious food. It literally transported me back to a bistro in Buenos Aires and I can't wait to have an excuse to go back here. Oh, and some people complain that it's loud here, which it is, but if you get a table towards a wall, it isn't so bad and you can literally here your party.",0.9991,0.721,0.261,0.018,0.6215410052910051

Luckily,  we were seated not far from the window so we had some light. Remember that episode of Seinfeld where Jerry dates a woman who looks like 2 totally different people due to lighting?? Yes, this place would be it. There are no lights except for the candles on your table...so either bust out the flashlight on your phone to read the menu or read the menu at home prior to coming.  The menu is pretty basic...meat and potatoes just different cuts. I chose the filet, which could feed 2 people easily. People come here since is it BYOB and you get a boat load of meat. Quanity vs quality here.  I ordered the filets rare, but after a bite or 2 I realized this was blue rare not rare. The lighting is so dark that it was a lost cause trying to see the center of the filet. Was the steak amazing?

2016-01-16,5.0,"BUZZ - Empenadas (7/10) - Lomo Relleno (9.9/10) - Vacio (10/10) - El Filet I'm not entirely sure how I ended up giving this place only 3 stars way back when. I suppose I used to include ""atmosphere"" when I first started writing reviews. I remember really liking the food, but maybe I just wasn't attuned enough or something.  I will say, though, the thought of going back to Tango Sur is met with both excitement and dread. It's like saying, ""Hey! Let's get a burger at Au Cheval!"" The wait is stupid. We got there at 7pm on a Saturday, yes, I know, that's just asking for it, but I hear it almost doesn't matter when you go. There was a 1.5 hour wait for 4 of us. We actually had a 5th, but they said to seat her, it'd be 2.5 hours, and she didn't have that kind of time. So we ended up waiting at the sushi place next door for drinks and a roll each as an appetizer. Although the wait sucks, what's nice is that you can give your cell phone number, and they'll text you when your table's ready.  The other amazing thing about this is that it's BYOB. It's an upscale restaurant, but if you cut out the cost of ordering a decent bottle of wine at the restaurant, that's saving $100! EMPENADAS Because there was a buzz about this, we got 'em too. They were decent, but nothing I'd go out of my way nor wait in line for hours for. VACIO When it comes to steak, I'm a purist. Only salt and pepper for me (unless the steak sucks, in which case, loads of A1!). I don't enjoy Filet Oscars, blue cheese crumbles, bernaise sauce, or any of that stuff. I mean, I enjoy those things, but definitely not on my steak. Technically, Vacio is not really a steak. It's more of a slab of beef, but I have never enjoyed beef smothered in anything nearly as much as this. I don't even have to dress up the description, because listen to this: half slab of range grown flap meat, sliced and filled with olive oil, garlic, parsley sauce, then cooked and served on a grill with roasted sweet potatoes. ideal for two That, and it's basically drenched in it! OMG I seriously can't believe that something this good exists! It's a thick cut of beef, and it's seasoned oh so perfectly! There wasn't a single bland moment nor a moment where I thought anything was too salty. The garlic and parsley fused so well with the beef, and the balance was perfect. The garlic was so good and tasted so fresh! This isn't weak, yet buttery, roasted garlic. This is fresh 'n' strong garlic (cooked for texture though)! The parsley has its own flavor of course, but it even intensified the garlic and even olive oil flavors too! WOW!  Because it was so thick, the saucy stuff was only on the outside of the cut (well, more so if you drenched it further like me), but you still have a lot of beef on the inside, so while you get all those crazy intense flavors (and seasoning), you still also get a hint of pure beef flavor underneath, and the beef was so tender too! Never wrestling with cartilage or with a ""too tough"" bite. Also since it's drenched in the sauce, every bite was super moist too! And if you're still not salivating, just google Tango Sur Vacio and check out the pictures, because a picture is worth a thousand words, and I don't think Yelp gives me that much space. This, folks, is why you wait in line! LOMO RELLENO This was the more popular item between the two, according to our server. Since we had 4, we got both this and the Vacio. This was very similar; it also was a slab of meat, but it's cooked on a grill with portabela marsala. It's filled with chimichurri sauce, which is basically the same as the Vacio minus garlic.  This was amazing in its own right too. If we hadn't gotten the Vacio, I probably would have given this 10/10, but because I had to compare it, I was missing the garlic on this one. This one also had a little bit of a more bold and peppery flavor than the Vacio. Even though it's a different cut, all the praises I gave for seasoning, texture, moistness, etc. for the Vacio apply here too. If you like bold & peppery, Lomo. If you like garlic, Vacio. 1, 2, OR 20 TO TANGO You all need to free up your Saturday evening and put your name on the waiting list. This is worth it! Oh, did I mention BYOB...with no corkage fee? We ate a lot, but still ended up with leftovers, and splitting the check 3 ways, it was about $35/person + tip! We brought 3 bottles of wine. Imagine going to a steakhouse and ordering 3 bottles of wine, do you have any idea how much that'd cost? So on top of being some of the best food in the world, it's also some of the cheapest! So, hurry up, go here, bring a friend, or 20, or none, just go to Tango Sur!",0.9988,0.792,0.157,0.052,0.5472456492637215

I just left after waiting for 2 hours at another establishment close by, and our table was still not ready. I give up. Good luck everyone - go on a Tuesday night and maybe you will wait less than 2.5 hours for your table. Again, the food is quite delish but not worth a 3 hour wait... Update: Great food cannot combat poor service - we put our name in at 7pm. It is 10pm and no one ever called to tell us our table was ready, WE had to call them.

2015-12-06,5.0,"Pretty pumped I finally got to try Tango Sur! Scared by long wait times on the weekends, I was eagerly anticipating our visit as so many friends said I ""HAD to go"" to Tango Sur. We arrived on a Monday night with a group of four and had no issue getting a table. However, the restaurant was by no means empty! The atmosphere is pretty awesome at Tango Sur, definitely dark and romantic. The candlelight makes it a little difficult to see the menu, but the ambiance totally fits the restaurant. The BYOB element is key and very unique for a restaurant featuring steak! We brought a couple bottles of wine to accompany our meal. I don't care how hungry you and your dining companions are, keep in mind that Tango Sur serves up serious portions. We started with the empanadas, which I think are a must order. My favorite was the spinach and cheese, but all were enjoyed by the whole table. We also started with the pravaleta, very delicious and melty provolone. The spices on this were super tasty, but it was definitely a filling appetizer for four! I wasn't even hungry when our entrees came...which were gigantic! The boyfriend and I shared el filet and the beef vesuvio. Both were fantastic, el filet comes with two full pieces of filet and enough spinach mashed potatoes to feed an army. The beef vesuvio was tender and moist, we loved the potatoes on the side and how flavorful the dish was. We ended up taking home enough food for at least two additional meals.  Overall, highly recommend Tango Sur! Very unique atmosphere and concept. With multiple appetizers and two entrees, total came to about $70 for two people. While slightly pricey for a BYOB, the quality of the food is fantastic and you're not getting a steak dinner anywhere else for that price.

When you agree to go to Tango Sur, you have to understand it is a bustling, generally loud, sometimes over packed, chaotic mess, and to add to the fire, its BYOB, which causes some rude people to sit there far longer than they should. You have to accept that this is what you signed up for, and If these things upset you, you should go elsewhere.  For the rest of us, this place is awesome. What you get is reasonably priced large portions of excellent steaks and (if you're smart) some empanadas and the provoletta appetizer (it's seriously just a big plate of melted provolone with bread!!!!). You may have to wait for your table, that's why you bring an extra bottle of wine, or give them your phone number and walk down to Toons for some beer.

We ordered Vacio, that came with a recommendation from our waiter.  It was well flavored and smelled amazing but just so tough!!

2015-11-14,2.0,"Friday night at 8:30pm. My first experience at Tango Sur started with a phone call, asking them what the wait was for two. They answered 45 mins to an hour. With that knowledge my friend and I decided we could wait under an hour for what's supposed to be really good steak.  After driving 15 mins to get there, paid for street parking, we walk in and the wait has now jumped to 1.5 hours. Fine, we're already there and have paid for parking, so we put our name in then walked over to nearby Music Box's lounge to wait it out. 1.5 hrs come and go and still no call from them so we walked back over (in the freezing cold) to check on the status. Guy at the door looks at his little notepad - I think they must've skipped past me or lost the tiny piece of notepad paper that my name was on because he couldn't find my name. He told me that we'd have to wait another 20 mins but that we could go into the small back room and join the other people waiting. Having already invested 1.5 hours waiting what's 20 more mins? At least now we can drink the wine we brought in the back room. (Mind you, my h-anger is starting to surface at this point)  So we waited, finished our entire bottle of wine later (1 hr in small waiting room now) and still my name wasn't called. I go check with the dude and he apologized and said there were 2 more tables ahead of us. By this time, all the other restaurants were closed, I had started to yelp for diners nearby because the wait had gone past 2.5 hours. Right when we were finally going to give up he calls my name, at this point I was already fuming, if not for my friend who insisted on waiting I would've already left. It was ridiculous. I honestly think that they somehow lost my name and had to put me back to the start of the wait line. If I had known the total wait was more than 2.5 hours I would've been able to make a better decision but they strung me along from 45 mins to 1.5 hours to 2 hours and 2.5 hrs. Had I known at an earlier point in the night I would not have gone there or at least looked for a better way to kill time, it was the stringing along that pissed me off. I'll just touch briefly on the food. They gave us a complimentary plate of $10 melted cheese which was yummy but not enough to quench the h-anger. I ordered a ribeye and it looked amazing but when I cut into it, the  steak just did not have good texture. It felt like I got a cut that had tendons in it (weird for a ribeye) - hard to chew on and not tasting the greatest. The chimichurri was tasty but it wasn't enough to balance out the terrible cut of meat I had. We finished out w an order of flan, that was probably the best thing all night and the only reason I'm giving this place two stars instead of one.

2015-11-06,4.0,"I first came to Tango Sur when they were first hot on the scene 15 years or so ago, but I didn't really appreciate it or enjoy the vibe until my husband and I began dating. I've always loved it's romantic setting: low lights, candlelight, great beats (house or techno is not necessarily romantic, but it really just goes with the vibe of the place...sultry South American).  I thought it would be a perfect date spot. He fell in love with the place, and we've used this as our go-to special-night-out place for 8 years.  Let me start by saying we are NOT creatures of habit and absolutely love trying new restaurants and dishes, but this place has become sentimentally ""ours"". We always order the antipasto appetizer and the provoleta (both huge, and perfect with your favorite wine and the warm bread they keep bringing you - it's such a Latin American feel; sit, chill out with apps, good wine and good convesation). Sometimes we'll order a couple of different empanadas, and then we share the Lomo Relleno (my husband would kill for the chimichurri sauce that comes on the side - ask for it when you get your warm bread...incredible!). I'm more medium-well, and my husband is all about getting meat as close to rare as possible, so they always cook this piece of meat perfectly for us...I take the edges, he takes the middle.  And the mushroom sauce - good god, I could almost just eat that as an entree! Obviously, with all the food we order, we take almost all of the meat home (and they happily pack up extra chimichurri sauce)...'cuz mama needs her flan!! It is THE BEST flan, with a caramel topping....and my abuela used to make crazy good flan.  No matter how ridiculously busy they are, we have never felt rushed (nor are we ever in a rush, and we just soak in the laid back vibe). We've always had great, charming waiters, and the busboys are so thoughtful (as much bread as you want!) and engaged with their customers as well. Our dessert or coffee has been randomly comped at times, which is a nice gesture.  We have brought others here and their food is always top notch as well. The only reason I am taking away one star is because it is obvious they try to pack in as many tables as possible....the wait is going to always be a long one anyway, so if they would just take away a couple of the 2-tops, it would be a slightly more intimate space. Yet, even with all the noise and people around, my husband and I always feel like it's just the two of us. Love this place, and they can never close. Ever. Hints for the long wait (they don't take reservations unless you're a big group): if you live in the area, come down, put your name in and then go back home; they will call and let you know when your table is ready (we've seen this happen a few times)...if you're far, like we are, bring an extra bottle of wine and happily wait in the sitting area in back; they keep it stocked with wine glasses.",0.9992,0.734,0.233,0.033,0.5387894092439548
2015-11-05,1.0,"Disclaimer: I am giving Tango Sur 1 star on the basis of my most recent visit.  I have frequented this restaurant many many times and have had pleasant experiences for the most part. My most recent visit, however, was disastrous. I went with a friend for dinner one Sunday evening and we both ordered the filet mignon. The meat was severely undercooked and we both sent it back after eating about 6 bites. The next morning, I could not hold down any food or water and a day later, I boarded a 4-hour flight to California (you can imagine that this was super uncomfortable!) I was really ill for about 3 days and was told that I had food poisoning. After learning that the possible source of this poisoning was Tango Sur, I decided to give them a call.  I called Tango Sur because, as I mentioned, I've been a long time customer. I spoke with a gentlemen and calmly explained that I had gotten ill from their undercooked meat and I just wanted to call to let them make sure to tell their cooks to be extra careful (everyone makes mistakes!). To say the least, it was a very awkward conversation. The man on the other end of the line was silent until he finally let out an ""ookkkaayyyyy."" No apology. No acknowledgement. At the very least, I would have expected a ""Lo siento mucho!"" type of response. I was just trying to call attention to a serious issue, it's not like I was yelling and threatening. Perhaps it had to do with the fact that I sound quite young on the phone, but I was really shocked that the gentleman I spoke with had absolutely zero compassion and didn't take my call seriously.  If this is how Tango Sur treats their customers, I have no desire to go back. It's a shame because, as a Latina, I love to support Latina/o-owned businesses.

I was not impressed with the food, overall.  The empanadas were yummy and you could put the chimichurri sauce on an old shoe and I'd eat it - so good. The antipasto, however, was average. The salads that came with our meals were disappointing: 2 slices of tomato and raw onion on some lettuce.  Looked more like burger fixings than a salad.  The steak I received had a lot of gristle and was tough to eat, but luckily was covered in the chimichurri sauce so it tasted great, just more like garlic than steak. The food would have been slightly more bearable if either of these things were not also true:  1) It was so dark in there I could hardly see my food.  If I'm going to eat a steak with fat and gristle, at least turn up the lights so I can see enough to be able cut around it. 2) The air conditioning turned on in the middle of our meal and was blowing up on me from a grate in the floor.  Between the door opening every few minutes when people came/left letting cold air in (it is October afterall) and the constant stream of air from under my chair, I was a popsicle by the time dinner was done.

The parrallada is served on a grill that keeps the meat warm and looks cool on your table, and includes a fresh salad beforehand which is nice to prepare you for all of the meat you are about to eat.   For dessert we ordered the Thousand Layer cake, which was also very good.  Almost like a tiramisu, except instead of espresso it was more marshmellow-y.  But in a good way.   Sit outside if it is a nice day, and try to go a little earlier or make a reservation to avoid a long wait.",0.987,0.802,0.167,0.031,0.537051282051282

I spat half the meat out because I couldn't chew it down. We had asked for medium rare and what we got was practically well done. At that point we called it quits and gave up on the salad and empanadas. The server offered us a free dessert but at that point we were  just done with the whole experience.

I don't think I can go back to a plain mash potato anymore, but no other restaurants make that, so I'm going to have to deal. The steak was beautifully cooked and seasoned.

The service was bad and the food was not up to par. Only two positives were that we were seated right away outside, even though we arrived 15 minutes early for our reservation and BYOB.  The service was awful. The waiter would disappear for long periods of time. We asked for a few minutes to talk and figure out what to order and he didn't come back for about 20 minutes. We ordered one of each kind of empanadas, except the ham and cheese, only to get all ham and cheese. When the waiter finally reappeared, he looked at us like we were the ones who ordered it wrong. Once our correct order came, they were good. One friend ordered the proveleta appetizer, which she enjoyed. Guess the appetizers are the only edible things here.  Our table decided to split the filet and the chicken Milanese. We ordered the filet medium and came out basically raw. It had maybe been cooked for 2 minutes a side. The chicken was okay; nothing special and a little bland. We asked for the filet to be cooked again and still came back very rare and tasted charred. For the $30-40 for steak, I was very disappointed. I would have asked for it to be sent back again and taken off the bill, but as it was we were running late for an event.

We were able to sit outdoors (a big plus, since the candlelit interior would be too dark for me), and that was pleasant. The server was very helpful in describing differences between the various dishes, and all the staffers were courteous. Prices are reasonable, and the BYOB policy keeps the check in check if you wish to imbibe. We were there for beef -- I mean, it's an Argentine place, right? We settled on Lomo Relleno, billed as a grilled filet filled with chimichurri and ham sauce, served with portabella marsala. The dish included two small salads, which were fresh & welcome. The meat had good, rich flavor, if a bit salty, and was quite a sizable portion for two. The filet was not notably tender, and there was a fair amount of chewy (but not swallowable) connective tissue. There was a dessert tray, but nothing appealed to us (as if we could have tackled dessert after that beef blowout). I'm glad I finally tried Tango Sur, but it just isn't my thing -- I'm not into this kind of major meat.

I'm not sure if it's because I had such great expectations of this place when I visited, but I was pretty disappointed with my experience. We went for dinner: When you first walk in, it's so dark in there you aren't even sure who you're talking to or where you're going. There is no lighting inside (all off) and the only lighting is a candle stick on each table. Sounds quite romantic but when you aren't sure if the steak is going in your mouth or your nose, I'd say it's quite a dealbreaker -- I also wouldn't recommend bringing a first-date here unless you're ugly and don't want them to see your face. I couldn't see my food.  My wife and I came with another couple and we were recommended by the waiter their 2 specials on their new menu (sorry... cannot remember the name of the dish). The food was OK.. nothing too crazy to write home about. The portion sizes are quite large though so we ended up all sharing the 2 entrees and even packed some to-go. Sadly, the best and most memorable part was the bread that came before the main dish came out. Pricing wasn't so bad though. Not sure if it's because I am originally from the land of BBQ (Texas) or because I had expectations comparable to other steakhouses being from NYC (e.g. Peter Lugers, Mortons).

2015-06-22,2.0,"Raised in Buenos Aires and lived there over 35 years so I plan my review to get somehow higlighted and the managers will take my feedback to improve the place as it has very high potential. I visited Tango Sur with my best friends recently moved to Chicago from New York willing to show them a little about how the food is like in Argentina, however I was very disappointed. The first thing to note when you visit this place is that they have pictures hanging in the walls, Probably somebody told them they were all related to Argentina but they are not. You will find Lola Flores and Tito Puente next to Gardel :) You may also notice that all the servers (at least the one I was able to interact with) were Mexicans, not Argentinians. Also as soon as you try to place the order you will realize thi is a BYOB place (if you are not a local you may not be used to stakehouses where they don't sell wine). It would be nice if the server was kind enough to show us that there was a wine store just a block away, but he didn't. Well, let me start with the food... 1) We ordered emapanadas as a starter. My friends thought they were amazing, for me they were just OK. They were large, fried, gound meat stuffing, mild taste. There are probably as many different kind of meat emapnadas as provinces in Argentina, These ones did not seem like any ones I had there before and definitey Empanadas + Chimichurri is not a combination you wil find anywhere in Argentina.  5/10 2) We ordered Parrillada for 2 + Chinchulines  + Bife de Chorizo  1st huge mistake is that they brougt the salad first, as if it was a starter. Everywhere in Argentina you eat the meat WITH the salad as a side dish.  The parrillada included Vacio (flank steak), asado (short ribs), mollejas (sweetbread), chorizo (argentinian sausage), morcilla (blood pudding / black sausage) The meat quality was good, but it seemed as it was cooked to order, which opposed to what you may think it is actually NOT a good thing when you talk about a meal that is supposed to be slow cooked (at least 1hr for a medium rare flank steak) . My friend liked it bc i was pretty similar to what they are used to eat in other stakehouses, but nothing to do with Argentinian style. 3/10 The chorizo was nothing like I ever had before in Argentina, it was just ground meat in a sausage shape. Not tasty at all, Real argentian chorizo is small pieces of (usually pork, or pork/beef) fatty meat  and spices. This was more like lean ground beef.  3/10 The morcilla was super tasteless. Real morcilla has blood, fat, and scallion, and sometimes also small bites of meat. This was uniform and bland 2/10 Sweatbreads were really good. the same or better to what you may find in Argentina 10/10 Chinchilines were ok. Not small pieces as we use to grill them , and the order was huge (I asked them to make half an order not to be cheap but so we were not wasting food) 5/10 Price was really cheap compared to most steakhouses. This place can be easily tuned into a GREAT place, but just now it is neither authentic Argentinian nor great.",0.9982,0.811,0.164,0.025,0.5642760787599497

2015-06-19,5.0,"Tango Sur is hands down one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago.   I am biased, because ever since spending a summer in Buenos Aires I will do anything to experience nostalgia for that city.  Tango Sur is extremely hard to get into, especially on weekends, because it is a popular spot that doesn't take reservations.  I was annoyed by this my first visit, not eating until 11pm, but I learned to embrace this, remembering that when I was living in Argentina I rarely ate dinner before 9 or 10pm.  With all the bars on Southport, it's easy to go sit somewhere and have a drink while you wait.  The restaurant is BYOB and I always get a bottle of Malbec to go with the amazing empanadas, which are a must.  They are satisfying and filling enough to even make that the whole meal.  I've also had the chicken milanesa which was perfect and had enough for leftovers.  My favorite dish is the estofado which is a very rich braised beef meat sauce, which I get with fideos (wide noodles like tagliatelle). It is the most amazing comfort food, perfect for a winter evening in freezing Chicago.  I have always experienced friendly and attentive service at Tango Sur and the ambiance is perfect.  Every time I have been there I've had waiters check in frequently to ask how everything is.

2015-06-07,5.0,"I am so obsessed with this place! The steaks are honestly better than some of the top steakhouses in Chicago (David Burke, I'm looking at you). The steaks are incredibly tender and juicy and flavorful! I've never regretted coming here, even though there's generally a long wait. I think my favorite steak on the menu is El Filet. It's always perfectly cooked and the chimichurri sauce is to die for. Each steak also comes with a small salad and a side (El Filet comes with spinach mashed potatoes -- yum!), which is more than you can say for pretty much every other steakhouse in Chicago, as those are pretty much a la carte. The prices are also incredibly reasonable (~$40) for what you're getting. Oh! And don't forget their desserts! I'm drooling right now just thinking about the flan. This place is also BYOB, which is cool. There's no corkage fee, so bring as much to drink as you would like! If you forgot the wine at home, there's also a grocery store down the block. The service is always good even though they're constantly busy, which is another addition to why I love Tango Sur. There are just small things that the waiters do that really make this an enjoyable place to eat. The ambiance is pretty dark and it can get kind of loud as it's a very crowded place, but I'd highly suggest this for a date night or a special occasion.

It's a shame because the filet mignon was otherwise really good, and so was my wife's eggplant dish with spinach, mozzarella, and creamy tomato sauce.  The empanadas were so-so overall:  the corn one was delicious, the beef one mediocre and the spinach one inedible.  The salads were amateurish, nothing to consider.  The best dishes were the entrees, which were spoiled by the delay. I would say pass, I think there are better options with equally good food or better but with much better & predictable service.",0.982,0.777,0.173,0.049,0.6340643274853802

Service is slow- took 45 minutes to get meal after it was ordered. U can tell that better service is given to the ""regulars "". I ordered the salmons with cream sauce and asparagus.

This was our first time here and looking at previous reviews we were excited to give this place a try. We made reservations well in advance and showed up a few minutes early to find the restaurant packed. We were told it would be a 10-15 minute wait, which was fine, but we ended up waiting at least an hour before we were finally seated. Granted we might have had to wait a little longer for our table because it was busy, but for the time we waited we might as well have not made a reservation at all. What was most upsetting was that a couple that showed up after us without reservations got seated within 10 minutes of arrival. In addition, we had to ask three different times and spoke with a manager before we finally got to our table. Overall, this left a sour taste throughout the rest of the meal and we were not able to fully enjoy our experience here, which was highly disappointing. Moving on to the food - we ordered the Vacio as well as the Bife Vesuvio. The portions were well sized, and I liked the meat here better than Las Tablas. The chimichurri sauce was also bomb. Overall, the food was good. Tango Sur, I really want to like you, but the poor service we received does not make me want to return.

I ordered the pork chop which was decent but I felt that it could've been done better given the shiitake mushrooms and wine sauce. I guess the portion size is big for the price but for some reason the meal didn't seem worth the price tag.

2015-04-06,4.0,"A fantastic experience, but definitely try to get a reservation as trying to walk in during peak times will almost guarantee a significant wait outside (as they don't have an indoor waiting room - understandable given the fact that they can get more tables in)  We had a large party so they were able to give us essentially a pre-fixe cost that gave each of us an empanada, share of the cheese appetizer, an entree and flan. The cheese appetizer might just sound completely normal, but it is pretty phenomenal... the gooey, rich goodness may be bad for you, but it is quite divine. We were presented with a beef empanada which I think was just fair, but not terrible. As a ribeye fan, I ordered that and thought it was fairly decent with good marbling and grilled to order.  The ambiance of this restaurant is quite dark... almost unsettlingly so. While candlelight may be romantic... having trouble seeing your food can be a bit disturbing.  I will say the service, especially given that we were a huge table with a pre-fixed menu, was quite attentive with bottles my glass always kept full. Especially being a BYOB place without corkage fees, the servers were quick to produce wine keys, bottle openers and chillers... not something I always see at BYOB restaurants.

2015-04-06,5.0,"What a quality restaurant and an impeccable meal!  I came here with some friends to celebrate a birthday and enjoyed every moment of it.  They are also BYOB so we came with two bottles vino.  If you're a meat-lover, Tango Sur is for you.  There are options for vegetarians, but their Argentine grilled meat here is divine. On Sunday, the wait was about 45 minutes after you put your name on the list, but it is well worth it.  You have to come in-person to put down your name, but there are plenty of local spots to check out as your stroll around on Southport Ave. Plus they'll take down a number and call you when your table's ready. (Once it's warm, there is outdoor seating available). The setting inside is very intimate - a single white candlestick burning to illuminate our table of four.  It was dim, you might squint to read the menu, but your eyes will eventually adjust to the ambiance.  All of the staff and servers were kind and attentive. They for sure know how to handle a bustling dinner crowd with ease.   Once we set our Malbec on the table, our server immediately brought glasses and helped us open it so the wine could start flowing.  The restaurant is clearly a favorite destination for celebrations, we sat between two big parties also clinking glasses to a life milestone... one table complete with a custom cake and champagne. Where's what we ordered for four: APPETIZERS: Empanadas: 1) Chicken 2) Spinch & Cheese; served with garlic/parsley sauce Provoleta: provolone cheese with olive oil and roasted peppers ENTREES: ""El Filet"": filet mignon with spinach mashed potatoes ""Costoleta"": bone-in ribeye with mashed potatoes A cold seafood salad platter with mussels, squid, heart of palm, olives, tomatoes. We got freshly baked rolls to start us off and each of us also got a simple side salad of lettuce, tomatoes and onion.  (Olive oil and vinegar will be placed on the table to dress the greens to your liking). One thing to note, we were planning to order 2 entrees to share (the el filet and the seafood salad) but our server told us he'd have to charge $7.00/person for the other two people as a sharing charge.  We reconsidered and then ordered a third entree, opting for the Costeleta (bone-in ribeye).  So glad we did becuase it was phenomenal. A handful of appetizers and three entrees between four people was the perfect amount of food.  The empanadas were great (you can also satisfy your empanada fix at Cafe Tola further south on Southport) and those two meat dishes were cooked and flavored to perfection.  The red onion wine sauce for the El Filet (you get two pieces of filet mignon) was delicious, but the ribeye had the best seasonings and was more tender (we ordered both cooked medium). I'd highly recommend Tango Sur and would love to come back for another special occassion.  Everything is reasonably priced but even beyond cost, the quality of their food and fun ambiance made my meal here top notch.  Next time I'd try their Lomo Relleno, which is a half slab of fillet served on a grill ideal for two (but I have a hunch would easily feed four).  Portion sizes were generous. For the carnivores out there, you can't go wrong with their Argentine steak.",0.9991,0.802,0.198,0.0,0.5203090172239109

Let's talk about wait times.  The first time I visited, my boyfriend and I arrived around 7:30 PM.  We were told to return at 9:30 (it was packed).  We went a few doors down to a bar and returned at 9:30.  We were seated in the back room for about a half hour and were finally seated at 10.  Some may think we were a little crazy to wait so long, however, it's BYOB...obviously people are more than willing to hang out and finish the drinks they brought.  The second time I visited, we were a bit smarter.  We arrived at 4:30 thinking we would be seated closer to 6.  When we arrived, they said they could seat us immediately, or whenever we returned, we would be at the top of the list to be seated.  I HIGHLY recommend this method.  When we returned to the restaurant at 6:30, we were seated within 15 minutes.  This last time, I took my mom who has wanted to visit since the first time I visited.  We made a reservation (who knew that was an option!) for 8:30 on a Wednesday.  As I mentioned earlier, I'm sure its tough to predict how long customers will stick around but we were seated by 9.  Think of a reservation as more of a call ahead.  Then you will not be disappointed by the wait. Service is always great here.  My last visit, they had a little mix up and we did not have a server come to our table for 25 minutes after being seated.  They were very apologetic and provided complimentary appetizers and dessert. I have ordered El Filet all 3 times I have visited and have split the meal each time.  It is perfect for 2!  The spinach mashed potatoes that come with it are amazing.  I have also tried the eggplant, empanadas (omg corn one is so good) and the proveleta.  I loved all of these items.  I do not think there is anything on the menu that would be a bad choice.  In splitting an entree and an appetizer, our bill is usually under $40 (score!).

Neither of us had ever been there nor did we know anything about it. We walk in and are told there is going to be a ten minute wait. Ok. The host or whoever, comes back after 10-15 minutes and seats us. The tables were a tad close together and the lighting may have been a bit too dark but overall, the ambiance is romantic and I get what they're going for. We decide what we want, place our order with who we think is our waiter, and wait.....and wait....and wait. We are given refills of our water ONLY because I flagged down a busboy and other waiters as our waiter was nowhere to be found. We waited 45 minutes for a simple seafood salad and a grilled sirloin steak. Not once did our waiter check on us or give us an eta on the food. The waiters were generally just running around in a rush and what should have felt like a relaxing dinner felt more anxious than not. I feel that for a Tuesday night, they should have held it together a bit more. I would hate to see what the place looks like on a weekend.  When our food finally arrived, it was another waiter who brought it with not a word about the 45 minute wait, when a couple next to us had clearly received their food within 10 minutes of being seated. Granted, I will say that the food is delicious but not worth the wait. We finally finish eating and at this point, its an hour and a half, most of which we've been kept waiting. We try to flag someone, ANYONE, down to ask for the check and what was once a room full of anxious, running waiters, had suddenly none. Another random person brings us our check and frustrated, we get up and take it to the front to pay. The cashier does not ask us how our dinner was or why we are the ones bringing our own check. My friend had left a portion of her steak and was not even asked if she wanted it boxed up. Overall, I would give the restaurant a one star. The service was atrocious and the wait staff seemed inexperienced and slow. The waiters do NOT check on you, there is not a single person assigned to you and it's difficult to get even the simplest thing like a glass of water. Yes the food was good, but I think next time I go to the Music Box, I'll make my way over to Dairy Queen next door.

It always seems a bit pricey, but you can take the leftovers home and eat a second meal almost every time!

2015-03-09,5.0,"Best filet mignon I've had in the city. I can't say I've visited every upscale steak house around but Tango Sur hit a home run. Darkly lit, BYOB, and they take reservations. If you entertaining folks from out of town and introducing them to a BYOB joint this a safe bet. Empanadas and the cheese appetizer are both I'm familiar with. I'd say go easy on the bread and starters to save yourself for the main event. Either way you won't leave hungry with the portion sizes. The only gripe I had was the salad that comes with an entree seems like fixings for a burger. I was waiting for a nice beef patty to arrive next. But you didn't come for the salad anyway, am I right? Two portions for the filet. I'd guess around 4-6 ounces each. Please order medium rare otherwise it should be considered a foodie crime. I tried the bone-in rib eye as well but the filet outshines all competitors. Accompanied by spinach mash potatoes and that addicting chimichurri sauce put me in a zen like state. Our server knew the menu front to back guiding several people in our group to the right choice.   Lately I've found myself comparing dining experiences and they come up short.

This was much larger than that for $28, so great value.

Felt squished between those two and would have liked more space to enjoy the experience fully. We ordered the provoleta and empanadas to start. Delicious. My mom doesn't eat meat and the server joked about that with us. since this is a steakhouse. Over all the server was great and I forgave him for the inappropriate joke.

2015-02-14,4.0,"This restaurant is unpretentious. It has a rustic, intimate, casual and lively vibe. There was no music playing on Thursday evening, Feb. 12, 2015. We arrived at 6:15 pm and were quickly seated. I ordered the grilled filet mignon which was served with a white wine sauce (very dark brown, thin broth, but light). This sauce provided a prodigious explosion of sabor which was the perfect amalgamation. The meat was tender, but dense, and similar in texture to venison, but without its gaminess. The meat alone receives 4-stars, but the side dish was ""Meh"" and receives 2-stars. The filet had the perfect amount of marble-ization with a creamy bold sabor. I had a pretty dull steak knife, but my butter knife worked beautifully! . There were four of us. By the time 7 pm rolled around every table was occupied. Tango Sur (which means Tango South) has a BYOB policy. Sweet baby Jesus let's drink the evening away, and so we did!    The plating was nothing exciting and not a beautiful presentation. It was two large pieces of tender filet mignon served with a large portion of green-colored spinach mashed potatoes. I was feasting copiously and thought, ""This is going to require a wine with some depth!"" The spinach is pureed and added into the potatoes giving them a green color. They definitely lacked flavor. I used the wine sauce and the chimichurri sauce to give them some sabor, pero nada trabajo. In the end, I left them on my plate. I took the second filet mignon home.  Our server, Ermanual, was hospitable, attentive and professional. He made sure we had water refills, and stopped by several times to ask ""how is everything"" which we all appreciated. The only negative: The wine glasses are very small and narrow preventing the wine from breathing and making it difficult to swirl the wine. They need to invest in larger wine glasses. We brought a bottle of red wine from Argentina. The name is Diseño, which means ""Design."" This wine has thrived in Argentina since the 1800's and is now considered among the world's most distinguished red wines. No, this is not a $200 bottle of wine (between $10 to $12). It has dark berry fruit medley, melted English licorice, bittersweet dark chocolate and almost minty bursts of blackberry jam. The mid-palate features a ripe tannin as it hits the back of your throat with a nice balance and finishing with a juicy kick of cherries. This wine pairs perfectly with any red meat! For appetizers, we ordered several kinds of empanadas (beef, ham and cheese and chicken). I had the chicken, which was very salty but I still ate it because I was fairly hungry. I rate the chicken Empanada with 3-stars. Crispy and flaky, yet light, is how I describe the empanadas' exterior. Complimentary bread rolls were served warm with a fluffy interior and a crispy, crunchy exterior. We were also served boring salads which consisted of lettuce, tomatoes and raw onions. Vinegar and oil was placed on the table. My husband had the rib eye (massively huge) which was served with wedged Vesuvio potatoes. He said the potatoes were dry and not very flavorful. This dish is fantastic for huge appetites!  His final rating, 4-stars.  My friends tried the rib tips with Vesuvio potatoes (huge meat portions). They  didn't care for the potatoes. She said it was a ""big miss"" and she was hoping it would come with something else. When I asked her ""what""  she answered plantains or Spanish yellow rice. Their final ratings, 4-stars. They really enjoyed  the rib tips and took the other half home. Our total was $126 and change (excluding tip). We ordered one dessert and shared it between 3-people. I didn't have any, because I don't ""do"" sweets. However, they said they really enjoyed the dessert (a cake with several layers drizzled with caramel).  SOME TIPS/Recommendations to keep in mind........ 1) Wine recommendations (Red) -- Diseño Malbec (from Argentina) -- OR Bardolino -- a light wine from the Veneto region of Italy and blended from several grapes. It is garnet in color, dry and slightly bitter, sometimes lightly sparkling OR Barolo -- Italian made from Nebbiolo grapes. It is dark, smooth and full-bodied. 2) This is a ""Pay to Park"" neighborhood, and parking can be challenging. 3) Great spot for a ""date"" night with your spouse or significant other (geared toward adults -- not children). 5) RESERVATIONS are only accepted for parties of six or more.  6) All Major Credit cards are accepted (including American Express Gift Cards) 7) Bring a pocket-size flashlight to read the menu (very dark place)",0.9976,0.805,0.14,0.055,0.5359416151351635
2015-02-14,5.0,"This is by far my favorite restaurant in Chicago. I have gone here with my fiancé, with family and with friends. It is absolutely delicious and a BYOB! The BYOB makes it even more worth paying the price for the food. They do not charge a corking fee and will keep your wine chilled, refilling your glasses as needed. I have seen people bring beer and hard liquor as well.  Obviously the steak is highly recommended, however I am a pescatarian and order either the salmon dish or the eggplant. They are both delicious! I also recommend the empanadas. The chimichurri sauce is very good!  The environment is very intimate. It sometimes feels dark and is a little tight which can make it hard to hear your company. They have a little drinking room while you wait for your table.

2015-01-11,2.0,"Can I be honest? This place was pretty disappointing. My friend and I came in for dinner around 5:30 on a Sunday night and it was very busy - we were seated immediately but by the time we left, pretty much every table was full. Things started off well: the waiter filled our water glasses, brought menus, and gave us a bread basket, for which we requested butter. The bread was actually my favorite part of the meal - great, since it means the bread was good, but bad, because the rest of the meal was not that good. The bread was freshly baked (or at least tasted convincingly hot and crusty) and wonderful. For the entrees, I ordered the churrasco - a 12 oz sirloin steak, served with potatoes and salad. The salad was pretty boring - lettuce leaves, raw tomato and onion slices, oil and vinegar for dressing - but unlikely to offend. The actual steak was enormous. I was only able to finish half of it, plus a few potato slices. This may have been owing to the portion size, but more likely it was the fact that the meat was pretty tough and laden with fat/tendons/other unappetizing components. I asked for it medium rare. Conveniently, it is too dark in the restaurant to see the color of the steak, so visually it's difficult to tell whether or not they achieved the correct temperature, but the mouthfeel of the steak was definitely not medium rare. It was so tough I had to saw and tug at it with the knife and fork, and even then I was only having minimal success. Actual flavor was meh, I've had better in the dining room of my own house. Add all this to the slow service (there was some sort of dinner party happening next to us, which I presume contributed to the long wait times before food came out, before we were offered a dessert menu, before the check given to us and collected, you name it) and you end up with an experience that just wasn't worth the $55 price tag on dinner for two people. I left feeling like my twenty-something dollar share of the bill could've bought me three Chipotle bowls that would've been far tastier and fed me for three meals. I don't know, man.

2015-01-07,5.0,"Plain and simply, this is one of the best restaurants I have ever eaten at, if not the absolute best.  Until a couple of months ago I had never heard of this little hidden gem in the Lakeview neighborhood of Chicago!  I had asked one of my co-workers about a unique place to eat for my birthday and he had suggested Tango Sur since he had gone there for his birthday the previous year.  With that said, it is a fantastic place to celebrate a birthday or any other special event!   My boyfriend and I went to Tango Sur on a Saturday night around 6 pm and it was absolutely packed in there; granted, it is a fairly small restaurant but every table was filled.  We had made reservations and so we only had to wait for a short period of time, but I had no problem waiting to be seated because apart from everything else, it smelled amazing!  It was dark in the restaurant, lit primarily by candles on each of the tables but this made for a great atmosphere.  If you're having a date night then believe me, this setting is perfect!  It will make for a date night you will always remember (just don't drink too much wine).  Speaking of wine, this restaurant is a BYOB so you may bring a bottle of wine of your choosing and not even have to worry about a corking fee!!!  Can you say awesome?   Anyways, let's get to the good part - the food!  For appetizers we got the queso and the empanadas - one of each the chicken, beef and spinach & cheese.  The queso was this to-die-for melted cheese that you tore apart to eat on this bread...it literally just melts in your mouth!  And those empanadas...just stop.  They come with this chimichurri sauce and oh my goodness - you don't want to stop eating them because it is so delicious.  Then my boyfriend and I both ordered the dish that had twin filet minons and spinach mashed potatoes (that were green - I thought it was awesome that mashed potatoes were green).  I had never had any steak that was so tender and had so much flavor!  Sure, there are many great steak joints in the Chicago land area but this one, in my possibly biased opinion, is the best.  The steaks are so juicy and these also melt in your mouth, almost literally.  Although this is a nicer restaurant that correlates with a little higher prices, you get so much food for your money and I guarantee you will be satisfied with your meal.   But wait - I also have to tell you about our dessert; we got the flan and it had salted caramel glaze dripping all over it!  It was so rich and so good that although I was practically stuffed to the brim from my appetizers and entree I couldn't help but eat all the flan.   Last but not least the service was very good and our waiter was extremely attentive and efficient.  I could not have asked for a better dining experience because all around it was top-notch.  Without a doubt, I would go back there and most likely order the same thing because it was a-mazing!",0.998,0.786,0.171,0.043,0.5946398046398047
2015-01-07,5.0,"This place was amazing.   We came here right when they opened because with the rating/amount of reviews we figured a long wait.  Thankfully it wasn't crowded at all right at the opening (which was a little strange but oh well can't complain).   A few of us ordered the Filet Mignon and it was definitely worth the 28$ price tag.  While you wait you can munch on salad and bread.  But it was the steak that really stood out.  There were TWO large pieces on the plate along with some strange green mashed potatoes (Tasted no different from regular mashed potatoes in my opinion).  The meat was tender, juicy and almost melted in my mouth.  It was a little strange that it was byob but we got over it and grabbed some wine nearby to accompany the steak.  Service wasn't perfect but for myself personally service isn't a big factor unless they're spitting in the food.  The food was what I came for and it was amazing.  Would come here again if I'm ever in Chicago.",0.7635,0.846,0.092,0.062,0.3963461538461538
2015-01-05,4.0,"If you love steak as much as I do, then you will truly enjoy Tango Sur.  You won't find your typical American steaks here, but some wonderful Argentine flavors.  This place gets pretty busy, so make sure you call ahead to reserve a table.  As you walk in, you will notice this place is pretty dark and your only light source are the candles on the tables.  This makes a perfect atmosphere for an intimate night out with a loved one or even with a group of your friends.   Definitely start off with their empanadas which are accompanied with their housemade chimichurri sauce.  They offer beef, chicken, ham and cheese, and spinach and cheese.  You can't go wrong with any of the empanadas because they are all divine, but the beef and the ham and cheese are my favorite.  Oh, their chimichurri sauce is also amazing; probably the best I have ever tasted. My favorite entrees are the el filet (two decent sized filet mignon served with spinach mashed potatoes) and the lomo relleno (half slab of Argentine fillet served with portabella marsala topped with chimichurri and ham sauce.)  The el filet is always cooked perfectly at a medium rare and the spinach mashed potatoes is light and buttery.  The lomo relleno is more than enough for two people.  Surprisingly with this huge slab of filet, it's cooked evenly throughout while still being tender and juicy.  The sauce they drown the meat in is also delicious. (Note: if you don't enjoy mushrooms like I do, it can be overwhelming for some people.  But to me I really enjoy the mushrooms).  The only complaint I have is sometimes the meat isn't sliced really well so you have to spend the extra time cutting it apart instead of digging right in.   I haven't even mentioned the best part yet, Tango Sur is BYOB with no corkage fee.  You guys can definitely get your drink on without hurting the wallet.  Overall, they offer great food at decent prices, a romantic atmosphere, and good service.  If you haven't tried this place yet then what are you waiting for?",0.9988,0.691,0.269,0.04,0.6351959831551669

I had the Suprema a la Napolitana, or chicken breast breaded and topped with ham/cheese/tomato sauce. Probably the best thing I've eaten in awhile. They even gave us complimentary flan for dessert for my birthday. The waiter was very kind and knowledgeable.

2014-12-15,3.0,"Tango Sur has incredible food, a romantic atmosphere, and very fair prices; however, the serve is comparable to that of a fast food restaurant: poor.  I have dined at Tango Sur last year and remember having a similar issue with the serve, but decided to give it another try. Upon entering the restaurant, you can't help but notice the lovely decor and ambience set with pillar candles at each table. This place bleeds romance! Upon entering, my party and the one ahead of us had to wait for the host to materialize...this was the start of the bad service. We waited a good 5 minutes before being approached by the host. They claimed the wait would be 30-45 minutes, but my party and I decided to behave through their claimed wait time and relax in the back waiting area. This restaurant is BYOB (corking fee though), and you can start drinking in the adorable waiting area, which is pretty freaking neat!  My party and I waited maybe waited 15 minutes to be sat down at our table. Now this is where our experience went extremely sour. We waited another 15 minutes to be approached by our waiter. Due to the delay, I notified the host of the dilemma. He gave us an excuse that no one should really use in the restaurant industry: we have quite a few party's tonight and were very busy. What he really meant is that the restaurants doesn't have the resource capacity to serve every table like they should. I was very disappointed.  After meeting our waiter, who seemed very rushed, we gave him our full order. We order a beef and ham/cheese empanada and the Vacio. Although the empanadas were highly recommended, I think there are better places in the city. The Vacio on the other hand was YUMMMMMMMMM. You can easily feed two people and have left overs, or even three people with no leftovers. Their entrees are simply delectable. If the restaurant were to add more staff to be more attentive, this place would make it to my 'list' of places I would take visitors from out of town.

So then I just got so aggravated I told him I didn't want anything anymore. And then when our bill came he tried to con our table of 11 people for a hundred more dollars then what was owed! He continued to argue with my friend over the hundred dollars she finally explained it enough times where he understood or I guess he figured he was caught and he ended up giving us some money back I called and left a message for a manager but nobody has gotten back to me that was a week ago!

I had to spit out a chunk of grizzle, which is unheard of for a $30 filet. No crust, which you would expect from a ""paradilla"" steak. Look, there is a reason why they give you two filets.

2014-11-14,5.0,"I was in the mood for something special for my last night on my 2nd trip into Chicago. And I wanted a steak. So a little Yelping and a trip on the Red line from my office to Addison took me here, and it was probably the best decision I made.  Yes, Tango Sur is a little on the datey side but if you have no dining companion, don't let that deter you. Here's why: It's BYOB - bring your own libations. Most people brought wine, I walked in with a 4-pack of Bells IPA in a lululemon bag. It's a great conversation starter as well. The steaks are excellent - I ordered the Bife Ancho. Medium rare. It was cooked to perfection(I hate tossing that term around), so meaty, so umami-y. It was like a flavor explosion. I kid you not. It came with chimichurri sauce, potatoes and a salad I wished could be better.  The empanadas are excellent - I ordered a corn one to start off - the shell was rich and decadent, The corn filling was pretty delicious.  I waited for a little while, I talked to a few people about California while I waited and talked to a couple and their friend who was sitting besides me. And they hooked it up with a flan on the house, I'm assuming because I waited for a while or asked repeatedly for a dessert menu but heck, the flan was hella(I'm from NorCal) good. And I ended up having the steak for a pre-flight salad before I left Chicago. And the price ain't bad at all - $32 with the empanada and the rib eye - it's a bargain for a excellent steak - especially when the same thing over in downtown or the Magnificent Mile will set you back at least $50.

Honestly, I feel pretty let down.  The first time that I went to Tango Sur, I sat outside. I think that  during the warm months, this restaurant is better because it can accommodate more people. Anyway, after deciding that I wanted to go there for dinner, I called the restaurant and asked for a reservation. They said that there were no more reservations tonight. I asked how long was the wait. They said if you come right now, there is no wait.  I quickly jumped in a cab and arrived at the restaraunt. When I got there, I was told that I have to wait 1-1.5 hours for a seat. I decided to go have a drink at the bar next door. They told me that they would give me a call. After not receiving a call in the allotted time, I showed up at the restaurant where I complained until I was finally seated 20 min later.  Now when I actually got into the restaurant I thought the ambience inside was pretty nice and everyone who was already eating looked pretty happy. As soon as the waiter came, I told him my order. The hour and 45 minute wait gave me enough time to figure out what I wanted. Even though I ordered right away, I feel like my food took a really long time to come out.  This is where the major let down was. After receiving my steak, which I ordered medium-rare, I cut into the steak (el filet) and it was purple...raw...not cooked! I was so hungry, I couldn't wait any longer. I started eating the nasty raw, undercooked steak which lacked salt and seasoning. My girlfriend ordered the para uno which included spare ribs. I have had spare ribs before, in fact, I love them, but these spare ribs were super fatty and lacked any flavoring. By the end of the meal, I just felt super disappointed. I feel like this place has gotten too popular and as a result, the food and service has decreased in quality. I would never wait more than 20 min for this lack luster meal. I would never pay for the experience which I had ever again. Having had been there before, when it was less crowded, I know that they are capable of providing a better meal and service.

The pastry is super flaky but not heavy at all and the inside is filled with a delicious stuffing from which there are 4-5 choices to select from - my favorite is corn - just throwing it out there!  If you're a party of 2, definitely split the Para dos which legitly comes with a boatload of meats - short ribs, flap meat, sausages, etc. It will be extremely filling and well worth it. It's also a good way of trying a little bit of everything, especially if you're like me and will get sick of eating a single piece of steak.  Dropping a star because service was just so-so and the salad that comes before the meal is rather unimpressive.

They were good. I had the Arrachera. Big portion. The seasoned potatoes were good as well. BYOB is always a hit!! Chocolate cake with rasberry was yummy. It was packed & they considered it a slow night. Don't want to come here on a weekend. I always wanted to try it out here.

2014-10-26,1.0,"Unfortunately, my boyfriend and I were pretty disappointed about this place. We started off with one of our favorite appetizers, empanadas....we ordered 2 beef and 2 chicken. At first we thought they were pretty good until my boyfriend bit into his chicken one and almost broke his tooth..he found 3 very sharp bones in his. I thought this was pretty unusual since typically the meat in empanadas is minced.  After that, we had high hopes for our entree the flap steak seasoned with garlic, parsley and onion, which sounded delicious on the menu, however we were again very disappointed ....the meat was tough and not flavorful...

2014-10-20,5.0,"4:15 on s Sunday afternoon, after nursing yourself through a mild hangover, what's a fitness foodie to do?  Pick up her fellow crossfiter and head out to a place renowned for its protein dights. Tango Sur is so much more than it's rather dark and crowded rooms lead on. At just about any other time, you can expect a line out the door, and a waiting area packed sardine tight with patrons salivating over the aromatic entrees at the tables.  It's dark, and cozy. You'll get to know your neighbor, whether you care to or not, and if you're smart, you'll pack a luscious bottle (or two) of Red and make friends. We were promptly seated, a table for two, complete with a single tall candlestick. Paper menus stained with the beverages of past patrons list a complete page of Argentinian entrees, each with their own flare. They come with a side salad, which is nothing to rave about, but it was fresh.  Before I detail the dinner, I must mention the Empenadas. $2.50 each, we shared the beef and the spinach with cheese. They were worth every cent, the spinach being our clear favorite.  Dinner for us? One ribeye, one T-bone, two heaping sides of homemade mashed potatoes (real, rich, creamy, dreamy, want to swim in them, amazing mashed potatoes). The steaks were perfectly cooked, tender cuts, and seasoned. Ribeye had a garlic rub that brought out the hearty marble of the cut. The T-bone: drizzled in a red wine reduction sauce, with sautéed portobello mushrooms. Tender, delicious..and protein dense happiness. One minor caveat. The knives they give you could barely be classified as butter knives, much less the steak knives they're impersonating. Until they reinvest in new cutlery, perhaps BYOK should be in order? (Bring Your Own Knife) It is Chicago, after all. For dinner for two, including the appetizers and tax, was just under $67.00. By far, the best BYOB Lakeview has to offer!",0.9935,0.836,0.148,0.015,0.47007750314201924

2014-09-11,5.0,"Tango is one of the few (only?) styles of music that can tastefully turn the accordion into a romantic, symphonic and melodic delight. And the dancing that surrounds it: sexy, confident and precise. My first meal at Tango Sur reflected all of this. Let's start with the music: the food. Top quality bread and butter. The empanadas? I tried the ham and cheese: perfect crust, as flaky as a good pie. ¡Estupendo! All the better to spread with that chimichurri sauce that I can never get enough of. (If you're like me, and you eat enough of it, I think you can tick-off one of your five vegetables for the day.) I splurged a bit more for ""El Filet,"" the thick, range-grown fillet mignon with the red onion wine sauce. ¡Magnifica! I think it's one of the top 10 or 12 steaks that I've had in my life, the beef was buttery and cooked perfectly medium rare like I like it. Tango Sur had been on my list for a long time, but I had never tried to go, hearing such stories about the long waits. This night, however, I was with an uber-sized group of about 20 with a reservation, and the dance here was waiters working their ""nalgas"" off to give us great service. They served us from one end to the other, allowing those who had received their food to start without feeling impolite as their food got cold. I once spent a couple weeks in Buenos Aires, taking Spanish lessons in the morning and Tango lessons in the evening. Tango Sur took me back there, to the sidewalk restaurantes parillas (grills), the Sunday market in San Telmo (with a couple of professional tango dancers performing on the street), and one of the many wonderful milongos (tango dance nights), where the gentlemen still simply nod their heads to ask for a dance.

They take reservations and have a waiting room in the back where you can open your wine and enjoy while you wait (cause they're BYOB!).  When you sit down, they give you fresh mini loaves of french bread and butter - I need serious control to stop myself from filling up on this delicious bread before my entree comes. The steak is always perfectly cooked and incredibly reasonably priced - the El Filet has two pieces of filet mignon and it's around $28 bucks (that's my favorite, btw).  They do charge a $10 sharing fee...but if you just buy a small plate or appetizer and use it as your ""meal"" then you're not just paying up and getting nothing back. The mashed potatoes are creamy and perfect - I love the spinach one. They also have a meet and cheese plate that's great for an appetizer.  Get the empanadas! The beef  and ham and cheese are my go-to. OH AND their chimichurri is to die for, I put that magical stuff on everything. And finally...get the flan for dessert.  It's very RICH, but if you're going to eat flan then you should just indulge.  They put a giant dollop of caramel on top which is too sweet for me, so I just eat the flan by itself.  They also give you free flan if it's your birthday! Perfect for any occasion in my opinion, whether it's an intimate date or a group outing.  They have taken my reservations for 5-20 people and have always accommodated (I've gotten a reservation on the weekend...so it's worth calling and checking).  We sometimes end up waiting when we get there but they're just a really busy restaurant, so have patience and you will be rewarded.  It can get a little loud though, but that doesn't bother me.

2014-08-25,5.0,"How have I not written a review of this Chicago gem yet? This is one of the first places I fell in love with in Chicago. This Argentinean steakhouse has afforded me nothing but amazing dining experiences. The decor is not swanky or fancy, but the atmosphere is cozy, warm and great a variety of events (family dinners, group dining, dates, etc.). The lighting is dim but the darkness and flickering flames from the candles make it romantic and relaxed. It's really busy so there's a wait and a solid crowd on the inside. The servers and waiters are extremely attentive so there's a bit of traffic all over the restaurant. It's BYOB, so a drink or two will drown out the movement and ambiance noise a bit. My go to is the Filet. An amazing, generous meal that is packed with flavor. Everything on the menu is great and I suggest you try something new every time you dine there. Other than the amazing food, I have to give this establishment 5-stars because of one particular server. Danielo has made my last couple of trips to Tango Sur an awesome experience. I've been gone from Chicago for a year an some change now, and he still provided me with the courtesy and friendliness that you would expect after going to the same restaurant for years. He's the greatest. Phenomenal food, great value, intimate atmosphere and top class service. Who can ask for more?",0.9921,0.725,0.207,0.068,0.5764568764568765

2014-08-23,1.0,"》HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!《 Let me start off with the fact that it was a TWO HOUR wait since you can't make reservations for any party smaller than 6. We checked in at 7:45 p.m and called in at just under 10 p.m. The server we had was the only good part. He was very nice and patient, but very young and almost scared.  The environment of this place was unbelievable. The music was super loud, which made all the customers louder. I could not even hear anyone at my table, who were literally about 2 feet away.  We ordered our food. 30 minutes later.. we got our ""salad""-- iceberg lettuce with two pieces of tomatoes and onions. Another 30 minutes later.. we get our food. I got the Churrasco and it was literally a piece of steak with mashed potatoes thrown on a plate. My mashed potatoes were cold and my steak was beyond well done. I couldn't even eat it so I told the server that I didn't want it nor did I want to pay for it. He tells the manager and for about 5 different messages, he played messenger between the manager and me. I had asked him to bring the manager or cook out and they would not face me-- a young lady. Not only did they not come out, but the ""cook"" tried to justify that my steak was exactly what I asked for, but then later saying that it's a thin steak and harder to pay attention to flipping it or whatever-- or so the server said. WHAT?! How does LONE STAR make my thin steaks perfectly?! I will definitely NOT be coming to this place again and I advise anyone and everyone not to waste their time here either. I will definitely stick with Lone Star for the excellent steaks and superb service. Poor Management Bad food Mediocre Service",0.9618,0.808,0.12,0.072,0.6179761904761903

2014-08-12,3.0,"We were in town and my husband wanted to come here for dinner (he lived in Chicago a few years ago and had always raved about this place).  They don't take reservations for parties less than 6, so we rolled the dice and got here at 6:45pm last Saturday hoping the wait wouldn't be too painful.  The host told us it was a 1-1.5 hour wait and took down our name and #. This restaurant seems like it is in the middle of a residential area with not much around but uckily we found a bar nearby and decided to have a drink while we waited.  When we called an hour later to see where we were on the list, the host told us we would be seated ""soon"" so we paid our bar tab and headed back. Well ""soon"" ended up being another 1.5 hour wait!!! Despite us being at the top of the list, we noticed that they kept seating larger parties ahead of us - some with reservations and some without! The tables were pre-designated by party size. So if a party of 6 got up, they would seat only another party of 6 rather than put 4 or 5 people there. So parties of 4 would end up waiting a lot longer since most of the tables were larger. Then the table they told us was ours next was an older group of people who had already paid their check, but ended up staying ANOTHER HOUR to just hang around. The waitstaff couldn't have cared less that there was an angry mob growing outside and continued to pour them water and wait on them. No effort was made at all to turn the tables to seat the people waiting outside for 2+ hours.  As a  NYer, i have no qualms about speaking my mind so on my 5th trip up to the host, I told him that he couldn't keep telling people that they'd get seated ""soon"" but not do anything about trying to clear tables.  To which he replied verbatim:  ""I'm sorry you feel that way but in the restaurant business, we call it good customer service to let us customers stay as long as they like"". Um what? To which I shot back ""ok dude, I'm from NY and have friends in the restaurant biz so please don't lecture me about how it's done.  And if customer service to you means catering to rude customers overstaying their welcome and pissing off the ones who have yet to get seated...then you're in the wrong business"" Anyway, a total of 2.5 hours later, we get seated and we decide to make the best of it.  Wait staff were friendly and nice.  We ordered the spinach and cheese empanadas (amazing). and shared the vacio and vesuvio steaks.  The flavor on both were great.  We asked for medium and got medium.  However, the quality of the meat is not the best...it's a bit stringy.  But given the reasonable prices, you're really not going to get premium steaks.  We were also comped a cheese appetizer for our wait...it was a good effort but really would've preferred better restaurant management. So to sum up, come here on a weeknight, really early on a weekend or make a ressie for 6 and grab some strangers to join you for a good meal. Otherwise, be prepared for an insane wait due to the manager's inability to grow a pair and run his restaurant efficiently.",0.9963,0.798,0.151,0.051,0.4440123456790124

We've eaten here before but this last visit made an impression on us. We were back in town for a wedding this weekend, so we got a group together and made a reservation last week. Everyone likes this place, so our reservation ended up being for 15. They had us in for 930. Trouble was, people at the tables before us decided to linger and the restaurant wasn't able to seat us until well after 10. I had a lot of very hungry, not very happy people on my hands.  But the host team and servers - especially  our server Max - made it up to everyone. They apologized profusely and almost as soon as we sat down, they had the wine uncorked, brought out that amazing melted cheese appetizer (on the house) and got our order taken in record time. They also fit in an extra chair for one of our group that showed up very late - every group has ""that guy"" right? They even threw in flan at the end, which was a hit. And of course, all of the food was excellent. Sincere thanks to the Tango Sur staff for the top notch customer service, and for turning around an unfortunate start into a great dinner.

2014-08-04,2.0,"My experience at Tango Sur was very ""eh"" overall. They don't take reservations on weekends. We were told by a not-so-nice host that our wait would be at least an hour, probably more. But they take your phone number and you can go to the bar next door while you wait.  Once we were called, we were seated outside. The waiter came over immediately after we were seated, which was obviously not enough time to figure out what we wanted. Then he didn't come back for over 20 minutes. Between the host and the waiter, who was pretty indifferent to us, I certainly didn't think much of the service. There are only three good things I can say about Tango Sur. 1. It's BYOB and who doesn't love that? 2. The beef empanadas were absolutely delicious. 3. I did like the atmosphere. The outside seating was really very nice.  However, the steaks were pretty awful. Based on the overall 4 star rating on Yelp, maybe my experience was unique (however I do see a few other reviews that seem to match mine).  I ordered the short ribs which were incredibly fatty and tough. Absolutely do not order this. My friend ordered the Churrasco, which is one of their specialties. It was bland and tough.  And I have to give a special shout out to the worst salad in the history of salads. iceberg lettuce and a couple of thick slices of tomato. When it was served, I actually laughed.

It was very romantic and cozy, which I love. But the food...eh: 1) The empanadas - the breading was too condense and some parts were overcooked. The filling was pretty delicious, however. We tried the spinach and the beef. I would rate this 3/5 stars. 2) The chorizo - overcooked and not that special. I felt like we were eating a plain brat with chimichurri, so I would not suggest this. 2/5 stars 3) The steak - we ordered the Lomo Relleno, which is meant for 2 people, which is an argentine filet filled with chimichurri, ham sauce, and served on a grill with portabella marsala. The filet was a huge piece of meat but it wasn't sliced and it was cooked unevenly. I thought the actual quality of the meat was average. We were really excited for the ham sauce but the marsala overpowered the entire dish. Also, because it was so dark in the room it was hard to see if I was eating steak or a mushroom. I would give this 3/5 stars 4) Spinach Mashed Potatoes - I thought this was very average. Not a whole lot of taste or creamy buttery deliciousness found in most mashed potatoes. I would pass on these if I were to come back.I would give this 3/5 stars. If it weren't for the romantic ambiance, I don't think this place would be as popular.

I will definitely be returning, and would recommend it to anyone who loves quality meats, delicious sweets, and a good ol' BYOB.  So what if we waited 15-20 minutes to be seated? The weather was lovely and I was in great company. Besides, I never mind waiting a little longer for good eats. Speaking of which... - We started with the seafood salad (Mezcla del Mar), which was delicious! Fresh and savory, with a tangy little pop of fresh squeezed lemon that created the perfect flavor balance. Simple and satisfying. I could stand to have more of this salad in my life.  - I got the filet mignon entree (El Filet) and have zero regrets. It actually comes with two fillets as well as a little cup of chimichurri sauce (I could've used two of those) and a healthy serving of spinach and garlic mashed potatoes. I wasn't a huge fan of the mash, but that's more because I'm simply not big on potatoes unless they are either in fry form or sweet/yam form. Not your fault, Tango Sur. That's an ongoing personal issue I'm working through. - My date got the Bife Ve Suvio, which he destroyed. It was an amazing feat to witness, since they really load each dish up with copious amounts of meat. He just got really quiet and Hoovered that thing. I was able to salvage a sample and it was HEAVENLY!  - Holy mother of flan! Now when I tell you that I'm the kind of gal who ""likes"" flan, I mean that I don't particularly ""love"" flan. Like, I never go out of my way to get my hands on the stuff and am usually pretty ""meh"" about it when I do. But that thick, rich (but not too rich!) dollop of dulce de leche on top makes Tango Sur's flan the only dessert I ever want to finish a meal with ever again. Real talk. I don't ever need to see another piece of chocolate anything if I can have this stuff instead. My date is even less of a fan of flan, but was fully converted as well. Seriously: try the flan, thank me later. And to top it all off, our waiter was a dream: super friendly, helpful, attentive and hospitable. He was tipped very well in return :) All in all, this was easily one of THE BEST meals I've had since I moved to Chicago almost two years ago.

They probably haven't been to any of the big boys Chicago is known for. Even at a lower price point, it's just not worth it. The meat was, meh, not at all the awesome steak of my memories. I got the El Filet. Cooked right, just bland and really dependent on the sauce. The spinach mashed potatoes were just awful, no potato flavor and watery as other reviewers have said. Yes, no potato flavor sounds odd, but it was a flavorless green paste. The rolls are just sad: tough, cold, chewy in a bad way. Their service is VERY ""laid back,"" if you want something, like your check, you need to be assertive. Not a negative per say, just be aware and adjust your expectations accordingly.

2014-06-01,1.0,"So last night the wife and I went to Tango Sur in Chicago. We arrived just a few minutes before 8pm. I hand my keys to a valet  and he says, "" Just so you know we close at 11pm."" ( At the time I found it a bit odd considering it was not even 8pm yet.) I walked up and put my name in, the man there says, "" hour to and hour and a half."" I give him my telephone he will call when our table is ready.. my wife and I walk down to the irish pub about 2 doors down to kill the time. At roughly 9:45pm (about 15 minutes later than the latest time I was quoted) I got a call saying,""please come back your table is nearly ready"".. we walk back the 200 ft to Tango Sur to claim our table and the guy says "" please step to the left sir"".. we got behind one couple who within minutes was moved right in, then 10 minutes go by and its 10pm, my wife asks the man, ""how much longer do you think it will be?"" He replies with some suave and predetermined answer,"" Terribly sorry for the wait but we have guests who have paid their bill, we are just waiting for them to leave their table and we will get you right in."".. just then a guy behind us walks up speaking in Spanish and suddenly after a few chuckles he and his date are swept right in. I had enough, I began telling the guy off, more than a few choice words were surely included, the manager comes out apologizes and takes us right in and offers to comp our appetizer.. it is now roughly 10:05ish.. we sit down and our waiter comes by.. he brings water and walks straight away.. 5 more minutes go by(I'm watching every minute at this point I have to grab my car by 11pm) he finally comes back and we say"" Yes we are ready to oreder. Can you bring the appetizer out with the food, we've waited a very long time and have to pick up our car in less than an hour"".. the waiter looks dead at me and says, "" ah the kitchen is backed up it will be at least an hour til your food will come out."" I said"" but the valet closes at 11pm do they come in at least to give you your keys or basically am I losing my car potentially at 11?"" He nonchalantly shrugs at me and says "" hey were busy food will be an hour at least I dont know about valets"" I stood up middle fingers in air and walked out..

The empanadas were ordered for our appetizer were pretty good, they were cooked nicely and had a good crunch and flavorful filling. Unfortunately the positives stop there.  We were seated ridiculously close to another couple (I was much closer to the man at the other table than I was my husband. It took the intimate vibe to an awkward level). The bread we were served looked like day old rolls from Thanksgiving at Grandma's and tasted like it too. We waited over 30 minutes between our appetizer and entrees.  When the steaks did arrive the plates were swimming in juice from the meat. I ordered mine medium well and classifying what I got as rare would be generous. I requested that it be cooked more and when I got it back it was still under cooked, but I didn't feel like asking again. The meat was next to flavorless and the potatoes were runny.

We got the mixed grill for two ($40). The meat in that combo was unchewable.  Flavor was ok -  just had to spit afterwards since there was no breaking apart the meat with our teeth and using water to swallow meat as if it were pills is probably not how it's supposed to be done.  Told the waiter, he offered fillet and some unintelligible excuse for the other meat.  They brought 2 large plates with fillet (4 large pieces total) to replace the $40 combo.  The cost was something like $56 for the 2 fillet portions.  I'm ok with paying extra but the server always needs to explain  what he will replace the original order with and if there will be a difference in price. I wasn't expecting 2 separate portions, either.   Last but not least - the fillet had no flavor.

2014-05-01,4.0,"Tango Sur is an Argentine restaurant. Really special place, good price and good service. I have been there once and I will go back as soon as I can. The place is very typical: a rustic restaurant, not so fancy and the illumination is made by candlelight. The waiting room is small and do not have capacity for too many people, so I would recommend making a reservation. One thing that called my attention was the waiters; they were very gracious and one even tried to speak in Portuguese, which is the language I was speaking with my friends. When I arrived there, I was insecure because I have not eaten a good steak in a good price in the United States until that day. It is hard for me, from Brazil, to find places that I do not need to spend too much money to eat. Steak is something from our day-to-day and something that I miss a lot living here. This place made me feel at home and I did not have to spend a lot of money. For two or three hours, I thought I was in Brazil. Argentine restaurants in Brazil are very common and this one was as good as most of ones that I have been in Brazil. For me and most of Brazilians, a good steak is not only the way it is prepared, but also the cut of the meat. If you go to South America, you will find more cuts than here. The way you season your steak is important too and that is another thing that I liked a lot there. You could feel the quality of the beef and flavor of the steak mixed with garlic and salt. I was with five more people, all Brazilians. We started ordering empanadas, which is very similar to an appetizer that we have in Brazil called ""pastel"". It blew my mind and the price was amazing, $2 each! You could not taste the flavor of the oil because even being fried, it was very dry. The filling was amazing, it was a fluffy ground beef, not so dry and not do wet and well-seasoned with garlic, onion, salt and parsley. There was other types of filling available, but beef is always my first choice. Then we went direct to the point: the meat. We ordered four plates because they are large enough for two people. Two bife de chorizo, one vacio and one asado de tira. Everything was pretty good, but the bife de chorizo was so good that I almost cried of happiness, I could taste the medium rare flavor with the juicy pink center, the texture of the meat was like a butter and it was melting in the mouth. They all came with salad that was an example of ""less is more,"" it was simple and good: lettuce, tomato, onions, olive oil and salt. It is admirable how they turn simple plates in something that you cannot stop eating. In addition, there was another thing about what the restaurant offers: Guaraná soda. Guaraná is a plant native to Brazil, which has a fruit that is used to make the soda. It is as common and as popular to drink Guaraná in Brazil, as it is to drink Dr. Pepper or Rout Beer here. If you go to Tango Sur, I strongly recommend ordering Guaraná to drink. At the end, the total was $25 for each person with the service included, which is not too expensive since the quality is exceptional and everything was delicious. I recommend this place if you are in Chicago and I can say that it turned into my favorite restaurant here.",0.9978,0.834,0.146,0.02,0.5592980295566502

I was waiting for my group to arrive, and I was seated in the back waiting room where there are tables, wine glasses, and a corkscrew ready to go! I mean, waiting sucks, but drinking while waiting makes things a-ok.  On to the food ... man are the portions generous! Let's start off with the empanadas. They really are what everyone claims them to be : amazing, delicious, tasty, mouthwatering, appetizing.. you name it. I ordered 2 empanadas for $2 each and they were really filling! My group had fun sharing our empanadas with each other. Also, where else can you get an appetizer for $2?!  So the steak ... again, believe what everyone tells you when they say the portions are huge. Thanks Tango Sur for not only cooking up a delicious steak, but for also being pretty generous with the portion. I ordered the Churrasco and it was like 3 servings worth of meat for me. I had plenty of leftovers for the next day! The prices for the steak do seem a bit on the pricier side (my entree was around $23-24), but think of it as 2 meals in one and it justifies the price. (Not to mention the quality of the meat! I believe our server said the meat they use is grass-fed).  I would have given this place five stars except for :  -the dim lighting : It's nice and intimate, but is kinda straining on your eyes  -our server was kinda touchy: every time he spoke to us he would touch someone's shoulder or arm.

However, here's where the problem with Tango Sur begins: 1. No alcohol, zero, zilch. You MUST byob if you want vino. No choice.  2. We ordered two filets which are purportedly the best choices on the menu. The meat came out extremely chewy, RARE (even though we had ordered medium), and not seasoned at all. I am a veteran at Argentinian style steak. Unfortunately, this meat was very bland & much less appealing to our Spanish tastebuds than say...Outback Steakhouse.

So we decided to wait.  Turn off number one, the waiting room was full, what is your phone number we will call you at whatever bar you'd like to go to when we have a table for you.   The place is dark, loud and jam packed.  It is only because it is so noisy overall, that you can't hear the conversations in the tables all around you.  And this is fine, we were up for that scene, but know this before you wait 60-150 minutes for a table if you think you are about to have a romantic, quiet, meal.   The food was good, but it is probably not something I would wait this long for again.  Glad they are doing this well, but no dedicated foodie (which I am not) would wait this long for a meal that was only this good.   We began our meal with the Provoleta, an ""Argentine provolone cheese cooked on the grill with olive oil and roasted peppers.""  Fine, I was hungry, I like cheese, it filled the stomach.  Note, it was actually better with the very simple, and frankly bland, lettuce and tomato salad they begin your meal with.   My wife, a pesce-vegie, ordered their highly recommended Berenjena, or ""oven baked eggplant layered with spinach, provolone, parmesan and ricotta, served with a delicious tomato cream sauce"" and found it delightful, but also good, not great.  I thought the flavors were interesting, and was enthusiastic to share a few bites.  I had a happy stomach of Bife Ancho, ribeye from the grill, done just a bit more than rare.  Not sure why I have to feel this way, but I was just impressed that it was simply done as I had asked, this is so rarely the case ANYWHERE one orders steak.  But here is the simple truth, I can make a steak as good as their's at home.  Glad to have someone else cook, steak was good, but not a WOW Argentinean delight or anything. The wait staff was warm and friendly, but rushed, the door person was also kind and gracious as he basically told us to take our six pack of Revolution Anti-Hero IPA to a bar and wait for 90 minutes.  If you were not aware, this is a BYOB restaurant.  It was a fine dining out meal, and yes, I would even go back with only a nudge (as long as it was no more than a 45 minute wait), but if you are expecting a blow your hair back Argentinian meal, well you won't' find that here.  Just a typical Chicago neighborhood place with an Argentinean theme where you can BYOB and be lost and get drunk in the crowded and noisy chaos while enjoying a good meal.",0.9989,0.701,0.241,0.058,0.5987354497354499

The meat was succulent and tender, with carmelized edges here and there. The roasted sweet potatoes were simply seasoned and soft, almost to a mashed consistency.  Though the place was packed front to back including the waiting area, the staff was very very attentive.

My brother and dad got some steaks which were just also very sub-par. (My dad can make a WAY better steak). On top of that, the service was awful. I had to get up and ask a bus boy for our check because that's how MIA our server was. We didn't even bother trying to ask what was on the dessert menu.

Combine that with the Company of my lovely Wife and my two of my closet friends and you have an evening to remember.   The four of us were a hungry group. We started out with a couple of orders of Empanadas and the Provoleta. The Empanadas were delicious, but the Provoleta stole my heart. This is a dish of hot cheese served with Olive Oil and roasted Peppers. It was amazing.    For my entree, I decided to go with the Bife Vesuvio. It was a delicious cut of Steak stuffed with Cheese and Spinach. It was served with slices of Aregntine style Potatoes. It is one of the best Steak dishes I've ever tasted. And Yes...I even ate the Spinach.    Here's the delicious bottom line: Ive been to many places that serve delicious food, but Tango Sur has one commodity most eateries lack. That commodity is the staff. The staff at Tango Sur bend over backwards to make you feel at home. It seemed there was nothing they wouldn't do to enhance our dining experience. That my friends, is what makes Tango Sur great. If you haven't tried this place, you should put it at the top of your list of places to dine.

I could barely hear what my friend across the table was saying to me. However, the food just blew everything out of the water. I had yelp'ed this place before, which is why we chose to go, but I was so delighted about the food. We had a few of their empanadas and they were delicious. We devoured them because we were hungry and we couldn't get enough. For main entrees, the majority of us had Bife Vesuvio and one had a chicken dish from the Chef Specials but I don't remember which. The beef was divine. I was in meat heaven if that exists. It had a lot of moisture, and the flavor wasn't overpowering. After a few months, I can still taste it in my mouth... It was that memorable. I recommend it! Be sure to have an empty stomach though because most of us took the rest home. For dessert, we had flan, but all of us were so full that we took tiny bites out of it. The flan didn't let us down either because it was delicious. It was just creamy enough.  Overall, I really liked Tango Sur because of the food, but it was far too loud.

The service was good as we he had a friendly and helpful waiter. We all had a variety of the empanadas for an appetizer than we all got steaks.

Even though I love fried empanadas their baked ones are still heavy on the butter (think pie crust.) so they're full of flavor.  The Ham and Cheese are the best in my opinion.; usually overlooked by most people. The provoletta with roasted red peppers is great, but can fill you up pretty quick so I would only order that with 4 or more people if you're also going to get Empanadas which are a must. I always get the Parrillada para dos and if getting a few appetizers is enough even for 4 people. For Dessert definitively get the Flan.  I'm not a flan fan typically, but this isn't your normal, dainty, light, bland, jello-like flan like you'd get at a Mexican restaurant...oh no, it's a dense, rich, creamy, full flavored custard topped with Cajete (goat milk carmel) that is soooo delicious. Just expect a wait.  I see bad reviews based solely on the bad taste left in the mouths of people who couldn't get past it to focus on the food.  Get there early, or expect to go to Cullen's for some drinks beforehand.",0.9916,0.773,0.171,0.056,0.5454166666666668

Clearly the start wasn't the greatest, and some aspects as well, but the food and the service make up the 4 stars. After we were seated the service was speedy, and good. Our food orders were taken in a timely manner and we got our food pretty fast too.. My boyfriend and I got the empanadas to share, 1 spinach and cheese and 1 beef. I wasn't crazy about the beef one, just not my taste, but I did enjoy the spinach and cheese one. We also ordered the filet sharing dish, and subbed the mushrooms for mashed potatoes... We got the meat cooked medium, and it was cooked exactly how we asked.. pink on the inside, and oh so tender. I do wish that we would have ordered the filet for 1 person and shared because there was so much meat that it lasted us for lunch the following day, and I still have a piece left in the fridge. The BYOB aspect is great, bring whatever alcohol you want and joy it with your meal. This is NOT a place for a large crowd, and I have to say a group of 12 is too large for this place. It is soooo loud inside that you have to yell when you speak, so it would be much easier if there were 2 or 4 people together, not a big group trying to celebrate a birthday. Also, it is extremely dark here. I mean, beyond it being romantic.

There was so much food that there wasn't even a chance. We really went for it and ordered appetizers, then each had an individual dish. Was it intended for us to share? Of course. We did it wrong. It was more like: ""I'll order this and you order this and we'll share bites."" Seriously, there was so much food on our table and somehow we ate nearly all of it. I was full off the appetizers. My entree - the filet mignon - came with TWO huge cuts of filet mignon. Last time I checked, you order a filet and you get one. This was overkill, but in the best way (oh. so. good.) All in all, sharing is the recommended approach to dining at Tango Sur. I'll list off some of my favorites as there was so much to be enjoyed that evening: - BYO-wine, always a plus. - The spinach mashed potatoes are spectacular. Thick and textured and really green. The spinach and garlic add a lot to this traditional side dish. - Ham and cheese empanadas with chimicurri sauce; I preferred this pairing to the spinach and cheese. It was like a fancy homemade version of a hot pocket. No arguments when there's flaky crispy dough involved. - Filet mignon - as I mentioned above the dish comes with 2 large cuts of filet. There's a tasty red wine sauce that's drizzled a top the steak that just enhances the melt-in-your-mouth tastiness. - Order the provoleta. It's melty cheese and superbly savory. I love the addition of the roasted reds. I haven't seen that elsewhere. I will replicate at home.

I guess I have never had a really stellar empanda but trust me out of everything we had these were my favorite. Especially drenched in that home made chimichurri (rolls eyes in back of head and sighs--SO GOOD!) We also had a few other apps that were great. By time my filet came, I was sad to say I only could stomach like 5 bites, but dayyyyum. P.S. some good advice: Split the steak.

Butter and rolls at the table. The butter came in little foil packets, that industrial restaurant stuff. The rolls were slightly warm, but cheap white bread. I don't eat bread anyways, so I just let them sit there.  We were sitting outside on an early fall night that required the heat lamps to ultimately come on. The water guy was obsessive about constantly filling out our glasses with ice water even though I'd ordered a cup of hot water with lemon.  The ""salad"" was a joke. It looked more like the toppings for a burger. Two big pieces of lettuce (that was really bitter!) and two slices of mushy grocery store tomato and a big slice of raw onion. What kind of date joint serves raw onion at the top of a meal. The ""olive"" oil in they served on the side of the ""salad"" looked like that over processed half olive/half canola crap that comes in big jugs and the red wine vinegar didn't really add much to the already pathetic salad.  We ordered the ""Para Dos"" grill thing for the two of us. I've had better blood sausage. The chorizo was good, well formed but not actually spicy. The sweetbreads were alright. I haven't had a lot to compare to, but I ate a few. The flank steak was alright, but between the flank (flapmeat, as they call it on the menu) and the short ribs, I wouldn't confused ""range fed"" with ""grass fed."" This meat is most certainly grain finished. It's heavily marbled, gristly and fatty. We ordered a side of sweet potatoes. Looks like they cook-em just like I do at home, but I'd say they were slightly under-done. Throwing a sweet potato in an oven and peeling the skin off is pretty damn easy. I can do it. Preparing it in an interesting way would have made it worth the $5. It was not worth $5. I grilled mine on the little grill to give it some added flavor. The waiter was over attentive at the beginning of the meal, offering us wine glasses after we said we weren't drinking and didn't bring wine. Came back and offered to make suggestions on the menu. I usually accept suggestions and often request them, but I could tell that he was going to drive me nuts by talking excessively.  At the end of our meal as it got colder and colder, we waited a long time to be brought the check. Even after another waiter packed up our food for us, we sat there with a packed up meal and no check. My partner went to the bathroom and asked for the check. We received it, but then that sat there too. I walked the check into the restaurant and told them that we'd like to finish paying.  Honestly, for what I can produce on a grill, AND have my choice of cuts and preparation, I'd save the money and grill at home.

Food: Eh.  Ordered the ""para dos"" and shared it with the bf and everything seemed like it was something we could've done ourselves on the grill at home.  EXCEPT for the sweetbreads...good God those sweetbreads.  I've had sweetbreads before but these were bombdotcom.  They had a nice, almost char taste to them and they didn't have too strong of an earthy taste as other places' sweetbreads.  Other than that (and the BYOB aspect with no corkage fee!), everything else was just ""meh."" Service: I understand this place is insanely busy, but after we got our food, we didn't see any servers once.  We had to flag someone down every time we needed a refill of waters or the check.

I'm not quite sure what an Argentine Steakhouse entails, but if it's huge slabs of meat, sexy lighting with candlelit tables and decor that practically does all the work for you if you're coming here on a date ;), consider me a fan. My coworkers and I came with some wine (BYOB!) and indulged ourselves with delightful appetizers and a main course fit for royal feasts. You better come here hungry and anticipate leaving stuffed because the portions are huuuge and the meat bleeds delicious flavors. Being born in St. Petersburg, Russia, I grew up with stories of the WWII siege on the city and my grandparents successfully instilled me in a fear of wasting food. After all, who knows when I'll have to kill a man for that last potato?  So when my main course of Filet Mignon came out with 2 ~8oz pieces of filet and a slew of mashed potatoes, I knew what had to be done. Those stuffed empanadas and melted cheese appetizers made the job of finishing off this steak that much harder, but I pushed forth; full will ahead. The steak was delicious and cooked medium rare (and was even more on the rare side which I loved). I savored every bite with its delicious flavor and eating both pieces was a joy. I saw some of my coworkers covered with meat sweats after devouring their meal and I stood proud. Job well done; plate cleaned. This place is busy and the prices are really reasonable for the portions received ($15-30 per entree). If you're a meat lover, this is definitely the place for you.

2013-08-13,2.0,"Mediocre food. Terrible service. First the food:  We ordered the antipasta. It wasn't bad, but at $9 for a small, uninteresting deli tray, I would not order it again. When we asked where the mortadella was, the server shrugged and said that he guessed they must be out. Good news: your $20 steak comes with a salad of lettuce, two rings of onion, and a big mealy tomato! My girlfriend and I both got steaks. My strip steak was good, but then it's probably harder to mess up a steak than make a decent one. One way you might do that would be to leave the membrane on my girlfriend's skirt steak. The provided knife was not wholly up to the task of cutting through it, but we managed to peel it off ourselves. The sides of Vesuvio potatoes were soggy. 20 minutes after our table was bussed and we finished our wine, we got our check.  Unfortunately, I messed up and forgot my card at the table. My fault. MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT MAKE THIS MISTAKE. I tried calling during the day the following Monday to make sure they had the card, but couldn't get anyone to answer the phone. I figured I'd just stop by, since it's not far out of my way home from work. I was kind of disappointed after I'd walked 6 blocks from the train station to the restaurant only to find out that even though it was 6:30 (they'd been open for an hour and a half), the manager ""had stepped out, and would be back in 35-45 minutes"". Well, these things happen, right? I didn't have time to wait around, but on Tuesday I made sure that I called and told them I was going to be there in 45 minutes to pick up the card, and wanted to make sure the manager would be there. ""Oh sure. Come pick up your card."" You can probably guess where this is going, right? He had just stepped out for 35-45 minutes. Now normally, this wouldn't be a huge deal for me, but both times I was left standing in the sun, outside for 10-15 minutes while some guy disappears inside. Their attitude was completely indifferent. Nearly every interaction I've had with them makes it clear they couldn't care less about their customers.

2013-08-08,3.0,"Being a Yelper, of course I scoped out reviews for the people's favorite steakhouse in Chicago and came across Tango Sur. I thought I deserve the best for my first visit o Chicago and made my reservation a month in advance for this place for 2 people at 7:30pm. When we arrive at this quaint sidewalk steakhouse, the person up front told us that they were running an hour behind. So me and my friend went to walk down the block to a supermarket to get a bottle of wine and then went to a neighborhood bar to have a drink. When we came back, we were told that we would need to wait another 30 minutes. I wasn't happy but I already invested in a bottle of wine and an hour, and we were hungry, so what's another 30 minutes, right? Wrong. It started to rain... hard! The outdoor patrons were moved indoors one by one, and the wait turned into another hour and a half. So we waited for about a little more than 3 hours. The horror. It's not just the wait though, it's the attitude emitted by the very smug maitre'd who couldn't care less if you leave because they will always have business. It's the rain dropped into water containers and then poured into glass of customers, it's the paisan who jumps the line without a single word. It's the total lack of empathy towards customers.  Once we got inside past 10:30pm, we had bread to help with the long sufered hunger. I ordered the Parrillada Para Uno and my friend had the El Filet. The Parrillada was good other than the chewy and tough skirt steak and the overly soft blood sausage. El Filet is pretty soft and scrumptious. It's really good value for the price. I would be recommend this place if it wasn't for the horrible wait, but I just can't right now. 2.5 Stars.",0.9678,0.798,0.129,0.073,0.5139739229024943
2013-08-07,2.0,"This is a sad review. It's sad because I was so excited to eat the amazing food that 1200 other yelpers convinced me I would find here at Tango Sur. And I was severely let down.  It's become a pretty well known fact that I hate going into the city. The older I get, the further I want to be from the hustle and bustle and the weird smells and the non existent parking. But alas, one of my very dear friends was celebrating his birthday and chose to host his party here. The things I do for love. I spent an hour and a half in the car, then spent $16 to park in a lot because there was no street parking to be found. Dinner was a set price of $38 per person including 10% tip, so make it $45 per person because I'm not an a-hole. There were some appetizers. Meaning I had half an empanada. And there was a salad. But I was totally confused because the salad looked like what you get on the plate with a lox platter. Lettuce, two slices of tomato, and some raw white onion. Uhhh... Kay.  For my entree I ordered the bone-in ribeye. I ordered it rare because there were like 20 of us and I figured my food would sit under a heat lamp. So it came out and I took my first bite and it was dry and tough. Second bite was no better. It was really dark in there, possibly to make it difficult to see an overcooked steak. But I didn't need to see it to know it was cooked to at least medium well. I consulted with the people around me and all of their steaks were overcooked too, with the exception of the girl who had the filet. That filet looked amazing. So I definitely ordered the wrong steak.  The mashed potatoes were unforgivably bad. They tasted like they were 25% real potato, 75% boxed potato flakes. Mashed potatoes are like my favorite thing on the planet, but not when they come from a box.  Dessert was flan. I had a bite and I didn't care for it but flan is definitely an acquired taste.  2 stars because the service was excellent. Was my dinner worth the money? No. Was the company worth the effort? Absolutely. Will I come back? Probably not.",0.9654,0.798,0.129,0.073,0.5691959848936593

2013-08-04,1.0,"AVOID THIS PLACE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO WAIT INTERMINABLY. As a New Yorker, I am neither shocked nor immediately turned off by absurdly long waits. In fact, if I'm told that there's a 2-hour wait, I usually think of it as a testament to the restaurant's popularity & potential quality, and not as a nuisance. (If I've done my homework right, I also usually know to expect it.) What I absolutely CANNOT stand, however, is an obnoxiously cavalier attitude about wasting my time. Yes, I get that your restaurant has lots of people who would really like to be seated. But no, that doesn't give you the right to give us APPALLINGLY INACCURATE wait estimates. As always, rants can get long, so I'll summarize all you need to know before the jump: Food: 3 stars - average. The cheeses were bland, sauces were pools of oil mixed with chimichurri, and the meat was nothing to write home about (though there was a lot of it). Severely disappointing, given how good Argentinian-served meat can be ... and how hungry we were (don't people normally think everything tastes good, if they've been waiting 2.5 hours to eat?). Service/Seating: gets NEGATIVE stars, because: 1. the system is SO disorganized - the guy scribbles onto a pad, but there's little order (he just flips back and forth, to whatever he feels like), Even better, apparently THERE ARE MULTIPLE PADS - and you may be in one book, but not the other. Example that I witnessed: Maitre D.: ""Ma'am, I can't find your name in this book..."" The lady looks pissed and is about to start speaking Maitre D.: ""but that doesn't mean you're not on the list! Don't worry. You're probably just in his book, another book which is over there. Don't worry.."" [Hmm, if there are two separate books, and they're kept in two entirely different locations, how is coordination possible? (Here's a hint: it isn't.)] 2. This terrible, terrible seating system results in ridiculously inaccurate wait times. Now, I have enough friends who have been wait staff and etc., and I understand that not everything is in their control. But to be told it's a 1 hour to 1.5 hour wait, and then only to be seated 2.5 hours later (which is a 1-1.5 hour underestimation - basically a 100% margin of error) is simply unacceptable. ----------- The details - aka why I'm so angry that I'm using capslock: 3:00pm - I call as soon as they open on Saturday, to get a reservation and avoid the reportedly long wait. I am told that they are not accepting reservations, and that the wait for a party of four arriving at 7pm shouldn't be bad, about 45 minutes. 7:10pm - My friends and I arrive at the restaurant, we're told it'll be an hour to an hour and a half wait. Nevermind that it's about double of the 40 min estimate I heard on the phone, and nevermind that this other girl just says ""we have a reservation!"" and gets seated - I'm trying to be understanding, and just ""put my name down,"" which was essentially watching as the dude messily scribble in a small 3x5 notepad (aka that 50 cent Staples pad). We head to Dairy Queen to kill time. 8:30pm - An hour and a half later, my friends and I go back to Tango Sur. The dude haphazardly flips between pages, occasionally ripping them out (and losing them to the wind) before locating mine. ""We're running behind today,"" he says. What does that mean? ""It'll be 45 more minutes."" ... uhhh, whoa. My friends look annoyed (which always stresses me out, especially since I chose the place) but when we've already waited 90 minutes, what's another 45, am I right? My friends are starving, so we order drinks & appetizers at another place. 9:15pm - We still have not gotten a call from the restaurant, and it's been the full 45 minutes. Frustrated, I call the restaurant to inquire about how much longer. The guy tells me to come over. 9:17pm - We arrive at the restaurant, and the dude (.. same one it's been all night) tells us we can (FINALLY) go in ... to the waiting room. Can we order food? No. But we wll get the privilege of waiting inside! Oh my god, after TWO FULL HOURS OF WAITING, I actually get to wait in the heat?! It's our big break! By now I'm SUPER pissed, because this waiting game is getting really old, really fast. I tell him that waiting inside is pretty much the same as waiting outside, and we came over here under the impression that we were going to be seated soon. He gives me sass: ""sometimes customers take longer - what do you want us to do, kick them out?"" (uh, no - but you could certainly try proactive management?) By the time we're finally seated, it is 9:40pm. That is a full TWO AND A HALF HOURS that we spent waiting, basically DOUBLE the time he initially quoted us. If we had known from the start, we definitely could've explored an entire neighborhood and come back, as opposed to seeking shelter in the DQ ... ... aaand, that's the character limit (wow, anger really can be motivating ...)",0.6203,0.813,0.096,0.091,0.4741001738160829
2013-08-01,5.0,"This is probably my favorite place in Chicago. Tango Sur is a BYOB Argentinian Steakhouse on the Southport strip. I know it's probably been said many times, but there really isn't a better place to take a girl on a date if you are a guy: it's classy, it's meaty, and it's BYOB.  (Side note on BYOB, is there anything better if you are a guy trying to impress a girl? It looks swanky, you can pretend you have wine ""knowledge"", and it's cheap as s***)  Anyways, there is always a pretty long wait for this place (hour on weekdays, 2-3 hours on weekends), although I always seem to get in quicker than what they tell me. There are no reservations, but they'll take down your number to call you when a table is available, so you can go to any of the bars around to pass the time.  My girlfriend actually doesn't eat red meat, but she's a trooper and will still go along for the ride. She had the Gnoqui pasta one time we went, and had some kind of eggplant appetizer dish for her entree, which was actually pretty good, and I'm not an eggplant fan. My go to dish is the Bife Angosto, or the strip steak, with spinach mashed potatoes on the side. It is always a huge portion, and always amazing.  Also, be sure to get some of the empanadas to start, they come in a variety of options and are really good. If your date eats red meat, there is some kind of huge tray of meat you can get for two.

Never had bad food or service from the wait staff. Sadly they will NEVER get my business AGAIN. This is a long review, but I am shocked by their door hosts. 7:03 We showed up on a Saturday night expecting to wait an hour or more. We put a name for a party of 4 on the ""list"" (a tiny, unorganized notebook full of names and phone numbers... and scribbles). We were quoted an expected 1 hour to 1 hour and 30 minutes, first available. Fine. We had arrived about 45 minutes ahead of our friends for that reason. My husband and I go get drinks down the street, they will call when the table is ready. 7:45 Our friends show up at the bar. We ordered a round. 8:00 Another group (obviously from Argentina themselves) who put their names in just before us got their call and left. WE must be close! 8:25 No phone call yet, but we decided to walk back to the restaurant; our time was almost up! We asked the host politely how much longer. The host flips thorough pages and pages of names and tells us. ""Uh, there are about 3 tables ahead of you, so 20 more minutes."" He stated, ""There have been a lot of pay and stays tonight.""   I have been a hostess and I have experienced slow downs on busy nights. I am understanding.  9:00 Ask again, how much longer. Host ""I don't have your name in my book anymore, so the other guys have it. Very soon, very soon."" We have seen the ""other guys"" call people, but strangely, they seem to get the numbers straight from the head host. Hmmm... 9:15 It's 60 in July, and we have discovered that there is a waiting area inside, we must look miserable because we have been told ""You're the next table.... inside."" Us: ""Could we just wait inside then in the waiting area (that is empty we have discovered)?"" Host: "" Someone will have to escort you in, we can't just let people inside.""  Really? What club did we show up to tonight? 9:30 WE get called, this must be it, right? We were next.... 2 and a half hours?  No, wrong. We were finally escorted inside to WAIT, meanwhile there is almost no one waiting outside anymore, we have watched tables be seated and phone numbers called.  Quote ""I feel like I have to be someone's cousin, or speak in Spanish with the host to get a table tonight."" (This actually may be true....) We open one of our bottles of wine inside in the waiting area. We finish a bottle of wine. We go get another bottle of wine, two left to get four of us through dinner? Nope. Not after tonight. 9:45 While half our party goes to get wine, it appears that we will get called. Nope, that was the group of six that came in to wait AFTER us.  Then, the one of the hosts comes to get us.  Host: ""2 for inside?"" Us: ""No, 4, but we've been waiting almost 3 hours, we will sit anywhere. They just went to get wine.""  The host turns and practically runs away. Did we have a table or not? It seems that everyone else is getting one! 9:55 A group that has just arrived since the last is pulled to be sat. Desperately, I ask the last guy out of the room (they have a small party). ""Excuse me, how long have you been waiting?"" Guy: "" Do you REALLY want to know? (Nodding yes.) 5 minutes... but we had a reservation."" Us: ""Really, for 3?"" (They don't take reservations... read the other reviews.)  Guy ""Yeah... how long have YOU been waiting."" Us: 3 hours..."" Guy: ""What!?! 3 HOURS? Hold on..."" The guy walks away, one minute later, he comes back and says,"" That table is yours, right there."" Us: ""What?"" (Completely dumbfounded.) Guy: ""Yeah, right there."" He points and sure enough a table is being frantically set and  in the background, the host who so rudely walked away from us earlier is snapping his fingers at us from across the room (so RUDE!) and pointing to the table. 3 HOURS WAITING... Magically seated by a guy who got a reservation for 3 on a Saturday night at a place that doesn't take them? If not for this guy, who knows if we would have waited longer. WE have HIM to thank, whoever he is was. Does he work there? Is he related to someone who does?  Who knows, but HE was the reason we got our table.  Why did you wait that long?  That's stupid. Agreed, but the promising ""you're next"" and ""very soon"" comments kept us waiting. If I had been given an honest time in the beginning or if there was a system that didn't just seat those from Argentina or other hispanohablantes (there were many groups) first maybe it would not have been so long, maybe we would have gone elsewhere, but now I will never return.

The entrees themselves looked and smelled delicious. I had the churrasco and the steak was pretty big. I wish I had ordered it medium, instead of medium well. It was a little tough to cut through, but it was still good. The servers were pretty attentive to our needs. So much so, I drank a gallon a water that night. My glass never got empty of water lol. I had the caramel flan for dessert and it was good, but a little too sweet and rich for me. Otherwise, the experience there was quite lovely. Tips And/Or Downsides: - Make sure to make a reservation. They won't sit you unless you're with your group. They gave me a bit of a hard time, but they were nice enough to let me sit with one of my friends at a table while I waited for the rest of my group. - Street parking might be a little hard. It might take you a while to find a parking spot, unless you pay for parking at a lot or do valet service. - Make sure to tip your server really well, especially if they've given you great service. You don't want them to be offended. - One restroom for the Ladies, from what I saw so far.

Dark, romantic ambiance, outdoor seating on the patio on Southport, and no fee BYOB all help make this place a winner. The wait for a table can be long, but they have a room where you can get a head start on whatever bottle you brought with you. Service during a recent visit was competent, but not great with some difficulty communicating about wait times. However, the highlight of the evening was the food. We ordered 2 empanadas (beef and corn, $2 each!), El Fillet, and the salmon (sadly, my friend is a pescatarian). The salad that came with the entrees was nothing special, but the bread was good: crunchy on the outside, soft and warm on the inside. The empanadas were delicious. The biggest surprise was the entrees, they were huge! The El Fillet came was two sizable pieces of tender, well-seasoned, delicious filet mignon accompanied by a mound of spinach mashed potatoes. The steak was probably 1.5 to 2x the size of the filet mignon at other steakhouses. The salmon was similarly massive and while it didn't rise to the level of the magnificent steak, my friend thought it was excellent. Though we were both hungry, we were left with almost half of the filet and more than half the salmon to take home. For the money ($27 for El Fillet, $25 for the salmon with many other entrees in the high teens or low twenties), it's hard to think of a better deal in Chicago.",0.9924,0.758,0.189,0.053,0.5736482334869432

2013-07-05,2.0,"Valentine's Day: My date and I decided Tango Sur was the place to go. Bad decision.  I understand that this Hallmark Holiday turns a bustling city full of restaurants into a madhouse. There's a difference between a restaurant being busy; and a doorman that can't be honest with you. This review will not be about the food. This is dedicated to the staff, and level of service. First of all, I had no trouble with my waiter. The rest of the staff that was directing traffic was overwhelmed and clearly not prepared to handle the kind of customer flow in the restaurant. I am an office manager. Part of handling busy crowds is learning when you're about to bite off more than you can chew. You don't want to turn customers away; but you have to put your foot down at some point and recognize when you're compromising quality of service, and over promising on wait times. These yahoos had no idea how to run a business. First of all, it's almost like a club when you walk in. Instead of a cultural experience, you feel like you're watching a bunch of dudes pretend to be F.O.B. Eastern European when clearly they're not. I felt like every person working, who wasn't serving food, or involved with the kitchen; had an attitude like their job was beneath them. I don't normally criticize people in the customer service industry, as I work in it myself. You have to put up a front while you're working; and you need to show some compassion for the customers that are willing to wait. My date dropped me off to put our names down for a table while he hunted for street parking. I walked in the door and the look I got from the door guy came across like, ""I don't see your name on the guest list."" Strike 1. I ask him for a table. Before I can even finish my sentence, he cuts me off and speaks condescendingly to me. ""We have a wait. It's going to be an hour."" I respond, ""That's fine. Do you think it's possible that the wait could be longer than an hour because I don't want to wait longer."" I didn't get a straight answer, just lots of arm gesturing, and stumbling over sentences. It was a simple question. The man is dressed like he's been working in a corporate office, with the slight flare that says, ""It's Friday and I am hitting happy hour after work."" Pretend pretend pretend... The door guy couldn't promise me anything. I invite him to be frank, yet he still chooses to stick to his YOLO attitude, and he refuses to take accountability for any time. ""I'm sure it will be an hour, but if it runs over an hour I refuse to take blame for it."" What the heck is that? I decide to leave my number on a list for the door guy to call me when the table is ready. I know my companion loves this restaurant so I opt to try and tolerate the staff attitude. My date and I decide to grab a drink at a bar across the street. An hour and 15 minutes go by. No phone call. So we call them. Still the same run around. By this time I am starving.  We gave it 10 more minutes and walk over. We get up to the door, and their faces automatically frown when their same lackadaisical attitude isn't tolerated from me for the third time. I am understanding. If you've made me wait an hour and a half and I have not gotten a table, then you should have been able to tell me that the wait was going to be longer than an hour when I first walked up. I expressed my distaste with whom I believe was the manager on duty. He had long hair pulled in a pony-tail. The man looks at me like his feelings are hurt. Really? Your doorman can't be realistic with me and you have the nerve to look at me like I should be keeping my mouth shut at this point? Seriously, I would have been ok with taking my business elsewhere instead of these heathens giving me the runaround, wasting my time.    The manager's resolution to the matter is to shove my date and I into a tiny room, serving as a waiting area, already filled to the brim with unhappy couples. It was ridiculous. I wish my date would have suggested for us to leave before even going to the restaurant. After waiting in the room, the manager starts addressing me as ""senorita,"" thinking that is going to charm me into submission. I promptly responded to his dismissive attitude with what little Spanish I know; basically letting him know I am not impressed. This manager obviously thinks his appearance will compensate for his lack of experience. My date and I finally got a table.  If you go, expect to dine to techno music. I really think the staff wants to be in the Nightlife industry. Not foodservice. Even then, they would be inept if they had to run a club. They'd be too busy checking their faces in the bathroom mirror. What a narcissistic staff all around.  The food is just meat and potatoes, nothing special. My parents can cook the same way so I grew up on this kind of food. If possible, order it to go.",0.9549,0.833,0.091,0.077,0.47521258503401365

When we got there, there were only a few occupied tables. By the time we left, around 7:30, it got pretty rowdy. To start, the place was REALLY dark inside. I understand ""classy"" places like to do that but it was too dark for my taste. We started off with drinks. My fiance got the cream soda ($2) and I got the fruit soda ($2). We both enjoyed our drinks very much. For our appetizer, we got the spinach and cheese empanadas ($2 each). They were pretty good. The crust was a bit too crunchy for me and I've had better at the Randolph Street Market. I got the Berenjena (oven-baked eggplant layered with spinach, provolone, parmesan, ricotta and a tomato cream sauce $10). It was really good! My fiance got the El Filet (Filet Mignon $27) that came with spinach mashed potatoes. He was not a fan of his dish. He said it was average and nothing special. We were pretty disappointed since we read how popular the El Filet was.

2013-06-11,4.0,"If you haven't been here you need to give it a try. Given the number of reviews ahead of me this will only serve as white noise but I'll run you through what we ordered anyway. For starters the Spinach and Cheese Empanadas were pretty amazing. The filling had a nice blend of both and it was delicate and smooth while the empanada dough itself was tender, a little buttery and also delicate. These are a must try for sure. For a second app for our table we tried the Provoleta....Argentine provolone cheese grilled in a skillet with olive oil and mild roasted peppers. I don't recall if it was served with a bread of sorts but it should be, if you want to scoop this up even faster...though it was fantastic alone or laid over the empanada. For my entrée, I tried the Bife Vesuvio....a prime steak stuffed with spinach and mar del plata cheese, a garlic white wine sauce over that and then served alongside an Argentine style wedge potato. All I can say is, this dish is decadent on so many levels it's a little ridiculous...my only complaint was that the potatoes weren't cooked enough for my tastes giving them a little more bite than al dente. My entrée came with a simple salad that was a nice beginning to the end of the meal. The food aside, the ambiance is dim and a little romantic but maybe a little boisterous making it nice for groups. Given it is BYOB, and as Lucy G. noted...no corking fee, a group can have a pretty tremendous night here especially if you want to stay awhile and enjoy your evening with friends over some good wine and great conversation.  It can be a little noisy as mentioned and the space is a bit cramped too but settle in and order what piques your tastes...you'll likely love this place and need to return again for more.",0.9966,0.783,0.199,0.018,0.6446324143692564

2013-06-03,1.0,"BEWARE... TANGO SUR IS NOT WHAT IT ONCE WAS.  For a special occasion, my husband and I got a reservation at Tango Sur.  My husband had been there before, months ago, and loved it - RAVED about it, as many of these other Yelpers have.   Our dinner salads were un-inspired, but I was willing to let this go, looking forward to the main event.   I ordered salmon, but they were out, so instead I got the chicken (it was, again, uninspired).  My husband ordered a steak - cooked MEDIUM.   Pretty much everyone, we think, universally agrees that medium means there is some pink in the middle?  Well, the steak that came was completely grey, inside!  It was DONE to WELL DONE, no medium in sight.   We both looked at it, a few times, and agreed it really should go back.  It was just plain over-cooked.   My husband asked the waiter to come over, showed him the steak, explained that he'd asked for it medium, and politely requested a new steak - something he rarely, if ever, does.  Two seconds later, one of the higher-ups (we're not sure if it was a chef, or the manager) came over, and attempted to argue that the steak was cooked correctly; ""for this cut of meat, this is medium"".   My husband and I were horrified - who doesn't know what MEDIUM looks like?  Worse, who would argue with a customer, out in front of everyone?  The higher-up would not hear any arguments; according to him, we were wrong, and the steak was cooked properly, end of story.  In the end, he sent the steak back and asked for them to take it off our bill (which, at least, they did).  Any establishment that A) doesn't understand ""medium"" includes some pink, and B) would argue with a customer, over ANYTHING, really... doesn't deserve to stay open.  We were as nice as can be about it - we really were shocked and dismayed.   So - really think twice before dining here.  If you're looking for a great steak, or amiable service - go elsewhere.  Something has gone horribly, horribly wrong at Tango Sur.  It is no longer the establishment it once was.",-0.9673,0.776,0.09,0.134,0.46195386403719735

The staff here can come off as rude, but they're always crazy busy and they do their best to get you seated and your food out to you without a long wait so I can put up with it.  The ambiance here is cool - dark, intimate, good music.  Overall this is a great place and will be one of the cheaper steak dinners you'll have in Chicago that doesn't sacrifice quality.",0.9747,0.737,0.179,0.084,0.5032436162870946

There isn't really a waiting area and they didn't seem to like us standing around so we walked to pick up our wine and grabbed a drink a bar next door. Even at 9 we saw people coming and having to wait a while. The restaurant has a fun and lively atmosphere. I'd have to say the wait was worth it. The food was amazing and you will have plenty of leftovers. We got the fried provolone cheese as an appetizer which was awesome would definitely suggest getting that.

It is a BYOB restaurant so we brought two bottles of wine and they graciously corked them for us. We opted to share the Lomo Relleno between the two of us. it was more than enough meat. We initially asked for it to be cooked medium-rare but it was recommended that we go with medium. When we got it, it was obvious that it was still cooking at the grill that was out our table. We wish we would've gone with medium-rare as medium was a bit more than what we desired. The very innards were will pinkish red; however not much beyond that was pink. There was just more flavor in the very center. I recommend that you ask for more chimmichuri as it is DELICIOUS. Service was good. Food was good. We'd go back.... Maybe with a party of four.

I made a reservation for two, but I don't think it mattered because we showed up shortly before the place maxed out so there were plenty of empty tables.  We enjoyed our byo-wine at our little table complete with lit candlestick and started out with some empanadas.  The empanadas (spinach and cheese; chicken) were the highlight of the meal for me...   Birthday boy ordered some side sausages + a big steak that came with a heaping pile of mashed potatoes.  They were completely out of all fish options for the night (what??) so I went with lemon chicken and potato spears.  I thought the chicken was over-seasoned / too salty, and it was swimming in an oily sauce - I didn't end up eating much of it.  Before entrees were served, we had a very simple salad of greens, onions and tomatoes.  Because of the birthday, we were presented with a cute little flan before getting the check.  This was very rich and tasty - a nice end to the meal.  Verdict: Loved the interior - small, cozy, candlesticks everywhere.  Service was attentive and prices fair.  Wasn't that impressed with food (with the exception of the awesome empanadas) - steak was pretty fatty / not a great cut.  I would go back, but would order a different entree.",0.9881,0.795,0.162,0.043,0.6559151785714286

They had Inca Kola from Peru which I begged my bf to try (it's like a Mountain Dew but better). For apps we got empanadas, the spinach and cheese was a favorite and the chicken was tasty. We also got the cheese appetizer which was greasy and literaly a bowl of melted cheese. I had no idea how to eat it so I put it on the bread, and still got it everywhere. We got an assortment of meats to share that came with a salad (lettuce, tomato, onion, oil and vinegar-- no frills and pretty disappointing). The meats came out on this grill thing that was cool looking and had 5 kinds of meat. The chicken was alright, the steaks (there were two different kinds) were both really tasty, especially with the oil and parsley sauce that came with it, the chorizo was good, but the blood sausage was not, it exploded when my bf cut it open and when I took a bite it was a mouthful of fat....sooooo gross.

However, a friend wanted to go here and I agreed.  I wish I would have known it was BYO because I have plenty of wine at home, but Jewel is just down the block, so it's not really an issue.  Also, having a 30 min or so wait allows for drinks at the bar next door or a trip to buy wine at Jewel (or both!). We shared a few things at the restaurant and I had never been there and was pretty hungry, so I opted to let the waiter give suggestions.  We shared 2 empanadas, the hearts of palm with prosciutto and then shared a (massive) traditional steak.  We ordered the steak off of the 'special' menu and I thought it was delicious.  The potatoes were also lovely.   All in all, it was a great spot.  I noticed that most everyone in there was on a date or else with a large group of friends.  It's dark and dim and very boisterous and fun.  Definitely a good spot for a friend's dinner, date or group spot.

Put the melted cheese on top of the tortilla, amazing!! I had the El Filet which was the filet mignon special. It was so good. The beef was Argentinian beef, which was cooked well (juicy and full of taste). It came with a side of mashed potatoes.

No joke, 3 hours, but if you bring an Argentinian they will at least get sassy enough with the host to move your wait along. The place is cramped with a closet-sized ""waiting room"" or do what we did and run next door to the pub. The food is good, really good. Skip out on the fluff and head straight for the meat. The empanadas are amazing. They come with a chimichurri sauce, which I loved but was scolded that it really doesn't go with empanadas. Who cares if you love it, drown your food in it. We shared a charcoal grill of different meats and beef parts (sweetbreads, blood sausage, flank, skirt). All delicious and mind you very heavy. You could feel the heartburn. The restaurant is BYOB which is a plus for you alcoholics on a budget.  I haven't been here enough to figure out the best method for avoiding await but it appears that if you travel in groups larger than 8 you can make reservations, but please don't be the obnoxious party of 20 on Saturday (you know who you are, and yes death glares were directed at you!)",0.9941,0.706,0.238,0.056,0.5026315789473684

We had a reservation and our table was ready right when we were so there was no wait, but I can see the back area as a good place to be able to start drinking your wine if you're waiting for your table and you're not in the way of everyone else that is dining.    Staff: Our server Daniel was great, he was incredible patient with us since we took a long time to order. (too busy talking) He was attentive during the entire meal, as were the other staff that was quick to make sure our water glasses were full the entire time. (both worse than an empty water glass when you're thirsty).  Food: The food like everyone else says is beyond amazing! The portion sides are huge (yay for left-overs for lunch, which had co-workers drooling).  We both ordered the filet (med rare) and it came out perfection.  They use the perfect amount of seasoning and the meat is just so great.  Exactly what I wanted. Ask at Tango Sur, and you shall receive.  We decided to pass on dessert, but Daniel surprised us with some amazing flan.  Unreal.   The littlest things can add OR take away from a good experience.

The decor is pleasant with a very dated wall map of South America that my hubby always finds fascinating.  The only down-fall is that it gets quite busy on Saturday nights with wait time for about 30-40 minutes. We prefer to go for lunch on Sundays when it is nice and quiet and we can talk.

2013-02-07,5.0,"Tango Sur is the perfect date night restaurant. In fact, it's nearly flawless in all aspects. I love that it's BYOB, and the entrees I sampled here were generous and rich. We had enough left over to create a second meal that was just as filling as the first. When we dined here last November, we started with two empanadas: the spinach & cheese and the beef. We followed these up with two entrees: el filet (fillet mignon topped with a red onion wine sauce and served with spinach mashed potatoes) and bife vesuvio (prime steak filed with spinach and mar del plata cheese and garlic). Although I knew the servings were going to be heaping, I was still stunned to see that my fillet mignon was actually two perfectly prepared steaks, well complimented by the spinach mashed potatoes. The green lump on my plate was a little odd-looking but tasted heavenly. The bife vesuvio was also delicious, although, quite honestly, we felt it was even better the second day. Tango Sur is a bit noisy - my boyfriend initially thought that his parents would enjoy the restaurant but decided it was a bad idea since his father would not be able to hear a word anyone was saying. We even struggled a bit, and this was on a Monday night. Still, I liked this aspect of the experience. Even on that snowy Monday night, the room was alive with conversation, as diners enjoyed their exquisite food and wine . My time at Tango Sur was so wonderful that I cannot wait to go back. I am hesitant, though, to do so on a weekend. I wish they took reservations, as I can see from other reviews that this seems to be one of their failings. I can only speak for my own experience, though, which was perfectly fine. Fortunately, our anniversary fell on a Monday, so we had no problem getting a table. The restaurant did fill up, though, so if you're planning to go at a peak time, be prepared to wait. From my experience, though, it's definitely worth it.",0.9946,0.74,0.198,0.062,0.5269607843137255

The salad was what everyone described to be. As for the main course, our order was taken about 10:20 (I was on my 5th glass of wine). I was craving the churrasco steak and the waiter recommended the Argentinean churrasco ($5 difference). I got what he suggested because ""it was better quality meat."" When food arrived (11pm), I found the 12 oz steak to be extremely dry, the chimichurri helped a little with flavor. Took 3 bites of it and ate the vesuvio potatoes. The skirt steak was juicy and people in my group raved about the ham & cheese empanadas. Others who didn't have the steak, liked the chicken and ravioli. I would recommend this place if you're looking for a place to drink, mingle with friends, and not crave a steak.

Food: 3/5 Decor/atmosphere:3.5/5 (dark, trendy, but too loud music for a date) service: 1/5 (explains below) So I went this place with my bf, we were on a date and I liked the idea of BYOB, and great reviews about steak. We ordered the EMPANADAS, which many reviewers recommend, and as an entree my bf ordered the COSTELETA, which is bone-in ribeye and I ordered the El Fillet which is the fillet mignon. I first ordered something else and then I changed my order because the fillet looked better to me. Why I gave it 1/5 for the service: The first reason I gave this place a 2 star is that the server took my order wrong and was being very rude and unprofessional. I could tell that his first language is not English, and I had nothing against that (I speak other than English at my house too), but if you made me wait for 30 minutes and gave me something that I did not order, he should have at least apologized me whether he would give me what i order or not later. Instead, he was giving me this sloppy look and pointed his finger at the menu   and said  ""Look, this is what you ordered and changed. So I;ve brought this to you."" I was like no, that's not what I ordered, I ordered the fillet mignon. But he kept insisting that I ordered what he had brought me, and after arguing for about 5 minutes, my bf was almost getting up and ready to leave the restaurant and that's when, finally, the server said, ""ok, I'll bring you the fillet mignon. It's gonna take like 20 minutes if that's ok."" I honestly wanted to get up and ask for the manager and speak to him/her. But it was a beautiful weeknight and there were people around us enjoying their beautiful weather, so I just decided not to go there.

He's the guy who would eat everything if it's red meat, but even he said it's too greasy and fatty. Mine was no different than his. It wasn't like OMG-it's-so-bad-that-I-can't-eat, but it wasn't something I expected since I read so much positive reveiws on Yelp. Overall: One word. DISAPPOINTING.

The spinach potatoes that come with the dish are great and have something in them I can't put my finger on. Also had the empanadas, tomato and egg salad, and the flan for dessert. All were delicious but, the flan is simply the best mouth-gasm I've ever had.  The ambience is sexy and provides the perfect backdrop an intimate evening. The candlelight is something more restaurants need to get back to doing. Word of advice, unless you show up before 6pm, THERE WILL BE A WAIT! Plan accordingly, and if you are hosting a dinner here, perhaps you should go early to make the reservation and allow for them to accomodate your group size. I also would not advise taking the little ones to this particular restaurant, it is not child friendly. It is BYOB (what is better than that!) so feel free to tote in your beverage choice, I've even seen tequila bottles and tecate cans on tables so, there ya go! The service is warm and efficient. This place is run like a well oiled machine and has never disappointed. Go to Tango Sur, they have some of the best steaks in Chicago!",0.9966,0.775,0.215,0.01,0.6002976190476191

I can't say much that others haven't already, but I would like to put in my highest recommendation for the lomo relleno if you're ready to go into a mushroom and saucy-meat coma (serves two...for about a week). Their empanadas are also awesome.  I always head to tango sur at about 5:30... this is right before the gets too long and I'm able to open my wine and sip it in their nice wait room.

2012-12-26,4.0,"Tango Surrrr....yumm....thinking about this place makes me drool again; that being said, unfortunately none of my other dining companions seems to share the same sentiments,,so let me just give some advice on how to enjoy this place to the max!!! 1) this is NOT a prime steakhouse,so don't expect to get meats that melts in your mouth a la wagyu beefs...their beef can get a bit grainy, but my steak came out fine and my wife's veal was pretty good. 2) they are NOT known as a salad joint either,so if they say the foods comes with salad, and all they bring is a small plate of lettuce,onions, and tomato slices with not even a dressing; that's probably because they probably expects you to be carnivores and the salads are just there to make your wife....or your teenage daughters happy. 3) Be adventerous. When you see tounges served as appetizers and sweetbreads as a sidedish...Go for it!!!! I never had sweetbreads before and I'm not sure I really want to know what it is..but I thought they were pretty good. 4) Bring your own wines!!! They don't sell wines, but they allow you to bring your own,so next time I'm here..I'll be bringing bottles...heck, if you see me in the restaurant, I might be selling one of my wines for a hefty profit..gotta find a way to pay for the meal somehow!!! So overall...the place has a nice ambience, excellent for big crowds..service was pretty good, they did spill some meat juice on my lap at the end of my meal, but I was so high on meat that I didn't really care by then...and the foods were more than edible...good in my opinion, not as much according to my wife and friends.. but I was more than happy to finish their foods, even after I got done with my Lomo Relleno, which was meant for 2 people...what can i say? I have a huge appetite for life!!!!",0.9938,0.811,0.158,0.032,0.5974603174603174
2012-12-23,2.0,"I'm rather critical of my dining experiences, I enjoy being this way, and I'm thrilled when a business meets my expectations.  If you're like me, then Tango Sur is not the place for you. Overall, the entire experience is of a lower quality; especially for the price-point.  The music was an overly loud loop of bass-heavy pseudo-latino dance music befitting of the byob vodka and red bulls at the table next to us, but clashing with the candlelight.  The service was mediocre.  I had to ask for another plate and 2 more sets of silverware for our party of 5.  The waiter was sufficient, but disinterested. The food was okay.  The salads are horendous.  They look like a plate of condiments for a cheeseburger: bagged iceberg, two circular tomato slices, and a handful of onion rings, undressed.  The lengua lacked flavor, the empanadas were rather plain, and our steaks were unimpressive in flavor, cut, and internal temperature.  A medium rare fillet mignon had to be sent back, as it was cold in the center; but all of the entrees were decidedly underdone. All things considered, I definitely won't return.",0.8591,0.859,0.095,0.046,0.48853383458646615

I don't give a shit, tell him he has to wait.  sorry bro, I may be white, but yo habla espanol..  The kid walked up to me and repeats the 45 min line and tells me he's sorry it's first come first serve.  FIRST of all, I'm industry there's no way you go from wide open to a 45 min wait in less than 20 min.  Second, there's a single man at a 10 top seated without his party, and next to that table is an open four top, when I told the guy to kick rocks and walked out  into the street I saw through  the window that the back room had 3 more open 4 top tables.. So where's the beef?  IDK and I don't plan to ever find out.  I don't need to try your food to give you guys one star; and frankly I never will.  I'll take my money to another decent steak house that actually cares about their costumers regard.  It's sad with service this terrible you average out to be a 4 star restaurant, I guess that's what happens when you have 300 mixed reviews.  I really enjoyed the mile walk back to my house hungry and carrying a stupid bottle of wine.  kick rocks Tango Sur...",-0.8327,0.835,0.072,0.093,0.4535247432306255

Not bad from a place that is always packed. Empanadas - they have a few choices, but so far I have tried most of them. My favorite is the chicken and the ham and cheese, but you cant go wrong with any of them. They are really good and I love coming here for them. Absolutely the best! Jamon Crudo Con Melon - thin slice of ham served with a cantaloupe. This was good, but I could pass on this next time. Berenjena - oven baked eggplant with spinach mixed with a delicious cream sauce. This is my second favorite thing here. El Filet - fillet mignon topped with red onions. This was pretty good and the fillet was juicy and perfect. Lomo Relleno - fillet mignon that had a lot of fat and tendon to it. Definitely not what I was expecting from a fillet. This was a huge serving that could easily serve 2 people. I was disappointed in the quality of this steak and I wouldn't get this again. Overall, this place gets packed and they only take reservations for bigger parties, but they were nice enough to squeeze me a reservation for 2 on a Monday.

Oh well, that didn't matter to me. I had gone to Tango Sur for my birthday some years back and I had never been able to shake the thought of going again. So, again I went to an early dinner with a friend of mine and I was impressed again. The atmosphere and the courteous way everyone treats you makes the experience a lot better. I ordered the Bife Vesuvio which is Grilled Prime steak stuffed with Spinach and Cheese while my friend ordered the El Filet which was filet Mignon with Spinach Mashed Potatoes. They served bread w/butter along with salad. We didn't order any appetizers because I wanted to save my stomach for the real meal. It took a while for the server to serve us our meal, but it was worth the wait. I loved my dish.....especially the spinach and the Argentine potatoes that were served with my steak. The seasoning was good but just a tad bit salty for my taste. It didn't stop me from enjoying my meal though.....believe me. My friend's filet was cooked to perfection and by that I mean it had the right amount of redness (Medium Well) not to mention it was so juicy and it just melted in my mouth when he let me try a piece. I finally had to stop eating my dinner because there was no way I would leave without trying a dessert. I loved the little tray the server brought around to help us decide what dessert to get. I ended up getting the a light cake with peaches and my friend got cheesecake.....They were both superb and I'm glad I saved room for  them.

2012-11-08,1.0,"I'm really just not a fan of this place.  It seems to me that everyone in Chicago who is fairly new to the city or is younger has heard of this place and lists it as one of their favorite restaurants in the city.  I disagree, and here's why. Wait: This place is always super crowded and I think they only take reservations for large groups.  Even when my group has had a reservation, we still wait, and not just for a short time.  I'm talking 30 minutes to an hour, with reservation.  Further, the doorman was not friendly or helpful regarding wait time and whether any of my party had arrived and was in the waiting room.  He also said the wait room was crowded and full, so I had to wait outside, despite that the rest of my party was inside waiting. Atmosphere: Even when I have been seated, the place is dark and crowded.  We had a reservation for 14.  But they gave us a table for 10, which makes for an unpleasant dinner.  My hips were in one spot, but my shoulders were twisted to be able to fit everyone.  Every table is crowded together, and the room is far too dark. Service: I'm underwhelmed.  They aren't friendly or helpful.  And the service here is slooooow.  Expect to wait longer after ordering. Food: If I want my breath to taste like garlic for the next five days, then yeah.  The food is generally good, but it is also not overpriced.  The food is not really my issue with this place.  It's fine, I think people find the concept of a steak for $20 or less to be awesome, but you're not getting a Joe's quality steak.   I think people like this because you can get a tasty steak for a very low price.  You pay for this however in the form of poor service, crowded room, and wait time.  I'd honestly rather pay three times the price, get a top quality steak, be seated at the time of my reservation, and have friendly service.  Not to mention actually having my own space and the ability to move my arms to eat!",0.9396,0.816,0.109,0.074,0.5236803095894005

2012-10-13,1.0,"Tango Sur and I are breaking up.  I've brushed some questionable service issues off my shoulder over the years, but last night was the final straw.  Just your standard case of unrequited love.   I loved you Tango Sur...for nearly a decade.  But you never appreciated me - I know this now.   Nearly nine years ago when I moved to Chicago Tango Sur was recommended to me by a co-worker and after experiencing their amazingly inexpensive yet divine cuisine, and adorable setting, I was head over heels in love (or as I would come to find out - blinded by love).  I was so in love I continued to frequent the venue for celebratory gatherings (birthdays, engagement parties, etc.) and anytime I had an out of town guest, Tango Sur was the first place I would take them.  While working retail on Michigan Avenue  I even recommended Tango Sur to tourists assuring them it would be worth the $20 cab ride to and fro.   Honestly, Tango Sur should have been paying me - I was a  referral/advertiser/supporter and never asked for anything back in return but average (often times less than average) service and meat - delicious, perfectly executed meat - and lots of it!  But looking back I should have seen the warning signs.  I mean, once a server argued with me when I politely informed him the empanadas he delivered to the table were cheese and spinach when we had actually ordered chicken.  ""No, you ordered spinach and cheese.""  Um.  What.  So I guess I shouldn't be surprised about the actions of the staff last night.... I arrived with my parents, a couple of friends, and one Tango Sur virgin at 7:55PM for our 8:00PM reservation.  We were told we were the next table to be seated once a six top left so we were kindly escorted to the waiting area where we were told we could pop our wine while we waited - standard practice.  We waited several minutes for glasses and when none came, I sought out the host and asked if we could have a few glasses for our beverages.  I was told they were short on glasses but that some should be available shortly.  I won't go into too much detail about what transpired over the next hour of waiting in that room but let's just say, an hour wait when you supposedly have a reservation is made tolerable by drinking wine...however, because over that hour no glasses were ever made available to us, we sat staring at our full bottles of wine...and at each other...agitation growing by the minute.  I politely checked on the status of the glasses a few times while we waited always being told they were coming.  And when checking on our status in line - ""you're next.""  But once the clock struck 9PM, my frustration could no longer be contained.  My guests were yawning, and I was hungry.  So I approached a server and asked if we could get ANY glasses - whether that be a coffee mug, water glass, just something so we could ease our frustrations of waiting an hour with some wine.   His response... ""PLEASE!!!  Can you have some glasses, PLEASE!!  As you can see we don't have any and NO we won't give you ANY glass.  We'll give you WINE glasses when they are available but we don't have any.""    As if the hour we had already waited for our RESERVATION wasn't bad enough, tears welled up in my eyes from being berated in front of fellow patrons.  And with that, we packed up our belongings and headed for the door.  As we approached the host he pointed to our table thinking we were coming to sit, but we continued on, letting him know we would be dining elsewhere.  Management followed behind to find out why we were unhappy but the apology didn't feel sincere, nor did they make much of an attempt to convince us to stay and make things right - after all, they probably had another pissed off party of six they could seat once they wiped their hands clean of us.  All the while I was wiping tears away, completely embarrassed as diners observed our exchange. Honestly, my feelings are hurt.  After all this time, and so much loyalty to this business, in the end I found out I'm just another customer to them...really less than that.  Ironically, my server from my very first visit in 2004 happened to be the very same gentleman who followed us out to issue an apology.  I'm sure he sees so many people in and out, he probably didn't make the connection - perhaps if he had, he would have tried harder to save the relationship. Break ups are hard.  But there are plenty of fish in the sea.  Or in this case, steaks in the city.  And I intend to find one served with a side of customer appreciation.",0.9976,0.796,0.142,0.062,0.4290343915343915

My latest visit is the reason for my 1 star review: We got there around 4:00 on a Saturday - this is not a ""rush"" period for this place, so we were seated within a few minutes.  Our server was not friendly at all.  He offered no greeting, no menu recommendations - he barely spoke.  His tone turned to more annoyed when we told him we only wanted to order a few appetizers and one entree (again, it was late afternoon).  The appetizers came out as ordered, but after that our already cold service went from annoyingly tolerable to horrible.   Our server would disappear for 20 mins at a time and even when he was around he never checked on us or brought out the entree.  People around us that came much later were already eating the exact same thing we ordered.  When we inquired he said ""well done items take longer"" like we were idiots (and for the record, well done adds like 3 minutes, not 30) rather than the obvious which was that he forgot to put in our order.  Another 20 minutes passed before we had to ask another waiter to find our waiter and another 10 mins passed before he came over - without the entree.  When we inquired about the entree again he said ""I'll let you know when its done."" We finally asked to take the entree to go and to get the check, which of course, took him another 100 years to give to us and then even more time passed after that before we got the entree. I used to be a server and I don't take zero tipping lightly, but this guy was arrogant and incompetent and I wasn't about to let him squeeze 20% out of me on a very unpleasant dining experience (that he caused).  This is only the 2nd time in my life I haven't tipped someone. Here's the best part...when he saw that I stiffed him he actually had the balls to chase me down the street to get in my face about it.  Yes, a grown man chased three women (one of which was 63) down the street to get in my face.  I told him flat out why his service was horrible and what was his reply ""You must not be from around here."" I responded, ""I live two blocks away, what's your point? I should know better?""  Comfortable with the fact that I really did think he just sucked and I wasn't a clueless tourist his last words to me were ""I hope you choke on that steak.""

After picking out a wine and sitting down at the bar, I got a phone call as they had had some sort of cancellation and we only ended waiting 15 miutes for a table for two. The food is just volumous. We orded a steak for two that came with portabella mushrooms and the thing was no less than 2 lbs. It was $40. Tip and tax meant $50 for a pretty decent meal. Have I had better cuts of steak? Yes. Have I had better value steak? Probably only in Argentina itself.",-0.3527,0.853,0.072,0.074,0.4427083333333333

2012-07-20,4.0,"This is a quaint little steak house with a hip, yet romantic dining room, and ample outdoor setting.  The noise level was very bearable, and decor was laid back.  This was my first time dining at an Argentinian steakhouse, so I had many questions, as well as a pesky dairy allergy. Our server was friendly, attentive, and more than will to recommend, and cater to my allergy. I find that many servers become irritated at my allergy, which is ridiculous, because I'm am NOT a fussy eater.  My friends started with the antipasto, which was nothing special.  It was good, but neither the presentation nor the quality was to write home about.  I was torn between two allergy acceptable items, and our server helped me choose lengua a la vinagreta.  The beef tongue was braised nicely, and the texture and flavor of the tongue was to die for.  I have never been served cold tongue, and it's something I will try again.  My friends who were resident in trying it- LOVED IT.  Prior to dinner, we all received a complimentary salad- plain, but I can't complain, it was free.  Now to my main Chef's specials entree- costeleta which is a bone in rib-eye, which is then grilled, topped with olive oil,  and a garlic and parsley sauce, served with mashed potatoes.  Due to my allergy, they kindly substituted the potatoes with a allergy friendly potato side.  When my food arrived, my server was kind (this doesn't happen very often) and reassured that my entire entree was dairy-free, which includes butter.  He went one step further, and told me all the ingredients, and prep.  I shouldn't be worried when dining out, but too many times I do worry about my allergy. The best part of the meal was how the steak was seasoned and cooked.  It was a perfect mid-rare throughout, the cut was great, and it was seasoned absolutely perfectly.  I usually either want to, or go ahead and have my steaks returned to the kitchen, however this one was perfect :)  I'm very grateful of this, since I don't eat much red meat, this is a bi-monthly occurrence, so it was nice that it will be memorable.  Oh, onto the BEST part. It's BYOB, and corking services are FREE!!! The servers were always attentive of the bottles, either opening the next bottle in line at your table, or filling your glasses.  From what I could see, everyone around us also had great service.  This place is worth trying out, especially if you are not familiar with Argentinian cuisine.  Was it my best ever dining experience, or was the quality top notch? Well, no, but there are many things that they could teach to some top notch restaurants.  That's why they get a four-star. Maybe I'll change my rating when I return :)",0.999,0.715,0.244,0.041,0.5619488536155204

2012-07-14,2.0,"It is true, and I have to rant about this for just the first part of my review: waiting/getting reservations here is a joke. Not only do they not abide by the time you reserve- but you can't reserve unless you have a large enough party. Reservations for 8:30? Well we sat down at 9:30 -so don't make any evening plans after dinner. Just plan accordingly.  BYOB is a great option , but you will get the corking fee, which is fine and if you have a birthday - its also $1.75 a plate for any cake that you bring. Just worth noting. Pricing seems on par with what you receive. My filet was pretty fatty and not terribly delicious compared to other places in the city. Coupled with some pretty good spinach mash potatoes though. The empanadas were good but not great.  The salad was just simple greens as well; no special dressing to note. Your rolls at dinner are maybe warm, depending on the basket, and are on par with a 24 hour diner-this was probably the most disappointing.  Nothing unique that would push me to come back. I think the hype surrounding this place has gotten the best of it. I assume at one point in time this was a great place - but now it seems all the little details that make a restaurant charming are absent. The staff is not very friendly or helpful in ordering. I'm not asking for a new friend when I meet a waiter, but maybe a ""have you been here before? Might I suggest XZY"" Just a ""what do you want?"" followed with a ""What?"". Atmosphere is extremely dark- to the point I used my phone to light portions of the menu. The candlelight is nice, but seems a little out of place for the menu/staff/decor.  For a place that is so pushy on no reservations, and long lines I see all the time outside - this is most definitely not worth it to me at this point. I will probably try again, and order a different selection off the menu. If the wait and reservations wasn't such a circus, and the staff was just a little more inviting - I'd think about coming back to try again. But I can't help but feel like this is all just a way to generate hype and make it seem more exclusive and unique that what it really is. If you have some time to go here, give it a shot, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here or make special arrangements. Plenty of other nice places are close enough for a much better dining experience.",0.998,0.734,0.214,0.052,0.5449010684304801

2012-07-05,4.0,"I seriously need a new dining partner here. I've only came here with an ex, and well, ex's are ex's for a reason... I don't like to stay close to them.  I like the empanadas here. It's a lot better than other empanadas I've had in the city. We ordered a spinach one and a beef one. I liked them both. The beef one was especially juicy, and I like that a lot.  We also ordered the jamon crudo con melon, which is Prociutto served with cantaloupe. It was delicious. I never knew that Prociutto paired so well with cantaloupe before! Salty meets semi-sweet. Perfection. The first time we came here, the ex-girlfriend ordered us a huge 16 or 32 oz. T-bone steak covered in red chimichurri sauce. I'm not a big fan of steaks or of meat in general, so I thought it was way too much meat. I prefer something closer to 8 oz or less. Needless to say, I ended up boxing it up to go. So the second and last time we came here, I specifically asked her if we can split a smaller meal. We ended up ordering el filet, which was topped with a red onion wine sauce and served with spinach mashed potatoes. I loved this selection way more than the first. I also liked that it was not covered in sauce. Don't get me wrong, I like sauce... but not too much.  Tango Sur is a BYOB place. It also looks like they've expanded in the two years difference that I've visited it. They now have a waiting room in the back, but it's so dimly lit that it'd make for awkward conversations if you don't like your companion. The restaurant is best for dates... by yourselves or on double dates. I wouldn't come here with a group larger than six. You'd have a hard time hearing one another as it tends to be very loud here.

However, the steak was just ok.  We had a group of 6 and just about everyone ordered something that was highly recommended - el filet, vacio, lomo, the ribeye, etc. and the steak, while tasty, was just ok.  The vacio, which I ordered with a friend, actually came out tough.  So yeah, this place was ok but I can't say I'll be running back anytime soon.",0.9764,0.784,0.191,0.025,0.5925490196078431

2012-06-21,5.0,"This is place is MONEY.  First off, the food. Unbelievable, just as everyone says it is. Portions are massive for what you pay for, especially as it is often meat. As to everything else, just read others' reviews.  The wait can often be a deterrent, but at least when my date and I went on New Years Eve around 10pm, they took our cell phone number and we just walked down the street and enjoyed Southport until they gave us a ring (it was about an hour later). The setting is definitely a bit on the crowded side, but I feel like that's just how it's going to be. Tables are very close and it often gets pretty loud. If you want to feel like you're in a bustling city restaurant with lots going on, you will feel right at home. If you are looking for a calm and quiet dinner, I would try and go during off hours. And the BYOB is a massive plus, although we didn't take advantage of it. The New Years celebration was especially fantastic/hilarious. The waiters cracked open bottles of champagne and gave a free glass to everyone, handed out buzzers, hats, and decorations, put on some music and had a dance line go throughout the restaurant that I (and other diners) gladly hopped into.

It's like that ex gf that you just can't stop drunk dialing. Came on a Monday night at 8pm, beautiful weather so their patio was full. Host said 15-20 minutes for a table outside. Just as we thought it was our turn when we saw a table open up, he gave it to another couple. I swear we had been there longer, but I' wasn't going to complain. Just our luck, no one was leaving at that time and we ended up waiting an hour for a table. So incredibly frustrating, additionally because they had a table for 6 empty but they wouldn't seat us, a party of 2, at it.  However, you just can't argue with the food. The menu is a bit overwhelming so just go with the recs from Yelp.  Empanadas are brilliantly good. Flaky crust and oozing fillings, and very reasonably priced at $2 apiece. We got the ham and cheese and the spinach and cheese. I easily could have eaten all 5 varieties.  We wanted to get the Provoleta, Argentine provolone cheese cooked on the grill with olive oil and roasted peppers... sounds and looked amazing. Oozing when it came out to the table next to us, but after eating the entire basket of bread, there was no way we would have room. Next time, but how will I pass on the empanadas??  As usual, the el filet did not disappoint. A perfect medium rare, this range grown fillet mignon, cooked on the grill then topped with a red onion wine sauce is simply delectable. The meat almost melts in your mouth. Two big cuts of filet, one for dinner and another for tomorrow's lunch. At $27, you think this may be expensive but trust me, it's incredibly reasonable for their portion sizes. The sauce and chimachurri sauce on the side is delicious. The Bife Vesuvio, another one of their most popular dishes, was also a winner. Slightly tougher since it is only cooked to one temperature. This grilled prime steak silced and filled with spinach, mar del plata cheese and garlic in a white wine sauce is not flattering on your breath so beware if you're on a date. I recommend the filet in that instance.  I was able to bring ALL the leftovers to work with me today, so half of the el filet and half of the vesuvio. I must say, the filet holds up better overnight and is still unbelievably tender and succulent even when reheated. The Vesuvio was a little more oily but still very good as leftovers.  Great date spot that you won't have to drop a fortune to go to. The entrees seem steep at $27 apiece, but with no corkage fee at this byob spot, our bill came out to $64.  Even with the poor service (our waiter was slow and unattentive), the food speaks for itself here and will keep me coming back.",0.9951,0.78,0.153,0.067,0.5936271529888552

We went from an expected 30 minute wait to a 2 minute wait when a table miraculously opened up. Good thing; our bottles of wine did not include a screw-top and none of us had a corkscrew handy. Teeth, broken stemware, and various physics experiments were being considered to get into the juice before sitting down. The usual applies: great food. Just eat whatever you think looks appetizing and you'll be fine. Seriously, I think you'd have to try to find something truly ""bad"" on the menu. The not so usual also applies: we had two tabletop grill things delivered. One successfully landed with the skill and grace of Apollo 11. The second landed with all the grace of North Korea's last missile test, which is to say it splashed all over the table, my clothes, leg, sock, and shoe. Also the floor, but the floor feels no pain. Though the server quickly said ""sorry"", he didn't help wipe up the mess he made on the table. He didn't offer another napkin to clean up my clothes nor ask if the really-freaking-hot sauce had burned my leg. Though it did hurt like hell, multiple bottles of wine were had: our doctor-in-a-bottle performed beautifully. The food was good so I didn't mind the fact I was eating on a table swimming with spilled deliciousness.

I do believe that there were so many larger groups there that night that the turnover for a two top was just faster. Yay! We were seated outside, which I love, as the inside can be crowded and very loud. If you want to hear your date/eating partners, I'd recommend outdoors. The waiter was amazing. In fact, I wish I had gotten his name. I also love to compliment the waitstaff to the manager. Unfortunately, I just forgot.  We ordered one beef and one chicken empanada. I don't know what the green sauce is they serve with it, but it just really bumps up the flavor. We also had the melted cheese plate. What's not to love? Melty cheese, bread. yes please. For our entree we split one of the steaks for two. The one with the chimichurri. It was fantastic. My bf was a bit skeptical on getting it medium rare (he wanted medium), but both I and the waiter said it was the right way for this. Medium rare was definitely the way. And there was the fantastic green sauce again! We didn't even finish half of the steak. It was so big. We did take it home and the next morning made some steak and eggs for breakfast. Cooked up quite nicely.  For dessert, the waiter brought out a caramel flan that he gave us for my bf's birthday. Awesome I love that this place is byob. Really cuts down on the cost. For all of what we ate, it was 54 bucks. Seriously, why are you not going right now?  Anyhow, I can't wait to go back, sooner rather than later. Just be prepared to wait a bit. It is worth it.",0.9977,0.779,0.192,0.029,0.5071622144792878
2012-04-25,2.0,"Be warned this place takes forever to get seated.  No ""reservations"" are accepted. There's a guy with a list and a pen at the front with whom you check in with, and check n with, and check in with and then after  about 3 hours you might get a table. Luckily, my group of 5 actually did (after 3 hours). To be honest, I was not very impressed. Not worth the wait. Granted the night before, my group went to Ruxbin's and had a glorious experience. So I had extremely high expectations. I really tried not to, but after that long of a wait, you expect something amazing. I suppose if you were a steak lover, then you might find this place appealing, but I guess I'm not that much of a carnivore or I have really high standards for meat. This place is for the steak purist. This is a no fuss, BYOB, potato tortilla ( hint this is not a traditional tortilla), BYOB, wait for 3 hours for a hunk-a-chunka piece of red meat kind of place. I shared a rib eye with a friend along with the potato tortilla, and some empanadas and I was stuffed beyond stuffed. I definitely didn't finish my food, partly because I was full but partly because I didn't find my food very appealing. The meat was way too fatty. The potato tortilla was not what I expected. It was more like a frittata and not so much a tortilla the way I know of tortillas. The salad was very atypical of what you would expect for a salad - it was 2 large lettuce leaves, a slice of tomato and a slice of red onion with a DIY dressing of oil and red wine vinegar. I think the true test of a restaurant comes to this, would you come to this place again? To that I would answer, no. Maybe if I lived in the Chicago area, but since I don't, I'm more inclined to try other restaurants, vs. coming to this establishment again. So, my advice, go here once, if you are in the area and try it for yourself. But, come here knowing that you might have to wait an hour or more for a table, and that you shouldn't expect a fancy 5 star steakhouse.",0.9844,0.863,0.108,0.029,0.4515378510378511

2012-04-18,3.0,"After hearing so many good things about this place, I added Tango Sur to my ""most wanted to try"" restaurant list. It had been on there a while until i finally made it for dinner last night. Dinner was a ""Grub With Us"" meal with a group of six others (it was booked for a group of eight. Simple math: two people don't show up=more food for us!). The place looked great from the inside: map of Argentina on the wall, various paintings on other walls. Plus there was a ""roving"" guitarist playing various salsa and other types of Spanish music. (I think a Gypsy Kings tune was played once during the night). The waiter was very pleasant as well. Now of the food. The special menu that we had included chicken empanadas (I'm a big fan of empanadas, whether it be here or any other Spanish restaurant), spinach ravioli (yum), berejena (eggplant w/spinach, cheese, and tomato sauce), and three meat dishes(short ribs, skirt steak, and flap steak). The flan that we had for dessert was nice and creamy.  The only bad part about the experience (and the reason for the two star deduction) was the noise level. I hated screaming across the table to my dinner companions. The live music was nice, but to me it added to the noise that drowned out the conversation.  Considering that this was a weekday night, I can only imagine how weekends at this place can be. My sister went to this place on a Saturday a few months ago, and she had the same review as me: great food, but uncomfortable noise level. I'd go back for the food; but I know how the conversations during the night would turn out.",0.7998,0.869,0.084,0.047,0.5310291858678954
2012-04-15,2.0,"As we walked down the street towards Tango Sur for our Saturday Night, 7:45PM reservation for 7, we walked through a group standing in front of The Music Box at which point my pants instantly became tighter... no, not from the excitement and anticipation of eating at Tango Sur, but from the ambiance of hipsters in the area. Yes, you can get a ""contact hipster"" just by walking through a group of them. Thankfully we survived, but we should have noted the omen as we got to the restaurant.  Tango Sur only takes ""reservations"" for groups of 6 or more, we had 7, perfect. We had called almost a week prior to dining and expected to wait no more than 15-20 minutes. I'm not unrealistic, I know that even with a larger group and a reservation, you're not going to get seated right on time. However, what I was not expecting was to be told it would be 45 minutes.... which then turned into 90 minutes. But don't worry, at about the hour mark we were lead into a back ""waiting room"" which felt like an old Chinese opium den, but instead of opium it was wine and instead of toothless, chinese tweakers, it was disgruntled people waiting for tables at a mediocre restaurant. Definitely not a place a woman would want to be alone... 2 bottles of wine and 30 minutes later our shackles were finally broken and we were liberated to our table. We started by cracking 2 more bottles of wine to try and wash the opium flavor out of our mouths and then ordered chicken and beef empanadas as well as some sort of cheese plate. The beef empanadas were actually really good and brought me back into the spirit of the food. I almost just ordered 2 more plates of those for my entre, but sadly I did not and regretted it later. The waiter eventually made his way back to us and took our orders... everyone ordered El Filet. I was actually going to order something else, but the waiter successfully up-sold me to the filet-medium.  The salads came out and I was a little disappointed. As my fiance pointed out, the lettuce and tomato looked like what you would get on the side when you order a cheeseburger. Literally 3-5 pieces of lettuce flat on a plate with 2 slices of tomato on top of it; oil and vinegar are your only dressing options.  Not too long after the salads our filets came out. If I had known that each filet order was 2, 8-10 oz filets more of us would have shared, especially since mine was definitely medium rare and not medium. The medium rare steaks at the table were still breathing. The filet sat in a pool of sauce, which to me usually means they are trying to mask the flavor. The steak wasn't bad, the sauce was good and the spinach mashed potatoes were ok... needless to say I wasn't impressed with the food we waited almost 2 hours for (with a reservation).  As you can tell I was quite disappointed with Tango Sur in almost every aspect. Sure it had a nice intimate, candle-lit feel to it, but when the restaurant is louder than the bar watching the Blackhawks game that night, you lose all that intimate appeal. Mediocre food and a 90 minute wait, 30 of which was spent fearing for my life, is not the way to get me to come back.

I think it was the no reservations/long wait that kept me away for so long. But that was then, now I had a connection, and it pays to have connections at places like this....so my friend and I were celebrating her birthday and I decided to drop some names and get us seated in 20 minutes rather than the hour and a half that we were quoted. Tango Sur is every bit as dark, romantic and incredibly cramped as others have told you.  But the meat is worth it. Just thinking about the ""el filet"" makes me drool. Very juicy and tender and goes perfectly with the spinach mashed potatoes it is served with. The Argentine provolone cheese was unbelievable. The caramel flan for dessert was so good I had to restrain myself from licking the plate. I've never tasted pure caramel like that---oh so good. The only thing I was disappointed with was their famous empanadas. They were just too big, the crust was too much and too fried and the fillings were too much. Tried the trio, did not like the ones with meat in it, the plain was the best. I'd say skip the empanadas and save room for your entree, the portions are huge. Love that it is BYOB.

2012-03-29,3.0,"Warning - this is a vegetarian's review of a steak house. Took the boyfriend for his bday dinner at Tango Sur a few weeks ago.  It was top of his list of Chicago steak houses to try. I called a few weeks ahead of time, and while they don't do formal reservations for parties less than 6, they put me on the ""wait list"" which basically means you get priority to people who walk in and put their name on the list.   We made a ""reservation"" for 7:30pm, got there around 7:15pm and were seated right at 7:30pm.  While waiting, we sat in the back room, and since Tango Sur is brilliantly BYO, we cracked our first bottle of wine to enjoy a glass before being seated. The ambiance of the place is fantastic - very small with exposed brick walls.  However the other reviews were dead-on in terms of noise - the place is incredibly noisy!  Not a huge detractor, but it just doesn't really fit wtih the cozy ambiance of the place overall. For appetizers, we shared the corn and spinach empanadsas - AMAZING.  I'd go back just to order those!  The fried provolone plate was fantastic - literally just a plate of fried provolone cheese, which we devoured at an alarmingly fast rate. The meat-eater boyfriend ordered El Filet, which he deemed ""very good.""  He said it was covered in a delicious sauce, but that usually points to a lower quality cut of meat when they drench it in sauce.  His assessment was that it was excellent for the price, but fundamentally not the best steak he's ever had - more similar in food quality to the steak houses you'd see in Vegas. As a (pesca) vegetarian I ordered the salmon.  Not so wonderful.  Not bad, but just not good either.  I won't complain as I don't think most people go to Tango Sur for the fish, and I knew my meal was secondary to the birthday boy's dinner. Overall - you can't beat the price and service at Tango Sur.  With the BYO option, it's probably the best deal in town for a steak dinner.  Absolutely worth checking out... but I think we'll continue to try other local steak houses before returning.",0.9413,0.795,0.119,0.086,0.4829573934837094

I am disgusted by the by the by the way that my group (not to mention several other groups and couples) were treated by the staff of Tango Sur.  We were told that there was a 2 hr wait to get in and while I would have said forget it, my boyfriend really wanted to wait and the two others we were with had never been so ...fine... we went to a bar down the street for two hours and waited and had fun and figured ok its prob a good idea to walk back to the restaurant and see whats going on bc we didn't receive any phone call that our table was ready.  I should have known things were going to end badly when some other group asked where they were in the wait bc they had been waiting for a number of hours already and ended up leaving because the man at the door was so rude to them.  So there are two guys at the door and I don't understand how they have no communication and obviously no idea what they are doing... one guy takes the names and one guy calls them, which is sad if you are not able to perform both functions yourself,  Anyways we were told it would be another half an hour... so we waited... ahhh why does a group of 16 get to go ahead of us.... then when other people who had only waited 45 min total were let in .... finally our party, who they had written down as a party of 2 NOT 4 mind u (so the name taker can't even do his one job).... gets called....oh NO not to actually sit down and dine ... but to go in the WAITING ROOM they have inside.  The height of the night was when 4 chicks were seated who literally just arrived ... my bf asked the guy who calls the names why they were seated when they just arrived and the caller said ""go ask the guy at the door"" ,,,, seriously? Isn't it your job to take the name hes written on his 50cent mini note pad and call them in ORDER ...as the patron I am supposed to go figure out ur issues?.... so the name caller can't do his job right either.  Needless to say we left ... and as we are walking out, name taker and name caller are like ""oooo why are you leaving, your table is next"" hahahahaha I'm soooooo sure that it is.  The food is great there is no doubt, but I will never go here again because the foods not that good.... my boyfriend can make the same if not better chimichurri sauce and can grill a steak awesomely ... so screw you Tango Sur.",-0.2869,0.891,0.05,0.059,0.5018408289241623

Normally I'd go someplace else since as a personal rule, I don't wait 2 hours for any kind of food; but the couple we were with hadn't been here before and I raved about the place so we decided to put our names down. We went down the street and had appetizers and drinks then came back two hours later ... only to find out that we need to wait longer. Half an hour later we are ushered inside - not to sit, mind you but to wait in the ""waiting room."" The waiting room basically looks like an antechamber to a David Lynch crackhouse or whorehouse ... dim, bleak and dungeonesque. Another half hour later we are still waiting and looking around while groups of 4 that just walked in are being seated. So after a 3 hour wait, I swear at the seating attendant, I swear at the ""host"" and walk out. We ended up going down to street to Sushi Mura which was fantastic - as usual. TL;DR version: food & BYOB good but not 3 hours wait good. Service & hospitality is awful.

I have eaten at Tango Sur several times during my two years of eating at restaurants other than McDonald's.  Tango Sur is one of the best places I have ever eaten at in Chicago.  First of all, it is a BYOB place and they do not have a corking fee.  Since this is an Agentinian meat joint, you must have a red wine with you.  They will provide the bucket of ice.  They have a great selection of food, but you have to have the empanadas as an appetizer ($2 each).  Get one of each and if they don't have the corn empanadas, then ask for one of those too.  They are the best.  I almost always order the Filet Mignon as my main dish.  It comes with two nice sized filets and spinach mashed potatoes and a salad ($30 something)... IT IS AMAZING AND COOKED PERFECT EVERY TIME!!! Yum my mouth is watering as I type and I just ate dinner... =P  There is always enough to take home for lunch or dinner the next day.  When I microwave it the next day (I know... destroyed it right), it tastes great and is so juicy still.   Only issues I would have with the place and the reason I took a star away is due to the fact they don't take reservations so you have to get there early or wait for over an hour to two hours. BUT, it is so worth.  Get there by 5pm to get in faster.  Also, the music tends to be too loud at times... BUT, it is a great date place or for special events.  If you have a group of 6 then you can make a reservation but you only get two time slots to chose from each night, so call early.

Our server, Peter, was attentive, polite, and had great recommendations for appetizers - he definitely did not steer us wrong with the empanadas (one each of the five different types), provoleta, and lengua. Most of us were full after the appetizers! Then for dinner we collectively ordered the pez (salmon), two churrascas (12-oz sirloins), the berenjena (eggplant), and the vacio relleno (not sure exactly, but some sort of flank steak with great flavor).  Everyone was impressed. I cannot wait to reheat my berenjena; it was like a vegetarian lasagna but with 10x more flavor than you would ever expect. I also had multiple bites of the vacio relleno and it had such a flavorful yet tender bite, that I was truly impressed!  Food and table service aside, I was a bit disappointed with the cramped table situation and the noise. When I saw that it was ""intimate"" on Yelp, I kind of expected a quiet and subdued place, but it was just packed, loud, and dimly lit. Just not exactly what I had pictured in my mind's eye - but that only knocks off a star. I'm saving this for the last because I don't think it's quite as important as the fact that we had a delicious meal, but the front of house service was not my favorite. I made the reservation two weeks in advance and got a confirmation call the day of; great, right? But we got there three minutes late for our reservation and only then did they tell us that they were 15-20 minutes behind with their reservations - and on top of that, there was no room to wait in the restaurant! They had my number, so why didn't they call? I'm sure a large percentage of their patrons are within walking or a 15 minute drive range, so why wouldn't they let us know beforehand? That's really my only complaint. I love the fact that it's byob (I'm new to this whole byob-in-chicago thing) and we saved a ton of money but still had a great meal.

The veggies were nothing special, and I could have done a better job with the presentation. After waiting another 20 minutes, my entree was served.

I called every night the week of the party to ask about birthday cake ($1.75 charge per person if you bring your own cake), valet parking (none available) and lots of other random questions that arise when you plan a party for 18 people.  Yet, they managed to ""give away"" my reservation. The doormen (yes, there was more than just one guy working the door) were total jerks and lied about having called my cell phone to confirm the reservations. I called EVERY night that week - why would they even need to confirm?! The doormen were totally emotionless and didn't care that they were potentially ruining my birthday. They said that they could get us in 45 minutes later. Nearly TWO HOURS LATER was when they called us with a table. At that point, we had already gone to MACHU PICCHU on IRVING PARK and ASHLAND and were having a great time.  Bottom Line: go to Tango Sur if JERKS are your thing. Go to Machu Picchu if FUN TIMES and GOOD FOOD are more your style. :)",0.9543,0.819,0.125,0.055,0.5573529411764707

The process of getting seated is a joke.  The doormen give the runaround about reservation rules, act like they've lost your reservation, then tell you you have to wait 40 minutes, then magically find a table.  I get that they can do this because everyone knows that it's BYOB (and you can crack your bottle of wine in the waiting room), combined with the deliciousness of the food makes it worth the wait.  Thing is, there are lots of great places to eat in the city where there won't be wishy-washy business to get seated, so I won't being going back to Tango Sur as often as my taste buds would like.",0.9947,0.752,0.235,0.013,0.526875

I love sweetbreads, so it's a personal treat that they include this with all the other meat. The short ribs, flap meat, and sausage are all really good too. Dont remember what we had for dessert, but  I think they change it up infrequently. It's going to be difficult going back and not ordering the same thing.

We were heading to a early concert and I called at 5pm to see if there was a table available for 4 and to say we'd be there within 20 minutes. The gentleman who answered the phone was very nice (per usual) and said we would have no problem at all, yet he didn't take my name or anything.  We got there and while one of us parked the car, the rest of us came in and said we had just called. The gentleman said as soon as our 4th diner came in, we'd be seated right away. 5 to 10 mins later, all 4 of us are accounted for and head over to the host to get our table. He then tells us that there are no tables available and the wait is now an hour.  For a landmark neighborhood restaurant in Lakeview who's customer loyalty far exceeds any other's, we were extremely disappointed to be treated that way. While I understand that they don't take reservations for more than 6 people (which doesn't quite make sense anyway), the entire restaurant was pretty much empty with tables for 10-12 set up. While I understand that they do cater to large parties, dismissing a group of four, who has dined at the restaurant 20+ times, is just bad business and bad customer service.

Our waiter was there the moment we walked in to uncork our bottle of wine (No corkage fee). Nice plus! He came back right away to take our order and within minutes our salad was in front of us. About ten minutes after we finished, our food arrived; my wife had the EL FILET range grown fillet mignon, cooked on the grill then topped with a red onion wine sauce and served with spinach mashed potatoes. I had the T. BONE, range grown veal t. bone cooked on the grill, served with mashed potatoes and red chimichurri. We tried both and could not stop smiling at each other. Both were perfectly cooked and totally satisfying. Our waiter (Ever Rios) was always smiling and asked every few minutes if we needed anything, which is always nice, very attentive and friendly. A total thumbs up and will return monthly! Not only is the place affordable and serve amazing, unbelievable, good food, but also it's a BYOB.

She said something to the waiter and he basically said that he told her so. He told her it was going to have to be cooked more well than rare. I think he should have asked her if he could get her something else instead or offer to put in another order of the same thing.

This review is based on a single Tango Sur's employee that I came into contact with during my five minutes at the restaurant.  Though it may seem unfair for me to even write this (since I didn't even eat at this place), maybe the management will think twice about who they have working here after reading this.  I had been looking forward to eating here for quite sometime now and am somewhat disappointed that I will never experience Tango Sur's food due to the experience I had tonight.   My boyfriend and I decided to try this place out and even though today is Tuesday, I tried to call to see if I could make a reservation because the place always seems busy and it is holiday season after all.  I tried the number several times but each time I got sent directly to voicemail.  We decided to give it a shot anyways.  While my date looked for parking I went ahead in to see if I could get a table.  The host stand was not by the door but oddly placed in back of the restaurant.  I walked towards the back of the room and got stopped by a man telling me I needed to wait outside. OK...  I went back out and waited with another gentleman that seemed to also be waiting.  The man from the restaurant came out.  The gentleman asked for a table for 7 at which time the man from the restaurant informed him that it would be at least an hour and that he should have called since they make reservations for parties 6+.  I then asked about the wait for a party of 2. He told me it would be at least an hour and that he could take my number down and give me a call when something opened up.  I stepped away to call my bf to pick me up since the wait was so long while 2 girls came up and asked for a table.  The man said 20 minutes. 20 minutes!? I went back up to him and asked why the wait was all of a sudden so much shorter and he said they had called ahead and made reservations.  (Even though he had just said they only take reservations for parties of 6+.) I shared with him that I tried calling several times and couldn't get through.  He then said I was a LIAR and asked me to TAKE OUT MY PHONE, SHOW HIM MY CALL LOG and PROVE to him that I tried calling.  WT??!?!  It was completely unprofessional and uncalled for.  I'm absolutely disgusted with how I was treated and will not attempt to eat at this restaurant ever again.",-0.8562,0.904,0.043,0.053,0.3771269841269842
2011-12-20,2.0,"Wife was jonesing for steak. Reviews here seemed to warrant a visit. In a word: eh. We started with a selection of empanadas. The pastries were overcooked, and the fillings too paltry to compete with the overwhelming crusts, cooked to too dark a brown. The chimichurri, served with every dish we ordered, had so much raw garlic that nothing else in it was discernible, and further made the fillings just so much hot, flavorless goo. Next was the house salad, which came with the meal. I fair iceberg lettuce salad. Whatever. The steaks, ordered medium rare, were cooked perfectly. No complaints there. I had skirt, wife had flank - which they peculiarly call ""flap"" on the menu, though luckily the waiter called it what it really is - flank (flap is a totally different cut: a thin, low sirloin. This steak was 3"" thick, and clearly a flank.)  One bite of the chimichurri (which I pile on when prepared well) wiped out tastebuds for a number of bites. It actually burnt my mouth - and I like garlic. Mushy boiled then baked potatoes (the only side) were likewise slathered in garlic and too much salt. Relentless! Place was ridiculously dark - I appreciate low lighting, but this was like a dungeon. Luckily we arrived early and got a good table by the window, but by the time we left, a line stretched out into the cold night. Service was passable, but you can tell they basically just turn and burn. Prices were moderate ($20-25 per entreee) - would be hard to beat even cooking at home.

However. Pretty much the ONLY reason to wait more than two hours for a meal is if you are in a refugee camp.  I'm convinced that people are so enthusiastic about this place because they are suffering from Stockholm Syndrome. After hours of waiting -- hungry, cold -- at the mercy of the snoot-tastic maître de, one surely begins to ""express empathy and have positive feelings towards their captors, sometimes to the point of defending them.""  I couldn't have said it better myself, Wikipedia. And it's cheap, you say? Well, we put down about $50 for appetizers at Deelice and went through 5 bottles of wine, a few pints of beer, and some whiskey during our three hour wait. (Which was spent at a number of bars up and down Southport, because naturally there was no room at Lame-o Sur itself.) How much did YOU spend during YOUR wait??

So, we get through dinner and we're ready to go.  i asked our server who the manager was and he tells me its some guy with a pony tail?  What?  So, I find pony tail and tell him the situation and wanted an apology.  While he's half listening to me he offers a card and if I come in again, he'll take care of me.  I don't want that!  I want host guy to apologize.  So, pony tail goes over to host guy and they talk.  Pony tail tells me that he is not going to apologize.  I said, so this is how you treat your customers and you support his poor hosting abilities?  I was steamed.  I may be overreacting just a little but I do know that I will not be going back and I WILL get an apology because I will not put up with poor behavior and be dismissed as if I was a bum off the street.   Food was good.  Dessert was dry.",0.8877,0.815,0.101,0.083,0.4119791666666666

Truly a magical experience.  Vacio - Dios mio!  Very romantic vibe - not that I care one way or another.  Make reservations cause the place gets packed.   One thing that I might add as a warning is:  The steaks and empanadas were simply heavenly but don't go in there thinking ""Oh hmmm I've decided to be NUTRITIONALLY CONSCIOUS all of a sudden.""  A man I was sitting nearby at another table was griping about how it wasn't as lean as he wanted it.  We were both eating the Vacio.  The Vacio was my best friend in that moment and I felt defensive.  I wanted to tell him:  dude you're at a steakhouse where the steaks are dripping in oil.  If you want lean eat chicken or turkey alone at home.  You know what you signed up for. This place is very reasonably priced in my opinion considering the portions of food provided.  I'm sure this restaurant can't exactly afford to hire butchers or nutritionalists to wait your table and give you the actual lean ratio or the amount of fat that is going to be in the steak your eating.  They're hiring people of Hispanic heritage (probably Mexican) and that's the prerequisite.  If you ask your waiter ""what is the leanest you have?""  He'll tell you.  He isn't going to give you lab analysis.  He's a waiter who is clearly not a master of the english language let alone the cows origins and exercise regiment.  He's supposed to know what tastes good and he does that very well.   Bottom line:  If you want great steak and empanadas with a great atmosphere and par service eat at Tango Sur.  Wasn't pricey either.

2011-11-24,1.0,"Last night was my first visit to Tango Sur...and it will also be my last.  Over the years I had heard great things about this place and I was really excited to check it out, but I was completely disappointed in the entire experience.   Dinner was at 8pm for 4 people and right from the beginning things got off to a rocky start.  3 out of the 4 of us were in the entrance way ""checking in"" while my sister paid for the cab and we were quite rudely pushed outside by the doorman who told us that we would have to wait outside until our full party arrived.  And yes, we had told him that she was 15 feet away paying for the cab.  So there we stood outside on a cold night waiting to be let in to what now seemed more like an exclusive club and not a BYOB restaurant.  In the meantime, another party of two arrived and the ""doorman"" allowed them to wait in the heated entrance way.  That put me off immediately.   After 5/6 minutes of waiting outside the doorman came out and welcomed us back to the ""waiting room"" where we would sit for the next 15 minutes.  So now it's about 8:20pm and we are still sitting in this small back cramped ""waiting room"" without any idea of when we'll be seated.  Next we were sat down at a very cramped table with one small candle.  Nice touch, but in the darkness you couldn't even see the menus.  A look around the room and more than one table was passing around their smart phones to give extra light for their menu reading efforts.  No introduction to the menu was made by our waiter, no description of the special Argentinian steaks was offered and we were left sitting there.  After a few minutes our waiter came back and offered to open the 2 bottles of wine we brought.  My brother ordered a Coke that wouldn't come for a half an hour.  And then the waiter disappeared again.   When the waiter returned we asked for suggestions about appetizers and he halfheartedly gave us confirmation that the two we had initially chosen would indeed be good options.  Thanks.  We had the fried provolone and the empanadas (beef, spinach, and ham) and both actually were great.  We ate the appetizers, but all throughout busboys kept coming by trying to clean our not-yet-finished plates.  ""Yes, I am still working on this not even half-eaten appetizer plate thank you."" Now it was time to order dinner...and we had some questions.  There are a few different kinds of steaks on the menu so we wanted to know what was the difference between them.  Our waiter immediately took a rude/snobby attitude with us and he sure didn't have any interest in wasting his time answering our questions.  2 of us initially ordered ""domestic"" meat and 2 of us ordered ""Argentinian"" meat.  Specifically domestic sirloin, Argentinian filet, Argentinian meat griddle medley, and domestic filet.  Immediately the waiter began to say how the domestic meat was not good at all and both of my dining partners should change their orders to the Argentinian sirloin and filet respectively.  My brother caved and switched to the Argentinian sirloin, but my girlfriend stuck with the domestic filet.  Even after she refused to switch the first time, the waiter tried again to tell her that the domestic meat was not that good and coerce her to change.  I'm being completely serious.  It was a bit ridiculous.   So dinner came and we started eating and of course we now wanted to see what the difference was with the steaks.  While I can admit that myself and the rest of my dining party don't have professional eaters' palettes, I can still tell if a steak is good or not and if it tastes similar to another.  Sure enough, there was no grand difference in the taste between the domestic and Argentinian filets - the only thing different was the price tag.  What a shame.  Additionally, all the meats had been doused in sauces and in my mind the meat's original flavor was truly covered up.  Totally disappointing.   The night wrapped up without anymore issues, but all in all I can honestly say that it was a really disappointing evening.  The waitstaff was rude and the doorman was also rude.  The food wasn't anything to write home about and the table was too dimly lit and extremely cramped.  Absolutely not worth the hype.",0.9863,0.809,0.114,0.076,0.41700000000000015

We have sampled much of the menu.  We have never had a bad meal.  The filet, the ribeye, the marinated eggplant and the grilled provolone plate are some of our favorites.  Our unquestioned number one is the filet for two.  For around $30 an enormous filet is presented on a table-top grill.  A portobella mushroom wine/garlic (I think) sauce is bubbling around the outside of the steak.  It is big enough to feed two and enjoy leftovers the next day.  As if that weren't enough, a small house salad is included beforehand.   The service is always at the top of their game.  We've never waited too long for anything.  The wait staff is always polite and prompt.  They do everything that they can to make their guests satisfied.  Since there isn't ever liquor on the bill (being a BYOB joint), I think it's important to remember to tip accordingly.  They deserve it. There is almost always a wait for a table.  Give the gentleman at the door your name and number and he will call you when your table is ready.  Go a few blocks West to a great Irish pub for a beer while you wait or a couple blocks South to a number of other bars (namely a cajun place with a big red sign).

The place is pretty cramped in that tables are just far too close to one another. The empanadas were amazing, especially the spinach one.

2011-10-28,4.0,"I made my husband take me here last weekend on a Sunday night since we were going to see his friend's band play at the Elbo Room and its pretty close (not walking distance mind you, but only a short 5 minute drive).  We got there around 7:45pm and were concerned about finding parking in the area. There is no parking lots in the area so you're left to find street parking in the surrounding neighborhood. Fortunately, we found something at the next block.  We put our name in and the host informed us it would be a 30 minute wait. We could leave a cell phone with him and he'd call us or we could wait on the bench outside. Since it was fairly nice outside, we chose to wait. 30 minutes wait doesn't really seem so bad considering stories of people having to wait to 2 hours to get in.  Beware if you are a ""party of 2"". This is a very popular date place and there are lots of ""party of 2's"" Since this place is very small, they do not have very many tables for just 2 people so you will have to wait for a table of 4 to open up. And they do not take reservations for any party under 6 so keep than in mind as well. You will most likely have at least 3 or more ""party of 2's"" waiting ahead of you. Be prepared for Tango Sur first timers to pull the old ""but I'm leaving for Iraq tomorrow"", ""its my girlfriend's birthday today"", ""we are celebrating an anniversary"", ""we called earlier and were told we could get in right away"" type of utter BS that people pull to get the host to bump them up in the queue.  We were seated at around 8:45 pm and by this time were really starving. It would really be nice if the restaurant perhaps offered bread or even chips to patrons waiting. It certainly  would not cost them a whole bunch and might soften the blow of having to wait so long.  Our server gave me a visual hello to let me know he saw us sit down but it seemed like a good 10 minutes passed before someone came over to cork our bottle of wine and get our order. We were sat at a table meant for 4 people dead center in the middle of the dining room. Tables are spaced very very close together. You really feel like you are on top of everyone. Since this place is so popular, I'm sure they want to squeeze as many tables in as they can, but honestly, they could do with removing some of the tables and just having people suck it up and wait longer.  As others have mentioned, there is no cork fee so bring yer own. Be forewarned though that they do not leave the cork with you so if you are not planned to drink it all, you might not be able to take your remaining wine with you when you leave. I drank all but a half glass so I have no idea if I could have taken the remaining bottle or not. Bring your own cork or wine stopper with you if you foresee this happening.  As to the ambience of the place, its very nice but with that many people in tight quarters, it can get a bit loud. The music is played at a reasonable level and the tables are all candle lit and the lights are down fairly low. I guess if you like that sort of thing, but honestly, I would rather see my food a bit better. I'm a bit of a picky eater, see, and I'd like to see what's on my plate a bit better.  The bread was pretty standard. The butter at the table, to my chagrin, was not whipped butter but just regular butter packets that they bought in bulk. The problem with this is the butter packets tend to be a little hard and not easy to spread. But seeing as they were sat close to the candle, they were a bit softer. Still, nice whipped butter would bring it up a bit.  My husband and I got the Provoleta appetizer which was delicious but definately a lot of cheese to eat for 2 people especially if you are also eating bread, drinking wine and having salads and your entree.  It took quite a long time to receive our salads, which was questionable considering its really nothing more than some leaf lettuce, tomato slices and some red onion with oil on a plate. Not really a ""salad"" in my book. I ended up giving the husband the majority of what was on my plate.  My husband ordered the Pez which was fish and potatos. And I ordered the Vacio which was flat steak and potatos. The Vacio comes with sweet potatos but if you prefer mashed, they will get that for you instead. The Vacio is meant for 2 people but since I like my meat and want left overs (which was enough for 2 more meals). The serving of meat was huge; definately much more than 2 peoples worth (unless those 2 people are really big eaters). Three people could easily have enough of meat but the potato portions might be slim. It was blood red rare just as I like it. Chimichurri sauce was abundant and I ordered extra to take with me.  Our total plus tip was around $90, which is pretty steep. But I got 2 more meals out of it so its not that bad. Go here for the food, but suggest going on a week night to save yourself the wait.",0.9974,0.811,0.131,0.058,0.5187338485690135

2011-10-25,1.0,"I am writing this review on the service ONLY. This is my first yelp review, and I wish it could be under happier circumstances.  My girlfriend and I, having moved to the Southport Corridor area a few months ago, have been excited to try out Tango Sur for a long time, and finally decided to indulge for a nice date Saturday night. I had read reviews and new to expect a long wait. We got there at 8:30, gave our names, and were told it could be up to an hour and half. No problem, we just went to a bar down the street, had a few drinks, stopped at Jewel for a bottle of wine to have with dinner, and then wandered back to Tango Sur at 10:00 to wait to be called. After 10:15 rolled by, my girlfriend decided to ask the host how many people were in front of us, just to get an idea. The host couldn't find our names until he pulled a list out of a cabinet, after which he assured us there were only four tables in front of us. At this point it seemed like we had been forgotten, but it didn't really matter. Like I said we were expecting a decent wait. Maybe ten minutes later we were led back to the waiting room where we could open our bottle of wine while we were on deck for a table. After that point, we watched seven (count em, seven) tables get called. The clock was getting awfully close to 11:00. Finally, we asked the host once again where we were on his list. He pulled out the list, found his spot, and then flipped back through three pages of names to find our name way higher on the list. At this point, we had clearly been forgotten about again, but he assured us we were next. However, merely five minutes later, he comes back into the room, and calls another name. Before he could leave the room, I quickly (yet politely) asked why we weren't next, and he quickly changed the name and said ""oh right, you guys are up."" Here's where it gets really good. I was slightly frustrated at this point (it was now 11:15, a full two hours and 45 minutes after their 1 1/2 hour TOPS quote) but just kind of wanted to make a point, so I asked him if he had forgotten about us or something. To which he replied ""whatever"" turned around and walked away.  Needless to say, both my girlfriend and I were both pretty upset with this treatment. However, after we sat down, we decided to let it go, and enjoy the night, rather than taking it out on our servers (we have both worked at restaurants and know how it goes) over one employee with an attitude. Unfortunately, things kept going downhill. We ordered two empanadas, on recommendation from the waiter, and were brought the entirely wrong selections. At this point, we felt we had to say something, and asked to speak to a manager.  Lo and behold, the unruly host approaches our table. I started to explain the situation before I realized in the dim lighting that it was the same person I was complaining about, at which point I asked again to speak to a manager, and here's the biggest thing...he WAS the manager!! I was shocked, and told him so, that a MANAGER at a reputable place like Tango Sur, could look at a guest, after skipping him and forgetting him for over two and half hours (which he admitted to) and say ""Whatever,"" and walk away (which he also admitted to doing). He apologized once or twice, and then just started to walk away, nothing done! I had to call him back to ask if he was going to do anything to fix it, at which point he told us he ""guessed he could get us some complimentary desserts after the meal."" Fine. We just wanted to have a nice date, so we said OK, and ate our meal (which was delicious, but besides the point). Finally, the waiter came to clear our plates and we told him the manager had said we could enjoy some complimentary desserts. The waiter said OK, but instead of returning with a menu, came back with one piece of flan. And our bill. Regardless of the fact that my girlfriend doesn't even like flan, I think this is well beyond an unacceptable way to make up for the MANAGER of a restaurant treating us like that (a dessert each of our own choice would have been the BARE MINIMUM, in my eyes). Knowing I wouldn't get any farther with that manager, we left, angry and disappointed. I have been trying to get in touch with a general manager or owner since then in order to better resolve this, and my phone calls and e-mails have all gone unanswered. I will keep trying to contact someone in hopes that this will be made right, as the food was delicious and I am dying to love this restaurant, but right now my blood boils every time I think of the place.",0.9968,0.825,0.122,0.053,0.4960885765680287

The ambiance is very romantic - all candle lit with dark walls, nice decor, and close-together tables.  I like that the music stays with the latin theme and isn't too loud - great for dates.

2011-10-10,1.0,"After hearing multiple people rave about this restaurant and reading the amazing reviews about Tango Sur, I was dying to get there and see for myself.  Two words capture my experience: EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED.   Luckily, I was there at 6:00 pm on a Sunday and was seated right away.  The waiter immediately seemed quite confused.  He kept stopping by the table and promising to open my wine, bring glasses, etc., but didn't.  It took him probably 15 minutes to open my wine and bring two glasses.  Even the host/manager stopped by and promised glasses, but didn't deliver.  By the time he was ready to take our order, I had already consumed an entire mini loaf of bread and had scoured the huge menu thoroughly.  The bread was delicious-- probably the best part of the meal. Upon reviewers' suggestions, I tried both the spinach and the corn empanadas.  They were good, but not great. The 5411 Empanada food truck makes Tango Sur's taste like a hot pocket.   45 minutes after ordering, our meal finally arrives.  My guest and I split the El Filet and the ribeye.  On the plus side, the spinach mashed potatoes were pretty good.  The plain mashed potatoes were ok--they tasted like a huge lump of butter with a potato in it.  The steaks?  AWFUL.  Both of them were so full of gristle that they were nearly impossible to eat.  The meat quality was terrible, more like grade C or D.  I could have purchased a better quality steak at Aldi for an eighth of the price.  The wonderful beef flavor was missing--all of the flavor came from the sauce they covered it in.  I picked around at my steak, trying desperately to cut out the fat and finally gave up.   We had to ask for the check twice, and thankfully could pay in cash.  I see why there is always such a wait--dinner for two took nearly two hours, most of it sitting and waiting. I'm not sure why everyone thinks this place is so cheap--maybe because the bill is missing the huge alcohol portion?  The steaks were $25-$35.  For a few bucks more, you could have a melt-in-your-mouth, non-gristly ribeye at Shula's.  And they take reservations.  Sorry Tango Sur, I was excited to add another delicious and fun restaurant to my list of favorite restaurants, but sadly, you are neither.  I will not be patronizing your restaurant again.",0.9918,0.746,0.168,0.086,0.6875573192239859

They don't take reservations for parties of 6 or less, but they will take your phone number and you can grab a drink down the street while you wait (yes, I have waited up to 2 hours for a table!) You just have to go early, like before 6, if you don't want to wait.

2011-10-08,1.0,"What a disappointment.  We wanted to love this place, but from start to finish, it just didn't live up to the hype.   Our first concern came when my partner put our name in while I parked the car.  We were told 20-30 minutes; however, if we wanted an outside table it ""could be 2 hours or more"".  Really?  And who is going to fill those tables?  No one had arrived yet, and when I called to get a reservation earlier in the evening, he said it was ""first come first serve"".  So, what's the story?  So...we stand outside for 15 minutes or so with no one around and then all of a sudden a man and woman come up to the host and say ""two"".  He says ""inside or out?"" and then ushers them to a prime table right outside.  Are you kidding me?!  So, I approach him and say, ""excuse me, but we have been waiting and these people were just seated in front of us"".  He interrupts me to say, ""they came an hour ago"".  You gotta be kidding me.  Not a minute after, he says to us, ""this way"", and proceeds to usher us to this table at the end of the outdoor area in front of a 7-eleven type store that lights up the tables in this area in a trashy sort of way.  So much for a romantic outside table.   So, we think...we're out of the woods.  Not so.  We sit for another 10 minutes, watching everyone around us who comes after us get served before our waiter finally comes up after 15 minutes.  That would be the 1st of 4 times the entire 2 1/2 hour meal that we see him.  So, we order...and wait. 20 minutes later, our appetizer arrives. The empanadas were decent, although nothing amazing.  The salad arrives 20 minutes later (consisting of plain salad with two tomatoes and two onions on top - vinegar and oil containers, should you want dressing).  So, we finish this and wait.  And wait.  And wait.  And wait some more.  After about an hour (and one trip by him to say, ""food should be here shortly""), our food arrives.  The steaks/grill, although it did have some flavor, was WAY overcooked on the grill, and the meat, as a whole, was extremely grizzly and hard to chew.  What a disappointment.  For a place that specializes in steaks, this place was a huge let-down.   After sitting another 45 minutes with no return of our waiter, I finally had to go find him inside the restaurant to let him know we were ready to leave.  What a joke.   While the prices weren't terrible for a steakhouse, what difference does it make when the food is disappointing and the service is terrible?  We won't be returning to this place.  If you decide to try this place (as we had been excited to do), be warned.  You're unlikely to have this raving experience people have been reporting on here (and I really wanted to like this place and the atmosphere - however, there are plenty of other places that can live up to the hype).  My advice, avoid this pretentious place and eat at one of the other restaurants along this strip.  You will never miss it.",-0.3119,0.867,0.07,0.063,0.475026455026455

This place is not stuffy or pretentious at all. The ambiance was so perfect- Steamy! I always pick where we go for dinner, but this time I decided to fall back and let my date pick...We did have a reservation, but still hd to wait 15 minutes o_O. The place as jam packed! To me that's a good sign of GOOD food!  On the night I went it was raining outside, there was someone playing a Spanish guitar- playing amazing music- dinner was by candlelight...We sat right in the window- watching the rain fall, giggling from all the wine we injested and becoming hypnotized by the rifts escaping from the Spanish guitar.  The food was so good! I had steak stuffed with cheese and spinach- with halves of sliced potato's... sooooooo good... Don't recall what my date had- we sampled some sort of tuna appetizer- the bread was too hard, but other than that it was good. There was a birthday dinner going on- there were seriously 20 or more people at this one long table on the side together- they were BEYOND loud, drunk, and obnoxious! I was having such a good time with my date- I didn't even mind! We started whooping it up with them too! I usually don't hit many $$ price point spots for dinner dates- but this place, that my date picked out was the exception! I had a ball- I'm def going back- hopefully on another rainy night!

The chimichurri sauce that comes with everything is a perfect complement. Also, it's BYOB, which is always an amazing perk.  Service is not the fastest, but the place is small and constantly swamped.

My BF is more of a meat eater than I am so I thought he would love this place (if we ever got in).  So we walked over to Tango Sur and gave our name to the Host at about 8:30 pm on a Friday , he says it will be about 1 hour and 15 mniute wait and he takes my BF's cell number and says he will call him when the table is ready.  Well, an hour later we are still waiting and he tells my BF it will be another 30 minutes.  We walk down the street and wander into the cupcake shop to ""browse"" and check out the showings at the Music Box.  Thirty minutes later, still No call.  My boyfriend suggests I go and talk to him in Spanish.  Sure enough, the Spanish card gets us in.  He immediately calls someone out who takes us to a small table by the wall. Now this is a Hot summer Chicago night and there is absolutely no breeze in here.  The bus boys are zooming around filling glasses with ice cold water. The waiter takes a while to come by but when he does I use my Spanish again to get some quicker service. He quickly gets us a bucket of ice for our now warm wine.  This place is packed!  We order two empanadas, a corn one and a spinach/cheese empanada and tell the waiter we would like to put our order in for the entrees.  Both served with chimichurri sauce.  My BF is a fan.  I order the churrasco (sirloin steak) from the specials menu, 3/4 done.  My BF orders the Beef steak medium rare.  I loved my steak, I'm not a huge meat eater but was in the mood for some meat.  Delicious!  After we had had our fill I asked the waiter for some doggie bags and he was quick about it. It just took one glance to get him to our table with the check.  I read other yelper's reviews and waiting for the check and other service seem to go very slow.  I suggest learn some basic Spanish, this might help.  Anyway, I love you Tango Sur but because of the long wait and extreme heat and the loud noise inside I think this is more for the young and inexperienced diner.  It's a great place, very romantic but I'm going to try El Nandu after 10 years and see what they are up to.",0.9932,0.854,0.119,0.026,0.5380694444444444

I'd try Tango Sur again, but I'm definitely not letting my boyfriend order for the both of us again without me looking at the menu and I will DEFINITELY try the empanadas.  I feel like I did it all wrong by not bringing wine, ordering food that I don't like anyway, and not getting what they're known for, but I also feel like if I have to have that much inside knowledge to enjoy a restaurant, meh.  I wouldn't miss it.",0.9904,0.649,0.223,0.128,0.5607383357383359

The problem was the whole package, including the food. Ambiance was lackluster. Closely packed together, noisy, and dimly lit (few candles on the table).

We had to wait for over 45 minutes on the sidewalk, and it wasn't even worth the wait.  We started off with the 'provoleta' which is the melted cheese with roasted peppers. It was so oily and chewy, we didn't even finish half of it amongst the three of us. We also started off with the 'berenjena', which was the chefs special, and that was kind of an eggplant lasagna in a yummy tomato sauce, which was definitely the best of the night.  For entrees, my husband ordered the parrillada for one, which consisted of your own mini grill, served with grilled short ribs, sausage, beef sweetbread and black sausage. The meat was charred, overly cooked, and tasted like it had been ready for hours. I ordered the 'pechuga de pollo' a chicken breast served with vegetables and this oregany sauce on the side. The chicken was dry and did not have much flavor. My mother ordered a steak that was completely rare in the middle and we had to send it back to get cooked more. Each entree came with a salad, but I wouldn't go as far to even call it that - a small plate of shredded lettuce with slices of onion and tomatoes, and no dressing.

On to Entrees... My lady and I split the Vacio.  It is flap meat (flank steak i think) seasoned with their chimmiscurri sauce, and served on a miniature grill for two. O-M-GOD was it divine. We also replaced the sweet potatoes with the traditional mashed. The other couple got the Rejellanos... also served for two, it's filet mignon served with mushrooms in a ham sauce.  I'm not normally a mushroom fan, but in this dish, the mushrooms tasted like meat.  Unreal.

We asked the server for his opinion on an appetizer, and he told us to get this awesome melty cheese, roasted pepper dish, which went really good with their house bread.  We slammed the whole dish quickly, and we then asked his opinion on the main course, and he quickly said to get the fillet from argentina, for two.  This beast of a steak came out on a sizzling platter covered in an awesome brown reduction with mushrooms.  It was pure awesome.  Me and my boo ate the entire thing, and it was perfect.  The meat was ultra tender, and not the slightest imperfection in the quality. No stringiness, no gristle, and no tough spots.  It was awesome.  I went home and slept for 12 hours to process that behemoth meal.  It was a surprisingly awesome meal at a great price.",0.9975,0.655,0.281,0.064,0.6890000000000001

Mood: 5/5 -- With an dimly, candle-lit interior, the place feels like a different world altogether.  As the Spanish guitarist strums sad melodies, it is impossible not to get lost in the enigmatic charm of the far South. Food: 4/5 -- Giant steaks and meat of all colors. Delicate sweetbreads.  Chimmichurri sauce that tastes as if the recipe is 100 years old.  The food is incredible, and cheap. BYOB makes the price unbeatable. Service: 3/5 -- Typical Argentine service.  Slow, not terribly helpful, but nothing to complain about.  Professional.

It's BYOB - BONUS!  I love byob's! They start you off with warm bread that has a bit of a garlic taste - I liked it quite a bit. The salad I think they just shouldn't bother. It's a few leafy greens, a slice of onion, a slice of tomato, and no dressing. The main part which receives rave reviews is the meat. We ordered the filet for two and it was huge!  You definitely get your money's worth.  The mushrooms served with it were to die for.  BUT, it was marinated in a tomato base of some sort and while the meat was delish, it did seem a bit oily at the same time. I had to end the dinner with dessert which was a slice of carrot cake for me - I've definitely had better in that department. All in all, you definitely get your bang for your buck - portions are large which means you can share and it is BYOB so a steak dinner can be pretty reasonably priced.

We started with the empanadas - one beef, one chicken, and one corn.  The beef, although a bit greasy, was very good.  The chicken lacked really any flavor.  The corn was good, but I wish it had a bit more flavor - the corn seemed a bit muted.   Then came the salad - a total throwaway.  Why even bother?  The bread they served with it was good enough, although it was pretty run of the mill (and I hate when butter is served in packets). Entrees - I ordered the El Filet and she ordered some sort of seafood salad (with calamari, octopus, and mussels).  She was not impressed - don't get me wrong - it was a ton of seafood for $10, but it was pretty one-dimensional.  My steak was great, although whoever butchers their meat needs more practice - these things looked like they'd been hacked with a, well, hacksaw.  Cooked perfectly, however, and very flavorful.  Enough steak to feed two, for sure, so the $25 price tag was pretty astonishing.  The side (spinach mashed potatoes) was another throwaway - watery, lifeless and lacking any seasoning whatsoever, was a bit disappointing. We finished with a caramel cheesecake, which surprised both my wife and me in being very good.  Another steal at $5 for a relatively large piece of cheesecake. Aside from the food, we weren't impressed.  It was a hot day outside, and you could tell that inside - warm and muggy.  The waiters were still setting tables 30 minutes after they opened and not doing it quietly.  The candle on our table didn't fit in the candleholder, so it tilted ever so dauntingly, threatening to fall into our food or into our glasses of wine - we blew it out and moved it to the side (a good move, might I add, as there was little to no room on our table for our food, much less a candleholder).  Service was brash and surly.

So when I called up a few friends in Chicago that went to Argentina with me, I suggested we do a mini-Mendoza reunion and find an Argentine restaurant to do it at.  They both had one place in mind: Tango Sur. I gave them fair warning that living in Columbus, I had not had a decent empanada since we got back from Argentina.  Ruben's in SoHo NYC has great empanadas, but they are baked and don't have that same flavor and texture as fried Argentine empanadas.  We ordered four at Tango Sur.  Felt and tasted like home. I also gave them fair warning that I had every intention of ordering way too much and having leftovers.  I was not lying.  For the table, we ordered the four empanadas, their cheese and tomato dip, and under the parillada section, the para una.  The para una is a table top grill that has chorizo, sweet breads, two cuts of steak and a very impressive serving of morcilla (blood sausage.)   In addition to this, one person ordered the veal asado, another ordered the flank steak, the third ordered a chicken dish and I ordered the milanesa ternera (veal milanesa.)  Everything was delicious.  The only thing that disappointed me about the milanesa was that it was not smothered in the vegetable puree that my host mother always served with it.  This puree is something that I keep a batch of in the freezer at all times since it is a simple accompaniment made by simmering carrots, onions, potatoes, celery and tomatoes in water with just a little salt and water, pouring off some broth and then blending. Of course, after that meal (we all left with half of our entrees in to go boxes), they brought out the dessert tray.  What immediately caught our eyes were the mil hojas (layers of thin waffles and dulce de leche) and the pionono (vanilla cake rolled with a thick layer of dulce de leche.)  They.  Were.  Beautiful.  I could have sworn that I was back in Buenos Aires, enjoying a coffee in the Recoleta, watching the tourists try to find Evita's grave.  It was that perfect. We also ordered the mate, expecting and hoping that it would be served in the traditional cup with the silver straw.  Mate is a wonderfully communal drink because you pass it around the table to all your friends and enjoy it together. Unfortunately, it came in a tea bag, served in a regular tea cup.  So that was very disappointing.  However, we had plenty of our BYOB Malbec to enjoy instead.  No corkage fee at Tango Sur either, which is wonderful. All in all, it was a wonderful experience.  They lose one star because of the lack of vegetable puree (which I suppose is not traditional) but mostly because of the mate.  That may seem harsh, but an Argentine restaurant should really observe what is a integral part of serving mate. Definitely check it out.  And maybe bring your own mate.",0.9957,0.805,0.14,0.055,0.5690722882559617

At first I thought he was just a little busy, but by the end of the night it was like he was too busy or annoyed to talk to us! He never explained the menu and when we were choosing between the two ""Ideal for two"" items on the menu, didn't explain the differences at ALL. All he said was ""This one is a filet, the other is a flank"" and walked off. We chose the flank and I don't know what we were expecting but this was NOT it. The meat was stringy, fatty, difficult to cut, and even more difficult to chew. It was almost like stew meat, and while the seasonings were excellent, they couldn't save this cut from being just plain disappointing. No one wants to be stuck with a cut of meat that takes 5 minutes to chew every bite. I can't help but think that if only our server had bothered to take the time at all to describe that actual differences between the cut, we would have been a lot happier.

Pork Chop.  Ever.  Seriously, it is so easy to dry out a pork chop so I was worried but as soon as I cut into this beautiful piece of meat my worries were out the window.  Not only is the pork chop itself amazing, the sauce is ridiculous...RIDICULOUSLY AWESOME!!  This was the most delicious pork chop dish I've ever had, everyone in my group tried it as well and they all agreed-seriously, a must try!

My bf and I went there just to see what the fuss is about. we were there 5.10 / 5.15 pm. there was no wait we were seated right away.But in fifteen minutes the place was full. we had a very nice waiter who was Mexican - sorry forgot his name :( we had the grill for two and it was soooo nice. I liked that they serve salad before the main.  About the grill: It was really delicious. We love red meat and my bf is really snob when it comes to food.We were both like; yeah!!! BYOB is a nice thing for that place.It's definitely a plus. You don't have to drink what the menu offers.You have your own selection. Another reason I liked that place is it's casual: you don't have to dress up to have a good dinner.And there were people - Argentinian more than likely- that makes you feel you're in a real ethnic place not an American version of it. We also had desert which I cannot remember what.It was something with peach in it. That was delicious too. The only complaint I might have is the grill gets cold fast.They can leave some ember in the grill which might keep it warm and you can just enjoy it even at the last bite!!

2011-03-30,4.0,"I don't often have steak cravings, but when I do, Tango Sur is the top of my list for a restaurant to go to. I've been here twice now, both times on a Friday night. While the wait can be long (the last time they said 45 minutes) they have a waiting room in the back with tables where you can open up the bottles of wine/beer/liquor you brought, which makes the waiting time seem much much less. Both times our table ordered some empanadas to share. They're pretty good, I wouldn't order them myself (probably try something a little more interesting, there are some delicious sounding other appetizers) but in general everyone loves an emapanada. My favorite so far has been their spinach and cheese. I have tried two of the entrees: one of the ""for two"" entree specials (Lomo Relleno) and the last time I got the T-bone (veal steak). I fell in love with the T-bone. It was cooked perfectly (medium rare, please) and was about 3 inches thick, covered in some kind of delicious spice blend. I was the smallest person at the table and yet I was the only one who managed to finish my entire entree, buttery mashed potatoes included.  Other things I've had bites of: Vesuvio (filet stuffed with spinach and cheese, not really my thing, I like my meats straight up) and Filet Mignon (it's filet mignon, it tastes good). It's usually pretty busy and loud, so don't expect your waiter to be overly attentive. I was satisfied with the speed we ordered, and we didn't want for any water or a waiter to uncork our next bottle of wine. Best part about this place: leave stuffed for about $50 a couple.

2011-03-28,3.0,"Be prepared for a long wait, especially on weekend nights. My friend and I waited two hours on a Friday night. But the host takes your cell phone number and calls you, so at least we got to walk around and check out some of the places on Southport and Addison. To avoid the wait, I'd suggest getting there when it opens at 5 PM or getting a group of eight or more of your friends to go with you and making a reservation. It's bring your own beer and alcohol, but I don't think they charge a corkage fee.  The restaurant is dark and candle-lit. It's like the owners were trying to create a romantic setting. However, they fell short because the place is so loud that you have to yell so the person across the table can hear you. And the dining area is kind of cramped so your table is only a foot away from the tables next to you. You end up overhearing more of your neighbors' conversations than you would ever care to. As for the food, it was pretty good overall, except for el filet. But I didn't like how the waiters just assumed that my we wanted to share all of our food. In the waiter's words, ""It's more romantic this way."" Kind of awkward, to say the least.  The appetizers and dessert really made the meal. The chicken and cheese empanadas were really good. I originally ordered la berenjena (eggplant and cheese baked in the oven) as my entree, but as I said before, the waiter assumed we wanted to share it as an appetizer. It was my favorite part of the meal. The flan was a nice way to end the meal, and it made up for a lackluster el filet.  I'd steer clear of el filet.  It was way too tough.  Normally filet mignon is supposed to almost melt in your mouth, but it took me 90 seconds (I timed it) to force down a small bite of the steak.  Gross. I love steak but that hunk of meat was sick. It's kind of ironic that the steak was so horrible because Tango Sur is an Argentine steakhouse and is known for its steak. The spinach mashed potatoes were pretty good though. But, like I said before, it was pretty good overall.  I'd definitely go there again.

2011-03-28,5.0,"Love this place!  I remember going here about 4 years ago before they were on Check Please.  Went on a Saturday night, got a table right away, had an incredible meal, the bill was small and I was pretty excited.  Aside from being able to get a table right away, everything else good about this place continues to stand today, despite the incredible popularity. Went on Saturday night with a group of 4.  Put our name on the list at 6:45 and went for some drinks across the street with the hope that we would be seated around 8:15 (after the college bball game was over).  Lo and behold, phone rang at 8:14 that our table was ready and off we went.   We brought 3 bottles for two guys and two girls and were seated after about 20 minutes and one bottle of wine in the back room waiting area.  Given that we all had a long night ahead of us, we decided to go heavy on appetizers and split some entrees.  We started with the antipasta as well as a handful of empanadas.  The empanadas are superb, coming in chicken, beef, ham or spinich flavor with each being better than the last.  This was probably not the time or place for a cold antipasta dish but it was fine regardless. *Important note.  I was outvoted in terms of getting the Provoleta appetizer which is pretty much a plate full of hot melted cheese mixed with olive oil and roasted red peppers.  Somehow, it actually tastes better than it sounds so make sure to get this as putting the cheese on bread, empanadas or steak is just incredible. On to the entrees.  My girl and I split the El Filet while our two friends split the Bife Vesuvio.  I can honestly say I have been to this restaurant 30 times and never strayed from either of those two dishes.  The filet is actually a pair of filets in a red wine sauce over garlic mashed potatos.  It was cooked perfectly and we were both stuffed at the end.  The vesuvio is a thicker cut of meat stuffed with spinich and cheese and needless to say, all plates were fully clean by the time we were done. Atmosphere at this place is great with the dim, candlelit dining and noisy, but not too noisy ambiance that allows the soft latin beats to be heard over the voices in the crowded room. We topped it off with some chocolate cake and espressos and everyone left smiling. Despite the years of popularity, Tango Sur continues to hold up to the high standards placed on them and continues to excel.  Great place for dates, groups, events, or just to go have a great meal at a reasonable cost. Without a doubt, this is a top 3 place in Chicago for me.

I was a little nervous about the service since I came across a few reviews that were very negative but the service was superb. It is BYOB with NO corking fees so this contributed to an even better experience than I expected.  As for the quality of the food, my friend ordered this appetizer that I fell in love with. It was some sort of queso fundido which was creamy, gooey, and bad on so many levels but oh so good. The warm bread and butter they served at first wasn't far behind the quality of the queso. For dinner I ordered a filet mignon which was complimented by some rather large potatoes that resembled steak fries and to my surprise, there were TWO medallions of steak on the plate. Needless to say I had to take one home.  On another note, at times it got a little noisy but this was mainly due to the tacky singing of the birthday celebration behind us. For a second I thought I was at the Olive Garden. Also, bring a flash light with you so that you can see the menu because it is a romantically dark atmosphere and only a few candles shed light.

First time was for a bachelor party the second was with a bunch of couples the third was for another bachelor party and this fourth time was the most fun. Anyway getting a reservation was as usual with the very blunt receptionist. But after deciding on a date based on everyones availability we got there and ended up waiting 25mins past our reservation time because the restaurant was behind schedule. Well it kinda worked out because 2 of our friends were running kind of late and the friends we came with took a while to find parking. The hosts treat the guests like were at a night club. Unless you have a reservation you are not allowed in the waiting room. Which kind of sucked because it was cold out and we had to wait about 15mins in the cold. But anyways we got in and only waited another 5mins until we were sat down. Everything after that was a pleasant experience. Everytime I go I order the Bife Ancho. That's the boneless rib eye. 3 out of 4 times I was in bovine heaven! Only once was the meat a little tough. This time it was simply divine. I'm not a bragger by nature but I thought my steak was the best choice out of everyone elses. Yes filet mignon is great for those that love tender lean meat but if you want a super juicy cut with tenderness while it's still mooing, order the Bife Ancho medium rare. Although I prefer baked empanadas my wifes ham and cheese empanadas were good. The bread they bring out also freshly baked. We also shared dessert with everyone.

2011-03-01,5.0,"One of my favorite restaurants in the city, Tango Sur is really the best and is always a go-to place for a meal that I know I will enjoy.  It is perfect for a date, special occasion, group party, whatever you're in the mood for.  The food is really amazing, and everything is a must-try.  I mean everything! I have been there so many times, I can't review all that I have eaten, but it's all been wonderful.  The portions can be large - so you might want to consider sharing, and the food can be filling, so don't plan on going to the club for dancing afterwards.

We waited about 30 minutes but that could be because we had reservations for 6 but 2 didn't show so we had to go to the wait list so we may have been bumped up. Most times you can expect 1-2 hour wait. Setting- This place is very small and always packed. Tables close together. there is a small waiting room in the back were you can drink what you have with you. (BYOB) No corkage fee. They will bring you buckets to chill your wine or beer. It is bustling and loud and cramped. Food- Vegetarians and Fish eaters need not apply. While there are a few items on the menu most of it is Meat. The Empanadas were awesome and each entree comes with a basic salad. We all had something different and it was all out of this world! The EL FILET might have been the best Filet I have ever had. 2 9oz Filets in a wine sauce (YES 2!) for $25..are you kidding?! Awesome. Others had the Flap meat (which was served on a table grill and was ginormous! Serves 2) Salmon and Ribeye (which looked like Fred Flinstone was carrying it) The portion sizes could feed 2 sometimes 3 people and the prices were reasonable for the amount of food you get. Also, everything was cooked to perfection. Drinks- BYOB. No corkage fee and the wait staff was more than happy to bring buckets to chill the wine and beer. Waitstaff- This place is super cramped and always busy so you can expect some problems. However we did not have any problems  whatsoever. They were attentive, the food came out in a reasonable time frame and we did not feel rushed at all. Could be it was after 9 but the place was still packed.  Bottom line - Its going to be busy and crowded and you may wait a really long time.

Tango sur is the place my man and I go when ever we just want some delicious meat and savory chimmichurri, and we don't want to pay seriously inflated Chicago steakhouse prices. It's byob and right across the street is a wine shoppe called que syrah. They are extremely helpful and even offer recommendations if you tell them you are going to tango sur. Also, down the street, there is a huge, new jewel osco and a CVS, that has an impressively extensive wine selection. No corkage fee, so drink away. They have solid empanadas but I wanted to try something new (and a tad healthier), so I tried the Berenjena En Escabeche which is sliced eggplant marinated in vinegar, garlic and olive oil. It is a cold salad dish. It was refreshing and a perfect balance of savory and flavorful. I was surprised with how much I liked it. Next came the salad, which come with everything. Nothing special though...lettuce, two tomato slices, couple of raw red onion rings served with red wine vinegar and olive oil. I had the el filet cooked medium rare. It's 2 pieces of filet 7-8 ounces, a piece! For $24! Which means you get darn near a pound of delicious grilled premium meat, mid-winter for less than what it would cost at jewel...on sale. I can only get through one and I substitute  the spinach mash potatoes for roasted potato spears seasoned with garlic, rosemary, salt and pepper. I always have a meal for the following day and there chimmichurri is the best in the city.  I am aware they have dessert, but have never had the room for it. And believe you me, I can make room for dessert. Some day, some day. I have never had anything but stellar service and perfect pace of experience. My last time I sat in the front room, right next to the window, which I thought might have been chilly but I felt no drafts and the light from the street made it easy to read the menu (which if you are in the back room, you have only a single candle by which to read the menu).

I was not impressed by the spinach mashed potatoes, but they were a nice green color, so at least they looked pretty. I'm also not a fan of mashed potatoes in general, though.

My friend made a reservation more than a week before today (for another friend's birthday dinner). We arrived at Tango Sur at our reservation time and the owner/host faltered between two very different stories about why he didn't have a reservation noted for us... 1st, he said that we were supposed to confirm the reservation hours before our arrival and apparently we didn't so... no table (ok, that's fine if a restaurant wants to have this type of policy - but no one told my friend to do so when she made the original reservation).... and 2nd, he told us that the restaurant had tried calling my friend this AM to confirm, but she didn't answer (umm, ZERO missed calls on my friend's phone from today). OK, make up your mind and pick a story! Aside from the owner/host's fabricated stories.... he had an AWFUL attitude and was not very friendly. Since Tango Sur told us we would have to wait at least another hour to be seated, we moved down the street and found another fabulous BYOB that would accommodate our group of 7....

My co-diner got the same dish, and his was probably medium.  And my friend who ordered her dish medium has a definitely RARE piece of meat.  When she talked to the waiter, he was gracious and took it back to the kitchen.  But, when it came back, it was as if the kitchen had nuked the plate, and the meat was inedible.",0.9687,0.824,0.156,0.019,0.45720899470899473
2011-01-26,3.0,"Candelit dinner... huge chunks of roasted meat.. BYOB! what's not to like? Sigh I really wanted to love this place...Unfortunately, the meat was rather chewy...which has been mentioned in other reviews.  I had the El filet (most popular dish) which is a filet mignon with side of spinach mashed potatoes. And it was not as tender as expected. Filet mignon is supposed to be like the butter of all steaks but this was not. Sad. Anyway everything smelled tantalizing and delicious, but at one point it became like overwhelming. It's like that feeling when you first walk into a Chinese buffet and you are like HOLY CRAP THAT SMELLS GOOD! and then you walk out never wanting to smell that chinese food again. It was something like that on a smaller scale.   And I had tried bites of my other friends' dishes which were all good but not mind-blowing. The presentation for the dishes for two looked like an amazing smorgasbord of meat meat meat. The flavors were great especially the chimichurri sauce which was like crack. Even though my dish didn't come with that sauce, I asked for some, and the waiter was great about accommodating (and brought me TWO!)  The service was excellent even though it was very hectic inside.  They do charge a plating fee if you bring a dessert/cake for a birthday etc. ($1.75/person). They also take reservations for larger groups (but not for smaller ones! so beware).  Overall, not particularly enthused one way or the other. Love the BYOB of course, but the meal felt really heavy. And the salad was probably the worst salad concocted that I've seen at a restaurant (lettuce+tomatoes+onions--- no dressing-- just vinegar and oil on table). Maybe I just don't get it?

2011-01-26,5.0,"The lady friend took me here last night for my birthday. It is labeled as an Argentine grill. She called and got reservation for 8 pm, but on a Tuesday, it wasn't really necessary. I will preempt by saying I have only lived in Chicago for a couple months. I had been to BYOBs, but I didn't realize that really nice restaurants do this as well as your local burger place. Now, we sat in the backroom. Very romantic, if you're into that sort of thing. There was a guy playing a guitar throughout the night. Lighting is almost strictly candlelight. Fun stuff. I spent a month this past Spring in Argentina. Spent time traveling, so I had meals from Mendoza to Buenos Aires. I had some of the best steak and wine I had ever enjoyed in my life, and typically for less than $10 combined. So when she surprised me with this place, I was excited to see how it compared. Let's just say I was surprised. The lady is a vegetarian and lactose intolerant, which means going out to eat doesn't involve a lot of sharing. She ordered Pez, a salmon dish. I had about 5 things on the menu I was interested in, so I asked our server what he suggested. He said to get El Filet. he said ""It would single-handedly make me come back for more"" Ok. Challenge accepted. I also ordered a single Spinach & Cheese Empanada. We had brought a Merlot and a Malbec to drink with the meal. Popped the Merlot for pre-dinner so I could save the Malbec for the steak. The Empanada was very good. Extremely fresh and flavorful. It came with what I assume was an olive oil & pesto side for dipping. Also good, though not much is necessary due to the strong oil. Now, main course. The Filet came with a side of green potatoes (I looked and laughed a little to myself). I always get my steak rare, and typically this can make or break the meal. Too often the post-grill cooking within the meat is not accounted for and it is simply just bloody rather than cooked right. I give kudos to the chef because this was cooked expertly. Seared on the outside while extremely soft and chewy on the inside. And the flavor!! I am not lying when I say I had to put my fork and knife down after the first bite. It was PHENOMENAL! Perfect texture, taste, everything. I immediately told my date that it was hands down better than anything I had while in Argentina. The Malbec, though not the most expensive bottle, complimented it perfectly. The portion was enormous. I am a healthy eater, though I did not even finish half of my plate, of the filet or the potatoes. The potatoes were good. Very light and flavorful. The Pez was very good also. Obviously a fresh fish that wasn't just picked up at the local market. Our server told us it was fresh from Chile. It was served with a sauce of shiitake mushrooms, and as with the steak, cooked perfectly. I had a single bite, but acknowledge that it was a very good seafood option at an otherwise red meat-focused restaurant. I will be going back to Tango Sur as soon as my leftovers can be finished, which may take more than 1 attempt. Side note: Only open from 5-10/11 This is a fantastic date place as well as good for a small group of friends.

It is not the season for tomatoes.  The meal would have been perfect if instead of surprise herb roasted potatoes (they were good), I got a nice salad with my steak.

2011-01-02,4.0,"Simply the best BYOBooze-a-mahol place in Chicago.  That is as long as you are aren't a vegan or vegetarian. No corkage fee, and just about any type of booze goes well with hefty chunks of cow.  And be prepared for cow, because I'd say about 85% of their menu is based on that hulking grass-eating beast of an animal. From my experiences here, you can come to expect not only a lot of beef, but also the following: - Very dark environment.  No, I'm not speaking metaphorically- but everything seems to be lit through these tiny candles.  Might be a good idea here considering the presentation tends to be a big chunk of grilled flesh on a plate, and maybe some sauce. - This will basically in no way be a quick meal.  Everything from being seated (unless you get a reservation), to the service, to the time it takes for that 8-pound fillet to arrive, and even the ""recovery"" time from your ""meat coma"" is going to take awhile. - Despite the servings being bovine-heavy, much like what you will find in not only Argentina, but throughout most of the world- you can be a bit adventurous and sample odds and ends of the cow.  Tongue organ meat, intestines, and right down to a sausage made from the blood of the beast is on offer- and definitely worth the try (especially that blood sausage, which is possibly the best I've ever had). - Did I mention a lot of meat?  Yes, it is true, but my point here necessitating a separate dash is that you aren't going to find much in terms of vegetables on offer.  They do have sides of potatoes (not REALLY a vegetable, right?) and some other things, and a very simple salad of lettuce, onions and tomatoes is brought to you before whichever cut of massive meat comes your way. - ""Romantic"" is maybe one way to describe a very dark restaurant, but I'd go ahead and say it isn't a very romantic place at all.  The volume gets very loud, and the place is always crowded.  They do a great job in their service and make things as comfortable as possible, but when you hear the sixth ""Happy Birthday"" ring out while you are trying to tell your date about that time you saved a puppy from a floating chunk of ice out in Lake Michigan on a frigid February day, you might have a hard time. - According to a few ladies at my table, and this became progressively obvious as more wine was drunk (and the meat coma was taking a firm grip on us all), the waiters are the best sweet thing on offer there (see: eye candy).  No matter though, as they ogled at Max the waiter, I drooled over my lomo relleno and sneaked more wine from under their aloof watch. - The best sweet thing there in my opinion though was the flan, with a chocolate caramel covering.  Very nice!",0.9963,0.815,0.146,0.039,0.5183039388594944

They start you off with bread and starter salads.  They also give you oil and vinegar to make your own dressing. We got 2 each of the beef and the ham and cheese empanadas for apps. Tasty!! I thought the beef tasted better and as a bonus added surprise they have a hard boiled egg inside. Yummy!! The ham and cheese empanadas were good too, with lots of gooey cheese but it reminded me of a more classy version of a ham and cheese hot pocket.  The chimichurri sauce that came with the empanadas was freaking delicious!!  We got the Lomo Relleno and the Para Dos. The menu said each dish served two people. Between 3 big guys and me, it was rough finishing all the meat... quantity is not an issue here! The Lomo was a large hunk of meat that was cooked with portabella marsala, whereas the Para Dos was a selection of meats, sausages and innards that are simply seasoned and grilled.  Everything tasted pretty good with the exception of the sweetbreads. They were way overcooked, super chewy and greasy, definitely the worst thing that night.  Total of apps and 2 entrees came out to about $88 without tax and tip.  Not bad!!

Food: 1/3 of the dishes were satisfactory.   For a restaurant that is supposed to know about meat, I was extremely disappointed.  I ordered the filet and the meat was fatty (filet?!? - when is filet EVER fatty), undercooked (i ordered medium), and difficult to cut.  My sister ordered the bacio (flat meat) medium rare and it was too dry because it was well done.  The boyfriend ordered the 12oz ribeye and that was decent.  Additionally, the ""salads"" are essentially hamburger toppings (lettuce, tomato, and onion)... yum... I did complain about the filet, but i always feel bad returning the food especially since it took so long to come out that I figured, this would be one establishment that I would not be coming back to and it wasn't worth spending more time there.   They did give a free flan (unfortunately, I'm not that big on flan)... what they really should have done was comped the meal.",0.6596,0.874,0.073,0.053,0.5270238095238096

2010-11-22,4.0,"On Saturday night, I went out with three girlfriends to Tango Sur, the famed Argentinean restaurant in Wrigleyville on Southport Ave. For steak lovers, it's like dying and going to heaven. However, before you can get into heaven, you're gonna have to wait more than 2 hours. I will only say this once...GO EARLY. If you have less than 8 people in your party, you cannot make reservations, and the restaurant fills up very quickly. This fact in itself accounts for my mixed review. We arrived at 7:30PM and put our names on the list. After being told that we would have to wait for 2 hours, we walked down the road to Hye Bar for some pre-dinner drinking. Tango Sur is BYOB so I wasn't really bothered by spending money down the street.  Once we were finally able to sit down and order, it was about 10PM and we were starving. Now, I don't know if it's because I was wearing over-the-knee black boots, but I seemed to get a lot of attention from the waiters at the restaurant, who are all male. I would also venture to say that 99% of them are from South America, which definitely adds to the authentic feeling of the place! Of course, I didn't mind the attention, and I might have even managed to get a date out of it! Saucy. Speaking of sauce, the first thing we ordered was a plate of empanadas on which we smeared delicious chimichurri sauce. It's a concoction of olive oil, parsley, salt, pepper, garlic, and probably a few other things. But Tango Sur is one of the few places that does not add any vinegar. It was to-die-for! We ordered two spinach and cheese empanadas and two chicken empanadas. They were the perfect appetizer.  For the main meal, the hit at the table was the birthday girl's Vacio for two (shown above the empanadas). A grilled steak with sweet potatoes and a tantalizing sauce, it was big and meaty and delicious. I ordered the Bife Vesuvio, a well-done steak stuffed with spinach and cheese, marinated in a white wine sauce. I will say here that it was delicious. But I'm a rare steak kind of girl and I found my meat a little hard to chew. I kept the leftovers, though, so I still enjoyed it! Jessica got the best thing of all, in my opinion: El Filet, filet mignon with a red onion wine sauce. I managed to snag half of hers to take home in my leftovers. It was perfectly cooked and sooooo tender. Although it was annoying to wait until 10PM to sit down and eat, the staff were efficient and fun. They gave us flan with delicious dulce de leche on top for my friend's birthday, and their flirtation added to the sexy ambience. I would for sure go back, but maybe I'd try getting there at 5:30 instead of 7:30.  Steaks tend to run about $20-$25 for one person, $35 for a two-person meal. Empanadas are $1.75 each.

I ordered it medium rare and they cooked it medium rare, so it brings me to the conclusion that the cut of steak just wasn't right. I wanted to really like it since the flavor was so good, but damn, my mouth was getting tired of chewing. The other group we were with order a similar plate but their meat was very tender. Take it under advisement that you should ask your waiter what dish is the most tender so you don't get stuck chewing some rubber.

The preparation and the texture of the steak is sometimes inconsistent, and 9/10 times I get the rib-eye.  Medium seems to be just right.  However, to me flavor is everything and this place is close to perfection.  I could have given it a 4 star due to this, but this is one of the few restaurants that I actually revisit several times a year - maybe even more.  Speaking of...

We were not impressed with the food, I had the ribeye (not much else to choose from but meat) and my husband had the veal. Steak was alright, not a great cut of meat. And my husbands veal was strangely cooked on top but raw on the bottom, it was a thick piece that was butterflied and stuffed. He was not a fan. For app we had this cheese thing.. yes it was a thing. It said baked cheese and thats exactly what we got. a sizzling piece of melted cheese. strange.  Service was ok, not great not bad, average.

If we hadn't had reservations it would have been at least an hour long wait. It would have been worth it.  As everyone has said it's very dark inside, I think it lends itself to being intimate and romantic. Service was very prompt in opening our wine and getting us menus. There always seemed to be the right amount of time between everything. When we wanted our waiter there he was and when we were enjoying lingering he wasn't.  We started with the empanadas and the antipasto plate. Both were great. Definitely get at least one empanada, they're all delicious. The salad to start the meal is really nothing special but that isn't why anyone goes there. It's for the STEAK!!  Wow!!  My husband and I split the lomo relleno and couldn't have been happier. It was shear bliss. Moist, tender, spicy and covered in the best portabella mushrooms ever. We couldn't stop raving about it. Everyone else had steaks and loved theirs as well.

2010-10-18,1.0,"I will start by pointing out good aspects, BYOB, adorable Bistro like atmosphere.  We were a party of six on a Saturday, late afternoon.  We ordered a sampling of empanadas with chimichurri that were ok. Now the not so great part. We placed our orders, my sis and I ordered the fillet for two,medium.  The rest of the group ordered a steak stuffed with spinach.   The food took 1 1/2 hours to arrive. When our fillet arrived, it was a monstrous piece of meat covered in sauce and served with mushrooms, that's it no side of anything. I wasn't even asked if I wanted to order a side. When I put my knife to cut it I realized I had to use brute strength just to get a slice.  The steak was way way way overcooked. I was very disappointed about this. I showed the steak to the server who said it was just a little over cooked. I told him the meat was completely brown and gray, no pink it was overcooked.  He then said very dismissively, do you want another one? I said, well I really don't want to wait over an hour for it. His response was, ""well the food takes as long as it takes to cook"". At that point I was more than displeased not only with the food but also with the service.  I asked for a manager, he said there wasn't one.  Hard to believe on a busy Saturday there isn't a manager in the restaurant. He agreed to put an order in for another steak and put a rush on it.  The second attempt of the fillet arrived and this time is was completely rare inside. I told the server it was rare, he took it back to the kitchen and by the time he brought it out the third time I had lost my appetite, the steak was not very flavorful, it was still hard to cut. I think they use a poor quality of meat here. The rest of my group agreed that with the steaks lacking flavor and also being difficult to cut and chew.  I will never go back to this place to give it a second chance, regardless of it's most appealing draw of being BYOB.  Bad service in my opinion is inexcusable.",-0.9414,0.85,0.062,0.088,0.49250000000000005

2010-10-12,5.0,"Oh how I wish I actually LIKED meat. Don't get me wrong, I've tried on numerous occasions. I am not the kind of person that turns my nose up to a particular food group without at least giving it a shot. I have never been an avid meat eater; well, I haven't really eaten meat at all over the past 28 years or so. But, every once and a while, I give it one more try. And that is exactly what I did at Tango Sur. This is obviously an Argentine steak house and most of my friends ordered a steak dish. Each person's fillet looked absolutely scrumptious! So, I tried a bite. It was good, nice and tender, but I still just could not order an entire dish of red meat and eat it. It's not good enough for me. But again, I am an anomaly. Every person that ordered a steak absolutely loved it and as the outsider, I thought they all looked very good, with a very appealing presentation, and some tasty spinach mashed potatoes on the side. The BEST part about Tango Sur, is the BYOB. How many times have you gone out to dinner or brunch and have found your drink bill exceeds your dinner bill? This has happened to me a number of times, and it is disconcerting to say the least, but also a bit comical. Drinks are just expensive. But at Tango Sur, you can bring your own booze and that is just awesome in my mind. So, kudos to them for allowing this. They do have an assortment of poultry and fish. The tilapia looked amazing but after having ran/walked 10 miles that day, I felt like a good hearty pasta dish. So I ordered the fettucine alfredo with a side salad of mozzarella cheese, spinach and roasted red pepper. My alfredo was phenomenal. One would think this is such a simple dish and how could one screw it up? Well, this is true but there were so many interesting and complimentary flavors, that it was quite different than other alfredos I've tried. And my tastebuds where happy.  The ambiance is quite cool as well. It's very dim inside, has a sort of romantic feel to it, and just seems the perfect setting to enjoy a nice juicy steak, or in my case, cream-covered pasta.",0.9986,0.758,0.232,0.01,0.6055199222546161

I was recommended Tango Sur by my friend Cara P. Tango Sur is a quaint little restaurant tucked away in the Southport row, with surrounding restaurants and boutique shops. Tango Sur could easily be missed if you aren't looking out for it, however, what will catch your attention are the mass amounts of people waiting in line for up to 2 hours or more to eat at this Argentinean steakhouse. I've heard lots of good things and read other reviews about Tango Sur that were all consistent and positive. This is one of the few restaurants that don't have a corkage fee, therefore allowing patrons to enjoy their bottles of wine, spirits or beer, free of charge...that's almost unheard of. I came here with the intentions of trying their signature items, their steaks. For starters, I ordered two chicken and two beef empanadas. These are deep fried deliciousness served with a side of the BEST chimichurri sauce I've ever had, hands down. Following came the Provoleta which is Argentine provolone cheese, melted on the grill with olive oil and roasted red peppers. I've never seen a dish disappear as fast as this one. For the main course I ordered the filet cooked medium rare with spinach mashed potatoes, this dish came with two filets and were seasoned and cooked to perfection. I really enjoyed my first experience and look forward to coming back to try more items. The service was friendly and informative but not intrusive. This is definitely a place to take a date as it is dark and candle lit on each table, making it a romantic and intimate experience.

2010-09-12,5.0,"I give Tango Sur 5 stars because every time I've been here, which is a lot, I've experienced consistently good service and food.  The chimichurri is wonderful and can be purchased next door in their small store in a plastic container to take home.  It's served with the filet mignon I order regularly there.  The meals are enormous.  A filet mignon order comes with two pieces of steak, along with potatoes and chimichurri.  In addition Tango Sur is BYOB.  The service is very quick and efficient and the candlelight makes it a romantic place to dine.  Be aware, however, that there are no reservations allowed, but they kindly take your cell phone number and will call you when a table is ready for you.  There is a bar a few doors down where you can sit and wait for your phone call.  Another thing to consider is that it is a very crowded place.  Basically you are within a few feet, on each side, from other diners.  The noise created by conversations around you create some sort of privacy, but basically it's a crowded setting and you are in tight quarters here.  Overall, this place is my favorite place to dine if I'm in the mood for a steak.  They have fancy, spiced steaks as well, but I prefer the simple filet and it's wonderful here.  I always bring a doggie bag home and have another two meals with it, which makes it a very budget-conscious restaurant.  I recommend this restaurant for a night when you just want a good steak on a date or with a few people.  A full table of more than 4 people might make it a little difficult to have a decent conversation because of the noise and close proximity to others dining there.  But this is, after all, only my opinion - I see people here in large groups all the time and I wonder how they are able to hear each other.",0.9887,0.856,0.13,0.013,0.5037913883502119

Tango Sur is one of the greatest steak places for the price, and same level as the high name steak houses downtown, with a different feel.

Dine before 7:00 PM, after 7:15-7:30PM the wait can get as long as 1  1/2- 2 hours longs.  2. It is BYOB, so don't forget the booze. Utilize a screw top as you will be full from dinner. 3. It is loud. 4. If you are a light eater most entries are big enough to share. If you are on the fence, consider different dishes, you can't go wrong.  5.

2010-08-29,1.0,"I was disappointed with my visit to Tango Sur on Saturday, August 29. My recommendation to the owner; 1) Better quality flatware and sharp knives 2) Better quality of beef, more inspection of what you are buying 3) Serve food hot 4) Improve the dining room acoustics  A busy evening and with our reservation we were seated immediately, the table was a little tight but at least the seating behind us were not hitting our chairs.  Waiters were prompt, friendly, and knowledgeable.  Ambience was loud and once the dining area filled you could hardly hear the person across from you, you literally had to shout and by evenings end I was horse from shouting.  It seems the louder became the higher they turned up the music volume.  They definitely need acoustics work in the building. The flatware was of the most inexpensive grade and the knives needed sharpening.  The forks were so cheap that the tines were crooked and bent on many of them.  When you serve beef/meat sharp knives are essential.  If the meat isn't tender a sharp knife is always a great cover. Enjoyed the BYOB which encourages spending a leisurely time for dinner   None of this would matter much if the food had lived up to its reputation.  Our party of eight all ordered a different entrées.  I can only speak for 4 of the items;  1) The eggplant was favorable but came to the table lukewarm, like it had sat too long on the plate. 2) The T-bone was so full of fat to be nearly inedible and could not be cut no matter how hard you worked 3) The short ribs were not favorable and tough 4) The sirloin steak was editable but flavor was totally lacking and also had more fat that you would normally expect. If this is a ""meat restaurant"" they need to upgrade the quality of the meat they purchase or find a chef that knows high quality beef (the entree cost demands this).  Then they need serve the food HOT, this is beef, and beef should be eaten sizzling coming out of the kitchen and if you can't achieve that you really shouldn't be in this business.",0.993,0.86,0.131,0.009,0.5644483159117304

We had a party of 5 and since they do not take reservations for party's of 6 or less, I had my doubts on if we would be able to eat there that night. However, to my delight, the guy taking names said the wait would only be half an hour. Just enough time to walk over to CVS and grab a bottle of wine and head back. Much to our delight, we were seated within 30 minutes. The place was crowded, but not to the point where someones butt would be in your face if they were passing by your table. First off, I do not remember the place being so dark. If the place was any darker I would have to use night vision goggles to get around the place. Even when seated at our table, the candles were so small, I could barely see the person across the table from me or my food which I needed to cut, a little annoying, but I will just have to work around it. The wife and I ordered: Lomo Relleno half slab Argentine filet sliced and filled with a chimichurri, ham sauce then cooked and served on a grill with portabella marsala I never had this, as I always order the T-bone. I was not sure if it would be enough for my wife and I (even though the menu said it is ideal for two), my wife always says that my stomach is a bottomless pit. When it came out, I thought the menu should have read (ideal for three), it was a big portion of meat, which i was praying would not be dry. Much to my pleasure the meat was not dry whatsoever and was absolutely delicious. After cutting each slice, I made sure to dip the slice in the ham sauce the meat came in and then the chimichurri sauce, but some people might want to skip the chimichurri sauce altogether because the meat already so much flavor with the ham sauce.  The portabella mushrooms that came with the dish were veeeeeeeeery good. This is coming from a person who only eats mushrooms with his deep dish pizza, again the mushrooms were very flavorful. I completely forgot about the empanadas, the wife and I had the chicken ones and they were gone before I can blink. I had eaten mine. They were sooooooo good. I will not even try describing it. If you are there, definitely try their empanadas. Lastly, I loved the fact it was byob. This not only cuts down on the check, but it also allows you to drink something that you know you will like. A great, dark place to bring a date or go with a group, it doesn't matter because the food was absolutely delicious and the wait staff is very quick and prompt when you need water or something else to go with your meal!

I can state emphatically, however, that both times I ate here I left rubbing my belly in satisfaction and making soft mewling sounds. If this is how they eat in Argentina, book me a flight! A word of warning: Tango Sur is not a vegetarian establishment. It is not even flexitarian. In fact, had Scott Pilgrim filmed in Chicago versus Toronto, he would have invited Ramona's 3rd evil ex to dinner here.  I was seriously nervous about going here the first time (it was for my brother's birthday dinner) since I generally do not eat a lot of meat and I refuse to put my lips to factory farmed protein. Imagine my relief when the waiter confirmed that all the beef items (I cannot vouch for the chicken or fish) are sourced organically from a traditional farm. So far, so good. Now, onto the real reason you are reading this: the FOOD. Start with the pressed tongue with roasted peppers. If you have been waiting anxiously to try tongue but it just never seemed like the right time, I have happy news: it is unlikely you will find a better version than what Tango Sur prepares. Next, order the empenadas. One of each flavor should do it. Skip the a la Milanese stuff (I thought we were in Argentina?) and head straight for the Beef Vesuvio, Lomo Relleno, or El Filet. The Lomo is a great candidate for splitting with your fellow diners.  Finally, indulge your craving for a taste of sweetness with the flan. Awesome.

Your best bet is to put your name down and give them your cell phone number to call when your table is ready. While you wait, I would recommend stopping in and grabbing a drink at Cullen's, this Irish pub a few doors down. One thing you should note about Tango Sur: it's cramped and very noisy inside. Not the type of place to take your grandma who wraps herself in a cardigan and complains about the cold draft when the hostess seats her by the door. If you want to have a conversation, I would recommend sitting outside.  Now for the food. The steaks are good-sized, taste great and are extremely well-priced. When you're finished eating one you'll sit back and wonder how the Hell those places in the Loop get away with charging 40 bucks.  In my experience with Tango Sur, I've only had one problem:  my girlfriend ordered the spinach ravioli (she's vegetarian) and after eating a couple pieces, she realized they messed up her order and gave her the meat ravioli. She immediately lost her appetite and stopped eating. Now to most people, this might be hard to understand, but she was raised vegetarian and mistakingly eating meat causes her to not be hungry anymore. Fine. We politely notify our waiter that she is vegetarian and that he gave her the wrong dish. But instead of apologizing or offering to get her something else, he denies it!  We literally had to open up a piece of ravioli and show it to him. Dude, we're not trying to scam you out of two pieces of 12 dollar ravioli.

And I'm not talking about Russian spy, ass kicking action woman Angelina Jolie. Location: Went on a Wednesday and the wait wasn't bad at all. About a 10 minute wait. Heard it was horrendous on the weekends so I avoided that at all cost. Good thing I did. Finding parking was another issue. Took us at least 20 minutes to find paid parking..... Everything else is residential. Inside tip: There is a cemetery about 2 blocks away and there is free parking across the street. If you don't mind walking. It's the perfect spot. Plus, it let's you build up your hunger.  Decor: People say it's dark inside, but I thought it was cozy and mysterious. Since I was siting next to the window, the reflection of the street lamps help illuminate the person siting in front of me.   Food: I felt I was rushed by my particular waiter, like he had other things to do. He ran through the specials and left. Reflecting upon this, I don't even know what he said because he said it so fast. But then again, it was kinda loud in there. I got the Vacio for two and waited about 45 minutes for it. When it came out. It looked perfect with a big chunk of steak and sweet potatoes but unfortunately, when the meat hit my palate, it became a issue of ""is there salt on here?"" Did they even salt it at all? When I get steak, I expect my steak to be the main attraction in terms of taste and seasonings. There was a lot of sauce and sweet potatoes but I think the sweet potatoes sweetened or milled the flavor of the sauce. Overall, not the best thing I've had. I was sadly disappointed by this great cut of meat. I ended up salting the meat but it didn't help. If you have to salt your meat, clearly there is a problem. And by no means am I a salt lover. Maybe only the Angelina Jolie kind. As people said, the salad was pretty pathetic if pathetic was a word. Lettuce, sliced tomatoes and onions and vinegar and oil on the side. I was thinking to myself, where's my salad dressing? Oy vey! Empanadas were pretty good, both the meat as well as the spinach and cheese. The sauce went perfectly with them. Ahh, the only redeeming quality in this restaurant.  Overall: Not sure if all of their food is like this or was this an off day but I was not impressed. From all the reviews, I was hoping it would blow my socks off but instead it went up like a puff of smoke. I'll come back next time and give it a second chance. Next time, hopefully they'll put some salt on my meat. Btw: It's funny to watch all the drunk people come staggering out!",0.9962,0.727,0.186,0.087,0.5800108932461875
2010-08-11,2.0,"I feel like such a Debbie downer writing this, but honestly, I just don't get the hype about this place, except to say this:  Have you seen the movie ""Alive""? (umm, spoiler alert, I guess) You know the part where they find the other half of the plane with the suitcases and one of the dudes opens it and finds toothpaste? He squeezes the toothpaste into his mouth like it's the best thing he's ever eaten because the only thing he's had to eat in a really long time is his teammates? Well, I think the hype about this food just comes from waiting too long. By the time some of these other reviewers sat down, they'd eat toothpaste and call it the best meal ever. I'm not buying it.  This is one of those places we've been wanting to try forever since it always gets good reviews, but anytime we think of it, the wait is too long. So, my birthday rolled around on a Tuesday night and we figured that it would be a good night to go to try this place. We made a reservation. When we got there, there was only one other table, so we had our pick of tables and had no wait.  To start, we picked the wrong table. We sat outside at a two-top close to the window so we'd be out of the sun. Unfortunately, a leaky air conditioner from a window above had completely saturated the awning, so we were dripped on throughout the entire meal. The place was packed by the time it wasn't really funny anymore, so there was no where for us to go. I know this wasn't necessarily the restaurant's fault, but maybe they should not put a table there? Just a thought.  Our waiter came over to the table, opened our bottle of wine (leaving the foil torn and jagged. Such a small detail, but it was noticed) and left us with empty water glasses for about 10 minutes. Finally, someone came by and gave us some water. They dumped some bad bread rolls on our table and away they went. A few minutes later, the waiter returns and says ""are you ready to order?"" Now, call me picky, but good service usually includes the waiter introducing himself and asking if we'd ever been there before. The menu was not really self explanatory, but the waiter seemed in too much of a hurry to ask. We took a stab and ordered what looked good.   We ordered 2 empanadas- one con carne and one with spinach and cheese. Both were good. However, the busboy came and swept away our plates before we were finished. Just because I put my fork down does not mean you can take my plate. I hate that!  Next were the salads. I understand this is a steak house, but the salad was pretty disappointing. The lettuce was not fresh at all, and that's pretty much all the salad is: lots of wilted lettuce, 2 slices of tomato, 3 slices of onion, oil and vinegar. It was bad.  Next came our steaks. I had the boneless strip steak. My husband had the short rib. The steaks were good. I ordered mine medium rare, and it came out medium rare. It had a good flavor to it. However, it was really fatty (is that normal for a strip steak? I don't even know), and the knives were really dull so it was difficult to cut. My husband ordered his medium and it came out medium well but he enjoyed it.  Then our bill came, and it was less than we spent at a local pub a week ago, so they have that going for them.  I'd go between 2 and 3 stars for this place, so count this as a 2.5 stars. Decent steaks and good prices, but no frills. I don't understand the wait for this place. I wouldn't wait more than 10 minutes for this meal, and that's just because I know I'd be getting a deal on a steak, which is never really my first choice when eating out anyway.",0.9079,0.808,0.102,0.09,0.5048815359477126

Definitely not a kid friendly place in the evening. It's a great place to gather with friends/family. Romantic dinner?! As long as you are okay with the noise level. If your date is a bit of a talker this could be the deal breaker restaurant.

Went with it, probably would go beef next time.  Shared the Vacio which is a half slab of range grown flap meat sliced and filled with olive oil, garlic, parsley sauce, then cooked and served on a grill with mashed sweet potatoes ideal for two. This was probably the greatest thing I have eaten in a long time. Meat was perfectly charred, cooked to perfection, resting in a beautiful sauce that I wanted to slather on anything, and high quality. I could not stop eating. I am still having the meat sweats from this experience. Recommendations - Always busy. Try to get it on non-peak hours (for dinner, get in before 6). Sit outside if you can!

More than anything, the prosciutto was fairly bland. We also ordered a side of the Chorizo sausage. Order this. Seriously. I nearly fell out of my chair it was so good. My wife and I shared the Vacio, which is a large portion of meat (flap meat? Not familiar with that cut, but..) that's highly seasoned and very tasty.

Service was forgettable - slow and inattentive, especially for a fairly uncrowded Monday night. We sat for long periods of time with empty water glasses.

2010-07-25,2.0,"It's my birthday week, so I had the urge to go celebrate with a LOT of wine, and had hopes of consuming some good prime steak. Kind of like ex-Bull Dennis Rodman, I celebrate my birthday week not just the day itself. We started by walking up to the much hyped Tango Sur at 9:45 on a Saturday night. The pompous host-not a maître d', took our name, cell # and promised to call within the hour. While patiently waiting down the street at Cullens, for well over an hour, we walked back to Tango Sur.  When we walked up to the host stand, pompous host himself looks at us, asks what we need.  Wife: {scowl on face}  Me: Welllll, I'm "" Scott B."" and you said that you'd call ""within the hour?""  Pompous Host: Oh, Scott, I tried calling you.  Me: I pulled my phone out of pocket, and showed him that there were no missed calls.  Pompous Host: Uhhhh, oh, maybe I called someone else.  Me: Uhhh, yeah, maybe that's the case.  The pompous prick of a host, walked in ""to check"" if a table was available. About five minutes later, he, from a distance, waives us inside. I guess he skipped the manners class as a child?  With so much hype and extreme demand for a table, I was expecting to see Hugo Chavez and Sean Penn sharing a bottle of wine. Fortunately, this was not the case, but the place was buzzing.  After finally being seated, I opened my mind, and was looking forward to Tango Sur living up to their Yelp-a-tation. About 10 minutes later a server came by with some wine glasses, and opened our bottle of wine. (No corkage fee) Both wifey & I did notice that the prices seemed quite low for the entrees. The server took our order, and both of us opted for the ""El Filet"" at a very reasonable price of $24. As discussed, the server took our order, but not without asking on 3 separate occasions if we wanted an appetizer. I wasn't aware that after 38 years, I just picked up a speech impediment?  About 30 minutes later (getting hungry), the ""El Filets"" were delivered to our table. Jesus! What a lot of meat! The ""El Filet"" is actually 2 filets, that are probably at least 10 ounces each. Of course I was thinking, how the hell could they sell ""prime"" beef at these prices.  The ""El Filets"" were accompanied with spinach mashed potatoes. Now, these were some damn good mashed potatoes. The filets though were average, at best. Granted, they were prepared at a perfect medium rare, but this ""grass fed"" crap was hardly prime beef, in my opinion.  What I do credit Tango Sur on is the brilliant marketing team that successfully presents this sham as a first class place for steaks. Brilliant, absolutely brilliant! Just place a trendy restaurant in the affluent Southport corridor, and they'll come!  Won't return. I'll gladly pay $42 for a true prime steak at Kinzie, Keefers, or Ruth's, where I'm treated like a majority shareholder, and the quality of the steaks are second to none.",0.9918,0.829,0.122,0.048,0.5606456456456456

We sat outside, ready to order wine.   Alas! It's a BYOB place.   We sadly agreed to stay sober and ordered our food.   Alas! My choice of entree was not available that evening. I chose another, the El Filet. Hungry, we dug in to the bread rolls.  The empanadas came, and we dug into those delicious pockets.  The pesto they served with the empanadas was also delicious. Soon after, we were served a plate of garnishes: bitter greens, large slices of tomatoes, and rings of fresh onion.  I thought that this was a prelude to the entree, that everyone got a place of fresh veggies to go with their meal.  But no...it was the pre-dinner salad.  The salad was fine (who can go wrong with fresh veggies), but the presentation was way off - since when do I have to cut up salad ingredients into bite size pieces?  Very odd. After the salad, I was full (my own fault, having eaten 2 bread rolls in addition to the empanadas) and cursing myself for having ordered a heavy meat entree.  I was sure that I'd have to ask them to wrap it up to go. A loooooooooooong time later, our entrees arrived, and the portions were huge!  Huge as in, had I not filled up on bread and empanadas, I would not have been able to fit it all into my stomach.  The meat was juicy & very good, and the spinach mashed potatoes were simply green colored garlic mashed potatoes (good, but spinach colored, not spinach flavored).   Overall, the food was good.  The empanadas were special.  The lack of alcohol was a bummer and the wait for the food (on a Tuesday night) was excessive.  I would recommend coming here for a quick & lighter meal (i.e. order the empanadas and nothing else) unless you want to spend your entire evening at dinner (and hey, sometimes that is exactly what you want to do).",0.9705,0.802,0.134,0.065,0.613945868945869

My experience at Tango Sur merits a big, fat 2 stars.  For starters, this place is always busy. Allow the hurried waitstaff to do their thing; they'll get to you sooner or later. The food is yuppiefied Argentinian cuisine - no question about it.  If you never had Argentinian-style meat, then you'd probably think you're having a great meal at Tango Sur. However, Argentinian steak is supposed to have a crispy exterior with a soft interior. Hard to do without a wood-burning spit, but it can be done as evidenced at other restaurants. At Tango Sur, steaks pretty much all taste like each other - all mainly gummy, thick American steaks with a bit of seasoning to be less American. I don't know why the menu lists so many variations of steaks and prices when they all appear to be the same, slightly improved versions of what you'd get at Morton's.  One member of our party brought along cupcakes for after dinner. I know this irks some restaurants, but most allow it to occur with big parties. Not at Tango Sur. Our waiter saw the container of cupcakes and threatened that he would add $1.75 on the bill for every cupcake consumed. I am not exaggerating. We then politely asked for the dessert menu. He said he'd get it. 35 minutes passed, no dessert menu arrived, and our group of 14 decided to leave. I'm usually pretty cool with the shortcomings of restaurants as it's a crazy business, but I'd never expect such a low caliber to every aspect of our dining experience from a highly-esteemed restaurant.",0.9783,0.826,0.129,0.045,0.3873456790123457

2010-05-23,2.0,"After waiting for a steak for four hours, it was bound to be disappointing. I came here on a date a few months ago, planning on waiting for at least a couple of hours for a table.  I arrived shortly before 6, and put our names in right away for a table.  I was told it would be about an hour and a half to two hour wait - totally fine, given how crowded this restaurant can be.  We went across the street for drinks, and the host said he'd call us when our table was ready. About two hours later, he called me to let us know we'd have a table in ten minutes.  We headed over there, checked in with him, and waited for our table.  And waited.  And waited.  Half an hour later, my date asked the host how long it would be, and he said it would be at least another half hour.  I'm not sure what happened, but we didn't want to be horribly rude to him, so we headed back across the street for more drinks. An hour later, the same thing happened, except this time we stuck around outside of the restaurant with everyone else who was waiting.  Apparently, there was a party of about 15 people in the restaurant that wouldn't leave, even though they were clearly done eating.  I had seen the group go in when I originally arrived before 6, and then had been in there for more than 3 hours.  The restaurant is not huge, so they were taking up about a quarter of the seats. Rude. When we were finally escorted in, 4 HOURS after we had originally checked in, I was starving.  My steak (bife vesuvio, my usual) was decent, but I've had so much better at this place.  My date liked his steak, but for me, the wait time had left a bad taste in my mouth. (Why did we wait the 4 hours?  Because I insisted it would be the best steak ever.  I'm an idiot.) The party of 15 was still in the restaurant after we left - so they were there for at least 6 hours.  I really, really feel that the restaurant should institute some sort of policy on having people leave within half an hour of closing out their checks.  Because it's BYOB, people are going to stick around because they want to finish their booze, and it's not fair at all to those who are waiting for tables.  If I go back, I will likely stick to weeknights, as the weekends are way too crazy for me.",-0.7667,0.851,0.066,0.083,0.41919427191166314

(Malbec preferably) - arrive at Tango EARLY (unless you don't mind the very long wait) - try to sit in the front dining room if at all possible (ha! as if you'll have a choice with the crowd!) - order the beef and cheese variety of empanadas (they are fried yet haven't even a trace of grease, very well prepared) - for the steak, order the Vacio for two and when the waiter asks how you'd like the steak prepared, do not ask that it be cremated.  Or perhaps just leave it to the cook to decide, as he'll know which temperature/preparation brings out the best in that particular cut of meat.   I've heard the flan is excellent, though I have yet to try it myself.

What's great about the service is if you tell the waiters that you are planning to share the dish, they would actually cut the steak into two pieces for you. And believe me, the portion is enough for two people if you are sharing appetizers and desert. In my latest visit, my date and I decided shared this chef's special appetizer, Berenjena. I've never been a fan of eggplant but somehow I enjoyed this one quite a bit. At the end of the day, my date was happy and my wallet was happy. So win win.

I had 4 people with me. 2 girls, 2 guys. So we brought, a six pack of nice bottle beers, 2 18 oz crafted beers, a bottle of champagne, and a bottle of wine.  We had most of it before we sat down. Alcohol makes waiting easier. If you can't get into the little back waiting room they have, use the park bench at the Dairy Queen next door. (I cannot be responsible for open container violations if they happen to you.)  2.) Be prepared to wait. Just know your going to wait so you don't spoil it.  3.) Order the Empinada's. We had the meat ones, but I've heard the others are tasty as well. Sweet Fancy Moses! They are incredible!  4.) Flap Steak. It's a weird name for a delicious part of a cow. Many of there dishes are recommended for 2. Listen to them. Also, allow them to tell you how it should be prepared. It's a giant hunk of meat, and it cooks differently than a steak. So don't say medium or well done. Just ask.  5.) Bring a coat until May 25th. It was cold this weekend. And the back room may be full.  6.) Order the plate of cheese. Since you saw what we drank, I really don't remember the name of the cheese dish. It's just that. A giant plate of cheese. Eat it and shut up. You're welcome.

Highlights:  The empanadas were really yummy, and the chimichurri sauce is amazing.  I love to put it on everything I ate.  BYOB and the location in the cute Southport neighborhood are extra pluses. My mistake:  I ordered the Beef Vesuvio which was just ok - primarily because I like medium rare steaks and the Beef Vesuvio is thoroughly cooked with cheese inside.  Bad order choice.  The steaks (i.e. El Filet) look much better with the spinach mashed potatoes on the side (plus the opportunity to put more chimichurri sauce on).  The grill plates to share also look tasty (that's what I would try next time). The downside:  the place is totally packed with tables squeezed into every spare corner which makes it fine if you are the big group, but a little too much if you are trying to go for a 2 person meal.  I also found the candlelight lighting a bit too dark.",0.9794,0.732,0.197,0.072,0.5119047619047619

My server came by to check on our food, and I told him the steak wasn't that great.  He was kind enough to offer me a free flan for our dessert.  Unfortunately, the flan was also the worst flan I've ever had as well.  It was so sweet that my tooth was aching.  I can honestly make a better one myself.  My husband and I each had a bite and gave up.

I was assured by our waiter that they were baked, or ""al orno"", but when these crisped up, greasy suckers were delivered to our table, I was less than thrilled. Further, the beef empanadas didn't have the traditional raisins mixed in, and they served them with a chimichurri sauce - what?! Blasphemy!  Get those fried pockets of grossness off my table!

The Provolenta is like saganaki - the sliced red pepper on the top gave it an interestingly pleasant flavor. Now for the meats - everything was seasoned deliciously! The cooking times could have been a tad better - i.e. not even throughout and even though the middle was medium rare, the outer parts were a bit overcooked. But like I said, the seasoning on the meats made up for that. Everything was so flavorful! We had the Filet and Lomo Relleno. The chimichurri was amazing - I could dip anything in that all time time.

There were all sorts of things in play here that led me to the 3 star overall rating... We had a somewhat early reservation since it was a large party. We were rewarded with no wait when we arrived. Woohoo! The place was lit with candelight and the atmosphere was loud and fun. Definitely a romantic, have fun while you're here type of place.

Wasn't so impressed with their Lengua a La Vinagreta - poached tongue marinated with vinegar, garlic and pepper. It was rubbery and not very flavorful. I've heard that if done properly, it is supposed to be tender and moist. Right after this, they served salads for everyone. To be honest, I'm not sure why they even bother with this. It was the cheapest looking salad I've ever seen. Lettuce, two slices of tomato, and a few rings of onion. Splash vinegar and oil over it and some pepper and enjoy! Seriously? My main course was the Bife Vesuvio - grilled prime steak slice and filled with spinach, mar del plata cheese and garlic in a white wine sauce, accompanied with argentine style potatoes - supposedly their second most popular dish behind the ""El Filet"". Ok. This thing was a huge portion. The marinade was very tasty. The spinach and cheese filling was very tasty. The downside was the steak itself. Not very tender, and even rubbery in some areas. The marinade and the filling definitely saved it from being disappointing to me. The steak was served with Argentinean style potatoes that were really awesome (I wish I could have eaten more of them). We tried some dessert as well. I tried a little bit of their flan and German chocolate cake. Both were pretty run of the mill. Not great but not bad either. As a side note, a few friends who had the El Filet said they really liked it. One friend that tried their salmon dish said it was decent. Another friend that tried a chicken dish was pretty disappointed with it. For the price, it is worth coming back. It is a fun atmosphere and the food is decent enough.

We asked for the Lomo (for two) as our entree. OMG the dish is made for at least 3. You definitely get what you pay for and some. Attention meat lover's, this place is calling. Anyway we enjoyed the atmosphere and the food. I recommend going in small groups (4 people -- give or take) or with a significant other. Depending on your timing, if you go in groups, you risk waiting longer than expected. (It's really hard getting people cycled out of there when they are having such a fantastic time.) Hence, this place is pretty popular. If you are someone who hates waiting don't waste your time. Or, if you don't like loud and crowded areas, then that could dissapoint. For me, I could care less. I think if you love the Argentinian theme...then you will absolutely love it. Be open minded, and enjoy!!! Cheers!!! T",0.9914,0.77,0.192,0.038,0.5090811965811967

We picked up a bottle of wine, biked over... and found the wait was over 3 hours. I thought to myself, ""This place must be awesome!"" and couldn't wait to go back. Fast forward a few months. My bf and I decide it would be a good idea to to try again, this time right after work. We get in no problem and I immediately love the ambiance. The service was good, and the overall vibe was really cool. The important part - the food - was not so great. We ordered a mozarella, red pepper and spinach salad to start. It was mostly mozarella, and though the menu said ""fresh,"" it tasted like it was off the grocery store shelf. I ordered the filet, cooked medium, with mashed potatoes. My bf ordered lemon chicken with Argentine-style potatoes.  My steak was NOT GOOD. The seasoning was good, but the steak was not cooked properly and was incredibly stringy and chewey. I ate half and could not eat any more- my mouth was tired from chewing. I had to saw at it with my knife in order to eat it. I probably should have just eaten it with my hands. My bf said his chicken was good, and I liked my mash potatoes, but overall this place did not leave a good taste in my mouth (har har). I don't get it. Nice ambiance, but the food is not worth the wait nor the hype. I think there are far better BYOB places in Lakeview than Tango Sur.

It's BYOB and we didn't know what would be a good pairing; so brought a bottle of red, a bottle of white (Billy Joel advised as such and I'm an Uptown Girl; so why not?). The candlelight and live tango music were sooo romantic. The vibe was less so, more of a party atmosphere; boisterous and loud. Which doesn't underwrite romance, but is however fun, as one feels like they are at a boisterous, loud party. 2+2 folks. My date was a restaurateur and wanted to try everything on the menu, so, accordingly, we ordered the menu. Even the server charmingly advised one or two entrees, not 6 plus items. I wish the menu was online so I can bullet point each tasting, and unfortunately my photographic memory is cluttered with literature, history, and film references, so I apologize.  What I do recall is the hot cheese appetizer- sweet Argentina makes saganaki?! But it was unremarkable and kinda greasy (yes, most hot or warm cheese is duhviously) and bland. The veggie and olives plate appetizer was good. As for the meat, I ate a lot of meat that night. And threw out over 15 pounds of beef leftovers. The potato and veggie sides were good.

For my entrée I went with the El Filet and the hubs had the Churrasco sirloin. My eyes about popped out when our food arrived, there were not one but TWO filets sitting on my plate staring back at me accompanied by the scrumptious spinach mashed potatoes. Hubs had been drinking a few rounds of whiskey cokes by the time we ordered and ordered his sirloin rare.

All was going well until a fellow diner pointed out I had meat juice running down my chin like some sort of ravenous neanderthal devouring his former neighbor.  At that point I realized I had to actually be mindful of my table manners despite being made ravenous by the nearly hour-long wait for a table on a Wednesday night. The food is very good.  The wait is excessive but likely unavoidable for most people, although making reservations and going in a group of six or more seems to greatly reduce the chance of a long wait.  Once you're seated, the food does come at a reasonable pace.  Not speedy, but not super-slow.  It would be more romantic if it wasn't Friday-night-bar-noisy in the dining room. Overall, I am a fan.  The staff, the food and the general environment are all very nice.  The only two things they could improve in my mind are to replace forks like a fine dining restaurant would do instead of putting dirty forks onto the table and install some sort of sound-absorbing material to keep the noise level to conversation-capable levels. The wait time is more a function of their immense popularity than it is anything else.  All the other restaurants on Southport last Wednesday night were practically empty - none were over half full, while Tango Sur packed them in all night.  That alone should tell you the experience and food is worth the wait.",0.9851,0.828,0.141,0.031,0.5191830065359477

I should start out by saying that I have no issue with the staff (friendly, attentive), or the atmosphere (loud, but not too loud), and I like the menu focus (meat). Our first visit to Tango Sur was with friends.  My fiancee had the eggplant parmesan, which is an an entree sized appetizer...she said it was good.  I had the bife vesuvio at the behest of one of our dining companions, and to this day I cannot understand why so many people rave about this dish.  Sure, the steak is big, but it is super fatty/grissly, and is heavily saturated with oily cheese...not my idea of fine dining The next time back, I had the El Filet...better, but the butchery of the steak was cockeyed, and the meat was not tender at all.  At that point it was strike 2, and I didn't think we would be coming back.  Lo and behold, a few months later, the same friends want to go back, I begrudgingly agreed to a return trip. This time, my fiancee got the crap dish, and I finally found one worth coming back for.  I split the tabletop grill (para dos) with one of our guests, and it was awesome.  Blood Sausage, awesome.  Sweetbreads, way awesome. Skirt steak, awesome.  I will be returning for the Para Dos, perhaps even the Para Uno, if my adventures were to bring me here alone. P.S.  The bread is lights out delicious.  Oh, and the salad is humorous (its always funny when someone orders one on the side for $5 then realizes that they only get 2 pieces of undressed romaine lettuce, a ring of onion, and a slice of tomato).",0.9969,0.764,0.21,0.026,0.5373123123123122

2010-01-31,5.0,"As a former vegetarian, I'm always very conscious that a steak comes from a beautiful living creature. So I want to respect that lovely cow by making sure I'm really thankful for the meal that I am eating. Nothing is more heartbreaking to me than to bite into a mediocre steak knowing that an animal gave up its life (albeit unwillingly) for no good reason. So imagine my delight upon dining at Tango Sur. This place is meat-tastic! Now I know someone's going to be all ""it's not free-range, grass fed blah, blah, blah"" and I get that this is probably a more important factor in respecting the cow than just the oh-my-god-it's-delicious part. But then feel free to write your own review. I will now proceed with mine... I came here on a Thursday evening around 6-ish. I was meeting a group of 5 and we were seated immediately, though not everyone was present. I'd have to say that if we tried this about 30-45 minutes later, we'd have been met with resistance. The joint was packed within a half-hour of our arrival. The atmosphere was charming and fun and I loved that we were going to be dining by candlelight! It felt very festive. We brought our own wine (yay for the BYOB policy) and we were brought glasses immediately. The waiter opened and poured the wine for us as we perused the menu. Bonus points to the waiter for being peppy, nice, and kinda hunky. We ordered an extremely tasty and cheesy-rific appetizer. Most of us then ordered El Filet, which comes with a salad (meh) and spinach mashed potatoes (also just okay). The beef, however, was totally worth the guilt trip I always feel when I partake in meat eating. Super mega carnivores will not think twice, I'm sure. This was one delicious feast!

Fortunately, they were still able to seat us because it wasn't too busy (it was a Sunday evening). We started with an order of empanadas (one of each flavor) which were not bad and came to the table pretty quickly. The dinner salad was basically just a plate of lettuce and tomato--nothing special. I will say that the chimichurri sauce that came with the bread was REALLY good. Very garlicky but addictive. Our table ordered two of the steak dishes for two people and all shared. After receiving our starters, the service was extremely slow and we ended up waiting an hour before getting our main course. The steak dishes were not impressive.

2010-01-17,4.0,"Reading the wide-ranging reviews of this place and weighing them against my own consistent experiences, I think it's safe to say this place is not only ""not for everyone,"" but it also seems to have some kind of learning curve. If you know what to order and are willing to follow other rules of thumb when dining at Tango Sur, you're going to have an amazing experience. If not, you're probably going to be miserable! So, since my experiences have been positive and getting better each time I visit, try this: BYO: Don't forget the red wine! GO EARLY: 5pm. 5:15 at the latest especially if it's a weekend. Don't bother with reservations as they seem to get backed up whether you make a reservation or not. I remember at one point being told they only take reservations for large parties. DON'T GO IN A HUGE GROUP: 4 max. 2 is ideal. The huge groups are always waiting and it takes an enormous amount of planning and luck to have your evening at Tango Sur go off without a hitch, so don't bother. They have tons of 2 tops so you have the best chance of a smooth evening as a duo. APPETIZERS: Get a couple of chicken or spinach and cheese empanadas, but you will be plenty full and taking home leftovers so take it easy. STICK WITH WHAT THEY DO BEST: Argentinian Steak. That means the center  ""Chef's Special"" menu ONLY for entrees. Ignore the domestic beef on the right. Fish and Chicken eaters? Go somewhere else. Seriously. My favorite dish is the Vacio for two. It's a HUGE hunk of ""flap meat"" (i don't know what that is and i don't care) in 2 layers. Between the layers is some nice chimichurri plus more on the side. It's served in a grill with melt in your mouth sweet potato. It's not a steak house steak. It's going to take a moment to accept visually, but just try a bite and let your taste buds show you the way. Get it cooked Medium. Safe and consistent. The Vacio comes with a boring salad. Enjoy if you're hungry, but if you're not, then tread lightly. You have no idea the amount of meat you are about to experience.

I had a bite of Jason's Bife Vesuvio and it's a rush of flavors - I believe the Bife has cheese in it. Not my cup of tea but still good nonetheless.

It's one of the best values on the north side - beautiful setting (candlelit and bustling), good food and BYOB (no corkage fee).  It's no Morton's or David Burke's, but you can bring a decent bottle of wine and have an elegant meal for under $30 per person.  You get a basic salad and bread with your entree, and though the appetizers are good, you can skip that and save room for your enormous plate of meat and potatoes.  I order El Filet almost every time I go - you get 2 fillets mignons for $24.  I bring the 2nd home and eat it for breakfast. Great for groups - I think they take reservations for parties of 8 or more, just make sure you're all there on time.  It gets incredibly busy on weekend nights - put your name in and wait an hour.  Luckily there are a lot of bars and cafes on Southport.  This is the perfect place for a date - impressive but not stuffy.  Not great for vegetarians, they offer a couple pasta plates, but it's a carnivore's paradise, I think a vegetarian might be a little grossed out. They have a patio but I prefer to sit inside - I just love a dark and loud restaurant!  The staff is great, too.  Young Argentine men... one night we sat on the patio (in front on sidewalk) and after the place closed the 2 musicians that sometimes play inside sat with us and we had a great time. I wish they would sell the t-shirts that the staff wears!  I tried to buy one a few years ago and they weren't for sale.",0.9952,0.734,0.216,0.051,0.615329218106996

Honestly, I wouldn't have such a problem with the place if it weren't for the wait.  I recall there are some tasty empenadas on the menu.  BYOB is always nice.  My problem with the restaurant lies in the staff's inability to gauge wait time, move tables, and control their customers. Case in point, there was a party of 10 that arrived just ahead of us with one raving lunatic of a woman who was insisting she made a reservation, and was very clearly lying her Citizen jeans off.  They ran around and finally sat the party of 10.  That upped the wait time for everyone else by at least 1/2 an hour.  Those people should have never been seated.   Ok, I'm off my rant.  I'm never going there again, because I can get great beef stew meat at Paulina Meat Market cheaper and more efficiently.",0.9233,0.756,0.139,0.105,0.5266091954022988

I can't decide if I liked dining by candle light or not.  In a way it makes the restaurant romantic, however it is also very dark.  I think candles are very romantic when it's just 2 people, however sitting a foot away from strangers in a crowded restaurant takes away some of the romance.

I can imagine that it's a zoo on Friday or Saturday.  For those reasons, I would not recommend it for a large group. There just isn't space.  We did decided, however, that Tango Sur would be an excellent and uber romantic date spot.

We had already had salad and bread to take the edge off and were having a good conversation.  The food. Ah! The food. The food was delicious. My mashed potatos were green. I believe they included spinach. But there were so amazingly yummy that I didn't really care what was in them, or why they were green. I had the filet mignon. It was beautiful. Tender, melt in my mouth, and cooked just the way I like it with some pink on the inside.  My friend's meal was just as tasty. Both entree's were huge. I think between the two of us, we had the greater edible part of a cow. There are some items on the menu that are recommended for two people. But in my opinion, most of the menu can feed two people. We both had two entire steaks on our plates, and we certainly could have shared one entree and been plenty full. Not that I am complaining about having filet mingon again today for lunch. It is a little on the pricy side, at least for me. I am cheap. But, they certainly give you your moneys worth in amount of food.

I'd previously picked La Gondola and Indie Cafe, and it was her turn to pick. Maybe I didn't order the right thing, because I didn't love my meal as much as my dining companion, who gushed about her hunk (of meat, that is). Admittedly, no one can hold a candle to Joe's Stone Crab for a bone-in ribeye, but when I saw it on the menu, I decided to go for it. Filets tend to be too bland for me, and the ribeye gets rave reviews so I figured it would be pretty good. It's near impossible to have a bland bone-in ribeye, but that's exactly what it was. I substituted roasted potatoes for the spinach mashed, and those were like something from a school cafeteria. I didn't even eat half my dinner, but I wrapped it to-go, and it ended up sitting in my fridge for 3 days. I knew I would never end up eating it, so I tossed it.

The warm crusty rolls sopped up the remaining liquid.  We both ordered the 12oz. sirloin, cooked medium rare. The meat was very tender and well prepared, but with out the chimichuri sauce, lacked flavor (sirloin isn't the tastiest cut, but even some salt/pepper on top would have done well). And the meat was BRIGHT RED, yet there was no sign of blood which leads me to believe the meat is pumped full of dye at tenderizers like the steaks I get from SuperTarget when I'm in a pinch.  The roasted potatoes that came along with it were very good and tasty. The salad left a ton to be desired though - just lettuce, tomato and onion with oil and vinegar dressing. Maybe this is traditional? I don't know.  For the price it was fantastic - we got out for under $50. And it's the type of place we usually wouldn't choose to eat at.

They give you a ton of food here. It was mouth-watering. My friends ordered the filet with the red wine sauce - unbelievable. The best steak I've had in a long time. The sides are so-so.

When we go we stop by Tango Sur to put our names on the list, then head over to one of several nearby bars to have a drink and relax for an hour or so. Once they call, we head over and our table is ready right away. It makes for a nice, long evening. Just don't expect to be done with the whole experience in an hour! The food is amazing. We usually get one of the meals Para Dos, the one with the sweet potatoes. The steak is wonderfully flavorful, in a way that is unique from other steak restaurants. And the sweet potatoes absolutely melt in your mouth, yum! I've also tried some of their chicken dishes and been equally impressed. There is always plenty of food to take home.  Probably the best thing about Tango Sur is the excellent value. This is a rare steak dinner that won't empty your wallet! Add in the fact that it's BYOB with no corkage fee, and this place is really a steal. The ambiance is dark, lit by candlelight. However, I would not call this a terribly romantic dining experience. Tango Sur gets very, very crowded on weekends, and they pack a lot of people around tiny tables! I imagine this would be an excellent place to go with a large group. However, the food is so good that I don't mind being crowded!",0.9921,0.767,0.189,0.045,0.6290401785714286

My friend and I waited for an hour at a nearby coffee shop and another 40 minutes in the waiting room inside when we were finally seated. I realized that it was BYOB when I saw people started drinking while waiting. I was like, ""Dang it!"" before my friend went to the nearby CVS to get a bottle of Malbec. We ordered the pickled tongue for appetizer. I didn't expect them to give us so many of them. It could very well be an entire meal! We both ordered the mixed grill for two people and it came with sweetbreads, short ribs, steak and sausages - enough to keep us both happy. They were perfectly done but a little on the oily side because of the sausages. I would come back and just order the short ribs because it was SUPER THICK and juicy. Delicious! My only advice is to come early, before 6.30pm because it starts to be crowded after that. There is also not a lot of room to walk around on the inside and the tables are very close to one another. I would suggest to come with friends. If you want to come with families, Folklore would be a better place in my opinion.

2009-11-14,2.0,"I was looking forward to having dinner at Tango Sur after a long week at work.  We rushed from our parking spot 4 blocks away in order to be there on time for our reservations.  The guy at the door (who appeared to be more of a bouncer kind of guy, than a host) was snobby and short with me.   After a 45 minutes wait, we were seated at our table.  The quick water refills, patient wait staff and ambiance made me feel like I was in for a wonderful meal.  Sadly, that was about the only thing Tango Sur had going for it and is why they received 2 stars from me.   We got the meal ""Para Dos"" which is a variety of different meats for two people.  When I cut into the steak I quickly realized why the only lighting provided is candlelight-so you can't see the HUGE amounts of fat on the meat.  Every piece I tried to eat had large sections of fat.  There were 7 of us and no one took anything home with them because of it.   Needless to say, we won't be back anytime soon.",-0.7188,0.893,0.033,0.075,0.6685714285714286

Meat lovers, here is your destined haven.  I love steak, and for those avid steak worshipers, best believe that good steak that is cooked to perfection is hard to come across. Here at Tango Sur, they marinade their steak just the right amount of flavor--not too bland and not toooverwhelming.  I asked for the steak to be cooked medium-rare, and if I went to most of other places, that would have meant medium-well done which angers the living soul in me. Not here! They did as I said, and my $36 steak that they recommended splitting with my boyfriend was just the perfect size for two people with huge appetites.  The small portion of pesto sauce most definitely completed the taste. For appetizers, I was not disappointed one bit;  the empanadas surely exceeded my expectations. I've only had the chance to try the beef ones, but so far so good. Dessert was delightful. Don't contemplate about it. You'll regret not getting it. Two people for an enjoyable, romantic, delicious, satisfying, fulfilling meal = $50   (Note: Excluding drinks) If you've heard nothing but good things about this place, chances are that those people know what they are talking about, so do not hesitate to check it out. I was skeptic due to the hype at first, but now I'm a firm believer.  Love you, Tango Sur. Wish I could eat you every day. xoxo",0.9966,0.692,0.275,0.033,0.6632047071702244

We arrived on a Wednesday at 7:30pm and were seated right away (there were 5 of us). We brought three bottles of wine because they are BYOB with no corkage fee. Ordering off their specials menu was the easiest and I got the filet with salad and potatoes. My serving was HUGE and could definitely be split with two people. I ended up taking my one of two fitets home with me. The salads that came with the meal were pretty bland and I probably would not get them again.  My wife, a vegetarian, actually recommended we go to this place because she loves the eggplant appetizer as a meal. So she got that and I tried it and it was so good. Another couple that was with one ordered the dinner for two with sweet potatoes and they said their meat was delicious and I tasted their sweet potatoes and they were so good! They ended up taking a bunch of it to go also. As for the prices.

2009-11-03,2.0,"Maybe it was the place being mainly lit by candles, the lively tango music playng, or the room filled to the brim with laughter and jubilant conversation. It all was meant to give the patron the feeling of an intoxicating dining experience. But, when the pixie dust cloud fades away a few days later, you think back and angrily say ""Hey!"" I believe the cloud completely faded when I was eating my leftovers from dinner there and I was reminded of how much I didn't like it. I ordered the El Filet which is two filet mignon pieces in a red onion wine sauce and a side heap of spinach mashed potatoes. Let me make you aware that I mainly got this dish because of the raves about the spinach mashed potatoes when I was reading reviews on this place. This was the only dish that came with them. Ok, now that we have that established, let me then tell you the mashed potatoes came cold at first. My whole plate had to be taken back so I could get a hot heap of mashed potatoes. It comes back, I try them, and they are ridiculously bland. B-L-A-N-D. Oh and then the meat? I've always been used to a filet mignon being a very good cut of meat. Usually great texture, firm, and easy to cut. The two pieces of meat I had on my plate masquerading as filet mignon were mangy, rather soft with being cooked to med-well, riddled with grizzle, and rather difficult to cut. It took me dipping my pieces I worked hard to separate from the rest of the meat in my chimichurro sauce to be able to chew it. At $24 for this dish, that is just theft! I went with my mother who had the shortribs which she felt were salty, but took the rest home feeling I may still like them. When I tried them, not only were they super salty, but had even more grizzle than my filet mignons. What's up with all the grizzle? Cheap meat or bad butchering?? Probably both. They sure have a good pixie dust cloud floating about in there. Our waiter was nice, but the guy clearing our table seemed to be rushing us. Just as I don't expect anyone to hurry up with their eating so I can sit down to take my time, that shouldn't be expected of me to do for other people. As soon as we got up he pounced on the table clearing it off and taking up the paper while I was trying to put on my coat. I had to snatch my to-go bag before it ended up on the floor, or in his bin. So rude! I'd have to say the best part of my meal was the bread and my Inca Kola pop I had. How sad is that? When I was leaving I felt I would definitely be back.

We always get steak for each of our bdays and while this place wasn't your typical steak house, it was BYOB and I got to pick since it was my night. We went on a Monday night so it wasn't too busy and we didn't have to wait. I was a little nervous about how dark it was but once we sat down and got use to it, I found the ambiance perfect...especially when our food came out! We decided to do something different and experiment with the dishes that were reccommended for two people. I kinda zeroed in on the ""Vacio"" mainly because I had never heard of a ""flap steak""....yes people...""flap"". We asked the server to describe what exactly this was. For the next 3 minutes, he described with excited eyes, this dish. By the end of it, my beau and I were sold and decided to get it. I was a little nervous, cause while I am pretty much game for all kinds of foods and flavors, my boyfriend is not. Plus he wanted STEAK and we got something that sounded like the part of an animals nose and was stuffed. We had absolutley nothing to worry about. This sucker showed up on what looked like a miniature picnic table. It was huge and surrounded by a lake of herbed marinade and perfectly cooked yams. We were given two little plates, two knives, two forks, and ate away. It was perfectly cooked and the marinade was delicious.

They had 4 flavors: beef, chicken, spinach, and ham. Try them all. Oh, and they're bigger than you'd think. So, bring someone to share all the goodness with. In fact, all the portions were large.

So we went on a Friday night. Yes there was a wait and yes it was crowded, but considering it was a full house, the service wasn't as slow as I expected.  The place is small and very dark. There are candles on the table and it's a BYOB. (Guys: This place will score you some points with the ladies.) The food is fairly priced for the large portions that they serve.  I had the Bife Vesuvio, which was a large prime steak stuffed with spinach and cheese. The cheese melted so nicely, it was almost creamy. The meat was served with a side of roasted potatoes and what I believe was a chimichurri sauce. That plate was more than enough food for me and it was delicious! I HIGHLY recommend this place.",0.9811,0.835,0.165,0.0,0.630420168067227

2009-10-01,4.0,"C and I went on a date to Tango Sur last night.  Actually, we ate a late lunch/early dinner there about a month ago.  C had the Berenjenas and I had the chicken with lemon.  Both really good; we ate outside, which was perfect; it was BYOB and there is a handy store about a half block south; and, the service was very good.  Four stars for that experience. Back to last night:  Our friends had brought us a bottle of 2006 Norton Malbec D.O.C from Buenos Aires recently and we were saving it for a dinner at Tango Sur.  It's a favorite when we're in BA, which is often. We arrived at about 7:30 pm and were immediately seated (a Wednesday night) at one of the last two tables that were open. Tall lit candles established a romantic atmosphere, but the main room (i.e. where you enter) was quite noisy.  Fortunately, the second, larger room was a bit quieter, but the sound level was still quite high. The sounds of merriment.  The decor and atmosphere is very convincingly equivalent to restaurants in Buenos Aires.  Once I tasted the Malbec, I was transported 5,000 miles to Buenos Aires, where restaurants like this are ubiquitous.  Of course, the prices printed on the menus there are almost the same, but they are in Argentine pesos, so the cost is at least third less (i.e. $1 USD = $3.7 pesos). In addition to being seating immediately, our waiter was at our table almost instantly with bread and butter and to open our wine.  We were impressed.  The place is crawling with wait staff.  Okay, let's get to assigning STARS: Ambiance:  As I said earlier, visually, the ambiance is totally Buenos Aires.  Whoever put this place together is a Porteño or has spent some serious time in BA. Although I give Tango Sur a point for ambiance, there were a couple of disappointments. First, the music could barely be heard over the ambient crowd noise.  The only thing we could hear, seated by the window, was the bass line, which is annoying.  Lousy speakers and not enough of them; what else can I say. However, the music was good and what we hear in Buenos Aires. I almost want to give them a point for that!  Second, the bread is served with little plastic packets of butter, rather than actual pats of butter. That's simply inelegant, for a restaurant of this caliber. Too bad. Third, and this is unfortunate, when they cleared the appetizer plates, they took the knife (good), but left my dirty fork (bad).  It was deposited exactly were I would naturally lean with my elbow.  A fresh fork is in order. Food:  The beef empanadas were good.  The papas espanola so-so. For an entree we shared the Lomo Relleno, which is a ""half slab argentine filet sliced and filled with a chimichurri, ham sauce then cooked and served on a grill with portabella marsala.""  ($36, serves 2).  The piece of meat was enormous; enough, in my opinion, for four, or there is no ordering desert. The gravy was simply divine. I mean absolutely divine.  The lomo (i.e. beef tenderloin), shockingly, was awful; the worst piece of beef tenderloin I have ever had in my life. C was in complete agreement.  It was stringy like you can't believe.  I literally could not chew 50% of what I put in my mouth.  When the waiter stopped to ask how we were enjoying our beef, we told him the truth. He looked stunned. We described the problem, which he could see as I was struggling to cut the meat with a steak knife.  He immediately said, ""one moment,"" and fled.  The manager returned and offered to order something else.  We appreciated the gesture, but declined, because we had had enough meat for the evening anyway.  He and the waiter were both very apologetic.  Clearly, this was not the norm.  We simply got a bum piece; it happens.  I don't know what the couple at the next table was having (it also looked large), but they were enjoying it!  Based on our first experience, I give Tango Sur a star for food.  I am sure that the lomo experience was an anomaly.  (note:  the menu states ""argentine fillet."" however, the manager conceded that it is not technically Argentine.  That they get beef from Canada and Australia.  Minor point."" Service:  I have seen other posts complaining about the service. There are lapses at all restaurants, but our two experiences here were positive.  The waiters were friendly, courteous and helpful. Certainly deserving a full point.  BTW, at the conclusion of our meal last night, the check arrived with a deep discount, which was very much appreciated.   BYOB:  another point! In summary, we'll be back for another try.",0.9951,0.798,0.13,0.071,0.46977138405329893
2009-09-29,5.0,"I took off of work early on a Sunday  so the GF and I could check out Tango Sur as word of mouth from the family who owns the place was extremely good. Usually I do not go this far east to eat but I made a exception for this encounter and I can say it was well worth it.  Parking was not really a issue, yes we had to park about 3 blocks away but I expected that from this neighborhood. We went around 6:30 PM so it was not crowded, the hostess was one of the people who I spoke to about the restaurant before hand so she greeted us with a huge smile and showed us to a very cozy seat inside as we did not want to sit outside. Something about heavy traffic did not appeal to us. We sat down and first thing we noticed was the lighting was very dim, a little too dim for my taste but it was perfect for a romantic setting along with the music which fit the name.  It is a BYOB so we stuck with just water as we do with most of the placed we visit unless they have margaritas for the GF. Our waiter was the hostess husband who I have spoken to many times, we looked at the menu and the prices are not bad for a nice evening out with your spouse or GF. We were thinking about trying the empanadas but before we knew it he brought us a complimentary appetizer which was freshly baked bread and a cheese spread covered in peppers which was fantastic. We both took his recommendations for entrees based on the meat we wanted to order. I order a Filet Mignon with Spinach Mash potatoes and she ordered garlic chicken since she is a big fan of garlic. The salads were comprised of fresh ingredients and while you had only the choice of oil and vinegar as a dressing it was not bad at all. Normally when a waiter comes to your table and splashes water every where you get upset but in the case of the countless waiters who came to our table splashing water as they poured I was not upset at all. As a matter of fact the GF and I found it funny and laughed about it for a while. The food came and my jaw dropped, I could not believe the portions they gave us! I had to perfectly cooked Filets and could barley get one down so I took the other one home. (Note: Do not bother taking the mash home, it does not hold up well) The GF barely made a dent in her meal and before we knew it we had to go containers right in front of us. We were stuffed and could not eat another bite. My GF read the reviews for Tango Sur before coming and was dying to try the Flan but just didn't have the room so when he asked us if we wanted desert we politely declined. As soon as he left the table she informed me of her desire to try the flan but the fact that she did not think she could fit it in. I laughed as he walked up to the table with a order of flan before she had a chance to finish her sentence. It was complimentary and I shared with him are talk and he insisted we should find the room to fit it in. We did, and let me tell you right now it was the highlight of the meal... I do not like flan but this made me like it and if nothing else was good about the entire meal we would come back for the flan. We left feeling really good about the experience and will be sure to go back. Thanks to Jenny & Edgar for making our experience GREAT...",0.9983,0.801,0.164,0.035,0.4942814625850339

The meat was juicy, cooked just right, and served in man-sized portions, I haven't had a more satisfying protein fix in town for the prices they were running at. The parrillada para dos was the best $31 bucks my friend and I ever collectively spent. The waiters bent over backwards for us, almost literally as we were seated at the FAAARRRR end of the long outdoor patio in a very tight space.  No corkage fee, A+ Tango Sur. As an aside: I learned something from this dining experience, restaurants have to open booze indoors before serving outside, so our waiters to walk indoors, uncork our wine, then bring it back. Another one to add to the list of confusing, pointless Chicago municipal regulations. Thanks Richie!

The meat was way overdone and to be honest I'd write more although I'm just trying to forget I came here. You'd figure for Chicago, the meat reviews would be on point... totally not worth the wait.

2009-09-20,2.0,"After reading all the reviews on Yelp, we went to Tango Sur on Saturday night for date night. I knew the wait would be crazy but we went anyway. After waiting 90 minutes they sat us right next to the door. So close to the door infact, that anyone who came in or out of the building knocked into our chair because we were so close. I thought, well, maybe the food's really good and I won't mind this.  The ambiance was fine. Candlelight... of course the wind was so strong and we were seated directly next to the door that our candle kept wafting smoke into my face, but I guess they can't control that... The tables were really close to one another. And it was very loud, which is to be expected on a Sat. night at a BYOB place but we spent most of the dinner having to listen to our neighbors who were seated a foot away...  I give them one star because the service was extremely prompt. Whenever we needed our water refilled the staff was there immediately.  The other star is for the food. It wasn't anything to write home about.  My fiance ordered the ribeye steak. He said it was okay, but that there were parts of it that just sucked.

2009-09-19,3.0,"So yes, I know that I'm not supposed to write a review if I didn't eat there, but as I have previously eaten there, I feel that I can still update it to say this. Last night my bf and I tried to go there for a nice dinner. I knew in advance that I wanted to go out, so I had him wear a nice shirt and pants to work. Then I got all gussied up myself so that we could go to Tango Sur. We were of course prepared for a wait as it was Friday night and having been there before/read many reviews, we knew what was coming. The problem was that when we got there, there weren't many people. We put our names down and were told 40 minutes to an hour. 40 minutes go by and still nothing. We go to the waiting area in the back which has zilch to do other than talk to the person you came with, which you can do just as easily outside. They don't seem to be too organized, so I insisted we go back outside so that they would actually see us. My bf spoke with the host not once, not twice, but THREE times and each of these times, the host had no clue who he was (I feel knowing your customer is part of being a good host and have never encountered that before). When we left the waiting room to go back outside, he thanked us for coming. We had to explain we hadn't even eaten yet, just moved back outside. While we were going back through the restaurant on our way outside, we noticed several large tables (by large tables I just mean lots of 2 person tables pushed together) being freed up. We thought we would soon be seated, but no. Rather than do what is right and separate the big tables for those couples who have been waiting a long time (there were 4 or 5 couples waiting just as long as we were), they chose to seat the groups of 6+ who arrived 30+ minutes after we did and put their names in. Not cool. After about an hour and 15 minutes, we left. We were super hungry at that point and I was getting crankier and crankier. We chose to go to Azha, another BYOB place (for we purchased wine to drink at Tango Sur) not too far away. They FINALLY called us to tell us our table was ready nearly 2 hours  after we arrived. It really made me angry that they so poorly underestimated how much time we'd be waiting. Frankly, we could've seen a movie at the Music Box down the street in the time that we were waiting for a table. It very much irked me that people who arrived later were given seats before us simply because they had more people and big tables were available first. It would be good business practice in that case to separate a freed up big table for the couples who've been waiting a long time. Needless to say, we were both completely disappointed. We took a chance with the Friday night (because they stupidly-in my opinion- still don't take reservations) and were fine with waiting 40 mins to an hour. No biggie. But the gross underestimation of time we actually had to wait was completely ridiculous. When they finally did call, we were already enjoying our appetizers at Azha. Maybe someday we'll go back, but never on a Friday night (or weekend night) again and not while we're actually pretty hungry. Totally disappointed I didn't get to have the wonderful food again, but frankly, when you're actually hungry it's just not worth the wait.",0.9772,0.847,0.095,0.058,0.38897863247863257

2009-09-17,4.0,"Last week, we had a chance to visit our Argentinean friends over at Tango Sur, located in Lakeview off of Southport and Grace, for some real-deal, holy-field, South American cuisine (the fact that lots of Argentinians eat here really legitimized it for us). This place is fantastic and is one of the Southport corridor's better-known, long-standing establishments. If  you haven't had a chance to visit this restaurant yet, or if you have yet to try Argentinean food, make sure to put this on your list of things to do. First, let's talk about the fresh rolls - they start you with a basket of six with lots of pats of real butter. and they're warm and soft in the inside, crusty on the outside.  They're a great filler while you're waiting for your food, which can take some time at this place.  In fact, we tried to pace ourselves but ended up eating all of them before the food arrived. Lois ordered the ""Milanesa De Pollo,"" seasoned breaded chicken breast, served with seasoned potatoes and a salad.  Delicious.  The chicken breading was crispy and flavorful (but don't ask her what flavors exactly -- she was really hungry and practically inhaled the thing) but the chicken itself was tender...the kind of tender you only need a fork to cut.  The salad was a perfect size with some nice onion and tomato and a do-it-yourself side of oil and vinegar.  The only thing that could have made the dinner better would have been more crispness to the potatoes. Clark ordered ""Milanesa a Caballo,"" a giant slab of beef steak, breaded, fried, and topped with two fried sunny side up eggs and served with seasoned potatoes. The beef was of great quality, and I don't know exactly what they do to the meat, but I'm pretty sure they prepare it with a dry rub of spices and flavors, making this a great tasting meal, but a little on the dry side. The only thing that would make this dish better is if they served it with a side of some kind of pouring or dipping sauce. The sunny side up eggs were a nice touch to this dish. I guess the yolk could potentially be the dipping sauce, but it was not satisfying or what I was exactly looking for in a dip. The yolk was just too bland and not what this steak needed, but it did provide the moisture to take half of the steak down without choking. The potato ""wedges"" are quite excellent, seasoned with who knows what, but I detected a little bit of rosemary in them, and proportion wise, it was good, they didn't over do it with quantity. I didn't even get to finish my potatoes, due to such a big portion of steak. I figure next time, I won't go for the breaded steak but the big hunk of beef that the guests at the next table had. It was a giant roast of meat set on a constant burning flame, and it looked j-u-u-u-u-u-icey! It was also surrounded by constantly-sizzling vegetables.  Basically, the ultimate dinner for two, or three, maybe even four. A friend had told us that he and another friend ordered this dish before and these two burly meat loving men couldn't even finish it. The guests who ordered this at the table next to us, a man and a woman, looked defeated even after consuming about half of the chunk of meat. Other things to know....this place gets crowded fast and early (we were there at 5 and it was filling up), but it's a little better in the summer because they have some nice outdoor dining space in the front of the restaurant and the Argentinean grocery store next door. Tango Sur is also BYOB, but if you don't come prepared there are plenty of places to grab a bottle or a six-pack in the area. Finally, if you still have room for dessert afterward skip the selection at Tango and head a few doors south to Sensational Bites.  This dessert cafe has an overwhelming selection of sweets and a few choice coffees to go along with them.  Lois loves the peanut butter cupcake (chocolate cake, peanut butter-buttercream frosting) while I'm a fan of the Boston cream cupcake. Tango ended up costing a little over $40 with tip and Sensational Bites about $7 for the two cupcakes.  A little more extravagant than our usual, but worth the spend.",0.9987,0.837,0.148,0.015,0.5560975609756098

SERVICE Slow, so slow. Something as simple as bringing out the salad after the appetizers took a long time. We sat there staring at the crumbs on the empty table for a very long time (the crumbs from the crumbly, unsubstantive bread that is provided), of course all the while making sparkling conversation, not JUST staring at the dumb crumbs in silence...  We saw waiters with salads whizzing by and placing a ton of them on other tables, but not ours. We thought maybe our meals didn't come with the salads. No. It just took about a half hour to get after our appetizers.  And then it was another long wait for the food. My water glass stayed low throughout the night with our waiter no where in sight to ask for more. FOOD Not so great. Not impressed. At first, you're excited b/c it LOOKS great. The portions look HUGE and flavorful. But while the steaks are large, they were all tough (and we ordered ours medium-rare). We all needed to drown it in chimichurri sauce to try and compensate.

Proveleta - It's a pile of melted cheese with roasted peppers and oregano.  What's not to like?!?!

Having been to Argentina, I find the food to be very authentic and it does live up to all the hype.

Sometimes a lot, sometimes a little. But one of the few things that can always take me back is a good Argentinean steak. On a nostalgic whim, another BsAs aficionado and I got a group together for some porteño cuisine.  For starters, I was exceptionally impressed with how quickly we were seated. Score one for eating out on holiday weekends!! Our table of 5 was seated less than half an hour after putting our name in. We were expecting to wait at least an hour or two, so it was a very pleasant surprise. I liked that they took a cell number with the name so, had the wait been anything like we'd anticipated, we would have been able to wander freely until the table was ready. The menu options could not have been any more authentic if they'd copied it directly from La Chacra!  Empanadas, jamón crudo, ensalada rusa, milanesa (even a la Napolitana!), and endless cuts of delicious, delicious beef. The authenticity of the dishes, however, is the only reason I wouldn't call Tango Sur a 5-star choice.  Our group ordered empanadas to start ($2 each, sold individually so you can get any combo of flavors you like). They were tasty, but very deep fried and much smaller than what I expected for Argentinean empanadas. We also had some fresh-baked bread that was incredible! Because we couldn't stand to wait for the main course to taste a little chimichurri, we asked for some to go with our bread which they brought out in a soup bowl. Holy chimichurri!! It was delicious and ever-so-plentiful. We were also comped salads (perhaps because of ordering in Spanglish? who knows), which was a nice touch. For the main course I had the Bife de Chorizo, which was excellent but a far cry from the quality of beef I'd been dreaming of. Solo en BsAs se puede comer asi.... Diners of eggplant and chicken at our table all seemed very content with their dishes as well. Our waiter was very attentive and fun, playfully alternating between Spanish and English right along with us.  All this paired with Malbec from Mendoza (BYOB!), and this was the perfect trip down memory lane.

Maybe a tomato or onion on the side...I don't even remember. It was less like a salad and more like a spread of optional hamburger toppings at a backyard cookout. The Argentinians were clearly mocking the formality of serving a salad prior to the main event.

2009-06-22,5.0,"A little celebratory get together calls for a lovely dinner on a beautiful and very humid evening. When my friend suggested this place for dinner, I was pretty psyched. Tango had been on my bookmark list for months. Our wait was almost 2 hours. We expected this and were prepared with some ideas. To rehydrate and kill some time, we went down the street for a drink. In no time, we were seated outside for an enjoyable dinner.  Big thumbs up to this BYOB establishment. Our waiter was quick to give us our water and wine glasses for our bottle as soon as we sat down. As busy as it was that night, we had such great service. We had one main waiter, but other guys kept stopping by asking us how we were doing. I think it was because we kept taking a ""breather"" between bites. I regret my attire choice that evening. It's definitely a wear-something-stretchy- kind of place. (Just kidding.) I would skip the bread and butter. I love the stuff but I cannot handle all that and save room for appetizer, salad, and main dish we ordered. We started with the eggplant in a vinegar / garlic sauce. It was a big appetizer and was easily divided up among three people. The sauce was spot on. It was creamy almost like alfredo sauce. I'm not very good at describing but hopefully you get the picture. The salad was a-ok, but at least we got some fresh veggies in with our meal. Next came the bife vesuvio. Holy hell. This was probably one of the best steaks I have eaten, and I don't eat steak often. It's stuffed with spinach and cheese (exact name escapes me) in a white wine sauce. The steak also comes with chimchurri (sp?) sauce, which I think I could have taken that as a shot because it was delicious. We asked for more chimchurri and were given a cup size of the stuff. See? Great service. Since I shared the steak dish, I don't think I would have made a dent with that had I ordered it on my own. Desserts...yes, desserts. As in more than one. As in, we couldn't decide on just one when he brought out a plate full of goodies. We went with the flan and this peaches and cream cake. I think I was in the early stages of a food coma because I can't remember the name of this one. It was made of some sort of yellow cake topped with a whipped cream and peaches filling. It melted in my mouth. The flan was good but really sugary sweet....well, I'm really particular about flan only because I judge every one I've had against my mom's. My mom makes some serious kick-ass leche flan. This one was good, but I've had better. ;-)  Good company, good food, and nice weather (minus the humidity)  makes for a fun dinner night out.

Their food is really good(I like the steak with spinach/cheese in the middle) or el filet the most within their menu.  Here is the reason for only 1 star though... This Sunday we were there with a party of 7, seated inside. We had a reservation, or we thought we did, but when we got there they said they could not find the reservation. Just because we were lucky, another party was leaving at that time, so they were able to seat us. We brought our wines, and were enjoying the appetizers(I personally like the eggplant one), then I felt something crawling on my hand... When I looked down on my napkin, I saw a 3 inch black round cockroach type of bug on top of it, which was really unexpected. I like outdoors and camping etc, so I am used to bugs, but this is my first encounter within a restaurant. In order not to freak out the ladies on the table, I wrapped the thing with the napkin, and took it to the manager type outside(he's the one with the pony tail). Told him what happened, and went back to my table. On his way back, arrogant son of a gun(aka. the manager type pony tailed guy) stopped by at our table, and without even apologizing, said something like, ""Oh this is the summer time, door's open, these small bugs come in, there is nothing we can do about it, etc."", which really pissed me off. 1- it's was not small by any means 2- he did NOT assume responsibility for something he should be controlling 3- I am pretty sure that leaving the door open for a restaurant, which is his argument, is not allowed exactly because of this within the health code. Therefore, even though I like their food a lot, I wont be able to go back there for quite some time, simply because of the way they handled this situation.

The Provoleta (fried provolone with roasted peppers) tasted more like Mozzarella, but it made for a great combo with those peppers.

There was nothing terribly fancy about the salads, but that did not bother me a bit, I was trying to save room for the steak.  We all ordered the same dinner, El Filet. Our dinner plates arrived and looked so amazing. They came with two rather large filets, at least ten ounces each, by my estimate, and some green (very green!) mashed potatoes. The potatoes were so good, whipped with spinach (hence the green), garlic and Parmesan cheese. The filets were tender, juicy and full of flavor. Au jus covered the plate, and added a little extra zing to the steaks. I loved it. Tango Sur is everything David Burke's Primehouse is not.

First of all, anyone complaining about how small the place is needs to go to Denny's where you get all the space you want.  Everyone in the US is so obsessed with having their personal space everywhere.  If you want personal space, stay home! Now that my little anger is out of the way, let me tell you why I love this place. BYOB is usually a sushi place thing, but this is brilliant.  You're not stuck to only the drinks they have to offer.  Bring whatever the heck you want.  Not to mention how that keeps the meal price reasonable, as most restaurants mark up alcohol prices but at least 100%, if not more. Speaking of prices, this is one of the cheaper steakhouses you'll find, especially when compared to the quality of the meat.  Most of the meat, if not all of it, actually comes from Argentina.  It's very good quality meat, and it's prepared really well.  If you want to try different types of meats, go for the parillada.  Keep in mind though, the parillada for two, is enough for three or four people, especially if you get appetizers, which you should. The best of the appetizers has to be their empanadas.  All of them are delicious, but my favorite are the spinach and cheese empanadas.  Also, their spinach mashed potatoes are very good. This place is really good, so you will wait if you go there for dinner, especially on the weekend.  You can only get a reservation if you have a party of more than 6, otherwise, you'll wait.  If you go with the expectation and knowledge that the wait is an hour or two, then you'll have nothing to complain about.  There are a ton of places along Southport to chill at while you wait, and they will call you when your turn comes.  So you don't have to stand around and wait by the restaurant. Most of the time when we go there, we inadvertently start talking to someone at a table next to us, and they're always foreign, from a Spanish-speaking country, mostly South America.  To me, this says a lot about the place, where you always find ""natives."" The staff is super nice and friendly, and authentic.  There are plenty of servers, so you never have to wait around too long for them to pay attention to you.  Also, ladies, they're not too bad to look at for the most part.  Hey, I'm just saying :)",0.9974,0.819,0.168,0.013,0.5920123456790124
2009-05-22,4.0,"Two words: absolutely fantastic. BYOB? I wish more restaurants in San Francisco were BYOB. Anyway..... We ventured over to Lakeview for this gem of a restaurant from a recommendation of a friend that lived in Chicago for 6 years. Tango Sur is, hands down, the best restaurant that I've been to in Chicago so far. Granted, I've only been here for 24 hours.  We had the empanadas (my first time!) with spinach and cheese, and beef. The spinach and cheese empanadas came highly recommended by the waiter, but to my surprise, both me and the boy preferred the beef. Regardless, the empanadas = fabulous. They were fried, but the dough was light and perfectly crisp. The waiter took the time to walk us through the history of empanadas, which was appreciated. The name of the steak for 2 that we ordered escapes my mind, but it's safe to say that if you say, ""I want the steak for 2 with all the yams around it,"" the waiter will understand. It's marinated and surrounded by a DELICIOUS chimichurri sauce that I repeatedly scooped on to my sweet potatoes. Warning -- the portions of this steak are HUGE. 22 ounces. Yowza! The only reason why I give Tango Sur 4 stars instead of 5 is because our silverware was repeatedly dirty. And by dirty, I mean that there was leftover spinach on our forks. Yuck. If it's warm in Chicago, take advantage of the outdoor seating - it's perfect for people watching. For out of towners, please do NOT miss Tango Sur.

Not a problem, we just went down to a bar and had a few drinks. They take your cellphone number to call you, which I first thought was great, but discovered a flaw in the plan. We were under my friend's name and they called it at some point and either a) someone else had this name or b) said they were my friend and go seated. When we left the bar to check on our name, they said they had already seated us. We then waited another hour until we were seated. The dining room is packed with people and you will probably sit very close to another group. The walls are decorated with nice posters, albums, and murals of Argentinian culture. Our waiter had a very thick accent and it was difficult at times to not only understand him but just hear him in all the noise. We didn't peruse the menu long b/c we were starving, but luckily we all found something right away. I had the bife visuvio, which was a piece of butterflied steak filled with cheese and spinach. I will admit the steak was good and Tango Sur is BYOB so we had some good wine too. Unfortunately, I found the service to be so-so, the plating is very rustic and can come off sloppy, and our desserts weren't anything to write home about.

Tango Sur is a fantastic place to light that romantic fire. Warning: the following is going to sound cheesy: dimly-lit candlelight dinner. Not many places pull this aspect of a romantic dinner off as well as Tango Sur. But what's romance without a little cheese? And what's the next need to a romantic dinner: tasty food. Well, Tango Sur is definitely not lacking in the food department. Tango Sur is a meat-lover's dream (do not bring a vegetarian to this restaurant!) - a restaurant which does not shy away from cooking a rare steak! In this day and age - what, are they crazy? Plus, it's a BYOB restaurant...which I hear makes it even more romantic!  What's this place missing, you wonder? Seating. You will probably wait for a table on a weekend.

I dipped the bread in butter. We got service pretty much right away, but were only given water and menus. Once they found out we were waiting for two others, the service dropped. But they were crazy busy. It was a nice night, about 60 degrees, and the patio was packed, as well as the inside of the place. It had a great ambiance, darkly lit inside and very cozy.  Once our other friends got back, we got service right away. Finally some silverware! And, an appetizer. The baked cheese with red peppers. Oh, yum. Did I say that I love baked cheese? The entire table was in love with it. I mean, you can't go wrong with cheesy goodness. The salad that comes with your meal is basic. Lettuce, tomato and onion, and they give you oil and vinegar to dress it. It was lame. I love an oil and vinegar dressing, but I don't like raw white onions, and the tomatoes were gritty. Ew. We had a nice break before the main course, which was awesome. I don't like rushed service.  The entrees were all delicious. I had the bone-in rib eye, my friends had the lomo, the beef vesuvio and the filet entrees. We shared all of ours, and there wasn't a single thing that tasted bad. The spinach mashed potatoes were so so good, and my friends beef vesuvio was probably the best out of the table. My rib eye was cooked perfectly, and our portions were so huge that we all had enough for a big lunch the next day. A great experience. I can't wait to come back and try other things.

I am adding this review because I want to testify to ti's authenticity.  I spent winter break from law school in Argentina ""studying abroad"" - AKA enjoying summer in the southern hemisphere, gawking at the world's most beautiful women (Brazil Schmazil), eating steak almost every night for insane, ridiculous, almost criminally cheap prices, drinking LOTS of good Argentine wine, and not knowing how to communicate (I don't speak Spanish).  But I digress. Tango Sur is EXACTLY like a meal you would get at an upscale Argentine steakhouse. First, the salad (which one reviewer described as ""plain jane"") is identical to the salads that accompany most dinner entrees- onions, lettuce, tomato, oil & vinegar- that's it.  Second, the empanadas are crispy, flaky, tender, and delicious- just like the best ones I had during my stay. All of the fillings are delish.  Third, the MEAT. Skirt steak, ribeye, filet, blood sausage- all wonderful and all authentic. Chimichurri is exquisite. I want it at the table for every meal from now on.  But if you REALLY want to experience a true Argentine meal, order the Parilla. It's a small grill brought to your table, covered in all sorts of stuff like sweetbreads, intestines/ chitlins, sausage, chicken, beef- not for the faint of heart. You'll experience meat-sweats, your body will hate you in the morning, and you can forget about getting any post-meal action for a few hours, but it's worth it.  If you're reading this you probably already know how amazing Tango Sur is. Bring some wine and a date you want to impress. See you there.",0.9761,0.842,0.133,0.025,0.5254992319508448

During an economic time where most restaurants are begging for your business, Tango Sur only wants it, if you keep your groups to parties of 4 or less, wait outside for ridiculous amounts of time, and once seated - ensure you are nearly sitting in the laps of the people at the table next to you.  Sounds like a great deal, huh?

Me and my meat buddy could not even finish all of the meatness. And oh yea, the one vegetarian at the table enjoyed a eggplant parmesan-type dish and even she was satisifed. The service was top-notch. Our server made sure all of our needs were taken care of.

2009-03-18,5.0,"Dined here again over the weekend while I was visiting and I am so glad we squeezed it in. I have nothing bad to say about this place, I love everything about it. I actually think it adds to the fun when you have to put your name on the list and wait (and yes the wait can be up to 2 hours long) Once inside the staff is always excellent. You can grab any of the numerous staff around to give you a hand, even if it's not your server. BYOB makes it even more fun, we always seem to bring ample wine and if we can't finish off what we've opened we always share it with a nearby table (this has happened to us before where a table shares the left over alcohol so we happily continue on the tradition) Now for the food...its making my stomach grumble wishing I could have some right now! The empanadas are awesome! I've had all 3 kinds and love them. The salad that comes with the meals is simple but delicious, as is the hot and crusty bread that seems to always be on the table. I've had the Lomo steak and the El Filet and have never been disappointed by either. There is always leftovers to take home and it's always as delicious as the night before.

2009-03-13,5.0,"Lots of great things have been said about Tango Sur.  I'm a definite fan.  Been going there for the last 6 years.  There's always a wait, but if you come just a bit before the traditional dinner time -- say, around 6 -- it pretty much takes care of the problem.  Service is always great, and the food outstanding.  The trick is to get the Argentine steaks, not the American ones -- they do import the beef from Argentina, and you can taste the difference.  My fave cuts are vacio, bife de chorizo (has nothing to do with the Mexican sausage) and churrasco.  My boyfriend loves the lomo relleno laden with chimichurri and grilled portobello mushrooms -- but that is a dish for two. They also have the sausage -- chorizo -- very yummy.  And for appetizers -- nothing beats the beef empanadas (they're much tastier than all the other ones).  For those that have been to Argentina -- mollejas and and morcilla taste the same as there!!!  Pleasant surprise, because the actual steaks in Buenos Aires are still better than anything here... Hint: at the Argentine grocery store (adjacent to the restaurant) you can buy the empanadas... and the raw Argentine meat cuts to grill at home.  Great alternative in case the waiting line at the restaurant is too long and you're craving the Real Meat!  (They sell chimichurri there, too -- it keeps for a long time in the fridge, and I love adding it to various dishes at home). The only thing I don't like about the restaurant: when it's too cold to sit outside, you have to be indoors, and it gets way too loud.  Other than that -- it's perfect.",0.9961,0.759,0.202,0.039,0.5031623931623933

While there are many downfalls to this place, one being the awful wait, it is well worth it. The bread alone is almost orgasmic, but never fear because the meat is out of this world. Like I can't cook this meat at home and really isn't that what you should go to a restaurant for, something you can't make yourself. While it's nice to go out and eat pasta (which I love), ultimately I can make pasta at home. Please note that, I do not recommend this for a first date and here is why: Because this place is crazy popular it's super loud in here. It's in no part the fault of the owners, it's just that crowded.

All there food there is overall amazing though i had the short ribs and those came out kinda bland. for apps I am prone to the empenadas though delic!  The servers are attentive and nice some are more knowledgeable then others so if you have questions hope you get someone who is  knowledgeable.

Fish: I didn't get to try this, but two of our party got the fish.  Even though they were sitting right next to each other and got the same thing, the girl's fish was half the size of the guy's fish.  They comped us for something because of that, but it seemed a little odd that they were missing some fish.

My only complaint: there is a $5 sharing fee, and I don't really understand why because they didn't even put it on separate plates?

2009-02-18,5.0,"There are so many reasons why I love Tango Sur; where should I start???  I am so glad my friend discovered this place and invited me because my life would be a little sadder without it. The first time I ever went to Tango Sur was on a Monday night and the place was slammed! After going there more, I realized that they are always servery night of the week. If you do not like a loud, fast paced restaurant, you will not like Tango Sur. The atmosphere it dark, candlelit, and romantic, with every table so close that you could definitely touch the people at the table next to you; not that you would want to, but for the sake of description...  What adorns the romantic atmosphere are the beautiful people, called waiters that glide around the restaurant. Ladies (and fellas too), this restaurant has some of the most beautiful men working as wait staff that I've seen in the city of Chicago.  So down to business...One of my favorite things about this restaurant is the warm bread they give you as soon as you sit down. The rolls are so fresh. Perfectly crusty on the outside and soft on the inside. I could just eat bread here. For appetizers, I would recommend any of the empinadas. The garlic oil they give you with the empinadas (as well as many entrees) is fabulous! Entrees come with a salad. It's not your run of the mill salad; it's lettuce, two tomatoes and some onions. You get oil and vinegar as a dressing. Simple, classic and perfect because a lot of people tend to get full on salads before the meal.  I always get whatever special fish they have because I don't eat steak, but everyone who I have come with who ordered steak found it to be wonderful. At Tango Sur, you really get your money's worth of steak. A favorite is the Filet mignon, in which you are served TWO filets and it's only $24. It's a steal! I've seen many people order the dinner for two, in which you get a hot plate of a variety of scrumptious meats.  I generally don't order dessert here because for one, I'm not a huge dessert person, and two because i'm so FULL and satisfied that I don't need dessert! But the dessert I have tried has been good. There's a peaches and creme dessert that is heavenly.  Tango Sur is a great restaurant with awesome Argentinian food. The restaurant has a great ambiance that is perfect for a date. The only downsides are that it is ALWAYS busy and the tables are close together. In addition, if you don't have a party of 6 or more to make a reservation, you will probably end up waiting. Try calling ahead to put your name on the list, and if you do have to wait, take a stroll to Jewel or CVS down the street to buy some drinks for dinner...it really makes time go by. However, everything you experience at Tango Sur, makes up for these downsides. This restaurant is a MUST GO!!!",0.9988,0.771,0.204,0.025,0.6047161172161173

I went on a Friday night at 7 pm with my boyfriend and my parents.  I fully expected to wait at least an hour so we had planned to put our name in and go for a cocktail at Cullen's a couple doors down.  The person at Tango Sur taking names told us an hour and a half wait, tops.  Perfect.  We high tailed it down to Cullen's and bellied up at the back bar happily sipping on our drinks and listening to the bartender rave about how good the food was.  Slowly, time started ticking by and before we knew it our hour and a half had passed and our stomachs were starting to growl.  After another half hour passed we decided to go down to Tango Sur and wait inside, thinking surely it was about time.  They have a waiting room in the back area of the place and we mossied on back there.  We opened a bottle of wine and waited.  And waited.  And waited.  Finally 45 minutes later for a grand total of 2 hours and 45 minutes wait I signaled for the man seating people and as pleasantly as possible mentioned that if a table wasn't ready within 5 minutes we were leaving, never to return.  Magically a table appeared, although the 4 of us were barely able to fit into the table because it was so close to the people next to us.  Also, the music was so loud we couldn't hear a word anyone was saying.   I will make the rest of this review quick as I was pretty loaded at this point and just hungry.  The empanada's were absolutely delicious, some other cheese appetizer we had was really tasty.  That is where the goodness ends.  Our meat was terrible.  Really low quality meat that was soaked in seasoning that was good but didn't hide the fact that the meat was so low grade.  Oh, and there was a hair in my food.   Just in case you missed it the first time I said it, I will most likely NEVER go back.  End of story.",0.8873,0.886,0.076,0.037,0.5082367149758454

I've been to many many Argentinean restaurants, and can honestly say, I've had much better.  The place is too cramped, we were sitting in a table right next to the door - cold air coming in with every patron. The wait staff was nice for the most part, but there was a waiter that didn't like us very much until we started speaking to him in Spanish, before then he seemed annoyed at every request for water we made.  The desserts were also not very impressive.  I will say - I LOVED the spinach mashed potatoes :-) they were delicious - I want more. I'd go there just for that... but given I don't love potatoes that much, there goes that.  With all honesty however - Please take my review with a grain of salt. I've heard many many wonderful things about this restaurant, it is actually too bad they don't take reservations. I am not the person to listen to when deciding to go here, since I don't particularly love meat - I'd rather have fish any day, than cow.  So with that said, do know that the waits are usually super long, they don't take reservations, and don't sit at the table near the door if it's open - it is super uncomfortable.  Try it... most argentineans I know in Chicago love it.... and that's enough for me... but I wont be going again - not really worth it in my book.",0.9926,0.699,0.212,0.089,0.5563661125199587

The fact that you're given so much food at such a low price almost seems like stealing! And because it's BYOB, it's really nice on the wallet, or my boyfriend's wallet rather. The candlelight and extra dim lighting makes it very romantic and cozy. On the contrary, it is extremely loud and busy. There's tango music blaring, and everyone is bumping into each other.

I have visited this establishment at least three times and everytime I feel very sick afterwards. The atmosphere is wonderful very romantic, and I love the music. The men who work here are handsome and nice to look at. The last time I visited the host kind of pissed me off. He was cute and had nice stye, but he was hovering over people trying to get them to leave so he could seat the other guests. I work in the industry and I understand the concept of turning a table. You should however be given enough time after you have finished your entree to digest and possibly order espresso and dessert. The host I am speaking of is the one with the black rimmed glasses. The other guy has worked there forever and he is very friendly. Anyway back to the food. The one thing I do enjoy is the berenjana (sp) a baked eggplant dish. I also like the provoleta, but when I think of what I am eating it kind of makes me sick. It is just a huge plate of melted cheese. The empanadas are good, but a little to greasy for my tastes. The chimichurri despite what everyone says is what I think makes me very sick every single time. Granted the flavor is wonderful but the oil they use is very cheap. It is def not olive oil. The quality of the meat is also kind of poor. It only tastes good because they submerge in gallons of oil. The thought of every piece of meat I have consumed here makes me nauseated.  Overall the atmosphere is pretty amazing, and the byob is a great deal.

But that's EXACTLY what I did on a blustery November night, contrary to my own impatience and beliefs on waiting. We put our name on the list at 7:30pm . . .and didn't get seated until 11pm. In that time frame, I could have already flown back home to San Francisco and be enjoying my own steak at House of Prime Rib.

I have never seen a more lazy group of people trying to prolong their stay at a table where all of the plates have already been cleared and the bill's waiting to be paid than at Tango Sur. After we were seated, I realized why the wait is as long as it is- because this is the kind of place where you're having such a great time that you don't want to leave, plus the fact that you've eaten and drank so much that you physically can't get out of the chair. The steaks here are PHENOMENAL, other than Peter Luger's in Brooklyn, Tango Sur is a tough one to beat. I loved the wine selection, because I got to bring my own! And no one knows my tastes in wine better than I do. Everything we had was absolutely amazing, the portions are shareable, the cuts of steak are hearty, tender, and cooked perfectly to order. My friend and I decided to share a steak, but I liked mine bloody and he preferred his medium (which is a crime in 48 states). Before we started throwing knives, the kitchen agreed to accommodate both of our requests on the same piece of steak, and so our friendship was saved. Not only did Tango Sur save our friendship, but they also saved our wallets, because the best part of the night was getting the bill.

The food is very good, and very well portioned, when reading the menu, the description of the items may all read the same, but trust me, what you get is very unique and different.  I have frequented this place enough, to know the Vasio is very good plate, for a dinner for two. The meal is great and comes with Sweet Potatoes on the sides. In many instances am pretty certain you will not eat all the food provided as its so plentiful.  The best time to visit this place is during the spring and summer nights when you can sit outdoors, the inside is very cozy and quaint, but also very, very noisy. You can go there with your significant other for a cozy dinner, but be aware, it's very loud, and tables are close to each other so, be prepare to share your intimate moment with your table neighbors. Best recommendations is to go there with a group of friends, have everyone bring a bottle of wine (BYOB) order different entrees, and appetizer the table can share, and also at the end pick the different desert to allow everyone to try something, the price is reasonable and wont break the bank. Once you have a meal at Tango Sur, be prepare to go back home, get on the couch and veg. Several times I've attempted to eat at Tango Sur and go down to the Bars on Southport and have been unsuccessful, as I am too full from dinner to go anywhere but home.  Things to try: The cheese & spinach empanada, their side salad to me is always lacking and I rarely eat. The Deserter Options are very decadent and Rich.  Things to know: Be prepared to wait for at least 45-60 minutes, during Friday-Sunday in the winter, and summer nights anytime past 6 PM prepare for a long wait. The cost is very reasonable, as you get more than what you pay for. Best Recommendation, go there put your name on the list give your cell number, walk down to the Jewel to get your wine, or stop by a local bar, and have a cocktail as you wait.",0.9966,0.799,0.176,0.025,0.5183952768099108

I've tasted many failed attempts at Eggplant Parmesan that are just put on the menu to be vegetarian friendly. Tango Sur really put some thought and flavor into this dish. The creamy tomato sauce was what did it for me. It was rich, but not too rich to where I thought I was going be paying for it later :) Vegetarians- please don't be afraid!

My review may be distorted by the fact that it was a great group and we were at various stages of drunk by the time that we got there, but I really had a great experience.  We had ten of us and since it is BYOB we had ten bottles of wine. And since my friends are super classy and some were further along the drunk spectrum, we also had a case of miller lite, a bottle of jager and a six pack of red bull - because that seemed like a good idea to a drunk person in a liquor store on their way to a nice dinner. They get a five partly because the staff was very nice and dealt with us well, considering I can only imagine we were a bit louder and more obnoxious than they would have liked.

2008-11-26,5.0,"um...this may be my new favorite restaurant. I went here for dinner last night and now that my meat coma has ended, I can finally write a review for it.  I went for a friend's birthday party here and we had a reservation, but were told the table wasn't quite ready yet. No problem, they have a waiting room of sorts with tables and benches where we sat and broke into our wine. Good thing we had all brought a bottle because we ended up getting sat an hour after our reservation time. Normally we would have been pissed and stormed out, but since we had a place to sit and chat and drink, we were more than fine. And the hostess was very nice about it, plus they sent over 2 appetizers on the house for our party of ten when we did get seated. We ended up ordering the exact same appetizers so that there was enough for everyone as well. We got the cheese which was pretty good (it's just melted cheese, people, but I do love it) and the eggplant dish which was super delicious. One of our diners HATES eggplant and didn't even know that she was eating it, plus complimented how great it tasted. We also got the empandas which were fabulous as well. Then, onto the entrees. Everyone seemed really pleased with their dishes (this may be biased due to the hour of drinking beforehand, but who cares). I ordered the steak that was stuffed with garlic and other herbs and had sweet potatoes. Thank God I decided to split it with someone as suggested. The thing was HUGE. And tasty.  The girls next to me split the other 'ideal for two' plate, and there's just looked like a giant piece of meat, but was no less tasty. Finally we ordered desserts to share: flan, german chocolate cake, and something else (i'm not sure as it was so good it never made it around to me before being devoured).

And almost everyone had huge portions as leftovers, except maybe the girls who ordered the talapia. It was amazing. Now, there are a few things that I have to share just so that no one is surprised by them: yes, it is very dark (I had trouble reading the menu but again it could have been all that wine before food), yes, it is VERY noisy (I could barely talk to anyone other than the people directly next to me), and yes, it gets very crowded (one of our party noticed a sign that said it was voted 'most romantic restaurant' one year and it caused us all to scratch our heads), but the service and food is so good, that it more than outweighs these. And yes, the salads were pathetic (we referred to them as 'hamburger toppings' because that is EXACTLY what it looked like ), but if you are going here for their salad, you're just an idiot.",0.9982,0.702,0.215,0.083,0.5647093744462166

OK, enough of the bad.  The good includes delcious red meat in many forms (mixed grill, el filet and lomo are some of my favorites), killer sweetbreads (not for all), awesome empanadas, above average ambiance (I happen to like dark and noisy myself, some may not), the best chimichuri sauce in the city,  the pineapple cake desert and the BYOB service is usually on top of things, bringing you an ice bucket for your beer, etc.  And when the kitchen is on and you bring the right wine, you simply can't beat it for a good, reasonably priced meal in Chicago.",-0.8636,0.766,0.102,0.132,0.5521164021164022

Anyway, we were finally seated around 10:45pm!  Our waiter, Martin, was fabulous.  I told him we waited forever and he comp'd us the provoleta (?) cheese.  It was melted provolone cheese and it was yum!  Between five girls, we ordered the empanadas - one of each.  I actually only tried the spinach one but it was good.  My girlfriends thought that the empanadas here were the best they've ever eaten. We also ordered El Filet and the El Vaccio.  I think El Vaccio was pork (I don't remember...maybe too much wine?) and of course El Filet was steak.  What I do recall is the the filet was very good. We ordered it medium rare and it was grilled to perfection.  The seasoning and sauce they made was amazing.  El Vaccio was huge but I wasn't as big of a fan.  For dessert, our waiter comp'd us yet another item: the flan.  It was a bit on the sweet side for me. We were all so full that it was hard to finish the dessert.  By nights end, we were all happy and thought the restaurant was well worth the wait.  The best part?  The entire meal only cost $80!  We were so impressed with the service and all the comps, we ultimately gave our waiter about a 30% gratuity.   I would highly recommend this place and despite a plethora of restaurants I still have yet to try in Chicago, I actually would come back again!  One final caveat though.  This place is really small, really noisy, really dark, and quite humid when there it's a full house so dress in layers so you can take off your clothes as you eat.",0.9961,0.815,0.162,0.023,0.551021021021021

2008-10-23,4.0,"I recently vacationed in Chicago, staying with my best friend (awwwwwww). One thing we discussed was going to a dinner somewhere that might be worthy of a review. Without hesitation he picked Tango Sur. I have experienced American steakhouses where dark wood and dim lights create ambiance for big steaks; and Brazilian steakhouses where meats (on swords!) are brought to the table in waves; and Japanese steakhouses where I get cranky if my Teppen chef does not transition the onion volcano into a choo-choo train. Tango Sur was my first Argentinian steakhouse.  No gimmicks, just good food. We started with what my friend told me was basically an appetizer ritual when he goes to Tango Sur: Spinach & Cheese Empanadas. Not to detract from the rest of the meal, details still forthcoming below, but the empanadas we heavenly. The entire meal was delicious, but the appetizers stole the show.  Luckily we ordered the appetizers and our entrees at once, so I did get something else to write about. I had the Bife Vesuvio - steak stuffed with spinach, cheese and garlic. It may seem slightly redundant to get something stuffed with spinach and cheese after the empanada, but I was tantalized by the garlic (I believe it was the only item on the menu that specifically listed garlic. What was a guy to do?). Ultimately it was the right order; it was delicious. The steak, actually, was fine. I feel like it was a hunk of flank steak or something similar -- tough and plain. It was seasoned perfectly so that I almost forgot how dangerously close it came to being dry. The stuffing was out of this world. I feel like garlic and cheese on anything is almost cheating, but I won't complain. I loved it.  We both ate an incredible amount of food, but it is hard to pass on dessert so we decided to split a slice of carrot cake. Even the dessert was great. It was slightly more dense than what I consider a traditional carrot cake, which was right up my alley.  We bought wine from the over-priced wine store across the street from the restaurant. Tango Sur is b.y.o.b. and they charged (I believe) no corking fee. As a practical matter, the over-priced wine from the store was still less expensive than it would have been off a restaurant menu, so take that into consideration if you go to the same store.  This was a great restaurant and without his suggestion, I never would have found it on my own.

I've had better.""  Wow. I have never seen the man enjoy a meal so much. And who could blame him? Tango Sur is the real deal with grass fed beef that will melt in your mouth and will NOT give you mad cow disease due to stricter testing standards in, um, every country in the world besides the US? The empanadas are delicious and are available filled with spinach, ham, or beef (of course!). Vegetarian options are also available in beef dreamland, with pasta, veggie, and fish dishes available for non-carnivores. Make sure you get the potatoes, whether they are spinach mashed or fried. Save some of your bread for dipping in the to-die-for aioli sauce that comes with the steaks. Portions are HUGE as most meals come with two fillets. I will never forget when my Dad turned to look at me with the joy of a 10-year-old boy with illegal fireworks and said ""You mean...I get TWO?"" Dad's pleasure was further enhanced by the fact that this place is a BYOB beauty. We even got up in the middle of dinner to go restock at the CVS down the street. That NEVER happens. Tango Sure has definitely become a family tradition. Also, contrary to popular belief, Tango Sur does offer reservations, but only for parties of 6 or more. If you DO have to wait, the staff will take your cell phone number so you can go hang out in one of the numerous bars on Southport.

I called on Monday to make a reservation for Tuesday and the dude on the phone told me to call back 1 hour before my arrival time on Tuesday and he would add me to the list.  So, I called back on Tuesday and did just that.  Well, by the time I arrived at Tango Sur, my name wasn't on the list.  I probably would have been pissed at that point, but the harem were all running late so, I added my name to the list and didn't fret.   Luckily once all of the harem arrived we were able to sit down immediately at a table for four outside.  As soon as I sit down, I begin to notice the guitar player return from his break and being to play his musica.  Yes, it's kind of loud and annoying and I didn't really appreciate his musica sitting right next to him.  I'm sure they could plug in an iPod and get the same effect.   Our server was .... pushy.  Yes, I think that's a nice way of putting it.  He was pushy because he asked us what we wanted to order three times before we even opened up the menu.  And when it came to paying for our meal, he came by eight times before we decided we should actually look at the bill and put down some credit.  Regardless of our waiter's eagerness to get us up and out, the bus boys were very attentive with our dirty plates and almost empty glasses. The meal itself was okay.  We decided to order the empanadas and they were very good... actually, the best part of the meal.  I suggest to order the chicken and the spinach & cheese variety.  As for dinner, Nic ordered the eggplant special appetizer thing (because she don't eat no read meat); Mon and Car ordered the Churrasco; and I ordered the Milanesa a La Napolitana which is beef breaded then topped with baked ham, mozzarella and tomato sauce.  I thought it sounded gross, ordered it anyway, and shockingly, found it ... edible.  But, again it was just okay.  I also had a bite of the girls' steak.  Mon ordered it med. rare and Car ordered it med. well.  Car's steak ended up being cooked well and was a little tough.  Mon's was a little too red for my liking, but she likes it red.    ...Irrelevant part of the review... Because we had a long dinner, I couldn't help but notice all of the Southporters making their walks home with Dairy Queen in hand.  I sat in my seat all night watching couple after couple after gay after couple after fat man with baby and skinny wife walk down the street with their DQs.  It made me want a DQ real bad.   ...Back to the review... So, even though I really wanted to love the Tango Sur, I just thought it was okay.  And it's not because I thought there was going to be all these hott Argentinean waiters around because it's an Argentinean restaurant.  I saw some cute male staff working, but am still giving it 3 stars.  3.5 if they had it, but they don't and I'm choosing not round up.",0.9886,0.805,0.127,0.068,0.4749664224664224

The service- FANTASTIC! Although the restaurant is as busy as possible, my water glass was always kept full and the plates were cleared ASAP(but it didn't feel like they were breathing down your neck). The restaurant is filled with attractive Latin waiters(yes I'm being shallow I know) who speak to you in a sexy accent!! Now the bad...........    Yes the candles are nice, however for some it would be hard to read their menu. In pictures the restaurant SEEMS like it would be uber romantic, but its so loud its hard getting a word in edge wise. Further more there is ONE bathroom per gender, which leaves a few women standing in line during peak times. All in all I thought the place was WONDERFUL and would definitely go back. I was sooooooo stuffed I didn't even have room to TRY a dessert(which looked DELICIOUS). If you wish to go during peak hours, be prepared to wait, ladies don't wear uncomfy shoes(as the waiting area is the side walk) or better yet, give them your name/cell number and go pick up your BYOB while you are waiting for your table.",0.9895,0.778,0.191,0.031,0.6726495726495726
2008-08-01,4.0,"I am running behind in finally reviewing Tango Sur, but I wanted to sing the praises of my experience at this great restaurant. I was in Chicago for July 4th weekend, often eating on the fly with a few sit down options taken, most that were just disgusting. Finding Tango Sur was a great thing. My travel partner and I found the place when asking around in Lincoln Park, and headed there on the detail given by the random person on the street, and how they looked as they recanted eating there... almost like they went there a moment and left the sidewalk in front of me.  lol The advice was good. I was uncertain about the place, as we arrived RIGHT at the time before the place gets busy, finding a place to park very close by. The wait staff was very good, with questions and the patience with the indecision of my cohort. The expediters and bus-boys very on it. Waters filled, and others wine bottles opened and served what seemed to be efficiently.  Being the only ones there when we arrived, the place was full by the time we were half way into our meal, giving a great ambiance to what was initially too quiet a place. I had 12 oz steak(rare) with the roasted potatoes. The steak was PERFECT, as were the potatoes. I am glad that I opted for them, as I have not been eating starches as often as I once did, so I had been reserved. They were worth the indulgence of carbs for sure.   The Empanadas before the entree were really good, but I would say that the included salad(a few leaves of head lettuce, a few sliced tomatoes, and rings of onion, with oil and vinegar as the only dressing option) that was with the entree was a bit disappointing, though I really did not need more with such a HUGE steak that seemed well over the listed menu weight. It was excellent and the seasonings of the Argentine influence were a nice change from the midwest traditional steak. The lack of a star to make it 5 stars is effected by the fact that veggie choices seem to be the only think lacking at this establishment. I will be back here, hopefully with a date vs a friend next time. One of the best finds so far on my exploits of Chicago.... which have just begun!",0.9979,0.753,0.204,0.043,0.5726846100759145

Some people experience a bit of culture shock when it comes to how different it is from the expected ""Steak/Meat Place"". Argentine  beef is known as some of the BEST in the world, these people really take their meat seriously. The enviroment and ambiance of the place is darkly dim, with  small candles on tables and they usually have various types of soft spanish pop or tango music playing thus providing a very romantic ambiance, ideal for a date or just a special night out with the inlaws (great way to impress someone with showing them  your sophisticated tastes). Beer is available but WINE is more suitable being that it does increase the dinning experience and flavors of the beef, but also can provide an even deeper more romantic or fun experience. Again Great for dates. Not only because the ambiance is right and inviting but because the food is also adequete. Order one of the special meet dishes , which come in their own small portable grill, with potatoes, ready to serve. its like having a mini grill in the middle of your table with a chunk of world class beef, surrounded with candles zipping on wine with your  significant other, sharing delicious TAPAS which are great appetizers and perfect finger food get a mix variety so  you can try different ones, also the eggplant salad is delicious. Budget wise it is pretty economical considering the fact you are eating PREMIUM beef, not just any Bull****. You can also bring in your own liquour since it is a BYOB joint, Bring a bottle of WINE, A girl, and about 30 bucks and you can call it a night out. Plenty of parking around and on site, IF you bring your grandma make sure u have her hold on to you, as it is very dim and she could trip and bust her ass. Cheers and enjoy..

The atmosphere is dark and gloomy, most befitting for a vampire. Illuminated by faint lighting and adorned by dark walls, white candlesticks centered on each table, and a cluster of old photos of Evita, Tango Sur offers up tender, juicy beef dishes in an atmosphere malodorous of death and creepiness. Even as the under-heated empanadas, and later the main course, were served and slowly filling the dining room with culinary aromas, the smell of old blood still lingered in the air. I did enjoy the filet mignon and spinach mashed potatoes, as well as the background Latin music, but everything else was mediocre, including the service, which was certainly nothing to boast about.  Despite the fact that I walked out feeling very full, the dining experience at Tango Sur left me feeling emotionally blue and melancholy. Another trip to Chicago will not be met by another trip to Tango Sur. One experience was way too many, I'm afraid.

Desserts blow and then check takes another half hour, at this point we are wagering on when condesending and worthless (this kills me to say this because I try to see the good in everyone......) waiter slaps down a check ...but does so with  not only corkage fees (not a problem) but an automatic gratuity.  So I basically took one up the ass for being with five friends and getting horrendous service.    Shame on him for being such a poor waiter when he could have doubled his grat since we all own or work at restaurants.  And shame on him for providing the worst service I've ever had and you know what, that is really a huge accomplishement because I've had some of the crappiest service in the world but he topped it, above and beyond.   While he may have thought he got away with something with the horrific service and auto grat, the bottom line is this: They lost a good customer base in all of us, He halfed his potential tip The busboy skated with an extra $30 for at least trying. The manager never bothered  The food was mediocre at best (I tried, I really did). I am embarassed to ever leave this kind of review, I really am,  but no one in that entire building seemed to care (except the table next to me) and isn't that what the service industry is all about?  Please bear in mind that the wait for the table did not bother me at all, that is not even remotely the issue here.

This being a steakhouse, you'll find meat preparation to be their obvious specialty.  Steaks for one should really mean two and a steak for two could mean six, but a meal of Tango Sur leftovers is just as good as the first.  Their salads are nothing more than a mere formality, but take a chance on their appetizers which range from extremely cheesy, to oily and garlic crazy.   The restaurant itself is cozy and charming with attentive waitstaff managing tables as a team.  Food is brought and taken away swiftly and you'll never find yourself with an empty wine or water glass.  Quarters may be close but that's just fine because you'll be too busy conquering your meal to eavesdrop on the diners next to you.

Although we were told the wait would be at least two hours, our table was actually ready in an hour and a half. The atmosphere is great - dim lighting, candles on the tables, etc. It is quite loud, however - so not exactly romantic, but definitely an intimate spot for a group of friends! The food --- we started with the provoleta (awesome) and a sampling of each type of empanada - I enjoyed the spinach and cheese ones, but not sure if I'd order them again. The boyfriend and I split the el filet, which is TWO filets in a wine/onion sauce with a side of spinach mashed potatoes. My steak was great - cooked perfectly, not fatty. The mashed potatoes are average at best. The best part, though - was asking for a side of chimichurri sauce on the side for dipping the steak. The chimichurri is out of this world! Just be prepared to smell like garlic :) For dessert, we had a rolled pound cake topped with the most delicious whipped caramel I've ever had. And the best part - we walk out of there for $25/person!

On to the main dish- I ordered the 12 oz which was cooked well, slightly fatty and heavily seasoned, but tasty.  My boyfriend went for the salmon and it was delicious.  I liked his better and made the switch at the half way point.  The portions were huge and they happily went home with us.   Really, I give it three stars for the portion to price ratio and the ambiance.  Great value but not sure if I'll go back again.",0.9935,0.805,0.188,0.007,0.48579846079846084

The wait was an hour long, and my boyfriend did nothing but complain about it, so we(HE) decided to go to D'Agostino's instead. I was so disappointed. But, they had taken our names down and wrote down our phone number and were told they would call us when they were ready to seat us. Good thing! We had just ordered our drinks at D'Agostinos when they called. It was only about 10 minutes later! Needless to say, I made the BF leave his pizza place for some delicious Argentinian food (and a MUCH better atmosphere). We were put in a waiting room where wine glasses were provided with seats all along the wall. We were a little disappointed about that, because they acted like we were going to be seated right away, but we were only in the waiting room for about 10 minutes. I am so glad we waited. I had the 12 oz. Churrasco. It was way too big for me to eat, but it came with delicious dipping sauce with olive oil, garlic, and parsley. Sooo good! My boyfriend had fettuccine, booorrrring.

We have had it before at a Brazilian friends' house, and we have never seen it anywhere else so we were SO excited that they had it because it is SOOO delicious.

So listen up... If you are seated at a table, and are finished with your meal...it is only appropriate to linger for 15 minutes MAX if there is ANYONE waiting for a table. If you proceed to drink your cheap wine past this period of time, then it is acceptable for the staff or the crowd that has been waiting for 2+ hours to physically remove you, and throw your wine bottles out behind you.  So other than the nearly 3 hour wait last night (which I will not fault the establishment for, as they are too friendly to tell people to get the hell out), the place was obviously...wonderful. Ambiance, food, presentation, service....BYOB! But, OY VEY...the wait.  Just take note, if you wish to drink your wine from home well after the meal has finished...GO HOME, or pick a less busy restaurant.

The not-so-goods: I burned my thumb striking a match to light our candle. Which they should have done but didn't. (But the burn's my fault.) The tables surrounding us were filled with self-important finance guys shouting over one another to be heard. We could hear them (very clearly) but apparently it wasn't enough for them. The salads that came before our steak were ridiculous: big pieces of lettuce, four slices of mealy, out-of-season tomatoes and a few pieces of sliced white onion. And bottles of oil and vinegar.  Maybe that's Argentinian tradition, but I sure didn't like it. And the bad: Our steak was huge (some people see that as a good thing) but lukewarm at best, and unevenly cooked. The spinach was nearly cold and cheese practically returned to its solid form by the time it came to us, and the potatoes were overcooked and dry. It just didn't live up to all these amazing reviews I've read. Which is why I'll give it another try sometime. Empanadas and some steak that isn't quite so complicated. And dessert.

2007-11-16,2.0,"the style of preparation will appeal to some; it might be worth a try given the general reception of this place on yelp: + intimate atmosphere (perhaps to a fault?) + outdoor dining pleasant even as it begins to get colder outside + very interesting and functional presentation of meat dishes involving small grills + no corkage fee - quality of meat itself is average at best - no reservations - often noisy my experiences there have led me to realize that their mode of operation is to take meat cuts of generally very ordinary caliber and deliberately overseason them, *perhaps* in the name of authenticity.  this is no greasy spoon steak, however neither is it one from peter luger's.  my dish during the most recent trip was the vacio, which is typically a tougher cut of meat (flank steak), whose flesh is beneath a couple layers of fat and nerve tissue.  these layers help moisten the flesh during grilling and provide, generally speaking, an impressive crust to the meat.  it can be quite delightful if only seasoned with salt, or perhaps pepper and a bit of ash (!).  what ended up happening at tango sur was a very, very strong melange of chimichurri, garlic, accompanied with a hint of flesh from the vacio itself.  you can scrape the overcoat and stuffing off the meat and end up with a considerable pile of overpowering flavor on the side of your plate--and then you're left with an unfortunately tough cut of meat with unusually bold seasoning.   the portion was big enough for three--reasonably priced to feed two people, but i'd rather spend a little less on something that not only fills, but fulfills one person. tango sur is quite consistent, however:  in the three times i've ordered steak from them, the medium-rare i always ask for was without exception returned to me as medium-well.  it essentially reduces the experience to one i, an absent-minded griller, can faithfully recreate at home at lower cost.  this sort of execution is not worth paying a premium for. the positive things i have to say about this restaurant are valid, but don't make up for a lack of what should really be the most important part of a steakhouse that's trying to make its name on a tradition of excellent meat.",0.976,0.846,0.105,0.049,0.5292465192465192

2007-07-22,1.0,"I went here last night and I had a horrible time.  We arrived around 5:30 and were sat promptly outside, which was nice. We waited 10 minutes to be acknowledged with water and menus. We waited another 10 minutes for the waiter to come by and uncork our bottle of wine. We waited about 15 minutes for the waiter to take our appetizer order (the provoletto, which is essentially a handful of provolone cheese, some cheap-tasting olive oil, a few strips of limp roasted red peppers and a hit of dried oregano, all stuck on a plate under a broiler for a few minutes).  The waiter falls into a black hole. About 20 minutes went by before we got greasy coagulated disc of aforementioned cheese. Said waiter has apparently found his way out of aforementioned black hole and only THEN takes our order for the main course. We ordered a HUGE steak dish for 2 with portobello mushrooms and then we sat.  And sat.  And sat.  Someone brought out our salads, which were the most disappointing and boring salads I have ever eaten in my life; it was cut romaine lettuce, 2 slices of watery tomato, and 2-3 small rings of white onion. It was served with oil and vinegar. I wasn't sure if it was supposed to have been a palate cleanser or what, but it was pretty much useless. I've had better salads everywhere else I've ever eaten. The two tables that had come in 10 and 15 minutes after us (respectively) had already been served and were making good progress on whatever hunk o' meat that was in front of them. Finally, I looked at my watch and figured out that we had already been there for over an hour, and we still hadn't gotten our entree. I flagged down a wary-looking guy who was having trouble opening bottles of wine the next table over and asked him what was up. He fetched our server (there HAS to be a black hole inside the restaurant somewhere) and the server came out, all defensive, saying that HE didn't make a mistake; the dish WE ORDERED has a 35-minute cook time. A 35-minute cook time? For a 16-oz steak, cooked med-rare? OOOkay... Then he proceeds to tell us that that was why he asked us if we wanted an appetizer, because that dish takes so long to cook. Um, he brought out our appetizer before he even took our entree order! So I call bullshit.  Twenty minutes later, we had our dish; an unappetizing hunk of steaming beef set in an oily sauce with a bullet of admittedly good chimichurri on the side. And it was cooked to approaching shoe leather on the outside, and on the inside it was well-done. Nowhere near med-rare. At that point, I was more focused on just getting the fugg outta there...and it was nearly 8:00. I wanted the last 2.5 hours of my life back. I felt like they should have paid me. I really disliked this place. The wait and inattention to service was so distracting. Good thing was, our bill only came out to a little over $50. I thought $4 and the change was reflective of the service, and, as a former waitress, I usually tip anywhere between 15-25%. Everything about this place was bad, from the uninspired menu to the lackadaisical service. Just awful, really. Had the food been outstanding, I can tell you there would be at least 2 or 3 more stars up there, but really? Nothing special. Greasy, oily...just not the right stuff. I would recommend not going here. Consider El Nandu on Fullerton instead; much better service, better-tasting food, and you won't be in a hurry to just leave and be anywhere else but there.

2007-07-09,2.0,"Went here last night on a double date.  So we shared empanadas (spinach and cheese) and cheesy eggplant (it's on the chef's special).  I thought hte empanadas were delish, however, not sure if I liked the sauce that came with it.  The cheezy eggplant would have been good it it weren't so salty.  Kinda disappointing, because it looked delish and it was a good portion for four people.  Then we all had seperate entrees.  I had the el filet, which was also disappointing.  Normally filets are tender and succulent, this was polar opposite.  It was chewy (even when medium rare) and grainy.  The portions are huge as I had two portions of meat.  However, I would have rather had one small delicious portion, than two mediocre, huge portions.   My bf got the T-bone.  That was delicious and flavorful.  Try that, if you are going to go here.  The fat content is higher, but it's def. worth the cholesterol. Then the other couple got one of the specials.  I think it was the el relleno.  It was a dish that is big enough for two people.  Once again, meat was tough and chewy.  It was a HUGE portion, but quality is always better than quantity people! Finally, the ambience was basically darkness with tapered candles.  It was hot and muggy, so I think if the lights were on it would just add on to the heat.  Not the most comfortable dining experience, I've had.   Overall, it was ok.  Not great by any means, but it's not going to break the bank either.  $120 for four people is a reasonable price for steak.  I just don't think I would come here again though.",0.98,0.834,0.127,0.039,0.6090626340626342

2007-06-18,4.0,"Tango Sur deserves some balanced reviews.  Let's start with why you go. As a steak lover, you cannot beat their prices for a tasty piece of beef. Not all the cuts are good every night. I would recommend asking your server which cuts are the best that evening. Although the steaks are not exceptional, they are quite good on average and at least $20 cheaper than a steakhouse. Also, the chimmichurra is delicious and, in my personal opinion, a much better compliment to good steak than a soupy-sweet tomato based steak sauce.  Now there are some things they should do better. The bread and dinner salad are stunningly boring. Like something you'd get at a diner along the highway in Oklahoma. The cooking can be inconsistent, particularly when they are busy. The service is inattentive. I give Tango Sur four stars because I love steak and appreciate the low prices. I don't go there for the uninspired dinner salad or crappy dinner rolls, so I don't let them get to me.

If you pay $15 or $20 per head and you save a bunch of money by bring your own liquors perhaps you cannot expect the decor, service, and food of a five-star restaurant.

Southport is an interesting neighborhood and Musicbox is right around the corner, but parking is a bit tricky at times.

Five of us walked in early Sunday evening and were seated right away.  I was concerned that they wouldn't have seating for little people but it turns out they are a very family-friendly place.  I found the staff to be very attentive.  Our waiter explained the difference between the beef offered on the menu (from Canada) and that offered on the specials menu (South American).  He was very helpful in recommending dishes. We skipped the apps. and just ordered entrees.  I was pleased to discover that entrees came with a salad but it did leave a bit to be desired.  It was iceburg lettuce with onion slivers, tomato, served with oil and vinegar.  If they had just chosen a better lettuce I probably wouldn't diss it at all.  But a salad is such a simple thing to improve upon seems an easy way to up their ratings. I ordered the Bif Vesuvio, medium rare.  This is, hands down, one of the tastiest steak dished I have ever had.  However, despite my temperature request, the meat was WAY too rare.  Actually, all of our steaks were significantly more rare than we'd ordered them.  I suppose it's better to undercook than overcook.  Had my son not been with us I would've sent it back for them to cook more.  Instead, I ate the ends (which was actually plenty) and took the rest home.  by the time I reheated the leftovers, it was cooked perfectly! The sauce they serve the steak with is super-garlic-heavenly (they gave me extra to take home with my left-overs), the potatoes were AMAZING.  Other than the undercooked meat, the rest of my family was also quite pleased with the place and have said they will definitely go back.",0.994,0.849,0.142,0.009,0.49138321995464856

This place reminded me of a place that a clueless high school guy would save up for weeks for to take a girl to.  In short, Tango Sur delivered an experience of: inattentive staff, the crappiest wine glasses I've ever seen at a restaurant, bread that was made with an EZ-Bake oven, and overcooked, poor-quality beef that is barely edible unless lathered with copious amounts of the chimchurra sauce. At 20 bucks for a terrible a steak, I'd far rather walk over to East Bank Club's restaurant (open to the public) and get their delicious delmonico for 8 dollars more. (personally the spread is even more favorable as TS was a 30 dollar round-trip cab ride from River North.) Personally, I try to frequent restaurants that are good values, ie give me a good ratio of food/service/experience to the money. Tango Sur may be relatively inexpensive compared to other steak houses, but, when everything that you're paying for is shitty, the price doesn't matter; it's still a waste.",-0.2765,0.851,0.077,0.072,0.4674561403508772

They do it perfectly there. Just as I would not order a Chicago style deep dish pizza in Miami, I would really not suggest this place as a great example of this style of dining. I can share with you that, while the ambiance is nice, and the BYOB is not a bad thing, the quality of the meat was very very disappointing.  Please do not confuse just having meat on a skewer as that being a definitive Argentinian experience.

Best cab it there because parking is one of the worst I've seen in Chicago, with permit parking only signs everywhere!  We had to eventually settle on parking on Ashland, and walk about 3-4 blocks. Reservations are recommended especially for bigger parties, asyou may be in for a long wait on busy nights.  We were told there was a 45 minute wait for our two party table, and the host offered to call us on our cellphone when the table was ready.    Also, don't forget, it's BYOB!   My biggest complaint was the ambiance.  It was dark, loud and quite cramped, with candlelit tables.  Me and my date were a bit nauseated from some candles that the busboys snuffed out next to us, but luckily it didn't completely spoil our appetite.  If they expanded the restaurant and brought in better lighting and ventilation, I would easily have given this restaurant 5 stars.   The bread rolls were soft and warm, but I was a bit disappointed, expecting traditional South American type breads (can't have it all I guess).  Before our entrees, were were served a simple yet fresh salad plate.   I ordered ""El Filete"", which was a ~$20 meal with generous and absolutely delicious medallions of fillet mignon, in a red onion type sauce.  The side was a buttery spinach mashed potatoes.  The  Chilean Carmenere wine we brought along went well with the beef. At one point during dinner I speculated that this was one of the best steak dinners I have had in a long time, outside of the other vastly more expensive steakhouses like Ruth Chris.  Cooked to a perfect medium.  Excellent deal and quality.  To note: the menu claims that the beef they serve is Argentine, but I was skeptical about this claim given the ban on Argentine beef imports to the US. The service I suppose was adequate, given the busy night.  We finished the dinner on a higher note with the Dulce de Leche (aka Manjar) flan, which was a dish that tasted exactly as my Chilean aunt would make it.  Authentic Cono Sur flavor!

2007-03-17,1.0,"Tango sur I have heard much about Tango Sur, the Argentine restaurant in the Southport nieghborhood where I grew up. As a youngin' I would go to the store for the amazing empanadas and leter for other Spanish products. They have also always had a butcher shop there in the store. This same family started Tango sur after I moved away from home.   The restaurant next door was a real disappointment. Tango Sur is a Argentine style steakhouse that is BYO. The restaurant is cramped with the tables really close to eachother, which sometimes makes for an interesting place to go. But these tables are so tight that not even the waiters can get through let alone the people trying to come and go from there table. People were brushing arms (and asses) against me throughout the evening. At one point I found myself tugging on a guys sportcoat that was leaving because his ass was literally on my table. The guy was cool and apologized. Ok no big deal on that, again a crowd sometimes makes a place fun.  On to the food. I started with the empanadas, which were ok, not fabulous. We ordered an equal amount of spinach and of ground beef. They were half as good as the ones sold at the corner store. The chimichurri sauce, a sauce with olive oil, parsley, garlic and other things was pretty bland. I then ordered Berenjena (Eggplant) for another appetizer. The ingredients of prociutto, rio de plata cheese and the tomato cream sauce sounded like a nice marriage ok, scratch good marriage, they sounded good, but this too was not tasty.  Then came the meat dishes. Upon the waiters recommendation for the most tender meat, I ordered something called 'vacio' which served two. The presentation of this looked great, brought out on a platter that keeps cooking on your table it was in a nice sauce and with sweet potatoes in the sauce. But the meat was horrible, like a really big, poor quality cut and really chewy. After a bit or two I left it. The serving could have served many people. Like five or six.  My son and girlfriend ordered the 'parillada variado'(assorted grilled meats) which comes with sausages, a few cuts of different steak, morsillas which are a blood sausage and pork sausages. Morsillas which are I think Spanish, but made in many places in latin america were just ok with each adding their own touch. The steak on the platter contained was really fatty, like unhealthy to eat due to the amount of fat in each bite. When I told the waiter that what I ordered but far from what he described, he removed it and later returned to say he would take it off my account which I didn't expect but which I appreciated. Service I found was better than the food, as waiters were courteous and very attentive. In spite of this, I could never go back.",0.9766,0.813,0.123,0.065,0.48337912087912094

The wait was a bit long, but the good thing is that they take down your cell phone number and call you when your table is almost up, so you can go home or go to one of the nearby bars while you wait your table.  Also, since it's BYOB, they also have a back room where you can just uncork your wine and drink while you're waiting, although if we had been drinking for the entire hour and a half wait, we wouldn't have been sober enough to eat anything. This place would get five stars, except for the fact that my girlfriend's filet wasn't as good as filets at most places.  The quantity was great, but the quality on her steak was not as good.  Overall though, it was a great, fun dining experience that I'd recommend to everyone who likes meat (and I've heard great things about the vegetarian items too).",0.9952,0.772,0.221,0.007,0.5182950191570881

The portions rock and are served with delicious potatoes.  Cons: greasy & heavy, so popular that wait-times on weekends are over an hour always.  Tips to avoid the cons: workout earlier in the day and eat some salad or something light during lunch to counteract the feeling of doom later in the evening.  Also here's a tip: if you're looking for a romantic dinner and MUST sit inside - go Mon-Thurs and the wait isn't bad at all for in-door seating.  For those of us that don't care, just sit in the front of the convenience store. Tango Sur has spread their tables all the way down and it seems weird at first but it's definitely worth it.  I skipped many 1+ hour waits with my friends by taking the ghetto-table no one wanted at the corner in front of the convenience store (which you can grab some booze at since it's BYOB).  Tip: Although there aren't reservation, if you show up in person they will tell you the wait-time and take your phone #.  Then they call you when a table is about to be free.  This is good if you have out-of-town guests and you don't want them to wait a long time.",0.9802,0.83,0.134,0.036,0.5703703703703704

2006-05-22,4.0,Great meats.  We always go back for the stuffed steak dish that's loaded with oil.  My only complaint is that it's loud as hell along with the crazy wait.  Go in groups of 2 though since you can barely hear what the other people at the table are saying.,-0.6249,0.768,0.072,0.161,0.515625
2006-05-13,3.0,"What can I say about this Argentinian steakhouse?  Well, the place is very relaxed, where tables are crowded together, and people are damn near shouting and laughing all the time.  It's also BYOB, which is frickin' fantastic. Well, our table was tucked away in a corner, so we had a bit more privacy than other tables nearer the center of the room.  Wineglasses were filled with reds, perfectly complementing the meal.  I had the El Filet, in which reduced onion red wine sauce was poured over tender filets and accompanied by spinach mash potatoes.  The price isn't that bad either. The entire atmosphere is pretty fun and relaxed, so it's a great place for friends to come over for dinners, especially if there's plentiful drinks!",0.989,0.717,0.265,0.018,0.5811111111111111
2006-05-01,4.0,"I doesn't get much better than Tango Sur when you factor in affordability, ambiance, service, taste, and value.  Food - excellent.  Service - Very good.  Steaks - the best.  The only downside from getting a perfect score - the wait is NEVER what they tell you and no reservations are taken for less than 6 or 8 people.  Big let down when you are hungry.",0.9116,0.673,0.236,0.091,0.5595061728395061
2006-05-01,3.0,"Had dinner here on a Sunday evening.  There was a big line, and apparently it is worse on Fri/Sat's.  Luckily, they have this dark room lit with a couple of candles in the back where they'll open your wine (no corkage fee) and you can drink/chat while you wait.  The 30-45 minutes I waited passed quickly.  It was a chilly day, so I requested to be seated inside, although patio seating is available.  The waiter explained the menu to us, and we selected a spinach empanada (Argentinian turnover ), chicken empanada (2$ each), bife de chorizo, and an eggplant dish (one of the few vegetarian dishes available).  Atmosphere is loud, and lit with candelight.  It would be perfect place for a first date, if it weren't so loud (unless you have no interest in talking to her).  My biggest gripe about the place is that I was definately the most Argentian person in that restaurant.  I asked about if they could could make the bife de chorizo ""a caballo,""  which means to put two eggs on top of the steak.  The waiter said that they offer the eggs on another entree (some fried fish dish with two eggs), people don't usually order the steak like that.  I'm thinking, ""why can't you just take those two eggs and put it on my steak?  I'll pay for the two eggs.""  And also having two eggs on your steak is a very, very common occurance in Argentina.  The waiter asked how I would like the steak prepared.  I responded with, ""a jugoso"", which literally means ""juicy"" and in Argentina it means more-or-less ""medium-rare.""  The waiter responded with, ""Excuse me?""  I then said, ""medium-rare.""  My second biggest gripe was that I felt I was being rushed, or that they have no timing in their food preparation.  After we had finished our empanadas, they brought us the house salads.  We were about 1/4-1/2 done with our salads when they brought our entrees.  I commented to the waiter in Spanish, ""Isn't it a bit quick for the entrees already?  We havn't finished our salads.""  The waitor responded with, ""I'm sorry, but the food would then get cold.""  Oh well.  Food was okay.  I think the empanadas (particularly the spanish/cheese one tasted great).  Steak was okay (yes, I know that I didn't select the greatest cut, but I know I wasn't going to be impressed with the Canadian beef anyways).  Overall, I would return because of the atmosphere and their BYOB policy.  I'm just biased becaused I just returned from 7 days stay in Buenos Aires.",0.7641,0.898,0.061,0.041,0.5196969696969698
2006-04-03,5.0,"I was so excited to be going back to Tango Sur as I haven't been there in a few years and I remembered the food being amazing.  I was not disappointed at all.  We had a party of 6 so we were able to call ahead and get a table soon after we arrived.  The eggplant and provolone appetizer are great and the steak has so much flavor and melts in your mouth.  We only a few appetizers and 2 entrees and that was more than enough to feed the entire table.  We all brought a bottle of wine which makes the bill very affordable!  Can't forget the flan they brought for my birthday dessert.  I don't usually like flan, but the caramel sauce is to die for.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone!",0.7397,0.832,0.118,0.05,0.493125

2006-04-01,5.0,"I'm still recovering from my dinner at Tango Sur last night (and not in a bad way), a traditional yet trendy Argentinian eatery on Wrigley's north side.  This was by far one of the most flavorful, plenteous and distinctive meals that I have had here in Chicago.  The mood is right with dim candlelight on each table, and with no liquor license, BYOB is a nice additive for those looking to lighten up without dishing out mucho dinero.  The warm bread basket could have filled me up alone had I let it, but instinctively, I saved room because from the looks of the tables surrounding us, I had a feeling I was in for a feast.   The provolone and eggplant appetizers were exceptional, followed by a steak and mushroom platter that was so luscious and tasty, I took one bite and I was in heaven!  That is, until the last course was served our way --- flan with dulce de leche topping --- a sweet ending to an already decadent evening!",0.949,0.866,0.116,0.018,0.6525510204081633
