Also, I guess the patio closes at midnight and that same server made sure that she told us that and urgently asked us to get up and go inside.  This would have been totally cool except for the fact that there were like 5 other tables on the patio and she didn't say anything to those people.  Seemed like our server had a vendetta out for our table because she got my friend's order wrong. Like I said earlier, I would have given this place more than 2 stars if it weren't for the terrible service that we received.  The outdoor patio was awesome.

We picked it because it was on a list for best French onion soups, my girl and I have a weakness for it. Well to start they no longer serve it.  Boo. We went at 9 on a Sunday knowing they close at ten. We were greeted by the bartender Andy who got us started with a nice cold Krombacher, $7. We were one of only two tables in this cozy dark retro tiki style bar. We ordered a cup of the chicken veg soup and buffalo wings as a starter. They came out in good time and the soup was very good, clearly homemade and fresh. The wings were Ok. I'm a wing aficionado to put it lightly. They were slightly under cooked, not unsafe just not crunchy enough and the meat was clearly old, not rotten but not fresh. I ate them. The sauce was good, nice big pieces of carrot and celery and Ok blue cheese. We ordered the mac and cheese and a burger and fries. The house mac comes with red bell pepper which my girl hates. They happily left them out. The 2nd course came out in good time. I tried the mac immediately as my lady was in the restroom. It was hot a gooey and had a nice flavor from the pepperjack and bacon, good textured cava tapi. It was small for $12 however. It's very dense from lots of cheese, not a problem in my book but my girl likes hers a bit more creamy. So my burger and fries, honestly great. My fries were so hot and crispy! Beautiful golden and clearly done in good hot oil, not brown and greasy from old undertemp oil as can happen being the last guests. I so rarely get really perfect fries so I was quite happy about that. They were salted and peppered too which I enjoyed. My burger was perfect. The bun was a nice brioche that had been perfectly grilled plain as I like it and the patty was of high quality and a perfect medium rare. They house burger comes with pickles, tomatoes, iceburg lettuce and fried onion strings. The pickles are cheap burger chips but Ok, I left off the white iceberg and pink tomato. I added sauteed shrooms and cheddar. It was really great. I was really just in the mood for a good burger, fries and a beer and they nailed those. I'm a chef and my burgers are some of the best in the city. It's arrogant but true. Go to Justin's and try one. I no longer work there but its worth the trip. So in short. Cool place, fast friendly service, great burgers and soup. My girl said she wouldn't go back She is more of a fine dining type.

We arrived prior to the birthday girl and we're greeted by friendly bar staff and our waitress (early Saturday evening). The agreed to store the birthday cake for us with no problem. Since the cake was taken care of, it was time for a drink. We planted ourselves at the bar and ordered a Mai Tai for wifey and Oberon for me. The drinks were cold and delicious and fairly priced. The bar itself had a retro-sheik feel and no televisions. That being said, if you're trying to catch the game, this is not the place to be. If you want to chill and socialize, the Orbit Room will do the trick.  Upon arrival of the bday girl and other guest, we move the party outside to some tables we had reserved in the tiki bar/patio area. It was a little chilly this September day, so the patio was pretty vacant. Our server, though her name slips my mind, was very attentive. Drinks and appetizers were served in no time.  The only negative I have is some of the food items. One of the ladies in our group had the tomato basil soup which was very salty. She slid it in front of her thinking the waitress or kitchen staff guy would question if everything was okay. Next, my burger arrived - Overcooked and dried-out (I requested medium rare). Even worse, the onion strings on top the burger we left in the deep fryer too long. The taste of the burnt onion strings tainted the flavor of the dried-out burger... I was hungry and was ready to cry in my beer. I again left my burger in front of me know that we were not going to get a, ""How is your meal?"" from the waitress or kitchen delivery staff. That, ""how is your meal?"", never came. In fact, the kitchen staff guy simple removed the picked-at dried-out burger and salty soup from the table after an hour all why not saying a word.

However, there was a major problem after I gave my debit card to our waitress to pay for the bottomless mimosas for myself and my partner Chris. I signed my receipt and then realized, ""Wait a minute....my debit card is gone."" I checked my wallet and pockets to make sure I hadn't placed it in either place. I alerted our waitress and she and a couple of other staff helped me look. It had disappeared. I immediately checked my bank account and the waitress had charged the correct amount for the drinks. How could it have vanished directly afterwards? I do not believe anyone intentionally stole my card. Our waitress had a whole bunch of cards in her hands when I first confronted her and I remember thinking, ""How on earth are you keeping everything organized?"" I was very disturbed and upset about the whole thing because it was a bad end to an otherwise lovely time. Cancelling the card was easy of course but I have never ever had anything like this happen at a restaurant. There was just confusion and no apologies.",-0.4839,0.832,0.066,0.101,0.4668424036281179
2015-07-10,4.0,So there's a little neon sign in the window that reads: Great Food Don't sleep. I've lived walking distance from Orbit for over twenty years and just recently crossed its threshold. I'll admit I'm not too crazy about the brunch menu but the couple visits I've had will keep me coming back. So with all the patio hype in Chicago I tend to love that Orbit has a beautiful outdoor tiki vibe that feels like a hidden gem. Parsons can exit stage left with their 2.5 hour waits.  I feel as though I wouldn't even wait that long for my first born to arrive. Back to the food though. I often associate chicken tenders as budget friendly food and not necessarily ambrosia but I will gladly order them here. They have a sweet yet spicy and thick dipping sauce that I've fallen for. They officially have the best Cajun Caesar salad I've had and I've already stated in past reviews that I'm just not one to sweat a salad. I mean it's a garden on a plate. And when it comes to elotes I need mine on the cob. Orbit doesn't serve it on the cob but they get a pass. I leave it to you to judge though. As for the drinks they have some pretty good juice cocktails with lemonade and some respectable beers like Alpha King. I feel maybe they could rotate or add some better options but I don't even care honestly. Now the inside is pretty tight and narrow but I could tell that Orbit is a fan favorite among the neighborhood folk and I say let's keep it that way.,0.996,0.742,0.222,0.036,0.5688293650793651

2015-05-27,4.0,"House party! Yea! That's what it feels like sitting on the Orbit Room patio behind what looks like somebody's house. We came for cocktails, following a good bone-gnawing session at the Pork Shoppe. But that would be a different story.  goo.gl/5acf We walked through the bar, which looks like it would be a ton of fun on a cold or rainy night. Very cozy-like. But on what was one of the first patio-worthy evenings of the spring of 2015; we were not to be distracted. Patio-worthy evenings in Chicago are not to be squandered. And what a patio it is: large, with tables that can seat any size party from a lonely guy crying in his beer (I don't need your pity; so please stop staring!) to a large group of friends (so large that even the creeps that you had hoped wouldn't attend showed up). The tables are spread out; so you don't have to listen to the guy next to you loudly explain the options he uses to avoid traffic on his way to work, but you'll miss the 411 on what the mail carrier saw when he took a peek into an apartment while delivering a surprisingly generic-looking package. It was noisier than I expected--sometimes hard to hear my own friends. That having been said, the crowd is old enough that their shouting beer pong days are well in the past. I'm a huge fan of horchata, that fabulous rice drink you get at authentic taquerias. It turns out that someone has bottled a mix of horchata and rum, and it's a marriage as happy as peanut butter and chocolate. Tonight, the Rumchata martini made for a delightful, imbibable dessert. I normally gravitate to whiskey-based libations, like Old Fashioneds. My friends tried the ""Old Fangled,"" which adds cherry and orange simple syrup to the traditional recipe. A little sweet for my barbed tongue, but they liked it. If I'm in the neighborhood, I'll be back--whether it's for winter coziness or patio-weather contentment.",0.9962,0.77,0.2,0.03,0.5476530612244898

The bartenders are some of the most friendly people and never let your sit at the bar with your beer empty.  Sometimes service on the patio can be a bit slow but it's not a big deal when you're just there to chill and enjoy the weather and company, anyhow but I can see where some people might get perturbed if they just want to eat and get going.  I really like that they have a 'no children under 13' policy, because sometimes adults just want to be able to drop an F-bomb now and then without people tsk tsk'ing you.

Went here for my birthday a few years back and again recently and its a great and unique bar with some pretty phenomenal and underrated food.  Had the Ropa Vieja a few nights back and still find myself thinking about it from time to time.  My wife had the mac and cheese, and then later I spent a lot of time looking at the leftovers in the fridge and racking my head for plausible excuses for why it might be acceptable for me to eat them without permission at midnight on a weekday. I'm not a big cocktail guy, truth be told, but they have some tasty cocktails here and I'm  interested in branching out and trying some more of the drinks here.  Went back here a little bit ago and tried the burger with Chorizo and egg, and holy hell was that good too. The service has been good every time I've gone, the bartenders have been friendly and helpful.  On top of that, the atmosphere is great.  I love the low, red lighting, and the rockabilly crowd that sometimes frequents the place.  I'm kinda tempted to rate this even higher, but will give it some time.  Only been here a few times so far, so it might grow on me even more.

(aka, chilaquiles) I ordered that and it took almost 40 minutes. Meanwhile, the two toddlers at our table acted like normal toddlers outside.

It was stressful, to say the least. This lady stood in the corner, fuming, watching these toddlers' every move. No one else on the patio noticed these little girls.

I do not have a car while sitting in Chicago on reserve, waiting for a call from crew scheduling. I stay with a friend a couple of blocks away from the Orbit Room. There are numerous eateries within walking distance, but I always end up going back to the Orbit Room. The decor is vintage Tiki lounge, the music is always something more obscure than commercial (punk, garage, rockabilly, etc.), and the staff is laid back and hip. That being said, it is a comfortable environment for me. There is even a heated smoking tent, if you're into that sort of thing. The patio is particularly nice for anyone, when the weather is mild, and sometimes there is live music. There is a full bar, with a fun selection of Tiki-themed and other mixed drinks. But the thing that keeps me coming back most is the food. Though this is a bar, this is not your typical bar food. I have never eaten anything I didn't like at the Orbit Room. My favorite dish is the jack mac and cheese, made with pepper jack, bacon, and anything else you might want to mix in.

I can understand starting a 1/2 hour late or so, but nearly two hours? The band got about 3 songs in and then the power kept tripping mid song.  It took the rest of the set like this to finally get the power situation figured out (via multiple extension cords).  The first band was pretty good, the DJ in between was great, but we didn't stay for the headliner, we ran out of patience by then.   There was old dry food on my silverware, it took forever for food and we had to ask to see a menu of any type (food or beverage).  Our waitress was absentee, even leaving at one point to change clothes.  She never checked on our table mate to see how his food was and never brought him silverware, a napkin or condiments.  The busboy had trouble finding us when he delivered our food. The waitress forgot to bring a pen to the next table so they could sign their tab. I thought smoking was banned where they serve food.  Well, no one bothered to tell that to the multiple patrons who decided to light up (cigarettes and stogies too) all around us.  The smoke got so bad (and we were sitting outdoors) that we decided to cut our stay short.  That was the final straw really. The cocktails were pretty good, but I witnessed another patron watering down her margarita after she had a ""way too sour"" expression on her face.  That's a no no. We had to ask for water which was served in plastic cups and forget getting a refill. I understand this is more of a dive bar of sorts, but c'mon.   We sat on the patio (see more below) and the plastic formerly white chairs were poorly painted brown and covered with varnish. Really?  That brought tacky to the Tiki feel. Okay, now for the good: our food was pretty good and I really liked the Tiki patio.  The vibe was great and the rest of wait staff was attentive.  Waiters from tables nearby bussed our table, our waitress never left with an empty glass or dish.  I wished I could have tipped them instead. I'm glad they finally put booths back in the interior.  They once replaced the bank of booths with high tops and uncomfortable stools so I'm glad they redid the seating again. The owners seem like very nice people and they have a good thing going, but it could definitely use some polish around the edges.  Unfortunately, I think it will be a long while before I'm back again.",0.9938,0.771,0.154,0.075,0.53727969348659
2014-07-19,1.0,"Had a pretty bad experience today at Orbit Room. I pulled up to the bar and parked my car on Wellington.  The street parking was really tight due to a large dumpster parked on the street for the condos under construction on the corner.  Fearing that my car might get hit by a passing car I asked my wife to check and see if there was a spot in the lot behind the bar.  It was open so I moved my car to the back lot.  I should have read the sign that said you will be towed if you park here.  I did not do that and that is my fault.   I will take that. After sitting in the patio and having food and drinks I suddenly noticed the owner walk to the back gate and go outside.  He then came straight to my table and told me my car was being towed and that he told the driver to put the car down since I was eating and drinking in his restaurant.  I thought to myself how did he know this was my car as there were other people in the restaurant.  Thinking things were a bit weird I went out back where I found the driver loading up my car.  I quickly grabbed the owner who had just told me it was fine and ask him what was going on.  He said I cannot do anything sorry.  I then went back out back to talk to the tow driver.  The owner then locked the back door and avoided me.  I explained to the driver my dilemma.  He called his owner and was able to let the car go.  He was extremely polite and helpful.  The tow truck driver saved my day. As for the owner of the restaurant, not so much.  I have nothing good to report.  This guy obviously knew I parked in his sacred spot (I later learned his wife's spot) he then must have called the tow truck on me.  He did not bother to ask me to move my car before having me towed and he knew it was my car because after the tow truck driver arrived he came straight to my table and told me about it.  Why did he tell me he was having my car towed?   Did this guy have a temper tantrum and then realize it is not smart to have your patrons towed because they probably will never come back to your restaurant and will tell all their friends and neighbors not to come to the restaurant resulting in lost profits and business.  Business 101. I am still baffled.  He did not ask me to move before calling the tow truck or make an announcement in the nearly empty beer garden.  He just called the tow truck.   I am a business owner myself and I have parking behind my building which I own just like him.  I would never have a clients car towed if they parked in my spot.  If I really needed the spot I would ask them to move their car but would never have a client that was sitting in my office paying for my services towed.   His wife did apologize for his rude behavior and for him being hot headed and explained that this happens often (if that is case maybe a better sign is needed) and agreed that maybe the sign could be a bit more clear as to who can and cannot park in the back.  Anyway, I apologize for being so rude for parking in his spot and in retrospect wish I would have stayed on Wellington but wow I cannot return to an establishment that would tow their paying customers.  If it was my business, I would really reconsider that policy because Avondale is moving up.  Ale syndicate brewery is opening right around the corner and many others opening in the neighborhood. Losing that amount of business to an admittedly confusing parking spot does not seem worth it to me.",0.5138,0.886,0.059,0.055,0.43972387566137555

We walked inside an open door (with a large curtain to keep the cold air inside) and went right to the outside back patio.  I liked the tiki theme they had going on in the back patio, which was spacious enough with only two other tables on this hot sunny Sunday. We waited a few minutes for our waitress who was nice enough to bring ice cold water to us as we decided what drinks we wanted. They had a few beers, but were all over in terms of price. PBR, typically the cheapest, was only $3 here for a tallboy. But a Stella was $7. That's a little odd. Miller Lite only $4, craft beers $6-$8. Since the beers were a bit pricey for my choosing, I went with a tiki drink, which was pretty damn good, with a $9 price tag. The back patio wasn't too shaded, so the few tables that had umbrellas were where people were sitting. The back was quiet, even though this place is somewhat close to the highway- the tiki theme patio had brown painted chairs (which the paint was peeling off, leaving the chairs looking like paint fell on them, which was a little weird). The plastic tables were outfitted with wood tops, but were a bit wobbly. Not a big deal. I liked the patio, service was also good. I think they could do more with such a big area, but I'm not sure what. Also wish they had more beers on tap, and prices were a bit more even for beers.

When our taco lunch turned into a patio bar crawl, I knew we had to make our way here. Relaxed and unpretentious, but good for decent sized groups, this is one of my favorite places to enjoy summer in the city. As a winter bar, it's just so-so; the biggest change I've noticed is that they've downsized the booths in what seems like an attempt to create more floor space. That nice corner booth is no more.  Having already eaten, we just imbibed, but that didn't stop me from drooling over the mac and cheese the would periodically float by me. The beer list here is just ok; not terrible, but when you've just come from a place like Small Bar, it seems underwhelming and overpriced. I started out with the Pama Jama, a lovely little drink that comes complete with a little umbrella. After that I switched to beer; had I not had my sugar fill for the day, I would have happily tried several more umbrella drinks (and probably would've needed to be carried home).

I am not a fan at all of PBR so the $2 PBR doesnt appeal unless i wear girl jeans however $3 Jameson is always a blast.  So think of the Orbit Room as more of just a bar, but a great place to get some killer food also. The customers are great, the staff is always great. Oh don't forget the great patio in back! Prob the best in Chicago, no joke. During the winter, they'll throw up a huge heated tent for you to smoke in.

Adriana monitors the place quite well and no she does not walk around like a 2nd shift manager @ Chili's. Why would she? She puts in her time well before the place opens and there almost every time.

Why would you even want to be in such an area? Is it to prove your hipness/coolness? Don't bother, in fact us in ""the ghetto"" really don't look forward hosting pompous asses. And Brian, you obviously qualify as one..........  In closing Brian, you not returning is your choice. So since you are looking for a new hangout I'd suggest  you try TGIF, oh and while I am at it it's suggested you keep yourself to the same standards and judgements you keep others to.

Another great thing?  Service!  My god, yes.  Some friends and I were on a ""Bloody Bike Tour"" on Sunday, which consisted of riding our bikes to various bars and stopping for bloodies and mimosas.  If you were outside yesterday, you can only imagine how sweaty, gross and ridiculous we were, what with the heat and such.  The stellar guys working the patio (VERY cute, btw.  Like, VERY, VERY cute.) handled our group with grace, ease and a great sense of humor... all in the skinniest of skinny jeans on one of the hottest days of the summer, so I give them all the props in the world.

I dig the low key vibe and dive-y inside.  Dimly lit interior adds to its allure and makes for a sweet spot to get in tune with your date.  The often response being, ""I never knew about this place, I should come back""   Their beer garden is a different story.  Well lit and spaced to allow for many to check out what's going on.  A kind of, how you'd love your backyard to look if you had that kind of space.  Patio sets with wood umbrellas and a bamboo fence.  Ample amount of greenery and a great view of the sky above.  On a humid day with the chance of rain and a stiff drink, it's nice.  Often you're guaranteed of ample eye candy so don't bring your date out here, but rather your group of single friends.  Just an honest plea from me. I realized recently a waiter here looked very familiar but could never place the how or why.  Shout out to dude from that awesome improv group  Octavarius: So Nefarious.  If you like improv, check this group out.  Only negative so far, I wish their washroom accommodated more than one at a time.  A hookup or deucing is potential, then where do we whom wait next, go to pee?",0.9876,0.798,0.177,0.025,0.6356026785714286

2011-06-29,3.0,"Well, I only had a beer here, so this is no comprehensive review. I can tell you, though, after looking at the menu, and speaking with the bartender, I want to return for the food and the beer. This night Bell's Oberon was on special for $4.00-perfect. I strolled around a bit and checked out the back patio. Very spacious and inviting it was. But I parked myself at the bar for an old friend rendezvous which didn't happen, and had the opportunity to drink in the joint, so to speak. Been wanting to come in here for a long time. I like how it's just hanging out in this not really Logan Square, not really Roscoe Village spot. When I went in, it felt more like visiting a hip little spot in some college town. Staff has tatoos. Owner looks very serious and important and a guy who has couple big pure bred dogs at home.  I love the old deco bar and the other more mid-century modern decor and lampshades (the kind I always wanted my mom to get rid of), and the fascinating padded vinyl ""soffit"" over the bar. Wouldn't you want padding somewhere lower and closer to the floor, in order to break the fall of the falling-down-drunk patrons? But it is really classy, and hip and retro. And I mean that in a loving and supportive way.  That menu had some enticing items like a number of pulled pork choices, and the Latin beef equivalent, ""Rope Vieja."" I drooled as I watched the guy next to me eat a burger and onion rings. The blackened chicken was highly recommended by the staff, as was the spicy jalapeno pasta dish. When the help likes everything on the menu, that's a good sign. And finally, thank you, Orbit room for not having TV's and instead some incredible music. Maybe I'll be back the next time the moon makes its orbit around the earth. At least I hope I do. This place was a nice surprise.",0.9953,0.788,0.194,0.017,0.5425884353741496

Which I don't expect for this part of the northwest side.] If you need to cheap-it-out, a 16-oz. can of Pabst Blue Ribbon is $3, or a 12-oz. container of Blatz is $2. Food is available.

If you prefer the outside, during summer months, you can sit on the Tiki Patio facing east. There are twenty-two tables. You can be out there until midnight.

2010-07-26,4.0,"Despite perhaps not conforming to its ostensible dive-bar aesthetic, the Orbit Room is nonetheless a nice bar. The internal décor is predominantly dark, slightly dingy, and - not unlike the California Clipper some twenty blocks south - moderately accented along the walls by bright red and antique-lounge-styled light-fixtures. In the warmer months, this space is paired with a tiki-affected outdoor area populated by umbrella-bearing patio tables, white-bulbed Christmas lights, Polynesian-styled masks affixed around the fences, and, the centerpiece of their tiki trompe-l'œil: a grass-skirted Polynesian maiden, replete with lei and ukulele, rendered out of wood and implanted under a small (actual) tree.  Full-service and permissive of smokers, the patio space was understandably quite popular even on a Monday evening in June; yet our service was regular and efficient (not to mention cordial), and - of great import - our drinks were delivered swiftly. Our server even accommodated a companion who ordered bitters-and-seltzer, did so quite affably, and moreover did so gratis (treating what some opportunistic servers might regard as a form of ""cocktail"" instead, quite appropriately, as an order of water). And: they mixed the bitters with soda quite well, despite the drink's relative esotericism.  As for the rest of the beverages: their collection of liquor is regular and of decent depth, while the tap-list is marginally above-average but not over-priced. The edible fare looked likewise marginally above-average - especially for the size of the bar (minus the patio) - and the du jour burger special was inexpensive and appeared very appetizing from what I spied of neighboring tables. Having not much appetite, I opted for a cup of the garden-vegetable-black-bean soup (of the day), which was surprisingly excellent; the poutine of a companion's, which I was able to sample, was simply average.  We were eventually forced inside at the backyard patio's midnight closing, but - enjoying Orbit Room sufficiently - we dallied indoors for a few more drinks. The scant crowd quickly thinned, but the very chill bartendress remained more-than-hospitable before gently ushering us out at closing. I plan, at some convenient point, to return: Orbit is definitely much more laid-back than many other purposefully dive-stylized bars I have patronized in Chicago.",0.984,0.87,0.109,0.021,0.4677391127391127
2010-07-06,5.0,"I first went to Orbit Room the night of the first CYBG event in May, but by the time we arrived, the group had already moved inside as it was starting to get cool out. I made a mental note that this place had an outdoor patio so that when it was finally warm enough, I would come back here. This past Friday was pleasantly steamy enough to enjoy some cocktails on Orbit Room's patio, so off we went. What a pleasant surprise the outdoor patio is! I wasn't expecting such a charming oasis. The tables have sufficient space between them, and there are hanging flowerings plants lining the gorgeous bamboo fence. I also love the old school ""sound system"" here;  it's as if the music is coming from a transistor radio. We grabbed a table and were greeted by a most friendly chap who advised us they had Jack Daniels cocktails for the low, low, bargain price of $4.00. I am not a whiskey fan, but my friend decided to take advantage and ordered a perfect manhattan. I perused the drink menu and a Logan Lemonade was just what the doctor ordered after a long work week. Logan Lemonade is one of those perfect summer concoctions: Stoli Oranj, Stoli Razz, lemonade and soda. It was a most refreshing beverage for a hot summer night. We looked at the menu and again, another pleasant surprise. There are tons of food options and not just ho-hum bar food. We're talking hummus, pastas, pizzas, meatloaf, a Cuban sandwich, fish tacos, as well as the standard burgers, nachos, and wraps. We decided to get the PEI mussels. A heaping plate was brought to us with bread to soak up the sauce. The sauce was garlicky, a tad spicy, but also had the clean taste of the sea and a hint of white wine. So yummy. A few more cocktails were drunk and we had a friendly chat with one of the staff, who was a very cool dude. Everyone we encountered is quite engaging and gracious, and one can tell that they really like working there. After a couple of visits to Orbit Room, I can see why.

Pricing was great too.  We did a wristband deal that was for $25 for domestics.  To our surprise that included local breweries like Bells and Three Floyds.   Thumbs up,0.975,0.799,0.201,0.0,0.43125

It had candied walnuts, dried cranberries, bleu cheese and a sweet but tangy vinaigrette. I love salad, I eat some version of it just about every day, and this one shot to the top of my fav's list. I ate every last bite - even though I knew I had mac & cheese coming. Which, after eating every last bite of that too, stopping just short of licking the bowl (tempting, but there were other diners around)...I understood why my friend was raving about it. It was so creamy & a little spicy with the red peppers,  so good! I absolutely plan to go back and soon.

It's so awesome, we sat outside anyway, after it stopped being un-awesome weather.  The burger was very tasty and good value for $9 because I shared it and half of it was exactly enough food ($4.50 for dinner ain't bad). Except for the fries I then stole off Ronnie. So maybe half was NEARLY enough food. But - the burger was tasty, was the point.  PBR was $3. PBR's rubbish, obviously, but it came in glasses not bottles and... um, yeah, just the $3 thing. Something else was $2, but it came in bottles. The cocktail list sounded good but lost out on this occasion because of the cost vs. hydration issue.  The decor is cool, I like the abstract star things. It was the perfect degree of darkness.  The staff were quick and friendly. They even cut the burger in half and served it on 2 seperate plates for us which is very handy as I probably would have drunkenly cut it into one giant half and one tiny half and then half wouldn't have been even NEARLY enough.

I'm talking about the basic, out-on-a-school-night-sound-track that I've been craving.   Having just moved to Chicago, I can still say with a Pollyanna smile that I love this city but THE BAR MUSIC SUCKS.   Do people really still need to listen to that much Dave Matthews??  Well, they don't at this place.  We were treated to the Ramones, The Clash, Elvis Costello, and much more.   Also, our table waiter and the bartender were that great balance of super nice and super cool.  And I really appreciated the bartender waiting to give me my hendricks & tonic until she could secure a couple crisp slices of cucumber (without my asking).   Cons -- my drink was way too ice-heavy and the retro decor inside made me think the Stray Cats might be hiding behind the googie-style curtains, but they weren't (see above statement about music deliciousness) and the style wasn't really all that bad.  And that patio makes up for a lot.",0.9814,0.736,0.202,0.062,0.4520833333333332

The Orbit Room is not located in a sea of options, but instead, is in the southernmost part of Avondale, an up and coming neighborhood with nice, tree lined houses off the highway. Most people pass it while traveling west to Logan Square or east to Roscoe Village. Being in the midst of making an offer on one of these houses, the crew stopped in to take a look at the atmosphere and see if we could imagine myself and my partner here most evenings. Not expecting much, we were pleasantly surprised. The decor is nice and modern, the beer garden large, and the people friendly. We ordered hummus, veggie wraps, and onion straws...and beer.

Obviously, the beer garden is its best quality.  It's very large, and open; seating for many without being seated right on top of the table next to you.    The food is decent.  Nothing great, but it's a bar, and they serve bar food, and that's fine.  The beer selection is strong, though not excellent.  Bells, Lagunitas, and usually a Two Brothers are all very solid breweries that they usually have at least one of. Depending on the day, the service can be slow.  Which happens when it's busy, and almost all the tables are full.  The very attractive blonde waitress uses some heroic effort to keep up with all her tables, but everyone else seems to fall behind a bit.  If you're lucky enough to get her, then you're set.  But if you get anyone else, you may be waiting, thirsty, as you see her rushing by with someone else's drink.",0.974,0.811,0.145,0.044,0.5326847290640395

What changed? The food. Oh Orbit Room! why did you screw with your menu? i used to be able to come in an order a good solid meal and now, now you have pizza! alright fine- i like pizza as much as the next guy. but if you're going to do pizza do it right. make it the best damn pizza you can possibly make. i was a little apprehensive of the lack of mozzarella cheese and only provolone cheese being available. that as it turns out wasn't so bad. the crust was very good, but a bit salty for my tastes, but again that's just my personal preference, not a big deal. the tomatoes, the tomato killed the whole thing. Orbit Room- why are you using sliced beef steak tomatoes? why? they have no flavor to begin with, and when you put them on a pizza it's just watery and bad. I would say, use plum tomatoes but we live in chicago and it's impossible to get fresh tomatoes in the middle of the winter. so what's the alternative? use a canned plum tomato or better yet, a sauce! i mean seriously, 16 dollars for a 12 inch pizza, it better knock my socks off. sadly it misses the mark.  the burgers, sandwiches, chips, nachos are all great- please don't mess with those or take any more of them off the menu! let's just fix the pizza situation and everything will be okay, for reals Orbit Room... it'll be okay, just step away from the boring flavorless tomato. if you're doing pizza now- do it right and make it the best damn pizza in logan square.",0.9929,0.76,0.168,0.073,0.45875313283208025

2009-03-11,5.0,"This is our community spot! There is not much we don't love about this place. Me and my wife fell in love with the orbit room when we went on a whim for halloween in 2007 and we haven't looked back. Allow me to expound on several key categories: food, drink, staff, ownership, and vibe. Firstly, the food. There are many food options to enjoy at the orbit room. My personal favorite is the spicy buffalo chicken wrap or the fish and chips, meals that would easily defeat other meals with similar titles in open field combat. For the vegetarians there are also many animal-life-preserving options such as the humus plate, the vegan, or in my mind, the clear winner: mac and cheese (ask for no bacon on top). I have personally heard a mac and cheese connoisseur describe the orbit room's dish as ""probably the best mac and cheese in the midwest."" It's hard to argue with that. On to the ever sought after, mind altering, drink portion of the review. The fermented sustenance that so many tired and lonely urban dwellers crave flows in abundance at the orbit room and whatever your taste your pallet will be satiated. Lately I have been gravitating to the $3 PBR on tap, but when I'm feeling risky I know that I have dead guy and a variety of bells to fall back on. I am told their martinis are delicious and I have to admit that although I am not a shot taker traditionally, their lowrider shot is nothing short of amazing. The staff here are pillars of iron to the discipline of serving. It is comforting to come in to place where everyone knows what you want to drink and eat and everyone knows your name. I know, like cheers, but less fictional. We would wrong to not mention Meg, Megan and Alli (sp? sorry Alli (sp?)) as huge influences on what makes the orbit room a five star establishment of greatness. They are timely, witty, friendly, interesting, all around enjoyable people with carefully honed skills in serving food and drink as well as roller derby queens, scholars and gentlewomen in their own right.  The owners of the orbit room are seldom gone from their  brainchild, and it is easy to spot them as the attractive couple at the end of the bar who take time to talk to whoever walks through the door. They are friendly and caring, proud of their establishment and quick to do whatever it takes to make the consumer's experience worth their time money and devotion.  The vibe of the orbit room is unique, it has dim mood lighting without limiting  your ability to see (sorry burlington) and the crowd is usually very mixed. From locals to hipsters, rock-a-billy to professionals and people representing every age range (except for under 21 of course). The music is good, though totally random, I have heard everything from elvis to social d to afro-cuban. The overall vibe is extremely friendly and relaxed which is less common then it should be in this city. Please give this family owned establishment your business and love, they deserve it. We love the orbit room, it is the official choice for the lyndale-palmer community, and if you decided to come in, we will see you there.",0.9939,0.773,0.149,0.078,0.5501674107142858

Sadly, I can't say we had that great time. It took our server a while to get to our table, although it was still early and not that busy. My SO ordered a drink, and I ordered a diet coke. First thing, I got the wrong drink. NP, I asked that it be changed and she obliged. We ordered a burger medium rare and fish and chips. The food arrived and the burger was medium well, and while the flavor might have been great, the overdoneness was not a good thing. We sent it back, and the next one was medium. We settled, as we didn't want to make too much of a scene. The burger was ok, flavor was pretty good, but again over cooked. The fish and chips were plentiful, a little greasy but tasty. Overall an OK. place, that we will go and try again, hopefully the kitchen was just having a bad day, because Avondale needs more places like this.",0.9588,0.774,0.163,0.063,0.5379999999999999

There's really nothing special, they have Rogue's Dead Guy on tap which I guess would be their big bopper. 2bucks for a can of the Beast? or for Schlitz? Yes you can get them cheaper at the Jewel(z), but if you wanna up your cred for cheap, I guess this is your place. Very recommendable for a group of 10",0.4331,0.864,0.073,0.063,0.4455357142857143

2007-12-03,4.0,"I went here on Friday with a friend and we arrived about 9pm. The place was PACKED! We were lucky to get the last open table by the door which was fine because it didn't feel as claustrophobic. The Food: 5/5 Really really good!! I had a grilled portabella wrap with fries, both of which were awesome. I can safely say it was one of the best wrap/fries combos I've ever had! My friend had cheese quesadillas which she said were good. We also split a side of mac & cheese which was out of this world. I will be getting that for my entree next time...and yes there WILL be a next time. The Drinks: 3/5 We each had a Galaxy martini which was ok but nothing out of the ordinary. I thought the martinis were priced a little high  at $9 to $10 each for a place like this.  The Service: 4/5 Our waitress was really busy but still managed to be attentive.  The Atmosphere: 3.5/5 Overall it was really cute and retro and there was a great vibe going on. However it was packed as I said and that made it REALLY loud in there. It was also way too smoky. I'm an ex smoker and it even bothered me. I can probably up this section to 4 stars in January when the smoking ban goes into effect.  I look forward to going back!

2007-11-30,4.0,"As I walked into this bar, I was pretty confused - on the one hand I was face to face with some pretty hard core punk guys  covered in tattoos, chains giving me a total Rockabilly/punk vibe, but on the other hand, I was taken back about a good 40 years into the early 60s, or just a dark Target commercial. It was a very interesting mix - it had this swanky, mod vibe with simple yet loud artwork, but it was obvious to me that it was once a neighborhood dive with an Old Style sign out front and stale cigarettes littering the floor. (Note, there was no Old Style Sign nor stale cigarettes littering the floor, they did a really good job cleaning that up with the remodel).  Drinks were plentiful and good specials. I didn't look at the drinks other than beer (told ya I was a beer gal), but there was beer for every taste and budget, from mid-high-end Sierra Nevada to the trendy but cheap Old Style in a can for $2 - and if memory serves me right, there was more than one type of cheap, working man's beer for those with an artist's or student's or even working man's budget. Didn't have the food, but I was oogling my friend's burger with fancy smancy onion rings on top. Did I mention that I'm also a burger girl as well as beer? Seems like Orbit is my kind of place.

2007-11-17,3.0,"First off, just because you don't see red on my stars don't judge the place yet... I've only been there once, so the stars could just as easily go up, you never know if maybe a place is bad because your mood for the night wasn't suited to it, you know? So service first: We went on a Saturday night and the service was not impeccable (table service) but the girls were fun, friendly and accommodating. Our group went from three to five to seven and before we could ask ""Can we move the tables together?"" the waitress was already making it happen. That's rad. So definitely five stars on the service.  The drinks were a little weak and overpriced for being a little weak. But only at 5 bucks, which I do realize in comparison to a majority of Chicago bars is decent, but in comparison to the most of the bars I go to (Green Eye, Gold Star, Maproom) it's a buck too much. And when you drink as much as I do, it adds up. Though the bartender did make a killer Gin & Tonic which for some reason most bartenders have problems making.  The decor was cool, like everyone else said, very Holiday Club when it was on Milwaukee. But here's where the two stars got let go. The music is the bartender's or waitress' IPod. Not a big deal, but it was so spastic. I enjoyed about one out of every five songs and for me the music is a deal breaker for me. If I can't handle the music then I can't handle the bar. I'm not one of those people that can happily ignore what's being forced into their ears. But if you are, then add a star.  Lastly I walked out of thinking ""blah"" - it wasn't great, it wasn't bad... it was just there.  So like I said, my opinion could change.",0.81,0.804,0.108,0.087,0.5055555555555554

2007-10-15,4.0,"I had been waiting for the Orbit Room to open for a long time  so when it finally opened I was there that week and I've been back many times since. I like the Orbit Room. The bartenders are friendly, drinks are reasonably priced, and the food is good.  The room itself isn't too large, but not small by any means. It kind of reminds me of what Holiday used to look like on Milwaukee before they closed and moved up north. (Oh Holiday Club- so sad what you've become- but that's another review.) Anyway, the decor here is nice, very modern in a 50's sort of way. The owners did a really nice job of the build out. One thing I would like to see is the lights brought down a bit. It always seems really bright whenever I'm in there which is at least once a week or so.  I'm not sure if it's the lights on the bar reflecting off the mirrors or the spots on the ceiling but I think dimming the lights a bit would really help the mood.  Music is played off the bartender's iPod/laptop. I have no complaints there; they seem to have pretty good taste in music- in my opinion.  Beer Garden- I haven't been in the beer garden yet since it opened, but when I do I'll edit my review.  The food here is really good. Now let's not kid ourselves, it's bar food. This isn't a gourmet restaurant and as far as bar food goes; I think this is some of the best in the city. It's priced spot on and very delicious.  Try the big ass slice of chocolate cake, you'll like it.  Drinks like I said earlier are reasonably priced. They have a nice selection of whiskey and all your standard beers that one would expect. I am a bit perplexed at the number of vodkas they carry.  Now this is just my own personal beef with vodka drinkers but seriously, vodka doesn't taste like anything. It's not supposed to, so why waste valuable bar space with different brands of vodka? I guess it's not the Orbit Room's fault that people don't know how to drink they're just feeding the habit. I mean seriously people, does it really matter what brand of vodka you're drinking when you're mixing it with 7up? Okay I'm done ranting.  Bottom line: Orbit Room good. Go there, spend lots of money, get smashed, and take a cab home. Update**** The Orbit Room has started to stock rye behind their bar!",0.9954,0.75,0.182,0.068,0.5776632395382397

Original Review: I've noticed this place every time I head up California to the Montrose dog beach and my fiance and I finally decided to stop in to try something new, and I must say that we were really pleased with the place.  It has a nice retro feel to it, and has a really chill atmosphere (on a Tuesday night at least).  I love the cheap beer specials ($3 Schlitz) because it really takes me back to my days of growing up in Milwaukee where brands like Pabst, Schlitz and Miller were common.

2007-08-22,4.0,"Last night I met up with a couple Yelpers (holla Amaliya and Mesum and Darryl) at the Orbit Room for some drinks and snacks. If you know me, you know that I barely ever go out because I'm just an anti-social jerk...but my curiosity got the best of me and I could not resist the draw of a newly opened bar on my home-to-Hot Doug's route. After reading the reviews below I was expecting the worst. I pictured a crap bar trying to hard, nasty-ass nouvelle pan-asian bar food, and a god-awful iPod soundtrack to wash it all down in a fern bar setting. I could not have been more wrong. I walk in alone and immediately a bartender starts talking to me. She's super-friendly, cheery, and gives me a few minutes to decide which draft beer I'm going to drink. There's Guiness on tap, but I'm not much for Guiness, so I go with Sierra Nevada. There are four other beers on tap...or was it five others? I'm a bit partial to microbrews, but the Sierra Nevada works for now. There is also a good selection of beer in bottles. I get the impression that the offerings will change over time.  I like the bar. The owners have taken a down-and-out old man bar and polished it up a bit, done some renovating and have added some old school padding to the edges. It is comfortable and -happily - still has a bit of the old character left.  The crowd is diverse, too, making this slightly-older-than-the-hipsters-at-whirlaway grouch feel at home. Don't get me wrong - I don't hate hipsters. Its just that I hate being the oldest person in the bar, and there was no chance of that at the Orbit Room. I asked the bartender about that and she says that so far there has been a good mix of neighborhood people who have been waiting for a local watering hole to open up and people from the nearby neighborhoods looking to check out something new.  The menu is a fairly typical bar menu with a few twists. There are wings and quesadillas and burgers, but there are also paninis and wraps and soups and -get this - entrees like chicken under a brick. Some of the dishes are still works in progress. As I munched on some nachos (thankfully meat-free), the owner asked me what I thought. I liked the two kinds of beans - black and refried - but thought it could be spicier. He agreed, and maybe the next time I go in it will have pepper jack cheese. We will see. They were good, and the addition of more heat can only make them better. As far as the music goes, I know how much people value their jukeboxes in bars. I can understand why the iPod playlist may not appeal to some. I didn't find the music too obtrusive, and the mix of Le Tigre, Postal Service, and other contemporary indie hits wasn't too annoying. It could have been much worse.  The Orbit Room is definitely not for everyone. It is small and cozy, has some refined flourishes and isn't going to be your dive bar hang out where you can get wasted on $1 PBRs. But that's fine with me. There's nothing wrong with a little grown-up fun and friendliness every once in a while.",0.9931,0.811,0.132,0.057,0.5010238751147842
2007-08-22,4.0,"Full voluntary disclosure: I worked with one of the owners about five years ago and I still consider them my friends.  I would really like to give them 5 stars, because in honestly, that is how I feel about the bar..but I know that others would view that as nepotism...so all I have to say is check it out for yourself. I received an email for their friends and Family night, and also for their grand opening event.  I am one of those lame people that although I support my friends and family, getting me to go out nowadays is really a chore with getting a babysitter...especially on a weeknight..so I missed out on both events.  I had intended to visit eventually, but after seeing the bar slammed by some many Yelpers because they thought that the 5 star reviews were planted, I had to go for my own piece of mind and also because I did not believe that to be true.   As I had clearly stated before, I know the owners.  They are two of the nicest people that I know and they have true integrity.  Everything that they do, they put their heart and soul into, and I have often been inspired by their attitudes and their works.  It is said that success is how far you bounce back when you hit rock bottom, and this couple is truly a success story.   I asked a few yelpers to join us yesterday because I wanted the reviews to be fair.  For me to write one alone, it would be cast off as another shill review.  And in all honesty, despite knowing the owners, I loved it. There is a very laid back feel to the bar, no pretension, no over the top LP feel.  It is exactly the kind of bar that you would imagine a neighborhood/ lounge bar to be like.  For me the bar feels right.  It feels comfortable.  It doesn't feel new, it feels that it has always been there, if that makes any sense.  It isn't huge, it's just right.  The decor has  a retro feel and I found the colors soothing.  My husband commented that he likes the layout of the bar because he can see who's coming in and out as well as who is behind him.  He has always been a freak about having his back turned.  I asked the owner about the sound and music system.  She told me that their music varies by their crowd, and they often play by request.  She told me that they get different kinds of people/ ages throughout the night,  which we clearly evidenced for ourselves. There is a much older crowd early in the evening, but by the time that we left there were a lot of 20 somethings. I didn't have any problem with the sound system, I like to be able to talk and hear people when I am in a bar.   The people who worked behind the bar were friendly and attentive.  Our drinks were often checked on and our ashtrays cleared.  We tried the wings, nachos, and quesadillas.   It's not gourmet food, but it's definitely better than average bar food.  I especially liked the quesadillas because they had a lot of flavor to them along with sides of salsa, guacamole, sour cream and a spring salad.  I am a big wing fan, and I thought that they were the right amount of crisp and kick.  My husband told me that they were done right...because for him the fumes from a good wing makes him cough when he inhales.  They are still working on perfecting their food and drink menu,  so they appreciate any criticism or suggestions. I really truly had a great time last night.  We were with incredible company.  I finally had the pleasure of meeting Lindley and Mesum in person, and those two have a way of making you feel comfortable and they are really easy to talk to. It is people like them that make me so happy to have joined Yelp.  A good vibe, good service, good company is what made this bar a great venue to me.  You know how you want a bar to be successful, but secretly you wish to keep it to yourself?  That's how we felt like when we left.  We want it to be our own hideaway, a place where we can bring our other friends and chill.  We are definitely coming back. 9/26/07 Update!!!

The waitstaff is chill, the owner immediately went to the kitchen when we told him our food was too salty (chicken nachos with sour cream and refritos) but it was also very welcome. I haven't tried anything yet with substance like a cheese sandwich. Decor is nice too. The older bar motif is very similar to that of Golden Rise bakery back when it was Tacos y Salsa.

2007-08-16,3.0,"I noticed that Lora P and Tyson H have been Yelping since August 2007, the time the bar opened, and have as of 8/20/07 only one review - for the Orbit Room.  Their reviews are glowing, out of this world.  This is all fine - but I wonder if they are connected to the bar.  If they are, they shoud disclose it, if not, nevermind, sorry for my suspicions.  But read them - one wonders.   I give Orbit Room three stars, although this place could easily add a star if it works out some of the kinks.   First of all, this bar is a welcome addition to the neighborhood in general.  Bars with a bit of style are not copious in the Logan Square/Avondale environs - some may see a place like the Orbit Room as indicative of gentrifying wave - this may have some truth, but the fact is, the area needs good bars.  I am more familiar with Logan Square than the Avondale side of it - I always thought we should send our enemy combatants, or whatever we are calling them these days - to Dunlay's on the Square - that would really teach those terraists.  Anyway.   As it stands, the place is pretty basic, although the decor has a mellow, dark kind of retro thing going.  Relatively small place.  The menu is very basic, and I had a decent Cuban sandwich, but I also tried the fish special which was lame.  Not good at all.  I think one can expect a basic bar food experience here.  Nothing to write home about.  Is it possible to bring it up a notch?  Very generic bar food.   The place was crowded. I think people are excited about this place.  It was kind of a cool mix of people as well.   This place should develop some signature drinks and a drink list.  It should also expand its food menu a bit.  Also - no AC, and no ceiling fan - you have to have at least one of these.  I expect this to change at some point.   Service - decent, overall.  It was busy, my drink sat empty a bit too long, but nothing terrible - and not bad relatively speaking.  Waitress was friendly.  Also - a special note - when we came in, there were no tables available - but they seemed to be quite concerned about getting us a place to sit - friendly energy overall.   Overall, a nice addition to the area, but why not take it further and make it even better?  Gotta get some air flow, number one.  Granted, not everyoe thinks fancy drinks and a drink list are important - but this area has plenty of semi-dive bars - let's develop one with style and substance.  Then we can finally shut down Dunlays on the Square, and expatriate all the prisoners who reside in torment there.   They seem to be in process of creating an outdoor seating area.  That is always nice.   Lastly, sound system is very bad.  I also did not personally like the music - it was a bit too rocky for me, but thats just me.  But objectively speaking, the sound was not good - loud and washed out, no clarity.  May be due to the size of the room overall.",0.997,0.776,0.174,0.05,0.5328030925013685

I was thinking it was going to have an overall cool retro vibe, but now it just feels like a basic redone bar with retro fixtures. I was hoping for more!  The room itself looks very much like the bar at Club Lucky and it is about the same size. I was thinking it was going to be a bit larger, but no.  Also, note there is no outdoor seating area. So it is pretty much the bar and that is it. It's going to be getting pretty crowded over the next few weeks, I predict.  Don't go just for the food, it was basic bar food. Passable, but if you are going to compare other places in the hood, Street-side puts much more care into its menu. Mixed drinks were fine, a bit overpriced.  Very good beer selection.  Music selection was very good. Sound system needs some work.  Major Problem: It was hot as Hades in this place. Where is the AC??  No ceiling fans!

2007-07-09,3.0,"I'm giving this place an emphatic ""meh"" for now.  As with all new bars, this place has to find its footing, its vibe, its clientelle, etc etc. It is a cool looking space, very art deco-y.  Big cushioned seats line the north wall with comfortable and high stools complementing them. It feels like a sleek 60s diner with a lounge attitude.  Except for a strip of horizontal mirror on the back wall and some stylized stars mounted above the bar, the decoration is sparse. The jukebox is an iTunes monitor tucked behind one of the vintage bars' glass cabinets.  Music was fun and eclectic (going from jazz-lounge to Lee Hazlewood to ""Alt"" rock by then end of the night) but the sound was a bit muffled. There were no drink menus (much less deals) available when we were there.  Honestly, I'm a bit too critical on the price of drinks, but I felt the libation prices leaned closer to ""lounge "" than the ""Avondale corner bar"" that it actually is.  Oh, and the ATM Machine: $4.00 withdrawal fee... recockulous but nearly understandable as no one would walk around Avondale looking for an ATM machine. That said, the waitstaff was super nice and super cute.  The patrons were neighborly and (thankfully) variant.  All in all, this could be a great place, and am rooting for it -- the whole ""We're heavy metal"" thing going on at Kuma's is not my style. Oh, also, it does appear they're developing a patio back area which would be a really nice addition to the bar and the neighborhood.",0.987,0.823,0.147,0.03,0.49594405594405594
2007-07-05,5.0,Opening night last night was a lot of fun. They really did a bang up job with this place; it's a very classy joint. This is how the neighborhood is going to get on the map. The food was simple but good. Being opening night there were obviously a few issues to work out. The staff was great though and took things in stride. I think everyone there lived within a few block of the place. it was great to meet my neighbors. The music was excellent. There is no drink menu (yet?) but I saw a ton of different beers go by. The whiskey selection is good as well. I had a very old bushmills that was fantastic. I'm not sure why Ingrid is too cool for school; I couldn't be happier with the Orbit Room. I've got to make sure I don't spend all my money there.,0.979,0.693,0.22,0.086,0.5506437389770724
