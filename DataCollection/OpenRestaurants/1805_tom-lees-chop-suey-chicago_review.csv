2016-11-16,4.0,"The restaurant is small, cramped and seats about 8 comfortably in the two booths, so it does mostly carry-out. Popular with the locals, it also does a brisk delivery business to the surrounding ""old-timer"" bars that can't afford on-site kitchens. Yes, it's not the fanciest place in the world and has a divey quality, but I would take their General Tso's Chicken any day over any other Chinese food establishment in the area. The chicken's coating retains its crispiness in the sweet heat of the GT sauce, and I feel less guilty about the fried food since it's served with a few sprigs of perfectly steamed broccoli. Tom Lee's offers two combo sizes for most of its entrees, and I usually order the small combo that comes with a large amount of chicken or veggie fried rice, an egg roll, and soda.

2016-08-31,3.0,"I've been living in this area for about 35 years. This is the third owner of this business Tom Lees that I have patronized. Over the years it has declined  considerably but maintained an inexpensive Cantonese food alternative in my area. In the last 4 years it slipped quite a bit. They substitute celery for water chestnuts and fill the meat dishes with green peppers and celery instead of bamboo shoots, water chestnuts and bean sprouts. My biggest complaint currently is the chicken fried rice usually has very little chicken in it and the rice is not fully fried nor does it have enough soy sauce in it so you get batches of white rice in your fried rice. It seems that's the way they're saving money now instead of putting the prices up. I told her if she makes a better product I'll continue to eat there and the neighborhood has a higher median income now and will support an upgrade to the product. They're lovely people and they've had the business now for probably 10 years but I think that they've grown tired and are NOT putting out the product they used to. If you want cheap Chinese food it is a good place to go. The lunch specials and the dinner specials for 6.95 or 7.95 are very reasonable. The crab rangoon is pretty good but the egg rolls don't have any meat in them they're basically just cabbage and carrots with a little bit of shrimp and a little bit of pork. You might think that I am asking a lot from a Chinese restaurant, but americanized cantonese can be very good food, just go to Chinatown and see for yourself. But a close alternative is the Orange Garden. It's probably 25 to 40% more expensive then Tom Lee but the food speaks for itself. Another place in the area is Chop Suey Huang at Foster and Lincoln. I used to rank them third in the area but now they've moved up to second over Tom Lee.",0.9757,0.896,0.085,0.019,0.47505376344086014

I must have missed the fact that there are dinner specials -- I paid twelve bucks for an order of General Tso's with fried rice and an eggroll. Too expensive -- especially considering the quality of the food. It was served hot (and in large quantity), but I found the food to be bland and heavy. Funny enough -- even though I gave it two stars, I'll probably try it again. Maybe another dish besides the G. Tso's is more flavorful and inspired. And having seen here on Yelp that there must be some kind of hidden dinner special that I didn't know about, I'll go back and see if I can get dinner for a cheaper price. If I'd paid 5 bucks instead of 12, I might have been able to take it up to three or even four stars. PRO TIP: They have the plastic take-out containers that are good for microwaving. So if you want dinner and lunch for the next day (or few days), Tom Lee's might be an okay option for you to consider. If you are an average Joe, you'll probably be okay going here.

2008-07-24,5.0,"""Tom Lee, can I help you..."" As soon as I hear this I know I am on my way to some good ole' traditional Chinese Food.  Everyone is right, on the outside, this place looks so drab and small, but the food is prepared very fresh, and very speedy.  Now some of you may not believe this, but they have an AMAZING chicken noodle soup.  And for a large container of it, it's only like $2.25, hop off the el on a cold winter day, grab one of those containers, and bam...you're on the fast track to devouring some delish soup right there...I also love their Shrimp Fried Rice, the portion is insane, and it has just the right amount of Soy Sauce to rice ratio ;) and...they don't put carrots in it yuck, I hate fried rice with carrots in it...yuck. Oh...do not get a craving for this place on a Monday, because they are closed...but anyway, do check them out and do not be fooled by the appearance, this really is a diamond in the rough :D",0.9841,0.766,0.192,0.042,0.6232919254658386
2008-05-23,4.0,"Kung Pao chicken had a great thick sauce, not watered down at all, and was quite spicy. The mongolian beef was a bit spicy for my taste, but had a good flavor. Egg rolls were a bit on the small side but tasted fantastic. We were split on the pot stickers, I liked them, the wife did not. Either way they were a good sized. The chicken fried rice was awesome!",0.9794,0.704,0.296,0.0,0.7012626262626264
2008-04-29,5.0,"Tom Lee gets 5 stars as the best cheap take-out/delivery Chinese place I've found in Chicago.  To echo others' reviews, please don't plan on eating your food in the restaurant (it's just a small storefront with a couple of plastic booths).  But once you start opening your food containers back at home, you will be pleasantly surprised.  I stopped here desperate for a quick dinner meal after getting off the Brown Line one night a couple years back and it has quickly become a regular favorite.   Just about everything I've tried is a cut above the other similar Chinese joints in the city.   The Mongolian Beef, General Tso's chicken, and fried rice (especially the Pineapple fried rice with Shrimp and Chicken) are all delicious and fresh, well prepared with fresh vegetables and very tender but hearty cuts of meat that aren't rubbery or gummy like other local places I've tried.   But my top choice is the lo mein and chow fun -- they do these noodle dishes so well.  Try the ""combination"" lo mein or chow fun (with shrimp, chicken, and beef and delightfully wok-charred noodles).     The value for the money at Tom Lee is fantastic.  The lunch special ($1 more for ""dinner special) is especially incredible -- for $5 or $6 you get a HUGE portion of chicken fried rice, a big,crispy egg roll, a really big portion of whatever special item you choose (orange chicken, mongolian beef, lo mein, etc.) AND a can of pop.  I am a really big eater, and this is enough for 2-3 meals for me.  You can tell by the weight of the bag of food they hand you -- it's more than substantial.  My only real negatives are that they're closed Tuesdays and aren't open that late (I think 10PM on weekdays, 11PM on weekends).   But otherwise I encourage trying this place out!  They're friendly, they get your order right, and the food is so much better than what you're used to getting at a Chinese take-out place.",0.9971,0.769,0.212,0.02,0.5156023222060958
2008-04-04,4.0,"Our first priority after moving to Lincoln Square was finding a new Chinese place that is cheap and delivers food quickly. I searched on Yelp one day and found a place further down Western that had great reviews, but was just bleh. It's like I had gone to the suburbs for Chinese food.  But then a couple of days later we were driving down Western and saw Tom Lee's, a seemingly non-descript and unassuming place. We quickly double-parked and ran inside to grab a menu and off we went home.  It's been a love affair ever since.  Regardless of what we order, they get it right - including our requests for no spice, extra spice, sauce on the side, none of this, more of that - you name it, they will do it - HAPPILY.  If the delivery time is a little longer than usual (and by usual I mean we generally have our food within 20 minutes), they let you know when you order. The dinner combinations are between $6-7 and it's enough food for 2-3 meals, at least the orange chicken is.  The person taking orders is always polite, and i'm a little ashamed to admit has come to know us when we call. The delivery guy must be the absolute nicest, sweetest man on the planet. He always makes sure our order is taken care of right away, and it's little things like that which make all the difference when picking a small restaurant out of a dozen available.",0.9829,0.847,0.129,0.025,0.44745511841100083
2008-03-29,5.0,"My very first meal in Lincoln Square was from there and I have been a loyal customer ever since. Fast, friendly service; good cheap food in glorious amounts; what's not to like? Lunch and Dinner combos are cheap ($4-5 and only a $1 extra after 3pm) and more than filling: a large container of a main course and Chicken Fried Rice with an egg roll and a can of soda (good variety and always cold) is more than enough for a single meal. My favorite dishes include their Chicken Wings, Pot Stickers and Teriyaki Beef in appetizers; Spicy Combination and Shrimp Fried Rice dishes and Mongolian Beef and General Tao's Chicken (comes with broccoli, though). But the real kicker is their staff. Friendly, efficient and always helpful; they are a true reminder that customer service is not dead in modern businesses. Their cashier; a very friendly, middle-aged Chinese woman whom always has a smile on her face; is very warm, welcoming and has an amazing memory. When placing an order, she doesn't take your name down yet never misses a single thing! And where else can you order out food for large parties, not order any kind of party platters or anything yet not only get everything quickly but also receive extra food for no extra cost?! 2 successful New Year's parties and counting!  And if you like tweaking certain dishes to your liking, no problem here! Everything is made to order and exactly to your wishes. Want a lunch combo of General Tao's Chicken without broccoli and want the Fried Rice spicy? You get exactly that at the same price and in the same amount of time.  Strictly take-out, though. The interior is below-average, city neighborhood, Chinese restaurant aesthetics: small, dingy, constantly assailed by the elements and dirty footprints and could easily pass for  a hot dog joint if not for the smell of amazing Chinese food wafting out their doors. This is my favorite neighborhood joint for Chinese in the city and I've tried many. Unless you plan on going outside the suburbs or to a P.F. Chang's, look no further than Tom Lee's.",0.9882,0.779,0.166,0.054,0.5217297397942559
2008-03-19,2.0,"This place used to be my favorite Chinese take out joint over 15 years ago. I worked a block away and went here at least once a week. I didn't really talk to the people that worked here but I deduced that the owner and his wife left the business (retired I hope but death could be involved) and the food quality declined. I gave up on this place around 94' so it's been a while. While I can't say it was spit out your food bad , the drop in quality was just very drastic. One example I recall is the meat got alot chewier and the beef fried rice suddenly was overloaded with bean sprouts and egg. When the shrimp in my staple dish , shrimp with lobster sauce , were suddenly smaller and way over cooked , that's the moment I punched out. Ownership could have changed hands a dozen times since I've last been there and for all I know it might be great by now. You can roll the dice here , I have new places to go.",-0.4939,0.857,0.063,0.08,0.4031565656565656
2008-02-03,4.0,"When I moved to Lincoln Square, I was hoping to find a dirt-cheap Chinese takeout joint to replace the go-to place I'd left in Astoria, N.Y. I was looking for quick order turnaround and passable broccoli with garlic sauce. And I found it in Tom Lee.  The staff is friendly and fast, and the food is good. They've started recognizing me when I come in, which is always a nice feeling (even though it's a little sad, too). The day they know my order by heart is the day I reconsider my dietary choices completely, but for now, it's nice to grab a bite here every once in a while.",0.8358,0.862,0.12,0.018,0.5545454545454546

2007-05-20,4.0,"For 15 years I've searched for Chinese food in the city that wasn't trying to be fusion or fancy. All I wanted was the stuff I got in the suburbs growing up.
