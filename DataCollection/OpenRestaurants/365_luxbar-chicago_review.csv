2017-08-28,5.0,I had not been to Chicago in about 6 years.  Throughout the day I had gone bar hopping with my friend and was so let down by the bars we had visited.   Later in the evening we ended up at LUXBAR and I instantly felt like this was the Chicago I knew and loved.  Mike Finn was our bartender and was amazing.  He made us feel like we were the most important customers in the whole place.  Super attentive!   We also met Gunner who made sure we were taken care of as well.  I will definitely come back to this place because of these guys.   Thank you for making my Chicago trip a memorable one!,0.9864,0.731,0.269,0.0,0.6079365079365079
2017-08-19,1.0,"This has to the WORST restaurant in chicago. Food was absolutely horrible. Ordered: fish tacos, crab bisque, fried chicken, macaroni and cheese and truffle fries. Fish tacos had nooooo flavor and tortillas were stale. Crab bisque was extremely too thick in consistency. Looked like Nacho Cheese sauce. Crab was just poured on as if poured out of a can. Fried chicken was extremely bland, the breading didn't even have flavor. Last but not least I thought the truffle fries were their hot item off the menu and surprise surprise, I tasted no trace of truffle. This place is soo bad and I'm soooooo disappointed. I know GREAT food and Chicago is a city of GREAT culinary but this place should not even serve food. I wish I could give 0 stars.",0.8437,0.731,0.157,0.111,0.6838541666666667

As soon as I cut into it, I knew it wasn't cooked as I requested. It was cooked medium-rare. Courtney offered to have it cooked up, or a new steak. I said cooked up was okay. THEN, the ""cooked up"" steak comes out... and really not that much of a difference. I had, had a long day and was really in no mood and was just going to let it go. Courtney offered to have steak comped from the bill. I really appreciated this, because I am not a demanding customer (you know who are ;). I explained I didn't want her to get in trouble etc. but she's the server... not the chef so it wasn't her fault at all. She was so cute and brought me out a little baby piece of steak that was cooked as it should have been the first time. So in short, Courtney thank you so much... appreciate you!

After order is placed 5-7 mins later we are told they are out of Tuna. Ok. Five minutes to wait for a menu. Food delivered and asked for mustard.

I don't suggest ordering this staple cocktail at this bar. We ordered pigs in a blanket and the house hummus to share. The pigs in a blanket are teeny bite size pieces, but enough on the plate for a group of 10 to each have one. The hummus was substantial and tasty. I also ordered the off menu buffalo chicken salad, as I had heard that it was delicious. However I was pretty disappointed. The chicken pieces were like bite sized pieces of fried stuff, with no chicken to be found inside. The sauce and veggies were great, but the protein itself was nowhere to be tasted.

Well, there's a reason so many tables were available here on a Saturday morning.  Pros: The decor and ambiance inside are very nice. We sat near the fireplace and it was a very cozy way to spend the morning.  Cons: - I ordered the avocado toast, which had very little avocado to speak of. The runny egg entirely saturated the toast, and the mouth feel/texture was just blah. Hutch, in Lakeview, has a much tastier avocado toast that costs less. Or, better yet, buy an avocado and make this at home.  -Our coffee was served lukewarm. However, kudos to the staff, they replaced it right away when we let them know.  -The tables are all extremely close in proximity.

Boy have things changed. It's just over a year since we'd been here due to traveling out of state. I asked our server if there was a kitchen staff change- and there has been. It's QUITE obvious. And a huge menu change. Blah.    So we dined here this past weekend (party of 4). All foodies. We all have different tastes and ordered 4 completely different things. Perch, the muscles, buttermilk fried chicken and the filet sliders. Hmmm. The muscles were a good size, but needed to be cleaned more. Some where good, but mostly mealy n bad. The perch, fried chicken and sliders all tasteless. No seasoning at all. We had to add our own. The sliders used to come with a small side of coleslaw or they asked if you wanted fries for an up charge. Now just 3 super thin cut pieces of filet on small buns looking so sad on the plate and lonely. So far 2 entrees, 2 appetizers. And an up charge to order fries instead of coleslaw.    *WARNING - if you drink wine by the glass and are drinking the same wine as someone else at the table ORDER A BOTTLE!!! The 4oz pours (I measure my wine at home for dietary reasons) for a $12 glass - epically ridiculously short!! That's over a %400 markup on alcohol. I said to the server after we received our glasses, I happened to have ask her ""what's a better buy? The glass or the bottle?"" She answers -bottle. Hmmm then why didn't you suggest that?   Between the quality of the food, tastelessness, presentation and 4oz wine pours for the $. And I know it's Chicago. I know it's the Gold Coast, but it's obvious the kitchen staff has changed (chef) and ownership doesn't care. I guess when you have prime real estate it doesn't matter. But it could be our faults too....it is a bar after all.    The manager did come to talk to us, which I was good with just telling the server and he comped a glass of wine (totally not what I wanted). We still tipped the server 20% (it's not her fault kitchen is to blame).    I wish I could give it 2 stars, but with all the other competition around and Chicago being a food Mecca I can't.

The food came quickly which is smart, by staffing up the kitchen for increased throughout they can turn over more tables, but that said, we never felt hurried our rushed to leave. Just the opposite, we felt welcome, appreciate and happy that our food came so quickly. Shortly after being seated, the manager came over, introduced himself, welcome us and told him to let him know if we needed anything which resonated with me. Nice touch.  Obviously he's comfortable enough that his ship is being run well that he can personally focus on the most important task at hand, a satisfying customer experience.  Second, Luxbar is deep in the heart of see and be seen country so it is as dynamic and vibrant a brunch people watching scene as you can find in Chicago. That said, many locals, such as I, who enjoy the beautiful flowered street ambiance as well can be found nestled throughout the posh crowd. I don't remember what I ordered but it came with freshmy made tasty home fries, fresh perfectly scrambled tasty eggs, deliciously spiced breakfast sausage,  fabulous double smoked artisan bacon strips and what appeared to be a home made jam. It was served in an iron skillet so it was nice and warm when it arrived. The portion was substantial. I recall making a mental note that the coffee was quite good as well.  My entire party enjoyed their food as well.  For my own selfish reasons I'd like to see them take more risk with more innovative menu choices but I also understand that given their volume of customers, the need to simplfy and focus on the quality of food and service. I also understand that they understand this is a more mainstream crowd then one finds in fringe neighborhoods.

2016-02-15,5.0,"I do not know how to love a bar more than LuxBar! I first found LuxBar when I first moved to downtown Chicago for work, in August, 2009, and can be found at LuxBar between 3-7 times per week when I'm in town, at least sometime throughout the night, if not most of the night.  LuxBar opened in September, 2005, in the historic Gold Coast region of downtown Chicago. LuxBar is yet another huge success by Steve Lombardo and Hugo Ralli, from Gibsons Steakhouse and Hugo's Frog Bar & Fish House fame.  LuxBar was inspired by the work of Adolf Loos whose ""American Bar"" was designed and built in early 20th Century Vienna. The bar captured an elegance in simplicity; a style that greatly influenced the work of Frank Lloyd Wright and other American architects in the ""prairie school."" Stone, glass, brass and wood bathed in natural light, presence in the neighborhood is welcomed and profound. This is a special place by design.   LuxBar is often referred to as a ""neighborhood saloon"" and is designed to convey that same simple elegance, just remember that the neighborhood is where you'll find the 40-something Neurosurgeons and Hedge Fund Managers mixed with the 30-something tourists and the 20-somethings lost from Division and Rush. The food is feel good fresh, natural and easily understood. Artisanal in style, the menu reflects what the partnership views as an accessible cornucopia of what you might eat on just any occasion. I feel like I've tried almost everything on the menu, and have always been extremely pleased. Some of my favorites are the filet mignon sliders, jumbo shrimp cocktail, and jumbo lump crab cake. Sometimes, they don't have what I want on the menu, and I'll have them make me something. My usual is a toned-down Caesar salad with light dressing and grilled chicken. The specialty cocktails are from natural, fresh ingredients: simple elegance. My favorite is starting with a glass or two of Champagne and from there, most of the bartenders mix me up my favorite fruity vodka drinks. Although, the ""Drink Book"" has a very impressive list of specialty cocktails, ""Make Your Own Manhattan,"" wines, drafts, spirits, etc. For example, the bourbon list goes on for 2-3 pages, so you will definitely find anything you're looking for, and much, much more.   The staff at LuxBar is trained in the customer care philosophy that has made Gibsons Steakhouse and Hugo's Frog Bar and Fish House famous for legendary service. I enjoy the pleasant mix between the staff knowing my order and chatting, but not getting too personally involved. I have always received impeccable service. Oh, and for all of you restroom obsessed Yelpers, like most quality bars and restaurants around Division and Rush, there is a restroom attendant who makes sure that not only the restroom stays spotless, that also there are plenty of beauty accoutrements for even the most picky, so make sure to bring some cash to tip accordingly.  Of note... Parking is usually very difficult. The easiest for me, is to take a cab and get dropped off. Also, there is valet across the street for the hotel, which is always very accommodating, if I happen to drive. Private Dining and Party Hosting is Available  Events LuxBar often has seasonal events, so definitely frequently check their website. This Easter Sunday, there will be an appearance from the Easter Bunny from 11am-2pm. Mondays are ""Industry Monday"" with 50% off drinks and appetizers, in the bar only, from 11am-2am. Hours: Mon-Thurs: 11:00 am - 2:00 am  Fri 8:00 am - 2:00 am  Sat 8:00 am - 3:00 am Sun 8:00 am - 2:00 am For more information: luxbar.com I 5/5 highly recommend LuxBar!",0.9962,0.856,0.131,0.013,0.5550818846056941

They boast one of the city's most comprehensive whiskey selections, as well as a respectable draft beer and wine-by-the-glass list, and for that they (would) get five stars.  From the hummus to wedge salad to roasted salmon with celery root to meatloaf with mushroom gravy, food here is usually solid, although never exceptional or moan-inducing -- likely a symptom of being a part of the Gibsons family. I advise against the goopy, tasteless, heartburn-inducing steak and black bean chili, as well as the beef carpaccio, which suffers from a jumble of too many sharp flavors (pickled shallots, balsamic glaze, parmesan). Service, while efficient, rarely offers much in the way of warmth; a smile every now and then would be lovely.

Why not either clearly list it on the menu or serve it on the side? I know I'm not the only person who doesn't like mayo.  Personal pet peeve, but it gets me very riled up.

And the service staff the night of the event were so professional. ***I have to give a special call-out to Kristin (who walked us through the linens and the food and pretty much everything else prior to the event) and Liz (who was there to oversee our event that night). We couldn't have asked any more from both of them and we are very thankful. There was another guy who helped manage the event that night and I cannot remember his name, but he was fantastic, as well. 2. The food. Our friends and family can't stop talking about the food. My personal faves were the filet sliders, beef wellington and the jumbo shrimp cocktail. 3. The venue. When we walked in and saw what the staff had done to prepare for and set up the event my wife and I were blown away. We had something pictured in our minds and without really any specific direction from us the staff nearly executed it exactly how we had hoped! Within 5 minutes of working together the place was perfect and my wife and I had a chance to relax and have a drink prior to our guests arriving. 4. The next day. My wife and I came in for brunch the next day since we had to pick up some of the items the staff had held onto for us (which was awesome that they did this so we didn't have to clean up and take everything away the night of the event). Every item we had given them ahead of time for the event was neatly packaged in the exact same packaging in the exact same manner as it was given to them.

Though I have heard the brand was sold to landry's, which would explain much of this. We were not greeted at the door. We found our own table.   The food came out well before our drinks, clearly a kitchen looking to close up and get us out. The food was fine, nothing memorable. The chips was saturated with oil, as if they temperature of the frier oil wasn't hot enough.  The drinks were solid, but again took a while. There was hair on our table cloth, so clearly not changed between guests, or detailed at the very least. When we asked for dessert the server was quick to say the kitchen was closed, without even giving us a heads up. In my experience, if you done, no matter what time, you get the full experience.

I discovered a piece of plastic in my usual burger. Upon calling the restaurant, they asked me to please bring the burger back so they could show the wait staff. I did, and it was handled very poorly by JJ. JJ, the manager, made it seem like I was making this up and had no clue what had happened. In addition, he said he would credit me for the burger (obviously) and did not offer any apologies, did not take responsibility, or even speak in a sincere tone. He made it seem like I had made up this entire thing, even though he had the evidence right there! I will post a picture. Please, do not order from here.

The Triangle at its best. Lunch/dinner options include some favorites -- all of the sliders are excellent, particularly the filet. The slider combo is by far one of my favorite dishes in this neighborhood to indulge in -- 2 sliders and a side salad for $12?! Literally cannot beat it.  My rub with LuxBar is brunch. I've had brunch at LuxBar a double digit number of times. EVERY SINGLE TIME someone at the table is served raw eggs. Either criminally underdone poached on a benedict or still super slimy over-easy.... I'm talking not cooked to the point that the servers obviously just don't observe the plates of food they are serving. ANY reasonable human could have pointed out these were not palatable eggs. The last time I ordered a veggie benedict, the eggs were literally barely holding their shape. That's how raw they still were.

We had Carrot Cake and Snickers Pie for dessert and the presentation was a topic of conversation - it comes out as massive hunks presented to the table and then gets sliced to individual servings.

I emailed her with questions and she replied the same day with clear answers. I called her about an impromptu visit and she was available. She did not pressure us in any way, shape, or form. The event space was above the LUXBAR restaurant and was divided into two sections by a bar in the middle. There was a fireplace and tall windows that opened out to a small balcony. If we didn't like the furniture they would swap it with something else from another Gibson Group restaurant. They could comfortably accommodate 80 guests on each side of the space allowing us to have a ceremony on one side, switch to the other side for cocktails, then back again for a seated dinner, and move on to dancing. An open bar, passed hors d'oeuvres, and a seated two course dinner for 80 guests including tax and gratuity would cost us $12,500 on a summer Saturday evening. Our guests would have a choice of five entrees. The staff would take care of set up and clean up. If we had decorations they would arrange them for us also. We would have to bring our own dessert or pay more for theirs. We enjoyed dinner at LUXBAR in the restaurant to see if we liked the food. We had Steak Frites and a Birkshire Pork Chop (pictured). Both were seasoned and cook PERFECTLY. The meat could be easily chewed without being too soft. The sauces did not overpower the natural flavors of the meat. I am having a hard time recalling if I've ever had better cooked meat - especially without any direction to the chef. My props to Chef Michael! The fries with the steak were narrowly cut and fried crispy and seasoned. They reminded me of shoestring fries. Even though we were not impressed by the fries we couldn't stop eating them! We finished with a Seasonal Cherry Pie. We loved the crumbly crust and the locally sourced vanilla ice-cream. Beyond that, the pie was satisfying. We enjoyed two of the Build Your Own Manhattan and were delighted that they had high quality options including hand-cut ice. I also had an adult hot chocolate (Jalisco Hot Cocoa) sprinkled with paprika (delicious) followed by the Eventide. The Eventide was surprisingly ah-mazing. It mixed my favorite beer (Left Hand Milk Stout) with Few whiskey among other components. It was smooth, mature, delicately sweet, and creamy. I had two of them! Dinner, dessert, and all of our drinks cost about $150. The service at LUXBAR was incredibly professional. The servers wore black slacks, white shirts, and black ties (even the ladies). They are well accustomed to satisfying the demanding whims of wealthy local seniors and then switching to the unpredictability of tourists.

However, after explaining our wait to the waiter, the rest of our experience was expedited and very pleasant. First, I am not a fan of their Moscow Mule. The ice they use is almost the consistency of a snow cone, so the drink gets watered down quickly and there is not so much of the actual drink inside the mug.  The seasonal Ginger cocktail was quite good though. For food, my favorite dish was the spicy calamari appetizer. The calamari isn't crisp, but it is breaded and sautéed in a delicious sauce with red and green peppers. I also ordered the fried chicken sandwich, with cheese, bacon and apple slaw.  The flavors of everything went well and it was an especially savory sandwich. I'd recommend ordering the half sandwich and trying one of their soups. The rest of my group seemed pleased with their food, when it finally arrived. Two of the guests ordered a couple bottles of wine which were nice to have as we waited for our food. The icing on the cake was that the manager visited our table and apologized for how delayed our service was at the beginning of the meal.  He bought us a round of drinks, but since we were just about through, we ordered a dessert in lieu of more alcohol.  The Snicker's pie is ENORMOUS (enough for 4) but delicious.  I'd save room for this next time I visit!",0.9934,0.827,0.158,0.016,0.5782222222222223

SOOO glad we chose them! The menu is simple, but what they do is great! We got there at 11 for an early lunch, and we were able to choose anyplace in the dining area. We sat by the fireplace, which on a Chicago winter afternoon, is a great place to hang out! The servers always made sure that our water glasses were full, which is always a sign of a great restaurant with great service! We started off with drinks, and I had the El Diabolo, a tequila based drink with ginger beer and cream de casis. It was definitely different...a little bitter but it was good! Between the four of our, we shared two appetizers. One friend and I had the tuna tartare, which really hit the spot! The tuna was very fresh, lightly mayoed and served with a good helping of fresh home chips. I really appreciated that there was more than enough chips for the amount of tartare that was there. The other two had the appetizer mac and cheese. Not the best mac and cheese I've had, but it was definitely good and tasty! Honestly, what drew me in when deciding on coming to the Luxbar was the filet and lobster sliders! It was even better that I found out when we arrived that they had a slider combo with two sliders and a side salad or soup! I also really wanted to try the King Crab bisque, so problem solved! The sliders were.....simply....to die for! The fillets were cooked to a perfect medium rare, which is pretty difficult for the size of the meat! There was also a very large piece of lobster tail on top of the two fillets. Just perfect! The bisque itself was also amazing! Very rich and creamy, however not huge pieces of crab. The flavor of crab within the soup, however, was amazing!  Service was on par, with the waiter showing the perfect amount of attention and not hovering at all. We also never had to ask for a waiter when we needed it! I was a little nervous with the size of the table for four (on the small side), but they cleared plates away very quickly to make sure that everything fit on the table and that we didn't feel crowded.

The servers were friendly and helpful; the restaurant was clean; and the wine was good, but my amish chicken with brown rice and broccoli raab? Kind of meh. My truffle fries? Kind of meh. The bite I had of their sixteen dollar Gourmet Burger? Also kind of meh. Simply put, if you're looking for life-changing food, you won't find it here.

2014-11-03,1.0,"Me and my friends decide to go for a late night dinner around 9:30 pm on Sunday 2nd. Restaurant was 70% empty, host who look like the MOD for the night greet us and present our table. He give us multiple options for seating, very professional from his side, we seat around the fire pit nice and cozy. The server from the other side was complete opposite. His eye contact was to the bare minimum, no suggestion on food or drinks what so ever, he was floating around with his look during he was interacting with us. He was acting like we need to order, eat and go asap. He took our drink orders and serve it to us, and the time till he took our food order he was saying to us "" I'll be right with you "" almost 4 times going back and forward in the kitchen and out on the empty restaurant.  Finally we order our food and it came out with no long wait, but here it is my friend had a question about her dish. We kind flag our server passing by our table and again I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU. Omg dude at least stop and see what is the issue STOP walking and talking to your guest who you making money out off. Probably multitasking wasn't your strong side then send someone else to check on us, don't live your guest waiting longer then it needs. If you need to be cut off early then your time, or you need to GO and we are your last table, don't rush us and give the table to the closing server, is that simple. And last but not least there is the check with wrong item ringed on and the veggies who my friend switch for her unsatisfying meal where added on as extra food, my scotch was ringed as other scotch who was more expensive. I ask our server  about the bill and he was surprised and made a comment OH THERE ARE THERE I FORGOT.  Guess what my dear friend the people who you serve on Sunday night are in the same industry like you are. Your Bar/Restaurant lost 4 guests who never gonna come back again.

The servers are professional, attentive, and prompt but not overbearing. Frankly, this is exactly how wait staff should do things! A definite hat-tip to them for having their act together. The food, in general, is quite good. Luxbar is owned by the same company as some other popular Gold Coast places and they clearly use the same suppliers, which equates to some high-quality food without the inflated prices. I am a particularly big fan of the burgers and I believe they've been consistently top-rated in the city for a number of years.

Tasted his French Chardonnay, which was similarly light and fitting for this meal. Note: I was not a fan of the lipped wine glasses.  Roasted beet salad was so beautiful! I asked for it to be served on a bed of greens and they happily obliged. The light-handed dressing and large chunks of blue cheese scattered throughout pleased me. It was a large portion and I was happy to bring home leftovers.  Steak salad with iceberg lettuce cooked medium was made just as ordered.

2014-03-31,2.0,"Being new to Chicago, it is a new concept for me to have to make a reservation nearly every time I eat out. With that being said, I finally learned my lesson and made a reservation for my boyfriend and I to dine at Luxbar on a Friday night. Unfortunately, making a reservation does not always shield you from the effects of an over-crowded restaurant.  We were seated near the host stand (UGHHHH) and a family of four waited to be seated with their backs literally touching our table. Standing in front of our table, they also blocked the television so we couldn't watch the basketball game which was our reason for going out. The table behind us was so close that there wasn't room for the server to get between our chairs. The server had to pass my drinks/plates down the table to get them to me.  Busboys tried to take my half-eaten burger away like 3 times before I was finished! Didn't even ask if I was finished the first time. I know I may be a small woman but I would like to finish my meal...thanks. Then to top if off the server brought us our check without asking if we wanted anything else. We were 100% planning to hang out and drink for a few hours! Instead we paid and went somewhere else for more drinks. Definitely got the vibe that they wanted us out in order to seat everyone that was hoovering over our meal.  On the positive side, the Gourmet Burger (medium rare), fries, grapefruit cocktale, and club sandwich was great.

It is huge and can feed at least 3 people.  The service has been hit or miss but never completely terrible. It is usually pretty slammed and they like to put the tables close together.

2014-02-16,2.0,"Luxbar was underwhelming and overwhelming at the same time. A group of six of us came in this weekend around noon for brunch and right off the bat, I was apprehensive about the atmosphere.  For the overwhelming part, it was packed at noon this weekend for brunch - not surprising, but the way they pack those tables together is just horrible! We had a table in the back corner on the first floor next to the fireplace, which was nice until they seated the tables around us. I had to scoot my chair in closer to the table (TOO close to the table) in order to not hit the girl sitting behind me. At one point in time, I was trying to talk to the two girls next to me but it was literally so loud in the restaurant that they couldn't hear me, even when I was yelling.  On the underwhelming side, the service was barely there - took our orders, dropped the food off, and never checked back. The bus boy who cleared our table used my dining space to collect and re-organize the plates he was carrying and at one point even left a few of my friends' half-eaten dishes in front of me because he couldn't carry them. It was super uncomfortable and just all around not even the minimum service I would expect. The food was uninspired...I mean, I got oatmeal, so I wasn't looking for anything too special, but the pomegranate jam had little flavor and the oatmeal itself seemed to be overcooked. The ladies I was with ordered a variety of soups and salads and I didn't hear anyone even comment on their food, much less rave about it.  The more I eat in the Gold Coast, the more I'm feeling like the food there is overrated...hoping to find a restaurant soon that debunks that thought, but Luxbar was not the place.",0.9423,0.896,0.075,0.029,0.46745238095238084

To try and sweeten the deal, I suggested we hit Luxbar afterward. Manhattan's have become hot. Personally, I have an aversion to scotch, whiskey and many other brown liquors, but when it comes to Manhattan's, I have his back. I follow 312DD's blog and saw a feature on Luxbar's Make Your Own (Rye) Manhattan special for the month of February; strangely, the menu isn't really promoted. If you're interested, ask for it - had I not read about it, I don't think we would've been the wiser. I wasn't sure what to expect from Luxbar; I intentionally avoid the Viagra Triangle whenever possible. Frankly, I was pleasantly surprised; while the decor seems very classy and upscale, on a Saturday afternoon the vibe was quite casual. He started out with the bartender's signature Manhattan and then followed up with his own creation choosing his rye, vermouth, bitters and type of ice. I went with the Red Azalea, at the recommendation of our server. We loved our drinks; mine, a mix of vodka, shiraz and mulling spices was surprisingly excellent. We also had a snack, the seared yellowfin appetizer; good, but nothing so unique it would warrant a trip back for it.

2013-11-20,2.0,"This was my go to brunch spot in my neighborhood for the past several months.  At one time coming here on a weekly basis.  The breakfast items are fantastic.  Great eggs benedict, omelets, etc.  Nice bar with plenty of options for brunch style cocktails, and a great little front patio for nice days. So why two stars?  I ate dinner here.   To start off the menu on here, their website, and in the restaurant are all completely different.  So don't explore the menu, as they don't find it necessary to update it.   We started with a couple of appetizers: Lobster Bisque and shrimp cocktail.  The lobster bisque was great as usual, but the cocktail sauce for the shrimp was pretty much just ketchup.  I added more horseradish, but it was old and jarred so had no heat or flavor.  The waitress wasn't very good throughout the meal.  She couldn't explain dishes, didn't talk to us (seemed shy), and had no recommendations for anything.  Had a bottle of wine, which wasn't good by any means as the wine list is non existent, and when the girl bought it she just unscrewed it and filled our glasses.  First time i've ever bought a bottle and not at least been shown the label. Now for the reason I won't be coming here anymore.  I had browsed the menu via Yelp and saw they had a 10 oz filet for $38, and was excited to have that for my meal.  As I said the menu online (everywhere) isn't the one you get here so obviously my steak was no longer available.  I asked about it and the waitress said they had a 7oz filet still so I opted for it.  When my bill arrived she showed me that I had a reduced price because it was only 7 oz; total $38.  I said that the 10 oz online was that price already and thought surely I would be charged less as it was 30% smaller.  I was told I saw the menu wrong, that it use to be $41, and I had already received my discount. Well Luxbar, it was nice knowing you.  I hate being lied to, over charged, and treated poorly.  So I hope your $10 or so you gouged me for is worth the couple hundred dollars in business I brought you month over month, not to mention bringing my friends in.  I will not be back, and I can only hope that you don't take advantage of all your customers.",0.8359,0.819,0.102,0.08,0.6086186186186187

2013-08-20,4.0,"While in Chicago last weekend for one of the greatest rivalry's in baseball, the Cardinals vs.the Cubs, my friends and I woke up with some empty stomachs. With the much anticipated game approaching rather fast we all decided that we needed to get ready and go somewhere for brunch. The lady that we were staying with (my friends aunt) decided on taking us to Luxbar. It was one of the only places she could think of that serves brunch and she insisted that it was delicious. Now let me tell you, she was right on the money. After reading the menu I decided to go with one of my favorite breakfast dishes, the breakfast burrito. When the waiter finally approached with our food I could not believe my eyes, the size of this burrito was very unexpected. When ordering a breakfast burrito at most places I'm expecting them to be a decent size but not this large. At the moment I laid eyes on my plate I became overwrought with joy. My first and much anticipated bite I couldn't of been more pleased. The combination of egg, chorizo, peppers and onions were in perfect ratio with one an other. But that wasn't it, BLACK BEANS !!!!!! I have never had a breakfast burrito with black beans. With my love for black beans I was completely overjoyed. This was definitely one of the best breakfast burritos I have ever had. Beside from the food the service was excellent. There was never a time through out the whole meal where I had to wait for a drink or even ask for a refill. The waiter we had was also very knowledgeable about the restaurant and the food he was serving. Luxbar also gets some or all, (I cant remember what he said), their food from a local farm near Chicago. Personally to me a cow is a cow and a chicken is a chicken, but to you whom care about such things I thought you should know. All in all luxbar is a great place for brunch. Everyone in the party enjoyed their food and as you can see I enjoyed mine. Thanks for reading and if you ever venture to the windy city and wake up to late for breakfast or too early for lunch try some brunch at......... Luxbar.",0.9979,0.808,0.189,0.003,0.5359422492401216

Tomato and Grilled Cheese soup  -my buddy had it and said he liked it, smooth and creamy Steak and Chili beans soup- rich, nicely done, good quality of meat, a hearty soup. As mentioned the filet mignon sliders were nice, and we also had the filet mignon dish, nice and tender.  This place has also a decent varieties of beers and we tried a few from microbreweries. We liked them all, Goose Island 312, Cross Of Gold, Sofie.

Others at my table had meatloaf and salad, and everyone loved their food. Waiter service was generally good - he was very pleasant and attentive, but there were a couple of times when we were wondering where he was. We had several birthdays in our group, so dinner finished with us sharing a giant, sinfully good piece of cake.  Overall, I can't give this place a perfect 5 because we did have slow service.

2012-01-29,4.0,"I've given Luxbar 4 stars for its overall appeal as an accessible, easy place to dine in and socialize with above average food.  I've been to Lux several times, but after dining here tonight with my husband, our two babies (aged one and two), and my mother-in-law, I am compelled to share our experience.  I was, at first, apprehensive about how we would be greeted with our two little babes in tow, and I was pleasantly surprised.  The hostess jumped to open the door for our stroller, and the two hostesses and a few servers at the hostess stand were visibly pleased to see us, smiling at our babies and welcoming us in.  They took our stroller and stored it for us, happily, I might add.  They brought us to a very comfortable and spacious booth in the back of the dining room where we would be out of everyone else's way, which allowed us to relax a bit not having to worry that we were disturbing anyone.  Our server was very hurried and a bit annoyed he had the table with the kids, but it barely affected our service. (He did have to be prompted to bring out the kids' meals ASAP, but I wouldn't expect anyone but a parent to be aware of how important something like this is.  He brought them out soon after we asked him to, though, when we realized that they wouldn't be coming out early).  Needless to say, it was nice to be welcomed so warmly with a family in a place in this neighborhood. We had the chicken tenders appetizer and a side of mac n cheese (for the kids, obviously, although they both were delicious) the beet salad, a variety of the sliders, and, of course, the truffle fries.  I, personally, love coming to Lux for their sliders, as they never disappoint.  We had the filet, the turkey burger, and the buttermilk fried chicken sliders.  I usually order something like the hummus plate, the beet salad, and the sliders, and it is always consistently good.  I think that this is the thing that I like best about the food at Luxbar-it is ALWAYS consistently good.  The variety of option on the menu is great, I always know what I am going to get, and I have to say that many places really struggle with consistency.  So, I suppose that this is why when I am eating out in the GC, Lux usually is the first place to jump to mind. The only thing that I don't love about Luxbar is when I've been there later on in the evenings, it is so noisy that you cannot hear a thing.  Aside from that, and seeing that my kids have solved that problem, I will for sure be going back to this great GC spot, especially once they get that patio re-opened in the summertime. One more thing...there was a group of guys sitting at the booth across the room from us, their table littered with frosty copper mugs.  This means only one thing: Luxbar serves MOSCOW MULES!!!  Amazeballs...if you don't know what this is, just go and find out for yourself.  Best vodka drink EVER!!!",0.9987,0.769,0.199,0.031,0.5482777777777779

It was really good, just the right amount of alcohol vs sweet and sour. However, as good as that Cosmo was, I had a bit of drink envy when I took a sip of my friend's Lavender Lemon Drop Martini.

2012-01-05,3.0,"I had dinner here with friends after we waited a little too long to make reservations at another restaurant we were hoping to try. (Gilt Bar, for the record, which I've heard nothing but good things about from my friends in the Chicago area.) We were able to make same-day reservations at Luxbar for our group of six and were seated immediately upon arrival.  The tables were all really close together, as some others have said, but we were seated in a booth at the back and had plenty of room on and around our table. We started out with the hummus plate (delicious + generous), calamari (didn't try but heard no complaints from my friends), and shrimp cocktail (it's pretty hard to screw this one up). Those who ordered drinks were disappointed by the price/size ratio.  There is a lot on the menu, from comfort food (fried chicken or meatloaf) to burgers to sandwiches and salads, to fish + steak entrees. I ordered the braised short ribs and they were delicious -- cooked perfectly and seasoned well. However, everything else that was ordered at my table (salmon, a burger, and a filet) left us nonplussed. The burger especially was disappointing. It looked like they'd left off the meat, but we finally found it by peeling apart the layers. It was thinner than a Wendy's patty and my friend said it wasn't much tastier. It DID have a fried egg on it, so that was sort of a consolation prize for the beef deficiency. Hence the three stars -- at a place like Luxbar, with beautiful decor and prices that, while not outrageous, aren't exactly cheap, either -- the menu shouldn't be a minefield. It seems like they're trying to do too many things; maybe if they pared down their menu they could focus on doing a few things well.",0.9905,0.773,0.166,0.061,0.5779835390946502

The vibe inside is hot. Fun. Flirty. Loud. Perfectly expected and openly accepted. It's a place where you want to bring your friends, date, one night stander...whatever the case calls for. It's a happening spot that seemed to be popping inside and out for the time we were there. Rather than taking a seat outside, we opted for the bar area and crammed the lot of us into one of the bar tables and ordered up. The service was quick and very attentive. Never were our glasses empty from the bottles of wine that were drifting onto our table. We ended up ordering: Sirloin Sliders: Small, cute, bite-sized. DEVOURED. Don't let their size fool you, they're tender slices of tasty glory that will get you salivating.  Truffle Fries: Oh sweet hell-foodgasm. That is all.  Great service, that was unexpected with such a busy crowd. I was completely sold with the truffle fries. The scent brought me in and the taste hooked in the carbolicious treat. I would definitely want to try Luxbar for a full sit-down dining experience and really experience it that way, but for this trip, 4 starros is well deserved.

No biggie. Then it took a long time for him to come back for our food order. Still not overly concerned. The place was definitely packed. Then it took a LONG LONG time for our food to arrive.

Oh a lovely spread of horrendously dry corned beef hash encrusted with chunks of blackened burntness. I tried to salvage what I could, being starving and all, and broke open one of my poached eggs in the hopes that the yolk would add a bit of moisture to the mess. No luck. The poached egg was hardboiled. I'm a good sport (or an optimistic fool) so I take a bite, and find that my hardboiled egg is laden with pockets of vinegar...  so now my mouth is filled with burnt, dry, hardboiled , vingarness and the manager breezes by our table to ask if everything is OK, but keeps moving, not waiting for a response.

I wanted to reply effortlessly, ""LUXBAR, of course!""  But, like many things in the culinary world that have left me unsatisfied, my visions of LUXBAR were not to be. LUXBAR is just so...underwhelming.   First of all, the hostess was a downright bitch (and, interestingly enough, someone my dining companion had worked with at another restaurant in a whole other state about 8 years ago in college -- apparently this is not new behavior for her).  Luckily the hostess didn't recognize my friend, however, I think she said something along the lines of, ""So, are you here for lunch, or what?"" which *could* be some kind of warm greeting in the Land of Biotch, but I'm not completely sure on that one.   We were seated at possibly the worst table in the whole place (granted, I had no reservation, so beggars shouldn't be choosers on a Sunday morning, but c'mon -- the place wasn't nearly full!) so we had the luxury of listening to Princess Bad Attitude of the SS LUXBAR chatter on the phone and critique the customers (so help you lady with the ""cheap"" Chanel bag and the dark roots wherever you are because that hostess tore you a new one).  She would occasionally break from her customer-slamming to either text or seat someone.  But there was no visible rhyme or reason as to how long she would force people to just stand around awkwardly before she would acknowledge them. The waitress apparently went to the LUXBAR School of Restaurant Etiquette as well because her personality was just as sparkling.  When she could be found, that is. Anyway, that doesn't even really phase me anymore, unfortunately. What I was really disappointed in was the food.  There were few meat-less options and so I went with the Roasted Portobello Sandwich and evidently there was a big sale on arugula that day.  Because that's essentially what my meal consisted of.  Arugula salad on a piece of bread.  Yawn.  My friend had the sliders which she loved, so LUXBAR gets a star for that.  And, I will admit that the truffle fries are a strong contender for ""best fries I've ever eaten"" and that's impressive since my diet is 75% fried potatoes (not really, but it totally should be).  So all in all, I would consider the food to be the gastronomic equivalent of the guy (or girl) you dated in 9th grade; sure, it was fine for that moment, but it's not something you are really going to care about much and will most likely forget about in six months anyway. There is one thing I love about LUXBAR, that I will always love about LUXBAR and, try as I might, cannot find a Milwaukee-based equal for: the Bloody Marys!  I am not, by nature, a huge fan of the great hangover drink, but for whatever reason I cannot understand, LUXBAR has the best ones I've ever had.  I am continuing my search for a ""local"" version of the LUXBAR bloody with no success (a few close calls, but no winners...yet).  And, for that, and that alone, I give LUXBAR an A-OK rating.  This place will carry a (tiny) piece of my vodka-loving heart with it, always.  Damn. 2 people; 2 entrees, 1 app, 3 (delicious delicious) bloody  marys about $70",0.9695,0.764,0.133,0.103,0.5451399238284484

Fairly early on a Saturday we stopped by for lunch. There was no table for two available outside, so we sat inside. I'm fairly certain if they could stack tables on top of each other, they would. The tables on the sidewalk are smooshed so close to each other, if you're looking to make friends, sit outside.  The food was very good. I had the Cross Town Classic burger, a brat patty with a butterflied polish sausage, sauerkraut, onions and mustard on a pretzel bun. It was delicious. I was starving when I got there and between the meat sandwich and the fries it was the perfect lunch for a lazy day of shopping. I've also had the sesame crusted tuna salad, and it was divine. A perfectly light salad with seared tuna, just the right amount of seaweed amongst the lettuce, red and yellow peppers, and a ginger-wasabi dressing. Ooohhh so good.  Of course, you can always order a Gibson steak here. Of course, why not just go to Gibson's if that's what you're looking for? If you're at Luxbar, enjoy some of their tasty creations.

The burger stacks up pretty well to many burgers across the city. The bacon? Perfect slabs of pork cooked to crispiness. The fried egg did not explode so the burger maintained its integrity. I didn't have to lace the burger with condiments to enjoy it and it definitely whetted my appetite.

Kris had the Autumn Harvest salad-brussel sprout leaves, arugula, butternut squash, wild mushrooms, dried cherries, pumpkin seeds, bacon, beet chips and mustard vinaigrette.

The chicken tenders are generous in size and the honey-mustard dipping sauce will make you say 'yum.' The wings are tasty and the people I was with went to town on the silders (I am not a big beef fan).

The burgers are fantastic and even though I'm not a big burger queen, I love them.  They have wonderful hand cut truffle fries - crispy and seasoned perfectly.  The salads are huge and my favorite is the seared ahi tuna - rare and just not just a couple of pieces of tuna.  The salads are a meal and repeatedly come here to try them all out.   Next door is the Original Pancake house which is always busy on weekend mornings but what many people don't know is that LuxBar serves breakfast - it's a great selection of eggs, omelettes, pancakes and a beautifully served lox platter.  I'll take a mimosa please!  Thank you LuxBar, I think I will!   I can come here with my husband and have a great meal and time, I can visit with my girlfriends and have a great meal and people watching and I can come here with my small kids and not feel like we don't belong there.  It caters to everyone and serves up some great food!",0.9971,0.766,0.22,0.014,0.682282913165266
2010-12-01,4.0,"How do I sum up my feelings about and experiences of Lux Bar? It's almost impossible, but here we go.  **Brunch** Lux Bar used to have a brunch buffet upstairs on the weekends, but even after abandoning the brunch bar, brunch is still excellent. Lux Bar follows in the tradition of Hugo's and Gibson's around the corner (conceptualized and owned by the same group) in their brunch menu. The menu isn't exactly what I would call innovative, but it's incredibly high quality.  **Burgers** You just can't go wrong. Again like Hugo's and Gibson's, these burgers are large, juicy, and lovely. Take it from a burger aficionado - I'd definitely recommend the burgers here. The filet mignon sliders with truffle butter are also really, really good.  **Fried chicken** You can get a bucket of super high quality fried chicken, and though you might have a heart attack after eating it, it's so worth it. Crispy, juice, salty.... it's all good.  **Drinks** All the drinks are yummy, but my new favorite is the ""Two Passions,"" which has passion fruit and pineapple juices with vodka. It was so good that I had three before I knew it the last time I was in town.  **Dessert** While the dessert menu isn't as extensive as that at Hugo's and Gibson's, the desserts are certainly still on the same scale, by which I mean HUGE. Seriously, don't order a dessert for fewer than four people. These desserts are sumptuous, indulgent, and oh so good.  **Atmosphere** Lux Bar is always fun, always packed, and always feels like a party. It can get a little loud in there at night sometimes, but these is a great place to run and grab an upscale-casual bite and/or drink. I love swinging by when I have tons of energy but don't necessarily want to go somewhere very far or very fussy.  **Negatives**  - There are only a couple of things I don't like about Lux Bar. Living in the neighborhood (across the street, actually) the fact that they keep all the doors open on the second floor all night every night during the summer is a major detractor. It's fun if you're on the inside, but not if you're on the outside trying to conduct your life. It's very loud, always, inside and out, and you have to be in the mood for that much noise (even on a quiet night).  - While the servers are always efficient, they're not always the most friendly (nor are the hostesses) . Other than that, I think Lux Bar is great and I'd really recommend it (and a number of things off the menu) to anyone.",0.999,0.735,0.244,0.021,0.5541904337492574

Now that's good service for regular customers. It was way too hot to eat out in the street tables, but the inside didn't at all feel like a red-headed stepchild to the outdoor setting. Just eating there made me feel like I was really cool, and the place had a very young and funky vibe. The list of specialty cocktails and mixed drinks were quite extensive, as well as the wine list. There weren't a lot of food options outside of burgers and sandwiches, but they had a whitefish special that was prefect and pretty tasty. Prices are quite reasonable for the area. Our server misunderstood that we wanted salads before entrees and brought them out at the same time, but he brought back our entrees and had the kitchen remake them after we'd finished the salads without a fuss.

The tables are placed in a simple manner, yet they manage to look very elegant. Service is very quick and the menu is relatively cheap, offering a variety of specialties. I was introduced to the joint by a friend and have begun to introduce my other friends to it, too. So far, all good responses. My favorites on the menu are the Colby Slider and the Truffle fries. There's something warm and comforting about a burger and fries but this combination just reinvents the classic and just takes taste to a whole new level from the second it hits the palate. The beef in this particular patty is perfectly moist and paired simply with caramelized onions and truffle butter. Honestly, doesn't get any better when it comes to sliders. The fries are also to-die-for. Though they may be a couple dollars overpriced ($7), you do receive a generous portion and are obviously paying for the truffle oil the potatoes are cooked in. To finish off the plate, the frites are dusted off with plenty of Parmesan cheese and parsley. I can go on and on about the entrees but to be completely honest, I would say skip out on the dessert and grab some ice cream or gelato from a nearby shop.

2010-06-23,2.0,"After a rather mediocre lunch yesterday all I wanted was to sit outside and stuff my face with fried chicken. Yep, I'm easy to please. Met Keri H here (and I'm supposed to mention that hell hath indeed frozen over since she arrived before I did), who was sitting at the bar, enjoying a glass of wine. We went outside to look for a table and were greeted by the host who said that there was nothing available but would take our name and let us know when a table opened. Fine. We went back to the bar and I needed a drink. The bartender never once made eye-contact with me so I finally asked to see a drink menu. He gave me a wine list, but there were no cocktails listed, so I asked to see a martini list. He obliged by practically throwing me a menu. I ordered something called a Luxbar Sling, which was Stoli Blueberry, Stoli Razz, muddled strawberries, lime , and club soda. Sounds delicious, right? It was a little boring actually, and it didn't help that it was made by the most apathetic bartender ever. He never smiled, engaged us in friendly banter or even seemed like he wanted to be there at all. A little while later I needed to pay a visit to the ladies room and asked the bartender where it was. To my chagrin, he told me it was ""upstairs"" and since I am on crutches, I braced myself for the trek. Thankfully, Keri remembered that they had an elevator I could use instead of the stairs. Why the bartender couldn't have told me that, I have no idea. I hobbled to the elevator and I couldn't figure out what floor since there was no signage of any kind. I just guessed at the second floor and walked out practically into a busser's station. I asked him where I could find the ladies room and he pointed down a hall. It was just weird. Anyway, I got back to the bar and ordered another drink. I didn't feel like picking anything different out so I went with the same drink I started with. This time it came with muddled blueberries instead of strawberries. It didn't fare any better and so much for consistency when making cocktails. We noticed that we had been waiting awhile for our table, so Keri went to check the status. She was talking to the host a long time before she motioned for me to come out as they finally had our table. I asked her what happened and she said the host didn't have our name and acted surprised that we were looking for our table. I wasn't that surprised; that's the kind of stuff they pull at Gibson's too - saving tables for ""regulars"" who may or may not deign to eat there on that given night, but god forbid you don't have a table for them. So the rest of us stare at the open tables wishing we could sit down. As I mentioned, I wanted fried chicken so there was no pondering of the menu for me. Keri ordered some kind of whitefish and a side of mac and cheese and we also split an order of guacamole to start. The guacamole was pretty good; it had a nice little kick to it and the chips were crispy and fresh. It was quite an ample portion as well. Our main courses arrived. My chicken came with hand-cut fries which were fantastic. The chicken was really greasy (kind of par for the course, I realize, but this was overwhelmingly so) and the breading, while crispy,  wasn't really stuck to the chicken and kind of fell off when you took a bite. It was good enough, but I want to eat the crispy crust on the chicken, not off the plate. Keri said her fish was not good and that it tasted like ass. Well, she didn't really say that, but I can't recall the actual adjective she used. Ever the asparagus whore she is, she didn't even eat all of that which came on the side, so that must not have been good either. Underwhelmed, we paid our bill and left.

Ordered the slider combo, which comes with your choice of two sliders and either a soup or salad. I had the Wisconsin cheddar ale soup with the filet mignon and kobe burger sliders. The kobe burger slider with caramelized onions was good but the filet mignon slider was fantastic--I'll be ordering two of those next time.

I ordered the Filet Mignon and Turkey slider along with the steak and black bean soup. The Filet Mignon slider was VERY tender and juicy. Flavoring was a little bland for me. The turkey slider was good but a little on the salty side. My favorite part was the steak and black bean soup. I added all the toppings for an additional $2 (cheese, macaroni, onions, sour cream and jalepenos). The food orders in my group were good as well, but I can't recall what everyone had.  Friend 1: Which sliders do you recommend? I'm looking at the filet mignon and pulled pork. Server: They're all good. Maybe the pulled pork.  Friend 1: Hmm...maybe I'll get the combo and try both. a few minutes later.... Friend 2: What do you recommend on the menu? Server: Everything is good.  Friend 2: Have you tried _____? Server: No. I'm a vegetarian Friend 1: ?!?!?! WTF??!?! (Why did she recommend the pulled pork?!) ANYWAY! Service here was inattentive and slow. After getting our food, it took a REALLY long time for the server to come back to check on us and it was nearly impossible to flag her down. There was a problem with our order because my friends REALLY hate pickles in their food, and they brought out the sliders with pickles in them after they already requested their food without pickles. After sending it back, all they did was take the pickles off (uh, hello! if that was all we needed, we would've just done that ourselves!). The pickle juice was still on the bun. After many failed attempts to get our server's attention (she was busy talking to her friends at the bar), we finally asked the bus boy (who was GREAT by the way. very attentive and on top of things!) to talk to the manager. We just wanted to let him know that the service was bad and that not only did they mess up on an order, they refused to fix it. The manager comped my friend's meal and apologized for the bad service. Maybe we were just unlucky and came on the server's off/bad day. Overall, I'd say food was good but the service left a bad taste.",0.9911,0.759,0.162,0.079,0.5123219373219374
2010-04-27,4.0,"Luxbar is a bit of a jack of all trades place, and your experience here can vary greatly not only day to day but also depending on what you head there for whether it be brunch, dinner, late night dining or drinks. Although I've experienced probably every type of experience Luxbar has on offer this review focuses on my most recent experience for brunch. Food: 4/5 The general consensus around the table was the food was good, not amazing but good. I had an omelette, it was fluffy and fairly large and the filling was fresh (ham, peppers, mushroom) Booze:4/5 The bloody mary was pretty good but I've had better. I bumped this section to 4/5 because I know from previous experience that they have an impressive booze selection here and some of their more signature drinks are very good. Service:5/5 Attentive, quick, polite. It wasn't terribly busy but I had absolutely no complaints about the service. Ambiance 4.5/5 It's a viagra triangle staple, need I say more? Nearly every place in a 1 block radius is nice and the place is owned by Gibsons so you know the ambiance is gonna be trendy/upscale. Value:3.5/5 The place isn't cheap, you could go next door to the original pancake house and have a better brunch for cheaper (but they don't have booze - I need my bloody's) but it's not expensive either. The ingredients are quality, the ambiance is nice and the service is good so to an extent you are getting your money's worth. However, that being said I generally wouldn't opt to come here for brunch (hell I wouldn't come to the river north/gold coast area at all for brunch) because I know what can be found elsewhere, but if you're in the area it's not a bad option by any means.",0.9912,0.773,0.172,0.055,0.6195238095238096

2010-03-30,4.0,"Another long over due review from another great restaurant/bar in Chicago. I ventured in for brunch last Saturday and realized I had yet to review this place to begin with.  If you're coming in for brunch on the weekends, it's going to be a long wait, but it's certainly worth it. You can always try to snag a table in the cocktail area as well which is what I would prefer as it's better for people watching. In the summertime, they've got an awesome patio which is fantastic for day drinking as well as people watching.  Lux was voted one of the best brunches in the city, so I knew I had to get in on this. They have continental breakfast options, plenty of fluffy omelets, pancakes, french toast (the norm). I wanted to stay healthy so I stuck to the Steel Cut Oatmeal with brown sugar and raisins on the side. YUM. Oatmeal typically doesn't have the best presentation and usually comes out looking like a bowl of mush. I'm not sure how they make theirs, but it came out fluffy, light and amazing. I had a side of the Turkey Patties and the Applewood Smoked Bacon as well, both of which were great choices.  Other than that, the bf had an omelet which he loved (I didn't try because of the mushrooms he put in there) and the side of hash were perfectly crispy. Everything was hot off the press and ready to be consumed. The chef was coming around to all the tables making sure things were fine as well which is always a nice touch. Service is always quick and friendly. They serve their Bellinis old school in larger glasses and I was in love. Love my champagne cocktails in the morning. Other than that, the dinner and nightlife scene is great. This is one of the few establishments I would choose to frequent in the Viagra Triangle. Typically when I'm there, I do appetizers and drinks to keep it light. You can't go wrong with the Shrimp Cocktail, House Cured Salmon, Tuna Tartare and the Crab Cakes.

My five star rating is based not just on the food, but also on the terrific and friendly service we always receive from servers like Brooke.  We eat there so often, many of the staff are like family.  Unfortunately, we can no longer enjoy Brooke's friendly and efficient service.  She's been let go by the restaurant, apparently, at least in part, due to Misty B's review.  I just think that we Yelpers need to be careful when we criticize a particular employee by name.  Anyone can have a bad day, and a customer can certainly take a comment in a way it was not intended.  We're going to miss Brooke's winning personality going forward.",0.9812,0.727,0.197,0.076,0.591710940574577

The one thing about the bar area that should be addressed is the narrow aisle between the tables and bar.  I'd love a little more room to be able to squeeze through there. The crowd is generally 30s and up in the bar area.  You'll find it to be a mix of locals and out-of-towners.  There's usually eye candy in here that's more toned down than what you'd see next door at Tavern, so there will be less laughs generated from the people watching.  For some reason, it's easy to spot people you've seen out and about town in this place.

I asked the hostess if they had a coat check and she replies, ""yeah, it's in the back"" so I inquire if I needed to walk to the back to check my coat and she tells me that she'll do it, it's just in the back. Really lady? Is your job so hard and stressful seating all these hungry tourists all day that you can't do your job and take me and my date's coat? No. it's not. you just suck.  OK, fine whatever. Our table is finally ready and when they take us to our seats, it's at a high top basically still in the bar. I look at the hostess and tell her, that I'd like to wait for another table. Seriously? A high top? I didn't make reservations at a restaurant where I'm going to drop 200 on food and drink to sit at a bar table. So we go back to the bar and wait for another table.

The patty was dry and bland, possibly bland because I wasn't eating the onions, but still. Our server was attentive and very sweet. i would definitely try it again for lunch, but stay far away from the t.b. I had a glass of wine with my sister one night after dinner. It was great. It was around 10, and they informed us we could only stay on the patio a short while- what is with that law, by the way? 11pm?! The wine was reasonably priced and very good. Not too large of a selection, but definitely gives options. We had the same server I had had for lunch. She seemed a little flustered at night; perhaps she had worked all day. It wasn't too busy. Lots of people watching and listening. It is the Viagra Triangle... I liked Luxbar. I think it is a nice spot for drinks with a girlfriend or coworker. Definitely not some place I would want to hang out on a Friday night, but there isn't really anywhere around there I want to be on a Friday night.

2008-07-14,3.0,"I hate... HATE the Viagra Triangle area. I really do. There is a certain feel that makes me want to come home and take 15 showers. Perhaps it is because I'm not a wealthy 50 year old male looking to hook up with a 18 to 24 year old girl. Or with a hooker. However despite this wonderful and Disney clean feeling, Luxbar is a place I would return to. The place is full of dark oak, which lends itself very well to hiding in the shadows to avoid the ex wife that just walked in. A large bar area to wet my whistle and enjoy some conversation with a girl barely the age of 22 and flaunting everything God and a plastic surgeon gave her before she snubs me for a potential sugar daddy. But I digress.... The food is good, is it groundbreaking? No, but fairly solid. The drinks are good, decent beer selection, though not one to get a martini here, several friends have enjoyed them here. Service can be a bit spotty, especially when the place is packed to the top with people, though usually fairly good.

I had wine with dinner so I can't comment on how well the drinks were made, but my date said his Jack and Coke tasted just fine.  The waiter was very nice and the manager even stopped by our table to ask how our evening was going.  The hostesses are tall and busty and overall, the scene was very happening.  There was a lot of fun people watching, too. Bathrooms are upstairs; the ladies room is all mirrors inside (including the stall doors) which made it a bit confusing to see which one was occupied.  Luckily, there was a bathroom attendant to call out which ones were free.  There is another small bar area upstairs and what looked like a room that can be used or private parties.  The bar upstairs was pretty dead so it would be a good place to hang out if you got tired of the crowd downstairs. Overall, I loved this place and would definitely go back.  Lux Bar would be great for all different kinds of events...dates, parties, group dinners, etc.  I think it would be a fun place for brunch as well.  The prices are reasonable and I really enjoyed my evening here.",0.9992,0.679,0.268,0.053,0.5587347374847375

The only downside that we had was that we were trying to watch the Bears game and the TV's on our side of the bar had another game on them.  We asked several people to change the station and finally found a manager who was able to do so- but we missed part of the game.  Oh well- we lost anyway!

After being shuffled between the two hostess stands, we were seated immediately at a table outside. We were seated between the bee-filled flower pots and the bee-filled condiment cart. There is not much they can do about this, but they did place vinegar cups around to discourage them from swarming. Our server was excellent. She had many tables and handled them promptly and courteously. When our food arrived, it was nearly perfect. The fresh made croissant was tasty, the omlette had a generous amount of ingredients in it, and the fruit cup was nicely varied. The bacon, however, was still uncooked on one end. We finally reached a server and asked to have it crispy instead. What they brought us was burnt crisp! So, no bacon for us. Unfortunatley, the charge was still on our check when it arrived.  Two Warnings: The morning cocktails (Mimos and Screwdriver) were very expensive. (No prices on the menu either.)  If you make your reservation via OpenTable, verify that they are giving you credit. Although I checked at both stations and told them I had a reservation, they neglected to give me credit.

We got there way past midnight, but the manager said that the upstairs bar area also serves as a dance floor. When we were there, it was pretty empty - so I'll take his word for it.
