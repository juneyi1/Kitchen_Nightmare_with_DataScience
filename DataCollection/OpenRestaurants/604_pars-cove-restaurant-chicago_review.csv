2017-08-26,5.0,"Before I start my review let me  state that I am not Persian and had never had Persian food (although plenty of Middle Eastern/Turkish/eta), so my review might be slightly biased.  We came here with a Groupon since my family was in town and I always wanted to try it. It's such a small cute place. The host/hostess are absolutely adorable and they treated my whole family with great respect. Our serves was absolutely delightful.  As for the food, the appetizer was soooo good. The lentil soup and salad were okay..nothing to brag about. The lamb shack and lamb rack were absolutely great. My foreign ass mother who loves complaining about everything only had good things to say about her lamb dish (that's when you know it's a good restaurant). My brother's hispanic girlfriend who is not too familiar with middle eastern food loved her chicken dish (not sure what it was). My little brother who is so picky its annoying -loved his beef kabob.

I'm not sure what their specials actually are but, what drew me in on my first visit was the 3 course dinner for $14.95. I make sure to ask for this special whenever I come for dinner and they always accommodate. I've liked everything I've had here. The hummus and pita is delicious, so is the simple salad they serve. I usually get some kind of chicken dish--I've had both the chicken with the walnut pomegranate sauce (that's definitely my fav!) but the saffron is always good.  I love that they end the meal with a ""palate cleanser"" of ice cream with honey and cinnamon. And they always give you a rose. It's the little touches here that remind me why I keep coming back.

2017-08-15,1.0,"Visiting from Kansas City, I thought I had found an authentic gem in the heart of Lincoln Park. Had I known how horrible the experience was going to be, I would not have wasted my time or money.  I have NEVER, EVER had such HORRIBLE SERVICE in all of my dining experiences! We had a Groupon that I set on the table upon us being seated. The sever noticed it as she was pouring our waters with no greeting or introduction. Several minutes pass, I'm guessing it was the owner, comes to our table to inform us that with the voucher you can only order meals up to $18 and there would be an upcharge for pricier choices. Understandable, I'm good with that. Moving on, I order our wine. I ask for Tom Gore Cabernet Sauvignon. He informs me the wine that comes with the voucher is only Beringer. I purchased the voucher for $49, it stated on  groupon.com  that the voucher was valued at $89 for a 4 course meal for 2 including wine. On the menu, a 4 course meal for 2 is offered at $79, which includes a bottle of wine up to $36 menu price-so I'm naturally thinking the voucher would cover that as it stated it was an $89 value. Tom Gore Cab was $36. But instead, we got a $24 bottle of Beringer. How does that add up to an $89 value? Disappointed in the false advertisement through Groupon. But to top it off, we had NO SERVICE. Our water glasses sat empty for nearly 25 minutes. The server completely neglected us. When our entrees arrived, I immediately asked for boxes, sealed our bottle, tipped like 5% (which I don't feel like the service rendered even that), and left a note on their paper table cloth and before leaving. The food was good, but the treatment from the owner and the lack of attentive service were extremely disappointing to say the least. It was horrible, honestly. If the owner does not want to treat groupon holders as paying customers, he should stop offering the vouchers through the website. Terrible experience!!!",-0.965,0.836,0.059,0.105,0.6208333333333333

The place is cute and a little romantic First glance at the menu i was like ooooooh this place is a bit pricey.  But with so many good reviews we went with it. We ordered the hummus as an appetizer.  There was a lot of hummus and not many thing to dip IN the hummus.  Instead of bringing us more pita, the rest of hummus went to waste. I ordered the Saffron Vegetables, it came with the Cove Salad, which was nothing special.  mainly lettuce, with a pretty good dressing.  The actual meal was pretty small for the $18 price tag.  There was about 3/4 cup veggies, 1/4 c rice and another 1/4 c of rice/lentil mix.  The food tasted ok - sort of bland, but not good enough to make up for the small portion and high price tag.

We saw online they had a good deal for dinner + app + bottle of wine. When we got there however, they said they weren't honoring that deal.... which is frustrating because then they should take it off the internet!!! They ended up giving us the same deal but for $10 more.  We got the appetizer platter and we're really pleased with everything on it. We split the two entrees and each of those were great as well. The interesting thing about the menu is that most of the entree items are very similar but have different spices with them. So I think anything we chose would have been really good.  They do have a patio outside, so I think that would be pretty enjoyable. We ate inside and it's kind of underground, but it still has a cozy feel to it.",0.9878,0.771,0.201,0.028,0.6196763085399449

Set somewhat underground, the dining area of this place is ""cozy""; we had a party of around 20 and it was hard to find consecutive seating to accommodate such a large party. That being said though, the service was on-point and the staff were nice. They were aware of my tree-nut allergy and informed us of which dish had nut ingredients or not. We went family-style and had a plate of the following, per two-people: -- Pars Sampler: consisted of hummus (delish!!), Eggplant Kashk, Bulgarian Feta, Mozzarella,Tapenade, Shirazi Salad, & Dolmeh, which is a gradeleaf stuffed with fresh herbs, Legumes and rice -- Baked Lamb Fesenjan: I didn't eat this, because there was a walnut pomegranite sauce. But seemed like others really enjoyed it -- Lamb Koubedeh: Ground & well seasoned lamb & beef, skewered & Grilled with Tomato & Onion, srved with basmati rice. This was absolutely delicious -- Chilean Seabass: never had chilean seabass, but heard it was good, and I can agree!gies -- Dill Salmon: this was pretty good too, not as good as the chilean seabass, but the mix of salmon and seasonal veggies, it was a really good combo too. Washed all this down with some reds and enjoyed good company, this place is definitely something to check out, if you're in the mood for middle eastern-type food. BATHROOM REVIEW: Located all the way in the back (easy to miss, since there's no sign besides at ""Exit"" sign) the bathroom consisted of a urinal and stall. There was a sign that said ""Flush twice"", but the urinal handled things well with just one. Overall, decently clean. I couldn't evaluate the stall, as someone was in it. Sit or squat?

2017-02-15,2.0,"My advice in summary:  Order Kabobs Lentil soup is a great side Complimentary humus and bread starter   My husband is Iranian, I know Persian food. This was just disappointing. We assumed the negative reviews from yelp users with Iranian names might might be a bit harsh, so we still gave it a shot.  Good news for non-Persians. You might still like the food, IF you don't know what the real dish is supposed to taste like. No need to order appetizer, if you are not so hungry. They bring a satisfying and complimentary humus, olive and bread plate which is pretty good. The kashk (eggplant) appetizer we ordered was just OK.  The main dish we ordered was Chicken Fesenjan. Nothing like the dish back home. It lacked quality and flavor. Some missing key ingredients and some not needed ingredients. A good example on how to butcher a dish... or how my husband put it ""they just added whatever ingredients were present in the kitchen"".  My advice on what to order. Iranians are best at cooking Kabobs, stick to those. They can't go wrong with that. Also the main entree comes with the choice of lentil soup or salad. We got the lentil soup, it was great!  The owner makes a sweet gesture at the end, they bring a red rose for female customers with the check. A bit gender biased, but I am woman ;). And this is not just for Valentine's Day.

We also had to wait an hour and a half for our food! Once the food arrived, everything tasted SO bland and oily. I ordered the sea bass, and I think I was served a total of 3 small chunks of fish- not even one full piece- which were mixed haphazardly with a few unidentifiable 'vegetables'. What's worse, my food was apparently drizzled with lemon juice (although I tasted no lemon whatsoever), and the cook left the USED lemon wedge on the middle of my plate. I didn't realize what it was, so I took a bite, and instantly regretted it. My boyfriend ordered the spicy lamb, as he is an avid lamb eater, and he said that it was the worst lamb dish he has ever had.

I'm not sure what kind of Persian food this restaurant is claiming to sell but I was very embarrassed when I took my American friends to this restaurant. It had overall very good yelp reviews but it left me very disappointed. We ordered several of their dishes and the kebab was OK, but the rice was far below average and there was a minimal amount on the plate. I also ordered a couple stews that were not what I would classify as a traditional Persian stew that I was expecting. I'm being generous here with three stars.

The owner has a heart of gold, and there's a lot character and charm. Outdoor seating, too! 5 stars for the lovely and generous service, several very delicious items, great location, and amazing value. The kind of restaurant that's close to downtown that this city still needs to still have. (I am part Persian, and a foodie, as a reference point!) A great place for a casual date, dinner with friends, or an easy family meal. So many delicious things on the menu, you just have to choose the right things for your tastes. If you are new to Persian food (and even if you're not) get the chicken kebab, and pay for an extra portion of the fluffy and delicate basmati rice, which is incredibly delicious. I have been lucky enough to have had Persian food all over the country in the world, and I can say hands-down, this is my favorite Persian chicken kebab in the Chicago area! Get it with a side of tangy cucumber mint yogurt and tasty shirazi salad (cucumber, tomato, lime juice, olive oil, mint and onions), for the perfect balance of flavors and textures.  I haven't had everything on the menu, but I can also recommend the ground lamb/beef kabob (""kofteh""), just ask if you can get it on its own. Or the saffron sauce on the side (the sauce is delicious flavor-wise, just as a first timer, you may not love the texture split yellow peas, with the other veggies, including turnip) If you are Persian and want more details on the more ""authentic"" dishes, message me!

Well, I guess at least the place was cheap. Well, it looks and tastes somewhat cheap as well. So, diners beware: you do get what you pay for.  On the other hand, the owner was extremely nice. Three of us came here with a Groupon for two and they extended the Groupon pricing to the third person. In addition, the two ladies among us left with a red rose at the end of the dinner, courtesy of the owner. Nice, but not worth the trip.",0.9705,0.816,0.156,0.028,0.4205357142857143

Normally i would have given it a one or a zero but i appreciated all the fresh flowers on each table...in fact she kept our table waiting while she was replacing day old flowers on each table with new ones. Very good touch. Also i liked dishes in which meals were served. Rest kinda claustrophobic and a bit kitch... Meal: This sure is not Iranian food and I donot think they pretend it to be Iranian. They seem to call it Mediterranean ...well, maybe to a certain extent...overall, pretty Americanized. Sampler: not good at all. I felt everything was sitting in the refrigerator for a while and nothing was tasty.  Lamb kebab. OK but not great. Lentil soup.  I liked fine. Ice cream at the end, on the house.

2015-02-16,5.0,"After stopping by Tommy Knuckles next door my friends and I decided to have dinner because of the great reviews.  At first glance it looks like a tiny shack that you just order out from, but when you walk downstairs there is a dining room. There's a small section that has a skylight and another section that is much bigger. The place is kind of dim but perfect for a romantic dinner. Any ways my friends and I sat in the larger dining room. It wasn't crowded because it was Sunday and the Bears game was just about to start.  Food: My two friends decided to share a 4 course meal which is pretty damn cool and well worth the price. They order the sampler, soup & salad, two entrees and dessert.  Sampler - Omgeeze, I don't usually eat hummus but we devoured it. My favorite was the sharazi salad. It was so fresh and light and so damn good.  The tampenad and everything else on the plate was  amazing. Seriously, i've never had such a light appetizer that was so delicious and new!  Soup & Salad- We had two people try the soup and let me say it was just as amazing as the wonderful reviews. Tip!! Please try the lentil soup!  I've never had lentil soup before and Now I want to learn how to make it. The salad had a unique dressing. I'm not sure what it was was but I want to just buy the dressing. I would make salad more often if I had their dressing.  Entree 1 Okay I don't remember the name of the dish but it was chicken. The menu on their website is not current, As it does not list the sauces. So the way you kind of order it you pick a meat and you can choose what sauce you want on it, but there are options that have entrees all set. I believe we got the Chicken Mediterranean with the first sauce of the 4/5 different sauces. It's a dark purple sauce that is sweet. I think it's too sweet for me but it was very delicious. It went well with the chicken. It wasn't a bbq sauce fyi.  Entree 2 We got the chilean sea bass with the last sauce which has a jalapeno kick to it. I think for the average person that does not like spicy food will think this is too hot. Personally, I enjoyed it and wanted to be more spicy. Anyways this sauce paired with the fish was amazing. I loved it. The fish wasn't overcooked and it was light and flaky.  All 3 of us enjoyed this one the most. Entree 3 I decided to be the courageous one and try the lamb. I've had lamb before because my neighbor is bosnian and I love it. Obviously people cook lamb differently all the time and I wanted to try it out.  For the sauce I chose that last jalapeno sauce as well. Let me just say, lamb is not a taste for everyone. It was good. It wasn't amazing as the other two, but I really did enjoy trying something new. I think If I had it with another sauce it would've been better, but I'm really into spicy stuff and i wanted to try.  I'm pretty sure when I go back i'm going to order the lamb again but try it in another sauce.  Dessert-  Man the order was so sweet. My meal did not come with dessert but she sent one out to us anyways. I'm pretty sure she was the owner.  We actually had two people take care of us because it was slow, but they were both sweet. They came around often and made sure everything was okay.",0.9995,0.727,0.243,0.03,0.609822248458612

The owner here is one of the sweetest men and made our experience so magical.  When we arrived, the restaurant wasn't open yet, but the owner was sweet enough to let us come in and take our seats early. It was the perfect setting, because we were looking for a restaurant that was quiet and intimate. This place fit the bill, as it's serene and subterranean but still has sky windows letting in a little warm light.  We weren't sure of what we wanted to order, so we told him to bring us his favorites.  So they started us with two glasses of red wine and the appetizer sampler comprised of hummus, baba ghanoush, cucumber salad, tapenade, and potato salad. All very tasty. We also got the house salad which was simple but good. I really enjoyed my main dish, which was the chicken with walnut pomegranate sauce. The sauce almost tasted like a mole, but it is actually a condensed liquid of cooked down walnut and pomegranates- and that's all that they put in it! Delish. My boyfriend said his entre, the lamb and chicken kebabs, left a little to be desired.  He also was a little annoyed that the menu was somewhat difficult to understand. Wasn't too big of a deal to me though.   The kicker for me was the two red roses and free desert that we unexpectedly received at the end of the meal. The owner did a great job of making us feel catered to and like it was a special night on the town. Oh, and the prices are extremely reasonable.",0.9951,0.785,0.19,0.025,0.5522486772486774

""I was really excited about this place because the reviews were so fantastic! Sadly, I left this meal pretty unsatisfied and underwhelmed. Pars Cove is a very intimate and cozy restaurant - great ambiance for a romantic date or a low key night out with friends. My family and I were searching for a place to have a birthday dinner and we decided to try this place with a Groupon and the high reviews on Yelp. We came and were seated immediately in their front room section. The groupon gave us a great selection of food,- a pitcher of alcoholic drink, an appetizer sampler, 2 soups or salad, 2 entrees, and 2 desserts. It was a really great Groupon deal for all the food it gives you. We picked the Sangria which wasn't the best and also wasn't the worst - it was a red wine base which I wished had more fruit juice to help counteract the bitterness of the wine. The appetizer sampler came with a delicious hummus, fresh baked bread, tapenade, mixed cucumber and tomato salad with feta, potato salad, stuffed grape leave, and one other thing I couldn't identify but tasted of curry. This sampler was pretty delicious and the hummus was probably the highlight of my entire meal. Afterwards we both had the lentil soup which was good and standard. For entrees we each had various combinations of the kabobs. The dishes lacked salt and flavor. The beef barg was cooked incredibly well - a perfect medium rare (which they didn't ask us how they liked our beef cooked) and when it came out, it looked like it had a lot of seasoning. Upon first bite, we tasted tender beef but really nothing else. The lamb shank was very tender and fell apart but again, lacked anything to enhance the lamb flavor. I chose a tomato and garlic sauce to go on top and even that was a pretty mild flavor :( I've never salted a restaurant dish so much in my life. Both dishes came with lentil mixed with rice which was cooked well. The meal was topped off with a serving of ice cream with some fruit topping and honey. This was pretty delicious and probably was my second favorite course next to the hummus. At the end of the meal, they do give every lady a rose which is a really nice touch. This is the first restaurant that I've ever seen do that and for that, I give the owner kudos for making the guests feel special :) For food though, I think not.""",0.9989,0.724,0.234,0.042,0.6161163153786104

2014-06-01,2.0,"I was really excited to go to Pars Cove with my boyfriend and being an avid groupon collector I thought it was going to be a great time.  It started out poorly when I was trying to make reservation for 2 at 6pm on a Saturday night. Whoever was on the phone earlier that week really wanted me to take a 5pm spot and was really rude when I said we needed a 6pm or later. He let me have the 6pm spot and I was really excited. When we arrived to Pars Cove there were about two other tables filled and we were seated right away. I told our waitress that we had the groupon deal and she explained what it entailed. My boyfriend and I immediately felt as though she was trying to rush us into ordering the wine and food and this continued between every course we ate.  Although it was not in the deal, I tried to order the grouper or the scallops and they did not have either, which I was bummed about. My boyfriend and I got the chicken and shrimp as our main course and it was just ok. We were barely done with our soup when the waitress brought over the main course and she did the same thing for the dessert. The dessert of vanilla ice cream with honey was probably the best thing that we ate.  On a plus side, the owner did come over and check on us which was really a nice touch.  I usually do not get upset or even think to write yelp reviews, but we were both very disappointed with the food and the way we were rushed when there was hardly anyone in the restaurant.  I hope that others have a better dining experience than we did!",0.9176,0.899,0.079,0.022,0.5362103174603176
2014-05-26,5.0,"I have had an incredibly stressful year. I was on the verge of tears from frustration, stress and anxiety and then my friend and I decided to get Persian food. I suggested Pars Cove, since it was a Persian restaurant i hadn't been to and looked cute enough when I passed by it.  We had the best lady-friend date I have ever had. When I walked in, I was really amused by how cute the restaurant was. I really liked the ambience. I was excited to see my friend and talk about crap, and the waitress came by a few times asking if we were ready to order. The menu was limited, but we ended up just getting two entrees even though they had some sort of special. Basically two entrees, desserts, an appetizer and a pitcher of Sangria for $60 or something super cheap. I ordered the Beef Sultani and my friend got the vegetarian plate with fesenjan sauce. A server dropped off an appetizer sampler plate, and said that it was on the house. I was shocked! I also felt bad, because I'm a horrible Persian. I don't like most of the traditional Persian meals/foods/etc. However, since it was free, I felt obligated to at least dip some bread into the options. It was a nice serving of hummus, Salad Shirazi with some feta crumbles, Salad Olivieh (potato salad), Tapenade (some olive thing), and something with eggplants and grape leaves. The bread was very good and I was surprised how much I liked the grape leaves dish.  I got a plain salad, and my friend got the lentil soup. Those were fine. Our main entrees were good. My sultani wasn't exactly to my liking, it tasted more like generic middle eastern kabob than the Persian seasoning that I'm accustomed to. I believe the kabob already had a nice dosing of sumac, and our table didn't have any sumac, salt or pepper on the table. It would've been nice, but definitely not necessary. The rice was less than I expected as well... only because most Persian restaurants give you about half a plate of rice. I'm sure if I asked for more rice, I would've gotten some. It was nice that they gave like a scoop of white Persian rice and a scoop of Baghali rice (dill rice with lima beans), and both were very good. I asked for some parsley, and the got a few sprigs as well as a little cup of mush-e khiar (cucumber yogurt). It was all really good and almost too much.  After our meal, we got free dessert! It was a scoop of vanilla ice cream, with honey and I think sour cherry preserves on top with a little zulbia on top. So much food already, I ate as much as I could but I was stuffed. When our bill came, it was only $30 some dollars and we got free red roses. We made sure to tip as if we were charged for each dish we received for free and the service was so good, it was well deserved. They rewarded our 'generous' tip with free cups of tea.  I'm surprised to see that some people have different experience than us, but overall I cannot wait to go back to this location. The service was extraordinarily better than any Persian restaurant I've ever gone to. Most of the other Chicago Persian restaurants have great food, but their service is just meh. Also, the rose is definitely a nice touch and makes me feel appreciated as a customer.",0.999,0.716,0.232,0.052,0.5649237677527152

2014-05-03,5.0,"I found a groupon deal for this place a few times but was never able to get it in time and my girlfriend was wanting to check it out. Pars Cove appeared on Chicago's Best, but the owner came off as too serious. When I finally snagged a deal and went to this place today, I was excited to try the food and celebrate my girlfriend birthday early. We arrived around 2:30 so there was barely anyone there. Nobody was at the front to attend people at the door, but that was fine as a quick ""hello"" got us somebody to greet us and seat us promptly. The place was dimly lit minus the front seating area under a skylight which was complimented by the beautiful afternoon sun we had. The tables were lined with paper topped with a candle and a flower vase. With only one other table occupied by a couple, the environment was quiet and very intimate.       The owner is very friendly with a gentle demeanor. Right away I felt right at home. I told him about the Groupon deal for a four course meal for two and he got started on explaining it to us. We started with a appetizer sampler that included hummus, baked eggplant, crushed olives, potato salad, and dolmeh (grape leaves stuffed with spiced rice). This was accompanied by warm flatbread drizzled with olive oil. We also had a choice of wine or sangria. We went for a pitcher of the latter.  Then came the soup (you have a choice between soup or salad). The lentil soup we got was the best! Very flavorful with a faint heat at the end.      Finally, the time had come for our entrees. My girlfriend had the chilean seabass with walnut pomegranate sauce. The seabass was very tender to the point that it fell apart when the fork made contact. The thick sauce wasn't too sweet and had the delicious nutty flavor of the walnut without standing out too much.  My chicken soltani was a safe choice, I'll admit. It was pretty much a combination of chicken jujeh marinated in a lemon, oil,  and saffron and the koubedeh which is chopped chicken mixed with herbs and spices served with roasted tomato and onion. It was served hot and oh so juicy. I kept wishing I could cook like this at home.  These were served with saffron rice.     At the end of our meal, each of us received a small dish of homemade ice cream topped with fig, honey, and a piece of strawberry sprinkled with cinnamon. I intend to use that combination in my ice cream in the future. This was capped off with a rose handed to me to present to my love. I was so happy with everything. The service was prompt and friendly, the atmosphere was romantic, and the food was amazing. I will be sure to return to this location without a Groupon deal because these people deserve all my money.",0.9983,0.81,0.174,0.015,0.5738063492063492

We get there and the owner (a very nice man) comes and tells us that the server will get us 2 samplers of any drinks that we would like to try. 20 mins later (after my friend went into the restaurant to call the waitress) she walks out and looks blank when we tell her about the sampler drinks. She confuses us, we confuse her and then we give up and order 2 pitchers of sangria and lemonade+vodka. Terrible!! Dilute red wine = Pars Cove's sangria and Your 7 yr old's lemonade= Pars Cove's Lemonade+Vodka (no taste of any alcohol). The appetizer plate was the only thing that came out soon and was great.

I forgot the water. I'll be right back ok?'..and she turns back without asking if we need anything else....tick tick tick... water arrives (best drink in the restaurant) and we order salad...tick tick tick tick..salad arrives and we're disappointed with it.

By this time we're just tired of the bad service and our appetite has died. Out of 4 of us, 3 are vegetarian and none of the veggie entrees were great. It's rice and with lots of veggies in a thick sauce. There isn't enuf sauce for all the rice and these sauces have weird flavors. I can't point out any one ingredient, but they just tasted a lil weird in the mouth. Ah well, maybe that's coz I've never had Persian food before. All in all quite a bad experience and this will surly be my last visit here.

There were no tables, so the owner told us to wait at the bar. He gave us a glass of wine to share (I was with one other person) which was amazing!  We were seated shortly. It took the waitress 10 min. to acknowledge us, and when she did, she made no eye contact, no smile and said ""what can I get you"". As we were briefly making a final decision, she said ""I'll be right back"".... This was unacceptable, as she merely just left and we were ready to order. It took her another 10 min to come back. We placed our order. 5 min. later, a busser came and asked us if we had ordered an appetizer. We said it wasn't ours. The same busser came back 2 min. later and asked, and again, we said we did not order one. He came back 1 min. later and put it in the middle of our table. We were confused, but said ""thank you"".  Our food came to us shortly after. The food was to die for! Very flavorful and unique!! VERY VERY GOOD!!  Our waters were never refilled and I was dying of thirst. When we were done, we had to wait 15 min. before the server came. I was PRAYING she came with the check, as we were ready to move on, but she set down dessert which was persian style ice cream. We were thankful, but again confused as we did not order it.  We REALLY wanted to leave, and had to wait another 15 min. and she never came. I had to go up to walk around and find her and I asked her for our check. She said ""sure"".  She came back and our bill was $40, which seemed right since our meals were $17/piece.

When I put the coupon and my credit card in there, she had charged my card $36, meaning she took off a whopping $4!!!! This was very upsetting.

2014-02-03,4.0,"Need a cozy place for date night that will not break the bank? Give these guys a shot. My wife and I rocked a Groupon for date night on a cold, snowy February night and down into the bowels of Pars Cove we go.  I recommend sitting in the back, nice and toasty back there thanks to the space heater,  and dark too.  Parking can be tricky due to the area so if you drive allow time for that.  Kudos to the ladies on dates that night because all were dolled up well including my girl ;) The food is Persian and comes in multiple courses - here's the Groupon breakdown $49 for a four-course dinner for two (up to a $104 total value) Each dinner includes the following per two diners: One maze platter with hummus, dolmeh, tapenade, baked eggplant kashk, fresh mozzarella olivieh, shirazi salad, and feta (a $16 value) Two soups or salads (up to a $10 value) Two entrees (up to a $36 total value) Two servings of ice cream (an $8 value) A bottle of wine, pitcher of vodka lemonade, sangria, martini, or bottle of San Pellegrino or Badoit water (up to a $34 value) As for the food, it was all good, no slouchers. The only thing that was average was my lentil soup, other than that the food was good.  For drink my wife opted for the sangria, we noticed the other tables did as well. She thought it was a bit tart or dry and would probably go with the bottle of wine next time. Due to the Groupon the bill was just tax (very small amount) so cash was preferred over credit.  A nice touch by the owners, a single rose for the lady at the end of dinner.  Atmosphere was warm, cozy, low lighting, and romantic, very conducive for date night and that was definitely the crowd that was in there this night.  Service overall was good. A few things noted -  Our first table choice against the wall was for four (we were a party of two) and our server asked if we would sit at a two person table instead because other customers were coming. Our dinner reservation was at 8pm and the place was pretty empty so I had my doubts, but I gave her the benefit of the doubt. Of course no one ever came and sat at that table. The second table was too wobbly so we moved to a third.  Due to all the table moves, we did not end up with a lit candle, so I had to steal one from another table.  Our server, young gal, did not have much of a personality, but that could also have been lost in translation (language/culture). I was drinking water and could have benefitted from more frequent refill visits. I appreciate the quick peek to check on me and not disturb our quality time but keeping my water glass full is appreciated too.

It was very good and came with rice and lentil.  The service however was just ok. There were times at the beginning of the meal where water glasses remained empty and plates were not brought out for our dinners that were being shared. The also really kept pushing the specials and objected to splitting the check or using credit cards which I can see given that it is a small local business. However the owner did come out to speak with us and even gave our party 2 free bottles of wine to share along with dessert which was a very nice gesture. Overall a great place for a intimate dinner with friends or significant others.",0.9921,0.755,0.236,0.009,0.5620588235294117
2014-01-23,3.0,"My husband and I planned a date night and I found a Groupon for Pars Cove, so we decided to check it out.  The restaurant is at garden level.  It was a nice place, and since it was freezing outside, the  blast of warm air as we walked in was wonderful.  We were seated immediately, and the waitstaff was quite attentive.  When the menu arrived, I notice that the restaurant has a general special that is the same price as the Groupon I purchased.  I have to say, I felt cheated.  I asked the wait staff about this, and they indicated that they were running this special in tandem with the Groupon.  Hmmm... The food was good, but not great.  Especially for the price and quantity.  We decided to be adventurous and order the Dal, a yogurt drink with mint.  Interesting but I would not order it again.  I we ordered the beef and lamb kabobs.  They were good.  Not too salty.  The best part of the meal was the dessert, the ice cream.  Sometime in the middle of dinner it felt like the heat turned off, and we were freezing almost until we left.

2014-01-16,2.0,"I was really excited about this place because the reviews were so fantastic! Sadly, I left this meal pretty unsatisfied and underwhelmed. Pars Cove is a very intimate and cozy restaurant - great ambiance for a romantic date or a low key night out with friends. My friend and I were searching for a place to have dinner Saturday night and we decided to try this place with a Groupon and the high reviews on Yelp. We came and were seated immediately in their front room section. The groupon gave us a great selection of food,- a pitcher of alcoholic drink, an appetizer sampler, 2 soups or salad, 2 entrees, and 2 desserts. It was a really great Groupon deal for all the food it gives you. We picked the Sangria which wasn't the best and also wasn't the worst - it was a red wine base which I wished had more fruit juice to help counteract the bitterness of the wine. The appetizer sampler came with a delicious hummus, fresh baked bread, tapenade, mixed cucumber and tomato salad with feta, potato salad, stuffed grape leave, and one other thing I couldn't identify but tasted of curry. This sampler was pretty delicious and the hummus was probably the highlight of my entire meal. Afterwards we both had the lentil soup which was good and standard. For entree's we chose the beef barg and lamb shank. Both dishes lacked salt and flavor. The beef barg was cooked incredibly well - a perfect medium rare (which they didn't ask us how they liked our beef cooked) and when it came out, it looked like it had a lot of seasoning. Upon first bite, we tasted tender beef but really nothing else. The lamb shank was very tender and fell apart but again, lacked anything to enhance the lamb flavor. I chose a tomato and garlic sauce to go on top and even that was a pretty mild flavor :( I've never salted a restaurant dish so much in my life. Both dishes came with lentil mixed with rice which was cooked well. The meal was topped off with a serving of ice cream with some fruit topping and honey. This was pretty delicious and probably was my second favorite course next to the hummus. At the end of the meal, they do give every lady a rose which is a really nice touch. This is the first restaurant that I've ever seen do that and for that, I give the owner kudos for making the guests feel special :) For food though, I think not.",0.998,0.761,0.209,0.03,0.6305508870214752

The lentil soup and house salad also were unique in their spices. I had the chicken kefta with one of the sauces you get to choose from and my wife had chicken and shrimp kabob. Even though these were standard dishes you would find in any Mediterranean restaurant - the spices they used made them especially delicious and unique.

2013-12-15,5.0,"Woohoo!  I'm a fan!  :)  Went here last week for the first time.  Also realized they had a groupon before I went in, but when I called to make a reservation, which the owner Max said wasn't necessary, he told me to just come in and he'd give me the deal on the spot.  He was true to his word, and greeted me with a handshake when I arrived a short time later. Max let us choose our table and since he knew we wanted the special, he recapped what it entailed, got our beverage choice out of us, and then immediately went to the kitchen to get the drinks and appetizer sampler going.  No wasted time at all. Their normal ""special"" is a $55 dinner for two which includes an appetizer sampler, a soup or salad for each person, an entree for each person, a small but delicious ice cream honey dessert for each person, AND a bottle of wine, pitcher of sangria, pitcher of margarita, or pitcher of vodka lemonade.  That's a damn crazy deal.  Plenty of food, all of which is delish!  Would be a good deal without the alcohol, but throwing that on top brings the whole meal together and makes you totally love this place. Throw in the tag teaming staff that are collectively handling all of the customers in the quaint establishment - and we're in good shape.  Oh, the owner Max is also helping seat and serve, so he's clearly making sure things are running well. The groupon is for this normal special, but knocks off $6 and brings it down to $49.  Mention it before arriving and they'll probably hook you up regardless.  Even at the regular non-coupon price of $55, this special is solid and will keep me coming back. When the bill came the waitress said it was $53ish or something like that, but if we paid cash, they'd give a 6% discount and bring it down to $50 even.  Heck yes I'm in.

The hummus was really creamy and buttery, stuffed grape leaves, a chunky olive tapenade, baked eggplants, a bulgarian wheat salad, some feta and olive. It's always fun to be able to try different stuff with someone.  I had a soup while my friend got the salad. For entrees, I had the lamb shank with the ariabata sauce. The lamb shank came out very tender and flavorful. I love how accommodating they are in that they give you 6 different sauce to choose from to custom made your own entree. My friend got a koubedeh which he loved. As if this is not enough, we got a very nice dessert. Ice cream with a fruit syrup and crunchy cookie toppings.  I mean I don't really have much complains, the wait for food is slihtly long but it's well worth it. After dinner, they give you a coupon for the same deal for you to come back next time.

With the deal, we were able to get a pitcher of sangria, an appetizer sampler plate, salads, entrees, and dessert! The sangria was good and refreshing on a summer day while sitting outside- not much fruit in it, but that means more of the pitcher is filled with wine! The pita that came out with the appetizer sampler was piping hot! We did wish we had more pita, but that was only because there were so many dips on the appetizer plate and we wanted to finish them all! The hummus was especially delicious. Our salads were mixed greens and red cabbage with a tasty dressing and we cleaned those plates too. For our entrees, we chose kabobs, my friend had the lamb and beef and I opted for the lamb and chicken. My chicken was a tenderloin and well seasoned so it was the most flavorful and moist chicken I've had in a while. The lamb was also beautifully seasoned and perfectly cooked. The dipping sauce that comes with it had a minty-esque flavor to it and it was a perfect accompaniment to the meat. We also enjoyed the rice and salad sides.

The waitress recommended the tip amount and actually wrote it on the bill and the credit card receipt herself. The tip amount she recommended was 23% of the tap, higher than what's expected at the most highly ranked restaurants. 18-20% is the norm and recommending the guest to give 23% is a bit much.

2013-05-20,4.0,"Watch the negative reviews about this place, most people appear to be complaining about the portions and a ""bait & switch"" regarding the specials. A) The portions are more than enough. I went with three other people and we all ended up taking to-go containers. B) They do have specials on the menu, but with the Groupon you're still paying less. I'm assuming people want the gratification of knowing they got an exclusive deal, as opposed to the special essentially being a staple of pretty much everyone who attends. Either way, these complaints may be unwarranted unless your expectation is to eat an ungodly amount of food upon arrival. Waiter was okay, but honestly I didn't care much. He kept the food coming and the table clean.  Food is surprisingly good. I got the aforementioned special for four and we were all nearly full after appetizers and soup/salad. Oh, not to mention, they brought out two bottles of wine. Entrees are surprisingly good and everyone commented on how much they enjoyed the food. Ice cream was delicious, though hard to put down after all that food. Only negative was the location of our table, which was directly in line with a noisy air conditioner that would systematically turn on and off throughout the evening. It was blowing cold air directly onto our table, meanwhile the temp outside was around 60 degrees. Not sure if they are able to control the temp from inside, but this was mildly unsettling. Still, a minor complaint. FYI, be ready to pay a premium for tip/tax @ the end of the meal, particularly if you go w/ four people.  I was trying to impress the people I brought here and took a leap of faith based on yelp reviews. Everyone loved it and two people in the party even said they might come back that same week.

2013-05-12,2.0,"My husband and I went on the Groupon deal, because it seemed like a good amount of food for a decent price (49.00).  Be warned right away about the Groupon:  This is the *exact* same deal that appears to be a permanent ""special"" listed on their menu.  So the Groupon is a little deceptive then, in terms of any real savings. Like someone mentioned, we were seated and asked immediately for our Groupon, which was then checked by the waiter.  Not totally inviting, in terms of hospitality, agreed.  Also, the back rooms, which appear to have private/quieter tables, were *entirely* empty, yet the staff seemed to want to seat EVERYONE in the little 'light-filled' room that someone mentioned.  It was just cramped beyond belief, because there isn't much room between tables. I really hate having dinner when I can hear every single person's conversation, in addition to my own. Wine: Agree with what someone said.  Very vague in terms of the menu's wine selection or what exactly ""upgrade to a 'better' bottle"" means.  Don't waste your time with an upgrade.  But in other ways: The wine is the saving grace, given that you get a bottle.  Even a cheap wine runs 20-30. (If the wine didn't come with the meal, this really would have been closer to 1.5 stars.) I will say the appetizer plate was quite good.  From there, though, it went downhill for us.  Really what irked me was that I paid the extra money for one of their most expensive dinner items (the sea scallops) and when I got it the ""main course"" consisted of about 10 tiny-tiny bay scallops covered with sauce (not even cooked in it), along with a 1/2 cup of rice.  24.00 for that.  I know bay scallops are more tender, but when you hear ""entree"", you generally don't expect a few bite-size morsels and pretty much nothing else.  (I'm not a person who wants or needs HUGE portions, either, but this was ridiculous.  I was finished in about 5 minutes and left hungry.  The appetizer had more food/more filling food, for less!)  The balance and scale just felt entirely off.  My husband had the lamb and it was better tasting, though very saturated with sauce. Also a small serving, though not as small as the scallops. I'd definitely go for meat over seafood, if the scallops are an indication of anything--at least a tiny portion of meat is generally more filling.   The ice cream was fine.   Bill came out and we still owed 6.00, plus tax, plus 12.00 that they tried to add for tip.  So an automatic 20 percent tip, for bad service and an 'eh' dining experience?  (PS: Though we're generally 'cool' Groupon customers who tip on the entire ""value"", we're *not* paying the extra tip for a Groupon ""savings"" on a supposed 108.00 meal, when the menu price is 49.00, too!  Don't be taken by leaving tip on 108.00 bucks!) All in all: I doubt we'll go back, even on a ""special"".  Hubby wasn't happy overall, either.  Bummer!   We really wanted to like this place, because I'd love to add a Persian restaurant to our ""Chicago favs"", but...it just wasn't an enjoyable dining experience between the server, the cramped, sun-drenched room, and most importantly, the food itself.  :(  Sorry, Pars Cove.",0.9173,0.857,0.084,0.058,0.47271062271062264

The Chilean Sea Bass here rivals any of the fine dining establishments- it's so light, flaky and buttery it's decadent but so light and delicious.

Their menu is fantastic, the prices are more than reasonable, the value is excellent even without the groupon. The menu has a few sections to it-- the appetizers (try the cold sampler, which came with our groupon... there isn't a bad thing on the plate and the hummus is especially memorable!), the kebobs, the meat & sauce mix-and-match section, and the seafood.  We all ordered our entrees from the mix-and-match. I got the vegetarian fesenjan and it was phenomenal.  I've had homemade fesenjan/fesenjoon made by some Persian friends before, and this was easily as good (sorry, Obie-- you'll just have to try this sometime!)  At least you know it's authentic! Every entree also comes with vanilla ice cream and usually a honey drizzle, although ours had some mini-baklava and cherries on them, which was the perfect finish to the night.  And as if that weren't enough, my mom and I both got roses from the presumed owner of the establishment.  He came over and explained his handwritten bill to my dad, which included tip but charged for the least expensive entree (since we bought an extra one beyond what was included in the groupon) but ended with ""you pay what you want to"" So nice! The one thing that wasn't authentic was our Eastern European (?) server who admonished us for ordering the fesenjan sauce, warning us that it was sweet (it's not, it's more tart/tangy)... This is clearly their specialty, why would they have waitstaff cautioning guests against their specialty??  He was also really unfriendly and seemed really unhappy to be serving us. Our busboy though was fantastic, laughing and joking with us, giving us hints on what we would like and bonding over mutual vegetarian trials.  He should get a promotion for sure-- or at least a raise!",0.9857,0.799,0.149,0.051,0.6104517704517702

Now the amount of rice they put with your entree is probably less the 2 oz..common really are you being so cheap on rise....with tiny slice of roasted pepper and slice of tomato...NO CREATIVITY, NO PRESENTATION and did not look appetizing at all. Service took forever from ordering, to getting food to paying (about 12 min wait to get a check with empty plates on the table). For desert we got some Ice Cream with stale piece of muffin...very weird ...did not taste good at all. Waiter said he will bring us coffee and asked if we want cream or sugar but 20 min later did not bring anything, so we gave up on that.

2013-02-23,2.0,"Not sure I really understand the hype for this place, especially as there is better Persian food in Chicago (albeit not as close as Lincoln Park). I purchased the LivingSocial deal for $49, includes dinner for two, an appetizer platter, soup/salad, a bottle of wine and dessert; this was supposedly an $85 value. Once at the restaurant, you can see that it's actually available for $60. Still savings, but not as great.  I had originally called ahead for a reservation, and was given one; but once we arrived at the reservation, the owner/host had no idea about it and we still had to wait for about 20 minutes. As soon as we sat down, he first asked if we were there on a voucher, so I handed him our coupon and we got started. We started with the appetizer platter, which at its regular price of $16 is a complete rip off. It's all very mediocre except for the hummus, which is good. In addition, we asked him to leave the cheese on the side, as I have a dairy allergy; to this he simply mumbled and walked off. Low and behold, still cheese.  Next, we both got the lentil soup; we were pretty confident it came out of a can. Enough said. We ordered Barg for our entrees, one skewer of beef tenderloin and one of lamb koubideh (Ground, seasoned lamb). He didn't ask how we wanted the beef cooked, which was suspicious. Once the food came out, the lamb koubideh was very good, tender and tasty. The beef tenderloin was a struggle to finish, it was dry and chewy, despite coming out medium rare. My next gripe with the entree was the rice. Normally at a Persian restaurant, you get a huge plate full of rice; here it was hardly a cup, not enough for my meal at all.  Lastly was dessert, I assumed we would have choice of dessert based on the LivingSocial deal description, but it was just ice cream. My girlfriend told me it was sub-par.  Perhaps the worst part of the experience was when the owner came for the bill. He once again asked if we had a promotion, after already taking our coupon. Fortunately, I was able to access it on my phone. He then comes out with a very shady bill and tells us we owe $6 for tax and $12 for a tip. I'm not sure how he came up with either of these numbers but at this point I was ready to leave. We didn't have enough cash for the tab so I had to pay with my card. Turns out they only charged $6, needless to say they did not earn a $12 tip and were not tipped so. If you want real Persian food, skip this sub-par establishment and go to Noon-O-Kabab.",0.536,0.87,0.066,0.063,0.581080815018315
2013-02-19,1.0,"I give them credit for creativity in how they get people in the door. The credit stops there. As most reviewers mentioned, we were drawn to Pars Cove from a Living Social offer that my parents had purchased for us (they are not from Chicago). The voucher was $49 and included an appetizer sample, soup or salad, two entrees, two dessert, and a bottle of wine. The deal is supposed to be worth up to $104. Almost immediately after being seated, the waiter came up to us and asked if we were here on a promotion. Since we were he asked for the voucher number right away and disappeared with my phone for a while to write down the number.  It was a very transactional welcome and pretty much set the tone for the rest of the meal. Looking at the menu we noticed that the very same ""daily deal"" that had brought us here was also featured on the regular menu.  This seems like a bait and switch in my opinion, but I can see why the restaurant does this. Anyway, without us asking, the server brings our appetizer platter (worth $16) and asks if we want any wine. Keep in mind, there aren't prices for the wine bottles on the menu itself so you're left with vague descriptions of what to order. We opt for the Malbec and the server comes back with two bottles of wine, the 2nd of which we can upgrade to for $5 more. He tells us the 2nd bottle is ""better"" and it also happens to be bigger than the 1st. Of course we upgrade, why wouldn't we? I'm sure this makes the server smile every time because the 2nd wine was clearly not a ""better"" wine by any standards and came to our table already open. As for the food, I will say that the appetizer sample and lentil soup were decent. The soup/salad option came with each entree so I will complain again that the ""deal"" is a little misleading. For our entrees, I ordered the chicken ($16) and my man ordered the lamb ($19). In my words: ""Did this chicken come out of a frozen Tyson bag?"". In his words: ""This is gamy and gross"".  Yes, we received the ice cream and rose at the end of our meal and this would have been a nice touch had we not felt so taken advantage of by the ""deal"" we thought we were getting.  Since we visited, I searched for their menu online and found that they've greatly increased their prices. The appetizer platter that is $16 on the dinner menu is $8 on their website and my chicken entree is priced at $14 and the lamb at $15.  I can guarantee you we will never go back and I'd warn anybody from thinking this is a good deal. Maybe I'm a cynic, but I'd rather take the $50 and pick up a great inexpensive bottle of wine and head to a BYO where I don't feel like I'm eating last night's leftovers.",0.9848,0.868,0.098,0.034,0.4193055164209009

(incredibly romantic, huh?).  I picked it up and half the petals fell off.   Apparently there's a discount if you pay cash, something less than 10%, I didn't do the math to figure it out.  Considering all the pushing of the specials you'd think they'd be all discounted out, you'd be wrong.    So, in summation....mostly decent food (more of it than you order), distracted servers, odd decor, discounts galore, and sad roses.  Will I go back?  Doubtful.",0.9269,0.797,0.12,0.083,0.5119387755102041

I'm not too picky about food, but my wife definitely is. If she says that this is the best Persian Restaurant in Chicago, then it has to be. - We have been here multiple times, and the food has always been excellent. The food portions are just right, and the taste/quality are awesome. For example, the Gourmeh Sabzi (a traditional Persian cuisine) is on par with what I have had in Iran. The kabobs are all tasty too, especially the chicken kabob. You really can't go wrong on any of them. - I noticed that one person was complaining about the portions, and the fact that he just got one small scoop of rice. You can always ask for more, and the servers will be more than happy to bring you some more at no extra charge. That's what I've done myself on numerous occasions. This brings me to my next point, which is hospitality... - Persians are known for their hospitality, and this restaurant is a great example of it. They will do their best to make you feel welcome and to make sure that you are enjoying the food, experience, atmosphere, etc. They always bring out the appetizer sampler for us on the house, and they have even brought us bottles of wine on the house too (even when we didn't ask for it!). The honey-cinnamon ice cream and the rose that they bring you at the end is another example of their hospitality. It may not cost much to bring a rose, but the gesture is the important thing. Other Persian restaurants do not even attempt to provide such hospitality. - The atmosphere is also cozy and romantic. it's a great place for lunch and/or dinner (although I don't think they're open for lunch on weekdays). We just get a great vibe and feel whenever we have food here.  All in all, I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone in Chicago.",0.9977,0.796,0.191,0.013,0.6092482363315698

He also gave me a glass of wine on the house when I arrived and was waiting for my dinner partner. This is a business that truly cares about the dining experience their customers have.

2012-10-14,4.0,"This was a great Groupon find--it probably ranks in the top 5 or so. The Groupon was for a four course meal + wine. Everything was excellent.  Most important, Pars Cove has the best eggplant kashk I've found in Chicago.  With the exception of the potato salad, all of the appetizers were good. Unlike a lot of restaurants, the hummus was actually quite good and homemade, and the kashk was excellent. The lentil soup was also quite nice. For dinner we had the lamb. It was fall-apart-in-your-mouth good with excellent spices. Good lamb is hard to find! Dessert was vanilla ice cream with berries, also very good (and clearly homemade).  Another review mentions that their wine was opened before it came to the table. Ours was, but it clearly was not a case of them swapping out what we ordered for another wine. We ordered a malbec and got it (it was actually quite nice for a standard table wine).  Overall, excellent food for an excellent price.

2012-09-13,1.0,"Oh dear Pars Cove! We will never ever never come back there! First of all, are you kidding me people? 104 reviews out of 189 are bragging about the ROSE at the end!! Really? That's all it takes? I wanted to give this place another star because of the rose too but after seeing this it's only fair if I don't! Anyway, back to business! I am from Iran, but I love any food as long as it's delicious. I never heard about this place from my Iranian friends (unlike Noon o Kabab, Reza, Masouleh etc. that everyone knows about!) till I came across the Google offer and I thought wow that's great and it's the best Persian food according to yelp so let's try it! These are the pros and cons: Good stuff: Well the location is my favorite place in town, the lentil soup was absolutely delicious, and emm oh the ""ROSE""! Bad stuff, worst to best: 1- This is a restaurant that had health issues before and made people sick at the taste of Chicago ( foodpoisoning.pritzkerla… ), and I don't think they give a damn about it! We went to sit inside where we were welcomed by this terrible smell of rotten meat!! and we couldn't tolerate it so we came back outside and it wasn't only us all the next 4 couples did the same thing! I though well maybe something smells in the trash and they just open and are getting rid of it and blah blah (benefit of doubt or stupidity whatever you wanna call it) so we sat outside to eat. 2- For our entrees, We ordered the Sultani and lamb ""RACK"" chicken combos and then we found out the source of the smell, it was right in front of us, the beef!! grilled, tasteless, full of odor. and with a touch of sumac! I want to puke even typing about it! And then the ""RACK"" was only one piece, again tasteless and with no seasoning! For the love of God at least don't call it Persian food. Even Reza does a way better job than you guys not to mention the best in Chicago Noon o Kabab (I know they have some service issues but at least the food is the best FOR Chicgao). The rice was terrible, uncooked, small cheap rice which was just an insult to Persian rice but on the bright side it wasn't that much! The only nice thing was the chicken which was okay, and instead of saffron marinade it had turmeric but it was a delight among all the rest!  3- The deal had a wine bottle up to $48, but there wasn't any wine list only 4 kinds of red wine and some white wine, we ordered the Malbec and after some time we got our lovely bottle OPENED!!! Really? That's how you serve wine bottles? I am sure it was not Malbec, it was an okay wine and I needed the alcohol to kill the meat bacteria probably but you cannot just bring a bottle of wine opened along with a cork screw that its shape says ""Hey, this is not my first time hanging here! look at my belly!"" 4- They gave us the appetizer sampler without asking (although the deal said we could choose two appetizers). Some of them were good, most of the not fresh especially the ugly salad and the worst part was there was a hidden garlic clove in the hummus!! Why? Why would you do that? I love garlic but not a raw clove as a surprise in the middle of my mouth! ughhhhhhh 5- We spent $66 for this crap where we could have twice the amount of food and 10 times the taste at Noon o Kabab but I'm glad we are alive and not in a hospital!",0.9964,0.721,0.178,0.101,0.5924660154660155

The service was a little slow, which I think is maybe more of a cultural thing than truly a reflection of the restaurant. The appetizers were delicious-took the advice of other reviews to get hummus and lentil soup. Drinks were also good (White Russian and Pars Iced Tea), but didn't offer too many interesting choices (and drinks didn't qualify for the minimum on the  restaurant.com  certificate I had). I was particularly let down by the entree, though. We ordered the kabob platter which had enough food to satisfy my boyfriend and me, but was a lot less than I expected for $36! The quality of the meat wasn't particularly good either, but the veggies were fresh at least. The complimentary ice cream was tasty and the rose with the check was a nice touch. If I were to go back again, I'd probably want to take advantage of the outdoor dining area and just stick to appetizers and drinks.",0.9875,0.817,0.183,0.0,0.3800213675213675

Came with whole wheat and white pita. Excellent start to a meal! Everything tasted very fresh, not oversalted. The scallops I ordered then came out and were served in a sauce with mushrooms and some rice. Very tasty although could've used a bit more of the sauce to spread the flavor to the rice, and/or more mushrooms to spread it out a little bit. I also tried the salmon my grandma ordered, and another fish that my mom ordered, both of which were good. They both loved their dishes. The service was superb. Very laid back, quiet atmosphere.

I'm pretty good at math, and I couldn't derive how he calculated the tax or gratuity. I didn't bring it up to him because I would have been more embarrassed than happy to get a few bucks back, and since I'd saved some money with the Groupon, I tipped him anyways.

2012-04-21,4.0,"I used to live in East Lakeview, but never got around to dining at Pars Cove. Too bad, but I'm glad I finally got to visit. It's a small place with a welcoming staff and a simple menu of Persian dishes. The menu format offers entrées by type of meat, with each available in a variety of saucings, as well as an appetizer sampler plate. The appetizer sampler was fresh, tasty, and prettily presented. We both opted for braised lamb shank (my companion's with pomegranate/walnut sauce, and mine with garlic/cilantro), and both of us enjoyed its falling-off-bone succulence. We were using a coupon, which included a ""house dessert"" of ice cream and carrot cake, which was plain but pleasant. Our deal included a bottle of wine from among a basic selection of food-friendly choices. The staff was uniformly cordial, including the proprietor, who stopped by to say hello, explain the check, and present us with a rose. Nice. The prices are fair, even without the coupon, though not inexpensive - our meal would have been about $85 to $90, exclusive of tip and tax. Now that I've been there, I'm likely to go back - we had a nice meal and a good time. ps - I initially had a similar reaction as Anna T, below, when I received the bill -- it seemed like the tip & tax were too high. However, I went back and looked at the Groupon offer -- it was valued at $114, the tip was 16% of that and the tax was commsurate, as well. To me, the $114 valuation was at least $24 higher than menu price, but since I paid $49 for the Groupon, I was OK with it -- it was still a good deal in my book.",0.9938,0.802,0.176,0.022,0.545420634920635

We had a decent bottle of wine, and a good selection of the food. Everything tasted pretty good (except the spicy sauce on my sea bass was so packed with jalapenos it was inedible - and I love spice). Anyways, it was all fine and good until we got the check. Basically, the owner added 50% of our total bill in tax and tip - now, we all know Chicago taxes are high, but not that high. I tip 20% standard, and would have happily tipped 20% for this meal. I imagine that this is because people using the Groupon in the past have shorted out their waitstaff, but I do not feel I should have to make up for that. The worst part is that the actual value of the meal was listed on the menu and it was not much higher than the Groupon, so that did not make up the difference. We didn't want to be rude and fight it, but I did feel that it was sort of a sneaky and not-so-nice move to add that much tip for a meal that would not have cost that much even at full price listed on the menu.

The waitresses were incredibly nice. We started with some hummus and pita and a bottle of the Malbec.  Before main course arrived, we were served some salad for no charge. For the entree, I ordered the lamb shank with rice. I loved it! The meat was super tender and soaked in spices. I highly recommend trying it. After dinner, the restaurant brought some desserts to the table. Again, this was on the house.

We got to our table soon enough. We ordered the veggie dolmas, feta and olives and the calamari. All the apps were delicious and the bread was real good too. We ordered 4 entrees - vegetarian sabzi, vegetarian arrabiatta and another veggie dish with pomegranate walnut sauce and the lamb with saffron. All of the dishes were very flavorful,  and had unique spices and sauces. At the end of the meal we were all given complimentary desserts - 5 bowls of delicious ice cream sprinkled with cinnamon and drizzled with honey. Yum!

Everything about our dinner was perfect.  Quality of food, service, prices, ambience, I loved it all.   We decided to go with the special for 2 people, which includes 2 appetizers, 2 entrees that come with soup/salad, 2 drinks, and 2 desserts. All for $20 a person! We got the hummus and olive tapenade which were absolutely delicious. For dinner I got the filet mignon with a walnut pomegranate sauce, which had an interestingly sweet flavor and the meet was cooked perfectly medium as I asked.  And for dessert you get vanilla ice cream with honey and cinnamon drizzled on top.  I didn't expect the place to be so great, and the service was respectful but on top of everything we needed. It's the type of place I would expect to see further downtown and with higher prices, but luckily for me it's right around the corner from my apartment and without all the crowds. Also the owner was sitting behind us at one of the tables by the front, and he seemed to be a genuinely nice person because everyone kept coming up to him and chatting.   All in all a great and romantic experience, and I am now bringing everyone I know to my new neighborhood restaurant.

The chicken and beef kabobs are the best entrees, while the salads have unique dressings and freshly cut veggies in them. I recommend the appetizer sampler. The humus is great as well, as other reviewers have commented. I don't have a problem withe the wine prices, as $6 a glass always seems fair. The vegetarian dishes are pretty good as well. The desserts are an added bonus!  Dinner for 2 with appetizers and wine is always going to be under $60, a price you can't beat let alone when the quality of food is factored in.  The service is nice as well. The owner is always on hand - never spoken to him but seems to be a charming fella. His lovely wife will happily fix anything that goes wrong with your meal (they have occasionally brought out the wrong dish or been out of an ingredient for something I wanted) but they fix this without argument every time.

The bread was fresh out of the oven and had great flavor.  I was surprised by the mark-up on the wine; it was a bit outrageous but acceptable at 1/2 price.  My entree was very unique and flavorful.  I had beef cut into a few pieces (they called it filet mignon) with a pomegranate walnut sauce.  It was a moderate portion and the beef was cooked through though I had asked for medium.  Service was slow - the entrees took a while.  In any case, it was a great dish.  I really enjoyed the sweet/tart fruit flavor with the hearty beef.  They won me over in the end when they provided not only complimentary ice cream and baklava, but also roses for the women at the table!  It was cute!",0.9778,0.763,0.191,0.045,0.7010416666666666
2011-07-16,3.0,"Pars Cove, what went wrong? Our relationship was so good in the beginning. Sigh.  First off, I'll start by saying the food is a 4 or 5. I've been coming here for years, and it has some of my favorite Middle Eastern/ Persian food around. Some my favs are the appetizer sampler (which includes Bulgarian feta... fetafetafeta!!), the chicken kabob, the scallop kabob, and the shrimp. The hummus and lentil soup are yummy too.  The ambiance is dark and intimate. It is a pretty cute place. The owner is very friendly and sweet, and we typically end up with complimentary soup, kashk, and ice cream. The ice cream is SOO GOOD.. creamy and topped with honey. Oh and ladies get roses after dinner.  Okay, you ask, why only 3 stars? This should be 4 or 5 stars, right? Well, the service has been horrendous as of late. Probably a 1 or 2.  Typically dinner at Pars is an event that takes... well... awhile. However, the past few times I've been there it's been on the ridiculous side. We brought out-of-town friends in on a Friday night and, although the place was practically empty, our meal took FOREVER. We were there for almost 2.5 hours and only had one glass of wine. And it wasn't because we only wanted one glass of wine. Our waitress kept disappearing (and not returning), and I felt like we were inconveniencing the waitstaff by asking for anything. My BF had to hunt someone down so we could pay the bill, and after 2.5 hours of basically being ignored, we left with a horrible taste in our mouths. I was embarrassed that I talked the place up to my friends, and it was such a sub-PAR (okay, that was kinda funny) experience. If I can convince my BF to return (which seems nearly impossible after our last experience), I'd go for the food. I just hope Pars gets its act together, because I think everything else about this place is really great.",0.9819,0.805,0.137,0.058,0.6221315192743764

And for the capper.  When the waitress brought the bill, she had a single red rose with it!  So picture it, crazy delicious smiles from the honey cinnamon and while looking into the woman you love's eyes, the waitress comes with a red rose.  It was a perfect way to end the night, and something we will remember for a long time.",0.9917,0.739,0.208,0.052,0.560126488095238

Pita bread, hummus, potato salad- great tasting. Hummus had extra spices. My bf doesn't like hummus but loved their hummus.

We ordered the: 1.Lamb brisket w/ mushrooms, carrots, zucchini- lamb fell off the bone!! Had a nice light flavor. Large portion. Came with a side of rice that was also well spiced and had a touch of butter. 2. Beef brisket w/ a side of vegetables- was a little more well done than I had ordered (originally wanted medium rare). Had a nice light flavor ( not as soft as he lamb though). Mushrooms & carrots were good, carrots a little bit on the harder side. The rice pilaf was delicious. 3. Choice of soup or salad w/ main course. There was lentil soup that was good, but not everyone will like it. It takes a certain taste. Other choice was balsamic vinegar salad- which I loved!

2010-08-11,4.0,"Pars Cove was offering a full-course Persian meal (including drinks) and so my boyfriend and I decided to try them out. They are only partially accessible (outdoor by not indoor seating), but the family atmosphere and great food made for a great evening. Here's the ""couple"" deal: an appetizer, entree (with soup or salad), desert, and a drink for $20 each. We had the humus and goat cheese plates; small but fantastic. You can select from the whole menu, so we had wine along with a salmon and Chilean sea bass entrees. Both fish dishes were fabulous, but I highly recommend the salmon with pomegranate sauce paired with the house zinfandel.  The restaurant is family owned and operated, which resulted in a bit shoddy and at the same time overattentive service. However, it was a beautiful night, and when things got busy, the owner, in a jovial mood, walked around to the outdoor tables pouring out a free glass of wine to each of us.

You cant go wrong with the recommended meal package they have. i had the bass cooked with herbs and lemon. Very lightly cooked and yummy. Also had kebabs, eggplant and another appetizer that i cant remember.  i would recommend this place for a casual meal with friends and family or even a date. friendly owner/service wins me over every time.",0.962,0.729,0.248,0.023,0.6076666666666667

Last week, on one of the hotter evenings in Chicago, we were looking for an outside place to eat so we were walking by the Diablo? Italian restaurant across from Duffys and next to Pars. After going in and reading their menu, the owner from Pars Cove stopped us on the street and asked us to look at there menu. My boyfriend, who's always up for an adventure, was all about trying the place. The owner offered us a deal on the 2 appetizer, 2 entree, 2 drinks and 2 dessert special they have....only $40 bucks! All of the reviews are right on and I would definitely recommend this place to others. We sat outside at a small, romantic table and had a perfect evening.  I think we would have paid a lot more for this dinner it was that good. The hummus was awesome and very fresh. Definitely one of our favorites. He had the seafood dish which he liked, but I think he wished he had gone for something with lamb, like I did. The lamb kabobs were excellent! We ordered 2 glasses of wine with our meal and towards the end of the meal, the owner came by and gave us another complimentary 2 glasses.

The decor is subtle and understated, the lighting is dimmed. Perfect for a date place -- my girlfriend was with us and loved it. We got the appetizer sampler, which was *plenty* for four people, especially with the addition of the chicken salad, compliments of the owner (more on this later). The Kashk (baked eggplant dip) and houmus were out of this world, and the bread was perfect with them. I also got Persian tea to start with, which has a dash of cardamom in it. Perfectly complements the flavor. My girlfriend got a really pleasant glass of Shiraz. Onto the main course: the braised lamb shank in a walnut pomegranate sauce was tender and flavorful. My friend had dropped his knife and asked for a new one; the host joked that he didn't need it for the lamb. He was right -- it fell right off the bone. We had to rush and asked for the check, and the owner gave us complimentary ice cream with cardamom and honey, in addition to some pistachio baklava. Then he gave me a red rose to give to my girlfriend. This guy knows how to please a customer. Some of the most attentive and sincere service I've ever had at a restaurant.

The waitress was great as we moved from outside to inside as we had our twins along with us and it was getting colder in the night air. She very graciously accommodated us. Our little boy does not like sauces and it was hard to find. At first they were not able to help us in making something without sauce but the son (we believe) of the owner was cooking that night and he came out , apologized and whipped up some pasta for our little boy. Hugh points in our book as it allowed the rest of us to enjoy our wonderful meal. Everything we ordered was amazing. If I could have picked up the plates and licked them I would have done so.  We did return later in the year on Halloween evening and it was an ok experience with the same type of meals. The sauces were just not that great and flavorful as they were during our Aug experience.  I think the father was cooking this night. So we believe that it can vary based on who is cooking.

My friend was visiting and before he left he wanted some middle Eastern food because he doesn't have access to it in Brazil. Thanks to Yelp for bringing this place to mind because I've passed by it a few times but have never been here. Always, really hoidy-toidy looking.  The Wednesday night we went to was pretty terrible out and two hours close to closing there was no one there. Since we were the only table it's kind of hard to gauge service but our waitress was attentive and helpful. We picked the dinner for two which is a great deal: two drinks, two appetizers and two entrees.  I never had Kashk before but I liked the flavor of it, the mix of milk and eggplant reminded me of something but I'm not sure what it is. Whatever it was it was good. The hummus was okay I've had better from other places but not a bad one either. My friend rather unimaginatively got the chicken kabob but it was really good, the roasted vegetables really blended well with the roasted chicken. It really made the whole dish, which is hard for me as a meat lover to admit. The filet vino is a little strange to see but also delicious, again the mushrooms and the wine made the filet's sweetness stick out. Sort of like a marsala.

You can finish it without feeling like you are going to explode, especially if you accompany it with one of the delicious Californian cabernets or merlots that they offer.

The first sign that something was wrong were the rusted binder clips caked with dried food particles that fastened the paper covering to the table.  A reasonably priced feta plate came in a portion that seemed stingy even for the price, and by the time I was able to get someone's attention to ask for some non-present silverware, my dining partner had already eaten most of it.  Next was a lentil soup that was so bad I could not eat it despite being quite hungry and a fan of lentils.  I think it must have been burned or something else terribly wrong.  For entrees, the ""farm fresh chicken"" fesenjan was basically like someone's mother's dry overcooked grocery store chicken breast sitting on a plate drowning in a sauce whose taste can only be described as mud-like.  The only redeeming moment was the free ice cream with honey and spice, but even this seems like something a five year old should be able to execute.  So the next time I want persian food, I'll head to another of the city's tried and true establishments.  Even if four out of five times this place is great, the fifth time justifies going elsewhere.",0.8751,0.776,0.13,0.093,0.6055483405483404

2009-04-20,5.0,"Pars Cove is a nice, little ""romantic-ish"" joint for Mediterranean food in the Lincoln Park area, right off the Fullerton exit of LSD.  I say it's romantic-ish because it's got the whole dim candle-lit experience goin' on there, without looking cheesy or overdone. However, instead of a hot date, I highly recommend going in a large group because they totally hook you up if you have a larger party (we had 10).  I'm not sure if he was the owner, but the most pleasant old man came by to offer us a sweet deal on a ""family-style"" dinner that includes a little bit of everything the place has to offer, including hummus, lentil soup, eggplant, steak (friggin' awesome!), sea bass, chicken, rice, and ice cream/pie dessert.  All of this was offered at a flat rate of 18 bucks per person and I thought it was a hella good deal, given how much food there was and considering how dang tender and tasty the large steak morsels were.  The service was very quick and quite pleasant, so I'm not sure if it was because we had a large group or not, but I was definitely impressed that they could manage our group dinner so nicely.  They even gave each of the girls a single red rose, which was certainly a nice surprise touch at the end.  The ice cream a la mode (is that what you call it) was just OK, but it was just light enough to not make you feel like you just pigged out. Metered street parking was surprisingly not too bad when we went on a Saturday night at 630/7pm or so, and the restaurant was not crowded either, so we were seated right away in the back, where there's a larger seating area.   I'd probably give it 4.5 stars (because of the lackluster dessert), but Yelp doesn't allow that, so 5 stars it is.  Pars Cove is a semi-hidden gem with a nice homey feel to it (furthered by the wait staff and pleasant owner), and I'll gladly go back sometime to have some of that steak again, f'sho!",0.9963,0.8,0.178,0.023,0.6106860670194003

2009-03-28,4.0,"My boyfriend and I went here for a casual dinner one Sunday night. It was below street level, which I always like in a restaurant - it gives it a hidden, secret quality. Two other couples were in the dining area with us. I liked the ambiance - it was warm and cozy, and you could watch people walk down the street if you looked up and out the window. Our waitress was extremely quiet, but all our food came out correctly and in a timely fashion, so no complaints there.  Tay and I agreed that the hummus was really special. It had something unique in it - dill, we thought - that gave it a real flavor compared to most other restaurants where the hummus tastes of nothing but chickpeas. The pita appeared to be fresh baked - it was hot and flaky when we ripped it in pieces.  I loved the lentil soup because it was extremely simple. It tasted very much like the lentil soup made by my family. Certainly nothing fancy going on with it, but that is why I liked it.  Our entrees were also lovely - I tasted Tay's kebab, which I though was very well prepared, but the seafood entree (Seafood Mediterranean) was really something. The rice had been cooked in a seafood broth, and the dish was loaded with different kinds of flaky, juicy seafood. I wish there had been more shrimp and scallops - there were many pieces of some kind of white fish, but not as much of the other seafood. Also, the vegetables seemed to have come from a ""vegetable medley"" can or frozen bag. The overall taste effect was fine, but it felt a bit silly every time I spotted a corn kernel or carrot cube in the dish.  After we had finished, the waitress brought over free ice cream - it was absolutely decadent. Nothing but vanilla ice cream with honey and cinnamon, but it was such a treat. I had no idea it was so simple to make boring vanilla ice cream taste so exotic and luxurious. It was a perfect end to the meal. I also was given a long stem rose at the end of dinner (as are all the ladies), which was a very elegant and thoughtful touch.",0.9939,0.783,0.171,0.046,0.578652557319224

I'm a big fan of Mediterranean food, however there was a dish in particular Chad wanted me to try. He really enjoys this chicken dish that comes with a walnut pomegranate sauce. Sounds a little adventurous...I know, I was a little skeptical about trying it, but then again, he always suggest the most exotic items on menus and I always end up loving them! For starters, we had a Platter of Hummus, Baba Ghanoush, Feta, Dolmeh (Grape Leaves Stuffed W/Veggie, legumes, herbs, Baked) followed by the Vegetarian Lentil Soup (to die for, especially with the Pita...YUMM) and for our entree, Max was kind enough to put together something special, which included, the grilled salmon and baby lamb with that walnut pomegranate sauce....OMG, when Chad went to pick up the lamb shank, the meat just fell off the bone, that's how tender and juicy it was.

I cannot speak to what it may be like on the weekend. The service was speedy and friendly. The first time I ate there I had a sort of shrimp salad, I think, which was not excellent. The second time, however, I had the a sea bass special, which was. I think the atmosphere is cozy and generally nice, though it could probably use some work. The prices are reasonable, as the seafood, in particular, seems to be very fresh. I recommend the Persian Tea for a drink, and do take advantage of the bread and hummus that comes with dinner. What really stands out to me is that on my second evening at Pars Cove, after dinner, our server gave my table (three of us) a baklava and ice cream dessert for free--just like that. And our bill came with long stem roses. Nice.",0.9708,0.817,0.157,0.026,0.5414786967418547

I only got take out from Pars Cove since I lived a block away, but passing the time was a breeze thanks to the very warm & friendly servers. The small space was very cozy & inviting--it would make a great date spot, but not overly romantic, so it would still be good for dinner with friends. The food, however, was so-so. Not bad, but not as flavorful as I'd like. Based on this trip I'd prefer nearby Aladdin's or Zad. That being said, the servers & setting were so nice I can definitely see myself giving it a second chance in the future.",0.9883,0.624,0.307,0.069,0.5711904761904762

The food was excellent both times I have been there. i went on Monday and all the entrees were 1/2 price! I had the eggplant appetizer, which is a paste of yummy excellence. I also had an entree of vegetables in a walnut pomegranite sauce. Very, very good. They brought out complimentary ice cream at the end as well. A great place to bring vegetarians but their meat is really good as well. I will be back for sure.",0.9801,0.713,0.287,0.0,0.6817171717171718

The waiter did tell us about the salmonella scare with the Taste of Chicago - and that their hummus was confiscated.  But how do you get salmonella from hummus????  Either way, we didn't get sick :)",0.7674,0.825,0.114,0.061,0.4683673469387755
2007-06-22,5.0,"I can't express in words my love for Pars Cove. My boyfriend and I checked it out because we were starving and it was the closest thing to his house. Holy geez, this place really is Chicago's best hidden secret restaurant in my opinion.   It really is like a little cozy cove. We always sit underneath the skylight. The atmosphere is so wonderful and unique, a great date restaurant. Every time I've been there haven't been a lot of people. It's usually quiet and romantic. Their cool sampler platter is a must if you go there. I've had their lamb and their chicken with the walnut pomegranate sauce. Everything I've had there has been awesome. Their piping hot flatbread is so damn good. I love bread, it 's my favorite food, and every time I go there I keep asking for more until I feel like I might explode.  Their hot tea is absolutely wonderful if you love tea like I do. I had their Turkish coffee and I was afraid I wouldn't  sleep for a week. As for dessert, the ones I've had have been frozen and then thawed so when they arrived they were a bit hard in parts. If they were a little more soft they would have been really delicious. For free they give you vanilla ice cream with cinnamon and honey. It's a great end to the meal, I now make my vanilla ice cream Par's Cove style at home.  And of course, the ladies get a rose at the end of the meal. Between 3 and 6pm they have early dinner specials so go then or during lunch for great deals!",0.9966,0.749,0.226,0.025,0.6602380952380953
2007-06-18,4.0,"It was a dark and stormy night...heh, I always wanted to start off a sentence saying that. Actually when we went to Pars Cove it was raining buckets out but it wasn't dark so at least I got it half right. Quiet evening for the restaurant, there were only two other tables there when we arrived. We were greeted right away by the host and were told we could pick any table. We picked a cozy table towards the back of the restaurant. We were given our menus and the specials and yay...they had Sangria!  We decided to go with the cool platter. For our entrees I had the split pea and crushed tomato with lime sauce over chicken and my husband got the salmon and lamb skewer.  Cool platter came out first and it was really yummy. I especially liked the hummus and the salad. Next came the vegetarian lentil soup. Soup was good but we both added some salt and pepper. Our entrees came out next and ooo they were so good. My chicken was just a bit on the dry side but everything else was just wonderful.  We asked for a dessert menu but we were both so stuffed that we thought we would just look to see what they had for next time. Our waitress informed us that the meal came with ice cream, drizzled with honey and sprinkled with cinnamon. Ouch. Okay, we got one order. Ooo, I was hurtin'. The meal ended with me getting a beautiful red rose.  I loved Pars Cove and will definitely be back and next time with friends...yeah and my husband too...he is my ride after all. ;)",0.9938,0.821,0.167,0.012,0.4822789115646259
2007-06-05,4.0,"A 4 star restaurant with absolute potential for 5. This place had THE BEST hummus I have ever had!!! Try the cool sampler platter and you'll get to taste a bit of everything from the appetizer list.  I also had the beef tenderloin marinated with the walnut pomegranate sauce. The sauce is real sweet, usually not to my liking, but it was terrific! The beef was extremely tender without a bit of fat or hard to chew bites to be found. It was served with rice and a cucumber type salad.  My experience here was so excellent it left me questioning why it was so dead there. Granted it was a Monday night, but i hope my review will spark peoples' interest in going here. You don't even really have to love Mediterranean to like this place, as the beef w/ walnut pomegranate was not a dish I would classify as being Mediterranean cuisine.  Look for an update to a 5 star on this one next time I go back.",0.984,0.719,0.211,0.07,0.5510416666666665
2007-04-19,5.0,"Thank You Yelp! I would of never found this place otherwise. The 'Cool Sampler' is a great appetizer to get. I don't even know how to describe how good the hummus is. I don't think I have had better hummus anywhere. The restaurant is huge, A few of us went here for lunch the other day and we were the only ones in there. So kick-ass service! They have great lunch specials too, but it may take you over an hour. At least it did for us and that was appetizer, entrees and coffee. Deliver area is huge too, they came all the way to North & Ashland.",0.9272,0.841,0.159,0.0,0.6295454545454546
2007-01-18,5.0,"After stumbling across some of the reviews for Pars Cove on Yelp, myself and a date ventured down Sheridan to Diversey for some Persian goodness. I tend not to be huge on Middle Eastern food, so I was a bit skeptical, but I wanted to try it anyway. Am I ever glad that I did! The restaurant itself is a small, hole-in-the-wall basement joint that we almost missed. Inside is rather cavernous, dimly lit, cozy and easily romantic.  I love hummus, so we started with that as an appetizer, and it was indeed delicious. Some of the best I've had.  Both my date and I got the pomegranate walnut sauce entrees (lamb and chicken, respectively), and they were delicious delicious delicious. Somewhat sweet with a lot of depth, served with not overly impressive but still quite good salad and rice. We also were suprised with how much extra food we got, with lentil soup coming out before our meal, and amazing, yet simple, vanilla ice cream with honey and cinnamon afterward. I was also given a rose that I left, a nice touch, to be sure. This also makes PC a great place to come on a date, as my doorman made a remark about the rose when I walked in to the effect of ""how nice my date was to buy me one."" Look like a guy with extra game and just pay for dinner! Overall, an excellent meal. I can't wait to go back, and the variety of entrees (not overly meat-y as I was a little concerned it would be) makes it a great place for anyone. We also got a takeout menu with some insane prix fixe deals on it, including a three course meal for two with a bottle of wine for $40.

2006-11-24,3.0,"This Persian/Mediterranean place is pretty cool.  it's very under-the-radar, below street level on a busy stretch of diversey.  we found the homemade hummus excellent (ask for extra flatbread), you get good lentil soup with your entrees, and our meals were good, but not excellent (the four of us had dill salmon, chicken, lamb, and veggies with eggplant entrees).  every entree comes with a tiny scoop of vanilla ice cream with honey and cinnamon on top - and none of us are dessert eaters, and would never had eaten this were it not included, but it tasted so good. a few things would have made this place four-five stars - selling the hookah (I saw the hookah on my way to the bathroom, and asked, server didn't know at first but informed us of the price and that we'd have to move to the back to smoke - fair enough, but an upsell would have helped) - and less seasoned food - the food was good, but we commented on the fact that it was over seasoned and would prefer to taste the food over the seasoning. all said, i LOVE the hummus and will be back, and the price was right.",0.9879,0.831,0.169,0.0,0.4894285714285715

2006-04-03,5.0,"I went there for the second time yesterday; this time on a date. I can't say enough good things about Pars Cove. A friend and I stumbled into the restaurant after seeing a film at Landmark Century Cinema. The service and the food are exceptional.  Last night, we started with the Cool Sampler, which consists of dolmeh, salad, hummus, feta, and baba ganoush and it's served with piping hot flatbread. Then came the vegetarian lentil soup. For an entree, I had the chicken in lime and herbs over rice. You have to let it rest in your mouth for a moment before chewing it up because the flavor is unlike anything else I've ever had (and oh so tasty). Though, I liked mine a tad better, my date's chicken was cooked in a honey type of sauce and was succulent. For dessert, they bring out vanilla ice cream with honey drizzled on top; a perfect end to a meal. As mentioned in another review, all ladies do get a rose with the check. This kind of a place is almost nonexistant. Anyone who wants something above par on every level, this is the place to try. EDIT: I was one of the people with food poisoning after eating the hummus at the Taste. I'm heartbroken, really heartbroken since this restaurant will likely fizzle out due to the incidents at the Taste and it was quite good.
