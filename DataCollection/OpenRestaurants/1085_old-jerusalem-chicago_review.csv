My mom tried their meat combination platter and she said it was absolutely fantastic and my dad said that his Greek salad with grilled chicken was the best food he has eaten with me during the whole week visiting me in Chicago.

The food here is very comparable to pita inn in the suburbs. Of course my criticism will be much more harsh since I am middle eastern myself.  But in the area I would rather go to Diwali or even olive.

2017-05-19,5.0,"This is the best middle eastern cuisine in the city, and I stand by it.  They take such pride in their cooking, and the attention to detail is incredible.  You do however need to know what to order.  I always go with the musaheb chicken, which is marinated for a couple days and then char grilled to perfection. Ask for the secret garlic sauce to go with the chicken.  If you want vegetarian, make sure you order the tabuli and the hummus, ask for some pickled radishes (they make their own).  Everything is fresh, made to order, and most importantly HEALTHY.  The kefta and shwarma are the best I've ever had, and the last time I was there, I had 2 guests with me, and they would have never ordered either of those two dishes on their own, but without even knowing what they were eating, they LOVED LOVED LOVED every bite.  I don't think there was any left for me to try.  If you are going healthy, they have wheat pitas and homemade hot sauce that you can drizzle on everything.  Lastly, you must try their Harisa dessert.  It is a very simple square pastry, that consists of cornmeal, coconut, and honey, but that description does not do it justice.  I special order a sheet of this from them for family parties and it's one of my best kept secrets.  I almost don't want to brag about this restaurant because they are too busy as it is, but this is a family owned and operated establishment, and you will not find a place that prides itself in it's cooking the way that Old Jerusalem does!  Although they are a fast-casual joint, the dishes that come out of their kitchen are first class and really the gold standard for middle eastern cuisine.",0.9942,0.821,0.168,0.011,0.49165386584741433

The restaurant was packed through our stay, but they still made it easy to increase our party size. There was a little bit of a wait... but it was soooooo worth it!  First of all, SUPER CHEAP BYOB-- have you ever freaking heard of only paying $1.50 per person corkage??  Hummos, taboolee, shawarma, falafels for our appetizers and holy moly the dolmas! Our appetizer course was amazing. For the 8 of us we got 6 entrees to share which included mixed grill and the kefta kabob plate among some others that I can't remember... I tried everything and omg it tasted so good! To top it off- they have fresh baklava! It was soooooo good!  That's the food-- now onto the service... like i said, it was super super packed.... we waited less than 10 min for our table... our waitress took care of us quickly, getting our bottles of wine opened and taking our orders. The food came out in a relatively fast manner, and we were well taken care of. It seemed like there was a fast turnaround on tables while we were there.

Falafel and a kefta. We loved the flavors! Everything is fresh! We tried the Arabic coffee which is a little like Greek coffee but a bit sweet and really good.  Some people came in as we were finishing and they acted like they had been in before as they ordered quickly. They had entrees that smelled and looked amazing!!!  I also loved that there was an elderly woman at a table drinking coffee and eating a bit. She had an apron on and I think she worked in the restaurant. So cool. I asked about the ingredients in the kefta and the server had the chef come over to tell us.

The shawarma was too salty and the kofta was even more so...to the point where it was so distracting, I couldn't eat any more.  I will say that this place is super busy and it seems like they probably get a lot of to-go orders because the phone is always ringing as well as the fax machine. So maybe I just had an off plate.

Not fine dining by any means but great for a quick dinner stop in. Saw lots of pick up orders as well which isn't surprising Ordered the standards... Hummus, Baba Ganoush and Tabbouleh salad to start, then got the combination platter plus the Shish Tawouk (sp?) wrap/sandwich.  The sandwich was amazing!!! The garlic sauce plus the pickles added a contrast of flavors and the chicken was juicy and tender.  Combination platter was decent although the shawarma on it was a little dry.  Starters were all standard and good, served with warm pita.  Their Baklava was excellent...clear that its handmade with a distinct essence of rosewater.

Food: Appetizers- Vegetarian Combination Plate- Hummus, baba ganouj, tebouleh, Jerusalem salad, 3 Falafel. Perfect to split between 3. Lentil Soup- My friend orders this everywhere and said this particular one was one of her favs. Entrees- Greek Salad with Shwarma - Not as good as the one at Athenian room, SO much Shwarma which was nice. It was good, I`d get it again! Baked Kefta- We didn't even know what kefta was but the waiter recommended this and it was truly the winner of the night (we got it baked in Tahini but also would have been great with the tomato sauce). The flavors complemented eachother perfectly. Shwarma Sandwich- Comes in lebanese bread instead of typical pita (although they had that too) and was very good and a good size.

2016-01-22,5.0,"#21 Old Jerusalem was super yummy and delicious.  I think I might have just discovered a new staple for my Chicago visits.   Old Jerusalem is such a lovely little restaurant. The space is replete with Middle Eastern culture. When you walk in you hear beautiful, regional music, you see gorgeous fabric murals and rugs along the walls along with other tiny art pieces.  The staff is friendly, inviting and welcoming.   I knew I was in the right place for a late lunch.  This is most definitely a ""mom and pop"" type place, and highly authentic.  The staff makes you feel so welcome and does not rush you out of the place.  It is as if they want you there, enjoying the food, relaxing and soaking in the atmosphere. This is the real deal... And I speak from a certain point/place of knowledge ;) We ordered the Combo Platter to start while we made several other choices. This lavish platter comes with Falafel (my absolute favorite), Baba-ghanoush, Hummus, Tabbouleh, a delicious salad and of course--pita bread for dipping into all those wonderful spreads.   We also had the Chicken Kebob--yep, you guessed it--to die for!  Nick got the Stuffed Grape Leaves and we made him share.  Lauren ordered the Kefka Kebob and that was a super display of the right way to serve lamb.  I went ahead and grabbed a(nother) Falafel wrapped in pita as well; because the falafel on the platter was so amazing I had to have more.   I seriously forgot I was in Chicago for a moment and had returned to the Old City for real... That is really saying something.  We completed our ridiculously amazing meal with a few baklava desserts, since the food was so super good we seemingly lost the art of ""sharing"" somewhere along the way and knew to order a few. Wait... Did I mention the whole BYOB thing?  I thought we only did that in Cali with wine.  Not so.  The corkage fee was nothing like we are used to in the Bay Area either.  Thank you Old Jerusalem ;) Stephani Smiles for Old Jerusalem ;) #byobandbereadyforleftovers",0.9973,0.734,0.226,0.04,0.5832813852813853

I don't usually like eating Middle Eastern food at restaurants.... either they over cook stuff, the service sucks, or the food is bland and muted to appeal to the American palate. Not the case here!  It's such a cute restaurant. There are little touches of the culture, but nothing overwhelming. Soft music, an embroidered mural, little pieces of art, it's pretty and I like it. Add to that the fact that the food is all so fresh and comes to you super fast and I want to come back all the time.  So. I. Have. Been.  I come every week. It's a family restaurant and you can tell. This summer I've seen the owner's kids sitting quietly in their corners with their electronics or even rolling silverware (so adorbs!) and even a little old lady who I'm sure is the matriarch either sitting outside enjoying the sunshine or relaxing in her corner of the restaurant overseeing the excellent service!

Their lentil soup however is pretty addicting and I really need to figure out their recipe for that soup! I found myself having difficult sharing that soup with Matt, so definitely something I would come back and order again. We also got a dish I had never heard of before called Arayes which took over 20 minutes to wait! It said that clarification on the menu too, but we had pretty much finished our entrees by the time it came out so it was more like a post appetizer ha ha It is like a middle eastern flat bread topped with ground lamb and it was pretty good, but I would have liked it to start my meal rather than end it. Then we also got their kefta sausage sandwich which I think also was one of the best dishes we got.

2013-06-24,4.0,"If we are to judge on food alone, this place is a solid 4 stars.  I am an Arab by origin. I have eaten hummos, falafil, and the such in Chicago, Amman, Beirut, Bethlehem, and Damascus, hence my review here will have some credibility. This is definitely a restaurant where you want to take the food to go.  The inside is very drab and doesn't have to be but apparently its owners don't know any better. Service was awkward and bizarre and weak all at the same time.This place appears to do good business, but 90% is carry out and it is easy to see why. The food was quite good.  Some of the best hummos and baba ghanoush i have ever had.  The mezzes had just the right amount of salt and lemon without being overpowering, and the baba ghanouj wasnt overpowered by garlic, often a common Arab flaw. Their version of the Greek Salad was good but no reason to use Iceberg lettuce. I can tell you as an operator, Romaine is cheap enough where no restaurant should ever use Iceberg in any salad. Their Tabouleh was killer. It wasnt chopped to fine which is a common mistake. When it is cut too fine, it soakes up to much of the oil and lemon,and becomes soggy.  Theirs was cut perfect making it more of a salad in texture. Also, while the standard procedure is to soak the bulgur (cracked wheat), a main ingredient in tabouleh), to to make it soft, Old Jerusalem does not giving it tabouleh a nice crunch. Falafil was a bit overspiced but defintely met my high standard. Price points for appetizers salads, appetizer spreads, and sandwiches are very good especially given the high rents of the neighborhood. Howvever, the meat and chicken entrees were high in relation to other menu items and what additional food u get: Cheap rice and a generic salad. My grilled chicken kabob sandwich was awesome. Their sauce is a perfect mixture of tahini and lemon. If you live in the neighborhood and looking for solid hummus, falafil, tabbouleh, and kabob...essentially ARAB cuisine staples, Old Jerusalem works. Lastly, perhaps it was day old bread for we came on a sunday, but food rating lost a star because the bread was lackluster.

While talking to him, it sounds like he got a good deal - a mountain of falafel and hummus along with jerusalem salad and tabbouleh for not that much money. I guess that's a score. The problem is that this was literally the worst meal of Mediterranean food I've had in my life. The hummus (how do you mess up hummus? 4 ingredients!) had no flavor. I genuinely do not believe they added lemon juice to it. It was paste - the consistency of mashed potato. Suitable for spackling. No lemon juice. No garlic. Just paste. The falafel was unbearably dry. The crust gave a nice crunch, but you're no supposed to get that crunch all the way to the center. The falafel just crumbled on your tongue.

However, this falafel needs no embellishment; the patties are spiced vigorously, burst with flavor, and are fried to a delectable crunch. They're awesome. For what its worth, the toppings, while spartan, are exceptional; briefly, the tomato managed to distract me from the falafel.  I have to knock down a star because of the hummus ($4.75), which is pricey and a bit bland for my taste, and for the pita, which while not unpleasant, is served at room temperature and is not made in house. Also for these reasons, Pita Inn still holds my top spot for Middle Eastern food in the vicinity of Chicago.

My brother and I happened on this place, when we came to Old Town and were looking for something ethnic. We you walk in, Brass wall hangings and warm maroon and crème colors fill the interior, producing an authentic ambiance. The casual atmosphere, with the option to dine inside or in their outdoor patio during the summer months is a plus.  I ordered the labneh, home strained yogurt topped with olive oil, which epitomizes their commitment to freshness. Not too tart, it a tasty, healthy option. Their baba ganouj, blended eggplant and tahini served as a cold dip with tomatoes, onions, olive oil, with its surprising smoky taste and melded fresh herbs is scrumptious. I'm a big fan of baba ganouj and I would say that it's one of the best I've had. The Lebanese pita, if only served warm, is otherwise just right; soft and light. The thickness is unique. Not too thick nor to thin. My brother ordered the the falafel , perfectly crispy on the outside and moist and flavorful inside without being greasy. It seemed that all the entrée options have large proportions. However, they lack variety in preparations for their meat entrees.  For example, unlike most Middle Eastern restaurants, they don't prepare chicken shawirma, but only a beef and lamb combination.  The shawirma, rather than diced/shredded like at most other Middle Eastern restaurants, is sliced like gyro meat. They even proclaim that their shawirma sandwich is ""Our version of a Gyro."" I was surprised and didn't feel like it was shawirma, but it still tasted good.  Their sandwiches are also generously large and delectable, but are hard to eat. Rather than wrapping the bread around the filling, the filling is stuffed into the pita bread, which often breaks. You may need a fork and knife, but it's worth the effort.   The service is a hit or miss probably, because we had a really nice wait staff who were friendly and patient.  I can't wait to go back and try a few more of their appetizers and made in house desserts.",0.992,0.807,0.159,0.034,0.5284361471861473

2010-09-13,4.0,"I have found that exploring other cities over long weekends is a very exciting way to satisfy more than just the cultural junkie in me--it is an even better way for satisfying the foodie in me.   My native Philadelphia is known for some very fine restaurants but not always for anything with a significant ethnic influence.  This is why Chicago--a city even more well known for its fantastic cuisine--was the perfect place to tease my palate.  The first choice?  Morrocan.   To my dismay, finding a Morrocan restaurant in the heart of Chicago on the weekend is a challenge.  So many of them either have limited menus or are only open for the business crowd.  Finally, after culling through an exhaustive list of deadends, we found Old Jerusalem. This spot is in a prime location--a great place to eat AND people watch.  With some outdoor seating and windows that open to the outside, the atmosphere is very inviting and familial.  Perhaps it was a tad too familial though, as upon entry, DC mentioned that it smelled slightly like grandparents.  Old people aroma or not, the service they provided was also quite good.  Orders were taken and plates placed very quickly.   First up - Falafel.  I must say it was cooked nearly to perfection, with just the right balance of creamyness and crispness.  The accompanying Tahini was also quite good, but the most amazing part was the texture of the pitas--I can never find ones like that at the grocer! Shortly after devouring the appetizer, we were presented with the main course.  I had the Kefta Kabob, and DC had the Baked Kefta in tomato sauce.  The Kabob was grilled and served with a grilled tomato, and it was delicious.  Oddly, a side salad of iceberg lettuce and tomato in tahini sauce was presented a la carte and again as the base of my main dish.  I found this to be a major overkill.   The Baked Kefta dish was prepared with a healthy amount of spice in a creamy tomato sauce (DC preferred this over more Tahini).  In both meals, the portion size was unbelivably generous; this was a statement overheard from many other diners as well.   All in all, this joint gets four stars for being open, having healthy portions, and overall taste.  If I could make any recommendations to them, it would be to have better air circulation to reduce the ""grandparent mothball"" aroma, as well as upgrade the quality of the rice being used.  DC made note that it was of middle-grade cafeteria consistency and served as a mere filler to an otherwise outstanding main dish.",0.998,0.785,0.193,0.022,0.5222380952380952

I'm not sure what the management setup is here, but there's an old lady and two middle-aged men, who may be her sons.  In any case, she is pleasant and seems to be running the show.  Today I saw her taking a delivery order out, for heaven's sake, leaving one guy to man the kitchen and the other to handle the entire front of house, including the patio.  They pulled it off though.

So five stars on that. Now this wasn't any ordinary group or any ordinary dinner. This was a reunion dinner for my Birthright trip that we had over winter break. That meant that not only were we 20 people, we were 20 hungry Jews who had just come back from eating hummus in the Middle East. And WE LOVED IT.  Every dish was perfect. We had: -Hummus -Tebouli -Shwarma Kebab -Chicken Kebab -Falafel -Jerusalem Salad -and then Pita with everything. My only criticism is the pita could have been warmer. Otherwise, everything was DELECTABLE. Even the tebouli, which I find is too dry at most places, had just the right amount of vinegar in it. The hummus was creamy and amply spiced, the Jerusalem salad had enough tomatoes in it (not to mention extra tahini sauce for dipping), and the falafel was fresh out of the frier.

It had been an old family haunt, I think we first started coming here in the late 80s, when we discovered the part of Chicago that lies between 900 North and Lincoln Square, the old-school one lined with delicatessens crammed with Fraus und Herrs. Back then, my parents associated falafel and hummus with their days of shopping on Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn nearly a decade before, and found Old Jerusalem to be an exotic, nostalgic gem.  Sadly, last night Old Jerusalem bore very little resemblance to our discovery so many years ago. While the hummus still held some of its magic, and my mom declared it better than Cedars of Lebanon down in Hyde Park, most everything else was mediocre. My lentil soup was on the bland side, even after a squeeze of lemon, and the potage was nearing watery. The tabouleh salad, while strong on the parsley, just the way I like it, had a sweet and sour apple cider vinegar aftertaste. I didn't have a falafel sandwich, but I can tell you that the ones from Sultan's Market look a lot better. There was a generous amount of feta cheese on my Greek salad, but shame on me for ordering something with tomatoes in winter.  Worst of all, the restaurant was freezing!

Catering ( again): I can't help but cater from this place, the falafel are great to get if you don't have time to go there in the morning, Heated up the next day taste great. The food is inexpensive and great tasting. The service is super great!",0.9921,0.736,0.254,0.01,0.49675925925925923

The Kiba is to die for and the Shawirma Sandwich is also great. I love the Hummus.

2007-06-08,3.0,"Tried this for carryout last night and wasn't terribly impressed. Food was ready quickly and it was fairly priced.. otherwise..the bread was bad. Like, they need to find a new supplier. Most middle eastern food I've had has served delicious homeade bread.. this was cold and gross, definitely out of a package. Hummus was just ok. My kafta sandwich had very little meat and a lot of lettuce. Overall probably wouldn't go back.",0.7484,0.704,0.191,0.106,0.4845811051693404

2007-04-27,4.0,"I love the chicken hummus and the falafel is generally pretty good. If I'm ordering lunch I normally just order the appetizer portion though since it is enough for me. The portions are fairly good sized, and this is one of the cheapest places to buy a meal in the Old Town neighborhood. Most other places within a block or two are either twice as much or they just serve okay food. We order delivery from here all the time, and it normally only takes 20 minutes, but my office is also only a few blocks away and we are regulars so tehy know what we order and that they generally always get a good tip so they seem to hurry right along.",0.8225,0.857,0.109,0.034,0.5783730158730159

It was competently prepared food, no real complaints, but it didn't exactly move my needle, or that of my dining companion, who grew up in Cairo. Sometimes, you need Middle Eastern food. Sometimes, you're in Old Town. If both of those things are simultaneously true, here you go. Otherwise, there's really no reason.",0.2183,0.852,0.079,0.069,0.39047619047619053

Another strange experience happened when I added a bottled water to my order...I started walking away and realized that I was not the original owner of said bottle-cap was broken and not my lipstick on it...At that point, I felt just a tad too close to another diner....",0.0356,0.834,0.079,0.087,0.410897435897436
