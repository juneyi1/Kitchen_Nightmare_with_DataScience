2017-07-06,3.0,"Are here during the ribfest just to grab a seat for a bit! Ordered three rolls and a cocktail. The drink was delicious. The sushi rolls were just ok and they added a $2 up charge to have them made with black rice. This seemed extremely high for a per roll upcharge on rice. Black rice typically gives a slightly nuttiness that seemed missing. The rolls themselves really lacked flavor and the wasabi wasn't very hot either. Our rolls came plated pretty boring. I even forgot to snap a photo. They were fresh tasting, just underwhelming.  The staff were friendly and the bathrooms were very clean. It was worth it to break out of the ribfest crowd and get a seat and a bathroom to use!",0.939,0.813,0.153,0.034,0.5520833333333333
2017-06-14,5.0,"My date recommended the place so we had dinner here. I thought I knew most of the restaurants/bars in Uptown, but I hadn't heard of Agami until a few days ago. It makes sense because it's nestled under the tracks on Broadway just south of Lawrence. Definitely a hidden gem in Uptown!! The Yelp description is fairly accurate as Lounge - Sushi bar/restaurant. As soon as you walk in you're met with a large bar which divides the space into Lounge/bar and restaurant/ sushi bar space. For appetizers we started with 4 of the Chef's Hamachi - yellowtail, jalapeno, microgreens and fresh wasabi served on wooden spoons. This was a light and tasty dish. We also ordered the Miso Pork Belly and Kimchee buns (2 in an order). The buns were great, aside from the warm kimchee (I prefer cold kimchee); nevertheless I'd order this again.  We shared some of the signature rolls, including Agami Volcano - soft shell crab roll with spicy tuna and snow crab rolled in black rice and flash fried (this was my favorite of the three rolls); Green Dragon - Tiger shrimp, snow crab, unagi, avocado, asparagus with green tea mayo, unagi sauce, and wasabi tobiko; Sweety Hamachi - spicy crab meat, spicy scallop, spicy shrimp with sweet egg and cilantro, topped with yellowtail, mango salsa, and yuzu soy sauce (this was my 2nd favorite, especially the mango salsa). For dessert we split the tempura fried ice cream, which was a sweet change of scenery from the savory, spicy, and salty rolls. Great service, friendly staff, and delicious food. I'll be back!!",0.9949,0.824,0.176,0.0,0.5391428571428571

We didn't have the highest hopes because this place looked flashy and the rolls looked covered in sauces which often takes away from the fish (or covers up lesser quality). But we were so impressed!! It was a pricey meal for us but we ordered a lot and it was totally worth it. The nigiri was fresh and flavorful, even the miso soup was better than many other places, the sweet potato roll was great and well balanced and the jalapeno spicy tuna and salmon avocado were fabulous.

2016-10-29,5.0,"I gave Agami 5 stars for good reason. Yelp reviews make it difficult to know whether the food is any good most of the time. People will review the bathrooms, the service, the atmosphere...whatever, then totally ignore a review on the food. Whereas most probably want to know about these things, please don't forget to review the food.  I gave Agami 5 stars to let readers of this review know their food is really good. Most reviews average four stars so how do you choose...you read the reviews! I ordered online and picked it up to eat at home. Most pick up food has a degree of quality that degrades from it being served hot at the restaurant.  I like my food spicy so I started with Spicy Miso soup. Soup was temperature hot and nicely spicy. Some miso soups can taste quite salty. This one was not and quite tasty. Next I had Spicy Green Bean, which is a combo of green beans and edamame and it rocked! Highly recommended. Then I tried the Chicago Bulls roll. Packaged well, there is a layer of deliciously cooked shrimp with a dab of guacamole over the sushi roll. The roll was really good as well, but I think it could use something crunchy in it. Just a personal preference. The restaurant looked nice too but alas, I did not eat there.

The sushi is melt in your mouth good,  and if you're not a sushi fan they have other options that will appeal to your inner foodie.   I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants a downtown feel without all the hustle and bustle.  Last, but not least.

I was seated at the bar at about 10pm on a friday night. Agami is open until 1am on Fridays and Saturdays. The service was pretty slow, but at least the staff was nice. I ordered a small hot sake, the nigiri combo and wakame salad. The food took awhile even though the restaurant was pretty empty. I guess I should have taken that as a sign. They served the miso which was lukewarm, but the entree salad and wakame was really good. Finally the nigiri combo arrived and I was ready to eat and get the hell out! The nigiri was not very good at all. The rice was crunchy and very acidic. Not a good balance of flavor or texture at all. The sake was good, but I was really not impressed with the freshness or flavor of the rest. Maybe this place is just meant to make super Americanized, saucy, deep fried rolls.

The crispy rice, tuna gone wild, and the jalapeno were all simply perfect. The latter should be called mule kick because of the spicy kick at the end that is surprisingly delicious. I also enjoyed the Tonkotsu garlic ramen with its rich broth and perfectly cooked pork.  Drinks such as lychee fizz were also spot on.

For apps, we had: the soft shell crab spring rolls, which were quite good, especially with that peanut butter ginger sauce; ahi tuna tango, interesting, light house (?) chips with a few layers to spread on top, which was GREAT, esp. the honey wasabi sauce; and the fried shumai (shrimp dumplings), which were quite good but felt small portion-wise. For sushi, we had the Tiger Turtle, good but not memorable, and the Dragon Holic, which was AMAZING. Finally, we stuffed ourselves with the green tea tempura ice cream, which comes looking like a tall sushi roll and is phenomenal. All of this plus my friends' 2 sakes (not a fan but they have a good sized list, plus cocktails etc.) came to $104 pre-tip. Overall, the decor is stellar and modern, atmosphere and service are great, food is fantastic, they offer free delivery on $50+, and it's pricey to me (coming from a cheap city) but not outlandish.

Again, all delicious.  Fatty salmon was my favorite. I liked the yellowtail more than the fatty yellowtail.  Next we tried red snapper sashimi and nigiri. Very good. Finally, we decided to throw in more tuna and salmon to round out the meal.   I recommend trying this spot out.  We will be back. Updating the review after a delivery order.  I was less satisfied with this recent order.  I love a balanced piece of sushi nigiri, with good rice, a little wasabi, the fish and soy sauce.

My go to sushi roll is the spicy tuna and their tuna was so chopped up it seemed more like a puree than tuna pieces so the texture really turned me off.

The host and our waiter were very nice, down-to-earth. Easy to talk to. I like kidding around with waiters and ours had a sense of humor. Now the food. We picked the Agami, Shrimp Tempura, and Dirty Old Man rolls, the Agami being their signature roll. Let's start with the regular Shrimp Tempura roll --- bigger than average (that's what she said), meaty (that's what she said), and great flavor coming from what I think is some wasabi-infused sauce. Amazing. Didn't expect a large portion for a somewhat cheap roll. Now onto the bigger rolls ---- Agami --- just. Get it. It's fried. Large. And sits on this amazing, sweet sauce. I'd literally just get that roll alone next time. (Didn't realize how filling their rolls were gonna be) Now the Dirty Old Man. It's fried salmon (I believe) and topped with yet another type of sweet sauce. Tasty. (I'm really bad with these descriptions but I'm telling you --- you're gonna like their food.)

The martinis are good, if a bit uninspired and basic. The sushi was good overall. We had the Chicago Bulls, Mini Godzilla, Shrimp Tempura, Fresh Scallop, and Yellowtail and Scallion. The Chicago Bulls was fantastic (though, at $17, you better not be anything else). The tiger shrimp on top was large, tasty, and not rubbery at all. I can't recall which, but two of the rolls had strong, overpowering flavors and textures, like biting into too much red onion. The sushi was still fresh and well put together, but the taste was off putting.  Being one of the most expensive sushi joints in town, and being in uptown (not a knock on uptown, it's simply not one of the pricier parts of town), I thought they had to do a lot more to even earn a fourth star.

I'd been looking over the menu on my morning break and had been fantasizing about the blue point roll all day. It sounded so delicious that I couldn't imagine it living up to the idea I'd built up in my mind. I figured I was setting myself up for disappointment but I was wrong. It surpassed my expectations. The topping of fried leeks was excellent. That salty, chewy, oniony component really enhanced the roll. The grilled scallops were cooked perfectly: just grilled and very rare. I could've eaten a whole plate of just the leeks and scallops. We also ordered the garlic delight roll. It comes out flaming which is really fun for everyone at the table even if someone doesn't eat any of it. It's hard to take a picture of but trust me it looks really cool. The roll itself was great. Sometimes gimmicky rolls lack flavor but not the garlic delight. It was perfectly garlicky and very nicely rolled.  To drink we had sake flights and they were pretty good. My only wish is that I could select my own sakes because I prefer drier ones than were on the flight. I get that the idea is to sample sakes then order more of the type you like but I still would prefer to pick my own. So why only four stars after a gushing review? Well, there are some issues. Our server was great but she seemed a little rushed. The place was busy but not packed. A little extra attention would've been nice. Also, the busboys are too fast. It's nice to have your plate cleared when you're done but just because the main part of the sushi is gone doesn't mean I'm finished. I like to pick at all the little bits that fell while I was eating. They snatched the plates before I could do that. So, for this very minor reason I am deducting one star.

2015-05-22,4.0,"Agami is a very cool restaurant, great for a date night. Many of the tables are high backed booth upholstered in red leather, making for a more intimate meal than the space might suggest. I had an excellent martini - The Fuji, and went for the sea bass which was fantastic. Perfectly cooked, and a nice portion. My wife had a vegetarian ""sushi"" platter and we split the dumplings and pork belly appetizers. Paired with a nice wine list, we had a very nice meal. The only off note was the dessert. I ordered the Apple Tempura - a deep fried apple with ice cream. It was okay but the apple was not really cooked. So it really just felt like a slightly warmed apple with ice cream. That's not a bad thing but it was just so-so. Still, we would definitely go back. And it is located right across the street from the Uptown Underground, a great new night spot on the north side.",0.9872,0.769,0.225,0.007,0.600343722943723
2015-05-20,4.0,"I've been here twice now, during my last two trips to Chicago. I've always been there somewhat early, like 5:30 or 6:00, and it's been fairly dead, so the service is pretty attentive. I can't speak for what it's like during busier times.  The sushi is really good. Very fresh, and nicely presented. We started with the Steamed Shumai, and took it down in short order. Yum! The Spicy Tuna Roll is the spiciest I've ever had (not a big fan of heat in my sushi), and I probably would not order it again there. The Jalapeño Spicy Tuna, surprisingly, was not as spicy as the Spicy Tuna, and I liked it better (especially with the addition of the crunch!). The Fatty Salmon nigiri was SO good, we ordered another round (even though we were pretty full). I could eat it every day.  I also really liked the Avocado Salad, but be warned - it is huge! I expected a teensy little plate with a smattering of been sprouts and a few avocado slices, but no, it is a meal in itself! Definitely for sharing. The drinks are great, and it's within walking distance of the Riviera and the Aragon, so it's super convenient for pre-show dining.",0.9875,0.758,0.207,0.035,0.570436507936508

Even better is the fact that my boyfriend, roommate and I could walk in on a Friday at 8 pm and be seated immediately. We always start with the house salad because their ginger dressing is amazing. The three of us split a bottle of wine and my roommate and I shared the sashimi 15 entree which was more than enough for the two of us. Sadly my boyfriend is allergic to fish, but he always loves every roll he gets here, usually containing crab (it's not imitation!) shrimp or scallop. The best part of the meal though was the uni... We each got a piece of uni sashimi and it didn't stay on the table long enough to get a picture. I would describe it more but there aren't any words I could use to say how good it is. The food here is worth 5 stars but the service is just okay--we were seated and greeted by our waiter promptly but he literally did not return to our table for 15 minutes to take our order and I know because I was hangry and started counting after he walked by at least 6 times without even looking at us as we tried to flag him down. He did look busy but a ""hey, little busy right now, sorry, be there in just a sec"" would've been okay. In the end I think he felt bad because he brought us fried ice cream on the house to share.

If I could give this restaurant ZERO STARS I would. Unfortunately, I'm forced to give them one which is two more than they deserve.  INITIAL REVIEW: Meh is overstating it. The rice was cold and dry. The fish was not that fresh. The service was meh. And a server basically yelled at one of the sushi chefs because he didn't understand that a customer wanted no orange slices. Try explaining it more clearly next time - I barely understood you and I speak perfect English.  They also clearly need a better system of expediting the dishes.  Putting a plate on the counter in front of diners at the sushi bar and then just waiting until a server eventually comes around and reaches over said diners just does not cut it.

Everything was good, tasted fresh but nothing was WOW. The Windy Chicago was actually kind of bland and really benefited from soy sauce. I was hoping for wow based on the reviews but just got good. I will say Yelp can probably remove one of the $ signs from Agami. Its $$ not $$$. In the end, with sake and an extra miso soup (their miso is really delicious), our bill was only around $60. I thought it was going to be near $100. I was quite happy about the price for the food we got.  I love sushi but don't frequent that many different locales in Chicago because once you find a good one, you stick with it. For us that is Tanoshii in Andersonville. It is definitely more expensive than Agami so it's not an every  weekend kind of place but their sushi is so much better than Agami and really makes you go wow. So all in all Agami was not bad and I would recommend trying it if you live nearby but I wanted to be much more impressed and can't help but compare it to Tanoshii.  Our waitress was really nice and service was pretty fast. The interior is a bit tacky with red and black everywhere but I don't really care about that.

We ordered beef asparagus rollups for an appetizer, which were fine.  We then ordered 2 rolls of their specialty list ($17 each, as were all the specialty rolls), and one $15 roll from the ""normal"" maki list.  I had a glass of wine and my husband had a beer.  Overall, the food was good.  Nice presentation, fish was fresh enough, and the roll combinations were more exciting than other places. We had a groupon good for $40, so our out-of-pocket cost that night was pretty lower for a dinner out; however, when I think about the total price of the meal (~$100 with tax and tip) for a few rolls, an app, and two drinks, I can't help but think it wasn't a good value.  I'm perfectly fine with spending $100 on a meal, but I don't think this was quite special enough to warrant.  With most of their rolls at $15 or above, I would have expected the freshest most unique fish, larger than average rolls, or something extra.  This place is good, just not sure it's worth the price.",0.9822,0.798,0.159,0.043,0.5225496031746032

Though the prices have gone WAY up. So it's still good sushi, though not as much as a 'find' as it was before. I used to go here 2 to 3 times per week (yes, I like sushi that much), now with the new prices, it's worth it to take the time to head elsewhere for less or a lesser place to get more...and be a bit more satisfied in the end given your bill won't be as high as when eating at Agami.

We had two rolls - the Green Dragon (shrimp, crab, eel, avocado, asparagus, green tea mayo) and the Tuna Sunset (tuna and salmon over spicy tuna and salmon).  Both were great, with very fresh fish.  Both also were distinctly unique to me, with a creativity in flavor that exceeded my expectations.  The Tuna Sunset was light and fresh, with a subtle spicy taste.  The Green Dragon was more unusual, almost sweet and creamy but in a good way.  Eel sauce is always a bit sweet, and the green tea mayo gave it the creamy texture.  It certainly wasn't a ""light"" roll but it was totally unque (different than any green dragon I've had before). That was all we could manage, still full from Thanksgiving!  I wish we'd had the room to try another roll as they all looked wonderful.  It is a bit pricey, but you get a romantic atmosphere, fresh fish, and creative concoctions!",0.999,0.739,0.253,0.008,0.5644847775175643

By the time our appetizer came out (yes, appetizer), it was after midnight and we had been there for three hours. We told them we wanted it to go and to just cancel the other plate that was supposedly coming. Another table nearby had done the same thing as we were all experiencing ridiculously slow service.  On the way out, we spoke to management about our experience. He basically said it was because it was a holiday.

2013-03-18,4.0,"Where do I even begin with Agami... I made reservations here on a Friday night for dinner with my girlfriend. We had both perused their website a few times and thought it might be a cool place to have a date. Here's what I thought: 1) Food: Between the two of us, we ordered the Agami Volcano roll, the Windy Chicago roll, and the Garlic Delight roll, all from the specialty rolls menu. They were all delicious, and for the price of each roll (~$16/roll) there was a lot of food to be shared, which is usually not the case at sushi restaurants.  The Garlic Delight roll was an especially cool entree. The roll itself comes on a plate that comes on top of another plate that has salt soaked with Bacardi 151 which is set on fire, and is delivered to the table this way. A really cool dish to look at, and a very delicious roll to enjoy. 2) Service: This is my only complaint about the restaurant. Fortunately service wasn't slow, but we had 2 different waiters throughout our dinner, which was a little confusing. This is basically what happened from the time we walked in through the front door, until we got our food:  First, we were greeted by the hostess who seated us immediately because of our reservation. Good. Second, a male waiter came a minute or two after we were seated to see if we'd like drinks or something to start off with. We told him we'd like a minute or two to look over the menu. He looked slightly confused, but said ""Sure!"", walked away, and didn't come back for so long that we had to ask a different waitress to take our order. This waitress provided good consistent service, and we wished we'd been served by her to begin with. Third, the waiter came back after we'd already placed our order and asked if we were ready. We explained that we had placed our order already, and he was confused. Again. Fourth, the waitress we had placed our order with served us our food.  Its possible that this kind of thing is rare at this restaurant, but it was still weird for me. HOWEVER, this is not to say that the service wasn't friendly! Both waiters were very welcoming, friendly, and nice! The waitress just happened to be more attentive than the waiter. 3) Atmosphere: This is the most confusing part about this restaurant. The physical location of the restaurant, interior, and exterior of Agami are all just fine. The place is clean, the bar looks pretty cool, all the tables were clean, and the food was good....BUT the place was near empty at 6:30 pm on a Friday night. When my girlfriend and I walked in, we were a little concerned, thinking maybe the food wasn't that great, but that wasn't the case either. Maybe it was just an off night, but after reading some other Yelp reviews, I think maybe Agami should work on their marketing to help bring more customers in.  Overall, I had a good experience, other than the little service hiccup, and I would definitely consider coming back.",0.9932,0.821,0.131,0.047,0.5195980542754735

My date and I went there on valentines day and had a reservation at 8:30. We arrived 15 min earlier in a nice booth. Here's what happened : - took them 15 minutes to realize we have not received water and that no waitress was assigned to our table. - finally received our water 10 minutes later and waitress took our order for wine, nothing more. - received our wine and waited another 20 min to get our soup + salad - once we were done with that we waited another 30 minutes before someone came and took our order for our appetizer and sushi rolls. - an hour later we are still waiting for our appetizer.... We walk over and have to find a waitress to ask where our food is. Manager ensures us we will get someone to see what the holdup is.  - half an hour later our undercooked calamari comes out. At this point we are both angry and annoyed that no one is helping us and so we get the manager who apologizes and tells us he will blame the kitchen for it. I don't care who gets the blame. Bottom line is it's been over 2 hours since we arrived and we have yet to see our food. The sushi finally came out and it DID taste good but at that point I was so frustrated I wanted to leave. We get the bill and they didn't even bother to take off the calamari. The poor waitress whose been running between a bunch of tables apologizes but we should have been taken care of a long time ago. Manager didn't know how to handle the situation and took off $20.  Like I said, this place had a lot of potential but I would never go back if I have to wait 2.5 hours for food.

Tips: - Until they start really picking up business, I'd eat rolls with cooked fish/meat in it instead of the raw. They may not be getting rid of their fish fast enough to keep a fresh turnover. - For larger parties, make reservations - Parking: Street and most of it you have to pay.

The only reason I can think of is because of location and price. Both are absolutely worth it. First of all, the ambience is enough for me. It is a spacious restaurant that is dimly lit but obvi still enough light to enjoy yaself. The interior decoration is bomb! From the outside you can only see a lot of red, which is romantic, but after going in you realize how effing awesome it really is.  Second. This is a place that focuses on food presentation and fish quality, you pay more, but you get a beautiful product, especially if he head chef makes it. The crazy roll hits my spot. Any Agami nigiri is off the chain delicious. The tuna tartar is gorgeous and tasty, as well as the spicy tuna rice crispy. The entree portions are enormous, and any kitchen appetizer is sure to wow. Nick the bartender is my favorite.  This is by far the coolest and not pretentious place to eat sushi on the north side. A perfect date place!!!

2012-07-29,4.0,"My wife and I love sushi (and a few of our first dates were for sushi). As we have started venturing into the fine dining arena over the past year, we decided to seek out a higher end sushi restaurant and see how it compared to the more vanilla venues we generally frequent. It seemed as though similarly named restaurant Arami was often proclaimed to have the best sushi in Chicago so we initially made reservations there; prior to our dinner we learned that their highly acclaimed sushi chef (B.K. Park) had abruptly resigned. We canceled our Arami reservation and I researched the Gayot listing of the Top 10 Chicago Sushi Restaurants:  gayot.com/restaurants/be…    I quickly weeded out the suburban restaurants and the restaurants that had less than a four star Yelp review and was left with a handful to choose from. I opted for Arami as they are fairly close to where I live and a good friend who's taste I trust had mentioned having some great meals here. When I learned they are affiliated with Savored (a service where if you reserve through them, you receive 30% of your bill) that sealed the deal:  svrd.co/pVNxyW Arami has an interesting, energetic ambiance. There is a massive bar in the middle with a couple of big screen TV's (the Olympics and the White Sox were on), red leather booths and fairly loud (but not overbearing) dance music. It had more of a vibe of a casual nightclub than a restaurant. They do need to expand the play list a bit as during the course of our meal the same Black Eyed Peas song repeated as well as Move Like Jagger. Our server William was very personable and friendly. There were a couple small lapses (i.e. a small delay in retrieving the bill and we were overcharged a bit on the gratuity - with Savored the restaurant is automatically supposed to add an 18% tip prior to calculating the discount, but we were charged about 22%), but he was good enough that I would request him again should I return. What I really appreciated was he cautioned us that we appeared to be ordering a tad too much (not too many servers do that). Even the busboy was quite friendly and attentive and inquired as to our opinions of some of the food.   The menu at Agami is massive with tons of rolls to choose from (many interesting options) there is a handful of non sushi related foods as well. It was so hard for us to narrow down our order to a manageable quantity since we were intrigued by so many of the rolls. The menu on their website will give you an idea, but the real menu has changed since the website was last updated. There is also a full bar with a handful of wines by the glasses, Saporro beer on tap and some seasonal cocktails. We shared a couple of appetizers - the Spicy Tuna Rice Crispy (rice fried in butter with tuna tartar and a sweet and spicy sauce) and the Spicy Ahi Tuna Tartar; the guacamole is freshly made for the latter appetizer and this dish was excellent. We also ordered five rolls (we should have listened to Williams' advice as the portions were large and we were unable to finish); the Green Turtle Roll was my favorite - cute presentation (it is plated to look like a turtle) and was quite tasty to boot. Finally I ordered a couple of the signature nigiri sushi items that were on the online menu, but not the menu at the restaurant; these feature single pieces or nigiri sushi with special sauces and accompaniments such as Zuke salmon with butter grilled enoki mushroom topping and a white truffle and olive oil sauce.  Despite being extremely full, their house made ice creams sounded appealing and the idea of a cool, soothing dessert after so much fish and rice seemed appealing.The portions were crazy huge (especially since my last few times having ice cream has been during tasting menus where the serving is golf ball sized); I received three large scoops (must have been over half a pint) of black sesame ice cream served a top a large fried wonton with fudge and caramel sauce drizzled as well as some  yam like substance underneath the wonton. The ice cream was decent, but nothing noteworthy and I was not even able to finish half.  Overall the quality of the food was definitely better than the more run-of-the-mill sushi venues I had been frequenting (i.e. Jaiyen, New Tokyo) but not a huge step better. The plating however was noticeably more attractive and the ambiance (while not necessarily more upscale), was definitely more thought out and energetic. With the Savored 30% discount we ended up paying $117 total which is not bad considering how much food we ordered (we each had an adult beverage as well). Another nice aspect of Agami that the owner of the restaurant actively works as one of the chefs and is intimately involved with the preparation of many of the dishes. We really enjoyed our dinner and it was nice dining at a sushi venue with character, but I do have to say that I would be surprised if this is as good as it gets when it comes to sushi.",0.9991,0.836,0.153,0.011,0.47794520459699025

Agami has amazing weekday specials during weekday evenings throughout most of the year - around 40 rolls all costing between $4-7 a roll.  I highly recommend their unigi tempura roll and lobster tempura roll (basically all their more unusual ""tempura"" rolls rock).  The rolls are usually 6 or 5 pieces, but the 5 piece rolls are quite generous in size.   My husband and I ordered 6 rolls from the special menu to share yesterday, and we could only eat about 2/3 of our order (note - I pack away a lot and have never had to take home sushi before).  The decor is swanky looking, but still comfortable.  I'm a big fan of the circular booths, which are almost always available on the weekday evenings because there are usually very few patrons (I'm not sure why considering the good reviews and fantastic deals).  The wait staff is quite friendly and provide attentive service.  Street parking immediately in front of the building is readily available unless there is a concert at the Aragon or Riv that evening.  And most importantly, you can have a tasty, filling meal along with a few drinks without breaking the bank.",0.9949,0.775,0.202,0.023,0.6028287638287639

We made a reservation, but didn't need to as we were one of about 10 tables in a restaurant that seats hundreds. Our table was a cozy booth, perfect for old friends to eat, drink and catch up. The food was amazing. There were a wide variety of rolls at prices ranging from $4-$20. The food was fresh and delicious. The atmosphere is fun and cool. although there are a few too many sex dungeon cliches (red pleather, fire and Ice). This makes Agami good for dates, not for parents visiting from out of town. The con was that the service was frustratingly slow, so slow that it put a cramp in what would have been a carefree dinner. We had to think strategically ahead about what to order because it took 20 mins for anything, including drinks, to come back to us. This would have been understandable if the restaurant was packed, but this wasn't the case. Thank goodness the bus boy realized what was happening and hurried things along or I think we would have been there all night.

I usually get take out and devour it at home in front of the television, but last night, we decided to dine in. Good choice. The decor is beautiful and lounge-y.  I ordered off of the Winter Specials menu and got the Crunch roll ($7), the sweet potato roll ($4) and the spicy blue crab roll ($6). I couldn't believe the amazing prices. I didn't love the blue crab roll, but the other two were delicious. My bf got the chicken teriyaki plate, which he liked. We both had salads which were actually stellar (not your basic salad w/ house dressing). After dinner, we decided to stay awhile and get the Fuji and the pomegranate (I forget the name) martinis, which were great.  But the food was only half of it - we were BLOWN away by the service. The staff was the main reason why we'll definitely dine in soon again. We were sitting and sipping our drinks when we noticed that the restaurant was emptying out - there was only one other group left besides us. The manager (I think?) walked by just to check on us and see how we were doing. I told him we were great, and then decided to ask what time they closed as he was walking away. He said...""Oh, we actually close at 11 on weeknights, but take your time.""  It was already 11:30! No mean side eyes from him or anyone else in the restaurant. We felt so bad, and tried to finish up quickly, but we still had more than half of our (huge) martinis left. Still, everyone was extremely pleasant.

Where else can you go and eat sushi inside of a giant aquarium-slash-lounge in Chicago?  Agami is a big place.  There are lots of seating items - huge round red booths for the ballar experience, a 30-foot sushi bar, regular tables, and a nice bar area. The whole place is alive with colors, textures and shapes, so it's a pleasure to be there.  The big screens at the bar area allow you to catch the game.  They're open pretty late, too - no matter when I've gone I've been seated right away.  However, on nights when the theater is open, parking is a pain in the butt.  There are lots of menu items so those who are sushi-phobes can find something decent to eat.  If you're eating the fish, which you should be, the presentations at Agami are absolutely lovely.  The descriptions of the rolls are good.  There's usually a lot going on in every roll - it would burn the eyebrows off a sushi traditionalist.  The quality of the fish is OK.  Not great - but when you dress it up and present it the way Agami does, it's not bad.  The nigiri pieces are HUGE.  Again, not the best fish ever, but solid.  The o-toro is usually very tasty, but often tough.  But I'll still eat it!

After passing this restaurant for years from going to the Riviera or the Aragon, I finally went here last Saturday for a friend's surprise birthday.  They sat us at a nice booth that was hidden so that my friend wouldn't see us right when we walked in.  The server was really nice checking in on us ever so often and are waters were also filled. The server also spilled a little bit of beer not on anyone I believed but she came back with some saki for everyone so that deserves a star for customer service. The creative rolls were deliciousssss!!!!!!!! My favorite was the white dragon, super white tuna over shrimp tempura. Yum Yum yum. Not too much breading and a good crunch from the tempura.  I also liked the california sunset: fresh salmon over snow crab, avocado, and cucumber. V. delicious. The classics like the boston, phili, and california crunch were also good. I didn't have too much of a problem finding parking and this was a Saturday night at 730.  My only downside was price. We ordered a lot of rolls but the bill was $40 per person. That's what I get for ordering the white dragon and california sunset which were $14 EACH. The other downside is that they don't split the bill and they only take 3 credit cards to split from. That's good the organizer warned us of this and we all brought cash. The sushi is really good though so I'll definitely return. With 16 specialty rolls on the menu, I gotta try some more!",0.9959,0.755,0.21,0.035,0.5681855500821016

2010-12-08,4.0,"Sexy. It's not an adjective you usually use to describe establishments in Uptown... until you walk into Agami. The dashingly unique interior would be right at home on South Beach or in Soho, but its location next to the El tracks on north Broadway make this high-end sushi spot a curious diamond in the Uptown rough. Tall red booths line the walls, cozy little nooks make you feel like you're on your own little world and the dark, hazy bar in the middle of the round dining room complements the glow of fresh fish from the sushi bar. And then comes the sushi. Unique flavors and crafty construction make the fish here - though not the best ever I've ever had - certainly on par with such overbooked mainstays as Coast or Tank. A smallish menu of maki and nigiri make it a great place for beginners, but the specialty and signature lists offer a wide range of unique tastes for experts as well (try taking the Fire roll for a burn). Apps are awesome as well. We had the braised king crab leg with golden sauce which was amazing. We could have eaten ten more of that alone. The price point is pretty high, especially for Uptown. But when you factor in the quality and ambiance, it really is on par with other high-end joints. The good news is that Agami has a great selection of daily specials, which makes it easy to fill up without thinning out your wallet. By far the best day is Sunday, when all kitchen apps and specialty and signature maki are half off (and you can get a large hot sake for only $5). It's a great time to go on a sampling bonanza, so that you can know what to focus in on when you come back for a snazzier date night. Overall, great spot and definitely worth a try. With so few really amazing restaurants still available on the far north Broadway corridor, we all need to do our part to keep the real gems going strong.

2010-11-03,4.0,"I have been going to Agami for several years now.  I've seen them grow to be the very stylish and posh sushi lounge/bar that they are now.  I remember back when, I think it was in 2005, they didn't even have their liquor license yet since they had just opened.  That's how long ago it was, wow! I found out about Agami through a friend of mine and I've been hooked! I only knocked one star down because of the price and parking.  I only go to Agami as some sort of treat for myself or if my friends and I are feel like eating some gourmet sushi, especially gourmet sushi.   I am in love with two of their specialty maki.  ""Caterpillar (avocado over snow crab topped with black and red tobiko)"" and ""Crunchy melt (shrimp tempura, tempura crunch & cream cheese,baked with mozzarella)"".  These two are my go-to rolls.  They are not the most expensive on the menu but definitely not the cheapest either.  Nevertheless, it is just always delish! I came across their new specials which I was really excited about.  It was a Tuesday and the waiter just informed me about some special they were having for Tuesdays.  It was a 4-course pre-fixed meal for only $29.  I jumped on that deal and said yes before he could even say, ""Would you like that?"" Normally, $30 is what I would spend for two specialty maki.  But to get a 4-course meal for that same price, all I can say is when can I go again? LOL!  Parking, as I said, can be quite difficult.  There are only so many cars that can park right in front of the restaurant, on Broadway.  There is a parking lot across the street, but you have to pay close to $20, I believe, which is definitely not a price I'm willing to pay just for parking in uptown.  For a cheaper alternative, you can go around the block and look for parking close to the residential areas which is not that far of a walk from the restaurant.

Last time I was here my friend and I indulged a little and spent over $120 between us, not counting tip. I thought it mostly worth it though cuz both Signature Makis (Golden Lobster and Broadway) I ordered were exceptionally exquisite. Even my Blackened Seared Tuna appetizer alone was to die for. I have a habit of ordering a little too much but usually half will be 'take home'. Only a little under a third made it home this time & what did didn't last till the next day. I know ""fat ass""..but it was just too good. (^.^,) The only gripe I had was the $11 martini that was at best just plain bad. My friend's was just as awful and blah. I mean if you're charging double digits per drink I would expect flavors that were interesting and worked well together, not watered alcohol with fruit plopped in. I've had WAY better at half the price and half the wait time. So skip the over priced but underwhelming ""specialty martinis"".

The decor was definitely trying for New York cool.  The music was good, nice and laid back.  Not so loud you can't hear your date utter a word. As slow as they were, it took a few minutes for our server to come to the table.  The only think I can attribute that to was he was the only one on this side of the restaurant.  Once he did come to the table, he was very nice and attentive. We ordered the edamame which was great.  I had the King Kong roll, which was ok.  I've definitely had better rolls elsewhere.  My boyfriend had some chicken dish which he said was good.  Believe me, if he says it's good it must be; because he is Incredibly picky.   Overall, I don't think I'd go out of my way to dine here again.  It wasn't a horrible experience by any means, just not great.  Plus our bill was $80 (with tip) for 3 drinks, 2 dishes and 1 appetizer.  A bit pricey in my opinion.",0.9885,0.807,0.184,0.009,0.6108585858585858

The restaurant's response was that they use ""real"" snow crab, not imitation, and maybe we weren't used to it! Kind of insulting to someone who's eaten sushi (and snow crab) all over the US. and in Tokyo. Agami is officially OFF my list of favorite sushi spots, which is unfortunate considering I live in the neighborhood.

My companion said he felt as though he was dining inside a sushi roll. I didn't really get that vibe, but I did enjoy the design, particularly the nice red booths with cool lamps - though not the emptiness of the place, nor its location uptown. - My friend and I like to walk and decided to walk here from his apartment near boys town. What a depressing walk, indeed. I know it isn't fair to let this and the emptiness of the place color my impression, but it did. As far as the other stuff: The sake was enjoyable and not too sweet.  The miso soup was strange, having an almost cabbage-like flavor, which for someone who likes cabbage - is not a bad thing. Plenty of seaweed and tofu.  The spicy tuna app was interesting (i didnt care for the crisp rice which stuck to my teeth) but the tuna in an of itself as well as the sauce had a great flavor. You can't really go wrong with pureed tuna and jalapenos.  The crab cake app was sweet and my friend really enjoyed it. I thought it was overly breaded and fried a bit too long, and seemed to rely too heavily on herbs over quality. But even typing that I realize it is decidedly a 'to each his own' scenario. Fire roll - yes it is served with some kind of flaming liquid below the actual plate that arrives on fire. I had asked them to add jalapenos to the roll but instead they brought them on the side. This roll was sweet while semi spicy, warm and creamy (and oh so good for you) - it was what you would assume it would be. I was hoping the roll itself was going to come on fire. Call me crazy ;) Both of the white wines by the glass are good - ""the novelist"" is a nice refreshment when eating the fire roll, as it is not too citrusy and compliments the hearty sushi.  Uni - strong flavor and sweet with the perfect amount of oceanic aftertaste. Green tea ice cream - rather hard (must have been frozen) but had a good, strong tea favor. Not quite sure about the potato puree here. So there you go. Decent sushi and drinks. But that can be found at so many places in Chi, I dont see the point in venturing here unless you live in the area. adding some pix now",0.9979,0.684,0.228,0.088,0.6030671296296298

They are a little pricey but I have found even their less expensive rolls are a little bit better than what I've found at Tank (the other sushi place I frequent)  They have a large sake list but I don't drink sake so YMMV with how much you enjoy it.  On my last visit I ordered a Filet Mignon Spring Roll appetizer, a Crazy roll and a California roll. All were delicious although the sushi came out before the appetizer. I'm assuming it was because it was steak.  The bar is a usually empty and the prices are a little high so I'm assuming people only go to the bar when the restaurant is crowded.  It's a darker sleeker place that is one of the newer places to pop up on that section of Broadway.  The area directly south of there is SKETCHY as hell but it is Uptown so that's typically how it goes. One road is ok then next block you are witnessing someone buy crack. Just keep your eyes open.

The presentation of the nigiri and the rolls is invariably lovely, I'm delighted that they include crayfish among their (cooked) shellfish options, they do great things with octopus, and the martinis are excellent. The only reason this is four stars instead of five is the failure to have soy-based soy, and the inclusion of wheat-based soy in seemingly all of their spicy dressings. Which can prove limiting, especially with as delightful a menu as they have on tap, but again, the unstinting consideration of the waitstaff deserves high marks, and the real roadblock to an even higher ranking to my way of thinking is responsiveness on providing the genuine ingredient instead of the cheap stuff when it comes to soy.",0.9577,0.847,0.141,0.012,0.6938888888888888

2009-07-26,4.0,"If this place wasn't in Uptown and were a bit cheaper, I would go here all the time! This was my first time at Agami and I was definitely impressed. I am going to compare it to Sushi Wabi, since it is kind of on the same lines... trendy, contemporary, pricey, and fresh sushi... and I was just at Sushi Wabi so I remember it. I would have to say that Agami beats out Sushi Wabi in my eyes. They have a way bigger menu or rolls AND they are more creative. Plus, the place is huge and there was no wait for a table.  So let's talk about where it is. It is up in Uptown, not in the best area, right by the Border's. There isn't much around Agami, but you can definitely make it a night out and head to the Green Mill afterwards as it is only a block or so away. The interior of Agami is very modern looking and trendy-ish... but we were there on a Friday evening and it was pretty empty. My friend, who has been there multiple times, said that it picks up later in the evening. Maybe that was the case. I would say that it was a nice atmosphere where you can really enjoy your company. We also did get to sit in a nice big round booth.  Now onto the drinks. Their fruity martinis are yummy. Tastes like juice. I had the pear one... twice. Didn't even know there was alcohol in it... until later! But I tried a couple other ones that were good: the Saketini and something with Cranberry juice in it (The Agami one was a tad too sweet for me, though.) They are $12 a drink so be careful how many you order! Of course, we ordered multiple rolls and just wanted to try everything. There were some we really liked and some that were just ok. The really good ones were the Turtle Roll, the Ocean's Drive Roll and the Totoro Kani. Now, we made the mistake of ordering all the really expensive (signature) rolls... $16-17 each. Next time, I would definitely mix it up with some regular rolls so it is not an extravagant bill. We also ordered a couple of apps... and my favorite thing of the whole night was the spicy tuna crispy rice appetizer. So good! Definitely worth trying!  I would highly recommend trying Agami out. They also have certain specials during the week that are worth checking out.

Our booth was behind the glass-enclosed sushi counter, so we got an up-close look at all those yummy fresh ingredients and the sushi chefs' amazing skills, without compromising the intimacy.  And the sushi: top, top.  We had the rainbow roll, the caterpillar roll, and the soft shell crab roll.  All were beautifully presented, the fish wonderfully fresh, and the accompanying sauces delicious.  I would definitely go back to try more of the maki rolls on their menu.  There are tons of really different and inventive rolls. As for drinks, there are lots of fun martinis and a fairly large wine selection, but we stuck with beer this time around.  I'll definitely be back to try a few of those martinis!  For dessert we had the chocolate banana maki, which was basically a frozen chocolate covered banana with ice cream.  I was expecting something a bit more inventive, but still very tasty nonetheless. I was a little concerned at the lack of patrons at prime dinnertime Friday night, but perhaps it was the cold that was keeping people away.  This is the perfect date spot and a stellar sushi dining experience, so I'd hate to see this place close on us!  Meter parking is plentiful, plus the bank parking lot across the street, and it's steps from the red line.

Sake bottle is empty.. its time to reload!?  Yet, he forgets the reload and the important things, like sushi, maki, soy sauce.  What is the deal?  The bartender, was singing to himself out loud.  Clearly dude was drunk and high.  He needed to be leashed.  Yet, manager is sitting there looking at him crazily not saying a word.   At one point the look on everyones face is what epitomized that outing.  Everyone shared the same distaste in service.  The WTF?! is taking so long look.  Appetizers came separately and arrived 25 full minutes after ordering.  Sushi and maki dragged almost an additional 30 minutes after the appetizers and 20 minutes each per serving.  My two previous times were spent in a constant state of glee with numerous sushi and sake orders going out spending a couple hundred dollars like I won the lottery.  (We still are not downtown yet, it doesn't need to be this expensive, btw) This time we hardly spent any money.  I wanted to get the fuck out of there as soon as possible.   When you've already realized that you're hating your time there, no matter how good the food is, the event is wasted.   What compounded the horror, was that this was supposed to be an awesome birthday dinner. Memorable mention:  A flaming maki and the marinated beef appetizer.  Maki was served atop a dish of Bacardi 151 on fire, caramelizing the sauces.  Marinated beef was alike a few slices of Kalbi(Korean BBQ) marinated in a sweet (fruity blended) concoction of glaze.  $15? too much, taste was good, amount dire.",0.9806,0.774,0.135,0.091,0.461919642857143
2008-05-04,4.0,"We were so happy to find this place! Good to great sushi walking distance from home. A little dangerous and tempting, perhaps, but after some serious jonsing for good sushi, this place was like an oasis in the desert. The fish here is clean, had a lovely texture, and was just great quality. Standards of hamachi and fresh salmon were great, and we even liked the uni there. If the uni is good, you know they have good fish. The uni was creamy and just a little funky (and I mean that in a good way), with a hint of bitterness. Delicious (if you're into it. I know it's not for everyone).  The rolls are nice, too. Spicy tuna of course, very good. I would stay away from the soft shell crab roll. It wasn't bad, but is wasn't great. The scallop roll was quite tasty. The specialty rolls are a little pricey, and you can have a perfectly enjoyable and less expensive meal sticking with the standards. Also, the wasabi could be a little stronger. The wait staff is very friendly and helpful. Nice people there. The overall ambiance of the place is not exactly my cup of tea. Industrial decor, big screen TVs, it smacks of a hipster sports bar, which on a crowded evening would be loud. But its clean and open and perfectly pleasant. We have been going on weeknights, which has been very pleasant and quiet. I'm sure that on the weekends this place is overrun with the tragically hip, so if you like that in big crowds, go on a Friday or Saturday night.

We started with the Super White Tuna Carpaccio which was fairly good and enhanced with chili oil.  I've had better, but it was a fairly impressive start.  The Ocean Drive maki was fairly creative (triangle shaped), but nothing too special.  But the Fire Maki (as recommended by other Yelpers) was fantastic... not only the presentation, but the pieces virtually melted in my mouth and had exceptional flavor. Unfortunatley, it went downhill from here.  We tried all the Signature Nigiri selections, and while the preparations were interesting and pieces of fish large, the flavors were fairly subtle and the fish didn't blow either of us away (i.e. no melt in your mouth feel).  I've been especially impressed with the creative Nigiri selections at Kaze, and these simply didn't stack up.  Service was decent, but my water glass sat empty for too long.

It's always nice to have a treat for a eyes while you order a treat for your belly. A friend and I were seated in a private booth behind the sushi bar. These seats let you have the option of having more privacy with drapes that hide you... but I like to leave them open and enjoy the art of sushi being made.

2008-03-12,4.0,"A typical trip to Agami -for me- goes something like this- Enter- have a seat at the bar and take a look around (always early, I hate to be late).  Enjoy a Pear martini made with Grey goose, pear juice and lime juice- extremely potent and pleasing. Or- have a nice glass of red wine, waiting for the rest of my friends to join.  Chat with the friendly bartenders and try not to play -too much- with the bar stools that move up and down, depending on how you sit (kind of like a hairstylists chair without the back pump), making sure NOT to hook my heels on the rim (nope, not going into that here...).  Ponder the choice of red and black and then really wonder if the aquarium theme was meant to be carried into the front room.  Remind myself that- the drink is good- but only one is allowed before everyone else is present! Pay bar tab (12$ per martini- and between 8-10 for wine, depending, especially if someone else arrives early and joins me for a drink) and proceed to table. Dinner- The Sushi is fantastic. the spicy tuna rice- crispy, and soft shell crab rolls are always a hit.  The crab cakes are mighty good too.  The California crunch rolls, spicy tuna jalapeno, and crazy rolls are other treats not to be missed.  If you are looking for more than just sushi- try the Ahi tuna steak- I highly recommend it.  Enjoy another cocktail or two- or go for some Sapporo.  At this point in the evening, I always find myself wondering the following:  how did I get sooo full? -how did I get this buzzed?  - do I really have to go home now?  Who wants to go out?  Wow!  This place feels like an aquarium- especially the back room.  Remember- the walls are curved- it is not you!  You can only wash your hands outside the bathroom door- the sink is not hidden (I ALWAYS forget this and go on a sink quest). Sweet Tooth?-If you indulge in desserts- they have an unusual selection.  After a meal like I always end up with here, the possibility of eating a full one is not an option, but are you getting one? Can I have a bite?    The staff is always exceptional.  Last time I was here, I changed our reservation 4 times to accommodate some yelper's schedules.  They had no problems with it.  Agami does rank with the top sushi places  and the fact that it is close to my hood makes it even better!

The Miso soup was also delicious I just wish it came in a little bigger bowl.  It was so good and when I reached the end of the bowl I was still wanting more.

Oh and actually I think I'm gonna give it 4.5 stars.  They brought us out a lovely appetizer...on the house...and even though I didn't eat it (to spicy for me) I heard it was delicious.  Also our desserts were on the house as well!  Oh hell that's a lot of free stuff!",0.9923,0.727,0.189,0.085,0.4963068181818183

BUT, you are going there for the sushi folks!   The decor is also quite unique and fun.  As is the music...a lot of awesome retro 80s and 90s tunes makes it fun and unexpected in a sushi joint!  If you want a romantic and secluded area to dine, there are also some neat little booths behind the sushi bar that are cozy and actually have curtains that (I think) you could actually close for privacy.  And if you are in one of those booths behind the sushi bar you can still watch the sushi chefs create from behind which is kind of neat as the back of the sushi bar is a clear (plexi?)glass wall.  I go well out of my way to get rolls from here all the time.  My only complaint would be a) no delivery!

I tried my three favorite rolls, the California, a spicy crab and a Dragon roll. The first two were amazing, but I have to say, I was disappointed in the Dragon. It wasn't that it wasn't fresh, it was just that something was...off. It wasn't as good as others I've had elsewhere.

2007-10-19,4.0,This is one of my favorite sushi places. My standards are a bit high because I like the authentic Sushi places in NY where you can get huge slices of high quality fresh sashimi.  The rolls at Agami are inventive and well presented. One of my biggest pet peeves are rolls that are overly filled with rice. I like delicate pieces that fit completely in your mouth otherwise it just falls apart and makes a mess. Agami does a good job of this. The martinis are refreshing and not overly sweet.  I really like this place. I wish it were closer to me. I live in the S. Loop.,0.9553,0.737,0.222,0.042,0.6444117647058825

The interior is very kitchy with some interesting sculptures around the bar and seating areas.  The wine rack behind the bar is pretty cool, too.  We're not bar people, but I do like an interesting setting.  Very artistic! As for our meal, all I can say is YUM YUM YUM!!!  The food was fanyumtastic!  My s-o is not a real sushi fan, but there were so many different things on the menu, he was thrilled he could actually eat something cooked!  We tried the Black Dragon, Green Turtle, the Mini Godzilla and a few other traditional maki and nigiri sushi and every bite was heaven!   Price was about what we expected.  We were filled up and each had a drink, so the bill came to about $65.  Not bad for a meal pour deux for this sushi hound! It was a weeknight and there weren't many customers so I was surprised the service was a bit slow - we sat down right before a family of five and were served way after them, even though we'd ordered before they did.  I don't know if it was what we ordered or the kitchen was slow in sending out our plates.  Other than that, I had no complaints.

We didn't have drinks, but their sake list is HUGE. We had fun just looking at all of the different kinds! I order the Ahi Tuna Steak over sauteed veggies and mash with garlic butter sauce...it was DIVINE. Melted in my mouth,flavorful, veggies were still a bit crunchy, but tender (not soggy). It came with miso soup and a great salad (green lettuce and spinach) and a lovely sesame dressing). My date had several interesting maki rolls that he raved about, including one topped with salmon and sesame sauce.  It's a bit pricier than my favorite ""mom and pop"" joint Bentonara, but its got some killer ambience for a chill night out, adequate seating for large groups, and an all around great vibe.

I will admit the decor was interesting...super mod, creative--a definite change for Uptown.  But the visual experience was soon displaced by the olfactory experience: the place smelled of formaldehyde or ammonia.  Not at all appetizing, especially when anticipating fresh sushi.   The nigiri were not very good at all:  we had the sweet shrimp, which was not only overpowered by the garlic butter sauce, but definately tasted ""off.""  The ""Big Eye"" tuna pieces were overly fishy tasting, and not at all appetizing.  Only the larger white fish nigiri were somewhat redeeming, although we did not order one of the two pieces that came and were still charged for it. We ordered three rolls: a jalepeno spicy tuna roll, which was the best of the three, with some serious heat.  But it fell vicitm to the same problem that plagued all our maki:  soggy, stale tempura coating.  The ""crunchy"" roll should have been simple and delicious: tempura crumb-coated rolls of spicy scallop; but the scallops were terrible--and it was anything but ""crunchy""!  Fishy again, and not very fresh.  Finally we had the pricier ""signature"" Millenium maki, made with tempura asparagus, but the ingredients must have been prepared much ealrier and left to sit, resulting in a stale, mushy, completely unimpressive $16 roll.

2006-12-30,1.0,"We had been wanting to try Agami for a while, and let's just say we were severely underwhelmed.  The place is huge... and someone definitely put thought and energy into the overall look and feel of the place, sort of like sitting in a giant S&M Aquarium (lots of red leather and faux coral walls with the occasional sports game projected onto semi-transparent partition behind the bar).  Strangely, even with the size of the place, it had a faint scent of ammonia when we walked in the door, which hopefully was cleaning product related and NOT rotting fish.   Food-wise, the menu looks impressive with plenty of creative maki and interesting nigiri preparations, but actual execution wasn't so great.  The tempura  crumbs (on two of our three rolls) were old and soft, leaving our Crunch Maki more Mush Maki.  Same goes for the tempura shrimp and asparagus in the Millennium Roll... these must have been fried up MUCH earlier in the day.  The scallops in the Crunch Maki were fishy, and the big eye tuna nigiri was gag-inducing.  Only one of the rolls and one of the nigiri were decent.   On the service front, even that's slightly off... our server had mistakenly brought us one wrong nigiri item.  Not a big deal, except he charged us for the wrong piece + the correction.  Not a pricey piece, but still something an aware server doesn't do... ever.  If your bartender brings you a bloody mary when you ask for a G&T, you don't pay for both.
