2017-04-10,3.0,"My three friends and I came here on Saturday at noon without a reservation. We were seated promptly, but that is when things started to go downhill. I would give the value and food 4-5 stars, but the service just brought down the ratings for me.  My friends and I ordered about eleven different things, and had to repeatedly ask the waitress for water and tea and condiments. They had Pu Er, Oolong, chrysanthemum, or green tea available so I was impressed with the choices though. The waitress didn't say anything upon taking our order, but returned to tell us twenty minutes after we ordered that they were out of three things: roast duck, egg custard buns, and chicken feet. The fact it was still early on Saturday lunch and they were already out of these items as a dim sum restaurant was a bit concerning , but even worse was the amount of time that went by without us being notified. Then, the food started coming out slowly- one or two items at a time, every five minutes. This made it difficult to eat  because we would finish a bamboo steamer's worth of food, then awkwardly wait for the next item to arrive. This also made it a longer lunch. Onto the value and the actual food itself: we loved the sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves, the Shumai, the fried chicken dumpling, and the preserved pork and salted egg congee. Definitely skip out on the pork belly- which we got to substitute the roast duck we originally ordered but they were out of. The roast pork belly was too fatty, but it was also cold, thick, and tough and gelatinous. Also skip out on the stuffed eggplant- it was too greasy despite the pork filling tasting yummy. Our party of four spent $44 including tax (but not tip). See itemized breakdown.

I ordered shrimp crepes (came devoid of any sauce!), pork spare ribs in black bean sauce (bland and greasy), shrimp dumplings (tasted ok but was lukewarm in temperature), fried bean curd rolls (over cooked and dry), and fried dough balls with minced meat (too much dough to meat ratio).

2016-01-23,3.0,"A bit of a mixed experience for me... it's kind of interesting because the food is a little above average but there's different factors that prevent this restaurant from getting an additional star for me.  To start off with the good factors, I went earlier in the morning when they weren't too busy so I was able to experience a meal with excellent food temperatures and receive excellent service. The seating was pretty comfortable with a nice modern decor (although, the mix of colors and furniture choices prevent it from getting marks for decor from me). The hours are surprisingly long with a huge menu. Now for the not so positive aspects -- Much of the food did have good textures but was pretty bland overall. There were some that were done comparably well to some of the best dim sum restaurants in Chinatown, however there was also a lot of inconsistency in the quality between dishes and nothing really felt very premium about any of the dishes (although the price was pretty low overall). None of the dishes were particularly memorable for me. They didn't have the flavor complexity or texture variety that would've made them really stand out but several dishes were executed a bit better than others: Baked egg custard bun -- Very nicely prepared dough and aromatic custard. Beef & Cilantro rice roll - great texture on the rice roll (nice and elastic, slightly chewy) Stuffed eggplant - Very tender eggplant, nice flavor with the shrimp filling Congee with beef - Does need a bit of salt and maybe pepper (and even some soy sauce), but the texture of the congee itself is very good and the beef is tender (which goes well with the small bits of ginger). Zhong Shan Style dumplings - what really stands out here is the skin which is a bit thicker than what you'd typically find on a dumpling but is actually surprisingly soft and chewy. Creamy egg yolk ball -- Could really use more egg yolk but this is fried very nicely and contains sweet glutinous rice that is very soft and chewy Steamed pork patty /w preserved vegetable - done better than a lot of other restaurants in Chinatown since the pork is a bit more fatty but also slightly on the salty side. Overall, although there are several dishes that were enjoyable -- they were really better executed versions of the common food you'd find in Chinatown. There were also items such as the fish roe steamed dumpling and steamed beef ball that were below average. With this considered, China Cafe is a restaurant capable of breaking away from the pack to get 4 or 5 stars, but mixing some very nice elements of food and decor with poor ones really limit it from scoring any higher, even with the lower prices considered. With a few tweaks though, this restaurant could really change its identity and build a strong brand based on quality. First, renovate the restaurant to be consistent with the attractive modern look everywhere (it's like 60% there). Second, reduce the size of the enormous menu and focus on the dishes that can be executed well (a few poor to mediocre dishes can really ruin the good experience of the rest).",0.9988,0.747,0.212,0.041,0.5043829864914203

I don't  often eat at Chinatown, but this place is definitely worth the visit. Upon my first visit food was served very slow espically dim sum. I revisited with my family the waiter greeted us immediately  and  asked us if we needed any refreshment. We ordered dim sum and this time it was much faster and it was packed also so that was suprising. The food was served to us in about 10min.  This resturant have alot of food ranging from appetizer   to deserts. My favorite experience with this place was probably  the walnut  bun due to it being the only resturant that is serving it atm. It  has a layer of sugar inside the bun which enrichen the overall flavor of the bun which also includes a walnut inside due to it being known as the walnut bun. My second fav dish was what the ""rose chicken "" the chicken was baked and the skin is crispy and munchy. The sauce  was something I had never tried and was somewhat salty but it correspond and match with the chicken. Only weakness to this resturant is the lack of beverage due to it having only soda instead of milk tea and smoothies bc I think it will be attracting more customer if it had more variety of drinks.

2015-07-05,1.0,"Not really the type to write reviews on restaurants but this place blew my mind today.  I only been in this restaurant twice somewhat 20 years ago and it was alright. Went here July 5th night looking for a quick snack at around 10pm and ordered #253 Jellyfish with Vinegar, Lean Pork with Preserved Duck Egg Congee, and 4 items from the dim sum menu (chicken feet, fried pork skin tofu roll?, shrimp dumpling, and beef tripe). btw, it was kind of bogus that their DIm Sum Everyday is not the whole dim sum menu at night time; only items 1-20. The place wasn't really packed with about 5 tables max any time and there were 2 adults and 4-5 teenagers catering to customers with a not enjoyable expression on their face.  One of the teenagers came to take our orders and he does not seem to know anything about the dishes when we inquired what was its ingredients.  Waiters should wait on customers and busboys should be busboys just cleaning up as people finish.  However, it wasn't like that and the operations seems hectic.  The busboys do not know what table to bring the food to.  They mistakenly took one dish to our table and others were walking about back and forth with the dish in their hands.  All of the dishes was being brought out one by one on the circular trays which is a waste of time.  Saw one instance where one of the teenagers asked another teenage to take the top off the clay pot for them when it was still on the circular tray which they could have done that after putting the clay pot on the table.  Anyways, continuing on, our first 2 dishes came out in about 10 minutes and it was the jellyfish and congee. thought it was weird it wasn't the dim sum first.  20-30 minutes later, our dim sum was still not out yet.  the waiters and teenagers came to our table to check the order list a couple of times.  overheard them talking that they did not write it down for the chef to make and they did not inform us. would have just left right then and forget about the dim sum items if I know.  I have been for for 40 minutes already.  as we waited, noticed the atmosphere of the restaurant is noisy even when not packed and noticed that they cater to young people and family. this place is trying hard to be the newest late night eating place but i don't think it will work.  they either need to be a cafe or family style restaurant.  and they also try to be a all in one place with a bbq area up front. one instance i saw 3 of the teenagers serving one table at once. they were also out of ingredients for dishes and heard a table complained that they never ordered one of the dishes on their list. one of the ingredients for my dish was the jellyfish. I assumed the dish used the head part but they were out so they used the body.  I am not sure if the head suppose to be more expensive then the body but the price on the receipt was the same.  when I asked for the check to pay, the waiter forgot to add tax to it. While leaving, saw the other waiter working in the bbq area chopping meat.  whoever the owner is, they need to get more experienced staff or do a better job training.  the current business model is a complete failure and from the reviews since the renovation, it seems like I am not only one that feels like this. i have worked in a restaurant in chinatown for 2 years so I know what i am talking about. I know it is only been two and a half weeks since the grand opening but i for sure am not going to eat at this place again.  wish you luck in your business as i don't it to stay open that long Update:  Seems like this restaurant is worser than i thought.  my credit card transaction was processed for the dinner.  seems like they just charged the subtotal amount which does not include the tips.  the employees working there not going to be happy",-0.9479,0.89,0.041,0.069,0.512547619047619

Good amount of filling in the steamed bbq pork buns, which were the same flavor as bakeries back in nyc flushing. shumai was just ok. eggplant stuffed with shrimp was awkward to eat and kind of greasy so not that good. Chicken feet was just ok. they don't offer spare ribs or shanghai soup buns for dim sum so be aware of that.

Even prior to entering the restaurant, they reminded us that in China people choose where to eat based on the quality of the food alone, and that cleanliness and ambience are secondary. I thought, well, fine, I'm craving dim sum and am sure I won't even notice whether I'm eating at the majestic Forbidden City or at a sewer chamber. Boy, was I wrong. Upon entering China Cafe my wife and I couldn't help but to feel disgusted with the place. This is one of the dirtiest places I've ever been to in my life.

As soon as my partner and I arrived at the table, we noticed our chopsticks and plates were dirty, and the table was sticky.  We had dim sum there, as well as noodles. Aside from the shrimp dumplings, everything else we had was disgusting both in looks and taste. The noodles were partly overcooked, partly raw/crunchy. The fish on the noodles was falling apart as a result of the chef having cooked the hell out of it. Some of the dishes that were supposed to be served hot were room temperature-cold. Heck, we arrived at the restaurant at noon, so it's not like they were serving us left over food... (or were they?).  The food was so bad, even our Chinese friends started feeling embarrassed for having taken us to China Cafe. In fact, they were more disappointed with the food than we were.  The worst part of it, my partner and I had an awful diarrhoea afterwards.  On the positive side, the food was cheap. But definitely not worth it.

They didn't have Peking Duck, so we ordered 3 dishes: Stir Fried Peas Leaves with garlic (No flavor, some portions of the dish extremely salty, some bland), Beef with Vegetables (Shitake mushrooms were not soaked long enough, ingredients were not seasoned, gravy was salty on some parts of the plate and bland on others) & Sesame Chicken (Soggy chicken and runny sauce).  Food was so bad that everyone at the table didn't eat. We usually get dim sum here and we ordered the sesame chicken last time and it was pretty good. Boy were we wrong.  Maybe the main chef was on break and the dishwasher cooked? I am not sure. I did mention to the waitstaff that the food was not usually this bad and they kept apologizing. The food was inedible tonight. We were too tired to cook and went out to grab a quick bite to eat, but had to come back home and cook anyhow. Whoever cooked the food tonight does not deserve to be in the food service industry. China Cafe should be ashamed of themselves for serving this kind of food to the customers and then charging them money for it.",-0.9724,0.841,0.034,0.125,0.6270576131687242

We tried steamed goods and fried dim sum. They were all nasty. The center of the egg rolls were still cold when I got them, and the exterior was very greasy. The service was mediocre. We had to find a different waitress to take care of the problem.  With four dishes, the meal ended at roughly $14 for four dishes (tips included).  If you just want a quick fix of dim sum without waiting much this place will do the job. Many local people come here to wait for work.

That is my all time favorite dim sum dish, and it is the reason why I continue to give them my business. My kids also like their other dim sum dishes like their sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves. I do not order their haw gow that often only once in a blue moon, because I feel their shrimp is not very clean and not very springy when I bite into it. There are a few other dim sum dishes I also like their like their fuzzy foot ball, tora root with pork fried, and their steam black bean spare ribs.

The food was Cantonese style seafood as seafood is the house specialty. Each table received 10-12 different dishes: lobster, shrimp and salad, bok choy and mushrooms, soup, fish and vegetables, sweet and sour chicken, whole roasted chicken, Chinese broccoli, and another green vegetable that I'd never seen before. This was followed up by two desserts: green bean soup and custard pastries. The entire meal was fantastic.

2012-02-19,1.0,"To be fair, we didn't go here for Dim Sum - though I won't be coming back to try it.  As soon as we walk into their alcove to check their menu and prices, a goon is up in our faces, telling us that 'the restaurant is this way' and 'come in come in' in this weird tone like we had done something wrong by trying to look at the menu that THEY THEMSELVES POSTED IN THEIR LITTLE ALCOVE THING. We hadn't even opened the door, and we were getting bad vibes - but we decided to chance it. We have very open minds when it comes to restaurants. We sit down and are served too-leafy stale green tea. I was spitting leaves out during my meal. Also, I'm all for innovation, but is the place really too cheap to buy new teapots when theirs break? All of the pot lids were attached with a macguyvered screw-and-nut. I like steampunk, but not while I'm eating, please. The steamed wontons were fairly decent - the flavor came solely from the filling, as the wonton was slightly cardboard-tasting. Our hot-pot was fatty and gristly, and although it had a pleasing ginger flavor was nothing special. I could make better at home, easily. We waited half an hour for our check, and the waitstaff seemed to want NOTHING to do with us - even though we had cash in hand to pay our bill, our check was dropped off at our table, and we were left for another 10 minutes to wait. If I had actually had somewhere to be, I would have been fuming. Decor? Abysmal. It looks like a retirement home - but a nice retirement home, like an assisted-living one. Blue-green florescence and peeling wall paint abound. Their empty entryway was extremely off-putting. Never going back. The food is okay, though not worth the price.

2011-10-25,4.0,"While you can argue endlessly about who has the absolute best dim sum in Chinatown (and to be honest, no single place makes every single item to perfection), this is by far the friendliest and most welcoming dim sum restaurant in the area. I found everything to be hot, fresh, and resonably priced so that even if you happen to not enjoy a particular item but want to eat adventurously, it hardly makes an impression on your bill. Service is pretty traditional, with steam carts navigating the fairly tightly packed tables. Naturally, the main risk here is jumping at the first good looking items and then regretting it once something else turns up! So, as always, a good group of people is preferable. I will say that the items in black bean sauce served here are literally the most fermented and pungent I have ever had. If that's to your taste then you'll be really happy. I would personally avoid those particular dishes in the future. Needless to say, most people there disagreed, since chicken feet in black bean sauce was by far one of the most common items to exit the kitchen. Very little English is spoken here, but they have a dim sum menu and staff will point out which dumplings or other options are on their particular cart.",0.9405,0.787,0.136,0.077,0.5424216027874564

Luckily my Chinese upbringing has taught me what all the different dishes are because if you're unfamiliar with dim sum it can be a little difficult to figure out what is what since the wait staff is not particularly proficient in English. More reasons for trying new stuff, right? Unfortunately, there is a definite correlation between the temperature of the food and how late in the lunch hour it is, so go early.

I usually get the Dim Sum to go because I can get in and out in 5 minutes, they are pretty busy all mornings and will have everything ready. Order the steam shrimp dumpling they cut up large pieces of shrimp for the filling (vs rock shrimp), noodle rolls and pan fried buns if you're a first timer . They also have these prepared mini rice boxes with steam ribs in garlic or stewed chicken feet with soy sauce for just a few dollars and filling for a lunch.

2009-07-15,4.0,"Before this review, I just want to say I only go here for Dim Sum since dinner is so pricey here. So the 4 stars are for the Dim Sum plates and prices.  THE GOOD: The entire dim sum menu is pretty legit. My dad somehow stumbled upon this place with my mom awhile back, and we have been going here for dim sum ever since. The service is always nice, but that maybe due to our family being regulars and them knowing my entire family already. Actually, I'm surprised they're nice to us since my dad is infamous for being a piss poor tipper. IMO, they have the best pan fried pork buns in Chinatown. That is a must have when going there for dim sum. Other very good dishes are the spare ribs, any of the dumplings and rice rolls, deep fried taro roll with meat, the congee, actually since I'm pretty much naming everything on the dim sum menu, I will just say the dim sum menu. There's a certain dish my parents would recommend but I only like this from time to time: Chicken Feet. If you are a fan, China Cafe probably has the best I've tasted compared to other places I normally go to. My father seems to be a chicken feet expert and he says the same too. Another great thing about this place is that they do dim sum by carts. This guarantees prompt service and since the place is usually busy, the food is always replenished quick and fresh. I find that some places without the carts end up bringing out the order 1-2 dishes at a time with long breaks in between dishes. I grew up on the bigger Three Happiness's dim sum and love the carts. I need my food on the spot people! All the food is priced fairly cheap, which is surprising considering that their dinner menu is so expensive.  THE BAD: At times, there is a language barrier between customers and the waitresses. This problem apparently has been solved though by the restaurant designating 1-2 specific waitresses that know English well enough to help out. Parking can be bad during the morning hours since it's in the middle of Wentworth, but there's a parking garage south of the restaurant that isn't too steep.  THE UGLY: The dinner prices. That $$ price range isn't for the dim sum that is for sure. I'm sure the food is good since the dim sum is tasty, but the prices are that bad. There really isn't much bad besides that. Go for the dim sum, and don't go for dinner. And try the Chicken Feet if you're adventurous enough and like sucking on toes.",0.9918,0.759,0.164,0.077,0.5730435305435305

2007-05-14,4.0,"When it comes to dim sum China Cafe is one of these all around places that is overlooked by it's neighbors, but can hold it's own once you get in the door. Despite being on the smaller side, I find this a plus when it comes to dim sum. You know the carts can't run and hide like they can at Phoenix or Furama. Also, a quick glance around the room can tell you which carts are carrying what. Then you can flag one over if you see something you like.  If you are intimidated by Chinatown service or aren't traveling in the company of people in the know, at least you can see what's in the carts. Of course the unexperienced (and the non-Asian) will be the first targets of the cart servers pushing the unpopular food items, and then trying to explain what you are looking for is always a challenge due to the language barrier, but hey...this is Chinatown. Because of its prominent location you will see both locals and the more adventurous tourists (or suburbanites) come in. If they have an open mind and/or were referred by someone in the know, this is a good place to start. Have some adventure and try the dumplings, get the shrimp wrapped in noodles (aka 'fun'), covered with soy sauce (my favorite no matter what dim sum place I eat at). I was there last week and the bill came out to $13 a person, and we must've had at least 4 or 5 different selections before we filled up. China Cafe also serves regular lunch and dinnner items. The late lunch and dinner choices are good, but I tend to eat elsewhere for dinner, and half the time they are closed for the day when I arrive in the area anyway. Pros: Easy to find, small seating area makes it easy to find what you want during dim sum, selection and taste is good for the price. A good place to try if you are feeling adventurous, but not too adventurous. Central location in Chinatown makes it easy to walk off whatever you ate. Cons: Not limited to this restaurant, but language barrier may be a turn off if you don't know what you want (or do know, but can't explain it), expect to walk if you can't find parking, although not as bad as other places, this place does have a dingy look which may be a turn-off to some. To 'dim sum' it up: It's not Phoenix, it's not Furama, and it's definitely not Three Happiness (the unofficial tourist trap of Chinatown), it's just a small corner restaurant that serves good food at good prices.
