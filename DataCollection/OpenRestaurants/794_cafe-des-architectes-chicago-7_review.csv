2017-07-19,3.0,We had breakfast here one morning. The food was ok. The service was not great. We were out on the patio and felt forgotten several times. We were staying at the hotel so it was convenient but we didn't go back again the next day.,-0.2493,0.89,0.034,0.076,0.25
2017-06-10,2.0,"I am so sad to write this review. For about 6 or 7 years, we have always made it a point to eat here at least once each summer--usually outside on the patio. It has changed over the years, but to varying degrees, it was always good food and classic service.  Those days seem to be over. Sitting down, I was immediately disappointed with the menu--it has been trimmed down to a very sparse list. I suspect the hamburger is there for the hotel crowd :) I don't care for lengthy menus, but it seemed much less interesting than in the past. The good part. The food was good.  We ordered a charcuterie plate for one--and it could have fed three.  Great cheeses and meats.  The salmon amuse bouche was just okay. Husband had pea soup, which was lovely.  My bibb salad was a mess (literally) as it was drowning in liquid. It had too many pears (luckily, hubby loves them), good blue cheese, and virtually no discernible nuts. Way over-priced for what it was.  We shared the chicken entree which was excellent. Great mashed potatoes, Brussels sprouts, and morels. I love morels and these were good. Delicious little macaroon and candy as a complementary sweet at the end. Why two stars?  The service was beyond terrible.  This is a place that used to be quite formal--chargers, cutlery with each course, water constantly refilled. Even when it became less formal, the service was usually good, We were seated for about twenty minutes before they even brought water or took a drink order.  Then the long wait began!  Seriously, we had no bread, no nothing for at least 40  minutes after we ordered.  My water glass was empty most of the time. They were woefully understaffed. Roni, our lead server was personable, and tried--he apologized a lot. The young french woman assisting was totally incompetent.  She could barely describe the dishes, she never once refreshed water, she would look directly at the dirty dishes on the table and walk away from them. We had to ask her to bring a soup spoon and fresh cutlery. The hostess and manager were busing more tables than she was.  The manager never once came by to ask how things were--I suspect he already knew the answer! Two and half hours--and we didn't do dessert or coffee. Oh my, where did my Cafe go?",0.9924,0.714,0.181,0.106,0.5065192743764171

I like how the servers bring out a tray of bread to choose from, along with the different butters and cream cheese. The coffee was also spectacular. Other than that, the food didn't really knock me off my feet. My first course was the salad, which was more like a few pieces of veggies on top of a cracker. Not really my kind of salad. My entrée pick was the rainbow trout, which was pretty tasty but a very tiny portion. My dessert pick was the white chocolate lemon cake. This was much better than expected or how it looked, but still not my favorite dessert.  Service is a little slow, but very accommodating. Overall, the food was mediocre, and the portions small.

Just because Gilt features particular businesses, does not necessarily mean that they are having issues, but sadly CDA is having some serious issues.

For obvious reasons, we stayed away from the crab cakes. For an appetizer, we went with the chestnut provisions charcuterie plate and it was good. We ordered the maple duck and halibut and my duck was cooked to the point that it was tough and chewy and my gf's halibut was...you guessed it....FISHY and overcooked! We should have known better.  I sent my duck back and asked that it be cooked rare and even after that, it was still too chewy. Like, I was still chewing after 5 minutes which prompted me to spit it out.

Begin by enjoying an expertly curated cocktail by Ish, a knowledgeable Chicago transplant, who prides himself in creative cocktails that address the whims of the drinker: I tend to go effervescent fruit based or mescal, but let Ish create based on consulting. Ish doesn't disappoint! The secondary accompanying detail is in house food development, be it picked vegetables, in house baked breads, in house made cheese, charcuterie, or grown vegetables.

Whatever the salmon preparation is will also be superb.What's new is the fairly recent development of Chestnut Provisions, the in-house production of cheese and charcuterie.

All meals and service were top shelf and very professional.So much so that I was very reluctant to dine elsewhere.  What is most impressive is that the Executive Chef and his culinary team are making Artisan cheeses in the Sofitel ""cheese cave"". Equally impressive is the in house Charcuterie program. This is almost a lost art in kitchens of America and this team   has certainly mastered the craft. They  offer daily tasting ""slates"" that feature the cheeses , meats and some very well thought out condiments. I would be remiss if I did not mention the Octopus Panzanella Salad with watermelon gelee, quite simply brilliant! Also not to be missed is the Torchon of Foie Gras. Again amazing condiments and a hint of St Germain. I could go on and on , however I think I made my point here. DONT MISS CDA!

The salad was average, the dessert was ok, but the salmon was excellent. The cold soup wasn't good. It had a strange sour and smokey taste. This restaurant is a cool little gem nestled in a hotel. Parking is a pain. The cuisine is French and the theme definitely shows; the servers greet you in both French and French accented English. The prices are decent for lunch and pretty classy. One thing that was strange with our executive lunch was that everything was brought out at the same time. Unfortunately by the time we finished our salads, the salmon was getting cold.

2015-07-15,3.0,"Where to begin... Beautiful modern restaurant located in the hotel Sofitel Water Tower off the ""Mag Mile"". Prices were reasonable ($120/pp) including cocktails, wine and desserts. Foie Gras and bread basket were absolutely delish. Every course was prepared with great care, and appeared as a work of art...truly exceptional. All six members in our party absolutely LOVED their food. The main issues that yielded only a 3-star rating, are as follows: 1) our ""singing French waiter"" Roni, who really overdid things. In an upscale restaurant such as this one does not lend itself to servers ""serenading"" the ladies at the table.  2) Several diners in our party ordered Copper River Salmon. One diner received a piece of conventional ""farm raised salmon"", discerned by it's noticeably lighter color. The meal was replaced, but took over  30 min to arrive! By this time, other diners had  all finished their main course. 3) There was absolutely no offer to remove the meal from the bill for the inconvenience. However, as the hostess of this dinner, I did request, and the waiter removed the charge... I should not have had to request the removal of the charge! Nearing the end of our meal, Roni was beyond obsequious, between the singing and then writing down his website and handing each one of us a card with the info...not cool. I would definitely dine here again, food and atmosphere are ranked at + 5 stars, albeit with a different server and hopefully no food incidents. Also check out ""Le Bar"" on the other side of the hotel... Great spot for a cocktail!

David checked with us beforehand to make sure it was okay for him to serve different members of our party different dishes in each course, and we enthusiastically agreed, as it allowed us to sample twice as many dishes. And dishes galore there were, each artfully arranged, and accompanied by thoughtful wine pairings. I'll let the photos speak for themselves, but suffice it to say that each was just as delicious as it looks.

But I also need to stop going for brunch on the weekdays. I would love to come back to try their actual brunch menu one weekend OR dinner. We ordered the bacon and gruyère quiche and farmhouse benedict to share. The crust on the quiche was just flaky enough and the gruyère wasn't too heavy at all for the dish. The bacon and gruyère coupled well together. The prosciutto I thought might be a little much as prosciutto is saltier than I prefer in food but the dish as a whole wasn't too salty. The apple (it says fuji on the menu but looked like julienned green apples) balanced out the cheese and bacon/prosciutto with its tart and sweetness. The farmhouse benedict may have been the best eggs benedict I've ever had and I have had many many eggs benedict in my life (I almost always order benedict at any breakfast/brunch I eat and even make it at home!) The sourdough gave the dish enough structure and was heavy enough to support the short rib, egg, greens, and tomato jam. The eggs were perfectly poached with the yolk still runny. The braised short rib was a little saucier than I like but it was okay because the eggs were so on point. The greens and tomato jam topped it off nicely and pulled it all together well. We also asked if they had macarons which they didn't--BUT the pastry chef was so gracious as to give us two strawberry macaron to eat.

We had the foie gras to start with and it was probably one of the best foie gras dishes I ever had. My friend ordered the venison, and I had the amish chicken. Both were good. When the server brought out the dessert menu, we said we were quite full but would take a look. Then he brought out a dessert flight for us, on the house! It was a lovely surprise and the dessert (chocolates, marshmallows, macaroons) was certainly amazing.

2014-05-15,4.0,"I had breakfast here on a weekday and it was pretty good. Wait time was zero. The restaurant is not that large though, so I can imagine it gets pretty crowded on the weekends. We had the Farmhouse Eggs Benedict and Quiche (maybe I got those two names mixed up, but it was some quiche and some eggs benedict). Both were delicious and honestly a very interesting mix of flavors.  The entrees came with a pastry/bread, which were equally delicious. Having never been to France I cannot comment on how ""authentic"" they are. We had macarons at the end and they were HEAVENLY. They weren't out on display but the pastry chef apparently had some made.  I would go back just to eat the macarons.  One bummer is that the Zagat gift card can only be used during dinner time. Minus one star. Sad.  If you want to have brunch, this is a great place to go. I can't comment on the wait time on the weekends, but I am pretty sure it is less of a hot mess than any of the other popular brunch places. It's honestly not that much pricier than some of the other brunch places, but much better quality food. Who wants to eat mystery skillets at some of the other brunch places? (*cough* yolk, wildberry *cough*). Pay a few bucks more and you'll get much better food.  Do not leave here without eating macarons. Next time I'm going during dinner time and spending my entire zagat gift card on them macarons.  Also, during breakfast, it's not that upscale - so don't be overwhelmed by all those comments.

2014-03-24,5.0,"This place is all class and elegance.  It is really perfection.  I recently came back for a tasting menu from the Alsace region with wine pairings and bread from a French bakery.  The experience was outstanding from beginning to end.  The service is of the highest standard, you really believe they will do whatever you need to make you comfortable!  I think part of this is that they are located within the Sofitel.  In fact, my friend needed a phone charger and they actually charged her phone behihnd the front desk while we ate.  What service! We started with cocktails which were very good but quite expensive ($13-14 I think).  I had a light and refreshing drink with gin, cucumber, and elderflower.  Then the tasting menu began.  There is really no point going through the courses in the tasting menu since it was a one-time event, but if you ever have the opportunity to attend a similar event here in future, it will be worth it.  The courses were prepared lovingly and presented beautifully.  We had outstanding seared foie gras with a luscious maple flavor, perfectly poached fish, divine raspberry sorbet, and lots more.  The beer and wine pairings were very well thought out and explained to us.  It was a great opportunity to taste wines I wouldn't normally try (one Riesling came from a $180 bottle). The chef and the sous-chefs actually joined the servers in bringing out the food and explaining the dishes.  It was fun to be able to ask them about the courses and learn a bit more about what we were eating. The room is chic, the food is excellent, and the prices suit accordingly.  But it is an excellent choice for a special occasion. Oddly, on a Friday evening the restaurant wasn't full.  I'm guessing because you have to enter the hotel to find it, there's less foot traffic.  But if you are in need of an excellent meal and find most places are all booked up, never fear!  You will be in for a treat here.",0.9983,0.752,0.237,0.012,0.5085971685971686
2014-03-06,5.0,"Bon, bon, et bon! I truly enjoyed a most exceptional meal on a Wednesday evening in this surprisingly sparsely populated restaurant. I found the room to be stylish yet somehow still comfortable and the attentive staff was helpful and cheery. Their greetings in French were appreciated and my pigeon-French replies were treated with respect and a little humor. Our waiter hailed from a neighborhood near Loyola and was simply delightful. That said, the star of the show was the exquisite food and its amazing presentation. This is haute cuisine at its finest - as good or better than any meal I've had in Paris. We started with their signature cocktails which were delicately balanced and then shared the oysters which were fresh, colorfully presented, yet avoided overpowering the oyster. Well done, Monsieur! We were also delivered a delicate pastry about the size of a quarter and 1 inch high that provided a perfect bridge to our entrees. I found this detail to be very thoughtful. My entrée was a beautifully plated rabbit, spliced into three mini-meals, each one unique yet complementary to the other. Each featured a sublime sauce that added flavor without overwhelming. One actually had a curry base which surprised and delighted me even though I'm not typically drawn to curry based food. Lastly, the vegetable blend on this plate was perhaps the biggest surprise of all. I am definitely not a big veggie lover, but I would go for this blend every day if I could. Fresh yellow squash, brussel sprouts, perhaps another item or two all in a light sauce that brought out the flavor while cutting out the bitterness I find a bit unwelcome in less prepared forms. My date ate light and enjoyed her snapper sashimi as an entrée. Her plating was simply a work of art and we both regret not taking a picture to share in this review. We paired these meals with a nice pinot noir - many pinots to choose from, btw, at prices ranging from $40ish to well beyond my Wednesday evening budget. We finished the wine with a selection of three cheeses which our waiter helped select. It was nice to share a cheese plate that was appropriately room temperature.  We closed with a dessert tray filled with macaroons and various white and dark chocolate creations. We only had room for the macaroons (amazing!) while the chocolates must wait for later today.  I strongly recommend this restaurant for that special occasion in your future.

2014-01-09,3.0,"I chose this restaurant for a special occasion, and I was underwhelmed. While the sofitel is a beautiful hotel, the restaurant doesn't really do a good job of separating itself from the hotel--the whole time I was there, I just felt like I was dining in a hotel. This is largely in part because the restaurant is very open-- which I normally appreciate open spaces/high ceilings, but despite the fact that the architecture is spacious, the seating is not. We were practically sharing our dinner with the couples on either side of us. There is not much seating in the restaurant, and the primary backdrop of the restaurant space is the hotel lobby. Beyond the ambiance, the food was good, but not great for the price. There were no flavors or unique menu items that really stood out to me. So yes, this is an upscale place to dine and the sofitel is beautiful, but it's definitely not a foodie place and don't expect any stand-out things on the menu.",0.9037,0.793,0.139,0.068,0.5968749999999999

Know before you go that they don't take reservations for breakfast but on the Sunday morning I was there- there was not a wait around 10 but it did fill up after that.   We were seated at a two top close to the front windows where you can watch the people scurry by on their way in and out of the Sofitel hotel.  I loved that they bring around a bread basket and let you pick from its decadence be it a chocolate filled croissant, or a perfect baguette.   The menu is varied enough that you can find something to your liking, I ordered the shrimp and crab omelette and my friend had the crepes.  We had a small snafu with the ordering as the server thought I had ordered a different omelette so when it came out with my friend's crepes and needed to be sent back, I was surprised they didn't take both entrees back as we basically needed up eating in shifts. . . . Her first and then my corrected dish coming out when she was basically done.  Not ideal by any means.  The manager did bring me some fruit to nibble on while I waited but clearly this was a miss. Our server, however was quite nice.  He even remembered to come over at 10:30 to let us know that we could now have the bloody Mary's that we had ordered before they were serving alcohol. . . Made me feel like I really NEEDED that drink!  Ha!  But the bloods were perfectly made with just the right amount of spice.  If you drive - they do have valet out front that will run you $24 for a couple of hours.  It might be a better bet to park in the garage just to the west of the hotel entrance.

2013-12-11,3.0,"Café de Architectes We happened into this restaurant because of a Groupon (30% off ala carte menu), I do not think I would have tried this place otherwise.  French cuisine is not high on my list. Located in the Sofitel Hotel the restaurant is small and sleek. It is very modern and colorful but I still felt cold and unable to settle in comfortably. Everyone greets you with a nice French greeting. I never know how to respond with French or English.  The staff were polite and tried to keep the elegance of the restaurant but played off our cute comments and attempts to lighten the atmosphere a bit.  We started with three different cheeses (at the time of this review the menu online has not been update to their winter menu); Langres, a semi-soft goat cheese, and firm WI cow cheese with espresso rind. (If you have been following along with my other reviews, you will note that I have a hard time eating cheese, especially goat cheese. The enzymes in my mouth do not allow me to enjoy the flavor some people get.) Of these three I was able to semi-enjoy the firm cow cheese. The espresso rind made it somewhat smoky.  For our entrees we  opted for the Halibut and Diver Scallops to share. They are large plates but the chef was gracious enough to split our Halibut. I was pleasantly surprised with this dish. The puree with garlic was warm and delicious for a cold evening. The potatoes and mushrooms were perfect and provided the right amount of texture to accompany the fish. I enjoyed the lightly browned and crisped top, but did make the fish a tough to cut. The Diver Scallop plate came with five scallops seared to a crisp on top with orange and soy-ish type sauces topped with salmon roe. The few mushrooms also included with the dish were so salty I almost had to spit one out. Over all the combined ingredients were so salty I could not finish my portion.  We also ordered the Chocolate Ribbon for dessert. It came with a soft gooey ribbon of chocolate laid across the plate, a salted caramel ice cream and small fudge brownie bites. The ice cream had a buttery caramel flavor you do not expect to be part of a smooth cold cream. I couldn't stay away from it. The gold flakes added to the dessert will make you rich inside when eaten! We ended the evening with a dessert from the chef, a three tier sculpture decorated with small macaroons, chocolate drops and peta de fruit. I would return to the restaurant to try their de-light menu. It is a three course dinner focused on healthy eating.

2013-06-14,5.0,"If I should ever require a ""last meal,"" my only request is that Chef Greg Biggers prepare it. I cannot give enough thanks to this chef, nor to the excellent wait staff for the gift of such an exceptional dining experience. I have been in Chicago for eight days now, eating at an incredible variety of restaurants, and Café des Architectes stands out in a way that I did not think possible. I was dining alone and when I arrived, the hostess was nice enough to ask if I wanted a newspaper or magazine. As it was, I wanted to keep up with a chess tournament, so I declined and stayed with my smart phone.  I was given my choice of where to sit, which is a great touch for a lonely diner. Too many restaurants will put a solitary eater in the least desirable table. Although the menu is seasonal, I will discuss what I ate. I ordered the Meyer Lemon Ricotta Tortellini, which was served with polenta, Moroccan veal jus, tasso ham, and, I believe, pea greens. It was quite wonderful, beautifully presented and without a single fault. Much to my surprise, Chef Biggers came out and introduced himself, complimenting me on my choice of dishes for the evening (I had pulled out many of the stops, he pulled out the rest himself). The chef sent me an amuse-bouche, which is a traditional touch, but one sadly absent from every other restaurant in Chicago that fed me. What really shocked me was that I was then sent the Hudson Valley Foie Gras Torchon, which had some a variety of accompaniments, the most exquisite of which was the streusel. It caused the foie gras' flavor to pop. The rhubarb jam, it must be noted, was a delicate touch, much superior to the habit of serving foie gras with mustard (something I've never understood). I followed the foie gras with the Spring Pea Velouté, served at an absolutely perfect temperature, cool enough to take full advantage of the fresh peas. This was assembled at the table by the waitress, who did a fantastic job throughout the meal. After the velouté, I had the duck. It's always a sign of living dangerously when duck breast is served with a dinner knife instead of a steak knife, but it worked out fine. The duck breast (sitting on a corn purée with asparagus and I think morels and chanterelles though I could be wrong) was cooked expertly. For desert I had a selection of tiny deserts, all of which were wonderful. I expect that they were the work of Leigh Omilinsky, whose talents are very well known. Then... another surprise... I was sent a tasting selection of amazing creations from marshmallows to Chambourd macaron. A delight. During the meal I had two grapefruit rickeys, a couple of bottles of water, and I finished with an excellent café au lait.  I don't know why some reviewers have been upset with the drinks. I drink. Probably too much. And I was very satisfied with the skills of the bartender. I know that some reviewers have also characterized the restaurant as expensive. It was not, in my opinion, over-priced. Indeed, I think that compared to similarly situated restaurants both in Chicago and in New York, I think that Café des Architectes was an exceptionally good deal. I cannot compliment the service of the waitstaff or the professionalism of Chef Biggers enough. This was one of the best meals I've ever eaten, and definitely the highlight of my trip to Chicago. By all means, eat here. Take your time. Enjoy and respect the food and the experience. Next time I am in Chicago, I will certainly return.",0.9975,0.793,0.159,0.048,0.6477233372687916

Food: Excellent.  Judging by the prices and the ""fine dining"" category, you'd think that they'd either be lacking in taste or portions.  I was pleasantly surprised when I found that both were superb.  I ordered the seared duck breast which came with asparagus and sliced potatoes which was absolutely heavenly.  The duck breast (as the server so politely explained) was a bit tougher and game-y due to it being wild caught, but Lord was it good.  It was cooked perfectly and it had a nice ring of fat which added the perfect amount of savory goodness.  Also ordered the Loaded Potato Fries, thinking that the main entrees were going to be small, and it was a ginormous portion.  BUT, the taste, again, all there.  The fries themselves were huge and paired with bacon, parmesan cheese, and sour cream aioli, it was freaking AWESOME.  OH AND...complimentary appetizer and dessert?!  YES, PLEASE! Service: To infinity, and beyond!  For real.  Our server, a legitimate French man (loved his accent!) was oh-so-kind and very attentive throughout the entire meal.  Being part of a larger group, I can imagine it being hard trying to keep up with everything, but he was always very polite, thanked US after we ordered/asked for anything, AND threw some French vocab. to boot!  I always like to judge my service on how many times my water glass empties, and at Cafe des Architectes my glass NEVER went empty. Ambiance: Definitely romantic, but again, great if you want a classy dinner with the girls.  They're also very accommodating--we were about 15-20 minutes late for our reservation, but they had everything set up for us and weren't annoyed/frustrated with us.

Service was good and friendly -- I think we made it abundantly clear early on that we were pretty casual and I think our primary waiter lightened up a bit.   A nice enough environment with good service, but lacking in the food department, in the end I was not that impressed.",0.9986,0.774,0.198,0.028,0.6008827340459993

2013-02-27,5.0,"I came here with a friend around 9:30pm on a random, snowy Tuesday after Bistro Voltaire decided to shut down their kitchen since it was a slow day, despite the fact that we had reservations. We were looking for a place that's open late and found ourselves at The Sofitel.  Two guys in suits opened the door for us as we walked in (always a nice touch). The interior of the hotel was beautiful - dimly lit and very upscale. A hostess promptly appeared and seated us by the windows.  My friend and I both ended up getting the 3-course prix fixe menu ($39). There were only two selections for each course, but everything was super good.  Amuse bouche - A pear-based bite with some greens and slices of salami. I hadn't eaten meat in a couple of days, so I liked the salami although the thing was certainly nothing breathtaking. Butternut Squash Veloute - a delicious and creamy bowl of butternut squash soup with spinach meringue and garlic crouton. Roasted Duck Breast - I absolutely love, duck although most of the duck dishes I've had were from Asian restaurants. This dish definitely did not disappoint - the meat was incredibly tender and the flavor was amazing. There were two hearty pieces and a nice touch of broccolini on the side.  Sorbet Trio - a trio of I think raspberry, lemon, and orange (I can't remember exactly, so don't call me out on that). It was very light and refreshing. For drinks, I had The Grapefruit Rickey ($15), which had vodka and St. Germain (I'm obsessed with anything elderflower flavored). It came in a super large glass and was very refreshing, although I could barely taste any hint of alcohol. After our meal, the server brought us a complimentary dessert tower. My friend and I were totally stuffed by then, but we don't like to say no to free food. There were 8 bite-sized delicacies of 4 varieties: mini macaroon, mini marshmallow, root beer chocolate (my favorite - even though I don't even like root beer), and another chocolate with filling.  Atmosphere: While we were there, there was a group of ladies-who-lunch type, a couple, and a table of middle-aged businessmen. The restaurant (and hotel) seemed very empty - by the time we left around 11pm, we were the only ones there.

Our first course had the same issue, I wouldn't touch my veloute until my friend was served her salad. A server even asked me if everything was ok because I wasn't eating and only after I told him that I was waiting for her salad did it finally appear, thus my course was cold ....

2012-06-09,5.0,"I made a last-minute dinner reservation at Cafe des Architectes via Savored. It was a late night in the middle of the week, so there were plenty of open tables. But the reservation gave us a hefty discount, so why not? The decor is very modern and chic. My bf and I were offered a seat by the windows. Usually when people sit at opposite ends of a table, one person has a great view of the restaurant while the other simply has a wall to stare at. Not so at Cafe des Architectes! The full-length windows give a great view to the latter person. There were 3 types of bread to choose from, served with butter and an olive spread. It's nice to have choices! My bf and I settled on the Cheese Ritual as an appetizer to share - 7 cheeses of the chef's selection (more choices!). The dish had a good range of cheeses, some sharp, others creamy. There was one blue cheese that was a bit too powerful for me to enjoy. The cheeses were also served with small strawberries, which packed a lot of flavor, and madeleines, which seemed unusual... After a palate-cleansing, complimentary watermelon puree, my bf ordered the prime ribeye while I had the rabbit. The prime ribeye looked perfectly cooked (rare). The rabbit came prepared three ways, all deliciously tender and juicy. This was my first experience eating rabbit, and it was unlike anything I have ever tasted before. Simply life-altering. Dessert was a whole other meal unto itself! I had the cherry blossom panna cotta, which was bursting with sakura flavor, and my bf had the rhubarb baba. After ordering the dessert, the waiter brought out a tower of complimentary mini desserts: chocolate truffles, raspberry jelly candy (too sweet), and pistachio macarons.

There were two positives about today and two only....1) we got to sit in the actual restaurant (usually people sit in a separate boring room for tea) and 2) the actual tea itself was enjoyable.  Other than that, it was shockingly bad!  $30/person for a tea service should at least make a person full.  What we received each was two shortbread the size of quarters, a smoked salmon sandwich the size of a 1x1 inch square (with stale/dry bread), a quarter size macaroon, a mini puff pastry with cheese cream, 2 mini scones each and some mini toasts with cumcumber and olive. I was starving!  To make matters worse, throughout the meal, we could barely hear each other talk because some man was vacuming around the restaurant.  He was actually going under the tables where people were sitting.  When asked why they had to vacum right that moment, the manager said the croissants were very flaky and fell on the floor.  The croissants aren't the only flaky thing at Cafe Des Architectes!!!!!   Cafe des Architectes is obviously trying to do some modern twist on the afternoon tea but fails miserably.  How can you charge that money for one small pot of tea and a few crappy nibbles?

The main entree is what earns CDA a 4 - rather than a 5 - in my book.  I ordered the scallop and pork belly.  I know it is French food, but the plate was WAY too rich.  Even the scallop, which can be prepared very light and fresh, was heavy and overwhelming, likely because of copious amounts of butter it was cooked in.  There wasn't anywhere to turn for relief - my sides were boursin cheese-laden polenta and braised greens.. heavy, heavy, heavy.  I enviously eyed my friend's fish - why did I decide I wasn't in the mood for fish tonight? - as I choked down as much as I could of my fatty pork belly.  It was delicious, to be sure, but the kind of delicious I can only handle a few bites of. But then came dessert, and the heaviness of dinner vanished immediately with the light, ethereal perfection on my plate.  I ordered the vanilla honey parfait which I'm pretty confident was by far the best dessert offering (not that I tried the others...).  It was a deconstructed take on parfait.  There were so many intricate components carefully scattered on the plate and I didn't even know what half of it was, but it was amazing and delicious - one of the best desserts I've ever had.  One piece completely airy, dissolving instantly and the next bite a burst of citrus flavor.  Incredible.

Fortunately, the evening improved with every dish that followed. The duck breast had a beautiful smokey flavor, and the persimmon puree was intriguing (buttery-smooth yet so much more complexity than standard mashed potatoes), the cauliflower added crunch and welcomed acidity.

I got the hazelnut dacquoise, which a a joy to look at and equally pleasing on the palate - light and airy cake with perfectly toasted hazelnuts, banana cream and coffee ice crystals.

2012-02-27,3.0,"In a word, underwhelming.  The entire restaurant week menu showed promise, but dish after dish tasted flat and lacked character.  The squash soup had nice texture but was very straightforward, especially if you take away the duck confit.  Some additional spice or garnish for flavor/texture would have gone a long way.  The entree, two separate preparations of pork belly and scallop, was the dish I looked forward to the most.  Again, flat.  The pork belly was surprisingly tough and desperately needed more braising time.  The glaze could have also used a hint of spice or sweetness to perk up the one note flavor profile.  At least the scallop was nicely seared and the confit of collard greens on which it was served was quite tasty.  Sadly, you know something's amiss when the greens are the best part of a dish featuring both pork belly and scallop.  At this point, I was hoping dessert would be this meal's saving grace.  I went with the chocolate and barley ""soil"", expecting pastry chef Fahy's extensive resume to make this dish shine.  I got my hopes up too high.  The plate of soil-esque cocoa granules and toasted barley (I'm guessing to imitate worms in the soil) was odd.  The dark chocolate ice cream (encased in a thin chocolate shell) wasn't nearly enough to play counterpart to the spoon fulls of dry granules.  I'm all for playfulness and creativity, but this dish didn't work for me. From a service standpoint, our server was friendly but perhaps a little green around the edges.  I don't expect long dissertations on each dish but a little more detail on preparation would have been nice.  She also made the rookie mistake of saying ""I can't personally recommend the beet dish since I don't like beets"".  Don't like beets, fine.  Just don't dissuade your customers from ordering it.  It could have been a very fine first course but now we'll never know.  Within the context of restaurant week, the $44 price tag really wasn't merited nor was a supplemental charge for the filet of beef entree.  Last I checked, Naha's $33 menu featured both Kurobuta pork belly and Wagyu beef, with the only up charge coming from an alternate entree of duck and foie gras.   If not for the good company, the meal could have been much less pleasant.  In the end, there was nothing egregiously bad to complain about, but nothing to boast about either.  Perhaps we simply just ran into a case of sacrificing quality for quantity.  It's restaurant week, so I'll take the good with the bad.",0.9809,0.789,0.129,0.082,0.5327949134199135

HAZELNUT DACQUOISE I regret not ordering the Vanilla Honey Parfait, as this was a little more muted than I anticipated. I did enjoy the tiny pops of sweet apricot and scoop of refreshingly creamy (perhaps parsnip) ice cream. Cleansing for the palate. The main course was the definite highlight of the meal-- who wouldn't enjoy a delicious meat cake with luxurious layers of adipose and lean carcass?

2012-02-16,4.0,"This review is ""tainted"" in a good way - based on various times we have had the pleasure to meet the Chef at places like Taste of the Nation, and other great city tasting events.  Every time we have had his food, it has been wonderful.  The Chef is also extremely pleasant, which makes it better. We happened to be downtown on Valentines Day for some ""medical"" things - and thought that it would be appropriate to head on over 2 blocks from where we were to have a great dinner- celebrate no matter what news we received.  We noted that Cafe Des Architectes was very close, and decided that based on tasting in the past, a nice walk over for a great meal was a good idea. Unfortunately, they were serving a special ""menu"" for the evening - a prix fixe at $79.00 - which did not include or offer wine to pair...you had 4 courses and you chose from several options in each course. We decided to start with Champagne, duh.....and then ordered a bottle of wine.  Our server was great, and actually showed us a bottle 1/2 the price of what we were going to order and said it was a better wine.....who knew!  Down sold on a French Wine - I'll take it!  And he was right - the Cote du Rhone we ordered was lovely.   My hubby and I both ordered different items in each course - EVERYTHING was great!  From some of the best oysters I have had (albeit there were THREE of them....) - to my single scallop over sweetbreads, to my sole short rib...to my chocolate desert.....it really was extremely tasty....my gripe...the portions were smaller than I have ever seen....and we do tasting menus ALOT!   I was very glad that we had a drink at the bar with some snacks and bread with dinner.....because elf food does not even begin to describe how small they servings were. We also ordered a desert wine for my hubby, and we both had cappuccinos- yum!   My issue for cost is....since we recently went to Le Titi de Paris....and for the same price (and our bottle of wine at ""Paris"" was double the cost as ""Cafe"") - we had more than 4 times the amount of food....and also had full meal leftovers for the next night.....and the food was INCREDIBLE there.....so..... Final thing - I WILL go back - not on Valentines Day.  I think the food is outstanding - I am hoping that the portions will be more ample when we return.  :0)",0.9971,0.814,0.172,0.014,0.5011060452549815

The entire menu was wonderful-- highlights included: Prosciutto-wrapped monkfish, squash risotto, fall mushrooms Roasted duck, cauliflower, smoked apricot sauce Chocolate bar, burnt caramel ice cream, coffee cream The service was just okay, our server was slightly aloof. She didn't know much about the dishes and needed help from others to explain them to us. Also, the runners are dressed too casually. Their outfits don't match the dressy atmosphere and it's strange to see them rushing around the dining room in what appear to be jeans and un-tucked, grey short-sleeved shirts. Not a real complaint, just odd. The Blackboard Eats discount was a phenomenal value, as their normal pricing is already quite reasonable for the level of cuisine they are putting out.

2012-01-22,4.0,"The cafe in the Sofitel was on my list but it couldn't have been a more perfect circumstance for arriving here to dine when I did.  I was meeting a girlfriend for lunch and when I called to arrange a meeting point, it turned out that we were in the same 'hood, only a couple blocks from each other and a only couple of blocks from Cafe des Architectes.  The last bit of summer sun was shining directly onto the patio, calling to us to enjoy a sophisticated lunch and a crisp glass of vin blanc.  Who am I to refuse such a calling? It started with a beautiful bread basket, all made in house, which included, a pretzel roll, baguette, and crispy parmesan crackers, served with both butter and a zippy green olive tapanade.   We decide to go the 'snacky' route, ordering a few small plates to pick at while we sunned ourselves and chatted about life and love and all things girlie.  My partner in crime is a trusting woman, putting her faith in me to order what I pleased.  The first selection was the Chicken Liver Pate with Fig Jam, Cognac Gelee and Brioche.  I could never pass up such a concoction!  The pate was good, not the best I'd ever had, but darn good, and after trying it on the brioche, I found that I preferred to smear it on the baguette.  Sometimes it can be TOO rich.  The butter toasted buttery brioche just sent this already decadent spread with its sweet condiments over the edge for me.  Luckily, I found a way to continue to enjoy it. We both agreed that the Diver Scallop with Duck Confit, Curried Cauliflower & Golden Raisins sounded interesting.  We went for it and were glad we did.  The scallop was perfectly done (yes, THE (ONE) scallop...come on...), the duck, deep and flavorful while the curry lent an exciting counterpoint and loud flavor component to the dish.  A little pop of sweet came every once in a while from the raisins.  A success!   Lastly, we ordered another 'jar'.  This time something on the lighter side.  A tartar of both ahi & yellowtail tunas with a yuzu-avocado puree was topped with a dollop of caviar and served with taro chips.  The fish was good, of course, and the puree was creamy and smooth with the necessary little acidic zip from the yuzu.  It was quite nice with the mellow sweetness and hearty crunch of the fried taro root.  Pretty, isn't it?   I can't say that the service was incredibly impressive.  When I asked about a specific wine, our server gave me blatantly wrong information and then tried to argue with me about it despite the fact that she was clearly uneducated on the subject.  Just say ""I don't know""... it's so much better than lying about it.  And when returning from the restroom, my friend nearly got pummeled by a busser.  That carried our conversation for a while.  In a place like this, you'd expect management to train their staff to let the guest pass when coming to a head.  Not so much the case here.  Kinda strange. Anyway, overall, a delicious and enjoyable lunch. The Short Version (Out of 10)...   Food: 8 Service: 6 Ambiance: 9 Overall impression: 8   Would I go back?

Their dinner was well executed as well! The food was really tasty.  Service is always great and pleasant... So then why 3 stars? Well, the new high-tea they just started having.  The tea selection was good. but... They executed the high tea slightly different from the tradition. Instead serving scones/sandwiches/etc on a tower rack, they served savory and sweet pastries on a flat tray.  The sweet items were good...but I am a bit disappointed on their savory items. These were prosciuttos on a toast, some kinda creamy cheese on a toast and a smoked salmon puff. Since you need to make reservation for the tea, so I guess they prepared all the food and placed them on the tray they were gonna bring to your table ahead of time. So the bread of the savory items were a bit stale since they have been sitting out. And i was expected to having the tea at their regular restaurant space, but it was actually at their private dining event area, so I felt like I was having a business meals with the white wall and white light.

I was excited when we entered the Sofitel's lobby.  It is lovely and plush and filled with fresh flowers.  I gazed eagerly towards the dining room...only to realize tea was held in a different room.  It was also lovely, but definitely less plush and was pretty loud (a wall of glass windows + bare walls = noise bouncing all over the place).   Cafe Des Architectes has a nice selection of teas available (8 to be exact) and offers red, white, green and traditional black teas.  A nice touch is that a sample of the teas are brought to you so you can sniff them before making a selection (except they all smelled very similar to my nose...possibly from having been stored in together?)  Your tea is brought loose leaf in an individual pot and timers are placed on the table so you know for how long to allow the tea to steep.  Others have mentioned only getting one pot of tea, but the waiters repeatedly offered to refill our pots with water  - I'm not sure if this is a new practice. Tea snacks are brought out with your tea.  For us, there were 3 savory and 4 sweet pieces each.  And pieces they were - as others have mentioned, everything was bite sized.  Tea offerings are typically less than a full meal, but I think this was the smallest volume of food I've ever seen offered at a tea.  The sweet selections were better than the savory but neither was mind-blowing. Overall my biggest problem with Cafe Des Architectes tea is the price point.  We had the $15 Living Social vouchers and if this tea were always $15, it would be an amazing deal.  Even $20 would be totally reasonable.  At the normal $30 price, it isn't worth it - that's on par with some of the more expensive teas in town and those offer posher settings and more/better food.  But tea service here IS new - I'll be keeping my eyes on subsequent reviews to see if Cafe Des Architectes either steps up its game or lowers prices to match their offerings.",0.9959,0.795,0.17,0.035,0.5027396341032704
2012-01-17,4.0,"This review of is for the afternoon tea service since The Living Social deal 1st let me know they even offer afternoon tea.  Here are a few things to know about me before getting too far along in this review: I HATE tea, do not like it at all (I go to afternoon teas mainly for the company & the lovely little finger sandwiches) I am a bit of kleptomaniac (not proud of it, but there you have it.  Mainly I steal pens, but I like trinkets too ;-) I am a chocoholic...truly, I have a problem I love me some deals (cheap is good, FREE is better!  It's my mantra for life).   Ok, now that you have been prepped...let's get to the review.   Afternoon tea service seems to be a newish thing for Cafe Des Architectes, but you would not really know it from the service & all the lovely touches throughout.  The tea is served in smaller room that the restaurant that is off on the other side of the Soifitel Hotel.  I was a bit sad not to be in the main dining area, but I got over that pretty quickly when I saw the room.  It had an intimate feel that seemed pretty proper for an afternoon of catching up with the tea ladies while sipping our cares away.    One downside is that there was nothing to really absorb sound, so there was a constant buzzing in the air with all the folks enjoying an afternoon of tea sandwiches, desserts, and hot beverages.  I always have coffee at these monthly afternoon teas & the tea ladies do not hold it against me (PHEW!). As I mentioned above, I sometimes take things that are not mine & man was I sorely tempted here.  There were so many nice touches at the tea that I had not encountered at other teas.  Here is a list of things I wanted: *glass long tube with 6 divots for sugar...there was 6 different types of sugar (it was great). *an hour glass item with 3 different settings so you can have tea the way you like it.  Oh man, I so wanted to through that thing in my purse. *wooden boxes that contained jars of teas something like 8 different kinds.  The jars were open so you could smell the different types. *the bamboo tray that the treats & sandwiches out on. *the spoon holder. *the honey jar...if you saw it, you would understand. Alright before you start thinking me an awful person, I did not steal anything but as you can see, they really went to town on the atmosphere & table service.  Speaking of service, the staff was attentive without being overbearing.  They were available for questions & any items that were needed, but they did not rush us or make us feel unwanted.  Now the food was alright (so-so if you will) and it pains me to say it since I really wanted to love it.  The pastries while nice, where not fabulous and the tea sandwiches were decent (there are better to be had at other places).  My hope is that Café Des Architectes will work out what type of sandwiches & pastries. While I loved my time here, I think you should know that this service does not come cheap.  It is $30 per person...that is rather a steep price for what is offered.  There are many other places that offer stellar afternoon teas for that price (or a little less).  Not sure if I would come back for tea at that price, but if a deal is offered, then for sure. One last nice touch is that each of us received a cardboard box containing a cherry & goat cheese tart as a parting treat...so that pushed this 3 star experience to a 4 star one.  It is the little things people.",0.9954,0.792,0.144,0.064,0.5612721417069244
2012-01-15,4.0,"Cafe Des Architectes offers an afternoon tea (which appears to be relatively new, as there was nothing written about it before the Living Social deal was offered in November '11 and only the most vague info on their website now).  Anyway, a $15 tea was too good of a deal to pass up, so a bunch of us grabbed the deal and went yesterday to check it out. First up, the tea service is not held in the main dining room.  Which made me a little sad at first, because the restaurant looked just lovely.  We were shown instead to what seems to be a private dining room just off the lounge area.  While not as nice, it is a comfortable, modern room with a wall of windows that look onto the street.   Interesting details about this tea that I have not seen at other places: -there is a long glass tube with indents along one side, and it holds about 6 different sugars.  You have to ask which is which, since it is not marked, but it is a conversation starter for sure and fun to experiment with each type.   -there is an hourglass with 3 settings on the table that will time your brewing of the tea for you.  The green one is for weak tea, the white is the recommended time, and the red is for strong tea.  Very helpful since once I get talking I tend to lose track of time. -they bring out a wooden box with all the teas inside so you can see and smell each one, which does make for an easier time selecting (rather than blindly choosing based on the name).  I went for the Sencha Scent of the Mountain, which was a lovely, mild green tea. -the treats come out arranged on a bamboo tray rather than the traditional stacked plate holder.  I wish there had been a menu given to us, or it listed on the website, because I would have liked to remember what each of the items we had were.  I know for the sweets there was a tiny creme puff, one was a purple macaron, one was a lemon/chocolate petit four and something that tasted like a firm whipped creme within a pastry shell.  The savory items were a prosciutto on toast, a salmon puff and a cucumber something on bread. Service was attentive, but not overbearing.  When asked for certain things (like milk or more hot water), it was brought promptly.   I love afternoon tea and am glad I had a chance to experience a slightly different take on it.",0.9952,0.826,0.146,0.027,0.522968034381078

We enjoyed the white tea and the Darjeeling.  The bites to eat are exactly that. Little more than a bite each. Some were good (prosciutto bite and the macaroon), but mostly they were forgettable. The Salmon paste was flavorful, but was placed atop a thoroughly bland and dry bit of bread/pastry.  The LivingSocial deal made it worthwhile, but if you are looking for something more than two cups of tea and snack, the Café Des Architectes simply will not do. Consider tea at the Peninsula hotel if you are looking for a tea-centric midday MEAL. More expensive ($50), but worth ever penny. Unfortunately, I can't quite say the same for our experience here.

The steaming cups are usually accompanied by huge and heavy meals. Not that there is anything wrong with that, but I've always longed to feel prim and proper, to see how the other 1% lives. Enter Café Des Architectes and LivingSocial. Lori L, Josh V and I purchased a deal on LivingSocial. It was $15 for the $30 Afternoon Tea on Saturday. I was super excited and took the opportunity to wear a dress with sweater and flats. It wasn't exactly formal, but I didn't feel too out of place. The café is located inside the Sofitel hotel and business casual fit right in. The afternoon tea service included two cups worth of your pick of tea. I went with the Pomegranate Oolong and tried Lori's Paris black tea. Both were superb and went well with the 7 light bites and shortbread starters. The shortbread came in two varieties, Lemon and Sage. The mini sandwiches and pastries were perfect. I'm probably going to butcher what they were, but here goes my best shot: 1) Buttered toast with cream cheese, cucumber and olives. 2) Puff pastry topped with a smoked salmon-crème fraiche mix and caviar. 3) Toast with prosciutto. 4) Chocolate covered éclair with passion fruit cream filling. 5) Macaroon. 6) Puff pastry topped with pistachio cream, mini macaroons and an alcohol-infused cranberry. 7) Egg yolk-filled cookie cup with vanilla bean cream topping. I loved everything. I think for $30 it is affordable as an occasional treat and it was definitely worth every penny of the $15 we paid for the deal. When the bill came it was all taken care of except for the tax, which was about $5 for the 3 of us.

Now for the best part- FOODIES! We each ordered different entrees: the rabbit, the lamb and the seared tuna. All three had their distinct style. The lamb was delicious and went so well with a pumpkin puree- deeming an amazing savory and sweet taste. The rabbit was extremely interesting- cooked in three different ways (mmmm!). The tuna was seared perfectly and despite the size of the fish piece-- it was surprisingly filling! We ended the night with the petit dessert platter- which came with madeleines, a macaron with raspberry couli, a mini creme brulee, a mini hazelnut-marshmallow cake and a mini valrhona/espresso cake.

Here in America, apparently we do it a little differently...Normally  this tea service is $30.00, but with the living social deal it was $15. It includes one pot of tea per person and a tray of savory and sweet items, each person gets one piece of each item.  The ambiance in the restaurant is great, but unfortunately, this tea service needs to iron out some of the kinks. For the living social price, it's a good deal in theory. For the full price, no way. First of all, only one pot of tea per person? Wait, where am I? What is this? ...cause I thought it was Afternoon TEA! How about hooking me up with as much tea as I want, it's TEA, not gold!  Secondly, there were way too many sweet options and very teenie tiny savory options. 4 out of the 6 items were sweet.  Not to mention, the savory options were miniscule....the smoked salmon puff pastry was DELICIOUS, but it was the size of a nickle and the smoked salmon was the size of a dime...come on people?!  Stop nickle and diming me! I know tea time shouldn't qualify as a meal, but one cannot survive on sugar alone! The sweet options were on the whole well-made, but I felt completely sick after eating hardly any savory options and all that sugar. I wish I had some more tea to wash all this sugar and creme down...but sorry, no cigar.  I will say the variety of different sugars (raw, rock, cane, etc.) on the table to accompany the tea was a nice touch, and the teas they carried were interesting and of good quality. The shortbread cookies, Sage and Lemon, were also amazingly buttery and delicious. Unfortunately I just will not be re-visiting Cafe Des Architectes for tea again until they: 1. Offer more tea for afternoon tea... 2. Offer a more reasonable proportion of savory items 3. The sweet items should have more variety, consider more substantial items like scones as opposed to the same creme/fillings/goo just in different forms and colors.",0.9941,0.793,0.155,0.053,0.5657542457542458

2011-09-28,5.0,"Still fantastic. I think CdA is a restaurant one should experience every season, as the menu changes radically, but always manages to match the weather, food and emotional expectation of the month of dining. Standouts from my most recent meal: Hum cocktail - Hum will always be delicious. In anything. Pair it with fizzy, fruity liquids and you have a winner each and every time. Went down like water. Hit me in the head like Oscar de la Hoya in a wig and fishnets. Sweet Potato Gnocchi - roasted garlic cream and lemon confit make this dish a delight to the tastebuds. I am not at all a fan of the sweet potato (blame Thanksgiving + marshmallows + pineapple + canned yams; hate the stuff) but, for some reason, gnocchi will class just about anything up enough for me to try it. This is an appetizer and is an appetizer portion, but the dish is rich enough that it's surprisingly filling. Beware in a good way. Guinea Hen - this is the second time I have eaten it and I am still not sure about what differentiates it from regular ol' chicken... but whatever it is, I like it. The protein was prepared with maitake mushrooms and boursin polenta. Combine these flavors with every bite. Cut the meat up into little bites and run it through the veggies if you must, but it's not an accident that these profiles were paired with one another. I haven't enjoyed a poultry dish this much in quite some time. Fruit soup - I am too done. Fruit soup? For real? Served cold and with a spoon made up of sugar that you can eat? I apologize to all the members of the Red Hat club I ran out on to Michigan Avenue to slap because this was so good. I couldn't help myself. Service was prompt, professional and delightful as always. I don't have anything negative to say. The fact that CdA could effortlessly transition from one chef to another without the slightest upset to the tongue or overall experience goes to the strength of the concept and the steeliness of the brand. I may only get here once a season but I know that each time I do, it will be an experience to remember and relish.",0.9961,0.769,0.186,0.046,0.5451566951566951
2011-09-25,5.0,"This is the magical story of four ladies who treated M for a birthday dinner. We were truly pampered by the phenomenal service offered by Cafe Des Architectes. The food was inventive and burst with complex flavors. With that introduction, let me tell you my tale.  I waited in the bar area and mused over the drink menu. Two cocktails caught my eye: the Bee's Knees and the Old Fashioned. I asked the server if they were martinis. No, they're not, but they'd be happy to make them into martinis just for me. In fact, he offered to bring me mini versions of each! I was afraid that double fisting would give off a lush impression so I said that I would start with the Bee's Knees and get the Old Fashioned later.  I was still sipping the Bee's Knees as all of us assembled in the bar. Another server gathered our glasses on a tray and carried them for us to the table. It was so nice to seamlessly transition from bar to table. We did not have to worry about paying for our drinks there or anything. What a treat.  One of my friends noticed the five-course tasting menu for $75. We were interested, but a little nervous since one friend is vegetarian. The server didn't know if that was okay and said that he'd ask the chef for us. Despite having a large wedding in the banquet hall upstairs, the chef came out and discussed the five-course tasting menu with us! I was absolutely delighted. Four of us agreed to the five-course menu and my vegetarian friend chose a single appetizer and entree.  While seated, I finished my Bee's Knees. A server silently removed it from the table (and without a word) replaced it with the Old Fashioned martini! I didn't even have to ask for it!  One of my friends realized that her iPhone no longer had a charge. She asked a server if they happened to have a charger and they brought one to her! Between the chef, my martinis, and now this charger, this place earned it's 5-star rating even before we ate any of the food. Seriously.  We each took turns going to the bathroom. The bathroom is on the second floor and has about six alcoves within it with lots of mirrors. It felt a bit like Alice in Wonderland for me, but in a very positive, surreal way. It was constantly clean (a cleaning person was nearby at all times) and the flowers near the basin were fresh, beautiful, and fragrant.  Finally, our food was delicious. I loved trying different foods, but that's really not for everybody. M conceded that she would rather simply have an appetizer and entree, but was also pleased with the food in general. What was most impressive about the food is that the chef sent out extra little plates for our vegetarian friend to give her nibbles while everyone else was working on other plates. At the end of our meal I was satisfied, but M was still hungry. She thought that having an entree would have been more filling than lots of small plates.  M was so pleased with her experience at Cafe Des Architectes for her birthday dinner that she vowed to return the very next day for the New York Strip Steak dinner!

All I can say is, once again, the staff of the Sofitel exceeded my expectations. They literally never say no. I had a mimosa, and the egg white omelette and lots of lovely pastries and fruit. All for $27? How worth it is that? Granted, I was witness to a lot of pretension on the part of the guests but Sofitel can't help whom it attracts.

We selected the 7 course tasting menu with the wine pairing.  Here's where it got really cool:  My GF and I each had different dishes all the way through the meal!  So we got to sample about 13 different dishes throughout the meal (only the cheese plate was in common)!  A very novel and fun approach.  Sara was pretty impressed that they selected Diver Scallop and Duck Breast for her which are two of her all time favorites.  How did they know?  :-) As the meal progressed we were just blown away by not just the freshness of the ingredients and the wonderful tastes, but also how Chef Biggers harmonized each dish with the next so that it was a wonderful tapestry of flavors.  Each dish seemed to compliment the previous one and almost serve as a prelude to the next dish as well.  The crescendo for me was the pan seared crusted pork loin which was to die for.  It was perfectly seasoned, wonderfully prepared and the complementary flavors from the puree and veggies was delicious.   The other great thing was that we had 7 courses but didn't leave stuffed to the point of discomfort, the dishes were full of flavor but not heavy, just light, fresh fresh fresh and tremendously satisfying.  In my mind this is how it should be done.   The wines were solid although not superstars and the portion sizes were just okay.  I would've paid more for a stronger wine list and more generous pours!   The decor is great, a very chic modern design and comfy tables.  The service throughout the night was amazing, very attentive on all counts, knowledgeable and friendly.  As a nice touch, Chef Biggers came by to ask how everything was at the end of the meal.  I think the CDA should feel lucky to have him, he's doing great work here. So, does CDA deserve the same rating as Les Nomandes or Alinea?  No, but it's not really fair to compare them as those are in a different category and certainly far more expensive.  However, CDA earned five stars from me because they provide honest, approachable, FRESH and delicious food with impeccable service & fabulous decor for a reasonable price.  Well done, CDA, I'm a big fan.",0.9992,0.698,0.276,0.026,0.6284202569916856

Came back here for Christmas eve where they had a pre fixe dinner 3 courses with amuse and petit fours for $65/person.  Not as impressed. I've been a huge chaser of the michelin guide hub-bub so I wanted to see why this great chef didn't get any love.  The food: - the foie amuse was probably a highlight.  Creamy, light yet still rich and paired with a fig jam. Only thing is the brioche underneath was done so ahead of time that it was slightly soggy.  - scallop appetizer:  the scallop itself was best of quality, a bit over salted but rather that than under. Perfect sear and cooked well. The hedgehog mushroom was the best part!  So delicious and paired well with the scallop. The cauliflower didn't add anything to the plate. There was also frisee and tomato chunks on the plate. The frisee was pretty but too bitter for the plate and I guess tomato for acid but I didn't like the flavor combo.  - duck with fennel brocolini:  the duck was medium rare but they should have been sliced thinner because the bigger chunks still were not tender enough even though it was cooked medium rare. The fennel gave a good texture but it should have been dressed!  No flavor at all - dessert: Bouche de Noel: was pretty solid. the peppermint was masked in small this round bites scattered on the plate.  not a bad modern version. - petit fours:  enjoyed more than the dessert, gelee and truffle, yum. ultimately the last thing that put me below 4 stars for this experience was the service.  overall not bad, but a miss at times.  our waiter was very nice, but not overly attentive to the details.  nice but rough around the edges.    nice but not special enough for xmas dinner.",0.9967,0.742,0.22,0.038,0.6204837490551777

The quality of the food has always been very good, befitting to the standards of Sofitel where the restaurant is located. The food here always seemed like they have been well thought out by the chef. Starting with the basket of breads, there were raisin bread, baguette, and focaccia. A small serving of olive spread is given with the breads. The olive spread was just pure olive goodness. We've tried many different items on the menu and they have been consistently very good. The flatiron steak was tender and well prepared. The tuna tartare was delicious that I ate it on its own without the crisp bread slices that came with it just so I could savor the pure goodness of it. Besides the ala carte menu, they always offer a 3-course prix fixe option. The service here has also been consistently good.

My hostess quickly corrected and offered to let me move down one, but later on in the night, another hostess sat a 2-top right next to me when there were plenty of other tables.

The Chilean Sea Bass was perfectly done as well. Really nice sauce underneath the small, but perfect portion. for dessert, I opted for a vanilla custard with some sort of fruit on top. It was ok.

It is a beautiful space - lighting is glorious. We had to bump into the chef to get to our table - he was greeting all the diners personally and came around again later on. The three course prix fixe meal was splendid. First came an 'amuse bouche' of a tiny bit of braised vegetables and chorizo - it was so tiny and tasty. We had the beef tenderloin & the fish entrees, both were beautiful. The flavors were satisfyingly traditional, yet with some nicely fresh twists in the vegetables garnish & sauces that highlighted the dishes. Our appetizers ( a salad and a diver scallop) were splendid too. The scallop was one of the best appetizers I have ever tasted. Desserts were fine - we were full by this time so I don't know if I was underwhelmed because of that. We had a ""baked alaska"" that seemed like a good idea, but the spongy cake on the bottom didn't quite make it. This was the only thing that wasn't just excellent. The chocolate pistachio dome dessert was terrific though. The service was great. Our waiter was a young fellow who was knowledgeable; very kind and attentive. We had ordered a bottle of Puligny-Montrachet that turned out to be ""corked."" (we weren't too sure - it honestly had never happened to either of us, so we were a bit insecure about sending it back, but the waiter had the bartender taste it, and they agreed. We tried a second bottle of the same and sheepishly sent it back too - same problem. We were able to find a good choice, but were pleased by how 'not a big deal' this was for the server and it actually was almost amusing. (though sad to see that much what-ought-to-be good wine go down the drain!)

2010-04-15,4.0,"Our experience at Cafe Des Architectes was only a partial experience, but we enjoyed the taste we had. We only experienced part of the menu, because it was Restaurant Week.  They had a standard prix fixe, with certain items from the regular menu available as upgrades.  This is an irresistible opportunity for me, as my love for dinner upgrades is exceeded only by my love for travel upgrades.  I heartily recommend the duck confit appetizer - its one of the best I've had, with a well sized duck leg that melts in your mouth.  Its almost a meal in and of itself.  Of course, we didn't stop there - I upgraded to the rack of lamb, and Kelly upgraded to the Delmonico steak, both of which exceeded our expectations.  Desserts, too, were superb, as was the French press coffee. Taking a look at the menu currently online, I see that CDA varies its menu seasonally, so you may have to wait until the fall for the duck confit and rack of lamb, but the options currently available will undoubtedly satisfy. But what of the restaurant itself?  As I said above, we did not experience it fully  -- on that Saturday night, a server was sick, (for Restaurant Week?  Mon Dieu!) and in response they closed off part of the restaurant (it did feel small).  But, our taste of the decor was complete.  The atmosphere at CDA is clubby and romantic - dark walls, low lighting, with a white banquette to create visual contrast.  It is more of a French Mag Mile restaurant than a French Bistro.  This dark sleekness is an extension of the dark sleekness of the hotel, the Sofitel.  Personally, I felt that the decor of the Sofitel was too dark and dated, in an 80s style.  But if you are looking for a Mag Mile / Streeterville type experience, rather than a country bistro, a la La Sardine or Kiki's or Bistrot Zinc, CDA fits the bill. And a final note, for by Bourbon boozer friends, the bar in the Sofitel has Templeton Rye, and makes excellent manhattans.  Note that the bar in the restaurant does not have Templeton, but my server sent my order over to the bar for fulfillment -- make sure yours does the same.",0.9965,0.819,0.164,0.017,0.45577324722061574

Our lovely French waiter could not have been kinder & I followed his directions to the T. Belgium Endive Salad? Sure! Flat Iron steak? Um, yes please! Praline crunch? Oh...I suppose I will.  The salad came out in an edible bowl. Love it. The variety of greens was fabulous & the light dressing only made it more delicious. The blue cheese was very delicious & I don't even like blue cheese! It was quite a decent portion for a salad & I made sure to enjoy each & every bite. The steak came out after & was delicious. It was a bit rarer than I like, but I ate it all up. I didn't even care. The mushrooms & potatoes that the strips of steak were so beautifully arranged on were 100% complimentary. Nothing stole the show, it was a collaborative effort. Finally, the dessert. Oh my Lord. It was sort of a  mousse, but was was in perfect rectangles. They sat on a bed of crunchy delicious & had crunch teeny flakes of pralines inside of the mousse. A delicious, crunchy, carmel-y rice krispie sat on top. Um, this was heaven in a dessert. I want to bring everyone & anyone back for this deal.

I dined at the Cafe last night for restaurant week.  I'm not a french food aficionado, but I've been dabbling since I got a Julia Child cook book and since I went to Cyrano's for independent restaurant week. I got news for you- the Shepherd's pie was AMAZING.  Tender, juicy beef so cooked down the meat was almost reduced to gravy, topped with smooth buttery mashed potatoes.  Its not French, but the ""French"" did make it amazing.  The soup was good- i would say basic except for the lovely plating they did.  The duck was ok- I'm not a duck eater- I don't like the ""slimy/greasy"" texture in general, but I thought there was a lot of flavor in this preparation. I wasn't too fond of the main course- I thought that the white fish had a lot of interesting elements used with a lot of character in each, but I didn't like the way they all went together.  Same for the chicken.  The steak was my favorite- my friend ordered it medium and it was tender and juicy.  Medium rare would have been even better.  The gnocchi were also very good- I'm used to heavier Italian gnocchi.  I really enjoyed the light cloud like texture of the French execution. I was thrilled with my desert- I had seen terrible looking faded pictures of Julia Child's version in my vintage cookbook.....what arrived to the table was much different!  Lovely light texture of the meringue, creamy sauce and delightful sweet crunchy little almonds essential to each bite.  Pure delight! I do want to go back and try the full menu sometime to see what other large plates they have.  The service was very good and I enjoyed their dining room and having the door opened by the charming doorman.  They really need to put some wheels on those seats....no graceful way to get up from the table when you are butt scooting your seat that is hopelessly stuck on the carpet.  So, perhaps they'll earn a few more stars back on the return visit.",0.9976,0.739,0.211,0.05,0.4640492063492062

The atmosphere was classy and calming, while remaining interesting at every glance. The menu is limited, but I assume it's always changing. The prices were slightly high but reasonable for the unique nature of each dish. Everything was overall delightful. The presentation was slightly more pleasing than the overall flavor, which was by no means disappointing. My one complaint was the overpowering truffle flavor in everything. Our caesar and beet salads and cauliflower soups were light but perfectly composed. My Ahí Tuna over spring green garnished ratatouille was the most disappointing as I don't think I was truly in the mood for it. The beef tenderloin and rib tips were outstanding.  Then came dessert, and this is the one course you should not miss. It was delicious and rich, while not being overly heavy.  The evening was topped off by the matradee who, after retrieving our coats and thoughtfully placing them out of our way when we left, bent to one knee and serenaded us with a french tune on a whim.

Waitstaff were wonderful, attentive, sweet--being French and having accents I think helps. There is definitely attention to detail--serving pretty food with grace is how I'd describe it. I got the prix fixe they do for dinner on Sundays thru Tuesdays. All for about $30 a person, but don't quote me on that. My meal consisted of creamy cauliflower soup, walleye pike (from website, pike includes: manila clams, flageolet beans, basil puree) for entree, and crispy praline something or other for dessert.  The soup was smooth, a bit bland, but improved slightly with the buttery brioche. The pike was perfectly cooked and beautifully presented, but the manila clams tasted like tiny little flavorless mussels. The basil puree didn't have much punch either. If I cooked the entree at home I'd be kind of impressed with myself, but at a restaurant, I want to be wowed. Dessert was a bit of a disappointment, but as part of the meal package I guess it was what I paid for.

I was praying that it would be a good experience and it absolutely was, without  a doubt, one of the best brunches anyone of us has ever had!!! Luckily, as suspected, it wasn't the usual, unsanitary brunch buffet but a very impressive menu with a great variety of plates to chose from. It was a gorgeous Saturday afternoon so it was nice that we got seated, somewhat promptly, outside on their patio. It did take our hostess quite awhile to seat us, (boy was she taking her sweet time walking back and forth to help get our table set up). It was a site to see! I'm just glad she wasn't a waitress! My future father-in-law ordered the eggs benedict and said, I quote, ""these are the best eggs benedict I've ever had and I've had a lot of eggs benedict in my lifetime""!  My future mother-in-law and I ordered the ahi tuna salads served with a very tasty mustard vinaigrette and they were huge and so fresh! I was expecting a very small portion of the ahi tuna since it's such a delicacy but the portion was more than generous and it left me satisfied and full for the rest of the afternoon.  My fiancé ordered the crepes and loved them and his brother ordered an omelet that he seemed to really enjoy. I can't leave out the amazing and obviously very fresh, complimentary croissant and pastry basket! My fiancé's mom wanted to take the leftover basket items with her for our trip to the beach!!

The fresh grounds were still in it but once you pushed this contraption down, the liquid rose to the top leaving the grounds compressed. Wow! Yes, this is a pretty pricey place to have brunch but it was very well worth it. It's definitely a place to try once and I can almost guarantee you'll be back for more!

I'm typically over the moon when there is a non-chocolate dessert available. This dessert was the best combo of my favorite dessert: non-chocolate and sweet. Add in the almonds and it was ideal.

It was the most delicious salad I've ever had (it had candied walnuts, pear, blue cheese, mixed greens, a sweet dressing, held together in a thinly fried pastry sheet shaped into a bowl). Great presentation. As an entree we had the hanger steak and braised short rib. Super soft meat with a savory sauce. And for dessert we ordered the coconut crunch which is basically lime curd, coconut milk, and pineapple on the side. It was delicious! Prior to the meal, we were served complimentary bread with butter and another tasty concoction. It was blended olives, jalepeno, cilantro, and some other tasty ingredients. Soooo good. The service was awesome. From the bus boy to the water boy to the waiter to the hostess. Everyone provided great customer service! My only complaint is the location of the restrooms. You have to walk out of the restaurant, past the lobby, take the elevator upstairs to the 2nd floor, and then when you find the bathroom, they architecturally designed it into a maze (at least the ladies restrooms were).

My only complaint was that the dessert came out with the other plates- but at my request the server quickly removed the other dishes so I could enjoy my dessert.   The dining room was smaller than I expected- while we did not need the 2 person reservation we had for lunch, I could see it getting quite crowed for dinner.  Our server was great and was very excited to recommend the restaurant week menu.  It appears they do a similar type offering regularly for lunch, even if its not restaurant week.  Food came out very quickly as if they were conscious about it being a work lunch- but we did not feel rushed either.  It looks like the do $30 prix fixe menu on Sunday and Monday nights- I think I will be back to check this out in the near future.",0.9924,0.835,0.156,0.009,0.5172134238310707

2009-01-01,4.0,"I came to Cafe des Architectes for a NYE dinner with family and friends. I have only eaten a French meal one other time, so I wanted to visit more restaurants.I went to grad school at Loyola down the street, so I would pass this place all the time. It always looked modern and swanky, so I was excited to see what it had to offer. The hotel is beautiful and the restaurant was impeccably presented with great lighting, a beautiful tablescape and great overall ambiance.  Food: There was a prix-fix e menu with 5 courses and an a la carte option. The prix-fixe was $85, but my sample wine-flight (5 options of  3 reds, whites, or champagne)  with appetizer, entree and dessert off the a la carte menu, were cumulatively cheapter than that .  The food however was pretty succulent, no complaints here ;-)  I had the Mushroom veloute soup which was divine! The rack of lamp was delicious, but this chef interpreted medium well more pink than I'm used to. I finished with the Chocolate Pistachio Dome. The meal was very very rich but I love savory food so no disappointments. I sampled food off the prix-fixe menu my sis ate, there were items on that menu that weren't available a la carte, the short ribs with foie gras was exquisite!  Service: The service is what downgrades my 5 star review to 4 stars because it was problematic. We spent over 3 hours here, with a 2:1 ratio of waiting for our food vs. eating. We ran through two bread baskets (had to refuse the 3rd, we wanted our food!) and the chef sent out a beet salad with goat cheese to apologize for the wait. For spending this kind of money, I expect the service to be on par with the food, which it was not here.  Overall:  Definitely great food, ambiance and location. The hotel service is top notch, you can valet your car for free if you're eating dinner (unheard of downtown) and the bathrooms are very cute.

Given that it is located inside the Sofitel, Cafe Des Architectes caters to a lot of business customers and tourists, which was readily apparent during our meal.  Some people don't like places like that; I personally don't mind as long as the food and service is good.  If you're looking for a fancy dinner out with top notch service, I would highly recommend giving Cafe Des Architectes a look.",0.99,0.79,0.193,0.016,0.5715455304928989
2008-08-13,4.0,"I took the opportunity to try the special four-course lunch tasting menu here, which goes for $20.98. I had been to the bar before for after work drinks and hors d'oeuvres, and the place is on my list for that particular activity. Great spot to take clients. If I had any... I chose to dine inside. Even though the weather was perfect for dining al fresco, I am not fond of their outdoor tables. Without any sort of greenery, it feels like sitting in a parking lot. Besides, the dining room, with its high ceilings and dramatic hanging lamps makes for a much better ambiance. And there was more of a crowd inside. I found the service overall to be gracious and friendly. Not too much swelling of the attitudinal glands. I was seated promptly, handed a beautiful and tasty bread basket with a variety of bread worthy of the French. From then on, there was a nice ""team"" approach to service, as one of four or five might bring you a drink, your meal, more water, etc. The servers all seemed very European. One of them when I asked about what appeared to be olive tapenade with the bread basket assured me that yes it was green olives and ""leetle feeshes"" (or anchovies.) In fact, all the servers lent a particular feel to the place. They all seemed like extras from ""Young Frankenstein""  or that ""Rocky Horror"" movie. And I mean that in most loving and supportive way :-). Great casting of dining room staff!  En plus, there was a large group of  French business people having lunch near me, and one guy in particular with slicked back hair, a too-small silver PeeWee Herman suit and dress shoes with no socks, who although he was talking business, was really trying to seduce every woman at his table. It seemed so ""Paree.""  I found the food to be French-worthy, too. For the tasting, you choose one item from each of three categories of appetizer, salad, main course, and the dessert is pre-chosen for you. The choices are excellent. They could just try to pawn off cheap stuff like sausages, charcuteries, plain greens, but they don't. I had a cold carrot soup, which was a bright yellow, but didn't taste too much like carrots- more like squash, but it was a nice starter. Then I had a salad of sliced fresh cooked shrimp with cabbage and fennel. Absolutely delicious in flavor and pleasing in texture. The main event was  grilled Mahi-Mahi on a bed of sweetly-cooked and seasoned red cabbage, topped with a tasty and eye-pleasing garnish. The fish was cooked to perfection. Dessert consisted of  a tablespoon-size glob of chocolate mousse and a small tart with chocolate filling and berries. The entire tasting is brought to you at once on a large square plate with four smaller 4"" x 4"" plates, so you could start with dessert if you wanted too. I thought the portions were very adequate, and again French-worthy. I walked away sated but not too full (I kept myself from eating the entire bread basket, which was difficult, as I have never met a carb I didn't like.) I would definitely recommend this tasting menu. It's a great value. And eating at Les Architectes is fun and elegant.",0.9974,0.818,0.162,0.02,0.5298849878934624

Hard to say"".  It ended up being about 10-15, so I guess she was right on target - although how could she not be, with that spread.   The place is pricey.  Belgian Waffles/Pancakes for about $12 and Egg-based entrees for about $17.  The menu was creative, they had interesting options beyond the norm.  I had to keep reminding myself that these prices included a basket of pastries, juice, and coffee/tea.  I had the Belgian Waffle.  It was topped with berry compote & whipped cream.  The blueberries seemed like they could have been fresh, but the strawberries seemed like they had been frozen; I would have preferred all fresh fruit.  My friend had the egg white/spinach/mushroom souflee.  It was very nicely presented in a pool of tomato sauce and topped with fried potatoes.  She said if you were the type who likes the yolks, you wouldn't like it.  If you're an egg-white-sort-of-a-person, it's delish. The service was good, but they seemed to be using a team approach.  We got approached by one man for drink orders, a few minutes later a lady came up to try to take drink orders,  after receiving our drinks  a different man came to take our food orders, then two more people ended up bringing our food.  While all were very nice, I couldn't tell you which of these people, if any, were our ""official"" server.   BOTTOM LINE:  If you're looking for a fancy pants sort of breakfast with innovative menu items, this is the place.",0.9946,0.828,0.162,0.01,0.5673363095238094
2007-10-26,5.0,"I am a connoisseur of French food; I own a bistro myself. This is one of the best places I've ever eaten at. The service was impeccable; the food superb (not a lot of vegetarian options, but I'll be back for the same romaine lettuce and butter squash dishes).  There were 4 of us on a Friday night and I can't tell you how delightful it was for all of us. Expensive? yes but very worth it. I must add there were about 6 cosmopolitans, a glass of Pinot Noir and three gins, so that adds to the bill.  This is really a French place because the decoration, the portions, the taste were absolutely out of this world. I will be back for sure.  I don't understand how anyone can give this place less than 4 stars at the least... Perhaps they changed managers or owners or chefs, I don't know but October 2007, it was fantastic. My palate will be forever grateful. FREE VALET and a gorgeous Sofitel hotel.",0.9915,0.783,0.217,0.0,0.5189766081871345
2007-09-29,4.0,"Chic, French & Inoffensive (which isn't an easy balance). I went here with a friend who was visiting from out of town, and we both agreed it was one of the best brunches we've had in some time. The pastry basket was filled with wonderful flaky croissants--a mix of plain & chocolate-filled. We were starving but the menu had so many enticing options we had to send the (very understanding & helpful) server back... twice. They have a 4-or 5-course brunch sampler that we decided to share. Each of the courses was scrumptious and there was a good balance between sweet and savory items. The French-press coffee was also quite good. I was surprised that the prices were reasonable, especially given the area, restaurant & complexity of menu items. The service was outstanding,   and the atmosphere is well-suited for an upscale brunch.",0.9866,0.745,0.232,0.023,0.588467261904762
2007-06-25,3.0,"Trendy but tasteful; creative but not over-the-top. Note: the restaurant manager has just changed, and this may considerably impact the service and atmosphere. Service is pretty much always excellent -Geoffrey is *the* act (he hails from Kenya and speaks five or six languages fluently), but the other waiters are usually really nice too, including the very much telenovela-hero-like Mexican. The ambience is distinctly different in the morning, for lunch and at dinner. In the weekday mornings, quite a few business breakfasts in addition to the hotel guests', but usually not too busy. The breakfast items *are* delicious, even if what makes the ""viennoiserie"" (croissants, pains au chocolat, etc.) ""authentically Parisian"" is what I like the least about it -its slight dryness. The smoothie flight (perhaps not on the menu, but you can usually order it anyway) is not to be missed, while the fresh glass of orange juice is bottomless. This is perhaps one of the best values still available -the Architectes so far have always introduced new delicious things as a bargain (the $1 a piece mini-desserts are a good example) before making them super-expensive as soon as it becomes popular. Brunch on the weekends is in some ways even more amazing than breakfast, and you should definitely try the brunch sampler at least once -but make sure you're hungry and have some time. The lunch menu is very decent; the sampler menu, one of those once-upon-a-time-very-affordable items, is an excellent choice for a relatively fast and balanced lunch. It is prepared in 30 minutes max, and consists of four little plates aesthetically disposed on a larger one: one appetiser, one small salad, one main course and a couple of mini-desserts. The portions appear to be terribly small, but, especially with the addition of the gorgeous in-house baked bread, this is a very filling lunch and one that leaves your palate as well as your healthy conscience satisfied. Dinner is more formal and costly, but the dishes are amazing. The wine list, unfortunately, is execrable -I hear it's a corporate decision from Sofitel- however after a while you may be able to talk your way to some of their unlisted wines. UPDATE: It's been a year since Fabien, the former restaurant manager who brought the Architectes to such a high standard, has left; and it's been a year in which we haven't gone back to the Sofitel. Our recent experience confirms our worst fears: service has gone done considerably, and the food, if still decent, has lost any originality (the same things were on the menu when we had last frequented the place). Too bad.",0.9969,0.755,0.185,0.06,0.5426206509539842
2007-06-13,5.0,"The best breakfast in town. period. Cant beat the selection of baked goods that comes with any Egg-celent order. using real butter, chocolate Croissant is used with real dark chocolate, with over %50 of Chocolate-solids, i would say. its a great taste of europe, here in Chicago-land. to top that, good coffee and free fresh orange juice... what else does one need to start a hedonistic weekend?

2007-04-30,4.0,"Meeting at the Sofatel for cocktails at 7:30 on a Friday night, we found the hotel bar to be packed with plenty of smokers and no seats.  So, we made our way over to the Cafe Des Architechtes bar to have some drinks.  The bar has about 5 seats and then there are 4 tables in the bar as well.  Nice bartenders...excellent drinks...Overall, we had a great time.  We ordered this combo of apps at the bar, and it was pretty good food.  The chicken satay was excellent...really good, tasty, tender chicken with a great peanut sauce.  The other apps in the platter were good, but not that memorable.  While we didn't order dinner, they kept passing us on the way from the kitchen and the food looked and smelled outstanding.  We did have dessert that looked so good that we took a picture of it.  It was pretty good to eat.  So, don't be telling too many people about this, but I think it's a great place to meet for drinks early in the night (by the time we left, it was a full house) and probably to have dinner as well.",0.9896,0.798,0.195,0.008,0.6875000000000001

2007-02-06,2.0,"It's beautiful and all in here, but the service wasn't the greatest (we weren't greeted at the door; in fact, we waited a few minutes until a man in a suit seated us) and neither was the food.  You feel elegant sitting in here, and you pay the price to sit in such a swanky restaurant.  I paid $17 for a salad, and the entrees were $30+.  And if I remember correctly, the carpeting felt too plush for a restaurant; it made me uncomfortable eating in there, like I would ruin the carpet if I spilled.  I probably won't be coming back here.",-0.7977,0.758,0.089,0.153,0.6571428571428571
2006-12-22,3.0,"Innovative French inspired food. The space is a little austere with bold red accents and a lot of white and black with high dramatic ceilings.  Architecturally this place is definitely distinctive, but not warm. The food is very good and innovative with a few glitches.  I had the arugula/spinach salad with goat cheese and it was very heavy on spinach that was the heavy variety. For my entree, I had the tuna which was high grade tuna, but the sides while well prepared weren't very flavorful.  Attentive service, decent wine flights, good value, and a great location make this a restaurant worth visiting.",0.9854,0.689,0.294,0.017,0.5098550724637682
2006-05-22,4.0,"A very vibrantly decorated French-influenced restaurant located in the lobby of the Sofitel hotel. The food here is very good, and often the presentation of the dishes is on par with their quality. In particular the rack of lamb was very tasty, and the chocolate cake with a side of pineapples was unique and pleasantly surprising. The only thing preventing a 5-star rating was the service. Our meal managed to take just over two hours and fifteen minutes. This did not seem to be the standard, as we saw many other tables seated and finished before we had the opportunity to pay for our meal.",0.8687,0.865,0.112,0.023,0.5221666666666667
2005-08-25,5.0,"This boldly designed restaurant with a French flair is attached to the glamorous Sofitel hotel. The architectural theme extends to the black-and-white images of buildings around the world, and the paper napkin rings roll out as rulers. The menu is interesting and seems to change every time I dine here. The best dishes include three versions of a meat type (I ate duck, and the guy at the next table had beef) with a side dish, and these items are served in four different square plates. Conceptually this is like that Pizza Hut thing with four small pizzas in one box, but the difference is that the food here is GOOD. The presentation of the food is very artistic, and where else can you get a knife that can stand upon its own edge? The breads and desserts are very good as you would expect from a French restaurant. I think this restaurant is much underrated and would do very well even if not attached to a great hotel like the Sofitel.",0.9612,0.83,0.146,0.024,0.4731111111111111
