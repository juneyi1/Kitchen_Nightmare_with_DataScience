Two weeks ago, after boating we decided to order some pizza, everyone raved about pequods, so I decided to call in an order. After being on hold for 20 min, I finally got through and placed an order for 2 large pizzas. The girl said 2 hours for delivery.. WTF? Fair enough.. we shall wait, over 2 hours pass and nothing.. I call, on hold for 10 min, finally to have he girl say .. ""Sorry, we canceled your order, we don't deliver to the harbor anymore"" WHAT!!????? We've been waiting for 2 hours!? Why didn't someone call me or say that!? She apologized and hung up, mind you. I fought with them and my bank for a week because they STILL CHARGED ME!  Fast forward to last night. Again, we want pizza after boating. We see our boat neighbors had pequods and they said it was delivered .. WTF! I call in an order and they said ""we don't deliver to the harbor."" I say, my neighbors just got delivery! She puts me on hold then processed to take my order... Like REALLY! They delivery when they want!? Anywho... I place an order and her quoted TWO HOURS! We wait, we wait and finally our BURNED PIZZAS ARRIVE! 2 hours and $80 later, our pizza arrived, everyone was super excited and starved and we open the boxes to three burned pizzas. LIKE WOW. Had to eat around the burned crust. Super disappointing .. and I ordered HOT wings and got BBQ.  What a JOKE. Will never order again and will make sure to tell all of my dock neighbors to not bother with this establishment.",0.8015,0.759,0.133,0.107,0.7030663780663778

2017-09-03,2.0,"Good pizza is hard to come by, but the pizza is only half the experience. Service is the other. We are a family of 6 and spent over $100- yeah I know, on pizza. Needless to say, I had a half of a piece I put in the pan to be wrapped with the rest of the pizza.  When the box returned, my half was not in there. The pizza slices are large so a half a piece is a good size. When I inquired about this from the waitress she explained ""oh they probably threw it out."" I asked ""why would they do that"" she said ""I don't know let me get a manager"" Now this is where ""poor management"" comes into play. I got up to go to the restroom and actually overheard the waitress  telling the manager- Alan- what happened. He shrugged his shoulders and never came to our table.  20 minutes later, after realizing he could care less, I went up to him, inquired about it, and he said ""oh they are new."" So because they are new they get to decide if they can throw my pizza away or not?!?  I paid for that pizza, it was mine, train your damn staff not to waste people's money (and food). Better yet, train Alan on how to be a manager instead of standing around flirting with all the waitresses.  We drove over an hour from our hotel to spend our money only to get treated as if our business didn't matter.  I wonder what the original owner would think of that!

However his efforts were pathetic. He stated that he wanted to resolve the issue but stood with his manager who banned me.  Then invited me to return. When I pointed out that I did not want to go in there and then be asked to leave, he did not continue the conversation.   While I understand that yelling and using profanity is no way to resolve a situation, they seem to think nk that people should just quietly take being ignored and mistreated when they make mistakes.  I did not get angry until my second or third call three hours after the ordeal began.  Their system has no way of tracking mistakes and service recovery efforts.

2017-08-27,3.0,"Came here with some friends after the last day of Lollapalooza (Sunday night) a few weeks ago. We got in at 11:30 and Pequod's closes at midnight, so the owner requested us to order our deep dish to go. We were fine with that, given most of us (not me :D) had work the next morning, and so we ordered two pizzas among the six of us to take back home. We waited at least half an hour for the pizza, which is understandable (not sure if this is the average wait time) because it's deep dish and needs to bake for awhile. A few minutes after we ordered, another party of 6 came in, sat at a table (we were sitting at the bar to wait), and ordered. One of our pizzas came out around midnight, but not the other. We had to go up to the cashier and ask him if our other pizza was ready. He went back into the kitchen for another few minutes, to which we were terrified that they had forgotten to even start our pizza, but then came out with it. As we were leaving, we saw food being served to the group that came in after us. I guess the owner was fine with that group eating in the restaurant rather than taking it to-go. We were fine with that too because we had our real lives to get back to in the morning, but I just thought it was odd, perhaps a little unprofessional. Our deep dish pizza was cold by the time we got back to our apartment (a 30-minute drive from Pequod's), but it tasted fine warmed up in the microwave and we were HUNGRY so it was good. It's not the best deep dish pizza I've had -- Zachary's here in Berkeley (Oakland) is still better -- but from what I've heard, Pequod's is better than Giordano's in Chicago.

There was a 45 minute wait, so I went to grab a gluten free pizza down the street. His pizza arrived at the bar, so I sat down and was eating my pizza as well. The manager came over and told me I couldn't eat my pizza. He also said he needed to ask us to leave. I totally understand there is rules about outside food, so I put the pizza box in my oversized purse, and stopped eating. I thought since the pizza wasn't out that it would be ok. We continued to sit at the bar while my husband (a paying customer) was enjoying his food. The bartender who was very nice came over and asked if my husband needed his food boxed implying we need to go. My husband said he was not finished, and asked if we had to leave. The manager came back over, and aggressively told us he had said we need to leave. I offered to the manager to wait outside with my purse (which had the pizza box in it) while my husband finished. The manager was not having it. I could understand if we were not complying or making a scene, but the manager was totally out of line. My husband barely drank his wine, and had not yet touched his salad. He said he wasn't going to pay for the food if he can't even eat it. The manager said we still had to pay, but couldn't finish. My husband said he wouldn't pay if he can't eat, so the manager took his glass, forks, etc. and threw it all on top of the pizza and told us to leave. This was a terrible example of customer service! I will never go back. This guy seriously had a personal problem, and very unhappy in his own life. I can't believe someone would treat customers like that!

2017-08-08,5.0,"This is a long overdue review. My friends were asking for food recommendations in Chicago and hands down, this restaurant is what the locals look for in deep dish pizza.  Yes, be prepared to wait long but the great part is that they let you put your order in while you wait for a table. So once you are seated, your pizza is already cooking and waiting to be devoured.  Don't be skeptical on how much a personal sized pizza can fill you up because my boyfriend and I underestimated and actually ended up ordering way too much. The deep dish pizza is so filling especially after ordering a generous amount of toppings.  The crust is cooked to perfection, fluffy as a marshmallow but so much flavor in each bite. Just thinking about the pizza makes my mouth watery. Oh how I wish I could have my hands on a Pequod's deep dish pizza again...

Pequod's product performed perfectly.  Totally worth the 1+ hour carry out time.  Totally worth waiting in the pickup line in the restaurant which was packed like the Red Line at rush hour. The pan pizza (their deep dish) was cooked perfectly, with the cheese just crisped just the way I like it around the edges.  The dough was appropriately cooked-through and crispy on the bottom, and offset by the heavenly layer of softness where it met the balanced sauce and toppings.  Ohh, the sauce.  Not too pasty, not too watery, with just the level saltiness and seasoning.  As with most pizza experiences, the sauce made the pizza.  Got my money's worth of toppings.  Cheese layer was thankfully just the right thickness.  The only thing I'd change would be to add the fresh basil later in the cooking process so that it didn't get so crispy too. Totally their own pizza recipe, but I might compare a little to the bumpiness, crispiness, and interest of NYC's Prince Street Pizza, and the dough recipe of Detroit's Pizza Papalis.

Ordered our normal double pepperoni pizza, extra pizza sauce, extra cooked. Gave my name, exact address including my apartment number and then proceeded to wait for our pizza to be delivered. We waited and waited but our pizza never came. We finally fell asleep a little after 1:00 a.m. Woke up the next morning and had two missed calls from Peqoud's, one at 1:23am and another at 1:30am. I called in my order at 11:48pm. So I called Peqoud's again tonight to explain that we paid for our pizza but never even got a knock on the door, despite me giving them my apartment number(we have a door man to let them into the lobby by the way so no excuse for not coming to our apartment.) The nice lady who answered the phone explained the situation to the manager on duty tonight(Friday night on August 4, 2017) and informed me that the manager said they tried to call twice but I never picked up the phone so they are not responsible for us not receiving the product that we already paid for. I am a professional in the hospitality industry and I am appalled at the response by the management at Pequod's. You expect your customers to not only pay you for a product, but then do the extra work of chasing you down to make sure they receive it? I apologize Pequod's, but I was never taught that this was the way a hospitality establishment was to conduct itself while I was majoring in Hospitality and Tourism Management at Purdue University. Maybe that's why we always rank in the top of the nation for our School of Hospitality and Tourism Management because we choose to educate our future industry leaders on proper etiquette in this industry. I don't want to insult another school by attempting to guess where you source your managers from, but they'd never make it past the first interview if it were my business.

Other well known pan pizza's are quite different. The thin crust disappointed me . Fairly thick crust for a thin pizza and also, quite bready and not much personality in the crust. Interestingly, the left overs were much better than fresh, IF you heat it up properly. NEVER MICROWAVE PIZZA! It turns into a soggy mess. Try putting it on a frying pan on no more than medium heat.

I ordered fried mushrooms, a 12 inch thin crust with meatball, mushroom, & onion, a can of Coke & a can of Sprite.  -1The Price: First of all that all came out to $40 prior to the tip (yikes) so I expected the normal magical unicorn dust flavors that Pequod's produces for the price. Nay kind Sir or Madam reader, here's how pizza night went downhill fast... -1The Appetizer: Well the mushrooms had breading that was too salty, and the mushrooms themselves had a weird after taste; like someone spit cinnamon Big Red gum in them before breading them! -1The Pizza: The pizza itself was a whole other hot mess: too much flavorless sauce and an ABUNDANCE of onions. I like onions...but I don't know anyone who likes them this much. I mean they were under the cheese, in the cheese & then for the piece de resistance, on top of the cheese. It looked like someone loaded a tee shirt cannon with onions and shot it on the pizza dead center. As for the meatballs (which should have been the star) it looked like someone took ah(uno/one) meatball chopped it into millionths and then placed the meatball dust on the pizza. The crust was thick and soooper dry. It sapped all the moisture out of my mouth like a 3ply industrial paper towel once it hit my tongue. The abundance of sauce should have helped the crust situation but again if you recall it was flavorless & tasted tinny. It tasted almost as though the sauce went from can to pizza.  This all made for a terrible Friday pizza night. I know you guys get busy but everything is still usually always at the top of the pizza game. I don't want to believe that Pequod's is slipping because it's normally fantastic, but the only thing that tasted right in this order were the cans of pop!

I liked that the crust was crunchy and the pizza was soft. I created my own toppings when I went and got mushroom, onions, and sausage. Choosing the toppings I think can also make or break the pizza flavors. It seems like this place is always busy so know that there will be a wait. I didn't know this because it was my first time there. But you can call ahead to have your name written down, and once you get there, they will move your name up to the top. So you do still have to wait, but it won't be like an hour. Once you place your order of pizza, know that it will take about an hour to make the pizza. So it's probably a good idea to order appetizer if your starving. I ordered the jalapeño poppers which were fantastic! Recommended to us by our server.

2017-07-11,5.0,"One of the trademarks of Chicago cuisine is its deep dish pizza. While the origins are unclear, deep dish has been a critical defining element of Chicago food for decades, and every time I visit Chicago, I am compelled to go to at least one deep dish pizzeria. Having tried Giordano's and Lou Malnati's in the past, I decided to give Pequod's a try. Located in Lincoln Park, it was rather out of the way of everything else I wanted to do (namely sightseeing in the Loop, and shopping in Chinatown), but I wanted to try it at least once. At the time of writing this review, the base price for a large deep dish is around $18 with no toppings, and then about $2.50 for each additional topping. When it comes to pizza, I like to have many toppings, so I got pepperoni, sausage, Canadian bacon, tomatoes, mushrooms, onions, and green peppers. I shared the pizza with 3 other people. I felt that for my appetite, I should have shared the pizza with 4 others instead of 3. The pizza is very thick and filled with toppings. I only managed to eat a single slice - though I did have one piece of garlic cheese bread before that (fairly standard as far as that flavor went). The pizza was perfect deep dish - the crust was crunchy, the cheese was layered and thick, and the toppings all blended together nicely. One of the downsides of deep dish, I feel, is that it's not nearly as good when delivered, because of how thick the pizza is. The pizza gets soggy quickly, and towards the end of the meal I already started to feel the cheese start to be more solid and not as tasty. The trade off is that deep dish, when eaten fresh, is incredibly rich and full of flavors. There are different schools of thought as to whether or not deep dish is ""real pizza"" - some say that pizzas are meant to be more flat and meant to be a nice balance of 50% crust and 50% toppings, whereas others would say pizza is pizza as long as the ingredients are there. Regardless of the case, I do feel deep dish is an incredibly unique way to experience pizza, and it is honestly my preferred way of eating pizza. Pequod's ranks easily as the best deep dish I've had yet, and may be one of the best pizzas I've ever had.",0.9934,0.858,0.121,0.021,0.5296529888551164

We were able to get seated right away, but it still takes 45 minutes once you are seated to get the pizza. Imagine if you had to wait in line for 2 hours and then 45 minutes after getting seated? That's the norm for a place like this. We went with the regular cheese and added some green peppers. Didn't want to compromise the authentic cheesy taste too much by adding too much. The pizza was delicious and one medium was perfect for 3 people. Boy is it cheesy and bready. But, not too much bread as I was expecting. I liked how the crust was crisp, giving it more flavor and helping it stay together well. I think the crust was pretty memorable - they flavor it very well, and it's the perfect amount of crisp..

We picked it because it had great reviews on none other then YELP.COM. my husband and I have been to Chicago a few other times ( mostly just flying into and out of O'HARE) so we have had other deep dish/ pan style pizza. Unfortunately this pizza was just ENNNN, nothing too special but it wasn't bad. The edges were crispy and blackened, melted cheese and slightly greasy pepperoni, the good kinda. Other pizzerias defiantly have better style pizza with lots of layers of cheese and mountains of toppings more like a pizza cake. Pequod's was 90% dough, layer of sauce and the traditional cheese and pep. Also it roughly took about 40 mins for the pizza to be fully completed, ( which was a really long time for to-go order placed on a Tuesday at roughly 2 pm --- I cant image how long you would have to wait if your going/ ordering at a busy time ) which is kinda of a long wait for 1 medium cheese and pep pie...

None of these people here who give good reviews of this place have probably ever had real good pizza.  I don't get the raving great reviews and horribly regret going here. Of all the good places to go eat, we went here and had to go out of our way to get here, in hopes the pizza would be delicious. It took us a 30 minute drive from downtown to come to this rickety area. That is usually a good sign but not for this place. There was a very slim layer of cheese on the pizza. It was 90% bread, 9.99% sauce and maybe close to 1 % of actual cheese. It tasted more like a burnt garlic bread, minus the good flavor. I shouldve went to the grocery store and bought some Texas toast. Would've been worth it more than this atrocious round bread. Please take a look at my pictures of the pie we received. It looks nothing like a pizza. And tastes nothing like one. To make a long story short: the waitress was so dismissive and oblivious half the time. She forgot we needed to order ( you have one job) then tried to be abnormally fake, extra sweet to our toddler. So much so that even he said he didn't want to be there.

The other thing I liked about it is that it was a little difficult to get to.... why is this a point I like to share?  It just feels like a little ""off the beaten path"" so that it's really not intended to be a tourist trap.  It is a good 15-18min walk from the Belmont (Red/Brown/Purple Lines) CTA stop, but there is also street parking available.  I suggest the walk... since it will prepare you for the carb-loading heaving you are about to experience when you come here. We arrived early.... party of 4 with a high-chair and we got seated right away (even though there was just 2 of us of the party present).  I like that it's first-come-first-serve so that people that eat early to avoid crowds are rewarded and there's no really extensive reservation process.  We were escorted past a bar (all seats filled) of people enjoying food and beverages and a bunch of high-top tables.  We were lucky enough to get a booth and the high-chair fit perfectly on the end of the table.   You can tell the server was busy with a party of 12/mix of kids and adults that basically ""sheilded us"" off from the other part of the restaurant since they extended the booth table with long tables to accommodate the large party, but our server kept checking on us.  We put in an appetizer that arrived as the rest of our party did and we placed our pizza order right away.  Half topping large between 4 people after a sample platter of appetizers was just enough food.  My only complaint is that the server that brought the pizza served us the slices so the photo op for the pizza was gone is a second.  I did what I could though.  We passed the time with beer and good company and just taking the atmosphere in.   By the time we left, the entire restaurant was full as were our stomachs.  I'd be interested to come back and try their thin crust... which a lot of tables were enjoying around us.",0.9972,0.755,0.197,0.048,0.4922619047619048

I really enjoyed it. The outer crust was my favorite part though; it was a bit burnt and it was super crunchy and delicious! Good place to eat, I would definitely recommend it.

I remember loving it about two years ago when I first had it; before I knew anything about the hype. You can argue who has the best deep dish in Chicago, but I want to put a spin on this. If you look at the menu, they call this ""pan"" pizza and I'm glad they do, because I'd consider them the best pan pizza in Chicago, not deep dish. What I'm trying to say is pan pizza is known to be over-compensated on the dough. This is a very doughy pizza. I consider deep dish more balanced with more cheese and toppings and less dough. To each their own. I really like the airiness of the crust. It has a well-cooked bottom crunch, yet a chewy center. The sauce is more savory and is a true sauce, not chunk tomatoes. I hate to say it, but the sausage tasted a little dry and gritty. This is more than likely due to it being cooked on top of the pizza. There was a decent amount of cheese. It was enough, but wouldn't have complained if there was more. Of course I have to mention the caramelized cheese crust. This is the best bite of the pizza and what they are famous for. Don't be alarmed, it does not taste burnt at all! I also got a thin crust pizza. It's nice that they do a braided outer crust. The toppings were abundant and the it was far more cheesy than the pan pizza. I really liked the thin crust. I think everyone should at least get Pequods once to say they did and it may be your new favorite pan pizza.

After some research, I found out some of the secrets.  First is the cast iron pizza pans, well-seasoned after many years of use.  Next is the dough, spread in a thick layer on the bottom of the oiled pizza pain, but not up the sides.  The cheese is whole mild mozzarella, sliced in house to exact specifications, and laid in overlapping pattern on top of the crust but, and here's one of the secrets, also placed up on the sides of the pan.  A hefty ladle of uncooked seasoned tomato sauce goes on top, followed by toppings, dried oregano and pecorino romano cheese.  The thing bakes for about 20 minutes in a 600 degree oven.   The result?  The crust has a beautiful lacy caramelized ring around it, the sauce is sweet and tangy with great depth of flavor, and the toppings are charred to great effect. It's deep dish pizza perfection!  Hard. To. Stop. Eating. It.

I initially called at 6:10pm today to place an order. I followed the prompts and was on hold listening to some awful music for 20 min. 20 minutes. Unreal. Then the music stops, and I get pushed to voicemail! The fact I even stayed on hold that long showcases how much I love this pizza. I call back and decide to choose the pick up prompt, which resulted in me speaking to someone right away. I advised what happened and instead of saying they will look into it, she said she could take my order herself. Had I known this I wouldn't have waited for 20 minutes. Now the fun part. I got my order taken, was told it would be here in about 1.5 hours (8:05pm). Pizza didn't come until 8:30. That is 2 hours of waiting. That's a bit ridiculous in my opinion. I'm not that far away, there was no rain, and traffic around 8pm isn't really heavy. I ended up calling the store asking if anything had happened because it's been 2 hours. The girl who answered said to call back in 10 minutes if the pizza didn't come. I mean, shouldn't this be addressed at that moment in time, regardless? What is 10 minutes after 2 hours of waiting?!?!? Customer service should have been better. I should have been given to a manager to discuss. Had I known I'd be eating at 8:30pm I would have ordered somewhere else, eaten by 730pm (at a normal hour). Pizza came lukewarm, not hot. Normally, I would say something, but I was so hungry from not having had anything to eat all day that I just said forget it. They won't do anything anyways- they didn't do anything when I told them I've been waiting over 2 hours and the pizza guy was 30 min late. For the price, I would have expected a little better customer service. I order pizza all the time and come in very frequently, so this experience makes me a little weary of ordering delivery from here. Maybe it's best to go sit at the store, and hope not to be stuck upstairs on the summer where it feels like 100 degrees!

Pequod's pizza is more like a focaccia bread, very doughy, with a little bit of sauce and toppings and a hint of cheese. If you cut it in half it would probably make great sandwich bread.  What toppings there are, are very fresh and of good quality. The best part of the pizza is the burnt cheese on the crust. Burnt cheese crust really shouldn't be the highlight of your deep dish pizza though.  The wait is usually long and even if you place your order ahead of time, you'll likely be waiting anyway.

We also got a cheesy garlic bread appetizer.  The appetizer was ok. It's just bread with a lot of cheese. I was starving so I thought it tasted good but it was pretty generic. They were also super skimpy with the marinara sauce.  Our pizza was super cheesy. I don't know why we got extra cheese! Deep regrets. It has enough cheese. The toppings add up so choose wisely. Our pizza ended up being ~$45 total (from a base price of $18). Each slice weighed like 5 lbs. That's a lot of food. The vegetables are really fresh and the premium meats very good. You can't go wrong with your favorites. Service is good, albeit slow because of its popularity. The space is cramped and dark but I think that is the genera design of these pizza places.

For such a popular restaurant I was surprised to learn that they deliver. This was great as I did not have to trek out using mass transit and walk 0.8 mi from the closest station like I was planning to do in order to try this highly rated pizza.  I am not sure if ""stuffed"" is synonymous with ""deep-dish"" because this pizza was definitely deep-dish but most of the depth was the bready dough vs other deep-dish pizzas that consisted of a thick layer of cheese and whatever other toppings. It is easy to get awed by the nice crispy crust of the pizza. I originally gave this 4 stars but when I came back and tasted the left overs of all my deep-dish pizzas side by side, I realized that comparatively I enjoyed it less than the others because it was mostly bread/dough.

I'm speaking specifically to all my heartburn people out there, this sauce will not keep you up at 3am in the morning, but enough about all that.  I came to Pequod's with my girlfriend, Gaby, wanting to try out this heavily hyped pie. The joint was juking, which was to be expected on a Friday night, but it only took us 40 minutes to get seated which was not bad due to the reputation of the joint and the incredible crowd waiting outside (pro tip: you can get ahead of the wait line if you call in for a table the day before).  To pass the time we went three doors over to the Drinkingbird and had a couple of Schiltz and PBR's for 3 dollars a pop while we waited. Once our buzzer thing vibrated we rushed over. Walking to our table all I was getting was college/frat vibes (esp. on the second floor) from the decor to the people. I went to UOI, so I'm a natural in this habitat (just wanted to fully disclose for all the anti-bros out there). Once seated we ordered immediately since we already knew what we came for and did not want to drag out the hold time of the pizza. We ordered buffalo wings and a medium pizza (sausage & pepperoni - 1/2 jalapenos).  The wings came out immediately and they were really good, the only problem for me was the price of the wings in comparison to the size of the wings. I literally, in one bite, can clean those wings. I drank one beer and a 1/4 of my second beer before the pizza came out which is okay (I like my pizza out before I finish my first beer (I sip lightly everyone, at restaurants only of course lol)).  Once the pie arrived, we dug in. The ingredients are to die for, plain and simple. It was GREAT! I can really see what all the hype is about and the fun atmosphere complemented the entire experience. Trust me - if you haven't tried this place, don't let the hold time faze you, you will be rewarded in the end.   *****I will say this though, I AM NOT A FAN OF THE ""CARAMELIZED"" CRUST at the end. Idk if this is an accrued taste like wine or something BUT TO ME IT TASTE BURNT. The cheese and crust underneath the burnt ends tasted great nonetheless. The restaurant as a whole is 4/5 for me - the wings 3/5 (this rating is leaning on the weight of the price) but the stuffed pie was 4.5/5. I will def. recommend this pie to friends and family.

This was obviously an error on the pizza makers part, but mistakes happen. I called to see what we could do to fix the situation the manager over the phone was (and still is) a complete jackass! He said ""That just means some pepperonis laid to the side while in transit & we don't guarantee our half doers to actually be half"" Really? That is the worst attitude and approach you could take to this situation. I work in the restaurant industry and have done so for the past 6 years. I have managed, served, bar backed, hosted, etc......I can't even wrap my head around how ownership can allow this manager to talk to his guests the way he did.

2017-03-31,2.0,"Pequod's is coasting on their reputation. The pan pizza is mostly bread and short on cheese and toppings. This is only thick focaccia with too much tomato sauce, and not enough cheese, toppings, or flavor.  On two visits, the pizza was under-cooked. We waited a very long time for everything, so...did not send it back. The sauce is goopy and wet, which creates the illusion of more content that there actually is. While the caramelized crust is okay, it's not enough to save this weak pie. The deep dish they served me looked as if they cooked it for 15 minutes. The deep dish I prefer is a pie, with layers of ingredients, which would take 45 minutes to cook. Look at how many tables they are turning over, how small the kitchen is, and it makes sense that these are ""fast cook specials"" i.e. - mostly bread. While I can enjoy a non-pretentious atmosphere, the decor and vibe is out of date, cramped, and creaky. Goes to show how powerful (yet wrong) word of mouth can be, as people are waiting in line up to 2 hours to even get in the door.  Service was not good for me at the bar, as the bartender was chatting with his co-workers more than attending to his (3) customers. Space is cramped: If you sit at the bar be prepared for every single guest walking in to be seated, pass within inches of you.

2017-03-28,5.0,"Always great, and always worth the wait.  Pequod's is, in my book, serves the best pizza in the city of Chicago. If you plan on coming though, know that during peak hours will could easily have an hour or more wait until you get seated, and then another 40 minutes to an hour before you get your pizza (not because they are slow, but because the deep-ish dish pizzas they serve take a long time to make).  The bar has a good selection of beer, and the service is always friendly.  On my most recent visit, about 2 weeks ago, we learned that the owners of Pequod's had opened a bar next door called Whale Tale. The great thing about that place is is that when you put your name in for a seat at Pequod's, your buzzer will work next door at Whale Tale. The people over there know that you are most likely there waiting for a table, and so the service is appropriately fast.  Back to Pequod's though. Sure, ambiance-wise, it's a Blackhawks bar, but the pizza is the star of the show. Their pizza is, like I said before, deep-ish dish. I usually describe it as like a halfway deep dish. Pizzas are made in cast iron skillets and there is a layer of cheese baked in underneath and around the crust giving it a perfect, crunchy, parmesan seasoning all the way around. To me that is the best part. Pizza topping selections are plentiful, and they are not shy about loading them up onto the pizza.  I've never had a bad experience here, but there was only one time that I was here that I didn't have to wait less than an hour for a table (I think it was the middle of the afternoon for some reason).  I can not recommend this pizza enough. You should also note that they do have priority seating that you can access and set up from home before you venture out and take your chances with the wait time. That is definitely worth looking into.",0.9953,0.833,0.159,0.007,0.4551851851851852

Their upstairs private party room is a little tight, but it was cozy, intimate and casual - just what we were looking for. The service was awesome. As a type-A bride-to-be, I have to say the only negative was their lack of traditional planning/coordination. We ""booked"" our event about 9 months out with an email from Pequod's saying, ""You got it, the date is yours."" We didn't sign a contract or put any money down, which felt different from the other vendors we booked. Regardless, after I allowed myself to trust in their process, we followed up with them a few times leading up to the event and they were warm, kind, and accommodating when we wanted to come tour the space.

2017-03-21,3.0,"Pequod's is a Bar that serves Pizza. Plain and simple. It is a very specific kind of Chicago pizza (you won't have to search very hard for the pictures) that incorporates a very airy dough, tall (deep-dish) execution, crispy-crunchy edges, and not a whole lot of cheese on top. As far as the setting, Pequod's looks and feels like a dive bar. Fortunately for Pequod, it is a good dive bar and it does what it does very well.  I got what I came for, and didn't really expect anything different. It is a solid place if you want to go throw a few back and eat some pizza with friends. Honest (and very likely unpopular to many) opinion? The pizza isn't anything to write home about. It's good enough, but you have to really want this kind of pizza, else you'll be disappointed.  The bartenders and servers I encountered were friendly, helpful, and swift. Service was great and I had a great time.

2017-03-15,4.0,"Pequod's was my first crack at authentic Chicago style pizza in Chicago. In fact, it was the very first stop we made upon arrival into the Windy City and it certainly did not disappoint.  Their specialty is the ""caramelized crust"" edge on their pan style pizzas. The cheese was oozing out onto the side of crust and it was full of cheesy goodness. This is how they differentiate themselves from the competition and they execute it very well. We got a large sausage and pepperoni deep dish which was essentially a meat lovers pizza. Each bite was bursting of flavor and left us completely stuffed at the end. The only issue I had was that it was too crusty for my liking. I prefer a traditional deep dish that's not as doughy but that's just a matter of preference. The ingredients here were fresh, they don't used canned tomatoes which is splendid.  As with all authentic Chicago style pizzas, the waiting time will be long since they have to bake the crust to a nice golden brown.  Getting the buffalo wings as appetizers in the meantime is a solid move. They were delicious and it certainly made the wait for the pizza more bearable by chowing down some delicious wings. They have a good selection of craft beers too which is nice. As a few people in our group were San Diegans, we had to go with a pitcher of our beloved Ballast Point Sculpin.  Service was friendly and efficient as well. We were there until past closing at 2am and they did not rush to kick us out. They provided prompt and courteous service even though we were literally the last customers of the night.  Overall, Pequod's definitely earns their reputation as being one of the finest deep dish pizzerias in Chicago.

On our way to the airport, we were limited on time and therefore came here upon a friend's recommendation. I liked the feel of this spot. A bar/pizza joint. The service was excellent. Everyone was so friendly and nice to newbies like us.  I liked their caesar salad. It was nice to munch on it while we waited for our pizza that takes about 20 minutes to make. So in comparing the two, I think I like Lou's better for a few reasons. Pequod's crust was too burnt/crunchy for me. There wasn't enough cheese. I like Lou's because of the perfect chunky tomato sauce to cheese ratio, as well as it not feeling insanely heavy by being too heavily breaded.

We ordered our pizza to be delivered and it came in an hour. That was perfectly fine with us (it was a Saturday night and was actually delivered on the lower end of the time frame I was given). Pizza arrived hot and fresh. Just to clarify, Pequad's does not make a deep dish pizza. I see a lot of reviews calling their pizza deep dish and it's not, it's a pan pizza, which means it's a very thick crust. We knew this before we ordered and we are fans of pan pizzas, so this wasn't a surprise for us. We ordered a personal sized pepperoni, and a large pineapple. Overall, the pizza was edible. Sauce was mild in flavor (but at least it had some flavor compared to the other place we tried), there wasn't a ton of cheese (this could be good, or bad depending on your preference), and the crust had no flavor and was way too dry. I don't think I've ever had pizza crust fall apart due to being too dry. That was the biggest downfall of this pizza...dry crust that isn't very flavorful equals a lackluster pizza. The cheese caramelization on the edge of the crust was right on the cusp of being overdone. If it had been cooked any longer that cheese would have been burnt to an inedible state. Thank goodness it wasn't cooked to that point, but it was really close. Maybe if it was cooked a couple minutes less the crust wouldn't have been so dry and the caramelized cheese along the edges would have been in a more enjoyable state  I don't eat dairy or eggs and I decided to in order to find out what makes Chicago's pizza great.

However, it is my FAVORITE deep dish pizza in Chicago and I never fail to mention it to those looking to try deep dish for the first time.

There's more of a sports bar vibe from Pequods than from the other chain restaurants, it's often dark, open late, and there can be tons of people depending of if there's a game or not.  What sets Pequods apart is their crust on the deep dish. It's perfectly cooked so that it's carmelized and crispy which makes the pizza that much better. You can't get crust like that elsewhere.  Keep in mind that deep dish pizza can take a while to cook so either be prepared to wait (it's worth it) or order some appetizers in the mean time. On weekdays, you can call in and order ahead of time so that the pizza will come out faster once you've arrived.

What I got: Personal size half sausage, and half ground beef + basil Crust: PERFECTION. Described to be a ""caramelized"" crust and boy, can you see it! Giardano's has the soggy cardboard crust of death. Lou's crust has great taste but still can get dry or mush in the middle. Pequod's has a beautiful crunchy crust THROUGHOUT including the middle bottom. Tell me thy saucery! Everything else: sausage was pretty bland, Lou's sausage is by far superior. I also like the ground beef itself by Giardano's better. Passing grade for the cheese. I did like the fact that the sauce is not too watery. Atmosphere: very casual, has seating upstairs and downstairs, 45min or more to get your pizza cooked depending on how busy it is. Bar and hockey type of atmosphere. Bottom line: If perfect crust is what you desire - this is a must go. Too soon to call it for me in regards to the superiority of this to Lou's, definitely better than Giardano's and Uno's.

Then I realized that everything is relative to what you like in a pizza. is it the sauce, the cheese, the dough, etc. If you are a bread fan, then this place will certainly live up to your expectations. But if you're like me, then you'll just find this to be another great deep dish variant, but not the most ""amazing"" one that I've ever bitten into. For starters, Pequod's reputation means that it gets busy no matter the time or day. My friend and I came here for a New Year's lunch, and luckily called in to ""get priority."" We essentially skipped to the top of the line once we arrived because we called in early to make a semi-reservation. I suggest that you do the same! We were seated at a booth and I really loved the layout of the restaurant. I felt like it had just enough space without feeling overcrowded, and loved the brick walls and sports bar vibe. Our meal started with their Fried Sampler plate which was bomb. Loved the mozzarella sticks and jalapeño poppers the most. About 20 minutes later, our large deep dish pizza came out with sausage, Canadian bacon, green peppers, and basil. Each topping was an additional $2.50 on top of the pizza price. Right off the back, the pizza smelled real good and I could tell that it was a lot of bread! Pequod's is known for its quality dough, and I can see why! The thin tomato sauce layer held together some amazing pieces of meat. I would say that the best sausage on a deep dish pizza was definitely from here. Personally, I prefer a deep dish with more cheese, sauce, and toppings rather than the dough itself. Because of this, I can't really call this the best deep dish pizza in Chicago, but it truly is one of the best I've had.

2017-01-25,4.0,"I LOVE their pizza -- my husband and I agree that it is hands-down the best deep-dish pizza we've had in Chicago. They caramelize the crust and it is wonderful. The star down is for wait-time when it's busy. They're really great when it's an off time and they're not busy. Super friendly and helpful, but they need to do something about how they handle customers during the busy times. They don't take reservations, instead they have a priority seating list that puts you at the top of the wait list when you arrive. When I went with a large-ish group, they told me we'd have about a 45 minute wait. It took about 90 minutes, and we had something scheduled (and paid for and reserved) right afterwards, so it was super stressful trying to get dinner before we went to our event, and we weren't even really able to enjoy ourselves -- just ordered a couple of pizzas, had a beer, and had to take off. So, not the best place to go for dinner if you have somewhere else to be later, but still good food. Like I said, when they're not busy, the experience is great. They always have a game on and have great food. The service staff makes great recommendations for beer when asked and the atmosphere fits in well with a sports bar -- a little dark on the inside, but all the better to watch a game, eat pizza, and have a drink. If you come with a large group, be prepared to be a little squished. They don't have a ton of room and are quite busy during the dinner hour.",0.9959,0.764,0.209,0.026,0.490383597883598

Went up to the hostess at that time and they said it'd be another 45 minute wait. So we waited because at that point, we had already invested a lot of time. Went back to the hostess and there still wasn't any seating, and on top of that the pizza would take another 30 minutes to make even after we got seated, so we left.

2017-01-16,4.0,"As a Chicagoan, I love all pizza. Thin, thick, stuffed, pan, deep dish, bagel bites, pizza for breakfast, cold pizza straight from the fridge. Pequod's does live up to the hype. I wouldn't say it's the best pizza, mostly because I don't have a favorite. I love all sorts of pizza, remember? Don't come here starving to death because you will most likely have to wait 15-30 minutes for a table. And then after you order a pan pizza, you'll have to wait another 20+ minutes. And for that reason, we ordered mozzarella sticks so we could have something to munch on. Nothing amazing with the mozzarella sticks and, unfortunately, ours were only slightly warm, which means the cheese was not ooey gooey.. boo. Anyway, the pan pizza is HEAVY. I would say a small 10"" pan pizza is enough for two people if you don't want leftovers. In my opinion, the more toppings, the better! So we usually get pepperoni, sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom. Their pan crust reminds me almost of thick focaccia bread doused in butter and cheese and baked until a nice, crispy outer crust is formed. It's definitely a delicious pizza straight out of the oven, however, I don't recommend take out since the pan pizza can get a bit soggy.",0.9768,0.792,0.157,0.052,0.6232142857142857

There wasn't that big of a selection but they had a decent sized list. We ordered two orders of the appetizer platters which was just enough for our large group. I really liked the fried zuchinni, but wasn't that big of a fan of the jalepeno poppers.  We ordered 2 large and 1 medium pan pizza. It took about maybe an hour to arrive but it was worth it!. We had one with Italian beef and giardenera, another with just sausage, and the last with mushroom and spinach. Everyone enjoyed all of them! The crust was crisp to perfection.

The first couple times I was in Chicago, I did the touristy thing and went to Giordano's, etc. I did not know about the Holy Grail of Chicago pizza yet. A friend of mine told me I was missing out and needed to stay away from the tourist trap pizza places and experience true Chicago pizza. I had high expectations for my first time when I went to Pequod's, and they definitely were met and exceeded! I was not disappointed. If you go on a weekend, you should expect a wait, unless you utilize the call ahead seating that they offer. The pizza does take some time to make, but it is expected. Their pizza is actually true deep dish pizza, with the perfect combination of dough, sauce, cheese, and toppings. (Instead of having loads of cheese and toppings filled with a thin layer of dough.) I can't even put in words how amazing the flavor is, especially with the caramelized cheese on the crust! That's probably one of my favorite parts!!!  The atmosphere is great inside as well, especially to watch your favorite team. Lots of televisions and you will have a view of multiple screens from wherever you are seated.

I dislike bar atmospheres, which this place definitely has, but I more than tolerate the dark, the noise, the raucousness for the sheer sublimity of this perfect expression of Chicago Pizza. The platonic ideal, to wax philosophical. It's also more than worth the long wait/the long prep time if you call ahead (recommended). It's a chain, but *barely,* with just one other location--the original, in the suburbs. Nothing like the tourist-friendly polish of Giordano's/Lou's, with a freezer in the front for tourists to ship ""authentic Chicago""!!!! pizza souvenirs to their buddy Joe in Montana.  Now, it's well-known that the mere fact of being geographically served within Chicago's city limits does not a true Chicago Pizza make. There are four or five valid choices, in order of my personal preference: Pequod's, Giordano's, Uno's, Lou Malnati's, Gino's. The final four in that list are pretty close in ranking, and reasonable people can quibble about the order. Pequod's is in the #1 slot by leaps and bounds.  Be prepared for a thick, doughy, bready crust which caramelizes to crisp perfection. It's not ""burnt"" and won't give you cancer. Just exquisitely cooked cheese and tomato sauce. The deepest pan of all deep-dish joints. Fresh ingredients (I usually order with double mushroom, broccoli, and garlic). And the most FILLING pizza you've ever had. Two or three slices are all most people can handle. As I said at the start, this pizza is really best eaten fresh. Ordered as delivery or takeout and reheated at home still results in an excellent, exceptional pie... but a good chunk of the magic is lost and it becomes more in-line with the others.",0.9961,0.78,0.197,0.023,0.5379166666666667

My pizza came with burnt crust, and very poorly distributed sauce and ingredients.  The salad never came. The driver didn't alert me to it, and when I asked where it was he blamed the kitchen and said he only takes what they give him and doesn't have time to confirm the order. He offered me the cash equivalent to the salad since I paid with a card, and that he couldn't run the salad back to me since he was too busy.  Is this what you call customer service?

After you brave the gauntlet of waiting, being seated, and deciding what you want to order, the pizzas are hefty and delicious--two mediums will feed four hungry adults and there will still likely be leftovers.

2016-12-18,2.0,"I ordered delivery on a medium deep dish pizza upon recommendation from a friend. I'll break this review into two parts: Food and Delivery/Service. Food: This place does a good deep dish. The outer crust is crispy to a point where it's almost burnt (in a good way) and the sauce and toppings they use are solid. If food was the only category to judge in picking a restaurant, I would give this place 4 stars. Delivery/Service: There is much left to be desired here, hence the overall 2 star rating. I had ordered delivery at 5:37pm hoping I would avoid the dinner rush. They quoted me 1.5 hours and asked what specific change I needed since I was paying in cash. I responded with $10 so I could give $41 (2 $20's and a single I had) for my ~$25 medium pizza; this would have resulted in a ~$6 tip which to me is fair. Here is where it goes bad, the delivery didn't show up until after 8pm (2.5 hours after ordering) and the driver only brought 5 singles so they forced my hand into tipping $10. Normally not a big deal, but being forced to tip 40% on late delivery seems wrong to me. I called the restaurant to understand what went wrong and the woman that answered could not have cared less and explained that late delivery was normal for them. Maybe just tell your customers up front it's up to them to find correct change and that your food will show up at some point that night...  Given there are many places in Chicago that have good deep dish, good service, and on-time delivery, I would recommend to take your business elsewhere.",-0.0656,0.839,0.087,0.074,0.47394688644688643

After some recommendations and online reviews, we decided to try Pequod's. I was pretty much sold when I heard 'caramelized cheese crust' (a specialty of theirs).  For appetizers, my friends and I got the cheesy garlic bread which is super cheesy (!!) with the right amount of garlic and butter, it was a great way to trigger our appetite while waiting for the pizza. I've been warned by locals that the pizza at Pequod's is delicious but not the best representation of a Chicago-style 'deep dish' pizza, and I can see why. The crust is best described as a thick crust and the pizza itself was not the ""so deep you'll get lost in the ooey gooey layers of melted cheese and toppings"" kind of deep dish. Because of this, my boyfriend was not too impressed. I, on the other hand, thought it was pretty good and would have no problem returning (but maybe after trying other deep dish spots). What made this pizza truly stand out and worth trying is the caramelized cheese crust. The cheese added a nice texture and salty/cheesy flavor to the dish. Overall, the pizza is a solid 4 and the crust, 5 -- I mean, who doesn't love burnt cheese?",0.6905,0.753,0.134,0.113,0.5593509984639018

""You won't find better in the city. Good job."" It was almost as if people were surprised that I, some guy from Vegas, would be able to divine the local secrets of Chicago pizza. This place was awesome.  That's the important part. Second most important: you're going to wait for it. We put our names in and went down the street to a bar they had partnered with to wait, instead of just sitting around waiting for a table in the actual restaurant. They gave us a buzzer and we started drinking. About 80 minutes later, the buzzer went off and we headed back to our table.  We ordered garlic cheese bread for starters, and it was pretty good. I'd give it 4 stars if I had to grade the bread alone. It was still good, no doubt, the bread could have been a bit better if I had to pick one thing to improve.  After we ordered our pizzas, one thick and one thin crust, we waited again and ate our garlic cheese bread and drank our drinks. The pizzas arrived. I'm not a big fan of Chicago-style deep dish. I consider myself a thin-crust man. The thin crust is thicker than I expected, more of a ""pan"" style, ""normal"" thickness. The deep dish was exactly what I expected. Even though I'm not a deep dish person, I ate two pieces and had to stop myself from having a third lest I leave no room for the thin crust. The thin crust was excellent, and the thickness was deceiving: it was crisp and delicious even though a bit airy. I am a big fan of both these pizzas.

The sauce:  Insipid and bland. The veggie toppings:  Hacked up in unpleasantly large bites.  (The sausage was pretty good, though.)

The cheese bread is almost artery clogging with the amount of cheese that they put on it and was the perfect size to share between three people without being too much.  We ordered a pepperoni, sausage, and basil pizza. The crust came out looking like it was burnt but it was just how they caramelized cheese. The crust itself was very crispy on the outside while fluffy and doughy on the inside. The addition of the caramalized/burnt cheese was definitely my favorite part of the pizza and was quite addicting! The pepperoni was pretty standard and I liked their sausage a lot better because it was more flavorful. The only real downside is that the pizza was mainly a really thick crust. Though it was tasty, I could only really get through one whole slice before being sent into a carb-induced food coma.

You will have to take a taxi or drive to get there. It feels like you are in a Chicago institution once you step inside with the patrons, the small business look and the Chicago sports décor throughout the room. It has less of the touristy and restaurant chain touches / trappings of the more well-known Chicago deep dish spots. What Pequod's most excels at is their crust. It is a true pan pizza and has an exceptional caramelized crust. This caramelized crust does not just deliver a great crispiness to the pizza crust, but it also delivers a really addictive flavor. Pequod's burnt crust has the kind of distinction that Pizza Hut hopes to achieve with their pan pizza crust but does not. The sauce and toppings are all fine, but the center of the pizza has a lot of soft bread / crust, which keeps the pizza from being one of the best in the city. Service was fairly quick and friendly. Prices are okay given that the portions are generous and the pizza is so filling. I am not a huge deep dish pizza fan though it was nice to try a more local deep dish pizza spot in Chicago.

I read the reviews and one woman was saying they don't let the crust mature and that makes you bloated, which makes sense. Basically the pizza was not done at well. It was like eating semi done crust where the cheese did not even melt. The toppings were not evenly distributed. The waitress was so indifferent, as most of the stuff, some college not caring kids.

We were seated at 5pm and ordered our pizza and an appetizer around 5:15. No one mentioned a longer wait time on food that evening. The appetizer came out almost immediately and then our server all but disappeared. Around 6:15 I was able to flag her down and ask if she knew the status of our pizza, expecting it to be up soon. She came back about five minutes later to tell us she wasn't sure what had happened but a manager would be coming. A manager then came with nothing to report, returning again to tell us that the ticket was lost, they didn't do it on purpose, and it would be out in ten minutes. He also vented to us about their three hour wait for a table. (Uh, maybe because you can't keep orders straight in your kitchen?) When a member of our group expressed his frustration, he said he'd ""do something for us"" on the bill. Look, I've worked in the service industry. I get that people make mistakes. But the manager couldn't even be bothered to apologize!  Our food eventually came about 90 minutes after we ordered it, and the pizza was good, but it wasn't worth the inattentive service and long wait.

We ordered two appetizers to hold us over while the pizza was cooking: jalapeño poppers for him ($7) and half order of hot wings for me ($5). My wings were very good- spicy and plenty of meat on them. Plus they give the option of ranch or blue cheese which was nice and also novel for me because at many upstate ny places it's blue cheese or nothin' and I'm not a fan. I'm not sure how long the pizza took but it didn't seem long at all because it came out very soon after we finished with the appetizers... perfect timing!  We got a 10"" deep dish pizza with pepperoni and black olives (~$15). My boyfriend wasn't sure about getting the small pizza to split for fear of not having enough, but it was plenty! We actually each could only eat about one and a half slices- and there were four all together. The pie itself was very tasty. Crunchy and chewy crust, lots of toppings, tangy sauce and I actually really liked the toasty burnt cheese ring around the crust which is their specialty.

There was a half hour wait which is to be expected. We were given one of those timed buzzers and headed to a bar a few doors down. After 30 minutes it was finally our turn to get a table.  We were lead upstairs and wow- this place is unsuspectingly huge. They occupy the full two floors of this building, AND there's still a wait on a Wednesday. I'm assuming that means they're crazy good.  Most of the tables upstairs are smaller bar top tables, perfect for two people max, so I can imagine it gets really cramped, fast.  The menu is simple; your typical pizza-place type of menu- apps, salad, pasta, pizza. They have a full bar and a pretty basic beer list. Think Miller Lite and Stella Artois.  The pizza toppings are pretty simple. No specialty pizzas, just classic Chicago pan pizza.  We ordered a medium pan pizza with mushrooms, basil and giardiniera. The medium comes with 6 slices (small comes with 4- which is perfect if you don't want the left-overs because we only ate 4/6 of our slices). Overall the service was okay. The waitress was polite but not very attentive. The staff may also share tables because we had at least three different people attend to us over the course of our meal.  The pizza itself was good, but not the best I've ever had.  The crust from Pequods is definitely what stood out to me, aside from the hour wait we had for it to just show up at our table.

Worth coming out here and waiting in line in order to get your fix of delicious pizza. I usually go with basil, mushroom, and sausage, and I would highly recommend that combination. You will need a medium to feed about 3 people (each get 2 slices) - and trust me, you will be plenty full. Note this is deep dish, I have not given their thin crust a try.  I've converted so many people to Pequod's. It the true local Chicago deep dish pizza experience. My only complaint and the only thing that's holding Pequod's from getting a five star rating is the fact that the quality sadly is not consistent. There will be times when Pequod's completely knock the ball out of the park and give you an amazing pizza, but there are also other times when the crust is burnt or not fully cooked.  They don't take real reservations - you can call ahead but what happens is that you get to jump to the top of list, which will still require some wait (unlike most other restaurants, where you will have a table ready as soon as you walk in). I have ordered for pick-up in the past (it took about 50 minutes), but the pizza experience is not the same. That same day, delivery was about 2 hours. So I would plan ahead if you would like to order a pizza and eat from your home.  I would say to truly experience Pequods, you have to eat the pizza there. When it pops right out of the oven, it is amazing. The long wait is crazy. I have waited 2+ hours in the past. There is a Barnes and Nobles nearby and that's where I go to hang out while waiting. It's worth it and just do it!",0.9812,0.865,0.116,0.019,0.47502040816326546

But I was somewhat disappointed with Pequod's, which was recommended by multiple Chicago-resident friends. The fact is, I didn't think it was a great deep dish pizza, let alone a destination deep dish pizza. We ordered a cheesy garlic bread as an appetizer which I wholeheartedly preferred to the pizza. It was warm, melty, and garlicky, and suuuper cheesy. The pizza we ordered (which I also think is ridiculous that each topping is about an additional $2.00) was impressive in its presentation, but not as flavorful, and more bread than anything else, although the edges were crispy with crisp almost-burnt cheese. I thought it would be saucier and have a sort of doughy inner that kind of melded with the tomato sauce, with a crisp bottom, but I was sadly disappointed. The pizza does take a while to come out. Highly recommend getting an appetizer or two to hold you over. And definitely throw out your expectations of getting a nutritious, healthy meal if you're coming here.

SO, I'm a little biased because I'm not the biggest fan of deep dish.  That being said, I thought that the amount of food was fantastic. The portion size is fairly good, though it's not exactly ""cheap eats"" for 2. My boyfriend was disappointed in what he got for the cost, but he also couldn't stop comparing it to regular pizza in NY.  Pequod's felt different to me than Giordano's, and I appreciated the decor and the zombie Moby Dick theme, so for that alone, I think this place is solid.  I'm a huge fan of sauce, so I actually loved that there was a lot of it, and that's my favorite part about deep dish. The pan style pizza here is served in the pan, and the service was good. The crust is nice and burnt, just the way we all like it. It's not a ton of cheese but still plenty for you to feel like you're going to have a heart attack.

Don't get me wrong - i LOVE pizza, and I LOVE crust, but if all deep dish pizza is like the ones at Pequod's, then I may just be a thin crust fan. First of all, the caramelized crust just tasted like crispy crackers, and the crust in its entirety tasted like flavored croutons - super crunchy and not the stretchy, flavorful soft crust that I was expecting. Biting into a pizza I usually expect a chewy and yeasty texture to crust, but here the crust was more like...toast.  The toppings were good, they were pretty generous on the meat, and the cheese was wonderfully stringy and generous. Environment is amazing for watching sports (we came on the day that the Cubs won! haha this place is better for late night) and drinking beer, but if all deep dish has disappointing crust like this then maybe I'm just not a fan of deep dish pizza in general :(  Will try other deep dish places to compare!",0.9979,0.67,0.296,0.035,0.5991666666666666

2016-10-11,3.0,"Hit up Pequod's Pizzeria on a busy Friday evening to finally see if the hype lives up.  I definitely recommend signing up for Priority Seating because it works, our party only waited 15 minutes.  After snaking up and through the building, we were seated on the top floor and quickly ordered some brews.  We then ordered 3 appetizers: zucchini chips ($5), mozzarella sticks ($7) and a full caesar salad ($9).  I'm impressed with the zucchini chips because they appear house-made but the order consisted of a measly 8 small pieces with dip.  Mozzarella sticks were standard and the caesar salad was a bit too plain but both were better servings than the zucchini chips. The main dish was the classic, large pan pizza with 5 toppings and one premium (taking the base $19 all the way to $39!!!, each topping is $3 and premium is $5, I mean damn!! way too inflated for non-meat options): garlic, tomato, mushroom, onion and meatballs.  Ok definitely do no more than 3 toppings and a meat because otherwise the pie is a mess.  Our pizza was served with an explosion of toppings but of unequal quantity and distribution.  Plus the topics were so crudely chopped that it became annoying grabbing a piece of onion or tomato and grabbing the whole slice.  Even with fork and knife, the toppings are too big.   The crust was good but was too thick, the pizza was almost 70% crust.  The sauce and cheese could not save the pizza from being mostly dough-tasting and the toppings didn't stick or integrate.  When the meatballs were hit, they were a nice addition with good taste and texture.  Yes the crispy cheese crust was amazing but there was so little of it, not as satisfying. Hate to say it but my pizza was almost bland, due to dough amount and few (attached) toppings, my fiancé even attempted to salt her slice.  I see Pequod's potential but my lack of enthusiasm is partially based on my crazy order and abundance of toppings.  Still, the amount of dough in each bite is enough to want to cut the slice in half, horizontally.   The environment is crazy hectic and wait staff is average so they keep my static.  The prices were a bit killer but it's definitely the reputation.  No worries, I'll be back and will make more careful considerations.",0.3906,0.765,0.123,0.113,0.5819363459669581

We started with an order of wings which were nothing special.  There's a few sizes you can choose from and you can pay for additional toppings. I chose spinach and fresh garlic. 45 minutes later our pizzas came out piping hot in a cast iron skillet allowing for a crispy, thick crust.

It was quite packed however, and we were brought upstairs for additional seating. Definitely a divey vibe with the dim lighting and neon signs. We went ahead and just ordered a medium pan pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and mushrooms. This is probably just common sense but don't come hungry because obviously deep dish will take a while to bake and we were dying of hunger waiting for that pie to come out. When it finally arrived at our table, it was glorious. The cheese, the sauce, the MEAT (sausage was so good!!) , the crust all came together to become a symphonic meal. I'm a deep dish noob, so I was taken aback by just how monstrous it was. I was barely able to finish my two slices of pizza, which is pretty shameful for me. Basically, the first piece was heaven, the second piece was a little less enjoyable because I was already strangely full and the crust wasn't as crispy. I was also surprised by the sauce to dough ratio because I had this preconception that Chicago deep dish would be very saucey. I was wrong. Not too mad about it because it clearly works for this pie.

2016-09-28,5.0,"Generally, I'm a pretty calm individual. Unless it comes to pizza. I will literally fight anyone who bad mouths Chicago style pizza. (Why are there so many people who hate on the deep dish?! It's a lot of people I have to fight!) So when I got the opportunity to visit Chicago, and got the opportunity to try authentic deep dish, I was in a pizza-induced haze for the weeks leading up to the trip. My boyfriend's brother lives in Chicago, and recommended Pequod's as a place the locals eat at. Now, I don't know how accurate that statement is, especially since I'm not a local, but it was crowded nonetheless! Very crowded. As a party of 4, it took a little while to get seated, but not long at all to be a bother. (I've had longer waits at an Olive Garden.) We ordered two pizzas, with a multitude of toppings, and waited. Both my boyfriend's brother and the waitress warned that it was going to be a while, so I got a salad also. It was delicious, and helped pass the time while I waited for the magnificence that is Chicago deep dish. And when it came, delivered piping hot to the table, I swear I almost fainted. I wish I got pictures, because it was literally one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen in my life. Much like one of the wonders of the world, it'll take your breath away. Don't even talk to me about my first bite. It's just a void in my memory because as soon as I put a bite in my mouth, I ascended to a different plane of existence. When I came back down, I can remember the bubbly, gooey cheese, and the flavorful robust sauce, and the crunchy, caramelized crust. My mouth is watering just thinking about it now... Oh, how I wish I could go back! The pizza was so good! The service was fantastic, too. And the price, for the literal pounds of food you're getting, is very worth it. And the interior is very cozy and very homey. One of my favorite parts of Chicago, for sure!",0.9944,0.803,0.162,0.035,0.5626094276094278

A group of six of us were excited to enjoy Pequod's pizza after seeing a movie across the street earlier tonight; the pizza fulfilled our cravings but the service left us hungry for attention. We were expecting a decent wait since six of us were going around dinner time; fortunately, the wait was only around 15-20 minutes. But then realized this table was open when we originally checked in with the host staff. Our server mentioned the pizza would take about 45 minutes and suggested the combo appetizer plate while we waited. We did order it but wouldn't suggest spending money on it. We expected the wait for the pizza to be around 45 minutes as she mentioned but in the end it took well over an hour. During our wait we asked the host staff if the Cubs game could be turned on since the Bears game was on every other TV. The original TV we asked for it to be put on was denied; however, they did put it on another TV nearby but only for 5 minutes before another guest said they wanted to watch the Bears. Considering they have several TVs which all had the Bears game on, having the Cubs who had a better chance at winning the game (and did!) didn't seem to much to ask. It took forever for us to receive our bill. The bill also included a drink that one of us ordered although it was never delivered. When we mentioned that to our waitress she first questioned us but then apologized and removed it from the bill.

Not sure if they put cheese or something else in sauce, but it was delicious. (5 stars)  * Onion Rings - crispy and crunchy. They come with BBQ sauce which made them even better (4 stars). * Spinach Thin Crust Pizza - the sauce was bland city. I wouldn't get this again.

It's not located in the downtown area, but it's a definite must if you're visiting Chicago. The trek out is worth it. My buddy and I split a small pizza. They don't have pre-set pizzas on the menu; they really encourage customization. We settled on the cheese only with sausage, pepperoni, mushroom and onion. Talk about out-of-this-world pizza!!! I'm a huge fan of deep-dish and to get an authentic taste of Chicago deep-dish pizza was amazing. Everything, from the crust to the toppings, was delicious. I love how the crust is caramelized and I loved the thickness of the pan pizza. Not to mention, the sausages were huge!! Let's just say that each bite was magical. The wait once you're seated can be a while because they make each pizza to order. It might be a good idea for them to take your order while you're waiting to be seated in order to speed up the process. In any case, the wait is definitely worth it and it's probably one of the best deep dish pizzas I've had. I can't wait to go back when I'm in town!",0.9967,0.774,0.226,0.0,0.5875

If you're ordering takeout, expect to sit there for 10 minutes twiddling your thumbs even if your pizza is ready. They have really bad communication between the counter and kitchen.  Once their power was out during a storm and I remember thinking; ""Oh boy if they can't get it together during normal conditions this'll be a challenge."" I probably waited 45 minutes or so only to be told they lost my order.

2016-09-10,4.0,"Let me preface this review by saying that I'm not a super big fan of pizza, no matter it's shape or form, but I can appreciate a good deal when I see it. My wife and I wanted to experience the Chicago Deep Dish pizza and found this place to be well loved by the Yelp community. First of all, if you are relying on public transportation, be willing to go on a mini hike across the LePaul campus to get to this little gem. We came here on a weekday, just barely making it to the lunch specials, which was a personal 7"" cheese pizza for less than $5. That is freaking amazing! Of course, we splurged a little bit more, added numerous toppings, and got a small side salad for $2 and a local, honey infused root beer. Alright, I wasn't a big fan of the salad or the root beer, but it wasn't that bad either. You can see from the menu that Pequod makes each pizza individually, with a minimum wait of 30 minutes to accommodate for the toppings. I initially thought we'd be safe from that wait time since the restaurant was fairly empty (which is unusual, based on the reviews), but I guess the wait time is unique to a deep dish pizza. MY biggest disappointment, aside from the pizza being salty, was that it was served on a regular plate, instead of a deep dish. Ok, so 7"" pizza may not have needed it, but it would have given an unique illusion of a deep dish pizza. We eagerly scarfed down the pizza and found it to be perfect sufficient for the two of us. Unfortunately, I got incredibly nauseous a few hours after lunch, so I had to dock a point for that.

We placed our order, and our waitress informed us that the pizza would take about 75 minutes. I wish they would have told us that earlier, but we decided to wait it out since we already made it this far. They weren't lying when they said 75 minutes.  When the pizza finally arrived, we devoured it in less than 10 minutes. Was it amazing? Yes! Would I wait 3 hours again? Probably not. Next time, we're gonna try to avoid the weekend dinner crowd. Waiting 3 hours for a pizza is kind of ridiculous. Plus, they have a great lunch deal.  Now back to the pizza. The bottom of the crust was buttery and golden, with just the right amount of crunch.

My goodness I came in at 7 pm called ahead of time I understood it was a two hour wait.  This was no surprise,  a place like this I would expect nothing less.  The problem here is I talked this place up to my family for a few days, they were in town visiting....So anyway I walked in at 7 pm they said the wait is two hours.  So I explained to the kids up front running wait list I get the wait is two hours we would like to put our name on the list well be back at 9pm. They put our name on the list...great.... Two hours later we get there at 9pm on the dot.  I get they don't take reservations. Any who, the same kid that took my name down I tell him hey bud we put our name on the list at 7pm we decided we would go down the street to a bar instead of scratch myself on the sidewalk for two hours.....This kids with a big ole smirk on his face tells me is gonna be another hour wait and we're checked in at 9pm....wait is 50 mins........what?! I explain to the kid (s) didn't you say it was a two hour wait at 7pm and you TOOK THE NAME DOWN AT 7PM! Not one crap given, instead I got this 16 year old giving me a huge smirk right to my face and making jokes to his coworkers like I was the bleeping pinata....then went on to respectively run his mouth....the point being, teach your employees to represent your business with respect.

2016-07-26,2.0,"SO OVERRATED. First of all, the fact that everyone raves about this place as the best pizza place in Chicago is pure bs. This was my first trip to Chicago and I've been hearing that this place and Lou Mal something are supposed to be the best. Boy was I SO DISAPPOINTED! I should've known when I arrived at this tiny hole in the wall looking bar scene that the fact that this place has more than 3 thousand reviews is a little suspicious and most likely due to some incentive given for checking in or writing a good review.  Anyways, on to the pizza. So my husband  and I were super excited to try some really good authentic Chicago pan pizza. We ordered the cheese with mushrooms onions and olives. Visually, the pizza looked kind of dull and grayish all over, which I do not know why since all the veggies are supposed to make it look colorful.  TASTE: SO BLAND and BARELY ANY CHEESE !!!!! I felt like I was eating a fat piece of bread with veggies on it. The bread to cheese ratio is so off. I hate pizza that does not have enough cheese that's the fun part ! Eating the gooey cheese with a good amount of sauce and a nice balanced crust. But anyways, this is what killed it for me. Pizza Hut has more flavor than this place sadly to say.  CRUST: The ONLY good part was the outer burnt edges of the pan pizza. The pan dough that the pizza is baked on however, was so bland and nothing special.  COST: What also was annoying is the fact that they charge $2 which so much for each topping and they have no options to choose from, only cheese and you pick whatever toppings you want. They already charge $16 for a medium which is way overpriced anyways. For such a tiny hole in the wall they charge so much. The place definitely does not reflect the quality or taste of the pizza.  Overall Review: DO NOT get fooled by the massive amount of reviews. That's the only reason I picked this place as our first Chicago pizza experience over Lou Malnatis or any other famous ones. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY here ! I honestly am so baffled at how in the heck this place is famous. SO DISAPPOINTED.",0.6225,0.804,0.105,0.091,0.5741300366300366

My parents were visiting for dinner so I ordered a pizza for pick-up. When I arrived to get the order, the restaurant was swamped with at least 20 people waiting outside for their tables and even more waiting for their to go orders inside. A woman also picking up a pizza had an issue with her order but I didn't give it much thought until I brought my pizza home. After digging in, I realized there was a number of things wrong with the order and I sent a Facebook message to let the management know since something seemed to be happening in the kitchen causing orders to come out incorrect. I received a response that night offering to send a gift card, which wasn't at all necessary, but certainly appreciated. I received the gift card two days later and just went to enjoy a Friday night out for dinner. Upon arrival, we were told the wait was significant so they recommended we wait at a new bar two doors down where a receipt for our purchase there would give us a discount at Pequod's. The wait was much shorter than anticipated and we were able to place our order immediately once seated. The beer was exactly what we wanted on this steamy evening, the pizza was perfect and our Friday night was everything I wanted!

2016-07-13,5.0,"Hard to believe that I've been to Pequod's as much as I have and never bothered to write a review until now.  Let me start by saying I like this place so much that we held our rehearsal dinner here.  They have a back room upstairs that you can rent out that holds about 50 people, and I want to say they charged $40 per person for all you can eat and drink (including draft beer and I think house wine).  That would have been around May 2013, so not sure how pricing is now. I've had most if not all of the ""famous"" places around Chicago, and nothing will ever beat Pequod's for me.  I can't even tell you how many friends over the years I've turned on to this place.  Some are local and have since made it their staple place, and some are distant and now make this a priority stop when passing through Chicago.  I'll specifically never understand how anyone can like Lou Malnati's ""wheel of sausage"" pizza better than this. Regarding the pizza, the crust is amazing.  I know that it may not be ""traditional"" deep dish, but it's thick as hell and impossible to eat more than two slices, so it's deep dish to me.  When I eat the crust on most deep dish, it seems like I'm just eating a lot of cooked bread.  Pequod's caramelizes the crust, and most lovers would agree it's the highlight.  The sauce is also delicious, as well as the toppings.  My personal favorite pie is pepperoni, Canadian bacon, & giardiniera.  If you like spicy, the giardiniera is absolutely delicious (most of my non-Chicago friends don't even know that's a thing). Word to the wise, if you go at a time when most places are crowded, be prepared to wait a while to be seated, and to receive your food if you order deep dish (since it takes longer obviously).  This is Chicago after all, and any good restaurant is slammed when you'd expect it to be.  However, you can call ahead to make reservations, and last time I was there they accommodated a party of 14 for us on a Saturday night no problem, but I did call weeks in advance.  Also, a trick is that if you know what you want to order, you can place your order while you wait, so that once you are seated, your food comes out much faster than if they take your order at that point. Regarding the service, we've had some wait staff that was better/worse than others.  It's never been amazing and never been terrible, so we've never really thought much about it.  It's never gotten in the way of the goal, which is devouring as much of their pizza as possible before face planting.",0.995,0.816,0.146,0.039,0.5377492877492878

Luckily we had came before the rush so it only took about 15-20 minutes which is standard btw.  The pizza was amazing. They cook the crust with cheese so it's like a crispy cheese crust. Just imagine when you melt cheese in a frying pan and it turns that golden brown. Imagine a piece of that on the crust. Every bite is just the right amount of oozing cheese, pepperoni, sauce and crust.

We got extremely lucky as there was practically no wait on a Sunday night. Our server was great, super friendly and willing to accommodate changes to our order.  The pizza took about an hour to get ready, so definitely order some appetizers. Their cheesy garlic bread dipped in marinara is delicious and extremely hot, so give yourself a minute or two before you devour it. I highly recommend the wings as well. I personally prefer the barbecue wings over the buffalo, which has a nice kick if that's what you're feeling.  As for the pizza, there's no doubt about the ""deep dish"" part. It's thicker than the ones served at Lou's. One slice can count as two slices of a normal pizzas. You get to pick your own toppings.

No, no, not even a little bit, but I will, because, like putting a flower in your hair in San Francisco, stuffing your face full of deep dish pizza as a visitor in Chicago only seems customary. To say that this was my 6th meal in a row of deep dish pizza would not be an exaggeration for I had had Giordano's pizza & the exorbitant amount of leftovers.  Ignoring my stomach and the inevitable onset of lactose intolerance, I went to meet a friend from Iceland at Pequod's because he felt similarly about deep dish pizza as a visitor. Even on a Tuesday, the wait was well over 30+ minutes during dinner time although it could have been correlated to a sports game that was playing that day. Local friends we were with had a light pre dinner snack of sushi next door- pregaming for pizza like troopers they are. Finally, bliss in sitting down at a table! But wait, pizzas are running 40-50 minutes. No worries, there is beer & cider. It feels really natural waiting for food, so I didn't mind a bit, but for those who get hangry, take take time into consideration.  It's a really casual vibe- TV with the game on, bar stools, chill waiters with witty jokes- the works. The pizza compared to Giordano's was better. The thing that stands out is the crust, which is really crispy and delicious. We had a vegetarian at the table, so we had half a veggie pizza and the other with sausage. One apple cider and one slice in, it was game over for me. Others managed to eat two.  This is apparently the place to come to for deep dish, so I am satisfied.

2016-06-30,3.0,"**This rating is based on Chicago pizza joints. Pequod's would score a higher rating when compared with pizza in Austin, TX for example. I feel that most every Chicagoan has their favorite when it comes to pizza. For me, growing up, it was Giordano's. While Gio's is still a classic, a few years ago my favorite switched to Lou Malnati's which I only tolerated as a kid funny enough (not all locations are created equal, the Lincoln Park location is one of the best). I've heard rumblings over the past few years that Pequod's was not to be missed. My brother had heard the same and we finally tried them out. The atmosphere has a pretty standard sports bar/pizza place vibe that works. A Euro Cup match was being played while we ate which was nice. Now for the pizzas. First, I would say don't even mess with their thin crust. We tried a slice just to test it out and to me, it was on level with microwavable pizza in terms of flavor and texture. Their pan pizza is definitely an upgrade. We got a large with sausage, mushrooms, and fresh basil. As a whole, I'd say it was good, but no new craving has been created and now I feel the need to go to get my Lou Malnati's on before heading out of town. I will say that their sausage and burnt crust were the two clear highlights and the bottom of their crust was crispy throughout. They were not cheap with toppings either as they piled them on. Also, there was a guy there who I'm guessing is either the owner or the GM and he was really really nice and you could tell he had genuine care for his patrons. They do a solid pan pizza here that is worth checking out. P.S. Always always always avoid ordering a personal pizza at any Chicago deep dish place.

I have been going to Pequod's for the past 10 years.  I love two types of pizza Thin Crust and Pan.  This review is based on Pan pizza. Nowhere have I tried a better Pan pizza other than Pequod's. Their Thin crust pizza is not as great as their Pan,  I would say mediocre to any other Mom and Pops shop.  Moving forward with their Pan pizza you can expect a HIT OR A MISS. By this I mean they're not always consistent. I've been going to this place so often that I know when they get their ingredients right on cue. Sometimes, they add too much cheese, other times they overwhelm you with water down sauce. Even so, when they do get it right all I could say is COWABUNGA! The infused  burned cheese with the sweet crunch crust touching that flavorful tomato sauce that makes my friend Leonardo scream WICKED AWESOME! Moving forward, this place can get hectic. Every time I go I always have hours to spare so I don't mind the wait.  Having some beers while waiting is the norm. Appetizers are 7/10 nothing special, but great to kill some time. I rather stick to the pizza and beers. Staff are most of the time attentive. I see how they can become agitated by all the customers, but work with them and they'll work with you. Like I said if you come to this place don't expect to have that perfect pan pizza all the time. I heard from friends that their second location is better than the Chicago location.

Service is not good, but its not bad either. Our waitress attended to us within a reasonable time, considering it was a full house.  The crust gets alot of attention here, but I think the best part is the combination of everything. The main player in this pizza is the bread. Usually a hunk of bread that thick would be dry and disappointing. Here, the pizza is fluffy and moist. The toppings burst with flavor. I still dont know whether I like the pepperoni or the sausage more. The cheese was just enough to be gooey but not overwhelming. They could have added a little more sauce, but I think I preferred it on the less saucy side. the caramel crust was cooked just right, but its not mind blowing as some people make it.

2016-06-14,4.0,"Trust in the crust, not in the service. Pequod's is considered by many (the vivacious LeAnn P among them) to serve one of Chicago's best pizzas, and after a visit this past weekend I can believe the hype. It takes either a very special pie or a very special lady to get me to eat deep dish (as I much prefer thin crust); in this case it was a little bit of both.  Fortunately we came early enough in the evening before great masses crowded the place, so getting a table was no problemo. Knowing that their Chicago-style was legendary (3,000 reviews on Yelp, god damn!), we hastily asked for a 10"" pan with pepperoni, sausage, and green peppers.  Pequod's is famous for their burnt cheese crust, which comes out black and delicious (much like Drake). Thirty minutes seems like an eternity when you're craving the 'za, but eventually it arrived and we dug in with little hesitation.  Great sauce, plentiful toppings, and a blackened cheesy pan crust had me singing their praises.  It was incredible, folks.  I'd say my expectations were high and even they got surpassed.  I still feel weird eating pizza with a knife and fork, but when it's as good as Pequod's I could honestly care less. Bread = 4.5 Circuses = 2.5 The 'za was as good as the service was bad.  But in what way? Our server Alex greeted us, got in our pizza order and brought us drinks, after which she pretty much vanished.  When our deep dish finally arrived, a different girl brought it out and sliced it for us, who later also brought us more refreshments......so where did Alex go?  Maybe she quit.  Perhaps a family emergency?  Noooooope!  Turns out, she was just chillin' at the bar, hobnobbing with some locals while enjoying a glass of wine and a slice.  Apparently, her shift had ended.  Areyouf*ckingkiddingme? I had no words.  None to describe how flabbergasted I was that our original waitress totally bailed on us without warning.  A quick ""hey, I'm closing out, (new waitress) will be taking over for me"", would have sufficed but we didn't even get that much.  When the check came, I wanted to confirm that Alex wouldn't get diddly squat tip-wise for abandoning her customers, but as the server was listed as ""CZ01"" (whatever the sh*t THAT means), I've really no way of knowing. The men's bathroom had a ton of graffiti in it, but not the cool kind like at Emporium Barcade where it's intentional in an edgy sort of way.  Here, it was a normal, clean-ish bathroom that a bunch of people straight up vandalized. lol It's not that I wouldn't want to return here-- because the pan pie is really, REALLY good --but since everybody and their grandma claims that they're ""Chicago's best pizza"" I feel obligated to try them all before making a 2nd lap around town. Get here early to avoid the swarm of people, and pray that your server doesn't randomly disappear.",0.9952,0.781,0.161,0.058,0.5615522572665429

The place was packed and there were a lot of us. You can't make a reservation and we ended up waiting close to 2 hours to be seated. We ordered salads and the appetizer sampler to tide us over for when we finally sat down and the had to wait another hour for our pizzas. (For those keeping track, we had to wait 3 hours to eat.)  The crust is as amazing as you've heard. Crunchy, caramelized, crispy. The sauce has a bit of a kick to it, which I didn't love. There could have been a little more cheese. Overall, it was good pizza but I was underwhelmed. That could have been from waiting 3 hours to eat, or it could be that I just like pizza the way they make it at home in NYC.

We would have liked to order more beer but we never got the chance to.  We placed our food order and the waitress left, at which point I'm assuming she was abducted or went into a coma in the back of the restaurant.  After about 30 minutes of staring into empty beer glasses, our pizza came.  We asked the bus boy to send our waitress back and he nodded, but she never appeared.

2016-05-30,4.0,"Came here with my friend for lunch to try another Chicago-style pizza place, since I had tried Lou Malnati's during my visit to Chicago last year. We were seated immediately upon entering. The interior is not huge; the restaurant is deep but not very wide. The atmosphere was very pub/bar like, which I did not expect.  Service was friendly and our waitress was great. She said it would be about a 45-minute wait for deep dish pizza, so we tried to place our order quickly. I think the actual wait time ended up being just a little over thirty minutes though.  I also ordered one slice of thin crust just to try, and added one of the ""premium toppings"" of Italian beef (apparently also very Chicago) to it. It was a big slice and not bad, but I prefer my thin crust even crunchier (think New York-style pizza, and yes, I realize that I shouldn't be expecting that while in Chicago).  All of the deep dishes start off with just cheese and you customize your pie from that point after picking a size. Each additional topping costs extra, and the cost of each topping depends on the diameter of your pizza. You can also order half-toppings (I think it means it is only put on half of your pizza) and premium toppings.  The deep dish was decent, but not particularly memorable in my opinion. I enjoyed the ""caramelized edges"" mentioned on the menu, but instead of the crunchy crust I was expecting, it was actually just darkened cheese which they must sprinkle along the pan's edge. I think I prefer a crunchier crust overall, which is why I usually get thin crust during the rare occasions that I eat pizza at all. I'm glad I tried Pequod's and their food is not bad, but I think Lou Malnati's better suits my tastes (just a personal opinion).",0.991,0.875,0.121,0.005,0.4804325304325304

Our waitress noted that the pizza takes 40 minutes to bake, so we opted to order an appetizer. We got the sampler that came with mozzerella sticks, mushrooms, poppers, and zucchini... all of which were fried and of a similar quality that you would get at Denny's. Luckily we didn't have to spend that much time eating the appetizer because 25 minutes later, our pizza arrived! Wait, I thought it took 40 minutes, but whatever we dug in. We got a pretty standard sausage, mushroom, peppers and basil, They really piled on the toppings and the sausage chunks were huge and looked home made.  The first bite was delicious until I got to the uncooked dough, a nice layer right beneath the cheese and right above the rest of the cooked crust that was still mushy and raw. Well it was in the center of the pizza so maybe it was just that part. 2nd bite, uncooked. 3rd bite, uncooked. 4th bite, uncooked. It was at this point that we asked our waitress to return the pizza to the oven to cook more and she was kind to oblige. 5 minutes later (for a total of 30 minutes oven time), our pizza came back piping hot. But that layer of uncooked dough was still there.  Yes, the caramelized crust (read: burnt cheese) is delicious, but the sauce and the rest of the pizza are nothing to write home about.

Not helping was the caesar salad we got in a bid to offset the pizza; it was just leaves with a gloomy dressing and hard croutons.

It was a Sunday evening and my wife called to see what the wait would be in an hour. They told her no wait. When we arrived, the place was packed and the wait time was 30-60 minutes for 2. This isn't necessarily their fault. You can't predict rushes of customers. Maybe a better way to say it would be there shouldn't be a wait but we can't guarantee anything. This was only the beginning of our wait.  It was suggested that we can also sit at the bar, which is full service. We went upstairs and found 2 seats at the bar. The 2 bartenders were very nice and attentive. They had about 8 beers on tap, all light and hoppy so we stuck with water. We ordered a small Caesar salad to share and 2 individual pan pizzas. About 20 minutes later, the salad arrived. After waiting that long for a salad, it should have arrived in a bowl that had just been woven by master craftsmen. It didn't. It was a small salad, enough for 2 to share if your not very hungry. The dressing was very good. Nice taste of Parmesan.  We waited just under an hour for our 2 personal pizzas. There is no excuse for that kind of wait without letting the customers know so they can chose whether they want to stay or not. We weren't given that option and we had walked for an hour to get here.  The redeeming things were the staff and the pizza. I ordered a personal pan with sausage, pepperoni and garlic. It was delicious. Probably the best pan pizza I have had. We at at Lou Malnati's last time and, in my opinion, this was far superior a pizza. The caramelized crust was awesome. The sausage, our bartender told us, was made just for the restaurant and had a fantastic flavor and consistency. The sauce was a little sweeter than I usually like but with the crust and toppings, it was perfect.  If not for the wait, I would go back again. Maybe try at another time. Pizza gets a 5 star rating.

It's appropriately filled up 4 people, and compared to the other major pizza spots around town it was actually a little bit cheaper(large pizza w/2 toppings $24.65). The first bites were actually pretty amazing; the cheese by then was still very gooey and, being a pan pizza, the crust was crisp but also incredibly fluffy. It's not like the buttercrust at Lou's where you have something of a more pot-pie consistency, this is straight up large pan pizza. Also, was a little skeptical about the caramelized cheese crust at first, but after trying it I'm a fan. Not as incredibly amazing as most people say it is(I mean, at that point you can't really even taste that it's cheese), but the texture is great and I think I'd prefer it to other deep dish pizzas in that regard(after all, you're still getting plenty of the thicky doughy goodness on the base of the pizza...no need to have more on the sides). The pepperoni were nothing special, and would opt for the sausage next time. One dangerous downside...after initially amazing first few slices, once it cools down a little bit you actually realize how much of it is actually dough compared to filling. Whereas with say giordano's you really have a ton of sauce and toppings and the pizza dough is maybe 1/3 the width of the entire pizza, here it's the opposite; the dough actually accounts for like 75% of the height. Once it cools down this becomes very apparent, as you notice the thin layer of cheese and toppings compared to the dough. That said it's all super fluffy so it doesn't feel as if there is that ratio upon eating it, but it does take its toll after a while. So final deep dish verdict? Actually a fan, and would say this hits the right price point too. Only major cons are that I didn't get the sausage(not their fault), and that there is a lot of (albeit very fluffy) dough which makes the ratio seem a bit off.",0.9802,0.854,0.106,0.039,0.47447691197691194

2016-05-15,1.0,"I am on vacation in Chicago and went yesterday. What a mistake! My friend/host during this trip called ahead and made a ""priority seating"" arrangement for our four person party for 7pm. We arrived a bit early and checked in. We were told that our ""priority seating"" got us a 45 min - 1 hour wait. Uh, ok. So we go outside and wait.  After 1 hour we check back in, only to be told that we have ""at least another half hour"" to wait. We're disappointed, but we wait. After half an hour, we check back in. Again, we are told that we have ""at least another half hour."" So the 45 min - 1 hour wait that we were promised turned into a 2 hour minimum wait. Ridiculous. We mulled over our options and decided to stick it out. We finally got seated around 9pm.  After we were seated, three of us ordered beers and we asked the waitress about pizza ordering time (we tried to see if we could pre-order while we were outside, but were told they don't do that after 5pm on weekends). She told us that the pizza would take up to an hour and 25 minutes to arrive. Good grief. After several minutes, the waitress brings me my Blue Moon. But a lot of time goes by and my two friends' beers are nowhere to be seen. We flag down the waitress and it turns out she lost their order, so she has to retake it.  Finally, the pizza arrives. I got a personal pizza with ground beef, mushrooms, and garlic. Just FYI, some people will tell you the pan crust is deep dish, but it is not. The ground beef was under seasoned (actually, the pizza as a whole was, come to think of it) and there's not enough cheese on it. I had to keep adding parmesan and oregano.  All in all, horrible experience. Spent nearly 4 hours on eating mediocre pizza.

I was originally going to go to Lou Malnati's but my well-traveled friends steered me to Pequod's which is apparently where the real Chicagans go. My group of 4 waited an hour to be seated at 8pm on a Thursday. It took close to another hour before we actually got our deep dish pie.  Caesar salad (9) - Pretty basic. It was pricey considering the salad came with nothing but what tasted like packaged croutons and one lone cherry tomato. Large w/ italian beef, mushrooms, onions (30) - Chicago is know for its italian beef sandwich so I figured may as well hit 2 birds with 1 stone and get it on my pie. The pizza came piping hot and the cheese were perfectly gooey. Pequod's is known for the burnt cheese that coats the edge of the pie and that was probably my favorite part. I'm usually not big on crust and unfortunately Pequod's wasn't an exception. I like my crust to be crispier but theirs is on the doughy, airy side. Was it delicious? Hell yes.

2016-05-09,3.0,"You clearly need to make a big decision regarding deep dish pizza, so I'll make this brief and hopefully useful: Pequods makes a solid deep dish. They're ""famous"" for their carmelized crust, which is really just burnt cheese around the edges. You will wait a very long time to eat it (45 mins from the time you order, that's not counting waiting for your table). You will be tempted to order a salad, because waiting 45 mins to put food in your mouth seems unbearable. The salad will be the saddest excuse for a salad you've seen, a complete waste of stomach space, but you'll be somewhat happy to not be starving anymore. Your pizza will finally arrive almost an hour later, and you will inevitably think it's the best pizza known to man, mainly because your stomach is half-full of sad romaine. But this! This is hot & cheesy and bready. Your rational brain may kick in and remind you: this is merely cheese & sauce on a thick piece of dough -- don't get so excited. Ok, ok, the edges are crispy, and that part is incredible, you wish you could eat a whole pizza made of the edges. You will then wonder: did I just order this monstrous pizza just to eat its edges? Perhaps. Perhaps you did. But that's what people do in Chicago, so there must be something to it.  If that didn't help you make your decision, I'll just add: this pizza may not change your life, but it will fill your belly, and sometimes that's good enough. You'll also experience an authentic, bustling, pizza parlor vibe that doesn't feel touristy (except for all the people who are clearly tourists). The beer selection is pretty basic. The servers are all in a hurry, but remain nice enough. And those salads - please don't.  There are lots of places in Chicago and beyond that make a tasty deep dish. Little Star Pizza in CA is still my favorite of them all, and they aren't in Chicago. The end.",0.9931,0.815,0.155,0.03,0.5288333333333333

I walked like miles off the train for this pizza and I don't go far out of my way (which at the time it seems like I was walking forever) but it was WORTH IT, amazing and the people were rocking. 1) I don't need to even comment first on the pizza - because let it speak for itself. I liked the atmosphere. Cute, on the corner - walked in - we were greeted right away with smiles and ""What can we help you with!"" Awesome! They were so gracious and kind - basically knew it was me! We were thirsty and they got us cups to go, accommodated us for our road walking journey with a speedy check out. I was so grateful. I wanted to stay! 2) Pizza smelled so good in that box. Good price too although I just got myself a small thick crust cheese (basic) but it was piping hot and I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. Rich and saucy. I was in heaven. I couldn't eat it all and that says miles for an appetite like mine. I was fortunate enough to pass it off to someone in passing that probably needed it more than me and they got to share in Pequod's Yumminess too.

However, I actually debated my deep devoutness and commitment to thin crust pizza after taking just one bite of my personal deep dish mushroom pizza from Pequod's. I would be satisfied eating the crust alone, that's how delicious it really is. The crust is made from basically cheese that crisps and caramelizes while cooking. The inside of the pizza is not as dense as I would have expected from a deep dish pizza. It was creamy, light, and I didn't feel gross after chowing.

For people that are uninitiated to Chicago pizza, I always say that you must try a couple of places and compare it to other Pan/Deep Dish places. You will be unsatisfied if you compare Pequods to other pizza you've had because of the difference in the category. Also, be careful reading any reads on Yelp -- always see where they're from! Most people giving low reviews to Pequods are out of towners and have not had Pequods or any deep dish pizza place more than once. If you compare it on it's merit to other Pizza, you'll be disappointed because there is no proper comparison (apples to oranges, both are fruit, but quite different.)   The one thing that Pequods has over it's closely competitor is the amazing crust. It's caramelized and burnt looking but it's toppings are no joke. Equipped with a fork and knife, it's a difficult proposition to eat more than a couple of slices. Generally, a large can feed a group of five or more! My only advice is to actually request more sauce. On lazy days, the pizza may come out too dry and a dry pizza is no good. More sauce gives it more of a hearty tomato taste that really balances out the superior Pequods crust.  Otherwise, pick your favorite toppings (Note: pepperoncini is not pepperonis, don't learn the hard way).  Overall, the place is good for groups EXCEPT on any game day which will inflate your wait for both the pizza and a table. I wouldn't necessarily suggest bringing a family here either especially with younger kids or older adults because it has a very bar-y feel to the restaurant. Otherwise, it's a great place for friends (esp. those visiting from out of town to convert to Chicago pizza believers).",0.9752,0.801,0.13,0.069,0.5570294784580498

2016-04-04,3.0,"I'm so torn about Pequod's. I know a lot of people love it, even close friends of mine, but I find it really basic. I've tried it on a few occasions--twice for takeout, and recently I stopped in to eat at the restaurant. It's definitely bready and more of a pan pizza than a deep dish, at least to me. I find that with takeout just getting it with plain cheese wasn't enjoyable. It just congeals and also loses its crispy texture underneath. I think the toppings are what offset the breadiness of the crust. That being said, the caramelized crust is really delicious, even as leftovers.  My husband and I stopped in a few weeks ago on a Saturday night around 4pm. It was already pretty busy but it was only a 20 minute wait for a table, and they told us pizzas were taking 50 minutes. We got a table upstairs that was in the corner, which was nice. Our waitress was nice but I have to say the service was extremely disappointing. It took forever just to get a drink and our appetizer came out and was the wrong thing. A few tables around us also received wrong orders. We shared the house salad with ranch, and the dressing was really tasty. The wings, once we got the correct ones, were pretty crispy and had a nice BBQ sauce. Our pizza ended up taking almost an hour and a half to get to us and by this point we were starving even after apps. It was very cheesy and had good flavor. I like their sauce, it's not too sweet or too tangy. We did half with sausage and onion and half with cheese. I definitely prefer the side with toppings-- it offsets how thick the crust is. Eventually our area started to get really crowded and there was a big group of drunk people that snuck past the host and were trying to order pizza without waiting. The waitstaff just kind of let it happen, which was frustrating because it caused us to have to wait a really long time to get our check and leave. Overall I think the pizza is good, and I don't mind eating it, but I don't find it special. I also think that other Chicago ""deep dish"" varieties like Lou's are much better and have a much more enjoyable ambiance at their locations.

I highly recommend going to their website and making a reservation right away. They will text you a day before to confirm your ressie and you're set. When we walked in on a Saturday night at 7pm it was PACKKKED. The party of 2 ahead of us was given a 2.5 hour wait time. We were a party of 7 and we were seated right away. MAKE A RESERVATION. Loud, large dive bar feel.  + bruschetta - Skip it. It's bland and not good at all here. + ravioli pesto and marinara - Both were tasty, but nothing to brag about. If you're craving ravioli and want to order one, I'd say go with the pesto. + PIZZAAAAAA CRUST - their ""caramelized crust"" is their specialty and what separates them from the rest. It's basically burnt layers of cheese -- ok that doesn't sound too appetizing but trust me, it's so crunchy and SO good.  TOPPINGS - You can choose your own toppings (from basic and premium lists). They say  not to pile too much on. -- Sausage and pepperoni - per our waiter's recommendation. Basic, but SO SOLID. I think would've been better with mushrooms and bell peppers. -- Bell peppers, mushrooms, and Italian beef - also per our waiter's recommendation.

Unfortunately, right when I entered I waited 5-10 minutes at the door when the bartender and the host were talking. I was seated after with no menu and had to get up to ask for one. Server took 20 minutes to approach my table and another 20 min for a glass of water. Our appetizers arrived and our sample platter was undercooked. The batter was soggy from the inside and the mushrooms were dried out. The two tables after us had gotten their pizza and my table was still waiting. The pizza arrives after an hour of waiting on a slow Monday night and it was wrong. I'm a vegetarian and was given a sausage mushroom pizza when I asked for half sausage and half spinach. The waitress came back and rudely said we had to wait another 45 min for another pizza and didn't offer an apology. I was I furious by this point I paid and left. I paid for horrible service and food. I called the restaurant and a lady under the name Mariah picks up, without any greeting and says ""hey"" I explained to her what happened and reads 6 different orders but my order. She says ""I can't do nothing for you you can call Thursday Shawn will be here and will fix your problem"".

They don't even come close to Pequod's. Come early or call-in before you arrive to get on the list. My husband and I came on a Saturday night and were predicted a 2-hour wait. No worries though, we walked to the Drinkbird, just 2 stores down from Pequod's, for a drink while waiting. And shortly after finishing our first drink, we were notified that our table was ready. We waited for ~ 45 minutes before our table was ready. Just in case you were wondering, Barnes and Nobles is out of range for the sensor to work. Trust me, we asked them too.  What makes Pequod's so unique is their crust. That caramelized crust is so delicious that there are no words that can properly describe how amazing it tastes. You just have to come and try it yourself. I promise you you won't regret it, and it's worth the wait. You have to pay extra for each topping, but don't worry, they are very generous with their toppings.

The bathrooms are a disaster of ancient plumbing and water leaking on the floor. I hope it was only water. Pequod's is not kitschy or old school or hip, it's just tired, very tired. Even the bar looks forlorn and obviously neglected with cheap decorations and unstocked shelves. I'm sure the owners make a mint on the place.

Let me just say that I understand why it's called a ""pie"" now. In fact, that's how I can best describe it - a very tomatoey, very cheesy, very meaty pie, with a hot, crisp crust! We went for a medium sausage pizza to be shared by 4, and underestimated how large and heavy it will be. It took 45-50 minutes to prepare, but two slices, and I was done!

We figured we would give it a try and get it delivered to our hotel. Horrible idea! We placed the order at 11:25 pm. We ordered a meatball sandwich, half order of wings, mozzarella sticks, fries, and a slice of cake The food didn't arrive until almost 1:00 am. Here is the worst part, they completely forgot the meatball sandwich! No sandwich at all. We called back and we were offered a ""partial refund"" not even sure for how much yet as the refund hasn't went through on my credit card just yet. We were then told the meatball sub would be right out. It didn't arrive until 2:00 am and we had to get up at 7:00 am the next morning. In the meantime waiting we tried the rest of the food. The mozzarella sticks obviously sat for quite awhile. The fries were extremely soggy and just barely cooked. The cake had a very odd refrigerator smell to it. The only thing decent enough were the wings, but you don't get much of them.  When the meatball sub arrived the delivery guy offered us a free pineapple and jalapeño pizza because ""he couldn't deliver it"". We didn't want it but just said okay with no real intentions of eating it. We opened it up just to see and as I predicted the pizza was burnt! Basically their apology was a burnt pizza someone else didn't want. $38 for some of the worst food I have ever eaten. Absolutely horrible! I would never eat from them again even if the food was free. Just disgusting. They should of refunded the entire order. The free burnt pizza was really offensive and only annoyed me further. The worst service ever!!! Edit: I got my refund today. Only $9.16 which I guess was for the meatball sub. The way the woman over the phone made it sound was that I would be at least getting half the order refunded for their mistake. Oh well.

Their sauce is bomb and they have an excellent variety of toppings to choose from. If you like the classics - pepperoni, sausage, spinach, mushrooms, onions, etc. they'll have it and they are always fresh and delicious. If you are feeling adventurous I recommend trying a version of a Hawaiian pizza with jalapeños, Canadian bacon (and/or bacon) and pineapple. Their ""secret"" is the caramelized cheese around the crust.

2016-02-15,4.0,"We often go to Pequod's with another couple prior to going to see a movie at the Webster 11 across the street.  This is one of our favorite pies in the city. The Good: The pizza.  Both the deep dish and the thin crust are exemplary.  The other item we really enjoy are the Jalapeno Poppers; they are filled with cheddar cheese instead of the typical cream cheese and it makes for a very delicious appetizer.  I would encourage anyone to try the sampler as well.  This place also has some great beer selections; I'm personally a big fan of the Half Acre Lead Feather. The Bad: Occasionally they will overcook the pizza, usually the pan.  A couple times I've had mine come out with a burnt bottom, which doesn't ruin the meal but is rather disappointing. Also, if you order a Pan Pizza it will take over an hour... not necessarily a bad thing but definitely something to keep in mind. The Ugly: Make sure you call ahead for seating, the host stand is a hot nightmare.  Everything is done old school with pen and paper and everything is very disorganized.  My wife and I once had to eat at the bar because we had been told we had an hour and a half wait after having waited for an hour and a half already (I think the host got his sheets of paper out of order and was seating people who had just showed up while we continued to wait).  I understand it's not easy to deal with a restaurant when it is as small as Pequod's and gets as busy as Pequod's does, but the people at the host stand are often overwhelmed and nowhere near up to the task. That said, this place is a Chicago staple for a reason, and a definite must-eat for anyone trying to sample the city's best pizza.",0.946,0.833,0.115,0.052,0.5111111111111112

2016-01-14,5.0,"I hit up Lou's and Pequod's on my recent trip to Chicago and I have to admit Pequod's wins. It was a much more satisfying pizza that was still tasty on the flight home the next day. We ordered a sausage and giardiniera on our pie and they were fantastic. Quick comparison, Lou's has a thinner style crust that is formed into an pan and is really crispy and a thick layer of fresh cheese and a hearty very fresh tasting sauce, not very greasy even with the buttered crust. Pequod's on the other hand is a thicker crust formed into the pan that is amazingly flavorful and juicy, The cheese is dripping off the edge of the pie and is much more of your decadent style pizza cheese. The house made sausage is not as fully loaded across the pie as Lou's does but it is everywhere and it is very tasty and you can tell it is made fresh. The sauce is not as hearty as Lou's but is more flavorful (in my opinion). The giardiniera was this awesomely spicy little Italian pepper that really provided a great kick of spicy to the pizza. Think more long hots flavor than jalapeno. Finally, I think the caramelized crust wins over the buttered crust hands down. It is an awesome layer of crispy deliciousness!.  It was worth trying both since it was my first time there but on my next visit it is Pequod's or bust.  Side note: call ahead and get your name on the list. They don't do reservations but you can call on your way over because this place is packed and even after your wait it takes 35 minutes for your pies to cook.

2016-01-04,2.0,"Two words: Underwhelming. Disappointing. But this review is solely for the ""thin-crust"" pizza. I feel like I'm the only Chicagoan (or visitor of any kind) who has something bad to say but I have to say it for anyone who, like me, actually don't like thick pizzas. Sorry, Chicago, but I love me some NY-style pizza. It's the real thing. :P I was with friends who wanted to try the place and thought I'd have a great experience like the many other patrons. However, I guess my first mistake was getting the thin-crust, which is not what they're known for. As I am not a fan of other pizzas, I thought this would be my best bet. For the three of us, the pizzas took 45 minutes. As soon as my pizza arrived, I was disappointed. It was not thin-crust at all. The outer edge where you hold it was really very cushiony, and the rest was just normal thickness. I knew I wouldn't find NY-style but Pequod's definition of thin-crust is way off. But that wasn't really what bothered me. The flavor was just not there. There was nothing about the crust that tasted good (my friends who got pan pizzas said their crust was amazing, so I was envious!). It was really just like plain white bread. The cheese literally sat on the pizza in one sad, rubbery clump, not integrated with any of the vegetables I had selected (they tasted fine but were completely unseasoned). I could only stomach two slices as I was hungry before I just felt like I was eating cheap white bread with plasticy/fake white cheese. Honestly, I've had way better pizzas at Giordanos if you want to talk hyped-up places. Even Blaze Pizza, a franchise, turned out better. Not to mention Dimo's in Wrigleyville which has fantastic pizza. And, crust aside, they win when it comes solely to flavor. My friends were happy with their pan pizzas, though. But if you only like NY-style pizza as I do, don't go even if your friends are raving about it. Let them experience it without you unless you're willing to go for the pan pizza (like I said, I can't speak to it, but I hear it's good and my friends who tried mine agreed it was pretty lame).

Unfortunately, they don't do a good job of communicating this prior to getting there.  My party as well as three others (including a bachelor party that was forced to find other food) experienced this.    We received a text message the morning of the ""reservation"" asking us to confirm the time and amount of people, but nowhere in that message did it convey the variable nature of the time. Normally, not a problem, but if you have a larger party on a tighter schedule (ie bachelor party, or family with small kids), then waiting until 9:30 for an 8:00 PM ""reservation"" is less than ideal.     Would suggest management improve the pre-reservation communication, both on the website as well as the text messages. In terms of the food, overall quality was decent.   For apps, we ordered the pizza bread, assorted appetizer platter, and pequod salad.  Filled you up, but nothing to write home about in terms of taste. We ordered a thin crust cheese for the kids.   As a native New Yorker, I found the crust a little soggy, and the cheese a little excessive.  Sauce was excellent though.  Kids liked it, so that's all that matters. We also ordered a pan pizza with spinach/garlic as well as green pepper/onion.  It had a nice caramelized crust (highly addictive).  The dough was thick with a generous layer of sauce.  The veggies needed some extra salt, but overall taste was pretty good.  One medium slice was enough to fill me up, and I have a fairly big appetite.

2015-12-28,1.0,"Pequod's is a Chicago staple, no doubt, however, nothing is worth the terrible experience we had the last time we dined (or didn't dine) there.  Our family timed our trip to Pequod's extremely conservatively arriving at 5:00 knowing we had a 7:10 movie to see. We had already taken advantage of their priority seating service. Upon arriving we were told we could sit immediately, and as we proceeded to the table --- oh no. Just kidding.--- they decided to give our table to another family who needed a high chair, so then we continued to wait. We got seated at 5:10 and ordered two thin crust pizzas immediately due to the 60 minute wait time on pizzas they advertised at the front desk. We put in beverage orders and waited quite a while for them to come to the table, but seeing as how crowded the restaurant was, that didn't bother us.  60 minutes in to our wait time- waitress is no where to be found, table next to us had decided to leave because they had been waiting longer than they deemed appropriate for their food.  70 minutes into our wait time- still no food. Waitress arrives and alerted us it would take 10 more minutes.  We start our stop watch  80 minutes into our wait time- ""just a little longer guys."" Stressed our waitress.  At 6:55 pm our waitress comes by with to-go boxes, knowing we had a movie to catch, and said we still needed to wait on the pizza. At that point, we paid for our drinks, and in a last minute attempt to eat dinner opted for potbellys sandwiches next door.  We know this wasn't the waitress' fault. She already lost two tables that night and I felt for her.  Dear Pequod's,  Chicago is known for their pizza. I can think of several places that we could have gone and had a delicious pizza. If you want to stay competitive, I would suggest another way of functioning, because making people wait 1:45 minutes for a pizza is absurd.

Technically a pan pizza I'm told, Pequod's is just dumped with everything the way I want it. It looks a tad like a dive bar walking in, which probably has to do with the time of its founding. By the way, I kind of also like that there's only one location - it gives it more of an authentic, non-chained feel. Even if the service was, well, a little bit distant. Can't win in everything, and in this situation I didn't particularly care, probably due to the dive bar feel. The best part? The pizza, obvi! The lunch special is somewhere around the $5-6 dollar mark (sorry, I forget), including a soft drink, which I didn't very much care for but gratefully accepted, a lemonade.

Guess what we didn't even finish our pizza which always happens because one we don't eat a gang load and it was a total waste.  I think personally when you tell a waitress that you aren't really hungry and want to just try something a personal would be fine. Especially since the crust is so thick and huge.

After waiting about fifteen minutes our pizza made its way to our table.  I was surprised with the short wait after because we had dined at Lou Malnati's the prior day.  Our server there  told us the pizza would take 45 minutes to cook.  I thought he was joking at first, but he was not kidding.  The pizza was downright delicious.  It was hands down the best deep dish I have ever had in my life.  There was nothing negative that could be said about the pizza.  It was not overly saucy, and they did not cheap out on the toppings.  I loved that the bottom of the pizza was crispy, and not soggy.  I had to use a knife and cut the bottom because it was just that crisp.  The crust was the best part.  It was still so hot, despite eating the crust last.  The cheese was heavenly, for lack of a better word.     I love that this place opens until 2am.  The service was good, and the pizza was amazing.  I would recommend, and will definitely be back.",0.9976,0.758,0.222,0.02,0.5283994708994709

The pizza was decent but did not blow my mind. They tell you how long it will take to cook appetizers and the pizza which is excellent and much appreciated. Good french fries. Great prices on pizza! The crust was nice and fluffy! Even when I ate it cold the next day after I had it in my purse for 5 hours (don't judge me), it tasted great. Cons: There are kind of a lot.  They told us 30 minutes to get seated (long), BUT the time was accurate and they actually sat us in 30 minutes. We ordered drinks and they came out quickly, but the drinks were pricey. I paid $5.95 for a pint, and those were the prices for almost all of their beers. We ordered half an order of fries and bruschetta. The fries were really tasty but I wish I had a bottle of ketchup rather than packets. The bruschetta was not good. It was bland and the bread had this weird orange color to it. I ordered a pan sized personal pizza and the size was perfect for me and I had half the pizza leftover. I ordered pepperoni with basil. My pizza was burned AND I really hate it when the basil is cooked with the pizza. Fresh basil should not be cooked in my opinion. The delicious taste of it goes away.

Not those little sausage balls at Pizza Hut. I don't order extra cheese at any other pizza spot but here i think it's necessary. Just don't think it's enough cheese on their pan pizzas. Pizzas come out great every time. The only downside is that once you wait an hour for your pizza by the time it gets there is still too hot to eat so you end up waiting longer to eat it.  Fml.

I had been waiting for that moment for 24 years, no joke. When I picked up the spatula to serve myself a ""slice"" the cheese was oh so gooey and perfectly stringy. I felt like I was in a commercial. Finally, the moment of truth arrives. I took a bite of the picture perfect pizza, annnnnnnd I was incredibly underwhelmed. It had absolutely no flavor. The cheese lacked salt, the sauce lacked tang (not robust at all), and the crust was crunchy but there was no flavor to the dough. UGH! I was so incredibly disappointed.

If you are coming on Friday or Saturday night, you will have to wait up to an hour to get in. This may seem like a long time, but there is a reason people wait. You can call ahead and have priority seating, which can shorten your wait.  2. My personal opinion, the more ingredients you place on the pizza the soggier it will get. Less in this case is more.  3. If there are any major Chicago sporting events, it will be packed.  4. Parking is rough at times.

We went next door for a drinks.

2015-10-01,3.0,"Nice little spot to drop by after a drink filled night in Wicker Park. Stopped by to grub on some deep dish when we found out they close at 2 AM. I was pleasantly surprised that it resembled more of a dive bar than a pizzeria. Being on vacation in Chicago and being that it was my last night, I had to have me some Deep Dish Deliciousness. Unknown to me, they served pizza by the slices, which was to come out a lot faster if you didn't want to wait for a deep dish. Did my inebriated self want to wait an hour for a deep dish? Sadly, my impatience got the better of me. I went with a simple slice of pepperoni, sausage, and mushroom pizza while my girlfriend wanted a white pesto pizza. The server told us my order wouldn't be a problem to make for a slice but we'll have to order a a full pizza for my gf's order. Not a problem...if my slice didn't take as long as her mini white pesto deep dish to come out. What was probably 35 minutes, my slice finally came out.  Perfect size for my hungry drunk ass and loaded with toppings. It was better than I expected. My only gripe? The sauge, or shall we call them meat balls, were a little too big and over powering, making the pepperoni and mushroom irrelevant. Luckily, them balls were packed with flavor. Just wish they were smaller in size so I can taste the other toppings. Not before I was 1/4 through my pizza, my gf's pizza came out. If I knew my slice would take almost as long as my gf's order I would've just went with a classic deep dish.  We rarely got checked on and had to wave down the servers a couple times to get water refills. Besides that, the servers were very friendly. If we ever stop by Chicago again, I'd definitely like to try what people are saying is the best deep dish in Chicago.",0.9833,0.819,0.127,0.054,0.5371924603174602

In this case, it was probably one of the worse service I have encountered at a restaurant... ever. We (7 of us) arrived at the restaurant on time for 6pm reservation. We were promptly seated 15 minutes later. We knew this was a very popular restaurant during dinner time so we expected reasonable wait (45min~) for our pizza to be ready. Knowing this, we ordered some wings, meatball sandwich (no cheese), large pizza pie and pitcher of beer. Beer and wings arrived shortly. Wings and beer were fine until my friend discovered a fly in his beer halfway thru his drink. We didn't make a big deal out of it thinking it's an innocent mistake. We told our waitress about it and she brought my friend a new glass of beer. So far so good... kinda. 1.5 hours later, we are still waiting. Still no pizza, no meatball sandwich, no explanation by our waitress for the delay. We asked our waitress how much longer, and she says 5 more minutes. 25 minutes later, nothing (almost 2 hours of wait so far). We asked our waitress again, and she says 5 more minutes. Pizza finally arrives and we remind our waitress we are still waiting for meatball sandwich without cheese (one of our friend can't eat dairy). She said sandwich should be coming soon. We finish our pizza 20 minutes later and still no meatball sandwich. We ask our waitress about it, she said 5 more minutes (it's been almost 2.5 hours for meatball sandwich so far). 15 minutes more pass and finally meatball sandwich arrives but WITH cheese (it's been 2 hours and 45 minutes for a wrong sandwich). At this point we are fairly irritated because we waited 2 hours for a pizza and 2.75 hours for a meatball sandwich that my friend can't eat. At this point we decide to complain to the manager, Shawn. We explained our situation and he acted like ""oh well"". At no point did he apologize (for either wait or wrong order) or offer to fix the situation. He kept on saying ""wish there was something we can do"" without real resolution suggested. At this point, most restaurants with good customer service would have offered something for the terrible experience but nope, not Shawn. He just waited for us to leave. We did get a small discount for the meal (which wasn't what we were after) in the end but we left feeling petty and like shit.

I've always thought that food reviews are kind of a waste, since food is so subjective. Kinda like choosing a favorite color. If you like green, who am I to argue??? I really wanted to like Peaquod's pizza, but it wasn't in the cards. I placed a phone order for delivery, and almost 2 hours later, I get a phone call from the driver. He had the wrong address. Luckily it was only one digit off, so he was across the street. I brought the pizza (thin crust pepperoni) inside and opened the box. The pizza was barely warm, but the amount of pepperoni was very generous (the only reason I didn't rate a single star). Since it was in the drivers car so long, the crust was soggy. Maybe they're better (crispy crust?) if you order and eat in the restaurant....  After several bites, my disappointment began to ferment. It was extremely bland, totally lacking flavor. (No, my taste buds weren't on vacation). I'm used to pizzas with some seasoning, this was just crust, cheese, sauce and crust. No flavoring at all. I'm still going to to try their deep dish, the caramelized cheese looks enticing. But the combination of a long wait time and no payoff has me deeply disappointed.   I'll update after my next pizza, hopefully it will redeem Peaquod's. If not, Chicago is full of quality pizza joints, my money will be spent elsewhere.   Peace....",0.8767,0.798,0.122,0.08,0.5062397372742201

2015-09-18,1.0,"Oh my Quod, buckle up for what may be the most ridiculous food experience I'll ever have. 7p - Called in a delivery order for a small deep dish and bruschetta. Told it'll take about 90 minutes. 8:45p - Called back to inquire and sat on hold for five minutes. Never a good sign. They say the pizza will be out the door in ten minutes and we're promised some kind of discount on the check (card was already charged). Aka the order was lost and they just put it in. We didn't expect it to actually be out the door in ten minutes, but nonetheless proceeded with that thought. 9:30p - Call #3. My apartment is about 3 miles/15 minute drive from Pequod's, so it should have been here about 9:10 if their previous timeline is to be believed. Turns out the driver had the wrong number and couldn't get ahold of us so they drove back. Gave them the number once again and waited, wondering if death was nigh. 10p - If the driver was headed right back out with our order, they should have been here by now. We get the same answer as before, which we're quick to shoot down since 10 minutes ago was 20 minutes ago. The entire charge has been voided, thankfully. 10:45p - Call #5 (!!!!!!!) At this point we kind of just want to go to bed, but know we need to eat. We're finally given the manager again. This is only the second time we've spoken to him, the first being a brief apology during call #2. He apologizes profusely but you can tell he's basically at a loss for words at this point (can't blame him). No idea what happened to our order but he's going to put another pizza in. He also takes down our information and we can get a free order in the future (don't think that'll get used). 11:30p - The driver finally arrives. For those keeping score at home, it took 4.5 hours to get our order. Of course, this happened when I had less than zero food in the house so we had to commit to waiting this out. Here's the worst part after all of this - it wasn't good at all. The pizza was predictably terrible since it probably went through the oven at a billion degrees to get it out. It's probably decent in normal form, but not better than the other deep dish places. Disappointing given all the rave reviews I've heard. Never, EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEVER (shout out to Chris Jericho) order the bruschetta. It was actually kind of hilarious. Uncooked bread slices that had been oiled and a salsa cup of what was basically pico de gallo. Chopped tomato and onion with no seasoning. Sad panda.

Even when they are on top of their game, expect to devote about half of your night waiting for it.  Their service started to decline about 3-4 years ago. When I talk about Pequods with people now, a certain waitress always pops up. We call her ""waitress no response"". Here's one of my experiences with her (of many): Pizza arrives not correct, not the right toppings and hard as a brick from overcooking. She comes back to check on us and I explain how the pizza is inedible. She looks blankly at us, does a 180, and walks away. We had to track down the manager ourselves, who says the server is just too busy to deal with it (seriously!). Doesn't offer any sympathy, let alone comping, and gets annoyed when we ask for a new pizza. This was about 2 years ago and the quality of service has not improved. I gave them a chance (have still gone probably once a month on average since), but I have to move on. I have way more positive things to say about this place and their sporadically good pizza. Unfortunately, none of them are from he last 3-4 years. That brings me to quality of food. It used to be that we knew exactly what we would get when we ordered and it would be delicious. Lately, we've been lucky if it's edible. I had the manager tell me that being able to pick apart individual strands of non melted cheese was their style... When I told them I've been eating there for years and the pizza was obviously not cooked enough, I got an eye roll. I didn't even ask for a new pizza, just to finish cooking it! I'd much rather eat a decent enough deep dish, that doesn't take forever with terrible service, somewhere else. Open more chains or something, hire better staff and managers! I love you Pequods!

And of course the best part, as every reviewer complains about, was that I waited 1.5 hours for this dog food. I will absolutely never order from here again. Lou Malnatis is the best and pequods is not even near the same level as their deep dish.  Save yourself the headache and order from Lous",0.8027,0.827,0.105,0.069,0.480718954248366

2015-09-10,2.0,I've heard a lot of hype about this place and finally got around to checking it out since I was in the area. Can't say I was pleased. I ordered a medium deep dish with jalapeños and onions and easy cheese. First thing I notice was the bread/dough was really really dry. It was fluffy but had lost literally all of its moisture. Plus they kinda started to burn the bottom. As I pushed through the second slice I noticed the sauce wasn't that sweet and was heavy in some spice/seasoning that that began to make it overwhelming and I barely finished. I started to feel sick because of this and all of the water I had to drink to counter the dry bread. Best thing I could say was the jalapeños were spicy. Service was okay but since we didn't order much we rarely saw the waitress. But it was also busy so that could be why. Can't say I'll recommend this place. Lou Malnati's in my opinion still has the best deep dish pizza in the city. Hell the frozen Roundry's pizza I got from Mariano's was better. But that's just my two cents and I'm sure others will totally disagree with me. I just can't say I'd understand their point of view.,-0.3669,0.797,0.096,0.107,0.5701173222912355

That said, there are MAANY issues in this establishment which will make me and many of the other customers who gave up and left that night never come back.  First off, the management of the way this place is run is absolutely horrible. People were waiting 2 to 2 and a half hours and being told it would be an hour and a half. Then, people who called in got bumped ahead of everyone else who had ALREADY been waiting for a ridiculous amount of time. Everyone was upset, there was a small uprising, and it made for a very stressful environment. Managers, get your staff and yourselves organized because that was a mess. Second, the place is completely understaffed. There was one hostess for hordes of people trying to ask questions and get their names down. Waitress were given so many tables and people to attend to that they had just enough time to drop your plate and run to the next table, so we could barely get in questions about getting more drinks or more food. The staff were extremely stressed and overwhelmed. The stressful and frustrating experience is not worth it. The pizza is good, but not good enough for that to be ok.

Don't get me wrong, there's sauce and cheese but not as much as the other places, so know that going into it.  Now the sauce was great.  Right up there with Malnati's.  At Giordano's the sauce has this kind of burnt/baked on feel to it which is still good.  The sauce here was very tomatoey like Malnati's and tasted fresh.  Now for the sausage.  It tasted great and I just wanted more.  Maybe it's because it was a personal sized pizza.

We ordered two medium sized deep dished pizza. There were five of us and each of us ate around two slices and still had leftovers! One pizza has mushrooms, garlic and sausage. The other pizza was a simple pepperoni and cheese, but we asked for anchovies on the side as well. The pizzas itself was amazing! The dough they use is lighter than i expected, almost like focaccia but not as soft. They carmelize the crust which gives a great crunch at the end.

It's so hard to explain the crust that people are talking about on here, the cheese on the outside is amazing, it doesn't taste burnt at all, it's just crispy goodness.  Each of the pizzas is cooked in its own cast-iron skillet. The sauce is perfect. It's a great complement to the crust and the toppings, unlike some other places in Chicago, it doesn't overrule the entire pie. Really, I think if I lived in Chicago, I would have to get a job at this place as the person that eats the crust that anybody leaves behind when they're finished. I guess I'll have to pay them too. I doubt they'll pay me. But really, it's that good!!!!!",0.9852,0.814,0.134,0.052,0.566081349206349

The sauce was very runny with little cheese on the pizza. The browned crusty edges that I look forward to eating on crusts fell off the slices as if they were burnt greasy edges.

2015-08-14,4.0,"Now that I've tried most of this city's popular pizza joints, I feel like I can put each one into their own category. By far Giordano's is still my favorite because they have a fierce gooey cheese game going on in their pies. Lou's tends to be more saucy, while here we found it to be overly bready. On our first visit we tried the thin crust which we enjoyed, so we were very excited to get their famous deep dish with an all cheese crust, which is phenomenal by the way. Who knew burnt cheese could taste so good?  The pizza seemed to be a good inch of bread high with a layer of sauce and toppings as opposed to more of a deep dish where the bottom layer of dough is thinner and the toppings deeper and more plentiful.  It still tastes great sure, but everyone has a preference. My husband likes Lou's the best which is why we were hoping to have this be our new favorite and could that way compromise and eat here when we were in town.  I like that it has the feel of a local sports bar and the service was stellar. Our waitress comped one of my husband's beers for taking a long time to come out when we hadn't even noticed or brought it up which I thought was completely awesome and unnecessary.

2015-08-14,3.0,"I WANT to give this place 4 stars. I went again after my first being just that.. A-Ok. The food was amazing! Amazing. The experience fell short because of the same problem: service.  There was a bug issue (which has now been resolved) making the experience very unpleasant and the server, after our complaint, did not seem to care and did nothing nor did she alert management. Long story short after I personally sought out management, they squared things out. Maybe this was a rough night? I thought. I guess not.  I go again, and this time (after truly giving this place the benefit of the doubt) bring my entire family flying in from LA. We order, but realize we ordered it wrong so within 2 minutes, we get a hold of the server (There is a 60-minute wait, we figured it wasn't too late to adjust it) She says she will adjust it, does so and returns, and repeats back the order. It is perfect. Unfortunately the pizza that came out was all wrong. 2 large pizzas for a party of 8 with the wrong toppings (neither the old or new order..but a combination of the two). At this point, it's clear there was a mistake and feel partly responsible for changing the order but feel it is still necessary to relay the issue. We eat (we're not waiting another 60 minutes for a re-fire). But know, we alert her immediately.  The server says she will check what she inputed into the computer and seems to remember the order being different, she says ""Oh I do remember that..."" She says.  Here is the problem. She NEVER returned, apologized, or even spoke about it ever again. We see her again when we're almost finished and we ask for the check. She drops it --what? Really? I ask for a manager and explain what happened. She says she didn't know the whole story and agreed that the server should have followed up.  Mistakes happen. That's fine, but own up to the mix up instead of abandoning a table and expecting a 20% tip. (We tipped 15% on the original amount after having a discount..so she ended up getting at least 20% on the updated bill --we're not evil). Oh not to mention, after having everything squared away by the manager, she has another server pick up our bill and answer our gift card questions. So SHE was mad?  MAYBE I happened to get two off-nights for these 2 girls, 2 times in a row. But I doubt it. I will probably eat here again because the food is good, and I'm a sucker, but will be doing take-out, or sitting at the bar. Both times management adjusted my bill, which is great but I (like most) do not to out to eat to look for a discount. I seek great service with great food.  Why be good when you can be the best? Here is my old review: **** I am updating this because on my way out I asked to speak to a manager and Katie helped us out. She assured us that the problem would be fixed by an exterminator the following day. This lets me know that the management staff truly does care about the customer experience! I recommend this place!

I was a little shocked but said it was fine since neither of us were starving. We arrived to pick it up at exactly the 1 hour 15mins mark and were treated by hoards of people crowding the entrance and spilling out onto the street. Once inside, it made sense. It was a Saturday night and this place is a little on the smaller side, so lots of people were waiting to be seated. I over heard the hostess saying it was a 1.5-2hour wait for a table, wow. We ended up waiting in a slow-moving line to pick up our pizza. It was a little annoying how long it took to simply pick up a carry out pizza. And, we were lucky out order was actually ready when we got there. Some people had to wait even longer after paying for their order to be ready. Also, this place isn't super expensive, which I like. I'm pretty sure a medium pan pizza is only $16. The only outrageous thing is that each extra topping adds like $2.50, which adds up quickly. We paid $23 for a medium pepperoni and sausage pizza. Once we finally got the pizza, it was good! I really really love the crust on this pizza. It's the best pan pizza crust I've ever had--nice and dark, but not burnt, and super crispy. I also loved the quality of the ingredients: nice, huge chunks of tasty Italian sausage and literally the entire pizza was covered in pepperoni which was awesome. The sauce was also good. My only complaint is that I felt the pizza was super skimpy on cheese at some points I was like, does this pizza even have cheese on it!? But seriously, this pizza is damn good. Overall, I'd avoid this place on the weekend unless you're willing to wait 1-2+hours for your meal!

The cheesy, burnt, delicious crust that may not look appealing to the eyes will certainly appeal to your tastebuds. While not a traditional Chicago deep dish or stuffed pizza (it's a pan pizza) the the thick, crumbly crust and massive amounts of cheese will leave you just as satisfied. A medium pizza easily serves 3-4 people, at around $20, is a great value in addition to being absolutely delicious! Aside from the crust, the rest of the pizza is exactly what you would expect.  It has a good crust:sauce:cheese ratio and offers all your normal toppings. Personally, I recommend pepperoni and jalepeno. I order Pequods every time a new person comes to visit, and no one has ever been disappointed.

Hyped up and ready to go, the line outside of the restaurant seemed like a good sign. ""Okay, cool, tons of people here, good atmosphere, this is a local favorite."" My group was told that it was a 40-45 minute wait. Once that time had passed, my friends and I noted that people who arrived after us were getting seated before us. Okay, fine, maybe they had reservations. We went in to check when our seated time was, and were told that we could actually order our pizza ahead of time, so that it would be ready much sooner after we were seated. We ordered a medium pan pizza (the caramelized crust was so hyped up!) with bell peppers and onions and went back outside to wait our turn. Over an hour had passed, so we went in; only after double-checking and seeing names after ours crossed out, we were immediately allowed in and seated. We were seated in one of their rooms upstairs, where there was an abundance of empty booths and tables - confusing as to why our wait time was so long. After notifying the server that we had already put our pizza order ahead, and ordering the appetizer combo (a great choice; really nice, hot breaded appetizers served with ranch and marinara - I'd say my favorites were the mushroom and zucchini), we began chatting, eagerly awaiting the main course. She came back out shortly afterwards and notified that she couldn't locate our order, and asked again what the name on it was. She double-checked in the kitchen, pulled out a receipt with our name to show us, and it turned out that while the pizza order was correct, several additional items had been added to the order. After further investigation, our pizza was discovered to have been sent to the wrong table.  Long story short, we eventually got all of our food.

From the caramelized crust, to the ooey gooey cheesiness, to the little morsels of pineapple paired with canadian bacon - did ya forget I'm a Hawaiian pizza freak? - I've never been disappointed and I will always pick Pequod's as my fave when anyone inquires.  In 4+ year love affair with  Pequod's, I'd never been to this location, but on my last trip to Chicago this was the most convenient, so off we went. We called in and ordered for takeout about 45 minutes before we'd be able to get there and upon our arrival there were dozens of people outside waiting just to get inside to order their pizza. From waiting in line to pay to being handed the yummiest pizza possible, we waited about 10 minutes, if that.

We had the small pan pizza with onion, pepper, mushroom, basil, pineapple and some other greens. It wasn't bad looking but the taste...he finished his slice and I couldn't even stuff another bite. I think I ate a total of 2.5 bites of my slice and doggie bagged the rest for my mommie. Mom didn't like it either.  We also ordered the appetizer combo that came with mozzarella sticks, zucchini slices, jalapeño poppers, and breaded mushrooms. I was super excited for the mozzarella sticks because I can't remember how old I was when I had it; probably in high school. I can't say it fulfilled my craving for mozzarella sticks but it was definitely one of the better appetizers. Everything else was being ingested out of hunger.

We said that was fine and she can take the table if it is needed. She said NO I NEED TO TAKE IT NOW and moved it away from us. We then moved to a booth and noticed no one even sat in that room with the high tops the whole 2.5 hours we were there.

My co-workers and I opted for a carry out for a lunchtime treat and, as expected, the pie was hot and gorgeous upon opening of the somewhat weighted box.  My chosen wedge was placed upon a non-coated paper plate which was supplied as a request for plates and plastic utensils, seeing that we were in the workplace we obviously were in need of supplicatory devices to enjoy our meal. ( these plates were like a cruel joke )  My first taste of Pequods pan was indeed delicious. No doubt about that. The pepperoni was a cured spicy beautifully thin sliced enjoyment, but my thoughts on the sausage were less rated. It tasted more of a pork breakfast sausage then a pizza ingredient.  The cheese rimmed crust, Pequods signature style,  was okay. It tasted of a well seasoned cast iron vessel which in turn thrust me into the history of the brand. I personally did not care for that taste of history. Pan style has never been my forte, too much bread and definitely not enough cheese and very little sauce.  So all in all, I cannot rank my satisfaction high, although hunger satisfying, I would not indulge again. I am truly just a deep dish and ultimate thin crust girl.

2015-06-28,4.0,"For pizza amateurs and enthusiasts alike, I implore you to make the trip to Pequod's.  It's Chicago's best known secret located in the northwest suburbs.  Their breed of pizza is still of the deep dish variety, but different in way's that make this establishment my second/third favorite pizza in Chicago. (First being Lou Malnati's) For $21.40, I ordered a medium sized pizza (6 Slices), with pepperoni and sausage.  Out of the 7 pizza parlors I visited, this place takes the longest to make, but your patience will be well rewarded. What makes Pequod's special: 1)  The first thing everyone notices about a Pequod's pizza is the crust. It appears to be overly burnt, but it's actually a thin layer of cheese that was baked onto the crust. While the resulting flavor is decent and slightly charred, the texture is phenomenol--the caramelized cheese gives the back of the pie a delightful chewiness that doesn't exist in any pizza 2) Pequod's has the BEST toppings I ever had in my life.  The sausage is in meatball form but is so tender it almost crumbles before you bite into it.  As for the taste, it's dynamic.  Full of flavor and bursting with seasonings that'll leave you dazed.  Same can be said about their pepperoni.  There's also an added crispness to them that makes me believe they broil their meat before serving. As for the sauce, it's sweeter than most, but less chunky.  I felt it interplayed well with the salty, thick toppings.  The cheese is basic mozzarella and has sufficient ooey-gooey goodness for any cheese lover.  I actually feel the pizza tastes better as a whole once the cheese congeals to the toppings as there is a lot of ""cheese-sliding"" when it comes out hot.  In measurements of depth, it's a thick pizza with about a 1.3 inches deep. ---- Conclusion: Pequod's continues to receive local and national honors of being the best pizza. Although I can see the reason for the accolades, I still feel Lou Malnati's wins by a hair.  Reason being, Lou's characterizes, to me, what deep dish is about: A layering of delicious flavors that is so deep and so stuffed, it resembles lasagna.  Pequod's is made in the format of a traditional pizza, with unique differences in quality and crust.  Overall, it's a definite must-try during your trip and something all food/pizza lovers should indulge in.  Extra Notes: -Accepts credit card -$4.95 Yelp Check-in Lunch special of a Cheese personal pizza -Adam Richman (Man VS Food) favorite pizza joint in America -Atmosphere leans more on the chill side and decor seems aged, but less touristy.  - Wait times are long and it does get crowded -Servers are very friendly and suggestive -Significantly further from downtown, but take the OTA off madison&clinton and exit at Clybourn. Walk north for about 10 minutes until you get to Webster and turn right. An Uber will cost about $18 -Restrooms are clean",0.9985,0.812,0.181,0.006,0.4605714285714285

We get her attention after a few more minutes and informed her we wanted beverages too(usually servers ask).  No hey sorry about that, nothing.  I realize that place was busy, but she gave me the impression that we were inconveniencing her.  At this point I say to my girlfriend, ""if the service is normally this terrible, the food must be exceptionally good.""  I lose again.  Their famous deep dish I had heard so much about left so much to be desired.  I can only conclude most of their patrons are not native Chicagoans.  It even took way too long to get the check.  She just averted her eyes from us.  I don't get it.  Worse part of all is I spent 50 bucks a meal that was not only mediocre, but we were treated almost like we weren't welcome their.  I paid and left quietly.  I feel like the owner of this place stole from me.  I curious to know what qualifies one to get decent service here,  as it appearing others were recieving.  Its a win win, I never have to eat there again, and they get to keep my money anyway.  Screw one customer, it won't hurt business.",0.9625,0.828,0.114,0.058,0.5111788617886178

This was better than sitting downstairs at a high top table.  Even though it was busy, it wasn't crowded yet, but it still took a while for the server to come greet us and again more time for her to take our orders, get the check, etc. We started with an order of the Caesar Salad (I forgot if it was the half or full order) then split a small 10"" deep dish with sausage.  The crust was caramelized and crispy and held the sauce, cheese, and toppings well.  I was only able to eat one quarter while Hubby ate two and we took the remaining slice to go.  Pretty good for deep dish.  I would be interested to return and try their thin crust or even the lunch special 7"" personal pan cheese pizza and a soda for $4.95.",0.9734,0.878,0.115,0.007,0.5381175595238096

That's when a friendly local told me to give it one more try at Pequod's. I love to eat so I accepted the challenge. We took the train out to the nearest stop, but the nearest stop was about a 30 minute walk to the restaurant. It was sort of a good thing because we worked up a big appetite by the time we arrived. The restaurant has a cool neighborhood-y dive vibe, which I liked. It felt more like a college bar than a pizzeria.  Seating is very limited and about 20 minutes after we were seated, a huge line of people formed at the hostess stand (they began quoting wait times of 1 to 2 hours)! It takes a while to bake a fresh pizza so don't come here if you are in a hurry.  I probably should've taken away 2 stars for their awful instant iced tea. Skip it. So gross. I always lose major respect for restaurants that care too little to fresh brew their own iced tea. It's not that difficult to do! At least the beer list has Lagunitas, a must-have with pizza.  I made the mistake of letting my husband order the pizza and opted for a medium with extra pepperoni. Let me tell you, Pequod's understands the concept of ""extra."" This pie was loaded with spicy pepperoni and it was good, but I had to pick off pepperoni to give him because there was so much. I really liked this pizza (didn't love it, but it's good). The crust is very light and fluffy and tastes like beer. It reminded me of a classic pan pizza crust, but the carmelization was amazing! I could eat that part all day long.

But, that's just my own personal preference.  Expect  to wait at least 45 minutes when ordering a deep-dish pizza (it just takes awhile to bake) but expect to fill your stomach with one epic slice! (maybe two if you're really hungry!) The crush is absolutely amazing. At first glance it looks burnt, but, oh so good! This place is popular so if you time it right you may be seated right away, otherwise you are probably looking at a 1-2 hour wait, especially on a weekend. The ambiance is a darker and slightly loud setting with dark wood tables and a ""bar like"" feel to it. Overall a casual, young, trendy and fun for all ages restaurant.

2015-06-01,1.0,"Just ate here for our first time after hearing  a lot of hype about the place... NOT IMPRESSED!! We ordered mozzarella sticks and a large pan pizza, simple enough, or so we thought. After 30 minutes, we asked the server where our sticks were. She clearly had forgotten all about them as she rushed away and had the cooks drop them. 40 minutes after the order was taken, we finally had 7 crappy little sticks of undercooked cheese. Our pizza took an hour and a half, while other patrons who were seated a half hour after us were done and leaving by time ours came up. The server we had clearly didn't know what the hell she was doing, even though she claimed she had been serving there for 14 years, yikes! She couldn't remember simple drink orders! My brother was waiting for his beer for 15 minutes before we had to remind her about it. She said ""oh you ordered another beer through me?"". We said, ""yes, duuuh!"" Thats when she explained to us she had been serving for 14 years and yada yada yada. She even told me that I wasn't smiling enough, WTF. I'm a paying customer, I don't have to smile especially if the service sucks. She got so flustered that she refused to serve us and we WERE NOT being mean and nasty, just unhappy. Super unprofessional on her part. On my way out we spoke with a manager briefly. The waitress then walked by and I muttered ""14 years of sucking ass"". I admit that was rude and immature, but then she fired right back with ""GO SUCK A DICK!"". WOW! At that point I just walked out and said that will be the one and only time I ever spend money there. I can't believe she said that, and in front of other customers. And finally, the pizza was mediocre at best which gives them their measly 1 star. Definitely nowhere near Lou Malnati's and Gioradano's quality. It makes sense they only have 1 location with all the rift raft that works there. Luckily, for that terrible waitress my brother is a better/nicer man than I and left her a 5 spot. If I had it my way it woulda definitely been a big fat STIFF!!

Unfortunately this is not really close to downtown so you have to uber it there. It says that it closes at midnight but I think it was open and there was a sign that said til 1-1:30am. So we had a 11pm dinner and it takes about 30-45 minutes to make it. You get to make your own so we got two deep dish: One large with sausage and pepperoni and the other with mushroom and spinach split along 6 people. I thought it was pretty good and quite filling. Now I am not a deep dish type of girl because I want to taste all the ingredients instead of a pile of tomato sauce. Two larges was a lot for a group of six since the crust is so damn thick and filling so maybe a large and medium for a group like ours.

No chain ingredients, no revolving door managers moving from one restaurant to another. Legit. We have become such big fans that we had our Wedding Weekend Friday night welcome dinner here, to give our family and friends the best taste of Chicago pizza there is.  So let me explain it to you ... real ... slow.  A) Load it up. We get sausage, pepperoni, giardiniera, AND jalepenos. So a medium costs nearly $30. With six slices, you can consider two slices a FILLING $10 dinner, one slice a good solid $5 lunch, and the pizza is now a bargain. And they give MAD amounts of toppings. B) It will take longer than they say or longer than you think. Wait. It's worth it. If they say 40 minutes, expect 50. No biggie. Watch the Blackhawks, let your mouth water and your belly rumble. C) No, they didn't burn it. They put cheese on the outside of the crust to give it a salty, caramelized, crunchy texture that no one else can match. Embrace it. You'll never want a deep dish without it. D) Heat up your leftovers right! Here's how you do it: 1) Get the pizza out of the fridge for @20 minutes before putting it in the oven to take the chill off. 2) Get your oven up to 450 degrees, with your cast iron pan inside. Just before taking out the pan to put the pizza in, feel free to spread a small amount of oil or bacon fat on it. 3) Place one or two pieces in the pan so that the edges are against the pan's edges, to re-crisp the outside. 4) Plop it back in the oven, turn down the temp to 325, and heat it up for 5-8 minutes. 5) Repeat with more slices as you wish.

Our reservation was lost (I think our main guy was late and they gave it away), but we eventually were sat upstairs. It took a while for our pitchers of beer to come to the table, but the place was packed so it was understandable. We know the drill with Pequod's that it takes a while to cook the deep dish pizzas, so we placed an order of apps along with the pizza. The combo appetizer plates were delicious and just what we needed to hold us over. Again the server took his sweet time checking on drinks and filling our waters, but we didn't come here for the service. We did, however, decide ordering out was the best way to go when it comes to Pequod's. Pizza was standard delicious and we were on our way!

2015-04-28,3.0,"Yes, this is very good Chicago-style deep dish, especially the caramelized crust.  It's also really cheap (dinner for two, plus leftovers, for $20).  But to nitpick: The crust is too thick on the bottom, so each slice was breadier than I wanted it to be. The hostesses are surly. The wait is a killer.  We came sometime before 8 on a Thursday evening, and waited almost an hour for a table, then another hour-plus for the pizza once we had a table.  I mean, it's pretty painful when, having ordered 45 minutes ago, the waitress comes by to update you that it will be another 23 minutes.   Overall, I think I rate the pizza lower than Lou Malnati's, maybe higher than Giordano's, but the leftovers were not as good as Giordano's leftovers, and I can't imagine ever waiting that long again just for this pizza.",0.6293,0.886,0.072,0.043,0.6202083333333334

The caramelized crust was good and there was a generous amount of toppings. You get full quickly after one piece, but we had to finish it all as we were flying back home that evening.

Sausage and pepperoni in particular were spectacular.  Pepperoni wasn't usual over salted super spicy but on mild smokey side- loved it and I'm not a pepperoni fan usually.

Reserving the space was easy, just did it online and also got an email from Sean. I had a ton of questions and he replied quickly.  We decided to order off the menu. We ordered baked mostaccioli with marinara sauce, pitches of soda and 12 pizzas. Ordered both the thin and the pan. All different kinds of toppings. Food came out when we requested it, service was great. Janet was the main server and she was so nice and attentive. Everyone loved the food and it was a good time. For the amount of food we ordered and the number of guests, the cost wasn't bad at all and food really did taste great. Thin was crispy, pan was nice and cheesy and had a nice caramelized crust! It's nice that the room doesn't have an amount of time you can have it for. We set up at 11am, party started at 1230. Food was out like I requested at 1pm and the party was over around 3:30 and we got our stuff together and left by 4. The room has 2 tvs so the guys were able to watch games.

2015-03-22,3.0,"Pizza at Pequod's was definitely worth the try.  Recommended by a coworker as the best deep dish in Chicago I had to give this one a go. Ordered the deep dish with sausage and the thin dish with my typical, veggie, four seasons-delight style (mushroom, onions, green peppers, and olives). The deep dish was definitely unique and a great crunch to it, which is something that you don't get normally with deep dishes. I felt that the pizza tasted very fresh and the ingredients were easily distinguishable with every bite.  The thin dish was not as delicious and resembled more of pan pizza that I normally would get down at the south side.  The overall atmosphere resembles more of a typical pizza joint and the staff were on-and-off friendly. I guess that the overall restaurant feel had me at dismay for a portion of my dining experience. My favorite deep-dish of all time is Uno's, and I felt that Pequod's did not meet my expectations. The feel, the case-iron pan, the pizza taste added to the okay it's-pizza experience. Maybe the place was overly-hyped and I had high expectations coming in. My tastes do differ than others, so others may think that this place is a 5-star.  Overall, Pequod's offer a unique deep dish that is only found at this place. Another plus is the amount of customization that they offer for your pizza.  I would definitely recommend this place to other local Chicagoans in the future, but also note that reservations should be taken, since the place fills up quick (two floors). And lastly, if you are feeling extra EMO, I will probably recommend take-out.",0.9548,0.88,0.106,0.014,0.4849707602339182

2015-03-15,5.0,"My favorite deep dish place in Chicago!!! I love that they are open until 2:00 AM, which means I can satisfy my late night cravings. You can do RESERVATIONS (priority seating) online! Convenient, and if for whatever reason the time or day is already reserved, the manager will e-mail you telling you a different time or day he can do.  We had a group of 14 on a Saturday and they were jam packed! We were seated on the second floor because of our bigger group. They gave us 5 high raise circle tables because they didn't have the shorter rectangle ones. That was the only weird part because some people had to deal with ""indents"" where they were sitting. Like you can just imagine connecting 5 small circle tables in a row and how some people would get stuck in the part where two tables meet.  BUT I DIDN'T CARE, because the most important part was seeing my friends. I'm just letting you know in case you plan on bringing a big group on a busy day.  [They do allow you to split 14 credit cards, it's a hassle but we didn't have cash] I also can't comment on the service, but because they were busy, you can't expect the constant service. They seemed to have plenty of workers, but still couldn't keep up with the crowd demands, The waiters were flying all over the place and I struggled to find my waiter maybe 2-3 times and kept going to other waiters. But none of them were rude about helping me even though we weren't their table.  A funny thing I noticed is that they waiters have a habit of dropping plates (used) or glasses on the ground!

These guys crank out 'zas in volume, which means sometimes they make a mistake or two.  Unfortunately, this happened last time i was there - waited 1.5 hrs to get in, then 40 mins for pizza, only to have the wrong order come out.  She was great and put in an individual pizza for free to make up for it, but was kind of a bummer. PRO TIP: if you're waiting for a table for a while, head next door to the Drinkingbird.  Great little place to get a beer or a craft cocktail while you're waiting, and the buzzer Pequod's gives you will still work at that range. now let's get to the good stuff:  the pizza is truly phenomenal. I used to be a dead-to-rights Giordano's guy, having grown up south of Chicago.  This is different - not stuffed pizza like Giordano's, not really ""deep dish"" like Gino's east - more of a true ""pan pizza"" a la Lou Malnatis.

2015-03-08,1.0,"This one star is for the service and lack of response I got when I shared my experience. The pizza is amazing so it makes me sad to share this. I wrote the below email to the Pequod's general email listed on their website. I have received NO RESPONSE, so I am posting to yelp. I am more disappointed in their lack of acknowledgement than the original bad experience. I probably won't ever go there again. Their pizza is good, but there is a lot of other good pizza in this city.  Hi There, After my experience yesterday, 1/18, I feel compelled to write and let management know about the poor service that my party received. First of all, I want to be clear that the food was great, and neither myself or anyone else in my party of 4 had ever experienced poor service at Pequod's prior to this, even in circumstances where the restaurant was MUCH busier.  This is why I am writing to you, the company, directly instead of posting on Yelp.  I don't feel like my experience accurately reflects your restaurant as a whole, and that this was one unfortunate instance. We arrived around 3pm on Sunday, 1/18.  We were a party of 4, and two of us arrived about 10 minutes later than our friends.  We found our friends and discovered they were seated at a table at the very back of the restaurant that stuck out in the path of the staff's way to the kitchen.  This table should not exist.  The people on one side are uncomfortably close to the table of the booth behind them, and the people on the other side are in the path of the staff's way to the kitchen, and get run into, or accidentally bumped over and over again as people are rushing by.  Perhaps this table should be removed. We sat down, and our friends who had been there before us had drinks from the bar, but had not been attended to by a server, or offered water.  After several minutes, we had to flag down a server and ask to be served drinks.  My husband received his draft beer which he said tasted funny, as if the lines of the keg hadn't been cleaned recently.  He decided to drink it anyway, and did not complain. We ordered, and proceeded to wait at least 45 minutes for our pizza.  We didn't mind so much as we expected the pizza to take awhile, had good company, and were watching the football game.  What we did mind was that our server never took initiative to ask if we wanted more drinks, even though beer glasses stood empty for at least 15-20 minutes.  We then heard the table next to us ask about their pizza, as they had been waiting over ONE HOUR for their pizza.   We then noticed a booth open up and asked our server if we could switch to the booth in order to get out of this cramped and uncomfortable table. She said yes and kindly helped move us to the booth.   After we moved, my husband had to ask after about 10 minutes for the beer he had ordered at the other table. Our server said ""Oh yea!"" and went to fetch the beer.   After that we had no contact with our server for another hour. Someone else brought out our pizza. After that, no one stopped by our table to ask how it was, if we needed anything, to ask if we wanted anything else to drink, to clear our dirty plates, or anything in general.  We never ordered more drinks because no one stopped by to ask if we needed any.  The interesting thing is that there were plenty of people working there!  Kitchen staff, pizza runners, table bussers, bartenders.  There were at least 10 different people whizzing by us constantly but it was like we were invisible.  Myself and my friend both made eye contact with our server a couple of times hoping she would come over, but she never did.   At last we had to flag down our server to ask if we could pay. She looked surprised, then laughed and explained she thought we'd paid already, and that she'd forgotten that we'd moved tables, and that the ordering/billing system said our table was paid.  She said  we could've walked out of there and she would have never known we didn't pay! After she explained this, her lack of attention made a little bit of sense, but still didn't account for the fact she hadn't even asked us if we needed anything.  If a table sits there for an hour after you think they've paid, wouldn't it make sense to ask them if they had decided to order anything else? It was also odd to us for her not to remember moving a table in the middle of her shift. To make matters worse, she did not apologize, or even REALIZE that she had been ignoring us for an hour.  She just laughed, dropped off our check, and said have a nice day.   This was pathetic service, and therefore we left a pathetic tip. I looked for her name on the bill, but it wasn't listed.  She was a short woman with very short dark hair.   The purpose of this email is just to let management know what terrible service we were provided, especially in light of our normal good experiences we have a Pequod's, in hopes that you will address it appropriately.

2015-03-04,2.0,"This is a review of my takeout experience. I was stopping through Chicago on my way home to NC. I decided to pick up a deep dish pizza as a birthday present to myself and went to Pequod's on a friend's recommendation. I had two hours which was just enough because traffic was terrible! I was very excited about the caramelized crust because in my experience, caramelized = delicious.  I picked up my pizza which was finished on time. So far, so good. 3 hours later, I get to the airport and finally have some time to try a slice. The crust looks thickly blackened. I try it. It doesn't taste very good, it's extremely dry and very hard to chew through (I have great teeth). I call the restaurant to see if something went wrong. I ask to speak with the manager and cordially explain the whole situation. He was nice about it, maybe with a hint of condescension, and told me that it was supposed to be like that. I express skepticism, because I like all food (I am Chinese and we really do eat everything) and if there are rave reviews about the crust then something is probably not right.  I ask if it could have something to do with the fact that I'm eating it hours later and he counters no way. He refused to concede at all and maintained as long as the bottom isn't burnt, then it means the crust couldn't be anything but perfect. Being that I was with my pizza and he wasn't, I'm not sure how he could guarantee that. He said, and I quote, ""Nothing went wrong in the kitchens today."" I'm not sure what that means in terms of my pizza. There were no kitchen fires?  Anyway, I quickly became annoyed with his attitude as he seemed 100% unable to admit to the possibility that the pizza was not as it should have been. It's not like I would have been able to ask for a refund at that point...I just wanted some semblance of sympathy or offering of remorse! I did receive some unexpected consolation: a pastor waiting for the flight in the aisle across from me completely sympathized with me and gave me a nice pamphlet about Jesus. In his words, ""I thought there was something wrong with your crust the moment you opened it up."" I'm attaching a picture of my crust. The thickness of the black part averages about 4 millimeters.  Two stars because my pizza was still warm after a couple hours! They wrap it in tinfoil for extra insulation and the box has extra latches so it couldn't open by itself accidentally. Very useful for a traveler. At home, I microwaved a slice that seemed like its crust actually had the right amount of blackness, maybe 1mm (unlike the majority of the pizza) and it was not bad at all.

Very Hard! Like... incredibly, super duper hard!   2. You'll get to know your friend really really well.  The seats are kind of tight too, so hang your winter coats at the hallway coat hangers.  It'll save up the space for the very cozy booth seat for 4. Get the sausage pizza cause that's the best!  Their sausage is seasoned differently.  It's a little sweet, with a touch of anise.  And the crust of this pizza is the best!  The cheese is caramelized within the crust!  Unlike any other Chicago Pizza, the crust is thinner and chewier.  It's not too fluffy and not over dough-y.  The balance between crust, cheese, and filling is perfect!",0.9928,0.761,0.223,0.016,0.5808673469387757

After a few bites into the pizza obviously the sauce was rich in flavor with the toppings adding tons of flavor making a great combination. They had the perfect sauce to topping ratio and man.... The CRUST be out of control. Yes the caramelized crust is really that good and worth the mention in itself. I was unable to finish the entire pizza but had to kill the crust of it all the way through. The sausage had a nice spice to it however my one item is that I like a bit more cheese to my pies... personal preference though. All this said leads to a solid deep dish pie but personally I still am partial to Lou's ""sheet of sausage"" and the way they pull their pies together. Still a solid joint and definitely worth a visit and my second favorite pizza joint in Chi Town.",0.9958,0.763,0.216,0.021,0.5000868055555556

2015-02-03,4.0,"Unique spin on deep dish. As others have said, it's true the crust is thicker than some other interpretations, but it is fresh, soft and very chewy. I can understand why some feel cheated that they're paying so much for what is essentially focaccia bread, but it has great texture. I think you get plenty of food for the money, so I don't get complaints about price; a large slice (essentially one serving) probably comes in at between three and four dollars and is definitely a meal's worth. Two slices and you'll be stuffed for the rest of the day. Three slices and you'd better be ready to commit to a food coma. On the plus side, they pile the cheese and sauce all the way to the edge and there's barely any sort of crust handle, so that thick bottom is offset by the fact that there isn't much crust at the outside edge of the slice. The trademark ""caramelized"" crust is really more of a char, giving it a nice smoky flavor like something that came off the grille, a pretty distinctive signature that sets them apart and adds a nice finishing touch to the slice. The sauce tends toward sweet as opposed to savory, however their toppings leave just a bit to be desired. I'm a sucker for Italian sausage, but their sausage seems pretty tame to me. Honestly reminded me more of Italian meatballs and despite the fact it has fennel in it, it doesn't seem to have that distinctive punch I'm used to in authentic Italian sausage. I think it needs a little more zip. You can't go wrong here and I would never turn down Pequod's, but the overall flavor profile just seems a bit simple in contrast to some others I've had. That isn't a dealbreaker, but if you're looking for a more complex mingling of flavors in your tomato pie, there are certainly other options around town. If they amped up the flavors in their sauce and toppings just slightly to give it a little more pizzazz, I'd probably give them a solid five stars.",0.9958,0.793,0.181,0.027,0.44547784391534395
2015-02-03,3.0,"Meh. I'm not sure why people like Pequod's that much. I have friends who rave about it, but it's just not what I'm looking for in a Chicago deep-dish pizza.  Pequod's has that sports bar feel that is great for grabbing a pitcher of beer and hanging out with friends. But if you're just going to eat pizza, the wait is ridiculously long and for pizza that's pretty bland if you compare with other Chicago favorites (regardless of how touristy or franchise they may be). When we first sat down, we were told a 30 min wait, which is totally reasonable. By the time we ordered, the wait got bumped up to 50 min, and this was around 2pm. They should really invest in more ovens or something, because even as a business, having people just sit for 50 min waiting for food means less turn around with your customers. Anyways, as we were waiting, we figured we might as well order some appetizers. We got a mixed platter with jalapeno poppers and fried mushrooms etc. They were over-fried.  The pizza itself, when it finally came, was ¾ crust and barely any sauce or cheese or toppings. When I eat Chicago deep-dish, I expect to get a decent crust topped with a thick layer of sauce and cheese. They also put the topping on top of the cheese, which threw me off a bit. It was good if it was supposed to be cheesy bread or something, but it was lackluster as a deep dish pizza. The atmosphere might be a bit more laid back and a customer base of more college students or Chicagoans, but I'd still take Lou Malnati's or Giordano's.   I will give them this though, they have a pretty good lunch deal if you're not looking to share.",0.9866,0.853,0.121,0.025,0.5367063492063491

2015-01-28,4.0,"The décor is bordering on the ""no frills"" side of nothing too fancy. That said cut a place some slack it's a pizza joint. We were a bit disappointed at the lack of seating or waiting room for an advertised wait of nearly 30 minutes, but we lucked out and quickly got to sit at our table upstairs after navigating the scary dark stairs leading to a somewhat cozy dining room brimming with people. We ordered a beer and a frighteningly overpriced glass of red wine and set about looking at appetizers. We finally settled on the ""Pequod's Salad"" and some hot wings. For our pizza, we opted to go with beef, onions, and pepperoni. Our salad was about what you expect from a salad at a pizza place, they had a few pieces of shaved provolone, some chunks of cured meat, onions, and some crisp if not tasteless iceberg lettuce, the wings were devoured in no seconds flat and tasted like pretty much all hot wings, decently spicy, hot, tangy, slightly crispy...in other words, I liked em. Our Pizza was slow in getting there but once there was piping hot and pretty good. Having few points of comparison, I would say that the mozzarella cheese was pretty good if maybe not layered on as thick as I would have liked. The sauce was not very spicy, a little bit sweet but had some good herbal flavor to it. The crust was crispy throughout and the dough was buttery and satisfying. Speaking of the crust, the main issue many people have with Pequod's is the outer edge of the crust. In the baking process, the cooks stuff the edges of the pan with cheese to create a slightly burnt ring of cheese on the crust. This happens to also be what many people, your writer included, really loved the most about this pizza. Fortunately for us, my better half was not a huge fan of it and so I got to eat her pizza crust...:) match made in heaven.:) The service was not overly enthusiastic to get us out despite still having a nearly hour long wait to eat. Our server was polite, prompt, and appropriately cheerful for slinging pizzas.   In conclusion, the décor was nothing to boast about, seating was tight, and price point a bit too high for what we got (seriously 10 bucks for a glass of house wine?), but the service was good and the Pizza was pretty good and that counts for a lot. The Pizza really could have used spicier sauce and a bit more cheese but that burnt cheese crust was something everyone should try at least once if they live here or are nearby enough to make a stop. Not that I have had a lot of Deep Dish but so far this one slightly edges out the others (sorry Uno's your dough was still raw), and that earns it the best grade to date.   Overall: B",0.996,0.799,0.148,0.053,0.5837464678178963

They said ""no no, this ain't Uno's or Gino's East, this one packs a punch."" They mentioned the hour-long line of locals. Then they mentioned the caramelized cheese crust ring.  Caramelized cheese crust ring? Pequod's delivered that punch. Pequod's delivered that hour-long line. It delivered rich sauce and flavorful crust with enough crunch at the bottom.

I always start off my pizza meals with a salad to get some healthy veggies in.  But when at Pequod's I douse my salad in their ranch dressing because it has a little extra something in it that makes it awesome.  I think it may be extra garlicky or something, and it is great!  Their house salad also comes with cheese on top that shaped like a fish, which is always endearing.  All deep dish places have something they do a little differently.  Here at Pequod's they're known for their caramelized crust, which really sets them apart from the rest of the crowd.  You can't go wrong with any pizza you would choose.  It is some seriously tasty pizza! My last visit in was over the holiday season during lunch time, and there was a bit of wait.  They have a nice little lunch combo for $4.95 that comes with a 7-inch cheese personal pizza and a fountain drink.  Regular toppings are $.80 extra, and you can also add a small lunch salad for a couple extra bucks.  We went this route, and I enjoyed the pizza, but I am firm believer that the personal pizzas at deep dish places are never as good as the full sized pizzas.  Please tell me I'm not alone in thinking this.  I swear it's the cooking time or something.

My dad and I signed up for a 5 mile race down town and had to pick up our packet at Running Away Multisport that is a few doors down. Being from the suburbs we were unfamiliar with the area and decided to walk down the street to find something to eat for dinner. As we walked past Pequod's the smell of their great pizza literally stopped us in our tracks. The Pizza smelled so good we did not look any farther and went in. When we walked in the place was very busy and we were greeted by the hostess who informed us that we would have a fairly long wait ahead of us. It was a Friday night so we expected a wait. She said if we would like we could wait at the bar area. The bartender took our orders and told us that if we like we could look at a menu and place our order ahead of time or wait till we go to our table. We opted to wait till we got to our table and they had no problem with that.  For being as busy as they seemed I expect to be rushed but this was not the case. Restaurants make money through a high turn over but our waitress didn't mind letting us take our time to enjoy the experience.

What's the deal with this?   We decided to go elsewhere with our guests. Yes, to a more commercial place. We still were told there would be a 45min wait. But, we were also offered to put our order in early so when out table was ready, our pizza would be ready faster & we were politely told about the bar next door, in case we wanted to get drinks and hang out more comfortably while waiting.

2014-11-29,1.0,"This review is tough to write because, from a taste standpoint, Pequod's HAD been a pizza that I'd enjoyed twice in past experiences after trying it for the first time a year or so ago. After my most recent experience, however, I will not be returning as a customer - unless there happens to be a change in management. On a Saturday evening (4:45pm), I phoned in an order of two pizzas (one thin crust and one deep dish) for our family. I was informed my wait would be approximately 50-60 minutes. I showed up at the restaurant at 5:40pm after 55 minutes and was informed that my pizzas still needed about 10-15 minutes. On a busy Saturday night, I thought this was reasonable and appreciated them letting me know (vs. just saying it would be ""a couple more minutes""). After 20 additional minutes had passed, I asked about the status of my order and was told the takeout server would be back shortly. When she returned, I was told that they just put one of my pizzas IN the oven - 80 minutes after I placed the order. After waiting another 10 minutes, the manager came out with both pizzas. Upon expressing my frustration for their clear delay in placing part of the order, and the fact that the first pizza of mine had been sitting there for 20+ minutes, he offered me $15 off a future order, and said my delay was ""typical"" for them. Given the experience to that point, I should have checked the pizzas on the spot, but upon returning home and opening the box, the pan pizza that had been sitting for 30+ minutes (by that time) had completely collapsed in the box, leaving a smeared mess of toppings and sauce and a thoroughly soggy box. The thin crust pizza that had been forgotten was burned considerably on the crust (past the normal ""carmelization"" of Pequod's crusts).  I really was looking for a simple mea culpa from the manager. Everyone makes mistakes; but he continually expressed that my experience (even the pizza waiting on top of the oven for 20+ minutes) was typical for them and offered no recourse on my current order. If this is the ""typical"" Pequod's experience, count me out.

2014-11-27,4.0,"When a friend of mine mentioned Pequod's as her favorite deep dish in Chicago, my curiosity was definitely piqued. I'm here all night, folks. Eating at Pequod's is a great experience.  The place is just an unassuming bar with a good amount of TVs to just hang out and wait for a delicious pizza to be brought to your table, served right in the pan, no less. Not gonna lie, I miss early 90's Pizza Hut so bad. The service is attentive; two of us at the table were having coffee for lunch (it was a long night) and they kept the pot filled for basically just the two of us.   So onto the pizza.  We got a sausage/mushroom/spinach pizza and a meatball/peppers pizza.  You got big hunky pieces of topping with a yummy sauce and a nice crisp crust to go with it.  Our two pies varied pretty greatly in crust thickness, but either way, both were great.   The biggest negative, however, is that they fall into the trap of soggy veges.  If you have too many veges in your pie, it's just leaving a ton of moisture on there leaving everything a slippery mess and even worse when reheating it.  There are definitely a couple different things they could do to avoid this, like chopping them into smaller pieces, ensuring that they're on the top to let moisture escape, using a salad spinner after chopping, etc. We had some leftovers and because of said sogginess a lot of that cheese just oozed off, which is unfortunate.  Also, the crust got pretty saturated too, so even with a pizza stone, the dough was still pretty soggy. So yeah, for now I would say avoid having too many veges on your pie and avoid taking it home.  It's just not a very good experience. However, despite all of that, I might like this better than the big three...",0.9787,0.734,0.174,0.092,0.599183904330963

Once the pizza actually came out, it appeared to have a burnt crust.  We called over the waitress, who explained to us that it was the specialty of the house-- to put a layer of cheese along the outside of the crust, which burnt and caramelizes as it bakes.  Apparently some people would revolt if they stopped this practice!  For my friend and I, it was just a tad TOO burnt, so maybe we got one that didn't pass quality control... but I would say I wasn't a huge fan though the rest of the pizza was delicious.  For this reason L.M. was my favorite pizza place, though I can totally understand a late-night post-bar hankering for Pequod's-- in fact, in my early-to-mid 20s,  I could have seen myself being a fixture here!",0.9441,0.89,0.077,0.033,0.4763409961685824

We ordered one medium and one large pan pizza because we had the hangers and ended up taking most of the large pizza home (not surprisingly).

The biggest plus about Pequods is the generous amount of sauce they put on the pie. Chunky tomatoes with garlic and a hint of oregano, their sauce adds a lot of flavor to the pizza.

This creates a stupid good carmalized crust on the pizza.  The flavors are incredible.  We added italian sausage and it was the best sausage I've ever had on a pizza.  Quality sausage.  The place is packed, especially on weekend evenings, but if you have the time to wait, it is well worth it.  They also have a fantastically cheap lunch special for $4.95.  Includes a 7"" deep dish with one topping plus a beer or soda.  Can't beat that with a stick.",0.9733,0.799,0.171,0.029,0.49472455648926233

While some local deep dish places tend to go lighter on the sauce, Pequod's layers it on (but not excessively). Their sauce is full of seasonings and rich tomato flavor. As important is the crispy burnt cheese crust. Deep dish pizza tends to get a bit soggy, so the cheese crisped around the edges adds a nice crunch. And who doesn't love nearly-burnt cheese on their pizza? The individual (7"") size is enough to satisfy two moderate appetites, but if you're hungry, you can probably polish off one solo.

I know, I know - I'm a Chicago traitor.  I usually find deep dish to be too clunky and heavy, when I get pizza I want to eat four or five slices at least, and you just can't do that when you're eating deep dish.. unless you have the appetite and stomach capacity of a sumo wrestler. We split a medium deep dish pizza topped with sausage, giardiniera, and onions.  While it does take a bit of time to bake (they need time to make that great crispy crust) - the wait is well worth it.  I've never had such a flavorful and well cooked deep dish crust.  The balance of sauce, toppings, and cheese was also on point.  Will definitely be coming back when I'm having substantial pizza cravings.

Completely unanimous opinion that Pequod's should simply be tossed. When I think of deep dish, I envision the typical doughy crust with cheese and toppings then covered in sauce. When our pizza came out, it looked like we didn't even have sauce on it, the little bit we found was just, okay. I went with my favorite combo, peppers, onions, sausage and mushroom, enough toppings to make it interesting but not to overload the pizza. Ours was completely covered, which was fine, but it was somewhat flavorless and simply too much. I will give props to the outer crust, it was delicious the way they caramelized the outside. It was flaky and light which I enjoyed. That being said, the center was completely soggy and falling apart. For take out, this was a bad choice but it might be better at the shop. Overall, there are much better places in the city for deep dish, I'd include Lou's over this one. Due's still stands strong as the best in my mind.

This review is mainly about the service received.  We sat down, party of 5, and requested waters right away - it was a long long day. Server comes back, no waters, takes our drink order (including mentioning waters again). Returns with beers, no waters. We ask one more time for water and she hears us as if we had never asked before.  5 waters are then brought to the table and the final one was dumped, ice bucket challenge style on my friends sitting on the end. They were shocked out of their mind.  I never heard her, but others said she said sorry at that time, but it was so much commotion that it didn't come across. She brought over napkins and then that was it. My poor soaking friends took it in great stride. We know accidents happen, we just wish there had been some sort of apology. Some remorse over the fact that they had to sit in the super A.C.'d upper level with a huge puddle at their feet and freeze as we waited for our pizza.  Pizza arrived, delivered by someone one else and she lost control of the scalding pan and it slid on the table right towards my friend who received the brunt of the water. Thankfully the server caught it before it could burn the crap out of my friend, but seriously, the only torture we expect pizza waiting is from our grumbly stomachs, NOT the waitstaff.  Again, TOTALLY get accidents happen. We have all been servers before, I just would have handled that situation so differently. I would have apologized more than once, I would have come back to see if we were comfortable, I would have offered to move us so we didn't have a puddle at our feet, and I would have talked to my manager to see if there was any sort of compensation that could be provided. That's basic customer service. We were all kind of appalled to see that not even the ice tea was comped. Perhaps it's entitlement, but I can't remember the last time I was at a restaurant and a mistake went unacknowledged like that.  Now here was the hardest part. As check was delivered, and again, no apologies were ever made outside of the drop we had to contemplate tip. Some would say none, the service was terrible. Some would say the regular 20%, accidents happen. I kept going back and forth, again being a server... what if this was the worst day of your life and this happened to you.  But again, if it was me that would inspire me to take great care of a table and show them how sorry I was.

2014-09-02,2.0,"This place has a fiercely loyal following that consider it the second-coming of ""Chicago-Style"" pizza. That said, having grown up in Chicago, I can remember the glory days of the great deep-dish restaurants: Uno's, Duo's, Gino's East, and Lou Malanati. In the 1970s, these were temples to the deep-dish style pizza that Chicago has unfortunately become known for. Today, Pequods has become the underground go-to place of a new generation. I ate there last week on the recommendation of someone I trust to know about good food and who has a deep appreciation for this place. Three adults and a 4 year old went to a late lunch on a weekday. The service was a bit slow and awkward. I am not sure if the server was new, inexperienced, snobby, or just lazy nor do I care. First ding to service. We ordered two deep fried appetizers: mushrooms and zucchini. We also order two bowls of soup as appetizers: minestrone type soup and a potato soup. The deep fried zucchini were straight from freezer burn to deep fryer burn and were simply awful. The mushrooms by comparison were also frozen but at least properly cooked. The potato soup was boring and odd. The other soup was actually good. The terrible tasting deep fried zucchini took an extraordinary amount of time to burn and bring to the table. Second ding to appetizers. The table had become quite cluttered with dishes, silverware, paper, etc. and the server simply ignored it and also refilling our drinks. Second ding to the server. We then had the lunch special of a small deep dish pizza with a drink for around $5.95. The pizza was more than enough food to satisfy even a large appetite, despite its relatively small size; it was very dense. Two pizzas came with pepperoni, one with mushrooms, and one with plain cheese. The pepperoni (meat itself) was good quality. The ring of the crust was burnt in a caramelized manner. Interesting and strange. The pizza was good in an addictive way. Each bite demanded another. Not being a deep-dish fan (Chicago has always been a thin crust town except for the tourists and suburbanites), I was surprised I ate it all. The pizza was about half as deep as a classic Chicago-Style and the ingredients were fresh.  , The bill was wrong and needed to be corrected which required actually getting up and finding the server. If there was a manager present, it wasn't apparent. To round off the experience, I was in the men's room with one of the waiters (they all wear the same shirt) who left the room without washing his hands. I swear this is true as shocking as it is. This place is not for me. Apparently, not for my wife either, who had indigestion for a day and a half.",0.9288,0.825,0.098,0.077,0.483009213009213

A small deep dish was more than enough for two people and it was quite affordable as well (I believe it was somewhere in the neighborhood of $12). The best part were the burnt ends of the crust, and as someone who doesn't always end up eating the crust, this was a nice surprise at the end of the tomato saucy rainbow.

2014-08-28,3.0,"Came here on a Thursday night and it was pretty packed. Bf and I had been wanting to try this place out because we saw it on a list of all-time must-try pizzas and I read some great things about the famous caramelized cheese crust. They initially told us the wait for a table of two would be about 30 minutes, but our pager went off almost immediately after walking outside. No wait on a busy night was fine by me! We were led upstairs and seated before our waitress took our drink orders. Bf got his beer promptly but 10 minutes passed and I had still not received my water. Not being able to ignore my thirst, I had to flag down our waitress and ask the whereabouts of my water, to which she finally brought it out.  Knowing that deep-dish pizzas typically take a while to make, we ordered the onion rings to start off with. They came out pleasantly quick and were really delicious. They were big, flavorful, and perfectly crunchy; like an extremely upgraded version of bk onion rings. My bf couldn't stop smiling at his satisfaction and said they were probably the best onion rings he's had. Our pizza, however, took excruciatingly long to come out. I expected to wait, but we must have waited probably an hour AFTER we finished the onion rings. What bothered me even more was seeing some tables that arrived and ordered after us get their pizzas before us.  We ordered a medium pan pizza with mushroom, spinach, and pineapple and it looked and smelled amazing when it finally arrived at our table. While the pizza was flavorful and the cheese was wonderfully gooey, I was kinda disappointed at how doughy the pizza was. The thick dough in each bite made it seem as if it wasn't even a deep-dish. The caramelized cheese crust was good, but Pequod's didn't live up to the hype overall. So far I've tried three deep-dish pizza places in Chicago and Lou Malnati's is probably my favorite, followed by Pequod's, and then Giordano's.",0.9898,0.803,0.143,0.054,0.6186296296296295

Our first time there our pizza didn't taste very good, crust was cracked, and the waitress was rude. We figured that maybe it was just a busy night because every restaurant was swamped because of the Hawks game at the time so we tried a second time a week later. The food came out even worst the second time and looked almost inedible. When asked to replace or remake the food we received attitude/disgust from the waitress (not the same one) about it, and she even had the audacity to complain when we didn't leave a tip. Not sure if its because we ordered thin crust at a deep dish pizza place, but the now fiance and I both agreed we'd never go back to Pequods if given a choice again. Edit! Found the original review from last summer! My girl friend and I went here twice. The first time our food was drastically under cooked so we figured we give it a second time before making a final judgement on the establishment. The second time was worst. Our food had little to no sauce, disintegrated as we attempted to pick it up, and our waitress acted as if the work she was doing beneath her. Pequod's overall is your typical garbage college pizza bar with overpriced food, questionable quality of food, and horrendous service.

The sauce is somewhat plain, but allows for the toppings to really come through.

The pizza tasted like any other ol' deep dish pizza until you get to the crispy, burnt crust, which was indeed delicious, but not really a deal maker in my opinion. I did really like that they heaped on the toppings (pepperoni, mushrooms, and olives) and thought that the cheese/sauce ratio was perfect. My table also ordered the appetizer sampler, which was yummy because we were starving, but nothing special (besides the jalapeno poppers which were gross and filled with Cheez Wiz type cheese).  Like other Yelpers have said, the service here is definitely lacking. My friend pre-ordered the pizza at 7 PM and said we'd be coming in at 7:45 PM and the waiter rudely asked my friend to call back at 7:15 PM to place the order since the pies take 30 min. My friend then just suggested that they just write down our order and put it in at 7:15, which thankfully they agreed to. This kind of left a bad taste in our mouths, especially since the pizza wasn't ready until about 8:15 anyways. Overall, I think Pequods is a place that everyone who likes deep dish should try, but don't expect it to be out of this world if you've eaten a lot of deep dish because it's not much different from other good pizza joints (e.g., Lou Malnati's, Ginos East).",0.9907,0.732,0.195,0.072,0.4732851473922902

So basically it's a pile of yummy mush in your mouth. That's not necessarily bad, but also not amazing.  Pequod's is the perfect deep dish pizza. The ingredients are fresh. As in, the italian sausage is the best I've ever had and even the bell peppers still have a slight crunch. The crust isn't drenched in butter or grease and it has a light crunch. There's even a rim of burnt cheese around the top. (Don't make a face. Everyone loves burnt cheese.) Every person I have introduced to Pequod's has fallen in love. If you haven't already, go tonight.  Also, the pizza is made to order so you should expect to wait 30 minutes for the pizza after you've placed your order.

2014-08-08,3.0,"I am a little hesitant to write this review simply because I've heard so many good things about Pequod's (perhaps more recommendations than any other pizza place in Chicago) and also, I think I may have had some bad luck. But my experience with Pequod's last weekend can only be summarized as mediocre.  A friend and I went for a late lunch on a Sunday. I've heard crazy things about wait-times at this place, and we were seated instantly. (From what I've heard, waits typically only get bad around the dinner hour). Our service was just OK. The staff seemed a bit distant at first, but were increasingly friendly and more responsive as the meal went on, which was nice to see.  We started with an order of cheesy garlic bread which honestly was unimpressive for all I've heard about this place. It was good, but it wasn't anything I couldn't heat up in the microwave with some bread, butter, garlic, and cheese. And just two fairly small pieces for around $5.  The pizza itself is what really left me underwhelmed. There was nothing about this pizza's key elements that tasted any differently from any other tourist deep-dish place in Chicago. Quite frankly, the flavor and consistency of the crust is IDENTICAL to Gino's East. What's worse, the crust seemed even thicker, and there wasn't much cheese on my pizza. The thick/deep crust is something I don't mind if it's balanced out with the right amount of cheese and sauce, but this pizza didn't have that. We ordered pepperoni, and there was plenty of that. I had asked for half sausage, but for some reason I was brought a pizza with 1/4 sausage. When I asked the waitress about this, she did make sure I wasn't charged for 1/2 sausage, but then said that they don't do 1/4 or 1/2 toppings anyway (at least I think that's what she said). I was a little confused, but I was only charged for the one topping so that wasn't that big of a deal.  Perhaps I had a bad pie. I want to try my luck again and see if it is better. The carmelized cheese I noticed - but I was waiting for it to make this big impact on my tastebuds and it just didn't happen for me. Bottom line, the pepperoni was average, the sauce was average, there wasn't enough cheese, and there was way too much crust in proportion to the rest of the ingredients. I was really disappointed; for all I had heard about Pequod's I expected more. As far as deep dish goes, I think there's a lot more to Chicago pizza than deep dish and it's not something I want more than a few times a year. But again, I didn't find Pequod's to be any better than some of the more-known tourist places like Gino's East, Giordano's, Lou Malnati's, or Edwardo's.

2014-08-07,4.0,"Visiting Chicago with my daughter, I decided we needed to try some authentic deep dish Chicago Pizza. Pequod's seemed like the best place, only a 15 minute cab ride from where we were, and a lot of Great reviews on Yelp.   We arrived about 6:15 on Tuesday 8-5-2014. Its a Bar/restaurant. We walked in and were taken upstairs immediatly. They only had two soups, so we both ordered the Mushroom soup. For pizza we ordered deep dish with extra cheese, mushrooms and pepperoni. The mushroom soup came very quickly. It was good, nothing to rave about. I've had better, but I've had a lot worse. The pizza took a little while to arrive, but our waitress warned us. If you are getting fresh, deep dish pizza, you should expect it to take a while. It arrived and it was good. Now I am a Big Fan of Deep dish pizza, so I have tried a lot. Pequod's pizza is very good, but again, nothing memorable. The crust was overly cooked, a bit too burned and crispy for my daughter and I. We have a pizzeria in the Detroit area called Pizza Papalis, that is my all time favorite. It takes almost an hour to get your pizza and its made with several kinds of cheese's and has a crust that you will swear, comes out of a bakery.Pizza Papalis is what I judge all other deep dish pizza by. Pure heaven!  I have to say Peguod's got an extra star from me for their incredible service. Three people ""tag teamed"" our table. Rushing over food, picking up and dropping off plates and refilling outr water glasses. Their service was exceptional. Got us in and out in a hurry, but we didn't feel rushed in the least. I would say Pequod's is worth a visit, if you want good pizza and Great service!",0.9896,0.833,0.142,0.025,0.5454687500000001

2014-08-06,4.0,"Pizza preferences are usually based on where you're from, so let me start this by saying that I'm from Cincinnati. I like thick-ish pan pizzas with slightly tangy sauce and a chewy, stringy mozzerella topping. I like to eat pizza with my hands, and I like to eat more than one slice (lookin' at you, deep dish). Overall I like a balance of the sauce and cheese that, in my opinion, neither NY style nor Chicago style have a lock on (NY: too much cheese, Chicago: too much sauce).  So Pequod's: great or the greatest?? Lemmie break it down for you:  Sauce: Killer-diller. Not too sweet and not too tart. Cheese: Mozzerella--chewy and delicious. Weirded out initially by the cheese on the crust, but it gives the pizza a nice crunch at the end.  Crust: Oh god so good--this is the mother-of-all pan pizza crusts. Thick, but solid and not incredibly doughy like Chicago deep dish. Crunchy and crusty at the bottom so that you can actually eat a slice with your hands without it bending down.  Sauce-to-cheese ratio: Almost perfect! A little heavy on the sauce, but way closer to my ideal ratio than any other pizza joint in the area.  Toppings: This is the only thing that threw me. The garlic topped pizza was fantastic, but the sausage on the sausage-topped pizza was too chewy for me--almost seemed over-cooked.  Verdict: Sausage-less Pequod's is my true-heart's desire. I can't speak for the in-restaurant service, since I got it delivered.  Pequod's pizza all day, every day, now and forever, amen.",0.9925,0.827,0.173,0.0,0.5164609053497943

I've yet to venture outside my usual pepperoni-topped pizza, which comes with a few of the pieces charred to a delicious black.  They also cook the pizza long enough to crisp (""burn"") some of the cheese on the edges of the crust.  I find it a delicious, salty, chewy addition to the texture of the pizza.",0.9428,0.875,0.125,0.0,0.5755952380952382

Under the recommendation from my brother from another mother, he told us that this place is one of the best pizza places! He was right! It is walking distance to DePaul University (he went there) and about 3 miles from our hotel. We decided to cab it to this pizzeria and walk back to burn off those calories! The restaurant/bar looks small on the outside, but when you get in, it is actually bigger. It is two stories and there is plenty of seating upstairs. We arrived pretty early (round 12) to beat the crowds and there was no wait for us to be seated. This is the ""official"" Blackhawks bar. My friend says ""EVERY bar"" is the official Blackhawks bar. Anyway, we got the lunch special (individual pizza and soda) for about $6.00. It was a good deal! Apparently, they used to serve the special with beer, but that stopped due to the new laws. Anyway, we shared a salad which tasted very fresh and helped ease my hunger pains while waiting for the deep dish. Deep dish pizza takes awhile, but it is worth the wait! I got pepperoni and spinach for my deep dish and I am a fan of deep dish. Wow. The sauce is sweet but tangy and the cheese....so much goodness! The small individual pizza looks small, but is fairly big and difficult to finish. The crust is crunchy and a bit thicker than I hoped for, but still very tasty! I did not finish my deep dish because it was just so much (Shame, shame!), but was glad to have it while on the walk back. The staff is friendly and really nice.

Here's my side-by-side comparison: 5. Uno's: Medium-density crust. Heavy on the cheese, medium on the sauce. Zesty sauce. Solid salads. 4. Giordano's: The most well-rounded (potentially) of the deep dishes. Medium-density crust. Heavy on the cheese, light on the sauce. Sweet sauce. Great salads--would go light on the dressing. 3. Lou Malnati's: High-density crust, probably the most densely infused with butter. Hard and crispy. Heavy on the cheese, medium on the sauce. Sweet sauce. Solid salads. 2. Pequod's: Light-density, airy crust (as airy as deep dish goes haha). Added bonus (!) acclaimed halo of cheese surrounding the crust. Medium on the cheese, heavy on the sauce. Sweet, savory sauce. Average salads; definitely more options for greens at the other deep dish venues.   1. Gino's east: Medium-density FLAKY, buttery crust. Heavy on the cheese AND sauce. Sweet, zesty sauce. Awesome salads. Definitely love Pequod's, and it would totally be my fave if the Gino's combo didn't strike my fancy so fittingly. I think the attraction in Pequod's is that they dare to be different. Most deep dish places are just a variation on the theme.

I defend this place A LOT against warnings of insufferable service and bad crowd control. I am willing to cut them a lot of slack for their pizza. It is an attraction for which a bad personality is sometimes forgivable. And I've been coming long enough that I know better than to expect reliable service on a Saturday, or to attempt a table during the NBA playoffs. But on a Tuesday night, in the summer offseason with zero sports, you'd think the expectation of actually getting to eat the pizza you called in 20 minutes prior that was put in 'right away' is reasonable. Yeah? We order at 6:30. We get there after a cross-town trek. We think we're fine, since there's no wait when we called, and the order went in awhile ago. We go to check in amid largely vacant tables... and are told it'll be a 40 minute wait JUST to sit. What? Pequods, I get it. Your justification makes sense, it's just not very good. I work in customer service, and I know there's 'technically' no responsibility for you to update patrons (who already ordered and are headed to your restaurant) that an influx of HUGE parties has added 40 minutes to your previously nonexistent wait, but when you are bitchy about it on arrival, and act like it's unreasonable to be taken by surprise by this development, that's what stops fans from endorsing you. Did you have to call? No. If you had? You would've saved your loyal customers $20 in cab fare, a shitload of traffic, respect, and a wasted pizza. My life isn't your problem, I get that, but there's a courtesy in not springing this on a party for whom you've already told you're cooking food for. That's how you become a restaurant whose patron recommendations start carrying warnings. I've happily put up with the unpredictability on weekends or during sports events, but as a loyal recommender of this place, I'm really disappointed. I don't whine. I just want whoever monitors this to know that it's becoming a reputation people are listening to.

Toppings were very generous. Ultimately I was not a fan of the crust or the sauce which was sweeter than average. I've wanted to like this place and gone back a couple of times.

What I ordered: Onion Rings (about 7 of them pathetically displayed on a plate) 12 inch Deep dish pizza with Sausage and Basil The Crust - Spongy cornmeal somewhere in between buttery, crispy and soggy. Not terrible but as far as a foundation for a pie its nothing exciting. The Sauce - If there were any herbs or spices in the sauce, I couldn't taste them. Pizza suffers the most when the sauce is bad and this was just tomato paste and sugar with maybe a sprinkle of pepper. The Cheese - this was the most disappointing part of the whole meal, there was no flavor and no salt. My professional guess is that they use a cheap skim milk mozzarella, no provolone or whole milk. It reminded me of peal and eat mozzarella sticks from a gas station, but that would be insulting cause at least those are loaded with sodium. The Toppings - the second worst part about this pizza, it was adorned with about 10 pieces of sausage the size of golf balls and what was probably 3 leaves of furiously fine shredded basil. The sausage was actually pretty good but there wasn't nearly enough of it, about 2 pieces a piece. And the basil, I'm not sure they even put any on it.",-0.99,0.732,0.07,0.198,0.6541383219954648

There's actually very little tomato sauce and the toppings lie on top (compared to ones I've had before which were filled with a tomato sauce / topping mixture).

Came here for a date during Blackhawks season (not sure if that was a good idea) and they happen to be playing at the same time (Go Hawks!) This place was a serious deep dish pizza spot mixed with a sports bar. If you lived in Chicago, you probably have had Lou Malnati's Pizzeria and Giordano's Pizza which are both GREAT traditional Chicago deep dish pizza however Pequod's Pizza takes it to another level with a caramelized deep dish pizza crust. Do NOT let that crust scare you. The burnt cheese caramelized crust is amazing! Let's not forget about the rest of the pizza! They build their deep dish pizza just as good as Lou Malnati's Pizza and Giordano's Pizza. A small deep dish pizza comes out to be 4 slices of heaven and just right for two people. Throw down on some local beer and your meal will be perfect! The original location is in Morton Grove which still exist today. It is also a smaller place but not as busy as the Chicago location. Wait times at the Chicago location can get up to 2 hours specially when there is a game playing. They do not take reservations but BEST TIP is to call ahead and put your name on the waiting list. The service was great and they were on top of everything even when they were busy with a wait at 2+ hours. Great vibe in the place especially when there is a game on. You cannot even tell they had a fire in the place at one point (January 2006) which they shut down for six months to rebuild. Be glad they did rebuild because it is amazing pizza that would be missed. I would bring everyone here including folks from out of town (which I have!) Small groups might be good but large groups might be difficult. It might be a little rowdy to come here on a date during a game but it would be worth it if they are into Chicago teams.

Pequod's is located caddy corner to a fairly new shopping center, with a movie theatre, Barnes and Nobles, etc. Parking 3/5 Fairly easy. Found street parking a couple blocks down. There is lot parking across the street, but we didn't want to have to pay. Ambience 3/5 The place essentially looks like a long sports bar ( yelp.com/biz_photos/pequ… ). Bar on the left as you walk in, and most or all of the tables are stool height. Restrooms are in the back across from the kitchen and are pretty clean for a sports bar. Service 4.5/5 Actually really good. This earned them the fourth star for me. Our server was really nice, and checked in with us pretty regularly. There was a mix up with our order (I'll get to that later), but she fixed it by giving us half off our food bill. She didn't have too, but the fact that she did was pretty awesome of her. Wait time 1/5 Seating - B Waited about 20 minutes for seats. Not bad Drinks - A Ordered a pitcher of 312 of the menu ( yelp.com/biz_photos/pequ… ) and this came out quick. Food - F Expect to wait longer for deep dish, but this time there was a mix up with our order. The tables around us all got their food before us. We ended up not getting our food for almost an hour and a half. By the time it showed up we were hungry and grumpy. However, we were not as grumpy as we could have been, as the server told us beforehand that she would take half off the price of food for us. Food 4/5 Jalapeno poppers - 3/5 They didn't suck and they tied us over.....kind of. Large Pepperoni Sausage and Onion ( yelp.com/biz_photos/pequ… ) - A Bomb. Very comparable to Lou Malnati's. I'm a huge fan of deep dish, since I don't eat it very often. I'm not a big fan of pepperoni in general (shame on me), but everyone else wanted it. Small Sausage Mushroom and Basil ( yelp.com/biz_photos/pequ… ) - A- Very tasty but the crust was a bit burnt. Not enough to make it a crappy meal, but then again we had been waiting for over an hour for this.  Overall 4/5 Food was good, and the service staff did an amazing job trying to make us happy despite of the mix up in the kitchen. Sometimes $h!t happens, but it's all about how they react to it that sets them above other restaurants.

2014-06-12,4.0,"My fellow New Yorkers know - Chicago deep-dish pizza ain't pizza. The dense vessel of bread augmented with a vertical growth of irrelevant toppings and something like an inch of cheese is more like pie, or bad lasagna... or some other obscene thing characterized by gross excessiveness rather than a relationship to that majestic food form we call pizza. That said, Pequod's serves up a damn delicious deep dish ""pizza"" (yes, you still need a fork to eat it). The difference between Pequod's and the other, very overrated Chicago deep-dish heavyweights is that Pequod's lines the cast-iron pan with cheese before baking the pizza. The result is a beautifully blackened edge of, yep, fried cheese - that holds the pizza together instead of becoming soggy after a minute and breaking off from the rest of the pie. The crust is also slightly thinner than the refined carb parties of Lou Malnati's or Giordano's, both of whom have totally mediocre deep-dish due to a dry monster crust of solid bread and an avalanche of cheese and too-sweet sauce that slides off the second you lift your slice out of the pan. Our medium ""pan pizza"" (as they call it) with jalapenos and mushrooms cost $20 and was ready for pickup in 30 minutes. The restaurant looks like a regular old Chicago bar: low-key, dirty worn wooden floors, maybe you'd see lots of daisy dukes if it had been warm enough. It was totally empty on a Wednesday at 10:30pm, though they're open conveniently til 2am. Call ahead to place an order even if eating in, since the pizza takes a half hour to cook either way. The first deep dish I've actually liked as food and not spectacle! Mmm.",0.8481,0.832,0.102,0.066,0.4824938082750583

Not sure if they still do it but Monday-Friday from 10:30AM - 3-PM you can get a small deep dish with your choice of toppings (for like $1 extra if you choose 3 or more but that's including meats). I ordered their medium sized deep dish before and it was huge! I only finished 2 slices and I was full. It took me like 2 days to finish it. This is coming from someone who has a ridiculous appetite and can probably compete in those food contest. Check this place out if you love pizza. It is kinda pricey but that's because of all the ingredients they put into their pizza. Oh, the wait is really long.

2014-06-07,2.0,"Maybe I was expecting a lot. I was in Chicago for a few days and I really wanted to try their famous deep dish pizza. Given the high reviews, I thought this would make an excellent first experience.  Thinking this place might be busy, I had called this place to make a reservation. When I arrived and told them of my reservation, I was asked to wait for almost half an hour despite there being open tables. They were however very busy so I let this one slide. I was told the pizza would take a while to cook so I ordered some appetizers while we waited. I ordered the appetizer combo which consisted of mozzarella sticks, jalepeno poppers, breaded mushrooms, and something else that I dont even remember. Why dont i remember? because they all tasted the same. They were all just breaded up in some bread crumbs and deep fried and tastes more like something from the frozen foods aisle of a grocery store than a restaurant. Even the presentation sucked. But I let this one slide as well. This is a pizza place after all, and I should let pizza be the judge of this place.  So the pizza came and it looked great. After a few bites, I must say that it was okay. I really really tried to like it, but it tasted okay. The ""carmelized crust"" was more like burnt crust. Unlike a normal deep dish where it is comprised mostly of cheese and toppings with a thin crust, here the pan pizza had a very thick crust and a very thin topping. I felt like I was eating a pizza bagel. After this experience, I almost believed that I just didnt like chicago pizza. Thank god I went to Lou Malnati's two days later and had some real deep dish.

2014-06-02,1.0,"I love Pequods Pizza. Anytime someone comes to visit and asks to be taken to get ""Chicago Deep Dish"" I completely ignore their request and take them to Pequods because I love it and I know they will too. That makes this review all that more disappointing to write. I was having an NBA playoffs party this weekend and decided to order a large Pequods for this special occasion. I don't live super close to Pequods so I didn't mind that it took over an hour and a half for the pizza to get there. But the pizza that did arrive was badly misshapen, and cold. As we had been waiting for over an hour and a half, we each grabbed slices and began to eat before we realize that this was a plain cheese pizza we were eating, NOT the pizza we ordered.  I called Peaquods to explain the problem. The manager was put on the phone and instead of apologizing,  angrily told me that because we had eaten slices, we would have to PAY for a new pizza to be delivered. When I pointed out that this didn't really make sense, as we had already waited a long time, and the mistake was theirs, she pointed out that ""if we sent you another pizza, then our owner would be out TWO pizzas"" . No apology, no attempt to make it right. Peaquods solution was that we should wait 3 hours for the right pizza and give them back the other pizza so that they could deliver it as well. I don't know what pizza place would be ok with sending a 3 hour old pizza that had been misdelivered and sitting in someone else's house for the night to customers that had been waiting and spending a good amount of money ($30 for one large pizza delivered) for a fresh hot pizza.  The manager was beyond rude to me, and insisted that the only way they could get me the correct pizza, was to charge me for it, or have me accept a smaller pizza. We accepted the smaller pizza, and it did not arrive until Midnight, over 3 hours after we initially ordered.  I have NEVER been treated so rudely or expected to not only wait on but PAY for a mistake that a restaurant made.  I have eaten at Pequods about once a month for years, and as a coach, often take my sports teams there for end of season parties. I hate to say it because I love the pizza so much, but I don't think I'll be going back there again after being treated so poorly and rudely.",-0.8556,0.841,0.069,0.09,0.5048417851989281

I just know that Pequod's was really, REALLY good. We had reservations at 6:30pm. Their version of ""reservations"" is basically priority seating, you still have to wait a bit depending on how many people are there. I'd recommend waiting outside (if it's not too chilly) because it's quite crowded inside around dinner time and you can get bonked on the head or jabbed in the back with some pizza pans. Also while you're waiting, you can start looking at the menu and deciding what you want. You can even order before you sit down! Something I wish we had known.. We sat down and ordered a pitcher of Goose Island 312. Great local beer, btw. The three of us also ordered cheesy garlic bread for starters. We were reluctant since we knew there would be a lot of carbs to be consumed with our deep dish, but went for it anyways. It was one of the best decisions ever. A common mistake that people make is forgetting this is deep dish. Usually it would be perfectly fine for 3 people to get a large 14"" NY style pizza, but since this was Chicago style, we downsized to a medium 10"" (sausage, mushroom, onion) and still struggled to finish. There were 6 slices and we all struggled finishing the last one. I think I left half of it on my plate and ended up picking at the toppings because I could not physically fit any more food in my stomach. I wanted to though.

Arguably the ONLY deep dish of the north side, Peqoud's is leagues beyond Gino's East or Giordanno's. There are several reasons why this Lincoln Park treasure, quietly nestled on northeast side of Clybourn dominates the deep. Peqoud's uses a great blend of mild spices to season their crispy, yet soft and chewy dough. The cooking process infuses these flavors that delightfully accent their robust marinara and enhance the flavor of the mild cheese.  The secret to their amazingness is actually their crust. A generous layer of burnt cheese that every voluptuous bite tantalized you towards. The first bite of the crust will spiral you into a Peqoud's obsession! My standard topping have become extra cheese, meatball and jalapeño. It's a great balance of savory and heat balanced by the excessively perfect amount of milky, deLISHous cheese. I've yet to yet to giardiniera (sp*) but the time is soon to come. They have great service in the restaurant/bar (which you have upstairs- restaurant, or downstairs- bar - to choose from). Delivery is extremely consistent, as is pickup. Their projected timelines are honest and ALL their staff are friendly and humble.

2014-05-08,5.0,"My favorite deep dish/pan pizza in the city, and it's not even a close call. First you must recognize the difference between pan pizza and deep dish/stuffed pizza. If you're looking for a cheese overdose and are expecting that mozza string that only breaks when you're holding the paddle a foot over your head, that is not this pizza, that is stuffed pizza. I prefer the ""light"" and fluffy crust of pan pizza to the thickly packed, flattened down cornmeal covered deep dish crust. Admittedly no there is not a ton of cheese on here, but I don't think that's too bad of a thing, especially when they offer extra cheese. I remember having Lou Malnati's for the first time and feeling disappointed. I don't like the patty layer of sausage, and with a lot of stuffed pizza places the toppings are under the cheese, which I really don't care for. The toppings should be crispy on top with a little char, not soggy floating around in cheese. Peqoud's took every tweak I would make in other pan pizza formulas and applied the changes I would make to create the perfect pie.  LOL @ the review that said the cheesy garlic bread looked like they just added butter, garlic, and cheese to the bread wtf did you think cheesy garlic bread would have on it, foie gras?  The caramelized cheese crust, I don't even need to tell you about, you've already heard it. Service is spot on, not in your face every minute, but your glass is never empty. The place is deceivingly larger than you think because they have an upstairs, so don't be discouraged if it looks full when you walk in! Anyway the pizza is also gorgeous, I remember finishing a huge slice and being full, and the table next to us was just getting their pie delivered to their table and I was like ""Ooo I want that. Wait. I have that. I just ate that. Omg I want theirs too though.""

Let's start with the marinara sauce: A little sour, garlicky and spicy. Unlike other pizzas, where the marinara it's just there almost for decor, in pequod's the marinara elevates the flavor to new heights! The borders of the crust are composed of burnt cheese which makes it crispy and chewy at the same time.  The only downside to this place is that it gets packed! Beware people! Don't go there hungry. And if you crave for it during the weekends, plan it because sometimes it takes them more than 1hr for pick up orders and more than 1.5 hrs for a table.",0.4453,0.948,0.034,0.019,0.496969696969697

It came with mozzarella sticks, jalapeño poppers, zucchini slices and mushrooms. We shared a large pie amongst the 5 of us, and slices themselves are decently large. I ate 1.5 slices myself.

After a few beers, while waiting for the pies: I watched chick ice skating on the Olympics. Gotta love that chick ice skating... The pizza: THICK crust. Burnt black at the top edges from the cast iron pan. HUGE toppings, like sausage the size of a half-dollar. Pepperoni? Yup it's on there, a lot of it. Every now and then, a sharp bit of garlic, and plenty of mushrooms goodness. Crisp bottom to the crust, but light interior. Quite a bit of dough.  A lot of places do that thing where the toppings are in the middle and topped with sauce. Not here, it's definitely a pan pizza with the goodness on top. In short: This is one badass pie.

The beer menu is decent, but the pricing was a little more craft beer bar than local pizza place.  I had a Goose Island Green Line for $6.   You can request a table on their website - and it's foolish if you don't do this for a Saturday night.  My request was for 5:30, but because of the snow and traffic, we didn't get here until closer to 6:00 p.m.  When we arrived, I told the hostess about our reservation, but we were handed a pager and informed of a 10 minute wait.    We were seated at the worst possible table in the place.  During our entire meal, patrons were shoving by as they crowded in the ""waiting"" area, which is essentially maybe ten square feet of floor in front of the hostess stand.  I got elbowed in the back a few times, sometimes it was inevitable and some people apologized.  Others didn't and were too consumed with grouching about their wait.  Even the servers had trouble getting through the crowd!  If you can, get a seat as far away from the door as possible.  I'm happy that even though we were late, we got a seat quickly, but the layout sucks and Pequod's is best avoided during peak times unless you're placing a carryout order. The mascot still has me confused.  I don't know what a whale with...is that a thong on it's face?...has to do with pizza.",0.3588,0.831,0.087,0.083,0.550925925925926

The crust (oh, the crust!) is a chewy, buttery, jewel of a treat in and of itself, and is what stands out the most.  It is not the floury, floppy NYC crust with the fabled magic mineral-water flavor of which I'm fond, and it's not the behemoth uber deep dish pie that people associate with Chicago.  It's more like a Pizza Hut deep dish on roids.  I can't believe I'm going to say Pizza Hut in a Pequod's review, but it is the easiest way to describe the general shape of the pizza.  Either way, Pizza Hut, you're welcome. Cheese, sauce, toppings are all strong enough to hold their own as well.  Just do yourself a favor, (stop me if you've heard this) if you are going to Chicago you HAVE to eat at Pequod's.  Sure, if you have time- check out the John Hancock building and Millennium Park, but by all means, get Pequod's.",0.9853,0.844,0.156,0.0,0.6281481481481482

I live a couple of blocks away from this place and was hoping for a good pizza joint walking distance from my house. If it was even close to okay I would be a regular. Maybe the thin crust is better.

2014-01-27,5.0,"Pequod's is not a traditional Chicago Deep Dish like Lou Malnati's,  but it is quite possibly the best deep dish pizza in Chicago. The sauce: sweet and zesty. The crust: puffy and crispy on the outside, but there's more... Pequod's pan pizza has caramelized (read: burnt) cheese on the outer crust, which is created by laying slices of cheese up against the inside wall of the pan and letting it run down around the outside of the crust as it rises and bakes (there is no ""sprinkling"" involved). This cheesy, crispy outer char-crust is the reason you come here. When ordering, make sure you order the PAN pizza and not the thin crust.  The thin, although not bad (I've had better thin crust), does not have this crunchy cheesy goodness on it's outer crust, and you will leave disappointed, like many New Yorkers seem to have already done on Yelp. Keep the number of toppings to a minimum. I recommend only 2 toppings at a time, but I wouldn't go over 3. Don't go overboard or you will lose the greatness of this pizza in all of the toppings. Avoid anchovies at all costs! My fellow Pequod-a-holics and I have come up with a consensus of good combinations; here are a few of our favorites: Pepperoni and Garlic - You really can't go wrong with this one (My personal favorite). Italian Sausage and Pepperoncini (spicy yellow peppers) - for the people who like a little heat. Italian Sausage and ... just about anything - They have great Italian Sausage at Pequod's. Pepperoni / Sausage combo - best of both worlds. Spinach and Garlic - a classic combo (even better with Italian Sausage). The Heartstopper - You could ask for it by name, but they won't know what the heck you're talking about. This is the only exception to the 3 toppings or less rule. Every meat available goes on this pie (Sausage, Ground Beef, Canadian Bacon, Pepperoni), with the optional addition of fresh garlic, and yes, you do run the risk of not getting the full effect of a Pequod pizza, but ... damn, it's good.

It seems watching the Hawks here would be a good idea. The pizza: it wasn't bad, but it sure was a lot of bread.  The ""carmelized"" crust is more like burned cheese crust, but I actually enjoyed that quite a bit.  The sausage chunks are excellent, with even a hint of sweetness to them.  However, the bottom line is that the sauce and cheese don't have enough flavor to match other famous Chicago pizza places. I tossed some crushed red pepper and parmesan on top and the flavor improved greatly.  It is a good deal too, unlike Art of Pizza or Gino's.

2013-11-27,4.0,"Pequod's was literally the first stop on our weekend Chicago trip and the absolute perfect way to kick it off. We came at the suggestion of a knowledgeable foodie friend who encouraged us to try an alternative to the tourist-y Giordano's and other larger brands. We arrived ~12pm on a Sat, and there was ample seating available. From reading reviews, I feared that it would take a long time for our pizzas to cook, but it took maybe 30 minutes max for the main features to arrive. We passed some of the wait time with the Pequod's salad--I thought it turned out to be amusingly like a pizza salad because it has cheese and pepperoni on it. We ordered two medium deep dish pizzas, one with pepperoni and onion, and one with spinach and mushroom, the latter I had a heavy hand in designing since those are the best veggies paired with ooey gooey cheese.  I think I need to expand my vocabulary because ""yummy"" doesn't quite do the flavors justice. Pequod's signature caramelized cheese is a winner, especially if you like burn in a good toasty way. One interesting aspect of their pizzas is that the crust is more crunchy, or crouton-like rather than bread-like. While we chatted animatedly while waiting for the pies, we became quieter upon encountering their deliciousness firsthand and focusing our energies on gobbling slice after slice. Soon our party of five (including three guys with large appetites) were satiated, plus we had a slice leftover. Best of all, it was quite an inexpensive meal at ~$12 per person, considering we got a salad in addition to pizza and that we were in a big city, where I automatically assume everything is pricier. By the time we left the two floors of the restaurant were pretty full, so I believe Pequod's serves excellent true Chicago deep dish pizza more appealing to locals.

This caramelization gives a great contrast to the very thick and dense pie.  By the time we arrived at Pequod's (after hitting THREE other pizza joints) I was quite full. So, I opted for the spinach version while the bf had the sausage/pepperoni pie.

However it took 1:20 to get the pizza from the time we ordered it, and we pre-ordered it.  Way too long.  We were seated upstairs, where I wouldn't go again  even if I was told there was a pot of gold up there.  This is where the wait staff dumps dishes and silverware from cleared tables.  It's also where they like to seat groups.  Because of the background noise, the people at large tables can only hear each other when they yell at each other.  This only adds to the noise, with people at every table yelling and screaming at each other just to be heard.  It's awful, just awful. If you must go, avoid upstairs and especially the back room like the plague. The first sign that the 60 something owner is a kind of a douche is that he has a pony tail to the middle of his back.  Now, I don't really hold that against him, but it starts to paint a picture.  He likes pro hockey, and I appreciate that.  However, he insists that every TV be tuned to pro hockey.  The night we were there, 4-0 Northwestern was playing at home against 5-0 Ohio State, perhaps NW's biggest home game in 10 years.  He refused to turn just one of the seven tv's off hockey to the NW game.  And even after the first period of hockey was over and there was 18 minutes of intermission advertising, he refused to turn just one tv to football during the intermission.  Douche.  Now remember, each NHL team plays 82 regular season games each year.  He can't change one tv just once, even during intermission? There are a couple of other very good pizza places within two miles of Pequods.   Considering the wait after ordering, the unbearable noise, and an owner who could care less about customer service, I will not be eating at Pequod's again.  If you must have their pizza, order it to go.",0.8705,0.859,0.081,0.06,0.47881015536187954

Well, if you've never had it, here's the straight talk: caramelized crust = burnt cheese crust.

As in potentially-cancer-inducing burnt. If you're into that, then this is your place. As for me, um, no thanks. Jet's Pizza is caramelized. Pequod's is burnt. Simple as that. What's more, one of our two pizzas had a burnt crust on the bottom. The servers didn't seem to care a lick about it. When we talked to the manager, he shrugged his shoulders and said the pizza happened to be in a hotter spot in the stove. OK. But we still don't like burnt-bottom-crust pizza. After some more (polite) discussion, the manager gave us a replacement pizza...but of course we had to wait another 20 minutes for it.

2013-09-23,5.0,"One of my new favorite deep dish pizza spots. I've been to Giordano's, Gino's East, Lou Malnati's, and now this one and Gino's East will be my ""go-to"" places for pizza on my Chicago trips. The wait wasn't terrible - on a Saturday evening, we had a party of 8 call ahead to be put down on the list, and we waited for 5-10 minutes when we got there. Much better than the lines at Gino's East, and I love the fact that you can call ahead of time to get put on a ""priority list"" for faster seating when you get there. As an appetizer, we got wings which were pretty unmemorable, and a fried sampler assortment ($8.95) of mushrooms, mozzarella sticks, zucchini sticks and jalapeno poppers. Everything was fried in the same batter, so it was pretty much a guess as to what you were actually eating until you put it in your mouth. I liked the deep fried mushrooms that I had, but I like most deep-fried things. The Cheesy Garlic Bread ($3.95) is just okay. Save your carbs for the pizza. Ditto on the salad - it was good and made us feel slightly better about carb-heavy dinner, but it was nothing to write home about. The pizza on the other hand was phenomenal. The crust was crispy and not soggy in the middle; the tomato sauce was the right proportion and the amount of cheese was just right. I loved both the pepperoni pizza and the sausage & spinach pizza that we got. I think less toppings is more when it comes to ordering, so that the toppings don't completely overwhelm the crust, tomato, and cheese. The large size is pretty generous, and being 8 girls, most people ate 1.5 slices each. The price is affordable too - we paid $25 a piece which included beer, appetizers, salad, and 2 large pizzas (split between 8 people). Would highly recommend over Lou Malnati's and Giordano's and I'm looking forward to coming back here again for more!",0.995,0.84,0.16,0.0,0.5165334982477839

2013-09-06,4.0,"Deep dish ain't pizza; it's lasagna with bread. That's cool, though. It still tastes pretty good, and I've yet to meet a native Chicagoan who will fight to the death to defend his city's pizza as the finest creation known to man. That said, I've eaten my fair share of deep dish and figured it's always good to have a place in your back pocket for when the family and friends come to visit. I've done the big three gauntlet and Lou Malnati's is my winner. However, I asked around for the best ""local"" spot to grab a deep dish slice, and the answer came back Pequod's. Pequod's is small, grungy, and really looks like half a bar than serves pizza on the side. But aside from all that, Pequod's actually makes a rather nice pie. There's nothing special on the menu, just the basics. Start with a cheese, and ingredient your way up. I was already massively hungry, so we ordered jalapeno poppers to start. I'll take the cheddar/yellow/orange filling over cream cheese any day of the week, so Pequod's already got off the blocks well. Still not as good as Jack in the Box, which makes an incomparable popper. But good. Pequod's deep dish, unlike the Big 3, isn't overzealous with the bread. It's still a chore to eat, but for different reasons. Pequod's says it caramelizes its crust, but what that really means is they char it to a crisp. For a guy that loves blackened anything (especially char on brisket), I loved it. Aside from the char, the breading is thinner than the typical deep dish, and much easier to eat. The sauce is plentiful (another check mark in my book), and although I'd heard that Pequod's goes easy on the cheese, the white stuff was still overkill for me. The tomato sauce came extra sweet, almost, say, Pizza Hut style as opposed to the more pomodoro/crushed tomato sourish taste.",0.9901,0.832,0.146,0.021,0.4549498746867167

She summoned the manager who immediately admitted that the pizza was below par and ""undercooked by about 2 minutes"" (10% of the cooking time, he later clarified). He offered to ""throw a few slices back into the oven"" but agreed it would not be the same even cook that a pizza should have - if you run a pizza joint yet can't make a pizza properly, ain't that a problem? The venue itself was nothing special, which we actually liked, but the guys who bring the pizza to your table are also busy taking bags of trash and big dirty trash cans around the restaurant and there is NOT a lot of hand washing going on.   In the end, we paid for the pizza but only ate a few nibbles around the edges.  Overall, can't say that Pequod's takes pride in its craft: aside from the front from staff, the toppings were rather chaotically tossed all over the ill-cooked pizza and it was clearly made in haste by people that consider making pizza just a job.  Without a little passion coming from the kitchen, might as well eat Pizza Hut.",0.9524,0.813,0.122,0.065,0.4062369178440607

Maybe it was the 1.5 mile walk from the El that deterred me, maybe it was the AWFUL first date going on at the table next to me, maybe my expectations were too high - but I just thought it was okay.  Don't get me wrong, it was certainly above chain pizza crap and I did enjoy it, but it didn't knock me off my rocker. I had a personal pizza with nearly everything on it, and I think maybe that was the problem. I didn't get the entire essence of Pequod's because my sister doesn't like deep dish and I was stuck with a baby pizza.

We were seated immediately in a booth at the back.  Our server got to our table about a minute later and took our drink order.  Their draft beer selection isn't too exciting but they had a few Goose Island brews along with Great Lakes so we were a-ok.  We ordered cheesy garlic bread to start.  They brought it out after maybe 10 mins so it wasn't too bad.  You pretty much get 2 decent size pieces.  We just cut each in half and enjoyed.  It was very cheesy and had great crisp, almost burnt ends.  They were the best part!!!  We ordered a large pan sausage and pepperoni.  It did take about 20 mins which wasn't a big deal.  It is fun to people watch and they have tv's scattered throughout.  The pizza was very good.  It is thick with lots of toppings.  The crust was awesome!!

This is my experience at Pequod's... it's a bit of a read, but it should give an idea of what you can expect. Hey, I don't eff around with Yelp reviews like other goons who say, ""Mm. Tasty. Go here."" and call it a review... nuh-uh. Here's a tale, my friends... First of all, if it weren't for the big fat five star rating above this review, you'd probably think I absolutely hated Pequod's until the end of it. On a Saturday night at around 7:30 or so, I came with a party of four and made a reservation: ""Your wait will be about forty-five minutes to an hour."" After walking back outside and seeing about twenty people sitting around, I knew that was probably a lie, but whatever. I'll wait. Forty-five minutes go by and I decide it'd be best to order my pizza before getting our table -- done and done: a large pan pizza with sausage and pepperoni. Another twenty minutes later, I go back in after noticing a party of six that got there way after us got a table. I was about to freak my shit, but then I figured they had a reservation. Still, a little while longer, there was a group of four that got to Pequod's soon after we did that got seated. At that point, I went inside and asked how much longer, and they said ""There are about four tables in front of you, so maybe about twenty minutes?"" I was so hungry at this point that I wasn't even mad ... and I get mega cranky when I'm hungry. After walking outside and telling my group that the wait would be even *longer*, they started walking away. After they got about a block away (I was still in line. No way in hell was I going to just leave after already waiting over an hour), we got buzzed in. Fucking FINALLY. I assume that the reservation people dun goofed their shit and overlooked my party, and got us a table ASAP before we left. We got sat down in the far back corner in the right of the restaurant, which worked well with me. Pequod's is a pretty tiny place, so being away from all the elbows is probably for the best. To get some food in our stomachs, we got the mozerella sticks, which were said to be a ""must buy"" from some reviewers here. I will say, I would definitely agree with that had the cheese been more melted. The breading on them is great, and the marinara dipping sauce is perfect. After about ten to fifteen minutes of MORE waiting, our pre-ordered pizza came. What a work of art. Huge pieces of sausage basically gave the equivalent of one full link per slice, and there was a generous amount of pepperoni. Pequod's doesn't skimp like some other places -- there's nothing worse than paying over $2 for an additional topping and getting only a few pieces. This may be the best pizza I've ever had... as good as the toppings and sauce were, the crust truly makes Pequod's stand out. Chewy, crispy, burnt (well, they call it caramelized)... damn, I could eat this just about any day. It's rare that I, or anybody that I talk to, can excuse such an excessive wait time no matter how awesome the food is, but this is an exception. Altogether, I probably waited about 90 minutes until I got in and ate my pizza. If I hadn't ordered my pizza beforehand, it would probably have been two full hours. In the future, I'll *have* to call ahead and make a reservation, because as unbelievably delicious as this pizza is, I have a hard time waiting over an hour at a restaurant. Pequod's doesn't exactly have what many people associate as ""deep dish"", ""Chicago-style"" pizza, but it does have an unreal pan pizza that will satisfy your tastebuds... legendary.",0.9963,0.803,0.139,0.058,0.48207323865218615

I ordered a large pan pizza for delivery with sausage on the whole thing, one half onion and green pepper, and the other half bacon. We were not quoted a delivery time and the pizza ended up taking around 1 hour and 20 minutes to be delivered. It wouldn't surprise me if this is standard for a Friday night, but it would have been nice to be told that on the phone. Additionally, the pizza arrived with canadian bacon instead of real bacon. I now know that they don't have bacon as a topping, but we ordered from our car without a menu and clearly asked for ""bacon"", not ham or canadian bacon. The person taking our order should have been able to catch this before it became a problem.  As for the pizza, I was completely underwhelmed. They went REALLY light on the toppings. There were many bites that contained no toppings at all.This is very disappointing considering we paid 2.75 for full toppings and 1.75 for half toppings. I also wasn't a fan of the crust. It was like eating pizza off a soggy piece of bread. I'm not sure if the crust is meant to be like this or if the juices from the toppings soaked into the crust while the pizza was in transit to our house. Either way, it wasn't good.

Great deep dish needs a good sauce, cheese, and a good crust at a minimum. Here's why I think Pequod's is merely alright--nothing special. Pequod's sauce is pretty unremarkable, I don't think it had much of a taste quite honestly. My deep dish did not have much cheese either, considering most competitor pizzas put up to 2"" of cheese in a deep dish. Finally, my biggest complaint about Pequods is the crust! I know alot of people rave about it but I thought it was gross. This is not pizza crust, it is like a spongy cake! To me, pizza crust should be buttery and crunchy, not cake-like and bland.

On a warm, sunny Saturday, the place was pretty busy with a 30 minute wait around 6:45 pm.  You'd do well to order while you wait since the pizzas can take 45 minutes or more to make.  We waited outside on the bench facing Clybourn, until our buzzer finally went off and we went to our booth - the place is bigger than it looks, with two floors and several rooms.  The atmosphere was a lot like a neighborhood bar - lively and fun, with TVs playing the game and lots of people drinking and laughing. We started with a pitcher of Blue Moon, the first of two, and after about 45 minutes in the oven our spinach-and-sausage pizza came to the table.  The server cut the first slices, and the hot cheese stretched high - so appetizing!   Unlike a lot of deep dish, this pizza doesn't taste greasy or heavy.  Sure it's a lot of food, but it tastes almost fresh.  The spinach was abundant, the sausage had to be homemade - it was full of flavor and spices.  The crust stayed crispy the whole time, never getting weighed down by sauce and toppings.  My friend pointed out that I'd basically inhaled my first slice - I was hungry, but it was also so delicious I didn't want to take a break!  A large pizza filled three of us (with one piece left over).  Any appetizers would've just filled us up for no good reason so I'm glad we just stuck to pizza.

We have been coming here for years and it was always consistently tasty.    This place is always busy especially when it is their lunch or dinner rush.  We always order ahead on our way there so it doesn't take forever for the food to come out after we order.  Deep dish usually takes about 40 minutes to cook. Calling ahead also guarantees us a seat faster since our food is being made.  Never waited over 5 minutes even if it is a hour and a half wait.   We always order mozzarella sticks to start.  Their marinara dipping sauce has to be one of the best I have ever tried.  Sweet and savory.  We also get a medium deep dish pizza with: extra cheese, sausage, onions, green peppers and half mushroom.  OMG - BEST ever.  Cheese just oozing away.  Mounts of toppings and sweet marinara sauce. Their crust is perfectly cooked and the burnt cheese edges are perfect.    The staff is very friendly, fast and productive.  They are very well managed by the moment you walk in the door.  I will also come here for deep dish pizza no matter what!!!",0.991,0.81,0.181,0.009,0.4427536231884059

2013-05-10,4.0,"After hearing a lot about this place from friends, my wife and I decided to finally give it a try. And what do you know: it's now one of our favorite pizza spots.  Located in a good area with lots of shopping and even a movie theater across the street, this place starts off great. You walk in, there is always a line up so you put your name down and stand with the crowd with a pager in your hand. In the mean time, you can order your pizza so that when it's time for you to be seated, the pizza won't be too long. Since this is a sports bar as well, it is very crowded but lively. Don't let the place fool you because there is another floor upstairs with lots of seating room.  We sat upstairs both times that we visited. The appetizers are also fresh and tasty. But let's talk about the thick crust pizza: it's NOT like pizza UNO, like Giordano's, or any other deep dish pizza you might think of. This is in a class of its own. The deep dish pizza is covered with the toppings you want which is one thing I like to see...more toppings than cheese. As you bite into, or cut into the pizza, you notice that even though it is thick crust, it's not too soft or too hard or full of dough. Somehow, the thick crust isn't as dough-like as you would think and therefore, not as filling as you would think. It's perfect! The outer crust area on top has their special touch to it: it is burnt cheese all around the top which gives it more of a different flavor when added to the pizza takes the whole experience to another level.  Overall: one of our favorite pizzas in Chicago. For a regular pizza outing, I would choose Pequod's over any other ""deep-dish"" Chicago pizza.",0.9889,0.837,0.139,0.024,0.5352066839970065

Other than that, I don't suppose the 1300th review of a much-loved institution is of much use, but I'll only add that I suspect Pequod's gets a lot of extreme reactions.  Its tradmark is a ring of caramelized cheese around the crust, and a very well-done exterior.  Some people like that (me) and others don't.  But whichever one of those you are, be prepared for the fact that this doesn't taste as much like other Chicago style pizzas as you might expect.

I love their caramelized crust. I've seen a few people on here bashing it, but this is really what the pizza is all about. It's pretty thick dough on the bottom which definitely fills you up, but it doesn't dominate the pizza. The cheese and sauce they use taste delicious. I would recommend ordering the pizza with extra cheese since it normally is a bit light on the cheese for my personal preference. I've only tried sausage and pepperoni pizzas, and both toppings are tasty and high quality. The wings are delicious but small. Still, an order is plenty for two people to share.

Side note: Meeting up with a fellow Yelper is easier then someone on those Internet dating sites. Yelpers post ""real and current"" pictures.  Both Damian and I started out with a Pequot Salad (Half Size). What attracted me to this amazing salad, is that they use no Iceberg lettuce. I have a strong dislike for Iceberg and was thrilled that they use Romaine. They then garnish it a variety of fresh vegetable toppings, pepperoni, pepperoncini and cheese. If it were not for Lupe being a regular and alerting us to take note of the cheese. Damian and I both would missed the detail that the cheese is sliced in the shape of a whale. Another big bonus point is that they always serve the salad dressing on the side in a little cup.

I was afraid to be disappointed in this ""DEEP DISH"" pizza that Chicago is known for (much due to my own personal preferences) but I was blown away at how delicious and texturally fabulous this DEEP dish pizza was.  The crust is caramelized, so when you cut into it, you can feel the crispy crust breaking underneath your knife. The crust is crispy and topped with fresh cheeses, meats and veggies. The pizza must be eaten with a knife and fork BTW. The toppings (they recommend no more than 7 so that the pizza cooks thoroughly) are fresh and are lightly tossed on the deep dish pizza so that it is light and airy. Only reason why I avoid pizza is because the dough is dense and I feel overly stuffed after a single slice. The pizza here doesn't leave me feeling that way and I'm full after two slices sans caloric guilt. The place is open late and me being a spontaneous procrastinator entered with only 15 minutes left on the clock. We ordered a pizza and it was on our table in 10 mins.

It took almost 20 minutes for our appetizer of cheesey garlic bread to come out, I've made cheesy garlic bread on my pizzaz at home quicker. 5 minutes later our pizza came out, burnt on the edges might I add. I will say that the parts of the pizza that weren't scorched were good. Not out of this world, but decent.  This where our previous server disappeared. We were given the check almost immediately after receiving our food, even though my beer was full and husbands was empty. We have both worked in the restaurant/bar industry for several years.

Ratio of cheese to sauce to topping was pretty good too. The crust... I was expecting butter, or cornmeal, or something else... I frankly don't know.

Showed up about 9 o'clock and the place was packed, was originally given an hour wait for a table and ended up getting a place sitting at the bar shorty after, which was just as good as having a table for us. Bartenders and wait staff were super friendly and accommodating. Never took long to get new drinks and our water cups were always kept full, which is a huge plus in my book. *Note when we left around 11 this place was maybe half full, so later you come the better.

However the deep dish pizza here was some of the best pizza I've had in awhile, makes my top 5 list of pizza places. Ended up with a sausage and mushroom pizza and a spinach and mushroom pizza, both were great. Starting with the fresh ingredients, perfect amount of sauce and then the crust, whatever they are doing, they are doing right. Only issue was on one of the pizzas they had a lot of mushrooms all clumped together, but nothing to really complain about. Being a Blackhawks bar, really want to make it in for a game next time I visit. Could see this place getting packed and a great place to watch it with all their tv's and memorabilia.

So what have I noticed?  The dough underneath is thicker, but taste very bland and dry and there is less cheese and sauce overall.  Every bite just tastes like dry flour.  The toppings have severely decreased as well.  I ordered sausage and there was not much on there.  The quality of the dough and cheese just does not taste the same anymore either.  It was like they just bought the cheapest ingredients they could and charged the same for pizza.   There is no comparison, the pizza they are selling today is very different than what they were selling years ago.  I know because I have been eating it along the way.  It's not worth losing customers to saving a little money in cheap ingredients.  Please go back to your old recipe!",0.716,0.844,0.089,0.066,0.46015873015873004

Something about the novel idea of the crisped cheese on the crust and the freshness of the tomato sauce helped it to stand out above the other places we tried. Sadly, that is no longer the case. The pie we ordered the other day was bad in the worst way. This is not deep dish pizza, its more of a focaccia (fluffy, sort of cornmeal texture on the bottom) topped with whatever you choose. Think L and B Spumoni Gardens in NY but without all the goodness that place has. Our pizza had the thinnest possible layer of cheese on top of an inch or so of dough, with the tiniest spoonful of sauce spread over it. It was basically like eating a piece of dry focaccia with a burnt crust (yes I know they do the crisped cheese thing, but this time it was just burnt in the worst way).

2013-01-01,5.0,"So yes, there are 1200+ reviews, with the average being 4 stars. We know it's  really, REALLY good pizza.  But as a born-and-raised Chicagoan, I find myself frustrated with the many ill-informed reviews I read about our city's pizza. So I feel it's necessary to give my two cents on the matter to clarify the situation. Consider this your Chicago Style Pizzas 101. Beginning with the following: Pequod's is NOT -- I repeat -- NOT Chicago Style Deep Dish Pizza.  People assume that because the sauce is on top and it's cooked in a deep black pan, it must be deep dish. Well, that's incorrect.  There are three types that are often labeled as ""Deep Dish"" which, while true they're all cooked in a ""deep dish,"" only one of those types actually qualifies as ""Chicago Style Deep Dish pizza.  The difference is really about the crusts. A Chicago Style Deep Dish's crust is not overly thick and not really bready, but more like a pie crust (buttery, flaky). It often has an outer crust that's elevated above the rest of the dough, as if it were saying ""I am your master. WORSHIP ME.""  Examples are Gino's East and Lou Malnati's.  Giordano's, Edwardo's and Art of Pizza are Stuffed Pizzas -- usually a similar crust as the deep dish, but they all have a really thin layer of dough on top of all of the toppings, which is covered with sauce (the sauce doesn't come in actual contact with most of the toppings in the prep, other than a small hole in the middle of it). Pequod's is PAN pizza. Yes, akin to Pizza Hut's Pan Pizza -- thick, bready-inside, slightly crispy-outside crust cooked in a pan. And that's where the similarities end. Because I've already written a mini-non-fiction here, I will be brief: Pequod's was a breath of fresh air to my tastebuds and could evolve to my new favorite place to get a 'Za in the city, Everything was balanced, and that carmelized cheese edge --- ohhhh man.... The wait for a table and for our pizza was long, but as the old adage goes, ""Good things come to those who wait."" If I want deep dish, I'm going to Lou's. Stuffed? Giordano's is my place.

Doing paperwork at work.  Wish I was typing on a piece of Pequod's. Driving home.  Wish my seat belt was made of Pequod's so I could just lower my jaw and nibble on the belt. The best thing about Pequod's is the lunch special.  $4.95 is all a slice of heaven costs, along with a pop/beer.  You get 1 ingredient with your 7"" personal, so make it a good one.  Honestly though, even if you didn't put anything on it, it would be just fine.  The burnt looking thing on the crust?  It's actually quite good.  It's burned(or burnt if you're fancy) cheese that somehow doesn't taste burned, and lends awesome taste and texture to what normally wouldn't be all that great. Even without the burned rim the crust is amazing.  The fact that there isnt a ton of cheese in their pizza also makes this my favorite.  I hate when you're eating deep dish and your slice gets cold, which causes the cheese to seize up into this rubbery disk of dairy.  And every bite you take, you hate yourself more for.  These kind of shenanigans don't happen when you eat Pequod's My best friend who used to live here came to visit, along with his girlfriend.  So on our ""Chicago exclusive"" touristy day, Pequod's was where we took them for a late lunch.  My wife got a spinach and tomato personal, and the three of us split a sausage, mushroom and garlic large.   Holy balls.  I've had garlic on pizza before, but this was insane.  When they put the pie onto the whale trivet, the garlic aroma was so overpowering it hit everyone in the face and we all got black eyes.  I LOVE GARLIC.  My mouth is watering as I type these words...Giant chunks of sausage, large pieces of fresh mushroom and minced garlic everywhere, and the crust?  Oh, that crust  And that smelly garlic.  I'm glad I'm married and not looking because I felt like you could smell the pizza on me for three days after the meal.  I guess it didn't help that we had leftovers and I kept topping off my garlic smell level.   Pequod's is the perfect deep dish, for me and my wife at least.  In the 12 years that I've known her, never once has she had a craving for deep dish.  She's a cracker thin crust kind of gal.  Since we've eaten Peaquod's though, it's about a 4 week interval on the deep dish craving.   This fact alone is all you need to know how special Pequod's is.   Now go get some!

2012-12-28,5.0,"There's not much more that I can say about Pequod's pizza besides what my lovely Yelp Elite wife Kristy K penned in her love letter to Pequod's disguised as a Yelp review.  But at the risk of being repetitive, here we go.   Pequod's pan pizza is the best pizza in Chicago.  Forget about the ""big three"" Chicago-style pizzerias: Lou Malnati's, Uno's, and Gino's East.  None can compare to the glory of Pequod's.  In fact, Pequod's pan pizza is without a doubt the best pizza I have ever had in my life.  My go-to order from Pequod's is a pan pizza with pepperoni and basil.  The deep dish crust at Pequod's is unlike any other crust ever:  thick, crispy, and chewy lined with caramelized cheese that adds a perfect crisp of cheesy goodness.  This caramelized cheese became a delicacy for my wife and we had to incorporate a ""slice draft"" by which took turns drafting slices of pizza to get the ones with the optimal caramelization.  Pequod's uses pans that are decades old, which I am convinced must somehow infuse decades of delicious spices and flavor into the crust of the pizza.  The pizza sauce at Pequod's is a mix of sweetness and spiciness with a delightfully fresh herbal component.  The cheese is fantastic.  And the pepperoni is phenomenal.  Unlike other pizzerias where you might get soggy flimsy pepperoni, Pequod's roasts their pepperoni before putting them on the pizza so that they become crispy, which creates a beautiful textural contrast with the melty cheese and sauce on top while pairing with the crisp bottom crust and outer caramelized cheese.  When you put all of these elements together, the greatest pizza of all-time is born.   When I talked to my friends back in Chicago, it always shocked me to find so many people who had never tried Pequod's.  What is wrong with you people!?!   Since moving from Chicago a year ago, the one single thing that I have missed more than anything in all of Chicago is Pequod's pizza.  There is no other pizza like it anywhere!  If you live in Chicago and have not had Pequod's, you are hurting me.  Just knowing that you could pick up the phone until 4 am and have a piping hot Pequod's pizza delivered to your doorstep -- but haven't -- while I simultaneously would do just about anything for that same pleasure and delight just crushes my soul.  For me (and for yourself), give Pequod's pizza a try.  Then again, if I had never tried Pequod's, then perhaps I would not be living the desperate existence that I am now:  pining for a pizza 1,000 miles away with no hope of finding a decent replacement.  All I know is that when I visit Chicago next time I am taking a cab directly from ORD to Pequod's.  I love you Pequod's and miss you more than you'll ever know (unless you read this review, I guess).",0.9904,0.822,0.128,0.05,0.5330586080586082
2012-12-27,5.0,"I have just found my new favorite Chicago-style pizza place. The winner goes to Pequod's Pizzeria. This place has the most variety in terms of appetizer selections. I believe appetizers are important for deep dish pizza-serving restaurants largely due to the expectation that these pizzas take longer to make than thin crust ones. In addition, the Pequod's salad is pretty decent (the creamy garlic sauce is clutch).  As for the pizza itself, I was astonished. The crust, including the bottom, was crispy and solid. This is difficult to come by. I've always experienced softer/soggier bottom crusts due the way that deep dish pizzas are made in general. In addition, I'm a huge fan of their sausage topping. I definitely think they use a better grade of sausage than other pizza places. The most impressive thing I noticed at Pequod's is the relatively short amount of time it takes to bake the pizzas. I daresay it was the fastest I've seen a Chicago-style deep dish pizza come out.  Service is great, the pizza is superior, and prices are relatively cheaper than those at similar restaurants.

The atmosphere is fun and raucous, not good for an intimate date but perfect for a catchup with a friend. Our waitress was not incredibly attentive, but it may have been because we were clearly deep in conversation and she didn't want to disturb us, which I appreciate.  When the pizza came I was pretty sure even my beer and a half wasn't going to stimulate my appetite enough to tackle my portion of it. Indeed, I only got partway through my second slice because my companion mocked my lack of Chicago spirit. The first bite was exquisite. The crust is lovely and the ingredients were well distributed; fresh tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, and an ever-so-slightly crispy bottom. Everyone talks about their caramelized crust, but it's worth mentioning again because it truly does distinguish them. The second time I popped in for their lunch special, I was disappointed, particularly considering my agreeable first experience. My main issue was the service. I waited about ten minutes for my waitress to return after giving me a menu, and the restaurant was not busy by any stretch of the imagination. Eventually I asked the girl behind the bar and she ended up serving me for the most part while my waitress walked past me over and over, completely ignoring me. Perhaps she was blind in one eye and I should be kinder, but my guess is she just didn't care much. The pizza was still good, but didn't wow me like the first time. Perhaps it was that the smaller pizzas don't come in the skillet and therefore aren't protected from the elements, or perhaps it was that the atmosphere contributed heavily to my enjoyment.

It's like they took a Gino's/Giordano's/Malnati's pie, drenched the crust in fuckloads of butter and cheese, and crisped the hell out of it until it turned into a caramalized explosion of calories and cellulite. A thousand times yes. I put back one piece myself and then 2-3 crusts on top of that. And let's be honest, I wanted at least another slice, maybe five. So, so good. Coming in with a group is tricky. The server upstairs can't really handle it but she did bring us a bunch of extra pitchers of beer that I'm not sure we got charged for. Zero complaints there. The only problem is that after a slice or two, there's no room for beer in your belly.

2012-10-25,4.0,"Make a reservation.  It was nice watching St. Louis send San Francisco to the World Series (in style), but a playoff game has a finite start and end.  Waiting to sit while standing in a very crowded doorway where it's warm, or sitting and catching a bit of breathing room in the freezing cold does not.  ""Forty-five minutes"" is like telling someone it's just up the road five miles when they're driving in the country.   The wait went on for an e.t.e.r.n.i.t.y.  They let us pre-order our pizza so that when we sat, we wouldn't have to wait for eternity, part 2.  Once we sat (we had our own chairs! and table!  in the warm!  and got to catch the end of the game!), we only had to wait another ten minutes or so. Will the wait make our pizza taste like hype?  Will our pizza have been burnt to a crisp, then turn cold waiting for us?  When did Mike Matheny retire AND become a coach?!  These were the questions shooting through our minds and empty bellies.  (I think I just had a flashback to Soap - pardon me.)The pizza was amazing and okay.   You really need to start at the edge, then work your way in.  The outside crust is a perfect soft/crisp pizza cracker, flavored with years of other pizzas.  The crust is caramelized with prior pizza's flavorings and cheese, then burnt just enough.  Like the good pieces of a macaroni and cheese casserole, only with a great fatty cheese flavor.  The ingredients on the pizza are fresh - a definite score in my book.  (Home run sounded too cheesy - do I get quadruple points for a double pun, make that a triple pun?)  The center is a tad undercooked.  It's almost doughy.  Not all together bad, just not as brilliant as the outer crust.  The sauce is a bit bland, too.  Not stewed tomatoes bland, jut not zesty.

2012-10-23,3.0,"3 stars: A-OK. The perfect deep dish pizza is still our white whale. And Pequod's was the latest foray into that elusive hunt. There is a thin line between caramelization and burnt.  Sometimes 30 seconds is all it takes to pass from heavenly and delicious to hellish and inedible.  Every deep dish pizza Pequod's has ever made has been subject to this dangerous game of good vs. evil.  Sometimes, good wins, and you have a transcendental pizza experience, complete with angels singing and strumming their harps. Other times, you want to go and smash the cook in the face with the cast iron pan they kept in the oven 30 seconds too long and burned the cheese on the crust like a Russian general scorching the earth as they retreated from Napoleon.  It seems like people are trying a little too hard to make this the de-facto Chicago local deep dish pizza, but just because a restaurant has 2 locations vs 14, or doesn't have online ordering yet, or doesn't take reservations on weekend nights doesn't make it the yardstick for authentic Chicago deep dish.  Hanging a Blackhawks banner, televising Bears games, or having slightly better than the swill most pizza places have on tap doesn't really have anything to do with the pizza, and honestly, I was expecting so much more from the pizza than what Pequod's delivered. It's not a true deep dish, but rather more like a Sicilian with the cheese below the sauce. Instead of a copious amount of cheese and sauce, you get a yeasty dough that is about an inch tall. This flies in the face of true deep dish. The dough is definitely not where you want the majority of your height in a deep dish pizza. You rely on the cheese and toppings/sauce layer to make up the majority of the height in cross-section view.   Overall - Was it good? Yes. It's pizza.  It's kind of hard to ruin pizza, unless of course you burn it. Which inevitable will happen if you eat at Pequod's enough times.  It's not a matter of ""if.""  It is a matter of ""when."" Therefore, enjoy it, knowing that each time you go, you play Russian roulette with the burnt crust, and the next time might be the time you are forced to update your review with a 1-star for ruining your crust.",0.9459,0.819,0.111,0.07,0.4873263888888888

A lot of reviewers here on Yelp talk about the ""crust"".  More specifically, it's the crispy edges of the crust.  I've never seen it done anywhere else, but Pequod's ""burns"" the very edges of the pizza and it produces this toasty, cheesy goodness that defies words.  You will definitely find yourself, finding ways to eat the edges, even after your full.

(I recommend the Hawaiian if you like pieces of Canadian bacon the size of your face) But the crust! Oh, the CRUST! It was unlike any deep dish crust I've ever had, so light and fluffy and savory!

I've always liked my pizza on the crispier side, so this place seems tailor-made for me. They don't use as much tomato sauce compared to Lou's or Due's, and the meat isn't served as it's own layer either. It was well-balanced and the crust seemed like dessert afterward. Whenever I'm home, I'll be getting my deep dish from Peaquod's.  Bonus city points if you remember going to Batter Up on Lincoln just a block over back in the day.

The service was attentive and pleasant (when I dined in) and pickup was a snap (also a friendly/pleasant experience).  The decor is a blend of pizzeria, tavern, something, but I barely remember it -- I just remember getting a gorgeous pizza pie delivered to our table and loving every bite of it. Pequod's nails it. I love their pizza. I do. I'll be going back soon. P.S.: Dining in is definitely better than pick-up, but I'd say the same for all pizza.

2012-07-29,3.0,"I went to Pequod's pizza because I like unique restaurants and I heard about the caramelized crust. We walked into a dimly lit room very reminiscent of a bar. I have tried many different deep dish places during my stay in Chicago and have to admit that Pequod's is unique. We got a deep dish with peppers and pineapples (goes against the cardinal rule of getting sausage or pepperoni with pizza, but I hadn't seen pineapple offered in deep dish before). It was very pleasant, but not typical deep dish pizza. It was much lighter than most pizzas. There wasn't that much cheese, in all honesty. The crust made up a lions share of the pizza. The cheese was not much more than you would get at a typical carry out pizza place (like Papa Johns) and the toppings were clearly added as an afterthought rather than being cooked in (maybe the pineapple wouldn't have done well to be baked for so long, but I was kind of disappointed). The caramelized crust had a slightly unique taste, but it was an aftertaste rather than an overpowering flavor (honestly, not worth going just for the crust). Maybe I got an off day, but I wasn't overly impressed. It was pleasant and I felt much better than I normally do after eating deep dish, but this is because they seem to skimp on cheese. If you are dieting or don't want to feel bloated, this could be a good deep dish place for you. The service was fine and the place was clean. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. I've certainly had worse and had better.",0.9791,0.786,0.148,0.066,0.5834620334620336

A bold and ballsy statement to make, I know, but there is no other place I'd turn to (except maybe Burt's Place in Morton Grove) for true, fresh, and delicious Chicago deep dish pizza. I came here last night for a work outing with nine other people, and Pequod's was extremely accommodating and attentive to our party. Our drinks were never empty and they were quick to take our order and brought the food out promptly after the excruciatingly long wait of 45 minutes for the pizza to bake. The pizza: The pizza here is always consistent and I've never experienced any flukes with their pizza. What makes this pizza so much better than Lou's, Unos, or Giordanos is their caramelized crust. Sure, it sounds weird, but trust me, it's what seals the deal with this pizza. It'll turn any non-crust eater into a believer. They offer a range of different toppings and you can build your own creations. Last night we went with one sausage, one pepperoni, and one ""supreme"" that had mushrooms, peppers, onions, sausage, pepperoni, and black olives. The supreme pizza was annihilated in a matter of minutes, which I chalked up to be due to the extremely fresh and plentiful ingredients that they pile on. I feel that it's worth mentioning that their sausage here isn't the disgusting ""sausage patty"" that lines the pizza, much like what they do at other pizza places. It's real sausage that is in silver dollar sized pieces sprinkled over the pizza. The atmosphere: Kind of loud and typical of any pizza joint. They have two floors so the restaurant is a lot bigger than it appears from the street. The service: They were attentive and fast, as I previously mentioned, but they weren't all that friendly. If anything there is room for improvement here. If you haven't been to Pequods, it's definitely worth checking out to get a taste of their unique take on the crust. Also, it's rarely ever ""packed"" and you won't face a 1-3 hour wait like many of the other pizza places in town.

But I DO know that after Lou Malnati's was surprisingly closed due to renovations (their loss), Pequod's easily picked up where Lou's left off. Thank you very much. We started with an order of garlic bread. Nothing special, but after our long search it tasted quite good. For our pizza, we stuck with a classic cheese deep dish and it was definitely worth the search. It was everything I'd hoped a Chicago-style pizza would be. Deliciously cheesy with a tangy sauce and crispy crust in all the right places. So so good.  After our long walk through random neighborhoods with only an iphone to guide us, I was also surprisingly pleased with the ambiance of the place. Super casual and a bit dark inside. Exactly how a Chicago pizzeria should be. The booths were a little dirty and beat up, but in a good, gritty, Chicago-ish way. Perfect for delving into a pan full of cheese. I really would love to come back again soon...if only we weren't so damn far away.",0.9955,0.711,0.259,0.03,0.5300563909774436

They serve alcohol, but I really was more famished than thirsty.  And this restaurant did the right thing, by making their authentic Chicago deep dish pie.  Oh by the way, Lou Malnati's is too generic, especially that I saw that it's all over Chicago.  I am a huge supporter of the small stores that make a huge impression on their food and attitude because that's what you need to survive in the food industry.   Give this place a shot, you will not regret it.  My husband and I surely don't.  We know pizza, we are from NYC----land of Italian restuarant...need I say more.",0.9853,0.861,0.139,0.0,0.4508320532514082
2012-06-10,5.0,"When my fiance and I first started dating, we realized that we very strongly disagreed on the best pizza in the city. We decided on a ""Chicago Deep Dish Pizza Challenge."" My favorite was Lou Malnati's, and my fiance's was Pequod's. We went to both pizzerias and compared our sausage pizzas. The result: Pequod's is hands down the best deep dish pizza in Chicago.  In fact - my fiance and I are having our Rehearsal Dinner at Pequod's next May. We were able to rent out the back room, and for a VERY affordable price, have all you can eat pizza and beer/pop for about 50 guests. Pequod's is the best pizza in Chicago, hands down. The crust is carmelized which sets it apart from the competition. The sauce and cheese is fantastic as well. I've had just about every combination of pizzas (sausage, pepperoni, veggie, extra cheese), and I've never been let down. Pequod's also has a decent beer selection and for a good price. The appetizers are good as well (mozzarella sticks!), but I highly recommend not ordering any since the pizza is so good and worth the wait. Pequod's also has carry out and delivery. The atmosphere is very casual and a great place for families, date night, or a night out with a few friends. The wait can get long, but you can put your pizza order in while you wait. I would recommend calling ahead for reservations, especially on a Friday/Saturday night. The service is great - everyone there has a smile on their face even when it is crazy busy.

2012-06-05,4.0,"Very good deep dish pizza. Different than some of the others (e.g., Lou Malnati's) in that its thickness is due largely to its crust rather than being stuffed with massive amounts of cheese. I didn't feel quite as sickly full eating Peqoud's as I did eating at other famous deep dish pizza places. And, despite the thick crust, Peqoud's avoids the taste and texture of pan pizzas. Not sure how they do it. I did miss that extra cheese a little bit, but overall a great option for someone who wants deep dish pizza but does not wish to endure the typical 5 hour food coma that generally follows a Chicago-style pizza experience.",0.7059,0.87,0.082,0.048,0.48202191987906273

Here are some useful tips:  Pequod's pizza is VERY doughy. I liked this but my friends did not. Lots of bread every bight and not very much cheese and little sauce. Big sausage chunks that lacked flavor compared to the sausage LAYER on Lou Malnati's pizza.  Giordano's is much cheesier and saucy. So delicious. Definitely far superior to Pequod's.  Gino's East is all about the crust and depends on the eater. I am a fan but I know many are not.  Lou Malnati's is just crack. So addictive and delicous. To be honest, it's been so long since I've had it and writing this review has prompted me to order Lou's asap. In addition, I didn't get the ""carmelized crust"" that everyone was talking about. My crust was charred and black. If by carmelized, they mean burnt, then yes, I got this. It was not appetizing and I cut it off and threw it into the garbage.

They were filled with cheddar cheese, and although I prefer the cream cheese jalepeno poppers, these were hot and cheesy and fried and really, what more could you ask for? Our spinach and garlic deep dish arrived about 45 minutes later. We decided to go with spinach and garlic to compare it to Giordano's, whose spinach and garlic pizza is out of this world. This pizza was also excellent. The actual cheesy-garlicky-spinach part of the pizza probably wasn't as good as giardano's because the amount of toppings was kind of weak, but this is not to say that it was bad.

2012-04-16,3.0,"Okay, let's just go ahead and put this out there. The best part about pizza is eating the leftovers the next day. Especially deep dish, because its had time to settle and become somewhat manageable with just my hands, which is another important part of my pizza eating. I have to admit, Pequods is my favorite deep dish in the city when I have time to go there and sit down to eat it fresh! The sauce is delicious, and everything just tastes like its had a little more care put into it than some of those over-touristy locations downtown.  However, they tend to have a much thicker crust on the bottom than most places, and I just dont like Pequods as much the next day. It ends up tasting too much like a loaf of bread, with a bit of sauce and cheese on top. If I'm going to put in double time at the gym just to enjoy a slice or two, then I want toppings! Lots of sauce and cheese! I mean...if you're going to indulge, we may as well go all out, and bread just doesnt do it for me. They were quick to deliver  for deep dish(45 min) but I prefer dining in. Also, something about all of the salads I have tasted has been a little off. Maybe its the fat-free italian that I dont care for. Who needs salad when you have pizza, though? Definitely give it a try though, maybe its just me and my weird feelings on deep dish.",0.9753,0.858,0.134,0.008,0.45144032921810706

The crust is unusually crisp for this style, and the caramelized edges give their pies a delicious, deep flavor that I love.  Eating at this place can be a nightmare, though. First - if you have anywhere else you're thinking of going on a weekend, go there instead. The dining room is a shit show of bitchy 20-something staff and customers trying to edge their way into the bar for most of the evening on the weekends that's really not worth bothering with. If you're a grown up, do not go here on a weekend night.  Also, they will tell you that they take reservations - do not believe it. This is basically a college pizza place, they do not have the ability to actually reserve a time, or if they do they will ignore you anyway for anyone who got their pager from the host desk before you. Again, for emphasis - DO NOT BELIEVE THEM WHEN THEY SAY THEY TAKE RESERVATIONS. TL;DR - Go for the pizza, but take it for carry out.",0.108,0.907,0.045,0.048,0.5136363636363636

We got there pretty early on a Saturday night, around 5:45, so we had no trouble getting seated, and it was just 2 of us, so they sat us in a little booth against the wall.Took our drink order and they had one of my favorite IPAs (half acre daisy cutter), so I was happy as a clam. Not to mention I was absolutely famished, so I could not wait for our pizza to arrive. And arrive it did...eventually. Like 1.5 hours later. Basically, the story goes that they accidentally served our pizza to another table. They actually cut it up and serve the pizza on plates, so I guess the other table did not realize it was the wrong pizza until it was served up, at which point they could not give it to us. So, they said they would give us 50% off of our pizza...gee, thanks? 50% off of a $10 pizza? Wow, so glad we saved $5. Well, at least that's what was going through my head. BUT, thank god they redeemed themselves and gave us 50% off the small price pizza but actually gave us a large. Which was, in my opinion, a much better deal and much more worthy of the inconvenience we had to sit through. Because.... We were on our way to see Hunger Games and I absolutely hate being late to movies. They made it work though and it was all good. They even stored our left overs for us so we could go to the movies and then pick it up on our way home. I subtracted a star because of the wait, but they made up for it, and I would not hesitate to come back here.

The sauce was thick, but tasty (where have i heard that before? kidding, kidding). My buddy didn't think it was tomato-y enough, but I thought it was pretty good. The only gripe I have about the pizza was that the spinach did not mix well in there. It made my mouth feel weird from the texture of the spinach, so I would recommend not getting the spinach in the thin crust.  We also ordered some chicken wings. It was not that great.

The best you could do is one pitcher of beer for a party of 10 people?? Pathetic.

2012-02-28,1.0,I am a firm believer that dinning at a restaurant is more than about just the food. It is an experience and for that I am giving Pequod's a bad review. The food itself was good although certainly not the best pizza in Chicago. The reason I probably will never go back was the service. I arrived at this establishment on Saturday night and as expected there was a line. I asked for the wait time and was told 45 minutes. That's a long time but this restaurant's notoriety preceded it and I was willing to wait and wait I did. After an hour I asked approximately how much longer the wait would be and I was told 15-20 minutes. Feeling very discontent but understanding that the majority of the laborious task of waiting was already completed I opted to stay. Wait...Wait...Wait...I ended up waiting for almost two hours. Was the host appoligetic? No. Was the owner? No. Did the waitress blame us when our pizza which we had preordered was late? YES! It's unfortunate that I had such a bad experience as I had heard a lot about this restaurant and it was a letdown to be so disappointed.  There's better pizza and service out there. Don't settle for Pequod's.,-0.935,0.8,0.072,0.128,0.5107769423558897

2012-01-03,3.0,"Providing a star rating for Pequod's is tough. I've had some great pizzas here and some disappointing ones. For the good pizzas, I would give it four stars, but for the disappointing ones, I would give it three stars. In the past year, I have had more disappointing visits than positive ones, so I must rate accordingly. However, my last visit was a good one and I'm hoping they're back on track so I can change the rating soon. The caramelized crust is a must-try, if they're on good run. I recommend adding garlic to your pizza for some extra flavor, especially if they're on a bad run. When it's bad, you need the extra flavor. I don't recommend the thin-crust, as the crust is not caramelized and doesn't have much flavor. The pan at least always has a charred crust, and on good days it's caramelized. I appreciate the local-leaning draft beer selection, although I wish they varied their Half Acre option more frequently, as it's usually the heavier Over Ale. With a pan pizza, I would prefer a lighter ale like the Gossamer. The appetizer options are pretty standard for a pizza place, but are not especially good. Overall, if Pequod's is on a good run, it's great pizza. These past two years, they have been a little off, but maybe they're heading into a good season based on my last visit.

Appeteizer: We got the pizza bread. Do you know what ELIOs pizza is? If you don't, its the one that comes in a box and is almost always on sale at every grocery store. The pizza bread here was along those lines. I think i prefer elios, that way i know how much i want to melt my cheese, or how crispy i want it. Or if im feeling fancy, i may put it in the oven. The pizza bread here  didnt taste good at all. The cheese was not melted right and the bread tasted old. 1 Star. Pizza: It was AVERAGE. The dough was nice and hot, it was okay, and i enjoyed the fact that the pizza had multiple layers of cheese and dough. The sauce tasted like it came right out of the can and the dough was kinda bland. But the very end of the pizza, the crust....  CARAMELIZED CRUST-the saving grace of this pizza. The carameilized crust was PHENOMENAL and if they made the entire pizza dough with that taste, i would be in heaven. They need to sell the crust and make it an appitizer on its own, with some melted cheese , semi burning. YUM. So, i wont be returning for the pizza. Service: crappy. The waitress never came around to fill our waters. There was one obnoxious server who kept laughing like a hyena and it was really annoying. All the servers were just chillin by the bar serving their own. IDK, didnt like it. She finally came around to fill our water when the pizza came. Overall: OVERHYPED PLACE.

Service: The place was packed, but when I made my way to the order desk, they had several people on hand to assist.

I was tempted on the ride home to take a bite, but I resisted. When I took a bite at home, I was speechless.

It's not the stuffed or deep dish variety that other Chicago joints serve up and I like it that way. Burnt, camalized edges and crispy pepperoni with just enough cheese to hold up to the delicious crust underneath. The atmosphere is inviting with exposed brick walls and a dimly-lit bar room setting. There are booths for two and those that offer more seating as well as tables and stools around the bar.  The staff is very friendly and seem to enjoy working together which is nice, as most places I venture into...it seems service is lacking. The waitress I had around lunch hour greeted me quickly and took my order... had my beverage out just as fast and asked how I was doing. The manager on duty also came by to ensure all was OK. They offer a great lunch special. A personal pan pizza and cola or Miller Light pint for $4.95. This is unbeatable. Expect to wait about 20 minutes for your pie to cook. It'sworth it even if you are sitting alone guzzling a pint of Miller Light in the middle of the afternoon. The overall experience here is enjoyable.

2011-10-22,5.0,"After seeing too many Food Network / Cooking Channel / Travel Channel shows featuring the competition of Chicago-style deep dish pizzas at Pizzeria Uno and Lou Malnati's, my girlfriend and I decided that we should engage in the discussion as well and visit both locations.  We agreed that we would get one fried appetizer dish, one medium deep-dish pepperoni pizza, and soda. (Dessert only if we felt we could truly handle it.) So here's the experience at Pequod's Pizzeria (our third stop of the two): That's right, we were convinced to add a 3rd contender to our ultimate deep-dish competition.  Who convinced us?  Food Network magazine.  They had a special in a recent issue about the best pizza in every state, and we jumped to Illinois to find out if Food Network chose Uno or Lou, and we read that...  what the heck is a ""Pequod's Pizzeria""?? We hit the 'net, and found out that on my two recent trips up to Webster to hit up Barnes & Noble and the awesomeness of Five Guys, I was walking RIGHT PAST this place. Well at about 4:30pm on a Sunday, we changed all that and entered the building for supposedly the best deep-dish 'zza Chicago has to offer, complete with caramelized cheese on the crust for that extra-savory flavor. Well, we got ourselves a seat and thumbed through the menu for our fried appetizer.  Boom!  Appetizer Combo: sign us up! After Lou Malnati's, my girlfriend had finally come to terms with fried zucchini, and these slices o' veggie were quite good.  She enjoyed the mozz sticks, since I'm the only fried mushroom fan.  They were quite tasty as well.  Poppers on an appetizer platter is just icing on the cake - good choice, Pequod's! And with proper timing, our pizza arrived.  Now THIS was the kind of deep-dish pepperoni pizza I was expecting.  The pepperoni had a great flavor and lovely crispiness to them.  The sauce was a FREAKIN' SAUCE!  Barely any chunks of tomato to be found!  I was in heaven!  And then the crust, with the caramelized cheese (which is a very fancy term for ""we just throw some extra cheese on the crust so it gets burnty/crunchy in the oven"") really does make all the difference, especially with the level of butter you can tell went into the dough. My only qualm with the pizza was the ratio of dough to everything-else-that-isn't-dough on the pizza.  I enjoy a really hearty and thick slice of pizza when I go for deep dish, but the thickness of the bottom dough/crust was getting to me after the second slice.  I couldn't even finish the third slice, which is frankly an embarrassment for a man of my rotund stature.  All that remained of the third slice was a mound of crust and dough with the flesh and sauce stripped off and consumed. Yet another round of deep-dish-pizza hilarity that would not allow room for a dessert. But before I leave you with the score, I have to mention the ""unique"" atmosphere of this place. Pequod's Pizzeria is, in my opinion, an Inside Joke.  The kind where somebody at the table says something that makes no sense to you, but everyone around you is snickering or cracking up and tells you that ""you just had to be here"" or ""it's a Jersey thing"" or some other excuse as to why you won't understand the joke.  That's how it felt here.  And at the center of it all is a mascot whale with a pair of panties on its head, just staring you in the face and DARING you to ""get the joke"".  And I didn't.  The metaphor extended to the waitstaff, who seemed to be enjoying conversations with each other more than with the patrons of the establishment.  I would NOT  say that we had bad service.  Not at all.  But after refilling our soda, our server would hang out at the bar with the bartender or the register with some other staff, making comments to each other and yukking it up in general. (There's also a mysterious second floor, which I believe it just extra seating.  I was intrigued, but grateful to be on the first floor and not having to entertain the thought of navigating steps with a tummy full of doughy, cheesy 'zza.) Near the end of the meal, I just had to try and get an explanation.  I pulled our server over and just flat-out asked, ""So why is the mascot a whale with a pair of panties on its head?"" ""I don't really know - I think it was created by the owner or something.  But it's pretty cool, I think."" Well, maybe the Inside Joke is just the simple fact that you're not able to know why the punchline is funny.  I agree it's kind of a humorous idea of putting panties on the head of a whale, but they would either have to be unthinkably-large panties or an unthinkably-small whale.  I still don't get it... But what I do get is that it's no joke that Food Network magazine made the right choice, because Pequod's Pizzaria hand-down beat out both Lou Malnati's and Pizzeria Uno in our deep-dish pizza competition.",0.9936,0.875,0.095,0.029,0.49611344537815116

2011-09-20,5.0,"Third time's a charm. After trying and being disappointed with two of Chicago's most famous pizza establishments -- Lou Malnati's and Giordano's -- I was beginning to think that a ""to-die-for Chicago-style deep-dish pizza"" was on the same level as the tooth fairy, the Easter bunny and Santa Claus...myth. Pequod's changed all that. Upon arriving we placed our names on the wait list, grabbed a menu and took a seat at one of the four benches outside of the restaurant. We decided on the large (14"") pan pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms. After about 20 minutes our party was called, we were taken through the first floor of the restaurant, up the stairs and into the massive second level. Once seated we were given menus for a second time to see if we wanted to add appetizers, salads, etc. We decided on the Pequod Salad for our party of four with their homemade Italian dressing. The Pequod Salad came out a few minutes later -- Romaine lettuce with mozzarella cheese, peperoni, pepperoncini, black olives, green peppers, mushrooms, carrots, tomato and onion. Definitely a good choice. It was the perfect size for us to split. They didn't skimp on the toppings. And, the homemade Italian dressing as suggested by our server was delicious. As good as it was, you don't go to a place like Pequod's for the salad. A few minutes our pizza arrived -- 154 square inches (yes, I used an online calculator) of piping-hot pizza goodness. To save us from burning ourselves and making a mess of of the pizza, the server plated the first half of the pizza for us, using the square spatula to pick up the pizza and cut off the strings of melted cheese crawling from the pan onto our plates. Now the toppings on the pizza were, for the most part, comparable to both Lou Malnati's and Giordano's -- loads of pepperoni, thinly sliced mushrooms crisped by the oven, thick homemade tomato sauce and bubbling cheese. The difference, however, was found in the crust. At Lou Malnati's and Giordano's, the crust was too bready and even soggy because of all the sauce. But crust at Pequod's was heaven. They call it their ""famous caramelized crust"", an apt description. The crust was the perfect balance of buttery, chewy, crunchy, crispy, slightly-burned goodness. And at the edges, the cheese had melted to the side of the crust/pan to form a ""halo"" (their word, not mine) of caramelized cheesy/crusty deliciousness. In the end, that crust and that ""halo"" single-handedly saved Chicago's reputation for having a ""to-die-for deep-dish pizza."" For that all Chicago natives should be thankful. And, they should show their thankfulness by going to Pequod's. That's where we'll be next time we visit the Windy City.",0.9929,0.872,0.113,0.016,0.43188244047619045

A Large cheese starts at 15.99 and toppings are a bit steep at $2.50 each.  After a decent wait it came, caramelized cheese at the ends, sauce on top and laden with cheese and toppings. What impressed me was the use of spinach as a moisture barrier between the crust and the sauce and cheese.

Once seated, we started out with the Appetizer Combo which was a bunch of fried things like mozzarella sticks, zucchini, poppers and mushrooms.  It was ok.  Fried is fried.  You can't really do a terrible job at frying things.  I was ready for the pizza. We had the pan pizza with onions and pepperoni.  The pizza is baked in cast iron pans blackened by decades of seasoning and the overflowing cheese emerges from the oven as a halo of caramelized crust.  If that doesn't sound good to you, what does?  This is not a pizza for the faint of heart.  Deep dish is heavy and we didn't see anyone leaving the restaurant without a to go bag.  We ended up taking a good portion home and I had a slice 2 days later.  Still tasted really good. There are a ton of pizza shops in Chicago.  Everyone has a favorite.  If I lived here I can see Pequod's being a favorite for years and years.",0.9759,0.848,0.12,0.032,0.62625

We were limited in what we could order because we only had 30 minutes, and their pan pizzas take 30 minutes to bak. We got a thin crust pepperoni pizza that I thought was delicious! I prefer thin crust personally, but if we weren't so rushed I probably would have played around with the toppings a bit more. When we arrived it wasn't overly packed, but by about 6:30 there was a bit of a wait for a table. It seems like a really fun atmosphere. It's small and the furniture is old and dated like it hasn't been changed for 20 years.

However, an odd occurrence took place when I ate at Pequod's. Even with more than 4 glasses of wines swishing around inside of me, I did not find Pequod's version of deep dish pizza worthy of my palate.  All you lovers of this faux deep dish can get mad if you want. I don't like it. I don't like the thin flavorless sauce, the way the toppings seem to be lackadaisically thrown into a heap atop of it all (Ingredients are supposed to be inside of a deep dish. In.... Side.), or the cheese. The crust; let's talk about it. At first, when I shared my underwhelment (I made it up) of this pizza, I was told I should have had the caramelized crust. Upon checking with my friend who brought me here, I learned that I, indeed, had had the caramelized crust. Caramelized, seared, lightly whipped.... whatever the crust has to be in order to taste good, it is not.  If a pizza tastes like this to me after that much wine, and while seriously hungry, I'd hate to consume it while sober. This is a transplant's deep dish, in my opinion.

The sausage may have changed a little bit when Burt sold the place. It's got a little more spice. It's seems more like an italian sausage than a more mild sausage that is signature at Burt's and other deep-dish main-stays in chicago. The restaurant has a good beer-selection-- not the best in Lincoln Park, but they have plenty of Micro-brews. The Clybourne location also has a second level so you're not going to wait long on the weekend. The main floor has plenty of TVs and has a nice renovated interior.

Usually you enjoy one or two aspects of a pizza. At Pequod's, every element is the best you will ever eat, and combining all these flavors left me moaning with delight. . . the gooey, stringy cheese; the carmelized crust; the sweet, spicy sausage; the fresh meaty mushrooms. The tomato sauce was so good, I asked the waitress if I could buy a jar (no). My half of the 10-inch deep dish pizza was a little too much food for me, but I ate it all anyway, knowing that until we return to Chicago I will never experience another meal like this.

2011-06-20,5.0,"A place with over 800 reviews doesn't need mine. But I'm gonna anyway, because Pequod's is part of why Chicago is awesome (to me). You know how some people get hung up on ex-boyfriends or ex-girlfriends? They remember past relationships so fondly that every relationship from then on gets compared to that ""one."" Yeah. That's pretty much how I feel about Pequod's. This was the first deep dish pizza I had when I moved to Chicago a year ago and it might as well have been the only deep dish pizza I've had. Sure, I've come across others during my time here, but nothing compares (cue Sinead O'Connor's bald head here). Sure, the atmosphere is very Chicago sports bar-y, but you'll forget all about that when that tomatoey, cheesy, and whatever other toppings-y slice hits your taste buds. I don't know how they do it, but the caramelized crust is perfectly cheesy, crunchy, but chewy at the same time. I could seriously eat an entire pizza, of just caramelized crust. I don't know what that would look like, but I don't care, I want it in my belly. As for the rest of the pizza, they don't hold back on the toppings, and you'll eat until you're painfully full, but still want to eat more. It's just that good.  The pizza, beer, and service is great, and even though this is such a popular pizza spot, they've maintained a hometown, local feel, which I love. So play roulette with the topping choices, they're all pretty dang delicious. Just eat here, and get hung up on their pizza like I am.",0.9931,0.759,0.192,0.049,0.6018849206349206

2011-06-07,5.0,"Wow.  Just wow. Seriously, that's all I could think of as I was eating the beautiful creation in front of us.  The pizza is just... awesomeness.  I've had good deep dish and one of my favorite restaurant in LA has a great deep dish, so I had really high expectations going in to Pequod's. We were able to make a reservation for 7:30pm on a Saturday night and right when you get in, you can tell Pequod's the sort of neighborhood spot where on weekdays locals will come and watch them game while grabbing a bite and drinks.  The whole feel of the place is that even though Pequod's can be filled with tourists (like me), it is still a local spot, which I like. After a long hard look, decided to go with the deep dish with sausage, pepperoni, spinach, mushroom, garlic, and fresh basil.  First of all, that caramelized cheese crust, which gives the edges of the pizza a darkened crust, is just fantastic.  That crunchy crust is straight up addicting.  Forget all the stuffed crust and the whatever-crust-Pizza-Hut is coming out with now.  The cast iron pan is super well-seasoned, which differentiate the thick crust from being just bread.  As for the toppings, it's all to everyone's own personal choice but we loved the sausages.  Great huge chunks of sausage that goes so well with the delicious sauces and cheese.  We liked how there was lots of sauce, and you even have the option of going extra on the sauces!  The pepperoni was good and there's lots of it underneath all the cheese.  Definitely try to add some veggies though cause, especially spinach cause it fits perfectly.  Also helps to serve to refresh your palate mid-bite :P  The pizza did take awhile, so we decided to get an order of onion rings.  Just your typical onion rings, served with BBQ sauce. They also have a pretty good selection of beers on draft.  Decided to go with a local brew and the Goose Island 312 is a nice beer with the pizza since it has a nice citrus note.  Good change. The pizza did take awhile but trust, definitely worth the wait.  Is it the best deep dish?  It may just be.  All I can say that by completely stuffing myself after 2 and a half slices of the large and 2 beers, I still want more.  In fact, I was feeling sad knowing that as soon as I leave Chi-Town, I wouldn't be able to have it anymore.  Sigh.

We ended up getting a table on the second floor and each ordered our own small pizza. I had spinach and he ordered sausage.  I'm a HUGE fan of Giordano's and this pizza was different from theirs, but different doesn't mean bad. Basically, there was less cheese, more sauce. A good amount of spinach, although I feel there could have been more, but I don't know that most people love spinach as much as I do. The most interesting thing about the pizza is the carmelized crust, which makes the crust worth eating if you're not normally a fan of the crust. My friend was figuring that he could finish off the small pizza, but that didn't happen. It's definitely more filling than it appears to be. We could have shared one pizza and finished it (if only we could have agreed on a vegetarian one!) but instead, we both ended up taking home leftovers. I had my leftovers two days later and it was almost as yummy as the night we had the pizza in the restaurant.

Pequod's has a sports bar atmosphere, a natural fit in a sporty town like Chicago, but its clear that on ""game night"" this place is going to be packed. Its a relatively small bar/restaurant, with short little booths made for two, and barstool flanked tables surrounded by Chicago sports memorabilia and flat-screen TVs.  We kept it simple: soda, salad, sausage-spinach-mushroom deep dish pie. Our server brought our drinks and salads quickly; service here is brisk and friendly. The house salad was simple - chopped lettuce, sliced black olives, a slice of tomato, shredded carrots, all dressings on the side. Comforting in its simplicity.  Our pizza took another 20-25 minutes, pretty standard for a deep dish place. I was hesitant about getting deep dish because I can't stand the typical heavy, buttery, pastry-dough crusts that so many Chicago-style places employ. When it came out, I saw that the cheese had oozed out onto the sides of the well-seasoned cast iron skillet, and I was briefly debating how greasy everything was going to be. But yessss...I was extremely pleasantly surprised at the lightness of the crust on Pequod's pizza! How Pequod's can take a thick layer of tangy, crunchy-on-the-bottom but light-on-the-inside crust, smother it with cheese, bright tomato sauce, and fresh spinach, herby golfball sized chunks of sausage, and fresh mushrooms and have it NOT be a belly bomb is kind of a pizza miracle. I ate two slices of medium-sized pie and felt full without that greaseball quesiness I get from just one slice of ""the other guys"" stuff. This just might be the best deep dish I've had in Chicago.

2011-04-16,5.0,"The caramelized crust is a layer of burnt cheese around the edges of the pie and provides an amazing, unforgettable flavor (think of burnt cheese on baked ziti) with a crunchy/chewy texture.  The crust (dough part) itself is buttery, slightly chewy, but also a bit crunchy.  Delicious.  Additionally, this deep dish pie provides a better balance of cheese and toppings to crust - about 60/40 crust to topping, which is different from the normal 30/70 crust to topping ratio you see at other places.  In short, tasty and filling, but not overwhelming. I like this place better than Lou Malnati's, Giordano's, and Gino's East.  Definitely a must try if you are in the market for an amazing deep dish pie.

This review is a one time only deal and here's why. If you go into the place to eat (which I'm NOT recommending) sit wherever you can squeeze in, don't ask a lot of questions, keep your head down and don't make a lot of eye contact. The ambiance and staff are a suck fest. There I said it.  But the pizza is sooo good! The deep dish is out of this world. Talk about an indulgence. The dough is not just dough it's like buttery, crispy, yet slightly chewy dough heaven. The sauce, garlicky, basily, ripe tomato and perfectly seasoned amazing. Toppings and cheese all pile on nicely, all together it's like magic in your mouth. Then you get to the crust. Which has caramelized cheese baked on it. O.M.G.- I mean it, that's the first thing you'll say after you've bitten into what might be your own personal island of pizza paradise! ! If you're in their delivery area, lucky you. Otherwise take it to go. It'll be the most expensive (not like a $100 bucks or anything, but a loaded medium deep dish is like $35 dollars, wtf?), but the most tasty deep dish you will ever have, I promise.",0.9652,0.868,0.117,0.015,0.6436237373737375

It makes my mouth water just thinking about it. You MUST order the sausage pizza. I'm not usually a sausage kind of gal (The kind made from pork! Get your minds out of the gutter!), but Pequod's has converted me with their pepper-y, flavorful, the-other-white-meat goodness. We also ordered a pepperoni and green pepper pizza (a.k.a. the best pizza topping combination of all time). It was the perfect meat-to-veggie ratio, and the peppers me feel like I was being healthy despite the 1,000,000 grams of carbs I inhaled without a second thought. 2 pieces will be plenty per person, but leftovers are encouraged because you will not be able to stop thinking about it by lunch the next day and will want more.

Before my ex took me here two years ago (whomp whomp), I was loathe to let a piece of pan cross my lips. I mean what was the point? It wasn't thin, foldy and greasy and it sure as shit wasn't stuffed!!! (Still my absolute fave.) My mentality was save myself the calories and walk down the street to Art of Pizza.  But much like Sarah Palin, Pequods is a game-changer. Maybe its the sauce, maybe its the memories or maybe its the carmelized cheese burnt right into the deliciously buttery crust (impossible to leave it on the plate). Pequods is good for take-out, delivery, a Hawks game or the non-cinematic half of a dinner-movie combo (the Webster theater is right across the street.)

My one and only visit to Pequod's actually happened on a whim after the initial plan of the evening, a visit to Wilde, was abortive due to zero parking available in Lakeview.  Since we're both trying to do something right as good little Catholics by not eating meat on Fridays during Lent, the backup plan in my hip pocket of cheese pizza at Pequod's came into play. We passed under the ugly blue marquee and entered a packed pizzeria on a Friday night.  We were quoted ten minutes, so we took a seat at the bar and enjoyed a pint.  Not two minutes later, our name was called and off we went.  I figured we were getting the table next to the bar that was just vacated.  Wrong.  We were led upstairs, past the first room and way back to the room for the little kiddies all the way back in the corner.  Who knew the place was so huge?  I really didn't care for where we were seated, but, again, food is paramount. We ordered a large pan pizza (cheese only, yawn), mozzarella sticks and a bowl of tomato bisque.  The soup was only okay.  It was too thick and cheesy.  The mozzarella sticks were mozzarella sticks.  We had to get something for an appetizer though, as I'd already made poor little starving K-Mac wait long enough.  We only ended up eating one slice of the pizza apiece.   As far as the pizza goes (that's all that really matters), it was pretty decent.  I'd put it on a par with places like Lou's and Gino's, quite honestly.  I'm more of a thin crust guy than a deep dish guy.  The carmelized crust is quite lovely.  But it all just tends to blow up in my stomach.   Also, it's remarkable that a Pequod's pan pizza is at its best in the restaurant and hot.  I took home four huge slices and made my way through them in about 48 hours' time.  This pizza does not translate in a cold iteration.  It actually doesn't translate in a reheated iteration very well either.  And the air in the dough again just blows up in my stomach.  My thin crust Aurelio's will always be my top lover as far as pizza goes. Pequod's is three stars.  It's alright.  But it's not great.",0.9884,0.807,0.128,0.066,0.5325585149313964

I'd need reinforcements for this excursion. My buddy that just relocated to the area met up with Kris and I for our afternoon feast. No waiting to be seated and we had a nice booth in the corner. Based on a little Yelping research I knew deep dish was the thing to get here. Great taps of seasonal brews from Half Acre, Sam Adams and New Belgium. We put together an order while we got started on pitcher one of NB's 2 Below. Spinach, mushroom, garlic, extra sauce and light cheese for the lady. Sausage, pepperoni, garlic and extra sauce for the gents. It would look kind of odd if Kris and I both got our own pies, so I'm glad my buddy solved that problem for us.  About the time we moved onto our second pitcher, the dude showed up struggling to hold our pizzas. Right here dude! These things clunked down on the table like they were Grandma's old cast iron skillet. They smelled fantastic for starters, that would be the garlic. We wasted no time tackling these pies. It's a little thick for my taste (that's what she said) which is why you'll want to go with extra sauce. The sauce is tangy and a bit spicy, but not sweet at all. I liked the charred cheese around the rim of the crust. That's a nice touch that added another level of flavor. The garlic and pepperoni kicked in with some spiciness and the big chunks of fenneled sausage were tasty. Pretty damn good. I liked this one better than the veggie, but they were both great. Our beer and za gluttony hit Thanksgiving levels as we caught up and the brew flowed on to the third pitcher. Things were not expensive at all. I think our pies were $25 even with all the toppings and the pitchers were about $17. That's a steal that we'll surely take advantage of again. I also liked that they had all the accompaniments of red pepper, grated cheese and herbs on the table already.  I had an excellent afternoon buzz by the time we left and had such a great time that I halted the cab dead in it's tracks when I realized I had forgotten our leftovers at Pequod's.

The overflowing cheese emerges from the oven as a halo of caramelized crust.""  - Pequods Okay, Pequods, your prose is worthy of your namesake Melville. In fact, ""a halo of caramelized crust"" is almost poetic. But tell me this:  WHY IS THE WHALE WEARING A THONG ON HIS HEAD?  The possibly obscene answer to this riddle went unexplained, none of the waitstaff knew the reason. When you walk in, you see the neon sign with the whale and this pink thing, figure it must be the whale is eating a slice of pizza. Then on the poster inside, looks kind of different... is this some species of whale with unusual natural markings on its head? No, turns out that it's a thong. There must still be someone around from the good old days who knows the origin of the story.  This place is classic Chicago, has been in business since 1970. Actually it's partly a sports bar, with TV's showing all of the local sports games, especially the Blackhawks.  Beers on tap included Sam Adams, Goose Island, Half Acre, and Stella Artois. Served cold, cold, cold, in chilled glasses. They have big neon signs of all of the major breweries, as well as lots of signs and paraphernalia for the sports teams. And there are some classic movie posters - Cary Grant, A Clockwork Orange, The Shining, etc. Some of the other posters look like enlargements of family photos from the 1970's. There are two levels, the layout is kind of narrow but the second floor adds a lot of space. It's more quiet up there when the ground floor gets bustling, and it has its own bar. Open late.  The menu is simple, the whole thing fits on one side of a laminated card. They have pastas, sandwiches, salads, and appetizers in addition to the pizza. Not cheap but not expensive, either. There are wooden chopping blocks / serving boards on the tables which are cut in the shape of whales.  They really do have their own style of pizza going on at Pequod's, it's not quite like any other Chicago deep-dish. Personally I thought the ""caramelized halo"" was good, they intentionally let the cheese get slightly burned around the edge of the top. The rest of the crust is thick and fluffy. The sauce is rather plain, doesn't have much taste of its own, so recommend adding some ingredients.  Fun and unpretentious place with what most people will agree is good pizza. The style may not be to everyone's liking, you would have to try it to find out, since it's fairly unique. Ladies, beware of whales suddenly surfacing in unexpected places.

Anyway, I still think that the pizza is strangely bland, but I tracked the problem to the sauce, so it makes more sense to me now.  It just needs more seasoning, I think.  Otherwise the pizza is pretty great, especially the crust, which manages to be crispy on the bottom and edges but bready in the middle.  The pizza reheats really well in a conventional oven, which is a rarity. We had an egregiously sullen (and often absentee) waitress.  However, they seemed to do a shift change while we were there, and all of the evening people seemed pleasant enough.  So maybe we just got a bad apple.

Although, perhaps I'm being harsh on Pequod's, because the problem here was one of unmet expectations. We ordered a thin crust pizza, and the waitress followed up with ""Do you want any cheesy garlic breadsticks?"". Caught off guard, we said ""Sure, ok,"" expecting something along the lines of a small breadbasket. We were instead served two long planks of garlic bread, bubbling with cheese, and marinara sauce. And everything was excellent-- good quality cheese, and the sauce! Perfection! So, naturally, we were excited to see what our actual pizza would be like... ...and this is where Pequod's really faltered. The pizza appeared to have nothing in common with our fantastic appetizer-- poorer quality dough, cheese, and appallingly bad sauce. Also, we ordered our pizza with bell peppers, which had been over-cooked-- that's become a pet peeve since that fated Indiana pizza *shudders*, and it could have been worse, but I really prefer them crisp. Again, it wasn't terrible, it just suffered from a lack of melding of the flavors, as though the sauce wasn't in tune with the cheese, which wasn't in tune with anything else. Considering they seem to know what they're doing in the ""bread + cheese + sauce"" department, as evidenced by our appetizer, it must be just sheer perversity that leads them to make such poor quality pizza.

The pizza was awesome.  I agree with others assessments that the amount of cheese is less than some other pan pizza joints, but  I preferred it.  The cheese tasted less rubbery and more gooey goodness.  The sauce was also great with a tinge of sweetness.  Finally, the sausage on top was ample and delicious....

I won't lie and say the pizza sucked.  It didn't.  But it was not as good as it used to be.  The crust was dry and flavorless, and they were cheapskates with the toppings (one piece of sausage on each slice?).  We were stuffed after 2 slices each, and we're not light eaters.

I wanted it all kinds of ways - deep dish, thin crust, it didn't matter. But then I met Pequod's. The kind of pizza place that makes an honest woman out of you.

Because of the bond I feel with Pequod's, I felt confident enough that the pizza would wow my out of town friends and give my Chicago-based friends an alternative to deep dish. Pequod's did not disappoint.

It was extremely hot in the restaurant - I'm guessing that 90 degree temps outside and constantly running pizza ovens aren't helping the case, but I would've appreciated a little extra AC so my white shorts didn't become translucent with sweat. Would I let a little perspiration taint this review? Not hardly. Thankfully our waitress kept the pitchers of beer coming and saved us all from dehydration.

With this being my first deep dish I wasn't prepared for the amount of food I was expected to consume, but according to my BF who grew up in Indiana this deep dish wasn't as thick as the standard (that terrifies me) In all I loved it but I wasn't impressed enough to say it was the best (plus it was my first deep dish, so come on!)

We managed to find this place after a fail attempt looking for hamburgers. My boyfriend said that this place was broadcast on one show on the Food Network, so I was wondering what the hype was. We ordered a side of mozzarella sticks and a small thin crust pizza with a crapload of toppings, which kind of added up to a hefty bill. ($1.50 for extra toppings on a small pizza? Them toppings better be fresh..!) In my mind, I had tried a thin crust pizza from Pizza Hut, and I thought it was like crackers with tomato sauce. This place blew that stereotype AWAY! The crust was flaky, but not too thin that you had to put napkins on your lap to prevent sauce from dripping.

One stuffed with sausage, peppers and basil and one thin with pepperoni, peppers and garlic and we were in business. The stuffed (or is it deep dish; 6+ years and I still don't know) was very enjoyable. The crust was crispy and caramelized (THE deciding factor) and made every bite a race to get to the end. The ingredients were fresh and the crust was just the consistency I like. Usually, I am all about the thin crust. Here, I would (and did) eat both.

But then we ordered delivery in 2009... wow, is this the same pizza?  There is SO MUCH DOUGH and it is dry. The sauce is still tasty, but very thin, and the burnt cheese still rules. But I could hardly eat it because of the dough.  I don't want to have to pick my toppings off a pizza, that is not a good pizza. So, we thought maybe since it was delivery it just wasn't the same or just a fluke one time.  I had a girls movie night last night and they all wanted to order Pequods.  We got 2 pan and 1 thin (since I hadn't tried thin yet).  Me and another friend ended up eating only the top half of our pan pieces and the crust - again - way to much dry dough!  It just isn't cutting it. Maybe they changed the recipe?  The thin was good, but not really thin - I would say it was ""normal"" thickness, and maybe more of what the pan pizza should be, just add the burnt crust to the thin pizza and it would be better I think. Well, that all being said, Pequods went from one of our favorites, to one that we won't be ordering again.  Sad.  I'll miss that big whale with undies on his head!",0.9625,0.842,0.115,0.043,0.56640625

I've ordered in advance to pick up to take back home to the W. Suburbs (try driving 50 miles in rush hour with THAT aroma in the car), brought visiting family here during a very crowded Friday or Saturday, dropped in after a Sox game, it's always been good.  Make no mistake, I have not yet tried the thin crust, only the pan.   Don't go here expecting the original Pizzeria Uno / Ike Sewell / Rudy Malnati deep dish formula from 1943.  You know, the Lou Malnati's formula (my 2nd place).   It's a variation, so I don't know if you can  call it ""deep dish"" in the traditional sense, but ""pan pizza"" fits.  The crust is thicker, there is slightly less cheese, and they don't use a manhole cover of sausage.  And, luckily, there is no cornmeal in the crust.  The sauce is sweeter, resembling sauce from Aurelio's or Chicago Dough Company from down in Richton Park.   The ingredients are always fresh, and the service is always fantastic.  The manager is out there seating people, taking orders, bringing out pizza, checking in on you.  If you go to Pequod's with an open mind and not expecting the traditional formula for deep dish, you will not be disappointed.  It's simply a fun place.",0.9793,0.838,0.125,0.037,0.4693518518518519
2010-01-20,4.0,"I'll start out by saying that I had Pequod's delivery instead of in situ. Hey--it's freakin' cold outside! The pizza arrived warm and still caramelized at the edges, the salad was well-chilled, and the garlic cheese bread arrived toasty. Working from most disappointing to favorite part of the meal, here goes: The garlic cheese bread was cheesy, but at two pieces, it didn't seem like much. I also could not taste any garlic at all. Out in the 'burbs, if you order garlic at most restaurants, you don't have to search for it in the food. Dunno if the city was misnamed a long time ago, but ""place of the wild garlic"" doesn't apply to most restaurants recipes downtown. The Pequod salad was very large (definitely enough for two people to share as a dinner salad). I don't usually like a lot of vegetables, but the dressing was just enough to mostly hide the flavor of the black olives from my tongue.There was plenty of pepperoni on top, and everything blended together well as far as taste. The pizza was tempting looking as it was thick, juicy, and covered with pepperoni as well. Couldn't even see the other ingredients (sausage and garlic). Now this time, Pequods did not disappoint with the garlic. It was visible, and could be tasted too. I would've preferred a little more, as the sauce is a bit sweet. Not too sweet, as some reviews state. The dough was just about the right thickness and consistency for a deep-ish dish pizza, and there was plenty of each of the ingredients. I didn't taste the caramelized edge as I was expecting...maybe it's an acquired taste, but I just didn't see it as a big plus. It added some flavor, but it was just kinda' crunchy and burnt...but then again, I like my toasted marshmallows golden, warm, and gooey, not black and flavorless. To each his own taste! (Or ""Chacun de son gout,"" as the French would say.) All in all, a pretty good place for delivery. I think it would probably be even better brought warm and fresh right to your table from the oven, since the delivery took about an hour in the winter weather.

Walking in the door takes me back to the places I used to frequent in the 70s, like the old My Pie in Rogers Park. Back before pizza became respectable. Then there's the crust. Is it caramelized or is it burnt? They call it caramelized, and I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. Because whatever it is, it's freakin' delicious. You get the same thing in an upscale restaurant, and they call it ""parmesan lace."" It's baked cheese, and it's terrific. The crust is pretty thick, as you would expect from pan pizza, and the toppings are plentiful, if a little erratic. Which is to say, slice one, where's the pepperoni?; slice two, loaded with it. The sauce was nothing special, but everything worked together to create a fine pie. Service was quick and friendly. The best part: they asked if we wanted to put in our order right away, before they had a table for us, so the pizza could get started. Nice touch. But they didn't rush us out at the end.

Not wanting to cook or go out, we decided to order some comfort food. For me, this was nothing fancy - just a plain cheese pizza, well-done. When I opened the box, I saw a round pizza cut into squares, covered in a thick, impenetrable layer of grease. While I can't take points off for the cutting nonsense (save it for the Sicilian pies), I definitely can justify the low rating by saying it was the single most unappetizing pizza I have ever seen. Honestly, did someone pour french fry grease ONTO the pizza? It was nauseating. Because we had no food, after pulling off the cheese and using about a half a roll of paper towels to soak up the remaining grease, I did eat a couple of the squares. It was mediocre. Perhaps it's something I need to get used to, but I like round pizza to come in slices, not squares. I like my pizza to be edible, not soggy and wet. I like my pizza to have a delicious crust, not blackened. Maybe they were having an off night, maybe it was somebody new...but how can a pizza joint not know how to make a plain cheese?

With it's extremely flavorful and high quality ingredients (the sauce and toppings were fantastic), and lighter, less cheese-dominated pizza, Pequod's is definitely among the best deep-dish/pan pizza's I've every had. We ordered our pizza to-go, so I can't speak for the restaurant experience Pequod's offers, but the food was delicious. We ordered both the thin crust (which was more like a regular pie than typical crispy thin crust), as well as the standard pan pizza. While both were good, the pan/deep-dish pie is what really impressed me. I don't exactly recall the toppings we ordered for the thin crust (the pan pizza was THAT good), but we ordered the pan pie with spinach, onion, basil, and garlic, which ended up being an excellent combination. Unlike some of the Chicago deep-dish staples (Giordano's, Lou Malnati's, etc.), Pequod's pan pizza was fairly light on the cheese, which I felt allowed me to better appreciate the other components of the pizza (sauce, toppings, etc.). This also meant I was able to eat more, as the pizza was more bready and not nearly as heavy as that of some of Pequod's competitors. The ingredients seemed very fresh and flavorful, and the caramelized crust was a pleasant change from traditional deep dish as it was enjoyable on its own and also pretty light. The only downside about this place was the price of the pizza. After including the toppings, a medium thin crust and a large pan totaled to about $40. At the end of the day, though, the pizza was probably satisfying enough to justify the extra cost, and ended up being more than enough for four people. I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for a slightly unique take on Chicago's deep-dish, and especially those looking for a lighter pizza that isn't as cheese-heavy as some of the other traditional deep-dish establishments.",0.9959,0.821,0.172,0.007,0.6202942093367625

Extra-Large Deep Dish Pizza w/ Sausage & Onions... Perhaps the monstrosity of the Pizza is the first most notable feature of Pequod's offerings.  At first glance, the size of the pizza resembled that of a car tire, rather than ""Pizza"".  The weight alone is enough to scare away any willing participant.   Of course, sampling the offerings should be the most judged critique in the Pizza's execution.  At first consumption, the gluttonous amount of ingredients used in the application is the most noteworthy attribute to Pequod's rendition of Deep Dish Pizza.  The slightly burnt, crispy crust is the first detection during consumption; which acts as the foundation of the monstrosity.  The mild detection of mozzarella cheese is the second of many flavors available.  Although the slew of contrasting elements in both flavor and quantity is the emphasis of Pequod's creation, the taste is ultimately the binding principle.  Patrons consuming this pizza will find that the gluttonous exertion of flavors produced from all elements ranging from the starchiness of the dough, the robust and tart nature of the tomato sauce, and meatiness / mild saltiness from the sausage work in stark contrast and conjunction to create a superb edible.  The excessive amount of all the ingredients used works remarkable well in the creation of both a burdensome but welcoming edible. What Pequod's embodies with their rendition of a Chicago staple is a perfect example of the city's food offerings.  It is through Pequod's embodiment of the mentality of Big Food / Big Flavor approach, that the foundation of their Pizza is created.  With most food, large quantities do not equate to excessive flavors.  Luckily, Pequod's manages to find a balance between both, while supplying an excessive amount of consumables within it's Deep Dish Pizza.",0.975,0.889,0.094,0.016,0.5389417989417988

I realize this isn't a huge amount of money, but I strongly feel he had an obligation to tell me I would be charged for another drink. When I asked the hostess after I received the check, she blew me off. A smarter business move would have been to have taken the charge off and apologized.

It is worth pointing out that the Pequod's deep dish is different from other ""chicago-style"" pizza like Giordano's or Lou Malnatti's.  This isn't stuffed pizza, it is more traditional- but again, it's all about the crust.  For me, nothing beats the topping combination of pepperoni and pepperoncini.  They smother the pie with toppings so I don't recommend going crazy with a lot of different toppings.   The restaurant itself can get pretty busy, especially on the weekends.  If you have a large party, be sure to make a reservation.  You can also place your order while you wait since it takes about 30 minutes to cook.

The caramelized/burnt cheese crust is everything an aspiring pizzeria should strive for however the rest of the crust had a pretzel-y flavor to it.  Not the flavor intensive crust edge that this place is supposedly know for. The ingredients are good. But. They are not of the highest quality.  Minimal spinach. Half ripe tomatoes.  The sauce has an almost processed tasted to it.  There was not any real essence of Italian seasonings, olive oil or the like.  The sausage chunks are great however. Large, liberal sausage. That's how it should be.  The cheese is quite delcious too.  Lots of cheese.  If you are eating deep dish you need lots of cheese and they did not disappoint.

2009-01-16,5.0,"Since I've relocated from upstate New York to Chicago one of the consistent questions I get from friends and family has been ""how's that great Chicago pizza"". Unfortunately I haven't been able to answer it with enthusiasm. I've tried the places that people rant and rave about; Gino's East, Giordano's, Pizano's, Pieces and a few others. While none of them were disappointing, they didn't live up to the expectations of Chicago pizza. I thought maybe that the great Chicago deep dish was a myth, something we New Yorkers had made up. Then I found Pequod's Pizzeria. Now that's some Chicago deep dish pizza! Pequod's has a very unassuming location on the 2200 block of North Clybourn. The seating area appears clean and tidy, but reminds you more of a bar than it would a pizzeria. The staff there is friendly and courteous, greeting and seating us the minute we stepped in. They even offered us better seating in the rear to get away from the cold air coming in as patrons entered and exited the restaurant.  They serve both deep dish and thin crust pizzas in small, medium and large sizes (10"", 12"", 16"") along with an array of appetizers. They offer an assortment of toppings but this being my first adventure I decided to stick with the tried and true topping of pepperoni. While we waited, a couple next to us was putting a hurting on a medium pizza that looked really good. They overheard us talking and piped in with ""This is going to be the best pizza you've had in the city"". High praise but I had heard it all before. The pizza came out and it looked absolutely delectable. The first thing I noticed is that the edge of the pizza appeared to be darkened, almost like it had been burned. The waitress assured me that it was perfectly normal due to their famous ""caramelized crust"". I dove in and it was heaven.  For those of you who like Gino's East, this is basically Gino's pizza with a helping of perfection added in. It has a very similar cornmeal like crust to the pizza, but it doesn't seem to taste as strong, which is a good thing. The pizza is very saucy, like Gino's, but not to the point where it's incredibly messy. The pepperoni was cooked exactly how i like it, where it's a bit crispy, but not burned. The portions were a good size as well. A small pizza split between two people should be enough for most, although if you want leftovers you may want to go with a medium. All that being said, Pequod's has been the best pizza experience I've had since moving to Chicago. Now when friends and family come to visit, I know exactly where to take them. If you're in the neighborhood I would suggest stopping in. There's a Kerasotas movie theatre right across the street as well, easily making a night of it if you're not close by.",0.9988,0.754,0.217,0.029,0.5340144889124481

I ended up picking it all off just to make the pizza edible. And basil? Please, there was hardly any in there! Even that couldn't add flavor to the lackluster sauce on this pizza. It tasted no better than Chef Boyardee. Really! I came over here for the first time after a killer kickboxing session at Bally's across the street. (I know, counterproductive.) I had hardly had a bite all day and I was starving. I also wanted to catch the Monday Night Football game. Pequod's had the game on, but the volume was so low you could barely hear the commentary. Come on; this is a casual pizza joint. Turn up the volume!! The service was good enough, but was the pizza? This Pequod's reminds me of an alt-pizza joint.

These two disasters converged last night before I ended up at Pequod's.  A group of 8 of us were supposed to meet at Piece, but due to that giggling whore Alpina from Check Please airing it recently, we couldn't get within 15 feet of the door (I am not stupid; I know we should have had reservations, but they don't allow them for parties under 10, you judgmental cunt).  So, to cut to the chase, our friend suggested Pequod's. He said he called and that we could get in, so I tried to calm down (i.e., pounded two beers) after I angered my fiancee by stating that her friends are idiots and that the reservations should have been left in my able hands.  We get into to Pequod's and it is fucking PACKED. We can't stand up front, and I got yelled at by some sluttish whore for bumping her at the bar.

Well, I'm out of college and I moved to New York, but whenever I visit Chicago, my friend, Brian, stuffs me with all kinds of Chicago-style food.  One place he introduced me to, Pequods, reminds me of Papa Del's, and, dare I say it, might be BETTER than Papa Del's!  They have a deep dish pizza that has a caramelized crust (they put parmesan around the crust before putting it in the oven).  The pizza has just the right amount of everything; it's not just a thin crust pizza with an inch of gloppy cheese (like SOME Chicago pizzerias).  I asked about shipping pizzas from Pequods to New York, but it was too expensive (dry ice, overnight shipping, etc)  I suppose I'll fly to Chicago anytime I have a craving :)",0.9462,0.88,0.097,0.023,0.5909151034151034

2008-06-19,5.0,"I've been eating Chicago Style pizza since I cut my first teeth, and Peaquod's became king of the hill in my book last year. After reading the rave reviews on  grubhub.com , my roommate ordered a medium pepperoni pizza. Usually, when either one of us orders pizza, we try and push the leftovers on the other the next day to avoid the guilt of eating pizza two nights in a row. The next day, I feasted on my first slice of microwaved Peaquod's pizza and it tasted better than most slices from  freshly baked pies elsewhere. Peaquod's formula for Chicago Style pizza strays slightly from the standard. Traditional Chicago Style pizza has a moderately thinner pie style crust and is layered with cheese, ingredients, and sauce. Peaquod's is essentially a thick pan pizza with no visible crust - just sauce and cheese straight to the edge. Because the cheese isn't in a hollowed crust, there is slightly less than you'd find on a pizza from Giordano's or Gino's East. As much as I love tons of melted cheese, I'm not bothered by the reduction. What they take away in cheese, they give back in ingredients. Holy freaking pepperoni! Now for the famous ""carmelized cheese crust"" that is mentioned in every review. Personally, it's hardly my favorite thing about Peaquod's but it does have an interestingly good taste. It tastes like a parmesan crisp ...only slightly charred with a bit of pizza sauce on the edge. It's kind of like croutons on a salad in that it's a nice crunchy add on, but overlookable in comparison to the dish it complements. Chicago Style traditionalists may not like Peaquod's because it's not like all the others. I love Chicago Style Pizza and thick crust pan pizza. Finding a place that somehow merged the two was a godsend. I've only had delivery from Peaquod's, but I am anxious to eventually taste a slice fresh out of the oven!",0.9907,0.829,0.14,0.031,0.47338709677419344

The atmosphere--this place has a real pizzeria feel, right down to the brick walls, the wooden booths, the TVs in every corner, and the little waitresses yelling out to the bartender ""TWO DIETS"" in a tubular Chicago accent whenever we asked for a refill on our pops. 2. The people--this place is NOT pretentious. You won't find any yuppies or business suits here. The crowd is friendly, laid-back, and comfortable in their jeans and tee shirts. Another plus is that it's a little bit off-track from the typical tourist-destination Chicago pizza joints, so I don't see that many touristy family excursions here too often. 3. The pizza--It's better than Giordano's, but then again, most pizzerias are. (Oh yeah, I just went there. ) The pan pies are fantastic. The dough actually has flavor, and then of course, there's that carmelized cheese. It may not be the best pizza you've ever encountered in your life (or maybe it is!), but it damn sure will come close.  One downside to Pequod's--no free refills! I know, I know. What is this, like, 1876? Who doesn't give free refills nowadays? The first time that happened to me at Pequod's, I wound up ringing up a tab of $16 just on diet pepsi refills alone!

I'm more of a fan of the thin crust pizzas here, although the ""carmelized"" cheese (aka burnt) on the deep-dish is interesting. That said, my two most recent orders were for a simple thin-crust sausage pizza. I used to be obsessed with the sausage they used because it was big hunks of REAL fennel-loaded Italian sausage, rather than those little round pellets of kibble that pass for sausage at the bulk of pizza places. But my last two pizzas just don't taste the same as the pizza I once loved. I thought my last order in which the sausage and spices on the pizza tasted a little off was a fluke, so I gave it another try. I'm not sure if they've switched sausage or altered the spices in the sauce or what, but it just isn't as good as it used to be. Also, I opened the box to find the cheese so runny that half of the ingredients of the pizza had slid to one side, which is annoying to say the least. I figure I've been a good enough customer and they've been reliable in the past so I plan to give them one more shot, although I'll stay away from the sausage. If my next pizza has the same iffy flavor as my past two, I'm thinking a decrease in stars might be in order. Caveat: When you order over the phone and pay with a credit card, they tend to write your entire card number, security code and ZIP code on the yellow carbon receipt stapled to the bag or box, so you might want to be sure to shred that baby before you throw it out.",0.7104,0.847,0.083,0.07,0.4388548752834467

THE CRUST - When you get the pizza, the edge of the crust looks dark, almost burnt, but really, it's CARMELIZED.  Its probably a different cheese from mozzarella, but it's GOOD.  This is one time you want to save the crust for last.  Now, some people don't LIKE carmelized cheese, and that's okay.  You can knock a star off the review in your head, but I keep it at 5. CAVEATS - Parking stinks.  Almost everything else on the menu is just okay, so ONLY order the pan pizza.  Yeah, one trick pony, but this pony can recite Shakespeare while juggling. Order in advance, and order more, cause this is a great next breakfast pizza.  Especially if you chose the trailer park girl and her two kids.",0.9786,0.766,0.164,0.069,0.6083333333333332

Haha, now that aside, on to the food:  Contrary to what one other reviewer had said I think the sauce is EXCELLENT and flavorful and you can smell it from outside the restaurant.  I suppose it is all a matter of personal opinion but I love that their pizza is more of a cross between deep-dish and pan which leaves room for more sauce, toppings and cheese than the usual 2"" thick deep-dish crust .  I might also add that the Pequod's salad is very delicious if you're looking for somewhat lighter fare.  My parents demand we go to Pequod's every time they visit now!",0.9905,0.812,0.18,0.008,0.4882575757575757

So here is my two cents on the 'Quod's experience: Pequods has the most amazing deep dish pizza EVER!!! Yes, better than Uno's, Due's, Gino's, Malnatti's and your Momma's pie combined. They are known famously for their ""burnt crust"" which is cheesy, crunchy, caramelized and pretty much one of the best things I've ever tasted - I usually work my way around the outside of the pizza and snack on it alone. Good sauce to cheese/ingredients ratio and the sauce itself is also tangy, chunky and delish.  Just one side note... if you don't dig the deep dish so much and prefer a thin-crust DO NOT GO HERE. I've had to learn several times through trial and (really bad) error that Pequod's can't do thin crust. The dough is really not thin and tastes like Play-Doh - no really, I used to eat it as a kid so I know...

I passed by and it seems like they are under renovation and will open up again soon with prices from the 1930's or something like that.

Their lunch special isn't to be beat.  An individual sized pizza with a drink ... oh man.  I'm a fan of the pineapple, but that's just me.

2006-04-01,4.0,"Great Chicago 'Za.  The key here is to ask for the pizza ""well done"" meaning the cheese is baked until carmelized around the edges.  This is deep dish, but not stuffed pizza.  Pep/Mushroom combo is solid.  Currently the location in the city is under reconstruction, but they will deliver from the burbs if you call the regular number.  Worth the wait on delivery and a must visit once they re-open at the intersection of clyb/webster.",0.7783,0.876,0.124,0.0,0.40384615384615385
2006-02-26,5.0,"OOH that carmelized cheese.  The elusive 5 star pizza award is once again handed out to Pequods.  2 locations to serve you, one in morton grove for the nw people and one in the city on webster.  quality and continuity is the same at each location so feel free to go wherever is closest.  IF you do not like deep dish pizza, keep moving, this is their specialty.  lets look at the pizza, shall we?  First thing you notice is that like true deep dish pizza (ala uno/due) it is served at your table in the pan it was cooked in, this is very important as the hot pan continues to crisp the pizza as you wait for your next slice (pinoccio's in niles could take this lesson) so your za never gets soggy. Second, it looks like it should, lots of oh so good carmelized cheese on the edge of each slice.  Thirdly, toppings are GENEROUS and excellent.  Truly a sausage lovers dream, but the other toppings are just as good, just not as stand out.  I am pretty big pizza eater, but 2 slices of pequods and I'm done.  I'd reccommend sizing your pizza with a 2-3 slice expectancy.  Also, pequods pizza has a great ability to be reheated and lose very little of it's original flavor.  I attribute this to the low moisture content of the dough after it cooks, but who knows for sure.  morton grove is a small place, but you can call ahead before you get there to get the pizza going.  Chicago is a larger operation, but parking can suck.  I know chicago will deliver, not sure about morton grove.  Waitstaff in MG is very freindly.  If you have out of town guests who are dying for unos/due's but you hate going downtown, feel confident with this fine representation of Chicago's Classic Deep Dish.",0.985,0.788,0.155,0.057,0.5274305555555557

2005-12-14,4.0,"This was one of the first pizza places that I came to when I moved to Chicago. I was on my search for ""the best Chicago style pizza."" I have to admit, I realized that I really don't like the deep dish Chicago style but Pequod's is different. It is a deep pan pizza with a caramelized/burnt crust which is something to crave. So it is really much better than traditional Chicago style, but just as filling. I can only finish one slice here and then i get sleepy. But if you haven't tried this place- you should. You can order it and pick it up or go in to a dive-type atmosphere.",0.7631,0.908,0.077,0.016,0.4981481481481482

Outstanding!!!  Great service, even when you are arguing about what toppings to get on the pizza :-)  It's moderately priced.",0.9832,0.64,0.329,0.031,0.669642857142857
