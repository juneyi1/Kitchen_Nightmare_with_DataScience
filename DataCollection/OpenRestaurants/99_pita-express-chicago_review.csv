It was odd but I turned around and started to walk away as the owner came running from behind telling me that they are in fact open and the employee was just being lazy... wth? In any case, the owner was nice and took my order and the transaction went smoothly. Unfortunately, the food was mediocre at best and I left wishing the owner hadn't seen me and called me back.  Hummus: bland Pita bread: soft but cold Fattoush salad: okay but didn't have any pita chips in there even though it was listed on the menu Rice: decent to good Beef: okay at best, lacked seasoning Chicken: dry and lacked seasoning Falafel: perfectly crisped and tasty - this was easily the best part of the meal, which is why I went with 2 stars instead of 1 I don't know if they generally give out any kind of sauces with their food but I did not get any with my meat combo. Perhaps with some good sauce, the dryness and the overall insipidness could've been overlooked but ultimately, the falafels simply aren't enough for me to go back.",0.9885,0.761,0.174,0.065,0.5833011583011584

This place is kind of to the side and out of the way from the rest of the restaurants in the food court.  Anyways, we walked up, were greeted nicely by the guy working there and after looking at all the option, and there were quite a few options, we ordered our food. I handed the guy my debit card and he swipes it...declined...swipes again...declined. So we just payed cash, no harm done, right? WRONG!! Right after 10 minutes while sitting and eating I get an email from my bank stating that my account was compromised and they blocked my card. After eating, I walked out and called the bank to see what the issue was. Turns out, instead of the 2 swipes of my debit card, it was clocked that my card was swiped 6 times!! 6 times!! So does that mean there was another debit reader hooked up there? I'd be aware of your debit transactions if you have visited or plan to visit this place and use your credit/debit. Just a warning. BEWARE!!  I'm not even going to go into the how the food was because it was OK. Nothing great to talk about. The shawarma isn't real, it's just chicken pieces not even marinated properly.

I ordered the sampler plate and was, frankly, mortified by the small, stale falafel, flavorless hummus, cold, undercooked chicken, and the (cold) dried out lamb. Stale pita chips. The rice and tabbouleh salad were decent, but not enough to make up for an otherwise piss poor meal. I thought maybe I'd just gone at the wrong time of day (late afternoon) and went the very next day at the beginning of lunch -- 11:30 a.m. I actually told the cashier that my first experience was not a great one but I was willing to try again. She yelled to the guys in the back to make sure everything was hot. Well, this time everything was reasonably warmed --- but it still tasted bad. If I didn't know any better, I'd think the falafel was from frozen -- it's that stale-tasting. The hummus was still flavorless, the lamb still dry.

2009-05-28,5.0,"I adore this place. It's probably in my top 3 loop lunch places.  I know very little about middle eastern food, but I know I love this place. I've tried a bunch of different falafel and this is by far my favorite. The spices they use are perfect for my taste. Whether or not they're authentic I have no clue though. I just think they're tasty.  I most oven get the middle east combo with meat. This come w/ two pieces of chicken, two pieces of beef, hummus, rice, half a pita, salad, and two falafel. It's so good. The hummus is wonderful and meat is almost never dry. And I've already gone over my love of falafel.  It's a really good lunch.  The staff is also really sweet and helpful if you don't know what you want. They're always in a good mood and seem to know some customers by name. I always think that's nice.  Now I'm off to finish my falafel... yum!",0.9952,0.673,0.29,0.037,0.6365079365079365

2009-03-19,2.0,"Just got a chicken shawarma sandwich and I am paying the price already. I feel gross. The best part of the sandwich was the pita - the chicken was dry and not fresh tasting (but still oily, somehow) and the lettuce was yellow. The sauce was bland and seemed spiced sour cream but the tomatoes were ok, I guess. And the sandwich cost $6! I should have gotten the falafel or the soup, which was probably better.

2009-03-18,4.0,I had the falafel sandwich and it was DELICIOUS.  They seem to be using a new ingredient that adds a great kick to a sandwich that can be hard to personalize.  The fries aren't great so next time I will try the pita chips instead.  And the man behind the counter (owner?) was friendly and helpful.  Remember to ask for the hot sauce!,0.9444,0.683,0.253,0.064,0.6162457912457913

I ended up getting a combo plate which included chicken, beef, falafel and rice. The meats were so dry!! The rice was good although again a little dry. The falafel was fine. There was a small portion of salad which was fine. I have to say I wasn't overly impressed and I kept re-tasting the food all afternoon.

2009-02-18,2.0,"Good falafel, not my favorite falafel sandwich.  Out of 5 stars, they lose one for charging to add hummus to falafel sandwich (what?!), they lose another for having a $10 credit limit (who spends $10 on lunch at a falafel stand?), and yet another because the table area is not so appetizing.

2008-05-22,5.0,"I work in the Thompson Center, and every day I don't bring a lunch, the close, affordable, and healthy choices are very slim.  If not for Pita Express, I don't know what I would do. They have a whole array on the regular menu, including VERY yummy falafel sandwiches and gyros sandwiches.  These may look small (its the filling with veggies and sauce in a pita) but I've got a decent sized appetite and one of them fills me up.  If you are a heartier eater, they also have rice dishes- which include a meat or entre veggies, over rice, with some kind of salad on the side and a half piece of pita (if I'm really hungry I'll eat one of these, or a lot of times I'll get it anyway and just keep leftovers).  This category includes dishes like: beef kabob, chicken kabob, and more recently chicken tikka or chicken masala.  They also have weekly specials that are served over rice with salad and half pita. You can usually get a chicken, lamb (!), or veggie version of the specials. I've seen the following specials: kedra, baked eggplant, biryani. There are others I unfortunately can't remember right now.  My absolute favorite is the kedra. The only downsides to the food here is that if you happen to come at the wrong time and get a dish over rice, you might get stale rice that's a little harder than normal. Also, sometimes their spice levels are inconsistent. If worried, you can ask to taste a sample. This is hands-down my favorite place in all of the food court.",-0.5915,0.866,0.064,0.07,0.5746012052463665

Tired of the usual Thompson Center food court slop, I finally tried something new and loved it. I came here today on Vasmi's suggestion and excellent review of the place.  I got the falafel sandwich and it kicked ass. I got it with hummus instead of the special sauce. When I got back to the office, my first bite was amazing. The pita was fresh and soft while the spiced chickpeas were delicious. For appearing on the smaller side, the falafel filled me up very well. Also, for such a fresh meal, it was extremely reasonable.

They also have hummus, baba ghanoush, tabbouleh, falafel, kababs, shwarma, and more.  For dessert, they offer baklava and other pastries.",0.9353,0.826,0.134,0.04,0.48141025641025637

Best part of the meal was there fresh lemonade that was only 50C to refill.  People working were nice and friendly.

I'll have to come back and give it another try (fries, YES!) as i think there's some potential. Oh and it's tucked away in the NW corner FYI.",0.7479,0.799,0.137,0.064,0.5037037037037037
