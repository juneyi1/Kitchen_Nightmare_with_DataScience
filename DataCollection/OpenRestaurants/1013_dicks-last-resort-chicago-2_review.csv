The price menu  is reasonable. We both had the Catfish dinner that came with fries and cole slaw. The Catfish was cooked and seasoned to perfection. Golden Brown and crispy on the outside and well done on  inside Its just a place to come eat drink and enjoy yourself to live laugh and have an amazing time of your life. They even make a speacial white hat for you to wear when you fine in. Made specially for you lol I forgot to ask our waiteress for her name. She was extremely rude Lol She made my Bestie bday a great experience. We laughed the whole time we were there today. Her rude humor kept us with laughter.

It's really unfortunate that the hostess and nobody else (if there's a sign at the entrance, we both didn't see it) bothered to tell us about the ""rude"" attitudes we would be encountering while visiting this spot because if we would have know up front about it we may have enjoyed it and been able to indulge in the game of ""rude asshole"" ourselves.  Unfortunately, being as jet lagged tired as I was, I was instead forced to assume that the hostess and everyone else there were definitely on a shitty low level of human life and my girlfriend and I would most likely end up with all kinds of spit, bugs, and everything else in our food and beers.  So here's my advise to the manager. Make 100% certain that people walking into your establishment have the slightest clue where they are and just what the hell they are in for, so that they can decide wether or not they're going to enjoy such a crappy and random way of being treated when they are there spending their hard earned dollars.",-0.9603,0.786,0.066,0.148,0.5719047619047618

I placed a reservation for my party of five, knowing it's the week kids have off for spring break and thus avoiding any long waits. So, kudos to the hostess for seating us early for the reservation we arrived just a tad prematurely for, it was appreciated! Upon sitting down we were placed with one waitress, who we were pretty upset ended up losing our table to her co-worker.  She's immediately had the dry humored 'tude I had long awaited, tossing out table wear in the center and demanding we place it in front of ourselves.  After leaving to place the order for our drinks, a different waiter returned and explained her would be taking on our table as she had stolen one of his. This wouldn't have been an issue had he not neglected providing the full ""dick"" experience. He wasn't even mean to us, he placed our orders and provided our food, as well as grossly overused phrases for our hats, and that about did it. Beyond that, he got an order wrong at our table and was actually visibly annoyed, not in Dick's humor style, and never stopped by to refill drinks or be awful to us. I had only gotten my hat in the last fifteen minutes we were there, and while it wasn't a recycled phrase the entire time we were there we spent more time watching other peoples fun while our table was a drag. I was super disappointed in my long awaited experience, but I find hope that perhaps at another location or with a different staff member it would be better. Ultimately, the food isn't the greatest but I would imagine that sort of a thing would go unnoticed with a real funny waiter/tress.

2015-12-20,4.0,"This was my second visit to this DLR. On my first visit, it was during the summer of 2013. We sat outside and view of the marina was exquisite. Right after we sat down, an order of fried pickles arrived. We didn't order them, and figured it was some sort of complimentary thing. No, we were charged for them. The waiter, in true dickhead fashion said ""why did you eat them if you didn't order them"". Oh well, it's a good thing that I liked them. It was actually the first time that I'd ever had fried pickles and I've tried them several times since then, and I must say that DLR had the best fried pickles.  My main course was a grilled chicken salad and it was on the small side. So if you don't order the salad and not a appetizer too, you might walk away hungry.  They start by giving us drink and appetizer menus but then we sort of waited on the entree menu, then learned that the main menu is on the wall, or if your table is away from it, they'll bring a standup menu, just look around. The waitress explained the menu and she was snide, without being too rude. I decided in king crab legs and then later learned that they were out... grrrr. I wanted seafood. I started over in my decision process and decided on the appetizer platta, actually I split it with my daughter. She was going to order chicken wings anyways. The platter came with wings, which she swore were the best she's ever had, I had one and thought it was good, just not the best I've had. It also came with fried pickles, and we know what I think about those, chicken bites, celery, and mozzarella sticks. The mozzarella sticks weren't very warm, but there was no way in Hades that I'd send them back at this place.  I had the specialty margarita and it was very weak, especially for the $30 price. The prices of the drinks aren't on the listed on the menu, which I absolutely hate. The waitress said that I could keep the souvenir plastic cup that it came in, but I left it because of the walk back to the hotel. The last time that we were there the glass was an actual glass and the waiter offered to wrap them and put them in bags for us... maybe the actual glass was extra, but I don't remember that they were.",0.8915,0.88,0.073,0.047,0.4201869256474519

The place wasn't very busy, but the staff seemed fairly disjointed. Maybe that's part of the theme? Both my girlfriend and I knew what we were in for - Dick's is known for its brash atmosphere and service. You go there expecting to be insulted and treated rudely, but it's all in good fun. A well-known staple of Dick's is the obnoxiously large paper hats that the servers provide for you to wear, with insulting personalized commentary written on the front. The decor of the restaurant is fitting. The place is littered with crude knickknacks: bras hanging from the bar ceiling, a drug paraphernalia display board, etc. all stuffed into a dimly lit surf-themed dive bar. A good amount of entertainment is derived from simply looking around the restaurant. The host was in a heated discussion with two ladies that ended with ""shut the f*** up,"" before he turned and greeted us. We were told to find our own seats near the bar. Our waitress greeted us by explaining that her job was to offend us. Unfortunately, she did a poor job doing so. Her interaction with us was limited to demanding we ""speak up"" and calling us ""boring"" while slamming her hand down on our table. We also requested hats, which she jokingly told us we wouldn't get. And we didn't. She did, however, provide hats for other guests she was serving. Pretty disappointing. If anything, she was the boring one. In contrast, the server at the table next to ours was hilariously obnoxious. He sang loudly, interacted with his customers in a friendly but crude manner, providing the entertainment that Dick's is known for. They were also given hats.  The food was alright. We stuck with appetizers. She had the crab balls, I had the gator/jalapeño bites. The crab balls were wonderfully flavored with a soft texture. The french fries tasted like McDonald's fries. The gator bites were dry, but tasty, with a disproportionate amount of jalapeños served with only a small portion of meat. The drinks were stupidly overpriced, but we got to keep the glassware they came in, so I guess that's a plus. For the price, the small portions of food were definitely not worth it. Will we come back again? Probably not. Had we had a different server, maybe. The food was expensive without being memorable, and the service did not live up to the hype.

2014-06-18,5.0,"I loved this place. The host was hilarious and immediately made us feel welcomed whilst cracking some jokes of course. We arrived about an hour before closing so the restaurant had plenty of good spots to be seated. Our host let us pick where we wanted to sit which was cool. We all jumped at the opportunity to sit on the balcony, which has a wonderful view of the river and city lights.  Our waitress was hilarious and didn't go too over the top on the jabs against her customer's. Which is obviously one of the reasons you go here is for the funny trash talking! You never know what you are gonna get on the joke front. But she kept us laughing and made the experience pleasant!  The menu has some great seafood options but after a long day of walking around I wanted to be girly and enjoy a nice salad. Went with the Chicky Cesar salad which was very yummy. Large proportions so you get your bang for your buck. Your basic beverages come in giant cups which I loved because I was extremely parched and just wanted to go to town on my refreshing coke. I'm sorry but nothing beats it!  The restaurant has so much stuff to space out and stare at. I loved the lighting, the stuff on display, etc. Very groovy place visually. Thrilled to see they had a shuffle board table(as well as some pinball machines).  I had a great experience!",0.9957,0.763,0.232,0.005,0.706305114638448

He went above and beyond to make sure we laughed and had fun. The food was delicious ! The boys had burgers which were huge and delicious. The fried pickles and sampler platter very good. I ordered a salad with steak and the steak was very good. It's a great place and reasonably priced and they even gave my daughter a sundae with a candle.

2014-03-19,1.0,"If I could give 0 stars I would! This one star is to the manager who tried not to let the employes run the joint. I came here to celebrate my daughters 15th birthday. When I called to make reservations, after looking online, I asked if this was a family friendly restaurant, because the pics on the web look like Oktoberfest! They assured me families come here all the time. The Adams Family, maybe?!?! There were obscenities and profanity on those long white hats. Definitely not for kids. It was like an after dark klan meeting. Before we sat down we were told if our whole party was not there by 6:15 our table would be given away, We had a party of 30. Soon as about 15 of my guest arrived, about 6:11, I asked to be seated. I had to lie about all my guest being there to try to avoid a disaster. After we sat down, the hostess started counting ppl at the table!! Really lady, Don't you have a job to do up front, bye!  She started telling the manager on us, all the while my guest are steadily arriving, filling up the table fast. The manager came over after the hostess tried to move us and asked did he want my daughters cake in the fridge. I wish all the employees had as much sense as he. First off to the server Steve, it's called rude not racist! First thing out of Steve's mouth is ""there's no watermelon, barbecue or fried chicken."" Mind you he was speaking to a table of 30 Black people. Service was horrible, I know they have to be rude but they can still do their job. Drinks, alcoholic and non-alcoholic, were placed at the end of the table and had to be passed down by the patrons, including about 20 teenagers. Where does this happen? Where they don't mind kids touching alcohol. I asked for a menu, that's usually where there's a description of the food. No menus just a 5ft chalkboard put on my head, I politely tossed it back! Then they bring my daughter's birthday cake out while I was gone to the restroom, who told them to even bring it out?!? Next the bill, everyone had separate checks. The waiter left all the checks at the end of the table, just like he did our drinks, it was left up to us to decipher who's bill was who's. Mind you this is with teenagers. My daughter's friend gave the waiter $40, he argued she only gave $30. Everyone else paid there bills and started leaving. I was about to pay my daughters bill when she had an extra chicken tender and drink on it in addition to what she had. He argued me up and down that we owed the money for it. When he couldn't get it out of me, he sent his side kick over for reinforcement. They were yelling, cursing and fussing at me trying to make me pay, I had to give them a dose of their own medicine. Make a long story short, I wasn't budging. Why would we pay 30 bills and not pay one for $13 bill? It's the principal. If the server would have done his job, which is to serve i.e. hand out checks, a lot of confusion could have been avoided. I hate that I didn't do a dry run after my daughter picked this place. We definitely would have never spent her birthday here. The management offered free stuff to be sent to the table when I come back but that will never make up for the horrible experience.

Instead of getting ripped off like most places, they gave me a pint size glass of ice and mostly vodka and an entire red bull. That never usually happens. So, thank you for that. You are doing it right!  The atmosphere is typical Dick's. Inappropriate and fun! Bras hanging from the bar. Condom dispensers in the bathroom. Insulting waiters making inappropriate hats for the customers. Blunt and to the point service.  I give this 4 stars only because our waiter up and took a break and I had to find a different one to pay the tab. Otherwise the food and drinks were awesome.

The hostess was nice told us to pick a seat, we sat at the bar since the outside was full the decor was usual beachy FL style and the view of the river was great. The bartender came over to us and barked that there was a menu, flung it at us and walked away. He came back later and the look on his face was just plain pissed off to be at work.  ""Don't order a mixed drink. They're not strong, theres no alcohol in them."" He barked at us. We wanted a drink with vodka (not beer) so thinking if I asked for a drink that was not a tropical fruity drink like a pina colata on the menu i'd at least get a moderately good drink, especially after I told him ""well since I dont want a weak drink I guess i'll get a vodka cran"" I thought that would do the trick. Super small clear cup with literally so little alcohol in it that you could have given it to a baby in a sippy cup and they'd been fine.  He told us there was no menu it was only what was written on the wall and it was vague lists of food like ""fish sandwhich"" ""steak"" with no description of what anything was or how much it cost or anything in the slightest.  At that time when i'm looking disappointed be begins to stare at my breasts, and not just a little, I mean blatantly. Not I get it, if you have a shirt with cleavage you get a look on occasion  but not like this. It was the kind of scum of the earth creepy look that makes you feel like they are going to nab you up in an ally. I was not pleased. A girl came next to us and ordered a drink and he yelled at her about her order and another couple came in as well and he was very rude to them and it was a horrible display! We left out full drinks, paid the bill and for the first time in my life I left no tip.

If you're familiar with Ed Debevic's, it's a similar concept, only without the dancing.

I like to think I'm quick-witted (don't contradict me or I'll kick you in the nuts!). However, our waitress also seemed pretty busy, and the service was kind of slow. USEFUL information coming up: We were not told when seated that there isn't an entree menu that they hand you, rather it's on chalkboards around the restaurant and toted around by the servers. After we had our drinks and finished our appetizer (the app menu is on the table), the waitress finally came over with a chalkboard and described every item on the menu, as the board contained only a name & price. Some items are self-explanatory, others are not (more to come). I am not a fan of this approach, since I like to consider my options slowly, not be presented with my choices and asked for a decision on the spot. The food isn't really what I was expecting. I thought it would be bar food (burgers & sandwiches) but it wasn't. There were ribs, steaks, chicken, some seafood, a couple salads, one pasta entree (waitress: ""We're not an Italian restaurant so I don't recommend that.""), orange chicken (waitress: ""Ching Chang Chongy"") and maybe one or two other things I forget. I had the obscurely (but understandably) named ""Dolly"" which was two large chicken breasts. Get it? Eh? It came over rice, with sauteed (?) veggies. BF had the half chicken, which was served on a bucket, with a smaller bucket of fries. The food was OK. Not great. Decent quantity. Everything seems a buck or two over-priced here.

At the end of the day, while I didn't hate the experience, I have no desire to go back to Dick's.",0.9633,0.782,0.166,0.052,0.5578282828282829
2009-06-12,2.0,"The only positive thing about Dick's was The Beatles cover band (aka The Meatles) that was playing during Sunday brunch. I understand the concept of the teasing that occurs at these types of places, however, some of the staff seemed to be dealing with anger issues. The host was actually quite hateful and I felt his attitude was insulting versus the ha ha kidding kind of banter I was expecting. If being insulting while seating guests and then totally ignoring them for 10 minuets are the norm then this place is not for me. Maybe the staff should go through training to learn tips on how to be funny rude and not insulting rude. There's a huge difference imo.  I had the Gormay Burger (topped with Bleu/Swiss cheese and Creole Mustard) which was overpowered by a horseradish taste which was resolved by removing the top bun.  Thumbs down on the service, thumbs half way on the food, and thumbs up on the band.",-0.8685,0.746,0.109,0.145,0.6594381313131313

2009-05-23,3.0,"A tourist is...what a tourist does...... And Dicks Last Resort is one of Chicago's BEST tourist traps. I mean where can you go to eat food you can get just about anywhere else, yet have servers verbally abuse you with raging sarcastic comments who throw napkins at you when you ask for some and make phallic-like hats that are placed on your head with messages scrawled on them like... For a guy sitting at the tables that was losing his hair on top they wrote.....""The more hair I lose the more head I get"" Another one read, ""I'm hung like a naked midget standing in the cold"" And yet another read, ""My Indian name is ""she who sleeps with many guys."" In addition, folks are throwing balled up paper napkins every 10 seconds, though when I took some paper and threw a paper airplane management told me to ""stop it.""  I guess poking folks in the eye isn't as fun as I thought it would be?!?!?!?! There is live music though, but I wasn't drinking enough to find them entertaining. Forget coming here for the food, get a few friends and pound some beers, smoke a joint and head down the Dicks Last Resort for one of the most obnoxious, yet fun meals you'll ever experience.",-0.8718,0.823,0.062,0.115,0.43735380116959055

2009-01-05,2.0,"Wow.  Very expensive menu for the type of place it is.  And I went at lunch when the prices are better.  If these guys are even going to compete with their upstairs neighbor House of Blues, they'll have to adjust their prices. The food is standard bar fare.  The beer list is extensive, but even Old style is not cheap.  I bet it'd be a fun place to drink when the doors are open to the river, but I'd have to be on an expense account to justify that. I had a Buffalo chicken sandwich while I was there and was underwhelmed by it and the small portion of fries that accompanied it.  My sister had the soup and Salad and liked it.  With that and SOFT drinks and tip, it cost me almost $30.  There's better similar food at wendy's. I was also disappointed to see they don't have crawfish on the menu as some of their locations do. Service was excellent, which accounts for the stars they got. I received no insults, maybe because there was one waitress and she only had to deal with 2 other parties DURING LUNCH. The thing I liked most about the experience was the empty trophy case with a piece of paper in it that says ""Cubs Champisonsip Jersey"".",0.9501,0.824,0.122,0.055,0.5758333333333334
