2017-08-30,2.0,"I went for diner with my husband two weeks ago to celebrate my birthday , we were looking to dine in Alinea since we moved to Chicago , we both working in the industry we couldn't wait to try one of the best restaurants in Chicago and in the world .   Our reservation was for 8:30pm and when we got there at 8:30pm we were told to have a seat and wait until our table was ready , it may have been 15 min wait, we were so exited .... when we got to the table the tasting menu started right away , we were not doing wine pairing so we ordered a bottle of wine , the wine didn't arrive until we were in the middle of the dinner, we thought they couldn't find it and we were about to cancel it by the time it got to the table , the food was great, a couple of weak dishes but I guess that is very subjective, service was not what you expect for a 3 Michelin star restaurant, we felt rushed , the plates kept being taken very fast when one of us finished not considering that the other person was still eating the same course of the menu, it happened in most of the courses and just like that our experience was over ,  it last 1hr , probably 1hr and 30min considering the waiting time and the time that took us to finish our wine, we were left with almost half bottle of wine because as I said it came in the middle of the dinner , we felt like we were trying to make longer the experience  by ourselves, as I said it was my birthday and wanted it to be special , that's why we chose Alinea for that day, we probably went the wrong day , felt like everybody was in a rush to start closing the restaurant when there was still plenty of people, the service was not engaging, we felt like a number ...,I'm giving 2 starts for the overall experience because food was great but the experience was ruined by the service .",0.967,0.864,0.097,0.039,0.39727380952380953
2017-08-28,3.0,"Guys. This one breaks my heart. I had such high hopes and maybe too high of hopes. Also the price demands that this is life changing. It didn't help that I had just gone to another Chef's Table restaurant, Pujol in Mexico City, and was blown away for a fraction of the price. Everything at Alinea was delicious. BUT it was over hyped in my opinion and overpriced. I think with the TV specials and and the attention on this place, its reputation has just blown up to standards that can't be met. Idk. I have to go meditate on this. Painful to review.",-0.1525,0.871,0.071,0.058,0.696

Rude, rude, rude service and they turn the tables lightning fast, you definitely will leave feeling rushed.  Food is gimmick at best, sea bass was chewy, poor food quality (some of it not even edible). Oh and the dessert.. bubble gum... really!   If this is their interpretation of Avant-garde they missed the mark big time.  Don't waste your money go somewhere else.  Want to read more?..... OK After quickly checking out the reviews and seeing a few pics, this place looks amazing right?.... WRONG.... had high expectation that all dissipated at table..... - Booking: the best marketing scam out there. They limit the tables offered so you feel lucky to get a table then when we got there the room was half empty. - Ambiance: plain, dull gray wall and cold (60 degrees cold) room. Honestly the bathroom was better decorated.  - Staff: rude and they look beaten / disinterested kitchen staff. Not once we were asked if we enjoying our food. The sommelier can't even pour the correct measure, paid $26 for 1.5oz glass of wine. - Food: oooh the food.......you will be greeted by a peace of lettuce wedged on top of a lime (was sitting on the table for god knows how long). And the giant bowl of orange w the dry ice..... Then it seems as they ran out of plates so the waiter present a tasteless micro pancake on a stick...... and so on...then the sea bass (they can't leave good enough alone, no harmony in the combinations) over cooked, chewy and more inedible compensation of ""stuff"" in the bowl.... Oh, oh and the poor attempt from the waiter to cook a potato (that was buried in salt) on our table....come on..... The plates looked good enough for pics for Instagram but lacked harmony between ingredients and cohesion between the dishes.  It's more gamic food and downhill experience from there. I sat there course after course in disbelieve ""is that it"" ""that's the best they can come up with"" ""the chef will redeem himself at the next course""........wrong    - Price: outrageous.....that's why you have to prepay because if they present you with that outrageous bill at the end of that highly disappointing experience you will never pay it.  I guarantee you I wouldn't.  - Management: guilt ridden, very defensive and set in their own ways. Don't bother complaining to Quincy, Nick or even Grant. They have no problem taken you money and never explained the poor food quality or the rude service.... They will blame everyone one else before they look in the mirror.      Finally...if I ever feel the urge to have that experience again I'll go ahead and schedule my colonoscopy as I'm sure Ill get the same level of satisfaction.",-0.8124,0.76,0.114,0.126,0.5492440801457196
2017-08-25,5.0,"I mean...what could this review tell you that countless other reviews, best-of lists, documentaries, books, and three little non-Yelp stars couldn't? Sure, the restaurant has changed in the past couple years, but I don't think I missed out on too much. I placed my reservations in late May of '16 for two for an early June reservation - I got lucky as it had just reopened and I don't think you'll be able to get a table only two and a half weeks out anymore. I went with the Salon with standard pairings. My fiancee and I are not wine connoisseurs, but we weren't about to pass up paired drinks. Service is similar to what I've experienced at other Achatz places.  Yes, this is the finest of fine dining, but our servers were smart enough to realize we were a young couple out for a fun night. They answered all of our questions, made sure we were taken care of, and never once did I feel out of place. I even overheard a server try his best at translating a dish description to guest who only spoke Spanish. It's hard to type out a description of everything we had, especially with it being 11 courses and most of them having wine (or mezcal) with it. There was dehydrated scallops in a corn soup. Smoky chicken thigh dressed as the Mexican flag. A ""yellow"" dish of curry, pork, and yellow chopsticks. And of course, we finished off with the signature helium filled candy balloon. Oh, and rather than their former famous dessert painted on the table, ours was painted on...a painting. Each dish was perfectly balanced, and by that I mean balanced between ""WTF are they serving us"" and ""WTF are these flavors in my mouth"". It's a fun time and a unique experience. Is this deserving of the praise of being not only one of the best countries in the city, but also the world?

2017-08-21,4.0,"It seems futile or arrogant to review Alinea, but of course we'll attempt it anyway. We had tried for a couple months to get a reservation to the gallery, and when we finally did, we built the rest of our trip to Chicago around it. It's absurd how much money dinner for two costs, but we knew that this was a 'once-in-a-lifetime' experience. We liked that yesterday evening started with a communal table and we were fortunate to be seated near folks who were friendly and easy to converse with. We didn't particularly enjoy any of the crazy starter ""flower"" courses, and even though it was gimmicky, it was still pretty awesome when the flower pots started smoking. The shaker and spear course in the kitchen was one of our favorites; both the drink and the amuse were delicious, and while we thoroughly enjoyed being in the action back there, you could tell some of the BOH folks were less than thrilled about it. The rest of the meal at individual tables had some highs and lows. We didn't like the ""glass"" course, and while the ""fire and ice"" course was entertaining, none of the components tasted like they belonged together. On the other hand, the truffle course was amazing--who knew that a sous vide potato could be so delicious? While it was served colder with way too much of the dairy than we would prefer, we loved it, and we especially loved the truffle toast. Dessert: the candy bar dessert was OK, but the grape balloon was fun and certainly more nostalgic. Playing LCD Soundsystem during the paint performance? A+ We liked our servers for the most part. They were fun and cool. We have two major complaints:  1) For $900, the fact that our only major protein was a tiny ass piece of veal cheek kinda pissed us off. Yes yes, we're paying for Grant et al's ingenuity and vision, but still.  2) Once we were sat back down at the individual tables after the kitchen, everything felt extremely rushed. One course came out right after another, plates were cleared quickly (even after only one of us had finished--that's amateur hour service), and just as we were starting to settle in, it was time for dessert. All told, we're happy we went, and we had a wonderful night, but we still can only give Alinea four stars. Like most things in life, as when we saw Hamilton for almost the same price two nights before, Alinea just wasn't worth the money. We've spent a lot less on fine dining (i.e. Eleven Madison Park, Per Se, Streireck), where we feel that every penny was well-spent. Did we see smoking flower pots there, or chefs smashing frozen white chocolate down on a tray that came from the ceiling? Of course not. There's no denying that this was the most unique dining experience that we've ever had, but a day later, the feeling gnaws at us that on food alone Alinea sacrifices substance for style.",0.9985,0.722,0.214,0.064,0.548855061150143
2017-08-20,1.0,"We were charged about $700 for two people with taxes and 20% service charge. This amount is too little if you are in the 1% and too much if you are in the 99%, aspiring for a taste of the life of 1%.  Upon arrival, we were greeted by the hostess. An usher walked us to our seats. Once seated, a server greeted us and all of the guests with the same script after being seated. He was jaded and his performance was insincere. His role in the ""experience"" is to elegantly inquire if you are high worth guest i.e. if you will shell out $100+/person for a wine tasting.  There was an amuse bouche resting on the table before we were seated. Out of four servers on the floor, none bothered to inform us what it was. When the meal begins at such a high note it has only one place to go from there i.e. downwards. The courses were presented by disinterested kitchen staff, who mumbled while describing the dishes and were offended when asked to repeat. The dishes were not memorable and lacked flavor and seasoning. All of the accolades have numbed the taste buds of the chef and his staff. The dishes are good for Instagram. The meal ended with two desserts both of which were lackluster.    One of the dishes was presented with a bed of salt. None of the staff bothered to clean the salt on the table for the rest of the evening. If the diner has been coerced to pay 20% service charge, then the diner can not ask for his/her money back, if the service isn't good. I would ask Grant to let the diner decide if the service they received was worth 20% tip.  During the two hour experience, the staff sarcastically asked us about our opinions on some of the dishes. Buddy, if you are not excited about your own food, then it makes me look like a fool paying high prices for a meal you don't believe in.  Temper your expectations, since both people and food are gimmicky here.  It's a great marketing tactic to create a sense of scarcity by making the reservation hard to come by. The media/PR has hyped up the place. The chef is focused on expanding his restaurant empire by opening more restaurants in Chicago and other cities rather than offering a good experience to the diners at Alinea. If you decide to dine here, then know that you are not paying for the food, service, or ambiance you are paying for one thing and one thing only i.e. the brand Grant Achatz.",0.9723,0.849,0.101,0.05,0.5624666666666667

You guys know what Alinea is. It is of course expensive, and we paid an additional price for the wine pairings, but what you get in return is completely worth it. It's not like you're going here every other weekend for a quick bite. As much as all of you enjoyed Hamilton (or insert any other musical you prefer), you didn't go see it again the next weekend. That's kind of what I would compare this to - an amazing theater or vacation experience.

The flower was served with smoke coming from the plant in the middle of the table.  It was interesting, not a ton of flavor.  Then they brought us in the kitchen for a cocktail.  The shaker and spear were excellent.  After returning to the table the flower was gone and we were served the crunch, and a host of other tiny bites.  All were very interesting, but nothing stood out.  Then came the ink, which was very cool, and actually quite good.  The corn soup I did not enjoy.  Then came the Thai inspired dishes which were my favorite.  The Thai wings and curry soup were great.  The pork belly was ok, nothing spectacular.  I did not care for the blueberry.  The spuds with truffles were amazing, fresh truffles on top of whipped potatoes.  The bean and tenderloin were again good, but not the best I've ever had.  The rest of the desserts were pretty standard except the balloon and candy bars.  So neat, I won't ruin it for you but the presentation is second to none.  Last was the finale, the paint show, again I won't divulge too much, but was amazing to witness. Overall I really thought the food was good, but not out of this world.

2017-08-06,2.0,"Let me begin with the caveat that this review is for the SALON seating (10-12 courses) and not the Kitchen Table experience (16-18 courses).  We tried to get tickets for Kitchen the morning they were released 1 1/2 months in advance but couldn't secure them.  Anyone planning a visit, use multiple computers/browsers and target different times (and days if possible).   My review has nothing to do with the mechanism for getting seating here though -- the 2-stars reflect our disappointment from the actual dining experience. 1.  For a 3-Michelin star meal compromising of ""10-14 courses"" AND with wine pairings, I don't expect to finish my meal in 75 minutes.  But we did.  Fastest Michelin star (1, 2 or 3 stars) meal ever.  And yes, that is because the service was super-rushed.  It was ridiculous.  Not sure if it was because we had the last seating at 9 pm, but that is no one excuse.  After our meal I went back and read some recent reviews and apparently others have felt the same.  Hardly any time between courses to transition.  As an example, they gave us 3 desserts, the last which was their famous helium balloon.  They brought out the balloon within 3 minutes of the prior dish coming out and while we were still eating it.   2.  As for the food, there were definitely some unique dishes and presentation.  For example, what they do with the bowl of oranges and the potato buried in the fire that is later used for a truffle potato dish was impressive.  But the overall quality of food was underwhelming.  Some of the dishes sounded or looked very interesting, but the flavors did not come together -- there was depth, but not in a good way.  We ate at Oriole (2-Michelin star) a few nights earlier and the food was much better.   The savory portions here also ended abruptly.  Perhaps due to feeling rushed or that we only had the Salon experience.  But I expected more than the final savory course to be a small piece of veal cheek. 3.  The dessert in my opinion was terrible.  The bubblegum dish was disgusting and one of the worst desserts I've ever had, borderline unedible.  Perhaps there is a segment of people who really like bubblegum flavor and wouldn't mind eating it in multiple forms/textures -- but we did not enjoy it.   The helium filled edible balloon was a neat twist and one of the few positives to the meal.  But overall, when dessert counts for 3 of 10 courses, I expected more. 4.  The wine pairing was a disappointment.  We probably had 7-8 different drinks.  Small/average pours at best.  Quality just OK.  For dessert, they gave us a single pour of a cider.  The cider was decent, but you'd expect to get a dessert wine, port, or something more unique and more than one drink for 3 desserts.  More notably, our server didn't pour my wife her wine pairing for the veal cheek dish (last savory course) and he poured mine into the same glass as my prior pairing (that was empty, hers was not).  It was very strange and we expected him to come back and perhaps pour when she was done with the glass in front of her but he never did. We have heard great things about Alinea from others and perhaps this was just an off-night.  We really wanted to come back another time and try the Kitchen Table experience, but may not after such a terrible showing.   The only reason for not giving one-star is that some of the theatrics and presentation were truly unique and I understand why these at one time helped Alinea earn its 3 Michelin stars.  But as many of written, this place has gone downhill and no longer lives up to the rating. If you are in Chicago and looking for an exceptional Michelin-star experience, I recommend Oriole.  I think they recently earned a second star.  We ate there 3 nights earlier.  Where I'd give Alinea Salon a D, Oriole gets an A+.  And that grading is independent of fact that Oriole was less expensive.",0.7491,0.843,0.081,0.075,0.4648503114325899

As he said on Chef's Table, Grant truly pushes the limits of what your taste buds can handle and despite every entree having at least 10 ingredients, each ingredient's flavour gracefully blends and enhances one another. The chefs sweep you away in a delectable masquerade where each ingredient pretends to be something else and each dish is tantalizingly unmasked.   Each course was unforgettably mouthwatering and my hesitation to grant it 5-star status stems from the soothing, but bland restaurant decor and the fact that some of my senses felt a little left out of the party. The upstairs decor was dimly lit with grey and white accents. Perhaps Grant intended this to be a blank canvas that would allow him to paint his gorgeous food against?  My senses of taste and sight were satisfyingly fulfilled on the culinary journey, but I felt as if  touch, hearing and smell had been asked to stay at home. Touch was sort of involved when one dish was presented in a silicone bowl which we held in our hands while eating and smell was tingled when liquid was added to the centerpiece to give life to the lemon, lime and orange scents.  Truly, every dish was prepared with thoughtfulness and inspiration. My faves were the dishes that involved multiple senses, such as the coconut bowl with sea bass, coconut meat, and peppery flowers nestled upon a mountain of salt and bathed in the warm glow of a fire (hiding a slow cooking Yukon potato) and the nostalgic dessert based on bubble yum, banana and cake flavours and served with a grape helium balloon tied by an apple string.

The food was certainly interesting, creative, and delicious. We did the tasting menu, shared one wine pairing, and one non-alcohol pairing. The experience of the food was a bit dampened by the fact that as a later seating time, we were surrounded by people who all received the same dishes before us and overhead and saw everything that was yet to come. The service, although friendly and attentive, did not live up to expectations as our server tried to be cool and do a trick while pouring our drinks and ended up spilling on our clothes-  a definite no-no at this upscale, everyone-dresses-up, slightly stuffy dining environment. The non-alcoholic pairing was also a a bit of a disappointment and consisted of all sugary juices. (Although the sage infused cider was one of the best things of the night).

Alinea was able to accommodate our vegetarian diet and even asked for specifics such as if animal derived products (broths, gelatin, etc) would be ok.  Reservations are somewhat difficult to get, but if you plan ahead you can get exactly what you want. They release reservations 2 months in advance, on the 15th of the month at 11am central time.

2017-07-11,1.0,"First time dining at Alinea since remodel, second time dining here overall.  First experience was as perfect as a fine dining experience could possibly be - mind blowing even - dinner a couple of nights ago however was incredibly disappointing.  Evenings at restaurants of this caliber are often likened to a night at the theater: every dish and glass of wine is served with its own story; every move of the wait staff appears to be precisely choreographed; the sheer visual artistry of each course; exciting, unique textures and flavors. It only makes sense that establishments such as these would forego a typical reservation scheme in favor of a ticketing system... it is worth noting, however, that service (aka tip) is included in ticket price up front.  The attitudes of the wait staff were very clearly either unhappy to be there or simply indifferent.  Plates were brought out to each member of our party somewhat haphazardly - some of the nicer restaurants at casinos in Detroit manage to coordinate this better.  For several courses we were told nothing about the wine pairings.  For several courses our water glasses were empty.  The cuisine was remarkably underwhelming - the first course (""Spear"") tasted like Windex.  Constituent portions of subsequent courses were variously frozen, puréed and/or smoked; this certainly added to theatrics but didn't necessarily add anything positive to the dishes themselves.  After edible balloons were brought out copies of the word jumble/menu were placed on the table then we were ignored until we guessed it was time to leave.  The meal was an entirely unsatisfying procession of what seemed to be poorly executed gimmicks, each more disheartening than the last.  I have to think that our experience here was affected by the fact that Chef Achatz was in New York working on other projects, but admittedly this is mere conjecture.  Regardless we coordinated a trip across country and dropped $2,488.68 on dinner for four (plus two cookbooks) and it just was not good.  A year ago we had a similarly disappointing experience in Yountville but I couldn't bear to write that review.  No surprise then to see these restaurants continue to slip further down the World's Best list.  Think I'm going to finally give up on fine dining for good now.",0.2694,0.836,0.087,0.077,0.5256762566137567

When we have done tasting menu experiences previously, we have never felt rushed. The courses come well spaced. Both cannot be said about Alinea. Sure, the food was good, but I definitely felt that the service was rushed and the courses were not properly split up to give a break in consumption.  Now to the wine pairing. We selected the intermediate one, which cost $195 per person. One would have thought for that price that I would be stumbling out of the place or at the very least feel like I was satisfied. Both were not the case. Two others in our party - who are much more oenophiles than me - felt completely ripped off. The pours were incredibly modest. For 3x$195 we might as well have ordered directly from the wine list itself as we would have likely been much more satisfied. I am glad I finally dined at Alinea, but I do not feel a need to go back.

2017-07-03,4.0,"I think it's best to not read reviews, articles or watch any documentaries on Alinea or Chef Grant Achatz if you plan on attending this place. I knew enough but didn't want to research anymore because a place like this with all the accolades can set up really high expectations.  - Michelin Guide - 3 Stars - #15 in the World's 50 Best Restaurants - 2016 - Outstanding Restaurant in The United States, James Beard Foundation - 2016 This place is unique for sure and focuses on presentation and ""the show"" as it tries to confuse your senses and give you an experience.  They typically release bookings on the 15th of the month, two months in advance. Bookings are released at 11 AM Central Time. For our early June trip, my husband tried for a while to get reservations and ended up booking about 2 months ahead in The Salon @ Alinea. It's like buying a concert ticket for this place - you prepay for the experience and hope to god that you're feeling well and can make the trip there (if you're not from Chicago). There are 10-14 courses and the price is anywhere from $175-$255 per person. price includes food, service charge and taxes. In our very expensive Canadian $ conversion, that came to $640 CAD for two people. When you order a bottle of wine the night that you are dining, that is extra which of course is then another few hundred. So for Canadians if you order wine, expect that your total experience could be $400-$500 per person. Yes it is pricey. If you cancel ahead of time, your tickets are transferable to another visit but it's making the reservation that's the tough part. The dining room is quite surprisingly formal compared to the service and food. The servers are friendly and quite anal with service. While placing chopsticks for one course onto the chopstick rest, one stick fell off onto the table (not the floor) and the server took the set of chopsticks away and replaced the entire thing. LOL quite the overkill. Anyways, we enjoyed the sommelier, she was very knowledgeable and provided options that had a wide price range and didn't just push certain items. The meal lasted just over 2 hours with 10 courses so each course was roughly $32 CAD excluding the wine. Some items were better than others but overall I did enjoy my experience and it is something (if you are able to do) should try. The helium balloon was extremely fun, nostalgic and magical. We were to view the kitchen when we were leaving and man there are a ton of staff who work there and of course the serving staff.

2017-06-15,2.0,"Our visit to Alinea was extremely disappointing. This was the first ~$400pp meal we've had where we felt cheated and duped. There were a few high points but many, many more low points, and the lowest of lows included food that we could not even stomach to swallow. All the magic/whimsy and the immersive dining experience that Alinea is known for was missing. First of all, the ticketing system is pretty stressful. Pro tip if you decide to go against my advice and go to Alinea: look ahead at the two seating times and prices (which vary day to day), so you know exactly what you want when the ticketing system opens. The slots fill quickly. We bought tickets for a few hours after our flight arrived and stressed out about possibly missing our reservation. Onto the evening we ate at Alinea: it began with a lot of promise. We were led to a communal dining room with leaves on the floor and a delicious array of seafood items. One of the staff spoke to us as a group, but he was basically yelling at us for his voice to be able to reach to the other end of the long table. We were then led into the kitchen for a cooking demonstration and another course, which was interesting and tasty, and when we were taken back to the dining room, it had been transformed into tables and chairs. That was cool, and was followed by an amaaaazing corn soup with scallop noodles. But it went downhill from there. The next two courses triggered our gag reflexes, and I could not bear to finish mine. They were a sour coconut soup and an array of molecular gastronomy foods, including a jamon iberico foam and some soup of sorts with weird jellies in it. The texture and the tastes were disgusting and it got to the point where I feared bursting the jellies in my mouth lest they taste sour like vomit - sadly, that was what happened with almost every bite. Remembering that the meal cost ~$400, I begrudgingly forced myself to eat as much as I could. The next few courses were fish grilled over rosemary, short rib, and some other meat-based dishes that were good but sort of standard and not worth the price we paid for the meal. The desserts were more what we had expected (cherry flavored glass, banana helium balloons, the freeze dried ice cream), but it was still a bit lame. For example, there was a part where they turned off most of the lights and had loud music over the stereo while the staff took decorations off the wall to use as a plate, but you could see the stereo speakers all over the room.  The wine pairings were good but nothing too remarkable. All four of us were so disenchanted and let down by our experience.

Let me start by saying, that we tried to do the chef's table but it was sold out. So we opted for the 10-14 courses option.  The service was impeccable and the staff was super friendly. The servers were very informative and knowledgeable. The ambiance was pretty, we sat in a quiet room upstairs. It was simple, and nothing extravagant.  Now the food. After watching Alinea's episode on Chef's Table, watching online videos, browsing through their galleries...I had really high hopes. My expectations were high, but Alinea built those up for me. So course after course, as I was tasting each dish, I was disappointed. Many of the items I couldn't swallow down. There was no wow factor. Everything was so simple. One of the courses was just a simple broth. I understand that the techniques and preparations aren't simple, and time demanding - but this isn't what I came here for. Where is the wow factor? What Alinea presented on Chef's Table, and what we experienced, wasn't the same restaurant.  I really didn't like anything until the desserts. The dessert were delicious, but no wow factor. For one of the desserts, the restaurant used bubblegum Dippin' Dots. How is that fresh or life changing? You don't pay a few hundred dollars per person for Dippin' Dots. Safe to say, I was so disappointed. The only wow factor was the balloon. And that was it.  As I was browsing through their reviews, it seems like many people are saying the same thing. I'm sure when the chef was working for his stars a few years ago, the food was out of this world and so was the presentation. Since winning his stars, and beginning new projects - it seems like there is no passion left here.

She informed us when those dates would go on sale and I marked it on my calendar. When the time came I went to purchase tickets for the gallery experience and they were already sold out. I copied and pasted past communication last with Katie and emails Alinea again to explain the situation and we followed instructions to book our tickets and they are already sold out. They contacted me back and said only the salon dinner was available and that's 10-14 courses.  We figured it was better than nothing at all and bought our tickets.. Alinea contacted us asking for food allergies and if we were celebrating anything in particular. We informed them we are celebrating something special and we are driving down from Michigan just for this dinner.  I have been following Grants work long before chefs table episode and his stars... This dinner was such a big deal for me as I have always looked up to his work that I have read about. Equipment like roto-vaps, and other uses of techniques I have admired.  Upon arriving at Alinea, I told my wife jokingly, I hope they don't give us the bare minimum of courses, but guess what, you did give us the bare minimum...  10 courses, They were as followed:  Ice, crunch, contrast, thai coconut, yellow, glass, bean, toast, rock, nostalgia. Why advertise 10-14 course when you already know you're going to give us the minimum. It's a marketing ploy that's why.  The only ""experimental moment"" we had received was when our server poured water into dry ice for our apple parm ice course.  I asked our captain if I could meet Grant and he said ""he's at Next tonight for his Hollywood themed dinner, but if he was here, he doesn't meet with customers"" Such a huge disappointment...  Before we left, I asked our captain if I could see downstairs before we left. He took us downstairs and made my wife and I stand flat up against the wall as to not get in anyone's way. We were not even in the door way of the kitchen, rather just before it.. I see Mike B. and he stops and stairs at us. He's standing there with his legs spread apart arms crossed just staring at us as if he wanted to destroy us.. My wife asked ""why is he standing there like that?"" ""To lighten the mood I whispered to my wife ""probably to leave room for his huge Schlong to get some air"".. The captain then ushered us to the front door and said ""he's really not as bad as you think once you get to know him"".  For the love of everything Holy Mike, say hello. We were fans not enemies.  We drove all the way from Michigan to see you guys and enjoy your creations. We went back to our hotel feeling so down about the entire dinner.  I have studied Grants flavor bouncing techniques so I won't speak on specifics of flavor profiles in some of the dishes as taste is subjective.. I respect all he has accomplished, but that doesn't change the fact of what took place that night.  If there was one word to describe our experience at Alinea, that would be ""cheated"". We felt so cheated..  No one went the extra mile, everything was standard and bare minimum.  With travel, food, hotel and parking, I spent close to 1500 just to come to Chicago and dine with you.  I had brought my Alinea book thinking Grant would sign it, but he doesn't meet with customers or fans.  I left the book in my hotel room in Chicago. Maybe someone else will enjoy it.  I know I'm not wrong with the way I feel about this. I have read other reviews on Yelp that are pretty much the way I feel as of late. It's clear Grant has moved on from Alinea and is focused on other projects.. Which explains the experience we had. Alinea is obviously a cash cow that's being run on Auto pilot more or less.

I made my boyfriend buy tickets the second they went on sale, anticipating the best dining experience I would enjoy in this lifetime. I expected the food to be innovative and interesting. I also expected that I would not necessarily enjoy everything, but I didn't expect what happened. The meal didn't start out well. I ordered a glass of wine and my boyfriend ordered a beer. I understand beer may not be the drink of choice for such a meal, but he brews beer and it is what he enjoys drinking. The sommelier overturned the beer into the glass and poured an entire glass of foam. If you don't want to serve beer, do not put it on the menu, but what happened was unacceptable at any restaurant, never-mind one of this caliber.  I should have prefaced this by saying that my parents had dined at Alinea less than a year before and raved about it. We all eat out quite a bit and are what you could consider ""food snobs."" Since my parents had excellent things to say, I thought the meal would be worth the price. However, we were fed course after course of disappointing food.  I have to say that we were served mostly vegetables. There was very little food of substance and I left the restaurant slightly hungry, which I would have thought inconceivable for the amount of money we paid.  The only food of substance was a piece of pork belly (90% of which was fat). I understand this is a fatty food by nature, but I have had much better pork belly at many restaurants across the country. There was also rabbit that was hard to identify as such.  There were some notably horrible moments. We were served the hot potato/cold potato dish, which was served in a wax bowl. The fragility and material of the bowl was not well explained and my boyfriend ended up ingesting a large piece of wax. To say that it did not pair well with hot and cold potatoes would be an understatement. The server was not particularly contrite about this incident.  The helium balloon was also another sour moment. The first balloon that was brought to my boyfriend had a large hole in it that was clearly visible so it deflated immediately. The waiter insisted that he had simply not eaten it quickly enough and grudgingly brought another.  There was also one course that included pieces of hamachi next to a ""campfire."" I have to say that it wasn't even close to the best piece of yellowtail I've ever had. I expected everything to be the best of the best.  We ate at Joe's Steak and Stone Crab later in our vacation and everything we ate during that meal was better than one single thing we ate during the course of our meal at Alinea. That does not add up to me. Joe's is fantastic but I thought Alinea would be the best meal of my life.  I felt as though we were being punked or had checked the vegan option by mistake, that was how poor the meal was. When I look back on the money we spent, I am horrified and saddened.  I have to say that I would never recommend this restaurant to another human being and that upon hearing of our experience, my parents said they will never go back. At the price, it is not worth the risk of a horrible meal.",0.9664,0.824,0.101,0.074,0.4441558441558442

As a sort of grand farewell to one of my favorite cities in the world, I decided to bring a couple of my closest friends to an evening at the legendary Alinea. I walked in the inconspicuous front door, expecting the same quiet intimacy that other restaurants of this caliber seemed to provide. Not so - the chatter and buzz was lively and guests enjoyed their shared memories of the unique experience. The layout of the restaurant is modern. My party ascended the stairs up to the Salon area, arriving at the seats that we had to book months in advance. The staff approached and provided fun conversation similar to how a grand performance has an MC. Except this was much more intimate. I won't spoil the dinner but I will say that you should be prepared to be dazzled, surprised, and enlightened. My particular tasting menu had an Asian spin on it, but the elements of sci-fi definitely shown through.

We went to the aviary for drinks before hand, I had my makeup professionally done, and spent nearly half a paycheck on 1 dress because this was going to be the fanciest dinner of my 24 year old life. I was very disappointed with the drink options, it was pretty much buy the wine add on for another couple hundred, or drink water, and since neither of us enjoy wine, we went with water. I felt like the food tried so hard to push boundaries that it lost sight of actually tasting good. I'm pretty adventurous with food and will eat anything except cole slaw, so when I say the two of the courses were straight up nasty, I mean it. One was this little cube of what I can only assume was jellofied sardine oil. It was awful. Another one was just one bite but it was so overwhelming it left me with like feeling that I had eaten an entire bag of lays potato chips in one bite.

HELL YES!  If it is within your means I would highly recommend springing for Alinea's most personal experience.  I booked the Kitchen Table on a whim for our cousins reunion, and, honestly, was blown away.  There's a reason why Alinea's accolades and reputation precedes it.  The meal was an entire experience from beginning to end; watching the almost meditative zen of the kitchen prep; chef Achatz in action (we even got a photo of our group with him...sorry for being those people); the super cool and down to earth wait staff; and no detail was spared to customize our own unique dining experience.  One of my favorite moments was when they plated the famous ""paint"" dessert.  Our server pulled out a ladder and took down a piece of the art hanging from the ceiling that would serve as our dessert plate.  Chef Achatz came and finished everything off by crushing the last liquid nitro concoction into a million pieces for the finale.  That was awesome and amazing, but it was the littlest details that truly made it special; the fact that they turned off ALL of the lights in the kitchen during dessert plating leaving everyone working in the dark and played an amped up song about cousins to highlight our ""cousins reunion"" that I'd included in our reservation notes.   It was an experience that will not be soon forgotten.

First of all, appearance wise, the renovations were beautiful but I miss walking in to sights of the kitchen! The energy and brightness were palpable in 2012.  Service was OK. My servers were very knowledgeable. One of them was dicking around a tad too much for a Michelin starred restaurant. My sommelier was swift and knowledgeable but I loved my sommelier from five years ago.  As for the food.... I remember being served food on pillows of fragranced air, eating without utensils, and using more of my senses. This time around I actually felt like I was at a restaurant. Eating a meal. I paid for an experience! A show! My server even agreed with me that my first experience was more of an art show and this was a meal. Anyway, the flavors were alright. For some reason they did not meld well with me. The Thai inspired dish was pretty delicious. The langoustine noodles were also delicious. Bubble yum dessert was less than satisfying but I'm not a bubble gum fan. I feel like every course that I tried in 2012 was out of this world. This time around I left food on the plate.  Lastly, I wanted to experience an elegant dinner. I looked around and I saw a man and woman in casual street clothes CHOMPING DOWN on their food. It was disgusting.

My most memorable experience was the moment when a balloon was brought to us, exactly the way as shown in the episode. Carefully grabbed, and sip a hole in the center, deep breath, and speak! Yes, hearing myself in a different voice was indeed fascinating. Grant was just a genius! My favorite dish, on the other hand, was that seared bone marrow - sitting nicely on a small rice cracker, the bone marrow was not at all greasy while somehow maintained its own softness. Such a delightful bite! I guess started from today, I have officially updated my favorite place for bone marrow (used to be Casa Mono). Food always came secondary, once you realized how difficult Grant has come through his recovery from the cancer, and that was precisely the reason I loved Alinea so much.

Although, ever dish had it's own highlights i was really hoping that we would get to try the famous sugar balloons and luckily on this night we were treated with a banana helium taffy balloon which in and of it's self is a special dish.

2017-02-26,5.0,"How can I not give these fine folks five stars?  This was simply the most outrageous and over-the-top dining experience ever in my life.  The levels of presentation and production are unlike anything I could have expected, no matter how many times I've watched their Netflix special. I don't want to spoil the experience by taking readers here through every step of the meal.  Just know that if you select the intermediate experience known as ""The Gallery,"" you've got between 16 and 18 of the most diverse and wonderfully crafted courses that a restaurant will put in front of you.  And buckle up, because they keep you flush with nourishment for the better part of three hours. I did select the standard wine pairing and was beyond satisfied.  Everything we drank was excellent, specifically the Bollinger champagne to start the night off, and the Jamsheed Syrah later in the meal.   As for the food, every course is meticulously assembled and presented in very unique ways.  Fire, fog, and art pieces integrated throughout the meal are just some of the inventive methods used to augment each element of the culinary experience.  It is all tastefully and seamlessly integrated into the evening.  And the flavors?  You can't help but be absolutely blown away. If I had any criticism, it would be in the last third of the meal.  We were presented with a short rib dish that was the most intensely flavored food I have ever encountered personally.  It was very good, but I felt absolutely washed over with the taste.  Again, not bad; just intense.  From there, the desserts started to flow in and things became almost saccharine sweet.  It was just too much to digest and was mostly paired with an equally sweet Moscato d'Asti.  If you saw the final dessert dish, you'd understand why we could barely make a dent in it even if we wanted to.  Still, it was all top quality; just not how I would have preferred to finish things off.  I could have stopped three to five courses from the end and still been completely satisfied. There was, however, one other element that arguably trumps the food.  That's the staff. These men and women are absolutely first-class.  There were so many players throughout the night, that I probably can't account for all of them.  Forgive me on any spelling errors, but I must recognize Kalen, Devin, Michael (sommelier), Bronson, Quincy, John, Tim (the original host with wild hair), Yuweh, and Brian.  These kind people made our experience so great!  They were all so personable and took absolutely great care of not just us, but also everyone in the room. What I would recommend is playing back a little with the staff.  I'm not talking about being disruptive, just show them a little character and humor.  They're super down to earth.  Imagine some of the stodgy characters they must come up against in this joint.  Trust me, the more candor and good humor you show them, the more they'll play back and help you enjoy this most exquisite experience. Is it expensive?  No question.  Is it worth it?  Absolutely.  Zero regrets. Pony up the cash, strap in, and get ready for a dining experience that only a select few people on this earth will ever encounter.  What Chef Achatz and his remarkable team have created here is nothing short of astounding.  I meant what I said when I described it as ""the most outrageous and over-the-top dining experience ever in my life.""  It is just that.  But my God is it cool.   It's no wonder many pundits in the culinary industry consider Alinea to be among the finest restaurants in the entire world.  There's nothing else quite like it.

When we were finally able to get a table for 2 in the Gallery, I couldn't believe it. We dined there Sunday night at the 5p.m seating. Like everyone else says, from the moment you walk in until the moment you leave you feel like you're in another world. The atmosphere and the ambiance is chic and calm. The waitstaff is professional, charming, and funny. It's not at all stuffy or uncomfortable. All the food is fresh, the absolute highest of quality, and combines flavors and senses that you never thought possible. Spoiler alert, for the second course you get the privilege and honor of going IN the kitchen, what an absolute treat to see the behind the scenes work! I will say what I appreciated most was the pace of the evening. We've done other tasting dinners that have lasted 5, almost 6 hours. All of the courses at Alinea were perfectly timed, and they gave us plenty of time at the end to sit and enjoy a cup of tea. We left around 8:15, and didn't feel overly stuffed. All the courses are so memorable, it's almost impossible to pick a favorite. In terms of the flavors and presentation I may say that dessert was my favorite, so be sure to save room!

2017-02-13,5.0,"My friends and I had the good fortune to reserve the Kitchen Table for dinner on a Sunday evening. We all chose the mid-level wine tier for pairing, which was the one thing I think I was disappointed in. The choices were wonderful, high-quality producers and varietals, but I personally am not a fan of sherry or sake, so a few of the offerings were just lost on me. We are all well-versed in wine and felt that choosing bottles over a tiered tasting would have been better, but it would have been tough to appropriately pair the wines without knowing the menu and flavor profiles in advance.  As for dinner...I don't even know where to start, lol. Everything was amazing, from the moment we arrived to the moment we departed. The service was attentive and relaxed- far from the pretentious impression I was given by some of the other reviews I read. The staff joked with us, took the time to explain what we were trying, and what made each dish unique.  I don't even want to spoil the surprise and fun by going into more depth regarding the food, lol. Only one item was unanimously disliked, the rest were well above expectation. Chef Achatz was kind enough to take a moment to greet us and have a photo taken with our group- many thanks to him! His staff is clearly as well-trained, creative and detail-oriented as he is. Tips? No need to dress to the nines...we chose ""business casual"" and were quite comfortable. I'm not sure the Kitchen Table experience warranted the additional cost, as the other diners seemed to receive the same items and attentive service, but being able to let loose without worrying about disturbing other diners was a nice touch. If you have a rowdy group, it might be worth the expenditure. I was a bit intimidated by the prospect of spending almost $2k per couple on a dinner, but I have to say that it was worth it.

2017-02-12,5.0,"A night at Alinea is more than just about the food. It truly is an experience, from the moment you step in the door to the moment you leave. As soon as we stepped inside, we were greeted by 3-4 people who took our coats and brought us to the table. The decor is modern and clean. Throughout the whole night, we had 3-4 waiters roaming around at our service. They were all entertaining in their own way and one guy in particular was quite a hoot. They all looked like they loved their job which definitely helps enhance the dining experience. It was a 11 course meal and while I'm not going to describe all of them, I can tell you that all of them were amazing in their own way (with the exception of one but probably because I don't like cheese in general). Every course is innovative and exceptional in both presentation and flavor. Every dish is different and exciting in their own way, some which you can't even figure out how to eat without a description from the waiter. Some of the highlights of the evening included condensed strawberry desert with bubble gum ice cream and cherry ""glass"" which was a perfect end to the evening with an ice cold desert prepared likely with liquid nitrogen. The other dessert themed around chocolate and ""rocks"" was almost as good and even prettier to look at. The Thai-inspired coconut shellfish broth with pompano was probably the best dish of the night and one of the best I've ever had even though I don't typically like coconut flavors. Just stunning. The wagyu short rib with bitter cocoa sauce was incredible. As with a lot of the dishes, it truly is tough to put the flavor into words. This is one of those you have to try for yourself to really understand the flavors. The prettiest plate of the night (perhaps in a tie with the ""rocks"" dessert) was the maitake mushroom dish with a duo of sauces made based around blueberry and lapsang souchong (a Chinese black tea). The best smelling dish of the night goes to the corn soup with scallop ""paper"" which had an aroma to die for. They dehydrated scallops into papers which were re-hydrated into noodles when the hot corn soup was poured over it, amazing! It's definitely expensive (the most expensive meal I've ever had) but it's worth every last penny with the overall experience that's provided. This is obviously only for a special occasion for the vast majority of people, but I highly recommend it.",0.9979,0.783,0.193,0.024,0.6196325051759835

They wrote me back to tell me that they take complaints ""very seriously"" then never responded back months later. Don't waste your money. To whom it may concern, On December 7th, 2016, my girlfriend and I visited the Alinea Gallery for a much anticipated experience.  We had seen Grant Achatz on Chef's Table, Spinning Plates and several interviews; needless to say, we were very excited.  They initially sat us at a group table for the first course.  For an $800 tab I expected a private, secluded table with private service.  The first course was terrible.  The egg souffle was bland, the pickled lobster and truffles were just not our preference.   They then moved us to the kitchen for the second course.  Again, same complaint, we didn't need to see the kitchen and it seemed tacky.  Next, we ordered a Cabernet, they served us a Bordeaux without asking us if that was ok; it tasted nothing like a Cab. They then sat us down at a private table for the third course.  From this point on, we were extremely disappointed.  I'm afraid to say, without exaggerating, that neither of us like one bite one of course.  It was all overwhelmed with, what we think was, sassafras.  It was a sort of pungent licorice taste.  We tasted this strange flavor in almost every dish.  It was all odd and off-putting. We also expected more elaborate gastronomy experimenting.  We've seen the balloon in documentaries, which was an odd fake banana flavor, and the ice cream, which tasted like freezer burned dip-n-dots (no offense intended, that's the only parallel I can draw). I don't like to write reviews and I certainly don't mean to offend.  But, our disappointment in this experience bordered on depressing.  We were dumbfounded.  I just felt compelled to provide you with some feedback.",-0.9781,0.808,0.058,0.133,0.4267013888888889

When people ask me what my favorite restaurant experience anywhere is, I always say Alinea because it is ""fun"". I was reminded that this was because of the great staff. The food is *exceptional*. Everything looks beautiful. On the ""menu"" card each course is described by a single word. It's then presented and carefully explained. The courses are also playful. They asked me not to cheat and look at other tables to peek and see what is coming ahead. But then of course the couple to my right would look over from time to time when food was brought to my table. They were several courses ahead, and wanted photos of the courses being served...and the magic that happens. We'd chat about what courses I would expect to see next, etc. I felt like a kid filled with anticipation...and they were giddy watching others experience what they had discovered only minutes before as well. Like I said, it is a lot of fun. The staff called and took note of my allergies several days before the visit. The menu was slightly adjusted to meet my constraints. I didn't feel like I experienced anything drastically different from anyone else in the restaurant. That made it pretty nice. Obviously the menu had changed since my last visit. There's no point in my going into specific dishes because I think others will want to experience for themselves, but also because the items might be different by the time they visit the restaurant  themselves.

It's rare to find a place that is conscientious of gelatin, etc. This is all to say that the kitchen here is incredibly accommodating and will work with you to address your specific dietary needs. It's not like they just took out the meat, either. The substitutions made it such that my dining partner and I were able to experience similar flavors and textures throughout the meal.  Speaking of flavors, I have never experienced some of those tastes before. I don't even know how to describe some of the dishes to my friends because the combinations were that unique.

Dining options are broken down to 3 tiers, THE SALON ($175-$225), THE GALLERY ($295-$345), THE KITCHEN TABLE ($385).  The sliding scale prices correlate with popular times and days.  You make your booking online and by booking I mean buy your non refundable but transferable tickets.  We made a reservation for 4 at the least popular day and time and we paid $980 - this is for the salon meal, tax, and tip.  We decided while we were at the restaurant to do the wine pairing, again we chose the lowest tier for $115.  Total with tax and tip for the wine pairing was about $620.  All in all, this was a $400 per person dinner.  And when you're paying that much money you expect the place to stuffy and snobby.  But no, the staff were all friendly, personable, knowledgeable, and some were even funny. I'm not going to break down the 14 courses and explain each dish in detail.  Ain't nobody got time for that.  What I will say is that I was thoroughly impressed.  The food was so creative and innovative.  Out with your conventional perception of what food should look and taste like.   This is an experience.  An art show.  No detail too small.",0.9783,0.837,0.11,0.053,0.6160449735449736

Out of all our courses, there was only one that we didn't like (contrast/españa).  My favorites were ice (tropical flavors topped with trout roe), crunch/paper (sea scallop paper with corn broth), and bone (crunchy bone marrow puffed rice with wagyu beef).   If you have the chance to get here, do it!",0.9636,0.801,0.147,0.052,0.6252840909090909

2017-01-17,5.0,"I could write about Alinea for pages and pages, but it doesn't mean I should. To be straight to the point: this place is phenomenal, the best restaurant I've ever been to, and it deserves each of its Michelin stars. The only other restaurants I've been to that come even remotely close are Gary Danko and State Bird Provisions in San Francisco. Each course was unique and truly delectable. The service was beyond attentive and pleasant. The restaurant is gorgeous. I'm still looking for a place where I can buy another bottle of the wine I had. It really comes down to this: if you can afford to, go. I was fortunate that I was invited to go there, otherwise I wouldn't have been able to justify the cost. Now that I've been, I'm eager to go back with my wife on a (very, very, very) special occasion. Caveats: like others have said, if you're a picky eater, this won't be a good option. None of the ingredients were ""crazy,"" especially if you've been to similar ""high-end"" restaurants. But since you don't get to pick your food, you have to be willing to go with the flow.

The stars must have aligned for me because I was able to get tickets....on my birthday.  I could go on detail about the ticketing/reservation process etc....but I must say it is an experience!  1) service: The staff there is AMAZING. As soon as you walk in, they are there to grab your coat, lead you to your table, lead you to the bathroom etc. They are so knowledgeable for all the tiny details of the 13+ courses you are about to eat. They are all so friendly and witty. I found them fricking hilarious. I'm pretty sure I told them that too.  2) ambience- It's actually pretty cozy and super chill. I didnt feel like this was some stuffy,boring restaurant. The staff also added to that 3) Food- wow. You read the reviews, see pictures. It just doesnt do the experience justice. Also, even though the portions are on the smaller side because there are 13+ of them, you leave stuffed. The details,tastes, and the aromas from the dishes that Chef Achatz and his staff create are mindblowing. They are very accomodating to food allergies and dietary restrictions. One of my friends had a seafood allergy and she didnt feel like she missed out at all. This restaurant is $$$ but worth every penny in my opinion.

I do expect outstanding service, but was disappointed by our meal. I've eaten at all Michelin restaurants in Paris. I wasn't impressed by their tasting menu at all and not a single dish included caviar which is a sin in my book. I didn't find any food items to be very memorable in flavoring.

2017-01-09,2.0,"I was a little skeptical at first to write this review because I really didn't want to write negative comments about such a known restaurant. But I definitely have a need to give my 2 cents on this experience.  First off, the service is exceptional. They take your coat upon arrival and provide you with a 100% cashmere pashmina if you'd like. You feel like royalty that's for sure! 5 stars on service.  The reason why I decided to give this place 2 stars is because, the food is very very different. Not in a good way. How can I explain this? The menu is a surprise, so the description for each course is just one word. Like: Yellow, or Crunchy. The idea is to keep you guessing through out the night as to what you're going to get. One thing, if you are a picky eater this place is NOT for you. If you don't like surprises, this place is NOT for you. When the waiters would bring the dishes and explained what was in them, I barely understand 1/4th of what it was. These are things I had never tried before or heard of before for that matter.    I love food, so does my husband. But I can tell you that I honestly think this was a waste of my money. It's extremely expensive just for food, and wine pairings will cost you just as much as the food itself. The presentations are unlike anything I've ever seen before. Amazing presentation and the scents on some of these things really got you into the theme of what you were eating. But the food itself was just too weird. To each their own and I'm sure there are multiple people who extremely love it. But my husband and I weren't part of that group, unfortunately. It's a huge mix of different types of foods, which can be a little detrimental to your stomach lol.  Wine pairing: exquisite wines. They give you three options on wine pairings and we chose the Middle option which was the reserved wines. I did notice a lot of people around us didn't really opt for that option though, but I do think the wines were amazing. With the exception of a Sake we had at one point which felt like I was drinking 100% rubbing alcohol.  Over all, it's definitely an experience. But it's an experience I could live without. It takes MONTHS to get a reservation here and of course we were both so excited to have gotten one, but we left extremely disappointed. I wish I would've gone to Giordano's pizza instead and maybe have saved all that money. This was definitely not a place for me. :(  Side note: the place has no sign with a name so it's going to be a little hard to find. I suggest you google how it looks outside so you recognize it when you arrive.",0.9845,0.838,0.115,0.047,0.5344570707070706
2017-01-09,4.0,"My first Michelin rated restaurant! (A 3-star one at that too!) I have first heard about Alinea because of pictures of their unique food presentations plus their famous edible balloons. I was a bit worried that their  renovations in 2016 would mean big changes to the food, but don't worry, the balloons are still there! I decided to go with the Salon which is their lowest tier with 10-14 courses since  this would be our first 3-star restaurant, and not sure if we would be acclimated to the food of that tier. Street parking in the area seemed okay (beware some locations require permits), but otherwise valet is available for $14. You could easily walk past the restaurant without knowing it since the building is  nondescript with only a minimal sign on the sidewalk. Once you past the front door, the front desk is very accommodating, including taking care of coats (think they are stored in heated closets) and any transportation needs. At the start of the meal, one of the servers will place a placard outlining the courses so you can follow along. Alinea is known for their deconstruction of food that follows simple themes like ice, stone, bone, etc. I think the best example is the 'nostalgia' theme where they took a cake and separated flavors that you would associate with your childhood apart like strawberry, banana, etc. Among the 13 courses, the wagyu/short-rib (bone) was heavenly. I never hard such a thick cut before and the sauce is so scrumptious. I would say there are ~3 courses that I wasn't fond of due to a more vinegar/sour taste (prefer more sweeter food), but I'll attribute that to not being acclimated to those type of dishes. Many of the courses comes with a neat effect ranging from dried scallops that melts into the broth to a dried ice smoke gushing out a bowl. I especially love the fruity aromatics that helps accentuate the course. Be sure to come up with a 10 second phrase to be recorded when the balloon comes out! If nothing comes to mind, singing happy birthday works! One thing that I appreciated for an upscale restaurant is how chill everything was. The only dress code is that men were requested to wear jackets (but definitely not required). You could get wine by the bottle or by the glass and sounds like they also have beer. All of our waiters were pretty friendly and don't mind taking pictures. You may consider bringing a DSLR like I did due to the low lighting (I ended up shooting at ISO 8000). All-in-all I had a good time and would come back to try the Gallery experience. Pro-tip: Make your reservations early (pref one month in advance)! One cool thing is you pay everything up-front, including tip so the only bill you may have to pay in the end are for the drinks. On the other hand, that does mean all sales are final. Alinea will contact you one week ahead of your reservation to ask for allergies and other accommodations so make sure to put in a valid e-mail address/phone number!",0.9975,0.799,0.16,0.041,0.5541418650793651

It took quite a lot of effort to get the reservation. We set this as first priority and in order to book the flight from LAX to Chicago for our dining experience.  Overall the 12 courses of experience did not fail us at all.  Although we arrived little late due to the snow, and yes, it was below zero that day snowing when we had our dinner reservation.  The whole experience is definitely worth it.  I think posting photos just doesn't do full justice because every dish is more than visual effect, also other senses, especially smell and sense of wonder of what we get in a dish and multiple ingredient on our palate when we taste each dish. We have the wine pairing meal and the place is so low key from outside but it's just broaden up once you are inside.  As much to describe every dish, I decide just to present all the dish-theme.  The rest you'll have to discovered on your own once you are there.  No doubt the service is excellent and not any less.  We thoroughly enjoy our meals as truly an theatrical experience as it be.  Theme of dishes are listed as follows: Ice Crunch paper Contrast espana swirl thai dish/thai character yellow branch , glass toast bone smoke rock nostalgia The display and plate setting of each dish is so creative , keep your eyes wonder like a child.

2016-12-28,5.0,"**MY 200TH REVIEW!!** Alinea is a dining experience that is defined more by the journey than the actual taste of the food.  But when the experience is as beautiful and mind blowing as it is here, the few missteps in the food are easy to forgive. From all the foodie lists and conversations with my foodie friends, Alinea was always heavily discussed and recommended making it easily on the top of my bucket list of places to eat.  Therefore, when I was gratefully and humbly gifted the opportunity to eat at Alinea from a person who is incredibly generous and amazing, I was more than ecstatic.   Scoring the reservation during the short window in which I was going to be in Chicago was a big worry.  Considering the odd times it is actually open (Wednesday through Sunday for 5:30-9:30) the actual times I could go during my visit was very narrow.  Thankfully, my friend realized that they tend to open slots in two month increments around the 15th of the month.  Another helpful way is to follow their Twitter or Facebook page which updates on openings.   There are several dining options that vary by number of courses and number of people.  I was fortunate enough to dine at the Gallery which is their 16 course offering perhaps their most fully developed experience especially with just two people.  From the beginning to end, each course was incredibly thoughtful and playful that incorporated unique elements that mostly exceeded my already high expectations.  It was an interactive experience with waiters who carefully explained each dish.  As I mentioned earlier, there were several courses that may have looked visually stunning, but in terms of taste a little bit of a let down.  However, each course built on the last letting you experience food in ways you never really thought were possible. The service here was top-notch.  Very attentive to our needs and super great about explaining all the different aspects of the food, the wait staff did not disappoint.  Unlike other restaurants, when you book your experience, the tip is already included in the price.  This makes the end of the meal all the more seamless - less about figuring out how much to tip and leaving the restaurant stress free.  While there was valet available, most of the people seemed to take Uber or taxi over. Overall, Alinea is a unique one of a kind eating experience that easily sits near the top of my most memorable dining experiences that I can only thank my friend who made this all possible.",0.9956,0.819,0.165,0.016,0.5594080145719489

2016-12-05,4.0,"The group I went with spent the weekend trying to figure out our assessment of Alinea.  We'd all been looking forward to the experience but ultimately left dissatisfied and unable to pinpoint exactly why.  For my husband and I, the molecular gastronomy and artistry of playing with the delivery and presentation of the food, as well as the environment in which you eat it, was truly a unique experience. Something that we likely would only get at Alinea. The staff was obviously knowledgeable about the dishes - but the HOW the dishes were made and the WHY the dishes were presented as they were was what we were truly interested in and the information that came with the delivery was very short on this. We learned far more about this watching the Alinea episode on Chef's Table than during our actual experience eating at Alinea.  [Side note: I highly recommend anyone thinking about going here to watch Chef's Table (Netflix) first-- I think it helped me/my group appreciate the experience at a level we would not otherwise have done just going here cold.] Otherwise, the food was disappointing. The presentation was great, but the food itself wasn't.  I had high expectations-- which I think were reasonable based on the press, michelin stars, Chef's Table, and eating at other wonderful establishments as well as from reading Alinea's cookbook.  I thought: (1)  I would get to eat lots of interesting and playful things. What they served was delicious, but there wasn't as much variety or uniqueness in the actual food as I would have expected.  There was a lot of fish in the courses we had. I've had pork belly that has been better cooked.  Again- presentation was awesome, but this wasn't the greatest culinary experience I've had. (2) Portion sizes would be perfect.  I've been to many places serving a set menu with multiple courses.  I was shocked at how big some of the courses at Alinea were-- and I left feeling incredibly full (which I don't like-- but how could I not eat everything?).  Some people in my group stopped eating towards the end--  it was just too much.  My entire group agreed we would have appreciated less of most of the dishes so that we could have enjoyed all of the dishes more. (3) We would have an appropriate dessert.  Instead, the last 3 courses (of 14) were all desserts!!!  It was too much.  We would have much preferred more entree type dishes. (4) Coffee served during dessert.  We were asked about our coffee orders around the first dessert course.  When the second course came we asked when we would actually get the coffee and were told ""during dessert"".  We didn't actually receive coffee until after the desserts were done.  At that point, we all felt that we should be leaving since they were clearly preparing for the next service, so we didn't enjoy it. My last note is that Alinea could have helped us prepare for a better experience.  Almost immediately when we sat down we were offered a truffle dish that would cost $125 (or $150) per person-- and that the entire table needed to be all in or not.  For at least one couple in our party, that was an awkward question; it would have been nicer if we had that information in advance to discuss rather than feeling put on the spot to make a ~$300 decision per couple.  While we can afford to eat here, this isn't going to be something we do more than once a year. Immediately after that question was the question about the wine pairings.  Again, it would have been helpful to know (perhaps it is online, but I can't find it) that there were three options in advance, about what the options were, what kinds of wines would likely be served (what the theory or experience goal is with that option) and a price range for the options (the range was something like $215 to $419 per person).  However, for this, they were willing to accommodate different people getting different options. I debated about what rating to provide.  Regardless of the number, I'd said I thought I had high expectations- which I think were completely reasonable- and Alinea didn't deliver.  And it was  too expensive an experience not to have.",0.9978,0.839,0.131,0.03,0.49118153364632244

2016-11-26,3.0,"I have been wanting to check this place out for a few years now. It has been ranked as one of the top restaurants in the world so we decided to celebrate our 14th anniversary here. My rating for this place comes with highly critical expectations and rightfully so. I have been to Charlie Trotters, Tru, 42 Grams, Duomo (Sicily), Europea (Montreal) and other ultra fine dining places here and abroad and I honestly cannot say that Alinea takes the top spot in my dining list. If your exposure to this dining category is minimal to none, you might say that this is the best dining experience ever. Otherwise, you might think it would be at par to some, better than other or even worse than some. I had a good experience not a WOW experience. We paid 250 pp without drinks and we were seated on the second floor. The moment I sat down, against the wall I felt the seat was a bit low and uncomfortable. As minor as this is, it sets the tone for rest of your dining experience. Trout/coconut/passion fruit - interesting scallop/nori - super yum Sanma fish - I am a seafood lover and this one I did not consume, it just didn't taste right. the presentation was superb. cider/orange/maple... - good pork belly - fantastic but anyone can make this dish taste good. pear/paprika/jamon - i already forgot this mastic concorde - if this is the one with the foie grois then it was outstanding black truffle/gruyere - this one was truly divine Wagyu - so so so good! Short rib - delish desserts - well done Although the servings were very small, I thought it was enough. Im glad we did not order the soup that was the special for the day 120 USD for a bowl of soup because at the end of meal, I couldn't even finish my dessert Service is good to very good. We had some dietary restrictions against refined sugar and the email communication was very efficient. Just like most places that charge a lot, it can be a bit pretentious. I have to say that the service was more casual than refined elegance. There were a few flaws like they refilled my sparkling water with flat water. They tried to take my dish even when I was not done (twice). We mentioned our anniversary in our email and there was no acknowledgement of it in any way shape or form. A bit disappointing. All in all it was a good experience. Was it worth the money? Sure. Would I recommend it? Absolutely! Would I be back? Not unless someone else is paying the bill.",0.9978,0.758,0.208,0.034,0.5449303530936185
2016-11-24,1.0,"TOTALLY NOT WORTH THE MONEY. VERY DISAPPOINTING. TOTAL JOKE! I want to say these words out loud so many times after having a chance to experience the wholly expensive tasting menu at The Alinea !!! I couldn't believe myself after waiting for 3 months and finally be able to sit and have their tasting menu & wine pairings ($295 for the meal +$215 domestic/intenational wine) PLUS tax PLUS 20%service charge at The Galeria, that this is THE WORST experience I've ever had among all other 3 Michelin-starred restaurants in the country that I've been to. Having a very expensive meal at 3 Michelin-starred restaurant, without any doubts, everyone's expectation is the service, meal & beverages and the overall experience should be SUPERB. Sadly, it did not happen at The Alinea. First of all, the guy who was in charged of pouring the wine, was not friendly at all and the worst thing was, every single bottle of wine that he poured to my glass was only a sip size of volume. I've finished every single wine before the food came, therefore, I totally don't think I've experienced the ""Food and Wine Pairings"" at The Alinea.  Secondly, the menu was laid out on a piece of paper with about 12 different unique names, just their way to try to surprise and impress us with the food they will serve, without giving out all the details about the descriptions of the dish. Unfortunately, every SINGLE dish that came to our table DID NOT impress us. At. All. Zero. For a three Michelin-starred restaurant at least I'd expect there would be at least caviar, lobster, abalone in one of the dish. What we got was mostly cheap ingredients! A total joke! All dish was served in a tiny portion with mostly sweet, creamy sauce and among 12-13 courses there were 3-4 dessert which were chocolates and ice cream. Are you kidding us? We're coming here to spend over $1000 worth of meal not to have ice cream or chocolates !!! The other courses that are really disappointing are: FRY- A deep fried of icefish with orange mandarin sauce.  To be honest, almost all fish dish served in Chinese food restaurant tastes better than this. YELLOW - Pork Belly. Curry. Banana.  Served in a tiny yellow flexible plastic bowl with a few very dry, tiny pieces of pork belly covered with yellow curry sauce. A total joke! The pork belly you can get from a lot of food trucks taste much better than this dish and the size is a lot bigger too! PAINT - Cherry. White Chocolate. Bourbon. Nothing exceptional here, doesn't matter how good the paintings the chef was trying to do, this main item in this dish basically just white chocolate.  BONE - Wagyu beef served on top of bone marrow. A good wagyu should just melted in your mouth. Instead, the wagyu here was flavorless, did not melt in my mouth. PETAL GLASS - Purple Allium, Black Pepper, Onion. Lapsang Souchong. Maitake. The biggest item and served in the most generous size was the Purple Allium Flowers which were inedible. Finally, again, TOTALLY NOT WORTH THE $$$$ !!!",0.9602,0.836,0.102,0.062,0.5244642857142857

Everything was beautifully presented and was designed to delight the diner. I didn't even get a hint of pretension from the decor, waitstaff or food, despite this restaurant's sterling reputation and rating. I enjoyed myself thoroughly here. Every course was impressive and innovative. My only teensy criticism is that several dishes were notably salty to me. Very few of the other reviewers seem to agree with me, so I will chalk it up to being pregnant and having a sensitive palate. Otherwise, everything about this restaurant was impeccable.

We sat on the 2nd floor and had a wonderful meal.  However,  I was expecting more of a ""show""...theatrics, drama. intrigue,  etc.  This was based on preconceived notions encouraged by food show hype.  Did not get this.  Staff were attentive but I got a slight whiff of flippant and haphazardness.   My guess is that demand has overwhelmed the ability of the venue to deliver on its core values.  I also presume that higher paying guests get acess to the more cutting edge aspects.  While I applaud the chef's creativity,  I condemn him for allowing fame to promote his restaurant as he simultaneously dilutes the experience for all but a select few patrons.",0.9641,0.755,0.195,0.05,0.5344246031746032

2016-11-09,5.0,"As many have said before, maybe you should skip the reviews and allow yourself to be surprised.  We did the gallery experience as opposed to the salon. Highly recommended.  I do have to say that you will need a lot of foresight to book this reservation unless you plan to come with a group of 4.  there are 3 tables for 2 available each seating (there are 2 seatings), and I would just say that the effort to book my table for 2 on a saturday night was indeed crazy.  Just realize that the tickets historically speaking go on sale on the 15th of each month, at exactly 10am or 11am.  Just get your finger ready... by 11:01am Saturday and most of Sunday was completely sold out for any seating..  the seats for 2 were gone by 11:00:01. A lot of the surprise factor for me was lost out because a friend had visited 2 weeks prior and took a bunch of photos that ended up on my social media feed.  While I do not consider myself any sort of food authority, I have dined at maybe 30+ Michelin starred restaurants in my lifetime (5 of them w 3 stars) my overall opinion based on food alone is that Alinea was not quite at the top.  What takes Alinea over the top is the combination of media elements that make it more of a show.  The service is impeccable. Tons of smiles as well. These people love what they're doing.   Every element of the dining experience all fits in. Whether it's the synchronized music with service, or the magic of the room changing shape between courses, or the great stories Grant Achatz (he was there and personally serving us at times!) was telling our group around the kitchen table, it was an unforgettable experience.  I don't know if I can quite describe the food in much detail so I'll just use this as more of a summary space.  The wine pairing was delicious. So was the non alcoholic pairing.

2016-11-03,5.0,"After watching Chef's Table on Netflix, I thought I would find myself eating at Alinea only in my dreams. Fortunately the stars aligned, and me and some friends squeezed Alinea, a BYU/MSU football game, and an Eagles/Lions game into a 2 1/2 day trip from Utah. As much as I love football, Alinea was the highlight of the trip and truly a culinary experience of a lifetime. Many reviews offer a detailed play-by-play of the evening, but I would recommend, ""Don't read the details!"".  Alinea isn't just a meal, it is an experience. Chef Achatz and his amazingly creative staff have designed an experience around their food. There are tricks and turns, a few jokes, and some killer food. The element of surprise is half the fun, so don't lessen the experience by knowing every minute detail of your meal before you arrive. Our first course was ""Ice"". There were five small glasses, set in a chunk of ice. In the cups: 1. Black truffle mousse, with grated black truffle, 2. Chunks of king crab in a crab vinaigrette, 3. Herbs from Chef Achatz own garden, 4. Osetra caviar, 5. Egg yolk custard. We were then given toast points, and encouraged to mix each of the ingredients on the toast to create our own taste combinations. Each little cup held a bit of culinary perfection, and mixed together in different ways, each bite was a new experience. This dish is probably the single most memorable dish I've ever eaten. Amazing! We sat at the ""kitchen table"", which is a glass contained dining room with with full view of Alinea's kitchen. It was simply amazing to watch Chef Achatz work in his  3-star Michelin kitchen. There had to have been 20+ staff members in the kitchen, yet is was crazy quiet and orderly the entire evening. If you can swing the cost of the kitchen, DO IT!  The cost is ridiculous, but so is the cost of the entry level dining option - and for me being in the kitchen made the night. It was also a nice bonus to have Chef Achatz join us personally to add the finishing touch to the dessert grand finale. We don't drink, so we added the non-alcoholic drink pairing - which I wouldn't recommend. Some strange concoctions that didn't enhance the food. Not worth it... As for details, I will say no more.   The food is amazing, the experience is even more amazing. My recommendation would be GO!!

2016-10-31,5.0,"This was my first dining experience in a [three-star] Michelin star restaurant and my first time dining at a restaurant of this caliber alone. I've read plenty of articles and perused various media about Alinea, so I did have high expectation, but at the same time it did intimidate me.  Upon walking into the restaurant (plain gray facade only indicated by its building number), you can sense the refinement. The staff is warm and professional upon reception/host's stand, through being seated, and until the end of service. I chose the 12-course Salon experience (I don't believe the other experiences had seats for one), and elected the wine pairing once seated.  My ticket specifications were reviewed first (food allergies/dietary restrictions) prior to going over the menu. Side note: I would also like to add that their professionalism also extends to when your purchase your dining ticket online--the communication was prompt and all of my questions/concerns were addressed thoroughly. The 12 courses progressed as follows: ice, crunch paper, yellow, spectrum, swirl, contrast sangre, cloche, bone, toast, branch glass, nostalgia, Okinawa. These courses seemed to carry an autumnal theme. As expected, the meal began with a rather showy first course, having me hold a bowl of ice in my hand while eating it. It was a sweet (coconut, passion fruit) and savory/salty (trout roe) dish, and I began with tasting very small portions of each component, then mixing them together. Considering the plating and the components, I had expected dramatic flavors, but, when eaten together, it was actually offset more on the gentle side because of the ice plate. The next standout course for me was Spectrum (sanma or pacific saury, avocado, katsuobushi), and this was the best tasting, most well-prepared fish I have ever tasted (and I typically do not like eating cooked fish). While the course had three other components (shishito pepper, avocado, and daikon, I believe), the sanma stood out as retaining its natural flavor and moisture, which was surprising because it is a small fish and was covered in the three striped sauces. My last favorite course (while they were all delicious courses) was the Branch Glass course, largely due to my love of mushrooms. The maitake was prepared in a way that you would think it evolved into a new type of a meat--great texture and retention of its mushroom flavor. It seemed that this dish was a progression of earthy to light, starting with the maitake, progressing with integration of the lapsong souchong tea component, and topping off with the slightly sweet and sour blueberry glass. My favorite dessert course was Okinawa (chocolate, sweet potato, miso), for which the plating by itself was beautiful and meticulous. The server said it was supposed to be reminiscent of the beaches in Okinawa. Again, this was a course where I asked how the odd ingredient, miso, would mesh with the other sweet components, but the richness of the chocolate (which oozes from the ""rock"" looking piece), plays upon the depth of the miso and makes for a dessert that is not overly sweet. The wine pairing was worth getting, but I am also a wine novice. Nonetheless, the sommelier was personable and highly knowledgeable without making me feel uncomfortable not being familiar with the wines that were served. She was great at describing what components of the courses play off with the wines (or vice-versa). The pairings that were most memorable were the Seikyo Takehara Junmai sake with the Yellow course and the Valdespino Tio Diego Amontillado sherry with the Swirl and Contrast Sangre course. Overall, the food itself was amazing; however, my critique would be that I wish there was a higher level of the molecular gastronomy presentation with the Salon experience. But you can still sense the curation and thought put into each component, dish, and presentation. The service was top notch, with the servers being very eloquent, courteous and amiable. I did sense, though, an urgency once they served the dishes and I asked questions (although, all of my questions were addressed). For those who are curious, you won't feel overly full after dining here, but I have a rather small appetite, so I was actually completely satisfied by the end of the night.   Despite my few critiques, dining at Alinea was totally worth the splurge. It truly is an experience of food and showmanship of culinary techniques.

Tons of SPOILERS so if you want to be surprised skip this review! I know the menu changes but just a disclaimer!  We attended the gallery tasting which consisted of 18 courses. This is the middle tasting menu.  Communal- When we first arrived we were seated in a huge communal table with different items in little glasses that were in an ice block. Tables are separated after the next course. The items in each glass were: truffle mousse, king crab, herb salad, osetra caviar, and an egg custard. They told us to wait until everyone was seated. FYI this is why you need to be on time, everyone is waiting on you if you are late!! DON'T BE THAT GUY OR GIRL!! Once everyone is seated they gave everyone toasted brioche and told us to start digging in! Shaker/Roll- For the next part we were asked to leave our belongings at our seats while we moved to the kitchen to get our next courses. They made an alcoholic drink (gin, tomato, chartreuse) in front of us with a little roll of cucumber, feta, and caper leaves. Since I told gen earlier I didn't drink they made me a special non alcoholic drink with ginger and cucumber that was so yummy! Cruno/Paper- Diver scallops are pureed and then formed into these paper looking things! A delicious corn broth is poured over it to re-hydrate the paper looking things which then turns into a scallop noodle. OMG. This was the most amazing dish ever. So unique, so full of flavor. The crunch part was a nori roll that was filled with scallop mousse. DELICIOUS. I wan't these packed up in snack bags! Contrast/Sangre/Swirl- This course consisted of: Contrast (tomato soup, freeze dried watermelon, parmesan), Sangre (green peanut, iberico jelly, apple jelly, sherry foam), and Swirl (apple, yuzu, lemon verbena)! The smokey thing coming out had strong scents of yuzu infusing the air and table while we ate these dishes! AMAZING! I hate tomatoes and I actually liked the soup, so many interesting and different flavors! Spectrum- A big plate comes out with what looks like a painted fish! The main item is a mackerel with an avocado sauce, aji amarillo sauce, and katsuobushi sauce. There is also a potato stuffed pepper, a radish salad, and avocado. I loved mixing pieces of the fish with all the other sides. Such a tasty dish that just looked so fun! Yellow- This came in a weird silicon bowl that fit your hand! This dish was pork belly in curry with banana. The pork belly and the sauce were amazing! There were also sliced fennel on top for that extra texture. The pork belly was so good and was cooked perfectly. The sauce was not a typical curry, it had a sour note to it that made it extra special!  Toast- Um YUM. This is what they called their version of a grilled cheese! This was a piece of pumpernickel toast with gruyere cheese and black truffles. This was so good and so rich and so filling! I can't even express in words the taste explosion in my mouth! Petal/Glass- I wish this course came earlier because I LOVE mushrooms but I was getting so full! This was maitake mushrooms,apsang souchong (black tea), with blueberry paper. If you love mushrooms you will LOVE LOVE this. SO SO good and the blueberry paper added a sour element and just made it just that much better! The petal was onion, purple allium, and black pepper.  Bone- This dish was one of my favorites of the whole night! A piece of wagyu on top of a crispy rice square seasoned with myoga (type of ginger). This was just such an interesting and surprisingly good course! It kind of reminded me of a savory rice crispy!! Who doesn't like a savory rice crispy?! Cloche- As they put the bowl down and lifted the cover, all sorts of aromas hits you! I think it was anise and clove. The bowl contained tender short rib pieces, lentils (OMG SO GOOD), and champagne soaked grapes. The short ribs and lentils were so freaking good. I kept going back for the lentils though!!  Nostalgia- WOW! I was stuffed an manged to eat the whole thing. This had all sort of textures going on with bubble gum, cake, strawberry, and cherry flavors! This also came with a banana helium balloon that actually floated! Everything in this dessert was so fun, unique, different, and yummy!  Paint- All of a sudden we see people taking down the paintings on the ceiling and putting them on our table. The the lights go off and music starts playing. Then different people are coming by the tables painting and spreading all these different things on the painting. Then at the the end they smash a freeze dried sort of ice cream thing and bam! Dessert is served! Gold- The last item is a gold flake wrapped candy with sesame, brown butter, and feuilletine (praline flavor). I was happy. Worth every penny.

2016-09-12,2.0,"I have visited Alinea two times within the past year and experienced two different seasonal menus. This review is based on my most recent experience for both my conjoined birthday celebration with my boyfriend.  I thought my 22nd birthday dinner would be unparalleled, but I am throughly disappointed. The first waiter to greet us seemed quite rude and unfriendly. He checked my ID to see if I was 21 and handed my license back without saying ""Happy Birthday"". Most servers need to know today's date in order to validate someone's age. I even made the effort to email them in advance to let them know about our birthdays and still got no warm welcome.Less expensive and low-end restaurants have waiters who acknowledge your birthday. I understand that this is a very petty thing to criticize. However, I expect to be treated like a princess if I am choosing to spend two birthdays here.  Then, they started preparing for dinner. Another waiter merely TOSSED my napkin on my lap, while gently placing it on the woman beside me. Uh, how about treating everyone equally? Am I taken less seriously because I am dressed casually? If I already paid the moment I made my reservation, I can obviously afford it and wear whatever I choose. Needless to say, my outfit was definitely put together even if it was not formal attire. As a fashion blogger, I think I know how to dress.  Needless to say, I posted an extensive rant on my Instagram within 5 minutes of sitting down at the table. The photo received an surprising 4,000+ likes and multiple comments of fellow customers with the same negative experience. There is a certain level of professionalism that I expect from a 3 Michelin star restaurant. Maybe it's just me being picky about the service I am paying almost $500/person for. The summer menu was also very disappointing. Citrus flavors dominated my taste palette repeatedly. My first visit before the renovation was in November, and the menu was much more diverse. As of right now, my experience at Alinea has been 50/50. I will go back again this fall to try their new menu and hope that the service is not as low-quality as it was on my birthday.",-0.8263,0.816,0.085,0.099,0.49690749190749184
2016-09-12,2.0,"This is a review for the Gallery experience at Alinea 2.0. My date and I had been very excited about going to Alinea, but left disappointed. Maybe Alinea 1.0 was better? Would strongly recommend Grace, or even Next, over Alinea if you're looking for a fine dining experience in Chicago. Atmosphere - The presentation and plating of all the dishes was fantastic. The seating at my table was uncomfortable -- I'm tall and kept bumping my knees into the table and my back started hurting pretty early into the meal. Service - Friendly, but expected better from a 3 star Michelin restaurant: I had to ask for a water refill, my date had her sparkling water refilled with still water, and at one point the server introduced a dish to us and then realized that part of it was missing. Food - As mentioned above, beautiful plating on every dish. But I felt like there was more emphasis on plating than deliciousness. I wouldn't say anything there was anything that tasted better than good. This was the most disappointing part for us. Doesn't seem worthy of 3 Michelin stars and wouldn't be surprised to see Alinea lose a star this year.",0.9853,0.656,0.233,0.111,0.5563333333333333

2016-09-02,5.0,"Alinea was part of my surprise birthday weekend to Chicago, and it was definitely the highlight of the trip. Alinea recently transformed their dining experience with a new menu and interior decor. I wasn't able to visit pre-renovation, so I can't compare, but the new ""2.0"" menu was ridiculously delightful. They excel at incorporating all senses, and the performance aspect was far above my other 3-Michelin star experiences. The food itself was also very good and in my top three. We had the upstairs Salon menu, which was the shortest of the menu options. With 11 complex courses, I left thoroughly satisfied. I can only imagine what the Gallery or Kitchen Table menus must be like. A future trip for sure! Some highlights: Course 1: Ice - Served in a bowl made of ice. The unique combination and complex flavors made this one of the more memorable courses of the night. Who would have thought banana sorbet, macadamia, coconut, and prawn tasted so good together? Course 3: Contrast, Sparrow-Grass, Swirl - A visual and olfactory delight. The ""swirl"" dish released a strong yuzu-scented fog that cascaded over the bowl. The ""contrast"" was my favorite of the three because of the various textures - olive oil gummies, lavender gel, tomato, watermelon, and parmesan custard. Party in my mouth! Course 6: Glass & Petal -  My favorite savory course. Beautiful plating, thoughtful presentation of onion within itself, and morels! The ""glass"" dish had glass-like shards made from blueberry and lapsang souchong tea. Underneath were morels covered in foie gras sauce, with bits of a pickled green. So good. Course 7: Toast - Shaved black truffle finger sandwiches!! We are talking pumpernickel toast, layered with gruyere cream, and copious amounts of truffle. A lot of times, black truffle is dried out and lacking in flavor. This was not one of the those times. Heaven. Course 10: Nostalgia - I was excited to see the iconic helium balloons had stayed on from the previous menu, though now in strawberry taffy flavor. The table next to us actually lost a balloon to the ceiling. I wish I got a snap of the waiter standing on a chair and poking at the balloon! The plated part of the course was a dark chocolate square with caramelized fennel ice cream inside, served on an amazing lemon white chocolate cookie over sabayon sauce. Course 11: Paint - This was like a pre-plated version of their table top paint show. Cherry, white chocolate, orange bourbon, coffee, and pistachio flavors made for an insane flavor explosion. Truly one of the the best desserts I've ever had. My sweet tooth can die happy now. Other than a few forgettable dishes, the food was remarkable in its own right. The creativity was evident in every course and flavor combinations consistently surprised me. The service was on point, but laid-back at the same time. This was finesse without the stuffiness. Timing was a little off, and we did have moments where we sat for more than a few minutes over an empty table. Total dining time was just under three hours. I was a bit surprised at the lack of any extra courses, bread, or mignardises with the check. Perhaps that's only for the longer meal options. Not a big deal though.

Neither of us had experienced the original Alinea but we were extremely excited to see the new re-vamp.  True to his word, Chef Achatz has re-imagined Alinea away from the original mystere and trickery and has concentrated more on straight up elegance and mind-blowing food.  I had not been to Alinea before but I had heard and read enough about the experience.   I've eaten at Next twice (Vegan and Modern Chinese) and you can't help but compare one experience to the others.  When it comes to food...there's no question.  Alinea is on a whole different level compared to Next.  There was less shock factor at Alinea than you have at Next...less theatrics.  But the food taste and quality is noticeably better - and that's saying a lot because I think Next is phenomenal.  What I love about Next is the way the dishes are presented as tools, and something you didn't realize was even edible and thought was a center piece because the 7th course halfway through the meal.  Or you'll find out your plate is edible at the end but only after you rehydrate it or something like that.  Alinea has less of that kind of show experience (which I love at Next) and focuses just on wowing you with their creations.  For example, one dish was dehydrated scallop paper that was rehydrated in front of you with an amazing broth to become a large scallop noodle that tasted like the best scallop of your life.   Service was impeccable from start to finish and the new atmosphere is open and brightly lit with a simple elegance of whites and grays.  I was actually surprised at how bright it was and had expected much darker lighting that gave a more intimate feel.   We did one alcohol pairing and one non-alcohol pairing.  The wines were exquisite and plentiful and I was happy to just take a few sips from each of my husband's servings as I would have been pretty drunk if I had a pairing of my own.  The non-alcoholic pairing was not as inventive as what you'll see at Next (bell pepper foam, interesting drinkware methods) but each pairing was some sort of juice that included 2 ""normal"" ingredients and 1 crazy ingredient that blew your mind.  For example, crazy ingredients like banana pepper or black garlic. I don't want to spoil the surprise by describing the dishes but trust that you will not be disappointed and this is an experience to remember.  The hype is worth it, the accolades are worth it.  I feel very fortunate to have experienced such culinary genius.",0.9985,0.746,0.213,0.041,0.5159377181957827

The creativity of the dishes was maybe the best we have experienced, the staff was very professional but also very friendly in a simplistic way, less formal than other places.

So luckily were were able to secure a table for 4 (at the Gallery!) and had a party of 2 ready to make the pilgrimage with us to Chicago.

They were not willing to apply the $400 credit towards something else (e.g. wine paring) either. C'est la vie [in the universe of Alinea].  All that aside, our evening at Alinea was quite memorable. We dined, along with 12 other patrons in the Gallery. Of course I am not going to spill any details of ""the show"" but let me just say that they blew our $#%@& minds away!!!!

2016-08-07,1.0,The worst experience I had at any 4 star restaurant! For the money I spent and the fact that this restaurant had 3 michlian stars you would think it be worth it but it wasn't ! The service was terrible ! The servers were cussing at our table and had no idea what dishes were what and what it even was! two of my friends flew from other states to come to experience this restaurant with me and they feel very disappointed in the experience and cheated out of their $300 plus money and we had Informed the manager of the terrible service who could even care less! All of my friends and I work in the restaurant industry in 5 star hotel restaurants and know how a good quality service supposed to be and this was far from it! They did not apologize or do anything to accommodate us! What a waste of money ! It was not worth it at all! Will not return and will let others know to not even waste a single time or dime here!,-0.9253,0.744,0.098,0.158,0.46649659863945575
2016-07-31,5.0,"Let me preface to say that the party I was with we're already huge fans of the Alinea Group and Grant Achatz. We were very eager to visit the restaurant, taking advantage of the opportunity where we all were in Chicago.  We opted for the Salon dining option for 4 people at 9:30 pm. We were greeted immediately and brought out to the dining room. I'll try to avoid spoilers about the experience because I think that is half the magic that takes place at Alinea. Surprise, whimsy, and wonder.  In terms of the food itself, keeping its prestige and price in mind, I was impressed but not blown away by the food. Maybe my expectations were set a bit too high but compared to other three star michellin and worlds 50 best that I have visited, I would say it was just a tad bit underwhelming. Some dishes were absolutely exceptional and will forever be remembered as some of the best plates of food I've ever eaten from a technique and inventive perspective but some dishes lacked the same excellent cohesiveness in concept and execution. However, they reportedly to change their menu every few months so I understand that it's incredibly difficult to uphold consistency at that level while constantly trying to innovate and evolve so I really don't fault them as I do appreciate their willingness to experiment. Were my expectations on the food met? Maybe not. Was it still one of the best meals I've had? Most definitely up there.  What sets Alinea apart is its service and flare. The tricks and surprises on the senses is truly remarkable. This was more theater than fine dining. We were constantly questioning the reason for everything they presented to us knowing that it would result in something either magical and surprising that would serve the compliment the food in a multi-sensory experience. Without giving anything away, I would just recommend to let yourself be immersed in the world they create and remember to see, smell, hear and touch in addition to taste for the full experience.  With that said, I couldn't recommend Alinea more of you have the means to do so. It comes with a hefty bill but it was definitely more than just a dinner. It was an experience we will all remember forever and an example of a restaurant that pushes its boundaries to create a meal about more than just tasting the food.  PS we fan girl'd afterwards and got a pic with Grant. So as an aspiring chef there was no better way to cap off the night than meeting the master himself.",0.9983,0.766,0.211,0.023,0.550752688172043

The creativity and playfulness is still there, but it is more restrained. The focus is now on amazing food and they nailed every dish.  Nice use of several different cultures and cuisines while still maintaining a coherent meal.  The focus is now the food and its one of the best meals I've had.

I agree with others that it isn't worth spoiling anything -- so don't read details about the dishes in the other reviews. It is so cool that they really take the theatre part of it seriously and there really is a show and there really are so many things that you don't expect. And they really pay attention to, and are concerned about taste and smell and texture. The service was of course wonderful and friendly.  My only complaint was that there weren't more courses!

2016-07-29,5.0,"Alinea has been on my bucket list for a few years, and when I saw ""Spinning Plates"" at the Milwaukee Film Festival, my desire to experience Alinea grew tenfold! It was closed to remodel and redesign the menu for a while earlier this year. When the reservations opened up, my friend was able to get us in. There seem to be two dining experiences, and the reservation we were able to get was for the 11 course experience. I believe the other might be called the Galleria experience with a few more courses. I didn't really know what to expect, especially since there were changes recently. There were diners at two other tables when we arrived in the dining room we were assigned to. It was fairly quiet. I sat across from my friend at a wide table, which allowed plenty of space for the plating and presentation, but it seemed like she was far away and I didn't want to speak too loudly in such a quiet dining room. Eventually, other diners arrived and the noise level picked up, so I felt more comfortable and relaxed talking across the table in a voice louder than the near whisper I was using when we arrived. I thought the staff was warm and friendly and did everything they could to make us feel welcome and enjoy our experience. One of our servers even joked with us to keep the atmosphere light and fun.  A wine expert was sent over to answer questions and make suggestions, but in a very ""laid back"" way, as a friend would who wanted to help you make a good decision and not like a wine snob would that wanted to push product. For our experience, he suggested we start with a glass of champagne, so we did. That worked for the first 4 or 5 courses, and then I switched to a glass of pinot noir per his recommendation due to the next group of courses coming. As for the food, what can I say? My mind was blown! That's why I wanted to dine at Alinea, to have my mind blown. I posted some photos, but I'm not going to get into much detail because I couldn't possibly do the dishes justice with my descriptions. A card on the table listed single words to help us track our courses. The server asked if we had any food allergies and explained that the chef uses fresh and in-season ingredients to help plan the menu. We waited in anticipation to see what dish and what components of the dish would represent the word for that course. I think anticipation is what heightens the experience. What are they going to do next?!?! The menu card stated ""Ice"" would be the first course. Our first course was served in a hand-carved bowl of ice. Inside the bowl were refreshing flavors of Ebi (shrimp) and citrus and coconut.   The next course was ""Crunchy Paper"" on the menu card. What arrived were crisp, small sheets of paper made from SCALLOPS! They turned scallops into crisp flat sheets! They were served in a flavorful seafood broth. A very savory scallop mousse wrapped in nori (seaweed paper) was also included in this course.  The rest of the evening continued this way with mind blowing, beautifully presented, and very delicious dish after dish. We were both full after the first 8 courses, but we aren't quitters, so we pressed on to the final stretch, which included an edible strawberry balloon and a platter with a combination of flavors, colors, and textures displayed like fine art! At the end, we were given another menu card with a few more words to help describe each course. From the warm greeting at the hostess station, to the welcoming and approachable servers, to the mind blowing food and carefully selected wines, this was one of the best, if not the best, dining experiences I've ever had in my life.  It was worth every penny, and I will to do it again!

All of the tables around us received a long explanation of the artist and concept behind the abstract art last dessert.  Our server just came by and told us ""art art art"" and gave an extra weird explanation of ""utensils utensils"" when he laid the spoons and the forks down.  Did not understand the humor behind this.  It was 11:30PM as we were his last guests, maybe he just got tired of explaining for the nth time. 2. When my hair got tangled with the taffy balloon, I was struggling for 5 minutes to get it out with the hot towels they'd provided.  There were 3 servers behind me and they definitely saw what happened.  It wasn't until I flagged one of them down that he suggested washing my hair in the lady's room.  Is it the norm in hospitality industry that when you see a guest struggle with taffy in her hair that you ignore the problem until she asks?  Or is it the norm that when you get taffy in your hair you'd automatically know that you shouldn't use the hot towels provided to you and go straight to the bathroom?",-0.9566,0.854,0.048,0.098,0.5575757575757575

2016-07-22,1.0,"I've lived a very blessed life to be able to say Alinea was one of my biggest disappointments. So. Much. Hype. I knew I would have to try Alinea at some point in my 2 years in Chicago. The 6 months of renovations made me nervous I wouldn't make it in time but the stars aligned & I had a table for 2 on the Saturday night of my graduation weekend, the ideal culmination of my time in business school & Chicago. Meant to be. But then.. I mean.. Everyone is helllllla reluctant to say anything bad about this place after paying ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS ($1,000.. Literally. For 2 person dinner with wine pairings) cuz it's painful enough to shell out that kinda money & then to have to admit you wasted all that money on the most EHHHH of meals.. But I'm gonna break this down & tell you: THIS PLACE WAS NOT WORTH IT AT ALL. At all. True story: I went to White Castle for the first time the next day & thought that was a better meal than Alinea. Do that instead.  First & foremost, I did not like the food. I'm a fancy bitch & it's not like I didn't like it cuz it was unfamiliar or different, it actually all tasted kinda subpar. The combinations & flavors were wack. Lamb was so so gamey, ugh! Another example: dish of morels. It was like a cereal bowl of morels in a cream sauce. I thought it was one of the laziest, most unpleasant dishes on the menu. I like morels but after a few the texture starts seeming creepy & it gets too heavy & makes you kinda gag. Gross.  I hadn't been there before the renovations so I can't compare. But here are a few other things that were fucking annoying about this new Alinea experien: -NO SURPRISES. You're getting served your meal in a room of other tables also getting their meals (duh, right?) except it's the fucking WORST cuz all the tables are getting different dishes at different times. So my reservation was at 8:30-- apparently they had tables at 8:20, 8:40, & 8:50 as well cuz I could see all the damn dishes that were gonna come after the one I was eating cuz the tables across from us were getting them already!! Goddammit, I thought the surprise was part of the whole fucking point!! No surprises!! One silver lining with a table behind us in the line-up meant I could listen again to the description of the food cuz they just kept blowing through them all -NO DIRECTIONS. I'm not accustomed to being served a beautiful plate of abstract shit just sprawled across it so I don't know how to eat it. Staff was sooooooooo ho-hum & I had to ask every. Single. Dish.. ""Sooo.. How do you.. Eat.. This..?"" Stop making me feel like an asshole. Found out afterwards that this new Alinea post-renovation is encouraging guests to eat it however they want. You know what though? That is really fucking unhelpful cuz I don't know how to eat whatever this thing is & you just gave the description in one breath (rushed, abrupt, incomplete, unsatisfactory)  -STAFF SUCKED. Mentioned it already but the staff was incredibly blasé. Like maybe they got used to 6 months of not doing that damn thing but the service was kinda clunky (different servers asking each other things & shooting the shit) & the attitude was VERY eh. Indifferent, casual, just whateverz. Even if it was McDonald's I would be like, not that nice but whatever. But for this caliber of a restaurant?? Eye rolling, smirking, not at alllll polished. New staff ASAP pls I'm giving it 1 star cuz the plates were pretty, I'll give them that. BUT none of that cool drawing dessert on your table or aromatic experience (some wood chip burning thing MIGHT have been planned as an aromatic  experience but I'm not sure cuz 1. I didn't smell anything & 2. The staff didn't tell me about it) that I was super super hyped about. Soooooooooo disappointing.",-0.9949,0.75,0.091,0.159,0.5543707912457914

Arrived at the restaurant and was quite surprised to find that it is located in a very quiet and almost residential area.  I actually quite liked this, as I felt it added character to the restaurant.  You walk in and see what looks like a long hallway but really is just an illusion, there is a dining area by the kitchen downstairs and one upstairs,  My husband and I were seated upstairs and were relieved to find that we had a great corner table with plenty of space and privacy.  Had the tasting menu without the wine pairings opted to order bottles (2) of wine instead.  Sommelier was gracious and helpful with suggestions but ultimately went with a Russian River (yes please) Pinot Noir. The meal itself was fun and whimsical, the flavors were just ok.  Some of the dishes, especially the chicory root wrapped in twigs (were you have to forage for your food) just did not wow me.  The presentation and the ""aahs"" were greater than the taste.  Our favorite dish, which was not on the tasting menu and we decided to add on was the truffle risotto.  The helium ballon was so much fun.  We laughed so much trying to get it in our mouths.  Favorite part of the tasting menu, the dessert.....oh my!!! the set up, the presentation, just wow.  Truly an edible work of art.  The flavors delicate and mild with such a great mixture of textures.   Overall a dining experience I will never forget, just left me wishing for bolder more memorable flavors.  If you have the opportunity definitely visit.  I also loved peeking into the kitchen as I was leaving.  Always a fan of seeing #chefsatwork.

Having worked hard to book tickets for that day in advance and shelled out the advanced charge of over $500 (including a 20% service charge) our expectations were high. We were greeted warmly and seated promptly after arriving. The creativity and taste of the food throughout the night was absolutely amazing - except for maybe 1-2 courses we both loved everything.  However, the main issue we had was the service. As with other places we've eaten, the servers changed often with different people serving us different courses. However the quality of the servers was poor to say the least. They mumbled and rushed through the explanation of each course to the point we honestly didn't know what we were eating or the complexities involved. What's worse is we could hear servers at other tables explaining the courses with details that were never provided to us which would have made it a much better experience. Further, the people who served us didn't seem particularly happy or interested to be there or doing what they're doing. What's frustrating about this is the restaurant pre-charges a 20% service charge prior to arriving and even tacked on a 20% service charge to our wine pairing which seemed excessive. Normally this would be fine but you'd expect the service to live up to that standard.

If you need a review of the most recent iteration of Alinea you can skip mine and go on to the next one. But I think my observations will still have merit since as far as I can tell the aim of the restaurant hasn't changed -- and that is to serve a meal that is literally a work of art. We were served eighteen courses that progressed from savory to sweet. The size of the circle on the menu indicated the size of the portion from a single bite to a larger plate. Some were Alinea classics (Black Truffle Explosion, and Hot potato-Cold  potato with black truffle), others were seasonal and unique to out visit. Alinea was a bit pretentious and kind of ""full of itself"" but this didn't negate the creativity and flavor of the food. Servers and sommelier were arrogant and not interested in engaging in any conversation about the food or wine, but yet they were highly professional and efficient. The wine pairing was very good but I've had better at a couple of other highly rated restaurants.  Still, all in all, Alinea was one of the most significant dining experiences of my life.

2016-06-23,3.0,"For years I've been dreaming of the day I would finally get a reservation to Alinea. It would be the pinnacle of my dining experience. If all these other fine dining places I've been to like Sixteen, Tru, Morimoto,etc... were amazing, I couldn't imagine how crazy good Alinea was going to be.  First plate started out good, but it just never really took off from there. Many of the dishes were intriguing, with complex, layered and exotic flavor combinations. The ingredients described for each dish sounded great, but each and every time, it was either too tart, too salty or too bland. Don't get me wrong, they were still good, and if you were the type who is very adventurous, would probably enjoy being jostled with every bite. A flavor roller coaster would be a good description of the meal.  BUT, I just did not enjoy the meal, at all. It wasn't bad, it wasn't great. It's almost sooo average it hurts. Yes, service is good (4/5 compared to other fine dining), decor is nice, but food failed. If I had to rate the food alone, I'd say (2/5).  Besides from being uninspired, I also found a few of the plates to be pure gimmick, like the balloon candy and the final ""paint"" dish. Plain sugar candy blown up with helium. Made for a good laugh but didn't taste like anything other than fruit roll ups. The paint dish was just some fudge, crumbs, a few flavored syrups, nitrogen ice cream all tossed onto a painting in front of you. Great for entertainment, but nothing special taste wise.  I'll sum up my experience to this: If I was given this exact meal for FREE, and all I had to do was come back and spend another 4hrs there to eat it, I would not take the offer. It may be worth the experience to come once, but not worth the time to come back.",0.9977,0.706,0.249,0.044,0.5444022289766973

2016-06-17,5.0,"I'm pleased to say that the 2016 reinvention of Alinea has been a phenomenal improvement. So much so, in fact, that it now is again a serious contender for best restaurant in the US. First of, the complete redesign of the space has resulted in a comfortable, sedate environment where the food and wine are the focus. The new furnishings are cozy and the ambiance is quiet, with no loud soundtrack. As a result, conversations tend to be muted and the communication with the servers is enhanced. And certainly there are no better servers around than those at Alinea, where everyone is well trained on the components of each complex dish, and the accompanying wine pairings. Best of all, the new menu has placed the focus squarely on the food. While each course is presented in meticulously chosen dinnerware--from gorgeous dishes fashioned of hand crafted ceramic to ephemeral bowls of ice--the spotlight is on the food in those bowls, not gimmicky utensils or serving platforms. The didactic instructions of exactly how to eat each course are gone, and now you are invited to experiment and explore with the flavors on your plate.  In this new incarnation, feedback is actively solicited as they find their way to the favorite dishes. Certainly the first five courses were absolute knockouts, and the wine pairings that accompanied them pure genius. It's a bit hard to count the courses, because the menus is an avant-garde map, and many courses consist of multiple dishes, but trust me, you won't leave hungry, whether you chose the upstairs salon experience or the more elaborate downstairs experiences.  I felt the salon offered more than enough fine dining, and ten great wine pairings, all at a very fair price.  If you haven't been to Alinea for a while, or you are looking for a stellar dining experience in Chicago, there can be no better place to start.",0.9887,0.832,0.144,0.025,0.5393860204835815

My boyfriend and I came here for our graduation dinner after making a reservation a month in advance and the experience was definitely worth the wait!  The experience was truly unforgettable and full of surprises and unique plating unparalleled anywhere. - 1st Dish: Steelhead with english pea and chamomile steam.  It was light, airy and the perfect start to the meal.  - 2nd Dish: The skate with brown butter and lemon, which we ate in one delicious buttery melt-in-your mouth bite.  Again, fresh and perfect for spring. - 3rd Dish: The first surprise of the night: ""graffiti"" with orange carrot juice ""spray painted"" onto the dishes, served on a slab of concrete.  I've never had a waiter ""spray paint"" my plate before! - 4th Dish: Surf clam soup that you drink from a metal straw straight from the plate, surrounded by delicate small bites that paired perfectly with the salty broth. - 5th Dish: Another surprise! We had been marveling at the strange ""light"" hanging above our table during the first 4 dishes, only to have our waiter take it down and mix it into a delicious darjeeling broth! The broth then was poured on top of egg plant and mustard seeds for a slightly more sour dish. - 6th Dish: Three bites: Blue Crab, Tamarind caramel, and Siam Sunray Ice.  Each was a great refreshing palate cleanser for the middle of the meal. - 7th Dish: Angelfish jaw street food! This was probably my favorite.  It was crispy with a delicious sauce served atop a Chinese newspaper. - 8th Dish: Let there be Fire!  Percebes: Tororo Kombo with smoked foie gras and hamachi to roast over the fire.  The foie gras was rich and the hamachi fresh! Such a fun interactive dish! - 9th Dish: Goose barnacles!  Because... why not? - 10th Dish: Guess what was hidden in the fire? Pork belly and parsnip!  Great grilled flavor and char on both. - 11th Dish: Another one of my favorites: Hot potato, cold potato- with black truffles!  Creamy potatoes with amazing truffle flavor. - 12th Dish: Rabbit with morels served on moss and real California redwood!  - 13th Dish: Beginning of the desserts-- believe it or not: chocolate ice cream in a glass bowl!  So crazy for being completely crystal clear. - 14th Dish: Cheesecake with matcha, berries, and hibiscus.  Great offset of flavors between the matcha and the berries. - 15th Dish: The famous Green Apple Balloon with helium inside.  Delicious, but messy.  But seriously, where else can you eat a balloon? - 16th Dish: The Art.  They brought out all the ingredients in separate little bowls first.  Complete with fresh passionfruit, sauces, and gummies.  But the presentation was the true grand finale.  The waiter created art right on our table with all of the ingredients thrown onto the canvas with flair.  Each were a new bite to try and each person got one of each ingredient so no one was left out.

2016-06-06,3.0,"I normally wouldn't leave a place like Alinea only 3 stars, however I'm quite disappointed in my experience given that I paid a nice chunk of rent money to eat here. I always thought that a 3-star Michelin restaurant should have amazing food....so my expectations were exactly that: to taste and eat amazing food. Sadly, it was not so. I'm now wondering if this restaurant received all those accolades and stars simply for their theatrical and creative way of presenting dinner rather than the way the food actually tastes?  Of our 10 courses, I only liked -- not loved -- 1 or 2. Nothing truly tasted delicious, or impressed me simply by taste. The ingredients list that the servers recite before each dish was certainly impressive. You don't remember half of what they're saying but they definitely mention some interesting ingredients. However, what does that matter if it doesn't TASTE delicious? Many courses were too salty! My husband agreed. It became inedible but I didn't want to look rude so I forced myself to eat as much as I could. Believe it or not, after awhile I started DREADING the next course!!! That is unbelievable, right? To wonder when the meal would end?!?  And fyi, I had the non-alcoholic drink pairing so maybe I should've gotten the wine pairing? The non-alcoholic pairing consisted of fruit juices that were most of the time too flavorful and overpowering. Again, they made use of unique ingredients like black garlic, but like I said before, cool ingredients do not mean your creation will taste excellent. On a positive note, the service alone could earn 3 Michelin stars (and 5 stars on Yelp). I am now spoiled by the Alinea staff who escorted me to the bathroom EVERY single time I had to pee (and when I'm drinking a new fruit juice with each of my 10 courses, I have to pee a lot)! I will definitely miss being walked to the bathroom when I return to ""regular"" restaurants....Anyway, every staff member was extremely attentive and polite. Our water was always refreshed and our napkins were replaced each time we left the table. Bottom line: Come to Alinea if you enjoy being pampered like royalty and want to eat art.

Had I known what they were, I would have actively selected other dishes. Hospitality was great and paying for the meal was discreet (they just charged the card I reserved with, which I appreciated in a business setting), but the food was just average, if not worse. The dining experience as a whole was a performance, with food having a minor role. Had I come in expecting a performance instead of a meal, this would be 5 stars for sure.

2016-05-31,5.0,"Daniel's View This restaurant is an adventure from the moment you get there.  The building is nondescript.  If you weren't looking, you would never know is is there.  Once entering you follow a long dark red corridor.  It appears to go forever, but then suddenly a door opens to you left and you are in Alinea, one of the best restaurants in the world.  When going to Alinea, you don't get a menu to choose from.   You get what master chef Grant Achatz has planned.  If you go in wanting a true gastronomic experience, and adventure in food, art, and beauty, then you will be in heaven.  Every portion of the dinner experience is a piece of art unto itself, each one fascinating, yet mysterious at the same moment.  We chose to do a wine pairing with each course, and although an (significant) extra cost, we felt the pairing would be well worth it and, anyway, what the hell.  The wine pairings are magnificent.  There was one particular bottle my wife loved so much that she tried to buy some bottles to take home (with no luck, oh well).  I am not describing the individual courses because I do not think I can do them justice.  After our meal, and many fine glasses of wine, our hosts graciously made arrangements at Boca, a neighbor bar/restaurant for more drinking and merrymaking.  They called ahead for us and escorted us over there straight to our table.  I cannot say enough about the amazing experience that is Alinea.  It is one that will stay with me forever. Be advised-  Alinea is reservation ONLY.  And you must make these via the Alinea website ONLY.  Look early and look often, but choice time slots (i.e., Friday at 7 pm) go fast.  We made our reservation about two months in advance.  When you make the reservation you pay most of the full cost up front (over a grand).  Once you've made the reservation it is a done deal.  No canceling, no refunds.  The only thing you could hope to do is actually go to the restaurant or try to 'sell' your reservation.  I recommend committing yourself to going.  You won't regret it.  Truly a culinary masterpiece. Julie's View- The idea alone of going to a top 10 restaurants in the world is fascinating. but once you get to the place you realize the reason behind the fascination. it feels like you are going on a secret society kind of thing as you are taken inside the restauran -walking through the hallway that magically disappears and then right then you know what an amazing night you have ahead.

2016-05-10,4.0,"My fiancé and I decided to not get each other gifts for our 6th year anniversary, instead we surprised each other with our picks of fine dinning. My fiancé's pick was Sixteen at Trump Tower, so you can guess who pick Alinea.  The restaurant is a bit hidden and hard to fine.  The guy standing outside asking us as we walked by aimlessly looking, if we're looking for Alinea sure helped. Once you walk in it has a very dark and dungeon like feel as you reach the reception. They help you with your coat and check them in, very formal. I can't help but felt it a bit pretentious, didn't come off very inviting. Maybe because instead of asking me if I would like to check in my coat they just gestured me to take off my coat and took it away. Whatever, not a big deal, but when you set high expectations for a place you pay attention to even the little things, can't help it.   The main server we got was not very chatty. We thought he was trained that way because the ambience of the restaurant was quiet, but I think it just depends on who you get, because we looked around and some seemed a bit more friendly with a little small talk here and there. Ours just told us what each course was and left.  Anyhow, there were so many courses to list, and no point in naming them because they change their menus seasonally so it's not like you can come back and order the same thing. Having said that, the food was an experience to be had in a lifetime. Some courses were not as flavorful as others but it plays with texture, your senses and that's pretty neat.  You have to be open and adventurous to try anything they serve you, if you're a picky eater, then it's best for you to stay away.  A couple things I think they don't change is the final dessert presentation at the end on your table and a floating edible helium balloon. That was a cool finish.  We had our final dessert presented by owner Grant Achatz himself, and I must say it was ""weird"". After our server lined up all the sweets next to our table, Grant came out from the kitchen to our table, he didn't say Hi or anything to acknowledge our presence he just started grabbing each ingredient and stating what they were in monotone before he put them on the table. This awkward presenting of the dessert went on for about 5 mins...until he finally finished as he used a spoon to crack open a chocolate ball open on the table, mumbled something, maybe enjoy? Then left without a word. I looked at my fiancé like, is this part of some culinary art that I'm not getting? 10 mins later he came out to do the same thing for the table beside us and it's funny to watch, because the guy kept trying and didn't get the clue and kept asking Grant questions and Grant would continue to speak in one word, short answers. At least it wasn't something against us.  5 stars is for the presentation of each course. Very creative. 3.5 for service, very subpar for its kind.",0.9978,0.834,0.154,0.013,0.4860893246187364
2016-04-23,3.0,"When 3-star Michelin Chefs play, this is how theatrical --- and according to New Yorker me, rather tacky --- it could be. They called it 'The Progression'. First I was happy to be booked at Alinea, known for its notorious waiting list where reservations are made months in advance, expecting the 3-star Michelin dinner by Chef Grant Achatz but instead experienced this experimental pop-up version of his famed cutting edge and avant garde molecular gastronomy fare. It wasn't too happy because I had sublime expectations (sadly true!) but at the end of the rather unusual service I have to give it to them for effort.  The Progression Experience It looks like they are experimenting on Asian and Islands flavor. We were brought to 5 different rooms. It started in a tiny art gallery  with unlimited Japanese- inspired amuse-bouche and interactive quick lesson in mixology. The next was in a dining hall where they experimented on different ambience and serving styles (so tacky, I don't want to elaborate anymore). The next was a kitchen tour where we had a few Mexican courses and DIY with the Chefs. Next was the 'forest room', an indoor venue with fresh grass floor and several food stands that were serviced and curated by several Chefs who handed us scientifically-mangled food items. We sat in wooden picnic tables, chat with the staff and other diners while 80s music played. Last rooms was another serving of amuse-bouche in a hall covered with a big graffiti blanket where diners were encouraged to self express. This is a place where you go because you are curious, not for filling up the tummy. I was filled, but not happy.  Looks like I am not a fan of the experimental, at least not this kind.  Only take away: my vocabulary was temporarily enriched by a lot of unfamiliar cooking and preparation techniques that I all forgot the following day.

We reserved 2 weeks before and paid in advance online. We were presented with a 14 course meal, some of my favourites included the lobster, black truffle, duck, and milk chocolate. The lobster dish included curry, earl grey, and grapefruit. The duck dish was presented 5 ways including foie gras. The black truffle was presented like a dumpling, and as you bite into it the richness of the truffle and parmesan cheese ooozes out. The milk chocolate finale was a piece of artwork made in front of us, consisting of a centerpiece of chocolate, with splashes of violet puree, hazelnut, and cream on the side. I was not a big fan of the lily bulb, and rhubarb. The lily bulb was way to sour for my taste, I believe it was included as a palette cleanser but nevertheless, I did not enjoy it. The rhubarb consisted of celery root, celery branch, and licorice, and was a miss.  Overall, the presentation, creativity, and attention to detail in all of the dishes are spectacular. Definitely a 5/5 on that end. However, the taste of the plates were a hit or miss. In my opinion, there is definitely a greater emphasis on the presentation of the food versus the actual taste.  The waiters/waitresses that we encountered seemed a bit pretentious. I felt like we were constantly being pushed to finish our dishes so they can serve the next dish, and this definitely detracted from the overall dining experience. Only thing I liked was when we left the restaurant, the doorman called us a cab. I would give the overall service a 2.5/5.  Overall verdict: Superb presentation of the dishes, subpar service.

2016-03-27,4.0,"Alinea is on the list of ""must eat"" places for any ""foodie"", and I certainly was no different. The restaurant stopped taking reservations over the phone several years ago. Now, they sell ""tickets"", which go on sale the month prior. Their reasoning was that it was taking two full time employees to answer the phones for reservations, and to make their reservations more ""transparent"" as anybody could see their schedule. Getting the preferred date and time is somewhat akin to winning the lottery. Some say that getting the earliest reservation possible is the way to go, that way you don't ""see what's coming"" as servers bring dishes to neighboring tables. The restaurant is located in a non-descript gray building on Halsted. If it weren't for the very small valet parking sign, you would have a hard time finding the restaurant. I was able to reserve a 5:00 PM reservation, the earliest available. After being seated, the noticeable things were the ""centerpiece"" of rosemary, mint and lemon rind in a pitcher, as well as a lily and shishito pepper hanging from the ceiling. The meal began with an aperitif of a peach ""juice ball"" with basil on top of some frozen crumbles. We were instructed to just eat the peach ball first. The next ""course"" used the water pitcher in which prosecco was poured into the pitcher then shaken to remove all of the bubbles. This was poured over the ""frozen crumbles"", which was actually frozen alcohol. The dish together was somewhat reminiscent of a bellini. The next course consisted of 3 small dishes. The first consisted of bread, Iberico ham and manchego cheese. The bread was pillowy soft, while the ham and cheese added a salty punch. This was a high class ham and cheese sandwich. The second was a gelatin cube with flavors of guindilla de Ibarra (a type of chili pepper), anchovy and olive.  Once again, this dish had a strong salty component to it.  This was not one of my favorites. The last dish consisted of paprika, chili and garlic.  Despite the strong flavor profiles of the ingredients, the taste was somewhat subdued and underwhelming. The next course was a soup. Inside of the bowl, was a fennel tea with tapioca pearls and a gazpacho foam made of tomatoes and strawberries. We were given a metal boba straw to drink the soup. On the rim of the dish was a strawberry, tomato, basil, pumpernickel and burrata cheese. The soup was very refreshing and fun. On the rim of the dish, the tomato tasted like a strawberry, and the strawberry tasted like a tomato. The next dish was served in a bowl that looked like a shell that was sitting in another bowl with dry ice. The dry ice enveloped the shell looking dish with a thick fog which contained Arctic char roe, peas, olive oil and chamomile. The salty theme continued with the roe, but was mellowed with the peas and olive oil. The next dish was a salad served on a slab of concrete. The salad consisted of white and green asparagus, fava beans, black truffles and a carrot dressing that was ""spray painted"" over the salad. The asparagus and fava beans were nice and firm, the black truffles adding some earthiness while the carrot dressing added a hint of sweetness. This was a nicely balanced, creative and fun. The hanging squash blossom and chile were also brought into play. There was a black kettle and ""charcoal"" that were set on fire, but this was the beginning of the following course. There were several components to the dish. There corn with uni butter and togarashi; ice fish cracker with smoked Hamachi tartar and kombu seaweed. Lastly, on a piece of driftwood adorned with seaweed were goose barnacles. On the rosemary was unagi with umeboshi (pickled plum), brown sugar and soy glaze. The ""charcoal"" was yakitori chicken legs wrapped in kombu and nori. Another piece of charcoal was daikon. The shishito pepper had been grilled. The lilly flower was served raw. A dashi was poured over the entire dish, which had been kept warm over the fire. Next was the signature hot potato-cold potato. The dish is served in a wax bowl with a pin holding a black truffle hot potato. By pulling out the pin, the hot potato is dropped into cold truffle and potato soup. The interplay between temperature and texture makes this a simply wonderful, and stunning dish. The next dish brought a large vase filled with olive brances with pieces of oily, cottony fluffy olive bread. The remainder of the dish included black grapes, green and black olives, lamb loin and tenderloin, lamb sausage, greek yogurt sauce and lamb jus. The bread was meant to use to sop up the sauces. The lamb was perfectly cooked with just a hint of gaminess but the brine of the olvies was a little too strong for my taste. The parade of desserts then started.",0.9948,0.906,0.079,0.015,0.46071581196581196

2016-03-12,5.0,"During 2015/16 renovations in Chicago, the chef took his entire team to Spain and Miami for ""pop-up"" experiences in those cities. In Miami the setting was the Faena hotel (new in 2015), next door to Faena house, site of the record-breaking $60M penthouse, and home to many a hedge fund billionaire.  When you consider the concentration of obscene wealth in these structures, the $385 price tag (plus $150 for the lowest tier of wine pairings) is completely proportional, ja?  With service and taxes added on (everything is prepaid), the total of $1,400 is like fast food pricing for a billionaire.  But fast food it is not: this is more theatre than dining - the service is fluid and friendly, and Miami has never seen such talent and professionalism (and after March 31 when Alinea leaves, we may never see it again).  If you're a foodie, you are always looking for that one amazing bite during a meal that will be one to remember. At Alinea, you can sometimes have several of those experiences on a single plate. And when you read about all the steps that each element of each dish requires (one of the Miami dishes was studied in great detail by the New York Times at  mobile.nytimes.com/2016/… ), you understand why the cost of admission is so high.

The presentation for each course was absolutely amazing, our table was constantly surprised by each and every dish that came out. If I'm being honest, I don't know if this was the best food that I've ever tasted, but it's definitely the most artistic expression of food that I've ever had the pleasure to experience.

But as the meal began which I will now refer to as the Bataan  death march, it became obvious to me that I was in for a long long event. The artistry of the event became painfully clear from course one. I opted for the recommended wine pairing   and candidly I did enjoy those, although they ran the bill out to a stargazing level. I like for dinner to be the prelude to an evening as opposed to an evening in itself. This was one long dinner.  And as good as much of it was about halfway through I found myself feeling anxious and counting down the rest of the courses to see when it would be over. Not here to knock the food or the servers , who were terrific, just want to say four or five hour meals, no matter how good, test the limits of my patience.

All of us agreed afterward that this dinner is best experienced in a group of friends; it is a social experience, and I can't imagine dining alone. In fact, we couldn't have imagined dining with just the two of us. The service was excellent. I have to apologize to the servers because I was in full banter mode this evening (at one point I told one of the waitstaff that he made me feel like I was in a dentist's office when he spread the napkin over my lap) but they were all just as witty and funny as one could hope for. The food was great, although a bit too much for my tiny stomach to handle - I couldn't eat much of the last few courses until dessert arrived. There were a lot of very rich flavors and interesting combinations; my boyfriend enjoyed everything tremendously and even finished up what I wasn't able to. My best friend is vegetarian, and her selections were amazing as well.  It's hard for me to separate out the actual food from the experience itself; at one point I was laughing hysterically, tears in my eyes, watching my companions trying to break candy balloons with their tongues. Everyone around us seemed to be having a great time, too. I think the dessert course was my favorite - so many different delicious flavors, including a caramelized banana which thrillingly tasted just like a Circus Peanut candy to me (I know I'm weird - I'm one of about twenty people in the world who loves Circus Peanuts; discerning and cultured, my palate is not).

2016-01-18,4.0,"Alinea Review: Our trip to Chicago was made even more memorable by having the pleasure to dine at Alinea. Securing a reservation is a tad stressful, but once made, only excitement follows. We dined in June 2015.  Throughout my varied sampling of Michelin Star establishments, Alinea certainly tops them all for overall experience, yet I have enjoyed the food much more at many other restaurants. We also had an evening of cocktails at their world-renowned sister cocktail bar, The Aviary. (See my review for complete details.) Alinea is a unique, almost theatrical, experience above all else. The surprises throughout made for a very memorable dining adventure, well-deserving of its three Michelin stars. See below for a more complete review.  Reservations: Dining at Alinea does take some advanced planning. ""Tickets"" must be purchased online ahead of time, meaning that the entire meal is pre-paid (the new trend in more high-caliber restaurants now).  Décor: The unmarked exterior only adds to the mystique of Alinea. You traverse a long, narrow hallway with a red glow. The interior is best described as a modern simplistic design. The seats were quite comfortable.  Libations: With such an extensive meal ahead of us, we chose to sip water throughout the evening.  Food: Unlike my other reviews, I won't detail each course specifically, but will instead highlight those truly note-worthy. Our first course, Surf Clam, was truly a beautiful culinary display. Next came Steelhead Roe, which featured bubbling dry ice and liquid nitrogen-- so exciting. The Skate course was served on a very creative ceramic plate-- one of the most innovative plates I have come across-- very well-done! The campfire-esque course was entirely unexpected and featured many surprises of its own. The Rabbit course presentation was stunning and evoked a geographic transformation. The signature Hot Potato, Cold Potato was a very fun dish to experience, as was Alinea's classic Green Apple Balloon. I wish I could have had two of the balloons-- such a simple, yet exceptionally intriguing dessert-- one of the most creative I have ever seen! Our dinner finished up with the Tropical Fruit dessert prepared by Chef Bagale on our actual table on a large placement!  Service: The entire team consisted of hipster-type men (all men, no women) with beards in sliming black suits. One server was very new- so new in fact that he was still unfamiliar with the restaurant layout and whacked his head on a seemingly invisible glass divider in the dining room! He was fine, but not something you see every day in a restaurant of this caliber. The staff was attentive, yet I wish they had been a tad warmer and amenable to conversation.  Summary: Alinea is the pinnacle of molecular gastronomy. Each dish will heighten all of your senses, continuing to intrigue you in taste, texture, and of course, appearance. The entire dinner is as much an experience and performance as it is nourishment. My Recommendation: Go! Alinea is the most unique dining experience I have had to date. While the food was not exceptional, it was exceedingly innovative. The surprises throughout the meal made for a very memorable dining adventure, well-deserving of its three Michelin stars. I would only return if the menu changed significantly, as it appears to have remained rather stagnant over the years.  N.B. Alinea is presently undergoing extensive renovations-- both aesthetically and gastronomically; ""Alinea 2.0"" is slated to open early 2016, and I will definitely be returning once it opens!  4 stars  Michelin Stars: Three (2016) San Pellegrino World's Best: #26 (2015); Formerly: #9 (2014), #13 (2013), #7 (2012), #6 (2011)",0.999,0.811,0.181,0.008,0.5470892857142859

I had sent an email to the restaurant when I made a reservation letting them know why we were coming . We went on a Saturday night in early December while on a graduation trip to Chicago.  My daughter had done a research paper on Grant Achatz while in school and was dying to go to Alinea. Yes it was expensive, yes we paid for the wine pairings,  but we thought it was worth every cent . It was an experience of a lifetime that we will have together.  The staff went out of their way to come over and congratulate my daughter and give her special attention. Even Chef Achatz came out himself personally and prepared the dessert.  We were so thrilled and tongue tied!  She was allowed to go into the kitchen afterwards for a picture.

2016-01-13,3.0,"After wanting to eat at Alinea for the longest time, I finally made it to there for my 30th birthday!! I was SUPER excited and soooo happy I was able to get a reservation. (I was literally checking every single day and pretty much gave up!! but I ended up being able to share a table with 2 other lovely ladies, so I was stoked!!). It was also my first time visiting Chicago, which I had heard great things about. Honestly, I probably would have made a trip to Chicago JUST for Alinea, but good thing I didn't. I was NOT impressed. Maybe even disappointed given the hype and excitement. I've eaten at six 3 Michelin-star restaurants (French Laundry, Joel Robuchon, Benu, Jean-Georges, & Grace), and Alinea unfortunately was the only one that truly let me down :'( I'm not going to give restaurants 5 just because everyone else or food critics or whoever thought so. So this is just my honest, humble opinion. 1) Okay, so if I were to rate Alinea for PRESENTATION and CREATIVITY. Sure, it probably is the best of the best, especially if you go back a few years ago, I feel not that many restaurants were on the same level. However, times have changed, other chefs have learned to master the art of presentation and innovative food. 2) Taste of the food was ""decent"" is all that I can describe. In fact the only dish I really really enjoyed was the potato puree with black truffle. Nothing too crazy, but ooh so flavorful. It left me wanting more. I can't really say that for any of the other things I ate. Uni corn I remember was good too. 3) Maybe this is getting too much into personal taste/preference, but too much use of strong flavored pickled garnishes that took away from the actual taste of the main dish. I thought fresh and good quality ingredients should not be overpowered. At first I tried to eat everything on the plate since I'm pretty sure the chef planned each & every item on there with an intention. But towards the end, I realized it was making my meal less enjoyable so I stopped eating them. 4) I loveeeeeeeeeee dessert, so even after all this, I was still hoping dessert could win me over. It did not. Okay, maybe my own fault for already having seen pictures, but as artistic and fun as it was. I didn't care for the actual eating part of the dessert...now this makes me really really sad. I'm usually the one who's eating me and my dining companion's share of dessert, cleaning off the plate...the dessert was a-okay. Service was great (no complaints). Presentation was mostly wonderful (minus the barnacles and olive oil cake inside the plant I thought was a bit too much lol). Taste was honestly a let down, considering Alinea is supposed to be one of the world's best restaurants. For a hefty $338 per person, I don't want just a food show, I expect all my food to be freaking delicious too!! Maybe my palate just isn't eclectic enough for Alinea??? Maybe they are trying too hard to be weird/different?? Ahhh I don't know...but entire meal no steak/lobster/duck/quail/shrimp/scallops/caviar/foie gras/pasta...felt like something was missing...like a main entree?? haha...me and my bf both felt the meal didn't feel complete. One time experience...okay...but really no need to ever go back. I went to eat at Grace the next day. Honestly, I would pick Grace over Alinea.",0.999,0.701,0.231,0.069,0.5474278064639512

I couldn't possibly do it justice.  But here we go... Step 1.  Be a Grant Achatz fan girl.  Own the Alinea artbook/cookbook.  Read Grant's book, read reviews, talk to people who have met him. Step 2.  Dream about going to Alinea for years (you read that right) and in the process save up the money for it and come up with a good enough reason to justify the expense. Step 3.  Get married to someone who appreciates culinary experiences as much as you do and will thoroughly enjoy Alinea.  Wedding anniversary is the perfect excuse to book a reservation.   Step 4.  Move back to the Midwest so a trip to Chicago isn't ridiculous.  Check Twitter every day religiously for 3 solid months until they open reservations for the month of October. Step 5.  Plan awesome anniversary trip to Chicago and be so excited about it that you can hardly stand it.  Tell absolutely everyone you know about Alinea and how excited you are to go.   Step 6.  Freak out that you might actually meet Grant Achatz and what will you even do then?!?!  You're not supposed to meet your idols because they might ruin themselves for you, and OMG what if Alinea isn't the great experience that you hope it will be?!?!? Step 7.  How do you even decide what to wear to such a culinary event?  Shouldn't a new dress be purchased for the occasion?  (the answer from the hubby was no, darn.) Step 8.  The day of the Alinea dinner, go to the Art Institute of Chicago so that your mind is prepped for artistic endeavors and you are already primed to appreciate the art that you will experience tonight.  Alinea is called dinner theatre for good reason, treat it as such. Step 9.  Get a fancy Uber to take you there because it's so much easier and part of the experience.   Step 10.  Take a picture outside before you walk in so you can get your fangirlness out before you potentially embarrass yourself. Step 11.  Step inside the door and proceed to experience the most incredible meal of your life with the love of your life sitting across from you.  Enjoy the conversation with the incredibly awesome servers, ask questions about everything, switch between staring into the eyes of your love, to staring at the delicious food in front of you, to staring at the kitchen in front of you that is surprisingly calm, quiet, but still magnificent.   Step 12.  Halfway through the meal, ask the hubby when we can come back.  Float out of the restaurant (mostly because I was suuuper tipsy after all the alcohol that came with the wine pairings) with longing to stay because you don't want to leave this ethereal place that has changed your perspective on food. In short, Alinea was everything that I wanted it to be.  Grant wasn't there so I didn't have anything ruined for me.  Every part of the experience justified the cost for me.  I can still taste some of the dishes that really impacted me.  I can't wait until the renovation is complete so I can plan the next trip.",0.9941,0.854,0.124,0.023,0.5415877099839365

The service and decor were amazing, but I did not enjoy all of the courses as much as I have at other restaurants with the same reviews. My friend did love every part of the restaurant, but this is (what I believe) attributed to her knowledge of the chef's vision for each dish. Based purely on taste, I will not make another trip out for Alinea. The mixture of flavors is usually the best part, but I actually found a lot of the first half of dishes to be quite odd and not really complementary.

We were also the first table receiving courses in our room, so since we were ahead of other tables who were seated after us, each dish was a suprise to us and everyone else. It was also fun hearing the ""oooos and ahhhhs"" about our food as it was brought out.",0.9846,0.776,0.216,0.008,0.44944444444444437

The reviews describe the restaurant well and we were not disappointed. We got in before the major renovations for January/February. Alinea was, as my mom described, an EXPERIENCE. Walking in, the decor is clean and modern. The servers highly attentive. And the food amazing. My favorites were the hot potato (a classic), the graffiti dish (on custom concrete!), the parsnip (surprisingly amazing and more flavorful than you'd imagine), and the Kombu/unagi/corn (cooked right on a flame on your table!). The signature dessert at the end is also amazing with Chef Achatz himself laying out the dessert! Overall a wonderful experience. :) Tips: the wine pairings can be A LOT of alcohol (plus you start with a cocktail), thus we were more than satisfied with one bottle of Chardonnay between the two of us. Apparently some guests get quite tipsy and have to pass on a dish!",0.9865,0.801,0.187,0.013,0.5963203463203464

First off, the hubs and I decided to try Alinea since we had a great experimental experience at the now closed WD-50 a year ago. Alinea is known for making dining an experience, and they did not disappoint us. We were ""easily"" able to get a reservation on a weekday at 9pm during a Chicago winter. I won't spoil it, because each plate deserves to be experienced by you directly. But, I will say this: I loved the taste of some courses, and others were swallowed with difficulty. I wish we got a whole plate of some items, and less of others. But each dish was absolutely wonderful. We were entertained and each plate had a playful mystery to it. The idea of having your tastebuds confused and being surprised at every turn is what makes this restaurant stand out from all others. Definitely the best experience with food for us this year (and we did TFL, which is hard to beat).",0.9944,0.722,0.243,0.035,0.5675925925925926

2015-12-13,3.0,"Context: - Went for dinner on 12/12 with my wife. Paid ~$750 for dinner (including tax and tip) and chose the reserve wine pairing ~$650. Total of $1,300.  - This is our 3rd 3 Michelin star restaurant - Guy Savoy in Paris and Alain Ducasse in London. For these last two, with wine pairing, the cost was closer to $900.  Food: - 5 stars. Everything was perfect. Very innovative dishes, entertaining to eat and in one you will laugh.  - Definitively worth the $750 Other guests (non-controllable for Alinea) - We were seated in a section with 4 other tables. Here is what happened in 3 out of those 4. - Table farthest from us: One guy was reading a book the entire time (ok, whatever) - Table next to us: Older couple did not stop staring at us (ok, whatever) - Table in front of us: Girl passed out drunk! We noticed she was not talking and thought she was looking at her phone but then realized she was passed out. She ended up throwing up in the bathroom and my wife went right after. She had to tell one of the staff to send someone to clean. Reserve Wine Pairing (controllable for Alinea) - I will try to write this without sounding like and alcoholic but the amount you get served is ridiculously little! Not even to the curvature of the glass. During the first pour I honestly thought it was intended for me to try it out - For context, it takes about 4 decent sips to finish the 'glass' - Each wine is served before the dish and there is often a time lag (not an issue) but in two occasions we ended up finishing the 'glass'. - We asked the sommelier if we could have more and he was cool about it. However, we did notice that after that our wines were poured immediately AFTER the dish got served so this ""double"" thing did not happen again - For $650, not sure it was worth going through the awkwardness of thinking you are doing something wrong by asking for another glass Service (controllable for Alinea) - This is context that you are going to a 3 Michelin star restaurant. The level of service we got is above what any human being needs but not at the level of this rating. - During the service we were never asked if we needed anything else ,changes, etc... During courses 7-8 and 8-10 there is a looong waiting time were you don't get any wine as well. I wanted some more water but no one ever checked on us. - It honestly feels you are part of a production process that will not change, you sit down, eat and get the hell out.",-0.4147,0.875,0.065,0.06,0.48495564892623705

I went to dinner understanding that this is going to be a ""gastronomical experience"" but unfortunately, that does not necessarily mean it has to taste of moderate quality.

But instead, I was left bewildered of the awkward combinations. Maybe just one dish was tasteful, which would be the tiniest circle dish with a needle pin that runs through it. We were most excited about the dessert but the only thing exciting was the glitter they had sprinkled over the table. The ""gastronomical"" pieces of dessert had no flavor!

2015-11-13,5.0,"*** 750th Review, 1st time trying out Michelin 3-star restaurant *** Each foodie has his/her list of ""dream"" upscale dining restaurants (from the French Laundry in Napa Valley to Eleven Madison Park in New York); however, I never thought this day would actually come ... it is one thing to dream and drool about the list, but it is another thing to pay a total of $338.13 and fly all the way to Chicago just to try it. Overall, Alinea wasn't necessary the best meal, but rather the best dining EXPERIENCE I've ever enjoyed. Alina is one of the two three-star Michelin restaurants in Chicago (as of 2015), ranked No. 26 on 2015 World's 50 Best Restaurants (ranked No. 9 in 2014), and received AAA Five Diamond Award. In addition, Chef Grant Achatz (one of Time Magazine's 100 most influential people in 2011 & winner of James Beard Outstanding Chef in 2008) was diagnosed w/ stage 4 tongue cancer back in 2007, but he's now cancer free. *** Reservation & Dress Code *** Follow Alinea on Twitter and it will send out a tweet when tickets begin to go on sale (typically between 8 AM to 10 AM PST on the 15th of each month) & you can ONLY book a party of 2, 4, or 6. You have about less than 1 to 2 hours before most time slots are filled, so plan accordingly. I would get the earliest reservation time (e.g. 5 PM) so other tables won't ruin the surprises. For men, bring a jacket and no casual wear (e.g. jeans, t-shirts or tennis shoes).  *** Price & Valet Parking *** For Sat 5 PM dinner, it was $338.13 per person ($255 base price + 20% service charge + 10.5% taxes); however, the base price varies depending on date and time (e.g. Sunday is cheaper than Saturday & early 5 PM dinner is cheaper than 7 PM dinner). You'll have to pay separately for wine pairings & $14 for valet parking. *** Tips & Other Information *** Alinea specializes in molecular gastronomy and please expect this 12~14 courses to last 2~4 hours (I finished the entire thing in approximately 2 hours w/ 5 minutes break b/w each course & w/o wine pairings). If you are planning to come here, then don't look at any pictures because they will ruin all the surprises. If you don't care, then keep reading. *** WARNING - SPOILERS AHEAD *** Impeccable service - it starts the moment you step into the Alinea's boundary and the staff will escort you till the very end. I embarrassed myself by taking used fork & knife and putting them back to where I grabbed it. Fancy complimentary volcanic water (Sant Aniol - NOT sparkling) & all my friend did was chugging the water. *** Food *** Apple cider from Norwegian: It was stirred w/ rose stem; tasted very crisp. Peach [basil, murray river salt]: Icy ball sealed w/ peach juice - very interesting texture. Bocadillo [bread, jamon iberico, manchego] & Gilda [guindilla de Ibarra, anchovy, olive] & Patatas Bravas [paprika, chile, garlic]: These three cubes tasted exactly like what I saw in the pictures - talk about food ""engineering"" at its best. Strawberry [tomato, pumpernickel, burrata]: Soup tasted like dashi w/ weird boba-like texture AND not to mention tomato looked like strawberry, but tasted like tomato (and vise versa). Another interesting visual trick. Brook Trout [uchiki kuri squash, thai banana, blis]: New course and unfortunately I thought it tasted OK. Graffiti [matsutake, maitake, parsley]: Whoa - I actually thought those were actually bricks (those were actually crackers) - delicious melt-in-your-mouth crackers. Daikon [smoke, seawater, ash] & Tororo Kombu [hamachi, ice fish cracker] & Unagi [pickled plum, white sesame] & Corn [miso, nori, togarashi]: Corn was decent, but hamachi tasted delicious and crispy - probably one of the best hamachi I've had. Chicken [shishito, lily, kombu]: Charcoal was used to fire tea kettle and SOMEHOW charcoal turned into chicken w/ a touch of lily and shishito pepper. It was definitely one of a kind presentation. Hot Potato [cold potato, black truffle, butter]: I pulled off the metal stick and ate the entire thing in one attempt. It was cool, but it didn't taste as good as other courses. Olive cake [extra virgin olive oil, black pepper]: I hate olive, but I thought olive cake was pretty good (no strong bitter taste)! Lamb [caper leaf, grapes, olives]: Not very memorable. Parsnip [honey truffle, vanilla, orange]: This had the most complex flavors - the ""mouth-feel"" from Diet Coke, sourness from sauce, and garlicky flavor all combined into one. Balloon [helium, green apple]: I sucked some of helium and my voice actually changed for few seconds. Think the balloon as green apple flavor bubble gum filled w/ helium. My friend didn't ""kiss"" the balloon properly and all helium just dissipated to the atmosphere. Tropical Fruit [rum, vanilla, kaffir lime]: Final course and grand finale - one minute of dazzling dessert show.Good frozen coconut and interesting mix of mango, passion fruit, and chocolate sauces. *** Alina is a once-in-a-lifetime experience and that's all there is to it.",0.9964,0.764,0.147,0.089,0.5327841766077059

In this case, the wait staff were very professional and there were no signs on speeding up the experience. You can however, ask to speed things up. But these guys were great. The show was great.

None of these prices include drinks.  Alinea was definitely more fine dining than Fat Duck. Whilst there was some of the theatre, it was on a much more refined and toned down version than Fat Duck.  Think of Fat Duck as the fun younger sibling to Maude being the oldest and well past being stupid, with Alinea in the middle, grown up yet still able to let loose a little.  The overall food itself was probably better than Fat Duck, but I was disappointed that there wasn't one specific dish (or element of a dish) that I can think of now that makes me drool (Fat Duck had the ""blood pudding"" with the duck, Maude the Venison, Tagliatelle & the corned wagyu beef). Don't get me wrong, everything was lovely, it was just probably more consistent, or even safe perhaps, than I was hoping for.  I'm not against consistency, I think I just had in my head there'd be more to the ""fun"" part of the dining than the ""fine"" part.    (Maybe I've been spoilt with the overall theatrics of Fat Duck, or that venison at Maude)  If you're after good food, in a fine dining setting, with a little fun, definitely check Alinea out.  I like the idea of the pre-purchased tickets, which includes service & tax.  Drinks are extra, and they now have a small liquor list to go along with wines by the glass, bottle, beer, cider & the matching wine option. I opted for a single malt @ $65 (US) for 2 oz (a double / 59ml for those playing around the world).  Fun Fact - the helium balloon was a hoot!",0.9911,0.823,0.152,0.024,0.36424971040355647

Going to go against the grain:  as someone else mentioned, a feast for my eyes more than for my tongue.  Alinea is worth the price - you're getting food and theatre in the ticket price.  Very playful food presentations.  Excellent and well prepared food execution and preparation - can you just imagine how long it took to make that tomato and strawberry gelee so lifelike?  Not to mention, I'm sure that flavors can be off and difficult to manipulate when you use scientific v traditional cooking techniques.  My friend mentioned how the menu reminds her of the now defunct WD-50 tasting.  The flavors were good, as I expected it to be, however, I just didn't experience the normal euphoric food high. Highlight was the pastry chef's presentation of the dessert painting on a silicone grey sheet he placed over our dining table. I guess I'm just not a fan of molecular gastro cuisine but you should definitely experience it for yourself.  In addition, if you're a repeat diner, the kitchen is said to send several complimentary dishes which can make first time diners feel underwhelmed. Reservations pretty easy to procure for dining on Wednesday to Friday nights.   Maybe I just got lucky.",0.9954,0.752,0.221,0.028,0.5276899092970522

The price tag is also tops. We are in Chicago and this is a Michelin 3 star so it's justified. I will not go over item by item. The whole fun of the menu is surprise. My date knew nothing going in and she was giddy during the meal. The presentation is flawless by both food and wine servers. You can tell they are more highly trained here than in Chef Achatz other restaurant Next. The atmosphere is not stuffy which is what my assumption was. Staff is loose and will make jokes.

2015-10-19,5.0,"Last night was like THE BEST first date.  It started with a flurry of outfit changes, option after option tossed out until I had settled on something comfortable and low-key (because who wants thirteen courses in a bandage dress and spike heels?).  On my way now, the butterflies begin. I had refrained from Google stalking because I didn't want to know too much. But now, as I get closer to the restaurant, the pleasant tingle of excitement turns into something more like actual nervousness. I should have researched! This is a stupid dress! And what if I don't like the food, and what if my dinner companion and I run out of things to say? The door opens and the hall is dark, long, and empty. Oh god, it's going to be pretentious. I crack a stupid joke about haunted houses. A door at the end of the hall slides open, making me jump.  A kind gentleman is waiting to take our coats. Since I just managed to scare myself in the hallway, I frazzledly shake his hand instead of handing over my coat. He rolls with it. (Bless him.) We are shown to a table in a serene, beige room. A shishito pepper and lily bud fly overhead. We sit down, a bit stiff and expectant. And then the night begins for real, and the nerves dissipate, and everything is wonderful. Some food-objects (what do you call them? courses? not really because there are so many separate elements) land more than others -- but the ones that do, my gosh, I feel in my bones. And other places.  A couple hours move by at an ideal pace. There are fits of uncontrollable giggling, and pleasant banter with the very pleasant staff, who move plates (or concrete slabs/piles of hot cinders/slippery seaweed, etc) with calm ease and are exceptionally well trained in the art of making people feel welcome. The gentleman seated next to us shares sips of his wine with us, which is a bit odd in theory but works well in practice. Well-heeled diners inhale helium and fill the room with the sound of joyful chipmunks, and everyone laughs and cheers.  By the finale of the meal, I am totally relaxed. I am humming Ten Minutes Ago to myself as my friend and I waltz out into the fall night. And the best part is: I know there will be a second date. I don't know when. But I know it will happen.",0.9972,0.753,0.199,0.047,0.531639566395664
2015-10-18,4.0,"It is an extraordinary experience for sure, but more for your eyes than for your taste buds. Considering this is a food place after all, maybe they need to rethink their priorities.  Upon entering you are greeted by some very friendly staff, and you get the chance to have a peek into their ginormous kitchen full of cool gadgets that look like they come from a sci-fi movie. I really enjoy being able to have this behind the scenes look and better appreciate how your food is made. The actual dining room is elegant but still simplistic. I don't exactly know how I feel about this - considering the price and fame even if it's gold and marble everywhere it won't be a surprise. I suppose not having over the top decor helps you focus on how pretty they make your food? Then we were asked to choose our drink pairings. My date had the reserved wine pairing, which is a lot of $$$$ but well worth every penny. The wines were high quality and a few of them extremely rare, and the sommelier was very good at explaining the nuances of each. Apparently one of them was from such a mysterious source they can never find anything just like it again.... Hmmmm. Normally I don't like ordering wine and in the back of my head think ""oh man I could have gotten this at Binny's for a fraction of the price"" but I didn't have the concern here - since clearly normal people can't get their hands on most of Alinea's selection. I don't drink much so I just took sips from his glasses and ordered a root beer. I'm pretty sad that they don't have a pairing for non-alcholic drinks. They have it at Next, and a pairing really brings out a good synergy between the food and the drink. We had about 14 courses (can't remember exactly) and most of them were just one tiny tiny little bite. A lot of very interesting concepts for sure, like chocolate that's completely bleached white?  One of the most impressive dishes was also the one that made me the saddest though. They made a seaside bonfire with seaweed, rocks, a nice little fireplace etc at our table, which was super impressive, FOR ONE TINY BITE OF FISH. I feel like if that dish was worth $100, at least $95 was spent on the decor part..... I'd say the dinner definitely ended very nicely with the dessert. Two dessert chefs make the dessert at your table, on your table cloth. It is quite a masterpiece of different sauces and pieces of fruit, and the chefs go through a very synchronized and dramatic motion to lay down everything for you. Too bad the taste was again not phenomenal... IDK if I'm imagining it, but they have molecular gastronomied the (*&$^% out of all the food that I sometimes imagine tasting chemicals in them.",0.9988,0.746,0.224,0.029,0.5474590163934426

2015-10-06,5.0,"Alinea is more than a meal it is a dining experience. As soon as you walk in the door you enter another world where art and world come together in perfect unison. A meal at Alinea is one of those rare meals that will inspire your mind and stick with you for a life time. Alinea is best experienced when you know as little as possible so the experience can be truly personal. Avoid spoilers, therefore stop reading if you want to make the best of your night. As soon as you walk in the door the tone for the entire experience is set by a red lit hallway that tappers at the end. As you move down the hall a large sliding door automatically opens, ushering you into another world. You walk in the door and immediately you are greeted by a smiling man in a suit. He welcomes you with instructions to hang out near the glass wall and study the kitchen. You stand there, entranced by the eerily quiet but busy kitchen. The man in the suit says it's time to move to the table. Over the table a shishito pepper and lilly hang, creating a shadow that resembles a hummingbird. In the center of the table sits a carafe containing mint, rosemary, and orange peel. The man in the suit pours sparkling wine into the carafe as part of the first drink pairing.  ""Peach"" with basil and murray river salt is a frozen ball containing peach juice that bursts into sweet liquidy goodness when places in your mouth. Suddenly the man in the suit reaches over and pours the contents of the carafe over the frozen crystals the peach orb had been sitting on. There's a frozen cocktail staring you in the face, uncertain but containing freeze dried Avino Cava Reserva Penedes, Pacharan Sierra de Orduna, Rhine Hall Apple Brandy. The second course, bites inspired by Spanish tapas. To you they seem like something out of science fiction. An entire meal in one bite!  Bite 1, Bocadillo with bread, jamon iberico, manchego! Bite 2, Gilda with guindilla de ibarra, anchovy, olive! Bite 3, Patatas bravas with paprika, chile, garlic Enter stage left, dish number 3, ""Strawberry"" with tomato, pumpernickel, burrata. The dish looks like a simple tomato, strawberry, some bread crumbs, and some cheese. At a glance, you would be wrong. Both the strawberry and tomato are actually gels. The strawberry tastes like a tomato and the tomato tastes like a strawberry. Your mind is blown apart from the inside out. Truly innovative and really makes you think about your tendency to eat with your eyes first. A smoking fourth dish slams down on the table like some kind of fusion between Halloween and spring time. The smell of chamomile and flowers hits you in the face. The man in the suit says ""Char roe"" with English pea, olive oil, chamomile. At the bottom of the bowl there are several gels (including jalapeno) and some roe. Each element was interesting on its own but when mixed paired flawlessly. Dish number five, Graffiti consists of matsutake and maitake mushrooms served on concrete slabs. The dish is ""tagged"" with parsley puree. To you, the street art inspiration has been made clear. Never before has a mushroom tasted so good. The sixth course is comprised of several elements.  ""Unagi"" with pickled plum, white sesame ""Corn"" with uni, nori, togarashi ""Tororo kombu"" with hamachi, ice fish cracker ""Percebes"" with smoke, seawater, ash The last element is served on a piece of driftwood covered in seaweed. The only thing you are instructed to eat is the four tiny barnacles. Each part of the course brings forward sharp images of the salty sea. You suddenly realize the next dish had been sitting in front of you all along in the flames. The chicken and daikon were wrapped in seaweed roasting in the fire. It was unwrapped and prepared at the table by the man in the suit. The sauce was in the tea kettle and was poured over the course. A tiny white orb arrives at the table. The man in the suit says its name is, ""Hot potato"" with cold potato, black truffle, and butter. This dish was ""time sensitive"" with both cold and hot elements. The pin was pulled out of the dish, dropping the cold potato into the hot butter. Incredible mouth feel of contrasting hot and cold elements. Next a vase of bay leaves is placed on the table with ""Olive Cake"" with extra virgin olive oil, black pepper sitting a top the leaves. It is served with ""Lamb"" with caper leaf, grapes, olives. This dish was paired with ""Oliver Cake,"" which made for perfect sauce enjoyment. One of the last dishes, as your night winds down, ""Parsnip"" with honey truffle, vanilla, orange paired sweet and savory elements perfectly. You never will look at a parsnip the same again. A tart lemon balloon arrives at the table. It is made of lemon candy and filled with helium. You suck the helium out of the candy and devour the lemon sweet goodness. For the grand finale, ""Tropical fruit."" This dish was plated directly on the table with a variety of sauces (all spice, mango, rum). You leave but can't seem to shake the experience, numb.",0.9984,0.85,0.127,0.023,0.5126339285714286

My husband and I have been looking forward to this dinner for close to 2 years and we finally had the opportunity to go to Chicago...waited anxiously 2 months In advance hitting refresh every 5 minutes to get our tickets. Its hard to rate this place...I wasn't overly impressed by the food but it's more about the experience...by the 3rd course I felt it to be a bit gimmicky as if they were trying to hard. The molecular gastronomy was interesting yet I found the overall taste achieved to be mediocre.  If your looking for something interesting and different then check this place out...the service was awesome...the wine pairings were very good and we had a great time but if your looking for an amazing meal comparative to a L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon your not going to get anything like that here and the price tag is nearly the same.,0.981,0.796,0.162,0.041,0.5719166666666667

We went on a Thursday night because the meal was alot cheaper on Thursday nights than on weekends. We arrived early for the 1st seating at 5:30pm. We were taken to our table immediately on the 2nd level of the restaurant. The decor was simple and elegant, with a small bunch of vegetables hanging from the ceiling right on top of our table... weird but interesting decoration. Little did we know, that was part of one of our courses.  We were happily seated at our table and the courses begins. I'm not going to go into elaborate details on how creative, beautiful presented, and how tasty the food is because that's what Alinea is known for. Everything was mind blowing, interesting, and many dishes had a very surprise twist. Definitely kept me at the edge of my seat.  After the meal, we were very lucky to be allowed near the kitchen and watched Chef Grant does his magic in the kitchen. He was focused and very diligent with his trade and ""artwork"".

The Chef is very innovative in the way the food is prepared and presented.  Every single course seemed thoughtful and beautiful. In terms of portions, it was quite small. Dinner comes with 10+ courses but all of them are very tiny so don't plan on getting full.  At a price of $600 for two people for just food and no beverages, I would have hoped for bigger portions.  I weigh 90 pounds and we ended up eating at a different restaurant only two hours after we left Alinea.  Being a restaurant classified as Japanese, I would have expected to see more seafood.  Most of the courses are not seafood.

2015-09-25,2.0,"Trigger Warning: The party pooper is on her way!!! I am deeply petrified!  Planned for the bday trip to Chicago for fiance and had read so much about this Alinea place being a hot spot as a Michelin 3 star rated place, I decided to surprise him and fulfill my curiosity. (Let me make it clear, according to a website with unknown credibility, ""three stars represent exceptional cuisine 'worth a journey'."") Mine was worth a journey to sit by cocaine sniffers who happened to be lawyers (YES, you read it right, some people who can afford eating apparently also uses cocaine) and eat my money. Oh where do I start...let's go with the service. It was quit, shall I say, exceptional, I mean for all the pricy restaurant services I had this was probably reasonably pleasing. I am not sure about this 8 different dudes serving you (and man don't they have different personalities) over a night, somewhat overwhelming. Also this almost sound sexiest, I saw one girl (and she was not in the attractive category, not sorry looking but her dressing is like a elementary school teacher who might also be a nun) and maybe the owner and anti attractive women or something?! Good job on memorizing the crazy ingredients names, it sounds all gibberish to me but okay, they sound like money, ka-ching! Course started with this cool idea of fruit juice with mint in a decanter (made me wonder who's washing all these dishes!). On the glass presented in front of you was dry ice and a little artificial fruit - chocolate made juice thingy. We had a bite, hmm taste fine but very cool idea. Then, there were three pictures of delish looking food, with a glass on top of each pic, with a little cube on top of each glass.  I called them astronaut food. Who the f**k spend 20 bucks on eating cheese covered with Cheetos crust and olive flavored jelly?? Man from the juice fruit to the astronaut food, my emotional roller-coaster moved into a free fall motion. The following course, the tomato being strawberry and strawberry being tomato, brought the jello/puree shit to the next level, of horrifying. We sat there trying to suck this milky/foaming sauce of supposedly tomato and strawberry, oh god help us all. The waiter stared at us as if they were bodyguarding the food's innocence. If the force do exist, I felt it crying at me ""GOD DAMN WON'T YOU JUST DRINK IT!"". No, I ate the little pureed jello and just had to quit the rest soup for my own well-being.  The course followed by that, looks like guac+icy+green+fishball, and doesn't taste like anything but someone who must had a really messy kitchen knocked mayo into ice cream with fish ball. Basically, every flavor that should've not get into one place, magically got into the same place, with BEAUTIFUL presentation. My fiance and I pretty much poked whatever we were able to eat and called it good. We stared at each other and silently communicated, when will the suffer end!!!! Then we finally hit a decent course, with my favorite ingredient, unagi!!. It was clever and elegant, and mostly, edible. At the end of the day, how can you mess up japanese eel by poke it onto a pine tree branch as a stick (and trust me I'm speaking with no trace of sarcasm here). The roller coaster finally returned to the normal sea level. The rest of food start to get edible. I just don't understand the vibe of puree the shit out of food that would be completely tasty on their original form, not to mention how disgusting savory jello shots tastes. Surprisingly, not too much selling on being organic, what a plus! Deserts in general were a lot more acceptable. Very beautiful presentation, nothing special about the taste. The last splashing table desert, the chef was so ""excited"" he sprinkled the candy crumbs on my Dolce & Gabbana dress. Down on it's way to dry cleaning!!!! This is getting too philosophical, I should go back to eat my $1.99 Golden Corral buffet...And please Michelin rater, go dip your tongue in sewage water, that will clean your palate.",0.992,0.762,0.149,0.089,0.5977734223770809

2015-08-30,4.0,"I was thrilled to learn Alinea accommodates vegetarians. (I feel like the Chicago restaurant scene will have truly arrived when there are more vegetarian options!) When seated, we were told that all the dishes for the vegetarian meal are like the original but include substitutions that maintained the flavor profile. The flavors were, of course, epiphany, but the total meal was subadditive: I'm 110 lbs and left craving protein and fat. It made me wonder where daikon and various fish would map in a flavor principal component analysis. I'm not sure they're close. I'm reluctant to leave four stars because I don't want to discourage Alinea from accommodating vegetarians. At the same time, I want the vegetarian substitutions to be better, partly so people don't associate meatlessness with some lame anhedonic asceticism. The *only* other fault is that the cubic centimeter of dragonfruit in the dessert course was overripe. I have eaten scores of dragonfruits all over SE Asia and know when they are good.

Good call - she was right on the money. What an incredibly special (and generous once in a lifetime!) treat. I have read the book by Grant and Nick - my perspective is that Grant is kind a genius jerky guy like artists can be.   I won't say it was the most delicious food of my life, there were high points for sure, but WOW it was like a foodie Disneyworld of food/dining magic. The staff could not have been more accommodating (no fish for me) and really adjusted their service to our kind of crowd  - we wanted it to be fun and friendly, not stuffy.    Like others say, if you are slightly behind in courses than another table - look away because you see some spoilers.  It is interesting to see which tables Grant himself does the dessert table - 2 (of 4) tables in our room got the special treatment - and we did not, he was gracious enough to let us take a photo in the kitchen - but he hated every second of it.  Ah well such is the price of fame.",0.9937,0.71,0.245,0.045,0.5915134099616858

2015-08-07,5.0,"Best meal of my life.  I ate at the French Laundry in 2003 when Chef Achatz was still working there, I've eaten at Jean Georges and other fine establishments.  Alinea topped all of them. The service is more perfect than words can convey.  The food is delicious and like nothing you have eaten before.  Surprising, fun, exciting.  By the 1/2 way point I had lost the ability to form coherent sentences, my mind was reeling with flavour and delight.  It was over all too soon and my girlfriend and I stayed up for and hour and a half after taking notes so we could remember what happened and relish the evening. A couple of interesting notes...  Since you pay ahead of time, if you don't opt for wine, no money changes hands during the evening and that was a very nice comfortable experience.  One fewer thing to distract us from enjoyment. Coffee or tea at the end is included and was amazing and I don't normally drink coffee. There were a couple of courses that had a heavy Japanese influence.  In the past I considered traveling to Japan to try the food.  That would have cost several thousand dollars.  Now I'm thinking I'll save that money and just come back to Chicago and try Alinea.  Chef Achatz, you have saved me a great deal of money here and I can now justify coming back.  This makes me very happy. I love thai curries and make them myself.  One of the courses involved a single bite dish that was a green curry.  In that one bite it tasted like the best bowl of green curry (with crab in this case) that I have ever had.  This was very much a Willy Wonka moment. One of the dishes that involved black truffle was by far the best use of black truffle I have ever eaten.  This was from the Grafiti course. I look forward to going back some day.  We did not go away hungry.  Our taxi was waiting for us when we got back to the real world outside.",0.9971,0.777,0.202,0.021,0.43288766788766797

We have been to a few three Michelin star restaurants and not sure what to expect especially after watching Spinning Plates. The dinner was about 3 hours and we were constantly surprised, laughing and enjoying all the courses. While we both agreed that the food was not as good as Per Se or Brooklyn Fare, the meal was very creative, interactive and a wonderful dining experience. The service was superb, the staff was beyond knowledgeable and the wine pairing was really good. Every wine paired extremely well with each course.  I was surprised that the ingredients used were not super expensive like the usual foie, caviar and shellfish but the chef was able to serve a very memorable meal. One of the desserts was a green apple helium balloon where you got to suck the helium out like you did as a child. On the last and final dessert, Chef Grant comes out to the table to present the course. This was a good experience to see and meet the chef but you could definitely tell he's done this one too many times and it's become boring and monotonous to him; however, it's his choice to leave it on the menu. Overall still a really fun and creative experience! To make a res:  I made our reservations through their online ticketing/reservation system 2 months before we are at Alinea.

2015-07-30,5.0,"Alinea is unlike any other restaurant in its own fine dining class. It offers creativity and innovation in an unparalleled way. It is fun, exciting, surprising, and unique. The food however is a mix of several outstanding dishes, like Surf Clam, Steelhead Roe, Graffiti, Hot Potato Cold Potato and Black Truffle, and some not so outstanding ones like Lily, Percebes, Cheesecake and Balloon (though the concept of Balloon is UNBELIEVABLE). And what I mean is that the taste of some of their dishes fell short of the presentation, concept, and its class. Cheesecake was ordinary, and nothing special. Percebes, though unique, was watery and too ashy, Lily felt like biting into raw ginger, and balloon tasted like Fruit Rollup (sticky, sugary, and not exactly what I expected after such an outstanding presentation as an edible helium balloon. But when the dishes were outstanding, well, then they tasted better than anything else I ever tried - Hot Potato Cold Potato and Surf Clam were orgasmic! But the lack of consistent delivery of amazing flavor (and of course I know taste is subjective and what I found not so great may have been someone else's favorite) is what drove me back to thinking that my top three remain Eleven Madison Park, Le Bernardin, and Daniel (all in NYC). The service staff is young and friendly, personable, and in some ways similar to Eleven Madison Park except not as polished or refined. The ambiance is modern and a bit sterile, like a surgical room. But it is conducive to the many culinary surprises. I won't spoil them here, but there are many dishes hiding within others and hovering above your table. They are indeed the most creative people I ever encountered. The tickets system is actually not too bad. At first I hated the idea of not knowing when they get published, and feeling like I had to spend several days in the middle of each month watching like a hawk on their website to see if they launched tickets for the next month or two or three. Not knowing exactly when tickets will become available was tough, but then I realized that, unlike with other fine dining restaurants that by 9AM when you can call 30 days prior to the day you want to come, no more times you want are available after several encounters with busy signals, this is indeed a better option. I was able to get the exact time and date I wanted. It was relieving. In terms of when to come I would say come early, like 5 or 5:15 or whenever the first table is, because otherwise you will get your surprises ruined by other people's tables getting them first. Alinea is indeed an unmissable dining phenomenon that if you have the chance of partaking in you will not regret. It deserves every single one of its three Michelin Stars and it brings a fresh approach to culinary arts. I was disappointed I did not get to meet the Chef, whose own battle with tongue cancer may have been a blessing in disguise since he was probably to emerge a better taster and creator of food than anyone else who never lost their taste buds.

When the first course of peach, champagne, and basil explodes in your mouth, you know you're in for a treat.  The progression throughout the night was natural and progressive of flavors, likely pulling from the knowledge Chef Achatz learned while at El Bulli. Of note, Chef has worked with some of the top chefs in the world including Chefs Adria, Trotter, and Keller.  Achatz is a master at his art and his expression of food shined throughout the meal. The second course had nine different items on the plate including a soup in the middle that we sipped with a steel straw between bites. The fourth course used meringue cracked on rock slabs and carrot spray to create graffiti on the ""plate"". The next notable dish including a charcoal fire at the table, which ultimately turned out to be a hidden tube of chicken wrapped up in seaweed that our server carved table side.  That was combined with cooked peppers and flowers that started off hanging over our heads for the first few courses.  We were all shocked! Everyone loved the truffle courses, most notably the hot potato cold potato.  The truffle and potato combined with a truffle sauce for a slurp-able (think oyster) treat.  Not far behind was the single bite ravioli that exploded with Parmesan and black truffle.   The dessert courses began with a cheesecake dish that also resembled street grafitti.  The berries and hibiscus flavors paired well with the marshmallow like cheesecake, and the Sauternes dessert wine paired by the sommelier was especially amazing. Next, each person at the table received a balloon filled with apple and helium.  You have to put your face on the balloon towards the top and suck out the flavor as the balloon starts to implode on your face.  As it deflates, you eat the apple taffy flavored balloon and string.  Lots of fun and very unique idea to put a smile on everyone's face! For the finale, Chef Achatz came over to create the dessert literally on the table. The staff placed a special rubber tarp on the table so we could eat right off of it.  Chef flung tropical sauces all over the table and delicately placed fruits and other mini morsels of goodness in front of each guest.  Then he placed a nitrogen smoking dinosaur egg at the table and sprinkled some golden dust, before smashing it into pieces and releasing all of the trapped nitrogen over the table.  Finished with a bang, literally! Then we lapped up all the sauces and mini dessert treasures.  Everything was delicious and no one felt they over ate.  Perfect amount of food and wines that were expertly paired to compliment each dish.  I will absolutely return in the future, likely in a few months when there are some new dishes to experience.  The entire meal was a well orchestrated food and wine experience that few others in the world can come close to matching.  Alinea truly deserves their three Michelin stars.  Hats off to the entire staff for giving us an amazing level of service and experience.",0.9955,0.85,0.128,0.022,0.5343999292112499

We recently were in Chicago for a conference and did not have reservations. If you sign up for their Twitter feed they post their open tables the day before.  These tables that open up are mostly for 4, but if there are only 2 of you (as it was for us) you can post on Twitter that you are looking for 2 others to share your table.  We did that and found someone in less than 5 minutes.  We actually really enjoyed getting to know our 2 new friends over dinner as well!",0.9715,0.841,0.159,0.0,0.5600932400932401

2015-07-03,4.0,"This review is for their December 2014 menu (and contains detailed spoilers, so I waited half a year to write this review until their menu changes enough). If you're looking forward to visiting Alinea soon and love surprises, try refraining from reading too many reviews! It'll ruin some of the wonder & joy.  First off, from the outside it's very inconspicuous and it's easy to go right past Alinea; our Uber driver zoomed right past it. The entrance is a long corridor that enhances your anticipation and curiosity. Once your coat is taken and you're seated, you won't get a print out of your tasting menu until the very end. You'll have to let go and listen as your server walks you through your night. One nice touch is they noted it was our 3 year anniversary and wrote Happy Anniversary at the top of our menu at the end! We didn't pick the option of wine pairings, but from the conversations we heard around us the servers will explain in-depth all of the pairing choices and some of them seemed enticing enough. Not sure if it'll be worth the extra ~$100 though. All in all, it took us about 2.5 to 3 hours to complete the 16 courses. Your servers never rush you, except it might be wise to try to keep up with the tables around you since it'll ruin the surprise if you keep overhearing every dish. The whole menu is timed well with portion sizes that are somehow figured out just right. You end up decently satisfied; you're not stuffed but also not still hungry at the end. It's definitely an experience you won't forget, but also something I wouldn't be able to justify doing again any time soon unless I won the lottery tomorrow. I did notice that some of the dishes were a bit too salty for my liking and overpowered some of the other flavors I would have liked to enjoy, hence the 4 stars. I think I over-hyped it in my head and read too many reviews beforehand so it wasn't as magical as I would hope a $300 experience would be. Of course, Grant Achatz is still a gastronomical genius and the experience was still special. I think I would have loved to have seen him cook or learned more about the special/unique cooking processes behind some of the dishes to appreciate what I was eating more. Courses: #1) Osetra- traditional russian caviar with an egg yolk pudding, a lemon&red onion&caper clear jelly, and a brioche bread foam served with an abalone spoon #2) Salsify- strip of salsify root dried and soaked in soy hidden in this nest of branches. pretty much tasted like extremely salty jerky once we found it #3) Skate- served on a plate designed to look like an appetizer napkin; we were instructed to eat it holding the plate in our palm as if we were at a cocktail party. skate fish with brown butter, lemon, and herbs #4) Pebble- made to look like if you were to look at the bottom of a bubbling stream full of pebbles. assortment of beans (pebbles), poached ebi (shrimp), ogo (seaweed branch), white mushroom caps and white bean cream  #5) John Dory- cubes of john dory fish with thai influenced peanut cream sauce, white sauce and broccoli microgreen florets, topped with vietnamese coriander. heavy asian influence served in an almost sushi-like fashion, all on top of a very long, aged and cured plank of wood from an old barrel. This was our favorite dish of the night; fun to eat and I love sushi. #6) Eggplant- cocoa nibs and mustard seeds in hot fresh ginger, lemongrass (taken from the centerpiece above our table) based curry broth with eggplant decorated with cilantro, pickled jalapeño all sitting on top of banana  #7) Matsutake (silver bowl)- slices of matsutake pine mushroom torched at our table side on top of soy tapioca pearls in abalone white cream #8) Hamachi (fire setting in the middle)- hamachi (yellowtail) chunk, green bean, and shishito green pepper speared on a pine branch for roasting over the mini fire to our preference #9) Pork Belly *SPOILERS*- this dish is hidden inside the fire in the ashes the whole time as a seaweed wrapped pork belly that our server retrieved and removed the burnt edges. Pork belly, blackened parsnip spear served on top of a hot charred oak tree trunk log with squid ink, black garlic, kombu seaweed and mystery orange sauce #10) Hot Potato Cold Potato- Tiny, time-sensitive delicate dish of hot potato, truffle, butter that we had to unpin and drop into cold potato creme soup and drink back like a shot. served in a tiny wax saucer #11) Squab- this was my first time having pigeon and it was surprisingly tasty. Came with beet, orange sauce, and some smoky dark flavors #12-16 were dessert courses that finished with the infamous Tropical Fruit smash drawing on the table. All of them were delicious and so fun to eat- especially the Taffy Apple Helium balloon that you eat after sucking out the helium and talking like daffy duck.",0.999,0.834,0.15,0.016,0.5114006628292344

2015-06-26,5.0,"I surprised my better half with an overnight trip to Chicago and Alinea for our anniversary.  Decor: Minimal. The dining area and restaurant as a whole does not offer much. The very lightly decorated walls and hallways leading to your table may leave some wanting more but I found it terribly appropriate. Very few distractions to take away from your dinner companion or the meal. Dinner: Incredible. 18- courses. Each different from the other and very carefully assembled. Plating and presentation are precise and inventive. For an 18 - course pris fixe menu I was very impressed that none fell flat. It's very difficult to please a palette of a stranger that's not choosing the dishes they order and Alinea nailed it.  Service: One of the more memorable parts of our dining experience was the demeanor of the staff. For a restaurant that knows it's worth in the food community that staff carried themselves with modesty and simple charm. Table side jokes and conversation made our evening even more special than it already was. Alcohol: We were presented with a few beverage options, and we decided to nix the pairings and just order a bottle of wine. The sommelier was courteous and engaged. We asked a lot of questions, mostly to pick his brain. He didn't rush us in the least bit. Cost: Everything you've been told is true. In the end we probably spent around $750. Worth it.  Bonus: At the end of your meal they provide you with a printed menu that describes the plates served that evening. They customized ours with a happy anniversary message, unfortunately we forgot it in our cab at the hotel. When we returned to Ohio I sent the restaurant an email hoping they may reprint and mail it to us for a cost; they were quick to respond, I had it 2 days later and they refused my offer to make a payment.  5/5.",0.9882,0.797,0.151,0.052,0.5551455026455027

This is not the final price, once you're there wine and tip are additional.  So the night of our special dinner finally came and my BF and I were both very excited about trying Alinea for the first time. We got to the place and it looked like a warehouse from the outside. We walked down a long dimly lit hallway with no decor, and with some confusion, we reassured each other that this must be the master chef's way of luring you into a surprise. At the end of the hallway, we eventually ended up at the entrance to the restaurant. We were greeted and escorted to our table. Eh, not much of a surprise there.  We decided not to do wine pairing but ordered wine by the glass. Then our evening began. One by one, our 15-18 course meal came out. The food was good, but nothing really wowed us. The flavor was too salty for our tastes. We sent some dishes away half eaten, which was a little unexpected to the staff I guess because I heard them asking each other, ""What happened there?"" The only memorable thing for me was the dessert presentation at the very end. It was beautifully performed, although I didn't eat much of that dessert.  We paid over $700 for our dinner and I didn't think it was worth it at all. The staff was very nice and service was great, but it got a little uncomfortable after awhile because the room was very small and there was a guy (supervisor?) who just stood there and watched everyone. I know his job was to quickly attend to people's needs, but by standing there and watching us eat, it was very uncomfortable. We also were afraid to use our normal voices or talk about certain things because it was very quiet in the room, so anything you say could be heard by the customer next to you or that supervisor.  It was a unique dining experience, but definitely not worth the price.",0.982,0.853,0.113,0.034,0.5691913341913343

I was amazed that the ornament that hung over our table became soup and trying to find my food in a giant wicker ball...

However, when Chef Grant Achatz came out, to our table to perform his exquisite dessert finale. I was totally in awe of his talent! I wished I had brought his cookbook with me that night for his autograph.  I love Christopher Kostow's beautiful creations at The Restaurant in Meadowood, Napa Valley.

2015-05-10,5.0,"Alinea sits in a category of its own, as little needs to be said about its presence as one of the most acclaimed Michelin-starred restaurants, the countless James Beard awards it's garnered over the years, and its consistent ranking in the top 10 of Pellegrino's best restaurants in the world. Grant Achatz, the mastermind behind the restaurant and the ever-changing menu, is regarded by many as a culinary genius, so needless to say, Alinea had long been on my culinary bucket list, a ""To Do"" for a far-off day when I could eventually make the journey to Chicago. Sometimes, though, we might be lucky enough to have these decisions made for us. It's how I found myself in Chicago in January of this year (a less-than-ideal season for the city, it should be noted), making my way through the darkened passage to the entrance of Alinea. Even the first impression leaves guests reeling, a temporary discombobulation that will leave them wondering if they are, in fact, in the right place. Even after we were greeted, checked in, and seated in the main dining room, the actual adventure had yet to begin. The courses that followed were like none other that I've yet to encounter. Our very first course, a dish featuring Osetra caviar, brioche ""foam"", an egg yolk custard, and a red onion gelée, is one  I can still remember with startling accuracy. It was almost too tongue-in-cheek for my liking, but I was completely won over by how such staple ingredients had been completely transformed in texture and consistency, but nonetheless yielded a combination of flavors that just... worked. Neither did I expect the following course, which consisted of an intricate net of twigs in front of us; we were instructed to find the lone root of salsify that had been camouflaged between the branches, an exercise that was just as rewarding as eating the salsify, which had been cooked so that its texture and taste resembled jerky. There is a certain degree of showmanship here that can be found nowhere else. From the lengthy plank of wood that our Gurnard was served on, dotted with a white pepper cream, vietnamese coriander, and a broccoli purée, to the fire left to crackle and sizzle in the center of our table as we lightly toasted our slices of hamachi, to the chilled bowl that steadly spewed out vapor as we ate our sweet dish of Pear, an almond mousse, grapefruit, and oxalis, to the chance to bite into the helium-filled green apple balloon and giggle at the high-pitched voices that we were left with... The presentation and introduction of each course left me in sheer wonder, and in anticipation of the next surprise. And somehow, there are no sacrifices made in the quality and caliber of the food. Every element, from the small sliver of skate (encircled in a veritable garden of brown butter, lemon, and lemon), to the eggplant cooked sous vide (elevated by the lemongrass broth with hints of cocoa and curry), to the tender pork belly (which had masqueraded as a log in our miniature fire) was executed to perfection. I have yet to touch on the amount of research and scientific knowledge necessary to pull of most of these dishes - how does one capture the pure essence of chocolate in such a crystal-clear frozen distillation? Or what about the mechanics behind compressing watermelon, freezing a coconut, or turning a banana into a chewy, dense marshmallow? I don't like playing favorites, especially when it comes to comparing restaurants with dissimilar styles, cuisines, and approaches to food. What I will say, however, is that Alinea has offered the most memorable dining experience I've had to date. The sheer amount of thought and meticulousness that goes into each dish is truly unparalleled, and the entire 16 course meal becomes less of a ""dinner"" and more of a culinary masterpiece, with surprises to delight and impress at every turn. For those that have even the slightest inclination to visit Alinea - go. I can guarantee that it's a decision you won't regret.",0.996,0.863,0.114,0.023,0.43716931216931215

If you appreciate fine dining and are open to trying new, interesting things - you should definitely visit Alinea.

Yes, it's hard to get a reservation. You know both of these things going in. To me, the thing that makes Alinea so awesome is that it is highly unlikely you have ever seen or heard of the presentation and execution of these dishes before. I'll admit there were several courses that I flat-out didn't like. Either the flavor was too strong or it just wasn't something I connected with at all. But every single one of them made me smile. I will note that the menu we enjoyed was very vegetarian/seafood heavy. I think only one dish had pork, none had beef, and one had a component flavored with chicken. Everything else was either vegetable/fruit or some type of seafood.  Wait staff will be as stuffy or fun as you are to them. They are perfectly aware that the place is crazy, and there is nothing wrong with laughing or asking them what you may think are stupid questions. They get it. Tips:  We didn't have this option, but I do recommend going at the first seating if possible. We ate at 9:30, and I didn't have a problem with a 3 hour dinner late at night, but you will have some of the surprises spoiled by watching other tables receive their courses. It's not a big deal, but it would be even better if you saw things for the first time when they arrived at your table.

2015-04-03,5.0,"HOW I ENDED UP AT ALINEA: OMGosh Alinea, where do I start?! Last year while skimming through my Netflix account, I was in the mood for a documentary and what better than one about food? I chose ""Spinning Plates"", which is a documentary highlighting 3 different restaurants about their upcoming and shortfalls - one of the restaurants included in it was Alinea. Learning about Alinea for the first time, I was absolutely intrigued and knew I had to go someday. Fast forward to a year later and my girlfriend and I decide to take a trip to Chicago. After booking my flight and starting to plan the trip, I instantly thought of Alinea - I asked my girlfriend if she was down and I immediately purchased tickets that evening. I was ecstatic that there were tickets available during our trip time frame. REVIEW:  Our experience started off great with a trip to The Aviary prior to Alinea. Because our reservation times for both places were far apart from each other, the staff at the Aviary were able to contact Alinea and get us in earlier for the evening.  Alinea was an amazing experience that tantalized all of my senses and had my adrenaline rushing at times. From the minute you walk in to the restaurant, you're already feeling emotions and raising questions as you walk through the entrance to the hostess. The hostess was so sweet and showed us the kitchen prior to bringing us up to our seats. The service throughout the evening was impeccable - all of the servers are very professional, courteous, and you can tell that this restaurant has got it down and is a well oiled machine. The service is almost as if it was choreographed.  We ended up with about 19 courses - all of the food was delicious and a great experience with each. Some courses were more interesting than others, and some less. My favorite definitely was foraging through a basket of branches to find your food and the apple helium balloon. The culmination of the dinner as well as the finale is the dessert course. This was the part that I was most excited to experience. The dessert portion of your dinner is a whole experience in itself. From the moment that the servers placed out the items, to the chef ""painting"" the work of art dessert, to the moment I tasted the items - I felt all sorts of excitement. Everything here is so well thought out. When we first sat down, we had a bundle arrangement of herbs, etc. hanging above our heads. Only to sit there and wonder the entire time what the heck it's doing there - then you come upon the course where they incorporate it into one of the courses. I could go on and on... I would have liked to have the wine pairing along with my dinner, but after paying for the dinner itself, it was hard to cough up another $150 for the wine pairing. Instead, we asked the server what would go well with the meal if we were to only have one glass of something. He recommend Champagne and the delectable glass that we had lasted through dinner and was perfect. (Note: they only serve Champagne here from Champagne - ""none of that Sparkling Wine"" in the words of our server) To sum it up, Alinea was was such a great experience. To me, it wasn't going out for dinner - it was going out for dinner and a show. And such a great show for a food(ie) lover like me. I would definitely return if I am in Chicago again with my husband or family - I would love to be able to share in this experience again  with them.",0.9978,0.853,0.141,0.006,0.534056603773585
2015-04-02,2.0,"My experience may have been tempered by a recent trip to France, but the meal was so unsatisfying, I ate 2 bags of chips and a slice of pizza after dinner. Out of the maybe 14 courses, I enjoyed perhaps 5. The rooms were more depressing than a black and white Scandinavian film. Subdued grays and pale browns do not liven the spirits during a Chicago winter. I used the plural, because Alinea sits you in a series of small rooms creating claustrophobic dining. What sensual effect this was suppose to have is beyond my comprehension. The wines, while pleasant, were overpriced and the sommelier was unable to find any reds to meet my ""sweat sock,"" ""barnyard"" palate. The wines were all too young or ludicrously expensive. Service was perfunctory, at best, polite, efficient, but with no warmth or sense of humor. I presume the fanciful presentation of the food is suppose to provide the merriment. It didn't! If it wasn't for the couple next to us from Wisconsin, who laughed at my jokes, and the vodkas I downed before dinner, the experience would not have been fun at all. There was a great ""circus"" involved with the presentation, but Barnum and Bailey tickets should not cost $800.00. The eatable helium balloon made us talk funny. Wow! The dessert was spread out on a rubber tablecloth with an abstract design. Okay, I get it. However, it didn't taste good and the chef who ""performed"" did so without cheer.  I have eaten at some very creative restaurants in my lifetime, including Charlie Trotter's, Jean-Francois Piege, Arpege, Arzak, El Bulli, Alexandre Mazza's AM, and have enjoyed them all because the food tasted good, and everyone employed in the restaurant seemed to love what they were doing. (Except Charlie Trotter's, but that's another story). Alinea did not even come close to these other dining experiences and the cost was almost triple! Don't be mesmerized by the hoopla and media attention of Alinea. It simply wasn't good and the 75% of the dishes had no taste. A circus does not make fine dining.

The service was fantastic and the staff made the experience really positive (more so than the food).  The food was very good. It just didn't wow me. Although the food was executed very well, I don't remember ever thinking with respect to any dish ""That was an awesome, creative use of flavors"" or ""I would pay $$$$ to eat that again.""  That's a problem when the customer is paying several hundred dollars for a meal.

The food is experimental and challenges your conceptions about what food should look like, taste like (based on what you're looking at) and the whole performance of food as art. I do agree with another reviewer that while this was a dazzling array on the five senses, it did not leave satisfied from an eating perspective. There wasn't really a course that I enjoyed to the point where it was memorable because I enjoyed the taste, mostly remember things because of presentation or surprise of taste vs what i thought it would taste like looking at it. The only thing that I did not appreciate was the fact that the servers were joking around audibly and quite frankly, were distracting. It was as if I was being served by frat house brothers that decided one day to be servers. There is one course that needs to be lit and while a server was placing this dish on the table, another server stated something to the effect of ""I like how that went up in flames, kinda like your music career"". While funny, I expect that at Chilis or TGIF, not Alinea. That was definitely one of the major drawbacks. Finally, just a note to those who want to go, I would highly recommend just taking a 5pm or early slot. WHY? because you won't have anybody break the magic of what is to come and can discover each interesting point of each dish un-adulterated by someone nearby who might be ahead of you on the menu. just my 2 cents.",0.988,0.809,0.166,0.025,0.6784210526315789

I'm pretty sure a visit to Alinea today is nothing like the experience I had three years ago, so take this review with a grain of salt. Or maybe a bag of it, because I'm going to assume absolutely none of the following is accurate anymore. If you haven't heard of Alinea in Chicago or its head chef Grant Achatz*, you probably don't follow the food scene at all and are missing out on one of the most innovative restaurants and chefs of this generation. You're probably also very pale, because you've been living in a cave of some sort for the past decade. Grant Achatz was the only chef to be mentioned in Time Magazine's 100 most influential people of 2011** and actually battled through mouth cancer to create what is arguably the best restaurant in the United States. Mouth cancer. That's cancer. Of the mouth. On a chef. That'd be like Kim Kardashian getting butt cancer only to come back and win some sort of butt award for, uh, best butt? Or something? I don't know. That was a pretty bad analogy. When I called to make a reservation the hostess who took my call told me they were completely booked for the dates I was shooting for. My date called back less than an hour after I tried and miraculously found an opening.*** Apparently the fine folks at Alinea don't like the sound of my voice. I'd hold it against them, except for the fact that their food is so good they could hit me in the face with a hammer and I still wouldn't care. * I believe Grant Achatz has passed on day-to-day responsibilities to his chef de cuisine Mike Bagale. ** 2011.

2015-03-05,5.0,"Alinea. Wow. There aren't really words but I'll try. The building is unmarked and the doorman ushers you into a long, narrowing, almost pitch black hall and automatic doors open at the end and they take your coats and seat you. We were first to arrive in our section and we had three servers. I chose not to do the wine pairing as I'd read that it's a bit much. They told me they don't really have a wine list but they'd discus my preferences and choose for me accordingly - OK! Started off with a glass of champagne and some caviar with foam that actually tasted like a buttery brioche! Strangest thing - it was like something out of Charlie and the Chocolate. Second course they brought out a basket and woven into it, there were two edible roots and we had to feel for them and find them as they looked the same as the twigs the basket was made of. There were too many courses to list but one of them involved an actual 'camp fire' that they brought to the table with raw fish on pine twigs for you to roast. They then left the fire burning for ten minutes or so and when you thought they were coming to take it away - they pulled out a piece of pork belly wrapped in seaweed and a parsnip that looked exactly like the other logs! There was a shaved ice palate cleanser that was infused with the essence of chocolate - again, something so strange and almost unnerving - a clear ice that tasted exactly like creamy chocolate. Instructions were so specific ""Hold this with your non dominant hand"" etc. If you left your seat, they instantly pull out your chair for you and replace your napkin with a brand new folded one. I've never experienced service like it. They anticipated everything and it was almost more of a choreographed dance. One dish was served on a broken piece of concrete with truffle meringue that looked like more concrete and the server ""tagged"" it with a can of spray paint that was actually a balsamic reduction. The edible helium balloon was super fun! Same sort of texture as cotton candy but actually tasted like green apple. Not the gross synthetic ""green apple"" flavour you're used to though. Finally, and unexpectedly, Chef Achatz came out and painted all of the elements of our desert on the table and my husband asked him if he'd be offended if we took a few photos. He's incredibly gracious and we felt so honoured to be in the presence of such a genius. The desert was out of this world - caramelized banana, frozen coconut, passionfruit, pineapple - he'd taken all of the the flavours and condensed and enhanced them, completely reimagined the textures and then formed them back to looking somewhat like the original ingredient.  Before we left, we were given the opportunity to watch the kitchen for a few minutes and it was so incredibly organized. Dozens of people in white preparing things while people in black barked weird codes and instructions - they were like the coxswains of the kitchen. All in all, not an experience either of us will be forgetting for a very long time.",0.995,0.837,0.125,0.037,0.36368637423182876
2015-03-04,5.0,"Solid 4.5 Yelp star experience. Reservations are made in tables of 2, 4 or 6 and must be paid upfront like concert tickets. Like every other fool here, I bought expensive tickets here about 2 months in advance for a 4 seat table for my two sisters and I and sold the fourth ticket to a random person off Craigslist a week before my trip. I think I was really lucky to find a buyer for the ticket, so maybe try your luck on Craigslist or Alinea's Facebook page for other buyers and sellers.  My reservations were at 5 and we arrived early and got seated and served first. Other tables who dined in the same room with us had to witness all the cool molecular gastronomy tricks at our table first. So please try to get the earliest reservations as possible so that other tables don't ruin the surprises!  Alinea by far serves the best tasting, innovative molecular gastronomy cuisine I've ever experienced. I've had dinner at WD 50 by Chef Wylie Defresne and it pales in comparison to what Chef Grant Achatz is doing at Alinea. Sure it's twice as expensive but worth it. Would I come back here? Maybe.

2015-02-18,3.0,"Performance Art   ...........................(and food) So much has been written about Alinea, I almost didn't post here.  What could I add to the conversation?  So, read on if you want one man's impressions of a legend..... I have just deleted my saved draft of the review I wrote the evening of dinner at Alinea.  It was not wholly complimentary, to say very little.  I decided not to post it that night because I needed to cool off.  Why?  Some words found in that review:  Fleeced. BS.  Disappointing. So, here I am after much consideration, writing what I feel to be a fair review of my thoughts/experience at Alinea.  *(Quick note:  I am an experienced eater and former chef/restaurant owner and former wine merchant.  I have what I consider to be a full understanding of food and wine, and eat in restaurants often. I also travel a bit). I come away feeling that this place is mostly about performance.  I went in with the expectation that it was about food.  I realize that Alinea provides way more than food.  But I wish they did more with the food.  How I mean that, is my soul was left cold by the food.  Yes, it was playful, yes it was artful, yes it was challenging.  But it wasn't satisfying. It didn't reach into me and fill me with joy, or comfort, or passion.   Entering: Long dark hallway leading to the front door, where we were greeted by a very pleasant young lady.  Taken upstairs to a corner table that was a round black stained table which struck me as underwhelming.  Very minimum decoration throughout the room, almost to a fault.  My thinking was that at this price, maybe a few limited editions of Richter?  Something? Service: As good as it gets.  Highly polished and still very personable.  A small village ultimately addresses the table over so many courses, and that works well here. We needed/wanted for nothing. Confident and enthusiastic, refined and comfortable. Wine Service: My hat is off to the sommelier here.  VERY impressive pairings with very challenging food.  I had the ""reserve"" (?) wines while my friends opted for the standard.  He was packed full of knowledge, utterly gracious, and could communicate what the thinking was for pairings, as well as some geeky info exceedingly well.  He alone adds a star if not more to this ""restaurant"". Food: Everything you've heard is true.  This is outside of the box.  Which I like. At 18 or so courses, doing this kind of performance requires incredible skill and creativity, which they quite obviously have.  But it takes concentration and skill on the diner's part as well to even begin to try to appreciate what is intended.  It also takes endurance. Because of the endurance needed,  I look back and I think the menu is front end loaded.  In that the hits are sent out early in the meal.  It seemed to me that as the performance proceeded, after about the midpoint, each dish, or act, was a little less than the previous, save for the spectacular Hot Potato/Cold Potato truffle course.  This is dish was one of the best dishes I have ever had in my life.  The one place they infused some soul. Of course every act had a brilliant presentation, and the wine as previously mentioned elevated the food.  But it did seem anticlimactic moving forward.  Or maybe our excitement of such an anticipated evening had fallen back to earth??? Of note, there were a couple of courses that tasted of nothing but charcoal. I suspect this was intended.  One of these courses came to the table on fire.  During this part of the performance, I did not finish 3 or 4 courses, simply because they tasted awful. Sadly disappointing.   Then sweets.  The helium apple balloon is genius.  AND tasted good! The painted table for dessert is very impressive from an artists perspective.  A live painting done by 2 men in kitchen whites.  I think the value of what they painted far exceeded what we ate.  It was a beautifully executed canvas, done with skill and just the right amount of flair as to not be too cutesy.  But then the eating again.  Nothing spectacular. Overall: 3 Stars- Not sure what else to give. Closer to 2 than 4. When dinner for 4 cost's $2,400.00 I want my soul stirred.  Alinea didn't come close to that. When I left that night, I felt that I should have donated the money I spent to a hungry family. Or four.  I am not of the ilk that is trying to save the world.  But this experience left me with that.  It was not at all what I expected to be feeling as I walked out the door.  I feel like I lost on this bargain.  I wanted to leave feeling that I had just experienced something special. Not this particular evening.  If you have read this, thanks for taking the time.  Feel free to scream at me for not appreciating genius. If you're thinking about attending a performance here, go for it.  I know I won't be returning, mostly because I don't like to feel fleeced after dinner.   Buona Fortuna!",0.9958,0.81,0.136,0.054,0.5373356676003734

2015-02-14,5.0,"My one concern before dining at Alinea was that they were going to be stuffy and full of themselves, because...well...because they're Alinea. But that could not have been further from the truth! The staff was all friendly and attentive (including the stellar Beau, Jaime and Craig), and the dining experience itself was fun and whimsical. (Yes, whimsical. At Alinea. Who would have guessed?!) And it truly is a dining ""experience"", from first entering the restaurant down a Space Mountain-type hallway, to searching for one of your courses in the ""branch camouflage"" dish...kind of a ""Where's Waldo"" of food.  The food itself was almost flawless. I did think the sauce on the squab was a bit overpowering, and there was a bit too much going on in the eggplant/banana/cocoa/curry dish, but with 16 courses and associated wine pairings, there is plenty to take your mind off those near misses. Seriously, the Chicken Skin, the Hot Potato and the Maitake Abalone were probably three of the best things I've ever eaten in my life. The only thing I thought didn't work at all was the tropical fruit dessert. It's a cool concept...it's actually plated on the table (not ""at"" the table....but ""on"" the table) by the chef. Unfortunately, Chef Grant Achatz is not the most personable guy (and that's okay...chefs do not have to be talkative and friendly), so the result is he very mechanically makes what should be a fanciful dessert, and then turns and walks away. To me, it just left a bitter taste at the end of a near perfect dinner. But, he's a master in the kitchen...no one will argue that!

2015-02-03,4.0,"Dear Gods of Gluttony, You have truly given the power of taste to Grant Achatz and the Alinea team. I am astonished at how incredible this meal was. Almost $2,000 for a party of 4, and yet it was so incredibly worth it.  I wasn't even phased by the chunk in my wallet, I was only saddened by the fact the meal had ended.  Every single dish was fantastically executed, with wonderful theatrics, molecular gastronomy, and taste. From the first small bite of the osetra caviar my tongue was salivating and every dish I wanted more and more. I was trying so hard not to lick EVERY SINGLE PLATE I honestly thought they must've put some sort of addictive additive to make it taste so good.  Obviously the menu changes constantly, and the fall menu was inspired to be almost dark, bursting with ""fall like"" flavors. Rhubarb, herbs, roots, aromatic herbs and spices, gamey meats, sweet breads, and the contrast of taste, smell, hot cold sensations. This meal is so diverse it's hard to even describe.  Alinea is literally an experience. It's the Disneyworld of food - everywhere you turn you will be stimulated in ways you never thought possible and even if you don't know what the hell you just put in your mouth you don't care because that taste - the medley of flavor profiles triggers your brain and you learn that this is not just food - THIS IS LIFE. This is living to eat in every essence of the word and it is so damn worth it.  The only hang up as to why I am so terribly conflicted when it comes to Alinea is that although the food, the genius, the pure art form is so impeccable and worth a full 5 stars, the service and the sommelier simply fell short.  Of all the 3 Michelin Starred restaurants I've been to, Jean-Georges had the best service by far, and none of the other places can even compare. But I figured Alinea would have some sort of service standard being so critically acclaimed. I was so appalled by the ""we don't have to treat you well because you are at Alinea and you're lucky to be here"" vibe that it made the dinner almost annoying....In addition, the sommelier was terrible! He didn't describe what we were drinking because he had absolutely no clue, one of the sake pairs was so appalling to some of us we told him to take it away and he didn't even replace it with another so we went without a pairing for a few of the dishes. granted we were paying a pretty penny for the wine pairing you would thing they would honor a replacement... Also the pours were so sparse the tiny splash in our glass would barely even be considered a taste!! I would definitely not recommend the wine pairing - that is FOR SURE.  All in all, if you've got the cash shell it out. Buy your tickets months in advance - it's completely worth the trouble and planning.  Can't wait to come back again...next time I'm in Chicago I'm buying consecutive tickets for every single day I am there - if I can afford it... hahaha",0.978,0.806,0.122,0.072,0.5605235042735044
2015-02-02,4.0,"I was lucky to get tickets to Alinea as weekend tickets were really hard to come by. I brought my significant other here to surprise him for our anniversary. The entrance was a little hard to find but luckily I knew what it looked like beforehand. I did have a hard time surprising my SO since he had no idea why we're pulling the car up to a grey building. He finally realized when a car moved and saw the valet parking sign for Alinea. They have a mystical entrance. The decor of the place was nice and simple.The staff/hostess downstairs were overall friendly. The presentation of the food was beautiful. The dishes were very unique and each had a theme. The best dish I had was the black truffle explosion. It is exactly what others mentioned, simply amazing. I wish more dishes had truffle in them. I really enjoyed the apple candy balloons as I thought it was beautiful and special. It also tasted pretty great. The table dessert was tasty although the chef that came to do it could  of been more personable and made eye contact at some point. He clearly was told to try to make small chat as he mumbled doing his job. He did the exact same thing at the next table. You can clearly tell he's basically a robot going off a script. The waiters were laid back although it would of been nice if some were friendlier. I read on Yelp that they were friendly but unfortunately I did not get the impression there. The staff was attentive and probably had a total of 6 rotating staff. Only two of them were friendly. The original guy who introduced himself (head waiter?) was snotty. It was also a little disturbing to me that I while I was eating the food, I saw the staff chit chatting, etc. I also saw one of the staff that I actually thought was friendly getting yelled by the possibly ""head waiter?"" and when the waiter tried to respond, he got shhssh. I thought that was little rude since I wasn't even close by and was able to hear it.  It was uncomfortable and awkward to hear it. My meal was rushed as the waiters kept coming over to see if I was finished eating while I was still holding my utensil. I felt that this was suppose to be a dining experience, not a fast food joint so please do not do that. I can definitely tell they were on a scheduled and was trying to clear tables asap. The ""head waiter"" basically rushed and ushered us out of the place. I tried to take a photo while I was downstairs by the kitchen and he seemed annoyed and kept trying to have me put on my coat while we had to wait some time before our car was pulled up with out coats on. This particular waiter could definitely use some manners.  Overall the ""food"" experience was positive. I would of left 5 stars if all the waiters were friendlier or perhaps the one who initially seated me/shhhshed the waiter wasn't there. I do feel that my experience was slightly ruined by him. For about a $700 dollar meal excluding alcohol, I would expect friendlier staff! Alinea's food is definitely something to try and quite a special experience.

But it's not the absence of bad courses that makes this restaurant so special but instead, it's the unbelievably amazing courses. The hot potato, cold potato bite serves my favorite vegetable in 2 ways that are combined in the mouth that explodes your taste buds. The Pork Belly and Parsnip that were simmering in the fire that cooked the previous dish was delicious. The corn with truffle, manchego, and sherry was literally the best corn dish I've ever had. But nothing compares to the dessert at the end. The frozen coconut. The completely wrong textured fruits. The delicious sauces to dip everything in.

We were served 16 courses in all, seated around 5 PM and finished eating around 7:50, and lingered a bit, so overall there for about 3 1/2 hours.  It was a spectacular journey, and a great experience, but I won't give it 5 stars, because as amazing as the food was, I don't think I'd say it was worth the hefty price tag. There were some dishes that I was like--- this is phenomenal and OMG GOOD, but other dishes that were just average--- and I think for the price, you would expect to be blown away by every dish. My favorite was an eggplant soup dish, a cold potato/hot potato concept they had and the famous final dessert course where they create a piece of artwork on your table, right in front of you. The mix of coconut, mango, passionfruit and chocolate was absolutely delicious--- and it was so fun eating by scraping food off the table! Service was spot on--- the waiters had a great sense of humor, were so helpful in explaining everything that was being served in front of us, and weren't too hard on the eyes either. :) AND the chef who came out to create our final dessert course for us, Michael, was beautiful and his voice was so sexy...

2015-01-24,5.0,"(I'll simply copy/paste my previous review posted elsewhere)  I'll fill in the other ones as well.  But just a few thoughts on the meal.  I suppose that this type of meal isn't going to be for everyone...you have to be ready to go on a food journey (so to speak), rather than expect to sit down and eat some good food.  I don't believe I would have been ready to enjoy this meal had the time been 15 years earlier, it just wouldn't have been my thing at that time.  But it sure is now!  Don't get me wrong though, I'll always appreciate street food and those hidden little gems that we find as well.     Is a meal like this worth the money?  I would equate a meal like this to a culinary amusement park.  Your on a ride, on a journey...your experiencing food as it's presented to you.  Each thing may not be your favorite.  But it doesn't have to be, sometimes it's just there to bring you to another set of flavors.  To me (as an adult), this one meal was worth far more than an entire trip to DisneyLand.  Of course, I enjoy Florida a lot...but I would rather go from beach to beach and eat the fresh catch of the day before going to one of the amusement parks.    I believe I can cook decent at times, and I really love to eat.  I sometimes come up with decent ideas, but don't always pull it off the way I'd like to.  I've improved over the years and have much room to continue growing as a home cook.  I say this to describe that when I go out...even when eating some stellar food, I can normally think to myself, that I can get ideas from this...or I should be able to duplicate this...this is very doable.  This doesn't mean that I'll nail it the first time, but I'll usually walk out feeling as though I should be able to achieve that too...or at least strive toward that.     But there have been two times when I felt total inadequacy in my cooking ability, this was one of them.  I have been to a number of places that were supposed to be stellar and got very good food.  A good number of the places I also got tasting menu's just like this one...they always fell a bit short.  But twice I was awestruck with amazement of the flavors, textures and overall food experience that I just had.       The first place where I felt like this was when I ate at Le Francais, in Wheeling, Il.  I've been to a number of well respected French restaurants in the Chicagoland area and none ever came close to the level of execution that they performed at Le Francais.  The Michelin Star restaurants, in Chicagoland, that I've gone to haven't even come close either...some were okay (some less than), some decent...some darn good!  But they never measured up to the attention to detail, balance, flavors, textures as Le Francais.  Until now.  Alinea isn't a French restaurant, but they hit on so many of the parallels of excellence in culinary perfection that I felt Le Francais hit on.  Seriously, I never though I'd experience food at that level again.     I don't know if I would recommend someone go here...I just don't know if it would be to their liking.  But I can say, at least this experience at Alinea...was right in my wheelhouse...it was outstanding!    For anyone interested in Grant Achatz cooking...or in the cuisine that he makes I can't recommend enough buying Alinea - cookbook.  Amazon has this beautiful hardcover for a very nice price.  The pages are nicely done and the book covers a wide range of his tasting menu's.  It runs through the different tasting menu's throughout the year...as they change with the different seasons.  But before you get into the recipes you will read how to use the cookbook and how to read the recipes.  They also explain what their philosophy is and what they're trying to convey as you cook these recipes.  Now don't get me wrong...some of these recipes are goofy, and quite involved.  But if you have interest I believe there is a good bit to be learned from reading through his recipes and trying to get an understanding about what he's trying to do...and how he's going about it.       If you would like to read about Grant Achatz - Life, on The Line.  This is a remarkable story about his life and experiences as a Chef.  While I can appreciate the book and hear it's very good...it's not really my thing to read.",0.9992,0.806,0.185,0.009,0.4852421802054156

2015-01-20,3.0,"Overall:  I couldn't have been more excited to eat here and knew what I was getting into.  I tempered my expectations so I didn't go in expecting the best meal of my life.  In the end it was a really memorable experience and one that I'm glad I've got to say I've done.  But the food itself was definitely a let down.  I feel like Alinea has transitioned into the 'touristy' world-class dining establishment now, where it's mostly show and the cache of eating there and they know they can give less, cut corners with cost, and still be full every night and make more profit.   Service: It was fantastic. Just laid back and nice, friendly people.  Somm was awesome for the wine pairings and descriptions.  The whole flow of the evening was great.  We didn't feel rushed one bit as some people have been saying.  Our dinner was exactly 3 hours. Food:  I just can't believe I'm saying it, but there just weren't many dishes that we felt were standouts.  A few real high points, but a lot of forgettable dishes. We all agreed that Sixteen and Girl and the Goat both blew Alinea out of the water in terms of overall taste.   Meat:  I am not a huge eater and I rarely, if ever, complain about the size of portions, but I feel like Alinea should be embarrassed with their meat offerings.  Look at what was served to diners in the past, with the Lamb 86 or Duck!!! as the main entree course. Impressive and substantial.  Now it is a piece of squab that I kid you not is either 2 large bites or 3 small ones.  And it's pretty pedestrian in flavor as well. The only other meat was a small piece of pork belly that was probably 3 bites as well. It was good but have definitely had better.  The lack of a star protein really hurts the overall meal.  It transitions to desert not with a bang, but a really sad whimper.     So, if you can afford it, go and say you've been to a restaurant that once was considered the best in the world.  But go now because I don't think people will be saying that for too many more years.",0.9895,0.785,0.159,0.055,0.5278324514991181

They are very well traveled foodies but this was their first trip to Chicago. After the meal I was told that Alinea now one of their favorites. The Menu was centered around fish this time and was full of surprises. All of the dishes were well though out and plated to perfection. I was lucky enough to eat at the French Laundry this past year and Alinea was superior in all categories. The wait staff was down to earth and friendly and the flavor profiles were superb.  My only problem with the night was that the table next to us received two dishes that we were not offered. They got black truffle explosion and white truffle pasta dish on top of standard tasting menu.  Luckily we ate at Next the night before and had Trio menu which included the black truffle explosion ( I highly recommend NEXT). Being a returning customer and having spent a pretty penny at Next I would have hoped to have at least been offered these dishes. O well we still had a great time.

2015-01-12,4.0,"I wanted to treat my husband to a wonderful dinner for his graduation. I heard so many good things about this place. It was considered the #1 restaurant in the US and in the world's top for ten the past few years. Since we were going to be in Chicago at the time, I stalked the computer until they released their dinner tickets. Getting Reservations - Not your typical process. You have to wait until they announce online that they have released the tickets for their tasting menu. Usually they release tickets two months in advanced (i.e. releasing tickets for June in April). Seven minutes after they put up the message, I got on their website and saw that all the times between 5:30 and 8:30 were taken. That was quick. We had to settle with 5:30. If you don't jump on it quick, you will not get the date/times you want. I believe they only accept parties 2, 4, and 6. Sometimes they will list cancellations on their Facebook page so you might be able to get in that way as well. Remember that each person will be 225+, not including wine pairings.  The Service - service was awesome as you can imagine. My gosh they were attentive. Ready and quick to clean off your plate and bring on the next course. Walked me to the bathroom and had a new napkin to put on my lap each time i came back. Gratuity is already included in the price so you don't have to worry about that. Very friendly and not at all stuck up like I would expect them to be at one of the top restaurants in the world.  The Food - for the most part the food amazed me. You get 15 to 20 dishes and the meal will last 2+ hours. I was very surprised by the different ways food could be displayed and created. I would never expect certain flavors to go with certain ingredients (i.e. maple syrup and swiss chard). Some of them worked and some of them were a little too outlandish for my taste. I'm very simple when it comes to food. My favorite dishes were the flamed cooked kobe beef, the lobster, their version of orange chicken, the black truffle explosion, the strawberry infused watermelon, the taffy balloon, and the final chocolate dessert. SERIOUSLY, the desserts were so creative and delicious. Overall impression - I can see why this place is so famous. The food is so unique in presentation and taste. It's fun just to see them at work. You will never have another meal like this in your life. Molecular gastronomy at its finest. Be prepared for the unfamiliar.

Alinea is a perfect example of trendiness, presentation, and just generally being ""out there"" has completely lost the meaning of great food. The portions were microscopic, that's not that unusual today, but it's not that great either. The food was good sure, but not really all that exceptional or memorable. The service was delivered by very nice people, but the ENTIRE meal was rushed through. I have no idea why. When paying $750.00 or more for two people I don't think the food should come out like a Lucille Ball Bakery Conveyer Belt, but it most certainly did, all 15 courses in a row. Had the wine pairing as well. Probably 3 excellent wines out of a dozen. And each subsequent wine was delivered to my table before I finished the prior one. All in all, I have to say that I think there must be a better way to earn a 3 michelin star rating. My pinnacle of restaurants remains Jean Banchet's Le Francais, which, of course, closed many years ago. Charlie Trotters was better in every way than this restaurant.Pretty disappointed across the board, I'd have to say.",0.9894,0.778,0.186,0.036,0.59945620223398

2015-01-06,5.0,"Alinea sure delivered. Probably the most impressionable meal i've ever had. Nowadays to make it to the top, it's no longer only about taste, quality, presentation, and service; there needs to be an ""x"" factor, known as the experience -- interactive experience. Bf took me here for my bday dinner; we had 16 courses, and each dish was unique. Some more unique than others of course, can't get it all perfect now. But yeah, i love how the dishes are interactive and stirs conversation. When we first walked to our table, there was a piece of rhubarb hanging above the table. Bf says, wouldn't it be funny if we actually ate it? Low and behold, it ended up in our tummy by course 6. Another course had a birds nest made out of branches, the food was camouflaged within the nest, and we had to search to eat them. The taste of this dish was kinda salty, but i loved the playful element.  Our meal ended with a bang, literally. A chef came to the table, layed out a white cloth, and used the table as his canvas and started painting with the 12 ingredients in front of him, which were made out of dried fruits, purees, jams, candies. There are a large candied ball and he cracked that at the end. We dug into the artwork with our spoons. The moment before scooping up my first bite, i truly felt like a 5 year old in a candy shop, absolutely mesmerized. Green apple taffy helium balloon was super creative, but i'm sure everybody writes about that so that's all i'll say.  Warning: i think it goes without me saying, make your reservation way ahead. Surprisingly, my bf got one 1.5 months ahead, but it was also for a Wed night. You pay for the bill including tax and tip upfront, so if you can't go on the day of, you have to sell your ticket, or forfeit. Be prepared to spend your evening dining.

2015-01-05,5.0,"It's hard to describe Alinea without sounding cliche, or to accurately convey the degree to which it absolutely exceeded everything that I would want in a dining experience. For context, I should say that while I certainly enjoy eating out, I wouldn't consider myself a foodie in the sense that I frequent Michelin-star-level restaurants. As such, I was a little worried that the experience at Alinea would be intimidating and stuffy, or that I would fail to appreciate it by virtue of having an unsophisticated palette.  My fears turned out to be unfounded and I can say without reservation that it was the best meal of my life. While I could go on about the meal, I'll just summarize my experience in a few points: Service - Absolutely welcoming and disarming. From arriving at the restaurant and through the courses and wine pairing, the staff was accommodating, warm, and deft. Atmosphere - While the building is somewhat unassuming from the outside, the interior does an excellent job of removing distraction and encouraging you to be present without stealing focus from the food. Very modern and comfortable. Food - I think that, in looking at pictures from Alinea, it feels like a natural assumption that the presentation and the quality of the flavors or satisfaction of the portions would somehow be in tension, and that achieving the absolute best in one category would be necessarily to the detriment of the others. If this is in fact the case, you wouldn't know it from our experience, which included the most impressive (and often surprising) presentations of food with most original and satisfying composition of flavors and textures I've ever had in a meal. The three hour service absolutely flew by. Cost - While Alinea is certainly a luxury-priced ticket, it is worth every penny. If you treat it like the singular experience that it is, bring energy and interest to the table, you'll leave feeling thankful for the experience as I did and never miss the money. Tip - I would recommend showing up for an earlier slot, and to keep you eyes on your own table as much as possible. Surprise is a big component of the experience, so if you show up later or focus on what's happening with people that are farther along in their courses than you, you're likely to spoil some of that (I'm sure it would still be awesome, though).  If there's any way you can get here, go for it - you'll never regret it.",0.9966,0.758,0.197,0.045,0.592956857956858

Truthfully, I was disappointed in the protein selections.  Aside from a squab dish and a pork belly dish, there were no other meats.  I would have loved some steak and game.  But I'm a carnivorous gal.  Also, I would have preferred one more main course in place of a dessert.  I left dinner a little hungry.  Regardless, Alinea truly provided a dining experience of a lifetime.  I'm so glad I went.

2014-12-08,1.0,"Quite disappointing. Ideas and concepts are quite stale and haven't been refreshed in years. Other restaurants have started to take these ideas and have done a better job executing them or improving upon. However, the most disappointing aspect of the experience was the service. Given the cost of the meal and the reputation of the establishment, the staff CANNOT be rude, smug and impolite. For example, several people at our table did not like the taste of parsley and stated that at the beginning of the meal. The kitchen instead replaced this herb with cilantro, which has a very similar taste to which a novice chef would be confused with. Instead of taking this opportunity to educate us on the differences and similarities btw parsley and cilantro, he took every chance he could to correct us on how we never identified the difference for him.  This unacceptable approach to the situation was the first of many that started to turn me off with the place. Other examples include his impatience on waiting for us to decide on the wine pairings and the $120 truffle dish that all at the table must get if one person would like to try. Not only did he not allow us an opportunity to discuss amongst the table, he showed annoyance when we asked that it would be best if he just simply gave us 5 minutes and come back later. The worst was when we found a fish scale in one of the dishes. That is absolutely unacceptable for any restaurant, much less a three star Michelin establishment!! Actually, I stand corrected...the absolute worst was how one of the waiters responded when we told him. He looked confused, didn't know how to handle the situation, simply said ""I'm sorry"" and walked off. It was never addressed by anyone after that.  I've had much better service at an Olive Garden by high school aged servers.  Unacceptable!",-0.97,0.804,0.064,0.132,0.5141428571428571

2014-12-04,3.0,"Well here it is. Review #200 for me. All I can say is wow. And that's not a good wow. That's a wow of disappointment. This is the 5th high profile restaurant I've gone to, and the 2nd one that profiles molecular gastronomy. The first one being Minibar, in DC.  At the end of the day day I'd go back to Minibar 10 times before I come back here, and that's saying something considering you're treated different if you come back, which leads me to my first point. Any friends of employees, or people who have been before get additional courses.  Not one course, but multiple. So you're essentially paying the same amount for less food.  Recently one of the ""extra dish"" that some received but others did not was the black truffle explosion, which seems to be one of the dishes they're most known for. When I went it was some white truffle dish in a glass dome (I'm assuming it's smoked).   The other part that didn't woo me was unfortunately the most important, the food.  There were some great components, but overall most of the dishes that I had left me with the impression that they were ""good"".  Nothing outstanding, or that I would rave about.  The dish with the pork belly from the fire was probably the closest to that.  Overall extremely disappointed. On one course I left a fork on the napkin they use to place new silver wear, and one of the runners told me to make sure I put it on the dish that's served, not asked, told. At the end of the day I wish they wouldn't have charged you tip in advance, because my experience did not come nearly close to deserving a 20% tip.  The menu is definitely seafood driven, which I'm also not a huge fan of. I enjoy sea food, but not for every course. There was one squad and one pork belly dish, outside of that it was all seafood.  At the end of the day, this was the most expensive meal I've had to date (wine pairing + food and tip comes out to about $1,100. I paid around $800 at minibar, and left fuller, and much more satisfied. It looks like i won't be back for the special treatment/extra dishes.",0.9852,0.816,0.129,0.055,0.4339305916305916

2014-12-02,5.0,"Alinea is a culinary experience like nothing you've ever seen before. Grant Achatz has the most incredible talent of any chef around. He pushes culinary boundaries by thinking so outside the box you almost forget you're inside a restaurant.  The level of creativity is so outside any other 5 star restaurant.  I guess they call this molecular gastronomy. It's part chemistry and science, part art and part what I like to call master chefistry. I've never seen a chef take so much personal time and involvement in their meals as he does.  Going to Alinea is a special occasion for most. For me, it was my 30th birthday. Achatz took us on a treasure hunt of unbelievable foods and presentations.  Our food adventure started with a twig bird basket where we found salsified jerky. We went through a swamp with a pearl encased lily pond of sashimi with bubbling dry ice. We were taken by table side campfire to find Kobe beef hidden in the campfire rocks.  Got a ""To Go"" box of Sweetbreads with chopsticks. Grabbed a newspaper and devoured the crab legs with tarter sauce packets. The food portions were perfect for the 12 or so courses and tricked up in flavor.  Sugar helium edible green apple taffy balloons were brought to the table. We stared in curiosity as to how to proceed with a balloon as edible? The first brave one at the table took it and sucked. The balloon came undone and turned into a sticky taffy string. Releasing the helium was almost more fun than eating it. We all laughed at our ""Alinea is amazing"" sounding like dwarfs from the helium and laughing at such a childish thing in a 5 star restaurant.  The grand finale desert was presented and prepared in front of us by chef Achatz. Nutmeg chocolate coursing cake, and smears of goodness all around, dusted with confetti like sugar sparkles. Presented like art on a silicone sheet that when they finished presenting the desert it looked like a abstract artwork.  Criticisms of this place may be the ticket system and the uncertainty of when your reservation request will be accommodated and the deposit associated. But, if you're going to Alinea, you're going with the expectation of sheer brilliance and that's exactly what it is. And well worth the conjecture.

2014-11-24,2.0,"I've been deciding... how exactly to write this review in a thoughtful manner given the prominence of Alinea in the molecular gastronomy arena and the clear accolades it has been given by fellow yelpers and beyond.  This was expected to be the pinnacle of my Chicago foodie trip.  It lacked and though I am lucky to have the means to fine-dine like this without regret, I feel bad for those that save their pennies for a once-in-a-lifetime and should be treated like rock stars in every area of their experience. Molecular Gastronomy is apparently not for me... at least when the ""show"" takes forefront over true tastiness of the food.  Its likely my palette, as my dining partner enjoyed every moment of the spectacle and has said she would return again and again.  And as a self-professed slow eater, I've decided from now on when asked about dining restrictions, ""time-sensitive"" should be the first thing I mention. I can't remember every dish.. .some were tasty and innovative.. others merely ~meh~.  But what really demoted my experience was not the food, but the waitstaff.  Given what you pay for a meal at Alinea (and we each also did the premium wine pairing to boot!), I expect top notch service with nary a wrinkle witnessed by me as a diner.  Sadly, this was not the case.  Service was awkward most of the night, but the biggest confusion was at the beginning.  As seated, we were informed that my friend's boyfriend (back in NYC) had arranged to buy us a drink to start.  It was mentioned with flourish and fanfare and we were pretty excited.  Once we both decided that we were doing the wine pairing, and our sommelier was pouring our first pairing, I asked how this worked with the complementary drink being offered.  We had no idea if friend's BF had a signature cocktail in mind, just buying our first drink, or ... ?  Long awkward pause, clearing of the throat, and then an ""ah, yes... because of your drink to start... we'll do a double pouring of the first pairing.""  It was extremely and painfully clear that the somm had no f'ing clue what we were talking about.  We were left with awkward texts to my friend's (not-so-longtime) BF to ensure that he wasn't being overcharged for something he didn't ask for.  Luckily he is a gentleman and generous, but really, Alinea? That much of a communication breakdown in a place that touts itself as one of the world's tops? Sorry to be the one to say, but methinks the emperor has no clothes.

2014-11-22,3.0,"Alinea is Chicago's most expensive meal, has 3* Michelin, is ranked in the world's top 10 on several respected lists.. we all know of its accolades. That means nothing--NOTHING--should feel wrong during your experience.. 1) I paid $650 on 9/15 for two 11/16 dinner tickets. On 11/9, I initiated first contact by phone to ensure the res and to discuss allergies. No answer. Phone tag ensued, and after they failed to pick up, ever, I emailed our info and allergies and then gave up. So they held my $650 for almost two months without human confirmation and then went 0/5 on phone calls. First impressions, Alinea.. 2) Recent yelpers talk of the black truffle explosion. Ours and four other tables were not served it. The elderly couple next to us received the dish. I love that they reward longstanding relationships, but Alinea has 3* and this is a special night for most of us.. If my n00b efforts don't get me as ""in"" as the next table, at least hide it from me. That's two large strikes for a place among Earth's absolute best. The experience in-person was --better--. The posh interior has a clean, modern feel that contrasts light and dark. Huge tables feel like 1st class but destroy intimacy, and the communal booths are too casual.. we shared our experience (and conversations) with 70yr-olds that spoke three words the whole time--exclusively Spanish--and a group of four late-20s who admitted they'd ""never had an oyster before."" Service was casually excellent, joking and bantering in stride. Several servers spoke Spanish to the black truffle table, an awesome detail. Alinea staff even remembered their promise to answer ""what's your favorite dish?"" when the last course had finally graced our lips 1.5hr later. Then they booked us a 3-top at The Aviary. At the same time, their suave allowed for odd moments. When revealing one of the smoldering meal secrets, the server kept telling us HIS story. He continued talking as he carved, then plopped the food onto our plates, announced it quickly, and walked away. He reduced to commonplace what Achatz&co had intended as great surprise and the food's moment became his moment. Other yelpers have complained of similarities with ""going through the motions"". Food is ultra playful, more than anywhere I've been. It's time-sensitive. It's 3-D. It's unexpected.. even part of the room decorations. It's all the special things you want in haute cuisine.

Moments of excellence included the caviar and brioche foam, the latter affording us the oft-missed appreciation caviar's ""pop"". The helium balloon and hot-cold potato are staples, both excellent. The transition dish had not showed up on any blogs I read prior and was my favorite of the night: truffle-concrete ""graffiti"", rich yet playful in use of spray-on aromatic balsamic, like its name, and at once frustratingly irremovable yet enriching. Lowlights were the insultingly literal jerky-twig scrounge, the stinging mustard in the eggplant broth, the oversauced and texture-hiding fish dishes, the raw matsutake, and the too-filling table desert that was rushed robotically by a chef not named Grant Achatz.

One recommendation I would have for this restaurant is to somehow keep the mystery of the courses throughout the night.  We were sandwiched between two tables which were ahead of us in their tasting menu, so we already knew what to expect.  When the waiters came, for example, and fished out meat from our charcoal pit, I think they were expecting us to be amazed, but I was like, ""yeah we already knew that was in there"".  Similar experiences for a few of the courses too.

2014-11-03,5.0,"I'm not going to explain any of the dishes or spoil anything. This restaurant has 3 michelin stars and there is a reason for this. I dined this past Saturday and experienced by far the most exquisite meal of my life. Rather than go into detail about my experience I would rather offer like minded people a more positive perspective by shooting down some of the absurd reviews.  I hate to lead into this by saying ""they didn't get it"", but yeah, they didn't get it.   Here are a couple of the complaints I've seen on yelp, let me respond to them: 1. ""The staff was uptight and/or cold and/or pretentious"" I didn't experience this at all. They were joking, laughing and being entirely relaxed along with my wife and I. I have a small feeling than in cases where the staff was cold they were just matching the personalities of the diners.  Creative does not mean pretentious. 2. ""The meal wasn't nourishing"" What does that even mean? I had 16 courses, many of them substantial. I have never been more full in my life. If you were looking for spaghetti and meatballs or a steak why the hell did you go to Alinea?  3. ""It's gimmicky""  Yes and no. While there are a couple things that are of a more ""gimmicky"" nature this overlooks some of the subtleties and the artistry that went behind the dishes.  Okay I'll spoil one for you.  The first dish of the night was ""Osetra Caviar"". Very simple concept... the dish was the Chef's play on a standard Russian caviar service that normally includes caviar, bread, egg, red onion and dill.  Traditionally, the caviar is served as more of a spread. While flavorful, the only textures experienced are from the toasted bread and crunchy red onions. Shouldn't the caviar be the star of the show? Instead it's texture is lost.  This preperation tries to do the caviar justice, it is the focus of the dish after all! To make the caviar the focus texturally, the chef removes the textures of all the other items. Instead of brioche toast we have brioche foam, the egg is now pudding and the red onion and dill are in the form of a clear gel. The result is a delicious dish that makes the caviar the focus instead of the spread. Gimmick? I think not!  4. ""The food isn't local"" No shit. Did you notice the price of your ticket? That doesn't just cover trips to Jewel Osco. Alinea gives you the best food you cannot and will not get anywhere else.  5. ""It's not worth the money"" This is true if and only if you are not able to look beyond the size of a portion to determine ""worth"". I ate a bite of food that was just that, maybe three forks worth. It had at least twenty different ingredients with at least a dozen different cooking methods. Just get the Alinea cookbook (also may not appear to be ""worth"" the money but I disagree). If you can read up you will learn how amazingly difficult it is to cook any dish or even any one component of a dish.  You are paying for the following:  - A very large, extremely attentive and well rehearsed staff that can talk at length about virtually any dish.  - At least 200-300 different ingredients, many of which are rare and from far reaches of the planet.  - An unparalleled cooking staff that is able to execute dishes impeccably each time. Don't forget that the food here is far more difficult to prepare than your standard sea-food/steak affair (looking at you Joes and others).  - The coolest and most inventive serving pieces.  - Food prepared with methods pioneered in part by Grant Achatz that you cannot and will not be able to experience anywhere else.  How much should that cost? I think roughly $500 per person is entirely ""worth it"" and if anything is a steal. It's not a joke that my 16 course meal would have cost $15-$20K or more to prepare at home plus the years of culinary school it would take to wrap my head around any of the dishes. Lets not even talk about all of the technology I'd have to purchase as well!  Okay I'm done. I just wanted to point some of these out because these are the complaints I saw that made me nervous before going to Alinea.

While I like to splurge every so often on fine dining, it still hurts me a little to have to drop so much money on food. With Alinea though, there was none of that. The dinner was half culinary delight, and half theater; and it was the first time I ever felt like I ever got my full money's worth at a 2- or 3-Michelin starred restaurant.  The service was impeccable. The staff immediately adjust to your personality. With our table, the staff joked right alongside with us, and were completely chill. They didn't seem to take themselves too seriously, and yet they still provided top-notch service.  To top things off, we even had Chef Grant Achatz himself come out and prepare our final tabletop dessert course!! The food though, wow. The food was beyond delicious. It was creative, inventive, mind-bending, and oh yeah, it tasted great too.  We went with the full chef tasting and wine pairing, and our menu included: 1) They started off by serving us some complimentary champagne. Already off to a great start 2) Caviar with brioche foam, egg custard, and citrus gelee. The foam tasted just like bread. Crazy 3) Dehydrated salsifie, a stem from a member of the sunflower family. Marinated in soy sauce. The stem was was hidden in a giant branch sculpture, and we had to forage for it the food. Really fun and creative 4) Dry Riesling 5) Skate wing in a funky handheld plate 6) Pinot auxerrois 7) Grilled corn with truffle, iberico ham, and mancheho cheese. The corn was still smoking when it arrived on table. The smoky aroma complemented the food beautifully 8) Unfiltered chardonnay from the south of Alsace 9) Curried lobster with essence of cauliflower, chickpeas, cucumber gelee, and lobster reduction 10) Tempura fried veal sweatbreads with Thai seasoning, radish. Paired with lit charcoal for aroma 11) Semi dry Vouvrey chenin blanc 12) Junmai Ginjo sake from the 2nd oldest sake distillery in Japan 13) So secretly, during our last course, they had been cooking waygu beef and parsnip in the charcoal that had been burning in the middle of our table. This then turned into our next course! The chef came out, pulled the food out of the charcoal, and prepared it tableside for us. We had: A5 grade waygu beef grilled and wrapped in seaweed. The aroma of the seaweed paired with the beef was amazing. This was served with a reduction of Black trumpet mushroom, and chargrillled parsnip. Here's some video of that:  youtube.com/watch?v=8wWY… 14) Palate cleanser of finger lime, flower petals and rambutan 15) Soft shell crabs with potato chips and mini packets of hot sauce, honey mustard, and remoulade 16) The soft shell crab was served with Pabst Blue Ribbon beer. The most expensive PBR you'll ever have :) 17) Molasses and vanilla celery mousse. Raw rhubarb shaved on top 18) La Bastide Blanche rose wine 19) Jamsheed syrah 20) Braised wood ear mushroom with pig ear and cubes of smoked pear 21) Hot potato cold potato. This is a signature Alinea dish. It's served in a handcrafted wax dish. You pull a pin to release a hot potato into a cold potato soup, and then you shoot the final product. Delicious! 22) Truffle and foie gras dumpling congee with shiso leaf dumpling 23) Black truffle ravioli explosion 24) Strawberry disguised as a watermelon. To make this, the kitchen compressed the juice of hundreds of strawberry into a watermelon-looking cube. They then paired this with powdered strawberry, along with yuzu and avocado frozen powder 25) Yummy dessert wine 26) Frozen bubble gum noodles on a bed of blueberries of different textures 27) Green apple taffy balloon inflated with helium. We inhaled the helium and all pretended we were Alvin and the Chipmunks, before finishing off the taffy. Here's video of that:  youtube.com/watch?v=5dGl… 28) Finally, came the grand finale. Alinea's famous tabletop dessert that's prepared directly on the table, and made with freeze dried hazelnut, violet sauce, and meringue.

2014-10-03,5.0,"There are only two things which are the focus here.  The service and the food.  Starting with the service, what I notice is that you do not have one specific waiter, but anyone in the staff may come over to assist.  In terms of attitude, they seem to adapt to each customer.  There are tables which I noticed didn't care to joke around and just enjoyed their meal and the staff was on their level.  Our table was a little more outgoing and they were more outgoing as well. The dinner itself was very different but very much the same as any other dinner you have had, especially if you live in the Midwest.  What I mean by that is you have what appears to be corn on the cob brought out in front of you.  Husk is still on and everything.  But the first thing you will notice is the slightly toasted scent of the husk in the air.  It's something that I've only really smelled before at a local fest where a vendor is grilling corn...but now it's right in front of me.  Then when the husk is removed it exposes what appears to be just corn.  But when your spoon dives in you discover that there's much more to this dish (won't spoil it).  So the entire experience of just that one dish took me from being out at some carnival on a fall day to something much more sophisticated and elevated.  And that continued for each course. It wasn't fine dining just for the sake of fine dining...it felt as though each dish had some purpose and a story to it rather than just being good food on a plate.  Perhaps this is over complicating it and not their intentions at all, but that was my take.",0.9329,0.893,0.071,0.036,0.5041931216931217

Each course was exclusive in its own way and certainly difficult to describe. Sadly, I couldn't explain all 15 courses if I was asked. The meals I ended up enjoying were: Hot Potato, Black Truffle, Balloon, and White Chocolate.  The one dish I felt was distasteful was the Lobster. ""Hot Potato, Cold Potato"" was the first hands-on course. In order for the course to be warm, our assistance was needed. Once we pulled a metal prong, releasing the potato to ooze its way down, we were able to scarf it down leaving a warm sensation. Next on my list, was the ""Black Truffle Explosion"". The name says it all. This was a brackish and briny meal that gave my tongue a tingling feeling. Then; it was the ""Balloon"".  The balloon was filled with helium and green apple taffy that was literally floating above our table and ultimately was indeed edible. The ""Lobster"" seemed appetizing, but from my biased opinion, it was bland. The mixture of onion and curry was displeasing to my taste buds. Nevertheless, the majority of the courses were scrumptious and chef Achatz's style is unique. The last course we had was seemingly dessert, which was referred to as ""White Chocolate"". The presentation for this dish was remarkable. The crushing of the chocolate sphere to wrap it up and the sprinkling of flavors was an artistic creation that tasted superb. Regrettably, we were not able to make our way to the kitchen to personally meet and greet chef Grant Achatz. Typically, this is an option offered at Alinea that is usually an honorable experience. Favorably, the presence of our waiter was terrific enough to make this issue go unnoticed.

They made dinner fun to eat, not like a serious meal w/ the prim & proper (thank thy lord, lol). - The uni cake w/ nori butter was amazing. It was definitely one of my favs of the night. Soft savory cake w/ a scent of uni perfectly matched w/ the saltiness of the nori butter. - The dumpling literally exploded in my mouth. Fair warning from the waiter to enclose our lips around it before we actually bit into it, haha. But it definitely busted w/ flavor.  And the pasta shell was like a pillow - soft yet firm. - The pickled root that hid in a wreath of twigs? At first, a confusing presentation given to us but so fun!  - The waiters set burning charcoal in front of us only to surprisingly find our food cooking in it. The meaty pork belly that cooked in a seaweed leaf was so juicy & flavorful and had a subtle smoky flavor. The root that accompanied it was smoked & charred to nicely compliment the dish.  - Bubble gum noodle tasted exactly like Bazooka bubble gum from back in the day. The lovely taste entrapped in a frozen noodle of sorbet - yum! - The green apple taffy balloon was a fun fav of mine. Kissed it, inhaled the helium & got all sticky to engulf the yumminess. Wasn't too heavy of a dessert. I definitely felt like a kid at a candy store. - The last dessert was a deconstructed frozen mesh of heaven.

I felt like we couldn't have a conversation because people were constantly coming to our table to talk. I guess that is part of the experience. About three quarters through my second glass of wine ($30), I noticed a fly in my wine. The server removed my glass and brought me back a glass that was only a quarter full. He also didn't take the wine off the bill until I had to ask.  The textures in all of the courses were terrible. Since when does foam and jelly taste good? I also agree with some other reviews that the dishes tasted like either pure salt or sugar. Our pork belly/parsnip dish was cold because our flame had gone out right away. The food also made me sick. I went home and ate saltine crackers. I woke up in the middle of the night and almost threw up. I would prefer to eat at one of Chicago's amazing steakhouses any night over Alinea.  Yes, the experience is pretty cool. I am sorry but if I am dropping $500/person for dinner there should not be a fly in my glass of wine and the food should taste phenomenal.

2014-09-10,5.0,"Overdue review: I love Alinea. Yes it was expensive... very expensive, but I'm glad I got the chance to try it. I loved the dining experience, and of course the food. I believe some of the items on the menu rotate. So here is what I had in May of 2014: SPOILER ALERT: if you don't want to know what I had in case you want to be surprised, then stop reading. Because even if the menu rotates, some of the items might remain the same.  Hot Potato: cold potato, black truffle, butter. Very interesting concept and design. You have this wax-like spoon that holds the butter. And then you have the potato with the truffle hanging over it with some sort of contraption that requires a pin. To eat, you pull the pin off the waxed spoon, and the potato will collapse into the puddle of butter. Then you shove the whole thing in your mouth. I liked it a lot because I felt two temperatures (cold potato and warm truffle) at once as I engulfed this appetizer.  Salsify: branch camouflage. For this dish, our waiter pretty much made us ""forage"" for our food. I was some kind of jerky that was camouflaged inside a wreathe-like basket. One of my friends actually bit into a twig or rope, thinking it was the jerky. This was a fun, interactive course. Lobster: curry, earl grey, grapefruit. This meal just looks pretty and tastes good too. This dish was totally deconstructed to those ingredients I basically listed. The lobster was really fresh. Sweetbreads: orange, ginko nut, cinnamon chop sticks. This was presented in a Chinese take-out box. If the waiter didn't tell us beforehand, I would totally believe the sweetbread was orange chicken. Good job fooling me! Ebi: broccoli stem, yuzu, sea grape. This one cleansed my palate. Wagyu: parsnip, black trumpet, kombu. At first it looked like just a pile of coals. The waiter lit it on fire. After a couple of minutes, the fire was extinguished and the waiter removed one ""coal"". As you guessed, it was another camouflage. The wagyu was wrapped in kombu, so it looked like one of those coal bricks. We each had a piece of the wagyu, and it was tender and delicious. This is one of my favorite dishes in Alinea. Lily Bulb: rambutan, distillation of caviar lime. Another dish that cleansed my palate. Cold and fresh, I don't know how else to describe it. Rhubarb: celery root, celery branch, licorice. This was probably my least favorite in Alinea. Maybe because I don't like licorice.  Wood Ear: pig ear, allium, black garlic. Very savory, and I love garlic. Thumbs up! Black Truffle: explosion, asparagus, parmesan. This is just a spoonful. But as you put the whole thing in your mouth and bite, there is literally an explosion of flavors in your mouth. Please keep your mouth closed when you bite into this. This is another one of my favorites. Tied with the wagyu. Duck: foie gras, morel, dragon's breath. It comes in a vase with a mist steaming out of it. Probably dried ice, but they call it dragon breath. Pretty cool though. And I love bougie foie gras. Pistachio: mascarpone, black walnut, rose. This one is ok with me. I don't hate it, but I'm not in love with it. I'm not that big on pistachio.  Balloon: helium, green apple. The balloon is made of green apple taffy and it actually floats because of the helium. There are 2 ways of eating it, the fun way and the boring way. Boring way: pop the balloon, and chew on the taffy. Fun way: puncture a small hole and breathe in all the helium, then chew on the taffy at the end. We all did the fun way and sounded like chipmunks. By far the most entertaining course of our dinner hahahahaha! Milk Chocolate: pate sucree, violet, hazelnut. The grand finale. The chefs come out for this one and builds this masterpiece for you to eat. They cleared the table and placed a brand new mat on top of it. Then they started to work; it was like they were painting with food. The hazelnut was very rich.  Each dish was a small portion, but believe me, you will be full at the end of the meal.

2014-09-08,1.0,"Can I give zero stars? I can't believe the poor customer service my husband and I received at Alinea. As you all are probably aware, to go to Alinea, you need to participate in their ticketing system, whereby you must purchase tickets months in advance. In June, we bought tickets to celebrate our anniversary over Labor Day weekend. We had no way of knowing that when we bought these tickets, it would be for the same weekend we would have to put our dog to sleep. I contacted Ashlan at Alinea on Wednesday (our tickets were for Sunday).  We knew the end would be coming, and we would be in no shape to celebrate, let alone be up for something like Alinea. Ashlan told me that my only option was to go to Alinea's facebook page and try to sell the tickets myself or lose the tickets.  If I found someone to buy the tickets, Alinea would not transfer the fees due, so in essence, we would also have to meet the people buying the tickets beforehand to get the money and then make the transfer. OUR DOG WAS DYING.   We you are taking care of someone, human or animal, who is dying, you are an emotional mess and the care consumes every moment you have. You are constantly caring for them. I received her email on Thursday. We put our dog to sleep on Friday.  So somewhere between caring for our dying dog on Friday, then during our raw grief on Saturday, we were supposed to become ticket brokers, putting our tickets up for sale, monitoring Facebook for responses, emailing interested parties, and then hop in our car to go meet the buyers, make the transfer, etc.  All while we just lost our beloved dog.  I wonder if anyone at Alinea has ever lost anyone important to them.  Do they know what pain and grief feel like?  Or did they want another babygate incident where we show up regardless of our situation, and bawl through the meal, ruining it for everyone around us, just because we paid for the tickets and they gave us no other options? In the end, we just gave our tickets away to friends.  We were focused elsewhere, as you can imagine.  To make matters worse, Ashlan's last email to me, stated that I should let her know if we had any problems re-booking in the future.  This woman honestly thinks we would re-book after this?  Seriously?  Get over yourself.  The most appalling part?  She closes her email with, ""Have a lovely weekend.""  Does this woman understand that our dog just died?  Is she a human or a robot?  Does she have any customer service training? We could have easily been booked for another night.  Alinea consistently puts tables up for sale on their Facebook page, with less notice than we had given, and they sell.  We know that if we didn't go they would do just that- put up our table for sale again and made an additional $600+ on it. What really got me was that while looking for an email address for Alinea to complain to them about their lousy customer service, I found an interview with Grant Achatz after the whole crying baby incident. He talks about how they accommodate people who call ahead with issues ALL THE TIME. He goes on to explain that when the polar vortex happened, people got stranded and couldn't make their reservations and they REFUNDED their tickets.  Are you kidding me? I emailed Conrad Reddick, the GM and explained to him what happened. And you know what the response was?  NOTHING.  He never even responded. I never expected this to happen to us at a three Michelin starred restaurant. I think they just really don't care because they don't have to. People are clamoring to get in to Alinea.  Once you buy those tickets, they don't care about you.   But, you know who will respond about Alinea's lousy customer service? Michelin.  They encourage feedback from diners who have experience with the restaurants they rate.  I emailed them about this experience and they responded to me. I encourage everyone who has had bad experiences to email them, too. They consider feedback when re-rating restaurants. It is funny because after this incident, I started looking on here at their bad reviews and most of them are related to customer service. Please read the negative reviews before you buy tickets.  There are so many fine dining establishments with amazing food in the city that do not behave this way. Don't book here. Things can happen in your life, no matter how you plan ahead and they don't care. They will just take your money. We are shocked to be treated so poorly during such an emotionally raw time while Alinea has publicly claimed to make accommodations for others in far less tragic circumstances. And regardless, I don't care if you will be eating soup made from unicorn tears.  When you're paying $600+ for a meal, you should never be treated this way. We visit all the Michelin rated restaurants and thought this one would top them all.  I think Wendy's would have shown us more kindness. Their food might be amazing, we will never know.  We know the same cannot be said for their customer service.",0.9748,0.817,0.105,0.078,0.4904633378317589

Pro tip: If it is indeed a special event, perhaps let the restaurant know in advance. After seeing this dish, other diners proceeded to say it was their special day - not sure if the kitchen could accommodate something they clearly prepare in advance. But moving on to the dish itself, the birthday ball was tempered with dark chocolate and a piece of dehydrated birthday cake, vanilla ice cream, and chocolate cream. Our server poured a vanilla creme anglaise tableside to ""unwrap"" the present. Very cool.  18: Milk Chocolate Pate sucree, violet, hazelnut And for our final course - modernist art on the dining table. The paint? 40% Tainori milk chocolate, frozen violet sugar, violet sauce, creme fraiche, candied basil, crispy brown butter, frozen milk meringue, and pate sucree. Armagnac butterscotch and hazelnut and feuilletine rocks provided some texture and richness as well. With liquid nitrogen, the milk chocolate was used to great effect to create a gelatinous ""tart"" that was creamy and light - topped with the candied basil, milk meringue, and crisp brown butter.  And with that, our three-hour three star experience in Chicago came to an end. Presented with the additional check for wine for the night, we reflected on one of the best meals of our lives. Exemplary service was personable and not stiff. The dishes were a display of both show and technique, but most importantly, exceptional taste. While the creativity was clear, there was a reason behind every ingredient and element to each dish.

If you have even a small interest in high end cuisine, chances are you have already heard plenty about Grant Achatz and his 3 Michelin stars, AAA Five Diamond Award and the #9 ranking on the World's 50 Best Restaurants List, second only to Eleven Madison Park in the U.S... Truth be told, the hype is real. Alinea offers a rotating tasting menu of between 18 and 22 courses suited to the season that is only available through a ticketing system via their website. You are going to want to start planning your visit at least 3 months out to ensure things go smoothly and you can expect to fork over $500.00 for a table for two without wine. This is all housed in a very nondescript murdered out building on North Halsted in Chitown with no signage, just a valet stand. The open kitchen is the first thing your eyes will focus on upon entering the restaurant, by design. The visual experience is really beyond compare, be prepared for juxtaposition. Custom tableware, exotic dishes and inventive flavors are shown in every dish. Most notable is the Black Truffle Explosion ( they make their own black truffle stock!), the supremely rich Waygu, Hot Potato/Cold Potato (Possibly the best single bite of food I have ever tasted), the world renowned Edible Helium Balloon (where you you even begin to imagine this dish?!?) and the most creative and best tasting dessert on Earth which was created table side by Chef Achatz himself on our visit.  The only criticism I have regarding Alinea is that the servers at times allow their ego to get away from themselves and it is highly advisable to get their personal pride out of the way and not become an obstacle for the extremely adapt kitchen. That said, we did not allow that to hamper our evening,  Alinea provided the single most creative experience in dining I will most likely ever have and also the second best tasting meal I have consumed while exploring this mortal coil.

2014-07-24,5.0,"Last Saturday I was minding my own business and I happened to see a friend's post on social media...""Do 2 people want to go to Alinea tomorrow at 7:30?""  I immediately sent him a message saying I was interested and asked my husband if we should commit.  After all, it's kind of a big deal.  I am not going to pretend going to Alinea is something we are willing to do on a whim.  It's basically round trip airfare.  The thing is, experiencing Grant Achatz creativity up close and personal is something both of us have felt would be worth the investment for quite a while.  I let my friend know we were in and the two of us promptly spent the time leading up to our 7:30 pm reservation the next day in great anticipation of what was to come.  We had been to fine dining establishments, but being able to go to Alinea was the equivalent of having tickets to the Super Bowl.  We combed over the Alinea website, perused Yelp and watched Spinning Plates in advance of our dinner.  We took our time dressing up for the occasion and made sure to meet up with our friends in plenty of time for our reservation.  The outside of the building was very unassuming, it blends right into the busy bustling of Halsted Avenue on a gorgeous Sunday night.  I couldn't help but think of all the times I had walked or driven past it without a second thought.  As we entered the subtly lit architectural hallway leading us to the dining area, I realized this experience was going to be amazing before having even a single taste of what was to come.  The hostess was warm and friendly and graciously asked us about transportation arrangements before we were whisked off to our table.  We were led upstairs to a room in the back of the building containing two small tables and one larger table.  I made sure to sit with my back to the other tables so everything placed in front of me would be a surprise (I don't read the back of books either).  I could smell cinnamon smoldering as we entered, which made me all the more excited.  Our waiter was very reserved and courteous as is expected in such a formal setting.  We took a minute to look over the extensive wine list and I had a quick conversation with the Sommelier about which bottles of red might pair well as we moved through the courses.  We decided to each have a glass of light white wine to start and I chose a Russian Valley Pinot Nior for our later courses.  At this point I'll end up with a book if I delve into each course, and honestly each menu is meant to be experienced by the individual not via my long winded descriptions.  What I will say, is we had one of the most fun and most memorable dining experiences of our lives.  We searched for goodies hidden among the kiwi branches, delved for sweetbreads with our smoldering chopsticks, curiously eyed our table fire and then realized in awe it contained more than just tinder, enjoyed the floral essence of a lilac garden containing wonderful bursts of blueberry and relived our childhood with a special green apple balloon.  The entire evening was full of excitement and surprises and most of all a very personal transfer of artistic interpretation from the Alinea creative team.  By the end of the evening we had made clear to our waiter we were truly in it for the experience and he opened up and joined in on our excitement.  It was fun to see him and some of the other staff loosen up a little bit once they realized we didn't expect them to blend into the background.  They offered us some insight to what it is like to work in such an amazing and impeccable establishment.  They talked about how the creativity and drive of the Alinea team draws everyone in and how the commitment to such high standards becomes second nature.  We had some laughs and even got a little dance out of them.  This made the whole experience even more enjoyable, if that's possible.  I'm not sure when, if ever, I'll return to Alinea.  I will tell you this, the experience is one we will never forget and it has made me much more appreciative of the fine art of culinary creativity as a form of expression.",0.9993,0.804,0.189,0.007,0.4846455026455025

2014-07-21,5.0,"Alinea is generally regarded, by the people who keep track of such things, as perhaps the best restaurant in North America, and one of the best restaurants in the world.  Anyone who has considered making a reservation (which must be done weeks or months in advance, and paid for upfront) here already knows that, so what's the utility of another review, when every kind of accolade and superlative praise that can be given to the place has already been given?  Probably not much. But while a review might be pointless, Alinea is unique enough that a preview would probably be useful, for people googling around wondering what to expect before they go (which is what I found myself doing, before I went). To that end: * Guys, wear a jacket, no exceptions, and preferably a suit. Some of the dishes are interactive (as in, designed to end up all over your face), so consider omitting the tie, or using a tie clip, or just be careful. If you want to wear appropriately cool jeans of some sort, make sure you're the kind of person that can pull off jeans with a sport coat  -i.e., if you can look like Chris Hardwick from Talking Dead, go for it, otherwise ... just wear a suit. (I'm not really qualified to say what women should wear, but obviously women have a lot more latitude in dress).          * The place is fancy, but not stuffy, and the staff reflects that. Our server deadpan introduced the first dish as ""chilled monkey brains"" (from mondo classic Faces of Death), figuring we'd get the joke (it was actually a scallop dish, served over dry ice:  website.alinearestaurant… ). Another staff member, when guiding me to the restroom, self-parodied the place by describing the ""individually-folded toilet tissues"" that awaited.  You (well not me, but my dining companion was more assertive than I) can even ask for a seconds of a certain dish (You'll know which one after you've had it, and I don't want to ruin that surprise). * You can take a virtual tour of the inside of the restaurant via google maps:  maps.google.com/maps?bav… * Wine is not included in your ticket, you pay for that separately, after your meal. I'd recommend getting the wine pairing ($165/person for the standard pairing the night we went, there's also a reserve pairing available), because I can't think of a bottle (or two) of anything which would as perfectly compliment the individual courses as the glasses preselected by the restaurant for that purpose, but if you consider yourself an expert oenophile, there's an extensive collection to choose from. Note that if you don't drink (like my dining companion, an NYC yelper passing through town who was looking for someone to share the experience with), that won't take away from the Alinea trip at all. Like all universally well-regarded institutions, there exist lesser-known upstarts which take the concept and improve upon it (Chicago has several, and I'd say that the now-closed, downstate June, started by Josh Adams (who very briefly staged at Alinea), actually surpassed Alinea, in creativity and presentation).  But regardless of recent competition, it's undebateable that Alinea pretty much exemplifies the molecular gastronomy movement, and provides the template that all aspirants in this area always will crib from.  And like all revered Chicago dining institutions (from Charlie Trotter to Hot Doug's), Alinea won't be around forever.  So if you're interested in experiencing the restaurant that pretty much invented the trend, probably best to get in on it sooner than later.",0.997,0.862,0.127,0.011,0.4405996472663139

The restaurant was busier and noiser then we've ever seen it, so was missing that serene ambience we had grown to love. A victim of it's own success? The menu wasn't our favourite as it focused on humdrum ingredients (parsnip, rhubarb?) and two of the courses that attempted to be humorous, were not elevated beyond the cheap takeaway meals they sought to imitate (sweetbreads served in a chinese takeaway box and fried smelt served on newspaper with sachets of sauce). Service was also not up to standards. We watched a waiter drop a hot potato cold potato on the table of the guest next to us, splashing them with soup, as well as pop one of the desserts. We were not welcomed back, when on previous times we were and after seeing Chef Achatz prepare one of the desserts for a table next to us, we thought he might repay our loyalty by preparing ours for once, but we were let down again. The usually comedic style of the service staff was not there and our somellier's deadpan demeanour came across as disinterested rather than wry. Still four stars though as our first dinner at Alinea was a magical five star experience with perfect service, artistic, whimsical and deliciious preparations.

It's a big let down that they won't let you cancel or change your reservation if you get sick or someone can't make it (you still have to pay as all tables are pre-paid). That's a huge turn-off to me and partially why I have deducted a star. However, if you desire that incredible experience of edible art and are looking to WOW or be WOWED by a culinary experience, you'll find the creation and presentation of the meal awe-inspiring. Grant Achatz is a genius (just saw a documentary about him) yet the food is more about the presentation and art of it, rather than the eating of it.

It was well worth the price tag- a little less than $600 for two with no drinks and 20% service fee included.  I was fortunate enough to come across an open seating for 2 when I was randomly browsing a couple months ago. The way you get reservations is different in the sense that you have to pre-purchase tickets online. Totally cuts down on no-shows.  If I hadn't googled the place, I probably wouldn't have found Alinea. You enter a purple/pink-lit hallway and then a door slides open to welcome you to the restaurant. We were seated upstairs and noticed a leaf seemingly floating above us. We had no idea that said leaf would be incorporated into a course. You don't get the menu until after you finish your meal. While I had looked into the dishes, some took me by surprise.  I had many favorites from black truffle explosion to the green apple taffy edible balloon to eating veal sweetbreads in a legit Chinese takeout box.

The room we were in was very simple and elegant but very noisy.  There was one very loud party of six which detracted from the otherwise serene ambiance.   Everything about the restaurant is imaginative and thoughtful with incredible attention to detail.   15 courses is a lot, not so much in quantity, but in the ability to be memorable.  I can recall 4 or 5 but would have to refer back to the printed menu keepsake (nice touch) to jog my memory.     There were only a couple of things I didn't find completely delicious.  1.  The raviolo was too salty. 2.  Impressive that you can make a noodle out of bubble gum but I don't need to eat it.

I don't want to spoil it for anyone but there are many surprises here although I suspect that if you are going to Alinea, you probably have done some research and already know what I am referring to. I will not go into detail as to the ""surprising presentation"" that this restaurant is known for.  All I will say is that it is perfectly executed and the ""tricks"" do not take away from the food or experience.   Before I get into the food, let me comment ever so briefly about the reservation process.  I absolutely LOVE the reservation process.  You purchase tickets online (at Alinea.Com).  You pick your timeslot and pre-pay for same.  So, by the time you get there, you are pretty much pre-paid, except of course for gratuity and, in our case, the wine pairing ($150pp). Easy, efficient... I wish many more restaurants would employ this reservation tactic. The food, overall, was excellent.  From the scallops to the lobster to the wagyu to the duck, all were perfectly executed as was the well orchestrated service.  All in all we had some 10 or so courses, inclusive of dessert.  Talking about the desserts, I didn't love them, and that includes the ""grand finale"" dessert which was great in presentation but fell well short in taste. In fact, as compared to all the other 3-Star Michelin Restaurants I have dined at, this one fell very short in the all important sweets department.  We also elected for the wine pairing. Ordinarily, I am very picky of the wine I drink. So much so I take my own personal wine almost everywhere I go except Alinea does not permit customers to bring their own wine so we elected to go with the pairing.  It was better than most pairings I've had but not exceptional...  not memorable... And there is the reason for the 4 stars.  Overall a great experience with good food and pretty good although not great wine.  But even with all the originality displayed in the presentation , I didn't find this dinner to be ""perfection"" in every way. I am not craving to go back although I suspect we probably will as we love to travel to Chicago and my wife loved Alinea.

Top shelf caviar, a truffle explosion,and a melt in your mouth veal cheek will erase that quickly. Never have I used the video record function so much in a restaurant before.

Apologies for the tardiness as I was here in January 2014 but it's been a busy spring at work and well... if I don't work I can't afford to eat at places like this : ) Alinea's decor is very plain, but the idea is to not look around but to showcase the food. It's also not very big, which is one of several reasons why it's hard to get a reservation. The ticket process is fine, but it needs to be for an even party which can result in rather awkward conversations with friends, etc if someone is the odd person out, but that's how it goes. You also pay 20% gratuity in advance. At first I was put off by this as I was concerned that the service wouldn't be good, but it was excellent. One tip I had received from a fellow yelper: don't do the wine pairings. It tends not to be the best wine. I actually wouldn't expect to drink much there but I had 2 glasses of mediocre wine which happened to be $25 each plus 20% service : ) But this is a 5 star review for the food and the overall experience. The plates are small but they are beautifully presented, we started with the char roe in a little bubble glass, followed by a scallop served in the shell. As Ron Burgundy would say ""Great Merlin's beard the scallop was good"". (no jazz flute at Alinea). The dungeness crab was next and it looked by a campfire ground kinda complete with a crackling fire inthe middle of the table. What we didn't know was that some of the 'firelogs' were actually wagyu beef chunks cooking in front of us, so it was unwrapped for us in the next dish. The veal cheeks were suprisingly my favorite with the pine taste to it. As many others have mentioned we also had the hot/cold potato soup. My only complaint is that it there wasn't an option to funnel a gallon of it because it was so good. The black truffle is very good, but remember to keep your mouth closed! There was also a duck dish with about 50 different topping to choose from. very amusing. Oh and of course the apple baloon you can eat. There were a few other dishes, the dessert made on the tabletop was delicious as was the pumpkin stick. Of the 13 dishes were had, there was only one that was meh and that was the five flavor ginger. It was the equivalent of 5 ginger tic tacs on 5 prongs. It was really a palate cleanser, but it was considered a 'dish'.

2014-05-31,2.0,"And my 900th review goes to Alinea! Alinea is the type of restaurant you go to once in your lifetime for the experience and would probably never return to again; not because it's incredibly expensive, but because even though the food was good, it's not good enough to warrant a second visit (for me, at least). Knowing I had an upcoming business trip to Chicago, I wasn't completely sure if I wanted to drop nearly four hundies on a meal. When I finally decided to commit and attempted to buy tickets a month in advance, the restaurant was unsurprisingly sold out for the weekend I was going to be in town. It was a big weekend and people from all over were flying in for a restaurant industry trade show, myself included, so I wasn't the only one interested in dining at the one of the World's 50 Best Restaurants. Luckily, Alinea eventually also came to this realization and decided to open their restaurant the Monday following the weekend (they're normally closed on Mondays & Tuesdays). I stalked their reservation website and managed to secure a pair of tickets for 8:30 pm. The two-story restaurant is on the small side, but by no means cramped. We arrived and opened the nondescript front door to a long hot pink-lit hallway. Halfway down, sleek doors to our left slid open and a host greeted us. Even though we were 30-minutes early, we were seated immediately and I was glad we got our evening started earlier than planned. The decor is simple and understated to highlight the molecular gastronomy. Hanging above each table was a vegetable, which we thought was strange but I don't want to spoil any surprises. Let's just say every little thing, down to the details, serves a purpose. 14-course Tasting Menu ($275 pp) Hot Potato,  yelp.com/biz_photos/alin… Salsify,  yelp.com/biz_photos/alin… Lobster,  yelp.com/biz_photos/alin… Sweetbreads,  yelp.com/biz_photos/alin… Ebi,  yelp.com/biz_photos/alin… Wagyu,  yelp.com/biz_photos/alin… Lily Bulb,  yelp.com/biz_photos/alin… Rhubarb,  yelp.com/biz_photos/alin… Wood Ear,  yelp.com/biz_photos/alin… Black Truffle,  yelp.com/biz_photos/alin… Duck,  yelp.com/biz_photos/alin… Pistachio,  yelp.com/biz_photos/alin… Balloon,  yelp.com/biz_photos/alin… Chocolate Cake (Birthday),  yelp.com/biz_photos/alin… Milk Chocolate,  yelp.com/biz_photos/alin… The courses were either a hit or miss for me. Unfortunately, I didn't particularly care for nor like most of them, especially the Ebi and Lily Bulb (I had to force this down). However, my favorites were definitely the Hot Potato, Lobster, and Wagyu as I love contrast in textures and flavors, and these three were just that. All four desserts were fantastic and so fun, especially the balloon! The presentation for all the courses, plus the added element of surprise (you don't know the menu beforehand), really made the overall meal much more unique, interactive, and memorable -- even if I didn't like all of the dishes. You truly use all your senses at Alinea. Service A bit uptight and to be honest, I didn't feel 100% comfortable. Our server and sommelier would stand off to the side, whisper to another, then chuckle, or share glances over our table and smirk after presenting courses to us throughout the night. Maybe it didn't have anything to do with us, maybe it did. Either way, I can't say it was the most pleasant service. They were nice, but that was it. The host should also smile more -- while I waited for the restroom and peered into the kitchen, I asked him a couple of questions about operations and Chef Achatz for the sake of conversation, but he was unfriendly, cold, and abrupt with his answers. Not the type of service I expected, especially when I'm paying this much for a meal. Michelin: 3 stars (2014) World's 50 Best: no. 9 (2014)",0.9968,0.795,0.147,0.058,0.5559275793650793

2014-05-12,5.0,"Definitely a once in a lifetime experience! I've been wanting to go to Alinea since my last Chicago trip back in 2010. This time I decided to make it happen and planned accordingly. We had a 5pm table on Wednesday 4/30. Tickets for the tasting were $210 each and the wine pairing was $125. All prices were subject to tax and 20% service charge. Hot potato - Cold potato, black truffle, butter. Was on the Best thing I ever ate on the Food network. Hot and cold potato with truffle all taken like a shot from a wax cup! Wine pairing - Champagne guiborat blancs des blancs brut NV Salsify - Branch camouflage. An interactive course. We got to forage for our food! Lobster - Curry, earl grey, grapefruit. All the lovely sauces paired wonderfully with the lobster. Wine pairing - Vin de pays de l'herault mas jullien 2010 Sweetbreads - Orange, ginko nut, cinnamon chopsticks. This was a play on Chinese takeout. This came in a Chinese take out box wrapped in a plastic bag with cinnamon chopsticks! Wine pairing - Vrouvray tendre domaine du viking 2011 Ebi - Celtuce, yuzu, sea grape. All on a kombu chip! A great little bite! Wagyu - Parsnip, black trumpet, kombu. This was brought out as a little table decor, then lit on fire. Finally revealed as a charred parsnip and wagyu! Wine pairing - Sato no homare pride of the village junnai ginjo-shu, sudo honke shuzo. Ibaraki-ken. Lily bulb - Rambutan, distillation of caviar lime. This was our palette cleanser. I wasn't a huge fan of this. The lily bulbs were a little too strong and the serving was a little too much for an intermezzo. Rhubarb - Celery root, celery branch, licorice. My least favorite course of the night. There was rhubarb hanging above us the when we sat down which was shaved on top of this dish. It was too sweet and too strong. Even though the serving was small, I couldn't bring myself to finish it. Wine pairing - Matthiasson rose, california 2007 Wood ear - Pig ear, allium, garlic. When they dug up the wagyu from the fire, I was actually expecting pig. We finally got some! Wine pairing - Crozes hermitage cuvee gaby domaine du colombier 2011 Black truffle - Explosion, asparagus, parmesan. My favorite dish of the night! I could have eaten several of them they were so good! Our server told us this is what the chef served to his investors to convince them to invest in this restaurant. I understand why they said yes! Duck - Foie gras, morel, dragon's breath. I love to eat duck! But they kind of scare me aesthetically so the duck vessel holding the foie and dumplings was not my fav. Regardless I did enjoy this dish. Wine pairing - Ricardo esponoza antiyal valle de maipo 2010 Pistachio - Mascarpone, black walnut, rose. I didn't really care for this dessert. There was a salty element in the ice cream that just ruined the whole dish for me. Wine pairing - Chateau tirecul la graviere les pins monbazillac 2011 Balloon - Helium, green apple. Such a fun course! You suck out all the helium, talk like a chipmunk  and then eat the balloon and string! Milk Chocolate - Pate sucree, violet, hazelnut. I can't even describe how awesome it was to watch them make this dessert! This is definitely a treat! Wine pairing - Maculan torcolato breganze 2009 I was kind of hesitant about buying the tickets for the 5p reservation since it was such an early time to have dinner, but it was cheaper so I decided to go for it. In the end I'm glad I did cuz everything was a surprise for us. We were the first ones to get every dish!  The wine flowed freely. If I ran out or drank my whole glass of wine, they would happily refill it so I had some for the rest of the course or next. There were a couple courses that didn't quite gel for me, but overall, I think Alinea is one of the better three Michelin star restaurants I've been to. I would definitely recommend Alinea to anyone looking to splurge since this really was such a unique dining experience!",0.993,0.861,0.105,0.034,0.5339137645107795

2014-04-24,5.0,"Best restaurant I've ever been to.  The graceful and beautiful combination of art, science and food is what Alinea masters. It well deserves its 3 Michelin Stars. Chef Grant Achatz is a genius and visionary. Everything from the method of reservations to the feel of the restaurant just blew my mind. The reservation system goes by a ticket method where you need to prepay for the meal (not taking into consideration wine/drinks and gratuity). You might get lucky if you follow them on Facebook and find a last minute reservation open up. My date and I flew in just for the night to dine at Alinea then fly home to NYC the next morning. After check-in, we took an Uber car to Alinea, actually a bit difficult to locate off the bat. We open the door and walk inside to a totally weird pink and purple lit walls with grass floor. We were completely off our element, couldn't help but take a number of pictures. After locating the restaurant entrance, we told them our name and were so excited to walk by the kitchen that we took another set of pictures. After seeing how excited we were and all of the pictures we were taking by the kitchen, I think the staff figured that we may as well sit at a table that faces the kitchen, so we did.  Every single dish was an experience. How many times in your life does someone give you a balloon and tell you to suck it then eat it (don't mind the dirty tone). It was a green apple taffy balloon filled with helium - it was so cool! You sound like a chipmunk! Then you get to eat the taffy!  Besides the bells and whistles of the dry ice and fire and cool dessert fudge presentations on the table itself, every single dish was beyond extraordinary. We did the wine pairing as well and were very very happy. The experience was a true journey, we even at one point had to choose different strong garnishes to place on duck. Each garnish changes the flavor of the duck completely. You can just see how much passion goes into every dish which totally influences the flavor of the food. The staff was on point. Food was the best. Totally a league of its own. I can't wait to come back here soon.",0.9955,0.815,0.158,0.027,0.567889317889318

When we walked in, they let us look through the glass enclosure to the kitchen and watch what everyone was doing, which is very rare.  We were seated downstairs in the main dining room and requested to sit next to each other (you will want to ask for this ahead of time if it's just two of you and it's a preference). The food was spectacular.  The best food of both of our lives! Each new dish trumps the prior and be on the lookout for eating your next course, which may be your centerpiece, flying or made right in front of you.  Completely amazing!  *Tips:* 1. Make sure you have a wine pairing, we did the traditional ($150 pp) as opposed to the Reserve ($250 pp).  You can't do fine dining without wine :) 2.

As other reviewers have mentioned, the wine pairing is expensive (plan for an additional ~$175/person) and I didn't find them over the top fabulous but they were really good.  I did find the sommelier to be pretentious yet scruffy.  He looked like a jolly fellow, but when he presented each wine course he listed off the name of it as if we should obviously know the wine and where is was from and then left quickly.  Given the level of experience, I would have liked him to read the group, offer a couple brief tasting notes other than the name.  If you're not super into wine, I would suggest getting a couple bottles (one white, one red) that you can enjoy through the meal.   Regarding the rest of the service, generally the service was very nicely done and executed as if it were a choreographed show.",0.9824,0.817,0.158,0.025,0.5293560606060607
2014-03-31,5.0,"30.  Thirty.  THIRTY.  Thur-Tee. i.am .thirty. I made it. I'm 30 years old, I didn't die, no one else died at my expense (I'm 98% sure that's an accurate statement)... ""much success"", as that kooky internet meme dog would say ( bit.ly/1gW3jCQ ).  I don't feel a day over 12, but it's still weird to think that I'm the age my parents were when they were already married for 5 years, owned a house, and had two screaming brats to look after.  Me? I'm not married, never engaged, own nothing of value, and kids... well, I once asked a doctor if it were possible to cauterize my fallopian tubes, so don't hold your breath on that one. Arrested development might as well be my middle name, but after dining at Alinea (named World's Best Restaurant by the 1% and some other publications), I feel like I can mark this down as one of my few but fierce lifetime milestones. Expectations: I had them... and they were met. Exceeded? Debatable.  I know what that makes me sound like, but hear me out. Maybe I'm still the same brat I was born as 30 years ago, but maybe I'm on to something.  I have no doubt as to Grant Achatz's talent. That's just a universal truth and dining at Alinea is indeed an experience. Duh. And I'm sure Chef Achatz's will sleep much sound-er tonight knowing some jerk from the suburbs is confident he's got talent,  BUT... (and I know I sound crazy) if you're going to be dining at this caliber and this price point I know a place that does it better.  Maybe it's unfair to outright compare in my review of Alinea, but I feel like it's important to know if you're only going to dine at one destination of this sort that Grace Restaurant ( bit.ly/1klQGiG ) really had the edge on almost every course, with the only exception being dessert. Both are exceptional, but in a one-for-one comparison, both my Dad (who was my gracious dining partner and meal ticket) and I would rate Grace above both Alinea and NEXT. It's the under-dog Alinea of Chicago, but without Alinea proper, there would likely be no place for the likes of Grace. And that's where I'll leave the comparison part of this review and decide on 5-stars overall as tribute. Alinea paves the way for future Chefs. With that being said, the meal while being experienced was exquisite.  The meal in hindsight had me re-thinking.  The menus change seasonally and the Alinea team is consistently reinventing the way we think of food, but I just have a hard time believing that the late March 2014 menu is Alinea's shining best. I know I'm not well versed in finer things and that I'd have a harder time passing as a classy human than I would passing for a cyborg, but when describing the most memorable parts of our meal, a part of me had to wonder if the joke was on us. Here's why: // One of the courses was basically Chinese food left-overs with fancy ingredients. I respect what was done and the uniqueness of what went into the dish, but at the end of the day, it still tasted like decent Chinese food and it was served in the same white Chinese food take-out containers you'd eat out of while on your couch watching your favorite guilty pleasure in your PJs. The dish was even sitting on a wadded up 'Thank you! Enjoy!' plastic bag.  // Another course was fish butts (which I actually love, in real life) with condiment packets on old newspaper obituaries and comics. And another table of all men got tall boys of PBR to pair with this course.  Of course not all courses were like that, but of the 15 that came out, those were two of them and in the end that's a decent portion of the entire meal being wavering on the gimmicky side. Maybe it's fun for the 1% to eat like the rest of us do 6 out of 7 nights of the week, but I'm still not entirely sure it wasn't us all being made a fool of in the 'The Emperor's New Clothes' style way.   I think my favorite course was the Char Roe with banana, ginger, passion fruit and also Branch Camouflage that looked and tasted like beef jerky (that should give you idea of how refined my palate is not). The dessert was also spectacular and if you're lucky enough Chef Grant Achatz will be the one preparing it table-side for you.  The decor in our dining room (2nd floor, street-side) was pretty meh for me. I think that's how it's supposed to be so you're not distracted from the food, but to me it just kind of comes off as semi-decorated hotel conference room. Again, I have no class and not a ton of experience in 'finer things', so maybe that's how fancy pants people prefer dining, but to me it was too plain-face and I would've killed for a little music. At the end of the day I'm 30 and elated to even have had the opportunity to write this review. Chef Achatz paved the way for so many and while I didn't *love* this reincarnation of the menu or the stiff atmosphere, Alinea is still world-class and changing the way we look at food and the measures it can be taken to.

2014-03-12,5.0,"If you have a reservation at Alinea in the near future, I suggest you stop reading all the Yelp Spoilers. I know, I know. I'm usually the first one that just has to know what to always expect. My only suggestion is to look up what the building exterior looks like (or you might miss it). Other than that, don't ruin it. I'm warning you. Stop. Look away.  For the rest of you, I still won't spoil it completely. I refuse to. Arrived promptly at 9:30pm.  The building is unmarked. No name. No clue. We entered into a mauve tunnel and about 6 steps in, magic doors opened unexpectedly into the unknown. We spotted the hostess and cheerfully greeted her. She stared us down and after an awkward 6-7 second pause she announced ""We were expecting you an hour ago."" Shit. What was she talking about? Turns out, she was correct. I doubted her at first because I am a sticklet for reservations. Alas, once I checked my confirmation e-mai, I saw she was correct. ""We will still be able to honor your reservation"", she finally (and icily) said. My heart sunk. I waited for this reservation for over a month! I would have been so sad had we left then. I'm not sure why we confused the times. I apologized, but she was not caving. We were escorted up to our table on the 2nd floor. One of our (many) waiters came by and assured us it was OK (despite the last seating being then). Thankfully, everything was smooth sailing from then on. Our dinner was pre-paid. We purchased ""tickets"" online instead of reserving the traditional way. They do things differently here. (TIP: Follow them on Facebook/Twitter. They always announce when the tickets are on sale and you have a better chance at snagging a reservation.) The dinner consisted of 13 small courses. You have to know that almost everything at Alinea has a surprise factor. The attention to detail is astounding. Everything has a purpose: every plate, utensil, setting, etc.. Once there, we decided to add the wine pairing to our dinner as well. Although I did not love every single pairing (as in, I would never have it outside of Alinea), each one paired perfectly with its course. My favorites were the Selbach-Oster Riesling Kabinett (surprisingly so), the Sato No Homare Sake, and the Chateau Tirecul a Graviere. Without giving all the details away, I will say that my favorite courses were the scallops, lobster, wagyu, hot potato, and duck. Those were ALL delicious! My least favorites were the pistachio dessert and lily bulbs. Yes, I ate flowers. I also inhaled helium, and had a course called "" ........?????............!!!!!!!!!!!!! "" . I laughed, I mmm'd and had a memorable night. For the skeptics (like me), this was surprisingly enjoyable. I'm usually not a fan of gimmicky restaurants. I can even go as far as compare this to a similar one I recently dined at (and another 3 Michelin Star one) which I detested: you can read about it here:  yelp.com/biz/the-restaur…   While Meadowood left me mentally and physically starved, Alinea did not. Are you going to roll out of there stuffed? Probably not! You will, however, leave there satisfied and with a better understanding of high end cuisine and it's intricate techniques. I am so humbled I was able to experience it and feel like a better diner now because of it.  Service was wonderful. I will say this too: do not dine at Alinea if you don't have a sense of humor and an understanding of sarcasm. With the exception of our frowning hostess, the staff was ALL witty, sharp, focused, professional and full of one liners. It worked beautifully with our party. It also works flawlessly with this kind of food where delivery and presentation are key factors! I would love to be a fly on the wall during the hiring and training process. Do they train them at the Improv? I lost count on how many waiters we had all night for each course. I saw at least 9 different ones who presented a course and interacted with us.  I was actually sad when I realized it was over. I felt like it should have been 2 courses longer. I hesitantly pushed my chair back and left. Unfortunately, Alinea is not the kind of place you can return to immediately. I would think you need to let some time pass and wait for them to switch their menu around. I do plan to hopefully return in a couple of years. Next time though, I will triple confirm my reservation time. I wouldn't want to get the death stare from that hostess again. Ha! I kid. I will be on time though.  Promise.",0.9968,0.769,0.149,0.082,0.5766867590918223

Pluses: Amazing food, amazing presentation, awesome service.  How can you not go wrong?   We had some of the most memorable dishes we've ever had, especially a beef dish that the presentation was so surprising and unexpected and amazing.   We must have had 8 different servers come by, and they visited our table like 30 times?   Where else do you get that?  And the wine pairings were worth it, it really complimented the food.  And the duck dish that only had the description of ""?????....!!!!!!!"", while very confusing, was so accurate it was scary. Negatives: It is expensive.  But as long as you are prepared for that shock, it's fine.  It was somewhere in the $400+ per person with wine pairings.  The lack of a real non-alcoholic pairing was a little disappointing because some of those are the best. Recommendations: If you are a foodie, consider saving up for it once.  Do not take a picky eater!  I most likely will wait a year plus to go back, but it was really incredible.  And I was much happier with the layout of the restaurant over Next (who I ended up with 2 stars for multiple reasons).",0.9689,0.805,0.153,0.042,0.5959999999999999

I would say that my favorite dishes were the wagyu beef that was cooking on my table, as well as the duck 5 ways with 60 accoutrements. It was an honor to have chef Grant prepare my dessert on my table, and I was in awe of the design. The wine pairings were very interesting, especially my sake which turned out to be one of the best sakes that I've had. Overall, the ambiance upstairs in the dining room was lacking but I can understand since all the attention should be on the edible art.

If really intracately crafted high end artwork as cuisine is your thing, Alinea will be a life changing experience.  Plus, you'll be surrounded by staff and other guests who share your love of turning dining into a true five sense memory.  The craftsmanship is absolutely the finest in the world.  Whatever the menu is on the day you arrive, you can bet it'll be prepared perfectly. If that sort of thing just isn't your bag - which is totally cool - going to Alinea would be like shelling out $700 to see ""Ishtar"".  For me, it was the noblest use of my self indulgence fund that I could possibly have imagined.  Awesome.",0.9722,0.831,0.143,0.026,0.6374074074074074
2014-02-08,3.0,"Let me start by saying that Alinea's ticketing/reservation process is not something I am a fan of. Every restaurant makes money by turning tables. Alinea makes money by pre-selling seats and does not allow refunds. (Stuff) happens, however.  Parents of a young child cannot find a babysitter and are forced to bring him. $210 + tax, tip and wine times two is A LOT of money. My original dining partner became ill the night before our reservation. I called the next day to see if rescheduling was a possibility. It was not, and yes, I was aware of refunds/rescheduling not being possible. Tough luck, I suppose. This is an issue that should be addressed. The French Laundry has a $100 deposit. Enough ranting; onto why people go there. Entering the door I immediately smelled anise. It was pleasant. I don't want to give too much info, there are a lot of surprises throughout your dining experience.   I brought a bottle of wine along, not to be opened but was hoping Chef Achatz was in and able to sign it. It was a bottle where he was an assistant wine maker at La Jota in Napa Valley. He did sign it and I was extremely thankful for it.      My guest and I were seated upstairs and were warmly welcomed. Not giving away too much, the decor looked like a high end lounge in the Star Trek universe. I had let a service representative know that I had a food allergy after ""buying tickets."" The initial server acknowledged my food allergy and let me know that they would accommodate me.  We were asked if we wanted wine. I was reluctant. I am a wine snob, but I really didn't feel like spending more coin than I already have for this experience.  Onto the food! We started with an amuse bouche of ARCTIC CHAR ROE, banana pudding, passion fruit foam and ginger.  My bouche was amused.  Highly flavorful, lots of textures and everything in balance.  Great start. Next a SCALLOP dish served amazingly that involved all of our senses. It was a beautiful dish that I shouldn't spoil for an Next was LOBSTER with curry, an intense Earl Grey syrup and grapefruit. The curry was awesome and ended up bringing some home with me as it ended up on my shirt. Super tasty dish. At this point in the meal I wondered if we were getting the oyster leaf that I've read a lot of amazing reviews. It didn't come. Huge bummer. Next was WAGYU with parsnip, black trumpet and kombu. I won't spoil how this was presented.  It was a gorgeous, flavorful and extremely memorable. As much as I liked it, I don't think Wagyu, in general is worth its weight. I had properly cooked A11 grade Wagyu at L2O a couple of years ago, and it was underwhelming. SWEETBREADS done in the style of Orange Chicken was next. This was an excellent dish with intense orange and mustard flavors. There was also a black garlic jus that was mouth coating and rich. Awesome dish. HOT POTATO: Playful showcase of contrasting temperatures in a dish. It was a nifty presentation that was full of truffled goodness.   DUCK: Here is where things got crazy tasty. 5 different preparations for duck with 60 different accompaniments.There was anything from olives to a port wine reduction to a menthol jelly. Lots of odd combos and many worked well. The foie gras pate was probably the most memorable bite of the evening. GINGER: A palate cleanser, very flavorful, refreshing, spicy and enjoyable. And I don't like ginger that much. At this point I was concerned about not getting the Truffle Explosion that I've read many reviews on. Another gigantic disappointment.   PUMPKIN: I wasn't sad too long after the first dessert dish. This was nearly on par with coffee and doughnuts from the French Laundry. Unctuous, not overly sweet and another awesome bite.   PISTACHIO: Served with toasted pistachios, pistachio gelato, black walnut cake, mascarpone and STRAWBERRY something. The black walnut cake was floral and very surprising. The pistachio components were absolutely awesome.  I saw the strawberry component on the plate, I'm not sure if it was meringue or what. I did explain that it was the seeds I was allergic to. Once the plate arrived, they did not say, ""hey, this doesn't have strawberry seeds in it, dig in!"" This dish was awesome without trying the strawberry anyway.   BALLOON: A green apple balloon with an edible string floated to our table. It was good, not great.  Think green apple Laffy Taffy.   MILK CHOCOLATE: Chef Achatz assembled an edible masterpiece in front of my guest and I. Hot chocolate, butterscotch, a cracker crust, hazelnut, violet syrup and frozen milk finished our meal. The hot chocolate was good, not as pleasant as everything else was. While he was making the dessert, I wanted to thank him for an excellent meal, but I fangirled and failed to say a word to him.  Is Alinea the best meal I've had? No. $280 per person without wine for was not worth the coin. Flavors were amazing. Service was nearly flawless, warm and friendly.  It was an epic meal, but probably won't be returning.  '",0.9995,0.748,0.204,0.048,0.5841727053140094

I booked reservation few month in advance for me and my husband to celebrate my birthday, paid over 600 for it, was very excited to experience the fine and exquisite dining!  The good: (I really want to start with the bad but trying to stay fair) The ambiance, very relaxing, soft lights. The staff very attentive, the knew it is my birthday and congratulated me several times, they knew about all the dietary restrictions we both had. Presentation of the food is beautiful. Deserts were very good (not $600 good but good) The bad: food! The first 2 courses left a soap taste in our mouth. Really. What ever tasted ok on the next courses was in the size of my half pinky. We would leave hungry if not a desert. For that much money, and I have no problem to pay for something that is worth it, the food should taste good, instead we had a soap taste and tooth paste. Now if you do not have money to waist - find your self a different place to go. If you have the money and you want to pay it to look at a beautiful presented plates, good desert - go ahead. But if you saving money for that evening - I would not do it. We did not ordered wine pairing at 200 per person but had 2 (maybe 3) half glasses of wine and 1 tea and ended up with additional $55.00.

2014-02-03,5.0,"Welcome back, my friends to the show that never ends. Come inside, the show's about to start. If life truly is all panem et circenses, I'd like to spend my days idly by in the comforts of Alinea. A dinner here is a little like meeting Morpheus. You take the red pill, you stay in Wonderland, and Alinea shows you how deep the rabbit hole goes. I'm fine arguing that it's the best meal I've ever had--better than French Laundry, than L'Atelier, and all the other Michelin and non-Michelin experiences I've had in my life. It's that good. It starts with the service, which is not only first-rate, but--even more importantly--extremely comfortable. A charming conversation can be had. Like Rusty tells Linus, they've got to like you then forget you the moment you've left their side. Apt advice for a waiter, and followed to a T by the fine folks at Alinea. The wine pairings. Yes. Healthy pours all, and they gave me ""just a splash"" three times. I think I was on cloud nine by course six. Anyways, the food. Amazing, yet accessible. Fancy, yet playful. Delicious, yet really, really, good golly miss molly, delicious. Should I go through? Let's go through. The osetra amuse-bouche reminded me of a Robuchon special. I knew things were looking good when I saw, and subsequently tasted, the lime foam. The next two appetizers were arguably my favorites. The scallop--closed in shell--required all five senses. If you're wondering on the sound, there was a babbling brook sound under a bed of seaweed. The scallop and Peruvian influenced sauce was mind-bogglingly good. The third of the apps was a stuffed shrimp head. As Anthony Bourdain says, if you don't like what's in a shrimp head, we can't be friends. As if playfulness weren't already a huge factor, the one-two punch of a lobster campfire, followed by revealing said campfire as a wagyu-(or tuna)-parsnip makeshift barbacoa, was ingenious. And tasty. My second experience with sweetbreads went better than the first, probably putting me back in the good graces if Bourdain knew who I was. And a hot potato, cold potato sidebar set us up for the wham bam dish known only as ????....!!!!! (and etc., so forth) on the menu. It's duck four ways (turbot for her), served with 60 spices, additives, and accoutrements, which become more fun to taste than the duck itself. Onto dessert, and a ginger five ways bested the duck's four, but not the supplemental 60. I'm from Missouri on sweetbreads, but I actively dislike pumpkin. I may have been converted yet again by Alinea's pumpkin sticky on a stick, for lack of any other better term. That was followed by a pistachio gelato, perhaps the only dish I didn't thoroughly fancy. I could've sucked the complementing marscapone dry, though. As if three desserts weren't enough, the infamous balloon had yet to make its appearance. It finally did, and it was sticky, amusing, and infused with a tart green apple taste that reminded me of elementary school wonder. Oh, and so did the helium sucking. Or maybe that was my college years. Whatever the case may be. The final canvas dessert of chocolate was pure overkill, and turned out to be the only dish we didn't ravenously devour. We left half that sucker, in a bigger mess than it first came. Stomachs satiated. Brain entertained. Bodies warmed. Hearts happy. Thank you for a finest of the fine meal, Alinea.",0.9932,0.81,0.146,0.043,0.5539194139194139
2014-02-02,1.0,"I have pondered writing this review for over 5 years now,  yes 5 years, and have finally decided to purge my soul here on yelp of the less then perfect experience I had at Alinea. My wife and I went to  Alinea for a very special occasion dinner celebrating a birthday and our engagement, we had both been looking forward to this dinner with every taste bud we had. The problems started when a dish arrived which contained cilantro, my wife has a horrible reaction to cilantro and nothing taste right to her after she eats even just a small bite.  I called one of the numerous servers that waited on us that night to explain the problem, she was very understanding and whisked both our dishes away, in a short time she brought back one plate with out cilantro for my wife and mine with the cilantro how it was meant to be served, perfectly handled. We where enjoying our meal and another course arrived that again contained cilantro. not just a sprig but many tiny pieces of micro cilantro sprinkled liberally over the top of the dish. I again called one of our servers over and told him about the problem, this was a different person then helped correct the problem the first time. I was shocked to hear him say its only a garnish you can pick it off.  I started to speak up and my wife who hates any kind of scene said its fine ill just pick it off. I did not want to ruin the mood and great time we where having on this special dinner so we continued on with our dining adventure. It is crazy that a restaurant of this caliber and price tells you to remove something you can't eat yourself. How are we to know the cilantro does not go deeper in the dish. The request for cilantro should of been noted after the first incident and never made it onto my wife's plate again. Numerous times we dinned at restaurants from upscale to very modest and cilantro had shown up on a dish but was not listed on the menu and the server gladly took the dish remade it and brought it back. A chain is only as strong as its weakest link and the one server who told us to pick off the cilantro was the weakest link effecting the entire chain.  We went on with our meal and at the end of the night were given a menu, a nice touch that would make it easy to recall the courses we ate as there was so many. Not until we arrived home did we see we where not served a course, The Butterscotch Bacon Course and the accompanying wine pairing!!! How could we have not noticed this we had dreamed of this dish since we heard of Alinea. Both my wife and I are bacon lovers and looked so forward to it. I guess we where overwhelmed with so many courses and the magical celebration. It bothered me so much I had to write a letter to Alinea. I told them of the issue with the cilantro and the missing bacon course that we had dreamed of. Six weeks had passed so I called to see if they received the letter. After being on hold a while I was told yes they had the letter but the person who would be in charge of this type of problem was out of the country for a while. Really so they can't deal with it thru email or better yet delegate it to someone else or at a minimum tell use they received the letter and that they would get back to us instead of making us chase them down. So I waited and maybe another month passed and no word so I called again. At this point I was so appalled at Alineas follow up and customer service to a issue like this it made me feel taken advantage of, like they did not value our business or thought they where to good to have to deal with the problem. All the wonderful reviews and accolades who cares about one regular guy if he has a problem. Well finally about 3 months after I wrote the letter did I received a response. They said they where sorry they strive to be better and appreciate us letting them know about the issues and apologize for the problem. They summed it up by saying  they hope to get the chance to make it up to us.  Seriously, I don't go out to dinners like this more then maybe ONCE in my life. It's not like I just will stroll in on my walk home and grab a quick bite. So here is how I look at it, the cilantro was a error I can forgive but the missed course is not. If I went to the grocery store and bought a dozen eggs and when I arrived home and saw there was only 11 eggs the grocery store would give me the missing egg, and probably say here is a new whole dozen for your inconvenience. So what should of Alinea done? They should of given me my missing egg that's all they had to do, before service if they would of invited us in and served us the missing bacon course and the wine pairing I would not be harboring 5 years of ill feelings about such a special night.",0.9775,0.791,0.117,0.092,0.5856789477883225

My favorite being the helium balloon and the duck. The tastiest dish was the corn, white chocolate, honey and mango dessert as well as the tuna. The ending was fun too when the chefs came to our table to prepare the last milk chocolate dessert though unfortunately that was the least tasty dish of the night! I haven't given it 5 stars mainly because I was comparing Alinea to other 2 or even one michelin stars (that I have been to) that delivered an amazing experience as well but tastier food.

And, all of that is true. I could go on and on and write pages and pages about the experience (and it was that - an experience). But, instead, unlike my nature of long-winded expressions, I will simply say this: It has been over a year (1 year and 4 months) and we still go on and on with at length conversations reliving that evening, talking in depth about it and still get to experience the sense of awe, wonder, excitement and emotion that evening was filled with. It has been over a year and every couple of weeks our conversations still come back to that evening.

2014-01-01,5.0,"My fiancee and I finally decided to splurge and go to Alinea for dinner. The reservation system is really nice because, even though it's pricy, you've already pre-paid for your dinner and thus feel less stressed about the money part once you're there. The only thing you add on when you're there is drink pairings.  The entire experience is simply phenomenal, and it's really a place where you should think of it as an event rather than just a dinner. What I loved most is that it wasn't super pretentious. Yes, you dress nicely and it's a fancy restaurant. But, it's not stuffy. There are comfortable chairs and nice wood tables. But there aren't white tablecloths and dim lighting. I would describe it as having a modern flair with a very clean look. There are also very few tables in the room, so it feels more private. For the drink pairings, I really liked that you could split a pairing between yourselves and thus only pay for one pairing. That way, you can both taste the drinks that they recommend with your food but not feel like you're breaking the bank (for people that are more money conscious).  As for the food, it was simply spectacular! With so many small dishes, the worry is that you'll leave here still hungry. But, that's anything but the truth. The dishes are spaced out perfectly and timed to your eating style, so it's great because you are never waiting too long, and you end up leaving stuffed. Each dish is also its own little experience, so make sure to savor every moment. If at all possible, don't pay attention to the other tables! That way, you can have each dish be a little surprise. :) Overall, I was definitely not disappointed by Alinea and would highly recommend everyone goes at least once to experience it.",0.9895,0.805,0.15,0.046,0.6256481481481482

While it's certainly not molecular gastronomy, since you can recognize most of the ingredients, each dish is still intricate to say the least. Playful and artistic, yet with restraint. Perhaps Cubisism rather than completely Abstract. If you worry that all the small plates is not filling enough, just wait till the dessert course.

There isn't a lot of food.   We did order the wine pairing, I would recommend that if anyone does go to this restaurant I would recommend to absolutely not get the pairing.  I would just order a bottle of wine and be done with it or just order some sparling water.  There are so many courses, you will be obscenely drunk at the end of the dinner and craving McDonald's as I was.  And in fact I had to stop at McDonald's after because I was still hungry.  After all of the money I spent also.   My wife and I have been to most of the Michelin starred restaurants in Chicago, in our experience, any restaurant that has one star has been phenomenal.  Our favorite is Moto and we'll back year after year to this place.   Overall, the restaurant does cater to the Michelin committee to make sure they get their stars.  I think the committee members in Chicago should book their reservation as an anniversary and see if anyone wishes them a happy anniversary, I'm pretty sure they won't and that could cost them a star I guess.  Hopefully chef and Nick are reading this and they will take note.  Please committee members take note also.

The food is presented as a show for the table. Each dish is a piece of beautiful artwork and many are really fun to experiment with. One of the highlights was a 60 treasures duck where we each got three pieces of duck and a giant plate with 60 different garnishes/sauces. With no instruction we mixed and matched and came up with our favorite combinations. Another really fun one was a green apple helium balloon; I think it was the first course of the three dessert courses. The entire balloon was edible and made for great laughs around the table as it stuck to your face and you tried to talk with the high pitch helium voice. I won't give up the grand finale dessert, but needless to say each dish was beautiful, had a science feel, and tasted spectacular.

2013-11-22,1.0,"**So, I just came back to check up on this review... and it was missing.  I looked throughout all the reviews... I don't know how they're trying to cover this up, but this seriously needs to be addressed.  Here it is again.** Where do I begin?  A little background about me is that I've been to several Michelin recommended, 1 star and 2 star Michelin restaurants around the world, some at chef's table experiences, so I was very excited coming to this Three Star Michelin restaurant as I have never been to one with this standing before. I've read plenty of reviews on this site and saw several low ratings and disregarded them as oddities.  However, after being there myself this past week I would have to agree with all the low ratings. I will sound like an egotistical food snob, but I have to believe that people who gave Alinea 5 stars were dazzled by their presentation and were either tricked into believing what they ate was in fact a delicious meal or had to lie to themselves to justify the price. I will go into my experience at Alinea from the beginning.   First the ambiance. Everything about Alinea screamed a great attention to detail.  From the moment of finding their ""hidden"" restaurant as I saw no bright sign to indicate it's location to the heavy front door that gave the feeling of exclusivity, to the automatic sliding door in the foyer giving it a contemporary feel, I have to give Alinea's presentation a good score.   Some failures in feel however were the chairs.  Though the chair was comfortable, it's structure was reclined and the cushion was not firm, but rather let me sink in, making me have to lean back.  I found that it was quite uncomfortable while eating.  Now before everyone think's it's because I'm overweight, I'm not.  I am a 154 pounds 5'8"" male.  For a 2-3 hour 13 course meal, this is a very big negative.  Another failure is the table placement.  Due to some of the courses having strong scents, it was quite clumsy of their design to seat people so close to each other.  I felt that it interfered with my personal experience. (again before people start their raving, you must understand that this is a THREE Star Michelin restaurant experience.  Where all aspects of the culinary skills are being appreciated.) Second their service. The service at Alinea was quite excellent.  The Doorman was prompt, the entry host took my party's coats asked if we would need a cab at the end of the dinner and seated us politely and efficiently.  We were greeted at our table and received an explanation of the night and wine pairing choices.  Throughout the night we received ample attention without being smothered, which is always a fine balance.  I would give Alinea an excellent rating on service. Third the food. I'll break this down to several parts and be brief. visual: Visually Alinea's presentation is very good.  Some of the dishes are plated in a stunning fashion that I feel are there to distract you, but yes I admit that the presentation was very good. Smell: It was a hit or miss depending on what my neighbors were having.  Seriously, tables were so close that I was able to converse with them. Taste: OK, so this is the most important component in my opinion.  Everything else is to set the mood for this moment...and I feel that Alinea  fails to meet the standards of a Three Star Michelin restaurant.  I got the lower cost wine pairing with my meal and some dishes were completely distasteful without drinking the ""paired"" drink.  My second dish that I received was so bitter that I had to drown out that taste with a very sweet wine that was paired with it.  Now, I might have a strange school of thought, but when I think of a pairing, it's a complement to a dish to make it better, not a subtitute for a poorly tasting dish.  This happened throughout the meal where the dish was completely off and I had to drown out the taste with the paired drink. Final thoughts: Having experienced several great Michelin restaurants around the world, I was very disappointed with my experience with Alinea.  They were creative in their approach to form an experience, but they failed to capture my praise.  I would recommend people not waste their money at this establishment as your culinary adventure will leave you disappointed and still hungry at the end.  For the cost, they deserve a one star review for not  making their food taste delicious regardless of ambiance. This experience has left me surprised that the standards to receiving a Michelin Star, and even more so for three stars in the United States is low. My past favorite restaurants if people can travel: I would recommend Ciel Bleu in Amsterdamn, UltraViolet in Shanghai, Thoumieux in Paris. edit*: Also, I was confused why I didn't get my menu in the beginning of my meal and I was very disappointed that it wasn't signed by the chef.  It would take him 5 minutes to do as his patrons are all paying for tickets in advance",0.9919,0.755,0.142,0.104,0.47009027777777773
2013-11-21,5.0,"God, I love this place! This was the first 3 Michelin star restaurant that I've gone to, and while I don't know what exactly qualifies a restaurant to achieve that status, I can definitely say that this place is of greater caliber than any other place I've been to. Once you pay for the tickets for the meal (quite the $$$$$ price tag), rest assured the time that you spend at the restaurant will make you feel like you're in wonderland.  One thing to mention here is that wine or coffee/espresso is not included in the bill.  If you want any of that, be prepared to pay extra once arriving.  Also, they do not serve any cocktails/hard liquor. We sat down for an excellent prix fixe menu, and were amazed at every bite.  Each dish displays its own creativity and unique taste.  The smallest bites have the most substantial punch of flavor, which is incredible.  They play with your senses, taste, vision, smell, to bring about a delightful experience.  We were always kept on the edge of our seat, waiting for what the next surprise was going to be.   The best, most incredible finale was the dessert.  A chocolate torte made on the table with incredible toppings and a violet sauce, which just melded everything together.  My wife and I tried to scarf down as much of the torte as we could, but it was so big, we couldn't finish the whole thing.  Stuffed and thoroughly impressed by the entire experience, we left with smiles on our faces. Service was excellent.  They obsessively clean every granule that is on the table.  Each dish comes with a description on what we're eating, and (in some cases) how it should be eaten.  By the end of the night, I felt that we were well taken care of.

2013-11-19,5.0,"The reviews, the ratings and the difficulty getting a table definitely all were part of creating huge expectations. On the way we discussed if we might get really disappointed. But the experience was sublime! It started while entering through a pine forest were we played hide and seek. While waiting for my husband to turn over the car to valet our children and myself played hide and seek in this interesting entrance. When we got into the restaurant we were greeted by the kitchen entrance with a cup of pine infused hot chocolate. As we were going through our courses we were amazed by each dish - the emphasis on the flavors, ingredients and presentation was impeccable. And it was so much more than regular upscale french food - the presentation was interactive, different and well thought out. 3 dishes in particular stood out - one with a thai inspired tom yum fried shrimp. Still can sense these flavors and longing to come back for it. The apple taffy helium balloon was really funny and interesting, but my youngest did pass out from it as I there thought he was faking but since have read up that his reaction to the helium is not uncommon. The chocolate frozen desert was was also one of my absolute favorite deserts and the biggest disappointment was that we couldn't possible finish that much desert. It was really something worth coming back for. Our only irritation of the evening was a group sitting behind us which was rather loud and thought they should take it upon themselves to entertain the rest of the dining room. It is such a shame when people haven't learned to contain themselves and show consideration for other patrons and respect for the food being served. When encountering such a group of people I wonder why some are so annoyed over children in a restaurant because our children have never been this loud, and they know how to eat with knife and fork, and they try everything that is brought to them. The service was so friendly and perfect. They knew to come at the right times and were very attentive. They even remarked a little spurt/splash/mini explosion from a hot dish that was being made at the table and immediately came and removed it and apologized. They then corrected the mistake by not serving the dish that way for the rest of the tables. Nothing had happened and we were fine but when the bill came they had complimented our drinks as an apology for the mistake.

2013-11-14,5.0,"They say that dining at Alinea (or any other Michelin three starred restaurant, for that matter) is the meal of a lifetime.  What's it mean, then, that I've taken an annual pilgrimage to Chicago each year since the first time that I stepped foot into this culinary mecca behind its modest facade and down into the rabbit hole?  I suppose it means that I've lived several lifetimes, and have lived to tell the tales.   You never really know what you're going to get when you get to Alinea.  Will you be greeted by the long, shadowy hallway, illuminated in red to get to the hidden mechanical doors?  Or will the entry be decked out in the flavors of fall with pumpkins and bales of hay, which rustle and snap beneath your fancy dress shoes as you make your way to the door, grabbing a bobbing glass of overwhelmingly aromatic apple cider on your way?   Your dinner at Alinea will be a painstakingly planned, carefully constructed meal that takes you around the world, from a small farm in Michigan to Japan to Italy to the waters of Peru.  The dishes will change each time you return, but a few showstoppers remain constant:  Black Truffle Explosion; Hot Potato, Cold Potato; Pheasant (aka burning leaves)...  There will be fire.  There will be liquid nitrogen.  There will be grand effects that leave your head spinning.   I was humbled and very, very fortunate to have Grant Achatz himself prepare my chocolate sphere dessert the first time that I visited Alinea.  Quite possibly, it is the highlight of every single dining out experience I've ever had.  For the grand finale to your meal, an Alinea chef comes out with a collection of confections and purees.  Using your empty tabletop as a canvas, he proceeds to create a gorgeous work of art before your very eyes.  The chocolate sphere has changed into a chocolate tart in the past year, but the concept remains the same:  food as art.   Like the sand mandala that gets destroyed after Tibetan monks meticulously assemble it, here I was, expected to consume the masterpiece on the table before me.    The destruction of the mandala represents the impermanence of life, of the world.  And its true:  a meal at Alinea doesn't last a lifetime, but its memories do.  It is a worthy once in a lifetime journey to make, but if you're like me and just can't get enough of the memories, you'll just have to go back.  But I guarantee you this:  like the transitory nature of life, no two visits to Alinea will ever be the same.",0.9899,0.838,0.119,0.043,0.48971073517126146

I was so enraptured with the food, that I had to remind myself to drink the wine everything was exquisitely paired with.  Impossible to pick a favorite course out of the 14 offered, however I was partial to the hot potato, the black truffle explosion and the duck.  The only thing I would alter would be less dessert courses. I'm more a savory lover than sweet. That said, the dessert was as delicious as it was beautifully entertaining to have one of the chefs come out and paint chocolate all over our table. What a performance!

However, when the opening credits of ""Spinning Plates"" rolled, we were transported back to Chicago in September 2011. During the film, we nudged each other as we recognized the dramatic entry way and sleek interior of Alinea.  We saw again the unique utensils and the creative, fun, and often indescribable dishes we had enjoyed. We oohed and ahhed as we saw our favorite course appear onto the screen:  the deliciously dramatic performance-art-dessert finale featuring table as canvas.  Once again, I was teased for my admittedly star struck response when I realized that it was you (!) who would be creating our dessert-of-a-lifetime for us.  Alinea was our first molecular gastronomy experience, his first trip to Chicago, our first 3 stars Michelin restaurant, and our first World's 50 Best Restaurants experience (#6 at the time).   Most importantly, our evening at Alinea continues to be a beloved birthday memory.   THANK YOU.

We enjoy dining at nice establishments and have been to many in New York, Las Vegas, and Chicago. I considered Alinea the crème de la crème of molecular gastronomy and could not wait to try this place.  After experiencing our meal here I would have to say that this is surely a once in a lifetime experience. I say this in a positive and negative way. The experience you will have here is like no other but it does come with a hefty price, that many will likely not be able to repeat. Hence, the once in a lifetime phrase.  The restaurant is not very well labeled and you could easily miss it if you didn't know where you were going. When we arrived there were two people out front acting as host and hostess to confirm your reservation, and likely to tell someone on the inside of your arrival via Ipad. She then asked us to enter through a door and down a small corridor lined with flowers contained in small vases. Some of these flowers were made from paper towels and contained a small bite of cotton candy. You then walked down the corridor until you come upon a Star Trek type door opens up leading you into the restaurant.  You are then led to your table where you are greeted by your server to take your drink order and offer you wine pairing, a regular pairing and a reserve pairing. I won't get into the dishes because there are just too many to name but you can be sure that they are each well thought out and presented. Our only problem with the dishes is that some lacked a little with flavor. I was thinking if there was too much thought that went into the presentation of the dishes at the expense of taste. Given the amount of money the meal costs, I expect that this should have been perfected and expect to be blown away with presentation as well as taste. The meal takes a good 2.5-3 hours so don't plan much afterwards. The dessert at the end was also a nice unique way to end the night and made you feel like a kid again.  Chef Achatz was not there the night we were and was at their sister restaurant Next. Not sure if this has anything to do with the quality of the food that evening. All in all it was an experience to be had and I'm glad I had the opportunity to experience it but given the hefty price, I'm not sure if we will be making a repeat appearance.",0.9823,0.869,0.097,0.035,0.5733882783882785

My experience at Alinea was everything wonderful about a dining experience, and then some.  I will be brief, since most of what I'd like to say has already been said. The atmosphere was cool and elegant but not cold, if that makes sense. The waitstaff was fabulous. They were there to deliver each course promptly after the next, but they weren't intrusive. We chatted up the sommelier about a great Lebanese wine that we tried and enjoyed, and he poured us each a complimentary second glass. Not that we needed more wine. Such a small gesture for them, but it made a difference to us.   The dinner was playful, innovative, and really extraordinary. Mr. Achatz deserves those Michelin stars, goddamnit.

2013-09-07,5.0,"Going into the evening, I did just enough homework to know that this experience would likely be different than my other brushes with Michelin Star excellence.  Far from the ""prim and proper"" atmosphere of The French Laundry, I found that I preferred the more relaxed (yet still attentive) service here. My husband and I threw caution to the wind and embarked on the wine pairing adventure. Because nothing at Alinea is quite as it seems, we were pleasantly surprised to encounter beer and sake among the pairings.  Of the laundry list of courses, our table only found a few that weren't notably amazing. Some courses were more of a production or a novelty than part of a meal, but the amusement was not lost on us. I, for one, find it hysterical to have suit coat and Prada-clad patrons talking like chipmunks after literally inhaling the green apple balloon course. Well played, Chef Achatz. Since we had an early seating, I got to enjoy seeing all the other tables around us fumble with the balloon - hilarity bonus.

2013-09-02,3.0,"Walking into Alinea you instantly know your senses are in for a treat. A dark, narrow hallway with real grass beneath your feet guides you to a door, right out of a space ship, that opens as you arrive. The superb staff guided us to our seat where the only decision you have at that point is beverages. We opted for a bottle instead of the wine pairing. My palate isn't strong enough to appreciate the food/wine pairings.       Not long after our drinks arrived our first of 14 dishes ensued.  My detailed description of each course was too long and wouldn't post so my assessment here will be more general. Though overall, each dish seemed to have similar high and low points.       The star of the meal by far was the presentation. Each dish outdoing the last with an artful presentation worthy of its Michelin stars.  The superb staff took the time to present each course with a full description.       The low points, for me, were the construction of the dishes from a taste standpoint. I felt the main part of each dish wasn't the star, rather just another component in an often convoluted mixture of ingredients. I wont pretend to understand how insanely difficult it is to produce these dishes. The attention to detail is to be praised but I was often over wowed by presentation and underwhelmed by the actual taste.       A couple of gripes shared by the group was the lack of any ambiance. A trace of soft music or maybe a subtle fountain would have given the interior a little ""pulse"" so you are not whispering the whole time. Additionally it was frustrating having to always wait outside the locked restroom because it's a single stall.      A check off the bucket list for sure, but not much else.  Wait staff, restaurant construction and food presentation was off the charts. But for me, at this level, it comes down to the taste of the food which we collectively thought was just eh. Having to spend $$$ afterwords on some food with a little more substance wasn't fun. And finally while gratuity is included in the meal price (totally understand), it left a bitter taste in my mouth that they add 20% gratuity to your drinks?!! We probably would have given it to them anyways but to have it added on felt a little nickel-and-diming...",0.292,0.88,0.063,0.057,0.4947044917257683
2013-08-31,5.0,"One quote comes to mind after having eaten at both Alinea (2013) and The French Laundry (2010) even though I know Chefs Achatz and Keller are friends: ""When I left you, I was but the learner; now *I* am the master.""

Tasting menu (perfect amount of food) with wine pairing (150 option) was exceptional.  Ordered a bottle of champagne which was a great way to start off the evening. Fantastic highly professional yet unstuffy service as well. Best dining experience to date! ***Advice to people with wine pairings who may be worried about small pours:  I truly love the taste of wine especially when paired with superbly tasting food.  As a result, I found myself finishing the wine very early into my dishes and the prompt servers generously provided another small pour.  By the end of the night, I was extremely content without losing my faculties.  I don't know if they do this with everyone, but just wanted to share my wonderful experience.***",0.9938,0.74,0.246,0.014,0.615

2013-08-11,5.0,"""The next time I come back to Chicago, we're eating at Alinea,"" I promised my good friend Kyle a couple of years ago. We made this promise a reality with a reservation to Chef Grant Achatz' famed flagship restaurant earlier this year. I wanted to save review 200 for something special, something that is memorable, unforgettable, indelible.  After reading all the press, his biography and his life story, it became clear that dining at Alinea is a rite of passage for any aspiring food(ie) blogger, writer.  One of America's few three Michelin star establishments, this gem in the Midwest is a once in a lifetime experience.  Operating on an online ticket system, tickets need to be paid for months in advance. Depending on the day of the week and seating time, prices vary based on desirability and peak hours. We went on a Wednesday night and paid $500 per person for dinner, standard wine pairings, tax and tip ($300 for meal, $200 for pairings). I must admit, paying it all in advance made for the greatest dining experience ever.  Not having to wrestle with a giant bill after an amazing meal is priceless.  Not having to fight over it and divvy everything up and being able to mentally and physically digest the sensory overload made the meal all the more special. The experience starts from the second you check in outside the restaurant. You are instructed to enter the restaurant through an unmarked entrance. Once you open the door, you enter a seasonally themed hallway that is meant to dazzle and amaze. yelp.com/biz_photos/alin… We plucked a delicious passion fruit and coriander cotton candy from one of the anthuriums in the hallway.   yelp.com/biz_photos/alin… Once you make your way through, you end up at the hostess stand inside the restaurant next to the kitchen.  This bi-level restaurant is a beautiful contemporary space with great lighting and decor.  Earthy tones and soft light dot the rooms and the setting is complete with the seasonal centerpieces laid out on each table. yelp.com/biz_photos/alin… Upon sitting we received an amuse bouche of osetra caviar with traditional flavorings.  Of course no Alinea dinner is complete without a good dose of molecular gastronomy apparent in the encapsulation of flavors seen here. yelp.com/biz_photos/alin… The next few courses were laid out in front of us and much to my surprise our waiter prefaced the course by reminding me that the fish served will be very familiar (referring to my Hawaiian island roots).  The service here was impeccable and the timing was down to the second. Each course had an amazing amount of scent.  I have never eaten such a complex meal with so many nuances that would amaze and enlighten.  I now see why Chef Achatz is one of the greatest in the world.  The molecular gastronomy doesn't distract or detract from the food, it adds to the experience. In all, the tour was amazing and the requested signed copies were ready for us upon completion of dinner.  Bravo!  See you at Hawaii Food and Wine, Chef. yelp.com/biz_photos/alin…",0.9973,0.832,0.155,0.013,0.49582506613756605

2013-08-07,5.0,"Breath-taking and fantastical, this restaurant embodies all that any upscale restaurant should aspire to be. And with that, I'd like to take you through my magical journey to Alinea from beginning to end.    The 14-course vegan meal started off with a delightful cucumber bite.   Course number two was an unusual salad made with celery root, cherry blossom, smoke, edamame, and wasabi.  Course number three was really when the ""wow"" factor began. As they pulled the cover off the dish, smoke from liquid nitrogen spilled out all over the table creating a misty effect as they exposed an entree made of hollowed out green papaya with lemongrass, citrus aromas, and ""14 textures."" They never really revealed everything in any dish. But the white powdery stuff that had been frozen with nitrogen was made of kelp, coconut, and sea salt and had an amazing oceany taste. Now, we were impressed.   Next, they presented a squash blossom that had been flattened and deep fried so that it looked like a leaf served with cauliflower puffs, saffron sauce, and cotton candy. This small, yet mighty dish presented a taste explosion.   Course number five was when fire was introduced as they brought out a slate of four bites inspired by Tokyo with Binchotan, Japanese charcoal, ignited on the opposite end. This was a dramatic presentation for a sumptuous dish. The four bites were bok choy, watermelon, daikon radish, and rutabaga.  Everything was complex and delicious and although we weren't sure exactly what all the ingredients or flavors were, we knew we were experiencing a culinary journey of a magnitude not yet experienced by either of us.    Course number six had many flavors. There were chanterelle mushrooms in lapsang souchong, a tea whose leaves are dried over smoky pine fire. On the other side of the bowl was a hazelnut crumble with a white cracker and across from that was a white sesame foam with radish. As an added touch, there were pine needles under the bowl to help express the aroma of pine that we experienced while enjoying the dish, going back to Chef's emphasis on aromas.   Course number seven was called ""Hot Potato, Cold Potato."" This one arrived suspended and required us to pull the little metal prong, which allowed the cold potato to fall into the hot black truffle soup and become a hot potato. On top was a sliver of black truffle and a sliver of chive. So amazing.    Course number eight was pretty astonishing and was merely marked as ""Fennel...?????.....!!!!!!!!"" on the menu. This is because there is not enough room to describe this dish. First, we were presented with a plate of five vegetable-based items: salsify, beet, fennel, leek, and parsnip. Then, we were presented with 60 garnishes of which we were advised not to consume them all. We had to randomly choose garnishes to eat with our five main veggies. Wow! This was the most beautiful, astonishing exhibit of food as artwork that I had ever seen. This course was a lot of fun.   Course number nine was a chiffonade of romaine lettuce served with black truffle. I think I sunk into heaven at this point.   I should take a moment to mention how exquisite the service was at Alinea. From the servers to the many sommeliers, they were as attentive and as knowledgeable as they could be. The service truly was top-notch. Next up, ginger with five other flavors. The five flavors were ginger, galangal, blue ginger, turmeric, white ginger, and yellow ginger. These tiny bites were suspended on one of the Crucial Detail pieces made exclusively for this restaurant. It's all in the details. We loved the Madeira paired with this dish. Course number eleven was the one I had been waiting for all night -- the BALLOON. Yes, my friends, they make an edible balloon. It is vegan and it's spectacular. Made of green apple taffy, it is filled with helium and finished off with a cord made also of green apple taffy. A-m-a-z-i-n-g. You put your face up to it, suck a hole in the balloon, and suck the helium out all while laughing with a crazy helium-toned laugh. It was so fun!   Now the sweet courses. Course number twelve was inventive, beautiful, and delicious. It was made with strawberries frozen with liquid nitrogen, sassafras, pine nuts, and sorrel leaves.  Course number thirteen was a drink made of rasberry that we drank through glass tubes that had rose gel and lemon balm inside them. This was so rich.   Lastly, yet another anticipated course. They put a special tablecloth down and covered it with all of the components of the dessert - no dishes needed. The end result was an artistic culinary masterpiece of pate sucree, filled with chocolate and topped with hazelnut dust, violet, and dehydrated basil. Incredibly rich and perfect in every way.  Participatory theater is what they call it. This is the stuff that foodie dreams are made of. For this is truly the most incredible meal we have ever experienced and one by which all meals of this caliber will forever be measured.",0.9985,0.828,0.143,0.029,0.5892504409171075

I noticed Alinea on the list, but didn't pay it much mind. when i was in Chicago in 2010 on business, I tried to book it, but discovered that reservations had to be made months in advance.   Stars:                            5 of 5 Customer Service:     10 of 10 Ambiance:                    9 of 10 Quality of food:            10 of 10 Presentation:              11 of 10 Wine Selection:          10 of 10  With Alinea the reservation process is a little different than most restaurants. You book online at their website 3 or more months in advance by purchasing tickets. Each ticket represents the cost of the food, tax, and gratuity. The wine is purchased at the end of your dining experience. You can also try to buy tickets from others or get last minute deals on their Facebook page.  The first course was served on a spoon, consisting of Osetra Uruguay Caviar that was served with Pierre Gimonnet et Fils 2005 Special Club Premier Cru Blanc de Blancs Brut Chardonnay, a perfect beginning.  Courses continued: Rabbit, Scallops, Dungeness Crab,  the Tokyo Inspiration, Veal cheeks, 60 garnish dinner, on and on.... enjoy ttfn",0.9802,0.891,0.109,0.0,0.5104653679653679

2013-07-11,4.0,"Partial review... Osetra Caviar Pierre Gimonnet 'Blancs des Blancs' Brut NV - A beautifully well-balanced first bite- the bottom of the spoon was crusted with some type of crumb that created a playful crackle to balance the bright pop of the caviar and the jelly component. Rabbit with Cherry Blossom, Radish, Smoke and Wasabi Fritz Haag 'Brauneberger' Riesling Kabinette, Mosel, 2010.-A lovely fresh 3-bite course. The cherry blossom had a gentle aromatic sweetness against the peppery radish and heat of the wasabi. This was also by far my favourite wine of the evening- bright, slightly sweet with a nice balance of acidity.  Scallop with Citrus Aroma, and Fourteen Textures Fritz Haag 'Brauneberger' Riesling Kabinette, Mosel, 2010.-One of my favourite dishes of the night, it arrived as a caldron of seaweed bubbling and smoking from dry ice, upon which a stunning scallop shell was waiting to be opened. The scallop inside was perfectly cooked, sitting atop a pool of citrus orbs and garnished with something frozen by liquid nitrogen, giving it an interesting Styrofoam-like chew (in a really good way). There was also a little chili in there which created a really unique temperature sensation in my mouth- the scallop and everything inside it was smoking ice cold, yet the chili made my tongue tingle with every bite. Really pleasant. Artichoke with Octopus, Eggplant and Allium Lopez de Heredia 'Vina Gravonia' Blanco, Rioja 2003-This was probably my least favourite dish of the evening. I could have licked the plate clean of the Jerusalem artichoke puree and the perfectly caramelized pieces, but I found the octopus a little overcooked and chewy for me. I actually heard another table say the same thing after us. Bincho Tan with Tokyo Inspiration Takatejin Junmal Daiginjo-shu 'Soul of the Sensei' Doi Shuzo, Shizuoka-ken Hitachino Nest White Ale, Kluchi Brewery-A very interesting presentation- this one arrived as a block of wood set ablaze with three unique elements- a deep fried shrimp head, a piece of pork belly and a beautiful square of raw beef. While I wasn't quite able to escape the overwhelming fattiness of the pork (which is beautiful when seared crispy, but a little off-putting when not), the beef was packed with so much rich marbled flavour that literally melted upon hitting my tongue. Veal Cheeks & Crispy Sweetbreads with Spring Bounty Eyrie 'Estate' Pinot Noir Willamette Valley 2010-A masterpiece of textures- I loved the fatty tender cheeks against the light and crispy fried sweetbreads, and that all of the otherwise rich flavours on the plate were tempered by the beautifully prepared spring vegetables. Hot Potato with Cold Potato, Black Truffle & Butter Soup Eyrie 'Estate' Pinot Noir Willamette Valley 2010- A ""time sensitive"" dish, as the server explained- this dish required that we hold the dish carefully in our hand, remove the metal pick and allow the potato and butter to drop into the cold potato soup before taking it all down in a single bite. The result was an explosion of umami-rich truffle and comforting carbohydrate delight in a single two-temp bite. Duck Five Ways with 60 DIY Flavour Accoutrements Chateau Musar, Bekaa Valley Lebanon 2004- You would think for $250+ that we wouldn't have to play chef, but this was part of the fun. The way this worked was that we were given the flavour ""palate"" of 60 appropriate accompaniments to pair with any of the five duck preparations including parts like the breast, and foie. We were not told what anything was, but rather to select any two to smear on top of the bird and to simply use our instincts and senses- everything should work well. My favourite combo of the night? Caramelized banana and candied pecan on foie gras. Least favourite? Mint gelee and broccoli on rillettes. Yikes.  Black Truffle Explosion Ravioli with Romaine and Parmesen Chateau Musar, Bekaa Valley Lebanon 2004- Another dish with specific eating instructions. This one was served in a spoon that we were to bite down on making sure to keep our mouth closed. Why the insistence on chewing with our mouths closed? Well, unlike a traditional solid food ravioli, this one was packed with a light black truffle scented mildly salty broth that literally exploded into every corner of my mouth upon bursting. It was damn good.  Ginger Palate Cleanser Tasting The Rare Wine Co. 'Boston Bual- Special Reserve' Madeira-A very satisfying way to acknowledge the divide between savoury and sweet- each little tiny bite of ginger took on a different flavour profile, that while all equipped with a pretty serious kick of heat, ranged from quite savoury to more sweet. Green Apple Helium Balloon  The Rare Wine Co. 'Boston Bual- Special Reserve' Madeira- Now this was the show stopper. Ladies, just a warning: you are not going to look sexy doing this. Fully enlarged helium balloons were (very carefully) escorted to our table, with their ""string"" tied to a metal needle that could be set in front of us until we we...",0.9991,0.806,0.172,0.022,0.63115815556992

Highlights of our meal - duck 5 ways served with a colorful art piece of 60 garnishes, seafood (smoked fish, raw, marinated), raspberry soda pop, completely edible apple taffy balloon which created many laughs as we kissed the balloon and spoke with our helium voices, hot cold potato, and ultimately the grand dessert in which a chef came out and decorated our table with 2 different sauces before cracking a liquid nitrogen filled chocolate ball of delights onto the table. We passed on the wine pairing but if you are into wine, you should definitely go for it. We watched the table next to ours enjoying their wine and the restaurant is quite generous with their pours.

Boyfriend did the wine pairing which was actually very good, and they were very generous with the pours compared to other similar restaurants (for example L2o where we went few days later) and for a few courses they even asked if he wanted a bit more after he was done!

2013-06-20,4.0,"I really didn't know what to expect of Alinea. I consider myself a ""foodie"" and greatly respect and admire Grant Achatz, but I can't say I didn't fear that Alinea might be the Disney World of Michelin Star restaurants in the worst way possible.  That fear was absolutely unfounded. The atmosphere, service, and presentation at Alinea was far less pretentious than even most 1-star Michelin restaurants I have been to. My best concrete example of this was the horrifically ill-fitting suits that a handful of the servers were wearing. At first it struck me as odd, but on some weird level it made me feel at ease and as if what was really important at Alinea was the food. And the food was, of course, amazing. My favorites definitely included the intensely buttery osetra starter that others have described, the liquid-nitrogen-bathed scallops, and their newer ""table art"" dessert, which involved the table-top assembly of a chocolate tart with meringue, violet, and hazelnut.  Here are my gripes, and the reasons I can't do 5 stars (and what it really boils down to is at this price, I shouldn't have any gripes): -The other customers. Every other table in our room was taking pictures. I do this myself often, and I generally have no problem with it, but there's a time, a place, and a way to do it. Using flash, moving around to get different people in the picture, and taking pictures OF THE WAITERS WHILE THEY ARE EXPLAINING YOUR COURSE does not fall under the category of good picture-taking-ettiquette. I feel like someone would have tactfully said something to these people at other restaurants in this price range.  -The vagueness surrounding the drink pairings. Being a smaller woman and not wanting to drink too much, I asked if half-pours might be possible, and I was met with confusion and insistence that the full pairings were really not that much. Not wanting to put up a fight or do something ""wrong,"" I agreed to full pairings, but my dinner partner still insisted on ""small pours."" They poured the same amounts for both of us, but charged her $50 less when the bill came. The price was really not the issue to begin with it, but the whole thing was just weird.  -While I loved the Hot-Potato-Cold-Potato and Truffle Explosion, I feel like most of these ""classics"" are gimmicky enough that they wouldn't be so great the second (or third, or fourth...) time around.",0.9588,0.788,0.123,0.09,0.5074074074074073

2013-05-15,1.0,"I want to preface by saying I really wanted to like Alinea. The creativity and service are all 5 stars, but food was just a big disappointment. Of all the Michelin star restaurants I've tried, this is the priciest and my least favorite. (Best would probably be 11 Madison) Since everyone here has already raved about the food, I'll just focus on what didn't work for me.  I came in Feb. so walking in you go through a little grove of pine trees and emerge to the restaurant. Simple and chic. They have you wait a little with an amuse/starter of hot chocolate infused with what I can only imagine as the same pine trees that we walked through. My first thoughts were, this is too sweet and I don't particularly like the taste of pine trees with my hot chocolate. Creative, yes. Taste, not at all, it reminded me of Christmas pine scented candles. I pushed that out of my mind as I figured the rest of the meal would be fabulous.   The time we came, the menu seemed to have a lot of Asian influence. One set of the courses was a beautiful tower of water with flowers and ice. They then served a couple of pieces of sashimi fish skewered on lemon grass and two slices of raw scallop. You are to dip in the hot broth that's accompanied with it and there was also a hot stone that you can cook on. Very interactive and fun, but taste wise I was underwhelmed. I've had scallops in many forms, this was two slices that I felt I could have gotten at any nice sushi restaurant. There was a soy dipping sauce for the fish, that was to my liking, but it's also exactly the same thing that my dad makes at home with a whole steamed fish, nothing new here. There was also a fried shrimp head, again, available at any sushi restaurant. To me it wasn't inventive and the flavors has been done, I came here to taste things that I've never tasted before and half the courses ended up being things I can eat on a regular basis at home.  There was also another mushroom dish, the waiter took time to describe it, it's not a common known mushroom, huitlacoche, but again I've had it before, at a street taco stand, the mushroom tasted similar, I was not wowed by street taco mushrooms. There was a mole inspired dish, that was my BF's favorite. That was probably the Mexican theme part of the meal. We also had the duck three ways with the assortment of sauces/sides. This was fun to try and pleasing to the eye, but not delicious as I had hoped. 90% of the sauces were inedible to me and made no sense as something that would pair well with duck, I felt like it's just put on there because it's different. The duck was also not the best. There was foie which I was looking forward to, but it was a small abysmal piece. Gary Danko had the best foie (too bad not anymore).   There was a palate cleanser of ginger. Literally 5 tiny pieces of ginger on metal skewers, the concept failed me, barely half a bite if you put it all together and I didn't like any of the flavors. To me it actually killed my palate because some of the pieces the ginger flavor was just too strong. Dessert was also a fail. It was these three sorbet/ice cream flavors, but all I can remember is that one of them was carrot flavor. And it tasted just like that, cold creamy carrot flavored baby food. Ended with the elaborate show of the frozen chocolate ball and ice cream made on your table. Fun to watch, not fun to eat. The flash freezing of the ice cream didn't create a good mouth texture of the ice cream and also ruined the pieces of cake that was in there as well. The dishes that I actually enjoyed seemed to be some permanent ones. The hot cold potato and the mushroom ravioli. Each one the flavors were  very intense for the small package it came in. I also liked the helium balloon, fun AND delicious.  Overall, left hungry still (BF ended up scarfing down leftover fried chicken and Indian food later that night) and disappointed at the meal we had. Everything was pleasing to the eye, but in the end, we eat with our mouths and the flavors did not live up to their looks.",0.9929,0.784,0.134,0.082,0.5156032703977911

2013-05-06,3.0,"Definitely the Cirque du Soleil of restaurants. Alinea knows how to deliver an experience, that's for sure. Loves: The entry way. It was padded with grass and moss underfoot and lined with suspended flowering glass tubes. Napkins were twisted into flowers and nestled among tropical blooms. Each napkin contained a tuft of passion fruit cotton candy. We were instructed to take a napkin and eat the cotton candy as we entered the restaurant. Next, we were led up a clear staircase to one of the dining rooms (there were three upstairs and at least one downstairs). Osetra Cavier. I can't tell you much about the cavier, but there was a marble sized ball of butter that was crispy on the outside and exploded into liquid butter goodness that flowed amongst the delighted tastebuds in my mouth. Hot Potato. It was a shocking combination of hot and cold. Incredibly rich and indulgent. We both loved it. Black Truffle. It was a ravioli that encased liquid. As you bit into the ravioli pouch the liquid poured out in your mouth. Tuna Tartar. At least I think it was tuna tartar, but the best we've ever had in our lives. There isn't anything on our menu (that was given to us at the end) that seems to describe what we had. Okay: The service was really not that impressive. I expected it to be more attentive and personable based upon other Yelp reviews. We tried to engage our multiple servers but they seemed much more focused upon delivering and explaining our food than creating any sort of impression. I was incredibly cold for most of the meal to the point where I had goose bumps on my bare arms. I often hugged myself for warmth and snuggled back into the cuddly embrace of my chair. If the service was SO attentive I would have expected someone to at least acknowledge my discomfort. Besides, they even forgot to tell us about one of our dishes. In fact, we didn't even notice it was already at our table when we were seated. There were two tall vases of flowers and sticks. At the top were bowls of tuna tartar (described earlier in this review). After we were already served several courses, a server told us not to forget about it. We were like, forget about what? And that's when he pointed to the tall vases of flowers with the bowls on top. The price of everything was expensive. M went in expecting it to be a rip off and came away instead thinking that it was just expensive. Our total bill came to $827.42 for the two of us, wine pairing for just M (not me), a glass of champagne, and a cup of tea for me. Even while we were at the restaurant we thought about other things we could have done with that money. We discussed how there were less expensive restaurants that have delivered dishes that were 100% delicious and service that set the bar. For $827.42 Alinea should have KNOWN that our expectations were high. In the end, we came away only loving three of our 20 courses. Speaking of the 20 courses, I wouldn't have counted them the same way that Alinea did. They counted every dish as its own course. Some dishes were actually served at the same time and I would have counted that all as one course. Furthermore, I wouldn't have counted the tuft of cotton candy as we walked in to be a course. We were surprised that there were large groups of business people who didn't seem to understand the reputation of Alinea. Also, there were a couple parents who came with high school and college age children. It was just really weird to be at such an expensive and reputable restaurant with people who might not appreciate that expense. Alinea certainly was not the best restaurant I've ever experienced. It did not deliver the most delicious dinner. What it was for sure was outstanding presentation and at an exorbitant price.",0.9981,0.829,0.146,0.025,0.5714562289562286

I love change and keeping things interesting, but I'm frankly kind of disappointed with this menu. Was it an amazing meal? Yes, absolutely. Flawless execution, beautiful flavors. Beautiful, but just short of mind blowing. I'm sure there are others who can measure up in this respect, and you are supposed to be a unique experience. This menu just lost some of that feeling of new groundbreaking innovation in the dishes that your name Alinea embodies. Service was absolutely stellar, attentive, friendly. Alinea and Next are the only restaurants I've been to where people actually recognized my dominant hand and placed silverware and dishes accordingly. I had a great time.  Against the backdrop of everyday life, and even against some of my best meal adventures, you're probably a solid five. But unfortunately, my dear Alinea, judging you on the entirely elevated scale you've created for yourself, this spring menu and my experience fell a little short.

2013-04-28,5.0,"Having been to Michelin star spots, I have to say the ambiance, service, and plating at Alinea is the best I've ever had.  I can see why it's so renowned.   Upon walking in you walk through what looks like a haunted house.  They advised our first course  was in this tunnel but I somehow missed it (oh well, 17 others).  We were seated upstairs and the feel is quite different than anywhere else I've been.  They have everything broken into smaller dining room types with 6 or so tables in each and a huge open space in the middle with a server station.  So the four people that are serving that room have a very good interaction with everyone in that little room and the patrons in rooms next to you can't hear the casual conversations in the neighboring rooms.  The result is the feel that you're in someone's formal dining room with one on one interaction with their staff, who of course are more like family.  It surprisingly feels not pretentious since the casual and ongoing rapport with the staff feels more intimate and relaxed.  We also had the sommelier assist us in choosing a half bottle of sparkling and bottle of pinot to go with the meal.  I had read multiple reviews that advised against the pairing since the wines they typically use there are on the low end, despite having a very nice wine list.  We decided to take this advice and I'm happy we did.  The wine selections were outstanding and still less than we would have spent on the pairings.  One noticeable difference from other places with tasting menus is how it doesn't feel like rigid courses.  Because of the outstanding service and cohesiveness of the staff, the courses just felt so much more fluid.  It was not like here is one course, then take away, then wait for 10 minutes.  It felt more like a very smooth show rather than a structured 18 course meal. The menu was amazing.  To put that much thought into their menu, you know this place doesn't miss a thing.  The more to the right the circle is, the more savory the dish and the more to the left the sweeter.  The larger the circle, the larger the course.  And the darker the color, the bolder the flavors.  I was so impressed with this level of detail.  The courses themselves were a bit more hit or miss than the impeccable service.  The menu changes with the availability of ingredients, etc. so no need to focus on all of the individual courses but I did not care for the soda course.  It was a good idea but I did not get the lavender the way I expected to.  Another course I did not care for was the octopus.  I absolutely love octopus but it has to be prepared well to be good (I prefer a long braise followed by a char on the grill).  My husband and I both felt the octopus was a bit chewy unfortunately and the artichokes that were served with them had some flaws in the sense that they entire thing was not edible due to the woody stem.  The presentation of the fish course was the second best presentation I've ever seen but again, the fish was hit or miss.  The scallop was amazing.  I put it on the rock for maybe 5 seconds and put the tender awesomeness in my mouth.  I did not care for the prawn head because it just tasted like fried anything and I would have liked the brains to be tasted.  The high notes were the caviar, the duck course and the chocolate sphere.  That small spoon of caviar was so perfectly balanced and literally the perfect bite.  My husband isn't even a caviar fan and he was hugely impressed.  The duck course...oh the duck course.  Duck is my second favorite meat and I enjoyed all 5 of the duck preparations but mostly the garnishes (40 or so of em).  It was seriously amazing.  Lastly they give you a special tablecloth and a sous chef comes out and starts drawing and making art directly on the table with three different sauces.  The chocolate sphere is in the center of the table.  Now, I had seen the video so I knew what to expect but it was still so cool.  After the table is a masterpiece, they pick up that sphere and just break it all over.  You then eat it directly on the table.  Now that was the best presentation I've ever seen! Overall the creativity of the food was unparalleled, but the flavors themselves were not always there for me.  However with these types of places you're really paying for the experience and you will not find a higher caliber experience anywhere, hands down.",0.9992,0.776,0.179,0.044,0.51072123015873

2013-04-02,3.0,"I've wanted to go to Alinea for some time after hearing and reading so many good things about the restaurant, so when I booked a long weekend to come to town, the next thing after the plane ticket was buying a ticket (you prepay for the meal as well) for a reservation. Even more than a month ahead of time, the only available times were the wings - a little on the early side or later. We ended up coming here at 5:30 PM on Friday, and the room that we dined in was empty at this point. Although most upscale restaurants I've been to tend to usually have stiffer waiters, those that served us all seemed to have decent personality, which is nice. The atmosphere has a rather sparse modern air about it, which fits right in with what they are going for. I can understand why Alinea got 3 Michelin stars from the presentation aspect of it - all of the food is prepared and presented in immaculate fashion, and there are certain aspects - having the snapper tartare floating on top of an tall vase filled with ice water and flowers, serving soup in a wax shell, or covering the entire table with a rubberized tablecloth and preparing dessert ON the table itself - that lend a 'wow' factor. Eating here is a fun experience - a lot more fun than almost anywhere else I've been. But as for the food itself was a bit inconsistent; that is to say, none of the dishes were bad - but I expect to be blown away by nearly every dish at a restaurant of this caliber, and I wasn't, by far. We started with a butterscotch shooter served in a block of ice, which is a solid way to cleanse the palate. Next up was the seafood portion of the meal. I really enjoyed the halibut, which was very flaky but had some Mexican spices and avocado to give it a very interesting flavor. The scallops were also very delicious; you cook the two pieces on hot stones that are provided, and the broth they are marinated in provided a good, Asian-influenced flavor. The shrimp head was okay, if on the salty and slightly spicy side, and the snapper - both the tartare and the poached snapper that cooked in lemongrass broth - were okay, but neither the texture nor the flavors were that memorable. A small interlude of mushroom soup (that cooks on hot rocks that are on fire while you eat other dishes) had a very rich flavor, a tribute to how well the maitake mushrooms were prepared. The small cup of truffle soup was phenomenal, although having to rush to take a shot seemed unnecessary. The two meat dishes were duck and pork; the duck was served 5 ways (foie gras, mousse, breast, shredded, and confit), and you had a choice of 60(!) garnishes. It's great fun and innovative, but I think having that many choices can be overwhelming, and it sucks if you pick a garnish that doesn't go well with your limited amount of each preparation of duck. I also wasn't a huge fan of the mousse, which didn't really have much flavor at all, or the breast, which was a bit on the small side - so you couldn't get the breadth of the smokiness that duck meat is known for. The pork was forgettable, mainly because there were only 2 small cubes, and the sweet garnishes that it was served with overwhelmed the savory characteristics of the meat. The meal ended with a helium-filled balloon made out of apple - which, aside from basically tasting like an apple fruit roll-up, gives you the power of a chipmunk voice if you suck down the helium. Dessert finished up with a chocolate bowl filled with cotton candy and frozen ice cream chunks being loaded with liquid nitrogen and smashed on the table - with various citrus syrups and walnut brownie crumbles decorating the rest of the table. The presentation was great, but the actual dessert didn't really taste like much - it was disappointingly bland. Alinea is very unique in how the food is presented, and on that basis alone, it deserves very high marks. However, I just didn't feel like the food added up to what I feel is the benchmark for great food. There's no dish here that I would absolutely show up for, and while I understand that it's the experience itself that is the emphasis, restaurants, after all, are establishments that serve food. I'd come back again, just because it was a lot of fun and I'd want to see what other food is prepared, but it's nowhere close to the quality of other similarly-rated or priced restaurants that I've been to.",0.9964,0.841,0.118,0.041,0.5287969821673526
2013-04-02,5.0,"I came expecting a lot and was not disappointed. It was by far the most creative, well served and beautiful dinner my wife and I had ever had. Alinea burst the bubble(literally and figuratively) on my molecular gastronomy naiveté. It was also the most expensive so you get what you pay for. I feel like I could write about book about our dining experience at Alinea but given the lopsided profit/effort ratio I'll stick to the highlights. Upon walking in we were transported into a snowy, windy pine forest with blue lights and warmth despite the appearance was cold. Pretty cool. We arrived early and were offered hot chocolate. Not the usual fare of course but chocolate with salt mixed in with a pine foam on top. I never knew this before but I LOVE PINE FOAM. As weird as that sounds. Hot Potato Cold Potato. Like the LOTR MEME I once thought all you could do with Po-ta-toes is ""Boil 'em, mash 'em, stick 'em in a stew"". Well, that and make French fries but Grant Aschatz has openend my eyes to much, much more. Drinking down this truffly mix was a joy. Balloons. I doubt many people considering going here have seen the rocky horror picture show but if you've heard of it you know that at the end they bring out red balloons to de-verginize you for seeing it the first time. I thought that's kind of what was going on here, thankfully not, would have been really weird. This fun snack was comprised of apple fruit leather and helium. You would bite your balloon at the top suck in the air, laugh with a really high pitched sound and enjoy the apple flavor. It's definitely the lightest desert I've ever eaten !Spolier Alert! Don't read if you plan on going!  Explosion. WTF is this guy doing I thought to myself as a Chef walked up to my waterproofed table. Magic I decided as I saw him starting to artistically add lines and dabs of sweet tasting sauces all over the table. It was a great work of art, reminded me of the tricks they have at Hibachi restaurants minus any heat. Biggest surprise came right at the end when what I thought had been a clay jar exploded on our table to reveal chocolate shards, cotton sugar, dry ice and other sweet flavors. Interesting Fact: Did you know Alinea has their dishware made custom for them no other place has it? Yes, that's how they have those dishes with needles sticking out of them, i.e. ginger or Hot/Cold potato. The last dish had a sour note. I went to my car directly in front of Alinea and found a parking ticket. With the valet looking on the whole time could he not have suggested to me that I take his services or have gotten me from inside to pump the meter? I mean, come on. Would I come back?

2013-03-27,5.0,"To make my review short and to the point, let me answer the following questions for you: 1) Is it worth the money? YES 2) Was it a extraordinary experience? YES 3) Do the wine pairing? NO 4) Would I go again? NO unless I became a millionaire in the near future. To further elaborate for those that need more explanation... ALINEA was an awesome experience. I've been wanting to check this place out for the longest time and I thought it was a perfect opportunity when I had a chance to visit my friend in Chicago this past weekend.  I will not go into the details of the dishes since there are plenty of other reviews that do and it will ruin a few surprises of the whole dining experience. For me it was about the whole dining experience that made it worthwhile. If I had to simply describe Alinea, I would say Alinea = Art.  I will admit the food was ok. I mean some of the dishes were divine. Others were mediocre. If you're planning on coming here just for the food maybe you should reconsider. But if you want an overall enjoyable, surprise filled dining experience most definitely come here! I read multiple reviews and had a fairly good idea what to expect and I still loved my experience at Alinea!  As far as the wine pairing... After much deliberation I decided just to go with the standard wine pairing ($150 for 9 pours which equals about 3 glasses of wine... But I think it was more than 3 glasses). The pairing itself was quite good. The wine really did go well with the dishes. But towards the end it just became too much wine. I ended up probably not drinking about half of the amount of wine they give you. And believe me I am a drinker! Although I did enjoy the wine pairing, I would have been perfectly happy with just a glass or two of wine. And the sommelier will most definitely be willing to help you out in your wine selection. So for me I didn't quite think the wine pairing was necessary.  Now would I go back? No... Just because it's a lot of money and with that money I would want to try other expensive restaurants. I would definitely go back if I was a millionaire... But sadly I am not...",0.9962,0.781,0.19,0.029,0.49332573454913886

No refunds you already payed for it so, I guess they really do not care is Grant really that hard up for money that he has to sucker customers by keeping tickets and changing reservation dates?  Any ways back to the evening The tree lined hallway was cool, nifty and a well executed idea; along with the super sweet hot chocolate when they took my coat.  I was seated along with the rest of the party, and offered the drink course with dinner which me and my date for evening declined and ordered a bottle of wine.  Most of the food that came out was okay at best the first course of the Sea Urchin, Toro and the Beef with Vegtable consomme was best dishes of the night.  Rest of dishes were okay not great and clearly forgettable a month or so later.  Now for the dish that has 50 different options to create your own was a great idea but if I ask you what all fifty options are; I expect you to answer me and not just say well it will be on the menu at the end.  Now this is about 3/4 of the way through the meal and I have been tasting my friends drinks that have been with the wine flight pairing and everything has been ungodly sweet, and I am not talking like a little sweet but sugar rush sweet.  So now its down to the grand finale and they do the chocolate explosion with cotton candy, caramel and cookies.  I take a couple bites and really this besides the little mess it made in some Jackson Pollack tribute of a look is just crap.  Hands down I have gotten super market chocolate that has been better.  Here is my advice, go some where else where the front of the house still takes reservations you do not have to buy stupid tickets that people low ball on CL, go to where it is not about name but a true adventure in finding excellent food.  I would say this place deserves the one Mitchlien star but that is it.",0.9949,0.717,0.186,0.098,0.5579982363315695

2013-03-15,5.0,"As my husband and I approach our eventual moving date, we've created a bucket list of experiences unique to Chicago. Of course, Alinea topped that list. Now, we can officially move without regret because we've had the most memorable dinner in our lives that appealed to every sense and surprised us at every stage. Highlights from the approximately 20-course meal: *The grand entrance - Walking over the threshold, we brushed past the spruce trees and faux wind gusts within a narrow hallway to emerge at the host stand/entrance to the kitchen. The host graciously hung up our coats and immediately served us a unique blend of hot cocoa, rich in chocolate with a hint of that woodsy spruce. *More fun than stuffy - With servers who consistently joked and encouraged us to play with our food from the get-go, I appreciated the whimsical nature of the meal. For example, we got to interact with our dishes during the Asian seafood portion of the night by cooking our tender scallop on a hot lava rock, slurping butternut squash soup out of a straw, and munching on a crunchy shrimp head complete with the shell. *Simple and complex at the same time - My favorite course of the whole meal was the tender, juicy duck done four ways with a ginormous platter of unlabeled condiments (ie. pecans, rosemary, mustard) that traditionally go well with duck. The server suggested to combine no more than two condiments at a time and to go with the substances that we did immediately not recognize.  *One-bite bursts- The Hot Potato/Cold Potato shot and Black Truffle explosion in a delicate ravioli were bold and melted instantaneously in my mouth. It was like falling in love at first sight but then your supposed soul mate disappears into the night so quickly  that you don't even get a phone number. *Unexpected, jaw-dropping desserts - When the balloon of green apple taffy came out, I thought I was somehow mistaken for being much younger (expected as an Asian woman). Turns out - it was another dish meant for play. We even got pins to pop the balloon so that we could eat them. But the very final course is what left the most lasting impression: Our server asked for my husband to sit next to me on the bench instead of across from me. Then, a (sous?) chef appeared with a rubber mat that he rolled on to the table, along with bowls of colorful ""paint"" that turned out to be aged cherry vinegar and orange liqueor. Painting in swift motions with the edible liquids, he created a beautiful design across the mat. My husband and I were truly mesmerized. Then, the conclusion to our fairy tale dinner: The artist took what we thought was a brown bowl of nougat and threw it dramatically on the table to reveal that it was actually a thin chocolate shell. It cracked into pieces and released dehydrated coconut. As we swirled our spoons over the mixture, I could not help but squeal with delight. What an awe-inspiring finish! Overall opinion: After seeing this restaurant on the Travel Channel's Bizarre Foods because of its molecular gastronomy and modern presentations, I certainly discovered an adventurous way to eat. Let alone, this was one of the most swanky establishments my husband and I have ever visited. I will never forget this night and will look back at it fondly in my memories of Chicago.",0.9907,0.855,0.115,0.029,0.5033982683982684
2013-03-14,5.0,"Ever since dining at Alinea two weeks ago, I've been thinking about how to approach this Yelp review. Sure, the attention whore in me really wants to be a drop in the bucket of 900 some-odd reviews. But I also want to express and document a surprisingly moving experience. Cue the tissues... I've lived in Lincoln Park for nearly 6 years without knowing that the minimalist grey building on Halsted housed Alinea. But then the cab dropped me off outside its doors, and I thought, ""Duh, this is totes Alinea."" The doorman directed me down a narrow passageway lined with little pine trees. Was there mood lighting, too? There was certainly mood lighting in my head. It was a wintry kind of pretty, and it was strange. Pretty soon, I stood at a pair of stainless steel elevator doors. Just kidding, it's not an elevator. It was just made to look like one. The doors automatically opened up and I was greeted by a hostess on the other side. I said I was meeting a couple of other people that were already there and she motioned me toward my friends standing by the kitchen entrance. By the way, their faces looked like this: :D :D. We were so giddy. Someone promptly took my coat and handed me a cup of frothy hot chocolate.  Still waiting on our other friends, the hostess led us upstairs and to our table. The decor is nice, but objectively quite plain. It's like the dining room of your very rich, but very stuffy friend. The word ""slate"" comes to mind. Our round table seated six, and was set with simple napkins and huge, cylindrical vases filled with purple flowers and ice water. It was extremely pretty, but every detail of Alinea has a purpose and we would come to use the vase later on in the meal. After the rest of our party had arrived and water specifications ordered (oh, don't think you'll be getting ordinary slices of lemon with your water-- instead, expect a tiny pitcher of potent lemon reduction), a waiter gave us a general rundown of how to approach the meal. ""We will tell you the best way,"" and ""some things are time sensitive,"" were emphasized. My table also ordered the traditional wine pairing for $150 per person.  Highlight courses: SCALLOP:  I do not usually like scallops but this was just... succulent. Marinated in tangy Asian flavors and then grilled yourself on a super-hot rock. I could eat this everyday.  SHRIMP HEAD: Don't look at the eyes. Don't look at the eyes. Don't look at the eyes. Oh my God, that is so delicious. The aioli was so creamy and flavorful, dripping down the edge of the glass. One of the ongoing thoughts in my head was that nothing at Alinea tastes like you expect it to, and this dish showed that. ONAGA: Many of my dining companions said this was their favorite course of the night. It floated in a small glass bowl atop of the aforementioned ice water vase. The fish was finely diced and oh-so-smooth. Fatty in the best sense of the word.  HALIBUT: Uh oh, is that mole? I don't like mole. That's what I was thinking when this dish was being explained to me. Then I took a bite, and all of my negative notions of mole went out the window. Deep, even sensual flavors, but far less bold than the moles I am used to. The fish was so tender and that tiny blob of avocado puree is absolutely worth mentioning. I think it was just avocado and salt, but it was evidence of how every single component of Alinea displays the ultimate in execution. Nothing is arbitrary.  DUCK....?????....!!!!!!: Sixty mystery flavors to mix with five preparations of duck. A shining example of how Alinea is unparalleled in using presentation to enhance taste.  ""Mainstay"" courses like the truffle and hot potato were super delicious, but I didn't include them in my highlights because I felt that the flavors were safe. And now I'll say the only critical thing I have to say of Alinea: they played it relatively safe. Yes, with their chocolate explosions and crunchy shrimp heads, I still wanted more. Tasting new flavor combinations is a considerable component of my food enjoyment, particularly if I know I'm hitting up a foodie spot. Push my limits. Make me think, ""I'm not sure if I like this.""  With that being said, I feel an overwhelming sense of gratitude and appreciation for all of the passion and labor that goes into Alinea. I have never seen anything like it.",0.9991,0.804,0.175,0.021,0.5404518154518154

You have at least 3 men taking care of you at once. Our servers were friendly and talkative, maybe because we were too.  I will say the only thing that bothered me was something that happened after we left. Having finished our meal at midnight, my friend who ate with me stated getting violently ill 4 hours later. It was so bad he was rushed to the hospital. Tests were done and he found out he got the NOROVIRUS from Alinea. When he tried to talk to the manager about it he didn't care at all. At all!!! I understand you aren't supposed to take blame for something like this but at least take care of your customer that paid $300 for a meal that made him so sick!!!

At the end of the day, it's how the food tastes that counts and Alinea's food, while decently solid, was not exceptionally good IMHO to justify all the hassle and risks involved in purchasing tickets. Nothing at Alinea really wowed me in terms of flavors other than the fun part or visually appealing presentations or creative ideas. Its Japanese inspired dishes in particular, tend to have seasonings that are way too overpowering as opposed to subtle. If I strip off the fun part of the course, I do not think the food is worth all the trouble I went through. Service left much to be desired. Servers acted like well-trained robots. Yes, they were smiling and efficient (So should I say 'smiling robots' rather?) but I couldn't feel they actually cared about each guest. And the chef who prepared our dessert at the table was extremely unfriendly and brusque. For a place emphasizing 'experience', this kind of poor hospitality annoyed me greatly. For 20% gratuity they automatically charge us, that level of service was not acceptable. But why wouldn't they? There are hundreds of thousands of people eager to dine here after us.

But...there is a but, at least for me. I guess we were not the first wine enthusiasts to visit Alinea and we found it very hard to get through to the Sommelier when asking about the wines. First of all the choices themselves were good, but not excellent (George Breuer Riesling is good but not good enough to be on the ""exclusive list"", same goes for Weinbach ""Clos du Capucins"") and the sommelier who also was our waiter was far from the friendliest person we've met. Instead of engaging in discussion he simply shrugged as if ""couldn't care less"". This is unacceptable at the ""7th best restaurant in the world"". Don't get me wrong, I would give up a lot to have the honor  to visit Alinea again, but after having already visiting some of the other of U.S 3-star restaurants I was left with a slight slight feeling of disappointment.

I had no idea when tickets were going live since it was the first time releasing tickets for August/Sept/October. Luckily, I was able to snag one of their last seatings at 9:30pm because when it rolled out live, I was an hour late (in the shower of course)  after constantly checking online.  Enough of the ticketing system, the experience and staff were awesome and not at all pretentious. Pretty laid back, actually.   As soon as you first walk through the stealth door, to the end where they're handing you the menu,  it was an impeccable time.  Everything was prepared beautifully. Some dishes stood out more than others of course. Sometimes I had to just laugh out loud what they were putting in front of me - almost comical like the wooden plank with algae for the sea urchin/lobster/razor clam dish. My favorites were the Otoro, Brook Trout, the Black Truffle, and the Lamb served three ways.  I felt like a mad scientist trying out the 50+ different sides to play with.  And when would you ever eat a Green Apple Helium balloon?

Is this the most expensive meal I have EVER had? Yes. Do I consider value when I rate a restaurant? Yes. Is this a five-star? No. Alinea has the most creative presentation of any restaurant I had ever been to. I saw other reviewers analogize their food to art and in some ways, I have to agree - but not necessarily in the flavors as much as in the presentation. For example, the helium apple taffy balloon was quite gimmicky but oh so fun. My dessert (chocolate pinata et al.) was presented on the table itself -- allowing me to finger paint with the dessert sauces drizzled directly onto the silicone table cloth. That was fun. Several courses were integrated into the table decor -- and the diner helps prepare the food. It almost felt like a partnership with the chef (if I dare to say so). The presentation of food was 10-stars. Thinking back, I feel like all the flavors are familiar. It's like having a meal of all your favorite flavors from every restaurant compressed into a single experience. Is any of the flavors truly unique? Not really. (I felt that a lot of their courses have Asian influences in the spices they used.) Are the flavors done well? Absolutely. Alinea does a very good re-introduction of everything I had already met. But I didn't meet anything new. My favorite courses are the 60 condiments and the duck foie gras (that was served as part of 4 duck tastings). The 60 condiments were fun and unique. The duck foie gras, they just nailed it in a way I haven't experienced in a while. Same with the snapper tartar served in a floating lily bowl-- again, not new in terms of flavor but they just did it so well and the presentation was wonderful.  I also loved the black truffle explosion -- but I wonder, how much of it is the chef vs. the pure amazingness that is truffles?  It took me over 5 hours to finish the meal because my stomach just couldn't handle all the food at the expected 3 hour pace. (Trust me, I came in with an empty stomach in heavy anticipation of this experience.) It became a bit uncomfortable for me towards the end.

And oh lordy the food was SO good. We were presented with a 13 course meal, and each dish was a surprise. The front of the restaurant is very unassuming - I'm sure there've been people who've walked right by the building and not known the wonders that take place inside. When you walk in, you go through a meandering maze and at the end encounter automatic sliding metal doors. You are then immediately greeted by hostesses and taken to your table.  The food was all amazing. The presentation was mind-blowing. Dishes were fun, quirky, unique, and fun to eat. Waiters were attentive, really take care of you, and explain every dish.  A few dishes that really stood out to me: -Hot chocolate: you are given a little bowl of hot chocolate before you are taken to your table... it was infused with abinao (what is this exactly..?), smoke, and spruce. The hot chocolate had so much depth to it... really new flavors.  -Scallop: it was marinated in mirin and sesame, and you were presented with a burning hot rock on which you cooked your scallop however long you desired. The scallop itself was SO tender and the flavors were absolutely amazing.  -Shrimp head: Now, I'm an avid seafood/sushi lover, and have been presented with shrimp heads multiple times, but have always avoided eating them (I mean... it just looks... weird). However, I took a bite of the shrimp head, which came with aioli, and it was amazing. Bursting with flavor and delightfully crunchy.  -Maitake: O.M.G. I'm not a huge fan of mushrooms, but this was SO good. The dish itself had pumpernickel and black garlic, and the servers poured broth (which had been heated up on your table on a little flame) over the plate. This is arguably my favorite dish of the night.  -Duck: five presentations of duck - duck breast, foie gras, and who knows what else (doesn't matter, it was all amazing). You were also giving 50+ different spices/toppings/amazing-ness on a platter (presentation was absolutely beautiful) to eat with the duck. The servers said there was no pressure to eat all of them, but I pretty much cleaned the platter. The duck was AMAZING. Rich, flavorful, and absolutely delicious.  -Black Truffle explosion: Another favorite of the night... the dumpling literally burst in your mouth and you were literally overwhelmed with intense truffle goodness. Orgasm in the mouth. -Balloon: this one was really fun - a taffy ballon (literally looks like a balloon) made with apple taffy and inflated with helium. I managed to inhale all my helium and sounded like a chipmunk - got a good laugh out of that. -the final dessert presentation: really quirky and fun. To be honest, I was so full by this point that I didn't enjoy it as much as I could have, but it was delicious and probably one of the funnest dishes of the night. There were more dishes, but these were the ones that really stood out to me.  Just a tip: DO NOT take photos with flash - photos are more than welcome (I definitely took like 50 photos), but take a picture with flash and the servers will ask you to turn it off. I wish they told us that at the beginning, especially since I'm sure 99% of the people who visit take pictures, and it'll save everyone the awkwardness of being confronted. So just a heads up.",0.999,0.764,0.198,0.038,0.6608761152775237
2013-02-03,5.0,"Hello, two-hundy review!  I've been saving a little special sumthin-sumthin just for the occasion and her name is Alinea.  She will take you to the stars & back & leave you begging for more.  Oh, please...do not let this magical night end! Wow.  Un-freaking-believable.  I would have been fine having a lobotomy after dining at Alinea so the experience could be my last conscious thought.   There are so many other reviews with so many details I won't delve into many here.  But it was absolutely amazing.  You will be blown away by: -The presentation of the food - unique & unpredictable & fun. -The taste of the food - each course was better than the last, I cannot choose a fave. -If you have a wine tasting you will not be disappointed!  Kevin was our dapper sommelier for the evening & he not only educated us on perfect wine pairing but was also a lot of fun.  I think all the ladies at our table were completely smitten with Kevin & would love for him to tag along (okay...be our date!) at all our special occasions & provide his expertise.  My friend had some wine ""special needs"" & he was very gracious & accommodating while having a good time with it.   -The staff - each person who assisted & presented to us was fabulous.  I love that for such a high-end dining experience there was zero pretentiousness.  These folks know how to treat guests & have a good time while doing so.  Matthew was our lead ""straight man"" but also had a sense of humor.  Andrew was another server who stood out - so informative but lots of fun & whimsy under the business end.  There were many fabulous others & I wish I knew or remembered all their names. -The restaurant decor is elegant & beautiful.  I felt very lucky to dine here in the dead of winter when the entrance/vestibule area was a bit more ""done up"" for the time.  We entered to a narrow winding path of tall, fresh pine trees. It was like walking through the forest at night, the lighting the perfect moonlight glow, the smell of the fresh pine & to top it off, an audio track of whistling winds through the trees.  I was swooning by this first impression. -Worth every penny.  Think of the highly-skilled staff which goes in to creating & presenting your meal.  We were there for four and a half hours and it was the best dinner & a ""show"" I have ever experienced.",0.9989,0.717,0.265,0.018,0.5687042124542124
2013-01-30,5.0,"I don't need to review the food. It's a fixed menu, nothing disappoints. End of story.  What was a big dilemma for me was the wine - pairing menu? By the glass? A couple of bottles? What to do! My one gripe about Alinea is the lack of transparency for the wine program. There is no detail provided about the pairing menu prior to dining, other than the cost of ~$150. From what I gather, this includes 9 or so small pours of wine.  The sommelier was a bit rude when I told him we'd not be doing the wine pairings. After reading many reviews and talking to friends who had been to Alinea before, it seemed it was not worth it. I would have happily spent $300 had I felt it was the right thing to do, but others told me otherwise.  I asked the sommelier about starting with a sparkling, then white, red and finishing with a dessert wine. He quipped that ""That is NOT how our pairing menu is set up"" as if I were trying to knock it off. I ended up letting him choose three wines for us that were from the pairing menu but not offered on the wine list.  The tab came to $77 with tip for 2 people. My glass was never empty, I loved the wine and I spent 1/4 of what we would have on pairings.  In the end, sommelier delivered, despite his curt demeanor at the beginning of the night. The rest of the waitstaff was fantastic, the food was astonishing and fun.  One of the best meals of my life. I'm not dying to repeat it like I was Schwa, but then again Schwa is like having your fun friends make you a badass meal - not a fancy, jackets-required dinner like Alinea.",0.9881,0.819,0.139,0.042,0.33384353741496603

Are you willing to shell out a lot of money for this dining experience? If you didn't answer--nay SHOUT--yes to those three questions, you're setting yourself up for disappointment. Save yourself the pain of getting a reservation, sitting through some awkward waitstaff, and paying out the wazoo.  If you did exuberantly respond, then you will not be disappointed.

2013-01-27,5.0,"Alinea, the 7th best restaurant in the world, changed my life forever.  It is after all the ingenuity of the one and only Grant Achatz.  A 5 star yelp rating does not do this restaurant justice.   Yeah you're eating and drinking at Alinea but you're really crawling in and escaping into an eccentric artist's world for 4 plus mind boggling hours.  You see, smell, taste, touch, interact with, exclaim at, giggle at, and explore the artwork.  You leave amazed and speechless and somewhat befuddled at how a dining experience can be this stirring.  The atmosphere is quiet and the interior décor bleakly minimalistic.  The presence and ambience of the food is so incredibly powerful and poignant that everything else must take a back seat.  The focus after all is the exploratory journey that lies ahead between the food and the diner.  Alinea is quite expensive and the cost of dining here has gone up over the last 2 years.  In 2011, the food cost for a Saturday night dinner was $195/pp for 23 courses.  Now, a Saturday night dinner costs $265/pp for 18 courses.  Figuring tax and tip, its quite clear the cost of dining at Alinea has risen steeply.   Words cannot and will not adequately describe Alinea so this will not be a grandiose review of food.  The combinations of tastes, textures and the presentations are like no other.  Hot Potato and Black Truffle are two venerable dishes that are never removed from the menu.  Any food restriction is accommodated; I heard someone requested and got a gluten free menu. Watching Grant Achatz plate the last course seems like watching abstract artist Jackson Pollock at work. You get ""personalized"" menus which is seriously cool.  My husband has a few food restrictions and his menu listed exactly what he had.   My 2012 dining experience, while extraordinary, was not as evocative as the one in 2011.  Perhaps some of the surprise element went away after the previous dining experience.  I only hope the enormous challenge of running both Alinea and Next doesn't take ever take away from the beguiling Alinea.",0.9894,0.832,0.135,0.033,0.49647435897435904

2013-01-14,5.0,"Hmm... best thing I ever ate?  Check.  Most creative presentation/plating I've ever experienced?  Check.   Just walking into Alinea is an experience in itself.  The door is fairly nondescript, and upon entering, it's a dimly lit tunnel flanked by pine trees.  Not sure if this is just a winter thing or an all year thing, but it definitely gives a ""fell down the rabbit hole"" or ""accidentally walked into Narnia"" type feel. A set of automatic sliding doors leads you into the famed restaurant itself.  To the right is the kitchen where I saw Grant Achatz lording over his kingdom.  We were greeted upon entry with the first course of Hot Chocolate, abinao, smoke, spruce.  What are those things?  Couldn't tell you.   When the hostess asked for the name on our reservation, I was tempted to say, ""Oh, we just wanted to put our name on the list.  How long is the wait?""  Somehow, I restrained myself. Now for the food.  There were many courses and most people have reviewed them in depth, so I'll just mention the ones that really blew me away: -Halibut, mole, avocado, escabeche - holy mother of best thing I ever put in my mouth!  There was a bone marrow accompaniment that gave this dish an unreal level of richness and flavor. -Hot potato, cold potato, black truffle, butter - This was a time-sensitive bite that required dropping the potato and (huge) slice of truffle into the waiting butter sauce and then taken as a shooter.  Um, please sir, can I have some more? -Black truffle explosion, romaine, parmesan - so this is served with a bowl that has no bottom.  Literally, there's a hole that confused me at first as the dark color of the table made me think there was sauce at the bottom I was supposed to scoop up.  This is a single bite of truffle decadence. -Dark chocolate, chestnut, rye, birch syrup - presentation.  If you haven't youtubed a video of this, do it.  Or be surprised because it is one of the most artistic presentations of food I've ever experienced.  It also tastes pretty effing good. Honorable mention is the Lamb .. ..???? ... ...!!!!!!!  The different cuts of lamb are cooked to perfection and it's served with a palette of 60 different flavors for you to play with.   Why the honorable mention?  Well, the palette of flavors looked gorgeous and had some great flavors, but it was a little overwhelming.  And it was hard to try all of them with the lamb.  Still a delicious offering, but didn't make the cut of best thing ever.  #diva. Everything else was delicious and beautifully plated but didn't leave quite the impression that those did. Our servers were excellent and didn't take things too seriously.  It was a very comfortable atmosphere and well worth the price tag. If you want to complain about the ticketing system... well I can't stop you.  But it probably means you're behind the technological times.  It's now much easier and relatively pain-free (besides the hole in wallet) to get a seat at this establishment.   Learn how to use Facebook or Twitter, or pay a kid to monitor it for you.  On second thought, what are you even doing on Yelp if you're that technologically challenged?",0.9988,0.76,0.205,0.035,0.611471193415638
2013-01-12,5.0,"I can't imagine that any review you read here is going to sway one to come here or not.  If you want to go, it's very expensive and you have to pay in adavance. It's all extremely interesting, awesome presentation and very delicious.  The menu changes, but I can give the list of what I got. Hot chocolate while we waited.  Was actually really good. We got blocks of ice that were hollowed out with spices at the bottom.  They poured hot tea in and we drank it out with big straws.  Excellent presentation, decent tea. The next  was a group of sea food.  A leaf that tasted like a clam (weird that it tasted like clam, but good), razor clam - good, lobster claw - excellent and sea urchin with white chocolate and wasabi that was awesome. The next dish was in a fishbowl that was otoro with thai banana, sea salt and lime.  Really cool presentation again and pretty tasty. Then we got a spread of corn.  The presentation was based on the artwork in the dining room.  It was sweet, crunchy, soft and salty all at once.  One of my favorites. After that we got an arctic char, which came out on a two by four with lit charcoal underneath keeping it warm.  The skin was still on and crispy.  Delicious. The next was a potato ball with truffle on top.  It came on a skewer and was good, but didn't blow me away. After that was was a matsutake mushroom with pork, huckleberry and pine.  It came on stones that were under a group of pine needles.  Excellent and I'm not even a huge mushroom fan. Next was a black truffle ravioli.  Awesome.  So delicious.  I could have eaten ten. The next dish was my favorite.  It was three pieces of lamb.  All three were prepared differently and they would not tell us what they were specifically.  Then, they gave the table a tray with about 40 toppings, each one different.  We chose one for each piece of lamb - could have been a sauce, an herb, fruit, etc.  So cool.  Everyone had something different.  Couldn't use all the toppings, but wish I could have. The next was a woodcock dumpling.  It came on a stem with a burning leaf on the end.  The smell of the burning leaf was nice and the dumpling was awesome.  The woodcock was tender and juicy and the skin was thin and crispy. The last dish before dessert was ginger.  We got five metal skewers, each with a piece of ginger prepared in a different way.  I'm not a big ginger fan, but they were all very interesting.  My friend loved ginger and she loved it. The first dessert was the most fun dish of the night.  It was a green apple flavored helium balloon.  Green apple is my favorite candy flavor and this was nice and sticky and chewy.  It was fun to hear everyone talk in the helium voice as we ate. The last dessert had the best presentation.  Two chefs came out and painted a design on the table of sauces and bits of chocolate.  The design, like the corn, was reminiscent of the art on the wall.  In the middle of the table the whole time were two frozen chocolate coconut sized balls.  After designing the table, they smashed the chocolate balls which were full of ice cream and some other goodies.  Awesome presentation and delicious.

2012-12-17,5.0,"A unique gastronomical experience.  I think the presentation of the food actually over shadowed it's taste.  Each dish (dish meaning the actual conveyance of the food) was  specially created for that course.  All the food was fine, but there were only three or four courses that I found to be profoundly good.  But combined with the presentation, the overall effect was superb. Not wanting to try an expensive wine pairing that we possibly would not appreciate, we ordered 3 half bottles (one Sauvignon Blanc and two Chateauneuf  du Papes) that still cost $200, but was considerably less than a wine paring for two at $340.  You even had the option of ordering glasses of wine that would not break the bank. The service was impeccable....informative and attentive but  unobtrusive.    Most people would not routinely pay $600 for dinner for 2.  But for a very special occasion, this is an unforgettable experience.

My only gripe: we decided we didn't want to go for the wine pairings, since we had an insanely early flight the next morning (our reservation was at 9:30pm, and we had to rise for our flight at 4:30) and didn't want to feel hungover in any way.  We did opt for what was described as a ""mini wine pairing"" but only ended up drinking 1 glass of a ""champagne cocktail"" and one glass of a good zin each.  We were a bit surprised when the bill came and was $86.  Nothing was itemized, but doing the math it would appear that these glasses were ~$21/each.  They were good wines but good grief, not THAT good!  They also tacked on an extra service charge which I can only assume was for the wine pouring.  Had we known we'd pay that much for 2 small glasses we'd have just done the full-on wine pairing.  Pretty annoying but I suppose it should be expected in a place like this.  Lesson learned.

The coolest thing about Alinea is that the chef thinks of all senses through which humans experience things. So we get stimulated with beautiful visuals, with smells (pillow), with touch and with audio (boiling soup). The palate becomes only the last sense that gets excited. There is such a richness of detail and creativity that it actually takes a few days to digest it all. I love things that push limits and opens up realms we don't even think exist. This definitely does that and I left feeling like the simple habit of eating can be made a lot more interesting than I though possible.

Wine pairings are insanely expensive and really don't pair well with the seasonless food. One other thing - who serves tomatoes at the end of October? Get it together.  These guys clearly have someone they are paying well for good PR.  One also must ask ones self, is it worth all of the trouble in buying a ticket with no refund? These people actually expect you to pay upfront with tax, tip and gratuity. If you are like me and you didn't care for the experience, then oh well, I am out a 20% gratuity on mediocre service and food. So not worth it people. This restaurant is full of itself and their ticket system is proof positive. On top all this, the ginger, truffle explosion and other dishes have been around for years. This menu needs to change over more often. They pride themselves on seasonal product but how can that be with so many stagnant dishes?  Alinea used to be great.

Alinea is first and foremost one of the cutting edge restaurant in the US and I've been wanting to go for the longest time. They invent flavors I haven't had and actually has woken me up in terms of flavor and texture. The following is what I had: 1) Macintosh Apple Cider 2) Butternut Muscovado, finger lime, West Indies 3) Oyster leaf mignonette 4) Sea Urchin with white chocolate, yuzu, wasabi (top 3) 5) Lobster - trinity, sherry, chervil 6) Top Neck Clam - shiso, soy, daikon 7) Otoro - Thai Banan, sea salt, kaffir lime 8) Corn - huitlacoche, sour cherry, silk 9) Arctic Char - sage, bourbon, upland crest 10) Hot Potato - cold potato, black truffle (top 3) 11) Matsutake mushroom with pork belly, huckleberry, pine 12) Black Truffle explosion - romaine, parmesan (top 3) 13) 3 styles lamb (shoulder, belly, sirloin) with 50 different condiments  14) Woodcock tempura - lingonberry, shallot, oak leaves 15) giner - five other flavors 16) carrot - coconut, white sesame, caramelized honey 17) balloon - helium, green apple 18) Dark chocolate - rye, birch syrup Most of these dishes have really unique characteristic. It's fun but yet focused on flavor. It uses cutting edge technique (the white chocolate, yuzu foam makes me crave more). Black truffle explosion (having the soup explode in your mouth). Although it tastes good and it's a fun meal, it lacks a bit of substances. For me personally, I do crave some meat. or a pasta/risotto dish, where the chef can highlight the use of those ingredients but using cool technique to do it (the lamb was a bad execution in my personal opinion because there's no explanation of the different condiments, but the lamb is good). Also, the lack of dessert (ok..the dark chocolate is cool to look at but the flavor wasn't the best. So not the best way to end the night in terms of flavor). I think that's what is lacking for me. But I can see the bigger picture, the technique, the flavor, the texture. It makes sense but it doesn't. Perhaps that's why they call this a show and not a meal.

2012-11-08,5.0,"So I will have to say that I am a major foodie - I read food articles regularly, I go to new restaurants the first chance I get, I watch every single food tv show, and my sister is a Chef, how could I not be a foodie?? So my expectations for Alinea were enormous. I mean, hell, I even read Life on the Line (by Grant Achatz), and like I was saying, the highest expectations you could have for a restaurant, I had for Alinea. And without spoiling any of the surprises, I will say this was by far the best meal of my entire life. Every single thing you learn about food makes sense once you sit down at this meal. The food was delicious and I was full by the end of the meal (not stuffed, but satisfied). The staff was extremely knowledgable about the wine/food, and incredibly unpretentious, which was unexpected. They tell everyone the proper way to consume the course, and they do it in a way that is fun and quirky and in a completely humble manner.   Wine Pairings is always a question. I got 3 glasses of wine instead of the pairing and my friend got the wine pairing, but at the end of the meal we decided if we were to come back we would just buy a nice bottle of wine for $100 instead of doing the whole wine pairing thing, just because 1) you don't get that much wine (3 glasses total - 9 small pours), and 2) there's not really anything super extraordinary about the wine unless you guys are really REALLY knowledgeable about it. One thing I will say though, is maybe do a sparking wine during the first few courses, and then when the main meal comes out switch to a red wine. I believe they offer half bottles, so if you guys wanted to do two half bottles (one sparkling in the beginning, and 1 red in the middle) that would be a good option too. In my opinion, the reserve pairings are definitely not worth it because it is significantly pricier and you only get 3 different pours from the original 9, so my friends were disappointed when they chose that option. But all in all, a great fabulous meal that really brings out all of your senses, literally. I can't wait to go back =)",0.9918,0.831,0.136,0.032,0.5139118778824662

Big fan of fine dining and new American but this was over the top. The hot potato / cold potato dish was probably good but I burned my mouth - badly. The waiter was very insistent that it was time sensitive and must be taken in one bite. Then you should warn patrons there is something really HOT in that little wax sphere on which sits the ""course"". My mouth was still feeling the effects the next day.

Best bite on the menu: Truffle explosion. Though this too was touted as a shooter and must be taken in one bite quickly as it explodes. Delicious - just wish the best part of the meal could be savored. Service: Pretentious as a 20% tip is required and pre-paid. That's right. Tip is pre-paid. I always tip above and beyond for service but pre-paying makes it a salary not to insure proper service. Dessert: Final course is served off a sheet of rubber. That they reuse.

The attitude of the wait staff reminds me of some throwback to the 1950's....in a time when other diners were to be seen and not heard.   We made friends with the people dining next to us (visiting from California), and were rudely interrupted by the wait staff on multiple occasions, a favorite of which was when the waiter literally stepped between our conversation mid-sentence and proceeded to top-up our half full water glasses - an unnecessary task that could have been achieved from the other side of the table without interrupting the conversation. How subtle. Then, towards the end of our meal our new friends from California asked that I take their photograph with their Canon DSLR (I have the same camera and do some amateur travel photography).  When I stood up to take their photograph, the wait staff literally ripped the camera from my hands and insisted that they take the photograph.

It's impossible to pick a favorite, but the two that stand out most vividly for me are the black truffle explosion and the finale dessert course (where a chef comes out and plates dessert on the special tablecloth they've just placed on your table). Service here was also impeccable. I made my reservation at Alinea for the same evening that I was flying into Chicago. Unluckily for me, my flight was late. I called them as I was en route in a cab and they were super understanding about my predicament, tucking my suitcase away nicely upon my arrival. I was dining solo for the night and was impressed with how well timed the courses were. A course would get cleared away and I wouldn't get more than about 2-3 pages into my magazine before the next course arrived!  At the end, they give you a copy of the tasting menu. I asked if Chef would sign it, which they readily agreed to.

2012-10-23,5.0,"There isn't much to say about Alinea that hasn't already been said. There is a mountain of praise here (and elsewhere) for just about every course of food that has been served here over the years. I almost wanted to find something wrong with it, to find that misstep that would prove Alinea's continued success was only a result of its fame. But I couldn't. This place isn't Next (it's nothing like it), despite the thousands of people fawning over Grant Achatz's every move, rarely mentioning one restaurant without the other, and lining up around the block to get a table at either one. The cuisine here is the real deal, seriously innovative and genuinely delicious. Some places have one or the other, but Alinea has both and it pushes both to the limits throughout the course of your meal. And ""meal"" is a term that should be used loosely, as the Alinea experience is one of bites and tastes, both small and large, spread over a long period of time and a variety of elaborate presentations. Some of the bites were interesting and challenging, some were comforting and simply tasted great. I will always remember Hot Potato Cold Potato, Black Truffle Explosion, and the Blueberry/Sorrel dessert that preceded the final dessert presentation on the silicone mat. It's a big deal and a very costly expense to eat dinner here. It's by far the most expensive meal we've ever eaten and I don't think it will ever be topped in that respect. For that reason, and for the uniqueness of the experience, I doubt we will ever be back. Once was enough.

2012-10-19,5.0,"One of the best tasting, most interesting, and interactive meals I've ever had.  If you are looking or an experience, look no further than Alinea. There's no way I can describe each course without writing several pages. I was blown away and just had a great time with my company at dinner as well as with the staff. They were very accommodating. They replaced my glass of wine after I didn't particularly appreciate the recommendation. They offered my company an interesting beer in place of wine, that we have grown to enjoy outside of the restaurant.  I enjoyed every course, even the foods that I normally would not order or eat myself elsewhere. I had to give them a try at Alinea and I was astounded at the flavor (such as oysters, I've tried them elsewhere and still shiver every time it shoot one). I was having dinner with a vegetarian (not a real vegetarian, they condone eating meat, they just don't like the flavor). Well not at Alinea, the meat dishes were even tasty to my company who doesn't usually appreciate the carnivore style.  I will say I thoroughly enjoyed the truffle ravioli. My mouth still salivates thinking about the one single ravioli bursting with truffle flavor. It's such a tease that they only give you one. I also very much enjoyed the pine/pillow dish with the fine and delicate sent of pine seeping from the pillow as you ate. Last, I had to so much fun with the helium filled balloon. Who wouldn't? It lets your inner child out to play. While I have only mentioned three dishes, as I write I am contently thinking of the others and trying to compare and choose the best dish, which is impossible.  My one request, please stop with the ticket process and go back to the original reservation style.",0.987,0.789,0.156,0.055,0.4853422619047619

As they opened the front doors, they told us to grab a glass of lemonade to refresh. ""You'll find a place to put your finished glasses when you're done."" Once inside, the doors closed and we were in a poorly lit hallway. To our left, was a level but moving water feature with stemless glasses filled with lemonade. No sight; just aroma, taste, and sound of water and clinking.  By the time we finished, we found an area to deposit our glasses. Two doors opened Star Trek enterprise style, revealing a gentleman, waiting to take us to our tables.   No tablecloths here. Sturdy black wooden tables.  Alinea is unlike any other restaurant in America. And more so than any other restaurant in America, this will evoke memories and emotions like no other. Some dishes will make you recall childhood memories. Or specific times or locations. Some dishes will make you regress and make you clap like a five-year old. Some dishes will literally make your head scratch. Others will make you talk in a high-pitched voice. Seriously. Most of these dishes require specific instructions. On how to eat or how to operate the apparatus. This meal makes you think about how one eats.  STEELHEAD ROE, peach, St. Germain, kinome A dish whose vehicle involves glass straws and a block of ice.

CORN, huitlacoche, sour cherry, silk Corn as filaments and rocks.  OTORO, thai banana, sea salt, kaffir lime Immerse your face in a dome-shaped dish and smell Thailand. CHANTERELLE, ramps, asparagus, smoked date Eat off of a bed of warm rocks that lie on a scorched and smoking wood.   HOT POTATO, cold potato, black truffle, butter A ""time-sensitive dish"" that is a shock of temperatures, tastes, and textures. LAMB ...?????....!!!!!!! Three preparations of lamb and 60 garnishes; choose our own adventure. BLACK TRUFFLE, explosion, romaine, parmesan A spoon-sized bite that seems to transform from solid to liquid to gas in an instant.

2012-10-13,3.0,"I realize I am probably a minority among the reviewers to only give Alinea 3 stars, but the experience of acquiring reservations was a complete turn-off.   I have to admit that I consider myself to be a dedicated foodie.  I love to eat at fine restaurants and cook for hours.  I have gone to great lengths for both.  I wanted to go to a restaurant in Frederick, MD that serves 24 courses.  I had to wait 18 months to get a reservation on a Saturday night, but it only took one phone call.  For the most part, Alinea forces you to make multiple efforts to get in. My husband and I decided to go to Chicago in September 2012, and we started planning the trip in July 2012.  I knew how well-rated Alinea was, and I was eager to have dinner there.  My step son raved about the restaurant, and he gave us their cookbook.   First, I learned that they were switching from a reservation to a ticketing system, but no one could say when it would happen.  I made several phone calls to the restaurant, and no one knew when the tickets for September would be released.  I had to get on Facebook and ""like"" their web site to look for updates.  I called the concierge at the hotel where we'd be staying, and they directed me to Facebook and Twitter.  I sent emails to Alinea with pleas that we would only be in town for a few days, and it was clear that the responder did not care. Eventually, both my husband and I acquired Twitter accounts, which were not user-friendly nor of any interest to us (other than gaining tickets to Alinea).  I never did figure out how to set it up so I would get the tweets on my Iphone, but my husband did.  After several weeks of checking their web site, Facebook, and the incoming tweets, they revealed that the tickets for September would be released. So I immediately went online.  You have to set up an account in advance with your credit card information.   You also have to use the correct browser, like Firefox.  They don't like Explorer.  Then you have to select the number in your party - I think they only take 2, 4 or 6 people.  Of course, you pick the date and time.  And if you have to cancel, you are out of luck and will lose your money unless you can transfer your tickets to someone else.  Oh, and it was about $300/person. Was the food creative, tasty, labor-intensive and very interesting?  Absolutely!  But the whole experience of getting tickets was a huge turn-off.  I really believe their chef has become too comfortable with his restaurant and not concerned with the customer experience.  When he personally brought out his dessert and prepared it in front of us, he didn't even smile or graciously respond to my recognizing who he was.   I would only recommend it for true foodies who will absolutely jump through several hoops to get into this place.",0.9959,0.817,0.144,0.039,0.542816091954023

I also got in trouble for taking pictures with a flash. So don't do that. We also had a non- alcoholic drink paring that was great.

The presentation was outstanding and very unique. There's a story behind each course and the props supported each story. Another great thing about this particular dining experience is that it was fun. You could play with your food and eat it. Watching others enjoy the helium experience with the green apple balloon was hilarious. Since I was on antibiotics and my partner in crime for the evening was not drinking, we were able to keep our meal under $300/person. Yes, this is rather expensive, but it is well worth it.

2012-09-22,5.0,"Unlike Next, which we'd eaten at the previous night, where each dish is completely recognizable but notable for being the best possible incarnation of itself, Alinea delivers a meal created by Willy Wonka, with all the rules thrown out the window. I won't recount every course, just highlight the dishes that made me laugh, or let me know this was a restaurant like no other, a place where there were no rules that had to be followed, a sanctuary which allowed a chef freedom to go wherever imagination led. For example, while the beverage choices were explained, six bowls containing blocks of ice resting on beds of pebbles were placed on the table, without a word being said about what they were for. Each block had a hole drilled in the center, and once we'd made our decisions about what we'd be drinking, servers then came to the table with glass straws filled with steelhead roe in a liquid and stoppered at either end with foam. We were instructed to take our straws, fit them into the perfectly sized hole, now filled with ice melt, and inhale the mixture in a single slurp as quickly and as loudly as we could. The frigid rush of roe and herbs and peach (I'm unsure whether that fruit flavor came from the straw or the melt) was sweet and salty and made us giggle, a perfect start to the most unusual meal of my life. For Lamb 86, we were each presented with a narrow plate containing three perfect pieces of lamb, each prepared in a different manner, and two plexiglas shields were placed in the center of the table, each with 86 different garnishes, none of them identified, but all, we were promised, fitting accompaniments to the lamb. I cut the three tender servings into three smaller pieces so I could experience more of the flavor combinations, and the table turned into a guessing game as we each plucked the sides that tempted us and tried to identify what we'd chosen. Not every course was as unusual in its presentation as that. Some courses astonished with their perfection alone. Hot Potato, Cold Potato, which we were told was one of the oldest courses that still remained on the Alinea menu, consisted of a paraffin bowl filled with cold potato soup, while a hot potato and a piece of truffle were held aloft by a skewer which went through the lip of the bowl. We were to pull the pin, and the moment the two ingredients met, we were to toss it back, so the soup had no time to warm, the potato no time to chill, and the two flavors and temperatures only came together on the tongue. Then there was the Black Truffle Explosion, which was served on a spoon, and to be chewed with closed lips, so none of the delectable juice escaped. These awed not by the science fictional nature of their presentations, but from the precise combination of their ingredients, eaten at exactly the right moment. One course that makes clear why a dish must be eaten when served is the green apple helium balloon, which if not ingested upon delivery, would, I fear, end up collapsing upon itself before eaten. The skin of the balloon as well as the string with which we held it were both made of apply taffy, and we were told to press our lips against the balloon, take a bite, and inhale. My mouth filled immediately with the intense flavor of apple--and with helium as well, of course--so we were all soon talking about how amazing it tasted while sounding like Mickey and Minnie Mouse. For our final course, the table was cleared, and we were asked to lift our glasses as a silicone covering was rolled out. Servers then brought many small bowls, two metal jugs sweating with condensation, and three white globes with circular holes in their tops. Then two chefs arrived, and began spooning out the contents of the bowls onto the table, scattering them like culinary Jackson Pollacks as they identified each--freeze-dried strawberry, English pea, buttermilk cream, and so on. Then the chefs each lifted a jug and announced, ""liquid nitrogen,"" and poured the contents into the white globes, which caused a fog to rise and cover the table. Finally, the chefs lifted the globes, which were made of white chocolate, and smashed them upon the table, revealing the goodies within--meringues, cotton candy, miniature jelly donuts, condensed honeydew melon, and more. After which we took our spoons and attacked, not making as much of a dent as the creation deserved. At meal's end, we stepped out of the restaurant ... four hours and thirty-nine minutes after we had arrived. Yes. The meal took four hours and thirty-nine minutes. But I assure you that it did not feel as if that much time had passed, because ... oh, I'm going to go into cliche mode now, but you know how it's sometimes said that time stood still? Well, time didn't stand still, per se, but ... let's just say that while we were in Alinea, it didn't exist.

I think everyone has a unique experience with the food - ingredients and presentation - but two things I'll highlight about my personal experience are: 1) This was an amazingly vegetarian friendly place for the experience. After you've bought a ticket, they'll call to ask a few days ahead of the reservation about any dietary restrictions and that's when they record vegetarian. I didn't feel that we missed out on even an ounce of the experience that non-vegetarians have. in fact, I admire the kitchen's ability to do such a great job with it!  2) this place is very unique and of course, expensive, but not a single staff member here was pretentious or stiff - they took a lot of pride in what they do but in a natural friendly way (the American way as my dining partner put it).

2012-09-08,5.0,"Overall, was it worth the hype? Yes and more. Was it worth every penny? Hell yes! Is it a life changing food experience? Yes! Will I be coming back? You bet! Soon? Probably not, it definitely broke the bank and I'd also like to see a different menu. Truly 5-star experience. I was able to snag a 2-top ticket from their new ticketing system, which isn't hard to obtain as long as you follow them on Facebook or twitter and you check fairly regularly. The meal at the end of the day ran me nearly $1000, which I will say without hesitation was the best $1000 I've ever spent. Everything from the food, wine pairing, service (sort of), atmosphere, was everything you paid for and more.  They only have a prix-fixe menu of 15-17 items, mostly all of them were excellent. They all emphasized the pure flavors of the ingredients such as the corn  as well as the tomato  (both fantastic and one our favorites). Other courses emphasized the subtleties and complementary flavors such as the chanterelle (probably our favorite of the evening). Other items were shock and awe like the lamb with 52 different complementary ingredients, which was fun and interactive (good but by far not the best dish) and the apple balloon with edible string (by far the most fun dish). Other courses emphasized a whole new experience, like the black truffle explosion and the white chocolate dessert made table-side by the chef. Even after 2-plus weeks after eating there, there were a lot of items that I still remember every aspect, this was truly a life-changing meal.  Other aspects of the restaurant like the decor itself was nice and dimly lit. The service overall was flawless, but some of the staff was not very friendly and a little stuck-up. Our main server however was fairly interactive and friendly. The kitchen tour was amazing as well, spotless and got a chance to do one of our courses prepared on the spot. Though we did not get to meet Chef Achatz, his current chef there was friendly, articulate, and still producing magnificent food. I would certainly like to see him open his own restaurant in the future.  If you made it this far in my review and probably others, just do yourself a favor and just grab a ticket and a date and eat here. You won't regret it. **One additional note here** After eating at Charlie Trotter's about a month before and paying nearly $500 per person with wine. Trotter's didn't come anywhere near to what Alinea produced in terms of experience and food. Although, the wine pairings there were superior.",0.9971,0.772,0.193,0.035,0.509842479924447
2012-09-06,3.0,"The problem with places like this, given the exhorbitant cost, media attention, and stellar reviews, is that the bar is set so high, it's nearly impossible to meet those expectations. To set expectations, the meal, including wine pairing, totaled $564 per person in our party of 6. Now, I'm no stranger to spending a lot on fine dining- The French Laundry, Benu, Daniel, Cyrus, and the Bazaar were all extravagant and decadent dining experiences I've been fortunate to enough to try. I felt each of them offered something in the way of transcendent flavors, over the top service, and/or that little something extra to justify the value proposition. All in all, I felt Alinea failed to provide that value. Were the dishes innovative and unique? Yes. Was presentation whimsical, playful, and imaginative? Yes. Was service attentive and informed? Yes.  However, was the experience as a whole better than others in this class? No. Was it worth it? NO. Maybe this comes down to personal preference. I'm more a fan of precise, classic plating techniques over the Jackson Pollock style presentation I found on most of the dishes here. Dessert was *SPOILER ALERT* served by Grant Achatz himself LITERALLY shattering a filled white chocolate egg all over our (nicely prepared) table. We were then given spoons. I also had issue with the distinct lack of traditional luxury ingredients. I understand the idea behind creative and non-traditional use of ingredients. But for my money, I'd rather have a nice scoop of caviar rather than a crazy, what-am-I-eating composition of discarded corn products (corn silk, corn smut [huitlacoche], and corn husk). Indeed, the waiter rather cheerfuly informed us that yes, in fact, we were eating trash! The myriad rules and regulations were also off-putting. Buy your ticket online. Wear a jacket. Show up 30 minutes prior to your reservation. Eat this dish in 5 seconds before it decomposes in your hands. Despite the whimsy of the dishes, I felt that the place, the whole experience, simply took itself too seriously.

2012-08-30,5.0,"Despite the first-world tragedy I endured in an effort to get reservations (see my first review for details), I did miraculously manage to secure a table for my party of four. The short version: It was whimsical. It was innovative. It was the best meal of my life. The long version: There is a moment of anxiety and excitement before dining at Alinea. You've heard the stories, or maybe you've read up on molecular gastronomy. Then you arrive and the doorman gestures toward a dark, Willy Wonka-esque hallway that gets more narrow with each step. You think you've hit a dead end when, seemingly out of nowhere, a door slides gracefully open. As you gaze upon the host's smiling face, you realize: that moment outside wasn't a moment after all. This feeling is going to last as long as your dining experience does. And so, it begins. Each course will come out, meticulously plated, with an experienced and friendly waiter right beside you, explaining how to eat what's been set forth in front of you. Without giving away too many specifics of the ever-changing menu, I will say you're likely to find yourself sucking up one course through a test tube, kissing another, eating one course without any hands, and another directly off the table. Intrigued? Then I'll continue! Should you choose to do wine pairings with each course, which I strongly recommend, the sommelier will pour you a smorgasbord of varietals, including a few you've probably never heard of before (ie: Zibibbo). With each pour, there will be an accompanying story about where the wine came from, and why the flavors within make it the perfect pairing. Overall: Grant Achatz's progressive style of cuisine is pure genius, and the experience is joyous and genuinely enchanting. For better or worse, I guarantee you will leave with a new perspective on the unbounded future of the culinary arts. I hope to someday return to Chicago and do it all over again!

2012-08-30,5.0,"First, let me start by saying that it took me two years (at 20 a paycheck- my favorite way to save for restaurant experiences) to save up for my trip to Alinea. Ever since I found out that the best restaurant in the U.S. was in my favorite city, I knew I needed to go. This was my third Michelin starred restaurant, but my first three star, and it did not disappoint. I found securing the reservations through the ticketing system to be quite simple, and am hoping other restaurants of this caliber switch to this method in the future.  My night at Alinea was perfection from the moment it began- from the gentlemen helping me out of my cab, to the few minutes I got to spend watching the kitchen work, and of course the food and the service. I'm not going to write a review explaining the food, but I did enjoy every course. There were certainly some I preferred over others, but  nothing was bad or even close to bad. I agree with other reviewers that for several of the courses I wanted more than one bite, though I was definitely full at the end of the meal. My boyfriend and I did have the wine pairings with the dinner, and that is the only thing I regret. Neither of us are huge wine people, and therefore it was really too much wine for me. If I were to go again, I would probably do a bottle to share instead or try a few glasses from the pairing (if they do that, I did not ask). I did not love all 10 pairings, but enjoyed 9 of the 10.  My favorite part of Alinea, besides the food of course, was admiring all of the beautiful pieces that were created to serve the food at this restaurant. Brilliant minds established this place, and everything about the design was perfect down to the smallest detail. I found the service to be excellent for my table, and all of the courses were well explained. We also had fun asking questions of the staff, and they had all sorts of fun stories and great laughs which added to our meal.

My friend is a vegetarian. They prepared special menus for both.  Now to the food. Some courses were delicious others were ok. Everything was too small. Even if u liked it was gone in 3 bites. Even though there were so many courses we left hungry & went out afterwards. 2 of my friends are foodies & have been to very elite restaurants.  Also, I do not have a need to be stuffed after eating out, but I do want to be satisfied.  I was neither which was disappointing considering the price tag. The atmosphere was quiet. Was good girls night out. Dessert was huge disappointment. Dippin dots spread all over table. Price in my opinion not worth it. The biggest irritation was the champaign @ beginning of meal was brought out though we did not request it. I assumed it was complimentary. However it turned out to be $100 each.

I'll spend my time here throwing out some general impressions, in no particular order. Enjoy! - Book (buy tickets) way, way, way in advance. This place is booked for at least two months out. - Mental prep - don't over-hype this place before your first visit. Like most other fine dining restaurants, this place is very, very good. However, if you keep thinking this is supposed to be the #1 rated restaurant in the U.S., you're likely to leave disappointed (like my wife and I). - Dinner for the 6 of us took over 6 hours to complete. Make sure you go with fun, good company. Even for couples...it's hard to have a 3-hour dinner together...we saw many bored couples that didn't talk. - Dress nice. Real nice. 'nuff said. - Don't go cheap here. If you are already spending this much on dinner, might as well get the wine pairing (if you like to drink different kinds of wine). Or, if you're like us and don't drink that much, just get a bottle. Expect to spend about $800 - $1,000 for two people.  - The food profiles are innovative and presentation was visually stunning. It takes a true genise to come up with each course. However, my wife and I were only ""knock our socks off wowed"" by just a few courses. We particularly liked the razor clams, crab, and mushrooms served on heated stones. - Service - it's nice, but less formal / attentive than what I would expect at a place like this. Not that we enjoy a place that is super formal and stuffy, but it felt a bit too casual for us.  - We also would have appreciated a bit more explanation of what we are eating before each course. Our waiter just didn't know or wanted to spend the time to explain. In fact, it was a bit annoying that he wants us to guess what we were eating. Really annoying, now that I think about it again. We paid good money to eat there, show an effort to explain things. - Just to be clear, none of the courses tasted bad. We were just looking to be wowed by each course...and it didn't happen. - Dessert - while seeing them prepare it in front of us was cool, it really wasn't that complex and the taste was a bit disappointing.  - Valet - it's only $11, do it. It's a nice touch that they already have the car pulled up front waiting for you by the time you walk out the door.",0.9824,0.797,0.136,0.066,0.5849475890985324

But this VIP treatment also has a wonderful comfortableness about it. It doesn't feel stuffy. We ended up chatting with the table next to us because it was just too fun.

2012-08-22,5.0,"I did not know what to expect from this restaurant - I've heard that the restaurant itself looks like any other 'ordinary' building, without the name blazing about. They have valet, but you can find parking a few blocks away (non-permit). You enter the restaurant, and you walk down a short corridor that has purple lighting, and enter to your left. You are greeted by literally 5-7 men, dressed in suits, asking you the same question - 'How are you doing this evening?' We were seated in the dining area on the ground level, a booth with some comfortable cushions. The waitstaff seems very particular in the placement of your beverages, and cleans up with a damp towel of any morsel or droplet of liquid that gets on the surface of the table. I tried the Green Tea/Grapefruit/Lavender, which was like a grapefruit sparking soda, with a hint of ginger. My cousin had the Ginger Citrus, which tasted literally like a strong ginger ale beverage (definitely better than the one at Wow Bao's). We had the Tasting Menu, and I expected probably a small morsel of everything, but I was actually surprised with the amount that they give you for each plate. We first started off with the English Pea, and it tasted like green pea ice cream - slightly thick and creamy, and it was quite nice. The next was the Shad Roe, which tasted like a bacon tempura ball with a twig of bay leaves used as a skewer. The Distillation was a wine glass of Thai liquid, which was the least favorite of the dishes - it tasted like red pepper flakes with a hint of floral. The Pork Belly, which was my favorite of of them all, was in making your own spring roll with this rice paper that has beautiful little flowers within, and the restaurant presents you a glass platter of different ingredients that you build with - the braised pork was just delicious!!! The next dish we had was the Sturgeon, which were cubes of sturgeons with leek and croutons - great creamy sauce with smoked apple ribbon running across. Next was a cute little 3-part bowl with different tempered-Jonah Crab - it contained lobster mousse, king crab with crusted avocado, star anise bubble (which tasted creamy and black licorice-like). We had an offer of a glass of Sassporillo - really strong orange-colored root beer (not a fan of it). The next plate was the Filet de Boeuf, presented as a clock set-up, with little spoonfuls beef tongue (which was my absolute favorite since it was so awesome), duck was bleh, wagyu beef was kind of soft chewy, the panko too overly fried, the mushroom was just like a wet mushroom, cocksical (from the rooster) was gelatin-like - interesting experience. Next dish was the Duck, with cubes of duck with mushrooms, a cylindrical foie gras encrusted in dehydrated orange. Next was a spoonful of truffle ravioli - liquid 'explosion' of truffle inside. Next was the Earl Grey, the plate being set upon a fragrant Earl Grey pillow - the plate itself contained rounds of lemon curds with Earl Grey graham bits and a hint of rose water throughout. Next was a Chocolate dish, a trio of chocolate - chewy white bits, menthol, pudding, and several coral-like frozen chocolate at the end. As an extra treat, the restaurant gave us a ball of chocolate with melting cream (which was heavenly and good for the chocolate buffs). Our last dish was the Bubble Gum, which was a glass test tube-like filled with long pepper, hibiscus, and creme fraiche - I liked the bubble gum-flavored tapioca balls. The whole experience took about 3 hours, and be sure to ask the waitstaff if you could take a tour of the kitchen - it's cool to see a behind-the-scenes look at each of the carefully-made dish. You get a copy of the menu with explanations of the circles at the end of your meal as a 'souvenir.' Overall, I'm glad I had a chance to experience a restaurant that's rated as one of the top restaurants in the world, and the fact that it was located in Chicago! If I had all the money in the world, I would probably dine here everyday. It's quite interesting to get an attentive service like this, and enjoying the beautifully-presented food that actually tastes good as well! +Yay for this restaurant getting 3 Michelin stars - Chef Achatz totally deserves it!",0.999,0.817,0.168,0.015,0.4796897546897548
2012-08-21,5.0,"So, we were fortunate enough to score Sunday dinner reservations after the restaurant moved from its phone-based reservation system to the 'Next-like online ticketing system.  I can honesty say that this was the pinnacle of dining experiences for me - that every fine dining establishment from this point forward will be judged against my experience.  I'm not sure if this is fair, because Grant Achatz and team set an insanely high bar.   Prior to dining at Alinea, literally an hour before, I finished reading Grant and Nick's autobiography 'Life on the Line'.  I appreciated having the insight into the creative passion and love for food that drives Alinea staff.  I'm also slated for a trip to San Francisco in the Fall and am very much looking forward to scoring (hopefully) reservations at The French Laundry, which had a huge influence on Chef Achatz.  Fingers crossed that my redial finger make it through to the reservationists.   Back to Alinea -  We're not going course-by-course in this review, as I agree with many other Yelpers, that just simply ruins the experience.  Although, I'm guessing that the Fall menu isn't too far from around the corner, which has me eager to go back for sure.  From the time you check-in with the doorman to the moment you step through into the darkened, wedge-like hallway, your dinner begins and it doesn't stop for almost four hours.  Every detail is meticulously considered and it shows - at the time I confirmed our reservations and any dietary restrictions or other notes of importance for the staff, I did not notify them that my other half was left handed.  I didn't realize that was even a reason to make a special note, but at Alinea it is.  Once they realized he was left handed, every course was situated and placed correctly in front of him.   I know for some the ticketing system has been a nightmare (and the person who rated the restaurant one star based on her inability to get a reservation really irks me), but perseverance and patience will pay off.  If you get a reservation or have the opportunity to make one - don't think about it, just do it, turn yourself over to Alinea staff and be prepared to be blown away.",0.956,0.88,0.093,0.026,0.4478883219954648

2012-08-16,5.0,"In my four years as a member of Yelp!, I've written a grand total of two - count 'em, TWO - restaurant reviews. As much as I consider myself a foodie, I'm just not big on writing about food. And even though I've had the pleasure of ""collecting"" over 20 Michelin stars from dining standards like Wolfgang Puck's Spago to bucket-list restaurants like Thomas Keller's The French Laundry and Per Se over the past few years, I've never really felt compelled to write a review about any of them. Then I dined at Alinea, Grant Achatz's Michelin three-starred restaurant in Chicago at the forefront of American molecular gastronomy. FOOD: First things first: at Alinea, unlike the aforementioned The French Laundry and Per Se, food is as much about spectacle as it is about taste. The plating and presentation of the dishes here were by far the most creative I've ever experienced. A few were gimmicky (e.g. four pieces of seafood entangled in seaweed atop a giant piece of driftwood), but most were functional - and all were extremely fun, especially the green apple balloon and the ""cracked"" white chocolate egg.  Now if you're worried that Chef Achatz is all style and no substance - as I was - let me reassure you: some of his dishes were among the best I've ever eaten. The aforementioned ""four pieces of seafood"" were the best bites of crab, lobster, and clam I've ever had, the corn dish was out of this world, and you can't go wrong with two of Chef Achatz's signature dishes: ""Hot Potato, Cold Potato"" and ""Black Truffle Explosion."" My sister and I also went to town on the final dessert, the ""cracked"" white chocolate egg that covered the entire table, and finished the entire thing, which was no easy feat considering it was the 19th and final course - and also the largest. SERVICE: Like any Michelin-starred restaurant, the service here is top-notch - dishes always arrived with razor-like synchronicity, every course was explained thoroughly, crumbs were always brushed away, and my wine glass was never left empty. If I have one complaint, it's that I felt the service here was a bit more relaxed than what I've experienced at Thomas Keller's restaurants or at Joel Robuchon's three Tokyo establishments. The servers were always professional, but they had a more casual attitude than what I'm used to at restaurants of this caliber. Some people don't like the ""stuffy"" atmosphere of fine dining restaurants, but if I'm gonna pay an arm and a leg for a meal fit for a king, I don't mind being treated like one. AMBIANCE: Other than the darkened entrance hall with its neon outlines and grassy walkway, I was not particularly impressed by the decor of the restaurant - it's mainly black and white with accent lighting in various shades of neon. But I think that's kind of the point. Each of the food presentations here is like its own work of art, so the restaurant itself is like the blank canvas upon which these works of art are presented. Nowhere was this more obvious than during the ""cracked"" white chocolate egg dessert course, which utilized the entire table - covered with a latex tablecloth, of course - as a canvas. I will say, though, that the noise level in the restaurant was a bit on the louder end, which again created a more casual atmosphere than what I'm used to at Michelin-starred restaurants. VERDICT: I'm not an easily impressed diner, and I don't like writing food reviews. But Alinea surpassed all of my expectations and then some, and my dining experience here prompted me to do the unthinkable: to write a review on Yelp!. And that's just it - you don't just have dinner at Alinea; you have a DINING EXPERIENCE. One that I will never forget.",0.9955,0.842,0.122,0.035,0.49104477611940284
2012-08-13,4.0,"Maybe I should have read reviews of this place before I went, but it was a bit too experimental for me. Here is an example of a dish we had: three pieces of well prepared lamb, with 60 possible sauces/herbs/fruits for you to choose to eat the lamb with. Did I seriously just drop almost $300 to compose my own dishes? I'm certainly no expert at doing this and definitely made some suboptimal choices. And do people really like the dessert where they drop things everywhere? It's a cool show but taste-wise, it was pretty far from the best desserts I've had. I have to give it 4*s because a few of the courses were among the best dishes I've ever had, in terms of taste and presentation. Some of my favorites, without going into too much detail for fear of ruining it for others, included an otoro course and a lobster/crab dish. Just know what your getting yourself into: it's much hype,  not everything will be even close to the best things you've ever tasted, there won't be as much meat/seafood as courses at other restaurants (one course was only ginger), the reservation system where you buy your table in advance with no ability to change it at all is highly obnoxious and shows how pretentious these people are (no other top restaurants in the country do this).

Being from out of town, I only had 3 nights that would have worked for my schedule so that made it even harder to secure a reservation. On that fateful afternoon that the tickets were released, I only found out about 15 minutes after they went on sale and they were almost all sold out. I was extremely lucky to snatch up the last available table for 2 for the day that would work for me. Tickets to this restaurant were tougher to get than Justin Bieber concert tickets!

Fortunately a coworker caught the release as it was happening, and half an hour later I was sitting on tickets for a four top.  But I was looking for a reservation for 3.

Center pieces were used to present in the middle of the table to be saved for uses in a certain course.   I had a bunch of courses described in this review but i realized I didn't want to spoil it for foodies that haven't been here so I deleted it. Every course is a surprise on it's own. Even though I liked and was amazed by every course some of the course that I thought was just made me speechless was Hot Potato Cold Potato, Taste of the Ocean, Farm Salad, Peach and Black Truffle Explosion. Like I said I'm not going to spoil these course for you by describing them, you're going to have to experience it for yourself.   The Decor:   Very low key on the outside and not much to look at but once you step inside... Wow!! Stunning looking restaurant. Automatic doors slide open at the end of the  hallway after you open the front door. Once you step in you can see the very busy kitchen right behind the maitreid's podium. Very modern and chic. throughout the whole dining room. The Service:   Impeccable, One of the best services I've ever had in all my dining experiences. They made us feel very comfortable right from the start. All the servers that served our food did a great job of describing our dishes and teaching us on how to eat them. They were also very comedic at times when serving our dishes. It was fun. The best was when Chef came at the very end and chatted with us a little bit while he was ""painting"" our dessert. Everyone was so professional and nice. The Summary:   Definitely worth the experience and trip. The expert critics were right as to vote this place the number one restaurant in America. My wife and I decided to make a annual trip to Chicago just to dine here after this meal. I can tell Chef Achatz is a very passionate and hard working chef by his food. On top of that he is not arrogant but a very nice and humble chef. He is by far my favorite chef to date. For all you true foodies out there, this is a place no matter where you are in the world, call Alinea, make a reservation, buy a ticket and fly to Chicago and you will have the most amazing meal of your life.",0.9987,0.77,0.208,0.021,0.5805714285714285

2012-07-13,5.0,"I flew out from Los Angeles just to have dinner at Alinea. Although I am certified broke now, the whole trip was worth every penny! This is a highly sought after restaurant. It has opened since 2005 and is still going strong. So don't you dare to call it a hype!  I had my wonderful experience on this past Saturday. The restaurant is spaced out in different pods. We were seated in one of their pods upstairs. Table was not set until my party sat down. The staff set it in front of us and jokingly explained that they had shrunk the table cloth to a small pillow, hence, no table cloth. An unconventional start. I didn't go for the wine pairings because I am no wine expert. I 'd rather save my taste buds for the delicate dishes. Food was then served promptly after he explained how it worked.  There was no music on the background. I could actually hear other patrons' conversations and their ooooh's and ahhhh's. It could easily be me having a dinner party in my imaginary designer dining room. Everybody looked relaxed and was having fun. That's how I felt. It's a casual and cozy environment. I did not get pretentious from Alinea, given that this is a michellin 3 star restaurant. I never feel rushed. They didn't give me dirty looks for taking too many pictures. They even gave me a heads up before the balloon came out because it didn't do well in room temperature, so I could start snapping pictures as soon as my balloon was escorted out. Not only did the food look super appetizing (with the help of vibrant colors and intriguing plating), it tasted phenomenal too! Portion was small but definitely a party in every bite! As I understood, the whole meal was divided into 3 series, tastes from the ocean, the earth and then dessert. And they were not kidding, each bite captured the flavors very well. From the taste to plating, every detail was well designed and executed. Each bite was precious and worked harmoniously with each other.  One of my highlights was the sighting of Chef Achatz! He would go to most tables to create the final course himself and smashed those eggs. It was a pleasure to see him popping up here and there throughout the night. When he came to my table and worked his magic, it was a show and he knew it. He gave a performance without being over-the-top. He was different from other celebrity chefs. Don't expect him to make small talks. He explained the course matter-of-factly. As soon as it was done, he would leave. Not aloof (in my opinion), but kept it professional. One thing is very different from other restaurants was that staffs never introduced themselves and they constantly changed. Among 15 courses, I think I had at least 7 different staffs served at our table, and I only knew one of their names (slipped out accidentally). They were very attentive but not pushy, and they all had similar sense of humor. They kept making witty dry comments. I wonder if they had a script or guidelines for what they may or may not say.  All in all, I had a great time. It is an experience that evokes all of your senses. I will definitely go back! Trivia: I had the pleasure to tour the kitchen at the end of dinner. It's a medium sized kitchen with no actual fire going on. Helium tank fills up balloon regularly. They clean the kitchen 4 times a day. It did look spotless to me. The expediter was only 21-year-old and great at what he's doing. All servers run up and down the service stairs like hundred times a day. There are 20 tables in total and filled up every night. Each service ware is an art form so take your time to admire it.",0.9968,0.84,0.129,0.031,0.5693452122265682
2012-07-13,5.0,"I had the opportunity to eat at this place last month when I vacationed in Chicago.  I don't want to give too much away about the food because honestly you are spending the $$$$ on the experience.  Its like someone giving away the ending to a movie you haven't seen.  First off the setting. The decor is contemporary.  Colors there were a mixture of brown, slate and black  The Atmosphere was classy and intimate. Lighting was dim and I almost didn't feel like I was in a restaurant but in someone's rich apartment loft. The noise level there was mild and toned down.  I was actually quite surprised how peaceful it was considering the restaurant was full.  I guess it was because all the tables were spread out into separate rooms.  In each room there were only 3 -4 tables and far apart from each other.  People were probably on their best behaviors too.   The Service was first class!  I felt like a celebrity.  Honestly it was like I had my own butler.  The gentleman who served us, (don't remember his name, but he had long dark curly hair) was always polite and treated us like kings. He was extremely knowledgeable on every dish.  How it was suppose to make you feel, what the food was made of, the history of that food, how to eat it to develop the best savor and what was the inspiration of that dish.  It was like watching an artist describe his masterpiece.  Some may not like people telling you how to eat your food.  But I didn't mind.  If you are spending this much $$$$ on your food, don't you want to experience it right to make your moneys worth?  You will never use the same utensils twice.  When I left to use the restroom, I threw my napkin on the table.  I came back to find my napkin folded neatly.  When there was a drop of sauce on my table, the waiter came right away to wipe it up for me.   The food was creative and so artistic.  You almost don't  want to eat it because it looked so beautiful.  I didn't even know some was edible. My camera phone was snapping shots all night.  The thing here is about quality not quantity.  So if you are looking for 20 oz steaks, don't come.  The food will tickle your 5 senses; smell,sight,touch,taste,and hearing.  If you get the wine pairing like I did.  Then make that 6; mind.  Yes, I got pretty buzzed after 15-1 oz glasses of wine.  Remember this is 19 courses so expect to be there for 3 hours.  I don't want to give the description of the food away but its nothing you'll find elsewhere.  Very molecular gastronomy I would say.  Some food were playful while others were a deconstruction of a classic dish. And does it taste good?  Hell Yes!  The price was expensive. one 19 course with wine paring can be someone's one month rent in the midwest.  But if you want that once in a lifetime experience then come to Alinea.  It's worth it. Lucky getting a reservation though. generally its a 3 month wait.",0.9985,0.785,0.189,0.026,0.5198589065255733
2012-07-13,3.0,"I was expecting more. That's basically my summed-up experience. One thing I will say, is that half the fun is the surprise element of the food, so reading all the reviews is not the best idea. I did it- because I wanted to know what that price tag was going towards- but it definitely took away from the experience and if there's one thing I'd recommend is STOP READING THE DESCRIPTION OF THE FOOD. and STOP LOOKING AT THE PICTURES! STOP! RIGHT NOW!! For that much money, I expect the things I eat to be REALLY DELICIOUS. Not just ""good, and cool presentation!"" but REALLY DELICIOUS. Overall I would say maybe 3 courses I would say that, the rest were... pretty good. Like I said, I expected more. Also, I made the reservation for a special occasion (first wedding anniversary) but nobody asked me if there was an occasion when I made the reservation. Most nice places do- even a Morton's will ask you, and then print ""happy anniversary!"" on your menu. Nothing here. Like I said, I expected more. GT Fish and Oyster wished my husband a happy birthday when we arrived, and when we were seated, and then gave him a birthday gift before we left. THAT is service. Alinea could learn a thing or two. However as far as service goes, I was pretty pleased. I didn't have any of the issues I saw other people comment on. My husband and I don't drink, and nobody pressured us to order something we didn't want. We did several of the house sodas which were tasty.  The bottom line is that it really is an event to dine here- my husband liked it way more than I did- partly, I think, because he hadn't read all the info on the courses and was genuinely impressed by what came out. I thought it was all pretty good. A couple of courses (everyone mentions the same ones, for good reason) were amazing, and the rest- pretty good. I wouldn't do it again, but I'm glad we tried it once.  **Side note: funniest part of the night was when one of our courses that comes... well, sort of balanced on other stuff, slipped off onto the table. The servers all froze, and I swear, the guy who dropped the stuff looked like he was going to go do hara kiri in the kitchen in the back. I think I laughed and said something like ""man overboard!"" because I was trying to ease the tension but I don't think it worked. Poor guy.",0.999,0.684,0.266,0.05,0.5634498480243162

2012-07-11,3.0,"I spent more than an hour hitting redial on my telephone trying to make my reservation so needless to say I was very eager to finally be able to dine at Alinea although I was able to secure a 5:15 reservation--a bit early, but at least I finally got a reservation.  When my sister and I arrived at 5:00 (didn't want to be late), we were escorted to the upstairs front room that was very nice--much better than the dark rooms I passed when I went to the restroom.  The pace of service was too quick. Not just for my table, but for all of the tables in the room. We had our check paid within 2 1/2 hours--a bit too quick for what should have been a more leisurely meal. Definitely should have been a 3 hour meal. Also, after about the 5th course, I got tired/annoyed with the waiter telling me how to eat each course--""do this/don't do this"". Really annoying was the captain who instructed us not to place the used flatware on the napkin since the napkin would be used later in the dinner; surprise: the napkin was eventually removed and never seen again. There was a plating on wet seaweed that was simply unappealing to look at although the tastes of the shellfish were good once dug out of the slimey seaweed. Absolutely hated the tastes of ginger--I've never been a big ginger fan, but after this course that were mere tastes of different very pungently-flavored ginger, I now rank ginger among my least favorite flavors (almost as bad as olives). I did love the truffle raviolo. I did enjoy the smoking pear dessert. Didn't care for the famous shattered white chocolate since I've never found white chocolate to have much flavor. The tasting of lamb that came with about 60 drops of flavor should have had a ""cheat sheet"" since I wasted the small bites in some less than stellar tastings--definitely would have liked to have known what I was tasting. The Miro spoons were very good. The best thing about the dinner was the excellent bottle of Robert Weil Auslese that I had selected. I had such high expectations for my much anticipated dinner at Alinea, and maybe if I lived in Chicago, I'd go back to try it again.

I've driven by Alinea countless times without even noticing it (thanks to the unmarked door). There's not much to notice inside as well with the minimal decor, but you're not here for the atmosphere. You are here for the food, presentation and service. The food was amazing (I loved every little course), but the presentation was even better. Every course kept getting better and better (both taste and presentation), but it was the last dessert course that really blew me away. I didn't think anything could impress me more than the 2nd to last course, the green apple edible helium balloon, but I was wrong. One of the chefs came out and we watched him litearlly create artwork on our table. After all sorts of interesting concoctions there was an explosion, which turned into white chocolate mixed with beyond delish frozen fruit.  I was in pregnancy heaven. The several servers that are assigned to your table also don't miss a beat throughout your meal. At one point my dining companion dropped something on her dress and they had a shout wipe within her hand within minutes. The service was so good that I almost expected them to have a new dress waiting for her and a drycleaners onsite. Now THAT would be impressive.

The biggest flaw in the evening was how rudely the wait staff treated us when we opted not to get the wine pairings.  They attempted to talk us out of it, then pushed a champagne cocktail on to us that we didn't really want.  Later, when we each just wanted one glass of wine, the staff lectured us about how difficult it would be to have just one glass of wine since each glass only goes with one dish, and how they could really only properly serve us if we would get the entire wine pairing.  I did not get the wine pairing because I wanted to enjoy the experience without getting too tipsy, but the waitstaff made me feel as though I was being cheap. Additionally, when my tablemate did not eat all of the first course because he did not care for roe, the waitstaff loudly made a big scene about asking him why he didn't like it and if there was anything else that he didn't want them to bother bringing out.  It embarassed him and, after that interaction, we couldn't help but feel awkward and judged during the meal.

While the food is the heart of the matter, many other people have broken that down in detail, so I will focus on the experience.  I was nestled in a lovely chair (why don't all restaurants have such wonderful chairs?) and served by a cadre of staff the most strange and wonderful food.  I was very impressed with the staff, they were an excellent blend of knowledgeable, sociable, and smart.  Surely this is fine dining, but it was not in the least bit stuffy.  I found the young sommelier especially charming.   Even though the food may be presented in bizarre ways (apple balloon) the flavors may ring so true as to whisk you off in a food memory.  The dashi almost made me tear.  That may sounds really silly to most people.  But I'm an LA born-Tokyo loving food fiend studying in Omaha, so chew on that for a second.  The dashi's flavors were so clear, I felt home and comforted and I was almost overwhelmed.  I was not at all prepared for the experience.  I'm incredibly grateful for the opportunity, best present ever.",0.998,0.635,0.303,0.061,0.6333856421356421

No, but not because it wasn't fantastic, but because I'll give it a few years for the chef to come up with some new tricks. It wouldn't be as fun with out the element of surprise.

Yeah, do yourself a favor, throw it all away.  I have never been one for molecular gastronomy, but going to this restaurant has given me a fresh perspective into believing in the science - or art.  When they say 'no course is the same' they really do mean it. The beginning of the night started with the waiter asking me of my likes, dislikes, food allergies, and whatever else I would prefer. They fit every course around what I had specified. The presentation was impeccable - less a dish that you eat, rather a grand presentation that you watch unfold, becomes your dish, and finally you enjoy every bite. One of my dishes was presented, oddly, to me on a pillow - yeah, you heard it, pillow. When I was ready to dive into the dish, the waiter punctured the pillow and off I went. I know smell is directly related to how your food tastes, but it couldn't be more apparent than this.  There are quite a few people who are critical of this restaurant and a few more who rave about this restaurant; even if you have read the bad reviews, it's worth a try. It's a meal of a life-time that I plan on having a few more times in this life.  Please be on time!

They have a 15 minute window in which they will cancel your reservation.  The restaurant staff is very direct in enforcing the dress-code through their information they provide on the phone.

I have had fantastic, near-perfect meals at Per Se and 11MP, and great meals at Momo Ko and e' by Jose Andres, but I always left feeling that there was somewhere with something even more to offer. This might not be everyone's type of restaurant, but for me, I loved the ingenuity of the food, the tastes and textures and smells, the wonderful laid-back service with lots of smiles and jokes, the tour of the kitchen, the pretty cool set up of the restaurant...everything just was amazing. Out of 20 courses, there were two I wasn't crazy about...Wooly Pig, which was squid with fennel and orange (not sure why they call it Wooly Pig and I'm not a big fennel/orange guy) and Five Tastes of Ginger (not a big ginger guy unless it is used subtly). The other 18 courses...really good to life-altering....those life-altering courses being Burn Morels (morels, poached egg, foie gras and other wonderful things served on hot rocks), Lamb 86 (lamb three ways with 60 garnishes served on a square glass plate where you try the lamb with several different garnishes at a time to create different flavor combinations- very interactive and fun), and the final dessert course where one of the chefs comes out and utilizes the whole table as an artist's palette for your dessert. Roughly half the courses were one bite deals, another 5-6 were 6-7 bites, and several were appetizer- size or so. Not a lot of food in the whole scheme of things...but I didn't leave hungry and def. worth every penny. Wine pairings...good with generous pours for $150..very knowledgable and friendly sommelier.

So just a couple things to note - first, the service is a bit haughty at first, but they warm up quickly once they get a better feel for your table and your expectations (ours was, horror of horrors, to have fun). Second, the eternal question of wine strategy. We didn't do pairings, but instead ordered a couple bottles of wine after a champagne drink for the table. The sommelier and waiters shockingly push you into the pairings, but don't feel pressured and get a couple bottles if you prefer. Third, as for group size, I went with a party of six, which, while they were able to accomodate us,  I think might be just slightly too big. I might stick to a party of four on the high end. Fifth, I have semi-weird dining habits - pescetarian - (no meat, just fish/shellfish) and the adjustments they made were fantastic. Wooly Pig became Cucumber, and Lamb became Turbot. There were a couple other adjustments but they were so minute as to barely register.

2012-04-26,3.0,"Here are two facts: 1.  The single best bite of food I've ever tasted was at Alinea (and that isn't hyperbole, I can still recall each flavor and how they mixed together) 2.  The meal as a whole was very disappointing I loved a quarter of the courses in this experience, thought a third were pretty good, and the rest were sub par at best. We only had 18 courses.  One of those courses was a leaf, literally a leaf on a plate.  Another course was based on peas.  Yes, an entire course on peas. My girlfriend and I discussed a few weeks later (meal was in July 2011) and concluded that the summer menu just must not compare to the other seasons. Otherwise we didn't understand the accolades.  We've eaten at Moto, and that was signifcantly better. Another explanation is that perhaps Alinea is just hit or miss based on that night's menu.  But if that's the case, then they've failed.  At the prices you're paying, it has to be awesome every single time.  Ours definitely wasn't. And there's the rub.  I would gladly pay whatever to eat that one wonderful bite of food again... but can't.  I would gladly pay the Alinea price to be able to pick my own menu from several selections at each stage... but can't.  And since I have no control at all then you have to do better than odd tasting peas and a leaf on a plate. Service was absolutely top notch. Last note: after we left my gf and I were both hungry (and we are not big eaters).  We actually debated going to grab an appetizer or dessert somewhere else afterward, and just barely decided against since it was so late.  And we ate everything put in front of us at Alinea.",0.9547,0.847,0.108,0.046,0.4637210884353741

I know the attentiveness and attention to every possible detail should be standard for a restaurant of this caliber, but it was still impressive and I loved being so waited upon!! I won't waste time going in to detail about each of the courses since the menu changes, but I will say that my favorites were 4 bites of seafood served on drift wood, the black truffle explosion (signature dish), and the desert which took up the whole table and is impossible to describe in a way that will do it justice! I will also say that while everything we ate was delicious, it's the unique presentation and the creativity of each dish that really makes this such a fun experience.  We also did the wine pairing and it was totally worth the extra $$. Each wine was a great accompaniment to the course(s) and the sommelier, while a bit of a fast talker, was very knowledgeable and gave a great intro to each of the wines.

2012-04-19,5.0,"[For the full review with pictures, see the link to my blog on my profile.] I thought my plan was foolproof: two months to the calender day as soon as 11am Eastern Time struck, I would call Alinea and presumably have no problem securing a reservation. Well, I was under a misapprehension. It ultimately took 3-5 phone calls per minute for 95 minutes before I finally made it through to a reservationist. I hated the restaurant before I had even crossed the border into Illinois. During my final class of the semester, when the subject of Chicago restaurants surfaced, one of my stats professors mentioned that Alinea delivered the best meal of his life. I found myself struggling to agree with him. It's not the best meal I've had, I said, nor is it the tastiest food I've ever had. But it doesn't need to be because it's the most fun I've ever had in a restaurant tout court. Alinea's impishness is on display from the moment one is seated, as the table's centerpiece is a large block of ice gravid with beet-hibiscus-black licorice juice that becomes a palate cleanser following an aggressively seasoned purée of scallops--intended to mirror tofu, except with flavor, of course--sitting in, inter alia, dashi.  With one playful dish after another, the occasional pratfall is bound to occur. And it did, several times. Nothing fell flatter than a utensil-free course of Mangalitsa ham, squid tentacle, orange and fennel, which tasted as if the kitchen had discovered a way to transmogrify orange into a dog's chew toy, making for one of the more unpleasant adventures of the evening. And then there was the edible helium-filled green apple taffy balloon. The balloon is temperature sensitive, and due to the moderate humidity that day, on first delivery one of the balloons shriveled into an unattractive mass, at which point a collective dejection cascaded across the dining room; based on the runner's reaction and how quickly he absconded back to the kitchen, you would have thought he arrived with his pants down.  Those lapses can be easily overlooked given the deep-water greatness of several items. After a few introductory courses that amount to throat-clearing exercises, the kitchen demonstrated its ability to walk on water with four courses of outright genius that detonate on your palate unlike anything you've experienced before. It started with a mouthful of spring: four torrid stones holding first of the season morels coated in the feathery baste of beurre monté, asparagus, maitakes, mushroom purée, fried mizuna, and a sixty-three degree quail egg. Next, we'd be treated to an Achatz original: hot potato-cold potato, which leaves your brain trying to conduct an expeditious inventory of details--hot, black truffle-topped Yukon gold potato (check!), cold, velvety potato soup (check!)--as it reconciles two seemingly incongruous sensations. Moving on to what would constitute the main course, first a mirror with sixty ingredients was placed in the middle of the table, soon followed by a plate with three immaculately prepared cuts of lamb: the shank, the saddle and the loin. This almost seemed like the kitchen's way of saying, ""Hey, just in case you thought all we do is play around with gels, hydrocolloids and unconventional plating techniques, check this s*** out."" Spacing out the classics, then came the black truffle explosion, Achatz's successful effort that lasers in on the flavor of black truffle. As if it had been read a sob story, the raviolo gushed forth its black truffle goodness. And despite instructions to seal one's lips tightly, I managed to spray truffle stock half-way across the table.  Overseeing this playground was our server Kevin, a hirsute redhead. I had read that service could be on the cold and condescending side, but that certainly wasn't our experience, for everyone who made a pit stop at our table was delightful and most courteous. My one gripe is that while a meal at Alinea will leave one giddy, there's also fatigue that comes with two-and-a-half hours of instructions that precede each course--don't grab the burning end of the cinnamon stick, don't bite down on the metal ball, please don't wait too long to enjoy this dish as it is time sensitive and on it goes--such that there are points where one wonders, ""Is this a restaurant, or am I in the principal's office?""  One final point: it seemed to me that tables were a bit too close to one another. This wouldn't be such a problem if menu length varied by table, as it did several years ago (when the restaurant offered a 26-course option). However, since every table now experiences the same sequence of courses, there's a reasonably high probability that many of the surprises can be sullied if you find yourself gazing in any direction for too long. Notwithstanding these minor quibbles, the food is stunning. It's the equivalent of running a red light over a dozen times and not crashing, and I cannot wait to return the next chance I get.",0.9739,0.89,0.07,0.04,0.4869035218253967

2012-03-08,5.0,"Alinea... Our vacation dinner took place here nearly 4 months ago. However the memories of the flavor profiles still permeate my prefrontal lobe. I do not use the term vacation dinner lightly - this is truly an experience that will transcend culinary predispositions as well as American Express cards. Defining this dining experience is not something I can jot down in a few hundred words in some online review.  Rather it is simply the experience of enjoying something that was designed, no destined, to be a work of art. I have eaten from delis, food carts, and extremely fine dining establishments across the United States, this was just distinctly different. My Beautiful Wife - in the awe of interesting meals coming faster than Nordstrom Rack Shoes Clearances, could not stop photographing and commenting on the distinctiveness of each dish.  However, I sat awestruck - wondering how someone can sit around and think of an experience remotely similar to this culinary journey. We of course had the staples, 'hot potato - cold potato' and the desert that could easily be described as the next act at Blue Man Group.  But it was the detail, no the attention to detail, that had me wondering.  Where does Grant get this inspiration?  When did the thought putting a pillow of pine-scented air on my table with a beautiful bowl enter his mind? The wine was wondrous.  Please don't indulge without it.  It should not be an optional component.  This interface with the meal was critical to my understanding of the dish as well as my propensity of getting 'more' later on in the evening (thanks Grant!) I can easily close this review by writing a cliché that each true ""foodie"" should experience the wonder that is Alinea.  What I recommend is, hell, Go - spend the money.  I can promise you won't be disappointed.",0.9885,0.811,0.155,0.034,0.4800999412110524

I was beyond excited to try Alinea, dreaming about it for the last three years, so when I had the chance to fly to Chicago I immediately called to make a reservation. They only had an opening on Sunday at 9:30pm - no problem, I'll take it! One of the servers had a problem though - he seemed to be having a bad day, especially when we chose NOT to get the wine pairing (at $150 extra). When you go to a 3 Michelin star restaurant you expect a magnificent and impeccable service, even if you get the 9:30pm Sunday slot - such service exists - I experienced it at Manresa (a 2 star restaurant). This guy seemed to have gotten offended that we didn't get the pairing, he then went on to give us a ""glass of champagne for us to try and to see if we changed our minds about the tasting - on the house"". We didn't, and he ended up charging for them! Hence the 4 star rating for misleading patrons and for the bad mood. Besides that, the presentation was simply magnificent, well thought out, just incredible. I just wish I could re-experience it again with a great service, I'm sure that it would've tasted much better.",0.9623,0.731,0.169,0.1,0.7037301587301588

Some of the dishes require you to put in a little work not a lot, to put it together. Everything is pretty small.

I had a good time. Didn't try any cocktails other than their juice, so I can't really comment on that.

2012-02-26,5.0,"I ate at Alinea again last night, nearly two years after my first visit with a fleeting concern that my second visit wouldn't live up to my first.  All but one of the dishes was new - Hot Potato, Cold Potato remained on the menu.  They must have listened to my prior review as they picked the right one as their trusty stand-by :)  All in all, this experience was even better than my first!   1.  We started the meal with Char Roe accompanied by carrot, coconut and curry.  This dish is not too memorable.   My friend has a salmon allergy, and they substituted Mango for Roe and impressively even printed up her menu with this substitution. 2 - 5.  Oyster Leaf, King Crab, Mussel and Razor Clam.  Brought out on a piece of driftwood from the ocean, this was one of the more unique presentations.  The concept of the Oyster Leaf was unique - the oyster flavor was subtle and more present in the after taste.  The Razor Clam was prepared in an Asian sauce of shiso, soy and kaikon and was the winner of these four preparations.  Note that it wasn't clear to us until they brought out our printed menus that this was treated as 4 dishes as it seemed we completed our meal a few short of the 19 promised.   6.  Wooly Pig served with fennel, orange, and squid. - served on a metal stick and meant to be eaten no-hand's, this again was a unique and fun presentation.  The fennel flavor, fortunately, was subtle and worked with the pig and squid. 7.  Scallop.  Served as a mouse rather than an actual scallop, the scallop flavor could have been stronger.  This was probably my least favorite dish of the evening. 8.  Ice Beet.  The centerpiece on each table is a brick of ice with test tubes filled with a deep purple liquid.  During this course, you slurp out the beet juice.  If you like beets, this is awesome.   9.  Black Sea Bass.  This was the most traditional dish served all evening and one of the highlights! This is a healthy portion - a whole fish split between two people.  Reviews had said to be careful to not eat too much of this to save room for the rest of the meal.  At the end, we wished we had cleaned the bones on this Bass. 10.  Hot Potato - as good as I remembered it!  The Parmesan and Truffle really make this dish. 11.  Wild Mushrooms - I loved this dish but also LOVE mushrooms.   12.  Venison - this was another of my favorites.  You basically make a cabbage wrap with mustard, bacon, venison, and a few other accompaniments, and the flavors explode in your mouth. 13.  Black Truffle - Another masterpiece and debatably as good as Hot Potato.  I'm partial to Truffles.   14.  Squab - the waiter arranges a bunch of forks and spoons on the table in front of you, one of which has the squab and the rest have different bites to go with it.  You eat them one by one, dropping the forks and spoons into a bucket.  This dish was more about presentation than substance (though wasn't bad). 15.  Anjou Pear served with Brie.  I was excited for this dish as love warm Brie.  I feel like the Brie could have been stronger as I only tasted the Pear. 16.  Ginger.  Five small pieces of ginger with varying intensity levels.  A nice pallet cleanser.   17.  Winter.  This was delicious!  See the picture for presentation but basically the white ""snow"" was minty and melted in your mouth.  So light and refreshing! 18.  Balloon. A green apple, helium infused balloon.  Fun to talk with helium, especially after all the wine pairings!   19.  Dark Chocolate.  Much written about, one of the chefs (Grant wasn't in the house) brought out a hollow chocolate ball filled with crackers (?), cotton candy, and more chocolate and smashed it on a table drizzled with three sauces (butternut squash, lingonberry and stout).  I would have much, much preferred that the sauces be salted caramel and peanut butter as I am a freak and don't like chocolate and fruit together.  Great concept and a fun end to our 3.5 hour experience! My friend and I both had the wine pairings though I asked for ""short"" pours as Alinea has the reputation for pouring heavy, and I wanted to remember all of the meal!  Neither of us felt like we had that much wine by the end of the evening, and I wouldn't be scared to get full pours next time!  There were a healthy number of sweeter wines.  I'm usually not a fan of sweet wine or port but these seemed to work well with the food. In terms of service, what I especially appreciate about Alinea is the lack of pretentiousness of the waitstaff.  They're engaging and unobtrusive.    My only complaint was when the bill came, we had been charged $16 for a coffee and espresso.  Seems a bit steep, no? What separates Alinea from other restaurants of this caliber is the uniqueness in the food and preparation.  Pure genious...",0.9993,0.805,0.168,0.028,0.5255115060378219

Mind you this was at the beginning of December, my reservation was for February. Having not been home in almost two years, I lured my extremely Asian parents (meaning their idea of a fancy dinner is a meal at Olive Garden, anything beyond that is unnecessary) here on the basis of it being my baby sister's birthday.  They began our meal by greeting us and wishing my sister a happy birthday. Although their names escape me now, the waiters we had were all great. I was a little worried at the beginning about the stuffiness, but they warmed up, were funny and definitely added some wittiness to each dish. They also set aside a special dish for the birthday girl, a creative dessert involving the unwrapping of a present and chocolate and warm cream? which she thoroughly enjoyed.  The meal was spectacular and even my parents thought so (WINNN!). Everything was clearly incredibly well thought out and without a doubt, an experience unlike any other.  The highlights of the meal were the Yuba, King Crab, Wild Mushrooms, Hot Potato and Dark Chocolate.

2012-02-13,5.0,"In a nutshell: Food: 5 stars (period.) P/C: 4.5 stars Service 4.5 stars Alinea really brought me out of my culinary, gastronomical box, helped me come to a realization that this is truly one of a kind, and provided an example how such a perfect combination of a form of art and a form of science can create wonders, i mean wonders.   I have to admit, I was a bit nervous before I went in here.  I have this jinx about restaurants - if i have a wonderful experience in one restaurant, the next restaurant i visit just turns out to be a mediocre experience (and i feared more after such a wonderous experience i had at L2O the night before).  and throughout the night, everything that i ate, felt, smelled, and saw at this restaurant proved me wrong.   I am going to omit what I had - because it'd just be too difficult to list them and depict them there.  if you're ever going here - just let them know of your dietary restrictions, and let them take care of you and take you through the journey of your life. you're in good hands. the goods: 1. i LOVED the thrill of not knowing exactly what i was going to have next.  every dish after another was something to be awed about and to be remembered for a long time.  they used lots of apparatus, gadgets and other whimsically brilliant ways to absorb the experience.   2. i LOVED even more how they really paid particular attention to my sense of smell - in 4~5 dishes, they really brought out something that not only made my sense of taste happy but also my sense of smell - amazingly done. 3. when i close my eyes, walk through the journey and pick one dish that moved me the most - it was the loup de mer dish - wonderfully sumptuous whole fish simply grilled with lemon and mint, complemented by sea salt, mint pesto (?), caponata (amazing...), and chick pea chips.  the was nothing molecular or scientific about this dish, but they stuck to the fundamentals (good ingreidnets, good execution skills and the marriage of the ingredients).  i will never forget this dish. 4. the wine program was pretty dynamic - pretty much stuck around in the old world.   the chassagne-montrachet was my favorite pairing with the loup de mer.  the echezeaux was a bit too tight for me, and the wild mushroom dish didn't fully open up all the good stuff that wine probably had. 5. service - spot-on.  the interval between dishes was absolutely perfect.  the servers were interactive and friendly but not too chatty (golden..) 6. the presentation obviously was creative and out of this world.  i got a little tensed up on parts where i had to participate, but oh my am i going to remember them. 7. they completely listened and took care of my hatred toward game meats.  i didn't see them anywhere near me during dinner. 8. the staff anticipate what you're going to do and take care of you - i managed a major coffee stain on my beige jacket, they must have sensed some distraught-ness in my face, brought a thing of shout-wipes so i can undo the stain.   9. A real time perfomance by Chef Achatz with the last dessert - nicely done. the not-so-goods: 1. this is really my own fault, but the loup de mer portion was too big, i ended up eating almost the whole fish, which was a stupid move.  gah. 2. not a sweet/dessert wine fan and after 3 consecutive sweet wines, i was getting dizzy.  i personally would've preferred something a bit fruit-forward but not as sweet...the whole time i was having the last messy dessert - i was thinking gigondas. Alinea in a league of its own, it's simply not comparable to some of the other restaurants I've been - it was impressive on all fronts, i mean all fronts.  it was 4 hours well spent and i will remember this experience for a long time. As of Alinea, i think I am at crossroads where I can definitively list out the things that I enjoy/look for in fine-dining experiences.  I think I prefer traditional to eccentric and bread service to audience participation to assemble dishes.  I have 110% for Alinea and everybody that makes the restaurant as successful as it is now and I am going to have to thank them for really opening a next chapter of my culinary journey.   Thank you Alinea.",0.997,0.817,0.136,0.047,0.5494791666666666

They offer one menu only, a tasting menu with the selection of 2 different wine parings, a standard pairing and a reserve.  My advice to you, go all the way.  You will not regret it.  I will not go through each course as enough have already done that, but like others have said, all of the courses are outstanding, while several are unforgettable and they are all incredibly innovative and your participation is required.

We never felt rushed, yet we didn't feel like it was slow. They truly do let you set your own pace. We had fun with the waiters and never felt as if it were a pretentious atmosphere. Contrary to what most people on yelp suggested, we did try the wine pairings, since it was our first time there. The pairings did not disappoint. Each course was brilliant in its presentation, ability to interact, and the imagination was such that we had never seen before. The flavor profiles of each dish were perfect.

2012-02-01,5.0,"I am a bit new to the world of ultra high-end dining, but Alinea was a truly special experience.  Every course was excellent, many were unforgettable.  In addition, dinner at Alinea is part theater part meal.  Nearly every course is presented in an elaborate, clever, and playful way.  At many restaurants I would disdain such gimmickry, but Alinea pulls it off and then some.  The quality and flavor of the food does not suffer one bit due to such flare.   Favorite course were the black truffle explosion (an impossibly rich, single bite, ravioli filled with a black truffle emulsion), winter in New Hampshire (a beautiful presentation of peppermint snow topped with a few sweet bites)  and a fish dish served family style.   I may never eat a more inventive or delicious meal in my life.  That said, I believe the food to be EVERY bit as good at Charlie Trotters (my other high end dining experience), minus a bit of the wizardry that makes Alinea special and at a slightly lower price.  I highly recommend a trip there before it closes later this year.  Service was impeccable, one anecdote can explain it all.  I spilled a tiny drop of syrup from the dessert course on my jacket cuff.  I noticed it, and started dabbing it with my napkin.  Without me saying a word, and within SECONDS, a waiter produced a shout wipe and presented it to me on a plate with another napkin.  Very impressive. The atmosphere of the place was really cool, modern decor, soft colorful lighting, and beautiful architecture.  We got a peek at the kitchen after dinner, and it was amazing to think that 20 amazing courses come from such a small room.  Really cool to see the chefs at work for a few minutes.   I did do the wine paring (my companions did not).  All the wine was great, but I am a bit of a novice when it comes to wine and I am not sure it was worth it (for me).  Next time I might just split a good bottle or two.",0.9984,0.725,0.245,0.029,0.5711882561882563

2012-01-23,5.0,"On January 20, 2012, I dined at Alinea.  It was one of the best meals I will ever live to enjoy, and I'm okay with that. For the first time, I find it impossible to fit both a thoughtful review and a complete log of my meal into 5000 characters.  I don't expect anyone to read all of this, but if you're interested, the full tour will be written below, with the remainder to follow. Michael K. snagged us a table for 9:15, weeks before we booked our flights for the bone chill of January in Chicago.  My flight cost $220.  My meal at Alinea $335.  I'll tell you which one I liked more in a second. With Janice K. and her sister Frances, we made a party of four.  We arrived a few minutes early and took advantage of the kitchen view while we waited.  Grant Achatz kept himself busy in the most spotless, populated kitchen I've ever seen.  When the time came, we were led to the downstairs dining room.  The atmosphere was cool and calm, and the space was modern and sparsely decorated, interesting but not distracting.  Our table got some flair from a captivating block of clear ice with magenta vial-shaped pockets.  We were told this was not edible. Service was worthy of all 3 Michelin stars.  Our head waiter Alex took care of us beautifully, with help from sommelier Ben, and waiters Johnny and Jeremiah.  They were personable, even jokey, while never straying from perfect competence and professionalism.  They presented every course in detail, and swept the table for crumbs after each dish was cleared.  We kept Alex and Ben up until almost 2AM, and they made us feel welcome, even liked, while they waited on us hand, foot, finger, toe. We ordered two of the cheaper bottles of wine on the menu (a $55 Riesling and a $65 Rioja) instead of springing for the pairing, and we had no regrets.  Otherwise, we were offered no choices, once we confirmed that we suffered neither aversions nor allergies.  The feast just poured in, blowing our minds one bite at a time. The first part of our meal was a poem in sea ink, opening with charred cured roe with coconut, carrot, and a curry yuzu reduction.  Other than the roe, nothing came in its original form, instead bringing soft textures that let the burst of roe take the tactile spotlight.  The light, sweet, salty, curry-tinged dish set the bar high.  Then came a presentation of shellfish on Malaysian driftwood draped with seaweed that told us the bar was there to stay.  An oyster leaf confused and delighted, topped with a shallot mignonette.  I hardly knew oyster could taste so much like oyster, never mind a single green leaf.  King crab with passionfruit, pineapple, hearts of palm, avocado, rum, allspice, and vanilla provided a playful run of sweet and tropical flavors, with a juicy chunk of crab at its center.  A long shell of razor clams marinated in XO sauce brought hearty Asian flavors with soy, shiso, and daikon.  I loved the way the firm chew of the clams was accented by an accompaniment of carrot and ginger tapioca.  The last shell on the driftwood held one of my favorite bites of the night - sea urchin with banana sabayon, black truffle, and coarse salt.  Sweet, silky, earth-and-sea-scented perfection. Seafood played a supporting role in the next course, which featured yuba, dehydrated and fried, wrapped around jumbo shrimp with chive, orange taffy, sesame seeds, and togarashi, dipped into a sweet miso emulsion.  There was crunch, there was snap; sesame seeds stuck to lips and tablecloth.  While we enjoyed the yuba, we watched dashi brew in a siphon.  The clear pot held seaweed, konbu, bonito, scallion, ginger, yuzu, and mirin, and when the broth was done, it was served with a delicate cube of scallop mousseline, fried to imitate agedashi tofu, garnished with cucumber, nasturtium, wasabi, carrot, chive, celery, and yuzu rind.  The scallop was utterly delicious, with a slight crust and creamy insides.  The broth and aromatics were irresistible, and I was glad when we got a cup of dashi to sip on.  A long metal antenna impaled our next course, a bite of Hungarian wooly ham and hibachi-grilled squid, with sherry, orange, and fennel, which we plucked with our teeth.  The tender squid fell just short of overpowering the ham, but they played together nicely. Then we drank our centerpiece.  It was filled with a sweet floral juice of beet, hibiscus, and Italian licorice, which we had standing with glass straws.  After that came an interlude of Sicilian family style dining, a way for Achatz to show that anything you can do, he can do better.  Moist, flaky, herb roasted Atlantic scup came filleted over garlic basil mint puree, with sides of panella chickpea crackers and caponata, and a ramekin of Sicilian sea salt.  The fish was perfectly cooked, and fritters were fun and crunchy.  The caponata was the ultimate rustic side, with firm eggplant and raisins, capers, olives, pine nuts, and celery.  The scup also came with wine - a pouring of French chardonnay, in ornate glasses. ***",0.9993,0.789,0.181,0.03,0.5223500309214593
2012-01-22,5.0,"Dinner at Alinea is probably the craziest meal I've ever had.  Really.  Throughout the evening, my awe was expressed in many ways:  chair dancing, jaw to floor, moaning and groaning, and constant eye rolls of pleasure, just to name a few. There's no way I can come close to describing with any real accuracy the intricacies of this extraordinary experience so I hope you find my photos and commentaries at least entertaining. Here are a few highlights: The table's centerpiece was a live garden.  Yes, let's start there.  A LIVE garden, on a slab, dirt and all, center of the table.  We were instructed not to do anything with it initially, but that it would come into play later in the meal.  Understood. First to arrive (that we were allowed to eat) was the steelhead roe with watermellon, kaffir lime and the cutest, teensiest, most delicate little cucumber with the blossom still attached.  Adorable. Then a fried morsel on a vanilla bean.  It's receptical was built specifically for the mad scientist, himself.   Then a massive seaweed platter holding 3 'sea' items.  First was an oyster leaf in an oyster shell with a mignonette.  That's right.  There was actually no oyster at all.   Just a leaf in a shell.  Tricky. Then a raw scallop with an ale and old bay foam.  Increadibly more delicious than I can convey. Then my first ever razor clam also with deliciousness too complicated to describe. Next was this little stick.  It was made from the skin that forms on the top of the 'whey' of tofu.  They peeled it off and deep fried it, then wrapped it with a wonderfully sweet prawn, rolled it in sesame seeds and stuck it in a fancy aioli.  Who thinks of this stuff? Then the English peas three ways.  When this 'bowl' arrived, it was hot and cold all at once.  You start with the top... Then open it up to find the freeze dried stuff with olive oil blobs and grapes... Then remove that section to discover a silky-smooth puree.  Unlike any pea soup I've ever had... I got quite excited for the next course when the marked our table with a pair of scissors.  I knew I was going to get to snip away at that center piece. I was right.  We added the baby chard, mizuna, thai basil, cilantro and more to our tomato heaven.  It was like eating soup and salad at the same time.  The flavor of the broth alone may have taken the cake for my fave course, and then add the fact that I get to play with my food by adding LIVE lettuces and herbs snipped from our own table garden?!  Whaaaaa?!!! This is what they like to call ""hands-free"" dining.  It's one little bite on a skewer that you simply remove with your mouth.  Yeah.  Fun.  Less important were the ingredients:  Mackerel, mango, bergamot flower and who knows what else. Then a little mushroom garden with a cream infused with pine (yes, pine... as in 'cone') and a bunch of other interesting ingredients.  I think they were going for a forest-in-your-mouth sensation.  Success. Oh!  And then there was ""hot potato, cold potato"".  A warm, creamy potato soup with a mini 'cold potato' on which a slice of black truffle rested.  There was also a little cube of butter and parm on the mini skewer which melted into the soup upon removing the skewer from its resting place.  All carefully dropped into the soup which was then gulped from the little bowl.  This one was fun too. Here's the fanciest little lamb dish you'll ever see.  I can't tell you all of the components but I can tell you that this was one to merit the chair dance.  Wonderful! A favorite at the table (and amongst Achatz followers) was the ""Truffle Explosion"".  A one bite raviolo filled with juicy truffle heaven.  It rested on a spoon that sat in a bowl that had no bottom.  Yes, a bowl built only to hold a spoon.  The garnish is a tiny romaine leaf, black truffle and shaved parm.  Ridiculously delicious. Here's a whacky one.  First, remove the glass plate containing a bunch of little garnishes like blackberry, fermented garlic and olives from its base. Then construct a devise with the tools provided on which to hang the pasta that was somehow snuck to your table in the form of a second center piece. Fill the pasta with decadent braised short ribs and strange garnishes of your choosing before wrapping it up and eating it like a taco.  See, I told you it was whacky. You can barely see the little octopus tentacle resting next to a smooth, set eggplant puree with coriander and more.  Take the bite then wash it down with the frothiness in the bowl. This was the intermezzo to clear the palatte.  Coconut snow with yuzu.  Just don't lick it directly from the frozen metal or you'll end up like Ralphy from ""A Christmas Story"".  Ouch. I loved this course, too!  All kinds of crazy stuff that a normal person would never pair.  There were squares of peach puree, basil, balsamic, jasmine, mozzarella, creme fraiche!  I was like a kid in a candy store...

But the presentation, staff and atmosphere were completely pretentious and pompous. The arrogant waiters really took away from the experience of our meal. When you pay $700+ for dinner - you expect to be treated like a king/queen not like a pauper by patronizing waiters! One of the waiters argued with my boyfriend about white and black not being a colors because he learned that in 1st grade. My boyfriend then asked him if something he had learned in grammar school went with what an adult male had learned until now. He got really defensive and then never came back to our table. My boyfriend is a loose cannon and can be confrontational with people that try to make him feel like an idiot.

We got it, and it definitely boosted our experience, but we were not aware that almost half of the wines were desert wines. Not my favorite. In fact, I get massive headaches. If we had known this ahead of time, I'm sure we would have asked for an abbreviated pairing without the desert wines. I bet they would have done that for us. If not, you really can't go wrong ordering a bottle of champagne to sip throughout the meal.  Small sidenote: If anyone went there this fall and took pictures of their food, would you mind sending me a message?

2012-01-10,4.0,"Ate at Alinea the same night at David L. and had the same food with three friends.  I agree with most of his review.  It is technically on point.  I break it down like this for those who don't like reading or know much about $700  a person restaurants... If you eat a lot of truffles, Asian street food, animal hearts, sea urchins, and not-so-everyday fruits and vegetables mixed in a juicer, you may find Alinea enjoyable, but not as inspired as advertised.  If you don't, you may be in for a bit of a palate shock. For an extremely expensive restaurant, Alinea delivers.  By the end of the meal, I found the $150 basic wine pairing (the reserve pairing was $250) along with its accompanying service to be the bargain and maybe highlight of the meal. For me, things broke down into thirds.  About a third of the courses were simply inegnious for creativity in presentation.  Winter in New Hampshire, the final dessert, and the Ice dish as the centerpiece were brilliant.  Another third were straightforward, but delicious.  The mushrooms led this category for me.  Finally, all the rest were a mix of lacking in creativity or simply good, but not great.  Since each night is different, I am curious if others sense the same kind of breakdown when they eat here.

2012-01-07,1.0,"Service:   5 Presentation:    5 Decor:  3 Taste and Flavor:   - 5  or Negative 5 ----------------------------------------- Simply put worst food any of us ever ate. Yes I am not a food expert but I trust my taste-buds and no they are not happy at all after eating at Alinea. All of us hated it. Great service and presentation but zero in taste, flavor and satisfaction. None of us will ever eat this stupid food (not sure if I even want to call it food) again, even if we are paid to eat it. I drank like 6 - 7 glasses of water/beverage to shove it down, thinking after every course that may be next would be better or may be just the final dessert would be better but no it also was tasteless, bitter. After tolerating the first 7 or 8 courses we started fearing what may come next and Alinea kept on delivering bad tasting dishes one after another. Most dishes were extremely salty and tasted like I am eating some pain relieving cream like Bengay. When the chef came to our table to put together the dessert he didn't look happy or excited at all but rather looked angry and not-interested. I guess that was planned to convey some kind of experience of shock or something when he just dropped the big ball of chocolate and frozen ice cream on our table and just walked away without saying anything, but I didn't like it one bit and rather felt it was stupid and rude. I would rather like the usual when the chef laughs and asks how was the food. Please save your hard earned money. Sandwich from my neighborhood Potbelly is better than this. If you really have money to burn then you are better off by simply donating that money or may be book a flight to see beautiful San Francisco and make a reservation to eat some real good food at ""Gary Danko"" instead of this junk. So much disappointed that we cancelled all of the next reservations, for second group of friends to follow after a few days. I fully understand and highly appreciate the amount of effort and dedication that goes in producing such a complex meal.

2012-01-07,5.0,"So first, me in a nutshell: - Will eat anything - Never been to Michelin restaurant before this - Even writes Yelp reviews for McDonald's As you can see, I don't exactly have the most refined taste. In fact, I hadn't even heard about Alinea until a few months ago, and I never in a million years expected to find myself here, athough I've drooled over the yelp pictures quite a few times. So I was literally speechless when my boyfriend brought me here for a belated birthday dinner, making me the luckiest girl ever :) PROS: Everything, which is something that I rarely say. My expectations for Alinea were through the roof to begin with, and high expectations are rarely met, not to mention exceeded. 1) Service - top notch. Humor/social-skills are definitely part of the servers' job description because everyone we encountered was personable and funny. They also seemed to have an innate sixth sense (or they were just eavesdropping constantly) because it was like they could tell when we needed to get up for the restroom. We even got a quick tour of the kitchen after our meal. 2) Decor - stunning. It felt like we were in a museum and we were afraid to touch anything. I hope my future house will be this pretty.  3) Favorite dishes - I was trying to pick a single favorite but gave up. - Venison: interactive make-your-own wrap. I had no idea what venison was until my bf explained that it was deer :( It's super tasty though. - Apple: piece of breaded brie/apple/onion skewered by a cinnamon stick. I'm going to go burn cinnamon sticks for decorations now. - Scup: family-style olive salad, chickpea chips, mint sauce, and a WHOLE fish. We were confused by this course since it's completely different from Alinea's otherwise minimalist style. Loved the salad and chips, and the fish was very tender. - Dark Chocolate: pumpkin ice cream-filled dark chocolate pinata. I'm a fan of all things pumpkin so I'm almost required to love this. This was the last course and although I was bursting inside, I kept wanting another spoonful. - Notable courses: scallop shaped like tofu (what is this nonsense), a bunch of spoons with different items on each (flavors meant to complement one another), a squid dish named ""woolly pig"" (confusing name), an ice sculpture (which was actually a course), and peppermint snow sitting on really cold rocks (I accidentally touched the rocks, ow). CONS: - Oyster leaf tasted like a leaf to me... - Too much truffle. Which isn't really a complaint because that's like a kid complaining about too much sweets. - A few of the dishes sauces were a touch too salty Overall, I'm thankful for an amazing experience.

2011-12-27,2.0,"Wow, what a disappointment. My wife and I went for our anniversary.  We are used to fine dining, having eaten at Daniel and Per Se in NYC, The Fat Duck in Bray, and Noma in Copenhagen, amongst other greats. We were expecting a lot from Alinea, being recommended to us as one of (if not THE) best restaurant in North America.  For those lofty expectations, we were crest fallen when they were not met. Perhaps it's our own fault for being overly hyped but the customer is never wrong, as they say.  If only every fine dining establishment followed that credo. My wife and I are young and even younger looking and we suffer for that at these type of establishments.  Ageism is prevalent among the servers in fine dining, especially in America.  How dare people of our age come to a restaurant of such pomp and circumstance? The snootiness was off the charts at Alinea.  The air was choked with pretentiousness and self satisfaction.  It was almost unbearable. If you go to a restaurant of that standing, or any restaurant for that matter, but especially one of such magnitude, the staff should be throwing themselves under your feet, especially when you consider what you're paying!  Instead everyone was glib and condescending.  We were extremely put off as we had never had an experience quite like that! That said, the food was excellent.  I believe we were able to separate the service from the cuisine.  On Yelp, I usually rank restaurants on the meal alone, because that is all that usually ever matters to me, but in this circumstance I think it is worth noting and changing my standards. The food I would give a 5 out of 5.  It really was fabulous.  That said, it wasn't quite as good as some of the aforementioned places above and not as great as I was expecting.  Still, it's certainly worth a try if you have the money to burn.  However, I would recommend staying away if you are under 30 or look younger than that.  They don't seem to appreciate that demographic at Alinea. And, for those who might think that the service was somehow a reflection on me or my wife.  She wore a stunning evening gown and I was in an Armani suit.  Despite their rudeness, we both kept our composure and were always polite, even when it was not deserved. I made sure of informing our hostess when we left, who offered her apologies but little else.  What did two twenty-somethings expect anyway? Well, for $900, I expected a lot more.  That's for sure!",0.8611,0.814,0.105,0.081,0.57046783625731

Some dishes were very memorable (came here in September so listing them out isn't relevant, nor do you get a choice of what to eat so the point is pretty much moot). Presentation was the same- some memorable, some I thought was the chef(s) just trying a bit too hard. There were a few bites I thought were spectacular and a few others that were forgettable. Everything else was in the middle.  We did the wine tasting (which was very good but definitely not necessary) and our tab was over $1,000 for two people. I would not go back if I was paying for it, as it was good but not as good as it should have been for the price.  Rating breakdown: -1 star for price: while a very tasty and interesting meal, with wine tasting I think the value of the meal is more around $700, not a thousand. My review would've been 4 stars, but: -1 star for sending me out of the restaurant the WRONG way: at the end of the meal we were asked if we wanted coffee or tea. I chose tea. I was very surprised to see a $4 charge on the bill for tea. When paying a thousand-dollar bill, being charged an additional $4 for hot water didn't leave a good taste in my mouth.

2011-12-20,4.0,"Maybe four and a half would be more appropriate. I can say that even with the hype and price tag, Alinea did not let me down.  We were fortunate enough to get placed on the wait list on a Tuesday and received a call back for dinner that Thursday night at 10:00. Based on my eavesdropping, there were a few tables in from out of town that had much more difficulty getting a reservation. The evening started a little oddly as the person that seated us was a bit pushy in trying to get us to do the wine tasting and kind of steered my wife into ordering one of their cocktails. Since we both had early mornings the next day, we opted against the pairing. At that point, I just asked for a beer and got the stink eye. They honestly made it seem like they had one beer left somewhere and that they would kindly dust it off for me. Thank you for my $12 dusty beer! Luckily, things picked up after that. The dishes have all been pretty documented. I will say that the seafood plate, the potato soup, and the truffle explosion were very memorable. Some others were just ok. There were two that I could take or leave.  All in all, I'm glad we came. As the night wore on, I think the servers loosened up and made it feel less formal and more fun.

2011-12-19,5.0,"I'm not going to go into too much detail about the dishes. Part of Alinea's appeal is the element of surprise. Centerpieces come and go, each anticipating some later dish to come but temporarily remaining enigmatic and vaguely inorganic objects vaguely conceivable as food. Things like Hot Potato Cold Potato and the Black Truffle Explosion are standard on the menu, but there remain many more spots throughout the twenty-ish courses for novel permutations of flavors. The wait staff is immaculately attentative and do a good job throughout the meal of offering explanations and backstories as to the chef's inspiration and intended concept.  What I really enjoyed about Chef Achatz's cuisine was that, besides being obviously avant-garde and exquisite, it's really just quite tasty. I'm a pretty adventurous eater, but at the end of the day I still tend to usually prefer food that's more on the comfort-food end of the spectrum. Despite the inventive presentation and combinations of flavors, many of the dishes I sampled here during my meal thrust forth flavors that were ultimately quite fundamental and familiar. Chef Achatz manages to retain essentially the heart and soul of many various cuisines from around the world and convey some core essence of the food despite dressing it up in his particular style.  There was nothing on my menu that I thought was particularly out-there in terms of its flavor notes, but days after my meal I'm still thinking about and craving this or that dish. Beyond the hype and aesthetics Alinea also excels at the substance of food, cooking each morsel to perfection and deftly distilling its flavor notes to a pure and robust core. If such a thing as a food high exists, Alinea provides it in spades.  My experience was lovely in every way, and I can't wait to come back again.",0.9939,0.858,0.142,0.0,0.534

Unfortunately, he was not there the night we visited which was May 4th my dad and L's son's birthday. My dad was bragging how his new wife fiance was taking him there. I am thinking to myself, sure surprise see you in two days. My dad almost cried when he saw I was there before him. So, it ended up being $2600 for 6 people. My dads fiance at the time wanted me to pay for the bill. I have never paid for my dads dinner as he is wealthy, I am not. So, I had my dads company card since I work for him. We tried to count how many courses we were at as we did the 24 courses. We lost track at 18. For me, it was nerve wracking not being that bright trying to figure out how to put things together. Think of it as a scientific food experiment. Is it as good as French Laundry? Yes, the waitstaff is super knowledgeable at Fl, which makes the service slightly better if you get a laugh out of the formalness as L and I do.  We were there until 230 but not the last table. Grant was not there because, he was getting a James Beard award. The kichen is spotless. The wine list is not as priced as nigh as French Laundry.   It was a memorable night to be at the #7 restaurant in the world. Well, worth it.

2011-12-13,5.0,"While it may be the topped ranked US restaurant in the San Pelligrino World's Top 50 List, Alinea (ranked world's sixth) is not the best food that I've ever had. In fact, I've had several meals where the food was better and at considerably lower price points. However, before you burn me at the stake for heresy, it was definitely the most unique dining experience I've had to date. In short, eating at Alinea is surreal. To simply say everything was visually stunning is an understatement and belittles what one experiences from dining there. A restaurant where presentation extends beyond just presentation and flavor into how the diner interacts with the creations is a vital component of what Alinea is. Interactions range from the relatively obvious to the surprising. For example, at one point a device was arranged on the table and we were instructed to guess its purpose. In other cases, we were provided instructions on how to consume the food. For one dish we assembled the ""conveyance"" for the food out of what appeared to be nothing more than a decorative trivet. This is food you contemplate; sustenance for the intellect as well as the senses.",0.9279,0.861,0.111,0.028,0.5107142857142857
2011-12-12,3.0,"The occasion: our 10-year anniversary. The destination: the one, the only, the legendary Alinea. The company: our friends, first-rate foodies who were looking for the right excuse. We were shown to a nice table surrounded by four comfortable chairs. As soon as we sat, a cartoon-like time-shift occurred: we slowed down while the staff around us went into a frenzy. They simply had no time. While I was in mid-sentence, they stepped in, placed a dish, explained the dish, and disappeared. All within a blink of an eye. We were left dumb-founded. Where did these dishes come from? What were the secret ingredients? How were they used? So many questions unanswered. The process repeated again and again. Dishes presented in haste. Explanations mumbled. Wine, seemingly unrelated to the food, was poured with little to no explanation. We never found out what two of the ten wines were. We tried. We really tried. We tried asking about the food. We tried asking about the wine. For our efforts we were rewarded with an additional five seconds of incoherent mumbling. My request to tell us more about the unusual caponata on my plate was answered: ""the eggplant is not pureed"". Much of the magic was gone. The conversation centered on all but the food. Ah, the food. Yes, I almost forgot the food. Twenty-courses ranging from the absolutely divine to the downright mediocre were placed in front of us, in a rapid 5-hour succession. From the heights of the razor-clam to the lows of the single oyster leaf. From a white-truffled risotto a notch above perfection, to a truffled pasta a notch below. From the sea urchin the likes of which I've never had to the cold borscht that plagued the meals of my childhood. ""Inconsistent"" would be the perfect word to describe our dining experience. Presentation won at the expense of taste. Dishes such as the squab were left for us to interpret and construct without the guiding wisdom of our host chef. The last desert, the dark chocolate, for all its pomposity was a meaningless collection of random tastes. We all agreed it simply did not work. The king is naked. Imagine a scale where price and hedonism battle for gravity's reach. We came looking for the ultimate decadent dining experience. We knew that the sum paid would be beyond the realms of logic and justification - Alinea complied. But the scales wouldn't balance. The hedonistic animal within us left unsatiated and ashamed. The food didn't reach the glorious promised peaks; the service didn't break the surface of polite friendliness; curiosity was not satisfied. We will have to keep looking.",0.9629,0.829,0.106,0.065,0.5253110253110252
2011-12-09,5.0,"Each year Restaurant Magazine compiles a Top 100 ranking of the world's best restaurants. In the 2011 edition Alinea came in at number one in North America and number six in the world (the top five venues are all in Europe with the number one ranking awarded to Denmark's Noma). I have yet to dine in any of the top five restaurants, but am having a very hard time envisioning a meal better than the wonderfully creative, phenomenal meal I just enjoyed at Alinea. Imagining food more exquisite is like trying to visualize a color that does not exist. After months of anticipation tonight was my birthday dinner at Alinea. The entrance to Alinea is nondescript and easy to miss. Once you open the unmarked door you stroll down a long modern hallway and eventually are greeted by a host; you are then ushered inside for the start of a magical culinary journey that is far more than just a great meal.  Alinea does not just have the best food in the U.S., but likely has the best staff as well. For our four hour long, twenty course meal we were completely pampered by our team of servers. Despite being such a high end venue, there is a fun vibe; the servers (despite being impeccably polished) are laid back, interact with you quite a bit and exhibit wonderful senses of humor; the experience is not at all pretentious as one may imagine. All the staff were great but Johnny in particular stood out as probably the best server we have ever had. Jason deserves kudos as well. My wife does not have the most adventurous palate, but the staff was very flexible with making substitutions.  Out of the twenty courses there was not a single dud. About a half dozen of them were so awesome they were mind blowing. Each course has such a unique presentation; the food looks like modern art,  but tastes better than any more traditional fare I have consumed. It is hard to do the food justice in a review as the experience of dining at Alinea really exercises all the senses and is a transcending experience; several of the courses even utilize non edible scents to interact with the taste of the cuisine (as well as to evoke memories) such as maple leaves that are scorched, creating the effluvium of burning leaves wafting throughout the dining room. I do not want to describe the courses in detail as being surprised magnifies the experience, but will touch upon a couple of highlights. The first few courses are seafood and the most beautiful was presented on piece of petrified driftwood draped with seaweed and topped with four delicious shellfish dishes artistically doctored up with different flavor components, still sitting inside their shell. The mushroom dish and the venison were my other favorite savories and all the dessert courses were amazing, but the final course - a sort of chocolate pinata broken open at your artistically decorated table (with an assortment of sauces) was out of this world.  Alinea does not have a full bar as Chef Achatz believes that hard alcohol would dull one's taste buds to the delicate flavor combinations of the food. There is a fairly large wine list and they offer a standard pairing ($160) or a reserve pairing (about $250) or wines by the glass, bottle and half bottle. While the food is expensive ($210 per/person), there are some reasonably priced wines (bottles start at about $55). My appreciation of fine food far exceeds my appreciation of fine wine and I was not made to feel at all bad for ordering one of the more inexpensive bottles of wine. There are also all sorts of different waters to choose from (including three different sparkling) and at the end of the meal coffee is served in a French press. To cap off our meal we were presented with a copy of the menu and a folder to safely tuck it inside. My wife had made Alinea aware it was my birthday and in addition to serving me an extra dessert course they even had a happy birthday message printed on my copy of the menu. We also were invited for a kitchen tour at the end of the meal and then were escorted outside by a staff member to a waiting taxi. Despite the experience lasting just over four hours it was one I did not want to end, but will take with me many happy memories (and a very full belly).  This was truly a meal fit for a king; the most beautiful food I have ever seen, some of the best food I have ever tasted and the best service I have received. I have now had the privilege of enjoying Grant Achatz' three main venues (Alinea, Next and The Aviary); Achatz is an absolute genius and is truly the master of modern cuisine. Someday I would like to try one of the restaurants in Europe that Restaurant Magazine has ranked as superior to Alinea but I am fairly confident that Alinea will remain number one in my book. I would not be surprised if Alinea ascends higher in the rankings before I make it to one of the other venues as I have the feeling that as good as Achatz is now, he is yet to reach his prime and somehow will continue to improve and set new trends.",0.9997,0.743,0.231,0.026,0.5397727606755384

Then you form the cabbage into a roll after adding miniaturized stew, veggies, and sauces--the chef's interpretation of Hungarian Goulash. While very few people would ever crave the food here, the cuisine is nothing if not cutting edge. The whole meal, all three plus hours of it, is quite the production.

Some food highlights: Everything was so festive for fall! -Pheasant + apples + fried dough + cinnamon--a bite of heaven I wish I had more of -Venison and cabbage burrito -Black truffle explosion -Hot potato Cold potato -Chocolate pinata...and epic dessert served to us by the man himself! The service was also a big part of the evening. Everything was choreographed perfectly. Dinner had an excellent rhythm. Each server brought their own personality to the table, and it was fun to hear their explanations of the food and wine. They kept the service playful--nothing was taken too seriously. Made the whole situation of dining at an expensive restaurant more comfortable. One of our earlier food courses that involved driftwood and shellfish was messed up 2 times (dropped a piece on our table) and they had to redo the presentation for us to make it perfect. I thought this was silly, but they insisted. Third time was a charm!  Anyway, I wish I could afford to come back here again during a different season. I hope to be back in my lifetime!

2011-11-20,5.0,"My third visit and as good as ever.  Highlight courses below but see the blog for full review: -- For the next course we received not only a bowl but also a story and when it was all said and done ""Brook trout reflections of Steve Stallard"" would prove to be the second best dish I have ever had at Alinea.  Named as an ode to Chef Achatz's friend who normally provides his whole harvest of Brook Trout roe to Alinea this dish opted to pair the roe with the entirety of the fish - head, spine, tail, fillets, and fins - in a glass bowl along with Michigan maple syrup, pecans, wild puffed rice, nasturtium flowers, and white beans both whole and pureed.  Again complicated in a way that very few can achieve with such finesse this was the sort of dish where each bite presented an entirely different experience - some intense and briny while others were creamy and sweet with the best for myself being half of the maple syrup bubble paired with a dollop of roe, a bit of the bean puree, and the crispy fish head in a single spoonful. -- For the pillow course a dish entitled ""Wild Mushrooms, pine, sumac, ramp"" would arrive featuring Matisutake, Maitake, Chanterelle, and Hon Shimeji mushrooms in varying degrees of preparation mixed with pine cream, Sumac Breadcrumbs, pickled ramps, fried shallots, thyme, wild lettuce, and mushroom reduction.  Slightly awkward as it always is eating off of a pillow the dish was presented with jokes about one of the servers frequently dumping this plate on guests (""just joking, just joking"") but once the pillow deflated a bit filling the air with the light essence of vaporized pine this course would prove to be my second favorite of the evening, a flawless ""woodsy"" amalgam that trumped even the much raved ""Walk in the Forest"" at Next the following day. -- For the next savory course Chef Achatz would find inspiration in a London housed painting by Miro for a tabletop arrangement appropriately titled ""Squab inspired by Miro.""  Beginning first by spraying and polishing the table with black tea this course was presented with nine forks and spoons arranged 'as random as possible' and containing ""Squab, Foie Gras...and the rest is for you to figure out"" as two large vessels spewed forth a light lavender aroma that washed over the table and permeated the air.  With no specific instructions on how to eat this save for placing the used utensils in the silver vessels the next six minutes would prove an adventurous blind tasting of squab, foie gras, celery root with pumpernickel, Picholine olive, lavender noodle, duck fat with blis vinegar, yellow plum, and fig - all but the noodle and duck fat being guessed spot on by our trio and all in all a great bit of fun. --- For the final presentation of the evening the silpat would arrive first followed shortly thereafter by two large chocolate colored vessels, a quartet of small bowls, a steaming pot of liquid nitrogen, and finally by Chef Achatz with apron surprisingly stained and face appearing slightly sullen and stern without speaking a word (a trend we noted with each of the other tabletop presentations in the room as well.)  Beginning first by placing the two vessels at the center of the table and filling each with an ample amount of liquid nitrogen Chef Achatz next proceeded to drizzle the table with reductions of Lingonberry Syrup, Citrus and butternut squash reduction, and Goose Island Caramel Stout before dusting the entirety of the table with edible citrus marigold flowers and subsequently lifting each of the vessels and dropping them to the table where they shattered releasing contents that can best be described as the result of breaking open a child's Halloween basket or perhaps a piñata. With chocolate notes predominating some bites while flavors of the squash, berries, and stout punctuated others this enormous dessert went slowly - easily over the course of twenty to thirty minutes as we playfully explored its contents; everything from cotton candy and fruit roll-ups to cookies and candies such as house made twizzlers and corn nuts.  With bites of brioche, balls of butterscotch, and crumbles tasting both like gingerbread and kettle corn rounding out the experience all I can say is that was a dessert as well suited for a child's dream as it was for fine dining and as we finished the final spoonfuls our server stopped by with a look of surprise stating ""wow, I don't think I've ever seen anyone clean the table quite so well."" --",0.9978,0.845,0.127,0.028,0.45668707482993187
2011-11-19,5.0,"Alinea is a high cuisine molecular gastronomy restaurant, so if you order soup it could come freeze dried or in a cube. This was my first experience of eating at a molecular gastronomy restaurant so I was very interested to see how the food was prepared and how it tasted and none of it is what I expected. You might as well throw out every idea of a normal idea of going to a restaurant. It's location, near the Steppenwolf theatre is in a nice area of the city, it's formal attire, and of course, the only shirt I brought with me to Chicago doesn't close at the neck, but as it's a fancy shirt I get away with the tie and unbuttoned neckline. All staff are finely dressed and we were seated at a black wooden table with very comfy upholstered chairs. There is a pumpkin in the middle of the table. We were told we weren't getting a menu until after the meal. So there was no ""I'll have the fish"" you don't order here, you get what your given. After a quick check that none of us have any allergies the meal arrives in 3 hours (yes 3 hours!) worth of molecular constructed courses.  After drinks orders we are told that the first course is already in front of us, the waiter lifts up the pumpkin and underneath is our first course, an amuse bouche of pumpkin, curry sage and coconut. After this we get a wooden block full of seaweed with 4 sea shell on top all with different things. We are told the recommended order in which to eat them and also that all should be taken in one bite.  Over the course of the next 3 hours many different dishes in different formats arrive, so much that I can't in my semi jet-lagged state can hardly keep up with (and this review would go on forever!!). At one point a glass chemical pot is placed in the middle of the table and a Bunsen burner placed underneath, we are told by the waiter he's not allowed say anymore. The water at the bottle of the jar is boiled and goes up a tube to the top of the jar which has a a variety of vegetables. The water suddenly drops down to the bottom jar and this is repeated while we dine on other courses. Eventually we are given a tofu scallop and the waiter takes out the bottom jar and pours it on the tofu, this is the broth for the dish. There is a ""hands free"" dish which is set on the top of an antenna you suck off, some fried pigeon on the bottom of a branch with the leaves a little burnt to give an Autumn aroma, red cabbage leaves are left sitting in the middle of the table, very unappetising looking, as the waiter says ""looks like a sliced section of a brain."" This eventually turns out to be the cabbage leaf in which other components are wrapped in. A mushroom dish was brought out on a pillow which had a scent of pine to give the feel of being in the woods. One dish came on a assortment of forks and spoons designed into the shape of a leaf on the table, and you ate one fork/spoon at the time. One you suck out of a test-tube which surprises us all by bolting into our mouths. The finale though, was something else. We were given yuzu in a metal cone the texture of snow to clean our palettes. A dish of squares on a plate was the first dessert course. We are encouraged the mix and match the squares. One square is pear, another balsamic vinegar, I think there was an olive in there somewhere. Then the waiters come out and put a tablecloth down. A jar with liquid nitrogen is brought our and a chocolate dome and 3 dishes of sauces. Two of the chefs come out and start saucing the tablecloth. The liquid nitrogen is poured into the chocolate domes and the chefs smash the domes in the middle of the table. Inside there's butternut squash, pumpkin, cotton candy and god knows what else. You mix with the sauces. The taste of the food in general was exquisite, some better than others. Some to me just tasted chemically. Others like the pigeon and the dessert, were astounding. And it's not just about the food at Alinea. It's a show, it's a performance with food as the main character. This is cuisine on the edge. If you are starving and need a good satisfying dinner get yourself a steak somewhere, but if you want a completely unique dining experience this place is an experience. I won't mention the bill as I wasn't the one paying, but the cost of a meal for 4 was substantial.",0.99,0.898,0.079,0.023,0.4445178197064989

2011-11-10,4.0,"For me, dining at Alinea is like going to hear Pavarotti sing at the Metropolitan Opera. Something I don't need to experience a lot of times or even two perhaps. It is an experience that is unparalleled and unduplicated live and in the moment but not something I crave or want more of at all. The experience at Alinea preys on one of our most basic human weak points: anticipation. After you get surprised (I won't ruin it) the first time, you are constantly looking at the vessels put down in from of you before the actual food comes and you begin to wonder and guess what could be next. That is a unique part of the Alinea experience compared to ANY other place I have ever been to.    The dining experience we all know well and can relate to consists of the acts of: seeing food, smelling food and then tasting food. (To Yelpers, there is one more: writing about food :-)  SEEING  the food here is like no place else. The presentation may seem whimsical but probably could not be more thought out. Every dish is a piece of art unto itself. No two plates were the same and there is a conscious decision for none of them to be even similar. The custom tableware items are essentially ""serving canvases"". They are mediums to help enhance the presentation and are often an integral part of each course. Discussing them in depth here I think would take away part of the experience. Once again, the anticipation was one for the best parts of the meal so I will not go into detail here but I am sure other reviewers have. Just rest assured, you WILL be surprised and you WILL be impressed. The SMELLS of the courses at Alinea were like nowhere else I have ever been. Some of the smells they used did not come from anything that was actually consumed in that particular course. When was the last time or have you ever had someone tell you:  ""Here, smell this but you are not eating this. That is just for smell. This part over here, this is for eating.""? You haven't. I haven't and 99.9% of the world hasn't. It's because it doesn't make any sense to us and we have never been forced to consider it...until a place like this comes along and shows you what the experience can be like. You will TASTE things here that you have never tasted before and you will taste things here in ways that you have never tasted them before. They are not traditionally slow cooking and developing flavors here. The chef has very specific tastes that he is trying to impart on the diners. Most of these tastes and some of these flavors, I have never experienced.  Every dish had multiple components. Some worked. Some didn't. Some had very specific instructions on how to eat them, others were specific that there weren't any instructions on how to eat them, which actually made those instructions specific.  After most courses, we shook are head in agreement that there was ""a lot going on there""  or ""that was good"" but few courses left us wanting more of any particular dish even though some were only one bite.  As far as a ""Dining Experience"" goes, Alinea is tops. If this where food is heading, it will be an interesting ride but part of the a conversation that we had was that this is the ULTIMATE gluttonous and selfish experience. You are not coming here because you are hungry, you are coming here because you want to be surprised, pleased & entertained. It gives new meaning to ""Dinner Theater"" . It is worth noting that while the service was impeccable and I do mean IMPECCABLE, there is a distinct lack of warmness and personal experience that you get at other similar caliber restaurants (Le Bernadin & Daniel).  We left realizing that no one ever asked us ONE question about ourselves besides ""Do you have any allergies?"". When have you ever been anywhere and them not ask you where you were from or if you were celebrating anything, etc... As much as Alinea exploits our basic weakness for anticipation, it neglects our more basic need to feel like we belong, are liked or are important.  None of which is the responsibility of a restaurant but why bother trying so hard with EVERYTHING ELSE just to let this not even be considered. Once again, you eat here for the experience. Having the diner feel like you actually care about them and their experience (which you are creating)  is just as important as anything else.  When you spend $700 on dinner, I don't care who you are, you wouldn't mind someone asking your name. There is an incredible amount of time and effort that goes into every presentation here and that alone is worth the price of admission.  However, for me,  ""Best Restaurant in America"", is somewhere I would want to eat in again.

2011-11-09,5.0,"THE FOOD: In a word: spectacular.  I didn't love everything equally, but I did enjoy every bite, and at least half of them were so intensely flavorful, complex and well balanced that I had to close my eyes and take a moment to process the experience fully.  I've had a handful of culinary moments like that in my life, but never so many at one meal.  There were no mistakes, missteps, under/over cooked ingredients, under/over seasoned dishes, etc.  At this price level, I expect a lot of attention to detail, and sadly, I'm often disappointed; but not here.  Everything was implemented perfectly (from my subjective point of view).  In fact, the food was so good, I am inspired to spend time and energy cooking from the Alinea cookbook.  Even though many of the recipes are beyond fussy, I want to try because it's fun.  Yes, you can have fun with your food, and you don't have to throw it in order to do so. THE SERVICE: The servers cooperate, so we didn't have just one.  That was nice because we were never feeling like we were ""waiting"" for our ""waiter"", so to speak.  Everyone was polite, friendly and relaxed; but they were all focused and busy.  I loved the service here.  Alhough they were attentive to our needs, they were never intrusive.  Because of the cooperating arrangement between the servers, perhaps the overall impression was a bit ""cold"" compared to your typical family style restaurant.  Even so, it was MUCH more relaxed and anjoyable than the usual stuffy, pretentious ""high-end"" european-style dining room. THE ATMOSPHERE: The environment is hyper-modern, in a MOMA kind of way, which can be good or bad depending on your preference.  To me, the setting fit the contemporary nature of the menu, but I would have liked more light on the food so I could better appreciate its visual appeal.  The dining rooms are separated so that each one only has a few tables, which makes for an intimate environment.  The chairs are comfy and the table is very stable.  They took care to craft each part of the environment in such a way as to enable diners to focus on enjoying the food without being distracted by anything else. THE COST: The comment I get most when I tell people I ate here is, holy crap, that's an expensive meal; was the food made of gold or something?  But to me it was worth it.  If you consider that I had 20 courses served over 4 hours, and you consider how much effort (and premium ingredient) went into those courses, then the whole experience begins to feel more like dinner theater, but in a way that engages all of my senses.  I haven't eaten at many restaurants in this price range, so i can't comment on what this price can get you elsewhere.  But it's hard to imagine getting more variety of better quality.  Maybe you can and I just don't know it. OVERALL: If I could give it 6 stars, I would.  I have rated far lesser places 5 stars; since there is only a single rating to cover the entire experience, it's really about overall value.  Despite not being wealthy, my wife and I plan to return to Chicago next summer just to eat here.  Of course we will find other fun things to do too, but revisiting Alinea is our real reason for coming back to Chicago.",0.9987,0.758,0.196,0.046,0.4950850340136056

2011-11-01,3.0,"I'd probably give this a 4-star rating, if not for the fact that it's a $500 meal after wine and should have absolutely knocked my socks off in the same way other meals of that caliber have. I went in with high expectations -- in terms of inventiveness, those expectations were met, but in terms of food, there was a great deal of inconsistency. The mushroom dish, the brook trout and the sea bream (for which he ventured away from modern cuisine) were all excellent dishes.  The rest was merely overwrought and engineered for engineering sake, often at the cost of flavor.  For example, the scallop acting as agedashi tofu was a perfect success in what the chef had sought out to do, specifically that a scallop had been robbed of its texture and flavor and rendered into a non-vegetarian imitation of tofu (though the table-brewed broth was very nice).  The yuba, while relatively well-flavored and craftily served, was not up to the standards I would expect for such a meal.  Hot potato, cold potato was overwhelmed by truffle in a way that so many chefs feel the need to do with truffle dishes.  The venison, let's face it, is basically a game-meat version of a lettuce wrap with just a fancy rack.  The first dessert had okay flavors, but most seemed to have been lost in the cubism.  The final dessert -- a dark chocolate ""pinata"" filled with liquid nitrogen frozen pumpkin pie, fluff, and meringues -- was the final in spectacular presentation with too little flavor; not even the dark chocolate shell offered much for the taste buds.  The wine pairings were good but not superb.   The ambiance was inappropriate for a culinary experience like no other.  We were seated at a very strange table -- over-sized for two to sit across from each other, but not appropriate for two to sit at one corner due to its banquette location.  The lighting was over-bright, which was surprising given the entrance and foyer lighting was quite the opposite.  Generally speaking, I'm not sure that I would ever consider using the downstairs front dining room as a dining room except for private functions. The service staff was aloof and haughty, and not in the way one would expect for a world class restaurant -- and certainly not in the way one would expect for an innovative restaurant.

The service, presentation of the dishes, flavor combinations, everything was just spectacular. It's an experience like none other. My favorite part of the dinner was the dessert. The chef comes out and makes it for you right on your table! I wish I could come back here for dinner every month, if only it wasn't incredibly expensive.  All in all, chef Grant Achatz does an amazing job. I would definitely recommend all my friends to atleast dine at his restaurant once!",0.9753,0.779,0.189,0.032,0.6025910364145658
2011-10-24,5.0,"BEST. MEAL. EVER. We made reservations 3 months ago.  I saw how much it was going to cost, and it was going to be more than any meal I had ever eaten in my life.  And I had heard amazing things from everyone who had been here before me.  My expectations could NOT have been higher, and I'm VERY happy to say that I walked out even more satisfied than I could have imagined. Every dish was imaginative and creative, all featuring different ingredients -- very few of the components of the 20 dishes were repeats -- and a wide variety of preparations.  Many of the dishes had a whimsical feel to them, and the food runners all had a light sense of humor that kept the meal from being too stuffy, which you would expect from a place this fancy (JACKETS REQUIRED!!).  Only our sommelier was a bit too serious, but I guess that was understandable.  As an example of the whimsy, there was a big pumpkin sitting at our table when we got there.  When we were ready to start our meal, it looked like the waiter was taking the pumpkin off the table to make room for food, but when he lifted the pumpkin, there were four little squares of the most delicious pumpkin cake that I had ever had, with a bit of Thai chili for kick -- great way to start off our meal. That was followed my more and more delicious dishes, and there wasn't a clunker in the whole menu of 20 dishes!  My favorites were a razor clam appetizer with XO sauce, the mushrooms with red wine sauce (probably the best mushrooms I've ever had), a Sicilian ""swordfish wheel,"" and the famous ""Hot Potato, Cold Potato"" and black truffle explosion.  Some dishes were small, some were larger, but the meal had so many of the best bites of food I've ever eaten before. The meal ended as uniquely as it started.  The waiters came out and put a fancy, rubbery tablecloth on our wood table.  Then, two chefs came out with two coconut-sized spheres (made of chocolate) and steaming, halloween-like steins (filled with liquid nitrogen).  The two chefs poured the liquid nitrogen into the balls, and then followed that by covering the table with some mind-blowing fall-themed sauces -- a lingonberry sauce, a butternut squash syrup, and stout (or porter) reduction.  The chefs then picked up the balls and dropped them on the table, chocolate bits and random stuff inside the balls flying everywhere on the table.  It was like a frozen pinata, full of little treats like frozen french toast squares, nutmeg cotton candy, meringues, frozen cream cheese bits, and some other interesting, delicious bites that we dipped in all of the sauces.  We ate it all right off the table, mostly with our hands.    The meal took four and a half hours, but felt perfectly paced with impeccable service.  We got the menus at the end, but I've debated many times whether I liked seeing the menu at the end, or whether I would've liked to have known what was coming. We had heard that there were 24 courses so we kept counting them, and didn't really know how many more savory dishes were coming before desserts.   Only two drawbacks on the night: (1) they don't have a full bar, so you can't have a cocktail before or during your meal, especially considering all of the amazing cocktails I've heard are served at Aviary; and (2) the wine pairing was a ridiculous $260 per person, which was even more than the meal.  While I love wine, I can't justify paying that much for a wine pairing, especially when the meal is already expensive. We did, however, enjoy two delicious bottles of red wine that the sommelier helped us pick out.  I cannot recommend Alinea highly enough for a once-in-a-lifetime meal and overall experience.",0.9988,0.834,0.156,0.01,0.5967213642213642
2011-10-20,5.0,"Comparing an Alinea experience to any other meal is dangerous. As such, I'm not going to call what I had at Alinea ""a meal."" Rather, what I had was a tour of culinary technique, paced over several hours, administered by unflappably polite and knowledgeable staff, in a refined and comfortable setting. This tour was one of the most memorable things I've ever done. The quality of what was served and how it was served left clearer imprints on my mind than any other food I've ever eaten. This was due to the fact that each of the eighteen courses was willfully prepared and stunningly arranged. The entirety of the staff endeavored towards a single end for every morsel of food prepared. And the result of that unified clarity of purpose resulted in clarity of flavor, clarity of texture, and clarity of presentation. Years from now, when I look back on this experience, the footprints left in my mind will be as deep and defined as they are now. Such is the result of the care and genius that the staff of Alinea demonstrates. I thank them a thousand times over for it, and strongly encourage all those who can to experience it themselves.",0.9764,0.84,0.146,0.014,0.4262566137566138
2011-10-19,5.0,I'm not really sure what else I could say about Alinea that would stand out from the other reviews. I will say these few points: - It was the highest quality dining experience I have ever had. From the food to the service to the quality of ingredients to the ambiance to the waitstaff. Just exquisite. - It's pricey. Yeah. I work hard for my money and I couldn't imagine anything else I'd want to spend it on. - Pay attention to the small things. Everything is something at Alinea. - Their sommelier was incredibly knowledgeable. Listen to every word. - Don't take pictures. It's obnoxious and tacky. I am a photog and it killed me not to snap away but I knew I was a more astute diner because of it.,-0.611,0.905,0.023,0.072,0.5605555555555556
2011-10-18,5.0,"This was literally the best meal of my life (surpassing my previous best at Daniel in NYC). And yes, I literally flew to Chicago to eat here on the recommendation from my parents. I think the highlight for me was how interesting the food was. I was very anxious for each course to continue to come out so I could see what it would be. I was also a huge fan of the bite-sized nature of many of the courses- most degustations leave me feeling completely stuffed and struggling to try things. Alinea left me feeling pleasantly full, even though I got to try everything. As far as specific dishes go- I loved the black truffle explosion. I also thought the course with several different types of seafood on drift wood was well done, and I definitely couldn't get over harvesting my own table centerpiece garden during dinner. I'll leave it at that. I suppose the lowest point for me was one of the traditional lamb dishes- I just wasn't in love with it. It wasn't bad, I'm just not a huge lamb person. Seriously, if you're in Chicago, go here. If you aren't in Chicago, consider going to go Chicago so you can go here. And yes, it's expensive.

2011-10-09,5.0,"No matter who you are or what your experience at Alinea, the food stands alone in excellence.  SO, despite us being a little disappointed in our dinner, I recognize that the expectation was SO HIGH, that Alinea could have never met it. Also: be prepared for price.  Our dinner was $1100 when it was all said and done. 5 stars all the way for the food and knowledge of the wait staff.  Incredible. Few rules to follow: 1. Keep your imagination in check!  The food is great, but it won't change your life. 2. Wine pairing: STAY AWAY!! It's not worth the price, especially for the Reserve Pairing which we opted for.  Fellow Yelpers were spot-on with this. 3. Don't come with alot of conversation topics for your fellow diners: The atmosphere is very quiet, and somewhat cold.  Focus on the food and you'll be good to go. I will never go back to Alinea, because frankly I cannot afford it, but I'm so happy we chose to experience it once in our lives.",0.9317,0.86,0.102,0.038,0.5902564102564103

The Frozen Yuzu was also amazing. Thanks Grant, for ruining my life. If only I could get Yuzu italian Ice on demand. 3) I get it; it's stuffy.  But if you aren't, the staff will chill out and give some personality back! They are still beyond professional, but they're human! I know there were like 10 people waiting on us, but they were pretty funny and laughed with us when we didn't know how to eat some of the things we were served.

2011-10-01,5.0,"Like the other hundreds of reviewers, i too thought this restaurant was in a league of its own. It is a very different experience than a french laundry or per se given it is gastronomy but eat here once before you die or multiple if you are so lucky. It is truly differentiated in its service, food and creativity, Grant Achatz is one extremely gifted chef and a thought leader in a the arena of food worldwide. The only thing i will tell you about the food is that no matter what sample menu you see on websites or elsewhere, nothing tastes like it sounds, everything is an elaborate experience. They have also customized all their plates and cutlery to be fitted for all that they do. Call exactly 2 months before when they start taking reservations and get one at 6pm because you aren't going to leave before 9pm. If you have dietary restrictions, TELL THEM. They are very good about customizing your menu but you really do need to tell them in advance. Each dish is small so you will leave feeling satisfied without being stuffed, they have perfected this in a way i have seen no one else do. They will give you a copy of the menu when you leave with all that you ate.  Service: they section off the restaurant so wait staffs of 8 (maybe less) are only serving 4 tables at once.  What this translates to is impeccable service. It is slightly creepy because there is always someone in the room if not 2-3 people so as soon as you are done with a dish, it is off your table before you know it. They also fill water so fast that my water glass never actually got below full. They clean the bathroom after each use. You are not allowed to use flash photography, i found this out by embarrassing myself so please don't do that. The servers are very quiet, they stare at you so you are not alone and you are aware of that but if you try to make conversation i found them to be pretty straight forward, they answer then disappear. I suppose that is just part of the experience where the focus is the food. I could tell you all that i ate but it is very difficult to explain in words so instead i'm uploading the pics i took and you can look at them which i is actually a much better way to try and understand what you'll be eating. Basically you taste things you never thought should go together  and flavors you have never had before. The best part was dessert where Achatz came out and did the dessert creation on our table, there are many videos of this on youtube but it was really cool to see in person. Go to this restaurant, it is a foodie's dream.",0.9926,0.821,0.135,0.044,0.5941397849462365
2011-09-29,5.0,"It's going to be long.  Must be brief to fit the experience in 5001 characters. Alinea is a special occasion kinda place.  Before you can dine here you must get a reservation here.  The trick is they open up reservations two months in advance so if you want to eat in March you better call Jan 1 to snag that spot up (especially if it's a weekend).  You've got your reservations? Great! It's located in a building that's pretty nondescript.  During the day my friend described it as...""shady looking.""  In the evening there will be a tiny sign for Valet Service ($11).  Unless you're lucky and there's a spot open, why not just Valet (You're already splurging on this epic meal.)  Oh yea...formal jackets required...don't be a bum! The interior looks like an upscale office.  Tell them your name and reservation time and off you go to your seats!  They'll take your valet card so they can prep your car when your meal is ending or call you a cab if that's the route you went.  Service!  They only do wines so don't expect cocktails.  Wine pairings ranged from 160 to 250.  Ok Food!  Warning that there will be some spoilers! Steelhead Roe sitting on a bed of watermelon mousse, wrapped in watermelon flesh and finished off with watermelon consume poured in with an edible flower.  Wonderful starter that was mostly sweet, but light elements of savory. Hamachi bite that had pineapple salt, ginger, west indie spices, and kaffir lime with Vanilla Bean Stick for holder.  Complex flavors here.  It was sweet, but also sour from the kaffir, then salty and rich from the hamachi.  Another good opening to get your tastebuds going. At this point they brought out what looked like fruit rollups and set them down and told us we'd deal with them later...intrigue! The next dish was a quad that we were supposed to eat in a specific order.  The presentation was these 4 shellfish sitting on kelp sitting on this driftwood. Oyster Leaf topped with a mignonette.  Leaves that taste like oysters! Taylor Bay Scallop with old bay oil and a white ale foam.  One of the highlight bites of the night.  The scallop was juicy and firm and had an overall richness of flavor. Top Neck Clam with an xo sauce and carrot and ginger tapiocas.  This reminded me of Asian cuisine with the xo sauce and the salty flavors. Mussel with saffron, chorizo, and orange.  The mussel was sitting in the shell and the other flavors were these cubes that sat on top of it so as you chewed the flavors got intense based on which cube you were hitting. Yuba (tofu skin) with shrimp and a miso mayo dip.  They dried it, rolled it up, and deep fried it to create a stick then wrapped a shrimp around it and placed it in a holder that had a well of miso mayo dipping sauce.  Chip and dip! Mackerel bite with juniper, radish flower, and mango.  We were just to chomp down and slide the bite off the wire.  Great layers to the flavors.  Salty richness from the mackeral moving down to the sweet mango. Wild Mushrooms dish.  A mixture of wild mushrooms with sumac, pine, and ramps.  The mushrooms individually had great earthy flavors, but it didn't come together as a whole for me. Hot Potato, cold potato, black truffle, butter...one of the winners of the night.  Small wax bowl with a wire in it that has a potato sphere with a black truffle cap, a cube of butter, and a cube of something else.  You pull the wire out so everything falls in and then take the whole bite.  Wow, great bite. Lamb Loin with lamb jous reduction and béarnaise along with mini potato spheres.  There were 2 small lamb loin medallions topped with a slice of artichoke heart and 2 small asparagus tips.  This sat on a crunchy, flaky disc.  On the center and sides were the jous and sauce to dip in. Short Rib, olive, fermented garlic, fresh blackberry, smoked salt, white wine radish, tobacco agar...this is where those flags come in play.  Make your own wrap with all this stuff.  Also you get to make the holder for the tomato pasta and the engineer in me got happy. Black Truffle explosion.  Winner!  Single bit of ravioli with liquid truffle inside...that is all Octopus with eggplant mousse and soup.  Also great, the mousse was awesome. Yuzu Snow.  Palette cleanser.  Sprayed yuzu mist over a super cold dish to create snow.  You scrape to create a granita.  Refreshing. Peach, jasmine, basil, balsamic, mozzarella cubes.  Think caprese salad.  Basil cubes and mozzarella ice cream were win. Lemongrass juice, dragonfruit, and herbs.  A tube where you sucked down this refreshing liquid. Chocolate mousse, red pepper, bitter orange, banana rum brulee, and rum cake.  The chefs came out to create this art on the table for us.  The mousse was frozen in liquid nitro.  Lots of fun to watch and eat! Servers were warm, funny, joked with us.  It was awesome.  They told us we were sitting at Zac Efron's table but were more fun.  Our sommelier was passionate, knowledgeable, and talked like a motorboat.  Running out of chars.  So TRY IT!",0.9994,0.813,0.176,0.011,0.5295132912602791

2011-09-23,5.0,"BEST meal i have ever eaten in my life. Not only is each dish presented in a unique & beautiful way, turning food into art, but each dish tastes as good as it looks!  Not a single dish was disappointing. 5 stars to each and EVERY dish...only downside is that most of the courses are literally ONE bite.  So after eating that bite, you wish you had more to enjoy, but that's it....just ONE bite.  The meal is 22 courses, but you won't feel stuffed when you leave due to size of course.  We went in a group of 6 (max # they will take)..and the experience lasted 4 hours.  There are 2 sizes for wine pairings you can add ($160 additional, or $100 additional for 2/3 the pour of each wine).  It's too bad they don't have a non-alcoholic pairing.  They had this cranberry/pomegranate juice mix that was delicious...a little fizzy, a bit tart, but mostly sweet. This is the first restaurant I have been to without a sign!  I guess it's so well known that it doesn't need any more attention than it already has...so don't be surprised if you drive by a regular looking building.  Only sign with the restaurant name is the valet sign.   Reservation process: On the 1st of each month, phone lines open for booking 2 months later.  You will have to call and hang up repeatedly until you get through...and when you do, you'll be put on hold.  But..it's WORTH IT.   Regarding the meal (see pics for each course):  No bread, no amuse busche.  Just start off with the first course and finish through.  Favorites: Mussel, razor clam, hot potato/cold potato, black truffle explosion, & yuba.  Some of the dishes are very playful...as in you ""play with your food."" Others are displayed in a unique way, such as ""antennae,"" where the yellowtail snapper is hanging from a wire & you eat it without using hands.  ""Lemongrass"" looks like a mini-fishtank, or what reviews call food in a test-tube.  The ends are sealed with a jelly/ dragonfruit so the contents don't spill out.  You suck on it like a straw and everything (mostly liquid contents) fall into your mouth.  Lastly, there is a dessert finale where they plate the whole thing on your table (lined w/ silicon sheet).  Pay attention to the WHITE liquid!  Small detail you might miss if you aren't observant.  When they put this liquid on the table, it forms SQUARES, not circles like most liquids do!!  Super cool!  The chocolate mousse dipped in liquid nitrogen tastes better when it melts a little b/c it is similar to chocolate ice cream; in the beginning, it has more of a ""dry"" crunch taste.  It's also cool to watch them turn the banana cream liquid into creme brulee right in front of you. DO NOT READ ON IF YOU DON'T WANT SURPRISE SPOILERS regarding playing with food.  When we first sat down, our waiter brought us what he called ""centerpieces.""  Looked like a little baby garden grown on a rock with soil.  He told us it was for decoration...and not to eat or touch it.  Later, this centerpiece actually became our salad! (They bring you a baby pair of scissors & u cut your own greens and place it in the bowl of dressing & tomatoes...which we originally thought was a soup).  I loved the element of surprise.  There is another dish (short rib) where you have to assemble the plate and add the ingredients to make your own giant ravioli.  (DO NOT ADD TOO MUCH SALT...i mistakenly added all of each ingredient..which is fine..but don't add all of the salt).  There is a dish called hot potato/cold potato, where there is a pin that holds a fried hot potato ball on it among other things...you pull the pin down and out, and the hot contents fall into the cold potato soup below it and you take the whole thing like a shot so you have the sensation of both temperatures in your mouth. Very cool.  Lastly, there's a dessert dish where there are different colored cubes which represent different flavors.  You get to choose, mix & match the cubes, to blend the flavors in your mouth.  Choose wisely, b/c not all combinations go well together..haha.  After reading this, I might have ruined the surprises, but it'll still be very fun.   Loved Alinea, loved the food, the service, the art, everything.  Will definitely return one day.",0.9981,0.805,0.148,0.046,0.5416859275309979

I opted for the standard vegetarian and the wild part, every dish that was served to my brother (22 in all) mine looked exactly the same yet made veggie.

2011-09-19,5.0,"Who would have guessed that a meal at a fancy restaurant could be so much FUN? First of all, the menu at Alinea is a secret - you don't get to see it beforehand. This means that each course is a big adventure (although they do ask you beforehand if there's anything you're allergic to, so they don't inadvertently kill you). Next, each course is interactive. Instead of just passively sitting there while each dish is placed before you and then using the usual boring knife and fork, you actually have to DO different things to enjoy each course. There are courses that you eat with your fingers; tidbits of food on a skewer where you have to lean forward and bite it off; fresh greens growing in a centerpiece of real soil which you harvest for your salad yourself by snipping them off with manicure scissors; liquid courses that you suck out of a tube; dishes that come apart and have to be assembled a certain way before you can combine the different ingredients to complete the entrée.   Then there are all the surprising blends of different flavors: salty steelhead roe eggs with sweet watermelon mousse; hamachi deep-fried with banana and ginger; a cheese-flavored ravioli with a liquid center of black truffle; chocolate with red pepper sauce. The creativity, attention to detail, and formal presentation devoted to each dish is incredible. Our dessert was literally a work of art which was created right in front of us -- by head chef Grant Achatz himself, we later found out -- before we were allowed to eat it by scraping it off the surface of the table (which had been covered with a practical rubber tablecloth beforehand). I've never been so tempted to take a picture of my food, which I thought was something only tourists do, but I was too eager to dive in and start eating. In most high-end restaurants, you feel as if you have to mind your table manners. Here, it's perfectly acceptable to lick your fingers (although they do provide hot towels for the especially messy finger foods) and otherwise enjoy yourself.  If you like wine, Alinea prides itself on its wine list, but better to go with the optional wine pairing where each course is perfectly complimented by a specially selected wine. Arrive hungry - the portions are tiny, but after a total of 16 or so courses (we lost count), you'll be more than satisfied. Also, save a visit here for special occasions because it's definitely pricey - but do go at least once. It's definitely worth the three-star Michelin rating.

I highly recommend reading Chef Achatz's book Life, on the Line: A Chef's Story of Chasing Greatness, Facing Death, and Redefining the Way We Eat before you dine at Alinea.  SImply one of the best non-fiction pieces I've ever read.  I made my husband and our 3rd dining companion (a high school buddy of mine) read this before our meal and they agreed with me that the book enhanced the experience even more. Wear something dressy, but also comfortable.  We were there for nearly 4 hours I think.  The thing I appreciated about Alinea was the pacing and amount of food.  We weren't so stuffed by the end that we couldn't enjoy our dessert.  The portions were just right throughout the meal and when we left we felt satisfied, but not so full that it hurt to walk. What was my favorite course?  Everyone has their personal faves but I particularly loved the fried hamachi course.  Pairing it with a whole vanilla bean as a ""utensil"" was a great experience for the senses.",0.9911,0.813,0.137,0.05,0.48806349206349203

I've been to quite a few michelin starred restaurants previously such as French Laundry, Chez Dominique, Village Pub, Spruce, Lumiere, L2O, etc. These were very good restaurants. However, Alinea has really brought food, and good food to a different level.  The courses themselves were tasty and mind-blowing. Further, they made the whole dining experience very unique and seamless. First, they had completely avant garde ways of presenting food by going beyond the conventional utensils such as forks and knives. They would serve food on seaweeds, a tube, and a rack, etc. (yes, I did say a tube). All these would become gimmicks if the food themselves were lackluster. However, the food was incredible! Chef Achatz and his team really know how to play with texture, flavor and temperature. I can spend the whole day talking about each course, there're a few really stood out in terms of contrasting different textures, flavors, and temperatures. The hot potato cold potato, the tempura shrimp vanilla bean stick skewer, liquid black truffle ravioli, etc.   They offered not boring small dishes in between courses to make you marvel: how did they do it? such as the thin layer of shaved ice frozen on a cone like ceramic holder, all I could taste was refreshingly lemony flavors in the texture of snow!  One of the desserts definitely made me fall in love faster than ever. There were so many tiny various sizes of cubes in different flavors, on the plate, there was some small swirl of sauces. Each of them were small, but each of them had an explosion of flavors!! I was almost moved to tears...:) The course-to-course pace was well managed. The servers were amiable, professional and knowledgeable. We also ordered wine paring, the wine concierge was great. The whole dining experience was like an amazing show, with seamless flow, excellent performance and wonderful surprises. We really felt like we looked at food differently after Alinea.  The experience was memorable. Excellency doesn't come with a cheap price tag. :) The meal for two people including wine paring came down as close to one thousand dollars. It was the most expensive meal we've had so far, however, it's SO worth it, we wouldn't hesitate to spend it again or spend more in a heart beat.",0.9964,0.841,0.154,0.005,0.5622924798334635

Of course, the ""splat, splat, crack"" dessert that you've read all about everywhere else.   Minor things:  Restaurant was very quiet so you can't speak too loudly before 6pm.  Almost wish they had some background music.  There were two chefs serving our dessert.  One of them broke our frozen chocolate mousse prematurely before putting it on our table and didn't serve us the broken pieces.   $210 for the gazillion course dinner, $160 for basic wine pairing, $225 (?) for the reserved wine pairing, Wine by the glass averages $15 - $30 (very reasonable).  Didn't read the half bottle or bottle pages.   I love how all dishes were served on these functional yet creative dinnerware.  These are no ordinary plates.  You'll have to see it for yourself.",0.9752,0.827,0.138,0.035,0.5480434782608695

2011-09-08,5.0,"Mozart's Requiem. St Peter's basilica. A devastating storm rolling on the vast, endless turbulent waters of the ocean. The infinite vastness of the universe. A greatness beyond all possibility of calculation, measurement or imitation. In philosophy the sublime means something simply too vast, powerful or grandiose to take in fully. It tests the limits of one's ability to feel, to understand, to make sense of the world. It doesn't obliterate consciousness but rather makes one aware of both its capacities and its limits. Experiencing the sublime is therefore extremely pleasurable but also somewhat painful. In gastronomy experiencing the sublime can only mean one thing: surrender all your senses and put your life - no less - into the magic hands of one of these few geniuses blessed by all known culinary fairies on their baptism of fire, the day they entered the kitchen and touched a pot for the very first time. A 3-star Michelin chef. I can rightly say that I experienced the sublime at Alinea. Within the four hours of my meal I went from surprise to tears to laughter and every single overwhelming emotion one can possibly imagine. It does sound excessive and it might be; but for someone who lives and breathes for food like I do it makes total sense.  I don't know if it was the best food I have ever tasted and this is frankly  *almost* irrelevant since that was without a doubt the best meal I have ever had and one that cannot be easily surpassed. The food (divided in 19 courses) was of course phenomenal, refined, elegant, whimsical, earthy, aerial, awe-inspiring and yes, sometimes just slightly disappointing. But the experience itself, the perfection of a service extremely professional without being arrogant in the least, the incredible display of imagination, creativity and playfulness, the extreme pleasure of sharing some of these ephemeral wonders of a fantasized culinary pantheon, the indescribable delight of sipping on a full-bodied, powerful and impossibly ruby-colored 2005 Châteauneuf-du-Pape, the slight feeling of guilt inevitably associated with a $300-meal but oh-so-well mitigated by the extreme pleasure felt in every single fiber of your body with each passing minute, - all this and so much more  makes for an unforgettable experience, one that has to be lived by all real food lovers. Leave your doubts at the door; forget about your hesitations on molecular gastronomy and do an act of faith.  One cannot read reviews for Alinea and expect a detailed description of something that escapes words. The sublime leaves speechless. It is not told, explained, written.

Alinea was an amazing dining experience. Everything about it from walking into an unmarked door to the service to the food was all impeccable. This is a food experience unlike anything I have ever tried. Most of the dishes were wonderful and complex. Not everything worked and tasted great. But you sort of understand what they were trying to accomplish even if the result wasn't perfected. Each dish was served on some gadget out of Alton Brown's kitchen. They had pins, knifes, wires, pillows, and all types of strange contraptions. One memorable dish was the ""Hot Potato"", cold potato soup, black truffle, butter. The almost overpowering truffle in this cold soup really blended so well with the potato. It brought the main ingredients to the forefront and I had wished more of the touring menu was like this. The Rhubarb; ginger, basil course was really unexpected. It was a candy ball containing sweet and refreshing rhubarb and basil juice. The ball created an intense flavor explosion in your mouth. Some dishes that I didn't think work as well was the Wagyu Beef. This was brought out frozen and pinned to a stand to let defrost over several courses. The Wagyu was sliced so thinly for it to defrost properly; it was difficult to taste the wonderful fatty meat. The Dry shot, pineapple, rum, cilantro was served in powdered form in a paper envelope and you're supposed to empty the packet in your mouth. It created a pina colada shot but the powders didn't mix well so you are left with a dry clump. It was definitely creative but not so tasty. Maybe it was because we did the five hour 25 course touring menu and it was around 1 o'clock in the morning at that point. But when we got to the desserts they did not live up to the other courses.

2011-08-17,5.0,"Let me tell you about a small, unassuming building in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago, IL. An incognito dark grey facade that casually juts out a few feet further than it's neighboring buildings is all that this building offers. There is no signage, no lights, and no indicator about the activities carried on within. Nothing to suggest to you that you are at the site of the number one restaurant in North America. Once you pull open the plain doors of 1723 N. Halsted, you walk into a dark hallway with cascading walls and soothing red light. The hallway abruptly halts to a dead end and right before your mind tells you that you did something wrong, an automatic sliding, stainless-steel door (I swear they imported it from the Starship Enterprise) opens to your left and you are immediately greeted by a staff member who soothingly coos, ""Welcome to Alinea."" My excitement for this restaurant runs deep. I have had the cookbook for ages and I constantly admire it for the expert photography and the insightful details that Grant Achatz shares about the establishment and his thought process behind the food. I have read many reviews and articles published about Achatz and Alinea too. My level of expectation when I finally got to sit down in the restaurant was brutally high. I kept thinking to myself, ""It's okay if it disappoints a little, my expectations are just too lofty."" I'll spare you the details of the dishes. We had 18 courses with wine pairings so it'd take way too many words. The menu changes regularly too so my banter about it would just be outdated within a few months. But I'll assure you this: the dishes are as gorgeous to look at as they are delicious. Chef Achatz' command of flavor, texture, sight, and surprise is unsurpassed and the many articles I've read comparing a dinner at Alinea to a performance at the theater are not exaggerated. The final dessert course is something a lot of people often write about. We had the privilege of having Chef Achatz do the plating himself and that topped off a night that many of us would probably never forget. The experience at Alinea is almost just as important as the food that goes along with it. My advice is to leave your fears about the bill outside of the plain grey facade of the restaurant and enjoy yourself without hindrance.

2011-08-16,3.0,"Nearly a month has elapsed since we had dinner at Alinea - a much anticipated and expensive treat. Having read Grant Achatz's cookbook and biography we were anticipating some stellar taste treats with comparable service and ambience  - to the extent that this would be possible - to Tallevant or Divellec .  Having eaten at Jean Chauvel's Paris outpost of molecular gastronomy ""Les Magnolias"" in Perreux sur Marne several times, I was expecting the food to be both as interesting and surprising and several steps up from Chauvel. In retrospect, Alinea was great theatre -other reviewers have compared it to Vegas - and on that basis it was really great. The food however, despite its visual appeal - perfectly photogenic - and legendary intricacy in preparation was, I'm afraid to say, unexceptional and overall bland. My wife was concerned about an allergy to octopus - there was however so little of it  - maybe 5g - it would easily have passed unnoticed. The chocolate mousse was a desecration of chocolate - more Sara Lee than haute cuisine. I'll stick with the Achatz family's pies. The wine accompaniment was both overrated and overpriced - as had been noted by the Weekend WSJ several months back. The sommelier, indistinguishable - except for the hands - from Johnny Depp in ""Edward Scissorhands"", was a precocius and pretentious bore.  Choosing from the quite reasonable priced wine list would have been a better alternative and would have avoided the convoluted and uninteresting drivel about the sourcing of each wine - which meant very little to the captive diner - about as interesting as a Wall Street type blathering on about CDOs. The coffee was however superb although charging $8 for Badoit water when the meal was $215 and the wine accompaniment $160 was more than a little greedy.  There are much better restaurants in Chicago - like ""Les Nomades"" where the food matters more and where you can dine for half the price.

2011-08-16,3.0,"It was disappointing.  I mean, it was of course excellent, but it was not the best restaurant in the country.  Not close, actually.  There is no bar, just wine.  They caution you not to drink too much because they feel it could interfere with the experience. It's very interactive, with lots of playful presentations and some do it yourself stuff.   I have no problem with the obvious pretense of all of this, if you deliver the goods.  But they didn't.  When you have this much arrogance, if you pull it off, that's great.  When you don't, it comes off as just arrogant. Some of the dishes were just awesome, but others fell flat, and some just didn't make sense.  And there was not nearly as much of the molecular gastronomy-type presentations as I would've expected--the kind where you are surprised by the flavor or texture or both.  Just not much of that.   Much of the experience depends on the instructions from the wait staff.  Since it is so interactive, you rely on the waiters to explain exactly how to assemble and eat your food.  One dish in particular, involved short rib dished onto a piece of pasta, on which you then spoon about 10 different accompaniments.  The waiter basically said, just put it together and eat it however you want.  My wife stuffed it all in her mouth in one bite, which in retrospect wasn't the way to go.  Even I, who ate it in three bites, thought the number of accompaniments was overkill and prohibited me from really appreciating what I was eating.    And one of the dishes was borrowed from their Next menu, which annoyed me because it just seemed lazy to do that.  My guess is that a lot of this was due to Achatz not being in the kitchen that night, which was a huge disappointment.

2011-08-12,5.0,"***Alinea is truly a one-of-a-kind experience; while I enjoyed the food, Alinea works better as an ""experience"" rather than a ""meal,"" which makes it (for me at least) one to go to once but maybe not one that I must seek out again*** Alinea is considered one of the best restaurants in the country.  Alinea specializes in progressive cuisine (molecular gastronomy), but it one-ups similar places (like The Bazaar and Baume) by not only playing around with how the food is cooked (but also how the diner experiences it). Alinea has a set tasting menu with many courses and chef Grant Achatz shows incredible range by highlighting how he can put out fresh and vibrant Californian-like flavors (steelhead roe with watermelon, kaffir lime, cucumber blossom), classical flavor combinations with strong cooking technique (morels and hon shimeji mushrooms with cream and a red wine reduction), and creative interpretations on traditional dishes (like the peach, basil, burrata, balsamic, and almond plate, which combines the elements of a great salad, cheese plate and dessert all into one). There were other great things as well.  There was dehydrated yuba (tofu skin) that was wrapped with shrimp, miso and sesame seeds.  The crispy texture and flavor were both pleasing.  Another great dish was their farm salad, which was also a clever presentation.  There was a base of tomatoes (very fresh) and gazpacho (very tangy) that also came with goat cheese, carrot and red onion.  The table's centerpiece (a herb and greens garden) was used for the salad as you snip desired herbs/greens and then mix into the salad. I wished though that they didn't alter the goat cheese.  They must have freezed it or something to give it a different texture.  Unfortunately, it wasn't really a texture improvement.  It came across like cold goat cheese that had been in the cold part of the refrigerator too long and thus not in harmony with the other ingredients. Similar to the farm salad, the short rib pasta combined both a playful presentation as well as an interactive approach.  You dress the pasta sheet yourself with the many ingredients provided (olives, garlic, blackberry, smoked salt).  The flavors were strong and the beef was tender, juicy and savory. The meal could have used more meat though.  They did this one dish called (agneau), which was very dainty portions of meat (lamb I think) that came with crispy potatoes and a rich sauce.  The combination of ingredients produced a satisfying flavor, but the meat was dry (in addition to being very small).  Unfortunately, it was the only other meat dish and it did not have the impact of other meat dishes I've had at similar restaurants. They did a lot of seafood dishes though and they were good.  There was a nice scallop in a light broth as well as razor clams in XO sauce (a spicy-sweet-salty Asian sauce).  There was some moist mackerel that was made very fragrant with the addition of juniper as well as a fritter of hamachi (made fragrant with a vanilla bean). A lot of the other items were small bites and all of them were at the very least good (with some of them standing out more than others).  The black truffle explosion ravioli was good and flavorful (even if the pasta was a little too thick).  I also liked their lemongrass shooter with gelee, dragronfruit, Thai basil, and lime. Pricing was high, but Alinea is a one-of-a-kind experience.  Still, despite the many-many courses, I left a little bit hungry.  The experience was very satisfying, but when just considering this as a meal, I did not leave Alinea as content as I did after my visits to Ria or Avenues. Service was incredibly professional and polite (as well as unbelievably meticulous with immediate recognition of diner needs), but it was a little too formal for my taste.  The formal service here seemed consistent with other Chicago fine dining spots so it might just be a difference between West Coast dining and Chicago dining. The service also seemed a little too rehearsed for me.  It probably guarantees a consistently excellent service experience, but I prefer waiters/waitresses/servers who can identify customer preferences and thus customize the experience for each diner (Baume, The Restaurant at Meadowood, and The Village Pub are great at accomplishing this). In the end, the service though is very strong and the food has a big wow factor.  Alinea provided an experience unlike any I've ever had at a restaurant (or expect to have in the future).  And this makes Alinea a must visit if you love food (and even worth a special trip to Chicago).  But you should consider extending your trip because there is no shortage of very good restaurants in Chicago. Valet parking is available.  Street parking also seems to be available.",0.9993,0.803,0.174,0.022,0.5631122448979592
2011-08-12,5.0,"Did you really just give the ""best restaurant in America"" less than 5 stars on yelp??? Nahhh..  But really, it's hard to write a review on such an intimidating restaurant but actually it's not at all. Intimidating that is. I didn't know what the expect and was afraid to walk in and have everyone staring at me like I had a big ""noob"" sign on my face. But the service was awesome and the atmosphere was not pretentious at all even though neither of us (2) ordered the wine pairing.  The food is also obviously amazing. Way beyond anything I've ever eaten and probably beyond my comprehension of how complex the food is. There are many many many reviews about the food and pictures and books even so I'll just impart a few nuggets of knowledge. - We didn't read too much about each individual dish which was nice because we like to be surprised. Especially the dessert at the end.. I won't ruin it. - Being the good foodies we were, we were taking a few notes and pictures along the way. Turns out they give you this awesome menu at the end which has names and a little chart of flavors. - Took us 3-4 weeks out to make reservations and we called a few times to get a better time. They have a wait list but it's just day of. -  Plan on being there for at least 3.5 hours. We got there 6pm and left at 10pm and only had a table of 2.",0.9935,0.818,0.17,0.012,0.5002777777777778
2011-08-11,3.0,"I went with a group that had been to Alinea previously (I was visiting Chicago) and they described their previous dinner as superior to the one we shared. It was still fun, although I would like to return. I was expecting an experience like Per Se, but Alinea was more playful, and I have mixed feelings about this. I do not necessarily think building a fake beach to eat off is fun or interesting, and eating a turkey meatball of a pine branch is goofy, but does not necessarily improve the food. I think restaurants indulging in this kind of playfulness frequently get a by on their taste level. All that said I would like to go back. As I mentioned, the group I was with said a previous meal had been better, and I think the Alinea could improve my palate and offer interesting culinary experiences. For now, however, it's OK, and I can't firmly recommend it to all those interested.",0.9805,0.696,0.232,0.071,0.4840909090909091
2011-08-10,5.0,"This was the single best, most memorable, eye-opening, and flavorful culinary experience I have ever had. As a teacher, my salary does not allow for frequent dining splurges, but I try I find a way to visit some of the country's best restaurants when I can (Chez Pannise, Fench Laundry, etc.). My visit to Alinea was SO worth the penny pinching needed to go there. So if you are like me and wondering if it is worth the money....DO IT.  Also, for so upscale a restaurant the service was friendly and playful, not stuffy at all. We ordered the smaller tasting menu, which did not include the truffle explosion. When I called in advance to see if I could add that dish (indicating I would be happy to pay more) they said it was no problem. Not only did they include the extra dish, they didn't even charge anything extra.  I won't go through the long menu dish by dish, I will just say that every one of them was just amazing. Most of the time I was eating, my eyes were closed so I could focus in on the unusual flavors and textures.

2011-08-09,5.0,"First the facts... - Dinner lasted almost 4 hours.  We were seated at 5:45 for a 6:00 reservation (we weren't the first ones in the restaurant).  They don't have a bar. - We had around 17 courses.  The menu that's currently online is pretty much what we were served. - About 1/3 to half of the courses didn't require silverware to eat.  Many were single bite meals and we also had some ""shooters"" from either clam shells or a test-tube.  Fingerfoods at Alinea...our kids would have been right at home.  - One of us had the wine pairing which they kindly printed on the menu that we were given at the end of the meal to take home...adds about 3/4 of the meal price to the bill. - We sat on the ground floor which is the smaller dining room.  The main one is on the second floor. - The kitchen is also on the ground floor and visible from the bathroom entrance - I witnessed no less than 15 chefs in the kitchen including the mastermind himself plating dishes.  The kitchen was very quiet.  Everyone knew what they were supposed to be doing. - We saw two people in a small room between the bathroom door and kitchen whose full time job appeared to be washing dishes (they use a lot in the service) - Waitstaff were everywhere...all men.  The only woman was the hostess.  But I think there were some women chef in the kitchen. - Most expensive meal we've ever had (by far) but the occasion made it well worth it. Now the subjective stuff... - I felt like I witnessed and experienced the product of a man who was part chef, part chemist, part artist, part mad scientist.  The man is simply brilliant. - The presentation was really unique for each course - Malaysian driftwood? test tubes?  vanilla bean as a eating utensil? - The food itself, was very good.  Some of the course were definitely better than others.  But the sheer number of courses made it hard for me to appreciate any cohesiveness to the meal.  While I was able to judge the flavor of each course on its own, I left feeling like I had 17 small bites instead of 1 glorious meal. - Definitely worth the experience but I would only recommend to people who had the right expectations.  If you're only focused on the food, don't go.  It's not just about the food.  It's about the art, the creativity and the vision of one man translated into the setting, food, presentation and service.  If you go in with that expectation and can appreciate the experience for all of that, then I think you will not be disappointed.",0.996,0.837,0.147,0.016,0.5653601953601953
2011-08-08,5.0,"Curiously, the top restaurant in the US (2010/2011) lies in the quaint and unpretentious neighbourhood of Lincoln Park. The only tell-tale sign was the valet notice and doorman standing by the bare doors.  I was greeted by a narrow neon red hallway and my world was suddenly transformed once the metal doors opened. The hostesses and servers operated seamlessly. After reconfirming our lack of dietary restrictions, our courses came promptly, one after another. All 20 of it. A set of 3 cocktail amuse bouche opened our tastebuds. A cooling sour lemon with sweet grapefruit, a spoonful of apple brandy hard jello and a shot on a stool of squash with foam on top.  Each one seems to be progressively stronger in alcohol taste.  The GOLDEN TROUT ROE had light coconut flavours , and the zest of tangy-sweet pineapple.  What an interesting and unique combination of flavor that will always remind me of Chef Achatz! The Japanese inspired YUBA was a long crunchy twig that was wrapped with shrimp, sprinkled with sesame seeds and dipped with miso. Presented alongside with the Vietnamese inspired CHAO TOM which is a sugar cane cube infused with shrimp broth, topped with mint and chewed until the flavours are extracted. A beautiful twist to the traditional Vietnamese dish! The STRIPED BASS was complimented perfectly with sweet vanilla froth and sourness.  A pinch of black pepper and sesame, along with the light crackers gives it the crunch that contrasts flawlessly with the supple fish. A shot of CELERY JUICE held a shell of horseradish ball encasing apple juice. What an exotic flavor from everyday fruit and vegetable! The horseradish was slightly spicy like wasabi (which is made of horseradish) and the celery juice and apple juice mixed well together.  A distinctive three layered dish of RABBIT Top layer; eat it like a parfait, a sheet of squash and pine nuts were accompanied by thin crunchy stems. Then rabbit rillette was accompanied by balls of potatoes? Afterwards, sip on the consommé made from the rich broth that soaked the cinnamon stick. Unfortunately, I thought this was a little salty for my liking. A smoky aroma filled the room; it was from the burning fig that held the PHEASANT TEMPURA with walnuts together. Light crunch, very unique and the pheasant was very tender but I'm not a big fan of walnuts.  One of the most interesting dish was the create-your-own SHORT-RIB RAVIOLI with a variety ingredients of your choice! Including sea salt, olives, blackberry, onion etc. I made sure to put everything in my wrap. It was delicious, and the chilled pasta wrap was warmed by the slow braised short rib. The creativity and hands on experience does not end here! Next up was a shot of temperature sensitive POTATO with black truffle. Warm truffle paired with icy cold potato and mushroom. What a scrumptious sensation! Then our server poured us a GRAPE SODA to match with the extremely tender PIGEONNEAU on a light puff pastry.  BLACK TRUFFLE EXPLOSION blew up in my mouth! Keep your lips shut for this as you don't want luscious rich truffle spilling out of your lips! Cheesy, creamy truffle. MMM! A spoonful was delectable and satisfying. To pave the way to desserts, an unusual sweet-savory set of three came. A PINEAPPLE SUGAR SHEET dusted with ham flavoured powder. Be sure to eat it with the powder facing up and you'll keep the table powder-free! Slightly sugary, more savory. A crispy bacon glazed with butterscotch and a cup of liquefied caramel popcorn made a sweet drink. An exquisite transition from main course to dessert! An inflated pillow infused with earl grey permeated the room while we cut up EARL GREY COOKIE topped with white chocolate and crunchy strips.  My favourite dessert is the tube of bubble gum flavoured CREME FRAICHE. Jelly like in the tube, suck it out and all three layers combined. A chewy consistency of mini tapioca balls and fruity-bubblegum flavoured.  Ending the night was the full blown dessert, a CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM frozen by liquid nitrogen. Surrounded by huckleberries, nougat and a dollop of vanilla cream. The crisp sheet decorating the final piece stood out from the soft and cooling ice cream.  Service was impeccable. Napkins replaced, water droplets and crumbs wiped off, each course explained thoroughly, and came and left in a syncronised fashion, gracefully and efficiently. *** Tip: Business formal dress code suggested. We made reservations at least a month in advance. Cancellation costs $100 per person! Tasting menu was not that filling but still left me about 80% full. I liked being there at 5pm because we were the first ones to get seated and we were the first ones to get our food.  Favourites: Very friendly service, not pretentious at all. Expensive but not disgustingly unaffordable. Do not want: I wanted a little more red meat =p  Last words: What an EXPERIENCE!",0.9978,0.849,0.128,0.023,0.5566603535353536
2011-08-07,5.0,Giving this place 6 stars if I could.  It takes fine dining to a new level by adding elements of theatre and wild creativity.  We went two years ago and had something that sounded ridiculous(18 courses?) but it was just right.  You're in master hands here - just trust them.  Everything was delicious and the experience of anticipating all the strange and beautiful courses transported us.  Last year we weren't able to get a reservation so we went to Charlie Trotters and were horribly disappointed.  We booked our reservation for October on August and it was already filling up(I think they'd just started taking Oct reservations on Aug 1?)  Get organized and get in here - you'll be glad that you did!,0.9253,0.75,0.173,0.077,0.5892660369933097
2011-07-31,5.0,"You feel special just walking into this unmarked building. The hustle and bustle of the outside world immediately disappears as soon as you step into the dimly-lit hallway that appears to shrink off in the distance (think willy wonka). Two doors slide open and like stepping into the Holodeck on the Enterprise you enter a entirely different environment than the one you just moments ago became accustomed to. I find it difficult calling what happened next a 'meal' as the term simply does not adequately describe an evening at Alinea. It was a perfectly-choreographed event with the story-line being the 18 or so courses laid out in front of us. The attention to detail is astounding, from the smallish separated dining rooms, to the many customized serving vessels, to the chairs that somehow remained comfortable for the duration of the 3 hours we spent there. All the dishes, many a single bite, were so rampant with flavors and textures that I took to pausing a few moments before swallowing to allow the flavors to mix and produce an entirely new element to the dish that I had not experienced just moments before. Taking things slow is a must here. Eat too quickly and you would miss out on the subtle flavors and additions offered by each ingredient. One recurring theme of many of the more substantial courses was that the whole was always greater than the sum of the parts. Flavors that maybe did not amaze on their own combined in a way that elevated all the components involved into one cohesive, unforgettable bite. Some courses were interactive without being annoying. Cutting my own greens off the ""living garden"" centerpiece for the salad course was a strangely satisfying experience. The salad itself was also unreasonably good. My only warning about this place is to have an open mind. This is not the restaurant to go to if you're looking for classical dishes and/or a typical appetizer, entree, dessert progression with large portions.

Maybe if I hadn't done my homework prior to coming here, I wouldn't have such high expectations. The presentation is amazing. The creativity put behind the dishes is what sells this place. I just wish that the rest of the experience supported that. The wait staff was hit or miss. There were a few gentlemen who were fantastic at their job. I don't care whether you are working at Alinea or Dennys...your job is the same. A server should be able to adapt to their patrons regardless of personality. We had a few who could drop off a dish and flutter away without even being noticed and then come back again when we were feeling chatty and keep up with our slightly wine-induced humor. Then there were some that were just so rigid in their disposition that I felt uncomfortable. One in particular came off as incredibly pretentious. Hearing his affected accent when describing wines and food made me cringe, and this culminated in his describing a Hungarian wine to a table adjacent to ours and sneaking out ""Budapest"" in the most horrific accent I have ever heard. I am Hungarian. No...just...no. Chef Achatz came out for the dessert and I didn't even realize it was him until hours later at home when my boyfriend pointed it out. I wasn't expecting a huge show, but a modest introduction from him would have been kind.

2011-07-06,3.0,"Okay.  Maybe I don't get it.  But that is, after all, one of the things about Yelp.  Sometimes you end up with reviews of places by people who don't get it.  And you have to filter that noise out. As a bit of background, we were in Chicago for a week as an anniversary trip.  We've been to and enjoyed greatly other ... daringly modern ... restaurants.  WD-50 in New York and The Fat Duck outside London come to mind, though they are very different in many ways.  We've been to other highly rated restaurants in various parts of the world.  There was no question that we'd be going to Alinea when we visited Chicago ... people have said it might be the best restaurant in America right now.  That's where I'm coming from. And we do not, perhaps, quite look the part.  You can put a suit and tie on me, and slip my companion into a cocktail dress and heels, but we'll still ride the red line up and back if it's not raining out, and that doesn't really make us look any less geeky.  It is generally accepted that the host should not be surprised at this sort of thing, and if surprised, should certainly not act surprised when he inquires about a taxi or valet parking and is met with a different answer than the one he is looking for. We were seated in the back in a small room with a business group that should probably have not been there.  I say this as the staff felt the need to lecture them about a) not getting up too often to take phone calls and interrupting service, and b) flash photography, though not about c) making so much noise as to interrupt others dining experience.    It also turned out that this was on the well-traveled path to the restroom. It is, in the end, one of the most controlled fine dining experiences I've had.  I mean, there are some small number of places that don't let you take pictures at all, and some places with a single fixed menu and no choices other than substitutions based on dietary restrictions, but few of them have managed to make me feel so oppressed by it all. One could look at this as a theater experience, I suppose.  But if so, it's like one of those moviegoing experiences where the other patrons have laser pointers and talk through the whole thing, and if the plot points are not revealed by overhearing their chatter, they are by the exact same movie being played overly loudly in the next room over only ten minutes ahead. I realize I have not said a lot about the food yet, but it is important to understand the atmosphere here.  The control of Grant Achatz extends beyond the kitchen, and into the dining room, and is going to have some effect on how I judge the food. So ... to the food.  Every piece is an elaborate presentation - every piece is intricate - and most of the flavors are very good.  The ingredients are for the most part to-notch, and the wine accompaniment ( we chose the standard one over the more expensive one - our only choice of the evening ) generally worked well, though it was never made exactly clear how many courses a particular pour was meant to accompany.  We shared a wine pairing, which may have been too little for the amount of food - in contrast to our experience elsewhere and some advice here. At several points, we are led in anticipation by serving equipment being placed early or parts of the dishes being arranged some number of courses beforehand.  Some courses were served in multiple stages.  Some courses were prepared at the table in some way.  Dessert was impressive and tasted good too.  I'm not going to say much more - menus are only presented afterwards, and the intent is to surprise and delight.  You can look it all up if you like spoilers. Having said that the flavors are good, and the presentations are as innovative ( and at times beautiful ) as anything I can compare them to, I have to come to my main complaint about the food: it seems to exist in a cultural vacuum.  Modern food like this *needs* some context to it.  A place like The Fat Duck may have odd preparations, but they are always hung on some familiar context.  I was missing that context at Alinea.  I had many dishes which tasted wonderful, which were new and different and at times weird, but they did not, for the most part, make a connection for me with anything familiar.  Those which did attempt to connect themselves to a more familiar dish or serving method lacked any real sense of humor about it.  This is really where things fell flat to me.  I was plenty surprised, but not always delighted. I realize that this is an esoteric complaint.  But for me, it's what made this about the third best restaurant experience I had in a week in Chicago ... without even considering the price and the hype.  Frankly, my dinner at Moto later in the week stood up in all the places Alinea fell down.",0.996,0.841,0.111,0.048,0.4470276885599466
2011-07-04,5.0,"Dear future patron of Alinea, Where do I even begin? Okay, so tickets were booked for Chicago and I called one month in advance to make reservations at Alinea. I got a busy signal for 2 hours straight, but I finally got through and reservations were made. Success! Okay, my party and I got here and nearly missed this place. The outside looked like some type of garage until we saw a small folding sign on the ground that says ""Alinea."" Bingo! We were taken to our seats. We were the first ones to arrive and it felt really awkward at first because there were so many servers around and they were looking at us. My party didn't really talk much because it would echo off the walls since it was that quiet. After 10-15 minutes more diners showed up...*phew the awkwardness was gone. So here is the dinner in a brief summary: -Very interesting, nothing I have experienced before -Assembling was needed in some dishes -Everything was delicious -Loved the concept -Nifty plating techniques -Delicious foam...yes foam with taste! -Took a shot of the ""aquarium"" and had a leaf stuck in my windpipe...haha that wasn't fun -The glasses were never half full -Explosion...wow that was something, wished there were more of those -The waitstaff warned us on some foods not to eat with mouth open or it would end up on ourselves or the person across from us (I wonder if anyone really got food on others) -We were also warned not to lick this ice cold lid-thing because apparently someone in the past done it and their tongue got stuck - at least his tongue was stuck to something yummy -The dessert was AMAZING, it was beautifully put together by Chef Grant Achatz himself So how was the experience? Definitely worth hopping on a plane for and planning everything around this 4.5 hour dinner for. Every dish was like Christmas because you don't know what is going to come out next. And as for me I was like a kid, who couldn't wait until Christmas to open my presents - that I broke the rules and opened lids and such when they told me not to. I still remember one of the waitstaff said to me, ""You just couldn't have waited 20 seconds huh?"" Haha.  The whole experience was very interesting and fun. The servers were really friendly and funny, which I thought they would've been more uptight because of how fancy this place was. My party and I had a great time here!  Yours truly, A gal with an appetite, who will travel for food P.S. - they are vegetarian friendly too P.P.S. - I've uploaded pictures without captions because I don't want to spoil any surprises P.P.P.S. - *Hut hut* If you hear something that sounds like a football game huddle in the kitchen, it's just Cheft Achatz (think of him as the quarterback) and his team making your dinner.

The savory courses were all so good and I wish they had more of the savory and less of the sweet courses. As the night drew on I was eagerly awaiting the final dessert course because I had read how Chef Achatz comes out to create it using the entire table. Watching him was like watching a cross between artist and a lab scientist. I had only wish that Achatz would have been a bit more conversational with our table but I'm sure he has much to do and many other tables to deal with.  As we devoured the amazing dessert in record time, we asked the staff that if anybody had ever licked the table clean. They said some people have come pretty close to it.

2011-07-01,3.0,"For better or worse, this restaurant has a reputation to live up to. Three Michelin stars, number six in the world on the San Pellegrino list, and a price tag to match. For a place like Alinea, most people aren't lucky enough to go, ever, and even more won't be able to go more than once. The only basis I have for this is my one trip tonight, probably the only one I'll ever have. On this night, Alinea did not live up to that reputation, and my wife and I came away disappointed.  The reason: we were seated next to a four-person table of the most disruptive diners I have ever experienced. Raucous, brash, bombastic, rude. Loud conversation the entire night, none of it about the food: in fact the food seemed secondary to their goal of consuming as much alcohol as possible. All of George Carlin's dirty words were spoken - announced - out loud (OK, not C---sucker, but really and truly we heard the other six). They made poop jokes about the chocolate on the dessert table. Five cell phone calls rang and were answered in the middle of dinner. At some points the laughing and yelling rose to a fever pitch that was only broken up when one of the women at the table shushed the rest of them, only to explode into laughter herself. Chef Achatz himself came out to serve their chocolate splatter course (by the way, it's quite novel), and even this did not sober them up - they heckled him for being too young to be a real chef. We were just one course behind them, and my wife asked me if I thought Achatz would also come to our table. When I said to her, ""No, I don't - it's just not our night tonight,"" she knew exactly what I meant. (He didn't.) The thing is, we loved the food - it was maybe the best I've ever eaten. For the first time ever in my fine dining experience, there was no course, no bite, no flavor in the entire meal that I didn't like. There were flavors and spices and presentations I've never seen or imagined. Some of the ingredients were quite sophisticated, others simple but surprising (Granny Smith apple sorbet, English pea puree, and parmesan cheese... who thinks like that?) And actually the service was great: friendly, conversational, respectful: our sommelier didn't treat us like naifs when we asked simple questions about the wine pairing; our waiters had mastered the art of being simultaneously knowledgeable about, and in awe of, the complex techniques their chefs showed off from the kitchen. But eating is an experience that involves all of the senses, and one year from now when I think about this meal, the memory will be of scraping delicious frozen yuzu from an insane minus 200 degree ice cone, while the man at the table next to me is asking the waiter for a shout wipe because he has so covered himself in flakes of chocolate, followed by the staff asking him to get up while they replace the chair because his mess has stained it to the point of unusability. I'll remember biting into a masterpiece of exploding truffle, and also how funny it is that the woman at the table next to us sometimes acts JUST like her mother. I don't know if there was ambient music playing in the restaurant, but I do know that the woman next to us uses Bruno Mars as her cell phone ring tone. And I'll remember getting the check and, for the first time at a four star restaurant, feeling a little like a fool for spending so much money on one dinner. I've left some suspense about one thing: did I speak up to the diners? Did I tell the staff? Did they ""make it right"" (restaurant-speak for free stuff)? Here's the thing: there's no making it right. This is a restaurant full of talented staff who know how much it costs to eat there, and who should know how to deal with this situation, but didn't. The four diners next to us were never chastened - no subtle request to take phone calls outside, no gentle reminder to the jacketless man that jackets are required (I was reminded twice, once when I called for the reservation, and once when they called to confirm). It should not have been up to us to ask these four people to quiet down. And as the only couple sitting next to the group, I didn't feel comfortable complaining about them to the staff while they were still sitting there. I spoke to our waiter when the group had finally left, and he apologized on behalf of the restaurant, said all the servers knew they were trouble, and they could tell when they walked in that they were pretty drunk already. He said they talked in their meetings about how to handle people like that. And then he said, ""I wish you had said something sooner."" I appreciate the sentiment, but it sounded like I didn't need to tell him. I wish they had acted sooner.  Three hours into our meal, at about the same time that the offenders left, a couple was seated nearby to begin theirs. My wife and I looked at each other, and I knew we were thinking the same thing: I wish that was us.",0.9978,0.807,0.134,0.059,0.49728018548243264

My parents took me here as part of my college graduation present and I was stoked about it. So yes, I may be a little bias as I'm probably way too young to really understand what it is to go fine dining. But I digress. While I was walking to our table when we first got seated, I wanted to let my parents sit on the booth side so they'd be more comfortable, but as I was pulling my chair out one of the guys grabbed the chair from me and sternly goes, ""NO, miss. You aren't sitting here. You're sitting in the booth."" Wow. Thanks douche. I was just trying to be a considerate daughter by letting the parentals have the more comfortable seats. Didn't realize you loved your budding career as a seating guy so much... Anyway, after that it was all uphill as the courses and wine pairings we got were amazing. Let me tell you, It's very Willy Wonka in that kitchen haha. One of our desserts was served to us in a tube on a hot towel called a ""bubblegum shot"" and there was tapioca and pink stuff in it. Like I said, I'm no fine dining pro. I call it like it is. A tube with pink stuff in it. And it was delicious. The food and presentation really was amazing, but that credit goes to Willy Wonka Chef Grant, not the douchey seating guy. Man was he a douche. Whatever, he's just a seating guy. I got eye-raped while walking to the bathroom too by one of their tiny little dishwasher guys. It was quite creepy. Guess they all find their way into the fine dining world one way or another.

For those that read this probably already know about the legend of Grant Achatz and the status of Alinea as the #6 restaurant in the world.  I came here with extremely high expectations and was prepared to be wowed.  It's hard to understand the genius of food until you eat here.  I would have to say Bazaar at SLS in Beverly Hills was still one of my favorite meals due to the focus on gastro-chemistry but Chef Achatz menu is one that focuses less on trying to overwhelm the diner but instead, take them on a fun journey of food.   What does this mean?  Well, the plating for one is a true experience at Alinea.  From the use of a vanilla bean as a utensil to the silicone dessert table, Chef Achatz uses many advanced techniques to prepare and serve the food but he does not lose the poetry in the food itself.  I appreciate how he keeps it simple in order for you to appreciate the food but when you dig into the actual dishes, you realize how much thought and preparation goes into each dish.  I love the carrot handroll with the tobacco extraction and short ribs that you had to make yourself.  My favorite dish was the cold pea soup but my wife's was the cold potato / hot potato truffle soup and the shrimp stick thing that had an amazing dipping sauce...   One thing I will say is that the wait staff was quite attentive but I found some of the more senior wait staff dry and in some ways, a bit too stiff.  Perhaps I am more of a casual person who likes to enjoy his food and the people he is surrounded by, so in that sense, I would say that I have had better service.  It's not that anyone was rude but I can't help but wonder if these people take themselves too seriously.  It's hard to explain but I would have appreciated a little less pretention and a bit more warmth.  That being said, some of the other waiters were also quite funny and nice, including a server who had just completed his 2 yr anniversary and had a pleasant personality.  We waited at the front after dinner as Chef Achatz was kind enough to show us the kitchen and the front of the house, specifically the tall female (I think her name was Mallory or Melanie) was fantastic.  She gave us a tour of the kitchen and helped make it even more memorable, like she understood that for many of us, dining here was a once in a lifetime experience.   Finally, I have read some reviews or blogs about Chef Achatz that dared to proclaim the chef as a prick.  To that food critic, you are an asshole and a pretentious contrarian who suffers from the exact problem that most food critics share...  someone who abuses his power to share his opinion and someone arrogant enough to think his opinion matters.  (Basically an article about a misunderstanding over a photo taken during the private viewing of Next and Aviary).  My wife and I couldn't find the Chef more charming and more humble, and I must say, meeting him and his demeanor made us that much more impressed with the meal.  This is a guy who beat cancer and during much of the time of his treatment, came to work every day.  This is a genius who is considered by many to be the finest chef in the USA who came to our table and painted our dessert for us.  This is a guy who thanked me for coming to eat at his establishment and who wanted to make sure our photo came out good.   Chef Achatz, if you ever come across this review, you are a revelation.  TWO WORDS:  MAN CRUSH",0.9981,0.774,0.162,0.064,0.5536328549684715

2011-05-10,5.0,"As soon as I found out my brother & I would be in Chicago in May, our first move was to figure out how to get a table at Alinea.  We are both foodies and had watched the restaurant from afar, and we wanted a chance to experience it.  We had never spent more than $50 or $60 for a meal, but were willing to pay the price for something like Alinea.   We called a couple months in advance and were able to get a prime 8:30pm spot on a Saturday.  The restaurant was happy to accommodate our requests for no alcohol or no pork in the dishes, which was a relief. Upon arriving at the restaurant, you'll notice that there's no sign and it's in a fairly unassuming gray building.  As you walk in, you are greeted by a small hallway bathed in a red glow.  An automatic sliding door opens to your left and you are greeted -- by name -- and taken directly to your table.   Despite probably being the youngest people in the restaurant, we were treated well by the large and experienced wait staff, and they made an effort to be approachable.  They are definitely trained to add to the drama and overall excitement.  We were especially impressed by their focus on service in all aspects of your time there -- including getting you a cab or ensuring your car is waiting for you. Many people have already written about the food and menu, so I do not need to add to that and ruin any surprises or give away the fun.  I will, however, echo the sheer fun and brilliance of the restaurant.  We tried many ingredients for the first time and most dishes were excellent.  Surprisingly, some of the meat, especially the lamb, was cooked less perfectly than expected, but the dishes still impressed.  The dessert, crafted by Chef Achatz at the end of our meal, directly on our table, was fun and you could see his intense focus and technique. I would encourage you to go with some excitement and an open mind.  It's certainly not cheap, but it's a memorable meal and if you're like me, you'll start scheming to return as soon as you walk out the door.",0.9977,0.753,0.212,0.035,0.5440806878306879

2011-05-08,5.0,"""It's the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting."" - Paulo Coelho It was a year ago when I discovered I was going to be one lucky lady and dining companion at Alinea.  Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine that I would be able to experience the work of Grant Achatz, one of the pioneers of molecular gastronomy.   In a rather abrupt turn of events, I did not go, but I promised myself that I would take the initiative to make reservations.  It only took another six trips to Chicago, but as I walked down the red-lit corridor, I knew that the persistence would be worth it.  My dining companion and I agreed that we felt some sort of adrenaline rush when we entered the restaurant - the innovation and passion at Alinea seemed contagious. You can't just take anyone with you to a dinner that spans five hours.  I can't imagine many people whose company I could tolerate for five hours without aiming for the other party's jugular (and I'm at a restaurant with knives, perfect!) but Ryan is different.  For such a special ocassion, I am glad that I was in the company of one of my best friends. We were also the youngest people in the restaurant.  Although this probably wasn't surprising, it did allow us to befriend our servers and make jokes about Indiana, fixed gear bikes, and my post-Black Truffle Explosion state.  One particular server/ thespian did a great job impersonating the hand-to-the-chest and wide eyed response to biting into this particular dish.  Each of our servers was entertaining, personable, and played along well with the theatrics of dinner.  I refuse to chronicle each course of the meal, taste-by-taste.  Not only would be much like reading the spoilers to a movie, but my decision to dine at Alinea was for the overall ""experience.""  To recount the evening in such a methodical manner would diminish the sensory experience and destroy the elements of surprise that make an event like this so interesting. What will I divulge?   - Eucalyptus leaves can taste like oysters.  (And no, they are not genetically engineered a la Monsanto.) - All of the following may be white: Lemon, coffee, licorice, black pepper, and halibut. - Three words: Black Truffle Explosion.  It's one of Chef Achatz's signature dishes. - No Nutella-banana dessert that you consume will be as tasty (AND have an interesting texture) as what you will experience at Alinea. - You'll have the opportunity to peer into a kitchen that strives for nothing short of perfection while you wait to be seated or on your way out. - The painstaking attention to detail is commendable - even the food vessels have a purpose and tell a story.  Oh, to have some of that vintage stemware in my ideal art-deco apartment...* - And you may just have the chance to eat with your hands at a three star Michelin-rated restaurant. On the way home, we were presented with menus, which recount dinner in very few words.  The menu is meant to be pictoral: blurry circles represent your courses.  The relative position of the circle on the page (left or right) is indicative of how sweet or savory the dish is.  The area of the circle is proportional to the size of the course.  On the cab ride home, I thought of how this menu tells a story full of twists and turns, in the same unexpected way that my adventures in Chicago and dreams of graduate school have unfolded. * Should have brought the ""big purse.""",0.9972,0.801,0.157,0.042,0.46928218694885354

2011-04-26,5.0,"It's no coincidence that Alinea has three michelin stars and is the number one restaurant in America. I came here after two long months of anticipation. We had a reservation at 9:30 so we finished our meal around 12:45. Service at first was kind of awkward and the server kept mumbling his words. After they knew that we weren't some uptight twenty year olds, they loosened up and made it a fun time. Although not every course was perfect, probably 19 out of the 22 courses were simply mindblowing. I won't go into detail on the food because I could probably write a five page paper on each dish, but everything was either great to life changing. My favorite dishes were the halibut, black truffle explosion, rabbit rillete-parfait-consomme, hot potato cold potato, wild mushrooms and the mindblowing dessert finale. The two dishes I feel were not perfectly executed was the escoffier inspired dish. It was lamb and it was pretty cold and chewy. I expected it to be hot and melt in your mouth tender, but it seemed like it was sitting out awhile. The venison in the eucalyptus was also not perfect. The venison was pretty overcooked. From pictures I saw, it looked to be cooked medium rare, but mine was rather tough and more cooked medium-well. That being said, they were still pretty great.  The service was also spot on and I liked the beer progression. So is it worth it? I think it is absolutely worth it. Although one could not dine there very often, I recommend you at least try it once to see the possibilities of what can be done with food. I would say wherever you come from, Alinea is worth the trip alone. People say it is a once in a lifetime experience, but I am excited to say that I will be back many times in my lifetime.

2011-04-25,3.0,"I visted Alinea this past Friday night. I am torn about what to write for this review. Overall I enjoyed the experience, and I thought some of the dishes were absolutely hands down the most innovative food I have ever seen or tasted but I didn't leave there feeling completely blown away. Now, the only experience I have to compare is our visit to Per Se. While the techniques and presentation of these chefs could not be more different, I do think it's fair to compare and contrast ingredients used, atmosphere and service. I did the vegetarian menu and my husband did the standard tour. It was fascinating to see the Alinea's chef be able to play with each dish and make them aesthetically identical. His presentation was incredibly whimsical. However, for the price, which is $195 plus tax and gratuity, (which ends up being almost the same price at Per Se,) I didn't feel as if I got the same satisfaction out of the vegetarian menu as I did at Per Se. I feel that they should lower their price point for that menu. The standard tour, I unfortunately felt the same. No frois gras, lobster, caviar, sweet breads, or similarly rare and or pricier fishes or meats. With that said, the dishes were executed to perfection and everything tasted delicious with the exception of a consommé and custards that were simply over salted. The other thing that struck me, at Per Se there were SO many extra little courses and touches that weren't on the menu. An amuse, amazingly delicious bread course, pallet cleansers, cheeses, extra dessert courses, and a goodie bag of treats for each guest when you received your check. There were NO extra's here...not even a single piece of bread. Now, the atmosphere I found to be strange. I believe it's attempt was to be minimalistic, but it came off as very cold, and certainly, if I just ended up there without knowing anything about the place, I would never in a million years guess this was one of the world's top eating establishments. Now on to the staff....where to begin....I always try and remind  myself that when I leave NYC, I can't expect the same type of white glove service at high end restaurants. But, when you are paying over $200/person, all bets are off. Your staff, from the top down, should be professional, knowledgeable, and they should be an intricate part of the diner's experience. A place like Alinea and Per Se, isn't just about eating dinner, it's about having a food experience. We sat at 5:45 and you could hear a pin drop in our part of the dining room, that is, with the exception of the four staff members that stood in the corner watching us eat, and seemingly talking to each other about their guests. So for the first hour of our dinner, it was quite uncomfortable to only hear the chatter of the restaurant staff as well as having them stare at you while you eat. I don't think I have ever quite experienced that. The sommelier was horrific. We wanted to stay within the lower price range of their bottle list $50-$100 - he offered us no help once he realized he wasn't going to be able to sell us what he viewed as expensive bottles of wine. It was truly offensive. Because we love wine so much, I recall our experience with the sommelier at Per Se to be amusing and so enjoyable. He had a wonderful sense of humor; he brought us tastings and without even having to ask, pointed us to many different price rangers of bottles based on our flavor pallet. We never had to say what we wanted to spend after we ordered the first bottle, because he got it, he understood what price point we were going to be in and or around for that evening. The sommelier at Alinea's response to us when we asked him what he thought we should get after giving him a brief description of what we liked was ""Well...I don't really know, it just depends on what you like."" What kind of response is that from a sommelier?? We were so taken aback and quite frankly that could have ruined our experience except for the fact that we know our wines and in all honesty didn't need his help. The food runners were all fantastic and one of the ""captains"" on the floor who was a short red headed young woman was fantastic as well. But again, not one staff member had the polish or the expertise that I feel is essential to working at an establishment that has received the kind of notoriety Alinea has. All in all, I don't regret going, it was such a unique and memorable food experience. Def go if you have the money to spend, but if you are looking for a meal that will leave you wanting to come back for more, my money is best spent at places run by Chef's like Thomas Keller, Daniel Bolud, Eric Ripert. After eating at Alinea, I confess, like my wine, I much prefer the old world rather than the new. But I wish this place all the luck and if he can bring his service up to par with the quality of his cooking, it will be around for a long time.",0.9984,0.81,0.143,0.047,0.5100639552491403

My husband and I don't eat pork, so we mentioned it ahead of time and they were sure to make a couple of adjustments for us.

There seem to be more waiters than diners. One thing that I really appreciated was their occasional instructions on how to eat a course. Some courses are brought out in special serving dishes created just for Alinea. The food is presented in such an artistic way and some of the actual serving dishes are equally artistic.

I thought everything will be super formal but it was not like that.  - I went there at 9:30pm (the latest time they accept you) and were there till 1:00am on a weekday. It was a mistake. Reserve an earlier time if you want to fully enjoy it or go there on weekend. - The items are small but there are 20 of them.

2011-04-06,5.0,"One of the best dining experiences ever. Definitely worth the price. I love to go to fine restaurants stateside and abroad.  After reading the reviews, when I came to Chicago on a 3 day business trip, I decided to dine at Alinea.  From the greeting at the door, to the fine service,  to the spectacular meal, Alinea was an amazing trip for every sense and lots of fun - met every expectation.  I was a solo diner and had a fantastic time.  The staff was great and every dish was an adventure.  Having read about the 20-25 courses, I decided to go with a Grand Cru champagne cocktail to start and forego the wine pairing.  I never would have made it to the end had I opted for the wines.  The portion sizes are perfect for each dish, and, by the end of the meal, I couldn't have eaten another serving. The quality of the ingredients along with the artistic, creative, and often amusing presentations were culinary high points.  I'll never forget the Truffle Explosion. Every dish had a wow factor and the dessert was ""to die for.""  Can't wait to visit Chicago again..",0.9937,0.726,0.256,0.018,0.6772222222222222
2011-03-28,5.0,"I have to admit that I was a little skeptical and cynical when I agreed to go to Alinea with a few friends.  I love food.  I really love food.  I really, really, REALLY love food.  But I have shied away from the stratospherically expensive places because I have been let down one too many times.  At supposedly outstanding places, I've experienced missteps that convinced me that there is definitely a point of diminishing returns.  So, I tempered my expectations and figured that I would give this molecular gastronomy, modernist cuisine, or whatever label you would like to use, a try. This is not a relaxing place to eat, per se.  There is no music, the dining rooms are spare (probably because the food is truly the star of the show), and it's a little weird feeling that the staff is literally listening to everything we say and taking notes on it in a little black book.  Everyone was extremely friendly and professional, however, even when the flash on my camera went off accidentally.  I am generally a fan of warmer service, but I think this type of service matched the restaurant.  I heard from one of my friends that on his past visit, the servers were more interactive, so maybe we were just here on a slightly off night. The food itself was mind-blowing, inspiring, thought-provoking, and downright delicious.  So many reviews have already been written that I don't need to say much more.  I tried my best not to do much research beforehand to preserve the element of surprise, and I'm so glad I did.  The surprises are half the fun, for sure.  I loved the interactive food-as-art feel.  For the amount of ingenuity, creativity, and labor that goes into the food, I think that the nearly $200 price tag is actually a bargain.  Yes, a bargain.  Never thought I'd say that. Everyone at the table got the wine pairings, and while it was good, it may have been the most disappointing aspect of the meal for me.  I was hoping for the ""holy crap"" factor, that lightbulb moment when a food and a wine come together to produce a flavor greater than the sum of its parts.  I have experienced a few of these pairings before, some in restaurants, some happy accidents at home.  During this meal, I did not experience any of those moments, and if there's one place in the city I would expect one, it's here.  So, if I ever go back to Alinea, I'm not sure I would spring for the pairing again.  I may prefer to choose my own wine next time.  We did some research the next day, and pretty much all the bottles in the pairing are $40-$60 retail.  They were all good, but none were stunners.  For a table of 4-6 people, one could buy a few bottles of very good wine for significantly less than the 5 of us spent on the pairings.  Yes, you do pay for the variety, but I think we could get better wines picking out bottles with the help of a sommelier. Our party of 5 was there for 5 hours and thoroughly enjoyed every second.  I loved savoring the different flavors and textures of the components and taking my time picking things apart, then tasting different components together to see their interactions. Yes, it's very expensive, but if you are willing to save up, this is the meal of a lifetime.",0.999,0.743,0.223,0.035,0.5256153846153847
2011-03-28,5.0,"The experience of Alinea lived up to the expectations (and arguably the price).    The staff was incredibly professional and the service was impeccable. They were perhaps a bit too rehearsed as they obviously followed a script, but when we asked questions or knocked off the script, they were super knowledgable, friendly, and helpful.   I normally investigate menus before arriving to a restaurant, but I did as little to research Alinea as possible - and I believe this really helped me to enjoy the experience. It would take several pages to cover all the dishes and wax poetically how incredible everything was - there are many previous reviewers who have done an excellent job at this.  There is one dish, however, which I would like to highlight. At first I was sorely disappointed with the short rib pasta wrap. (and when I say ""sorely disappointed"" it's a relative scale. Anywhere else this would have been a 9.0+ out of 10.0). The short rib was very good, but I've actually had better. The pasta was quite tasty and I loved the texture. The user inspired additions were fascinating and challenging. With only one pasta wrap, unfortunately, there wasn't a lot of room to explore flavor combos. And this is what disappointed me about the dish. But as I continually thought about it the next day (now, that's a sign of an awesome experience), I considered that perhaps the whole point was a statement on the illusion of choice. The five people I dined with all essentially had the same dish and yet felt that we had personally taylored our experience. It was involvement without choice. Brilliant. A lot has been said about the price. So here is my $0.02. If you love food, a long evening out, and can afford / save for it, there is no question in my mind that the experience at Alinea is worth every penny. The key word is ""experience."" Don't get me wrong - Alinea is about the food, but if you're expecting ""dinner"" then there are a plethora of excellent options in Chicago - for far less money - that will meet your expectations.

Visionary, resourceful, inspiring, and the work of an unforgiving workaholic. There is a reason why chefs around the world have voted him the best in the world - over and over again, and why even now, he continues to cram awards into his home.  He is the best. Chef Grant, discovered he had tongue cancer just after his restaurant found global fame and respect, he was told he'd never taste again.  A James Beard award winner (multiple times over), he began to rely on his sense of smell to know when his, now infamous, cuisine was reaching levels of endless perfection; that and his trusty sous chef - who operated as a taster...

2011-03-19,5.0,"Alinea may as well be called ""Alien-a"" because it's simply an OUT OF THIS WORLD culinary experience!!! Haha that was cheesy.  Onward... Not too long ago I watched the Andrew Zimmern Bizarre Foods episode where he dined at Alinea.  I was fascinated by the crazy contraptions used to create their culinary creations and immediately put this restaurant on my ""must try sometime in my life"" list.  Then I realized it was also a 3-starred Michelin Restaurant. THEN I was sent to a work trip out to Chicago.  AND my boyfriend just happened to have a work trip that brought him out to Chicago the same week.  Needless to say it was meant to be for us two foodies to pay this place a visit. ""Subtle"" would be the word I have for this location, but I'm too excited about the food so I'm diving right in (there ARE 22 dishes, after all). The first course composed of 3 mini-servings of ""frozen drinks"", all meant to be consumed in a single bite. 1) Lemon - luxardo bitter, luxardo amaro, grapefruit:  a frozen bite of liquor lifted with a delicate pin - a bit bitter for me but a good refreshing start to the meal. 2) Apple - laird's apple brandy, grenadine, thyme: a piece of crunchy apple encapsulated in a jelly liquor served on a circular spoon - once again a foreign and enlightening experience for the taste buds 3) Squash - cynar, carpano antica, flor de cana 7 year: served on a mini tower, a flan-like substance with a tasty foam.  This was my favorite of the three, likely because it was the sweetest. 4) Steelhead Roe - dijon, retabaga, grapefruit:  creamy, full of ""umami"", zero hint of fishiness paired with the essence of grapefruit.. simply delicious.  5) Yuba - Shrimp, miso, togarashi: a crunchy twist of fried tofu skin, wrapped with tender shrimp and dipped in a perfectly seasoned miso sauce.  The asian side of me is comforted by this little ""snack"". 6) Urchin - watercress, vanilla, mint: A vanilla ""jello"" of sorts encapsulating a small piece of sea urchin.  A small bite exploding in different flavors... I can't even describe this one because it was a medley of the strangest flavors popping in and out of my mouth.  This dish ends with a sip of watercress soup served beneath the jello. 7) Halibut - black pepper, coffee, lemon: One of my favorite dishes of the night and presented in a snowy-white art form.  The fish was perfectly cooked, the hint of coffee flavor permeated occasionally, the crunchy ""shrimp chips"" and the flawless cream sauce played together in a strange, but perfect harmony. YUM. 8) Rabbit - Parfait, rillett, consommé: A three-tiered dish (literally, served in a 3 tiered cylindrical bowl) beginning with a cool rabbit parfait on the top layer that was creamy yet refreshing, culminated to a rabbit meat medley (a cube of shredded meat alongside a fried ball of meat) covered in king trumpet mushroom and surrounded by butternut sauce, and finally ending with a clear rabbit broth kept warm by a hot stone and flavored with a stick of cinnamon. 9) Wlid mushrooms - pine, sumac, ramp: Loving this mushroom medley of wild mushrooms from the Fresno foothills in CA (what what)... weirdly spongy but super flavorful... another favorite. 10) Hot Potato - cold potato, black truffle, butter: Another creative sip of soup served on a mini wax bowl with a pin poking through, spearing a bite of potato, black truffle, and frozen butter.  Pulling the pin releases these items into a cold potato broth... this dish was particularly different. 11) Short Rib - olive, red wine, blackberry: Yet another favorite dish.  Earlier during dinner we were presented with 2 red ""flags"" in criss cross formation, which seemed a strange table decor. At this point we realized that this ""flag"" was an edible homemade tomato pasta.  This pasta was then draped over a metal, cradlelike contraption that made space for the most tender and tasty short rib I've ever eaten.  A plate of sides and sauces containing sea salt, olives, blackberry, sour cherry were all fair game to garnish this ""pasta short rib wrap"".  Likely the most luxurious ""wrap"" I will ever eat; I was blown away. 12) Hamachi - West Indies spices, banana, ginger: served on a smoldering piece of cinnamon, this fried dish had a very ""Indian"" vibe to it although the banana felt like the centerpiece. 13) Canard - a la Cussy: Lots of ""best of""s during this meal, but this was the BEST DUCK I'VE EVER HAD.  A puff pastry stuffed with duck innards, foie gras, cock's crest (first time trying... it was good), and topped with the 3 most tender slices of duck I've ever had along with a tiny piece of fried duck skin.  I was getting really full at this point but I had to push through...  14) Venison - cherry, cocoa nib, eucalyptus: Once again, most tender piece of venison I've ever had.  Not gamey, served on a ""lily pad"" like presentation that covered the bite of deer heaven.

2011-03-16,5.0,"After going to this place, how could anything else ever impress me again?  When I went to Alinea, I had been traveling all over the country due to my job and was eating out almost every day. I enjoy good food, but at some point I was starting to experience restaurant fatigue at every ""fancy or great"" place I was going to. (Great, the steak tasted amazing, the fish was awesome, so on and so forth, but I felt like I'd seen the same ""twists"" at other restaurants).  Alinea was able to take my taste buds on a REAL adventure. It was like if you were straight edge and then all of a sudden you took acid. My world exploded.  The food. As others have mentioned, this is molecular gastronomy... which means most of the time you have no idea what you are eating. It's abstract art in edible form. But whatever comes out is whimsical and different from what you've experienced before. We went for the 24 course meal. Should have heeded the warning to NOT get the wine flight. They don't skimp on refilling your glass. We were so full and uncoordinated I felt like someone needed to carry me out of the restaurant.  The service: impeccable. Our sommelier and waiter were charming and extraordinarily patient with us, considering we were the last ones to leave the restaurant and also were generally making asses out of ourselves. (See above statement about NOT GETTING THE WINE FLIGHT to make sure you do not end up us.)  Playing Lady Gaga loudly over your iPhone for 30 seconds and asking what wine goes best with Filet-O-Fish is probably something that would get you kicked out of an establishment like this, yet somehow these folks managed to remain friendly and down-to-earth-best-Midwest-nice-without-being-overbearing.  Also, who would have thought it, but this is fine dining at its most accommodating: 1. One of our party is vegan, and the kitchen made all 24 of his courses vegan friendly. I was extremely impressed with the results.  For example, when the rest of our group got the infamous ""bacon on a swing"" dish, our veg friend got a dish that looked exactly like it. It was an apple slice, carved to look like a piece of bacon. Yes, I am easily amused. 2. If Grant Achatz is there, he will sign your menu. (Squeal now, foodies!) And even if he isn't, apparently you can ask for him to sign it anyways and then Alinea will mail it to you.

There is no menu, and everyone at your table will have the exact same thing.  If you have any dietary restrictions or allergies, be sure to let them know up front.   You'll start with some frozen cocktail creations, with just a touch of alcohol in each.  Other than this, there is no liquor so don't ask for a martini.  Then you'll move on to a few cold dishes and progress into the bigger, meatier dishes (including rabbit and a piece of venison, which was soooo good).  Try to keep count if you can, so you can pace yourself accordingly.  If you eat everything on your plate, you might be too full to enjoy the last several courses.  The dessert presentation is absolutely spectacular and unrivaled by anywhere else I've been.

2011-02-27,3.0,"I was in between giving this place a two and a three star rating. 2.5  Really cool entrance way. I felt like I was walking in a shrinking hallway, a la Willy Wonka.  The gentleman that greeted us at the front door was kinda rude. I typically do not put reservations under my last name because it is difficult to spell and a tad long. Usually I use my partners last name. So when he asked for the name on the reservation, I automatically gave my partners. No. Try my last name. No. Some confusion ensued. The reservation was under my name but it took about 5 minutes for him to find it and this guy kept insisting they did not have our reservation. This was my birthday and the restaurant is a special treat so I was starting to panic a bit. Fine, things happen, but I felt like he acted like this was my fault and he was rude and snobby about it and he did not apologize. Bad start.  Dining room service was nice. Several servers came by our table throughout the night and they were all professional with a bit of humor thrown in. Our waitress was a little soft spoken but did not mind answering any questions or repeating herself when asked. I liked that she not only listed the ingredients in the dishes but she also explained how to eat the courses that were served in nontraditional manners. Decor was very minimal but pretty. I wish they played music in the dining room. Awkward silence. I really don't want to hear the conversation from the table across the room. Also, the dining room was freezing. Our waitress said they were having problems with the heater and brought me a pashmina. The girl at the table across also requested one so I know it wasn't just me. Seriously, my toes were numb. Not cool when we are shelling out around $300 per person.  The food was interesting, theatrical, creative beyond creative. The presentations were some of the most creative I have ever seen. Taste wise though, most were just OK. Several dishes, 3 or 4, were overly salty. I like salt but it should enhance the flavor of food not BE the flavor. Very few dishes made me say, 'Wow. This tastes amazing.' Most were just good. Not great. For my taste, there were way to many dessert courses. Four or five I think. The grand finale dessert literally covered the entire table and I was already so done with sweet flavors. I didn't even really want to eat it, even though it was the best one. I kinda felt sick by that point!  The sommelier asked what we were going to drink. I did not want to do the tasting and he suggested I go with a glass of champagne. He was pleasant and not pushy about the wine tasting. I was a little surprised when the bill arrived. I believe the most expensive glass of champagne on the menu was $18 but somehow we were charged $25 per glass. Hmmm.  Alinea is definitely a unique dining experience. You will see and experience food here in a way that is unlike any other restaurant. I had fun and Alinea made this a memorable birthday. (I do not think I would have enjoyed it if we did not have a $500 gift card!) Overall, I just found the flavors to be lacking and have no desire to return.

2011-02-26,5.0,"We went to alinea for our first anniversary. Being foodies like most yelpers and living in chicago for about 7-8 years, we had to try it. I would agree with Patrick N, to not read the reviews too much and just try it for yourself. The surprises and theatrics of the meal are what make it. This was one of the most memorable experiences I have had in a meal, and its worth the price for once every couple of years when they change the menu. We have a full set of pictures from when we went, and i may upload the video of Grant Achatz making our desert. He didnt do this for everyone, so we felt particularly lucky that he did it for our table. The food is of course amazing, and even if you have dietary restrictions, which we did, they will be accommodate every request.  There are some reviews of people who did not have an excellent time, so this may happen to some and if it does to you, that sucks because you will be footing a pricey bill. However, for the most part, people leave happy, and thats hard to do when people are paying 250+ a person.",0.9264,0.859,0.102,0.039,0.5898809523809524
2011-02-23,3.0,"For my 1400th review, I decided to write it on a special place but it was unfortunately not so special for me. I heard recently it was rated 3 Michelin Stars, good for you I supposed. At the sake of what my friend hates people doing on Yelp, I seriously, desperately, crazily wanted to like this place. From Chuckeats to my foodie-tastic Yelp friends from home, everyone had been raving about this place and somehow I lucked out on scoring the last reservation on Independence day at 6 pm. Awesome! But that's pretty much where the good experience ended. I specifically spoke to the reservationist on the phone about bringing a fine bottle of $200 wine that I had been saving for this occasion. She neither mentioned their alcohol policy nor told me anything about my wine. Chicago is a BYOB centric town, so this was my expectation. When we first arrived, I brought out the bottle and one of the waiters stared at me and said ""We don't do that here."" It wasn't rude, it wasn't friendly, it wasn't polite but in the end he just looked at me like I was some dumb foreigner. I tried to explain that I had told the reservationist on the phone and no one told me it was a non-BYOB place. He got into an ARGUMENT with me over this, and in the end I had to say, you know, I will put it away. He basically captured the attention of the whole dining room area, so everyone was entertained I suppose. Classy. My goodness, if I were a restaurant that perhaps did not mention to the guest that they were not BYOB in a BYOB town, I would at least be nicer about it. Then, the food. We opted for wine because I wanted some but their choice was mediocre and the bottle was $100+ for .. mediocre. The food came, and it was a confusing string of random servers, not our server, and then our waiter changed, and then it was a waitress, and then I ended up having to ask for water 6 times. I expect this at Chili's, I don't expect to pay $600+ for a meal and have to ask them to refill my water when it's empty, not once, but 6 times. I expect consistency, the servers, the waiters, the people putting food in front of you. I expect them to know what they're talking about and if asked what the gelatin is made out of, I expect them to know. If they don't know, then they should ask and get back to me, not run away and not murmur a word. Who does that? Every dish was subpar because although it was elegantly presented, the flavors clashed, the play on traditional cooking did not work out and half of the time the waiters didn't bother to even tell us how to eat it. If you make it complicated with no instructions, perhaps we're not enjoying it correctly? In the end, even the main dish, the steak, I had high expectations, but mine was cold and the bf's was warm, hence ours were differently cooked thus did not taste the same even though we both opted for medium rare. When I got the bill, I just felt unsatisfied.  I've been to restaurants fancier and pricier, I've been to other 3 Michelin stars and some 2 Michelin stars that deserve one more, but the food here did not do it for me, especially with all the confusion. The service was terrible, who argues with a guest and makes a scene in front of other guests? And the whole evening was stiffly subpar and awkward after the experience. Ugh. Will not be back. Will be heading to L2O this time.",0.9574,0.798,0.112,0.089,0.5686490683229813

So I get on the trusty ole' computer and sign on to my faithful  yelp.com ... I look up the Chicago sight, and BAM! at the top of the list... Alinea. I read several reviews and I am sold! I get on the phone and make a reservation, about a month and half away from our anniversary I was fortunate enough that they have an opening the day prior to our anniversary, so take it, these guys are booked solid, can't pass up this opportunity, right? I pretty much have the trip planned, this is going to be a foodie journey, Alinea, Moto,Blackbird, Avec, Burt's Place, Perry's, Silver Palm, Super Doug's and then fly back home.... so Alinea is first, the plan is to fly out the morning of the reservation, get to the hotel freshen up relax and get ready for our special evening, we can hardly wait.... So the morning of our departure... we wake up late and miss our 6:30AM flight... okay let's not freak out... we'll standby hopefully we can get on the next one... 10am... nope, 12pm... nope...2pm...:(... 4pm... announcement ""next three flights to Chicago are canceled!!!!!"" WHAT!!! We have no choice but call the restaurant and cancel our special anniversary dinner :(... they are booked solid for the next three days that we'll be in town...we get a new flight for the next morning same time...and figure oh well maybe next time... So we arrive on time and fly out... we arrive relax for awhile, walk downtown go to Perry's for an awesome Pastrami sandwich, and my wife makes the obligatory trek to H&M.... while we're there I get a call from Alinea... they've had a cancellation for 6:30pm tonight... it's 3:30, I say YES, and drag my wife out of the store and hurry back to the hotel so she can take her mandatory 2 hrs to get ready journey....finally we make it! (had to cancel reservations at Avec, but reschedule for lunch the next day.) So we arrive at the brownstone building with really nothing to identify it as Alinea, other than a valet guy right outside... we walk in to Star Ship Enterprise's walkway... I have no idea where I'm going, LOL we walk a few steps and a door to the left opens, we are greeted by name at the door by the hostess and follow her to our table, a bottle of wine is waiting for us as I had this arranged earlier. Let the experience commence.... English Pea, Shad Roe, distillation of thai flavors, Pork Belly, Sturgeon, King Crab, Duck, Hot Potato, Tournedo, Black Truffle, Earl Grey, Chocolate... and bubblegum... our menu.... AMAZING.

My boyfriend always says that dessert should never come in big portions so that you're left wanting more.  Alinea gives you just that: small bites of rich flavor.   There were definitely some dishes that I didn't enjoy as much as others.  But this is really a personal preference issue and in the end I was still intrigued by what I was eating. The one thing that made my experience less than perfect is that for the dessert portion, the chef did not come out to prepare it for us like he did at all the other tables around us.  I was really looking forward to meeting him, so I was very bummed out about this (and felt left out).  But I understand that he needs a break and cannot do it for every single table.  I just wish he hadn't skipped our table!",0.9743,0.827,0.148,0.024,0.4240929705215419

Alinea is a 3 star Michelin rated restaurant and worthy of it's praise and plethora of 5 star reviews. Buuuuut,  I write reviews for me and this is about me and I write reviews for two reasons. Number 1, to support places I really believe in (see Toto review) and 2. To give the MANY readers of my reviews a fair snapshot of what to expect. With this being said, if you love steak and baked potatoes and do not consider yourself an adventurous eater do not even think of dining here.

Actually ""dish"" isn't accurate, each course is just a mere taste. But trust me, that's what you want here.  The dining room is easily the quietest I have ever been in. I felt like I was in a library during finals weeks. Usually I equate a quiet dining room with a stuffy or intimate setting. This was a mix of the two, I did not feel at all uncomfortable and found it be a nice experience.  Other reviews describe this place is being innovative and groundbreaking. It might be here, but the food preparation reminded me a place back in UK which the name escapes me at the moment. Was it the Fat Duck? Big Duck? Awkward Duck? I am pretty sure it had Duck in there somewhere.  In the end I can honestly say this place is a 5 star restaurant but I am not giving it five stars even though it deserves it.

We arrived at the front steps on Alinea and was greeted by a doorman that opened the door. We walked in only seeing walls and no door. So what did we do? We continued walking and prayed for a door to appear.  All of a sudden *poof* a secret door slid open on the left and we walked through and was greeted by a hostess. We waited a few minutes while our table was being set up and took a glimpse of the kitchen. The kitchen was immaculate and things were moving like clock work. While walking upstairs to our table I saw that the room was very modern and minimal with a touch of techno . I don't know. It's hard to explain. We were seated, greeted, and given a snippet of what was to come. The menu was not given to us because they wanted it to be more of a surprise.  Once situated, the meal began and we were served 22 courses of gastronomically incredible dishes.

A piece of caramelized bacon suspended from a little bow (and arrow) contraption... or the straw where you suck a milkshake out? It tasked like nothing and was a gross texture.

2011-01-18,4.0,"My girlfriend and I went here just to experience what is supposed to be one of the best restaurants in the world - we're not huge foodies or anything like that (and because of that maybe we didn't appreciate some of the nuances of the food/experience) we just wanted to see what all the fuss was about. First of all, the service was some of the best I've ever had in terms of them being there to help you out and make you truly enjoy your meal.  My one gripe is that we were waited on by several people throughout the meal rather than one waiter which made it pretty impersonal in my opinion, and sometimes when I wanted to ask about some of the more ""out-there"" dishes I didn't really feel comfortable enough with the waiter to do so. Now the food.  There was a huge array of different tastes, so it would be tough to love everything or hate everything.  The one thing I will say is that all of the food you'll eat here is stuff you will never have had before, nor will you ever have again.  Most of it is a hodgepodge of really interesting flavors that you'd never think to put together -- for me, some of these combos worked and some didn't.  Overall I felt the meal leaned a little too much to the sweet and rich side of things, and I found myself always hoping the next course would be something light and not so rich.  There were a couple of courses that I thought were really good, but nothing that I absolutely loved.  On the other hand there were a couple of things that I really didn't care for at all, but as I said earlier that's to be expected with such a wide array of interesting combinations. All in all I would say that for the average joe, Alinea is more for the experience than for the food alone.  My conclusion was that I certainly didn't regret going (even with the big pricetag), but it's also something I don't want or need to do again.   If you've got the money, absolutely go. It's a lot of fun and is a great experience.  If you're like me though, I don't think you'll find yourself breaking down the door to get back anytime soon.",0.9871,0.804,0.138,0.057,0.49322691197691176
2011-01-17,5.0,"The day has finally come. I get to review Alinea on Yelp.  Let me preface by saying: no, I'm NOT worthy. And also, I'm sorry if I overly geek-out during this review. Totally out of my control.  From the moment I entered through the walkway, I knew something major was up with this place. Two steel doors suddenly opened on my left, and a team - an army - of men dressed in fine suits where there to greet me and take my coat.  It was truly as if they had been expecting me.  Before being guided upstairs to my table, to my right, I caught a glimpse of the kitchen. About 30 people dressed in white were hunched over, their faces just inches from their dishes. Each of them intimately perfecting their plates before blasting them off to the dining room. Truly a sight to see.  In total contrast to what was going on downstairs in the kitchen, I was seated in a silent dining room upstairs. I had the pleasure of eating with a top chef from Holland who had just finished externing in Mr. Achatz's kitchen for the last two weeks. So aside from being in the number-one restaurant in the nation, it also didn't hurt that I was across from the best dining companion in the world.  Service began with with a waiter (you will have about 10 throughout the night, which is why I say ""a"" waiter as opposed to ""our"" waiter) asking if we had any food allergies. Then, he proceeded to discuss the wine options: a tasting to go alongside the 22-course menu, or we could peruse their robust wine list. I had no doubt their collection of wines would be stellar, but we intrinsically opted for the pairings, so as not to skimp on this experience one bit.  And so it began with a champagne cocktail sent up from Grant. Cheers to that.  Throughout the service, the wait staff was like an acting troupe in the way that they dramatically and believably presented each course and wine pairing. From the way they pulled out the table for me to use the restroom, or the way they switched my water glass when my lip prints started to pile up, or how they unfolded my napkin on my lap...it was all done in such a theatrical way. I felt like a queen.  As the courses arrived, each one was more unexpected than the last. It was so hard for me to focus on what I was eating at the moment, because I was still in awe about the last thing I put into my mouth, yet was anxious for the next dish to be dropped. Sounds like a personal problem, I know :-)  There were so many other elements besides consumption going on during this perfectly paced, 3.5 hour meal. The chef truly piques your curiosity and plays with all your senses. You can tell he has a sense of humor as well, as there are times you are challenged to ""play"" with your food. You'll notice that some of the hardware used to serve the dishes are designed exclusively for Alinea, for your meal. What an incredible thought.  At one point, the silverware and china gets replaced with something that looks like what French royalty in the 1500's ate off of. I felt like I was in different places and times throughout the night, all from the corner table in an unmarked Lincoln Park restaurant.  I truly don't want to go into detail about the dishes, as everyone deserves to be surprised when going to this place. I will say that you won't be disappointed by anything, at all. And even after 22 courses, you won't be ""full"" - you'll be completely and utterly satisfied on every level, however.  The absolute highlight of the night was dessert for me. Sure it was delicious, but the real bonus was in Grant coming to the table to prepare it in front of us himself. I will never, EVER forget that moment. It was like watching Da Vinci paint the Mona Lisa.  Needless to say, Alinea is not a restaurant. It was a museum. I didn't arrive hungry to scarf down food. I came to pay admission and wander through each exhibit and learn something, experience something.  I would highly recommend this experience at Alinea to everyone who can appreciate the art behind food and exceptional food service. There is an energy within this institution that is literally life-changing. I left exhausted, like my mind had been blown for 3.5 hours straight. It was a feeling I've never known before.  This experience comes with a price tag. If you can afford it, do it. If you're a foodie who can't readily drop this much on a bill, understandable. But save up for it and treat yourself fully. Trust me, your brain will not have space to worry about money when you are going through 22 plates of utter perfection.  Five, undisputed stars and the best dining experience of my life, for sure.",0.9991,0.805,0.167,0.028,0.541535303776683

2011-01-14,5.0,i hesitated on doing a review of alinea since its so well known and so expensive but i think my objective in doing it is to say it was worth it. growing up in the business i have always always always always always believed foodservice is about experience NOT just the food. you can apply that to a place like mcdonalds or a place like charlie trotters. alinea just takes it to a whole new level. its perfect for foodies obviously. service was great and i say this because i look so young and i went several years ago with a gf at the time yet they took us seriously. they didn't have gloves and aprons waiting for us thinking we wouldn't be able to pay. they treated us very very well. food was actually great if you were wondering and i hope anyone whose never heard of molecular gastronmy or has a love of it will go.  it got voted best restaurant in the world one year.  also if you've never head of grant achatz story about his tongue - google it. there will be several LONG articles about his journey with cancer. i think esquire had a really long story. i think its going to be a movie soon. think about it: what is the worst possible sensory capability he could have lost being a chef??,0.9832,0.727,0.186,0.087,0.5017243867243867

2011-01-08,5.0,"Truly the most memorable and inspiring dining experience of my life. Period.  A recently crowned Michelin 3 star establishment, Alinea represented the confluence of dinner theatre, flawless service execution, and of course, epicurean enlightenment. There wasn't a course that wasn't an epiphany which was impressive considering the 18+ courses on the menu. Progressive techniques, dubbed ""molecular gastronomy"" a term to sciencese and lacking emotion for me, were omnipresent and used with astonishing creativity and finesse. A quick note on menu navigation, there is significance to the unique layout of the menu: larger bubbles mean larger portions; darker bubbles signify more intensely flavored dishes; and as the bubbles move from left to right, they move from savory to sweet. Highlights for me included: The Black Truffle Explosion, which might be Chef Achatz's signature dish. Instructed by the server to consume in one bite, the shell breaks and the intense, earthy truffle flavor floods the senses Escoffier course of Canard a la Cussy complete with period glassware and flatware was like being transported back in time and makes me even more anxious for Next to open The smoldering stick the venison course was presented on as well as the earl grey pillows were unexpected and impressive sensory touches Last by certainly not least, Chef Achatz prepared our final course on our table which will forever be seared into my memory. Seeing him demonstrate his craft that close was more celebrity awe-educing than seeing stars when I lived in LA. Service was a perfectly choreographed affair. Servers were knowledgeable, approachable, and attentive without the pretention you would expect at a restaurant of this caliber and never did I feel like there were a half-dozen pairs of eyes were staring at me. In fact, the only anomaly in what was otherwise a perfect dining experience was when the sommelier tried to upsell us on the reserve wine pairing while we were already a couple of glasses in on the standard pairing which costs ""3/4 the cost of the tasting menu.""

2011-01-03,5.0,"I've been to Alinea 3 times, it is without a doubt, my most memorable dining experience ever. Alinea isn't just about food, it's about going to Alinea. If I had more disposable income, I'd go once every other  quarter instead of once every other year. It's as truly amazing as you've heard. Writing a yelp review seems pointless since if you're considering going to Alinea, then yelp isn't going to change your mind about it. If you've got the dough, go. I'm not going to bother criticizing the place since every time I've been there, everything is perfect. For those people dissing this place for anything, they don't truly understand the concept of the restaurant. You don't go here just to eat, Alinea isn't just a restaurant. You go here for an experience, Alinea is like dinner and a show, but the dinner is the show. The guy on here that compared the price to going to a sports game and a nice dinner before or after, he's full of shizz. Alinea is going to cost you. The time I brought my girlfriend for her birthday and did the wine pairings with the full ""tour"", it cost me more after tax and tip than my mortgage payment did that month. It goes without saying that if you've got the money, and your adventurous with food, you gotta do it at least once in your lifetime. I've found that after several trips, it starts to lose it's luster, since in my opinion, Alinea is more about the experience than it is about the food. You start to see trends in the experience if you repeat your business there. Some things will always be different, but some things stay the same. Chef Achatz is the Willy Wonka of fine dining, but it's his food coupled with the experience of eating the food which makes Alinea unique. From the way you enter the restaurant to the way you are given your check, everything about Alinea is unique to Alinea. Each course comes out on it's own specially made ""serving utensil"" from a metal swing with bacon wrapped in butterscotch, to a wax bowl of soup with a pin in it. Chef Achatz and his astonishingly creative staff deserve all the praise they are constantly given. They aren't the only ones in the game though. Many chefs have gotten into the molecular gastronomy scene. Chicago local Moto will give Alinea a run for the money as it is more affordable, and more interactive. The bottom line is Alinea is absolutely amazing, it's an experience you will never forget, and you should go at least once in your lifetime if you have the funding to do so and a very open mind about dining. I'll be the first to admit, the whole thing seems a lot better when someone else pays the check, but even if it's your credit card that's being run at the end of the meal, you won't ever forget what it went to pay for.",0.9895,0.894,0.093,0.013,0.5832393483709272

2010-12-24,4.0,"I have literally changed my rating from 4 to 5 and back again at least 10 times. What I struggle with in rating Alinea is whether or not food should be evaluated as art.  Powerful visual art is not always pleasant to look at, but it doesn't matter because its purpose isn't always pleasure. Maybe this makes me unsophisticated, but I cannot shake the feeling that eating is a more basic, hedonistic pleasure than other art forms and  therefore should be evaluated on the basis of sensory experience alone and not sensory+cerebral experience. There is no doubt that the food at Alinea is provocative and that the experience of dining there is absolutely extraordinary. BUT, some parts of my meal were unmemorable or flat out weird, and I don't know if I can ignore that. Dining at Alinea is more like going to a modern art show than eating at a restaurant--the experience is meant to play with your senses, confuse you, and challenge you to think differently about food. It absolutely accomplishes all of those things. The restaurant itself was designed in such a way that you felt isolated from the rest of the world and oblivious to the passing of time. The service was impeccable-- the server even noticed that I'm a lefty and adjusted his service accordingly.  Some parts of the meal were more delicious than anything I've ever tasted in my life (e.g. Black Truffle Explosion, Hot Potato). Other parts, though, were conceptually and experientially interesting but I found the flavors to be too weird to be enjoyable (e.g. Bubblegum).

2010-12-13,4.0,"Alinea is an interesting restaurant experience.  The creativity and innovation are probably unmatched in the U.S, so it's worth checking out.  But I can't say that it was the greatest meal that I've ever had.  You have to have a good idea of what you're signing up for.  First, the portion sizes are quite small, so you wonder if you'll be full by the end of the meal.  I will temper this first critique a bit, since it is a twenty course meal and they don't want people to feel uncomfortable.  Next, I thought that a lot of the dishes were quite complex and had too many ingredients battling for center stage, which dilutes the impact of those certain flavors that may not need to share the spotlight. Additionally, the ""hands on"" experience of some of the dishes may generate ""oohs"" and ""aahhs"" from some diners, but can just as easily be viewed as smug and contrived by others.  Lastly, I found the service to be just average; many of our servers were twenty-something males that exuded a vibe that was a bit frat-boy/haughty/irreverent as opposed to my expectation of a more gracious/respectful experience.  What really got to me was that after we left an 18% tip on the pre-tax bill - which I thought was more than sufficient given the $195 prix fixe - one of the servers voiced his displeasure about the gratuity to his colleague, who gave him a compassionate ""That sucks"", all while we were still within earshot.  Not cool. In sum, Chef Achatz's mastery of the food arts is worth experiencing, and Alinea's reputation as a culinary Mecca for food enthusiasts is well-deserved.  But if you're looking for a simple, well-executed, hunger-satisfying meal, then you may want to consider other options.",0.966,0.863,0.103,0.034,0.41104269293924467

2010-12-08,5.0,"My boyfriend has been bugging me to open a Yelp account for some time now.  We love to eat out and try new restaurants, especially when we're traveling, so he thought that I should share our experiences with others since Yelp reviews have helped us narrow down new places to try in the past.  But it wasn't until I ate at Alinea that I was inspired to write a review.  So I dedicate this first review to him and Alinea, if you can do such a cheesy thing. Before I get into a few details, I would sum up Alinea as the best dining experience I've had so far.  It beats Daniel and LeBernadin in NY, Providence and Sona in LA, Robuchon L'atelier and even Bar Charlie in Vegas (Bar Charlie being my favorite fine dining restaurant until Alinea).  My first visit to Chicago was last week.  We went for my boyfriend's birthday and were able to snatch a last minute reservation at Alinea on Friday night at 5:30 p.m.  When we first called, they were all booked for December but the trick is to keep calling each day for any last minute cancellations.  Because Alinea charges something like $100 per person if you don't cancel within 48 hours or so of the reservation, people who can't make it tend to cancel early to avoid this expense.  So don't give up if you can't get a table the first time.  Keep trying.   5:30 p.m. is pretty early for dinner if you ask me, especially since we're from California and that meant eating dinner at 3:30 p.m.  But it couldn't have worked out better.  The restaurant consists of two floors.  Upstairs is divided into two rooms. They have two seatings per night, one starting at around 5:30 and the other around 7:30 p.m. or so and the in between reservations are staggered.  Because we were the first in our seating, every dish that came out was a complete surprise to us.  The patrons who arrived later would see our dishes being served, and thus, the element of surprise was somewhat spoiled for them.  So don't feel bad if you get a 5 or 5:30 p.m. reservation. Because I don't want to ruin the surprise for anyone thinking about trying Alinea, I won't go through the 20 or so items that we had.  We are not wine drinkers so we did not get the pairing; they do not have any other alcohol other than some beers.  They don't give you a menu until the end of the meal, as a keepsake.  The menu changes seasonally.  Of the 20 items we had,  there were 3 misses.  I disliked most the rabbit consomme and could not finish it.  But  most of the dishes were original, creative and tasty, and about five or six dishes were to die for.  With the $195 charge per person, nominal fee for bottled water and my cappuccino, tax and a 20% tip, the bill for two was about $530.  My boyfriend and I both thought the experience was well worth it and we would definitely go back the next time we are in Chicago (especially because Bar Charlie is now closed :()",0.9883,0.861,0.104,0.035,0.4634321942832582

2010-12-05,5.0,"Okay, I'm editing my review because I've realized that my previous post didn't do Alinea justice.  Let's start at the beginning: About three years ago, my husband (then boyfriend) treated his parents and I to Alinea. He kept talking about this restaurant that was difficult to get reservations for, and was excited that we had somehow gotten lucky enough to secure a spot on a Friday night. I didn't pay too much attention to him, just figured that we were going to what was probably going to be a nice dinner. Even the fact that I knew beforehand that we were in for a 24 course extravaganza, which I hadn't ever heard of before, couldn't have prepared me in the slightest for the experience we were about to have. God, I had no idea back then.  Anyhow, we arrive at the restaurant and have a seat near the window. We decide on the 24 course dinner with the wine pairing. The waiter brought us some perfectly wonderful and delicious bread, and my first instinct is to devour it until our server friend wisely advises us against this, telling us that if we skip anything, it's going to have to be the bread.  Long story short, 24 courses and (I kid you not) a few tears of joy later, my life is forever changed. I have married my boyfriend, and we have tried to live more humbly in order to save up for experiences like the one we had at Alinea. We travel around the country, and indeed the world in search of the most amazing culinary experiences, ones that make you close your eyes and bury your face in your hands in utter and sublime disbelief.  Pregnancy has put a bit of a hold on our adventures, but after the baby is born we are planning on perhaps celebrating back at Alinea, though we admit to feeling a bit nervous, as we don't know how our next experience can possibly top the last.",0.9792,0.841,0.128,0.031,0.4625
2010-12-04,5.0,"Yelping Alinea seems stupid, since it's universally accepted as the best restaurant in Chicago, if not the country, but I do have one thing I would like to contribute to the discussion, on the subject of price, particularly for those who have never been before. I want to add that you cannot compare the expense to prior dining experiences, but rather to some other entertainment, or even travel. Here's a scenario: you get a couple choice tickets to the theater, orchestra, Hawks game, whatever ($200?), have a reasonably priced meal with wine for two before or after ($150?). There. You're about at the price for two for Alinea, and since Alinea dining averages four hours, you've spent the same amount of time either night. Compare the price to that, not to that of your (current) favorite restaurant.  And I'm willing to bet that Alinea would be the one of the two options above that you remember for the rest of your life. It's definitely more out of this world. My wife and I do not have money fights. She's a teacher, I'm a community college mid-level administrator. We made it work to come here, twice, by not dining out for a few weeks in a row and giving up booze each time, which is not exactly a sacrifice in order to afford something for which there exists simply no other comparable or approximate experience. Alinea is not another restaurant - it's its own type of satisfaction.   A digressing note to any Alinea employee potentially reading this.  Off the bat, you all do perfect work, thank you for doing so much to really enhance the first and second best dining experiences I've ever had. I admire your memory capabilities, agility juggling dishes and superlative commitment to service. It is in the most constructive vein that I suggest you stop the practice of pretending to remember - to the very date even  -- the last time a customer dined at your restaurant. It's at best cute when you open a food explanation with a pseudo-spontaneous ""I believe when you were here last April, the 12th was it, when you had the..."" Especially when you did not serve us last time. Maybe some CRM research shows other diners think you really remembered them and appreciate the fleeting specialness, but I doubt it.

2010-11-21,5.0,"I refuse to start this review with Alinea is an ""experience"" because this is a cliche. In any case, a better description of Alinea is an ""achievement"" -  this restaurant has succeeded in making dinner a singular event. As you would expect from a restaurant that has been named #1 in North America and #7 in the world, the food is beyond description (at least mine). Ingredients, preparation, presentation and, most importantly, taste are all marvels. The service is exemplary -- it seemed as though a small army was at our disposal throughout the night. That being said, I have dined at other restaurants that excel in these areas as well. What pushes Alinea further yet is its attention to detail. From the creation of many of its own intricate eating utensils to the number of special options available (reserve wine flights and truffles shaved table-side), to having our car waiting out in front as we exited, Alinea is as close to perfection as a restaurant can realistically hope to get. As you might expect, you pay for the privilege of dining there (the bill for two was four figures). For most, choosing Alinea will come down to a number of ""ifs"" -  if your palette is up to the adventure, if you can afford it, and if you can appreciate the little things that put it in rarefied air, find your way to this experience (damn, used that word after all).",0.9847,0.832,0.154,0.014,0.53109410430839
2010-11-14,4.0,"My wife and I really enjoyed the food at Alinea although we thought the service was a little robotic and the overall experience was a little bit flat.  By way of reference my favorite high end restaurant is probably Jean Georges.  Same for my wife.  The building is nondescript and I dont think there is any signage other than the valet parking sign.  Its just this black building.  Even when I passed by the next day I only saw the address numerals on the building - no signage.  The doorman came to the cab to get us.  The hallway is wavy and bathed in a red light.  We went down the hall and were greeted in a friendly manner.  I looked to my side and through a clear door saw the kitchen.  I think I saw Grant A. doing something.  We decided to go with wine pairing and we also opted for the one special of the night - a risotto with brown butter and white truffles (extra $75 each).  We declined the Riserva wine option - this would have been $250 each.  Instead it was $160 which they tell you is approximately 3/4 of the price of the meal.  The meal is $195 pp.  Our wine Sommelier was great - this guy was a big poofy hairdo.  He had a great personality and was very knowledgeable.  I really enjoyed the 4th dish of Golden Trout Roe - a delicious dish.  I love the texture of the roe and the flavor with coconut, licorice and pineapple was fantastic.  She loved the 5th dish of yuba, shrimp, miso and togarashi - it's like a long, crunchy snack that tastes like shrimp and is coated in seeds with great flavor.  The vessel it comes in has a dipping sauce hidden in a little chamber.  Very tasty.  I didnt care for the 6th dish of  Chao Tom - sugar cane, shrmp, mint - you chew it for a bit and it reminded me of like what Id imagine it would be like to chew bamboo or some 'reedy' plant.  It was OK.  7th - halibut, blk pepper, vanilla, lemon: fantastic, flavorful, light, delicious combination of flavors.  8th - a shot of apple, horseradish and celery - it's in a glass with this big, exploding sphere.  Open wide, swallow and shut quickly -  the sphere is large and then it pops.  Nice palate cleanser I guess.  9th - Rabbit - parfait, rillette, consomme - you get this white piece of serviceware and it has three parts.  The first part at the top is the parfait and then they remove that and inside is the rabbit rillette and then they remove that and its the soup.  All delicious and I love rabbit and I love that you get to experience it with different textures and temperatures all in one experience.  10th - white truffle with parmesean, brown butter and truffle - so simple but so amazing.  Perfectly cooked and made so much better with funky, delicious truffles.  It was a few spoonfuls - worth $75?  In a way, yes, but I wish it was just 2 or 3 spoonfuls more.  Although I left Alinea full so I guess it is planned this way on purpose.  11th - Pheasant, green grape, shallot, burning leaf - the meat is on the end of a branch with leaves that smelled like they were likely burned.  This very pleasant perfume accompanies this tender, flavorful bite of the meat.  12th - short rib, olive, red wine, blackberry - at the start of the meal, the staff drapes this orange thing that looks like a fruit rollup over two black things that look like chopsticks.  They tell you this is for later.  It's pasta - a ravioli sheet.  They give you a board with the above ingredients and some others like black garlic and salt.  You put it all into your ravioli.  So delicious.  13th - hot potato cold potato, black truffle, butter - you get a little wax bowl with a pin in it that holds cold potato elements. You pull the pin from the bottom and it falls into the hot elements - quickly eat and savor the flavors.  14th - pigeonneau - apparently its a very old classic dish executed exactly.  So just imagine a perfect flaky litttle tart crust with meat and cream and vegetable inside - small and wonderful.  Light, not heavy - but rich tasting.  15th - black truffle explosion - you bite this package on the spoon and this wonderful flavor of truffle explodes in your mouth.  the desserts of bacon, carmel popcorn, earl grey and chocolate were fantastic but I didnt care for the whole bubblegum ""suck out of the tube"" exeprience.  Total damage with wine and tip and tax was around $1100.  Despite the muted overall experience, the food, the sommelier and being with my wife made it worth it.  Id most likely go back next time Im in town.  However, I might skip the wine pairing as it was a bit too much for us.  Not so much me, although I was pretty buzzed, but my wife had a head-ache next day",0.9988,0.819,0.157,0.024,0.4922418814620649

You'll be greeted by a warm, knowledgeable, and FRIENDLY staff ready to attend to your every dining whim and answer any of your curiosities.   Now, for the food!  20 courses of delight--best 3  1/2 hours of dining I've ever had.  First up, a trio of edible ""shots""--Lemon, Apple, and Squash flavors.  Then golden trout roe on top of coconut mousse and pineapple foam with a licorice sauce.  Next up, a shrimp stick eaten with your hands and dipped in Miso mayo.  Right next to it was a take on Vietnamese ""chao tom""--compressed sugar cane flavor + shrimp and mint.  Monochromatic ""white dish""--halibut with black pepper (bleached white), vanilla, and lemon.  Apple with horseradish and celery juice...in a shot glass...culminating in a liquid explosion in your mouth!  Now we get to some really interesting stuff--a rabbit trio (parfait, rillettes, consommé) served in an egg shaped babushka.  That means the parfait was on the top layer, the rillettes (with blood sausage) on the middle layer, and the consommé as the bottom layer.  A-MA-ZING.  Next, I smelled smoke.  What is burning??  Ah, the staff bring out burning oak leaves!  And somewhere in that mix sits a scrumptious pheasant dumpling with green grape and walnut nestled inside.  Now it's time to use our hands to play with food: ravioli skin + short ribs + olives + blackberry + smoked sea salt = the bomb! Next is a shot of cold potato, black truffle, and butter.  Following that is a ""pigeonneau""--that's squab prepared foie gras style and resting on top of a puff pastry--DELISH!  But my FAVORITE dish of the night had to be the Black Truffle ""explosion"" with hint of romaine and parmesan.  Let me tell you, after eating this, everyone at my table took a moment of silence to savor what they just experienced.  It was THAT good. No joke. Now that we've worked our way through the savory dishes, it's time to ""warmup"" to dessert by consuming a pineapple and ham infused crisp (tastes like the best Hawaiian pizza you'd have), butterscotch and apple flavored smoked bacon, and a caramel popcorn ""shot"".  OUT. OF. THIS. WORLD. If that wasn't enough, now on to the REAL dessert:  Earl Grey shortbread mixed with lemon curd, pine nuts, and caramelized white chocolate.  Bubble Gum ""straw"" with tapioca balls that you suck right out of the straw!  To Finish, a fantastic chocolate dish with blueberry, honey, and peanut that just sets the mood right for the end of the night. And to boot, the staff took us on a tour of the 2-story, 3-dining room, space and, of course, I couldn't resist picking up Chef Grant Achatz's cookbook.   If you couldn't tell by now, this dining EXPERIENCE blew my mind--the best I've had so far!  I can't recommend Aliena enough if you happen to be in Chicago.  Or you could do what I did and book your flight to Chicago around a successful reservation to Alinea.  Trust me, it's worth every dollar (and you'll spend a lot of dollars here).  Alinea does not disappoint.  I wish I could eat here every night.",0.996,0.851,0.129,0.02,0.398559670781893

For $250 for this dinner, service was impeccable, as expected.  Overall, though, all of the savory courses were overly salty.  Don't the chefs taste the creations and/or make sure it's perfection before sending them out?  DISAPPOINTING!  I couldn't even finish the rabbit consumme, even though it was probably $7/spoonful.  And why was there something that resembled a baby walrus tooth hidden in the fried part of my course #9?

A few of the dishes were like nothing I had ever tasted before and couldn't even begin to place.  It was a super cool experience. One minute you're having a fun shot that explodes in your mouth, and the next they're giving you a recipe out of the 1900s with chargers and crystal from the period to match. Another thing I loved was that for being the top restaurant in the country and #7 in the world, it's totally unpretentious. You go to a place like Everest, and you know you're getting classic, gang-style French service. It's very formal and almost stiff, but that's the classic French style. Then you go to a place like Blackbird, that kind of claims to be that hip, casual thing, but they are so holier-than-thou hipster cool with their service that it was a real turn off for me. It's like they're trying too hard, you know? So not the case with Alinea. Not only is the food super creatively presented, but for all its formality and expense, it's not stuffy or fake-ly cool. It's actually casual, like when they present you with the wrap that you must eat with your hands, or our sommelier that had Carrot Top's hair (seriously, at my husband's old restaurant, they didn't even want him to have his goatee).   Go for the wine pairing, it's delicious, and it's pretty fun to be buzzed as you're trying out all these crazy presentations.",0.9952,0.769,0.212,0.019,0.5437599681020734
2010-11-02,5.0,"After dining at Alinea, I was torn about how I felt overall. After a couple days I realized that, in my opinion at least, Alinea may have to be reviewed in a different context than other restaurants. I'm not going to claim that I know good food, or that I have an amazing sense for anything culinary, but I do feel that I have a strong appreciation for the heart and soul people pour into creating and maintaining their vision of a restaurant. I've heard some people compare Grant Achatz to Willy Wonka, and I would have to agree with that assessment. I enjoyed myself and my meal immensely. I would have to say that the service and presentation of the food stood out the most. While outstanding service is self-explanatory, the presentation of each course was meticulously crafted. Everything down to the custom-made plates and sculpture-like items used to present the food was inspired.  The taste of the food, however, was varied and not always in a good way. I realize that I am not going to be wowed by every single course, but my palette left me wanting more of the 'one bite' style courses and less of the heavy, rich ones. I understand that it's just how the cards fell, but it was a bit of a bummer for me (because, darn it, that Hot Potato / Cold Potato dish was so good!)  I supposed I will have to consult the Alinea book my wife purchased to see how I can make that and the awesome Bubble Yum stock.  That's not to say I didn't appreciate each course. The flow of the meal was perfectly paced. The starting courses revolved around lighter, cleaner flavors and slowly progressed into rich and heavy offerings before transitioning into the dessert portions.  Over the course of the 3  1/2 hour meal, the staff starts to feel like old friends (especially if you've had some wine). Which brings me to another point - they specialize in wine pairings and offer a small selection of beer only. So you won't be able to booze it up while you eat :) Overall, I feel that this was indeed a special once-in-a-lifetime type of meal. It did not change my life, nor did it make me feel like I ascended to some higher state of consciousness. Instead, it was a pleasant and unique diversion from anything you might come to expect from your typical critically-acclaimed restaurant.

It borrowed shamelessly from other cultures, and the outcome paled in comparison or was completely wrong. Seriously, the ignorance. But could the average diner even tell? I could rip into some of the 'bites' in more detail but it's not worth it. The homage to Escoffier was the worst for me - the squab was lukewarm, which is oh so ironic. The stone soup, while a cheeky idea, was medicinal. Not to mention, 3 out of the 4 waiters were just reciting the same descriptions all night.  The only thing they had down was the pace of the service. Again, it's another reminder that our culture buys into experiences that ultimately leave us feeling unsatisfied. This was just a big masquerade, no substance.  C'mon Grant - who's watching over your kitchen?! Keller said if you can taste the seasoning, then you've overdone it. Well, every other dish was salty.

2010-10-31,5.0,"If your are going to Alinea you are probably a foodie but I'll say it anyway that you are in for a multi-course evening that will take several hours and be composed of many small dishes. This restaurant is for serious restaurant-lovers and you are going to spend a lot of money there so my suggestion is to dive in to the deep end of the pool and get the wine pairing because it is worth doing at a place like this. Usually when my wife and I go to dinner we choose a cuisine (Asian, Greek, French) or focus on a food (duck, fish, steak) and then select an old favorite restaurant or choose a new place that we have heard of. Alinea chooses to look at food and restaurants differently. Their kitchen does not have traditional stations, there is no line, the food tickets are held in the front and called out by a maestro like figure who orchestrates a team of over 24 cooks. The restaurant like Charlie Trotters, Les Nomades and other boutique restaurants is located a converted brownstone just north of the Steppenwolf Theater on Halsted and is modern with glass staircases, original modern art and has a minimalist but warm feel. Alinea is truly different however in its approach to the food. The menu you will be served is fixed, so aside from any food allergies you won't be choosing anything and the focus of each plate served to you is not a cuisine or a product but a flavor. You then add to the flavor by mixing the main item with side items & sauces which change that base flavor and make your plate different from anyone else who had it before. For example the Ice Fish course had segments of the fish placed along a line of vegetables and sauces including horseradish and other complementary flavors that you mix together in different combinations which creates more unique flavors. In some dishes instead of you changing he flavors they change them around for you by having ingredients mix together like the Apple Cider ""shot"" which came in a glass where the cider was trapped inside a nickel sized ball made of cinnamon flavored skin and was floating in walnut milk.  You tipped the shot back and the ball burst in your mouth mixing the cider and walnut milk with the cinnamon. All the dishes were this way often forcing opposites together like sweet and salty, milky and crunchy etc. Overall I give Alinea five stars because it is truly unique and recognized world wide for what it is. However I would say these types of preparations are a bit of a schtick that for some people may get old by the 16th or 20th course. Having said that, this is truly a professional kitchen doing things you can't do at home which is why people should go out. This group of young people are definitely serious and will go on to do great things themselves.  Summary: Each plate was an artist's palette that needs you to complete it but if you go there you have to approach it not as going out for a type of food or a single item but that you are going out to experience what a talented group of chefs can do with flavors.",0.9944,0.879,0.103,0.018,0.42126131444313253

The server to table ratio is 1.5 :1 which is awesome. They seem to know when to talk and when to shut up, when to bring a meal out and when to wait a little longer. They were very polite and patient in explaining each course and wine flavor complementing it, the emotions it was supposed to invoke, etc. as I was not familiar with the culinary lingo.  I would definately recommend the larger course and the wine pairing with. Their menus change constantly and its never the same two dishes. I wont go too much in detail with the dishes but experiencing it was worth the price to eat there. The wine pairing is a near perfect compliment to the dishes also.  The whole experience, 20 some courses, lasted a good 5 hours and I was comfortably full in between. Overall, i recommend going there at least once if you live in chicago.

With that being said, it still was a wonderful meal - the service is unbeatable.  They do their very best to make you understand what you are eating and drinking - and the servers are not stuffy at all which was unexpected.  They space out the reservations, so the people next to you are never at the same course which keeps things from feeling like a factory.  There is absolutely no music or noise to block out other conversations or the server speaking to other tables, so that was the one bad thing about the overall mood and element of surprise. Overall, there were some really good courses and some not so good courses.  I was very displeased starting the whole experience with 3 small shots of alcohol because I specifically didn't eat much that day in preparation for our big meal, and drinking on an empty stomach almost made me throw up!  I have no idea why they wouldn't have the alcohol a few courses in... Everything was prepared beautifully and was made with purpose, but I was not blown away by a single course - which I expected that I would.   When my husband and I left, we both thought the experience was cool, however I don't know if it was worth the money.  After the food and wine pairing, I could have paid for 4 or 5 meals at a restaurant that I have given 5's (Roy's or Sunda..). I would not go again, nor would I urge any friends to go either.  If you do go, however, definitely do the wine pairing.  They tell you it is about 1/3 the cost of dinner (NOT TRUE) but they really do pair nicely with the meal.",0.9748,0.833,0.12,0.047,0.432052767052767

None of the food disappointed at all. I did deduct a star and would like to explain why... My father treated me to an evening at Alinea and we splurged and had the RESERVE wine pairings as well which is the same price as the tasting.  Basically, dinner was $900 for two people.  The pairings were mediocre, the food is so complex that I understand the difficulty in pairing...the issue I had was my favorite wine came near the end and it was a Spanish red. After desert, I wanted another glass.   (let me back track, at the beginning our server/sommelier stated that with the pairings they will pour as your drink....)  Anyways, I asked our server for another glass of the Spanish that I liked.  He brought me a very small pour. At the end of the evening, the bill came and they charged us $12 for the pour.  I asked about it and the server stated that because it was a reserve wine they charge for extra OUNCES!!!! At $450 a person I would think that an extra pour wouldn't cost $12.  It is the principle of the issue and not the actual cost.

In a way, this review serves as a souvenir I can always find, so that I don't forget just how amazing it was to eat at this Temple of Edibles.  So, Dalyte, in case you ever forget:  You were served a dessert featuring caramelized white chocolate that looked like branches from a bonsai tree. And it was sitting on top of a PILLOW. A pillow that was filled with earl grey-scented air. Despite your better judgment, you wanted to eat the pillow, it smelled that good.  You were served an assortment of dishes that featured crab in forms that you never considered, namely an icy crab sorbet. And it was delicious.  Your dishes were paired with wines from all corners of the globe, and their exceptional deliciousness transformed you into a pretentious and dissatisfied oenophile for a good month.  Once the meal was over, you went downstairs and stared through the glass windows that looked out on the kitchen, observing Grant Achatz and his team of chefs work their magic. You felt like a kid at the north pole, watching Santa and his elves. You stayed there, observing, for maybe half an hour or so, as other guests followed your lead and joined the show, your eyes glazing over with delight and bitter-sweetness, since that epic meal was now over, and your wallet was significantly lighter.

This is a dining experience...a whimsical adventure using the best of your senses for food. Smell, Sight, Taste. The haute cuisine is like no other in America. They have been heralded the closest successor we may see of ""El Bulli"" recently, speaking to the immense impact they have had on the culinary world.  The beauty of Alinea is the focus on one ingredient in each dish and bringing it to life. Surprisingly it is usually NOT the ingredient you would suspect, making it so much more interesting. Example: dishes based off Hay, Chestnut and Rhubarb to name a few. Don't worry, Duck, Waygu, Truffle and many others are there as well but those are luxuries you would expect!  Course after course you are drawn into the dish with strong scents while you are instructed to close your eyes....or Sight, while you marvel at the presentation of a dish. It's something you should never miss.  The service is unlike any I have ever seen, your ""team"" of wait staff help bring the dishes, share insight on the construction of the dish, explain the wine pairings and quickly get you set for the next course.  Warning - This is an expensive meal and is not meant to fill you. This is about the passion of food being on display like the art it truly can be when a chef isn't afraid to break out of the mold and turn it into something exquisite.

We opted for the wine pairings with the meal and I was happy we did, this is a once in a lifetime experience-why not go all out.  The regular wine pairing is 3/4 the price of the menu but they also offer a vintage reserve pairing that is the full price of the menu-we went with the reserve pairing and it was great.  I'm sure the regular pairing would be just as good, but we couldn't help but just go all out. The courses are each superb in their own right but the pork belly spring roll, black truffle explosion, hot potato/cold potato, lamb from elysian fields farm, and wagyu beef (Tournedo) were my favorites.  One of the extra cool courses was the pheasant that was skewered on the end of burning oak leaves-the smell of burning leaves just carried us right into the fall season. The unassuming facade, exquisite plate preparation with painstaking detail, and layer after layer of flavor that consumes your taste buds really just blew us away.  There were waitstaff everywhere, refilling our wine glasses and immediately whisking away our empty glasses and plates to prepare for the next course.  The sommelier was very informative and they were able to print the names of the wines we had on the menu we took home.

You walk in down a purple-lit hallway which opens up dining room that feels like a scene out of Willy Wanka.  When we first sat down they placed what they would only cryptically reveal to us were ""functional place settings"" on the table.  My dinner companion described it as a ""food circus.""  I would say it was more than just a meal; it is performance art.   I think the video here is very helpful in understanding how they picture Alinea to be very much about the experience:  youtube.com/watch?v=yhB_… The dishes are mostly things you have never experienced before.  It's hard to put them into any particular bucket, but there are definitely some strong asian influences at play.  Unfortunately somewhere in the 16 courses and experimentation of flavors means you lose the ability settle into a comfortable place and just enjoy eating good food.  There was very little savory content to the experience, and halfway through the meal we were talking about how exciting the hot dog we would get after dinner was going to be.   The one area where the video leads you astray is when it says the restaurant is not pretentious or self-important.  You need to wear a jacket to not feel out of place.  The people dining around us were all on the older and more serious side of a good time.  Each course is delivered to your table and explained by a waiter who is cooler and edgier than you will ever be.  The courses are served in custom made place-ware that looks like someones twisted version of the future.  That is with the exception of the course that was served on place-ware from the 19th century.   I could go own, but I've already said too much.  I don't want to give away all of the secrets of the place, and especially not the ending. So my rating... I would give Alinea 5 stars for the show, 4 stars for the food (interesting but not quite satisfying), and 3 stars for the pretentiousness.  That averages out to 4 stars, but really, you should be going for the show, so its probably worth checking out.",0.9895,0.858,0.115,0.027,0.5538271604938271

2010-09-22,1.0,"I am sorry, i know one star is harsh, but this is the second most expensive restaurant that I have ever been to (behind per se) and therefore, it needs to be judged in that context.  The food is sublime, there is no question about that. The tastes are very interesting and unique so the 20 courses leave you completely satisfied. Here is why I have give Alinea low marks: 1. Atmosphere. The tables are very close together and there is no ambient noise. the waiters all speak in hush tones and you can pick up conversations from across the room. I was a bit annoyed that I couldn't have a candid conversation with my wife while enjoying dinner. Furthermore, since the meal is broken into 20 micro courses, there is someone at your table nearly every 5 minutes delivering a monolog about the food. If you go to Alinea, prepare more for Theatre than for dinner. It isn't about the company. 2. It gets old...fast: So much about this restaurant is about the presentation and the uniqueness of the food. Each course is delivered by a chef or waiter that is responsible for just that portion of the meal. He gives a presentation about the food and describes how it was intended that you eat it. Here is the problem, it sort of takes away from the night when you hear this same speech 4 or 5 different times during the night as it is given to the adjacent tables. Since it is given by the same person, and exactly the same way, it starts feeling a bit like you are watching robots at work in a perverse culinary chorus. 3. Presentation felt Kitchy: the food is amazing, but some of the dishes require you to obey instructions about how to eat it and how to hold it...ok, not terminal, but it also got a bit old. 4. Timeshare sale: The wine pairing was very good BUT BUT BUT I really HATED the fact that about halfway through the pairing the Sommelier comes over and asks you if you are interested in upgrading to a ""reserve set"" of wines for the balance of the dinner. My reaction may have been unfounded, but I was insulted. To me, this stunk of a ""timeshare sales pitch"" after you have agreed to rent the room for the weekend. The timing just feels horrendous and it begs you to wonder if they don't put it at this point in the dinner to capitalize on the fact that you have already consumed a good deal of wine and that perhaps your judgment is at risk. If you compound this with the fact THAT EVERYONE NEAR YOU IS LISTENING TO YOUR ANSWER, this solicitation is just outright obnoxious. 5. The Sommelier was a moron: An halfway decent Sommelier at a normal fine-dining establishment would have realized that I am a rank amateur when it comes to wine and catered his speech to the unfortunate audience that he is stuck with. At Alinea, even the  Sommelier says EXACTLY THE SAME SPEECH TO EACH TABLE WITH EACH GLASS OF WINE. He kept on asking me if I was familiar with certain exotic grapes, because that grape was somewhat similar to the grape I was about to enjoy. Dude, this was irritating. 6. Oh yeah, the menthol. It really was unfortunate. I had read about it in the reviews and I considered asking them to leave it out... but once you are in your seat you realize that you would no more ask them to change a dish than you might ask an actor in a Broadway play to change his pronunciation.",-0.9735,0.805,0.079,0.115,0.5452672497570455

Alinea lives and breathes every single quality that I just mentioned. It pretty much changes the way I see fine dining and food in general. Like many people, I came to Alinea with suspicion. Critics raved about his cuisine but can regular foodies like us relate to it? What makes it worth that hefty price? [Insert more questions here...] I was sick of asking and when I found out that my foodie friends were coming to visit me, I immediately made a reservation, noting to the friendly staff that one of us is a vegetarian and some other minor requests. We eventually scored a table on a Saturday night at 6pm. We were promptly greeted with my own name (how do they know it's me?) and seated. We got a sense that the atmosphere was a little stiff at first but as the night progresses and they get to know us better, we started joking and having a little fun while remaining professional at the same time. I won't go to too much detail as I want you to experience it yourself but all I can say is, the staff paid so much attention to little details to ensure that we have an amazing dining experience. We were even joking that they would have a pair of Alinea branded slippers if we ever requested for one. =) Foodwise, we were there before they consolidated two menus into one. So, we had the privilege of having the 28-course dinner. The first course came and it was English peas. Not sure about you but I recalled the horrid of eating boiled peas as a child. I took a first bite and it was bursting with flavors. The dish plays not just with your taste buds but also the texture. I've never thought peas could be prepared like this!  Course after course, chef Grant and his team turned simple and exotic ingredients into masterpieces that defies expectations in many ways. I actually lost count of the course number but I could care less. I just wanted the courses to keep coming. =) In an interview, I remembered Grant Achatz said that a dinner at Alinea is like a great theatre performance. I never understood it until that night. The highlight of the night was none other than the last chocolate course, prepared tableside for your viewing pleasure. Trust me, you don't want to miss that. =) We finally left after 6 hours at midnight. Not that I am complaining but honestly, that is the one of the best six hours in my life. I did not want to leave. It made such an impact that everything else after that night tasted bland, even at another top fine dining restaurant that we went the evening after. Instead of talking about the dinner, we were reminiscing and kept comparing it to Alinea. Go figure. We came back that night with a sigh of accomplishment and disbelieve.

2010-09-19,5.0,"One day my boyfriend came up to me and said that he want to go eat at Alinea when his friends visited in Chicago.  I had never heard of Alinea nor Chef Grant at that time, so  I was not that excited about going to a high priced restaurant like Alinea to eat plates with a bite or two of food.  At the same time, I was very excited to dress up and eating at the number one restaurant in North America with the man that I love. Before Alinea, I rated most places a 4 or 5, but Alinea changed my mind on what it means to be a 5 star restaurant. Alinea was the most amazing dining experience.  The amazing experience began the moment we walked up to the restaurant.  We were greeted by name and was seated at a large black table with plenty of leg and arm room.  We had two servers to wait on us.  The restaurant is divided into sections with around six tables in each section.  It appeared like each section had two main servers.  In other words, you will be well taken care of. They will provide you will just about anything you may need, including aspirin. They pulled the chair out everytime we went to the bathroom and was ready to seat us as we walked to the table from the bathroom. I tried one time to get up without their help. I think it is impossible.    The food was the most amazing food I had ever put into my mouth.  We got the 28-course dinner that took us around 6 hours to eat.  Oh my goodness, that was mind blowing.  I don't want to tell you all the courses, because that may destroy the experience that you could have on your visit.  I will tell you that Alinea does not serve a specific kind of food.  I was asked by friends and family, ""What kind of food does Alinea serve?""  Well, Alinea isn't American, French, Indian, Mexican or any other nationality of food.  It is just Alinean food.  Every dish uses texture, smell, taste and sight to explode your mind with pleasure. The dessert was even more special. Chef Grant and an assistant personal made the dessert right there at our table.  I may not be the biggest foodie out there, but I became a real food critic after experiencing the best food in Chicago and maybe in the world.  Go to Alinea and have your best food experience.

We're at 1723 Halsted, right?), the unique waiting/serving staff, the most bad-a55 artful food presentations, to the actual taste of the food- was beyond compare. We were led upstairs to our table by a server who wasn't African-American, but had hair huger than Chaka Khan's biggest fro. Then another server helped us w/our chairs, and he had a lip ring. Already I felt at ease....shoot, this place wasn't pretentious as I'd thought it might be, if they ain't trippin about homeboy's hair and dude's lip ring. We had some funny and cool servers too, one telling us how to eat certain dishes cuz we just gotta be down like that (hands behind our back) and another explaining a dish's anatomy and taste in layman's terms after realizing he could drop the fancy talk w/us. When asked what kind of water we wanted to drink, our server said ""We have bottled, mineral, sparkling, and good ol' Chicago Tap"". Hahaha. 4 hours later, hopping into a Taxi headed back to our hotel I was grateful for what I had just experienced. I'm not financially well off by any means, but am willing to spend a pretty penny on experience. The cost of designer handbags and red soled heels has got nothing on the value of a memorable occasion. Take the plastic off your couch. Use your fine China. Stop saving your PTO and use it.

2010-09-16,5.0,"My first meal at Alinea was the most amazing meal I've had in my life (and I don't exaggerate).  I did the tasting menu two years ago, the massive tour menu last year, and last month with the single 20-course option they have on the menu.  I was not quite as impressed with my last dining experience as the first two - I got the impression that the restaurant is now focusing more on efficiency, and trying to increase its throughput of customers per night to generate more revenue (just my opinion).  Regardless, the food is still awesome, as well as the service and presentation.  It is definitely a must-do if you have the disposable income and the time, and I look forward to coming back again in the future!",0.9477,0.833,0.147,0.02,0.4441220238095238

2010-09-09,5.0,"Alinea has recently been hailed as the Best Restaurant in the U.S. (and #7 in the World). With such status, I had extremely high expectations and quite honestly, was a bit worried that I'd expect too much and be let down. Instead, I was *COMPLETELY* blown away by my experience at Alinea and would have to whole heartedly agree that it's the best restaurant I've been to in the U.S. (sorry, French Laundry). What's even more remarkable is that Alinea has only been around for 5 years, during part of which Chef Grant Achatz had battled tongue cancer. Words can not adequately describe the phenomenal meal I had at Alinea. It is a true experience in all forms - the surprise of hidden sliding doors, interacting with the unique presentations of each dish, anticipating what the next extraordinary course would bring, and most importantly, having my taste buds delighted and pushed to the limit with innovative, incredible food. You really do just have to experience it for yourself. The food at Alinea is progressive, ambitious, artistic, and totally original. It was creative without being gimmicky. Chef Achatz and his team take modern American cuisine to a whole new level with their inventive genius. The service was impeccable. Every need was anticipated before we had to ask for anything. The staff was professional, courteous, and very knowledgeable.  I learned so much about the food and wine. [BTW, I highly recommend the reserve wine pairing. The wine beautifully complemented the food - an impressive feat with ~20 courses!] The only thing I didn't love about my experience at Alinea was the ambience. The dining room (there are 3) is a small, rectangular room with modern, minimalist décor in cool grey, beige, and black tones. It felt impersonal and lacked warmth. It's a good thing that the food was so mesmerizing; else it'd be awkward to be in such a sparse room where you are so acutely aware of your neighbors. But maybe that was intentional, and they want you to just focus on the food. A few of my favorite courses... ENGLISH PEA - unlike anything I've ever eaten before! Peas were mixed with frozen burrata cheese and dusted with Iberico ham powder. It was ice cold yet creamy, salty, sweet, and meaty all at once. The sherry ""bubbles"" and melon would also transform each bite by accentuating different flavors.  TOMATOES - this dish transported me to another place. I was initially confused and intrigued when they put pillows on top of the table. Then I started to smell the fresh, grassy aroma emitted by the pillows. Once the plate of heirloom tomatoes was set on the pillows, more of the aroma was emitted as the pillows deflated...it was like eating ripe tomatoes straight from the garden! If summer had a taste, this would be it.  PORK BELLY- this pork belly was ABSOLUTELY ORGASMIC! It had been slowly simmered in coconut milk and just melted in my mouth. I wanted more!  HOT POTATO - great things really do come in small packages. A metal pick slides down to drop a piece of butter, hot potato, and black truffle into the tiny wax bowl filled with cold potato soup. Let me say that again...Truffles. Potatoes. Butter. Totally my kind of comfort food! This was so delicious, it took all my restraint to keep myself from licking the bowl clean.  EARL GREY - I was ready to dislike this dessert because I detest early grey tea, but this was surprisingly my favorite dessert of the evening. It was a moist and crumbly early grey cake served with pine nut custard, lemon curd, and rose gelée. The flavors were so well balanced - buttery, sweet, tart, and with just a hint of bitterness from the earl grey. The caramelized white chocolate noodle also added a playful yet tasty touch.  CHOCOLATE - The ultimate demonstration of fantasy and wonder at Alinea.  You will have to see this for yourself...a tableside presentation like no other!  After our 4 hour meal, I felt inspired and completely enchanted. Alinea made me fall in love with food all over again.  I've had many great meals, but few have left me feeling so awestruck. The $185 tasting menu is pricey, but still a ""bargain"" considering the number of elaborate and well-executed courses...a small price to pay for one of the best meals of my life. **For a full review and pics of each course, go to my blog link under my profile**",0.9974,0.816,0.15,0.034,0.5492720785840052
2010-09-02,5.0,"My husband and I had the pleasure -- no HONOR -- of dining at Alinea. I hesitate to write too much in detail because every single aspect of the experience is so carefully thought through, and full of wonder and delight, that to reveal so much as the shape of the entrance would diminish the unmitigated joy in discovering each moment for yourself.  Suffice it to say that we (as unrepentant foodies) have dined at the finest restaurants in the United States (we're from the Bay area and New York -- so we really mean that), and as I said to my husband midway through the meal, Alinea kicks the French Laundry's arse (among other establishments).   I have never been a huge fan of molecular gastronomy, since I have found that taste often seems sacrificed in favor of novelty or presentation (such as I found to be often the case at WD-50, which I know many people love).  But Alinea compromises nothing.  The presentation is dazzling, right down to the flatware.  The taste is outer-worldy.  The combinations are unimaginable and yet exhilarating.  The service was impeccable.  It is, in short, extraordinary.  My only regret is that I'm fairly certain that Grant Achatz himself came out to do our final presentation, and I was so tongue-tied and startled, and he seemed so focused and serious, that to say anything directly felt like tapping Yo Yo Ma on the shoulder mid-concerto and saying ""Are you Yo-Yo Ma?"" so I just made some dumb remark and then stared at the table.  Alas.  Such does a mortal tremble in the presence of a (food) god.",0.9586,0.797,0.129,0.074,0.5791044683286063
2010-08-30,5.0,"Most of what needs to be said has been said in reviews here. Acknowledged today as the best restaurant in the US, Alinea lived up to it's billing last night. Dinner, running three hours, was paced beautifully. The service...spread across at least a half dozen servers...was note perfect. The food ran from good/fun to amazing to transcendent. (For a listing of the menu visit  alinea-restaurant.com/pa… ). Grant Achatz, the chef, actually was not only in the restaurant cooking but came out to prepare the dessert table. How rare is that for superstar chefs nowadays? Just a brief story on this. Our table was cleared and a silicone table cloth was brought in to cover the table. That was the ""plate"" for the dessert. A chocolate mousse, frozen in liquid nitrogen, was smashed on the table and surrounded with various flavors...coconut, menthol, hyssop. We chatted with Grant about his inspirations for such a creative menu. Very nice, thoughtful guy. Ambience was welcoming, service great, food amazing. Dinner wasn't cheap but was worth every penny.

2010-08-30,5.0,"I had the extreme, and I mean EXTREME, pleasure of dining at Alinea a couple of weeks ago and, ever since, I have been racking my brain trying to think of how I can accurately describe such a profound experience with mere words.  And... I can't! I don't know where to begin. I don't know how to review it in a way that could even capture the essence of what it's like to dine at Alinea. Ahhh joie de vivre, the tribulations of life really are worth it when you get to enjoy the wonderful places, people and adventures afforded by simply living...uhhh and eating at luxury, world-renowned restaurants doesn't hurt either. If L.A.'s Urasawa is the Space Mountain of restaurants then Alinea is the first class ticket to fucking Mars. Everything from the entrance to the initial greeting by the manager to the dining room to every single motherfucking course to the wine pairing (OH THE WINE PAIRING) to the wait staff to the sommelier, everything was executed with the finest attention to every detail. I loved it. I more than loved it. I wanted to bare its evil, epicurean spawn. I wanted it to slap me in the face and never call me again.  The tasting menu was incredible. I mean, it's giving me the vapors just thinking about it. I won't give anything away, but I did dub one dish the ""Black Truffle Bukkake"". YES! Just know that the entire tasting was fucking amazing. They also have pared their menus down to just one, no more having to choose between tasting or touring. We opted for the wine pairing with our meal, which was a genius move on our part. Actually, it might not have been genius, as I don't quite remember everything involved in the dessert courses. Oops. The pleasure of being in the hands of such brilliance was overwhelming at times. Grant Achatz and his team are true culinary wizards. We're not worthy! We're not worthy! These are all people who love what they do and they do it expertly...food, cooking and glorious glorious alcohol. Our sommelier was beyond extraordinary. He had an anecdote for every bottle of wine and delivered it with unwavering knowledge and intoxicating (get it?!) charm.  If I could just make my home in Alinea and be lulled to sleep every night by the sommelier while partaking in delicious fare and impressive libations, that would be...*HEAD EXPLODES*",0.997,0.787,0.182,0.031,0.6207773707773708
2010-08-30,5.0,"This is a continuation of my review of Alinea... 18. Squab in different preparations - sous vide & rillettes, served with strawberry dramatically on a birch log. Tender, packed with flavour, moist, highlight of the mains though course 21 did run it close 19. Black truffle explosion. A Grant Achatz signature dish where the ravioli served holds a flavour bomb of truffle emulsion and is served with romaine and parmesan . If anything is going to explode in your mouth, make sure it tastes as good as this does 20. Palate cleanser of hibiscus tonic 21. Escoffier's beef. Wagyu beef cooked sous vide, then seared. Isn't your mouth already watering just by reading those words? Well, it ate as well as it sounded 22. Lemon soda powder to be consumed in one bite. Conjures childhood memories 23. Raspberry transparency served with yoghurt. How do they make these films so fine and yet packed with flavour? 24. Bubble gum. A long clear cigar sized tube holding hibiscus & creme fraiche tapioca pearls. Fun dish as you had to suck out the contents from the tube 25. Lemon & pine but with caramelised white chocolate served on a plate placed on a pillow filled with Earl grey tea smoke. The plate gradually deflates the balloon as you eat and the scent enhances the food After course 25, the servers cleared my table. But wait, the eagle-eyed among you may have noticed that I hadn't had my 26th course. Well, this is where the magic really happened. Big spoiler ahead for those of you intending to eat the Tour menu, so if you prefer surprises, please skip to the last paragraph! Well, the servers relaid my table with a waterproof cloth and arranged different ramekins on the tabletop. If you've read my previous reviews, you'll know that I like my kitchen tours if I eat at a fine dining restaurant and chef is in service. I was starting to wonder if I should request my kitchen visit, looked down at my mobile phone and looked back up to see Grant Achatz standing at my table!!!!!!! I think my jaw hit the floor. Then, he said that he was going to create my last dessert course himself on my table. In what seemed no time at all, he used different forms of chocolate, coconut, menthol and hyssop to draw on the tabletop - precise drops of gradually decreasing size, smears, streaks, all of which were edible He then told me to come down to the kitchen after my meal where I could take pictures. To this day, I'm still amazed that Grant Achatz cooked at my table. That will stay with me to the end of my dining days Chef Achatz took time to show me round the kitchen and I had my picture taken with him. He is truly a friendly and humble guy Alinea truly is the pinnacle of my dining experiences. The food is innovative & playful but still packs a flavour punch.

2010-08-29,5.0,"Yes, it is absolutely worth it. Dining at Alinea is not so much a meal, as it is a completely captivating experience in which the act of eating is unequivocally transformed. There are moments of disbelief interspersed with instances of revelation, leaving you with a jumble of incredulous memories composed of a myriad of fantastic sights, smells, and tastes. The two tasting menu options have now been replaced with a single 21 dish tasting for $185, keeping in mind that some of these 21 ""dishes"" are a small plate that may arrive with 2 or 3 others to be served together as a single course, for a total of 16 courses.  The wine pairings are offered inconspicuously for a mere additional ""three quarters"" of the price of the tasting. The flavours are amazing.  Delicate spheres of sherry explode with each mouthful, its sweetness cutting into the richness of the freeze-dried pea puree, interspersed with the savoury highlights of powdered Iberico ham.  The intensity of the tomato dish blew my mind - it is hard to believe that each tomato was simply blanched and dressed with only olive oil, salt and pepper, and still able to produce a natural depth of flavour that I often associate with hours of braising or meticulous reduction. The play and exposition of flavour profiles also produced spectacular results.  King crab and plum became the basis of a three-dish course, each revealed in turn after the completion of the former.  The essential components remained evident and undisturbed, but the course flowed smoothly from a cold king crab and buttermilk parfait with chervil juice;  to a crisp salad of king crab with fennel, plum, and bean sprouts; and then finishing off with a lush, piping gratin of king crab, punctuated perfectly with a delightful star anise encapsulation. And if you have any predilection for truffles, you will not be disappointed.  The classic hot potato dish still remains topped with the largest slice of black truffle I will probably ever eat in one mouthful, and the black truffle ""explosion"" will literally stop you in your tracks.  Heed the waiter's warning to eat the delicate ravioli in one go, as there is no room for regret if you spill even one drop of the most intense, jaw dropping truffle broth that literally explodes in your mouth and simply overwhelms all your senses with pure deliciousness. Playful themes that engage and delight will continue to meet you at every turn throughout the night.  Deconstructions and re-interpretations of classic cocktails start off the meal.  South-east Asian flavours will meet you in their presentations of pork belly wraps and shrimp.  A shout out to Escoffier makes an entrance, accompanied with period-appropriate placings and cutlery, and a splash of red wine to complete the picture.   Nothing happens by accident, as every moment is conceived and carried out to a tee.  Granted, this does require the omnipresent hovering of wait staff which does make you feel watched at every moment (which you are), but it does serve the purpose of making sure that you have the most perfectly executed meal you could hope for.  Service is so catered to making sure you are happy that we were given complimentary cocktails simply because the bottle of white we ordered was not immediately available and had to be chilled (we promptly received our bottle only about 2 courses after we received our cocktails!).  I am tempted to go on and on, but the degree of detail, thoughtfulness, and creativity (and of course, deliciousness!) is simply something you have to try for yourself.  A meal at Alinea is absolutely worth it, and will be unlike anything else you will have ever experienced.

2010-08-29,5.0,"We went to celebrate our 21st anniversary.  A special place for a special occasion! Arriving at the non-descript entrance, you know you are in for a great meal when the door opens and you walk down a narrow angular corridor lit with soft red light that seems to come from somewhere far off in the distance.  You turn into the restaurant and walk into a high ceilinged foyer with a view of the kitchen.  It's a dramatic compression and release.  The kitchen is a bustle of activity - perhaps 20 chefs and cooks working.  We are escorted to the front room where there about 7 tables.  The rest of the restaurant is not visible from here, but I heard there are about 20 tables. We are asked a few questions before the meal starts.  These concern any food intolerances and our alcohol preferences.  There are two different wine pairings - the standard and the reserve.  The standard is 3/4 the price of the food and the reserve is the same price as the food.  I decided to have the standard pairing.  My wife decided to have a glass of Pinot Gris from Alsace.  We told them we will eat anything. We were served 20+ courses.  To describe each one would be too much.  But there were some definite highlights.  The ""hot potato, cold potato"" is a whimsical little treat - a cold truffled potato soup over which is floating hot globes of butter poached Yukon gold potatoes and shaved black truffle skewered with an accupuncture needle.  You pull the needle out and the potatoes drop into the cold soup and then you pour the whole thing into your mouth like a shot.  Wow!  What a contrast of hot and cold, smooth and chunky, and the flavor lasts in your mouth seemingly forever.  The ""truffle explosion"" is a delicate raviolo filled with black truffle essence ... a xiao long bao on steroids!  Each course challenged you with it's inventiveness, complexness, playfulness, interactiveness, artfulness, hauteness.  Every dish is plated in a unique way, with some of the plates custom made by an engineer specfically for the dish at hand.  Our final dessert was memorable.  Our table is covered by a clean vinyl tablecloth and the dessert is assembled by a pastry chef directly on the table.  Dollops and balls of this and that, a miraculously congealing chocolate sauce, and then a liquid nitrogen frozen block of chocolate mousse that is fractured into small smoky pieces - it's like eating a personalized Jackson Pollock painting. The wines were excellent and there were several interesting and little known varietals that were served. The service was impeccable, attentive and prompt.  This kind of food and drink requires a dedicated, coordinated and fully engaged waitstaff.  The courses came out without a glitch and without undue delay.  We finished our entire meal in about 3 hours. This was quite a memorable dinner, probably the most memorable dinner I've eaten.  There's no way of getting around the expense of this meal but if you can do it, it's worth it.",0.9939,0.862,0.117,0.021,0.5834256854256853

Too many freeze dried, liquid nigrogen items - this treatment was used on a least 5 of the dishes.   There is very little in the way of actual ""food"".   Don't get me wrong, I love tasting menus, small portions and fine dining.    I expected just little bites - so it is not at all about the ""quantity"" of food - it is about the taste and flavours.  So underwhelming.     This restaurant it all flash and illusion with very little substance.   If you have money to burn and want to go for the ridiculous experience than at least do yourself a favour and skip the wine paring.   Wines are ordinary - and it the end since there is little food you just end up feeling drunk and getting a hangover.

2010-08-24,5.0,"I planned a trip to Chicago around a visit to Alinea.  Extreme?  No.  Dining experiences are remarkably memorable, especially when the company and conversations are exceptional.  Conversations spiced with delectable and creative flavour combinations are even more memorable. The Tour menu our party selected held 26 courses.  We took the suggested wine pairing (and another bottle of Kosta Browne Pinot Noir 2005, despite a subtle disapproval from the sommelier) and set out to enjoy every tiny morsel. Except that 26 small portions turn out to a rather hefty meal.  It takes discipline to taste every flavour in turn, especially while trying equally hard to savour the flavours of the paired wines and of course their interaction on the palate.  It's hard to say whether I was successful, but it was a marvel of pairing creativity. It's intriguing to me how much asian cuisine is pulled into the repertoire of the Chef's imagination -- but clear Vietnamese, Japanese and Chinese influences are present along with more N. American culinary heritages from Italy, France, Britain and the like.  (Earl Grey was used in the dessert, so... back off!) While I can't say that I was ecstatic during every course, I can say I was ecstatic for many of them.  Not every combination worked perfectly to my tongue - but that doesn't detract from my sense of amazement at the detail and courage it takes to decide to create a tasting menu of such breadth and depth. Intimate seating, and elegant, visually soothing, non-distracting decor assures the patron that their attention will be focused on the food.  Honestly, it's so very worth paying attention. 5 out of 5.",0.9969,0.756,0.231,0.013,0.5014141414141413

2010-08-15,5.0,"Go ahead, Play with your food! That's what chef Grant Achatz and the Alinea staff invite you to do. Play. Think. Engage.  This is not just a meal, it's an experience and should be treated as such.  We brought a camera (no flash) and a small moleskin to jot down impressions. (for those who feel awkward about bringing a camera, note that by the end of the night your less intrepid fellow diners will be jealous - a woman sitting at the table next to us gave us her e-mail address and asked us to e-mail her our pictures).   The meal was superb.  Although I enjoyed nearly everything I consumed, I want to call special attention to the frozen pea puree course and the Earl Grey course.  The frozen pea puree was like getting a garden in a glass, the flavors and textures managed to be both interesting and delicious.  This is especially noteworthy because I hate peas.  Additionally, the Earl Grey dessert course was amazing.  A visual display of both vibrant and subdued color coupled with a host of different flavors and textures to try together or individually.  Again, I should mention that I hardly ever drink tea, and of the teas I have tried I really detest Earl Grey.  How amazing that a chef can deconstruct a flavor that I hate and reinvent it into something that I LOVE.  The experience has actually made me want to re-visit Earl Grey tea and try it again while thinking about all the flavors in this dish. One other must-note is the self-assembly spring roll.   I love spring rolls so this was ""no-brainer"" delight for me.  Not only do the bold colors and flavors stand out in this dish, but the ability to choose your own components (I recommend everything) and put it together yourself adds an element of whimsy and participation.  It made me realize that many of these courses are not just a one-way delivery of a meal from the kitchen.  They are more like plated conversations.  The staff is not just creating FOR  you, but you are creating something together; experimenting together. I found the service impeccable, but the constant switching of servers made it a little difficult to develop a rapport with one.  That being said,  having two members of the kitchen staff compose the last course for you (quite a visual display!) table-side was a great touch and a nice way to directly talk to someone working in that artist's studio they call a kitchen.",0.9894,0.81,0.154,0.037,0.5254144620811286

I could go on for paragraphs about how my palate has been expanded and how this was more of an educational experience and therefore a bargain. Do it. You won't regret it. Buy the cookbook.

The leering from the corner  (was anyone Secret Service previously?) adds humidity to the air and is unneccesary.  A fun experiment would be to make the service like the menu - somewhat modifiable.

2010-07-23,4.0,"I feel as unqualified to write a review on Alinea as I did dining there. I am no chef, critic, or connoisseur and can only make the ranks of being a ""foodie"" in the most amateur sense of the word. My roadtrip to Chicago was just me tagging along with a friend and this privilege extended to a Dining Experience at this Formal Jacket Required establishment.  And, yes, oh yes, was it an experience. From the get go, Alinea stands out in my memory because of its exceptionally unexceptional outward appearance. A slate colored, nearly-residential front with no name and dimly lit windows you cannot peer through. Going through the front door places you in a red-glowing, seemingly dead-end hallway. A timid venture inside surprises you with an automatic stainless steel door that zips aside for you to enter this new world.  Everything here - the decor, place setting, service, taste, presentation - is immaculately precise and a fabrication worthy of reverie.  FOOD // It's just beautiful. The menu is set, though I do believe there are 2 different options varying in number of courses. Passage of time and culinary ineptitude prevent me from reviewing the food itself. On a tastebud level, it was an enjoyable meal. There were a couple courses I did not care for and left unfinished, despite each course only being one or two bites (or slurp in the case of the tapioca pudding tube). The array of tastes and textures is vast and it doesn't stop there; courses intermingle with scent from a mysterious misty vase or an air pillow that releases aroma as the weight of your plate slowly deflates it. What entranced me the most was the architecture of each course. It is never simply food on a plate. Perfect cube of steak with micropackets of seasoning, strip of mapled bacon hanging from a wire, fragments suspended on pinheads, a landscape of roe. The dessert was an action painting of cream, gelée, freeze-dried ganache, nuts, and syrup akin to Pollock with the duo team of chef-artists explaining along the way. Just amazing. I think Alinea should've made that the showstopping finale, but there were two additional, less exemplary sweet dishes. More bang for your buck? SERVICE // The level of service is equal to the size of the hole in your wallet dining here leaves. Table and chair pulled out for you every time, appropriate utensils switched and placed in specific orientation for every course, waiters that not only notice your actions but read your emotions. There was one snootier waiter who seemed disappointed in me (not the restaurant) when I did not finish a course. Another reviewer stated that the waiters will mirror your own attitude, but I was intimidated and overwhelmed more than anything else. I don't front, baby! Everyone else was great though. Special mention for the sommelier. I only drink to get drunk and my date does not imbibe at all, but I'm so glad our hosts did opt for the wine pairing. There were about 6 or 7 wines and each one came with an anecdote of origin and character the whole table could share. I wish every one of my meals could be served with a story. And the sommelier was a red-head with a certified afro. Love it.  An experience I will remember forever, I recommend it for anyone in town who can afford it.

2010-07-21,5.0,"Wow.  Just....wow!  This place is AMAZING. I'm not really sure there is anything I can say that other yelpers haven't already said, but here goes.  My husband, some friends and I went to Alinea about a month ago.  First, the building, the decor, the ambiance, are all beautiful.  Very modern, but not so much as to take away from the food.  Which are the stars of the show.  Service was impeccable.  Everyone was very nice and amiable, when I really expected stuffy and snooty (because this is the type of place you could get away with it).  The wine list was explained in detail, and our table decided to order a couple bottles instead of the wine pairing.  Typically, a wine pairing is way too much wine for me and the glasses get stacked up because I am not drinking fast enough.  On to the food. My husband and I ate whatever was coming out, while our friends had some dietary restrictions, which where well accomadated.  So I can't really speak to everything that was served to them, as one does not eat meat but eats fish, while the other one doesn't eat fish or cheese.  But they were both very happy with everything that was served to them. I did not memorize the menu, Alinea gives you a menu to take home with you so you can remember everything you ate.  Thankfully  :)  We all had the tasting menu (which was more than enough foof for us, but when I saw other dishes being served to other tables that were on the full menu I was a little jealous :). 1.  English Pea - fantastic way to start the meal.  Very fresh tasting even though it was like dippin dots of peas.  Yummy.  Little encapsulated sherry droplets were very interesting addition.  There were a lot of ""encapsulated this"" or ""jelly that"" throughout the meal. 2.  Lobster.  Delicious!  My friend and I were trying to figure out how we could make these at home so we could watch the World Cup games and pop these little morsels of goodness into our mouths.  Super gourmet bar food is what it reminded us of. 3.  Distillation of Thai Flavors - Least favorite (there has to be one).  Just weird.  They said is was a plate cleanser for the next dish, but I really don't think it added anything to the meal. 4.  Pork Belly - Most favorite!!  So so so yummy.  I am not going to spoil the surprise for you, but trust that you will be pleasantly surprised.  i was raving so much about it I think my only-fish-eating friend considered trying it  :) 5.  Sturgeon - Very good.  I haven't had a lot of sturgeon before this and I'm afraid to get it after this because I don't think it could ever be as good as this one was.  Super fresh.   6.  King Crab - Served three ways.  Some better than others.  Texture was weird on one of them (like a pudding almost) which threw it off, but overall very good.   7.  Lamb - Awesome!  The sauce was to die for and lamb was perfectly cooked.  Another one that I could have eaten an entire plate of. 8.  Hot potato/Cold potato - I'm really not sre what all the fuss is about on this one.  It was just...ok.  I didn't get it i guess.  All I really tasted was truffles (which are great, don't get me wrong, but this isn't hot truffle/cold truffle).   9.  Tournedo - Wagyu beef.  Outstanding.  Second-tied-for first-favorite dish.  It felt like it was melting in my mouth.  It's dishes like this that I REALLY don't understand how people are vegetarian.  THIS is why people eat red meat.   10.  Earl grey - Loved the different textures and the combination of lemon and chocolate.  Very lemmony, but I like that sort of thing.  If you don't (like my husband) this will not be your favorite. 11.  Chocolate - Cocunut, menthol, hyssop.  Definite menthol flavor, which was strange and tasty all at the same time.   12.  Bubble gum.  -  So weird.  While a very cool way to the end the meal,  I wish it hadn't been the last flavor/texture in my mouth.   So, is Anthony Bourdain on to something when he talks about the tedious-ness of eating these tasting menus.  Maybe.  It does take a long time.  It could be difficult to sit there and carry on a conversation with someone always coming over to explain what your eating - but our friends and I managed to do it, we had an amazing time.  Also, I realize that Achatz is a food pioneer, in the vein of molecular gastronomy, but enough with the encapsulated things and gels!  There were too many.  Maybe I wasn't doing it right.  Good, but there were so many that i started to think that it was just too much, bordering on gimmicky.  But I would never say it was bad.  Or even close.    Overall, you have to go to this place.  Yes it is expensive.  But I didn't cringe when I got the bill.  Because if ever there was a place that is worth the money, this is it.  You can see where your money is going.  This is not the kind of place you go to once a month, maybe more like once a year.  Or at least once in your life.  Save up the money and go.",0.9996,0.76,0.205,0.035,0.5811247653183137

Given the price, the staff to diner ration, etc. etc. these things could be improved. First, salt. There were two dishes (surf clam and and lamb) that had components that were burn-the-tongue salty. Seriously - burger king chicken sandwich levels of salt. In the case of the clam, when all the elements were mixed in one bite, it worked out okay. A number of other dishes were also at the too-high end of the salt spectrum, though not to that drastic of an extent. Which brings me to flavor. The problem with having too much salt is that it interferes with tasting anything besides the salt. In general, I think the focus here is on avant garde technique and beautiful presentation and flavor is neglected. There were a number of dishes - even those without salt problems - that tasted good, but not exceptionally good or interesting or unexpected. The earl grey cookies didn't really taste of anything at all, although that course worked as a whole. Wine pairing was hit and miss - for the first half of the tour, things didn't match so well for me, and some of the wines didn't work for me at all, but the second half was spot on (although it's possible that nothing pairs well with menthol) Finally, I wish that there was a restaurant in this class that was as creative with the front of house as it is with the food. There are so many other possible ways to experience a meal - it shouldn't always have to be a dim, hushed, dining room with erudite and slightly stuffy waiters.

It could be due to laziness but let's use the ""too amazing to put into words"" excuse. Alinea shouldn't be listed as a restaurant and instead as an experience or Chicago attraction. Everything in your environment is mute so you can use all of your sense to engage the food. Achatz and his incredible staff are in the business of creating 'awe'. We dined here during the fall and were lucky enough to be one of the first seatings to experience the new menu for that season. We chose the twenty three course tour and set out for a two and a half hour long culinary experience.  Our sommelier guided us to eventually choosing a thirty year old Riesling which was excellent and paired well with most of our courses. He was extremely knowledgeable and I learned a great deal since I'm not a huge wine drinker. I'm not going to go over each course since that would take forever and having been so long since I was there, an injustice to them. Each course was amazing, the combination of flavor profiles, textures, presentation and smell was impeccable. Each ingredient melded well with everything else on the plate and the course following it. Not only are the flavors well developed but the methods for delivery are too. It's a very interactive experience in which you will eat food in unconventional ways. The real highlight for us was when Grant Achatz came table side to prepare Chocolate. We all tried to think of something witty to say as this occurred but the spectacle just took over and I'm pretty sure I personally just stared like a kid meeting his sports hero and maybe muttered ""AWESOME"" a couple times. By far this is the best food experience you can find in Chicago. The waitstaff were a little austere at first but warmed up a great deal once they saw that we were here to really enjoy the food and not just sit here for the upper class brownie points. They worked with the kitchen to pace the courses just right. They answered our bevy of questions and even joked a round a bit once the dining room cleared out some (we had a late seating). When we were winding down to the last few courses they chatted with us and we talked about other spots in the city. Chef Achatz was nice enough to autograph our menus and then we were on our merry way. Twenty three courses does leave you just a tiny bit full, but manageable.  Dining here is going to take some planning. Reservations can top out a month or more ahead of time and it's spendy. I believe the bill came to about $850 for three of us with drinks before gratuity. It's a very special experience that I would recommend having at least once. And let's face it, you're never going to grab a table at El Bulli so why not get the best of this hemisphere?",0.9987,0.79,0.195,0.015,0.5304486665597777
2010-07-10,5.0,"My now husband, then fiance, and I went in '08 our first trip and returned last summer (09').  There has been quite a bit of talk about treatment by the staff.  I believe they have a knack for reading their guest and mirroring their behavior.  If you feel you received snotty service, you probably acted like you were hot shit.  More than likely it's do to one of two things:  you are new to fine cuisine and are trying to act as if you fit in or you have eaten it all and nothing impresses you anymore.  If you are carefree and whimsical, they to will join in the laughs and become less formal.  Pretentious=formal. We know because our first trip was our first truly fine dining experience.  We had enjoyed some great food, but not top 50 in the world.  We were trying to fit in and probably gave off a pretentious vibe.  Our second trip we had eaten at The Fat Duck and La Table de Joel Robuchon to new just a few.  And after seeing the others at Alinea show outward signs of delight, we learned to be ourselves and chuckle at the experience...enjoying the moment instead of taking notes of highs and lows.  The staff and other customers all seemed to be a little giddy with excitement through out the evening as well.  Both times we observed tables that were friendly and those which were pretentious and the service seemed tailored to your expectations.  I'm just saying you get what you put out, which I believe to be the ultimate customized service experience. Also, I'll just say now that I don't care about wine, so you won't get an informed review on that topic here.  I did enjoy the 4 wines we have consumed there, but I lack the words to properly describe and critique them.  For me it's all about two things, the food and the experience.  I can't even begin to give critiques about individual dishes as we've had over 40 now, but I'll say these few things in general: 1).  It's experimental, there are hits and misses: the hit ratio for our two experiences was roughly 60-65% and we didn't always agree  2).  When it hits, you'll crave it forever and be left wanting more which I see as a good thing 4).  the dishes illicit discussions of nostalgia and creativity  5).  The entrance is great, but the inside decor is too plain 6).  You'll get to hear Achatz scream profanities at the staff from the kitchen at least once, and it's hysterical dinner entertainment (not to mention it highlights his commitment too quality and consistency) 7).  It's whimsical and innovative...chill and don't expect large, rich classic french dishes 8).  If you go more than once, expect a few repeats.  This would be fine had they been my favorites, but they seem to be the ones I don't care for.  Try and go during different seasons or you might see even more repeats. 9).  I haven't been to Moto so as far as competing Chicago restaurants go, I don't know which is better. But although La Table de Joel Robuchon is the epitome of haute cuisine Alinea tops it in my book and Robuchon is second only to Achatz..  Why? I'm a fan of the long tour of tastes.  Execution is key just as with French masters, but it's not the same old sauces that heavily populate the world's best restaurants.  I laugh when I eat Achatz creations, and find myself craving them almost weekly. 10).  Although the techniques and flavors vary greatly from others in the culinary world, Achatz definitely has his favorites that you will see reused many times.  Foams, freezing, gelatins, tapiocas, food delivery devices,and others are repeated frequently and loose their initial intrigue.  They are rarely used to the detriment of the flavor though, as some gastronomic chefs will overlook (So I've heard of WD-50).

2010-06-30,5.0,"There really isn't much to say about this place that has not already been said on here, so i am not going to drone on about every course in detail.  I will say that Alinea was the most mindblowing experience i have ever had involving food.   The attention to detail is immaculate from the food, to the service, to the overall atmosphere.  All of the unique little apparati that are used in place of plates and utensils were so cool.  Apparently the chef has them made just for him.   Food is quite simply turned on its ear.  After a while you feel as if you are becoming numb to surprise, but then dish number 20 comes out and you are, yet again, blown away.  There are flavor combinations that you would never imagine would ever go together, but chef knows how to make it work!  Case in point:  lobster, lychee, ginger and gruyere cheese dipped in tempura and fried onto a vanilla bean?!?!  wtf!!  This was our second course, mind you, and we were simply perplexed by that fact that we not only thought it tasted good, but that it tasted amazing!  It was even more amazing that all of the flavors had their distinct ""window"" as it moved across the pallet.  It was never muddled.  I might also add that the smell (vanilla bean), texture and temperature were also perfect.  The rest of the dishes followed a similar suit.  Never dull, always surprising and always delicious.  during the final course, they really pull out the big guns.  I won't tell you what it is, but i can tell you that it is the only time i have ever whipped out my camera and taken video of my dessert being made. The service was nothing short of exceptional.  You dont really have a waiter, but more a wait staff.  There are no bus boys, there is simply a crew of people that know everything about your meal, keeping careful eye on any of your potential needs are desires.  One would think that a restaurant of this caliber would have a somewhat stuffy, if not pretentious wait staff, but this was totally not the case.  They definitely walked around with an air of ""i work at THE SHIT restaurant"", but, yet there is something very personable about everyone that waited on us.  We knew everyone by name by the end of the experience, and they were able to joke around with you and indulge in mindless small talk, all while staying totally on their game and not skipping a beat.  When a glass was empty, it was taken off the table within 10 seconds.  When a course was finished, the ""dishes"" were immediately taken away.  Every time a dish was taken away, another course was there in front of you in less than 5 minutes.  When you are leaving the restaurant, one of the waiters hails a cab for you.  Truly amazing from start to finish. As far as price goes......yeah, its gonna hurt.  That said, its totally worth the money.  You are not just paying for food, but for an all encompassing experience.  I know it sounds like i am exaggerating, but it is just THAT out of this world.  Just go.  Do it.  Get the tour ($225) and the wine pairing (75% of that), and live life to the fullest for 4 hours.  If you are going to go, do it right, because, lets face it, you aren't going back any time soon. PS - Black Truffle Explosion is simply orgasmic.  I have thought about it every single day for the last week and a half",0.974,0.859,0.088,0.053,0.5608579638752053

Such a great culinary experience, for reals. My friends and I got lucky with the reservation since we were going for Lollapalooza. We're obviously not from Chicago area and were definitely excited a table opened up. I can't believe how Grant Achatz relearned taste and then created these amazing dishes. We had a tube that had 3 different flavors, hibiscus, then pomegranate, then bubble game... HOW THE HECK DOES HE DO IT? Also, Grant, please adopt me. The short course is 16 dishes. We were all stuffed and carrying our stomachs to Second City. The Sommelier was very entertaining and I loved his wine choices. I'm a light weight, so I could only take a few sips from my wine pairings. Thank goodness I was there with male friends, who helped me drink it. However, I did finish one that stood out which was the K Syrah with my wagyu kobe beef steak and dried A1 sauce.

Below are a few comments that you hopefully find useful and unique. The food - yes it's amazing. One note, Alinea prides itself on ""surprise."" If you're looking for ""traditional"" food or a common theme there are others that do that better (Charlie Trotter's Comes to mind). The service - unbelievable. One of the ladies in our party rubbed her arms as she was a bit cold. A server was over within 10 seconds offering her a pashmina to use to warm up. Yes there is a wine pairing that is optional. It costs approximately 75% of the price of the meal. So if you are doing the tasting at $150, the wine parings will run $113. I would estimate the size of the pairings is equal a standard 4oz pour. I recommend the pairings, but if you are looking to keep costs down this is an easy place to do so.  The Chef Achatz name rymes with Jackets and Rackets. There is an Allinea book. Published in 2007, this ""cookbook"" is really more of a coffee table book with great photos and background on the restaurant. It makes an excellent accompanying gift if you are taking someone there for a birthday,etc. Finally, I know you've heard it before, but black truffle explosion.

One of the biggest biggest issues i had with my food was that it was WAY TOO SALTY. and i have an extreme salt tooth, i put salt on everything i add salt to salt and vinegar chips, so i can handle salt... and i couldn't handle some (most) of the dishes that were brought out. My friend felt the same way. Now unfortunately i don't know if it was just a mistake that day and someone slipped? or if that's just how it is.. but it made some things difficult to swallow.

2010-06-08,5.0,"The Skinny: on the cutting edge of innovation, this place deserves it's accolades (5), service is profession if not a little bit anal (5), value - well, we travelled across the country to get here... and it reigns as one of the most memorable dining experiences we've ever had... well worth the plane ticket, hotel and the cost of the prix fixe (5). My hubby has been harping about going here for the longest time and finally we were able to fit this into both of our schedules. We had poured over pictures of his ""coffeetable"" cookbook (bible more like! and really, not a cookbook for home chefs... like who has liquid nitrogen at home?) and were really psyched about coming here. It was well worth the travel and wait. I think the thing that really sold us was Chef Achatz's versatility. I mean, really, we expected all this crazy stuff coming (hot potato/cold potato, that truffle in a ravioli... OMG! so good) out of the kitchen but then he all the sudden surprises us with a delicious squab/foie gras on puff pastry dish that certainly displays pure, traditional French technique. My hubby and I have that dish totally ingrained in our memory. The way that this restaurant differs from some of the other molecular gastronomy places is the balance of techniques. You need a balance of the old and the new - otherwise it's just some gimmicky thing that will be passe with differing food trends (like foam). The chef definitely uses his art judiciously to enhance his raw materials - not to overwhelm them. Finally, the service. Okay, I was a little perturbed that my flash went off a couple times by accident and the camera nazi quickly reminded me that we weren't allowed to use flash (like instanteously).  However, despite all of this, the service was quiet, attentive and professional. Our server was a little stoic but definitely acted like he knew what we were eating. When my husband got a little dribble on his shirt, the server rapidly and discreetly handed him a small packet of Shout wipes to help get out the stain. Really great service! The actual icing on the cake was when Chef Achatz came out himself and served the final dessert course. Of course, he didn't talk much other than to explain the dish. He looked kind of gaunt and tired which is probably in light of his medical condition. We really appreciated the gesture of him taking the time out of his busy day to serve us the most memorable part of the meal.

2010-06-06,4.0,"I shall give this restaurant 4 stars because the service, creativity, and presentation of the food is just superb.  Taste-wise, the food did not completely blow me away.  There were definitely some outstanding dishes but there were more ""okay"" dishes than I would have liked.  However, I really think it is more a matter of personal preference of the foods served. I have to give props to those who manage to do the Tour.  I had the Tasting, and I was pretty stuffed at course 10-11.  I was kind of hoping the food would stop coming.  The wine pairing is recommended if you can handle your drinks.  Ladies be careful.  That port at the end is STRONG, and they definitely give you more than what you'd get if you ordered port at other restaurants.  The sommelier is knowledgeable but if he were lying to us, we wouldn't have known the difference anyway.  None of us are that well-versed in wines nor are we very knowledgeable about the small towns in some European country of which the vineyards are located. The service is great.  If someone sees you leaving your chair, they rush over to help you out.  They lead you straight to the hallway to the restroom and open the door for you.  Your drink (if it's not wine) is constantly being refilled.  The waitstaff will even joke with you! As far as the food goes, it's a hit and miss.  My favorites, though, were the curry pork belly spring roll and the hot potato/cold potato.  I'm not even a fan of truffle, but my goodness, that dish was savory.  The creativity that goes into the dishes were amazing.  If you had not told me what I was eating, I would probably never figure it out except for maybe a few ingredients.  I love how they use scents to further the eating experience.  Overall, the meal was definitely an experience, and something to try once, but I don't think I would come here a second time.",0.9962,0.773,0.196,0.031,0.536868686868687

2010-05-20,5.0,"Believe it or not, I ate here in September 2009 and had this review saved for several months! So, here it is, for what it is: Imagine waiting in line at the Post Office being totally disgruntled when you get a text message saying that you're going to Alinea in two days. Well, it happened to me, and truthfully, I almost couldn't go.  ""Couldn't go??"" you shout? ""Are you crazy!?"" Well, working until 9pm on a Wednesday night leaves little room to arrive at a 9:30 reservation. But thanks to my managers who let me leave early and the fact that I changed, met my boyfriend, and practically broke the speed of sound driving there, we arrived right on time! ::phew:: Now to the main event. I was so nervous walking in, it was almost as if I was going to meet the President rather than sitting down to dinner. You walk down a long corridor and sliding doors open where lovely servers greet you warmly. To your right, you catch a glimpse of the kitchen where the best food is being prepared just for you. How exciting! My boyfriend, his friend, and I were seated upstairs. We were fully prepared to do the 23 course ""tour"" as it is called, but we did not get the wine pairings with it. Instead, we were encouraged to try a nearly 30 year old wine that would go with almost everything we tried that night. We were given nothing but the best service, knowledge about what we were trying, and care. Alinea loves you. And you can't help but love it back.  I can't count the number of times my boyfriend and I looked in awe over our friend's head at what wonderful treats we would be given next. We were scolded like children for not answering a question or paying attention to a story. But it can hardly be helped! When you are given pheasant tempura skewered on a burning branch of oak leaves, or a tube of long pepper, hibiscus, and creme fraiche to mimic the taste of bubble gum, what else can you do but gasp in delight like a 5 year old meeting Mickey Mouse for the first time at Disney World??  You clap your hands in delight and close your eyes encasing every taste, smell, and sound your senses explode upon you. It's like a dream you never want to end.  But end it does, and what an ending! The table cloth removed, and a special silicone mat placed over the table. Two chefs come out (one of them being none other than Grant Achatz himself!) and pour an overwhelming amount of freeze dried blueberries, chocolate mousse, and even a tobacco sauce all over the table! We were given nothing but a spoon and then we had to duke it out on who ate what and got the last bites.  The servers were funny, caring, and catered to all our needs. We asked questions, we engaged them in conversation, and there was nothing but smiles all around.They weren't pretentious or snobby. Although we ate for nearly 3 hours, I was comfortably full and couldn't ask for anything more. I have nothing but praise and good words for Alinea. Anyone who says less was probably having a bad day before they stepped inside.  At the end of the best meal of your life, you are given a small menu listing what you ate during your ""tour."" Asking nicely, we wondered if Mr. Achatz would sign our menus, to which the waiter agreed. ""Refine and Redefine!"" is written on mine. It holds very true to Alinea's mantra.

The four-and-a-half experience was like culinary theater, often surprising us and making us giggle with glee. Everything was delicious, but what made it even more enjoyable was the thoughtful and inventive visual and tactical elements. Some highlights for me included: - the components for spring roll, including rice paper with beautiful floral elements, presented on a specially designed tray that required the diner to interact and create his or her own wrap - a three part king crab course presented as a sphere that deconstructed into a plate and then a bowl - a black truffle explosion -- an orgasmic single bite - a single bite of sardine where the diner is instructed to eat it without hands - squab beautifully presented on a birch log - sucking the essence of bubble gum out of a test tube - Chef Achtaz and his sous chef constructing a chocolate landscape at our table I found our servers to be very friendly and attentive, and our sommelier was very knowledgeable giving us lots of details on the origins of each wine and why it was chosen for the pairing.

2010-04-30,5.0,"3 WORDS: BLACK TRUFFLE EXPLOSION There's something about automatic glass sliding doors that turn me on..                                                  ..being named #7 restaurant in the world doesn't hurt either.                                What better way to celebrate a long weekend than to hit Alinea on a Good Friday. After you valet ($10) your car, you enter into a discreet looking gray building which you would never surmise to be a Culinary Heaven. Upon entering, at first, you feel like you are entering a posh nightclub, with floor moldings full of pink backlighting. Your resy is confirmed and you make your way to your table. You immediately notice that tables are against the wall with ample walk room. As you sit, you notice a pair of chopsticks in a metal vessel holding up what appears to be sandwiched edible flowers between summer roll rice paper sheets. You are told not to touch and are left to your imagination as to what that will be used for later. Upon sitting, your waiter asks if you have any dietary restrictions to cater to. You state them and the feast begins. THE MENU Since I wanted to enjoy dinner sans taking notes, I asked the waiter if I could request a menu after the dinner service was complete, hinting that I wrote about food. Unbeknownst to me, you are never shown it during service, but the menu is tweaked for each guest and you receive a (virtually indestructible) dated custom menu on your way out. As for the menu itself, the fuzzy circles represent a map of your meal - the area of the circle corresponds to the size of the course, and it's left-to-right position corresponds to its relative sweetness or savoriness. A stroke of pure genius IMO. We were told the menu evolves daily and changes every season so I will definitely be back! THE DISHES Each dish..scratch that..food vessel is tailor made to GA's liking, most of it being stainless steel and minimalist. There was the squab dish that was served over a birch log a lobster dish which had literally 3 layers of food, reminding me of a Russian babushka doll. The sheer number of ingredients used to prepare each dish is a remarkable feat in and of itself. Those who actually cook will appreciate that. If you notice the ordering of the entrees, they don't sequentially go from light to heavy. The hostess agreed w/ me when I mentioned palate fatigue so they know how to change it up. Note the curvature and size of the bubbles on the menu change as an intentional way of circumventing that. PICS GA hates bloggers & pics so I think the lighting is intentional. NO FLASH so pics were still taken but none of which I would proudly publish. When GA himself prepared our dessert AT OUR TABLE (perhaps hinting about writing about food had something to do with this, as the table next to us only got his Sous Chef...Suckers!), we didn't force the issue of taking a pic with him, although we were feening for one.  THE FOOD Some dishes were farfetched for me. ALMOST EVERY DISH was on point, besides the eucalyptus which overpowered the squab and the steelhead roe w/ plantain, ginger, papaya which was served in a candy purse, which messed with my senses, teetering back and forth from sour to sweet and vice versa. In the 2nd to last dessert, the lemon was too tart and didn't synch with the white chocolate, despite the ingenious idea of serving the plate OVER a deflating earl grey infused pillow. BTW, I later came to find out that the summer roll rice paper sitting on our table was for the deconstructed summer roll dish which had this CRACKTACULAR pork confit in it. On the flip side, if I had to name ONE DISH that blew me away, it would have to be their signature BLACK TRUFFLE EXPLOSION. You are told beforehand not to face your dining companion and to clench your mouth shut before biting, and for good reason. THE PIèCE DE RéSISTANCE Grant serving you dessert...AT YOUR TABLE? Are you kidding me? No other high end restaurant has done that for me. The unforgettable finale was that of a NITROGEN CHOCOLATE MOUSSE emptied out from a loaf pan, chipped at with a custom mini metal dagger and placed atop a soft gray silicone tablecloth. Chunks of chewy white coconut are then placed strategically before Grant uses a metal spoon to create a coconut milk dotted trail, one dot smaller than the next. Menthol is also placed randomly and turns into a square shape, with hyssop meticulously placed over it with tweezers. He then walks away and you are left in awe of what just transpired, too fixated on the Chef to have paid attention to his 'tangential' actions at the time. What a jizzmatic combination of flavors.

2010-04-29,4.0,"Dinner at Alinea was delicious. I can't even describe how good the food and wines were. I can't say that I loved every course, but I sure walked away from dinner thinking about how to work some of those Alinea flavors into my dishes at home. One thing I'll say- I'm not sure that kind of food is really for me; the ""gastro-pub"" type food. I try to go out of my way to eat whole foods, and all that manipulation didn't really go over very well with my body.  The food at Alinea was amazing, the flavors were stunning, and every bite surprised. But for me- well, to put it delicately, my body couldn't really process the food. It actually made me pretty sick. Which, was kind of a buzz kill.  That said, I'm so glad we went. It's something I've always daydreamed about, and the experience met all of my (very high) expectations.",0.9704,0.706,0.209,0.084,0.6969962207105065
2010-04-29,5.0,"So you *think* you like food... When you go to Alinea, be prepared to have your world spun around and turned completely upside down because this experience will completely change the way you think about food (in a good way, of course). Alinea might have just been named the best restaurant in the US (#7 in the world) for 2010, but to me Alinea will always be one of the best experience I've ever had in my life.  Chef Achatz have done everything from the minimalistic decor, the use of scents in some of his dishes (lavender air slowly coming out of a pillow that your plate is sitting on), the use of visuals (""plating"" food on a silicone mat on your table right in front of you), the use of unique serving ""vessels"" (a piece of bacon sitting on a swing, come on man!!) to get you to indulge in your senses during your time at Alinea.  The ""truffle explosion"" that I had was probably the best bite I've EVER had in my life. I'd love nothing more than to find the remote control that control my life and just hit pause there for a little while (and then maybe rewind and play in slow motion after that).  For what it's worth, I would recommend the tasting menu (~12 courses) as opposed to the tour menu (~20 courses). I left feeling pretty full (and a little drunk) after doing the tasting. Do yourself a favor and go with the wine pairings. Some of the pairings were unbelievable!!! I think that night we ended up getting 14 courses with 9 different wine pairings!! The bottom line is that, yes, this is an outrageous price to be paying for a meal (especially with the wine pairing). But this is a once in a lifetime type experience (unless you've just got a lot of money to burn). You're pretty much paying a premium for perfection. Know that EVERYTHING has been thought out as to make you experience what the geniuses at Alinea want you to experience. You just have to hang on for a few hours for the ride of your life. Note: I called ahead to ask about the camera policy (I didn't want to be rude and understand why some restaurants just don't allow photos all together). But Alinea only forbid flash photography (just turn up your ISO and turn off your flash). The waiters are really nice about telling you when you need to hurry to take the photo before something gets cold.",0.9948,0.827,0.145,0.028,0.5742063492063492
2010-04-29,5.0,"I really can't write anything that hasn't been written before.  Basically, Alinea lives up to the hype.  Simply put, it rocked my world.  It is #7 in Pelligrino's 2010 World's 50 Best Restaurants for good reason. The outside is completely unassuming and the corridor to the restaurant is otherworldly.  We were seated in a room on the second floor and the first thing that caught my attention was that the man next to us was eating a very intricate dessert off the table.  That's right, no plates, just spoon on rubbery tablecloth.  Once seated and settled, it dawned on me how quiet it was.  There was no ambient music.  Even though when we were seated, there were 5 other parties in the room with us (plus a handful of servers), the silence was intimidating.  We felt the need to be quiet and hush-hush as well. We got one wine pairing in a glass that we shared, and that was amazing, for lack of a better word.  The sommelier had a ginormous afro and his demeanor and appearance beared an uncanny resemblance to Johnny Depp's Mad Hatter.  He was energetic and his explanations and background to each and every wine was delightful.  I highly recommend doing the wine pairing; splitting one between two people was the perfect amount to sip on and enjoy with each dish. We weren't disappointed with the 12 course tasting; every course was a crazy mix of a sensory experience that touched upon sight/presentation, smell, taste, texture, sound (yes! Our last dish was a bubble-yum hibiscus cigarette thing that made a funny low pitched grunt as you sucked the contents into your mouth).  This was not just dinner, it was a show.  The whole experience seemed to throw out the conventional concept of eating.  For example, we were given an earl grey infused pillow, not to sleep on, but for our lemon custard earl grey cookie dessert course to sit on, and as the pillow slowly deflated, it emitted the aroma of earl grey as you ate.  How cool is that? At times, we longingly eyeballed the other patrons who were doing the 24 course tour, who were presented with things like a giant log.  Umm, I want to eat whatever delicious morsels off a giant log! At the end of the meal, they present you with a menu in a big black envelope.  That was a nice keepsake and reminder of the most amazing meal I've had to date. There were 2 downsides to my once-in-a-lifetime experience.  First, I got chastised for taking pictures of my dishes.  Seriously?  Okay I understand it's kind of bothersome if you're using a flash but I turned off my flash and I told the woman that.  She said ""but your camera still gives off a light"".  Dude.  It's a red blinking light that most people's camera gives off if you don't use the flash, like the red recording light when you use a video camera.  Hey, we're dropping some big money here, it's not like I'm being a paparazzi and going flash crazy.  The table next to us had to leave early because the woman got drunk after her 5th course, couldn't eat anymore, was throwing her head on the table every 3 minutes and nearly stumbled down the stairs.  And they were frowning on me for taking pics even without a flash?  I'd say her demeanor in the nearly full room was much more distracting than my picture taking when it was nearly empty. Secondly, the staff was attentive, so painstakingly attentive that it was almost borderline uncomfortable.  We could see them lingering at their waiting area talking about other patrons (namely, drunk woman), and sometimes it felt like we were children at a library being observed by the librarian.  Still, those two things did not detract from the experience that much, and I cannot speak highly enough of Chef Achatz's culinary creations.  The Alinea experience brings food and eating to a whole new level.",0.9775,0.828,0.107,0.065,0.4865569023569023

The food and its presentation, especially the one-bite tempura-ed shad Roe, the compile-your-own pork belly spring roll, the duck in chamomile foam, and the earl grey and white chocolate dessert (served on an Earl Grey Creme pillow. Why don't they sell those at Pottery Barn?? The aroma was heavenly.)  Their allergy accommodations: they made delicious substitutions and were careful to understand exactly what I could and could not eat. The wine pairings: all the wines are unique and have an interesting story behind them. They don't seem to encourage it, but one tasting is probably enough for two. If you split it in two glasses, they will probably charge you a little more because ""it will be 2/3 of what we usually pour"" instead of half and half.   The sommelier is young with crazy hair (I wanted to ask him what he put in his hair to make it stay like that) but he grew on me because he is excited about presenting the individual stories of the wines. He speaks colloquially like most people in their twenties do, which makes him seem less formal and robotic than some of the staff. (I can see how the staff could come across as pretentious, but it's really just their job to guide you through the dining experience as it has been specifically designed in a fashion in keeping with the upscale atmosphere.)

And the presentation of the food which was gorgeous. But what ruined this what-should-have-been-immaculate meal for me was the attitude and proximity of the staff.  From the get go a waiter who presented us with a wine list turned up his nose and nastily said, ""No!"" when I asked if they had any wine from South America. (I adore Chilean and to a degree Argentinean wine).  The table next to us then inquired why they did not carry it, which set him off on a diatribe on how it is lesser wine, cheap, not well-developed, etc.  Apparently not only is the customer not always-right, her taste in wine should be criticized openly to the whole room. Whereas some restaurants, not having the wine you like, will gladly offer to go pick it up for you, Alinea rather slapped us in the face. That already left a bad taste in my mouth, which was agitated all night by the fact the gaggle of awkward waiters stood maybe 5 feet from our table against a dresser continually eyeing us as we ate. There is a not-so-fine line between attentive and obnoxious service. The waiters at Tru know when you need your wine refilled or are ready for your next course - they don't hover near you giggling and telling hushed stories to each other like a couple of high schoolers.  Maybe they should be sent over to Tru for a lesson in waiter and sommelier etiquette.

Also not recommended to help your boyfriend finish some of his drinks. So for couples, I recommend just getting 1 wine pairing for 2 people. For each and every dish, the thought and creativity can not only be tasted, but also seen visually and experienced by all the senses possible (e.g. lavender ""smoke"" pillow that sprays out smoke while you're eating a certain dish, the dessert that doesn't require hands).

2010-04-12,5.0,"Alinea is definitely not your run of the mill restaurant.  This is about as foodie as it gets (or as foodie as I've gotten) and diners should be aware that when you come to Alinea, you're coming for a complete gastronomical experience that caters to all your senses rather than just for a typical meal.  I believe reservations for Alinea need to be made some time in advance but I managed to find an opening a week before my trip to Chicago last September.  The restaurant itself is fairly inconspicuous.  Even as you enter the building into an empty hallway, there is no clear signage directing you to the entrance of the restaurant.  Instead a sleek sliding door opens up almost as if you're in some underground secret lair. Needless to say, it was pretty darn cool. We came for the tasting menu which was comprised of 13 different courses.  Each and every one of the courses was a unique tasting experience.  You could tell that the chef took time in thinking about how each flavor would complement one another, and also how each dish should be presented.  Dish after dish presented food that actually made you think about what you were tasting, smelling, and feeling.  I won't go through each and every course but I do remember the wagyu beef as a standout (as it always is).   The service here was prompt and professional albeit not at all overly friendly.  I wouldn't go as far to say that it was a stuffy atmosphere but they definitely could have had a bit of a sense of humor.  The dining experience is indeed an exceptional experience but it would have been nicer had it been perhaps not so serious. Overall, I would definitely recommend Alinea to anyone who is open to trying a new food experience and isn't too concerned about the minor damage to his/her wallet as the price per person starts as $150 for the tasting menu.

I'm not saying I know exactly what it's about either. I know very little about molecular gastronomy or cooking for that matter. I don't know Chef Achatz personally, I'm not a ""foodie"" and I don't care to be. I'm not rich or spiritual or any of that, I just know that going to Alinea was an experience; an incredible one at that, which I will NEVER forget.  Obviously the experience was even more memorable because it was my 2 year anniversary and I have never spent more than $50 dollars on a single meal, but the waiters and the hostess and even Chef Achatz himself made concerted efforts to make our night as pleasant as possible.  I'm a vegetarian, on top of that I am also an EXTREMELY picky eater. But when you make a reservation at Alinea, the scheduler asks if there are dietary restrictions, most people just say ""no meat"" or ""no gluten""  My list was about 15 different things...when we got to the restaurant, our waiter memorized all 15 items and repeated it to me just to reconfirm...  All of the dishes that included duck, or lobster, etc. were replaced by fennel or mushrooms, just for me.  This is the kind of effort that is put into each experience.  I was so blown away by that consideration.  Each dish was mesmerizing, even if I didn't specifically enjoy certain flavors (I forgot to mention I'm not a huge fan of menthol or eucalyptus) the purity of each flavor completely drew me in every single time.  What makes this restaurant extraordinary, and each meal in itself spectacular, is the work that goes into it, the respect that Chef Achatz has for each and every flavor he presents to you.  Nothing is muddled, every taste is distinct and seriously, probably took years to perfect.  I can honestly say that I was not a fan of a couple of pieces I ate that night, but in retrospect it wasn't about ordering something that was a safe staple in my diet, it was about experiencing and trying new things, tasting flavors in their most potent forms and having someone present to you their life's work.  I've always had trouble defining what art is, but this was it.  It was aesthetically pleasing, there was so much passion, hard work, sacrifice, precision and in the end the product was exactly as it was intended to be.  This experience is not for the closed-minded or the faint of heart.  You really have to be mentally prepared for 24 courses.  At this point, it's no longer just sustenance for your body; it's about taking note of the beauty of each element of flavor and respecting those who spend their entire lives cultivating that.  If you really can't take a closer look at what people like Grant Achatz are doing for the culture of food, then we really are just a fast food nation uninterested in anything else except gorging ourselves and going to places like McDonalds.",0.9862,0.84,0.102,0.058,0.5224775224775224
2010-04-02,5.0,"I. Love. This. Place. Chef Achatz has truly mastered the fusion of food and art and consistently creates dining experiences that put to shame pretty much any theatrical experience I've had. The food is always spectacular, creative, beautiful, and entertaining. It's definitely among the most expensive meals you'll have, but it's so worth every penny. I do, however, have 2 main beefs with Alinea: 1) Certain dishes get too much play. If you go once this isn't a problem, but become a repeater and you're going to see some things over and over. This is OK, but some of them were mediocre to begin with; bacon just isn't all that great, the transparencies are cute, but not very useful, and the yuba is just not that tasty. 2) Every time we go I don't get to meet Grant. Last summer the final dish was a table-side preparation that he was personally performing for every table. We were the last people in the place and he left just before our serving, so we got the second string. This is... annoying; I had specifically stated up front I wanted to meet him because I hadn't on previous visits. I understand that he can't always be at the ready for every request, but it was a little bit of a slap in the face that we were the only people in the place whom he didn't serve for. That said, I still highly recommend you find a way to make a visit. It's an experience you'll never forget. Having eaten at the Fat Duck the week before my last visit I can honestly say Alinea is a much richer experience. A few words of advice, though: -Eat well the day you go. If you starve yourself and then go you'll be miserable by course 13. -Pace yourself. Let them know a few dishes in advance if you need a break. It's a several hour experience, you don't want to rush through it. -Don't get the tasting, get the tour. It's twice the food and price, but the tasting is like getting the Cliffs Notes of the meal. -Get the wine pairing.

Since I've moved to Chicago I've become somewhat of a hardcore foodie (as much as a grad student's salary allows--a lot of restaurant week outings), and a friend of mine had been raving about Alinea.  The food was amazing, as you can tell from the other reviews. We had the 12 course menu. The experience was incredible--every dish had its own story and way of eating it, it was the most fun grown-up experience I've ever had. My boyfriend is also a vegetarian, and they made all the same dishes with vegetarian alternatives--he loved it as well. In all my experiences with vegetarian tasting menus, it almost seems like the ones that start out all vegetarian aren't as good as the ones where the meat/fish part is subbed out.  Now I think of the worth of things in terms of Alinea dinners. Like, should I go away for Thanksgiving, or save that plane ticket for a dinner at Alinea? You can guess the ending.  I would highly recommend this for a special occasion. You'll have to save up for awhile, but it's totally worth it!",0.9696,0.843,0.149,0.008,0.42520634920634914

2010-03-23,3.0,"As a vegetarian, I was not blown away by Alinea.  There are so may interesting directions for vegetarian food, and I feel that they didn't capitalize on any of them. Instead, I received the same thing as everyone else, just with some vegetable or mushroom substituted for the meat in each dish.  A decided lack of creativity there, something for which the establishment is supposedly known. In particular, the offals dish for the meat eaters: I received just mushrooms, carrots, potatoes, etc. as substitutes, whereas the chef could have gone all-out with strange and crazy vegetarian equivalents to offals (e.g. fermented, molded, tofu?).  But it seemed the look, not the concept, of the dish is what they replicated. Also, the wines were a bit too sweet for my liking. In general they seemed to pick underdog varieties, and it was fun to hear why they were actually better than everyone thought they should be. Despite my negative comments, everything was very tasty and it was an interesting and fun dinner. I'm glad I experienced it.",0.9482,0.806,0.14,0.053,0.47722222222222227

2010-03-21,3.0,"Prior to dinning at Alinea I imagined that any miss in quality would be surpassed by the elegance of the remainder. I was wrong.  In short: Alinea's quality to price ratio just doesn't stand up but it is still extremely intriguing. Fun: yes; interesting: yes; worth it:...sadly, no; would I go back: ...more upsetting, yes. Note: I indicate some dishes here but am purposefully vague on most as I feel it is best to go into Alinea blind. Before going further, know that I was slighted early on when, four courses in, the server forgot to serve me. Yes. That's correct. After serving the other members of our party, the server left the table. Having heard about the service, I couldn't believe the misstep and assumed he was retreating to bring my course. Everyone at my table (3 others in total) were aghast and finally caught the eye of the main host who served me the dregs of the dish that had served the rest. There was no apology or much indication at all. The only indication, was a shrug of ""it happens"" by the server. So, understand that a bias existed early on. We did the tour and there were huge successes. The course I was slighted on being a major one: a pork belly dish that I could eat daily for a year or life. Also two ""soups"", one of Duck with morels and foie gras, and another of green garbanzo and mint (served with a fork full of entirely passable octopus). The Black Truffle explosion was fantastic. However, there were some misses that seemed to be correlated with the presentation. One being a venison course served very elaborately. Another was the final course, a chocolate and menthol ""dish"" served table side by none other then chef Grant Achatz. The menthol was intriguing but the chocolate missed the mark. The texture seemed to be lost to the presentation. I was surprised to find courses at Alinea limited to and occasionally negatively affected by the presentation. Two more courses along this line were a sugar cane dish and a three part lobster dish. The former was simply forgettable. The latter started off incredibly but went into absurdly average with bits of lobster that would have been forgettable except for the fact that I remember not liking the taste, and ended with a bisque that was interesting but perhaps too briny (one of our party was a vegetarian and everyone agreed that her bisque was much better than ours). Since there was a vegetarian in our group I should mention that Alinea typically rises to the occasion. I tasted some of the vegetarian dishes and they played with the same ideas as the regular tour. In some cases they were a step above (bisque mentioned previously). However, there were big misses as well, such as the duck and foie gras soup that was done, for her, with mushrooms and left her very much wanting. Everyone did a wine pairing and I upgraded to the reserve pairing. The wines overall were superb, especially a Ripasso served late in the meal and an interesting white which had been pressed with the skins (Radikon Oslavje 2004). Of note is that a lot of the wines were a bit sweet to pair with the courses - overall the courses being served currently tend towards sweet. I was happy to have paid for the reserve pairing as the wines which I ""avoided"" were a bit more acidic then I would have liked.  I was happy right until the last wine poured: a 1976 tawny port. I don't typically drink 30+ year old port but I have had 30 year old port and I have loved the intense complicated flavor that comes from an aged vintage port. This was not such a port. It tasted like sherry with a slightly nutty aftertaste if one works past the extremely overpowering taste of alcohol. I was shocked but I was also helping finish off other desert wines and found great joy in a late harvest zinfandel from Dashe. So I set the port aside and tried to forget it. In the end I couldn't and commented to the main host who had been accommodating and entertaining other than the pork belly fiasco. The response was a polite indication that I was simply wrong. I wasn't asking for anything. I had already paid. If I was looking for anything it was a discussion of why I thought the port was off towards alcohol from any other aged port I have had. But I got nothing in return. I still feel that I need to justify 3 out of 5 stars. It simply comes down to the quality to price ratio. Two comparable restaurants that I have eaten are Minibar in DC and Don Alfonso 1890 in Sorrento, Italy. I had no problems at Minibar and the food and wine never missed as much as at Alinea (not mention the cost). At Don Alfonso, a fly landed in my wine glass. It was not their fault at all but they quickly whisked away my wine glass and provided me with a free dessert wine to compensate the lost glass of wine. Compare these two experiences to Alinea where they forgot to serve me a dish and did nothing, poured a glass of port that I won't soon forget, and had misses that seemed to only benefit the presentation. But yes, sadly, I would try again.",0.998,0.775,0.15,0.075,0.4867960090018913

2010-03-12,5.0,"Have you ever been to Wonderland? How about Oz? I have, in the form of Alinea. I never knew these whimsical places actually existed until I brought my palate here. Course after course I fell deeper down the rabbit hole. Words like creative and unique don't even come close to describing the fare served at Alinea. Grant Achatz really is our modern day Willy Wonka. As our 4 year anniversary approached we really felt there was no where more suiting than Alinea to spend it in. Chicago has become a favorite city of ours and I, a huge fan or Mr. Achatz. We made our reservation for the 29 course ""tour"" menu and started counting down the days.  As we made our way down the pink glowing hallway my heart was racing with excitement. Even though we were 30 minutes early for our reservation, we were greeted by name and sat anyway. We made our way up the stairs my eyes darting, looking for even a small clue as to what our evening would bring us.  The minimalistic decor provides a blank backdrop so the food really is the star. A caterpillar like cascade of purple flowers sat behind our dinner table and set the tone for the whimsy to come.  The overall feel of the atmosphere is genuinely fun. There was a level of service and class without it feeling stuffy or pretentious. No dish was ever explained in a condescending manner, no waiter was rude, and the room filled with laughter as the courses continued to arrive.   Some dishes shined more than others, some were true to the ""molecular gastronomy"" fad, while others simply showcased simple and amazing flavors.  The dishes to me that were the greatest stars of the night were as follows: Course 5- A do-it-your-self pork belly spring roll. At the beginning of the meal we were presented with 2 sheets of rice paper beautifully draped over a small wooden stand. In the papers were flowers and herbs. When the course arrived, we assisted in constructing a sort of tee-pee for the rice paper to sit in. Sweet and succulent coconut curried pork belly was spooned into the center and you chose your own additions off of a plate of 11 ingredients. I choose black sea salt, lime, onion, and additional herbs. I wrapped it all up and was wrapped up in the flavors of that dish the whole night. It was by far my favorite. It was like Thai street food made glamorous.  Course 10- Thai banana with a square of frozen Guinness beer with mustard and pecans. I truly wished this course was more than one bite, it was the definition of balance.  Course 12- Powdered peanut butter, when mixed with your saliva returned to an original creamy peanut butter texture followed by Cayenne pepper. In terms of creativity, I felt this dish stood out amongst the rest. The way the flavors developed from peanut to pepper was indescribable.  Course 13- Foie Gras, which seemed to be frozen, pushed through a sieve, over pear and white wine sorbet. My boyfriend and I both couldn't stop talking about this dish. It was like heavenly Foie ice cream. I wanted another scoop!  Course 18- Part of what was called ""cocktail hour at Alinea"". A passion fruit Hurricane with all the traditional New Orleans flavors. This drink was like first sip of ice cold Kool-aid on a hot summer day when you are 8 years old. It was perfection. Course 23- One pound cake bite with strawberry and lemon sitting on a bed of almond sugar. We were literally instructed to enjoy this dish like fun-dip. Eat the pound cake then lick the vanilla bean and scoop up the almond sugar. Besides the fact that it was pound cake perfection, any chef who uses fun-dip as inspiration gets an A in my book! Course 27- Earl gray cookies, lemon custard, candied pine nuts, and caramelized white chocolate served on a pillow of Earl Grey scented air. Can I say anymore? This dish was really like cookies and childhood. It was playful, rich, sweet, and had a wonderful presentation. 5 hours later, I was on a culinary high. My belly was near the point of exploding, but it was all well worth it. I love that the whole meal brought you home and brought you back to childhood. The raspberry transparency was like a grown-up fruit roll up. I even caught myself making little faces as I ate it. I loved course 24, which involved us sucking gelee (grown-up Jell-O), creme fraiche (grown-up pudding), and Bubble Yum out of a tube. What is more fun than that? Even the playful nature of the dessert that is prepared on your table was simply a chef playing with food. Nothing about the meal was too serious, too full of itself, or too out of reach for any palate to enjoy.   My night at Alinea will be one I will never forget. Meals that leave an impact on me are some of my fondest memories of life. I look forward to all the things Chef Grant is going to do and all of the minds he is going to open up to ""fun"" cooking. I for one, will always trust my Willy Wonka and take one more bite down the yellow-brick road.",0.9982,0.851,0.134,0.015,0.47185721685721677
2010-03-08,5.0,"My bf and I did the tour (29 courses = 5 hours of stomach and eye heaven) It was an unforgettable dining experience.

My favorite courses taste wise were the yuba, pork belly, thai banana, goose and bubble gum. My favorite courses look wise were the yuba, pork belly, lobster, hot potato, bacon (swine on a twine), venison, okay pretty much all of the dishes. It really is eating art.

The dishes covered Octopus, Lobster, Duck, Sturgeon, Goose, Venison, Pork Belly, and then some small interesting flavors.....  Honestly I only remember 2 dishes in whole. 1 was called ""Bubble Gum"" which came in what looked like a dime bag of well us your imagination and anyways when you placed in your mouth it exploded with a mind blowing flavor.... IT WAS TOTALLY AWESOME.... The 2nd was dessert and well I kid you not the chef comes out at this point and prepares the dessert and seriously the table...

The food is definitely different and covers a wide range of flavors, and for innovation I would give it a 5. That said, I can honestly say its not the most amazing meal I've ever had. I'd rate the food on a pure taste level a 2, and since alinea is a restaurant, i feel the food is what i should rate(gave it 1 more star because of the experience). I feel a lot of these reviews that give 5 stars, and comment that this is the most amazing place outstanding, etc are people who are just too scared to admit they just dropped a considerable chunk of change on food that actually didn't taste good, or their rating the experience. I will probably never go here again unless someone is paying for me. During our meal I can honestly say we were the youngest people there, and probably having the most fun.

2010-01-19,3.0,"Came here on my visit to Chicago back in September. Apparently this restaurant is really hard to book reservations for but luckily one of my friends called and they had a cancellation so they were able to fit us in last minute.  First off this is a very unique restaurant. Totally different from any restaurant I have been to. It was an experience unlike any other.  It was entertaining and a feast for your eyes but I must admit not a feast for your tummy. You can definitely tell that the chef put much work and thought into the presentation of each dish. We ordered the tasting menu which came with 13 courses. Every course was unique and different.  Some courses were really good  but some I thought were just ok. You could do wine pairing with the dinner but we opted to order just a bottle of wine. Which I think is the smarter approach. The wine pairing cost an additional 120 per person on top of the 150 you are paying per person for the tasting menu, if I remembered correctly. It definitely was not a cheap meal and will take a big chunk out of your wallet. So why the three stars you might ask....the staff I thought were pretty uptight. We tried to take pictures of our food and at times our flash would accidently go off and they would come up to us right away and remind us that we need to stop using the flash. What's the big deal right, I am sure no one is bothered by it and if we are paying the price that we are paying I feel we should at least be able to take pictures freely. On top of that there was no music at all in the restaurant and it was really quiet. I felt so uncomfortable and felt like I couldn't talk or act freely. I felt like I was being watch like a hawk by the staff, it was not a very comfortable atmosphere at all. I wish the staff and atmosphere would have been a little more relaxed and chill, it would've made the experience so much better.  Total price for the four of us was around 800 bucks. A big thanks to our friend who was so generous to treat us to this very pricey dinner.  I definitely don't regret trying Alinea because it's something you gotta try for the experience of culinary art.  But would I come back..most likely not. One time is good enough for me.",0.998,0.735,0.215,0.05,0.5175877262833787

I went to Alinea and of course, did the tour.  I just feel like if you are going to come here and spend the $$$, you might as well go all out.  However, instead of doing the wine pairing, my boyfriend and I each got 4 half glasses (2 whites and 2 reds each) and shared them.  I was honestly full by course 8 (luckily I willed myself to ignore my hater stomach), so I am glad that we did not do the wine pairing.   Courses I loved: Roe (1) - osetra with a clear gel that tasted like lemon, capers, and dill; brioche foam; creme fraiche; egg yolk emulsion Pork Belly (2) - A shot of lemongrass, fish sauce, and chili peppers - distilled so not spicy - the ""thai distillation"" part.  Then a plate with iceberg lettuce compressed with cucumber; pork belly confit and banana in a coconut curry sauce; avocado puree and basil seeds; dot on the plate of ""chili sauce"" - cayenne / bell pepper pudding.  Like an amazing lettuce wrap! Lilac (4) - Basically the creamiest, most delicious seafood chowder with perfectly cooked scallops and clams, lilac-scented discs, celery, fennel, and honeydew foam and melon balls.  Perfection!! Sweet Potato (9) - Tempura fried sweet potato - creamy on the inside and crunchy on the outside.  You suck the sweet potato puff off of an aromatic cinnamon stick burning at the other end.  (my BF's fave) Hot Potato (11) - The flavor of potato, parmesan, and truffle was delicious.  I wish the dish was larger as it was definitely one of my absolute favorites.   Wagyu Beef (15) - Tender and marbled with fat.  Loved the ""salt and vinegar chip"" Bubble Gum (18) - Tube filled with hibiscus jelly, creme fraiche, and orange gel (bubble gum tapioca pearls).  You suck everything out of the tube all at once.  It was so pretty I didnt want to ruin it.  But VERY delicious! Chocolate (21) - The taste of this dessert was pretty good, but when Grant Achatz himself makes it for you on your table, it becomes a favorite.  Cool, cool experience and presentation. If I could, I would give this place 4.5 stars because my boyfriend would start blowing smoke out of his ears if I only clicked 4 stars for this place.  It was amazing and unlike any restaurant I have ever been to...but it's not Schwa.  I love the rawness of Schwa, and this place made me feel anxious because of the laser-like precision with which the food is served.  Dont get me wrong, the service is top-notch and does everything perfectly, but I prefer a more laid-back vibe when I am supposed to be enjoying myself.  The food is fun and playful, so I think the servers should be as well.   Overall, amazing!!  I would go back tomorrow if I didnt have to pay rent every month.",0.9977,0.754,0.208,0.038,0.6946296296296296

Perhaps because of my experience at Moto  yelp.com/biz/moto-chicag…  of having to bail at course 18 of 20, I was a little (molecular), if you will, gun shy. The Moto and Alinea kitchens may share the same tools, but alas, its all in how you use 'em, as they say. In the middle of our 12-course indulgence I do remember commenting that there was actually identifiable food on some of the plates, which was reassuring. Ingredients in their natural and their scientifically altered states shared the same plate, and complemented each other well. 1. Osetra. Actual caviar with foams. Simple and delicious. 2. Pork Belly. Moto, take notes on how to cook pork here. Perfection. A 'thai distillation' shot was also provided with lemongrass and fish sauce flavors to prime you for the course. 3. Brook Trout. Mmm. with roe. Old school presentation to boot (glasses and silverware) 4. Pheasant. Affixed to an Oak twig with burning leaves. In a fried puff with apple and shallot. Tasty 5. Lamb. Flat iron style, 3 chunks of lamb on a hot iron with dabs of pumpkin and eggplant.  Paired with 2004 Schwarz Zweigelt, really good. 6. Duck with kumquat. Some reductions here, but actual duck and kumquats. Nice 7. Tomato. Real slice of tomato, figs. Some molecular-ness with the pine nut cheese and olive 'snow', but well executed. 8. Bacon, Peanut Butter, Thai Banana. Mostly molecular-ized. The bacon was just right (hanging from its own holder) and the Peanut Butter had a bit of spiciness. 9. Hay. This is the one with the pillow presentation. Burnt sugar, huckeberry and tobacco flavors with ice cream. Really well done. 10. Chocolate. Yet another dessert course. blueberry tobacco and maple flavors, paired with the classic Warres 2000 Port. 11. Bubble gum. long pepper, hibiscus and creme fraiche flavors presented in glass tube to be slurped up. Was pretty good. Yes, only 11. I think #8 counted for 2 or 3, but was served all at once. Overall, very good and would recommend it to adventurous friends. Please do try Alinea first, if you haven't been to Moto. Our experience at Moto almost turned us away from the genre, but glad we tried it again!",0.997,0.812,0.174,0.014,0.5168487394957982
2009-10-07,5.0,"I'm not sure where to start with Alinea, honestly. My boyfriend randomly took me here for a late-night dinner the night before I left for a weekend trip without him. I knew all about Alinea. I knew I was tired after a long day. I knew it was a terribly rainy night and I looked horrible. I also knew how much of his paycheck would go into the meal. Needless to say, I was pretty angry at his extravagance (though I knew he did it all in love), and I was not at all in the mood for a fancy shmancy dinner like this. So dinner definitely started off on the wrong foot. Luckily, by the time course 6 came around, I had gotten over myself and I started to feel like a kid in toy heaven. Actually, I felt like a judge on Food Network's Iron Chef and I was LOVING it. The bf, though, was scarfing every morsel down as if his life depended on it. That kind of made me sad, but I didn't let it get to me too much and I proceeded to smell, observe, and savor every course with absolute delight. And some of those courses were seriously unique and amazing. Like super wow. And our servers were sooo kind, so professional, and so hospitable. After 4 hours (a little past 1 a.m.) and 22 courses later, I was completely full and content and ready for our final dessert course of the evening. Let's just say that this dessert course was extra special. Because it came with an engagement ring. Haha. Who woulda thunk it? What started out as the most imperfect night ended in the most perfect way. :) In summary, Alinea will forever remain close to my stomach and heart.",0.9945,0.732,0.205,0.063,0.6452191987906275

2009-10-02,5.0,"I highly recommend this place if you have $$ to spend. Alinea is by no means affordable. Its uber extravagant for frou-frou food that won't actually fill you up. (I ate a few pieces of Fannie Mae chocolate and some Garrett's caramel popcorn afterwards). 5 stars though, because after you get over the fact that its $$$$$, the food, and service, was phenomenal. You're not paying for the food, you're paying for the entire experience. The restaurant has no signage outside, except for a well dressed guy standing in front. He opens the door for you. Before you is a short hallway, with wavy planks of paneling to the right, pink lights illuminating them. My friend and I walked to the end, only to realize that it was a dead. For a brief second, I was confused, unsure what to do. Then miraculously, a ""wall"" slides open and you see the entrance of the restaurant, with 2-3 people greeting you. Its like an amusement park ride!! Service was awesome. The well-dressed servers were attentive, and some even had a sense of humor! The restaurant was a little chilly, so I asked the waiter for a glass of hot water. Not only did I get a glass and a hot pot of water, but they also gave me a pashmina! Wowee.  Food - taste, smell, touch, sight. The only thing missing is sound! Each plate that came out was incredible, talk about avant garde food. The interactive senses were seriously at play here. Highlights: - Dessert served on top of a pillow that expelled scent of lavendar - Dry ice thingy that ""erupted"" with billowing white fog scent of ""grill"" served with kobe beef and mashed potato cube. - An individual bacon drizzled with maple, hanging from a thin cable contraption - One spoonful of the most delicious ""tortellini"" that exploded with flavorful juice and...caviar? Wanted more. Delicious! - One slurp of truffle with potato, served in a little shell with ingredients strung on a needle. From beginning to end, we were constantly surprised by presentation and taste. Sweet onion cotton candy??

2009-09-30,5.0,"Now this is a place that writing a review is almost unnessesary. It goes without saying that the concept of food has been taken to a new level. Maybe if you visited Spain and saw one of the new concept resturaunts you would have something to compare it to. MOTO is a shadow of Alinea, a strong shadow, but a shadow none the less.  What can I tell you about this place. You must be a foodie to enjoy it. You must be willing to submit to the will of the chef, his architect, his lighting designer, his artist who hand crafted the plates and utensils to accompany and harmonize with the food.  This is food taken to the hieghts of showmanship, you have light, you have smell, you have touch, texture, imagination, you get it.  What you also have to be ready for is the concept that price is no object.  If you have to look at the bill dont come, you will be disappointed.

2009-09-29,3.0,"since moving to chicago (and even before that), i've been dying to go to alinea. it was all i wanted for my birthday so this year we went. my experience was good but not as great as i expected from the food to the service to the atmosphere.  to start, we got a lot of pressure from one of the sommeliers about doing the wine pairing. we tried to decide if it would be worth 3/4 of our food bill and just couldn't rationalize it. after saying that we just wanted to do glasses/bottles instead of the entire pairing, the sommelier once again tried to tell us how worthwhile it was. i'm sure it is if i had thousands of dollars to spend all the time.  otherwise, the service was pretty nice. i tend to ask a lot of questions about the food i'm eating but at alinea they like you to just experience the flavors without knowing exactly what you're eating. so they were nice about it but told me basically to stop asking. as for the food, while many of the courses were amazing, there were some misses. i guess i've just never been to this nice of a restaurant and disliked some of the food so much that i couldn't finish it. with 24 courses it's bound to happen but i was still surprised.  my favs were the pork belly with iceberg lettuce, cucumber and thai distillation. this was exactly what i thought i would experience at alinea. really interesting, different than anything i'd had before and absolutely delicious. the other things i loved were the black truffle explosion and hot potato/cold potato. again, both were amazing, delicious and crazy. as for dessert, we got the silicone mat dessert and grant achatz himself artistically placed every item on the mat for us. i was totally startstruck and the dessert itself was awesome. the main dish that i didn't like was one that was several different versions of olives. i couldn't finish it. nothing about it tasted good to me. except for the silicone mat dessert, nothing else was a true dessert. we had several dishes that were savory and sweet. i'm all about savory/sweet combinations but some were just way too strange. i like to think i'm an adventurous eat but i felt like somethings such as the smoky peanut butter dessert (which really tasted partially like cigarette butts to me) were just not good. one other gripe. before leaving they gave me a copy of our menu and we asked grant achatz to sign it, which he did. i'm an idiot and left it in the cab on the way home. my fiance has been emailing them and calling them for almost a month now and they have not responded. after spending almost a grand at dinner, you'd think they could at least call us back. this put me over the edge to the three stars. it's truly a once in a lifetime experience. i don't think i'd want to do it again unless of course i wasn't paying for it. the food is worth trying but i'm still not sure that the price is justified.",0.9983,0.757,0.194,0.049,0.5869123931623931
2009-09-17,5.0,"best.dining.experience.ever. the service was excellent save for a few missteps and one server who was quite stonefaced.  also, all of us got the tour except for my wife who got the veggie tour and it was excellent too!  we couldn't have asked for a better evening!  perfection! here's the course by course break down: osetra, traditional garnishes - very much like thomas keller's oysters and pearls but a modern twist (and no oysters).  very light w/ perfect caviar. pork belly, iceberg, cucumber, thai distillation - their play on thai food and it was unreal. pork belly was excellent but what stole the show was the shot of a liquified thai chilies which smelled like it was spicy but had the pure flavor of the chilies w/out the heat. oxalis, juniper, gin, sugar - a gelee dish. it had a bitter flavor which worked well with the flavors of the berries, gin and sugar. lilac, scallop, shellfish, honeydew - this was quite a dish! the base was a lilac ""pillow"" that had essence of lilac. the seafood was incredible and so perfectly cooked. the honeydew foam added a nice sweet accent. pigeonneau, a la saint-clair - chef achatz showed us that he's not all about new styles of cooking. this was a classically prepared dish and was fabulous. the squab, foie gras, and the onions were exquisite and we couldn't have asked for a more perfect crust. black truffle explosion, romaine, parmesan - one of his signatures and it didn't disappoint. it's just one bite but as soon as it enters the mouth, the insides of the ravioli come out and all you're left w/ is black truffles in all of its glory. tomato, fig, nicoise olive, pine nuts - basil leaves and tomato stems that provide the aromatic blanket for this course.  a whole salad re-thought! there are olives, black garlic, charred figs and olive oil snow! a great combo of flavors and a dehydrated pumpernickel crouton added some nice texture. the heirloom tomatoes were so good! mustard, passionfruit, allspice bacon, butterscotch, apple, thyme sweet potato, bourbon, brown sugar, cinnamon - the mustard ice cream w/ allspice and passionfruit were presented as a disc and we were asked to let it melt in our mouth. it went from spicy to light to sweet. a very cool effect!  the bacon first and it wa perfection. sweet, salty w/ a herb twist w/ the thyme. the sweet potato was basically pie on a stick and perfect way to end the trio. sweet, creamy and w/ a nice bite. hot potato, cold potato, black truffle, butter - another signature of his. we had to pick up the bowl and pull the pin on the side so that the hot contents of the pin would drop in the cold soup and eat right away. the contrast of the temperatures and textures added to an already incredible flavorful dish! yuba, shrimp, miso, togarashi - the yuba (skin of tofu) was hardened and fried to give it a crispy texture. the shrimp was delicious and had the miso dip was outstanding! foie gras, peach, fennel, shiso - the foie gras and fennel which needed to be eaten right away and then the peach juice in the cup needed to be drunk right away. the savory and sweet is the mix here and it tasted nice! uni, aloe, yuzu, chili - this dish made its debut on the menu that night and we were asked by a lot of the wait staff on how we liked it. while uni isn't my thing, this was void of any weird fishy flavor or a weird texture. the flavor worked well w/ the yuzu and aloe but it was inconsistent from bite to bite. wagyu beef, powdered a-1, potato chips - wow! i've never had beef this good. the potato ""chips"" was like a cube of all that is good w/ potatoes. the powdered A-1 was a deconstructed version of A-1 steak sauce and was a nice addition as was the salt and pepper on the side but the beef really stood on its own. lemon soda, one bite - once in your mouth, this almost becomes a bite of lemon meringue. great and playful! transparency of raspberry, yogurt bubble gum, long pepper, hibiscus, creme fraiche watermelon, lime, nasturtium - this was a thin paper of raspberry which was a fun fruit roll up type thing and a ""cigarette"" of bubble gum w/ creme fraiche that needed to be sucked from the one side and a ball of watermelon w/ lime. just a fun course! rhubarb, goat milk, onion, lavender air - a pillow filled w/ lavender air was placed in front of us and the dish was placed on top.  the pillow slowly lost it's air as the plate sat and gave off this wonderful lavender aroma. The bites on the plate had a lil bit of cotton candy to drops of sweet onion. nice dish. chocolate, blueberry, tobacco, maple - the highlight of the evening. A silicone mat was placed on our table top and chef achatz prepped this on our table and every component was insanely good.  here's a video of this course:  bit.ly/vWIQS pound cake, strawberry, lemon, vanilla bean - a dense pound cake w/ strawberry in it and a lemon snow around it. the vanilla bean is used as a fork and adds a nice background flavor. lovely!",0.9997,0.758,0.217,0.026,0.6982155483405482

2009-09-16,5.0,"Honestly, I wish I could give this place more than 5 stars.  I've had the fortune of eating here twice, and while I would have given it 5 stars the first time, it was even better the second time around. Originally, when I called for a reservation, they said they only had availability for the shorter tasting menu for the date we were going.  However, when we got there, they said we could get the tour after all, thank goodness.  The wine pairing is very expensive but they're very flexible - I asked for an abbreviated wine pairing because I found it to be too much wine the first time I got the pairing, and they reduced the amount of each pour and also reduced the price accordingly.  They also came up with a beer pairing for my beer-loving dad. As for the dishes, I thought there were a couple misses the first time I went, but this time, I loved every dish except for one (uni), and that was more a function of not generally liking uni very much.  Some highlights:  - pork belly with cucumbers and thai spices/dressing on iceberg; this came with a shot of lemongrass/fish sauce/other thai flavors that smelled like hell but tasted amazing  - pigeonneau--Alinea is generally known for experimental/molecular gastronomy type food but they decided to throw one classical French dish in there and I'm so glad they did.  This was basically a tart with squab, foie gras, onions, and mushroom and was as good as anything I've had at nice French restaurants.    - sweet potato--basically a sweet potato, bourbon and brown sugar croquette served on the end of a cinnamon stick.  people who had the shorter menu got this as part of the dessert but we got it in the middle  - truffle explosion--they always have this on the tour, and I'm so glad they do, this might be my favorite dish.  Love truffle and it's never been better than when exploding in liquid form in my mouth  - this dessert that was basically a tube filled with layers of creme fraiche, hibscus jelly, and bubble gum tapioca pearls...those bubble gum tapioca pearls were definitely one of the best parts of a dessert i've ever had  - they were doing a pretty new dish...basically, they cleared our whole table for the second to last course and laid down a sterile, waterproof tablecloth.  then grant achatz came out with a bunch of small bowls and proceeded to create a piece of art directly onto the tablecloth.  he made this picture of malted ice cream, blueberry in different textures, chocolate, and maple spheres.  it was absolutely gorgeous and quite large.  we completely ravished this dish. So yeah, I think this place deserved more than 5 stars despite the astronomical prices and the sometimes cold service because the food is just on a completely different level than anywhere else I've been save maybe one or two places.  I've had some of the other ""best restaurants"" in the country, and I just think Alinea is so much more innovative while still remaining delicious.",0.9988,0.778,0.202,0.02,0.5339568970124524

2009-08-30,4.0,"WARNING SPOILERS: If you want to be surprised by your meal at Alinea, do not read this review. 25 courses over 4 hours.  The food was a strange and delightful trip. Very interesting to have a 140 yr old classic dish like the Pigeonneau a la St Clair served in the middle of a post-modern deconstructionist / molecular gastronomy dinner.  It showed they could do ""normal"" cooking at an extraordinary level as well. Let me describe some of the dishes: Oxalis - tiny little sorrel flowers that taste like baby snow pea shoots in a juniper gin gelatin.  Served on a shiny bent ""guitar pick"" eaten as a bite that is both crunchy (the flowers) and soft (the jelly). A dish called Lilac because of the lilac foam around the dish. The center of the dish is what ""seafood chowder"" would taste like if they served it in Heaven.  Clams and Scallops in cream but with fresh celery, herb sprigs, and a surprisingly sweet addition of tiny melon balls. Tomato with olive oil ""snow"" and olive-fig ""chocolate"" sauce.  Served with fresh figs with a large tomato plant brought to the table to proved an ""aroma"" addition to the course. Butterscotch Bacon and Japanese Cedar Smoked Date Parfait. Foie Gras with Fennel and Shiso (Japanese Mint) on a fork - just warm enough the Foie Gras melts like butter in your mouth with savory delight and a slight crunch from the Fennel. As you finish the Foie Gras, you drink the fresh Japanese Peach juice in the bottom of the glass for an explosion of lightly sweet fruit that clings to the fats on your tongue from the Foie Gras. Crab Parfait. This one was hard to wrap my brain around. The flavors were of ginger, spices, and carrots - like a delicious carrot cake. The texture was like a fluffy and airy parfait. Then at the bottom was *POW* king crab in gelatinized duck fat. The contrast of the flavors and textures was basically overstimulating all my taste buds. Two types of Rhubarb on Goat's Milk Cheesecake: A freeze-dried crunchy rhubarb sorbet and a transparent rhubarb ""glass"". These are served on top of pillows filled with lavender scented air. The weight of the plates slowly diffuses lavender from the pillow into your table area as you eat the delicious cheesecake and rhubarb dessert. All the food was absolutely amazing and definitely 5 stars.  The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is that I also got the wine paring (which raises the price to $500/pp from $300/pp after tax and tip) and I felt the wine pairing was not worth the extra $200.  I guess I am pickier with my wines and prefer mostly earthy reds -- the wine pairing was mostly whites, champaign, and a strong aquavit (and fire-water is not ideally the first thing they should serve on an empty stomach for a 25 course meal). I would highly recommend the tour with just one or two glasses of wine or beverage ala carte and you will save about $160-170 over the full pairing.",0.9975,0.815,0.164,0.021,0.5034834368530021

I ate here in January and like most people it was a special treat after hearing so much about this restaurant for years. My favourite dish was the plate that was a study in butter which had lobster,popcorn and curry all mixed together. A combination that shouldn't work but tasted amazing. The wagyu beef was also cooked to perfection (you will crave more however part of the allure of Alinea is that you will receive modest portions so that you do crave more).  Keep in mind that two people will easily spend $500 in Alinea so my expectations will always be higher when that kind of cash is being thrown around. On a funny note one of our servers (you will have many at Alinea who are all highly trained and attentive)rebuked my girlfriend for getting her plate with a linen cover on it dirty as she put her butter knife on top of it. Funny but a bit strange to be ticked off for ultimately getting a side plate dirty.

The most surprising thing about Alinea was the atmosphere. Although it is very upscale, there were still multiple people photographing there food and laughing out loud... pretty cool that the place could stay so down to earth.

2009-08-17,5.0,"There are many reviews here and elsewhere that capture various aspects of visiting Alinea, and there's no need to repeat any of that. My advice for anyone curious about the place is to not think of it so much as a restaurant, but as journey to the edge of the world of culinary experiences. The food, and the cost, is fantastic in the strictest sense of the word, and this is not a place to go unless you are specifically seeking a unique and outrageous evening that involves all your senses, with  food used as a medium of expression. I was challenged to keep track of all the flavors, aromas, textures, and even sounds and visual effects, and eventually just relaxed and let it flow over and through me. I am still ""digesting"" it all several days later. If this sounds weird to you, then don't go. You'll be bewildered and might even feel had. If this sounds fascinating and you're not squeamish about cost, odd ingredients, and treating food like art, then don't put off your visit until ""some day"" that may never come.",0.8641,0.845,0.094,0.061,0.5142857142857142
2009-08-16,3.0,"Aside from my old and dear friend's wedding, Alinea was the main purpose we recently traveled to Chicago.  (Well, that and Hot Doug's.)  I suppose that was the problem: with that kind of expectation, I'm not sure any restaurant could lived up.  I should have known better.  I should not have expected the culinary equivalent of David Blaine, to be wowed to the point of incredulity.  How did they DO that?  Instead, what we had was a well executed, if slightly overfilling, 12-course meal of haute cuisine.   There certainly were soaring high points (the wagyu beef was not only a fantastic cut but also perfectly prepared; the reduction infused with thai flavors was almost Blaine-ish in its magic).  There were lows (the crack pipe-like glass cylinder filled with desserts just didn't do it, nor did the gooey cube of potato).  The staff were expert, if not slightly odd at times, and the atmosphere was excellent.  I do feel the wine pairings were not worth the expense, I should have trusted myself to go off the list instead.  All in all, I think Alinea was worth the experience, but I don't think the experience transcended the sum of its parts.  I wish I could have had larger portions of a few of the dishes, rather than the smaller portions of many dishes, but that is the risk of the tasting menu.  That said, nothing anyone could have said on Yelp would have stopped me from going, that's how curious I was, so if you are like me, you'll go, just temper your expectations!",0.9624,0.793,0.136,0.071,0.5557814407814408

2009-08-11,4.0,"A THOUGHT: I feel like people HAVE to write good reviews of this place. It's required. I mean, you spend so much money, dang it, you'd BETTER LOVE IT! And even if you didn't love it for real, you'll MAKE yourself love it b/c you don't want to look stupid for blowing your rent money on dinner. That being said, this place is pretty amazing. I don't know if it's b/c I'm SUPPPOSED to love it, but it was a great experience, one that I'll remember for years to come. FOOD: The food was not only interesting and complex but aromatically and visually engaging as well. It really is an event. It takes hours. And I found joy in the way I was challenged by the food. It was actually pretty inspirational in some ways. I liked that even after 15 or 20 courses (can't remember how many there were, it's been a few months), I didn't feel over-stuffed.  STAFF/SERVICE The staff wasn't mad that we didn't drink wine. In fact, they had a great alternative they suggested, something they had picked out (for the Alcoholics?), some sparkling juice that didn't interfere with the food. WHY ONLY 4 STARS? My rating is more of an in between 4 and 5. The reason it flirts with 4 is because of inaccessibility for the financially challenged. I mean, I like good food and will pay the price, but this is flirting with ridiculous. It's kind of like how I wouldn't pay $2000 for shoes. Even though I can appreciate its design and aesthetics and fawn over it and say things like, ""Yes, it IS genius, it is the perfect shoe,"" I still can't bring myself to buy it. So even though I might pay $500 for a pair of shoes (which I think is still a lot), in the end, it doesn't make me feel great.  This is couture food.  And I appreciate couture. And I can champion their existence with the rest of them. But the inaccessibility, though it may be celebrated by many, is not a celebrated quality for me personally. And I don't mean to say conversely that cheap production for the masses is a quality I necessarily prize, either (though I can appreciate its contributions as well).  But like I say in my profile, no one should really read my reviews anyway. So don't get mad.",0.9986,0.691,0.253,0.055,0.6548295454545454

So the food is art. That's the first thing you need to realize. The presentation (most of the apparatuses are for sale on the website) is as important as the taste. For instance, I ate a dish of a piece of bacon which had been dipped in butterscotch and dangled from a tightrope. Yeah.  Also, if there is a ""scented pillow"" involved..just hold your nose. It can get a little overpowering, but remember...it's art.

2009-07-24,5.0,"Let me preface this review by saying a few things: first of all, if you are a person who thinks places like Bucca Di Beppo are acceptable places to eat, you won't like Alinea. If you think fast food is actually food, you won't like Alinea. If you are the kind of person who thinks that the more money you spend, the more quantity of food you should get, walk AWAY and never think of coming to Alinea again. Now, having said all that: ALINEA IS FOOD PORN. There is no way you could possibly replicate the experience at home, and probably 99% of all restaurants in this country couldn't come close.  It is as good as everyone says it is. There were only two things I would have changed about the experience. Firstly, the reservationist was a bit snooty. For a Five Star dining experience, I kind of expect that the whole thing--from the people you talk to on the phone all the way to the guy who hails you a cab at the end of the evening--should be top notch.  Secondly: the staff at Alinea are a veritable treasure trove of information. However they seemed to be a tad stiff and if I attempted to go beyond the usual ""what's this??!"" question format, they seemed uncomfortable and scurried off. Finally--the reviews are true. The 20+ tasting course is a lot of flavors (not necessarily a lot of food), but it is well worth it, as are the expertly selected wine pairings. To prepare for this meal, I ate very little all day leading up to it and had a nice round of cardio at the gym before I went.  In summation: if you are a foodie and have some cash to burn this place is TOTALLY worth it. GO.",0.9447,0.907,0.082,0.011,0.5366666666666666

Although, there was this one dish that I particularly want to emphasize: The second course of the evening came with a ""thai distillation"" that the kitchen distilled itself from lemongrass, thai chilies, and fish sauce. I caught a whiff and almost shed a tear because I could not believe just how much it smelled of home. It was the perfect encapsulation of everything beautiful about Thailand - in liquid form. A perfectly clear liquid so smooth and packed with so much memory-conjuring emotion. My fellow diner took a whiff and nodded his head urgently in agreement. If someone asked me to describe why Thailand is so amazing, I would simply hand them a shot of that distillation. It brought me home, tickled my amygdala in the brain that controls emotions and activated an undeniable homesickness that I have never experienced in food.

2009-07-16,5.0,"Alinea was magical. I surprised my boyfriend by flying him to Chicago and treating him here for his 25th birthday, and we both agreed it was the best meal of our lives (and we've been to Charlie Trotter's, L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon, Chez Panisse, etc.). Even though we ordered the 12-course tasting, we actually got a bunch of extras that brought our total to a very generous 18 courses each (plus a special chocolate birthday dessert for my boyfriend). Favorites were the black truffle explosion, hot potato cold potato and the melt-in-your-mouth Wagyu beef, which was accompanied by a gourd that billowed A-1-scented smoke (really!) onto our table while we ate. Even the little things, such as the goat's milk butter that was served with the selection of bread, were wonderful.  One of the most special parts of the evening was when Grant Achatz himself came out and personally prepared a dessert at our table that was inspired by a Jackson Pollack painting. He basically threw ingredients - including blueberries, maple and chocolate mousse - into an artistic heap that we then ate directly off the table (it was covered with a special material). I was totally starstruck when Grant came out, but he was very nice and chatted with us while he prepared the dessert.  The service at Alinea was outstanding - attentive without being overbearing, informative without coming off as pompous. The ambiance was also a nice surprise - I was worried it would be stuffy and quiet, but guests were clearly very comfortable and the restaurant had a nice formal-but-fun air to it. At the end of the meal, we were presented with beautiful customized menus that took into account the different dishes we had for some courses (my boyfriend doesn't eat pork) and listed our wine pairings (we got nine wines total) under the courses they were served with. My boyfriend's menu even came with a special birthday message, which was a nice touch.

I called in reservations about a month early, so not sure how hard it is to normally get reservations for a Thursday night. They called to confirm the reservations the day before, which is always a nice touch. The restaurant was kind of hard to find, and once we got in the door, seemed like a dead end. Then the door to the left slid open, which was a really nice touch. Everyone was really friendly and we were seated in the usual fancy restaurant manner with the table being pulled out and all that. We had the smaller menu, which was MORE than enough food. Everything was certainly quite good, it seemed like some of it was more for the sake of presentation than flavor. Every course was served by a different waiter, which was a little distracting, but as a result, the waiters were able to expertly explain what each dish was and how to eat it (and for some of the dishes you really need the explanation!). There were also matching breads for all the salty dishes. The butter-themed dish was my favorite, followed by hot/cold potato. The desserts were all good, but I didn't have much appetite left by then. I suppose if you want to enjoy these, you better skip on some of the breads. The service was amazingly attentive and paid a lot of attention to detail. We just had hot water with our meal, and the waiter made sure to keep pouring in more hot water to maintain the right temperature. The decor was simple, and the tables were spaced far enough apart that you couldn't really hear the other tables. However, that doesn't really mean that the place was quiet, as there is still a low hum. My final verdict is that it's a place you HAVE to try once (if you have the budget) if you're in Chicago, and probably only once. Save it for a nice occasion. It'll totally be worth it. Side note: It was raining cats and dogs that night, so I autopilot locked my keys in the car. The valet came in after us and asked if I had the key. Nope... I told them to just call the locksmith, but later on found out that the valet had his own set of tools. No damage to the lock, so I gave him a handsome tip.

2009-05-26,5.0,Alinea is a great restaurant. It is expensive because it takes a lot of people's effort to make a single course. They even have to hand wash many of those dishes. I think price is justified in that sense.  It was like attending a performance at a theater where each course has a part in telling a story. The first course prepares you for what to come and each course after is related to one another and help each other out to bring the best out of each course. I've enjoyed this aspect of dining here. Each course just disappeared in front of us as soon as they brought it. I screamed for every course. I hope I wasn't too noisy. From a course so delicate to a course so explosive it was like a great concert. The wine pairing was exceptional for the price we've paid. It is amazing what people can do to express and enjoy life. Maybe Grant's this passion for bringing life into his food help him get through the hard time when he had a very serious cancer.

The smaller tasting is plenty of food. I was stuffed, especially with all the bread they bring you - maybe 4 pieces? I was turning the guy away. Enough starch! I want more room for the actual courses. The service is impeccable - light-hearted but informative. Couple next to us was tanked... makes me wonder why you would do that before experiencing such a fabulous meal? Oh well, made for good entertainment.",0.9728,0.813,0.175,0.012,0.5601851851851852
2009-05-04,4.0,"Well, this is a place to save for a night that you truly have time to take in the experience.  I think that the numerous small plates you sample throughout the night are each a little bit like a piece of art. You almost need to study each plate and take time to appreciate the nuances.  That said, I would not show up here starving and hoping for a satisfying meal. If you want that, I'd go out for a nice steak! You'll have to patiently wait for each small mini-course to make its way to your table.  The only reason I gave this restaurant 4 stars is that I thought the somber demeanor of the servers got a bit old. I'm sure they are told to act ""professional,"" and thus they don't crack a smile. I also got really sick of being chased by the servers every single time I got up to use the restroom- apparently customers are not allowed to be troubled with opening the bathroom door by themselves:)",0.8523,0.781,0.141,0.079,0.5943948412698412
2009-05-02,5.0,"Best meal of my life, won't say more because there's plenty said. Regarding previous comment about the wine pairings -- yes, for the 12 course the pairings were mostly whites and only 1 red, but these were some amazing whites.  I'm not a big white wine drinker myself, but after this meal I'm going to start exploring whites because the pairings were genius.  The aromas were absolutely tantalizing and I almost didn't want to drink because I just wanted to keep inhaling.",0.8669,0.873,0.127,0.0,0.4366666666666667
2009-04-27,5.0,"Wow -- I went here and had the 24 course meal.  Holy crap is that a lot of food even though each course is a bite or two. Here's a piece of advice, don't down a bottle of champagne with your friend before you get here -- I made that mistake and was pretty tipsy -- asking the waiter (who I'm SURE hated me) if every course was an 'amuse bouche'.  The food was very unique and delicious.  If I were to go back, I'd get the 12 course -- 24 was way too much for me.  Also, if you don't like white wine (I personally hate it) -- don't get the wine pairing.  Most of it was white wine and therefore I didn't drink most of it.  The decor is really cool and while waiting for my friend to use the restroom before we left I got to watch the kitchen staff running around the kitchen like a well oiled machine.  Love Alinea -- hope to go back soon. :)",0.9718,0.713,0.201,0.086,0.5513888888888889
2009-04-26,5.0,"Plenty of reviews here, so no need to elaborate, but here's my take: Awesome place for event dining, and something that's definitely worth doing once if you can swing it (heck, go once a year or once a season if you're posh). I went with two friends for no reason other than that we wanted to give it a go, despite it being way out of the ballpark for us financially.  We made our reservation, dressed up, and had a blast. We went with the smaller menu (PLENTY of food - I don't think I could have handled the full 24-course option) and just ordered a bottle of wine (sure, we were dropping lots of money, but we were trying to be reasonable) and felt like we got the full experience. Food was wonderful, service was great, and the experience was a big thumbs-up.  My one recommendation to diners is to relax and have a good time. We felt like we were the only ones in the joint enjoying our meal: everyone else was stone-cold quiet and somewhat serious. So have fun, get tipsy, and ask your waiters lots of questions. Once the waiters figured out that we were chatty, they started spending more time with us, sharing a few extra details, and challenging us to identify the main ingredients. It's food -- it's not that serious. And it's food with a sense of humor, so it's REALLY not that serious. Save your pennies, go once, and have fun!",0.9956,0.739,0.219,0.042,0.5207341269841269
2009-04-21,5.0,"The wife and I went to Alinea several months ago, and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  A relative of the wife works there and so we decided we would try it out at some point. We were not disappointed.  From the moment you open the unmarked door, and walk down the hallway, you start to wonder what you're in for.  You open the inner door, and voila, the hustle and bustle of the kitchen greets you from the left, and the staff stand in front of you dressed like they are members of the CSO. We sat upstairs and went with the 12 course plus wine.  The courses were taste sensations.  A thick piece of smoked bacon dipped in butter scotch?  Delicious?  Yes?  Oh yes.  I wanted another one.  The duck with dark chocolate nestled atop the savory duck.  It was by the far the most ambitious flavor combo of the night and it worked.  Lobster foam?   Foam that tastes like lobster but looks like... foam.

2009-04-16,5.0,"I went to Alinea to celebrate?? my 34th birthday with my mom in May 2008. Everything started out great and ended quite badly for me. So my birthday was kind of ruined. Want to know why? Please read on.... I am giving Alinea five stars because this was a dining experience like none other delivered by a staff that if they put their mind to it could save the world from every single challenge this globe is facing. The restaurant is impossible to find from the outside as its entrance is intentionally hidden at the end of a rabbit hole like cave in a typical building like every other on the street. Be on time, this is like showing up to a theater, you have to be at your table at the time of the reservation. Dress appropriately: Men should wear a shirt and a jacket, women should dress up like they're going out. Jeans are probably not a good idea. This is a formal affair, dress like a formal affair. On the other hand, as a proponent of casual clothes and being comfortable while you eat, I would like to recommend that you not overdo it with ties and uncomfortable getups. Be comfortable but sharp looking and you will do fine. Once inside, you're seated at your own table, briefed about the meal ahead, asked about your preferences in terms of refreshments, offered the wine matching option. The restaurant is softly lit, and relatively quiet. Watch out if you have a big voice like I do -- you will have to remind yourself to talk softly. Before making a reservation at this restaurant, please check their website first to see if the ingredients in the individual courses agree with your dietary restrictions. I have seafood allergies, specifically shellfish. If you inform Alinea ahead of time they will make accommodations for you in the course line up. There are two options 12 course meal and 24 course meal. We made the mistake of being over-enthusiastic and picking the 24 course meal with wine pairings. Every piece that was presented to us was unique, delicious, and a work of art in itself. I am sure every other reviewer has attempted to describe the line up and such. I won't go into all that detail here. I HIGHLY recommend first timers to get the 12 course meal. You think you can do the 24 but you're wrong and you have no idea what you're getting yourself into. It's not the quantity of the food that's the problem, it's the number of ingredients. By the time we hit #18, neither my mother nor I wanted to see food ever again for the rest of our lives because the number of ingredients in our tummies was probably about in the hundreds. Take that and mix it with the 12 wines we had tasted by that point and you have yourself one hell of an upset tummy. I literally turned green after #16 which I think was the lobster -- which I have not reacted to before although it is shellfish. So I had a small tiny piece of it. I got very ill in a very short period of time but I assumed it was a temporary thing and that it would pass. I was not about to lose my dinner or anything. But the feeling of something horrible is about to happen never passed. When we hit course #18, I called the wait staff and told them to stop bringing us more food and bring us the bill. They were super nice and courteous about our early departure by the way which made me feel even worse than I was feeling for leaving. We got the check; Alinea was super nice to us with the check, they discounted the courses we did not have, and the wine we did not drink. This was a class act. I was ready to pay the full amount and leave as soon as possible. Needless to say I barely made it to my room at our hotel to find my insides boiling up and refusing to stay in me. I hate to say it but I lost all 300 dollars worth of exotic spices, meats, foliage, vegetables, and beautiful design down the toilet in less than 15 minutes. I was sick for the rest of the night and it kind of ruined my birthday. After this incident things did not taste right for two weeks. Everything tasted salty to me. To this day the smell of peanut paste ( a flavoring that was omni present in almost every we ate at Alinea) makes me throw up a little in my mouth. Ok I kid about that part. :-) Am I complaining about Alinea? No, not one bit. These were a bunch of beautiful, talented, hard working individuals that put on a feast and show for all senses. I think this restaurant helped me realize my dislike for multi course meals and fusion cuisine. So the problem is with me, not with Alinea. Let my story be a cautionary tale. If you have not done this before, proceed with caution, get the tasting menu -- 12 courses and not the grand tour -- 24 courses. Do not get the wine pairings unless you're an experienced wine connoisseur -- as it adds up in terms of volume fast and you end up mixing champagne, white wine and several red wines -- a recipe for disaster for someone like me -- a light light drinker.",0.9645,0.787,0.122,0.091,0.5926058201058202
2009-04-15,4.0,"Unique dining experience mixing art with food: in the decor as well as the actual meal. Tiny bites but big flavors. 4.5 stars. Was holding out on this last Chicago one for my 500th review of my first 15 months as a yelper. 8-) Cost to worth it rating: 3 (~$300/person for 12 course tasting menu, wine pairing, and gratuity)  Eve award: best version of A1 sauce.  Pics:  yelp.com/biz_photos/pbEi… Highlights:  - Atmosphere: upon arriving at the location, the experience begins. The actual door is a bit hard to find, then you walk down a pink lit short hall with no sign of an entrance, only to have the elevator-like doors to the left automatically open up. Part Willy Wonka, part Sci-Fi, and part modern art... kinda like the cuisine. Dining room is very minimalistic, set up as the canvas for the food to come.  - Instruction: it's a step away from the norm when you receive verbal instructions on how to eat the dish when you're presented with each course. Ex. eat the spoon of Thai flavored jelly and then the rest of the plate, pull these things off the pin and let it drop before eating, suck in the cigar shaped tube with 3 layers of gelatin substances to taste like bubblegum, open wide and shoot a big hard-shelled white circle filled with fluid, etc. - Scent: a few plays on this sense in the aroma within the slowly deflating lilac pillow our plate was sitting on top of to the mysterious black vase which later spouted out smoke volcano style that provided the essence of a backyard grill.  - Steak and potatoes: their version was one of the highlights. A small piece of succulent wagyu beef paired with a pureed potato encrusted in salt and vinegar potato chips. The fun here besides the bbq smoke was the deconstructed A1 sauce: they took all the random ingredients that make up this iconic steak sauce and reverse engineered it to recreate it in powder form and presented it in a plastic pouch. This was freaking cool.   - Bacon: slimmest crispiest piece of bacon I've ever had with a touch of sweetness from butterscotch and a sliver of apple tied around it, all presented hanging off of a silver arch we pulled it off of.  - Butter: dish highlighting Paula Dean's best friend. Lobster and popcorn with a jelly cube of enclosed clarified butter.  - Sweet potato: brown sugar cinnamon crispy exterior reminiscent of that fried taro semi-spiny looking ball at dim sum covered the potato on a stick. My favorite sweet.  - Coconut bread: of the 3 breads we tried, this was by far the best. Toast with a bit of coconutty sweetness. - Pork belly: I've never had it before and was a bit scared but the taste was part bacon and part pulled pork. This was surrounded in a Thai curry sauce and eaten after the spoon of Thai flavors of fish sauce, lemon grass, etc. in a clear jelly format.  - Pepper ice cream: I liked ground pepper so this worked for me--even when paired with asparagus.  - Wine: great pairings but even better was the extent of the description that accompanied each pour. Not only did you get the varietal and producer but region and story behind it all. As a wine-lover, I dug this. La Sirena syrah was incredible... the famous winemaker that has received a perfect 100 point from Robert Parker in previous creations and this particular winery is in Napa--yeay!  - Comfy seating: we were upstairs and I sat on the booth side of the table that was so soft, luxurious, and comfortable.  - Service: lots of help, as a different person seemed to expertly present each course to us. They noticed we came in a cab and without us asking, made sure one was waiting for us at the completion of our meal. - Menu: after you're done, they present you with a printed out menu in a folder (including wine pairings), joking that it's your diploma. I was impressed, as the hub's had his non-seafood items included so it was personalized and not just cookie cutter.  Midlights:  - Lengthy process: prep yourself for a 3 hour meal even for the half menu of 12 courses. Get comfy and enjoy. 3 courses actually came at the same time which was nice, as we were getting tired half way through even the shorter menu.  Lowlights:  - After a few tables sat next to us who ordered the full 24 course menu, our main waiter rarely stopped by our table any longer and was more quick to pour our wine and go.  - Chocolate dessert: blanket layer of waxy chocolate covering prune, olive, and pine flavors was not for me.  Interesting experience to say the least. Took a bit of reflection upon the evening to appreciate the extent of it all, but since it was so memorable and I notice myself telling everyone about it, I'd like to do it all again. :-)",0.9987,0.822,0.145,0.033,0.48676268861454053

Sure, there are parts of an Alinea dining experience that are inventive to the point of being wacky, but it's not just for wacky's sake. Every twist, every invention is rooted in respectful consideration of the ingredients--they let the essence come through, and how they do it is really clever and fun. The presentation is like getting to eat art. Tasty, tasty art. And science. The staff is attentive and friendly without being obsequious, removed enough to let you enjoy your meal at your pace, but willing enough to talk smack about wine, food, music, etc. if you are on your fourth glass of paired wine and feeling chatty.

If you're going to Alinea, just do the 24. I wouldn't have been satisfied with 12 courses. I didn't travel all this way to be in and out. Just go for it, and you'll be happy. It was about 3.5 hours. I can't compare this place to anywhere I've ever been. It's a once in a life time dining experience. If you're a foodie, or want a special occasion place, this is it.

Do: plan for a leisurely meal, dress up (there is a dress code), be able (and willing) to forget price for one evening, and build up a healthy appetite beforehand, follow your server's directions (to avoid food disasters - lets just say I had a tapioca accident) Don't: forget to mention food preferences or allergies, be afraid to try new things, expect a single ""main"" dish, choose dinner companions you can't spend three hours straight with (no flat screens or music), memorize the menu beforehand (ruins the surprise) We had the touring menu and chose to forgo the wine pairing (not all of us were big drinkers).  Instead, we ordered champagne to begin and a bottle of red wine for the meal.  I can't begin to describe every dish we ate (some were quite mysterious even now), but a few of my favorites were the roe, foie gras with kimchee, and yolk dishes.   No need to memorize or photograph every dish, you'll get to take home a copy of the menu. The service was attentive and smoothly delivered (without being snooty), the decor was modern and understated, and the experience of exploding, swinging, erupting, melting food is both surprising and delicious.  I won't say this is/was the best meal of my life (mom's home cooking is hard to beat), but it is definitely the most memorable dining experience I've ever had and (in my opinion) worth the cost.

The service was amazing - they strike the perfect balance between being attentive and trying to meet your every need and expectation without somehow smothering and hovering over you. Although, maybe waiting for me to get out of the bathroom to push in my chair was a bit embarrassing. Especially, since I was sidetracked by the Alinea book on my way out. Also as a note to servers: don't get irritated with a customer because they didn't tell you they don't like X when you specifically ask ""Are you allergic to anything?"" How was I supposed to know you wanted to hear about my recent campaign to stop the disgusting overuse of truffle in, on, and around everything in Chicago? I don't use ""allergies"" as an excuse. So how about asking if I have any dislikes or preferences? Food - to be perfectly honest I was rather disappointed. I was happy I had had the ""Alinea Experience"" but was rather unimpressed with the food. There seemed to be far too much of the same textures (aka mushy squares and gelatin squares). The only dishes I would say were good were the pork belly, the bacon - sweet potato -mustard (served as a threesome) and the desserts. I did also enjoy the cauliflower which I almost hesitate to mention since me liking veggies means the rest or your food must be....   Wine - Oh my goodness. Amazing.

2009-03-27,5.0,"Alinea is my first experience on molecular gastronomy. I have to be honest and say that I had low expectations with this type of cuisine since, it's kinda 'freaky' and I thought it was just some commercial invention intended to suck us dry. But I gave Alinea a try after the eventful events I read about Grant Achatz and because this is the top rated Chicago restaurant in Yelp. And boy I was blown away. As expected, there are a lot of unique stuff about the food here that you probably haven't tasted before, unless you've done molecular gastronomy before. All the dishes deliver one way or the other and they were surprisingly very flavorful and on the heavier side, which is fortunately very much to my preference. My favorite would probably be the cauliflower dish. They pureed & cubed it and coated it with 5 different things. I can't remember them now but bacon was one of them. The pork belly with cooked in coconut milk was fantastic too. It wasn't too fanciful and was one of the simpler dish but it was cooked to absolute perfection. One little complain that I concerns the service. Now, the service was very good but I just felt frustrated of the difference in treatment that the other party at the end of the room got. (When I reached the 3rd/4th course, there were only 2 parties in that room). Alinea offers 2 kinds of menu, the tasting (shorter) and the tour (longer); we ordered the tasting and I am 100% sure so did the other party. First, we were not offered a couple of dishes that the other parties were offered. To my anguish, the dish was foei gras and the other one was some candy dessert that I honestly didn't care about. (I'm not a dessert man). When I asked them for an explanation, they gave a very unsatisfactory answer that ""the chef cooked different meals for different tables"" which actually further proved that we were treated differently. Maybe if we had some dishes that the other party did not have, I'd have understand. Secondly, the servant who described their food to them do it in much detail and was definitely someone senior (Had the suit, tie and all that) but the one who described it to us was, how should I say, some random dude. It was not as if there were no other 'senior' waiters available. In fact, as I mentioned, most of them had nothing to do as the restaurants were kinda quiet when we dined. He was also very short in his description and I had to ask him some questions in order to get the full description of the meal. My and my girlfriends are Chinese, and we are young; now I know that there are some stereotypes that may be Asians are cheapskates and young ones wouldn't understand 'complex' food anyway and I can accept that anywhere else but not in a restaurant like Alinea. I DO understand those foods and I expect those guys to explain it fully to me. But after all that, I would still give them 5 stars. Their service was still very good and polite and as hard as it is to accept, I am a supporter of preferential treatment as well. In a business, obviously you'd treat your regular customer differently but damn, it kinda sucked being on the receiving end and this was my first experience.",0.9896,0.827,0.118,0.055,0.4759587163360748

Let me just say this to anyone that is debating whether they should pay rent this month or go to Alinea. Go to Alinea. Let me say this again, forget the rent, fast for a month, do whatever it is that you need to do. Go to Alinea.  Anyone that has any appreciation for this new and exciting form of food/art will love this place. Working in the kitchen of another world famous establishment just up the road I have had a lot of exposure to incredible food, but this was beyond belief. Chef Achatz's mastery of his craft is truly evident in every dish. His ability to stimulate the palate as well as the imagination is awe inspiring.  A final few thoughts:  -Go for the Tour menu. It is worth the extra cost.  -If it is a special occasion make it known. Trust me.  -If you can afford to do so, opt for the wine pairings.

2009-03-22,4.0,"So much has been written about Alinea.  The restaurant is an extraordinary experience, yet I can't give it 5 stars.  I waited a couple of weeks before writing because I wanted to be sure of my impressions.  Fyi - we had the twelve-course meal. What I didn't like so much:  fishy-greasy smell when we walked in.  And overall, several preparations were too salty for my taste.  I was ready to love everything.  But as the evening progressed, I didn't have that blissful ""yum - bring it on"" feeling.  There were too many fried onion slivers as well.  And one dish had a melted butter ball in a clear wrapper - like one of those bath beads you drop in the tub to dissolve -- except this one came with a warning to puncture it carefully so as to not be sprayed with hot butter.  Hmm, dangerous food; interesting. What I liked:  attentive service; comfy chairs (important because you want to spend hours enjoying the meal).  The freedom of not looking at a menu - letting the chef decide what to serve.  Amazing creativity in both food and serving pieces.  Beautiful presentations (the people at the table next to us were snapping photos).  A wine pairing that complemented the food and let us try interesting varietals and vintages. Considering the complexity of the food, it's too bad that saltiness stands out for me.  Although there was a new dish based on rhubarb that was gloriously pinky-red and fun (I skipped the onions).    The dishes were beautiful works of modern art.  So I'm wondering--is it possible to be so complex that something gets lost?  Like using all the colors in the palette and ending up with gray?  I'm glad I went to Alinea.  I'll always remember the unique presentations and the fun evening with my family.  If I'm looking for purely delicious though, I'll choose Tru or Trotters.",0.9937,0.739,0.202,0.058,0.6194980104071013
2009-03-21,4.0,"Framing: My partner and I went to Alinea for our 10th Anniversary. This was a special occasion so we opted for a special restaurant.  The final bill was around $700 including a 13 course tasting menu with wine. Arriving at the restaurant, initially we thought we had the address wrong because it is about as nodescript as they come. Walking in, however, we were transformed into a truly magical experience with decor that was stupendous. We had the 13 course tasting menu and enjoyed every minute of it. The presentation of each course was amazing and the food really good. If there is one thing both of us questioned, it was the sheer volume of pureed or ""foamy"" foods. I did get a feeling much of what we were eating was prepared earlier, which is a bit disapppointing. Service was better than I expected. I can afford, thank God, this kind of restaurant and pretty much any restaurant in Chicago. Yet, I don't feel I have to act like I can, nor do I feel the servers must be snobby to make me feel special. I KNOW this is a special restaurant and I know that only certain people can afford it. But SOME (not all) of the staff were a bit pretentious. Could they afford to eat there if they did not work there? My particular server was really good, and I liked the fact that the entire staff worked together to ensure your meal was always moving. After the meal, we took a peak into the kitchen with our waiter and about a week later we received an autographed copy of our menu, which really meant a lot to us. Would I go here again? Probably - maybe for 15th Anniversary.  Would I take friends? Not likely. I would rather have a nice dinner at a reasonably priced restaurant with friends where I can treat the whole crew for the price of one meal at Alinea. Great food. Great ambiance. Great service.

2009-03-19,5.0,"After my first dinner at Alinea, I wrote the following in my dining notes: ""I just got back from the longest meal I think I've ever eaten."" Alinea is another hot new Chicago restaurant offering immersion in post-modern cuisine. There's a (no longer) recent review that actually highlights a lot of the cuisine that I sampled that night -- and sampling it was, as we went for the ""tour,"" which that night was a 26-course tasting menu that lasted five hours. It was worth the hype and every penny, however; it's simply a phenomenal place. Many courses were ""really good"" or better; the consistency was unexpectedly high throughout the entire meal. Perhaps my favorite course was squab in mushroom soup with foie gras foam, the extra details of which I could not recall at this moment I wrote the review up (it was simply too difficult to keep in my head; unlike moto, there are no printed menus from which to pull notes, and I didn't keep a notebook with me through dinner). I've been a fan of Grant Achatz's since his tour at Trio in Evanston; as seems to be the pattern (set perhaps by Rick Tramonto and Gale Gand when they went off to start Tru), a fair number of the highly-skilled waitstaff there were from the old days of Trio. Service was precise and elaborate; the room was modern and gorgeous -- the entryway is simply amazing in and of itself! Although the food did not peak at the levels that moto peaked at, I felt it was more consistent (though not due to a lack of experimentation and risk) and still ended up placing Alinea as one of the five best restaurants in Chicago today. (If you're looking for the other four in my highly-subjective, highly-opinionated, ephemeral list: Moto, the Dining Room at the Ritz-Carleton, Charlie Trotter's, and Les Nomades.) Yes, $175 is a hefty price for a tasting menu -- but what a tasting menu! It's also perfectly in line with the other new stellar greats in the US, such as per se in New York, and is in fact perhaps ""a deal"" when compared to Alain Ducasse's restaurant at the Essex House or many of the stunning French restaurants or Michelin three star restaurants out there. The bottom line? If you are a lover of exciting, dynamic, and post-modern cuisine (and live in the Chicagoland area) -- make a reservation (which you'll need to do well in advance) and go. The next spring, on April 5 (my little personal historical marker of terrestrial position with respect to the sun), we went back. That time was notable in two extra ways: first, I did the wine flight along with the tour; second, I got a copy of the menu to take home as a keepsake (a little thing I like to do sometimes -- call me sentimental, I guess). So I figured I'd just share the menu and review it as best as I could remember (bearing in mind that I was already up past my bedtime and was barely staying awake even as I type this), before too much time passed and I lost the thread of it entirely. I was far too tired that night to attempt such a herculean feat. Even with memory fading, it took all the free time I had over the course of two four days. [Yelp has a 5000 character limit, so I had to erase the dish-by-dish review from here.] In short, was this the best meal I had ever had? Absolutely not. I have had meals of pure perfection at Charlie Trotter's and Daniel's. Was this in the next level down? Absolutely. It's a great experience, with some stellar, amazing, wonderful, exceptional food, and some incredibly good dishes. (And one stinker that second time.) Was it worth the $175 tour price? Absolutely, if you're into the finest kind of dining adventure. Was the wine flight worth it? Yes, but only on special occasions (but then, I don't drink much any more anyway). In this case: absolutely. A memorable meal, a nice evening, a gorgeous room and building. Oh, and as opposed to last time: this one only took four hours. Record time! I could have written more, or found more links for the wines, or any number of things, but it had already taken a week, and I felt like if I take any more time, it might never get out. So: I'd love to hear specific questions or feedback; leave comments, and I'll respond in kind.

2009-03-18,4.0,"I want to say before I start (in bucking the 5-star trend) that Alinea was very very good. But to be perfectly honest, it could have been better, and this is why we have four stars. I want this to be 4.5, becuase it really was good. But alas, I can't. Of note - crazy serving pieces that almost overshadow the meal at times. We had lavender pillows and a dry ice scent ""vase"" to help complement some courses. Aside from that, a lot of things have already been covered, but my highlights:  The hot potato/cold potato is awesome. A great, inventive, very tasty way to start the meal. So rich, and the hot/cold mixes very well. Wild striped bass with a very nice celery flavor was light and also very very good. The black truffle ""explosion"" was also excellent - if you didn't know what truffle tasted like, you do now. The highlight of the meal, Wagyu beef (poached, not grilled) was heavenly. Nothing quite like it, and served with a unique deconstructed A1 sauce that made it all the better. Even the potato accompaniment (coated in salt and vinegar potato chips) added to the fun. Finally, the rhubarb desert was inventively served on a lavender scented pillow. Aside from the crazy serving piece, it was very tasty - I love rhubarb.  Now, the missteps - the entire menu was very heavy on salty/savory and sweet flavors. The only tangy/sour taste was in the salt and vinegar chips served with the Wagyu beef (and, almost forgot, the rhubarb course, which was a welcome change towards the end of the meal. The inclusion of some onion in that course made things slightly odd, though...), and only spicy flavors the tiny dot of chili paste served with the pork belly lettuce wrap. So, while what we got was very good, I feel like the palette could have been more rounded. I was starting to get tired of all the salt by the end of the meal - some diners were a little disgusted by it. Some of the courses also pushed the bounds of how salty you'd want something to be...our blood pressure was probably a bit high by the end of the meal.  Remember, I still said it was excellent. If there had been one of those moments where, in the words of a fellow diner, my whole mouth was singing, I could give it 5 stars. But it never came.  Service was excellent, sommelier either extraordinarily knowledgeable, very well rehearsed, or an unbelievable BSer (all of which earn him equal points from me). Aside from lots of prattling on about grape varietals and whatnot, the service almost managed to be unpretentious, hard to do in this setting. Some jokes, etc. The one thing I noticed, and I'm not sure why this matters, was that the women in our party were usually not served first. It seems the polite thing to do at a formal dinner where you're paying an egregious amount of money. I guess after Tru (where this was the case) I expect high manners to be on display.  We were out for my aunt's birthday...and guess who got their champagne cocktail spilled on them by a waitress. They offered to pick up the dry cleaning tab, but some of us felt they should have offered to reduce the check by some amount as well/instead. They were quick to replace her chair, etc. The waitress was absolutely mortified, so it wasn't that they weren't apologetic.  I cannot help but compare this to Tru, my high water mark for Chicago dining. And when it all comes down to it, while these were very different kinds of meals, I cannot help but say I would rather have eaten at Tru for less money. I need to go back to Tru and see if it's as good as I remember.  One last thing - the bacon course featured very crispy bacon. I cannot help but think that had it been a little chewier, and perhaps a little fresher from the pan (it had grown a tad cold) my review might be better? Note to fancy restaurants - buy 5 stars from me with bacon.",0.9989,0.79,0.18,0.03,0.6261728395061728

Yes, could have spent the money on a year's worth of groceries, but am perfectly content with the decision to blow it on 24 courses here.  It's a 3 hour plus experience of impeccable, impossible-to-replicate flavors and service, all worthy of the hype. Dishes served on aromatic lavender pillows that deflate with each bite. Nuclear butter balls the size of pennies that erupt with a puncture, perfectly saturating nearby lobster. Explosions of black truffle, which, if you ignore the instructions of eating with your mouth closed, have superhero potential to careen out of your mouth at high speeds and decapitate others. And bacon, bubble gum, wagyu, foie gras, bass, and much much more taken to sublime levels of culinary genius and creative mastery. Did the wine pairing, which was also a gift for the birthday boy. Our goal was to be wildly drunk when the bill came. Sadly, 24 courses have the uncanny power to absorb endless wine, so this did not happen.

The place is quite, you feel like you are in a library, and the servers while very prompt and professional seem very hesitant to chat or even mildly socialize with you, and seem to me like they were being watched by some secret cameras, to be later judge and fed to the lions if they had steered away from their routine.

2009-03-10,3.0,"3 stars?!?!?  Am I crazy???  Nope, there's a reason...I'll get to it. Overall, I had an amazing experience.  It really is just that--an experience, an event.  4 hours with the most creative food I think I'll ever see in my life.  For instance, I don't think I've ever needed to be instructed on how to eat each course of a meal before!   But before I get to the food, let me just say that the ambiance was incredible.  Even just walking into the front door, the hallway looks as if it narrows and shrinks, just like in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.  Before you get to the end, this magical door whooshes open and you enter the most beautifully lit room.  Soft purples, reds, and blues appear to creep up the walls.  It's immediately calming and exciting at the same time. We did the full tour.  The sommelier recommended (of course) that we do the wine pairing, but at 3/4 the cost of the full-tour, there was just no way I could swing it.  So, we opted for wines by the glass.  I felt as though my choice was not so subtly disapproved of, but no further discussion ensued.  We started immediately with the Hot Potato/Cold Potato, and that was one of the most incredible things I've ever tasted, not to mention the little contraption it is upon arrival.  I won't go through all the dishes, but will hit the highlights.  I thought the pear bite with olive oil and pepper was incredible.  It was presented in a bowl full of eucalyptus, and inhaling while eating the pear was heavenly.  The waygu beef was delicious, but it was just the coolest to have the aroma-dry ice-thing accompany the yumminess in my mouth.  The sweet potato on a smoldering cinnamon stick was just unbelievable, as was the bacon on a wire.  I almost died with the lobster and popcorn cream and the Iberico ham dish, which allowed the ham to begin almost melting over hazlenut deliciousness. The service was impeccable and I really appreciated that they were not pretentious or judgmental.  They joked around and seemed to truly revel in the concoctions they were bringing to the table. So, why 3 stars?  Well, with just a few dishes left, I found a hair in my dish.  The waiter was very apologetic and, both full and a little grossed out, I declined a replacement dish.  Another waiter promptly appeared and asked me if he could ""do anything else.""  This was an incredibly awkward moment, as I sure didn't want more food after 20 something courses, but did hope they would offer some sort of gesture to make up for the hair.  He asked again what they could do and I realized they were putting me in the position of requesting a discount or some other accommodation.  I declined, as I felt awkward and figured they would take care of it in some way, as this didn't feel like the kind of haggling I should do in such a nice establishment.  Well, when the check came, there was no reflection of the hair and it was, in essence, ignored.  It felt too weird to raise the issue at that point and, frankly, ridiculous that it was on me to take care of it.  So, we paid.  My friend left angrier than me and stated she would not return because of this.  I'm still enamored with the rest of the experience, so I'm sure (if I could afford it), I'd be back.  But, it did leave a not so positive impression, overall.",0.9933,0.807,0.129,0.064,0.6055761698618843

Very innovative, outside-the-box cooking; the best part about Alinea is that the extensive detail and culinary technique that goes into the dishes are designed partly to make you think about an experience food in a unique way, but more so to create flavors that are astonishing.

This is for two reasons: one, flawless execution of the meal (in taste, service and the creation of atmosphere); two, it made me a believer about a type of cuisine (experimental) that usually underwhelms me. My husband and I shared the 12 course meal with wine pairings, and they were gracious enough to pour me a smaller amount so I would be able to remember dessert AND it was reflected in the bill. Nice. Some standouts from our meal where the hot potato/cold potato, the kobe beef with powdered A-1, the alaskan king crab and the black truffle explosion (which was essentially an Italian shanghai dumpling).  Every course was incredible and the wine pairings were thought-provoking, particularly a Spanish sherry that was much more sophisticated than most I have tasted. If I had to pick a bone or two: the chestnut dish was my least favorite, a bit cloying and just too much AND I felt that there were too many dessert courses (this is saying a lot for I generally have an insatiable sweet tooth). But ending a large meal with all that sweet kind of put us over the edge, particularly because the last bite was a bit of fried sweet potato pie!

Anyway, my boyfriend took me here for my birthday and it was perfect for the occasion.  Alinea is definitely one of those places that the dining experience is so unique and overwhelming that it almost overshadows the food.  Don't get my wrong though, the food is super unique, innovative and delicious but I think what really made it memorable was the intrigue of waiting for the next course (they like for their 10-course meal to be a surprise so you don't know what the next course is going to be) and acting like food critics (more like trying to figure out what we were eating) with my boyfriend as each course came along.  You get a lot of courses (10 or 15 depending on which one you choose) and they come in small portions - each course is quite heavy though so I was pretty full 2/3 of the way through.  Some courses were better than others but they were all consistently delicious.  If you don't want to get the wine pairing option, you can order wines in smaller portions to sample and pair with the different courses.  The servers were very professional - not exactly the type that makes you feel super comfortable - but they were knowledgeable and attentive. Unlike a lot of restaurants in Chicago, Alinea has a very roomy dining room.  Tables were spaced out far apart from each other so conversation never clashed from table to table.  The decor is modern but elegant, chic but not overly trendy.  It wasn't anything super special but the vibe fit well with the food. At the end of dinner, they brought out 2 truffles and a cup of hot liquid chocolate - they poured the hot chocolate on the truffles to ""unwrap"" it, as a way to wish me a happy birthday.  It was a nice touch. I'd highly recommend Alinea for an occasion or celebration - it's just not one of those restaurants you'd go regularly (not only because of how expensive it is, but the value-added of the whole experience would decrease exponentially if visits are overly frequent).",0.9976,0.783,0.2,0.016,0.6154043126684636

And so, with no gift certificates or special favors, we celebrated that fact by making the trip to the holy grail that is Alinea to celebrate our one year anniversary last last December (i.e. December 2007). It was fucking heaven in a plastic straw doused with white truffle oil and infused with juniper scent. We now live in New York and I'm still getting familiar with the food scene here but I can say with some confidence that no restaurant here will replicate what we experienced at Alinea. The service is top-notch. There are about 5 or 6 people that attend to your table and if you're like me, self-deprecating to a nasty fault and self-resourceful to the max, you will feel silly at first having so many people attending to you. But, advice: Indulge in the pampering. You are, after all, paying for it. Note: They give you a menu at the end of your meal displaying every indulgence you stuffed down your gullet. Note: Opt for the 24-course tour. Doy. Note: You will be full. Disgustingly, delightfully full. Note: Should you decide on the 24-course tour, your dinner WILL take 5 hours. Note: If you close out the restaurant, they may let you into the kitchen before you leave so you can meet the wondrous chefs who created the works of magic you took seconds to suck down.

The list of ingredients used included arctic char caviar, king crab, waygu beef, and iberico ham.

2009-02-01,5.0,"Alinea is deservedly highly-praised.  They do shorter (around 12 - 14 courses / 2 - 3 hours) and longer (around 22 - 28 courses / 4 - 6 hours) tasting menus.  For me, it was more about the experience than the food and Alinea definitely lived up to the expectations set by its 5-star Yelp rating.   Food: I had the 26-course tour with wine pairings and while it was tasty and artistic, I was in a food coma for a day or two after!  I probably should have gone with a shorter tour.  As some other reviewers have noted, the focus at Alinea is on the experience first and the taste second, which isn't to say the food is less than great but, with 26 dishes, some are much better than others.  Chef Grant Achatz and his excellent kitchen staff play with texture, color, scent, and taste and deconstruct and reinterpret more common dishes.  The menu, which changes regularly, often features interesting and surprising combinations (lamb and chocolate, or bacon and candy).  They take full advantage of the large number of dishes to make the eater interact with the food in different ways (eat meat off a wire; suck mousse from a tube or liquid from a sphere).  The result is a fun culinary voyage.  Side note on the wine pairings: wow!  Dinner for two, with wine, was around $900.  4 stars.   Service: The wait staff is extremely attentive and when engaged became quite friendly, which made for a better experience.  I left after 1 AM, after a five hour meal, and think there were two or three waiters devoted to my table for the last few hours.   Also, they give you a copy of the menu to help you remember it all!  5 stars. Decor: Relatively open and airy and spread out over two stories.  For some reason Alinea reminded me of a nice but cold home.  I sat upstairs in a room a bit too quiet and private for my taste.  Definitely spend a few minutes in the kitchen, watching masters at work.  4 stars.

2009-01-30,3.0,"I know that everyone seems to be completely enamored with Alinea.  It was certainly a memorable experience.  Probably the most expensive, memorable experience that I never care to have again.   It was incredibly innovative, many dishes were flavorable and absolutely everything is done with the kind of focus and attention that you would expect from arguably one of the best restaurants in the nation.  But I do not care to do this again. My parents were in town and I wanted to share something really special with them, so took them to Alinea.  Wanting the occaision to be a truly grand experience, we all had the 25 course tasting menu with the sommelier wine pairings.  With tip, the bill was over $1,800 for the four of us. Perhaps my feelings about the restaurant would be somewhat different if we hadn't all signed up for the 25 course tasting menu.  Even though the courses were tiny - 25 is too much - it was ridiculous.  Half way through the meal I just wanted to be done.  I actually thought we were done, but it kept on coming. . . The novelty of having cheese made into frozen foam, holding bizarre spheres filled with some sort of liquid in your mouth, eating food off of a suspended piece of wire without your hands, slurping duck liver mouse through a plastic straw, or sampling a perfect piece of beef that is under an impossibly thin piece of Guiness gelatin just wears off after 5 hours of sitting.   To me, it all boils down to the experience with duck mole.  The previous evening, we had all dined at a little gem of a place called Mixteco, where I had had the duck mole.  Simple, elegant, and perfect at Mixteco.  The duck was rare, the mole was rich but not overpowering - it was simple in presentation and I loved every bite.  Contrast that to course number. . .17 or 18 (I lost count), we were presented with Alinea's version of a duck mole:  a large bowl filled with various nuts and spices was presented, inside it was another vessle with the food we were to eat (the larger bowl was meant to simply provide the smells and aromas of a mole, not actually to be eaten).  In the small vessle, I dipped my spoon into something that was the texture of mouse - I think it was duck liver mouse (which there seemed to be an over-abundance of on the menu), there was some sauce that was supposed to be a mole, it was mildly bitter, thin, and uninspiring.  I just couldn't finish it.  In my mind I kept on thinking that the original duck mole dish from the night before was perfect.  To molest the duck and fuss with the traditional spices and manipulate it all in a texture that I normally associate with dessert was just wrong.   To this day my Dad still jokes about going back to Alinea and ""having some foam with Alligator eyeballs.""  (there were no alligator eyeballs, but there were some strange spheres with liquid at one point that pretty much resembled eye balls). What you will get at Alinea will be a totally memorable experience, there's no doubt about it.  The service is impersonable, if incredibly timed and attentive impeccable.  If you go, try the smaller menu - you and your stomach (and your wallet) will be happy you did.",0.9572,0.832,0.097,0.071,0.6391723356009068

Alinea was definitely at the top of our list and quite honestly, the main reason for our adventure. For several years, the two of us have been talking about Chef Grant Achatz as if he was the second coming--so I have to admit, I was a little afraid that after all the hoopla we created in our minds, we would be terribly disappointed with the whole experience. Thankfully - this was not the case.  Our visit to Alinea definitely ended up being a unique dining experience and one that I will share with anyone willing to listen. I would honestly dine here regularly if I lived nearby...monthly perhaps ...and you laugh? I'm dead serious!

For a split second, you stand there wondering where to go next and then a sliding door magically opens up into the restaurant. Sweet...nice touch Chef Achatz!! You are immediately whisked away to where you will spend the rest of the evening on the edge of your seat. We unfortunately went with the tasting menu instead of the full but nevertheless, it was again..the best dining experience one could ever have.  With every single item that came to our table, it continued to take the dinner to a whole new level. Each time, it just blew us away. We were so pleased with everything. I took 40 or so pictures and was bummed to discover that I left my camera in the cab.  boo hooo... I vowed to make reservations at the restaurant every single time I'm in Chicago.

My party and I went with the 12 course and wine pairing route, plus a few other bites here and there.  The most memorable dishes for me were the Wagyu Beef with maitake, smoked date and ""Blis Elixir"", which literally melted in my mouth, and the Short Rib with Guinness, peanut and Fried broccoli, which is a bit like a gourmet version of a Beef and Broccoli dish from your local chinese joint.   The two dishes that were the least pleasing to me were the ones that contained chocolate.  The first being the Duck, Chocolate, Blueberry and Thai Pepper and the second being the Chocolate, Blueberry, hazelnut, and Thai Pepper.  Yes you read that correctly, duck and chocolate, but not the chocolate you are thinking of, this is purely unsweetened chocolate, the kind that leaves a really sour taste in your mouth.  This sourness really made it hard to enjoy or even taste the rest of the ingredients in this dish.  For dessert, we were served a variation on the same theme but with hazelnut replacing the duck and chocolate that's sweetened.  Although creative and artsy this dessert really lacked the oomph that makes a meal go out with a bang.

I loved hearing the story behind the wine selections and the wonderful descriptions of the food offerings.   Wine - What an experience!  The wine pairings are so well thought out and added another dimension to the experience.  Most were obscure selections which only added to the mystique.   Food - The food was edible art.  The tastes were like music, so much depth and complexity but all in perfect harmony.  There were creative pairings, wonderful and unexpected shapes and textures, and most interestingly, the use of complimentary scents to enhance the tasting of the foods.  This was a full blown Wagner opera of food. Honestly, this place tickled my soul. I've been to a lot of restaurants that were highly rated but turned out to be all hype.  For me, Alinea exceeded my most optimistic expectations.    I think a second visit will be even better, since there won't be as much sensory overload and hopefully I can better appreciate and understand the experience.  I can't wait to return!",0.9986,0.734,0.252,0.014,0.6074489795918366

I thought I had walked into Dr. Evil's underground lair - and then the big silver electric powered, motion sensor door opens into what seems like a mass of staff waiting to serve you.  Look to the right and you will see the open kitchen beaming with 22 chefs who will be responsible for 90% of your experience that night. My coat was taken right away and our valet ticket was taken note of.  I was wearing a tube top so was very happy that the temperature in the restaurant was very comfortable.  Start to finish, the service was excellent.  I don't think I can even to into the details of the food without repeating what everyone has said but it was delicious.  It was FUN.  I was just starting to get worried that my taste buds were getting bored until I came here.   We had the wine pairing which was excellent.  They offered wines from old family vineyards in Europe, one dating back to 1400's.  Some of the regions I had never even heard of but they were all very good.  I normally like dry reds only but can tell you that I really enjoyed the dessert wines we received. One suggestions is that for the food, ""anything goes"" so ensure that you indicate what you like and don't like when you make your reservation. When I mean, ""anything goes"", we had Artic Roe (delicious, but not for everyone), Sweetbreads (also so yummy). Of the 12 courses, was WOWED by the following: Char Roe: first course of the meal.  Just excellent.  The roe was hand harvested by Grant's buddy.  Arctic roe.  It's come a long way for me to eat.  Flavors of parsnip, licorice (black sphere) and ginger.  Combine all the flavors onto your spoon and take a bite.  So tasty. Cauliflower:  they made cubes of cauliflower puree and then coated them with ham, almonds, cheese and two other kinds that I can't remember right now. it was served with a hot, white soup/sauce what was OH SO DELICIOUS!  The cauliflower texture was so different and amazing. Black Truffle Explosion.  They took on the idea of a chinese soup dumpling (xiao long bao) and made a gelee of soup , truffles, romaine and parmesan and put it in a wrapper that is made mainly of egg yolks.  to cook it, they poach it in butter and the soup inside melts.  We popped the entire thing in our mouth and Mmmm...soupy truffle-y goodness! Hot Potato - alot of fun to eat.  Served in a round bottom wax bowl with a silver toothpick inserted to the side of it.  Pull the toothpick to drop all the elements into the cold sauce and drink it up.  Hot, cold, salty, crispy - all in one bite! I loved all the plates and serveware that they used - I love kitchen stuff so I can appreciate all the well thought out designs.  Alot of the food here is prepared in a way where it ""drools"" sauce once something on your dish is punctured - so the plates are designed with a trough to catch these sauces before they land on your lap.

Being the food crazed person I am, I have read much about this restaurant and have wanted to dine here since we went to MOTO last year. I'm breaking my opinion down into categories.  What we ordered: Tasting (12 courses) and the wine paring.  Atmosphere: Neat entrance (field of view / perspective is deceiving and very cool). Décor was ok (I was downstairs) - kind of plain /simple. There was nothing notable to me other than the amazing view of the kitchen when you walk in.  Service: I thought the service was good- though I was a felt like they rushed through the descriptions of the food. I didn't hear about half of what I was eating or the story behind it. This is what we really liked about MOTO- the story behind the dishes was almost as interesting as eating it. The wine descriptions were much better.  Food: Some hits, some misses. Overall, the food was good - but much more uninspired than MOTO. It felt like they were using a lot of the same themes (I counted 3 plays on hot and cold). There were two ""wow"" dishes- but I expected more in the 12 courses. I love the experimental food- but this just didn't live up to the hype.  Presentation: Beautiful. Even as an industrial designer I was even a bit wowed by the use unique serving pieces.  Wine: Absolutely incredible. This was the savior for me- the wine pairing and choices were amazing.

We had some friends come in town from San Francisco and they were interested in going, so we thought we'd splurge as a special occasion to catch up with them. We were not disappointed!  I was a little disappointed that we could only get a reservation for 6PM for our group because that seemed so early for dinner, but we did not leave until 10:30! It was an all night experience.  We had the Tasting with the wine pairings. One of our group did not enjoy wine, but they were very accommodating and willing to do a pairing of other beverages for them to enjoy. We were a little nervous about only having the Tasting and not the Tour - thinking we would be hungry still at the end of the meal - but none of us were, including the guys!  Not only was the size of what we ordered a concern for me, but I also opted for my meal to be vegetarian and I wasn't sure if anything would be lost in the experience - it most definitely was not! In fact, some of my dishes looked better than the meat eaters dishes! They were creative though and many of the dishes looked exactly the same with creative changes made. Some dishes were more successful than others, but we really appreciated the creativity and presentation of each course. We also enjoyed hearing about all our pairings with the wine. The staff was so helpful and FUN. Maybe it is because we were the youngest group in the restaurant, but they were not the least bit stuffy and they definitely had fun with us. I like the added touch of getting a copy of your menu at the end of the meal. It is great to remember what we had and as a little souvenir of your special evening.  If I had any complaint it was about the book! I knew there was a book available, and I thought it would be a great gift for our friends and for my fiance. Online it said you could order and the Achatz would sign it... when I tried to order online I had no luck, so I called the restaurant. They told me the only way I could have the book signed was if I bought it when I was at dinner. I told them we had only just recently been to dinner there and asked if I could order the signed copy and pay for the shipping and they refused. I thought that was pretty ridiculous! You offer to sell the book online and don't have it set up, but when I offer to pay for shipping after dropping $1500 on a dinner you won't even allow me to pay for the shipping of a copy of the book?

The wine pairing were nice, although I didn't love or agree about every wine.  The dessert wine (which I'll never be able to find) was a highlight.

2008-12-02,5.0,"I'm three years late on this review but I can't help but pile on the praise for this one of a kind restaurant, so here it goes.  I maintain a fantasy to do list that helps me keep track of restaurants, hotels and attraction all over the world that I want to try. Trio in Evanston, IL was on that list but every time I visited Chicago I couldn't justify taking a long cab ride into an area I was unfamiliar with just for a meal. Then one day I read in some travel magazine that Grant Achatz was opening his own restaurant in the city. I was about six weeks out from my next trip to Chicago so I made a reservation.  There isn't much I can say that the 180 reviewers before me haven't already said but I'll put my own twist on the Alinea experience. And forgive me if this analogy is a little crude but I think it works.  Alinea is to eating what a Roman orgy is to sex.  There I said it and I'm going to stand by it.  Alinea is over the top and unlike anything else in the mortal world when it comes to food. Once you sit down in your normal chair at a normal table you will have done the last familiar thing that you typically associate with eating.  Is the food served on a plate or in a bowl? No....well at least it isn't for most course.  Do you eat it with a fork or spoon? Typically not.  Will you eat food in ways you never imagined? Yes. And that is part of what makes Alinea so special.  When I signed up for the 27 course with a wine pairing I expected it to follow a traditional tasting menu. Begin with an amuse bouche, move onto an appetizer or two, soup, salad, fish fowl, beef, cheese, dessert, petit fours, check, pay and goodnight. As each course progresses the wines grow darker and bolder and end with something sweet and syrupy. Not so at Alinea. You are all over the place right out of the gate switching from beef to fish to vegetables to soup. And the wines bounce back from red to white to sparkling to port. And it works. In fact it works so well that I am surprised more restaurants aren't trying to break the mold and copy Mr. Achatz.  The service is flawless and anything but intimidating. Each server is very well educated on the preparation of each dish as well as the origins of the ingredients. Being a total food geek I asked several questions about each course all of which were answered as if I had sent in my inquires prior to my arrival.  Alinea is expensive but if you love food and want to be entertained for four hours in addition to being very well fed it is worth every penny. I'm going back in 2009 and can hardly wait.  In my opinion if you are going to truly experience Alinea you have",0.9966,0.816,0.151,0.033,0.4688591269841271

2008-11-14,3.0,"I went to Alinea for my birthday on November 8. My overall impression is that while it was a very interesting evening and worth the experience, I wouldn't do it again.  There was something about the experience that was slightly sadistic. The insistence by the staff (presumably this is coming from the chef) that so much be eaten a certain way and in a certain order was very controlling. You were punished with dirty looks if you didn't do it the right way. On top of that they played a came of  ""guess what this is"" with several of the dishes and wines. By the end I was purposely giving absurd answers just to see the reaction, which was typically kind of snotty. The point of controlling so much of the dinner seemed to be to craft a particular experience for the whole evening. It was all orchestrated. There was a clear arc and story to it. However, the peak of the experience was in the middle so the final courses, all after the savory courses, were a comparative let down. The sweet courses were a muddle and we left remembering those more than the peak. They were not memorable. I think that was intentional. It seemed they intended the high point to be in the middle, while you are the restaurant, not right before you left and went back to the outside world. Once we finished the last course we ready to leave, but they left us sitting there for a long while. I guess we had been bad. I expected to leave feeling I had been to gastronomic heaven. I left feeling a bit like I had been to the gastronomic equivalent of Club Hell in the Matrix movies. So, if you are in to that sort of thing, go for it.",0.6183,0.849,0.095,0.056,0.3739431913116124

2008-11-03,5.0,"What to say about Alinea? A dinner at Alinea is an intense journey through a world of flavor, texture, and truly artistic presentation. Chef Grant blends flavors in ways you could never imagine. In this process he often creates a dish so unique, so beautiful you almost hate to consume it and would rather simply ponder the complexities of something that is, in essence, nothing more than fuel for your body.  Chef G takes a lot of risks with his food. Some are absolutely triumphant. Hot Potato/Cold Potato and the Ravioli Explosion were both courses highlighting the unparalleled decadence of black truffle (other than maybe white truffle). Also a cold foie gras/crabapple morsel blew my mind. But as stunning as Chef G is in his successes he was equally abysmal (albeit only 2 out of 25 courses) in his failures*. One example features a delicate piece of cobia suspended above a smoldering cedar shaving, the smoke of which permeates the air around the table after the lid to the bowl is removed during presenatation. The cobia has been flavored with the not-so-subtle flavors of tobacco and radish in addition to having been saturated by the smoke. The flavor was something I have come to describe as ""Bitter Campfire Charcoal"". And this is coming from a guy who orders his steaks ""rare+ charred"".  Taken as a whole however, this meal was spectacular and whimsical. 4+ hours flew by and when dinner was over I found myself ready to plop down another $1000 so my g/f and I could do it all over again (although this may have had to do with the generous wine pours throughout the 25 courses). And if you're going to go to Alinea on a budget - don't. Do yourself a favor and put away the extra $'s so you can spluge for the full tasting menu and premium wine pairings. In my humble opinion you won't regret it.",0.9583,0.855,0.104,0.041,0.6287273242630386

I LOVED the food.  Some of it was really good, some of it blew my mind.  There was a soup that made me laugh while I was eating it... it was so fun to dig around and try the different tastes, textures and temperatures.  We also did the wine pairing, which was wonderful too.  The sommelier knew his stuff, and told us the story behind each bottle as he was pouring it (note that this was primarily because we showed interest... i don't get the feeling that he would have forced this on unwilling listeners). My only negative was the price.  The short tasting was $145 per person, plus $110 more for wine, and tea & coffee at the end were $6 each.  The whole thing, including tax & tip, was about $700 for the two of us. Yeah, $700.  I'm not sure anything is worth that.  Think about what you can buy for $700.  But clearly, people are willing to pay that amount.  And it was fabulous stuff, beautifully and whimsically presented without crossing the line to ridiculous (no pop rocks or smashed corn nuts and the use of foams was quite restrained).

I took my boyfriend for his birthday and we were amazed by the attention to detail each server provided. They were so precise with every movement we were initially a little on edge...did we belong here? My boyfriend made a comment about the white sauce on the plate only to realize it wasn't a sauce...it was the plate. The shiny, white, glistening plate that was clearly so perfect he mistook it for a sauce. I replied to the waiter that my bf wasn't used to seeing plates so clean and that immediately broke the ice...they liked us - they really liked us! The service was impeccable - down to a piece of bread which had somehow fallen from my plate to the table but was so unworthy of a hand to pick it up they came back with utensils to scoop it up and take it away!

2008-10-13,5.0,"I saved the best for last as I am writing up all my reviews after returning from my Chicago trip tonight. Alinea was THE restaurant I've longed to go for some time now. Finally I made it out this past weekend with my friend who was willing to fly all the way to Chicago just to eat at all these wonderful places with me even if she's pregnant! Last year she took me to Manresa (currently one of my favorite restaurants) for my birthday and this year it's Alinea. Yes, I have the best friend in the world that spoils me wayyyyy toooo much! I don't know how I'm going to outbeat this night when it's comes time for her birthday next year.  We got there early and they happily seated us to our tables upstairs. I was all smiles because I was so excited.  This was the most unique experience I've ever had - one of molecular gastronomy. eehhh?? what is that? It means ""scientific discipline involving the study of physical and chemical processes that occur in cooking"" Every dish was creative and complex. We were impressed with the imagination and the detail that were delivered in each of the 14 courses. Yep, 14 courses. Thank god we didn't do the 22 courses because I felt like my stomach was going to burst at the end of our experience.  One must be open to eating anything and everything, and appreciate the flavors to truly enjoy this restaurant. 1. Trout Roe with coconut, hyssop, passinofruit - sweet, spicy, salty 2. Tomato with basil, mozzarella, olive oil - tomatoes came in different forms (hydrogenated, jelly, etc) with a icy foamy mozzarella with cubed balsamic vingear jelly. 3. Cauliflower with five coatings, three gels, apple - this is a seasonal dish. There were 5 custard like cauliflower cubes.  Each coated differently (parmasean, almonds, bacon, don't remember the rest). But you really have to use your palate to distinguish each one. 4. Lobster with popcorn, butter, curry - yummy but a little too rich especially if you pop that butter balloon which my friend did =) 5. Wagyu beef from Japan with maitake mushrooms, smoked date and Blis Elixir - this was my favorite. It was so flavorful that it kept me wanting more. 6. ShortRib with Guiness, peanut and friend broccoli - this was a big dish and we were only half way through our menu.  7. Hot potato with cold potato, black truffle and butter chives - it was a generous portion of truffle. This was my friend's favorite dish. 8. Lamb with potato, sunflower, sweet spice - whew, last of the savory dishes  9. Concord grape with yogurt, mint and long pepper - the big ball was in a shot glass which we had to open wide. The big ball cracks in your mouth and oozes out. My friend almost choked on this one.  10. Watermelon with fresh coriander, tamari and bonito 11. Bacon with butterscotch, apple and thyme 12. Pumpkin with gruyere, Blis maple syrup - this was cool. We ate this over a pillow of smoke so it's like your eating a smokey dish. 13. Chocolate with fig, olive and pine - oh boy, we can't eat anymore but we manage to eat it because it's so good. *** Birthday chocolate ball **** 14. Dry caramel with salt - dried flakes of caramel that becomes chewy in your mouth. Finally, we made it through our meal. I didn't even mention the breads which accompanied some of the courses, such as the napa cabbage fennel bread or the oolong tea black sesame seed bagel.  We should get a prize for getting through the finish line though we were quite impressed with the couple behind us finishing up a 22 course menu.  Alinea also serves a very nice range of teas - one which was a imported 1947 tea that cost $95 for a cup of tea! holy cow! At the moment, Alinea, Manresa and Joel Robuchon (Tokyo - Ebisu Garden location) are tied on my restaurant list.  I think if Alinea served less rich dishes it would be the top of my list. We're already talking about our next trip in the near future to El Bulli (Spain) and Fat Duck (UK - I couldn't get a reservation when I was there this past August so next time I have to call exactly 3 months in advance) which both serve molecular gastronomy cuisine.

I can say without question that Alinea as a ""total package"" was the best restaurant I've ever been to and it was the best dining experience I ever had. As a restaurant, the design immediately puts you off balance when you enter the door and walk down an eerily quiet, narrow corridor in mauve hue and then suddenly to your surprise, like in a carnival funhouse, a sliding door quickly opens to reveal the front foyer. You immediately get a view of the bustling kitchen which is so clean it makes a hospital operating room look dirty. There is no separation between servers and chefs. All are hurrying in and out of the kitchen like worker bees on a mission. The decor of the restaurant is one like I've never seen before; multi-level and modular as if out of a geometry textbook or Frank Lloyd Wright unrealized blueprint. The service staff is a well oiled machine. There was not one misstep the whole night. The service was on the level of Pierre Gagnaire in Paris, like a ballet. Only, in Alinea's case, the catering was at a level inspired from love rather than obligation. We selected the lesser menu, but they honored a couple of requests that I made from the tour menu. Right out of culinary school Chef Grant Achatz studied at Thomas Keller's The French Laundry and then later at Ferran Adria's El Bulli in Spain. What makes Grant Achatz so great is that he has perfected the ability to completely marry the cutting edge molecular gastronomy school equally with the classic French technique making an end product that is an evolution to avant-haute cuisine. Ferran Adria of El Bulli tends to weigh more heavy on the technique and takes away from actually creating ""dishes"". Wylie Dufresne at WD-50 offers a more traditional preparation with an ""influence"" from the molecular school. Everything we tasted this night was undeniably ""food""..not just a lab experiment that was unidentifiable by sight or smell. The juxtapositions of flavors were sheer genius and the presentations completely innovative unlike I had ever seen before.

2008-09-29,5.0,"Wow, what a beautiful restaurant. I've been wanting to eat here since I read about it two years ago in some magazine. After many talks about possibly going to Chicago for this much awaited event, the opportunity finally arose for us to go and experience the much anticipated Alinea. We called a comfortable two months beforehand to set our reservation and were all set for a 9:30 pm dinner, just one day after we ate at another molecular gastronomy joint, Moto (review coming). We took a cab from out hotel to this fairly non-descript restaurant, almost missing it on the way. As you open the door, all you see is a thin corridor. As we walked forward hesitantly, the automatic metal door on the left opens to reveal the interior of this carefully thought out restaurant.  The pristine kitchen is on the right. You are able to peak in and see the chefs working their magic. We were seated upstairs, right next to a group of four that we saw the previous night at Moto. No recognition was exchanged, but crazy that we would see another group eating at these two restaurants back to back as well.  There is no menu here, just a wine list. You are at the mercy of the chefs. What they create, you eat. We ordered the full tour menu, no allergies... we were ready to get this started. As the waiters deftly moved around the dining room, preparing their guests for their next entree, our waiter placed a small silver circular plate in front of each of us. We looked at it intently trying to figure out what to do with it. We didn't have long to wonder as the waiter placed a wire instrument with a vanilla bean in the center. These surprises would continue the rest of the night as we took our adventure on the Tour Menu: 1- Steelhead Roe - coconut, cilantro, vanilla fragrance  2- Lemongrass - oyster, sesame, yuzu  3- Tomato - basil, mozzarella, olive oil  4- Cauliflower - five coatings, three gels, apple  5- Yuba - shrimp, miso, togarashi 6- Chicken liver - bacon, caramelized onion, vin santo 7- Watermelon - fresh coriander, tamari, bonito 8- Oxalis pod - sweet, hot, sour, salty 9- Short rib - guinness, peanut, fried broccoli 10- Hot potato - cold potato, black truffle, butter 11- Lamb - potato, sunflower, sweet spice 12- Concord grape - yogurt, mint, long pepper 13- Transparency - of raspberry, rose petal, yogurt 14- Cobia - tobacco, radish, cedarwood 15- Celery - pork belly, shiso, sudachi 16- Alaskan king crab - popcorn, butter, curry 17- Wagyu beef - maitake, smoked date, Blis Elixir 18- Black truffle - explosion, romaine, parmesan 19- Duck - foie gras, mole flavors 20- Bacon - butterscotch, apple, thyme 21- Strawberry - violet, nicoise olive 22- Dry shot - pineapple, rum, cilantro 23- Pumpkin - gruyere, Blis maple syrup, smoke 24- Chocolate - fig, olive, pine 25- Dry caramel - salt Many hits and very few misses. I wouldn't even say miss, more like just not my taste. Everything looked beautiful and the service was spot on. My favorite dish of the night was the Hot Potato-Cold Potato. But the most beautiful dish of the night was the Short rib with guinness. I would love to return if I am ever back in Chicago. I think it blew away my dinner the previous night at Moto. Well deserved as one of the best restaurants in America.",0.9955,0.852,0.119,0.029,0.5470073891625618
2008-09-28,5.0,"Some people just go to dinner for food and drinks, but I want a complete dining experience and that's exactly what I got at Alinea. Alinea is unmarked from the outside, except for a valet parking sign. Once you walk through the doors, its like entering a fantasy land. The entryway is lit with hot pink lights leading to a steel sliding doors that reveal a sleek, modern but welcoming restaurant. Our table of four had the 13-course tasting menu with wine pairing (about 3.5 hours). Each course was an artistic, incredibly constructed masterpiece that catered to all your senses with varying textures, flavors and smells. The custom-made serving instruments went beyond functional utensils, but were engineering feats in and of themselves. And the creativity that went into each dish was absolutely amazing. One dish  required you to pop a balloon of clarified butter in order to douse your lobster. Another course began with a pillow of smoke. Once the platter was placed on it, the smoke released so you could enjoy the aroma as you ate your meal. The food service was well proportioned and well paced, and the wine pairings were perfection, enhancing the dish or cutting through the flavors as needed.  This dinner was hands down the best meal I have ever had, not just for the food but for the entire experience. One of my dinnermates even said it surpassed French Laundry, often regarded as the best restaurant in the world. All-inclusive Alinea cost ~$300 per person, so this is definitely not everyday affair (although I wish it could be) but if you want to go on a true culinary adventure without leaving Chicago, this is the trip of a lifetime.",0.9968,0.79,0.205,0.005,0.47967836257309954
2008-09-23,5.0,"This is truly a dining EXPERIENCE.  We had a party of 5 and we all opted for the ""Tour"", which was 27 courses.  The other 4 members of the party all have many years of experience within the food/restaurant industry (3 restaurant owners and 1 executive chef) under their belts. From the outside, this restaurant doesn't appear as anything special, as it is situated behind an unmarked entrance.  Upon entering, there's a narrow, dimly lit corridor.  At the end, another door automatically opened, allowing one to enter the restaurant.  The kitchen was full of artists, carefully leaned over the stainless-steel tables, creating their masterpieces.   The service was excellent, which was up to par with what was expected.  They were extremely attentive to the activity of the table, as no course was served until all parties were present at the table.  When one person left the table, it was almost as if everything was to cease.  Their knowledge of everything being served was impressive, as they were able to explain each course served.  The food...a-mazing.  There were certainly some flavor combinations to which I was not accustomed, as each course offered something different, inventive.  These are flavors and ""results"" which have been carefully considered of the fusion created.  The food isn't cooked in the sense that you just taste a blend of everything mixed together.  Rather, you an taste each of the specific flavors involved in the individual course.  The courses were surprising, as some were solid foods, while others were purely liquid, or even simply in the form of foam.  I did manage to taste every single course, which were all delicious, against my stomach's wish to be pushed to its limits.   Highly recommended, as this will open your eyes/palate to food as an art form and more.",0.9897,0.849,0.145,0.007,0.5227901785714286
2008-09-22,5.0,"I don't really need to go into how good the place was or launch into a discourse on molecular gastronomy for that matter; these topics were likely covered in great depth by the other 148 reviewers.  What I do wish to impart upon you, faithful Yelp reader, is that I didn't recognize a single thing I ate at Alinea, and this is what made it great. Most restaurants are adept at giving you what you want, or more appropriately, what you expect.  When you visit Gibson's, you know you're going to wait a half-hour beyond your reservation, that your steak will be charred and tasty, that the big-as-your-head dessert will be free.  You go there precisely for this reason.  McDonald's (on the other end of the beef purveyor spectrum) has enjoyed spectacular international success because they deliver a predictable experience no matter where you are or what time of day it is.  Breakfast is over at 11...people set their watch to it.  The point is that many great restaurants thrive on providing a consistent experience, in line with consumer expectations.  Alinea eschews this maxim with all it's being.  Rather than providing an inviting, warm entrance, you get a down the rabbit hole/MC Escher trippy hallway, leading to a Star Trek sliding door and no discernible hosts table.  Their food does not look like food.   If you eat there while the menu remains the same as it was during my visit, you will stare while a piece of frozen meat hangs in front of you, evoking some walk-in freezer from a discarded episode of Dexter.  Expect lots of foams.   Alinea is the counterpoint to every other restaurant in the world (with a wink and a nod to Hervé This, Wylie Dufresne, Ferran Adria, et al).  Your ears hear ""tomato mozzarella salad"", but your eyes see a mess of white meringue and a bunch of funny-colored cubes of stuff.  Then you taste mozzarella salad and wonder how in the hell that happened.  Repeat this a dozen (or more) times and hope that your appetite for amazement keeps pace with your appetite.  I am a rooster illusion. Also, Chuck Klosterman has graced us with his Advancement theory, which posits that there is a cultural condition wherein a true genius creates a piece of art that 99% of the population perceives as bad.  This isn't because it /is/ bad, but rather because the average consumer is not Advanced and therefore does not understand the underlying genius therein.  Achatz (and Alinea by association) is Advanced because he does not do what is expected of him (California Cuisine), but he also does not do /the opposite/ of what is expected of him (Klosterman fans can refer to IV for more on Advancement theory).  Alinea isn't the opposite of anything; it doesn't ignore the existence of outstanding ""conventional"" restaurants.  It's off in it's own little universe with El Bulli and the Fat Duck, orbiting around some totally different sun that you and I can't see.",0.9497,0.841,0.102,0.057,0.49430335097001765

Service was also very good, like a well-oiled machine.  As soon as we finished a dish, it was promptly removed, and soon afterwards the next course would appear.  Our servers were very knowledgeable of the food and wines.   Many of the courses were really small in portion, but at the end of the night (after 4+ hours), we were stuffed.

2008-08-26,5.0,"Part I: It's difficult for me to write a review of Alinea. One cannot put into words what a meal at Alinea is like. One can share pictures and attempt to describe the meal in words, but neither can convey the depth, artistry, and profundity that is Alinea.  The entrance to the restaurant is unmarked, and when you enter for the first time, you may be surprised--I won't spoil it for you. Don't miss the tactile moving art structure. When you enter, you are immediately greeted by the hostess, who was very friendly. She asks for your name and then you are promptly seated. The restaurant's architecture is stunning: designed by Steve Rugo. Also of note is the interior design, especially the chairs which are the most comfortable restaurant chairs ever designed (Tom Stringer). I am jumping the gun here, but in the same category are the plates and implements (Martin Kastner). Part of the experience at Alinea is how the various sensory aspects of the place play off of one another, and the dishes and implements (avant-garde devices that deliver some of your food and off of which you eat some of the courses) add to the amazing experience. More on this aspect later. Alinea offers two price-fix menus: a 12 or so course called tasting and a 24 or so course called tour. Note that Alinea is not cheap, but ever penny is worth it, I guarantee it. You can find the prices and sample menus on their Web site ( alinea-restaurant.com/in… ). A few things to note: because of it's popularity--it was, after all the top restaurant in the US voted by Gourmet Magazine, 2006--you need to have reservations a few months in advance, so do call. There is a dress code: men need jackets, though I wouldn't say the restaurant is at all stuffy. In an interview with the chef/owner Grant Achatz--who is quickly becoming one of the top chefs on the planet--I learned that Alinea strives to make the dining experience comfortable. So, as you are eating, especially if you feel intimated at first, just relax and prepare for a gourmet experience that you will never have anywhere else. Do you get the sense that I was taken with Alinea? Also, in terms of reservations, you can state any dietary restrictions: gluten free, vegetarian, vegan, fish, etc. So whatever you desire, they will accommodate that desire.  Because you are eating on a fix menu I think the experience is even more profound. You don't have to make any choices, other than if you want the wine pairings and what type of water you would like to drink. Four paragraphs in and I am still on the water. This could be a longer review. How can one describe Alinea? It's not a culinary experience like any other. Some would call it ""molecular gastronomy,"" thought I read that Achatz doesn't like this term. Molecular gastro looks at the artistic, scientific, physical and chemical aspects of food and cooking, resulting in dishes and preparations that you have never had before. A classic example of this is looking at the effect of temperature on the egg. While cookbooks may discuss the key being the cooking time, molecular gastro reveals that the time is irrelevant--the temperature is the key, thus revealing the scientific aspect of the discipline. Harold McGee once described the idea of molecular gastro as ""The scientific study of deliciousness,"" and I think that is an apt way of looking at it. What makes this form of culinary artistry so special is that you cannot do it at home. Yes, you could use xanthan gum to thicken a sauce, but what Achatz and his team are up to is truly a scientific revolution of the kitchen. One example is an ""anti-griddle"" ( cuisinetechnology.com/an… ) that takes food to -30 F. Pretty amazing! If you are interested in the technology, just search for molecular gastronomy on the Internet. Oh, the food! Yes, since the food is based on devices that you have never heard of or seen before, and since it is served on remarkable aesthetic devices, what would you expect. Basically, in a few words, it is as if you have never eaten before. After eating at Alinea I tried to compare it to ever other meal I could think of, and I could not. In culinary terms, Alinea is an undefined term: it simply stands on its own and it pushes all boundaries that can be previously tapped into the semiotic categories: ""food"" and ""restaurant."" It is the culinary equivalent of Jacques Derrida's dismantling of philosophy and literary theory. It deconstructs everything that we have come to know about what goes into our mouth and then it reconstructs our senses at the table. We are told, not with a hammer to our heard as so many restaurants do to our taste, but with a whisper, ""Don't you wish that all food could be this way?""  I had heard from my college's culinary arts professor that Alinea has a guest-to-staff ratio of 15-1, or something like that, and I am still amazed that they can pull off every course and every bread pairing without flaw.",0.9988,0.866,0.126,0.008,0.5092436974789918

2008-07-15,5.0,"My palate can't distinguish between Michelin 2 star vs. 3 star cuisine, but I love alinea anyways. I went for the tour the first time in February 2008 for the one-year anniversary with boyfriend, and again in May 2008 for alinea's 3 year anniversary. Those who think of it as solely a meal are the ones who miss out on the nuances, and take away nothing but a four hour dinner. No - this is performance art, at its finest - edible. There are some unconventional presentations they repeat and alter the composition of: a dish with a waxy ball of some juice that explodes in your mouth, a ""shot"" glass of a mixture, food on a thin wire that involves no hands, a bowl of rich soup that can't be put down until you finish, with a biteful of something that complements on top, a silver pick, etc. It's hard to review all the dishes in one meal, let alone two, in 5000 characters, so I'm just going to review the memorable ones: bad and good. Chicken Skin: truffle, corn, thyme. A one biter, yet underwhelming - texture, flavor, none of it was there. They should take this off, because it felt like an afterthought to me. Sweetbread: cauliflower, burnt bread, toasted hay. I have the utmost respect for Chef Grant, but this dish hit a sour note for me. I hated the hard/crunchy cauliflower. There were these tan and black dots adorning a ""village"" that tasted terrible and enhanced the awfulness of everything else. Presentation was cute, but this dish's flavors and textures stunk with me. Transparency of raspberry, rose petal, yogurt: Tasted like potpourri with the texture of baked saran wrap. not my favorite, obviously. But 3 bad dishes out of 52? Not bad. As for the great dishes: Beans: many garnishes, pillow of nutmeg air. This included a marshmallow and fruit leather, centered around a navy bean puree which was topped with pancetta and a guinness beer foam. Unforgettably rich. Roasted pear: foie gras, candied fennel, sweet spices. It was like a ""cover"" of foie over a buttery soup, and they poured more hot soup to melt it. The tastes were totally harmonious. I've only ever had foie fresh at the foire du paris and so i'm picky about my foie, but I loved this. Caramel corn: *liquified*. Our server's presentation: ""well this is intermission, and what do you get at intermission? caramel corn!"" I'd heard bad things (weird, caramel corn shouldn't be liquified, etc.) It was lovely, smooth and tasted exactly like caramel corn, but the aftertaste was great - not buttery or gross, just faint and light. Wagyu Beef: black trumpets, cedar branch aroma. This bite of beef was SO amazing - I'd fly to Japan for it. Boyfriend insisted that the beans were still his favorite, but when I pointed out it was merely a quantity comparison (i.e. if he had less of the beans and more of the beef) he acknowledged I was right. Ice fish: shellfish, horseradish, parsley. One of my favorites, with fried ice fish (japanese delicacy) sticking up out of a custard of shellfish and horseradish (not at all spicy, very very good) with fried potato - like fish and chips except 34280785723094582 times better. Short rib: guinness, peanut, fried broccoli. Imagine a sheet of guinness - even without it, the braised short rib was amazing. Fava beans: lavender, banana, pecorino - i didn't love this so much as the BACON DONUT that came with it, good lord almighty. Lobster: peas, ramps, mint vapor. This might have been my absolute favorite had it not been for the slightly overwhelming peppermint/spearmint smell. Yet it was ridiculously tasty.  Strawberry: violet, nicoise olive. holy gizmo, quite literally. An everlasting gobstopper mixed with ""willywonka"" technique of the gum that changed flavors in your mouth. I don't even like olives but it was delicious and the layers melded together beautifully. Hot Potato: Cold Potato, black truffle, butter. The server came out and I recognized it from pictures online. ""OOOH it's the potato"" he laughed, ""yes!"" This is such a signature dish and after tasting it, I know why. One of those few duets that complement each other in every way possible. Temperature, texture, taste - all kicked ass, and the parmesan cubes were wonderful. Chocolate: egg, pomelo, smoke. Our favorite dessert, hands down. a pool of pomelo, some valhrona chocolate infused with tea, a chocolate brioche bridge, a funky chocolate covered egg and smoke gel. With 20+ dishes being served at a meal, a few may not strike your palate perfectly, but it's definitely worth the trip. Chef G and Co. mess with tastes in completely unconventional ways and it is incredibly fun.",0.9987,0.744,0.179,0.076,0.6206478174603174

My best friend and I were flying to Chicago from Atlanta to witness his younger sister's graduation from Northwestern, so we made a reservation to a place we'd heard nothing but astounding things about. Turns out, these grand statements were completely true. We got the 12 course meal with wine pairings and I'm not exaggerating when I say it was the meal of my life. From a dish resting on a pillow of scented air that deflated as the meal went on, to what amounted to a shredded duck candy bar to any number of immaculately presented treats, Alinea was a feast for the eyes, stomach, nose and mind. For what it's worth, our meal took about four hours and we each spent around $370 for food, beverage and tip. But I will never forget it.",0.9763,0.82,0.163,0.017,0.4472222222222222
2008-07-09,5.0,"Wow, what an EXPERIENCE.  There were 5 of us and one of the people in our party had made the reservations about 2 months in advance.  We were visiting Chicago and had already planned a weekend of food - Taste of Chicago, that famous pancake place (I can not remember the name - The Pancake House maybe?? haha), and of course Alinea. We got pretty dressed for the occasion.  Men please remember jackets only.  The ladies wore dresses and it seemed to suit the night.  I was happy they sat us at a nice big round table.  The restaurant is very minimalistic which I liked and so clean and in order it really was a pleasure just to be there. The service was quite quite good....interestingly enough I was NOT impressed most by the TASTE of the food.  I was impressed by the whole creative dining experience thing AND the fact that they were able to tailor our 12 course ""tasting"" to some specific dietary requirements that I have. This means: no dairy, no eggs, no meat (except white meat chicken), nothing fried or heavily cooked in oil, no butter (minimal if any), no coconut. For each course I had something a bit different...something tweaked to suit my needs....if they had milk I had soy milk, if they had fried, I had dehydrated. One of the coolest parts was the beef centerpiece (I had himachi instead).  I really do not want to spoil it for anyone who plans on dining here but you will know what I am talking about when you get your centerpieces..... In terms of taste I was wowed but at the same time I was not....weird right?  Two of the dishes had coriander in them and it really overpowered what was underneath it.  One fish dish in particular I did not care for the fish at all....i found it WAYYYY too fishy BUT in Alinea's defense I know that the fish was not bad it was simply a fishy type of fish....my Asian friends who we dined with loved the fish so I knew it was A OK just not my thing (I wish I could remember what kind of fish it was!)

2008-05-27,1.0,"The restaurant remind me of Kejserens nye klder (Emperor's new clothes) I was very excited to dine at Alinea but I was extremely disappointed... It was one of the worst dining experience I ever had. I cannot express how awful it was in words but I'll try  1. The restaurant suggests formal attire (Jacket / no jeans) however their atmosphere did not match the dress requirements. It was very casual in a bad way.  When the hostess took us to our table, I asked her if we were at a waiting room / cocktail room before getting moved to the main dining room, but it was our actual table to experience our Tour - 24 courses. I also noticed that because of the way the tables were set up and bad ventilation, I could smell everyone else's food in the dining room.  2.  The chef added emphasized elements of scents to some of the dishes which were overpowering and not well composed.  For example, he put a full branch of mint in an outer bowl of a dish and the server poured hot water on top of it at the table side.  The mint scent was so strong and overwhelming that it not only destroyed the great soup but also lingered through the next 3 courses served. I could also smell the mint every time someone else in the room received the dish. I could smell the mint before the hot water was poured, I do not understand why he wanted such a strong sent with a dish.  I saw the chef Grant Achatz speaking about importance of scent on video.   ( videos.howstuffworks.com… ) 3. The chef put more effort to create a dish which is ""different"" than ""great tasting"".  Yes some of the dishes such as Ice Fish were beautifully presented, but flavor composition and balance did not follow the beauty.  I believe importance of proportion and balance of ingredients comes before plate presentation. In this dish a lot of mayonnaise was used as glue to make the dried fish stand up.  The Mayonnaise's rich taste was so overpowering that it killed other taste components of the dish.  Also for the wagyu dish, a thinly sliced (shabushabu thickness) beef was frozen by liquid nitrogen then hung on a wire until defrosted and cooked on top of  the warm black truffle / potato.  I asked our server that other than the appearance, what does freezing the beef add to this dish.  He said it was just a presentation for us to enjoy watching the beautiful beef melt and change appearance... Freezing meat usually let moisture out of the cells thus make beef dehydrated.  I cannot see any good reason to freeze wonderful wagyu beef for just appearance... 4. Some dishes such as Bacon which was hanging on a wire were inedible.  I understand why the chef coated bacon by butterscotch for this dish.  Fattiness and saltiness DO go with sweetness (same idea as fois gras with fruit compote, duck confit with balsamic reduction, or honey baked ham...) but the balance is the key..  This dish was overly sweet and fatty, it was inedible. 5. Some of the guests were unacceptably loud and obnoxious.  They were talking to us and other guests over other tables.  We were minding our own business, but few other guests were drunk and yelled at us inappropriately several times.  For example, our server presented a skewered dish served on a freestanding wire and told us to eat it without using hands.  The male guests on the next table shouted ""I wanna see you eat it"" (eating it with our mouth wide open without using hands / resembling a sexual act).  The dining environment was extremely uncomfortable so I asked our server if it was always same at the restaurant where the entire guests talk to each other. His answer was ""our guest enjoy lively atmosphere and even Wolfgang Pack is eating with us tonight.""  The guests kept talking to each other over our table during whole dinner.   I enjoyed neither the food nor the atmosphere. We told our servers to stop bringing last few courses.  We left the restaurant without eating last 3 courses, paid for the entire ""Tour"", left over 15% tip and went out of the restaurant.   To be objective, Visual presentation: 4.3 / 5 points Innovativeness of dishes 5 / 5 points Quality of ingredients 4.2 / 5 points Scent 1 / 5 points Taste of each component in a dish   2.8 / 5 points Composition of flavor for the each dish 1.5 / 5 points Flow of the courses 2 / 5 points Wine (independently from food) 5 / 5 points Wine choices (paired with each dishes) 3.2 / 5 points Server's knowledge of food and wine) 3.9 / 5 points Service (servers' customer service skills) 1.8 / 5 point Atmosphere 1.4 / 5 points Bottom line, I will not dine at Alinea even though they were at $40 per person (at 1/10 of the price point). *To clarify the questions by Matthew M I differentiate stars / overall experience from the points above 1 = never go back 2 = go back if there is a special event I have to attend 3 = go back if convenient 4 = go back 5 = arrange a special trip",0.9965,0.821,0.124,0.056,0.48418512859689344

You walk into a perspective hall and a door slides open to your left.  I felt both inadequate due to not having a food camera, but glad that I am adequate enough to eat without taking pictures of my gluttony. I went with the wine pairings and they were great. If you have to choose between the 24 course or the 12 and wine, go with the 24 however. The wines are expertly chosen, but you don't want to miss the food. If you don't have to choose, good for you. Lemongrass - This was a kumumoto oyster will tiny chilis, ginger, and yuzu served with a lemongrass stalk as a serving utensil.  Fava Beans - 'Tis the season for favas. This elaborate display started with white pillows filled with lavender vapor. Atop the pillows, the server placed a parfait of fava pure, freeze dried banana, olive oil balls, and a lavender gelato. Shaved pecorino on top.   Spring Garlic - Holding onto a ball while eating chicken jelly is not something that I am ready to admit that I have done before, but this was fun. The soup bowl was perfectly spherical and the bite that came with the bowl was lemon with chicken jelly on top. The soup was a puree of spring garlic and was great Ice Fish - Ice fish are these tiny Antarctic fish fried whole and served with fried chips of horseradish, garlic, and potato. It was a fun take on fish and chips. There also were whole asparagus and asparagus emulsion. More ice fish were ground into a tartar like paste.  Lobster - This was my favorite savory course. The first setting is a large bowl filled with mint leaves. The second bowl was lobster, ramp puree, spring peas, and foam. As an interruption, we were served lobster crisps with crme. The large bowl was filled with boiling hot water to release the mint vapor and the dish was spectacular. The ramp bulbs were served whole, the greens pureed and mixed with the spring peas and lobster; it was a perfect encapsulation of spring. Not to mention the free facial.  Waygu Beef - When course four was served another server came by with what appeared to be table flags. We were told to look, but not touch. When course 6 came by, we got our plate with what appeared to be a tiny simple maki piece. As we glanced at our ""flags"", we noticed that they were slices of beef frozen in liquid nitrogen and were now mostly thawed. The ""maki"" was potato with rendered waygu fat wrapped in a black truffle. The waygu was placed atop what we now realized was a very hot plate and the worked like an amazing meat tarp over the truffle and potato. Aged sherry and more rendered waygu fat topped the course.  Short Rib - This course was a perfectly tender short rib boned and place with ramp puree under a gelatinous sheet made from Guinness. Atop the sheet was carmelized broccoli and peanut.  Squab - By this time, I was sweating. I needed a cigarette; and I don't even smoke. The squab was decidedly controversial and, as the server noted, was for many diners. The ""loin"" of squab was roasted. Another was placed in chocolate and baked. The dish was flanked by pickled blueberries, hazelnut crme, and spring garlic puree. Chicken skins were ground and used as ""soil"". eaten.  Bacon -Bacon on a wire wrapped in butterscotch, smoked by apple wood, and served with a spring of thyme.  Carrot - This was a carrot cake. Not any carrot cake that I have ever heard of, but it was great. The spice strip was a Listerine type strip, but instead of making me more appealing on the CTA, this one tasted of nutmeg and cinnamon and made me think of holidays past.  The cake was served with a red curry and date puree. There was a marble sized capsule filled with ginger water. The ""soil"" on top was ground pistachio.  Chocolate - This is one of the most indescribable food items that I have ever seen and I can only compare it to Jackson Pollack or that drink that you make in a garbage can in college. It was pomelo capsules and juice, smoke capsules, miniflowers, egg yolk in a chocolate capsule, and smoke cream in a brownie brioche shell. Had we not been told to mix it, it would have been a disaster. It has so many offputtingly sexy flavors and textures that it couldn't go together right? Wrong. It was a masterpiece.  Sweet Potato - How would you end such an extra extravagant affair, but with flaming cinnamon stick with sweet potato pie tempura on the end lollypop style? It was crunchy and bourbony.  You'll notice that I used perfect a lot, but in truth much of the dinner was just that, perfect. The service was wonderful, the wine was great, and the food was out of this world. The creativity involved was inspirational and the valets were prompt. Don't be intimidated by the food. Be intimidated by the price.

2008-05-11,5.0,"Almost three months after we came here to celebrate our anniversary, I still think Alinea was our most unique food experience ever...even if I can't remember the majority of the dishes. We ambitiously made a reservation for what we thought was 20 courses and when it turned out to be 25, we thought, okay, we can do that. Big mistake. By 18 or so, I felt like I was about to burst and I was really glad I wasn't wearing a tight dress. We had to ask if they could just skip a few for us, and they were nice enough to let us choose from the remaining courses. Note to self: even tiny plates can add up! What impressed us most about Alinea was the service. We went through maybe 21 or 22 courses and with each arrival, our table was cleaned, new utensils arrived on a cushion or tiny platter, and we were told a story about each of our wine pairings. Our servers and sommeliers really knew what they were talking about and no one made us feel like we shouldn't be there (which has happened before seeing as we look fairly young). I have never been so spoiled at a restaurant. We also discovered a delicious muscat that we regret not buying then because we haven't been able to find it since.  The quality of the food was impressive and each course was so meticulously plated that for the first few courses we were both gingerly stabbing at our plate, trying not to ruin anything. That night was also the second time in my life where my food came with instructions! For example, one of our courses required sliding a slab of meat off a pin and dropping it into a bowl of sauce before mixing it up and eating it. There was also one where you had to drop a ball into a tiny glass and let the liquid react before drinking it. And there was one mini treasure hunt for the pork inside a tall bowl full of pine needles (that one smelled really good and tasted even better). Of course, the nutmeg pillow had to be my favorite looking as it was pretty cool to watch your plate slowly drop to the table as the pillow deflated. If you like experimental dishes, you'll love Alinea. We're both glad we were able to experience pins and cushions and foam galore, but in terms of taste, some of the flavor combinations just didn't work for us.",0.9705,0.893,0.087,0.02,0.5825998075998076
2008-05-08,5.0,"With its 125 reviews already, I'm not sure I can add much of anything, but I knew I had to save my 200th review for a special place, so here it goes... I took my boyfriend here last night as a surprise gift for his birthday and a celebration of his landing a new job.   I think the surprise was well received :) Although I'm hesitant to put it this way, I will anyway: Alinea might be compared to a really mind blowing one night stand on some exotic vacation.  Ok I've never had a one night stand, let alone anywhere exotic.  But here's what I mean- its a marathon of indulgence, its an experience like you've never had before - one that might make you feel like no other restaurant will be able to excite you in the same way.  And yet there's a good chance you won't feel the need to experience it again.  Ok maybe that analogy is a complete stretch. I was afraid that the high expectations set by the 125 other reviews here left room only for at least some disappointment.  But it truly was worth every penny and every second of that 4 and a half hours (for the 24 courses)- its an experience that I'll never forget.  Every part of it was crafted to perfection- including the name! The service is impeccable.  There is no hint of snootiness here.  The sommelier made excellent suggestions (even on the low end of the price spectrum).  I had my doubts, but you really will not feel the 4-5 hours go by- Alinea keeps you entertained with each dish that comes out to you, not one on a plain old dinner plate.   Some suggestions.  First, if I did it over again, I might lay off the wine.  There is so much going on with the food - I understand that they have wine pairings to bring out the flavors (we didn't end up doing that but ordered by the half/full bottle instead), but I didn't think it was necessary in the end.  On top of that, be aware that much of the food is very rich, and if you're not used to eating the kinds of things on the menu, your stomach might be unhappy with you (I can't fault Alinea for this, but I'm still fighting off a bit of nausea).  So if you're a novice like me, its probably better to stick with 12 courses, at least for your first time.  (I just figured it was now or never for trying a 24 course meal!)

The waitstaff and sommelier were wonderful, as one might expect, but I was pleasantly surprised by their professionalism which was delightfully lacking in pretension.     You need to eat here.  I don't care what anyone says: Alinea is worth every silly penny.",0.9871,0.73,0.244,0.026,0.5847222222222223

First, I am so pleased that Chef Aschatz' cancer is in remission and he will be able to taste his creations.   Second, and much less importantly, I am a vegetarian which always makes me wary at the best restaurants. Elite chefs--reasonably--don't want to have to compromise and my food choices can get in the way. It's one thing to make a special request at the local greasy spoon, another thing entirely at somewhere as special as this.  I've had to eat plain noodles at world-class restaurants before.   However, Alinea was just as amazing for me as it was for the other people in my party (I had told them there would be a vegetarian in the party in advance, which I think is always a good idea).   Everything was amazing.

We arrived at Alinea for our 6:30 reservation and were escorted up the glass staircase to our table on the second level.  The room we were sat in housed two four tops and a six top.  We were a bit nervous that we'd overpower the small room with loud obnoxious vulgarity.  Shortly after sitting we realized that they sat us in the loud obnoxious vulgar section. Perfect! Each of us went with the twenty four course ""Tour"" menu with wine pairings.  Alinea offers both a twelve and twenty four course menu.  (Alinea is so well designed and deliberate that I am actually spelling out 12 and 24 because I think it looks better!) Below you will find a list of each dish we had followed by a few brief descriptions of those dishes that really stood out.  In the interest of time I decided to not list the wine pairings, but they were all superb. STEELHEAD ROE coconut, lime, vanilla fragrance Yum! YUBA shrimp, miso, togarashi Deep fried soy milk? Grant Achatz has definitely proven that anything deep fried is bound to be good. CRAB passion fruit, avocado, heart of palm This dish was served as a one biter on a white porcelain spoon. The description delivered by our server listed what seemed to be more than ten ingredients. I asked ""How can you fit all that shit on that little spoon?""  Sure enough all the components were abundantly clear on the pallet from just that one itsy bitsy bite. Delicious! SALSIFY caper, dill, smoked salmon Is it just me or is everybody using Salsify these days?  Up until a few weeks ago I had no clue what it was and no I can't get away from it.  BEANS many garnishes, pillow of nutmeg air We all selected this dish as the best of the evening.   It was a navy bean puree with a piece of crisp pancetta on top of that and on top of that a Guinness beer foam.  It was St. Patrick's Day after all!  Surrounding the puree was eight or so single bite accompaniments intended to be consumed with the puree. Brilliant! DUCK butternut squash, banana, Thai flavors LAMB mushroom, red wine, diverse embellishments HOT POTATO cold potato, black truffle, butter PORK BELLY smoked paprika, polenta, pickled vegetables CHICKEN SKIN truffle, corn, thyme MANGO soy, foie gras CARAMEL CORN ""liquefied"". Yep, tastes exactly like liquid caramel corn! CRANBERRY frozen and chewy, bitter orange, chervil One of the most simple and interesting dishes of the evening!  WAGYU BEEF black truffle, potato, Blis Elixir They dangle this piece of beef in front of you and don't let it eat it! It just sits there taunting you and finally they serve it atop a hot potato.    ICE FISH shellfish, horseradish, parsley APPLE CIDER walnut milk, cinnamon, vegetable ash SWEETBREAD cauliflower, burnt bread, toasted hay BLACK TRUFFLE explosion, romaine, parmesan A signature dish that should never ever be taken off of the menu.  Easily my second favorite dish of the evening.  Rich and delicious!  Hands down the best pierogi I have ever had! TRANSPARENCY of raspberry, rose petal, yogurt BACON butterscotch, apple, thyme PERSIMMON carrot, red curry, spice strip LICORICE CAKE muscovado, sugar, orange, hyssop CHOCOLATE egg, pomelo, smoke SWEET POTATO bourbon, tempura, cinnamon incense COFFEE five ways The space is stunning.  It looks like it was pulled from the pages of a really strong issue of Metropolitan Home. To tell you the truth, I was in love with the restaurant before taking a single bite. Alinea....you had me at hello.... You had me at hello....  A majority of the plates and apparatuses that were used for serving food were custom designed for Alinea.  The food, the wine, the interior design, the service, and even the china all worked to create a truly harmonious dining experience.  It was culinary theatre at its very best. The staff was welled dressed, mostly well behaved (a good thing), and very knowledgeable. Everybody is clad in Zegna so it's hard to look bad!  I couldn't keep count of the number of servers who we interacted with, but despite the turnover the service remained consistently perfect.  The thing that stuck out the most was how approachable our sommelier was.  I enjoy wine and like to have an open dialogue with my sommeliers. I find more often than not the sommeliers try to prove their worth to you by spewing out obscure facts and using bad accents.   Our guy was just like one of the guys.  Well, one of the guys who knows a whole lot about wine. 3 ""Tour"" Menus with Wine Pairings $1300",0.9993,0.783,0.181,0.036,0.5046798340548341

If you are not going to appreciate the fact that this is intended to be a sensory exploration of gourmet food, science, architecture, and wine expertise then you might be better off at a local bistro where you can predict each outcome.  Every taste on the menu is designed to be presented in a unique way, to bring out flavors or pairings of flavors in ways you'd never have imagined.

I want to say each little bite is a work of art, is that too over the top? Each item was a sensory experience whether due to scent (using hot bricks to bring out the full scent of fresh rosemary sprigs with a particular dish, for example - -amazing and heady), for your eyes (a sculpture or sorts, with the tastes resting at the top), for your mouth (the consistencies of each food are so varied and unpredictable). Each item we ate that night was delicious and (ahem) might I say arousing?! I mean, literally, my senses were so completely aroused, it was so  decadent. We ate from approx. 8pm to maybe 2am, fairly nonstop. At the end, I was full in a good way, but also loaded (the wine pairings - - perfect) and so content.

Originally I had signed up for the 12-course Tasting menu but my buddy who was also a foodie and I changed our minds to the 24-course Tour menu as we were waiting for our table in the lobby area. We asked if this was possible and the great Chef Achatz told our server that it wouldn't be a problem.  Suffice it to say it was definitely a new and enlightening experience. I had never eaten at a progressive American/avant garde/molecular gastronomy restaurant before. This has definitely opened my eyes about what food is and can be.  Every course was a mixture to tease all the senses. The presentations were beautiful and playful. The servers were knowledgeable and clear with their instructions on how to go about eating every work of art.  The 24-courses came through pretty smoothly and quick, probably because we were on course to be the last ppl there that night. Our time there came at just under 4 hours so that was much appreciated. We also got Chef Achatz to sign our menus.  As we were waiting for one of the staff to flag down a cab outside, I noticed the curtain to the entrance of the first level dining room slightly closed.

I think the only way this restaurant can be adequately described is to discuss its wunderkind, Grant Achatz. Just over five months ago, Achatz was diagnosed with mouth cancer.  Stage four mouth cancer at that.  And even if he survived the illness, there was a great chance that he might lose his sense of taste.  Comparisons were instantly made to Beethoven, but one could sense writers and compatriots where grasping at hope and praying just for survival. This past Thursday, I received a call from the restaurant to confirm Allie, her parents, and my reservation at Alinea.  After we had discussed the typical issues (confirmation, special requests, food allergies, etc.), I asked the caller about Chef Achatz's health.  I was prepared to receive a somewhat snide comment about the Chef's health being private or something similar.  Instead, the caller thanked me.  Thanked me for asking.  And mentioned a press release which was put forth by the restaurant the previous week.  In the release, which the caller mentioned, the restaurant and Achatz finished with Achatz's own personal motto: ""Onward."" So there I stood, preparing to leave the restaurant on Saturday night, prepared to receive my coat from the front-of-the-house staff, when I looked into the kitchen.  Allie's parents were wondering who Chef G was, when I saw him.  Anyone who has been in or around restaurants can pick out the truly special chefs when they see them.  There is an aura to them.  Some have an air of power; others are manic; others are barking orders.  While I haven't seen too many great chefs in action, I knew Chef Achatz immediately.  He was the one who was moving slowly between the tables, with an air of infinite calmness and purpose.  A man who had risen to the pinnacle of his profession only to be told he may die.  A man who had seen an empire rise only to hear prognostications that it may crumble as fast.  A man that had seen the end and knew that the dish he prepared or conceived of that night was not as important as other things.   He had a wisdom in his movement that is not often seen among the young and even less seen amongst the uber-successful young.  He was a man, frankly, who had done more in the past 3 years than many do in 70-year lifetimes. And despite his success and the money that he likely has (and further the opportunity he likely had to walk away from it all), there he stood.  Tenderly placing a sauce on his dish or preparing a foam for another dish.  Intensely calm.  Striving onward. To Chef Achatz, five stars are insufficient to truly describe your efforts in Alinea.  But despite the perfection you have created, you strive onward.   And for that, like your staff so graciously stated, I say thank you.",0.9959,0.802,0.15,0.048,0.5493386243386245

Kudos to the staff who were watchful, never intrusive and completely informative on the food experiences and the wine pairings.  We also appreciated the small details of our coats and car were already waiting for us by the time we reached the lobby to depart.   The atmosphere was austere as one might expect.  Our table was so large that my date and I had difficulty communicating without shouting, which I found to be a bummer as it was a very quiet place.",0.9192,0.812,0.14,0.048,0.5465367965367967

2007-12-09,5.0,"Alinea was probably the most memorable culinary experience I've had.  Probably not the greatest, but definitely the most exciting.  I'm definitely not the type who usually spends this kind of money on a meal, so I had high expectations, but I would say that Alinea delivered.  I've never had food where the total experience of eating was as well considered and nuanced.   As an architect I wish the fairly bland and corporate architecture of the space (despite the funny perspective of the entry hall and the nicely detailed staircase) reflected more of the playful, alien feel I identified in the food.  I felt like I should have been eating in something that looked like a felopian tube.  I wouldn't normally critique a restaurant on its architecture as some of the meals I've liked the best were served in buildings or strip malls only a few steps up from cardboard shacks, but Alinea isn't a ""normal"" restaurant.  I suppose they wanted to focus the attention on the food though.  That said, the experience of the actual food was ambitiously intended to be experienced with all five senses, and ultimately succeeded in delighting most of them.  They were also extremely conscientious about dietary restrictions, which actually surprised me in meals that involved so much prep work.  Two of the six us at the table don't eat land animals, and got substitutions of Japanese sea fish or lobster in dishes typically of beef etc.   Unlike other reviewers, I felt that occasionally the meal did slip into ridiculous and goofy territory, but it didn't detract from my enjoyment of it.  And I don't know if it's middle class guilt around service, but the attentiveness of the servers was somewhat creepy for me, though I'm sure most of their clients are used to it.  By the end of the over four hour meal I wished there was an ""opt-out"" clause in my culinary contract so I could push in my own chair and not have to get a new napkin every time I went to the bathroom (which was a LOT since I drink a lot of water, haha).  One of my later bathroom trips I jokingly attempted to fold my napkin so it would look new and the server would see it and think one of his coworkers had already given me a new napkin, but my friends said he came over, saw my napkin, laughed out loud, and put down a new one.   The creepy attentiveness of the servers was offset by their friendliness, accessibility, and knowledge of the food.  And I think they liked us or could tell we were only barely out of college and couldn't really afford it, because they ended up not charging us for one of the six set menus!  That saved us like $200!  That's major points in my book, though I suppose that could be common practice.  Also, midway through the meal my eating buddy told me that when she ate at Per Se they charged $10 per teeny bottle of sparkling water, and since I had been guzzling it (you get thirsty over four hours of eating food chock full of weird salty foams and dehydrating chemicals!), I was terrified that my own water bill would be like $100+, but I think it was just like $8 or $10 per person.  What a relief, ha ha.   Overall, a fantastic experience and one I'd repeat; if  you're buying, anyway.  Ha.",0.9985,0.792,0.18,0.028,0.5733737373737373

The food, the dishes, presentation, service is all impecable! The food was simply orgasmic to say the least.....bursting with flavor and the artistic talent that goes into the food preparation. I was just thinking out loud to myself that there must be all these chefs sitting in the kitchen decorating all these plates and creating each masterpiece!  We were priviledged to sit next to this couple who happens to be one of the investors of the restaurant and we overheard him telling the servers that he just returned from Venice, Italy the very same day and came right in to try the Fall menu before it went away. He added that nothing in Venice quite beat the Alinea experience! :) So he told us that there are at least 25-26 chefs in the kitchen creating up a storm! 25???? That's a whole assembly line on the manufacturing floor of some company, I would think!  the 3.5 hour dining experience was simply unbeatable, it flew on by quickly without us realizing it....we were hoping it would never end. The food portion was decent sized and we were not stuffed over the top and neither did we leave hungry, it was a very satisfying, a nice, comfortable feeling!  The 12 course flight tasting menu was delightful, as Yelper Jeremy L pointed out; wagyu beef covered within a bowl of pine leaves and the ""pumpkin pie"" served skewed on a burnt oak branch, dish served on a fluffy pillow filled with nutmeg aroma, scallop served in a bowl on top of a dish filled with hot water and chamomile and lavender and the server was joking that we could have steamed our face for facial....it was such a nice pleasure to witness all these creativity in presentation and food decor!

Whatever the case, I've embraced my inner-nerd and celebrate it (with close friends only).  For these reasons, I suppose that  I would have a natural interest and affinity towards molecular gastronomy.  Ground-breaking chefs such as Ferran Adria and Pierre Gagnaire push the limits of food and really make us reconsider everything we know about cuisine. Well friends, after dining at Alinea, I believe Grant Achatz deserves to be listed with the heavy-hitters of molecular gastronomy. Now let me remind you all that wifey and I are not toothless hillbillies who are easily fooled with smoke and mirrors.  If something tastes bad, we'll say it tastes bad no matter how much you manipulate or dress it up.  We've eaten at places that try to wow their customers with ridiculous foams, lavender perfumes, and lobster-scented bubble-baths... we weren't fooled.  Molecular gastronomy is a powerful  tool.  But when it's done poorly, everything on your plate just seems pathetically silly. Options at Alinea are simple, choose the tasting or the tour menu.  If you want to do the tour menu, you'll have to commit when you make the reservation (typically 2 months in advance). You'd better go with the tour, or you're an idiot. Brief version:   22 courses, nearly 5 hours. - At least 4 courses involved liquid nitrogen. - 2 courses involved warnings by our server of possible ""explosion"". - 3 courses included custom-made utensils which could poke your eye out... - 4 courses included live plants Long version: Wifey and I are fairly quick eaters.  If food is set in front of us, we'll gleefully shove it in our gullets and chew later.  The pace at Alinea was very good, with stuff coming out pretty quickly.  Despite this, nearly five hours lapsed from beginning to end.  I felt like we were in some time-warp because the dinner seemed to pass by so quickly.  Another benefit of molecular gastronomy!! The showmanship and creativity were truly breathtaking.  Many courses were highlighted by unique bowls, plates, and utensils created especially for that particular dish.  Other offerings were accented simply with embellishments by mother nature herself.  A branch of oak leaves, a single hyacinth stalk,  a fat gob of brook trout roe... mmmmm brook trout roe. If you can set aside the snake-oil and smoke, the food is absolutely astounding.  Because many courses consist of a single bite, swallow, or ""explosion"", the flavors have to be concentrated  and ""spot-on"" or the entire course is a waste of time.  In these single morsels, Chef Achatz's genius is revealed.  That liquid nitrogen or burnt bread reduction isn't puffery, it's methodically and painstakingly utilized to make the food better. Better food through science... Alinea would give Vulcans orgasms. You'd better believe that our Chicago experience was highlighted by our dinner at Alinea.  It beats deep-dish pizza by a country mile!",0.992,0.791,0.149,0.06,0.5641933916423714

2007-08-15,4.0,"What can I say, it's been over 6 months since I've been to Alinea, and I'm still not sure what I think of the place. I know I want to go back, but that's more out of curiousity than because I really liked their food. Don't get me wrong, there were some fantastic dishes to be had at Alinea. In particular we really liked the Sour Cream, Melon, Finger Limes, Pineapple and Strawberries. But there were also some real duds. Duds. There's an interesting word. When I use it to describe Alinea's food, it's not because the food lacked flavor. On the contrary, I'd say that certain dishes contained too much flavor. Or at least too much of one flavor that the dish seemed imbalanced and over powered by items that were supposed to play a supporting role. One of the first dishes that springs to mind is the Broccoli Stem. This was a disappointing dish because I had been looking forward to it after reading about it online. The grapefruit in this dish and the steelhead roe just completely masked this poor broccoli to the point that you could have put almost any vegetable in there without making much of a difference. Then there were dishes like the Porcini that tasted like nothing but pureed sunflower seeds. Oddly, since the porcini flavor is similarly earthy and nutty, it was just a muddled mass of goo in my mouth. I think this was the only dish I didn't finish. Other dishes were just disappointing because, as creative as they were, they just actually didn't go far enough. The Beef (flavors of A-1) had all of these little flavors to try with your beef, but they didn't give you enough ink in your well to truly experiment with the canvas they gave you. I actually just rolled mine all up to combine all of the flavors and didn't bother trying to mix-n-match in what appeared to be a futile exercise. I realize that I've focused almost exclusively on the negatives here, but that's because I figured there is enough praise and drooling on the eGullet forums that I should give a counter point. Don't get me wrong, I can certainly understand what people are raving about and I really do think Chef G is an important figure in the American culinary scene. I think his influences will be felt for years to come, especially as he becomes more established and more of a household name among non-foodies. Regardless, even after months of reflecting on our meal, it just doesn't change the fact that we walked away disappointed. Some have been criticized for going without having an open mind or they just don't understand the cuisine or numerous other silly knocks. I can confidently say that I went with an open mind knowing fully what to expect, but the food, or more specifically the flavors, just didn't seem like anyone tasted them before putting it on an antennae and sticking in front of me. This got me thinking about the experience of dining. An interesting thing about dining, is that a single dish isn't going to make or break a meal. The experience as a whole is what people will remember when they decide if they like a restaurant. A particular dish is what people will remember when they decide if they like a particular flavor profile. A great example of this is The French Laundry. Aside from the Oysters & Pearls, I can't say there were a lot of dishes that really stand out in my mind, yet it was one of the best meals I've had in my life. In contrast, I remember quite vividly several dishes from Alinea, both good and bad, yet it was probably our least favorite meal of our entire Chicago trip (Ann Sather being the other). So no, I didn't enjoy our meal there. Yes, I would encourage others to go. Yes, I enjoyed the challenge. And yes, I'm looking forward to returning. Weird, I know.

2007-08-08,5.0,"Speechless That and in tears That was how my daughter and I were both left after spending several hours at Alinea...it lives up to the hype and then some.  It soared beyond the rating of Gourmet, it really is in a class of its own. You will have to know where you are going, because this little house on Halsted that holds this gem of a restaurant isn't marked.  And be prepared to enter an Alice in Wonderland sort of adventure, because you open the door and you feel like you're descending into a tunnel.  Doors whisper open and there is the host waiting for you...very surreal We felt SO out of place, SO out of our league...like what the freak were WE doing there, in this incredible place?  Was this really happening?   The menu was specially prepared for us as we're not seafood eaters, I am allergic and my pastry chef daughter isn't all that adventurous (she is now after this menu!) so we were delighted with all sorts of different entrees, cleverly plated and just bursting into our mouths. Two writers from Cooks Illustrated sat next to us, they were enjoying the Tour, while we only had the Tasting (we had 15 courses instead of the usual 12...I think that may have been because of the birthday celebration).  We watched as they listened intently as each more intricate dish than the last was brought out and we laughed at the expressions on their faces.  They returned the favor as they enjoyed US experiencing our delightful dinner. My favorite still is this miraculous hot potato/cold potato...I can still see the tiniest of cheese and miniature cube of butter, and I can still taste all of those tiny ingredients melding together into a mouthful of exquisite potato flavors...earthly, with the shaved truffle, creamy with the cold soup...just beyond description! We were delighted with each plating, even the lavendar air pillow that was served with the duck...it was an all senses experience to be sure. The caramal/meyer lemon/cinnamon show stopper at the end...brought tears to my eyes...I wanted several more of those, the favors were still in my mouth as we were getting ready to leave Because my daughter is in the industry, we asked if we could see the kitchen, possibly meet Grant or the Chef de Cuisine.  On a very, very sad note, due to Grant's recent diagnosis with mouth cancer, he was in treatment and did not speak to anyone.  We said that was totally understandable, to be able to see the kitchen was an honor enough We went downstairs and waited and we were shown into the kitchen, and my daughter was awestruck by the 20 chefs preparing all sorts of tiny, amuse bouche sized 'entrees'.  We watched in awe as they delicately prepared the hot potato/cold potato entree and were just speechless. I honestly don't know what we said after Grant Achatz walked up and shook our hands.  He sidestepped my question about how he was feeling, and was very attentive to my daughter after he found out who she worked for...she was nearly in tears by the time we walked out the front door. Run, don't walk...fly on the fastest plane, do whatever you can to get here before its too late...and let's all pray there's a cure for cancer...STAT!",0.9917,0.846,0.115,0.039,0.6106316137566137
2007-07-29,5.0,"I really can't top Monica T.'s review on the food, so I'm going to review their valet.  I drove my car up to the valet area in front of Alinea. (The only way you'll know you're at Alinea is when you see the valet sign. ) Initially I think they thought I was lost, because they didn't come up to valet my fancy Ford Focus rental car. I had to wave at them and they came over. So I got out and watched them drive the car away. So while I was waiting outside for Monica T., Jun H. and their friend, the valet was nice enough to point out that they found a street parking spot for my car, so they wouldn't charge me for valet service. My jaw almost dropped to the floor. ""Really?!?!"" I asked as he handed me back the car keys. ""That was awfully nice of you!"" And then I tried to give him a tip, and he refused politely. Never before had I experienced someone being so kind to find me a parking spot and refuse a tip! Perhaps it's the astounding attention to service at Alinea or Midwestern kindess, but I would love it if more people were like Alinea's valet staff. :)",0.9689,0.851,0.119,0.029,0.61
2007-07-24,5.0,"Warning: The following review is TRUNCATED and better revisited at my blog for full pictures and commentary  =P Five stars for innovation, though some flavors are less accessible to the palate than others Alinea can best be described as a series of carefully orchestrated surprises for each of your five senses. While the 12-course tasting menu will set you back $135 and a good four hours, it is unlike any culinary experience I've had yet. It may seem counterintuitive, but the best way to experience Alinea is without expectations. Yes, you've read the hype and you've heard the buzz about molecular gastronomy--but you've never had bacon for a palate cleanser and you've never dreamed of adding soy sauce to your dessert. So when you hear adjectives such as good, orgasmic, or weird, you're really only hearing expletives that are void of meaning. Because unless you've been intimately acquainted with the likes of Homaro Cantu, Heston Blumenthal, Wylie Dufresne, or Ferran Adria, you will really have no baseline with which to compare Alinea to. COURSE HiGHLIGHTS Course 3: Monkfish - banana, onion, lime // Cauliflower. Our only other seafood dish was Monkfish (vegetarian Cauliflower), prepared in a mousse, tempura, and steamed with banana and lime sauces and garnished with an onion paper. Above all, this was a lesson in texture with the creamy mousse, crunchy tempura, and silky monkfish. The banana and lime sauces cooled the dish, while the onion paper dissolved swiftly in our mouths. Like any good lover, Achatz means only to give you a taste of what he's got in store for the rest of night. Our first four courses were merely child's play--dishes that were fathomable and gently teased us into oral foreplay. So just when we were starting to get bored... Course 5: Apple - horseradish, celery. We were told to throw back the shots and to open our mouths wide to take in the entire ball at once. Once inside, there was a cytoplasmic explosion of apple juice. It was strangely pleasant and slightly erotic all at once. Paying careful attention to the progression, this first eruption was gentle, easing us into the experience. Once the liquid went down, we were left with the essence of horseradish but with only a hint of its heat. The remainder of our savory courses paid homage to the regional cuisine with a Midwest-lean towards rich, protein heavy dishes. Course 6: Duck - mango, yogurt, pillow of lavender air // Turnip. The Duck (vegetarian Turnips) was prepared in a manner befitting of pork with duck rinds, duck bacon, and pulled duck. As with the other fruit sauces, the essence of mango really shone through and for added pizazz, the whole plate was set atop a pillow of lavender air, which diffused directly into our olfactory systems. Course 8: Black Truffle - explosion, romaine, parmesan. Though it came sans meat, the Black Truffle ravioli was no less rich. Although benign looking, the pasta membrane actually housed a robust, truffle scented broth that exploded upon contact. The single ravioli captured the soul of an entire pasta dish and would have sated any craving for Italian, no matter how small or large. Course 10: Bacon - butterscotch, apple, thyme. Our prayers were answered when an interlude came announcing the arrival of dessert. While the vegetarians got a Honeydew jelly to cleanse their palates, we were served dehydrated Bacon. With the OC Fair currently in tow, it was a stone's throw away from a caramel apple. Served on a rocking apparatus, it was highly whimsical and an inventive way to bridge the salty to sweet transition. Our last and final dish was Course 14: Caramel - meyer lemon, cinnamon perfume. I will never understand how you tempura a viscous caramel and lemon, but the taste of churro sent me yearning for home. How many licks do you think it take to get to a center of a caramel tempura ball the size of a golf-ball? Alinea's answer is one. The staff read our minds (or eavesdropped on our conversation) and asked us if we wanted to see the kitchen at the stroke of midnight when our meal ended. The kitchen was starting to wind down, which gave Chef Chad a chance to explain to us the wax molds he was working on. No sign of Grant Achatz, but Chad was good enough eye candy for me. In closing, Alinea is not about what you do or don't like. It is about the appreciation of an unnamed sensation, a flavor that leaves you at a loss for words, and a culinary innovation that is only beginning to take flight in the United States. It is the technology of the early adopter and the beta version of a cuisine that is not yet commercially viable. Some art forms are more accessible to the intellect--others, just need to be studied to be appreciated.

2007-07-05,4.0,"Recently ate here on a trip to Chicago and would definitely recommend it to anyone serious about food. The tour could be shortened by 4 courses - a bit of palette overload going on.  It's nowhere near the quality of French Laundry or Fat Duck (I've seen comparisons to both), but it is good.  It is a bit pricey for what it is and I'm being really honest here. I have no issues paying $500-1000 for dinner per person if it's worthwhile. This, was not. The wine pairing for the tour was a bit too much. Luckily our table was in the smaller back room -- I say luckily because the other dining areas looked, well, not as cool. Oh and the sommelier is one seriously opinionated person! Question any of his judgments or really really snide comments and it's like World War III. Overall his picks were solid, but he could do without the slanted commentary.",0.9577,0.735,0.179,0.086,0.44305555555555554

WOW!  This place is absolutely amazing... a feast for all of the senses.  This really shouldn't be thought of as just a restaurant, but some sort of sensory experience.  I won't soon forget this place.   Everything has already been said...the chef is a genius and everyone I had contact with, is beyond superb.  I love the minimalist decor which accentuates the food so well and strangely enough, I think the absence of music (at least I didn't hear any), works very well.

2007-06-19,5.0,"I recently had two friends in from the Sonoma/Napa area of California. They came to visit the city and specifically eat at Alinea. They asked that I attend with them as a treat for my birthday. Quite the treat indeed. First of all the couple had met the chef in the past and also new someone else connected to the restaurant.... which led us to having a special 27 course meal ....along with wine pairings. Needless to say, this was one of the most amazing dining experiences of my lifetime. 27 courses and 5 1/2 hours later our dinner was complete with a look of amazement on all of our faces. The food, the inventiveness, the service.... all outstanding. I agree with another yelper.... multiple foodgasms happened that night. I cannot recommend Alinea enough. My favorite courses: Monkfish done 3 ways. Wagyu beef (and I thought Kobe was amazing) with yuzu, seaweed smoke and sea grapes. Cheese in a cracker. Rhubarb done 6 ways. Hot potato, cold potato wit black truffle and butter. Foie Gras with spicy cinnamon, apple pate de fruit..... the list can go on and on. Plus an amazing combination of Italian, French and German wines that made me giddy. To top off the evening..... going into the kitchen to see the amazing staff of chefs and meeting head chef Grant.

2007-06-11,5.0,"I dined at Alinea a year ago for my birthday. Best birthday meal ever. Swank, sophisticated, pretentious. Brilliantly innovative, creative, gorgeous. Outstanding food. Tops Bouley, in my opinion, in both palate and presentation. And god, the presentation.  Bison on a hot rock nestled in a bed of juniper branches? Mace scented pillows on which to balance your duck and foie gras? Genius. More than genius. Chef/owner Grant Achatz is a culinary savant. From the opening dish, Hot Potato (a cold potato soup served in a half-dollar sized paraffin bowl skewered with potato and black truffle) to the finish, the menu was simply superb. There were a few standouts: the salsify with smoked salmon and steelhead roe; pork with honeycomb, grapefruit and puffed pork thigh; kobe beef topped with roasted squash seeds and paprika candy. I actually shut down my extraneous senses when I tasted the duck with foie gras, quince and onion-closed my eyes and tuned everyone out. I will never forget that foie gras, ever. Sigh. The beauty of Alinea is that there is a high degree of fun hidden in all the pomp. Ice cream in Achatz's world comes in a single bite set on a the gastronomic equivalent of a radio antenna, and the hovering waitstaff insist you eat it witout using your hands. A complimentary shot glass of green liquid with what looks to be an egg yolk is set before each diner. Enquiry (or patience) reveals the liquid is a celery-base, the yellow globe a shell of madras curry; shoot it, close your mouth quickly to collapse the shell, and enjoy the ensuing burst of deliciousness. Get the sommelier with the goatee. He's a punk-rock oenophile. How can you go wrong? The only problem, at least when I went a year ago, was that it was far too quiet. My group of five in a side room apparently ""chased away"" a few couples who got tired of our celebratory mood. It also is rather uncomfortable to have personal conversations with a multitude of staff in attendance at all times. I've worked in personal service. I can never fully ignore the presence of servicepeople, so you either self-censor or give everybody the 411 on your business. Eh. I can live with that for another taste of that foie, though!",0.9916,0.813,0.145,0.041,0.5491624895572265
2007-06-06,5.0,"Incredible, but be prepared for a test of your culinary endurance.  I went when I first moved to Chicago, as some friends came to help me move in (although only after they secured reservations at Alinea). We had 9:30PM reservations, and although I expected the 20+ courses, I had no clue we would be there until 1:30AM.  I nearly passed out at 11:30 around the 15th course, but a succulent veal course revitalized me.  [Upon rereading my friend's blog, it was the pork cheek that woke me up]  The menu is also really neat, and I enjoyed a great apertif recommended by the server. The service is impeccable.  Throughout the entire four hour meal, it truly felt like we had our personal wait staff team of three.

2007-05-22,5.0,"Wow! Second best restaurant I have ever dined at. This was the third attempt at dining at Alinea. Our first two had to be  cancelled due to last minute work conflicts. So when the event finally came, we were stoked. Be warned, there is no sign that we could see. We drove past the place twice without finding it. Finally we saw the valet sign and voila, we were in! The entrance is a little spooky. It is a dark corridor that tapers narrower the deeper in you go. We crept our way through the dark to the end and a sliding door a la Star Trek silently opened beside us and an immaculately dressed man greeted us warmly. Very spooky indeed.  We were immediately let upstairs to our gigantic table for two in a sparsely decorated room that could be on the cover of Wallpaper magazine. The main decoration were these space age lillies in glass vases with the Japanese rock embellishments. The colors were all soothing browns and mauves to tone down the off white linens. And guess what? The linens were actually MADE OUT OF LINEN! Not cotton, not silk, not satin, but LINEN. What a nice touch.There was nothing but the linens adorning the table.  The wine menu was like a work of bloody Russian realist ficiton, with 600 or more protaganists, all of them larger than life itself (most north of $80 per bottle). I was a little too peckish and thirsty to read part one of War and Peace so we just ordered what the Sommelier suggested - a champagne cocktail made by mixing a boutique Champagne with just a smidge of sweet dessert wine. Delicious.  The Sommelier pushed the wine pairings option, which he describes as painstakingly matched to each course, and rather than making a Tolstoyan effort at the wine list I decided to submit to our Sommelier's will. The meal:  14 courses, all small, many bite-sized, but in whole just a little too much food (which to me is the perfect amount) Every dish was both a work of Art, and a work of Science - in particular, a work of Chemistry. From the octopus nestled in a pillow of papaya with a spoon for a bed, suspended above a bowl of warmed, coconut-infused soy milk , to the black truffle juice someow stuffed to tightly into a ravioli that it literally explodes into your mouth when you bite it (if you are not careful you spew it all over your date) -- this meal is the yin and yang of dining. Most of the courses are really beyond description, and many of the flavor combinations I have never seen before - think bacon with butterscotch; brie or avocado ice-cream; chocolate and lemongrass; apple and horseradish -- get the picture? The amazing thing is, it all works. Plus every course has a science gimmick -- such as your plate sitting on a pillow that has been filled with lavender scented air so that as you eat the weight of the pillow pushes the air out for you to smell with your food; or a licorice cake that is somehow perfectly skewered on a flexible metal rod that somehow suspends just before your cake-hole, so that you can just stick your face into it and have at it, reminding you of the good old caveman days before knives and forks; or like the magical chocolate ball that sat innocently in its bowl until the waiter poured hot white chocolate milk onto it and the top half (AND ONLY THE TOP HALF) of the ball melted away, revealing a cross-section of outer chocolate crust, a molten white chocolate lava mantle, and a chocolate brownie core. How the hell do they DO these things??? Service was almost on the casual side, as the jocular waiters encouraged us to chow down on the licorice cake, and use our fingers to rip into the bacon and butterscotch, but at that place it works. The Sommelier did not dissapoint - the parings were indeed perfectly matched. But that brings me to why I don't like wine pairings. There are always a bubbly course, two to three white wine courses, two red wine courses and one or two sweet wine courses. Well, call me caveman, but I generally would rather have like eight bubbly courses or maybe eight red courses, or maybe four and four. I don't like sweet wine much, and some white wines I just find boring. So next time I will skip the pairing and instead I'll just get mediaeval on the 600 bottle wine list.  Finally, I wish there was some kind of music, even if it was almost imperceptable music. A piano, a string section, something. The restaurant was packed but it was so quiet you could hear the waiters at the other tables, and you could hear everyone else's conversations. So it made us self-conscious of our conversations. If I'm going to drop $600 for two people for dinner, I don't want to feel embarrassed when I get loosened up and start telling my date about my Joan Jett fetish... Other nice touches -- replacing the LINEN napkin with a new one every time you go to the rest room, a different type of bread with each course, custom made dinnerware designed around each course, and at the end they bring you the printed menu for a keepsake.

2007-05-20,5.0,"Having read soooo much hype about this place I went in almost looking to be disappointed...it didn't happen.  Not even a little. The thing is, you HAVE to go in knowing that you're about to drop a SERIOUS chunk of change (though, even with this understanding, the sticker shock is pretty mean).  My friend and I decided to partake in the whole experience offered for our 12 course selection, including the champagne cocktail at the beginning of the meal, the wine pairings with the courses and the unbelievably good coffee at the end.  Everything, including tip, for the two of us totaled $630.  Yeah, I know. But, kinda like I described in my review of Tru, this is not JUST dining out, it's an experience in and of itself.  I am not a foodie, I am not artsy.  But I do like to go into things in full disclosure and with an open mind.  What I came out with was what was so unexpected: I was completely inspired.  In each course, the combination of flavors from ingredients I am already familiar with was astounding.  Things that I never would have dreamed of going well together worked so harmoniously, never in a shocking manner, but always surprising.  Clearly, the chef's knowledge of all ingredients - how they can be prepared in such a way to best compliment one another, how they taste at different stages of natural maturity, their textures,  - is deep and, again, astounding. One of my favorite eating experiences is to consume a dish where I am chasing the flavors: ""ooh, I got just got a bite of sweet that works beautifully with all this savory...where's another bit...""  These are the meals where, before you know it, you're stuffed but still want more.  12 of the 13 courses I had were like this...without the ""stuffed"" part. So, the place:  Very modern, intimate, lots of clean lines and thoughtful details (the cloth towels in the bathroom - single-serve, no attendant, thank you; the tasteful covers on the HVAC vents in the ceiling; funky and unusual floral arrangements, comfortable chairs).  Aside from the fact that, when we walked in through the sliding metal doors, there was no host stand or anyone to greet us for a few minutes so we weren't sure what we were supposed to do, the staff was amazing.  I can only assume that each ""server"" is briefed on only a few of the dishes in the series and, when this dish is to be served at any of the tables, they are the guy to do it throughout the restaurant: we had at least 6 different people explain different things to us as they were brought.  It also didn't hurt that (especially for a 'girl's night') there were so many cute guys: well-groomed, artsy-types in very nice suits.  And the sommelier...hubba hubba. I have a whole description of each course but, alas, it won't fit here.

Each course is innovative, inventive, spectacular and unbelievably arranged and presented.  The inventive techniques applied, from creating foam, pureeing vegetables, grilling meat on hot stones and freezing with liquid nitrogen.   From the gentle presentation, the unprententious atmosphere, to the exquisite timing, Alinea is the epitome of dining excellence.  Never did I wonder about a nuance of my experience, anticipation of my desires were satiated.",0.9813,0.825,0.166,0.009,0.6670634920634921
2007-03-14,4.0,"If you're a foodie and have the spare cash -- and especially if you already live here in Chicago -- then it would be an enormous mistake to never visit Alinea. It is absolutely everything that the critics say: Innovative, creative, thoughtfully prepared food with some of the best service you will see and a calm sparse, New York-chic setting. The way the food is presented beats some of the art I've seen in galleries around here. It's often a shame that it must be eaten. That was only literally the case on one course that I had there the other night: the beef course was incredibly salty and lifeless and the Guinness glace/gel only added to the saltiness. For one of the main course tastes, it was very disappointing. The others were fine, but compared to -- as an example -- Charlie Trotter's, I found myself wanting more flavor and less artifice in a few of the courses. The bacon on the trapeze, though? Genius. I realize the menu changes (and this was on as of March 2007), but I hope it's a permanent fixture. I thought the wine pairing was well worth it and the sommeliers were obviously very knowledgeable, and I appreciated that while they (and the other service) was solicitous, it was not stuffy. In fact, I've never heard so many random pop culture references made at a table at a formal restaurant. The servers and sommeliers in fact, appeared to be hipsters (who happen to know a lot about food and wine). I'm not sure I'd return any time too soon (for one thing, I'm now broke!), but as I said from the start, it is ranked as one of the top restaurants in the entire country, and if you're interested in innovative cuisine, you really should try it at least once.",0.9761,0.855,0.114,0.031,0.5831892453951277

2007-02-27,5.0,"Alinea I went with the tour menu. Due to the 24 courses, I won't write a bunch of comments about each, but rather primarily rank the dishes and mention the highlights for each dish. I prioritized the dished by a 1 (dishes I loved), 2 (dishes I thought were good) ,or 3 (dishes that I didn't care for). I had 11 #1s, 8 #2s, and 5 #3s. The pictures really do more justice for this place than my written review. To sum up this dinner, I'll say the same thing I told one of the sommeliers, ""Thank Grant's parents for having sex."" #8 Croquette Cheese filled and one of the first times I thought salmon roe actually complimented a dish, rather than overwhelm it with salt. #19 Octopus They hand this dish to you so I forgot to take a picture of it before I ate it. A well prepared dish. #1Chanterelle The presentation on this one was cool. It comes on the plate within a cylinder. Then, they pull the cylinder and the dish pours out on the plate. The flavor on the mushroom cream propelled this one to the top. #16 Apple Fresh flavors of apple and celery. Cool interlude between dishes. #15 Monkfish The monkfish was presented three ways: fried, grilled, and pate. Very good, but too normal for Alinea. #12 Duck They bring this one out on a pillow that is filled with juniper air and then puncture it, so there is this aroma of juniper. Pretty cool. The dish itself was good, but not memorable. #7 Black truffle One of the best tasting dishes I had. He knows how to use truffles. The serving dish was cool because it had an opening in the bottom.  #6 Short rib One of the best presented dishes I had, next to the coconut. Layered with Guinness (beer) gel, it looked liked a piece of art and tasted great. I could have done without the peanuts. The rating was more for the presentation. #20 Yuzu  Nothing special to me, but the flavor was good. It was a yuzu flavored with saffron and sprinkled with powdered sugar. #10 Chestnut I love maple so it may be my bias. The chestnut base had a good flavor too. #11 Persimmon Two things stood out on this one. The ginger liquid filled ball, it's explosive and I liked it. The brioche pudding was the star of this dish, very rich. I could bathe in this stuff. #14 Licorice cake It was a chocolate-licorice cake and it was well-executed, I could have done without the hay on the top. You are supposed to put the whole thing in your mouth without the use of your hands. I think women could learn a lot from this dish.  #22 King crab Not for me. I didn't care for the gel around the crab and the rice on the side looked nice, nothing special on the flavor. #24 Skate Rumor has it; the chef calls this one, Master of the Universe. I forgot to asked why they served it with bananas, it was odd to me. And way too much powder on the plate. It was the only dish that I thought didn't work. None of the flavors went together. #21 Pinapple Like the yuzu, it was good, but nothing special.  #4 Lamb One of my favorite for the presentation and the quality of the lamb. I would consider it a simple dish, each lamb piece with a different sauce, but it was near perfect. I also liked the change to chopsticks. It was served on this hot coal that seared the bottom of the lamb. That's hot. #5 Hot potato One of his signature dishes and for good reason. It's a warm potato ball in a cold soup with truffles. You pull the pin out and the potato falls in the soup. Again, the presentation and the truffles make the dish. #18 Venison Just way too much granola for the venison. Once you take the granola off, the meat goes well with the accompanying sauces. #13 Foie gras This was the chef's complimentary dish. I just liked the fact that I could get foie gras in Chicago. It was a foie gras mouse encased in cinnamon bun dough. Sweet goes with foie gras and it worked well.  #2 Orange I'm certain there is cocaine in this dish. It's the one I still crave today. That olive oil ice cream is something Ben or Jerry should look into to. Looking around a lot of other people seems to like this dish, also. #3 Coconut I'll remember this one for some time. It had the best presentation of the evening. The coconut ribbon across the middle reminded of the 60s when brides use to wear white to weddings, I miss that color. Taste wise, the cornmeal cake was the star. #17 Chocolate - passionfruit, kaffir lime leaf, soy Not sure if it was the wine kicking in at the time, but I stared at the chocolate for a few minutes. Like in that one Seinfeld episode when Elaine stop having sex and she was starring at the tires go 'round and 'round. I just thought it was cool how they coiled the chocolate.  #9 Caramel It came wrapped around a cinnamon stick, crisp on the outside and a rich, juicy bite of caramel on the inside. Great dish. #23 Bacon It's just bacon with a strip of butterscotch. I would take this one off the menu.",0.9996,0.792,0.19,0.018,0.5882477839620697
2007-02-20,4.0,"The four of us flew to Chicago from California one weekend for the express purpose of dining at Alinea.   We opted for the 23 course ""tour"" menu.   Every element of the dining experience at this restaurant is carefully considered, even your first steps into the restaurant.  When you enter the unmarked building, you step into a long disappearing corridor.  There is an automatic sliding door which surprises you near the end of the corridor.  The dcor is modern and minimalistic.  There is no tablecloth on the table, but as you will find out, there are many, many pillows that will show up throughout the dinner.  There are pillows for our bench seating.  There are little pillows upon which to rest your clean utensils.  There are even aromatic pillows that accompany a dish, releasing the fragrance of juniper as it slowly deflates sitting under the weight of the dish. Service is impeccable.  At least one waiter would stand unobtrusively in the background at all times to tend to our every need.  Our first course was a small, bite sized croquette.  When one of my dining partners and I joked that we were going to be disappointed if we needed to go out for steak after dinner, a waiter came by a minute later offering us bread.  When one of us started to fall behind in the 12 glass wine pairing, the sommelier started to pour less, and charged us proportionately less.   The dishes I loved the most were dishes that paired together interesting and contrasting tastes but were not overly fussed with.   For example, the first course called ""croquette"" was a small croquette with cream and a garnish of steelhead roe.  I wasn't impressed with the idea of a croquette, but when you pop it into your mouth, the crunchy crust quickly gives way to an unexpectedly tender, creamy interior, shortly before the luscious oily roe pops over it all.  A good start. Our second course was called ""octopus"" and consisted of a thin slice of octopus stacked with shiso flowers and papaya.  A small bowl of broth made from soy beans accompanied it.  The combination of flavors and textures was delicious, and the broth chaser complemented the octopus well. The dishes that I did not love, and even disliked, usually involved ingredients that were overly processed to the point where the attempt to extract the essence of the flavor resulted more often in ill tasting artificialness.  It was like you were eating a purple grape flavored candy as opposed to a fresh grape.  The worst dish representing this was a dish called ""short rib,"" which included Guinness beer, peanuts and fried broccoli.  Now, I absolutely adore short ribs and beer, so how could anyone mess this up?  Here's how.  The chunk of short rib sat under a translucent, square thin gelatin sheet, presumably made of the Guinness.  Bits of peanut and burned broccoli were scattered about the dish, along with mustard seeds.   What I love about beer is that refreshing, hoppy, cool liquid taste sliding down your throat, perhaps cleansing away the fatty short ribs you just ate.  Now take away the liquid, refreshing, tasty aspects of beer, and what you've got left is that gelatin sheet. The short rib lacked its usual rich, fatty, chewy texture and more resembled stewed meat.  Even the mustard seeds and burned broccoli had a monotonous, bitter taste.  Not all the dishes need to be great, but none of the dishes should be...bad. A disappointing surprise was that many of the dishes were over salted, killing whatever flavor was underneath.  For example, in a dish called ""hot potato,"" the warmth of the hot potato released the mouth watering aroma of a black truffle slice and contrasted nicely with the chill of a cold cream potato soup, but the whole dish was marred by the extreme saltiness of the soup. At first, we thought this was a fluke, but several dishes had the same problem.   On the plus side, all the meats, from the delicate seafood to the venison, were cooked perfectly.  Also, careful attention was paid to the texture of each element in the dishes, a dimension I find is often ignored in many restaurants.   Achatz' techniques show their strength in the desserts.  Almost a third of the courses could be considered desserts, which is more than I would have liked, but they all had interesting combination of tastes that worked well with each other.  I loved the bubble encapsulating sweet ginger liquid in one of the desserts, and I also loved the subtly flavored cube of shaved ice that contrasted with the creaminess of horchata pudding in another dessert. The wines we drank (One 12 glass wine pairing plus 2 bottles) were all good, though not remarkable.  The sommelier hinted as much when he mentioned that the wine was selected to complement the food, not dominate it.   Like the touristy dorks we are, we asked for Grant Achatz' autograph on our souvenir menu.   He graciously complied for all four of us: ""Thank You, Grant.""  Our total worked out to be $1200 before tip.  You're welcome.",0.9955,0.803,0.128,0.069,0.5534493284493285

From the time I walked into the door, everything was perfect.  Someone whisked my coat away before I even knew it- no ticket for the coat- yet somehow I knew they would find it when I was ready for it.  After being seated in the front room done in shades of gray and purple, we were reminded of the tasting that we chose (12 courses) and were asked if we wanted the basic wine pairings or the more obscure wine pairings.  We chose the basic (additional $95 per person) and were not disappointed.  There was an Italian Cabanon Bonarda that was absolutely my favorite wine of the night. We started with cold potato soup with a black truffle served like an oyster in a shell and were told to eat it in just that way.  The food was not only delicious, but I couldn't help wondering with each course how to eat it- challenging myself with options to see if I could come up with how they would suggest the ultimate enjoyment.  One of my favorite presentations was a pillow (yes, I said pillow) that was placed at each setting on the table that was filled with ""juniper air"".  The smell was amazing and perfectly complimented the duck that was served on it.  Or imagine small cubes of lamb on a hot stone with a sprig of fresh rosemary inserted into that stone.  The aromatic scent that was released from the rosemary perfectly complimented the lamb which was served 3 different ways.   Throughout the night, while we had a multitude of servers, all were well informed about each course and answered any questions that we had.  It was great service without any pretense.  They do  encourage men to wear jackets, however, only one of the men I was with had a jacket and the others were not made to feel uncomfortable- keep in mind this was on a Wednesday night- weekends might be different. If you are looking for a really special night out- this has to be it.  It's not a ""cheap date"" - we spent $1200 for 4 of us, but it was worth every penny.  I will definitely be back to see what other surprises this amazing chef dreams up.",0.9975,0.793,0.183,0.024,0.6443528693528695

While the restaurant provides a novel approach, full of science-meets-cooking gastronomy, the distinct flavors have the substance to ensure that the experience is not gimmicky.  Alinea has a vast wine list that is filled with treasures that are surprisingly (relatively!) reasonably priced at a fraction of the markup of many high end restaurants. Sadly, though, unless you're dining with a big party, it's pretty impracticable to limit yourself to a single full bottle for a meal that covers the entire spectrum of familiar flavors (plus some that are totally new to even well experienced first-timers.) We instead opted for the wine pairings which included about 12 half-glasses for the Tour menu and incorporated a few familiar and many obscure varietals. However, at least on this particular occasion, neither of us felt like the pairings were truly on, and got the impression that a lot of the wines were selected more for their gross margins than their compatibility.",0.9806,0.803,0.161,0.036,0.5385229138677414

2006-11-09,5.0,"Simply AMAZING.  What can I say that hasn't been said?  (Too much, I actually wrote twice as much as this but it was too large for Yelp!) First, the food...  Geniusly presented.  No matter what anyone might say, it really is unlike anything else.  We had the 24 course tour.  And what a tour it was.  Every course came in some unique fashion.  Everything was well thought out, the flavors melded together and contrasted perfectly.  The wine pairings were dead on.  Occasionally there was too much to know about what you were eating, and even after the waiter explained it for a good long minute, it was easy to forget parts of what was in everything.  That was part of the fun, though, because you could sit and really try to decipher everything, much like you might for a fine wine. Word of caution: a good amount of what Alinea is all about is surprise.  Is too much press a bad thing?  Possibly.  If you're planning to go, I wouldn't spend a lot of time reading reviews, looking at pictures, reading press articles.  It ruins some of the surprise and takes some of the fun away.  If you haven't been but plan to go, you might skip over the next few paragraphs and go straight to the end.  I feel as though I would have benefited slightly by knowing a little less prior to going. If Alinea had its own Academy awards, the awards from me would look something like this: Best sensual experience: Rabbit.  Brought to the table covered in a Autumn in a glass filled with the smoke of burning leaves; the waiter lifted the glass and lets the smoke waft.  It smelled and tasted amazing.   Best sweets: Crabapple, served with three gelatinous sauces: eucalyptus, olive oil (strangely interesting as a jellied sauce), and cheddar cheese.  Close second: some sort of puff encrusted foie gras (which we were told was a ""gift"" in order to make it ""legal"" in Chicago).   Most unexpected flavor: during the raspberry course, just when you thought it might be as expected, you bite into red pepper taffy that just pops out at you.  Perfectly melds together. Oddest method of eating:  Quince wrapped in prosciutto, served at the end of a long antennae.  When eating, your hands stay away and you bob your head in and eat it off the tip.  It reminded me of a sexual act and I just had to laugh at the time. Best savory tasting course: Either the rabbit or the squab. Best wine pairing:  There was a New Zealand Syrah that was among the most peppery and complex wines I've had. Most unusual ingredient: So many unusual ingredients (to most, at least).  Pickled huckleberry, squab, cured trout eggs from Michigan (supposedly 15 hours old), cask aged Belize maple syrup---Blis.  The restaurant was bustling with people.  There were a ton of people dining, and a ton of people working.  Everything was well partitioned, though. Service was good.  Somewhat robotic, but in a good way.  Somewhat casual, but in a ""not stuffy"" way--as opposed to a casual because we're lazy way.  We had 4 or 5 people who seemed to be serving us (we seemed to have two waiters, a few expeditors, sommelier for wine), but it still felt personal.  There was one minor service hiccup that was probably the result of too many people doing too much different stuff all at once; one of the waiters came to give us new glasses and take our glass of wine that was just freshly poured by another waiter less than a minute before.  We told him, and it was not a big deal at all.  The wait staff was willing to engage in conversation and even crack jokes, which is always welcomed by me.  Upon leaving, the waiter also led us to go inside the kitchen, which was also a nice treat. The food here is art, and many apparently feel the need to bring their cameras.  That's perfectly OK, but I wish everyone had enough respect for my $900 meal that they'd turn the flash off while taking pictures.     There were some great people watching opportunities.  Chico's was definitely in fashion for the women, many of the older women there were ber-stylish.  I'm not sure I agree that a ""jackets required"" policy for men is necessary for this type of restaurant.  There were a lot of men in unmatched blazers, and it just seemed unnecessary and too old school for such a cutting edge restaurant. The only question left somewhat unanswered in my eyes: is it really the #1 restaurant in the country--or even Chicago?   We pondered it while we were there, looking around, wondering ""could it be?""  I'm honestly not sure of it, but I'd put it at either #1 or #2 of the top dining experiences I've had (for those that are curious what the other contender would be, that would be Tru---but maybe that was exceptionally amazing to me given that we were in the semi-private dining room).  Alinea is a foodies paradise, and something everyone should experience.  It's definitely way up there in the rankings, and after going to a place like this most other restaurants will pale in comparison.",0.9995,0.769,0.197,0.033,0.4843216518930805

2006-10-07,5.0,"I suddenly remember...""hmm, I'm going to Chicago in 2 weeks with the girl to see her friend.  I wonder if there's a half chance in hell...nah...well, ok, let's try...""  11pm Pacific on a Saturday night I call, expecting to get reservations 2 weeks out at one of the most talked about restraunts in the US.  I'll get voicemail for sure. A woman's voice answers.  5 minutes of polite conversation later I'm shocked to realize I'll be dining at Alinea in 2 weeks.  While I'm familiar with dress code, etc at high end restraunts, the hostess didn't wait for me to ask, but offers info regarding seating arrangements, dress, and aks if I have other questions.  It's 1AM for her and she's being more polite and helpful than I could imagine. Responsorial for the next few days: ""I get to go to Alinea!!!!"" Reservation was for 9:30.  We arrive at the famed entrance, door slides open, and the hostess refers to me by name at first sight.  Nice touch. Girl wouldn't let me go with more than the 12 course option because of the time of night, but seeing as how we were there 'till nearly 1am, that's quite fine. The photos on the website are pretty much memorized - when the first course appears, I'm practically giddy just looking at it.  Not sure if it was due to time of night, or Chef heard we were from 2 timezones away, or what...but we ended up getting 3 extra courses tossed in during the night as gifts from the kitchen.  DIdn't see that happening at tables around me.  Overall, it is purely an experience you will find nowhere else. Beyond the food - the decor was a little bland, in my opinion.  If I just walked through, not knowing where I was, I would say things felt sterile.  Lighting, soemthing needs to change and provide just a tiny bit of mood.  The wait staff the night I was there were great, but not *quite* at the top of their game. Barely noticable. An interesting point I want to bring up, which I don't think others mentioned.  When I returned home and told others of my meal, several of my friends were shocked that I'd dare to spend $700 on dinner for 2 (yes. with tip. Be prepared and bring your Visa).  I guess I thought they were a little more of a foodie like I am, and they'd appreciate/understand.  One friend was short of insulted, partially due to the price, partially due to me paying a chef to ""play"" with food, when so many out there are hungry and can get nothing.  In her eyes it seemed to be totally wasteful, egregious.  I think I was as shocked that she had this viewpoint as she was that I indulged. I would very very very happily indulge again.  25 courses next time please!",0.9935,0.848,0.124,0.028,0.4580092592592593
2006-10-06,3.0,"We went to Alinea last night, which completes our trio of experimental dining (Moto, WD-50 in New York, and now.. Alinea).  I have to say... Alinea is great.  The entrance is really cool, the service is what you would expect, and the food is excellent.  Achatz is indeed a genius, but in the end... the experience isn't really that memorable.  I feel like he cut his teeth at Trio, and is delivering interesting, but not amazing food, in an interesting but not amazing space.  What I would say tho.. is if you're going to spend $450+ on dinner for two... and you've got one place to go in Chicago, we'd still go to Moto.  Achatz's food is interesting, but not amazing... which when you're dropping that sort of cash, you need to be able to walk away and remember your experience for months to come.  At Moto we had exactly that... both for the service and food.  So... if you haven't been to Moto, I'd go there first... if you have... Alinea is great, but it won't be quite as fantastic.",0.967,0.795,0.152,0.052,0.6094497607655504
2006-08-22,5.0,"We had the 12 course tasting and were blown away at how inventive each course was.  First up was a semifreddo of coconut and corn, with teeny tiny accents of lime zest, cayenne, and another savory flavor which escapes my memory.  WOW.  Some diners might be put off on the constant instruction on how to eat (in this course I was told to eat it all in one bite, which I misunderstood to eat in small bites!), where to place the used or unused utensils, etc.  I think the servers mean well, though the instructions are part of a script.  I won't be able to recall every course but will bring you the highlighs.  Our favorites were a fried puff of langostine with lychee, ginger, and vacherine served on a fragrant vanilla bean, like a popsicle.  This course, like others, had a custom-made serving contraption (for lack of better words!), as does the applewood smoked bacon and butterscotch, which is served on a wire trapeze.  We adored the hot potato- cold potato (reviewed by another Yelper below) and the watermelon dusted with cocoa, Kobe beef, with pickled watermelon and fennel reduction.  Too bad that I didn't write this review this weekend, with every course fresh in my memory!",0.9497,0.834,0.123,0.043,0.6458333333333333
2006-08-16,5.0,"I think I'd better write a Yelp review on this baby even though I went there just over a year ago.  Wow.  Just, wow.  From the non-descript exterior, to the minimalist art in the foyer, to the comfortable chairs, the atmosphere was just right.  My friend and I decided that this would be the ultimate in our food adventurings.  We were right.  We tried the 12 course menu and each item was like a tiny work of art.  My favorites included a carrot ravioli with a coconut powder filling served in a lobster consommee with lobster chunks and a lobster cracker and a tiny bison filet wrapped in potato strings and flash fried and served with a spice gel cube, pistachios and pistachio puree.  Our server was friendly and informative.  We went on a little tour of the restaurant after our meal, and then wandered dazed onto the dark sidewalk clutching our souvenir menus.  An experience well worth every penny.",0.9794,0.813,0.176,0.01,0.6193877551020408
2006-06-29,5.0,"I went during the first month or so of the opening, getting extremely lucky to get in on a Sunday night with just a phone call. I don't know how to review this place. This was hands down the best meal of my life, if I can even call it a meal. It was more like a religious experience.  Some of the more memorable dishes...granola rolled inside a very thin tube of fruit leather that has been hardened to the point where it can crack. This is served over a creamy nut-based ""yogurt"". You crack the granola tube into the yogurt to produce wonderfully crunchy glasslike shards. The textures were very interesting. Another one that I really loved was a 'spongecake' which involved a piece of very light spongecake on the end of a vanilla bean used as a spoon to eat some sort of fruit foam and dehydrated fruit bits. Again excellent combinations of unusual textures really added to the experience.   Grant Achatz is a true artist.

2006-06-27,5.0,This place it a lot like Tru (but not quite as good).  Still a very upscale restaurant and very much worth trying.  They have very unique ways of serving your dishes here.  We went two times and both times we were very impressed.  The chef here and at Tru both started out in Evanston at Trio (which is now closed).  My first date with my fiance was at Trio 9 years ago and it was an experience that I never had until that day.  Definitely would recommend trying Alinea for a unique experience.,0.9056,0.862,0.138,0.0,0.5481481481481482
2006-06-21,5.0,"The most expensive meal in my life...and somehow one of the best values in my life.  How can that be?  The drama of merely entering the restaurant is enough to take your breath away, and then the service, calm and sophisticated ambience, little gee-whiz gadgets and tricks, and the food, oh the food....  We were not able to get reservations for the tour, 25 courses or so.  But our 12 course tasting was more than plenty at $125 a pop for the food, and I think that once he rotates through some new dishes I will go back for the easier on the wallet 8 course.  We did the wine pairing, which they say is around 2/3 the cost of the food.  My math says that $90 compared with $125 is more like 3/4ths, but who's counting at a place like this.  The wines were just as memorable as the food, and I strongly recommend that you a) go for the wine pairings, or at least some of them, and b) make sure you're taking a cab afterwards.  How so much flavor can be packed into single bites, and then how I can get so richly full from these single bites, will always be a mystery.  I could go through the highlights, but that would require walking through all 12 dishes.  Only one that I'll mention as such a surprise was the Kobe beef with teriyaki reduction, cucumber, and...melon?  Who in the world says to themselves, ""Hmm...what goes well with Kobe beef?  Oh, I know, honeydew melon of course!""  Genius.  Like many foodies-in-training, I seek value.  Alenia is a place that proves that ridiculously, guilt-inducing prices can sometimes still be a value when it buys 3 or 4 hours of food perfection.",0.9917,0.827,0.159,0.014,0.5396284271284271
2006-03-21,5.0,"A night at Grant Achat's Alinea ranks as one of the best meals of my life.  Everything about this meal was exquisite - from the service, to the atmosphere, to the food.  The French style service is extremely attentive and classy and our sommelier was very knowledgeable and chatty as we made our way through the wine paring.   Be aware that the wine can drive an already large bill into the stratosphere especially as the sommelier will occasionally ""upsell"" you to a more offbeat wine.  We spent $500 (without tip) for two people on the 12 course meal with wine pairings and 2 ""upsells"".  I don't regret either of the occasions I chose his alternate recommendations - both were fantastic and unusual styles of familiar grapes - a Pinor Noir and a Grenache. They seem to have simplified the menu the taste (12 courses) and the tour (22-26 courses).  We rolled out of there after a mere 12 courses in 4 1/2 hours.  According to our waiter, the 24-ish course meal could take anywhere from 2 1/2 hours (chefs) to 7 1/2 hours (whew). The entire meal contained elements of drama that targets all the senses and you'll never be short of conversation (however long your meal is) as Chef Achat gives you plenty to talk about as he leads you though this spectacular 12 act culinary show. Some of the dramatic highlights: Hot Potato (cold potato, black truffle, and parmesan).  Our first dish came in a miniature bowl with a skewer stuck through the side of the bowl on which a cold potato ball, a sliver of black truffle, and parmesan were suspended over the bowl.  Our waiter instructed us to remove the skewer allowing everything to drop into a cold potato soup, which we then knocked back like a decadent shot. Lamb (akudjura, nicoise olive, eucalyptus veil).  Our waiter sat a large bowl full of warm eucalyptus leaves in front of us.  Nestled in the middle of this fragrant and beautiful bowl was a skewer with a cube of lamb and an olive on it. Duck (persimmon, onion, pillow of mace air).  Easily the most dramatic dish.  A cloth pillow filled with mace scented air was placed in front of each of us and a dish with duck confit, duck breast and fois gras was placed on top.  As we dug into this dish the air was slowly released from the pillow mixing with the food smells and leading us to visions of Alinea branded mace spray for linens.  UPDATE: Check out the review in Wired:  wired.com/wired/archive/…",0.9682,0.913,0.071,0.017,0.5439645625692137
