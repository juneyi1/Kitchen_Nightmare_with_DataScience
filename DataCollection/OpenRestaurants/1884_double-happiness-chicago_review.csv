2016-12-30,5.0,"My thanks to all the dedicated Yelpers and homegrown Chicagoans that brought DH the attention it deserves. Had overlooked it 20+ years we've been in Chicago because we were solely judging it as a bakery.  Greasy tables? No, just old (but clean). Grab a seat and the staff will provide you a menu if you aren't a regular or already know what you want.  A variety of noodle soup dishes are available so don't feel you'll be locked in by this specialty menu. Get the broth on the side if you're going to dress it up (highly recommended) with the toppings at the table. (My fav - that garlic sesame? topping). You can keep your noodles dry with your toppings at that point, or add as much broth you'd like in terms of flavor.  On our first visit, we also got the radish cake omelet (pickle radish), the fried shrimp roll, and fried dough (for soup broth).  It is a smallish place and for now, it seems the balance is just right...just enough open tables so that there isn't a line.",0.8677,0.91,0.072,0.018,0.38638694638694643

2007-12-21,3.0,"So why is this little tiny, dumpy place still open after 10+ years?   They don't have a nice front, they don't have nice chairs or tables.  They DO serve some of the best Chinese-Vietnamese noodle soup you ever had.  Asians always make the best noodle soups.  The crowds during the morning and afternoon during the week will tell you why.   SOUP - In any soup place, the test of the soup is the broth.  If you try a noodle soup and you try the broth alone, you can tell how the rest of the food is going to be made.  The soup here is relatively clear (important), but has a nice rich pork flavor to it.  You notice there is no hint of MSG, soy, additional salt or too many herbs.  This is because too much of these mask the flavor of the broth.  The broth here is made with pork bones, and skimmed in the cooking process to remove the impurities.  What's left is a rich, semi clear tasty broth that makes noodles dance with flavor.   WHAT TO ORDER - The soup consists of a clear broth, noodles (thin or thick rice noodles, egg noodles, or mix of both), a heap of nicely seasoned cooked ground pork, shrimp, squid, roasted garlic and cilantro.  Menus are in English so read carefully.  They have one also with shrimp wontons too (man, that's good if you are hungry).   Fried Radish Cake with Egg - This is a really tasty alternative to eating an omelet.  It is a nice starchy omelet with no hint of radish at all.  Eat this with the hot sauce (sriracha). Vietnamese Steam Roll with ground pork - 4 steamed rice eggrolls with cooked seasoned ground pork with fresh herbs and a light sweet sauce.  Pour the whole thing over the top and eat with a spoon. Shrimp Roll - your standard deep fried shrimp sausage (all shrimp) with a sweet sour sauce.  It satisfies the fried craving you might have.  Good, not great. Chinese fried bread - Chinese version of doughnut.  Good stuff, but filling. Ice coffee - This is your standard Vietnamese ice coffee (Cafe DuMonde) with condensed milk, but cold or hot and no waiting.  THIS is what Starbuck charges you 5 bucks for, here it's 1.  You will get buzzed, so watch it. Everything else, I would give it a try, but the stuff above I know is good.  Of the condiments, try the roasted garlic, the hot peppers in vinegar, peanuts and anything else.  Everything is good, but taste before you put.   WHAT NOT TO ORDER: Meatball (siu mai) - flavored, steamed pork meatball, no wrapper, uninteresting, not that tasty. CAVEATS - No parking and desserts.  And again, all the asian desserts have to do more with sticky texture, coconut milk and tapioca.  If you don't mind that, go to town! The owners speak english, but just bear with them and the accent. PRICE - Very reasonable, but you will figure about $10/person with soup and a drink and tip.  If you get more, up it.
