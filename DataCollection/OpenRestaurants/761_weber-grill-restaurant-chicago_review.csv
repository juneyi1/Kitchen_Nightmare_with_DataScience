2017-09-03,2.0,"Seeing the big grill on the side of the building is a great eye catcher and it drew our attention there for dinner on a Saturday night. I like that we could make a reservation, which we did. We arrived 30min early, was given our buzzer and went to hang out by the grill area. Pretty cool (and entertaining) that you can watch the chefs cooking on the grills feet away from where you stand. Seated just short of our reservation time, initial order taken and our drinks came a few minutes later. The crab cake starter was terrible. It was not hot, not warm. Room temp at best. We asked for another and the redo was much better. The salmon salad arrived just as described in the menu but I would recommend they grill the salmon more before serving. Grill marks are cool! The pork chop was cooked nicely and the glaze was a good match. I will continue with my Weber grill at home...but likely not visit the restaurant again.",0.9719,0.835,0.154,0.011,0.5449999999999999

2017-07-26,2.0,"Lost it's luster I think. Overall fine for food. BBQ chicken was OK although would have expected a more rendered skin that was crispy, seeing as it was ""cooked on a Weber grill"". Alas it was not, skin was fatty and squishy, but will credit a moist meat, even the breast.  Service was spotty, no bread, no silverware, beers took a seemingly inordinate amount of time to receive.  Highly warn against sitting in the first 5 to 6 booths inside the restaurant. The smoke billowing from the grills was virtually unbearable. In addition, the noise of the cooks clanking plates and tongs and yelling back and forth to each other made it impossible to hold a conversation with my dining partner. Cute idea to have the kitchen ""in the restaurant"", but it is really a disservice to the dining guests and ventilation needs significant improvement. This location is NOTHING like the Schaumburg location that I've been to numerous times.

We booked our reservations 6 months in advance. We went tonight and we were very disappointed. We waited 25 minutes after our reservation time to be seated. Our server brought a water carafe and 1 ice tea. It took 40 minutes to get our order. The 2 kid's meals were missing tater tots and she said they would be coming(they never did).

He said we could have a free dessert(which we did). We had to ask for water refills and a tea refill.  She never checked to see how we were doing. The ribeye was really much fattier than I am used to. The New York strip was tasty.  The whole experience was not up to Weber Grill standards. When we were finished we told her that she had been missing in action during our dinner- she became defensive and said it was only her 2nd week  working there. I blame the management for not training their staff adequately.  When our bill arrived it stated that we got the asparagus for $6.50  we questioned her as the green beans were $5.00 she said they were both $6.50. I found a menu and she was incorrect. It wasn't really that big a deal and we decided not to worry about it which was easy as we never saw her again.

Unfortunately, I didn't get my basket of pretzel rolls with the cheddar butter, which are so amazing. I ordered a half slab of ribs. The ribs were definitely cooked slow, as the meat fell off the bone easily, perhaps a little too easily. The consistency of the BBQ sauce was rather thick but it complemented the spice of the ribs well. The ribs were served with a side of garlic mashed potatoes and green beans. Their mashed potatoes are already flavorful, the green beans were part for the course, I needed to add some salt and pepper. For dessert, I had the raspberry swirl cheesecake, a very pleasant surprise. I'm not a big fan of graham cracker crusts, but this one was light and didn't overpower the rest of the cheesecake.

2017-04-04,3.0,"The concept here is exactly what you might guess, with the majority of items cooked on actual weber grills in the kitchen. Most are charcoal driven, although a couple are gas. The main room is long and narrow, with booths along one side and an open kitchen along the other. Despite this, it's not noisy, and had a nice woody/clubby feel to it. Our server was bubbly and informative, and made the dining experience a pleasant one. We started with Caesar salads, which were excellent. Since it was lunch time I had the Wisconsin Burger, essentially a bacon cheeseburger with all the fixings, served on a pretzel bun. The patty had a nice char to it, as you would expect, and was cooked to a perfect medium rare. Unfortunately, despite this, the meat seemed somewhat dry and flavorless. I was also not a fan of the relatively flavorless bun, and discarded it before it could self-destruct. My companion had the half pizza and salad combo. The pizza is a bit odd, with a very thick crust that has been grilled. On top of that were slices of whole tomatoes and melted mozzarella cheese, and some basil leaves. Although it wasn't what she was expecting, she liked it except for the crust.

We waited for our food and was informed that the restaurant was out of hot dog buns.  This would not have been an issue except for the fact that we were informed right before our food was to come out.   So my son had to wait even longer for his food.  Once our food arrived none of the servers came by to check and see if we needed anything or how our food was. We ordered drinks and might have had another if asked.  While we were eating we noticed other customers food waiting to be delivered to their table.  A number of servers walked by the food with out checking to see if the food was ready togo. Finally the cook had to wave down a server to take the food after it had been sitting for over 10 minutes.  Finally the kids meal came with a cookie.  When the cookies came to the table they were hard as a rock.  My son made a comment to the server and his response was we made them earlier in the day.  He suggested we put the cookie in the microwave.... As a service point of view that was horrible.  I understand we were at the restaurant around closing time but that was no excuse for the poor service.

2016-07-07,4.0,"Weber Grill has a restaurant???   That was my first thought when friends of mine suggested we go here during my trip to Chicago.  The plus is that it was a block away from my hotel.  Friendly greeting when we walked in and my friends suggested we sit at the bar....the grill bar....and watch the cook on these humongous Weber grills! Our server, Sean, was great!  Attentive without being intrusive...and patient with our already tipsy selves.  When I said it was our first time here, he went out of his way to make sure our experience was enjoyable.  The only thing I'd complain about is the flavored iced tea.  Other than that, it's about the bar-b-q, which is inside...Woo-Hoooo! I started with a jumbo shrimp cocktail, pretty standard, but good.  For dinner, I ordered a full rack of ribs with beans and slaw.  The most tender, fall off the bone, ribs I've eaten in a while.  Bones came off clean!  No fighting, except for the end ribs which usually get a little on the char side, which I'm fine with.  Delicious beans!!!  I would've had double beans but I needed some vegetables, and the cole slaw was decent.  One of my friends had the bistro steak which was cooked perfectly.  My other friends had the burgers, and one agreed that the ribs were excellent and she should've gotten them. I enjoyed dinner so much, I came back for lunch.  The menu is slightly different, and instead of a full rack, I had the combo ribs, grilled sausage, and smoke meatloaf.  All were very good, except I got the end part of the ribs, so a little bit of a challenge.  I really liked the meatloaf, which was different.  They also don't serve the shrimp cocktail during lunch.  We shared a Cesar salad and they split it into two bowls....nice!  Good wine list!  Chatting with our server, he had a pretty busy morning and looked a little tired but was courteous and attentive.  I will definitely come back the next time I'm in Chicago!",0.9977,0.728,0.238,0.034,0.5607671957671958

Ironically, this pretty empty restaurant had us wait so they could set up our table. Set up with a reservation? I wish I could say this was the only unpleasant part of our visit. Waiting became the name of the game. There seemed to be lots of staff. I'm not sure what they were doing with their time. Our drinks took a good 15 minutes to get to our table. The meal, simple burgers and salads took close to an hour. We had 3 kids with us. The littlest one is 2. That's a very long time to wait. Again I just can't understand the long wait. Almost empty restaurant and lots of help.  The food was good. But sadly there wasn't one apology for our wait. We left after 3pm.  Not sure if I'll return.

2016-07-03,4.0,The BBQ here was amazing. I got the combo with ribs and smoked sausage. They had tons of flavor and the added sauce only highlighted the meat.

Our waiter took the burned item off our check.  We were floored that the manager on duty did not bother to stop by our table. He seemed more concerned with trying to shut down early.  I guess that's why our food sucked.  The only reason they get 2 stars instead of 1 was because our waiter was excellent.

For silverware. Now the experience at the bar was good.  The cocktail server was awesome.  The drinks were not cheap but I wouldn't expect that.  The appetizer we had were onion strings that were crispy.  The rest of the food I ate was so salty.   I might try it when it comes to St Louis but I won't be rushing to try this place.  It was not terrible just underwhelming food....add the busy night with bad service... nothing could take my attention away from that.,0.6469,0.894,0.063,0.044,0.5321844293272864

The new york strip steak was just ok, a little bit too raw to my liking and the taste was kinda bland. The mashed potatoes were good though. As for the mixed grill, the filet mignon was a bit salty and overcooked as we asked for medium. The salmon was also a bit overcook. The entree was kinda disappointing. Lastly for dessert, we got all three of them to try. The chocolate bundt cake was really rich and delicious pretty, reminded me of molted lava cake with ice cream on the side.

The only vegetables that appeared to be grilled in it were the red bell peppers, and the entire thing came drenched in a flavorless oil. If it was supposed to be balsamic vinaigrette, they must not have shaken it at all before dumping a ton of it on the salad, because it was all oil.

The bistro was a nice smaller meal and had the nice grilled flavor.  My kids like the pretzel rolls with butter.  They have a nice kids menu.

2015-11-06,5.0,"I have a story about the best steak I have ever eaten and it all begins in Chicago. Weber Grills are exceptional. I own one at home. So, I knew while in Chicago it was a must-stop for me. By the way, if you have some time and are local, take up one of their classes or stop in for a souvenir for friends and family. It is the mecca for those grill enthusiasts you have on your gift list. During my last night out in Chicago, I wanted to make sure I had a nice dinner and heard some great blues music. So, of course, strolling down the main mecca of food, the strip, I knew we were going to find something amazing to eat. Spotting the large red weber grill protuding out of the side of the brick building made it even more eye-catching. Strolling by and observing those eating on these filling plates in the window was enough to make me check out their menu. After seeing quite a few options, we opted to go in for dinner.  One of the best spots, in my opinion, is sitting near the kitchen, often a bar-type counter seating where you can watch the magic happen. It is like dinner and a show in one, and I loved every part of it. Sitting down, we ordered drinks from the bar while trying to figure out what to have for dinner. Their menu boasts tons of amazing options for any meat-eater to have an option every day of the week to come and try something new. Considering the portions were so large, we opted to share and add a side to our meal, which ended up working out perfectly. I have been eating steak a long time, but when you find the best of the best, you cannot help but shout out how amazing it really was. Not only can I tell you how great it was, I can even verify the way it was cooked. Weber Grill has these massive sized grills that use actual charcoal and wood chips to make an amazing cook top for their steaks. With the hot temperatures and skilled chefs, every meal is an art form. From their signature seasonings to their over-sized grills, you will never have a disappointing meal. When cutting into this steak, it was like cutting butter, smooth and easy. Each bite was better than the one prior and our sides were fresh, homemade mashed potatoes and asparagus, cooked to perfection. Our plates were empty but our bellies were full. Satisfied and happy with the entire experience, we left wishing we lived in Chicago simply to have this place nearby. After telling a couple of our friends of this great experience back home, when they went to Chicago and dined here they agreed this was one of the best meals they ever had in Chi-town!",0.9986,0.777,0.204,0.019,0.557925556586271

Enter Weber Grill - good selection of entrees that we ordered something other than our planned steak ...we ordered Parmesan crusted tilapia , steak kabobs, and 1/2 rack of ribs. And boy were they great! The ribs were fall off the bone delicious, I didn't even need to smother sauce all over them. The tilapia had a light crust of Parmesan , the fish was moist and flaky . Kabobs glorious!! You get a choice of sides and we chose broccoli , garlic mashed potatoes ( light garlic taste) , green beans, rice. Again great tasting.  The Caesar salad was good. Why is it all steak houses have that mood lighting? Well so does Weber but it certainly isn't to hide anything. The place is clean,  The ambience is casual, a bit retro in decor . The restaurant is huge, so there was no wait,we were led directly to our table.( and the place was busy) .Part of the dining experience is the server.

I chose the rib eye steak w/ blue cheese and herbs, mac and cheese and a lobster tail (for $15 how can you say no!).   The steak was cooked perfectly and had so much flavor.

Next was the sampler with ribs, shrimp, chicken, and some kind of teriyaki beef kebab. Everything was ""cut with a fork"" tender, and nothing remained when we were done. The chicken was especially tender, so much that it was difficult to believe. You want to order the pork chops, seriously. If you are ever in doubt, they are the best pork chops I have ever encountered. Thick and juicy instead of dry and with the smoked flavor you would expect. Combine that with some sweet potatoes that are incredible and you will eat until you hurt. The salmon was cooked perfectly and has great flavor, but I think everything was overshadowed by the pork chops. Crab cakes were not impressive. Though I'm used to crab cakes from Maine so I might have higher standards.  Sides: green beans are covered in some combo of buttery garlicky goodness.

2015-08-19,2.0,"Tip:  Only go here if you're from out of town, NOT Chicago! This was a mixed bag for me and a friend of mine recently when we went there for lunch the other day.  One of the problems we both agreed upon was the service we got from our waiter, more like the lack of service.  He started out friendly, in that fake-nice sort of way, but when he took both our order's it kind of went downhill from there.  I think he was miffed we didn't order any cocktails, just water.  Whenever I look at the prices on a menu (and I'm paying) I'm always mindful of how much everything costs.   Since the entrees are in the $16+ range I usually skip the drinks because that almost doubles the bill, here they (drinks) are in the $10+ range.  Honestly, if I wanted specialty cocktails I would've gone to a classier restaurant in the surrounding area, which by the way there are plenty of.  Weber is more of a steak house, that attracts mostly a tourist clientele. Next, I ordered the beef brisket smothered with hickory BBQ sauce and my friend ordered a hamburger and cole slaw.  Mine came with 2 sides, I chose the bourbon baked beans and garlic mashed potatoes.  Some of the brisket was moist and flavorful and some was dry, I could've done without the hickory BBQ sauce too because it tasted like it came out of a bottle, the garlic mashed potatoes were unusually excellent and the beans were okay, didn't taste any bourbon in it though.  My friend ordered her burger medium-well and she said it was overcooked, kind of dry.  Her coleslaw was okay though. After being served our meals our waiter did a Houdini on us...poof gone! I believe he decided he wasn't going to make as much on us because we didn't order the drinks and didn't over-order on the food.  I dare anyone reading this to say they're not adding up in their head how much their tip is going to be? When we were finished, I don't even remember if he offered us dessert, no matter, he quickly brought over the check.  When I didn't pay it right away, or should I say, when he was ready for me to pay, he completely ignored us, finding better things to do, like schmoozing with the table next to us in that fake-nice way of his. I finally had enough and went to the front desk to ask the personable greeter to take care of the situation and she made him stop goofing around and take the bill.  Thanks greeter! Do you think I tipped him 20%?  No. For less than stellar service, he got less than 10%, which was more than generous considering the brush-off we received. Oh...one last thing, as we were leaving I looked back and bingo our waiter magically appeared  again and raced over to our table to get his tip.   I'm sure he was disappointed, but no more than us!!",0.9941,0.819,0.136,0.045,0.4712400793650793

Very obvious. We started with a brilliant pretzel tasting roll. It was a hit. The waiter missed my salad order and then had to remove it from the bill much to his disappointment.

No smiles from staff. 9pm came around and they wanted to kick us out of the table to make room for another booking. Needless to say they tried to squeeze us in another table and then sent us to the bar where there was no room to sit and a high traffic area for waiters carrying food and people arriving.

No later than a minute, a hostess asks me when my friends are coming and if they were going to be long. That alone was unusual.  Two minutes later, no over exaggeration, another hostess begins to grill me again. ""Are they All coming?"" ""When are they come g?"" ""How long will it take them?""

I called one of my friends to fill him in as he begins to apologize when he didn't need to. It wasn't his fault, I've been there for only about 5 minutes. Right after I hung up the short call with him once again they begin to grill me!!! By this time I was firm with them and made it clear to them with facial expressions and all that what they're doing wasn't right. She asked me the same questions and I told her once again, that it's a large group of people who are coming from an area that's a 5 min walk by car! Also I told her to keep in mind yen large group is is a large group and that obviously they'll come in two separate cars. Mind you, my table was ready cause I saw them set it up and they did not seat me or any of my friends who came from the first group down! Rude and strange service!

I knew that Weber Grill wouldn't have their kettle grills up and running at 7:00 AM but I sure was curious to try their breakfast. First, I must commend the servers. They were fantastic. I was delivered a carafe of water immediately followed by coffee and orange juice. I ordered a Western Omelet the first day and it was fine. However, the next day I was astonished with the French toast served with caramelized bananas and a side of sausage links. Outstanding! My last day I knew I needed more caramelized bananas so I tried them on pancakes with bacon on the side. Really a fine start to the day.

2015-02-23,3.0,"To be totally honest, I've only been to Weber Grill twice, but after having gone two times I can definitely tell you they excel in their bread (oh my, those pretzel buns.), their fish (surprisingly over their meat!), and their desserts.  Getting a table never seems to be that difficult which is nice since it seems to be a ritzier establishment, and the wait staff is always prompt, ready, and happy to take care of you.  In fact, when they brought out their signature pretzel rolls on my second visit the waiter immediately noticed they were cold and brought us new ones right away without a moment's hesitance.  That's the type of service I'm talking about! The one fatal flaw that's awfully ironic for Weber Grill is that I've never had a good steak here in either of my two visits.  Whether it was a ribeye or the petit filet mignon, on both occasions the meat was severely undercooked.  Maybe it's my fault for enjoying a medium rare - medium cook on a steak, but on both visits the meat was pretty much blue and mooing in the center.  Seasoning was all right, but ultimately it's not that sort of grill flavor or temperature I look for in my meat.   On the other hand, I've had scallops and salmon here before which were both pretty much spot on with their cooking!  How crazy that a grillmaster's restaurant in the US be excellent with fish instead of your staple midwest beef.  Finally and arguably most importantly, the best dishes I've ever had at Weber Grill were their desserts.  On the first visit I had a pumpkin creme brulee that I can still taste to this day.  The flavors were spicy and robust, but still had that luscious creaminess of a good cooked custard and a wonderful crack of the caramelized sugar on top.  Ludicrously divine.  On the second visit it was a s'mores. molten. lava. cake.  Yes, you read that right - a graham cracker toasted marshmallow dark chocolate fondant that anyone would absolutely die for.  One spoon into the cake and it just volcanically erupted with melted chocolate goodness.  It was indulgent and sinful and everything I'd want in a chocolate dessert. 10/10. Would I go back to Weber Grill again?  Absolutely.  Would I order meat again?  Probably not.  Would I go just for dessert?  Damn straight I would.",0.9933,0.718,0.187,0.095,0.6334151620736985

It was our party's mistake not to make a reservation on a Saturday night-- we were told the wait would be over an hour. The bar area was packed with parties waiting to be seated, but we were able to snag a high top in the bar area (first come first serve and they serve the full menu here) and order some drinks and appetizers while we waited for our table.  About an hour and a half later we were seated. I'm not a huge steak lover, so I decided to go for the ground beef option and stick with a classic burger. For a restaurant that specializes in beef, I thought this would be a safe choice. The burger wasn't bad, but it definitely wasn't great, especially for a steaakhouse and I ended up picking off of the BBQ from the other plates at the table.  We walked past the kitchen on the way to our table. You could see the cooks grilling on giant Weber Grills (hence the name). But I did see giant plates of onion rings and french fries sitting under heat lamps. NOT COOL! The fries tasted like they had been sitting out for a while. The mixed BBQ platter seemed like a good idea if you wanted to try brisket, ribs, and chicken. Even though there were three types of meat on the plate, it was not that much food. The ribs were TINY. However, the side were yummy--A+ for baked beans. I wouldn't really recommend this place to anyone coming from out of town.

First it was crowed but wouldn't think different for a Saturday night. They allowed us to make call ahead reservations which is great! One we got there we waited about 20-30 min.  I loved the decor; it was dimly lit with a mix of modern and old fasion. It was very loud so if your looking for a quite place to take your significant other, this is not the place. The restaurant is very long, which made a trip to the bathroom a little adventurous. I have no problem with this but someone with mobility issues may.   The rolls brought to the table for everyone to share were like pretzel rolls. Very tasty! I ordered the sirloin steak which came with fries. There are no vegetables with the dinner. If you wanted them you had to order them in addition to your meal. For the pricey dinner you would think this would be included. The food came with potholders and the waiter said, ""be careful, it's very hot!"" I grabbed a fry and it was cold... And so was the steak. I asked the waiter to please warm up as I showed him with my bare hands how cool it was. When he brought it back the steak was hot but the fries cold. At this point I didn't tell him because I had people waiting for me to finish.  Which brings me to how slow he was. Nice guy but we were there for over two hours after we were seated!  I should also add that my friends ordered one kind of soup but got another instead. The waiter came rushing over to the table after they started to eat it to tell them. He said ""they"" didn't tell him they changed the special. It's a good thing they didn't have an allergy!  I wanted a little dessert but everything came with ice cream except for chocolate chip cookies.

2014-10-19,5.0,"I didn't know what to expect when I sat down, but boy, was I taken on culinary journey like no other. The Weber Grills they use in the restaurants are probably 5 times larger than the one you have in your backyard with temperatures soaring to over 500 degrees. Apart from a few salamanders (broilers), everything is done on the grill. After we sat down, they made me a life-long patron when the server brought over a basket of pretzel rolls. They were perfect with a glazed brown outside and soft, fluffy interior. Butter is good, but beer cheese butter is even better! I couldn't stop eating it. Weber Firestarter Sampler includes Weber's Hickory BBQ Ribs, Grilled Honey Dijon Chicken Skewers, Lemon Garlic Shrimp, and Grill-Seared Steak Skewers. The skirt steak skewers were tender and cooked to a perfect medium rare. The seasoning was teriyaki and I appreciated that it wasn't too sweet. The pork ribs were fall-off-bone delicious. The sauce was caramelized and tasted like meat candy. One of the best baby back ribs I've ever had! The shrimp was grilled to perfection with the garlic butter flavor contrasting nicely with the sweet Mexican Brown Shrimp flavor. Rating: 5/5 Delmonico Ribeye is hand-cut, boneless, aged 28 days, and served with roasted garlic mashed potatoes. The steak is Midwestern raised, USDA Black Angus Beef. I decided to go with a bleu cheese crust. I love my steaks cooked ""Black and Blue"" which means searing on the flame just enough for a good char while leaving the interior very rare and cool. West of the Rockies, the term ""Pittsburgh"" is used for this doneness. You learn something every day. The aging process also brings more flavor and tenderness. Chef Jose trains his kitchen staff on the rigors of the grill. They execute the grilling process like a ballroom dancing. If you go up to their exhibition kitchen, you'll see the staff move back and forth from the grill in perfect rhythm as the flames dance on the grill. The bleu cheese crust was perfect for this cut of steak. It added a creamy, yet tangy flavor to bring more the sweetness out of the beef. Rating: 5/5 Weber Grill has special menus from time to time. Twin Lobster Tails were on the menu. The lobster tails were grilled to perfection and surprisingly not overdone or rubbery. The lobster meat was sweet and juicy on its own and the clarified butter wasn't needed. The broccoli was steamed and retained its beautiful bright green vibrance along with its inherent crispness. The grilled corn on the cob was sweet, no butter needed. It had just enough char on it with the husks pulled into a decorative knot, showing attention-to-presentation detail. Rating: 5/5 Just in case you need another side for your dinner, the Grill-Roasted Beets with goat cheese, and candied pecans are fantastic! The beets were tender and sweet. They balanced perfectly with the creamy goat cheese and candied pecans added a crunchy texture. The size is definitely for sharing! Rating: 5/5 No matter how hard I tried, we couldn't leave without trying dessert. S'mores Molten Chocolate Cake is topped with toasted marshmallow, graham crackers, and served a la mode with vanilla bean ice cream. The cake was very dense with rich, dark chocolate flavor. Chocolate ""lava"" flowed out like a volcano vent and became a rich, velvety chocolate sauce. The marshmallow crème brûlée matched perfectly like an adult version of this favorite campfire treat.  The vanilla bean ice cream tasted like homemade and had tons of vanilla bean specks throughout. Rating: 5/5 Crème Brûlée is seasonally inspired. Ours was topped with raspberries and white chocolate shavings. It was perfectly creamy, custardy, and brûléed on top. The raspberries and white chocolate were a nice touch. Rating: 5/5",0.9995,0.727,0.235,0.038,0.5600403124212647

2014-10-15,1.0,"I don't normally review restaurants based on carry out orders, but I don't believe my experience would have been any different had we dined in.  The request was simple: could we get an order of the roasted beets without the goat cheese and the candied  pecans. We were told that that was not possible. The chef would not serve the beets without the cheese and the pecans. So we asked if they could be served on the side. We were told no. We could get goat cheese and pecans on the side but not the beets without goat cheese and pecans. So we said fine: forget the order of beets. We  placed the rest of our order. It arrived. Orders were competently prepared.  And guess what was in the bag ---a side  order of goat cheese and a side order of pecans. There were no beets.  I am amazed that a chef at the Weber Grill thought himself so high and mighty that he couldn't simply roast the beets and agree to refrain from sprinkling them with cheese and pecans. That he would take offense at someone making a special request. we weren't asking him to do anything extra, or special, or untoward, or bizarre. We were simply asking him to NOT do something. But he was too arrogant and full of himself to accommodate a guest request.  What if someone had a serious allergy and requested he leave that item off the plate--would he prefer to have a customer have an allergic reaction, possibly need a trip to the emergency room to accommodate his culinary genius? Needless to say, I won't be back--carry out or dining in.

I called and informed them and asked for a later reservation time.  They said ok.  I also wanted to take sure they still would have the special tablecloth for the new reservation time.  This is when she tells me that they don't do tablecloths for birthdays, only anniversaries..... Um, ok.  Not sure what difference it makes if on the occasion, if I've decide to celebrate there.  I overlooked it because I already told him where we were going and he was looking forward to it.  Mind you, this is the same person that originally told me they could do the tablecloths.    We arrive and wait a few minutes, then we are seated.  Our waiter arrives and immediately starts blurting out the memorized specials for the evening and does not tell us his name.  I notice that on the seat assignment card it says ""Birthday"" at the top so I know they know.  He picks up the card and glances at it and continues to rattle off the specials.  We order drinks and relax.  We order our food and I say I would like the salmon and could they prepare it medium.  The waiter tells me they don't do that and he's never had someone that didn't like it we'll done.  Um, I won't like it because I'm telling you what I like and I was here last week for a business dinner and the server then didn't say anything about my same request and prepared it.  He comes back saying they can do it.  Ok, no big issue.  We are wrapping up our meal and the server offers us the dessert menu.  No mention of my husbands birthday.  My husband orders a dessert and the waiter brings it out.  Still no candle or Happy Birthday.  At this point I am pissed.  I go to the front ask was there going to be any mention of his birthday and she is surprised nothing had been done.  The waiter comes back and apologies and tells us that they didn't tell him......  Of course they didn't.  You didn't read it on the card when we sat down.   I was so ready to leave and my husband was just ready to go home.  Thanks for making this special evening  a run of the mill experience at a restaurant that does NOT pay attention to detail.  No thanks, Weber Grill.",0.9965,0.799,0.158,0.043,0.46045796308954207

It's just a few blocks off Michigan and right on Ohio Ave. (Right down the block from Eataly, just sayin') It seems like a lot of people really like the dining area being right alongside the cook line. Personally, I don't care for that - not a fan of smelling like a cookout when I leave a place but that's Weber's thing so I can't really complain about it.  My salad was fine but pretty overpriced. I could have gotten the same thing at Panera for much cheaper - and the greens were a little gritty too.

2014-08-28,5.0,"Is it a steakhouse? Is it a BBQ joint?  It's both and neither, but the food is definitely worth it and the service is top-notch.  Their menu can be taken as an upscale steakhouse, but the BBQ offerings are very reasonable and make it attractive to the whole family.  This is reflected in the decor, with rich, dark wood tones and the occasional ranchhouse accented details. We were very lucky to score a table after a friend's recommendation.  We tried Open Table the same day and was only offered a 9pm seating.  We tried calling to try our luck and it paid off with a 6:30 table, Score!  It was a stroke of luck because walk-ins were waiting 45 min to an hour.  Our server, Blake, was every bit the professional and was patient to explain all the specials and highlights of the menu in great detail.  Everytime my soda glass was half full, another full one would mysteriously appear.  We started with the Grilled Oysters Rockefeller on a bed of rock salt, which were OK, but cannot compare to grilled oysters down in New Orleans.  The nightly specials included a 20oz T-Bone which my wife ordered with sautéed mushrooms.  It was a perfect medium rare.  My son ordered the lazy man's BBQ triple mixed plate of sausage, pulled pork & sliced brisket, all smoky in flavor and you can see the smoke ring on the slow cooked brisket.  My double double-cut loin lamb chops were perfectly grilled to medium, just the way I liked it with a bit of charred crust that popped when I stuck my knife in.  If only I could get my hands on one of those giant cast bronze charcoal kettle grills they have lined up against the wall in the kitchen, I would be the Grill King of the neighborhood!  They're like 4ft in diameter and you'll never find one at your local Sears!  Discounted parking is available if you park in the garage directly above the restaurant and they validate your ticket.  We made the mistake of parking at the Grand Plaza building across the street.",0.9958,0.814,0.164,0.023,0.5825743145743146

As you would expect, the menu features an abundance of grilled items, steaks, burgers, BBQ and pulled pork sandwiches.  The place is also huge which really helps when trying to walk into a place downtown at dinnertime without a reservation. Trust me when I tell you - even if you are a tourist - you will want to get a reservation no matter where you go. When you walk in is a nice bar area with high top tables and of course, the main bar, where you can also eat. if you prefer, you can be seated in a boot that overlooks the open kitchen. Yes the food is cooked (at least some of it) on Weber grills. Hilarious! Then in the back is yet another dining room that is away from the kitchen and perhaps a bit less active. We were seated in a booth overlooking the kitchen ad due to its location, the waitstaff was constantly going back and forth so it can be a bit much! Portions are decent. I had a burger which comes with your choice of sides and the wife had the pulled pork served with slaw and also a choice of sides. She had the fries (very good) and I got the slaw which was a bit runny and creamy for my taste but still decent. Pretty basic beer list but an extensive wine list and on Monday's certain bottles are half off. Ironically, the higher end ones are! Pretty cool if you want to go on a Monday.

It was a Friday night and since we were hungry, we went to the first come first serve area at the bar directly to the left of the cooks. At first the smell of charcoal coming from the grill was slightly bothersome, but I grew to enjoy the aroma of the charred meat on the grill.  We started off our meal with the jumbo shrimp cocktail which tasted exactly how I expected shrimp cocktail to taste-pretty tasty. The cocktail sauce was accompanied by horseradish sauce that I believe had wasabi in it. It added a nice kick and cleared the sinuses. My main course was the Wisconsin burger. I loved the charcoal flavor on my burger and the bacon was crispy. The cheddar cheese was sharp and the bun was soft while able to hold the burger together well. Fries were pretty meh.

The following day Mr, O'Sullivin, the manager, reached out to me and apologized for the experience.  He further offered a gift card saying, , "". . .

I did not eat much of these two items and I have a large appetite.  My wife is a vegan but settled on being a vegetarian for the meal as the veggie burger has cream in it. The veggie burger also had beets in it to give it the appearance of a ""real"" burger. A suggestion for weber-a vegan or vegetarian does not want their burger to look like a beef burger.

Since I had no idea Weber would do such a thing, I didn't get the nice table set up, but we got a free dessert. Here's the meat of my review: The food is good, but you can end up paying very different amounts for the same quantities of food. Of course some the variability is due to quality, but not all of it. Ask how big the portions are (for the menu items that don't disclose weight) so you don't end up paying a lot of money for a small amount of meat. The best meat/dollar deal seems to be the pick three bbq meal. Other things: Go here on a weekday to avoid the weekend tourist rush.

2014-04-25,5.0,"Chicago has more than it's fair share of high end steakhouses, most of which are somewhat formal and quite pricey. If you're in the mood for steak (or anything else that can be cooked on a grill) and want something a bit more casual (and cheaper) the Weber Grill is a great choice. We went here on a recent vacation with our kids and my parents and everyone enjoyed the place and the food. I had the prime rib, which turned out to be better than expected, and the other steaks we ordered were all very good as well. Perhaps not up there with the higher end places, but it was definitely very good. The atmosphere here is a bit mixed. There's a row of tables with a view of the kitchen where you can see the gigantic grills they use to cook most of the food. This section is a bit noisier and you can smell the smoke from the kitchen. We had a table in the back, which was a quitter and nicer. Like many places, it can get crowded, so I'm glad we had reservations. Service was great, our waiter was professional and friendly. Overall it's might still be a tad touristy, but not as bad as your might think. If you're wearing a suit and tie and looking to impress clients this probably isn't the right place, but if your in the mood for steak and want to have fun this is a great choice. Five stars might be a bit generous, but I think if you have the right expectations (nicer than Fridays or Outback, less formal and cheaper than Morton's) this place really delivers.",0.9967,0.777,0.223,0.0,0.49665898617511517

The option was there to order pancakes, waffles or french toast...and we did. But they don't have a quick enough turnaround to have these ready and available.

We proceeded to walk to the very back of the very hot restaurant to be seated in a corner at a table that was surrounded by crumbs and trash on the floor.  As we sat there looking at all of the servers standing around (including the manager) waiting for someone to come and ask us what we would like to drink we pondered why there weren't enough servers to handle outside. Bad service is bad enough but when you are watching pods of servers all around you talking, laughing and joking with the MANAGER, it becomes all the more irritating. The restaurant was not clean and the ladies restroom had a leak with water and paper towels all over the floor.  There was actually a roasting pan catching the water.

Service was attentive, but not hovering, our cocktails featured solid pours and the wine selection was simply amazing.  Our second visit Jan'14 was for my birthday, by request - I had an absolutely amazing slice of rare prime rib while the wife enjoyed a gorgeous, perfectly cooked rib eye. The star of both evenings was, amazingly enough, a mammoth side dish of grilled beets with goat cheese and candied pecans - simply one of the best veggie offerings I have ever enjoyed. I do find their ""whipped"" garlic mashed potatoes a bit overworked - they tend to come out gooey, tasting more like a garlicky paste than creamy potatoes.  Our awesome waitress delivered a potpourri of dessert shooters for my birthday, graciously comp'ed by the hostess who also came over to wish me a happy birthday. Add to that an unexpected 10% local's discount, and I can say the food and fare were both stellar.

We went on Valentine's Day, after failing to make a reservation in the city due to changed travel plans. Every restaurant was filled up, but after speaking to the hostesses in Weber Grill, they said that the bar tables were up for grabs (first come, first serve) if you didn't mind sitting in there. It was a bit cramped and busy (Friday night in the city on Valentine's Day, nonetheless, will do that), but me and my boyfriend were able to score a small 2-person table near the bar.  We were greeted promptly by a server who took our drink orders and gave us full menus to look at. She also quickly brought out some of their bread which is DELICIOUS. It's pretzel rolls, and it comes with normal butter and some type of bacon-cheese spread which is incredible. Both me and my boyfriend ordered the same menu items - NY Strip (mine medium rare, his medium) with the normal side of garlic mashed potatoes and a Caesar salad.  Our salads came out first and were a REALLY large portion for only $4. The dressing was really creamy and it had a nice kick to it. There was a nice amount of dressing on the salad, but it wasn't swimming in it, which was definitely nice. Shortly after this, our entrees came out. Like I said, I ordered mine medium rare, and it was cooked very well. There were a few pieces of the steak that were more medium (towards the edges of the steak), but that's to be expected when cooking on charcoal with fire. It didn't make the steak lose it's flavor or tenderness, however. It was quite delicious.  My favorite part (and my boyfriends!) was the garlic mashed potatoes, however. Both steaks came with a generous portion of them and they had a great flavor. They were incredibly creamy and had such a deep garlic flavor, which we love. If we weren't so full, we would have ordered more. The only mishap with our dinner was when we ordered drinks. I ordered an Angry Orchard cider since they had it on tap. When we received our drinks, I had something that was NOT my cider. I asked her what it was and she said she made a mistake, that it was a sangria made with Angry Orchard. I tried it and loved it (it had a nice kick to it and was made with fresh apples!), so I decided to keep it. It wasn't a big deal to me at all. When we received our check, she had taken off the mistake and didn't charge me for it.

2013-12-27,4.0,"I had been to the Weber Grill previously in Indianapolis a few years ago. At that time we were really impressed and enjoyed our meal. On this occasion we felt a little more underwhelmed. This experience would probably rate as three and a half stars, but I will round up because of the nice kids meals. My husband originally wanted to go to Pizzaria Uno just around the corner from here, but the line was very long and it was cold and late for our two young kids to eat. I begged him to come back to the Weber Grill and he obliged. Thankfully they were able to squeeze us in without a reservation on a Sunday evening with just a short wait.  They seated us at a round table with very little room on each side of the table. My mother kept getting banged into by waiters and patrons passing and the diner behind me shoved their chair up against mine and kept it there for the entire meal, so we were practially back-to-back. I could not scoot foward any further because I was right up against the table.  Service was decent and they took our orders pretty quickly once we were seated. My husband got the BBQ platter, which we had had last time and he really enjoyed it. My mother and I both got the single porkchop with garlic mashed potatoes rather than the sweet potatos and the spinach. I felt my porkchop was decent, but maybe a little bit overcooked, so it was dry. I could not really discern the garlic in the potatoes and the spinach was fine, if nothing impressive. I thought this dish was overpriced for what you get.  However, the kids meals were very impressive and worth much more than you typically get. They came out on a divided tray plate with the main dish, tater tots, fruit salad, broccoli, milk and a cookie! It was more food than my kids could finish because they are only four and two, but for older kids this would fill them up and make them happy. For a small upcharge you could even make the cookie into a sundae. Our table also split the Triple Chocolate Bundt Cake for dessert. It was good, but the scoop of ice cream was way too small for the amount of cake. I think each of us got maybe a spoonful of ice cream, but at least five or six bites of cake. The best part of the dessert was the hot fudge which came out in a little pitcher to pour over the cake. I sat and ate that all on it's own. Yum!  This was probably our most expensive dining experience in Chicago, but it didn't really live up to my memories of the one in Indianapolis, which seemed more modern and spacious. Food can be hit or miss, I would stick to entrees that are grilled on the actual grills and don't rely on the sides too much.",0.9907,0.891,0.091,0.017,0.5319999999999999

Host took us to a table tucked far away in the back portion of the restaurant, but I quickly asked for a booth next to the street side and close to the actual grill (it was cold in the restaurant) and he quickly led us there. Our server, Hector was awesome. He brought out fresh rolls with butter right away and gave me the low down on all of the fish options. I was craving fish and realize that yes, this is Weber grill, but I make fish on my Weber grill all the time and I love it!  So I opted for the cedar plank salmon. I found it to be over salted, along with the green beans (which were only luke warm upon arrival). I also had a side Caesar salad and was not impressed by the dressing (bland) but overall the salad was presented nicely and was very fresh.  My daughter ordered from the kids menu. She was ""starving"" so I was pleased to see that the grilled cheese sandwich would come with tater tots, veggies and fresh fruit. Only, what they don't tell you is it's only 1/2 of a grilled cheese sandwich. Shouldn't this be on the menu? I asked our server, Hector, and he did say they would make another 1/2 sandwich.

In which case, you'll get a dollop of mashed potatoes and not one, not two, not even three but FOUR slices of dry meat loaf. If, for some reason, this does not deter you I will leave you with this last piece of advice. If you order the meatloaf, do not try to be ""healthy"" and order the broccoli.

2013-09-14,5.0,"The Weber Grill restaurant is known for their char-grilled masterpieces and their burgers are no exception. Having visited on multiple occasions I'll average my experiences for the purposes of review.  The Weber Grill has a few burgers to choose from ranging from the Classic to the Wisconsin (my personal favorite). All feature a pretzel bun, premium toppings, and a juicy char-grilled patty. All the burgers I've had have perfect buns, great beef patties, and fantastic toppings. The Wisconsin is their standout in my opinion adopting a Wisconsin Cheese Spread and bacon to create a rich combination cheese, bacon, and char flavor, that melts together to complement the pretzel bun perfectly.

For entrees we chose prime rib and kabobs with ""Spanish"" rice. Like another Yelp-er pointed out, they can't cook anything to your specifications. My prime rib came out rare and bloody when I asked for medium. Weber technology should have prevented that, given the price they should be able to cook it! The ethnic rice might as well have come out of a Zitarain box cooked by ""special kids"" with a penchant for adding ketchup to everything. The server was kind of enough to ask if I wanted to send it back, but I just didn't trust them to do not spit in it. So, we had our salted, almost jerked meal and smiled until we got the check.

2013-05-18,2.0,"""At least I'm full"". That is my wife's comment after I took her to Weber Grill for her birthday dinner. I have been to Weber Grill a few times and always felt they were slightly better than mediocre which leads to the question ""why did you take your wife there for her birthday and the answer is I am a terrible husband. Now back to the review. The dinner started with the spinach and artichoke dip for appetizer. This concoction was impossible to eat. Its their version of spinach and artichoke dip cooked on a grill. Use ur imagination of how this turned out. I had the bone-in ribeye medium. The cut of steak was fine but the fact that the steak came out charred on the outside but ice cold on the inside was disappointing. Being charged $38 for a steak from a restaurant named Weber Grill generally builds an expectation that it wll be cooked correctly. On a brighter note, the garlic mashed potatos were perfect. My wife had the Tuscan Chicken which was cooked correctly but we didn't like the seasoning which I won't penalize Weber Grill for. We decided to salvage the dinner by ordering the apple pie for dessert. We each took one bite and determined that Weber Grill didn't care anymore because they have become a tourist trap and tourists rarely return for a second showing.I am certain that the apple pie was microwaved. We ate the ice cream and left the pie on the plate. Needless to say, Weber Grill will never see me again.",-0.191,0.866,0.064,0.07,0.5860714285714286

I ordered the Burger and Spinach Dip. So what's wrong with this picture: The Spinach Dip was better than the burger. How could that be ? They have big charcoal grills in the Kitchen. How could you not cook a good burger on charcoal (Bobby Flay said to take Charcoal over Gas). The Spinach Dip was made as if it were a French Onion soup. It appears they heated the bowl in the oven and it was a perfect blend of Spinach and cheese. Instead of chips, it comes with a warm pita bread.

Now to the food: Apps: Wood fired crab cake - tasty.  Would definitely recommend it.  Its one large crabcake so we shared among three ppl.  Its not a lump crab cake but still the wood flavor comes through. Buffalo shrimp - very tasty.  you get abou 5 shrimp which was great for us.  Wood fired vegetable pizza. The grilled crust is good.  The veggies on top were asparagus, artichoke hears, mushroms, tomatos, and goat cheese.  It was good but if you want to get the pizza maybe try other flavors b.c the crust is good for sure. Half slab ribs- this was enough for three people for sure.  They are tender and tasty.  The bbq sauce tasted like masterpiece from a bottle but still I was pleased with the taste for sure.  I'm not a rib connoissieur, but I liked it! Warm chocolate bundt cake with vanilla ice cream was delicious.  We shared it among three people and we could not finish it.  It comes with hot fudge that you can drizzle on top and that really makes it wonderful.   By the end we were stuffed.  Good place, excellent service.  Would try it again :)",0.9977,0.677,0.299,0.024,0.633456486042693

We were here for a team lunch so we needed food that was acceptable to eat amongst your co-workers, served fast.  I nearly ordered the Kalbi salad but freaked out when the waiter told me it was real spicy.  I'm sure it wasn't Korean spicy but I immediately assumed so which was my bad - I bet it was American level spicy.  Because of my freak out, I ordered a special roast beef sandwich with au jus and parmesan fries.  I've been trying to swear off fries but there they were, all skinny cut with a light sprinkling of parmesan and...I think it was parsley?  I couldn't resist.  The sandwich was also great and very filling.  Not so heavy that I would have to sneak away at work and nap.  More like, satisfying and I probably don't need a snack at 3:30 PM.

When you first walk in, you can see the open kitchen where they are grilling your food with charcoal. Complimentary rolls come out with two different types of butter. One is a light, whipped butter, the other is a cheese butter. Super good, and unlimited if you are willing to ask ;). I tried the BBQ Combo Platter, which comes with two sides for $17.50 - SEE PHOTO (this thing is a lot of food!) The pulled pork is super tender and does not come out drenched in BBQ sauce. Instead, the sauce comes on the side so you are able to control how much you want. It is served on a bun like an open-faced sandwich. The beef brisket comes with a little bit of sauce on top and is also super tender. The garlic mashed potatoes are what you would imagine, while the mac n cheese is light and is not served in cheddar cheese but a white cheese. Not bad for sides. My friend had a medium 7oz filet with mashed potatoes and although liked it, stated it was a bit dry. He's had burgers here before and thinks they are awesome. Burgers will run you about $10-12 here, so not a bad deal for lunch. I did eye that Weber Grill has a Black Bean veggie burger for vegetarians or those wanting to try something new. Overall, I'm giving Weber Grill a 4-star rating. I really enjoyed lunch here, but it isn't quite 5-star quality or value.

It's a nice atmosphere and a nice restaurant, but the food is just OK. We ordered a flatbread, which had home-made sausage, red peppers, and sliced salami on it with cheese. It was good but nothing I would order again, I wish there would have been a sauce or something on it to bring it all together. My boyfriend got the Bistro Steak (7 oz. Grilled NY Striploin with Parmesan Herb Fries), which was nothing special, especially since it was $20. A thin, pounded out piece of steak, with FRIES. Not even a baked potato, but super thin fries that were cold in a matter of 2 minutes and extremely over-seasoned with parmesan, oil, and garlic to the point that they were soggy. Would have been more satisfied for a $16-18 price range for this steak. Anyways, we do not plan on coming back.  The ONLY reason I gave them 2 stars rather than 1 is because of the pretzel bites. Everyone on these reviews mentioned the pretzel bites and I was extremely sad when I could not find them on the appetizer portion of the menu or anywhere on the menu. Then our waiter came with a bread basket (10 minutes later) and we saw that THESE were the pretzel bites everyone was talking about! Yum they are so good, soft, and served with a butter and cheese spread. Amazing. Who knew that the complimentary bread basket would be the best part of the entire dinner. Service was extremely slow. After we were seated we did not get acknowledged for about 10 minutes. Then a waiter comes up and says ""have you been seen yet?"" and we said no so he finally told us about the restaurant and the specials. He left so we would have time to look over the menu, but it took him a very long time to come back, we were clearly sitting around looking over our shoulder to find him. When we got our food we asked for more pretzel bites and never received them until we asked for a second time. After we were finished eating it took about 25 minutes for our waiter to acknowledge that we were done and ask us if we needed a check or wanted dessert. We asked for our check and it took another 10 minutes for him to come back and give it to us. Very, very slow service, and it was a Sunday night so it was not extremely busy.

We made our reservations for 10:30pm through OpenTable and they requested a credit card to secure the reservation due to it being NYE.  I'm OK with that, restaurants need to protect themselves on days when they have a high anticipation of selling out. So as our night progresses we realize we'll be a few minutes late (10) for our reservation.  I call them up and the waitress politely tells me that it's no problem but the kitchen is closing at 10:45pm...on NYE.  That's right, we needed to a CC to secure a reservation at a restaurant on NYE where the kitchen was closing well before midnight.  Seriously?  That was my first omen. So we make it there with time to spare (kitchen didn't close until after 11 after-all), order the food, as mentioned mine was OK, the wife's was good. and expected...I don't know maybe a champagne toast or something festive to happen as we start to approach midnight, instead the crew is cleaning up the restaurant clearly pissed that we all are still here.

Last memorable dessert experience being the profiteroles in Paris last summer...give me a moment to reminisce. We walked in to The Weber Grill after passing it up so many times thinking it was a barbecue store selling grills, not a restaurant! I loved the idea of everything on the menu being grilled over an open flame, what's not to like about that? I ordered the beef and lamb burger, medium rare with a side of coleslaw. My burger arrived cooked to perfection and the coleslaw was delicious. I am subtracting a star for the burnt bacon. While I love my bacon crisp there is a point where it becomes brittle and tasteless. Bacon is tricky so I can appreciate the fact that on a grill one would have to keep an eagle eye on the bacon. The dessert, this is the sole reason for my review. If you want to taste a little piece of paradise, mosey over to The Weber Grill and order the apple pie  dessert with a scoop of chocolate ice cream. The texture and taste of the crust is more like a cookie, so crispy and delectable that you will devour every last buttery bite. The grilled apples are caramelized to bring out their glorious flavor.

Both of us ordered the combo plate with the chicken and the meatloaf. I wasn't impressed with the chicken but the meatloaf was sooooo good. My sides were ok; I got the sweet potatoes and the mac and cheese. The potatoes would have been better without the pool of butter sitting on top and the mac and cheese was a little dry and not really very cheesy.

We had the starter sampler as an appetizer, which had kebab skewers, grilled shrimp, baby back ribs, and chicken tenders.  All were pretty good, the ribs were almost fall off the bone tender, but a little too much sauce for my tastes. I had the 18 oz NY Strip for dinner, which was absolutely perfect. Our server was attentive and I would definitely go back the next time I am in Chicago.  Definitely make reservations, as this place is always jam packed.",0.974,0.806,0.194,0.0,0.46538461538461545
2012-09-13,5.0,"I think barbecue was God's gift to mankind to make up for giving us head colds or mean bosses, and few places do it as well as Weber's. Many so-called ""barbecue"" restaurants cook prepare their food as any restaurant would, dump some sticky red sauce they call barbecue sauce on it, and say that it is barbecue. The somewhat better ones at least flame grill their meats and may even use a barbecue rub before smothering the efforts in the sticky red sauce, But only a few and only the best actually flame broil or use actual charcoals to prepare their meats using a light rub or no seasoning at all. These TRUE barbecue restaurants put the sticky red sauce in a side dish instead of using it to cover up the meat and provide it just in case the customer lacks the discernment to know good barbecue when he is getting it. I stayed at the hotel adjacent to Weber's and had the breakfast buffet here every day for a week. It was always delicious, offered many, many items and included thing you could order from the kitchen like omelets, waffles or french toast. Both the waffles and the french toast were delicious! But, while the breakfast was outstanding, the dinners are even better. I had a combination plate with a barbecued quarter chicken and a beef brisket accompanied by two side dishes of my choice, and everything was great. My side dishes of corn bread and baked beans were also prepared just as they should have been in a true barbecue restaurant.I also had, on a different night, the chocolate pecan pie which was likewise delicious. I thought the portions were large and very reasonably priced, too. Our server, Tori, recommended a wine selection that was really wonderful, too, In fact, my wife and I rarely drink an entire bottle at dinner, but we did down the one Tori raved about, a 2009 Zinfandel produced by Edmeades, a California winery (naturally). So, I recommend the deserts, the dinners, the wines and the breakfasts. What more could you want?",0.9825,0.866,0.12,0.014,0.5259200083542188

The other two people in my party opted for the:  French Onion KettleBurger:  De Mill Swiss Cheese, Grill Smoked Onions, Red Wine Demi Sauce, Onion Curls.  Instead of the red wine demi sauce, they chose the chipotle mayo instead.  It was a hit!  The few bites I had certainly didn't disappoint.  If only I was quick enough to try the french fries that accomanied their meal.  Alas, I was too late and they were all gone! The food here is fairly priced, the portions are what you'd only find in America, and the service fantastic (not once did we have to ask for refills, orders were taken and brought out in a timely manner, and our server Jackie was very attentive throughout the meal).  It's the kind of place you go for a meal that will stick to your ribs but won't leave your wallet in shock!",0.9752,0.808,0.14,0.052,0.5756216931216931

(For those of you not familiar with Chicago, it's sort of restaurant row.) This location looks almost identical to the Schaumburg one.  I guess they've come up with a cookie cutter approach to creating restaurants.  But, it works.  As the name implies, most of the food is cooked on very large Weber Grills.  These are all set up and visible in an open air kitchen that it kind of fascinating to watch.  Chefs don spatulas at large round Weber Kettle grills, so it's sort of like watching a cookout. I've had a variety of the meals on the menu, so chose something I had not gotten before.  I chose the Full Slab of Ribs.  This comes with two sides - I chose a baked potato and grilled asparagus.   The ribs were excellent, the were slow cooked and fell apart as I touched them with my knife and fork.  Their sauce is tangy, not too sweet and not too spicy.  The baked potato was fine.  (How can you screw up a baked potato?)  Finally, the asparagus was grilled to perfection. Having been to two of their locations now, I would suggest that the Weber Grill is very consistent - the locations look the same, the menus are the same, and the food tastes equally good.   I'm a fan and will be back.",0.9526,0.899,0.086,0.015,0.5056689342403627

2012-08-13,4.0,"Last week when my family and I visited Chicago, Weber Grill was the first restaurant that we dined in. It is my favorite Chicago restaurant that I dined in. Weber Grill could be my favorite bbq restaurant ever.    When we stepped inside Weber Grill, it was crowded. I could see why. It did not take long to be seated. On account of the fact that Weber Grill has block long frontage along State Street from Ohio Street to Grand Avenue; there are plenty of tables.   Weber Grill was a fitting restaurant for starting off the vacation on a relaxing note. The dining area we ate in was classy to the point of not being stuffy. The noise level and lighting was just right.    The food was far above just right. First off, they served us hot dinner rolls before the meal. They did not hold back on second servings of hot dinner rolls. Anyway, I came here for quality bbq food. Immediately, I had my mind set on the Choose Two Slow-Smoked BBQ combo ($17) with two side dishes.* The two choices include: Smoked BBQ Quarter Chicken, Black Angus Meatloaf, House Smoked Sausage, Beef Brisket, Webers BBQ Ribs, and Pulled Pork. The two sides include: Cornbread, Coleslaw, Bourbon Baked Beans, Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes, Fire Roasted Corn on the Cob, and French Fries, and Whipped Sweet Potatoes. In my 40 years on the planet, I never tasted better meatloaf. The brisket was also delicious. Even the coleslaw was first-rate. The fact that Weber Grill did not overdue it with bbq sauce, showed me that they cook quality food.   I am glad that Weber Grill was my first Chicago dining experience of the vacation. It left me with a favorable first impression of Chicago dining. *I believe for $6 more, you could order three items.",0.9686,0.882,0.094,0.024,0.5201587301587302

The steak was so-so, not bad just nothing to get excited about.  I was disappointed because I expected more.  The chipotle mayo dipping sauce was really good though!  Our entrees were just as disappointing.  Nothing was bad, I just assumed that because this place specializes in GRILLING that it would be grilled to perfection by the experts.  I think I grill better than they do! My husband had a burger, and I had surf and turf.  The steak was tough, and lacking in flavor.  I couldn't help but think it was one of those fake steaks they've been talking about in he news lately where they take a lesser grade of meat and cut it up to resemble a better cut.   Another disappointing thing was he atmosphere and service.  We were walked through the front part of the restaurant where there were big comfortable booths, a bar and what seemed to be a great atmosphere - and sat in a back room where people were packed into tiny tables and herded in and out.  We certainly felt like we needed to eat and go so the next people could be seated. Our waitress was OK, but she didn't check on us until we were half way hrough our meal.  Then brought the check before we were done.  With strangers sitting so close we didn't feel like staying anyway.   I'm glad  we went but won't go back.  It had so much potential - but ultimately was just a big let-down.  In hind sight I wish we would have gone to Ruth's Chris around he corner.",0.9811,0.817,0.125,0.058,0.5238095238095238

Either way it was a very nice gesture of them to refund 75% of the cost of my original meal, especially considering that we enjoyed about 33% of it (my steak).  There is something to be said for any company that listens and responds to its customers... it's easy to be ""great"" when everything goes well, but how you handle the bad days are what separates the men from the boys in business.  Nice job, Weber Grill!",0.9551,0.81,0.149,0.041,0.732142857142857

I am pleased to report that the food beat my expectations.  The rolls, I think, are pretzel rolls. They came with regular butter and a cheese type butter. It was unique but I mixed the regular with the special and it went together nicely. The waitress was attentive but not overbearing.  I ordered the prime rib medium rare. It was a little more tough that I prefer and the horseradish wasn't as strong as I prefer. The flavor was amazing and the prime rib was juicy. The mashed potatoes were not as good as southern potatoes. They were good but needed more butter to make them fluffier.  The wine list was not extensive but did have some good options. The best choices are not offered by the glass so make sure you can either handle a whole bottle or have a friend to share. I think the atmosphere was nice.

2011-11-22,2.0,"I'm pretty surprised to find out I hadn't reviewed Weber Grill before as I've eaten here dozens of times.  It's always been a safe option to dine here; that is, it's never a place I am highly compelled to eat at, but I also don't really turn my nose up at it either. The food is decent, if average. The service is efficient, if perfunctory. The prices are somewhat high for the quality and portion size, but it's also located smack dab in Tourist Central so that's to be expected. I went for lunch today and ordered something other than a burger (which is my usual go-to) and opted for the grilled steak skewers and a side of onion strings. Two measly, overcooked steak skewers arrived (lukewarm at best) over a pile of onion strings...in addition to the side of onion strings I ordered because I didn't know it already came with them. It would have been really helpful to know that as no living being could have eaten that many onion strings in one sitting. I would have likely ordered a different side or salad so I can't imagine why the server wouldn't have mentioned that to me as I ordered. The side never got eaten; maybe if they weren't abundantly greasy, limp and cold, I could have managed to eat a few more, but as it was the few I did eat now sit like a grease bomb in my tummy. To be fair, there are other options here that are much better. Their salads are hearty and fresh, and their beer can chicken is delicious (although I've mastered the art of making my own on the grill so I never order it here anymore). And you can never go wrong with a burger - they're always cooked perfectly and have the lovely char from the grill on them. I made the mistake of ordering dessert here once and won't do that again. I recall it was some kind of grilled pound cake with berries, but the pound cake tasted like grilled meat. Go figure - they cook it on the same grill as everything else. If you do go to Weber Grill, I advise you to stick with the burgers and don't be too adventurous with the rest of the menu.

The service was excellent even though the bar was packed and the beer can chicken was outstanding. It had a ton of flavor and was very moist. So I think I'm big Weber Grill fan.

It was a hot day but having the room a little cooler would have been a nice relief.  We had a party of eleven this evening so they do handle groups well but the server seemed to disappear from time to time.  This is good if you are in for a night of it to share conversation but if you have after dinner plans this place will not be favorable.    The place is better than your average chain restaurant.,0.9667,0.732,0.196,0.072,0.5578124999999999

I feel like the food is 3.75 stars, but the service soeed is 2. So, 3 is the perfect rating here. Maybe 3.25, since I value the food more than the service at a food eating establishment, but nothing higher. First, it was a Wednesday night. The place was busy, but not packed. We were seated immediately. The server came over quickly, he was extremely friendly and explained the menu, the specials, etc. Unfortunately, after that, he was few and far between visits. I don't blame the guy - he was working his butt off from what I could tell. I blame the restaurant - they needed another server in his section.  I had a martini with well vodka (Smirnoff) and it was surprisingly delicious considering how little I like Smirnoff. It was mixed quite well.  An appetizer of baby artichokes took forever and a day to come out. They were fairly average. I don't see the purpose of baby artichokes...I would have preferred the big boys. And because it took so long to come out, we didn't get a chance to finish it before dinner came. So for dinner, I had a BBQ combo with meatloaf and ribs, and sides of cornbread and slaw. I have had the meatloaf before in Lombard and it lived up to its delicious standards. The ribs were quite good as well. Cornbread was delicious as always, but the slaw was a bit runny for my standards. M'lady had a burger and it was OK. Nothing to write home about.

We'd marched around indecisively for a few or twenty-five minutes in a strange city where we'd relied mostly on the opinions of strangers to give us some indication of what to try and what to avoid. Since the future wife's arm was looking tasty, and since we were walking by Weber and since I'd like to not get divorced before I actually get married, we went in. Right away, I was saluted and my hand was shaken. The manager on duty saw my Cleveland Browns hat and waved me over. He was from Avon Lake and his operations manager was also from Cleveland. It felt good to have another Clevelander around, and we were seated quickly. Though, that was more that there was ample seating than it was a Browns fan looking out for another Browns fan. (Hey, come on. We've got to take what we can get. Next time someone cuts in line, they're probably a Browns fan. Just let it go.) Since we weren't all that hungry, we ordered a pizza (BBQ Chicken) and a caesar salad. My new friend the manager bought me my first beer, a fact that I'm ever grateful for.

I make a great grilled pizza and this one beat mine to death with simplicity. Gouda, really well seasoned and flavored chicken, a great BBQ sauce, and thinly sliced scallions. I savored each bite because it really was good. The Caesar Salad? Amazing. I am not a fish person at all. I'm kind of scared of anchovies, and no matter how much people told me that they're just fresh and salty, I always think of nasty pizza with greasy, oily fish. I'm glad I was proven wrong. I could taste their presence, but, it tasted absolutely nothing of fish, and just of salt and freshness. They added a wonderful saltiness without being salty. I hope you understand what I mean here.

I like how it was like home cooking but at the same time there was nothing special about the food to me.

It is amazing that you can get quality bbq food on the Mag Mile.

On our last visit, the burger was a bit under cooked, but the meat was grade A with good flavoring. The other amazing thing is watching them cook your meal on the larger than life grills!  If you are craving bacon, make sure you check out the breakfast buffet. A full spread from pastries to omelettes. I have not tried this, but it is next on my list.

2010-11-16,4.0,"And for my 150th review (I'm not a stats whore, I just happened to see the little counter after my name when I logged in), it's Weber Grill Restaurant.  A place that fades from memory from time to time because you can get a better (insert food here) at (insert restaurant here).  But I guess when you take a comprehensive approach at reviewing a place like this, in the end you're bound to come more satisfied than you're not. Location: 5 out of 5 Easily accessible by train or bus.  Though take that with a few grains of salt because ever since the red line has been under renovation there at Grand, you have to go through one of the side entrances.  It's not a huge burden, but just something to be aware of. Quality of Service: 4 out of 5 Can't complain, but this is something that I did notice: people who work in this part of town (touristy) have to have a certain level of, je ne sais quoi.  Wait, I do know what.  They have to have a certain level of schmooziness.  I'll be candid - they have to possess an ability to feed you BS and still maintain a straight face.  Case in point: my waitress who will remain nameless was polite and professional with me because I told her my situation: it was my off day from work, I was hanging out, and I hadn't been to Weber Grill in awhile.  She didn't try to upsell me on anything, or say that anything was ""to die for"" or that ""I definitely needed to try this.""  Nope, she left me alone for the most part, and quickly and quietly refilled my drink when it was getting low.  I appreciate dining in that type of anonymity.  However, upon realizing that the patrons behind me were from out of town, she turned on the BS factor.  And she said some pretty funny stuff, like how ""Timothy O'Toole's is the best sports bar around here.""  Oh god, really?  I mean, REALLY?  I'll just leave it at that since I've been known to dine there before, and on more than one occasion have seen people act in a way that would make his or her mother shudder.  But this isn't taking away from how I was treated.  Like I said, I was treated well, and service was attentive and quick. Quality of Food: 4.25 out of 5 This is for one food only: I was curious as to what the ""burger of the day"" was.  I was informed that it was something called the ""Ranchero Burger.""  Replete, of course, with jalapenos, two types of salsa, refried beans, fried egg, guac, and cheese.  Of course I had to have this, and had the house kettle fries as the side dish.  Served a nice medium rare, it was one of the better burgers I've had.  The kettle chips really rounded out the experience.  And by rounded - I mean...spiced and salted, almost to an excess.  (I do have to be mindful of my blood pressure once in awhile).   Decor: 3 out of 5 Eh, take it or leave it.  It's almost faux steak house, and the layout of the restaurant is long and narrow.  Of course they're able to circulate the smells of the cooking food to tempt you, but rightfully so. Cleanliness: 4 out of 5 Didn't notice anything errant while I was there.  Everything seemed to be well run, including the cleaning schedule. Price: 3 out of 5 Eh, I wasn't terribly disappointed with what I paid.  At restaurants like these, it's expected that one would pay 11 - 12 bucks for a burger, and even though it was at lunch, I knew that going in and I wasn't about to quibble.  Beers were a little pricey, and although I didn't try the house wheat beer (back yard something or other, as they call it), I doubt it would have been worth 6 bucks a point.  I mean, go in knowing that it's not the cheapest meal, but that it won't be the most expensive, either - and you'll be fine.   Overall: 4 out of 5 A pleasing experience, especially to my taste buds.  See my pic of the Ranchero Burger.",0.9965,0.837,0.129,0.034,0.5541887125220457

But this is where my positive review ends.  I ordered a fillet cooked rare to medium rare. My boyfriend ordered a NY strip. Both are excellent pieces of meat, both fairly easy to cook. The fillet came to the table and was well done. The NY strip had sinew running throughout. A steak place should pride itself on cooking meat to the perfect temperature and the meat quality has to be something to envy. Neither expectation were met. I admit that it's our fault for not complaining to the manager, but we were so underwhelmed, disappointed actually, that we just wanted to leave.

2010-06-13,2.0,"Oh where to start with the mishaps that was my recent dinner at Weber Grill?  A friend chose Weber Grill because they assured her they could accommodate a large party on a Saturday night. Perhaps the person who assured her should have checked with her staff to make sure everyone was on board because they could not, in fact, adequately accommodate our group.  The first major problem we had was that our reservation was pointless. We were given a 6:30 reservation but were seated closer to 7:30. We were given free appetizers to make up for this. Our party of 14 was broken into two tables separated from each other. That was a bummer because it felt like a bad Thanksgiving dinner with the kids, in this situation the graduates and friends sitting at one table and the adults/parents sitting at another. Once we were inside we placed drink orders.  Two beers, two cocktails and a glass of sangria arrived 15 minutes later. We then immediately placed our food orders when our drinks arrived since we were not sure when we'd see our waiter again. Our food arrived around 8:30 just shy of 45 minutes after we placed the order. My meal, the barbecue chicken platter, was so overcooked I still cant believe they served it. All the sauce in the world couldn't cover up the burned dried out poultry on my plate! I was so annoyed that after all this time my food was inedible. The manager asked later how everything was and got several looks of ""meh"" but no one said anything. No one but me that is, since I had a plate full of burned chicken. I think (though Im not positive, that they comped my meal) so that is why I didn't give Weber Grill one star. I understand that we were a large group on a busy Saturday night but this was just a mess all around.If your restuarant cant serve a group that size and do it well don't say you can Weber Grill.

Despite the warnings.....I've been there twice.  The first time my girl friend and I both got steak and treated the place like it was advertised: a steakhouse. This backfired. She had the filet and I porterhouse. Each pretty much sucked and tasted like low end beef smothered in pepper and over cooked. Given the steakhouse prices I was pissed. They give you a choice of garnish for the meat of which we both tried a separate flavor. It was another warning: the food can't stand alone so we're smothering it in something. Even the pretzel bread (which I love usually) was stale.  Obviously now you're wondering, why 3 stars? So several months later my roommate brought me home leftovers from webber in the form of a burger. And I was starving (actually it was just late at night) so I dove in. I was pleasantly surprised with the juicy and moist burger complete with pretzel bun (this time the pretzel bread was damn good).  Keeping this in mind, I happened to be meeting friends in streeterville about 2 weeks later looking to do lunch. One of my friends was roped in by the Webber facade. The huge grill sung to him like sirens alluring Odysseus. I begrudgingly went along with it considering the burger I had recently had. The lunch was pretty good actually: I think the bottom line is that we ordered the correct items (not steaks). For example the BBQ burger was great, the steak salad was a hit and the pulled pork was viewed as solid.

The reason this review gets 4 stars is the amazing special sangria they had yesterday--blood orange and cherry with sparkling white wine. Wow, it was just so good and came with lots of chunks of orange and cherry. YUM. For appetizer, I had the beef quesadillas which were nice and tasty, with just the right amount of spice. I had the pick 2 bbq combo, pulled pork and beef brisket complete with cole slaw, baked beans and cornbread. What I liked best about the baked beans were the bits of meat in the beans, giving it extra flavor. The brisket was tender and the pulled pork had great spice with the Carolina sauce.

2010-02-17,3.0,"Need to start by stating, I've eaten most things on the menu due to my job and take out being a norm.  However, I have never actually eaten here, so my review is based only on the food. It's tasty BBQ, but stay far away if you are looking for anything low fat. That is, here's a place filled with juicy big burgers, meat grilled ever which way on GIANT weber grills (charchol you CAN taste!) and boy do they love their cheese.   Today I had the Chicken BBQ Sandwhich, which in the menu is stated simply as that.  When it arrived, this thing was covered with chedder, cole slaw and smoked Bacon.  Tasty, and ate it all almost, but not at all the ""healthy"" alturnative.  They once had a Shrimp Po'boy that was awesome, but is gone. Their burgers are really good, with a special every day.  They do a good job with most of them.  Same with the pulled-pork sandwiches.  All is good, but nothing really ever stands out.  You want grilled meat, you got it, just dont expect too much more.  The prices are a little high and take out can be a mess.  It's true, the staff is really friendly, but the waits can range into annoyance. I like Weber, I do, but it's just there doing what it does.  Tourists will love it because it's a treat, but repeat viewings get dull.  At the office, we kinda always smile and sigh when we order from there.  I feel bad for the veggitarians, there's really little to order besides sides.  As I said, you want meat?  Hit up Weber, but there's a lot of places that will hit you with a little more surprise for the same price.",0.9936,0.759,0.189,0.051,0.5210068027210883

2010-01-29,5.0,"Went here on a Friday night with reservations at 7:45 (made, online, through  opentable.com ). The place was crazy packed with everything from tables of tourists with kids, office party types, and then people like us, couples who just enjoy a good slab of meat. The bar area was very crowded, but we were able to find a couple of seats and get a drink from the very attentive bar crew while we waited for our table. Once our pager went off, we were led to our table in the back of the restaurant, away from the madness of the reception/bar area. The place is a tad on the pricey side, but no more than you would pay at Sullivan's, which in my opinion, is not nearly as good, and vastly snootier. I'm a big fan of appetizers, and the sampler here is to die for. My wife and I gobbled up everything on there, with our favorite items being the grilled shrimp and the grilled teriyaki steak skewers. Oh, and did I mention the onion strings? Amazing. The only bad thing about the appetizers was that I filled up so much on them, that I hardly had room for the monster ribeye that came out afterward. The steak was perfectly done, medium rare. They don't seem to get ""medium rare"" at Sullivan's, which they interpret to mean anything this side of well done, and which normally results in blood flowing all over the plate. This was perfectly done, and perfectly seasoned, and absolutely huge. I would definitely go back, probably not on a regular occasion, as my ribeye alone was about $36, but I will be back. One added bonus for the evening, the table of middle-aged stripper wannabes at the table adjacent to ours. I have never seen so much sequence on so little material before in my life. When the all got up to go to the ladies room together, everybody in the restaurant paused to watch the parade.

But, if you're reading this for dinner...then please...read on! First off, major bonus for me is they take food allergies very seriously. They have a gluten-free menu and fill out individual, colored food tickets for your order that have to be signed and delivered by a manager. Extra safe. I really enjoyed the Romaine Wedge Salad - simple but delicious. It's fairly large and I split it with my husband. I also had the Baked Onion Soup and it was soo delicious. Few places that take the croutons out of the soup can get the cheese to float and they did! Crispy, gooey delicious. I sampled my husband's flank steak and it was equally delicious. He said the Garlic Mashed Potatoes were awesome! Everyone we ate with also got steaks and various sides - they all enjoyed what they had. The service was great. Very attentive.

Back to the menu, the selection is limited and to be honest nothing really jumped out at me.  I'd expect a larger assortment of BBQ dishes being Weber and all but it feels like they don't want to be strictly BBQ.

I ordered my usual Filet Mignon that I order from any Steak House and also got a Caesar Salad on the sad.  I found it interesting that the steak automatically came with a side of their house mashed potatoes, so I thought bonus for me.  I felt I needed something else, so I opted for a mushroom ""splash"" thinking I'd get some mushrooms here and there. So the food came in a little over an hour (average in-room dining service time is about an hour, so can't complain).  And boy did it look like a lot of food.  My steak was cooked perfectly medium well (I wanted medium) and there was more than a ""side"" of mashed potatoes.  Sad really, cause they weren't that good.  The complimentary bread definitely was....reminded me of a roll of pretzel dough.  Same texture, chewiness, saltiness...all in the shape of a roll.  Yummm. I always wondered if it was possible to mess up a salad...and although my Caesar salad wasn't ""messed up"", I definitely expected more. And that mushroom splash?  Definitely a splash, or something mushroom.  Mushroom oil...mushroom sauce....who knows.  I definitely did not see a physical mushroom, but I will admit, maybe it is I who didn't know the true definition of a ""splash"".  Sigh.  Maybe dining in the actual restaurant would have helped.

Host: I'm sorry but we already closed for brunch. But we will open again in an hour for lunch, you can come back then.  My friend: Oh no, we really wanted to get your brunch. Isn't there any way you could seat us? I think people are still eating there... Host: Sorry but we are closed. My friend: OK... so how long ago should we arrived to catch the brunch? Host: About a minute ago.  My friend: You would have seated us if we got here one minute earlier? Host: Yeah, but we are closed now.  ... Clarification: This is NOT A JOKE. This conversation really took place. You can imagine what my friend thought at this point... She called the manager (Sean) later to tell what happened. The customer service was not any better at that level. Sean did not see anything to apologize for in the host's comment and behavior.

C   Pulled Pork.  Mostly fatty meat.  You'll pick over it. C-   Salads.  On two occasions I was with someone who ordered a salad.  Everything on the plate is covered with a sheen of dressing.  I've never seen lettuce so sad.  The chicken is meager and the same shade and hue as the salad.   C   Meatloaf.  It's a loaf of something that's for sure. Tastes more of fillers than meat and has a really processed texture... you can just imagine hundreds of these slices gliding down a factory conveyor belt.  C   Breakfast Buffet.  Unappetizing layout, items are separated between the bar and open kitchen.  Pancakes (really bland, stay away) and average omelet's are served to you.  The buffet eggs are runny, typical freezer-pack sausage.  Do it as a last resort if you want to fill up on pastry, bread and grab an apple on the way out.    B  Service. Friendly, average. Don't be mistaken by this place; it only looks inviting. It's really a TGIF or Bennigan's in disguise and not even that good.

2009-07-14,4.0,"My party had a reservation for 3 on a busy weekend evening; we had to stand around with a buzzer for 20 minutes before they could seat us. So, first and foremost, be aware that on weekends the restaurant WILL be crowded and that you WILL have to wait. It looks like they do their best to seat people with reservations as quickly as possible; however, given the sheer volume of patrons, sometimes it will not be possible to get a table quickly. I don't know how busy the place gets on weeknights, but I wouldn't be surprised if it were packed from floor to ceiling with bodies. Bottom line: make a reservation at least a day or two ahead of your visit.  Once seated, our server promptly introduced herself and rattled off the night's specials. She was very friendly and attentive, and did a fantastic job. I have zero complaints regarding the waitstaff. I ordered the skirt steak (medium rare), and was pleasantly surprised by the earth-shattering awesomeness of the meat's texture and flavor. It opened my eyes. It made me feel like a tiny speck in a universe of blinding glory. I could hear words in my head:  ""Yea, behold! Thy taste buds are afire with goodness, and I say unto thee, eat of my deliciousness and weep. For your life has changed, your taste buds have awakened, and you will never taste a steak such as this again.""  My entire adult life, I had been eating weak, timid steak that sucked, but Lord Weber has saved me from eternal sucky-steak damnation. Chalk it up to living in an Ohio suburb, I guess. Those poor souls really don't know what they're missing here. Praise be to Lord Weber! Also, the mashed potatoes weren't anything to write home about on their own, but with the juices from the steak? It's like getting to eat two steaks, except one is already chewed. Unfortunately, while I did have a soul-shaking experience involving a (very, very fine) piece of meat, I can only give this restaurant four stars. The problem here is that steak is the only area in which Weber Grill truly shines. The other menu items are good, and you can tell they were made with love -- or at least as much love as any chain restaurant can show a burger, a rack of ribs, a salad, or a piece of chicken -- but that's where the buck stops. And the drinks menu. The pitcher of sangria is a fairly good deal; however, it's loaded with more fruit than alcohol. The beer menu is run-of-the-mill, although it does offer a few microbrew choices. Not bad, but there's so much room for improvement that Weber Grill has a lot of catching up to do if it wants to be competitive with some of the local pubs and restaurants. Overall, if you're visiting Chicago, and want to bring home memories of good food at a relatively unique local chain, this is a good place to go. I took my parents here when they came to visit, and they were absolutely thrilled by the food and the experience. I will continue to take guests there, and I may even take someone there on a date -- although, since the sight of a full-grown male having a religious experience with food is a little off-putting, I'll have to consider this option thoroughly.",0.993,0.78,0.144,0.076,0.551442307692308

How does this translate to the finished product?  Well, if you like grilled food (and I do), then this is a good place for you.  The burgers, brisket and meatloaf are all pretty good.  Other items I have had, namely steaks and the beer can chicken (which I have made at home) were both overcooked.  Cooking over an open flame is not easy, but if you working here, you should know what you're doing.

Went there for lunch the other day and after walking in I was really excited.  It was not packed but there were people eating.   Appetizers were probably the best of the whole meal.  There Buffalo chicken pizza with the blue cheese and hot sauce was awesome. The pretzel bread that they bring out with the cheddar cheese... Amazing. Artichoke dip was alright.   Onion rings , phenomenal.  That ranch sauce or whatever it was was great. Lunch time... Went there with a group so I had a chance to experience just about everything but the steak. Burgers were alright, everything that we had kind of tasted like the charcoal.  Ribs were terrible. As they came out they looked great, but when the put them infront of us... Oh boy.  They came out burnt, hard to peal off the bone and there was a lack of bbq sause on it. Personally vinegar based coslaw is gross! Never seen orange coslaw before...  Baked beans were not bad as well as the cornbread... have defiantly had better. Chicken breast was good, juicy, but still had some of that char taste.   I guess I was expecting more, and I really can not describe the way burning taste.  Maybe we just had an uncleaned grill...  Would I go back there...

2009-03-22,4.0,"I finally had an opportunity to visit Weber Grill and it lived up to every juicy, meaty, rave review my friends gave of this restaurant.  First off, you know a restaurant is good if the place is packed on a weekday despite the economy. I went at 7 pm and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. But it wasn't a problem since my friend and I waited in the adjacent hotel lobby and pored over a menu. Figuring out what to eat was truly a difficult decision.  I settled on the full slab of ribs with a side of Weber Grill's signature whipped sweet potatoes. Mmmm. The meat was so tender and you could tell it was well cooked because the bones were soft too. The full slab was also way more than I could handle so I had a nice half slab left to bring home for leftovers. The whipped sweet potatoes were rich, creamy, and naturally flavorful. I was glad I opted to get this side as a replacement for the sides originally offered with the ribs: a cornbread slice, cole slaw and baked beans. I highly suggest inquiring about side dish substitutions. It was also my friend's birthday and the restaurant gave my friend a choice of his birthday dessert (of course, on the house). My friend opted for a triple chocolate bundt cake with a side of vanilla white chocolate chip ice cream. First off...that slice of cake was HUGE. HUGE!!! My friend and I can eat but man...that slice was too much for us and he took the rest to go. The slice also came with a mini creamer's worth of hot chocolate sauce to drizzle over the slice. Wow. The ice cream also consisted of more white chocolate chips than ice cream, which is a win-win situation in my book. The staff was very nice, the place clean and bustling, and it's quite a sight to see how all of your food is cooked on big ""honkin'"" Weber grills.

All I wanted was a burger, so that's what I ordered.  It was, without a doubt, one of the worst burgers I've ever had.  I liked the fact that it wasn't one of those gargantuan deals that has to be cut in half in order to be able to eat it.  The problem -- and this is a biggie -- is that the meat had not been seasoned at all or seasoned minimally.  It rendered the blandest burger I have ever had.  It was like eating pressed wood.  Not even the bleu cheese topping made it palatable.  I can make (and have made) better at home, and I'm not known for my cooking. Would I go again?  I would give it a second go to be fair, but I would skip lunch and be sure to order something different.  If I want a burger from a chain restaurant, I'll stick with Chili's.",0.8628,0.877,0.088,0.036,0.5364395183360701

It seemed silly to me to go to a restaurant simply to have someone grill for you - especially at these prices. I was actually pleasantly surprised; I did like the meal and the drinks were great. The night we went was packed with people - mostly tourists, I think. The food was pretty good and really filling, but it was pretty spendy. I am sure I'll visit again sometime, but there are lots of other places to eat that aren't as expensive and just as good.",0.9903,0.672,0.307,0.02,0.6778769841269842
2008-11-01,3.0,"This used to be ""my"" place, right around the corner from my apartment in Streeterville, a great place for grabbing a good dinner to-go, while spending my corporate paycheck nightly by being lazy by not cooking. I used to get the Romaine Wedge Salad or the Heirloom Tomato Salad (with Blue Cheese, Kalamata Olives, Onions, and Balsamic Vinaigrette - something I don't think they have anymore, which is a shame because it was absolutely delicious), and the Filet or the NY Strip Steak, medium rare. Sometimes I would spice it up with a Splash of Blue Cheese and Herbs, which although terrible for you, absolutely pure decadence. Although tasty, upon many occasions, my steaks would be prepared incorrectly, which to me, is a bit unforgivable for a grilling type of restaurant, that should have the basics down. I understand that mistakes happen, but it happened on more than one occasion, which left me frustrated and irritated. Upon taking a filet to-go one night, once cut open, it was very fatty, which is not what you expect at 27 bucks a pop. The onion curls are delicious and are pure gluttony, but are so damn good. The atmosphere is tourist ridden and you will have to wait for a table, even on a Tuesday night due to it being linked to a hotel.

My friends shared the same unfortunate fate for our mess of a meal with their food. And when we pointed out the shortcomings of the food to the waiter, his reply was along the lines of ""yeah we've had some problems"" without offering to fix it or discount it or anything.  (Dont think I'm cheap - but thats just basic customer service.)

The menu was a bit more diverse than I was expecting.  I was thinking it would be mostly burgers and steak, and a few chicken dishes, but a lot is offered here.  I was particularly impressed with the special BBQ menu that they provided in honor of ""BBQ Month"", or something to that effect.  It had lots of great sounding dishes, like brisket, ribs, and a trio of turkey, brisket and pork.  Some even included hush puppies, which unfortunately are not available to be gotten as a side. I resisted the lure of the hush puppies and went with a garden salad and their signature beer can chicken.  The salad was delicious, with a light and tangy roasted corn vinaigrette.  The chicken was VERY moist and had good flavor.  Maybe a tad under seasoned, but perfectly cooked.  The accompanying mashed potatoes were amazing.  Great texture with a nice blend of creaminess but still with substance from the potato skin.  Delicious! Some of my complaints were how noisy it was.  It didn't really sound that loud but when I tried to speak it was like nobody could hear me at all and I had to scream.  The service was also lacking.  We had to request pretzel rolls (which were dry and too dense, in my opinion), a friend did not receive the drink she ordered, the waitress took a long time to take food orders, as well as bring the check, and with beers not being cold enough.  Nothing major, but certainly noteworthy.

Good smoke penetration was proof these weren't cooked under a broiler, but the sauce was rather uninspired, tasting like a suburban chain restaurant.

Or maybe it was just that I was really hungry and nothing was getting in my stomach's way...:) Kevin seemed to enjoy his burger as well and I enjoyed tasting his fries- Kevin may be my new favorite person to eat with since he always orders fries (which I love, but can't order them since they aren't on the diet).   Wouldn't rush back when there are so many other options in our fair city, but wouldn't be opposed to going back either...although would like my salad sans string next  time.",0.984,0.79,0.18,0.03,0.4792310606060606

My steak, however, left something to be desired.  I ordered the dry-aged Kansas City cut since I've always preferred dry-aged meat.  I was expecting a tender, flavorful cut of meat, and instead was presented with a hunk of beef full of gristle and with an unappealing flavor of chemically treated charcoal and lighter fluid.  I suppose some people without grills might be craving this flavor, but to me I prefer the cleaner flavors of a steak from Gibson's or even Joe's.  They did cook it bleu, just as I requested, and the captain even checked in to make sure I knew what I was getting-good policy with the number of tourists they see. The three of us split a huge slice of chocolate cake for dessert, and, while it was unimpressive, the size and price made up for the mediocre flavor.   Weber Grill has a surprisingly good wine list and a fair selection of after dinner drinks, though their ports (my personal favorite libation) were lacking. Weber Grill is someplace safe to take your Dad when he visits, or to get a piece of meat after the game.  The food is guaranteed not to offend and not to impress, but to fill an empty stomach to near bursting.",0.9741,0.814,0.14,0.046,0.5951690821256039

Weber Grill must do great Steaks.  Sorry again.  Its a good cut of meat and well-prepared.  But for the price, there's better to be had in a better atmosphere in Chicago. So what does Weber Grill have?  In my opinion, 2 things: location & marketing.  And clearly this is enough for them to be very successful here. If you're thinking about going here, know that you're not getting Chicago's best.  If you're after BBQ, go a bit further and try Hecky's (on Halsted).  If its steak you're after, try a true Chicago steakhouse -- there are about a dozen in this area and each one has a group of yelpers singing its praises.  If you want a safe ""chain"" restaurant with a nicer atmosphere, try Bandera.",0.9851,0.658,0.242,0.1,0.634313725490196

Sangria seems to be one of their specialties, and its delicious however the put so much fruit in the pitcher that you get jipped on the amount of drink. For that reason, I would go for beer on tap (which is best with burgers anyway). The sides are very good, so definitely get an additional veggie if you think you might have the room. The service is usually very attentive, but on my last visit we never received our second round of drinks. Our server did not apologize right away, which was a little shocking.

Of course we walked for blocks and saw many vertical red neon signs on corners but none of them said what I thought I had seen...""I think it's over there"" became my new tagline. Anyway, we had passed by Weber Grill like twice in our pursuit of the Italian haven and we should have just followed our initial instincts and walked in as soon as we saw it. We kept saying ""that place looks good"" everytime we wandered by....in search of the italian place getting more and more weak from airport hangover. When we finally lost it and were able to make the decision to trek back to Weber Grill, the hostess explained with a darling smile that it would be at least an hour and a half before we could be seated. I had suspected SOME type of wait, since it WAS NYE! We said 'fine' and made our way to the bar, I sucked down a 'Sangria of the Day'. OMG. I sucked it down so fast. I had fresh mangos and lime chopped up in it. yummy! We ordered a heaping appetizer and in the middle of it, we were sat. I hate when hostesses overcompensate the wait...been there and know NOT to do it. The food was so fantastic here. We declined dessert AGAIN in Chicago. No room!!!!
