My kids typically love going there, but the truth is on our most recent visit nothing excited any of us. It was still the best option for dinner, since we're all really picky, but our food was just A-OK. I ended up getting a chicken breast with mac 'n cheese and baked beans. It was pricey for a small piece of chicken, and the beans weren't very good...I would have preferred them out of a can. They were tough and chewy. The mac 'n cheese was just good but nothing memorable. The truth with FoodLife is nothing is memorable, except for maybe the pizza. This time around the kids and hubby ordered from MBurger, but that's still a fast food dinner burger option IMO. I still love the concept of FoodLife, and the staff working there is typically really nice. However, I find the food to be a bit overpriced for what you get (though the pizza is worth it).  The best part about FoodLife is you always know what you're going to get, but I think I'm ready to try Foodease across the way now.

Second, it's extremely corporate.  That is also true, and part and parcel of that is the fact that its concept is no longer as unique as it once was.  So I really can't say it's a transcendent eating experience.  All that aside, it is a pretty inventive concept, and one that is, for the most part, well-executed.  I've never gotten bad service at the various kiosks, and the food is of surprisingly high quality for what is basically a high-toned buffet.  It can get a little spendy, but that's less because of the reasonable price of the food than it is the temptation to overdo it.  The addition of M Burger is also a good pickup.  If you gotta eat in a tourist-laden location like Water Tower, you could do a whole lot worse than Foodlife.",0.842,0.85,0.103,0.047,0.5378030303030302

Mostly it was just the people working that made the whole experience underwhelming. Every one of the employees did not seem properly trained or interested in their task. The people cleaning the tables cleaned your ""reserved"" table before you are done. At the ""stir fry"" station the workers never called out when your order was ready, and if they did, you wouldn't hear them anyway because the music was too loud. A PA system would be useful for this. I saw other patrons annoyed at the same things that bother me. A lady at a table near me waited 20 minutes for her food, she came up to the counter and asked for her order and the man told her, ""oh it's over there, it was ready like a while ago"". I had a chicken stir-fry and it was over-sauced, salty, and too sweet. I would compare it to ""Pei Wei"" style, but the veggies seemed less fresh. The drink selection was decent, with a noteworthy assortment of iced teas. If I were to come again I would try ""GRILL"", which is a station where you can get grilled fish and other meats. The value is terrible. For two stir-fry dishes, two sodas, and a dessert the total was over $38.

They advertise that they serve real food made from scratch and the food certainly looks like it.  I settled on an individual deep dish pepperoni pizza, because I hadn't tried that iconic Chicago dish yet.  But the barbeque kitchen looked terrific as did the taqueria stall.  My pizza was good considering the pie was pre-prepared and warmed in an oven for a few minutes.  There was lots of great tasting tomato sauce but it seemed skimpy on the pepperoni.  Maybe it's a Chicago thing, but the pizza I had in Chicago all seemed to skimp on toppings. foodlife is a cute concept, trendy, and the food looks fresh and tempting.  I almost returned for a second visit, something I'll definitely do on my next trip to Chicago.  The concept gets 4* but until I try more items, I give the food 3*.",0.9631,0.867,0.106,0.027,0.4502267573696145

It's not cheap--we figured our ""food court"" lunch would be the cheapest meal of the week, and it turned out to be one of the most expensive.  And the staff is a little too eager to clear the table; we went to get ice cream and came back to a cleared table.  We stole some silverware from another table and finished eating.

Other foods in the showcase included various breakfast sandwiches, pastries (something that appeared to be a cinnamon roll with icing) and bagels.  I chose the scrambled eggs with peppers and seasonings, peppered bacon and the breakfast potatoes with red peppers and onions. I took packets of salt and pepper because I always season my eggs.

It's not some ""mall food court"" - no, this is the Disneyworld of Mall Food Courts if you want to think of it that way.  First, you are properly welcomed (by aromas!) but also by the greeter/host. You are handed a plastic card and then taken to a table that has become ""reserved"" for you. Run wild now in this theme park of food...charge like you are a ten-year-old with your parents' credit card! Hand it over every counter from which you want to receive some sustenance.  Pizza, salad, soups, mexican food, stir-fry, sushi....(There's also beer, wine, soft drinks & tea - the latter two are self-serve & all you can drink.)  I usually get crazy with the build-your-own stir fry.

NOPE! She agilely handed it up and over the counter where it was wok-ed up hot by the ready chef.  When you are finished enjoying your visit...flip your ""reserved"" indicator to ""finished"" (or whatever, I don't recall exactly the word) and pop up to the exit. Here, you hand over that little plastic card & pay to exit. (Kind of the opposite of a theme park where you pay to get in, but you won't be throwing up any of this food after riding too many rides!)

I got three bowls (well, I finished two and a half): Turkey chili - hearty and meaty; you can't really tell it's turkey, which is good. Not that much spice to it, but still pretty good. Clam chowder - not too creamy, but you could tell there was decent sized clams in it. Chicken noodle - pretty salty (or maybe MSG-y). The noodles were in fun shapes, but I couldn't finish it in good conscience. We looked around and saw some pretty appetizing looking food, but we stayed disciplined enough to just stick to the soup.

2012-12-28,4.0,"Probably one of the most diverse selections of hot and cold foods in one place that I have ever experienced. If you can't find something that you would enjoy, I don't know what it is that you are looking for. Everything (with the exception of bread and baked goods, which are sold by the piece) is sold by fixed price weight- if you are not a good estimator of what your selections will weigh, you may be surprised to have a larger bill than you expected at check-out. I was there during the lunch hour and made myself a nice salad out of the large number of choices offered. I noticed too late that they had ""wedge"" lettuce available, perhaps the thing to do is to look around a bit before starting to load up your plate? Overall everything that I took from the salad bar looked fresh and inviting. There was 8-10 different salad dressings available in easy-serve carafes. Plastic ""to-go"" containers are available for those who would like to take home a ready-prepared meal to enjoy later. Plates and cardboard (wax lined) containers are discounted (my recyclable box earned a 90 cent discount on my bill at the cashier). I was surprised and pleased that actual ""metal"" eating utensils are given for use rather than plastic disposables. TIP: check out the baked goods section for something to go with your meal. I tried a Jalapeño corn muffin and was very pleased. This is probably not a good choice for people having young children because 1- things are at ""adult"" height and youngsters will not be able to see what is available 2- there are so many choices that children may be visually overwhelmed. Other sit-down dining options in the Mezzanine area might be better for families and those with young children. Tables in Foodlife are somewhat limited but there are ""common"" tables for use around the elevator area.  If you are with a group, be prepared to get past the ""need"" to sit together at one table, it will not kill you to break up into groups of 4-6 people per table for the few minutes that you are dining. During my visit I observed families picking out a table and then abandoning it to get their food. I feel that it would be probably a better strategy to leave at least one adult at the table while everyone else picked out what they want. Predictably, people who wanted a place to sit during the noon hour rush took over what a reasonable person would assume were empty tables.

Unless you like high prices for poor quality food, throngs of tourists, and club music ghetto-blasting in a dirty cafeteria, DO NOT GO HERE.  I spent $13 on two medium sized vegetable and cheese raviolis (dried and stale at the end of day) and a small fountain drink. The pasta bar is one of the worst places in the entire food court and should be removed in my opinion. You'll notice that the pasta bar has NO LINE, for good reason.  Pretty much everything aside from the desert looks stale and decrepit by evening, especially the pizza and hotdogs which remind you of the disease ridden rotisserie ""meat"" in 7-11, not to mention they charge like $7 for Chicago style hot dogs! You don't get a waiter but I think they charge you MANDATORY GRATUITY anyway for someone to show you how to find a table and sit down.

This is a weird place.  LEYE has tinkered with the offerings a little bit, but so much of it is regrettable: the pizza slices are dry and have a paltry amount of toppings, the little sushi trays are the same packages you'd get at grocery stores, and a lot of the Mexican food looks overcooked and bland.  Sure, everyone can get whatever they want, but you're still in a cafeteria. Tip: You can try to ask the manager politely if they'll turn the music down; seriously, it's that loud!  Also, the additional service charge they add can be removed if you ask the cashier during check-out.

However, if they are promoting sanitary conditions (their statement was washing hands prevents flus and colds), why do they not sanitize those red cards that they give you upon entry? You know they reuse those things all the time. I think that has to be unsanitary. Also, paying at the end may be a good thing or bad thing. We encountered a long line paying. However, I suppose that it is better to get your food when you are hungry first and then pay after you have eaten. I had some of the Japanese sushi, seaweed salad and noodles which were decent.

The food is delicious, the prices are decent, and the atmosphere is really cool. The concept obviously works, and it is one that definitely needs to be replicated or expanded. Be careful not to go overboard. I know if I was not kept in check by the people I was dining with, I easily could have spent $50.",0.966,0.827,0.163,0.01,0.5453125000000001
2011-07-11,5.0,"LOVE IT!  Perfect for a group or family that doesn't always want the same thing.  You wait in line, are shown to your seat, handed a ""credit card"", and told to choose your food.  There were somewhere around 10 different food stations.  I choose the brisket meal, but at my table other people were eating sushi, burgers, pizza, fried chicken, salad and soup, and chicken fingers.  Perfect!  It's nice when you have kids because instead of rummaging for cash to send your kids for their chicken fingers while you wait at the sushi stand, they have their own card to swipe.   Everyone at my table was impressed with their food.  Since it was a busy Saturday afternoon, I imagine the food was fresher than it may be on a weekday or so.   Crepes and cupcakes for dessert were AMAZING.  Smoothie bar is a good touch, too.  When you leave, you have to hand in your cards (make sure nobody lost theirs), and that's when you pay. Wish they had something like that at every mall!",0.9918,0.745,0.221,0.034,0.7649305555555557
2011-07-10,4.0,"Went here after a nice day downtown for the first time and I was really impressed.  Basically when you walk in you are given green credit cards, once you figure out what you want to eat at each station, you give the card to the cashier and they swipe it. When you leave, that's when you pay. I really like this system although might be easy to go overboard. Someone then shows you to a table and flips over a card saying that this table has been reserved and then you are free to look around.  For the food stations, they had a grill station, comfort food, sushi, BBQ, Big Bowl, Stir fry, dessert, pizza, and soup. They also had a restaurant in the back but I didn't see too much of it. I had a tough time figuring out what I wanted to eat so I walked around a lot. I was stuck between Big Bowl, pizza and the BBQ. I was also considering sushi but the prices seemed too high for the amount they were giving you. The pizza looked amazing and had big slices. The BBQ station had pulled pork but I didn't get to see a sample of it, if I had I think i might have ordered that instead of Big Bowl. So I chose Big Bowl, the portions were nice, I wish they would have had maybe another dish, they only had 2 chicken dishes and 2 beef ones.  The prices seemed a little steep to me but I remembered that it was the Water Tower Place so everything is a little higher, everything averaged about $9.

After wandering around the options, I ordered a barbecued pulled chicken sandwich, with some difficulty. The man behind the counter at the BBQ station didn't acknowledge my order, asked for my side three times, didn't make eye contact, and left my food sitting on the counter. And then he yelled at the next people in line, who were waiting patiently, to move down to the other end of the counter and hurry up. Clearly we must have been distracting him from something important.  The chicken was disgusting, to say the least. The mac and cheese was actually pretty good, but that was about the only good thing on our table. My mom had a make-it-yourself-salad that was WAY too salty and the lettuce wasn't entirely fresh.

But then... we experienced it. We waited to be seated and were each given a ""credit card"" to swipe the items we were eating. We all ordered different items and had drinks. I had a homemade veggie burger (sub par + sub par fries-- you know it's sub par when you must put lots of mustard on). I would say that it was a thick veggie burger, though. The only thicker I've ever had was at JAlexanders in Oak Brook. The others ordered sandwiches-- beef brisket and some pulled pork sandwich with sides. When we went to check out, it came to about $35. I thought it was a good price and I was pleased with the variety from the ""10 different restaurants"" you can choose from. Maybe next time I'll choose a pan pizza (showed a special on our table for $7 with drink), Asian wok, or soup. Who knows. Possibilities are endless. I like most that we all got what we wanted, no one had to compromise, and we could pay on one tab (or separate) at the end. We put all 3 on one tab since it was company-paid.

2010-08-07,4.0,"I had dinner at Foodlife Thursday night for my first ever visit to the highly acclaimed food court. Right off the bat I was impressed with the selection and set-up (use of a charge card, pay at the end). Knowing the quality is top notch from the LEYE people, any choice is bound to be tasty. You can pick from Chinese, stir fry, meats from the grill, sushi, salads, desserts, etc. Since you pay at the end, if you leave discipline and discretion at the door, it could make for a long and tasty meal. Out of our group of 5, 3 of us went for the make-it-yourself stir fry station, Erica grabbed a pulled pork sandwich while Tali balanced us out with a salad. Everyone was happy with their selection and there wasn't a dirty plate by the end of the meal. The only complication came with my dish. See if you can notice the ""extra"" ingredient that doesn't belong. If you guessed ""rubber band,"" you'd be correct. That circle piece of rubber does not belong in my chicken stir fry. I didn't make a stink, but I did tell the manager. He offered me a new dish but I liked what I made so I just kept on eating (I don't regard a rubber band as unsanitary as ""human"" elements). Anyway, he combed my dish and offered the table desserts. I approve of the professionalism and customer care delivered. Like most concepts LEYE, this one is a hit. It's a simple idea, serve really good food in a ""food court"" setting and people will pay for it.

2010-05-09,5.0,"I have been super obsessed with Foodlife since I went on a field trip to The Big City in fourth grade and my whole class ate here. It was a life-changing experience. I grew up two hundred miles north of Chicago, and I gotta tell you, in the mid-nineties? There was not much restaurant food to be had outside of Friday fish fries and brats. (Which are great, don't get me wrong, but not particularly inspiring.) So Foodlife was a revelation. Seriously. There was this one restaurant where I could buy tacos and bowls of noodles with mysterious spices and tasty pasta and pizza and sushi and all kinds of things my young Upper Midwestern eyes had never seen before. I think I ate, like, half my weight in food. For years afterward, I insisted that a visit to Foodlife be part of every trip to the city with friends, family, or very large high school choirs. I have dozens of pictures with every imaginable permutation of my childhood groups of friends eating at Foodlife. WHERE ELSE would you even eat? (Now I know: in every other neighborhood in this city. Crazy! But I was young and naive then.) Now that I actually live here, I eat at Foodlife like two or three times a year, mostly around the holidays when I find myself spending long, long days wandering the streets hoping to find a thoughtful yet inexpensive gift for each of my twenty-two first cousins. I still love it. Doggedly. I will never, ever suggest that Foodlife is anything less than the pinnacle of excellence and wonder. When visitors come to the city and go to (or even mention) Foodlife, I squeal with joy and excitement. With that said... Foodlife would be EVEN MORE awesome if they had a Taste of Chicago-type thing going on, where you could buy smaller portions of their food. Because all of it's pretty good, you know? And I'd like to be able to have more than one thing on each of my visits, because the truly glorious thing about having a restaurant with so many stations is that you could, in theory, ""eat the world."" (When did they drop that tag line? It's a shame, I tell you.) But you can't. Unless you have way more friends and/or money and/or gastrointestinal fortitude than I do.

The system was quick and efficient: hand the ID to a disinterested person sitting at the front door, who would swipe it through some sort of a Bozoputer that deducted one of my ten allotted meals for the week. No money changed hands; it was quick, and a George Jetson-esque way of accessing coral-colored shrimp etoufee on a bed of flavorless rice. Fast forward to 2010. I am, once again, using a card to rustle up some chow. Cro-magnon man, who needed implements like handmade spears and self-crafted fish traps, etc., for survival, shakes his head in disappointment. I am also reminded of a college cafeteria because there are several stations which offer different varieties of food at each. Specifically, the cafeteria at the University of Kansas, which I visited as a wide-eyed senior in high school and seriously considered enrolling on the strength solely of the fact that one of the stations offered fried mozzarella sticks on an all-you-can-eat basis. Sadly, Foodlife does not offer unlimited portions, because if they did I'd personally deplete them of their supply of hot wings and shrimp scampi. The latter was surprisingly good, full of flavor and the shrimp had a nice grilled taste and weren't the least bit dried out as one might expect in a cafeteria-type setting. The difference is that your card is swiped after you choose your food, and again as you exit when you pay. Want to split the check?

I was a little afraid to order anywhere as I saw how mean people were being to customers...especially to little old ladies who can barely even hear.  My food was average at best. I went to the Italian station and had a breaded chicken entree. A bit overcooked as were the vegetables that came with it.  I couldn't find a soda machine so I had to walk out with an empty plastic cup - I then went to the pizza station where they grunted to fill my cup with soda even when I showed them the receipt that I had already paid.

In the hustle and bustle of life, options always sound great and what matters isn't the quality of food or service, but the sound byte you leave someone with. This is my problem with Foodlife. Whenever I've been on Michigan Avenue at Borders or H&M or LUSH, I try to think of somewhere to eat. Maybe someplace fast, or cheap, or that will satisfy the tastes of myself and my compatriots. That's when I think, ""I know! We'll go to Foodlife!"" Why do I always think that? The thing is, I do value choice. We Americans love choice! So the option of getting sushi, stir-fry, pizza, sandwiches, Italian, Mexican, soup, salads, or comfort food is amazing in theory. Except it's always so bad. I mean, really, really bad. The best you can hope for at Foodlife is bland, mediocre food for too much money. I've had that happen a couple of times, like with the ravioli at the Italian stall or the crepes at the Dessert area. But mostly, my food is just not good at all. The Mexican food is somewhere between ballpark food and overpriced Chipotle. The pizzas sit on racks, waiting for the next order. Once, I got a panini sandwich that took 15 minutes an was burnt (I meant black all over burnt) and terrible. And it's always twice as much as you expected. You leave, thinking you've been frugal, and then realize that your sandwich, juice, and cup of soup somehow came to $20.00. How does that happen? I always think I'll like Foodlife.

Also, there was no clear sense as to where you were to order or where the line was. Some girls were waiting for their order to come up but they were standing where the line was, so they were in the way. Meanwhile another girl just randomly cut in line in front of me, I guess taking advantage of all the confusion, or because she too couldn't figure out the flow.  As for the food, the smoothie I got (Mango Tango: mango, peach and orange) tasted like canned peaches with some tang from the mango. Not worth the $4-something bucks I shelled out. The frozen yoghurt that they sell at the juice bar looked pretty good, topped with fresh fruit, but you'd still have to deal with the same screwed-up serving line. Food Life has a lot of other things to offer (sushi, rotisserie, stir-fry, pizza, bakery, etc.), so maybe some of that is better organized and tasted better too.

Only thing is, from looking at the other yelp reviews, I'm kinda afraid that the food quality may've decreased, in the 8-10 years it's been since I've last eaten here.

Finally, about 6 months ago I was sitting down to eat and I saw this guy setting silverware at cleared tables.  I saw him REPEATEDLY cough and wipe his nose with his hands, and use the same dirty hands to set silverware at the table.  I was so incredibly grossed out.  However, I have not seen that guy since the offense. Bottom line, Foodlife trumps most mall food courts.",0.9889,0.758,0.18,0.062,0.6264670514670513

I guess it covers the maintenance and cleaning ot tables but still.....",0.3365,0.837,0.09,0.073,0.6916666666666667
2005-10-19,3.0,"Foodlife is a great concept and works well for those who like freedom and variety. There are tons of stations where you can pick many different types and varieties of foods to suit your needs. You receive a card that looks like a credit card and whenever you order somethng, your card is swiped and you pay at the end for everything. Overall it is not your average food court. It's a bit swankier. I found the service to be very unfriendly and hostile, though. If you are looking for exemplary customer service, this is NOT the place. If you are looking for quick food with tons of options, then this is the place for you!",0.9049,0.801,0.144,0.055,0.43571428571428567

2005-08-30,3.0,"This is sort of the food court of Water Tower Place. They have various stalls with different ethnic foods like Asian, Mexican, Italian, etc. The food is OK and there is a decent variety, but the convenience of eating within the mall without leaving it is the biggest deal.",0.4052,0.925,0.075,0.0,0.3238095238095238

As others mentioned, be careful of the prices! Everything is swiped on a card and you pay the cashier at the end.

Food was good and filling, prices a little high but what do you expect at this location? My only quibble is that you get a little swipe card when you come in and all your charges are placed on the card and you pay it when you leave.
