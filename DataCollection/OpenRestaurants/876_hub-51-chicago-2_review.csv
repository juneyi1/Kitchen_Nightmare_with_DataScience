We started with the guacamole which is fresh and has corn on the bottom of the bowel. Great combination. The ahi tuna poke is one of the best I've had. Beautiful red tuna ! We shared the chicken tacos which they split for us. It had so much flavor I combined all the beans, rice, tomatoes, etc in the juice of the pulled chicken bowl. Last time we were here the salmon I had was far better than Shaw's.  I never get a bad meal here. First look of the menu looks like bar food with sandwiches and tacos. If you look closer there are some real food gems.  The guacamole and chips are a good start. We tried the shaki shaki tuna which was small tuna chunks on rice cakes. Delicious! We always like the 3 green bites with edamame, shishito peppers and tempura green beans.  The sushi rolls are good, I had the salmon special and it had a nice outside char with a wonderful moistness inside. The fish tacos are construct your own with mahi mahi.

We didn't mind so much at first until about half way through our meal when I noticed the other girl was still there finishing up her side work. She was still there working when we left........it was a bit weird. The Tempura Sweet Potato was the most flavorful with the creamy combination of avocado and potato;  the Spicy Tuna had good Tuna, but the sesame seeds completely overwhelmed the roll; the Spicy Shrimp and King Crab was  messy as the roll easily fell apart and the crab and shrimp on top slipped off.

The burgers and sandwiches are good choices to get when you come here.  The pulled chicken nachos are also delicious, but some of the tacos aren't as exciting as they sound on the menu.  To drink, I typically stick with their Hub Punch (really good btw), or one of the wines from their menu.  Carrot cake lovers should make it a priority to try the carrot cake.  I can honestly say that the Hub 51 carrot cake is one of the best I've had from any restaurant in Chicago.",0.9837,0.791,0.184,0.026,0.527689393939394

2017-07-02,5.0,"This review is 4.5 stars.  We went Saturday for brunch. We arrived at 11:45 am, the restaurant was only 20% full. Our server was helpful and knew the menu well for recommendations and any questions we had. We started off with orange juice and the breakfast nachos. The orange juice was fresh and delightful ($4). The nachos were amazing! Much better than what we were expecting. It was loaded with guac, egg and cheese. It came with a mild salsa that wad addicting! The tortilla chip was light and crispy but still was able to hold all the ingredients up. We started to get full just by eating the nachos! The portion is fairly generous for the price ($10.95). We both agreed that we wish we had the option to add a protein to the nachos. Maybe some chorizo or al pastor.   For our mains, he got buttermilk pancakes ($9.95) with a side of bacon ($4.95) and chicken sausage ($4.95). I got the hash brown benedict with chicken sausage. ($11.95). The buttermilk pancakes were standard. A bit overpriced for what it is but they got the job done. The bacon was delicious- sweet and salty! It was thick-cut but still managed to have some crunch to it. The chicken sausage was a bit on the sweeter side (probably from the apple and maple) but still very good. For my benedict, the eggs were perfectly poached and presentation wise was beautiful. However, I thought it tasted just ok. The hash browns were too salty and not crispy. The hollandaise didn't have much flavour. It only comes with one sausage link, split in half. I also wish it came with a side salad. It did get plated with two roasted cherry tomatoes that were very sweet- wish there was more!  We were too stuffed for dessert- but if you have room, the carrot cake is a must! (I had it previously). It is AMAZING! Our total came out to be around $55 which was not bad for brunch in river north. I think we will definitely be back.

We only had one dish with our cocktails, the hummus with Israeli tabouleh and it was outstanding, just amazing. The brunch food was also great, and so was the service from our server then as well.  A lot of fun.  Love the kale margarita, loved the breakfast tacos (the black beans with a little crema were delicious, and the eggs an cheese were also great; the soft corn tortillas were tasty and easy to manipulate to build your taco).  Everyone at our table enjoyed their dishes.  My wife had the hash brown Benedict (bacon) and she loved it.  The hash browns were great, nice a crispy and tasty.  Nice clever innovative idea on the hash brown Benedict. I came here because in reading a review of a different nearby restaurant, one reviewer was unhappy and noted she had a much better time at Hub 51 after leaving that other restaurant. Well, I'm very glad I took her advice.  We're definitely returning to Hub 51 when returning to Chicago.  Oh and it's part of the Lettuce Eats group, where you actually earn rewards points for your business.  This group has a very good selection of restaurants and is one of the more generous rewards programs I've seen.  Kudos.",0.999,0.695,0.295,0.011,0.6701752021563344

The restaurant is not big enough either to satisfy demand. We had an 8pm reservation and weren't seated until 8:40 and there were open tables when we sat down which was annoying. The management definitely took care of us so no points off for that. I just feel like this place is very blah for River North. They don't execute anything really well. Everything we had (Nachos, Burgers, Tacos) were good but not great.

For no good reason other than they are so darn nice, they gave us a large piece of AMAZING carrot cake for dessert.

She was also keen on letting me know sushi was half-off until 6 p.m. if I wanted a nibble while I waited. Lovely. Seated, our nondescript server huffed and puffed and finally brought our rounds. She was as lovely as shoe leather. Not that I need bubbles with smiles - I don't - but I also don't want to feel like a burden. She brought the wrong beer to me (my second beer, so the first would have been listed in the system), didn't come back to ask how our food was, we had to ask another server for a few additions.

The birthday girl ordered sushi and said that the fish was definitely not fresh. Another friend of mine ordered the avocado kale salad and had a hard time finding any avocado at all. All of the cocktails were tequila based so there wasn't much variety there. The free birthday dessert they brought was a carrot cake which is a weird choice because it is not as easily liked as a vanilla cake might be.

I went the 1st night and had the adobo chicken with cauliflower couscous.  It was delicious!  The boneless chicken thighs were flavorful and juicy; the cauliflower couscous was light, not really cooked but cured and so tasty!  I was really impressed with the food and service. I was so impressed that I went back for a 2nd dinner.  I happened to arrive during their happy hour when all the sushi rolls were half off. Normally, I would not order sushi at a restaurant like Hub 51 but since lots of other reviews mentioned the sushi positively, I thought, why not? The sushi was dried out.  The fish did not seem that fresh and the rice seemed dry, like it had been sitting around.  The fish did not have that sheen that fresh sushi does.  The tuna inside the roll seemed dark and dull.  I wanted to believe that it was better than it looked and ate it anyway.   I ordered the famous carrot cake.  Unfortunately, the frosting tasted like freezer burn.  I let the waitress know and she brought me a new piece - which had the exact same problem!  This morning, I am getting ready to board my flight home.  My stomach was upset all night ; I have been vomiting and nauseous all morning and suffering all of the classic food poisoning symptoms.  In short, I feel like death.  I am seriously bummed because the next 5 hours on the plane are going to suuuuuuck.   I would say stay away from those rolls.  The cooked traditional food was great - saw another table with the chicken nachos that were served in a plate the size of a hubcap!  But their sushi is not worth it.  I am paying the price this morning...",0.9308,0.746,0.143,0.111,0.5409722222222223

The food could have been great but small errors added up and it just fell flat. My wife and I shared the Brussel Sprout salad and the Tuna Poke. The tuna was super-fresh and had the subtle flavor of great tuna. That was unfortunately overtaken by excessive large pieces of fresh ginger and nothing but the rice to balance it out. Even a little bit of soy would have tamed the ginger. The salad had wonderful components with the cheese, dates and nuts. The dressing was non-existent which it so desperately needed. With the dressing described on the menu, I doubt it would have been possible to overdress the salad. For the entree my wife had the fish tacos. The fish was  cooked perfectly and the salsa verde and slaw were a nice garnish. The guacamole was pretty average with it being about as memorable as the stuff you buy pre-made at a store. If you are putting something with a more expensive fish, it should bring the dish up not down. The beans and rice were completely devoid of flavor including salt. I had the fish sandwich with sweet potato fries. The sandwich was well balanced with a great crunchy batter and tangy acidity in the condiments. The chipotle aoli went well with it as well. The best course by far was desert with the Caramel butterscotch shot. It was very rich but perfect in the small portion. The service of course was top notch.

We ordered two of the hunch punch, a spicy tuna crab roll, miso soup, pork tacos, and the ahi tuna burger with fries.  The sushi was atrocious. The rice was so sticky, it was difficult to peel the sushi off of the plate without breaking it in half. What they labeled as crab, might have been a piece of painted plastic. For $15 I did not expect the world's best sushi, however i expected something a little more edible... especially since they boast more than 6 different rolls on their menu. I will admit that the sushi came with a spicy mayo sauce that we both really enjoyed. Next, we had the miso soup. 5$ a bowl... kind of a steep price for something that costs 50 cents for a packet at the grocery store.  My pork tacos were just ok. The actual meat was very smokey and good, but everything else it came with had little to no flavor.  My friend raved about her tuna burger and i stole a few of her fries that had a delicious seasoning.  The main reason I gave such a poor review was because the entire hour and a half that we were there, our server could not have been less attentive. Not once did she ask us how our food was tasting. Given that we went through three different courses, one could imagine that she could have stopped by for even a quick glance. Second, I could see her standing at the bar talking to someone i assume was another server the entire meal. My friend's drink was empty over half the meal and only when we were finished eating did she ask if we would like another. We declined because we decided that we would go elsewhere for another cocktail.

Their menu interestingly seems to have some form of identity crisis as it ranges from sushi rolls to sandwiches to tacos. That said if anything I'd probably stick to the sandwiches at they range from $12-15 and are probably the most filling compared to what you're paying for.

When we told her we wanted to split the taco entrée she was so nice enough to see that we had our own separate plates of food versus just brining out one to share, which meant that we got extra beans and rice and topping for the tacos. She was also good about checking on us often enough to where we didn't feel like she disappeared unlike most restaurants when it's busy. The icing on the cake was when one of the managers came by to greet us and inquire about our dinning experience (I totally forgot his name).

The waitress looked at me like I was nuts and said that she's never heard of anyone ordering it like that. I responded letting her know I've eaten it plenty of times before specifically at this establishment. When my rolls came out there were 4 of each. I immediately made a comment. For starters I'm paying 13-14$ essentially for a basic roll that I can get anywhere for 8$ (that's not the problem bc I specifically chose to dine at this establishment and knew what I was getting into). But 4 pieces of each when typically it comes with 8 pieces (I have picture from last time I was there and ordered riceless sushi). I made a comment and she fought me on it immediately saying that no one has ever ordered it that way and this roll has more fish (still confused what the amount of fish has to do with rice). To be clear rice is not a binding ingredient, the rice is on the outside of the roll not the Inside. I also, did not come to a restaurant to get in an altercation with a waitress and I already went back and forth with her long enough. I said whatever at that point and ate the order I was given. Pretty disappointed in myself for not taking a picture but I'm horrified that a lettuce entertain you restaurant had such an inconsistency with their service and experience. *side note: I'm totally a frequent diner as in at least once a week, and I have not been back since last month",-0.8792,0.882,0.041,0.077,0.3711309523809524

I found out, it was sitting there for 20 - 25 minutes.  Really..... Per the MOD, it's a new app this restaurant has just started to use and they are still working the kinks out.    My question..... if you have food sitting on a shelf for this long, wouldn't you follow up the the guest or the ""app"" company?  You would think a like company LEYE would make sure all of the apps would be working properly before going live???

That said, most of their food is quite good. * Pulled Chicken Nachos - $14.95.  Those are some expensive nachos.  Though its not on the menu, you can get a half-order of these and it was still a significant stack.  The chicken is tasty, the chips are warm and the little carafe of semi-spicy salsa is a nice touch.  I wish the lower nachos got the chicken/cheese/salsa love their upstairs brothers got, but sometimes you're the bottom chip in a big stack and you just have to deal with it. * Big City Cornbread - $8.50.  Again, crazy expensive for cornbread.  That said, the cornbread was great.  Very moist and the butter melted into its surface as soon as it made contact.  I was a fan, but it should cost $6, tops. * El Segundo Sol Burger - $13.50.  A real winner.  The burger was cooked perfectly.  All the toppings came together for a slightly spicy symphony.  This was the best thing I ate here.  I wish the fries themselves were tastier, but the spice rub on them really saved the day. * Filet Mignon Steak Tacos - $19.95.  Not even close to worth it.  The steak was tender but flavorless.  It's also one of these deals where you have to assemble it yourself.  For $20 dollars, I could get three Chipotle burritos assembled to my liking.  This is an unacceptable price for a bland set of tacos. If I were to return to Hub 51, I'd just get the burger and skip all the other stuff.  The prices are goofy-high for what you get.

First off, we got the pulled pork nachos. These were pretty good. I liked the thin chips and it was a decent way to start the dinner. Then ,we both ordered taco plates... A fish and steak. They came what they called homemade tortillas. Usually that means tortillas they make there and are fresh. Well, they weren't. They got cold fast and weren't not very appetizing with the small amount of toppings they supply on the plate that you have to put on yourself. Some of the worst tacos ever.  What saved the night was the dessert. I got the pudding pie and my wife the carrot cake. Both were so fuckin god damn good. But it was a waste of a night as far as dinner. Writing this review my stats went from 3 to a 2. It really wasn't that great but I would honestly come for dessert.  One more thing, the place is like a high class sports bar with 2 tv's.

The bad: ~ Side of fries served with Chicken French Dip ~ kind of funny how our waitress was raving about them but I found them to be over seasoned, stale, and soggy. Yuck! Needless to say, I didn't come close to finishing them.  Final Notes: Make sure to put in a reservation if you're coming in for dinner. This is a prime location in River North area so it does get crowded on weekends! Late nights there's a small club downstairs called ""Sub 51"" if you fancy getting yo' groove on.

It's a great place for groups and guests, because there is something for everybody. The sushi rolls are not that great, so I would recommend going to a specialty place for that. I absolutely love the filet mignon tacos! They are amazing! Savory, sweet, not too salty. I've had them multiple times, it's my go to dish. On one occasion they arrived fatty and gristly, and well, quite frankly, it was nasty. I didn't complain, but the waitress took just one look at it, and she voluntarily took it back! I was happy. What was the chef thinking? It's a fairly expensive dish too. At any rate, he made me a new plate and it was perfect! So aces to the waitress for her customer service! I also love their Chips and Guacamole! They use roasted corn in the dip and fresh chips. It's a great starter dish, served right in the molcajete. Negative Spot: One thing I really dislike at Hub 51 are the couples seating, back-to-back high top tables/chairs. I avoid this section altogether and will refuse to sit there any longer. This is because whatever stranger, who gets seated behind you, has his or her tall chair-back against yours. Every time that person moves, you move too, getting bumped throughout your meal, and probably vise versa whenever you move or adjust in your seat. All the other seats are normal and not touching. Get there early. Make a reservation. Don't just walk-in and expect a seat, it gets busy (that's a good thing). The tables are reserved. It's not just a bar.

Love their brunch, easy to go with baby.  Plenty of noise, music, and things to distract her.  And even if she fusses, there's enough background noise to not annoy the other patrons.  You can still hear your dining companions though. The St. Germain and OJ is the best version of a mimosa.  A tad bit sweet, I think it could be made even better with a splash of champagne. Lemon Ricotta pancakes are tasty and light, good to share.  Chicken Nachos are always a must (pretty sure they have them all day, every day). The tacos are good too and so is the brekkie sandwich.  Wasn't in love with the turkey omlet, but it was fine.  Portions on pretty much everything are substantial and good to share. If you feel like dancing at night, you can do SUB 51, which was fun.  Went there a few times when I was younger and for a bachelorette party.  Hard to get a drink at the bar in the main restaurant sometimes, especially if you're short like me.

Neither of our first selections (herb chicken and huevos rancheros) were available, so we decided on tacos: beef for my son and fish for me. Surprisingly, our meals were identical except for the protein - no cabbage slaw with the fish, just the standard rice and beans. The tortillas were bland and soggy and the fish was dry and tasteless, but the steak was cooked perfectly and the rice and beans were some of the best I've had. My youngest had a standard chicken strips and fries kids' meal & seemed to enjoy it. So overall, a very mixed experience.

That salad was entree size!  For the main, our options were fish tacos and a spicy cheeseburger and we ended up switching plates halfway through the meal. Both were awesome, but it's been so long since I've had a perfectly cooked medium burger that I couldn't resist.  Dessert was probably the least exciting part of the meal, but still tasty.

Great start. (2) We had two little kids (3 and ~6 months) in our party.  One of those kids (the 3 year old) has a peanut allergy.  Not only was our server (Max) super sweet and fun with him, but he was also really vigilant about making sure nothing he, his parents, or anyone else at the table ordered contained peanuts.  It put everyone at ease and was super appreciated.   Overall:  Hub 51 is a very solid choice for brunch in the city.",0.9987,0.701,0.246,0.053,0.562088888888889

Avocado and jicama married well, but the dish lacked salt and spice. The accompanying chips were bland and mostly from the bottom of the bag.  From what I remember, the French Dip was first-rate. Quality sliced prime rib, fresh roll, au jus, and horseradish sauce all paired well. Not sure about the price tag ($19.99), but it's the city so it's to be expected.

I expected a margarita with fresh passion fruit in it--that would have bumped the score a bit and added a fresh tropical touch. We ordered several sushi roles--all good--fish was fine and ingredients and presentation were nice.

2015-09-10,4.0,"I always feel a little sheepish when I recommend this place to others - I know it's not a foodie mecca or anything, but I'm sorry, you just cannot beat the quality and variety of food for the price.  I'm (roughly) the same age as RJ and Jerrod Melman (the creators of Hub 51) and I always tell people, ""Imagine that you and your friends opened a restaurant - you'd be like, 'OK, the vibe should be fun but not crazy, and for food ... let's have sushi, some mexican, some american staples, and let's make sure it tastes amazing ... we need a delicious signature drink ... let's have a place downstairs for dancing ... and it has to be affordable...' and that's essentially what the Melman brothers did with Hub 51."" There are so many dishes I love , but I definitely find myself craving their ahi tuna poke on the regular. The nachos are crazy good, the burgers are fantastic - I've not had a bad meal here. Their brunch is CRAZY good. I've also had my birthday party here before, and their events team was so awesome - we designed a set menu of family style dishes, and they printed up little menus personalized for my birthday. And come to think of it, despite the fact that this place is usually packed when I go, I've never had bad or particularly slow service. Only reason I'm not issuing five stars is because this restaurant isn't, by definition, a five-star dining experience; you will not have the best service of your life here. You may have to wait longer than your specified reservation. It will be loud. So it's four stars when looking across the dining spectrum - but for what it is - an affordable tasty meal in a super fun atmosphere - it IS the best of the best.",0.9968,0.723,0.225,0.053,0.5525946275946277

When we arrived at the front entrance, an employee with a badge (looked sort of like a hotel employee) attempted to card us. Keep in mind this was 9:50 PM and the place did not remind us of any sort of ""club"". He looked at our IDs for a minute or so and told us he needed to card ""because it was late night"". Confused, we entered the eatery.  The dinning room was basically empty, with three or four parties seated. The carding really made no sense, and it threw off the whole experience. The restaurant was completely dead inside. A server quickly came over and took drink orders, carding us again. Service was decent but rushed throughout the meal. We sampled the fish tacos and the pulled pork tacos. Both were decent, although the fish was somewhat dry. The pulled pork tasted good at first in the iron skillet, but I quickly realized how much grease had accumulated at the bottom of the dish.

Honestly, we chose Hub 51 because we literally had to pass it & Yelp said it was pretty good so here goes...  The place was pretty busy on a weekday but we were able to grab a spot at the bar. We weren't planning a full sit down meal so, why not? The bar area has plenty of tables (which were open as well) & TV's to watch your fav team while you enjoy a drink or two.  They had the seasonal Goose Island radler on tap & I decided to try it. I would say it's shandyish with some grapefruit flavors. It was good for a hot summer night but one or two glasses would be my limit.  I moved on to their Old fashioned, which was good but the bourbon was a little rough.  Since we were trying to have a light meal, the hubs & I shared Shrimp ceviche & the prime rib french dip. The ceviche came out lightening fast & was a pretty solid appetizer. It needed a dash of salt & the chips they served it with were flimsy (they kept breaking every time you would try to scoop the ceviche) but it had really good flavor & hit the spot.  The prime rib french dip was really terrific. The sandwich was about $19, but worth every single penny. The prime rib was flavorful, tender & juicy & served on garlic bread. It came with a sauce but all you needed was the au jus to complete the perfect sandwich. Hands down it was definitely the VERY BEST french dip I've ever had.  I am very interested in going back to try the rest of the food on the menu because if it's as good as the french dip was, I'll be in love!",0.9975,0.773,0.22,0.007,0.49097535505430245

This year, however, I wanted to bring a larger group of people for dinner here since I had to limit it last year, and found out their large group (12+ people) arrangement/policies are really pretty terrible....... For a group of 12+ you have to do family-style dining and the 2 most popular entrees among the group last year aren't even on the list, so that's an immediate downer. It's then $35 a person, before tax/gratuity/planner fee (wait....what?). The best alternative suggestion was to seat us as 2 separate groups of 8...what freakin' difference does it make? Just let us make a normal reservation for 16. :) Hub51 has a great overall reputation for their food so this was going to become my go-to spot for my birthdays/celebrations, etc. but knowing I'm not at all enticed to bring a significant group because of these limitations is a real bummer, enough to go from 5 stars to 2 for the taste left in my mouth.  :-/ 8/8/14 This very quickly became my favorite restaurant in all of River North...so much so that I'll be having my birthday dinner there end of this month with about 20 friends!  They have a nice atmosphere...trendy and sophisticated but not uptight or overly formal, the menu is unique and eclectic without being overly unusual, and from my initial experience the service was great.   It's a bit costly for some of the plates, but absolutely worth it.  I had an open-faced BLT and it absolutely blew me away.  I have no idea what kind of special sauce they put on there, but it was a party in my mouth and I was sad to see it go.  I'm looking forward to going back and taking friends along!!",0.9931,0.775,0.179,0.046,0.5802123552123553

All the food was fantastic. Tuna poke was great, my fish tacos were amazing and large portions. I loved how it was served as ""build your own"" similar to a fajita style.

We stood there for 3 min waiting and still nothing so we decided to take a seat at the cocktail table in hopes to get someone to acknowledge us. That was a mistake. The server came by with an attitude and grabbed the silverware and said I will be back with water and menus. No greet nothing. He was rude. Then he came back and poured our water and dropped the menus off. That's the last time we saw of him. Granted he was busy trying to close out multiple checks and I understand that situation. But 10min later when he finally was done and we were still patiently waiting but now a bit furious. He literally grabbed the books off the table that just left. Looked at me and kept walking.

The service is  sturdy and reliable. They're very dog friendly too.  I  am particularly smitten with the light lemon pancake.  I don't know why they don't call it a crepe, since that is indeed what it is. A tip: it comes with a type of condiment, maybe with a mascarpone cheese base.  It is good, but not necessary.  The best way to eat it is to simply squeeze the lemon over the crepe which is already sprinkled with powdered sugar.  It's marvelous. Their eggs benedict is very nice, and I'm a stickler for eggs benedict. The hollandaise is fresh.  I would also recommend the Greek omelette.  Nothing fancy, but just a sturdy omelette.  It is served with hash browns.  They are known for their breakfast nachos.  Frankly, they look better than they taste.  They use a very nice chip, but frankly, I'm just not all that impressed.   They have a very nice menu overall, something for everyone and all the food is typical of a Lettuce Entertain You restaurant, reliable, tasty, quality ingredients, sturdy, but not over the top.  But that's ok.  The price point is perfect.",0.9895,0.776,0.186,0.038,0.6068027210884354

2015-06-22,2.0,"Eh, I'm totally over Hub 51. But that's what happens when they change the menu and take off almost every single thing I regularly order from here. See my previous reviews where I gush about the egg salad? That's off the menu. The Sonoma salad that I raved about? That's gone too. The toasted cheese with sage sandwich I couldn't get enough of? By now you see where this is headed--it's adios to all my favorites. Imagine my shock when I came in recently to discover all this bad news. I talked to one of the managers about the changes and he said that in an effort to please their customers, they've combined the lunch and dinner menus. Please their customers? Yeah, well, it pretty much had the opposite effect on me. They told me that the Sonoma salad is now the Kale and Avocado salad, and oh, it's just as good! Lies, all lies. I think we can all stop pretending that kale tastes good, because it doesn't. I was also totally flabbergasted that the chunks of avocado that used to be in the salad was now an unappetizing ""smear"" of avocado across the bowl that looked like baby food. What the eff was I supposed to do with that? Mix it all up in my salad? No thanks. I honestly tried to give it another shot before completely calling it quits and ordered the prime rib sandwich (this used to previously only be on the dinner menu). At $19.95, I had hopes this would good. Wrong again! It was average at best. You want the best prime rib sandwich of your life? Then head a few blocks over to Eataly where it's at least 4x as good, twice as large, and costs $5 less. Oh, but there's good news! They didn't change their dessert menu. Oh wait, I said good.  It's still the same tired desserts they've had since they opened. They still suck by the way. I liked their chocolate pudding pie and butterscotch pots du creme the first hundred times I had them, but your desserts could sure use a face lift. On the other hand, I guess it doesn't matter if you change your dessert menu, because I'm not likely to come back for dessert if there's nothing else I want to eat.

The dinner portions are fairly generous, and we found the brunch portions to be on the smaller side compared to other places in the area--though this just means that the portions were more along the lines of what an average person should consume in one setting, which is good. Also, if you plan a party here for a certain number of people, you do a set menu where everyone pays a flat rate--however, the menu choices are refillable, so it ends up being a ton of food and a really good value for what you're getting. If you haven't tried Hub, you have to. Another awesome Lettuce Entertain you creation.",0.9904,0.792,0.208,0.0,0.5003401360544217
2015-04-07,4.0,"I was on a short weekend getaway in the city and found myself with my boyfriend in Hub 51 after the place next door to our hotel was way too crowded. Unlike Public House on State Street, Hub 51 had lots of available tables for an early Friday night dinner. This wasn't indicative of a bad restaurant though: our waitress was extremely friendly and gladly explained the menu when I had questions about dairy content. I got the brussels sprouts salad, which gets a big thumbs up for having medjool dates. But I *think* the salad also had craisins (not mentioned on the menu!), which I try to avoid because they have added sugar. So the brussels sprouts salad was a tad diluted in that regard. The boyfriend got a burger, and he loved it. The restaurant filled up nicely as we ate our meals, which made the open layout of the place feel more alive and vibrant. Out of nowhere after our plates were taken away, a woman who appeared to be a manager came to our table and gave us a huge complimentary slice of carrot cake because we had mentioned to the waitress that it was our first time there! It was superb: moist and not overly sweet like most carrot cakes I've had. It satisfied the sweet tooth I had after my salad dinner. We were completely caught off guard by such a generous treat in a big city restaurant owned by a national company. Yay!",0.9886,0.799,0.166,0.034,0.5296296296296297

We were seated promptly when our group arrived, and our server was friendly, happy to provide recommendations, and appeared at all the appropriate times. The place was pretty packed for 6:30. Menu ranges all over the place, from sushi to burgers to tacos.  I had a glass of the Hub Punch, with pomegranate juice and tequila ($10) and found it tangy, not overwhelmingly tasting of alcohol, and to give just the right buzz. For dinner someone else in the group and I had the pork shoulder with potatoes - fork tender, flavorful, and hot. We both found it delicious, along with my significant other who stole a few bites. That evening's special was a seared Ahi tuna with some coconut curry rice, which two of our group tried, and I tasted off of my significant other's plate, another great meal. The perfectly seared outer layer complimented the silky soft still pink middle; we all loved it and cleared both plates.  The location is easy to find downtown and accessible via public transit. It's a little bit pricey as expected in the area, but was also of a quality that would match.

I wish I felt like I could give it 5 stars, but service was too disappointing. Are servers supposed to taste wines with their table? Ours did, as we watched and waited 20 minutes. Went for our anniversary. Made a reso on open table and made a special note of it. Got there and people with later reservations appeared to be seated before us. I'm patient and didn't mind, but I was certainly surprised. Once we were sat we ordered drinks and whatnot. They no longer had the beer I was itching for (if anyone knows where to buy Oskar blues station 3 please share!!). That's irrelevant. The server found us something equally great! The ahi tuna poke, AMAZING, as always - get it every time. Chicken nachos were unimpressive. The nachos used to better a couple years ago. Cheeseburger, fries, always very good too. Definitely all praise there! We ordered dessert, waited 20-30 minutes for boxes and same waiting time, if not more, for dessert. We asked for the butterscotch. YUM! Needless to say my partner (a first timer) was getting impatient and crabby. So I asked for the check. They processed my rewards card wrong and charged my credit card. Maybe the waiter was new?? Either way it was sloppy. He gave us our $4 dessert on the house. Gee, thanks. Probably should have asked for a manager... Because waiting as long as we did for a pudding cup is lousy.

For dinner, I had the steak tacos which come deconstructed for you to pile on what you want (my favorite way to eat tacos).

I was waiting for my guest at the table and my waitress barely came over and seemed bothered that she had to finish her shift. I was also incredibly annoyed when the lazy blonde hostess didn't even bother walking my aunt to the table I was waiting at! She just pointed in my direction vaguely and my aunt had to basically look for me! Pathetic. Plus that dumb blonde made it seem like it was impossibly hard to put me in the Open Table system as a walk-in with my name attached to the table. Is she new, or just an idiot? I used to work as a hostess and let me tell you somthing: That job isn't very hard. A monkey could do it. I learned how to manuever Open Table in 45 minutes, and my technical skills aren't even that good!  There is no excuse to not do you're job correctly. The main job is to seat and greet guests. If you don't like your job then try getting a real one. I'm sure there's some chimpanzees waiting in the corner to take your place as head hostess! The food is pretty good. The dessert is much better though. I found the price to be just right , especially since we barely tipped our horrendous, awful waitress (I do not apologize for this since the waiting staff know they have to work for the tips. Bad service=bad tip. Learn your job and have a better attitude then.) I've been to Hub 51 twice with my aunt, with the first time being this summer and getting good service from both our waitress and the hosting staff, so I hope this was just a bad day.

The not so good: Chicken enchilada - Though big, everything on the plate was just too mushy and too one dimensional.  The okay: Chocolate pudding pie. This one solely depends on palate.

I was, however, pleasantly surprised by the food at Hub 51. Granted, the ambiance and design of the restaurant is not to my taste. It reminded me of a BJ's on steroids. Loud, dark, garish, and crowded. Our waitress was thankfully on top of things and quite helpful despite the crowd.  They have a decent selection of wine and beer although the cocktail menu is limited to sweeter ""chick"" drinks. They were able to make me a margarita on the rocks with fresh lime, tequila, and agave- no sweet and sour, Texas style. My friends and I split the hummus plate and I got the brussels sprouts salad. The hummus comes with a generous portion of toasted pita, crudites, a few olives, and crushed almonds. The crushed nuts mirrored the hummus in portion size, so we had lots of those left over and they don't serve as a good dip, obviously. I enjoyed the salad, which was blanched brussels sprouts leaves in place of lettuce. Unlike many salads, the leaves were left whole versus being shredded.

The room itself had a nice modern dark feel that could easily be transformed into a club. The drinks were quite strong and well made. I couldn't even get to a second long island ice tea without feeling tipsy. We ended having a shared family style dinner for our event: 1. California roll- well made, fresh. The wasabi has a kick 2. Homemade hummus with dukka and pita- simply delicious with the fluffy pita bread. I did not journey to the wild side to try the dukka spices though. Maybe next time 3. Filet mignon tacos- amazing, I wish they would go back on the sauce because it takes away from the meat flavor. But very tender served in a skillet along with rice, beans, tacos, and gauc. If you have to get one item this would be the one to get! 4. Grilled salmon- top notch I could not get enough, fresh and flaky 5. Herb roasted chicken- Good moist, and well flavored Overall a good dinner experience with attentive wait staff 6. Carrot cake and brownie al la mode simply delicious Pro: large selection of items, club 51 one some nights for those who want to party down Cons: Can be expensive with apps, main entree, dessert, drinks Hidden gem: Sushi 1/2 off 3-6 and 11pm to close.

2014-08-14,2.0,"After hearing good things about Hub 51, and based on my gf's recommendation, I decided to take my Mom when she came to visit.  Now I had made a reservation through Open Table for 7pm. After walking in at 7:05 (yup we were 5 minutes late), we were told it would take 5-10 minutes to be seated. No big deal, so we sat down to wait. and wait. and wait. We waited as other people were seated before us (maybe they had a reservation for 7 as well??) And we waited as people walked in with no reservation and were seated before us (my internal optimist has nothing in their defense here). After 20 minutes, my gf, sensing my aggravation went to speak to the hostess and was told it would be 10-15 more minutes, that they were clearing tables as fast as they could. After a couple minutes of my very proper mother throwing them the stink eye they realized their error and sat us. Overall we were seated at 7:30 for a 7:00 reservation- as people who didn't have a reservation were seated before me I'm not sure what the point of the reservation was- except I do get the 100 points from Open Table.  We were seated at a table in the bar area and no surprise it felt like I was in a bar. It was very loud and hard to hear those you were sitting with, not to mention the just OK service. We ordered the nachos and cornbread as appetizers. While the nachos were good, it's huge- way to big for 3 people and probably good for a table of 6+ (unless you're only eating appetizers). The cornbread was great.  For our main meals we got the Steak Tacos, Open faced BLT, and the Salmon. (Sidenote: We had to ask to order our meal after the appetizers) I was told the Open Faced BLT was fantastic. The Steak Taco's, while my mom enjoyed them, had their own problems. The steak was ordered medium rare and it was pretty rare. Now my mom doesn't care if her meat is still mooing so she didn't mind, but the rest of us wouldn't even sample her meal. Now my meal on the other hand was not liked by anyone. It was quite possibly the blandest salmon I've ever had, although the asparagus was quite good.

2014-08-13,4.0,"I came here with a friend after work, so we decided to get an appetizer in addition to a dish each. Pulled Chicken Nachos This thing is enormous! I was full after eating this, and this was after splitting it with my friend and not actually finishing the whole thing. Love the raw jalapenos that they add on top. Honestly though, they could cut the portion down in half and cut the price in half too. $16 for an appetizer that large.. people don't usually go to restaurants to fill up on appetizers. By the time we got halfway through, the nachos near the bottom were soggy too. It was great in the beginning, but I probably won't order this again the next time I go. Filet Mignon Steak Tacos The dish comes with the steak, several small corn tortillas, guac, tomato salsa, rice, and beans. Very good, we got the steak cooked medium and it was juicy and tender, perfect for the tacos. The guac isn't the best I've ever had but then again I didn't expect it to be, Hub 51 isn't a restaurant specializing in Mexican food. Braised Beef Short Ribs Probably the best dish of the night. So tender, the knife cuts right through the meat. And when you chew it, you'll see how tender it really is. The sauce is really good too, enticing me to finish all of the carrots and potatoes that come along with the beef. Overall, it is a bit on the more expensive side, at least more than I usually spend for meals, but it's expected with restaurants in downtown Chicago.

Yes, you can probably buy the can of champagne for much less, and the restaurant is charging you a premium, but hey, I don't see what difference does it make that it comes in a can versus a glass? We ordered the hummus appetizer and the salmon, wow the salmon was actually really good. The salmon is raw and is diced up to look like tomato, paired with spices and avocado and served on rice crackers, it was VERY GOOD.  I ordered the sea bass, $24, yes kinda expensive but it is arguably the best sea bass I've EVER HAD. It is pair ed with salty broth, oats and Asian pea sprout. The sea bass fillet was perfectly cooked, it is crispy on the surface, the pariring is done very well with the broth and oats and sprout. If it wasn't so expensive I would come back more often ha.

The food is decent, and I will say they give you a lot of it. The plate of Chicken Nachos that came to the table was almost the size of the table itself.  My brother ordered the sushi, which was just so-so, but I wouldn't expect mind-blowing sushi at ""an eclectic American restaurant"" in River North. My burger was good and came with a side salad that had some yummy freshly shaved parmesan on top. The saving grace was the Big Brownie dessert. It resembled a flourless chocolate cake, with an ooey-gooey texture and crisp top. The vanilla ice cream was melting all over and made this dessert quite captivating. Our server was amazingly personable and attentive, engaging us in conversation without being nosy.

2014-06-22,3.0,"3.5 *s, just shy of 4. HUB51 gets its higher marks for locale and setting - the food is on the cusp of A-OK and good, IMO - particularly lively people watching and well trafficked on a Wednesday night; our little enclave of Californian & New York colleagues were yearning for a proper night out in Chicago AND some much recreation after three long, grueling days in corporate training. The modern and chic interior at ground level is split 30/70(?) between a lounge-y bar area and tabled dining area, both pretty busy this particular night with the after work young professionals crowd while a parade of youthful pretty people traversed the sidewalk just outside getting an early start on nightlife festivities. A brief aside to the restroom located downstairs revealed a sub level (""SUB51"") that has a definitively nightclub/afterhours aesthetic, something to keep in mind the next time I find myself in Chicago. Our group of 7 were seated in the dining area almost immediately (I can only surmise we had a reservation?) and were greeted and tended to by a friendly, beauteous, midwest archetype, statue of a woman (I'm a sucker for light eyes and bright smiles). Service remained top notch for the duration of the night, our server quick and attentive to our experience. A round of drinks - the usual spectrum of beers, cocktails, and shots (we had a rough week, remember?) - soon arrived at the table, accompanied by a pitcher of the Hub Punch... I've gotta tell you: the punch is sweet and bright and tastily, deceptively sangria-like, but it packs a boozy wallop. Good if you're looking to be bad, bad if you're looking to be good. (drink menu:  hub51chicago.com/wp-cont… ) Just get it. Totally just get it. Hangover City, but worth it. Food here is ""not bad"" to ""decently good"", erring on the side of generous portions and garish presentations. Three appetizers (a mountainous plate of nachos, a healthy round of ahi poke, and a generous skillet of cornbread - all just okay) and a few drinks between 7 people sated a few of us before dinners had even arrived. That said, like the appetizers, entrees were stacked monuments with generous sides (starches and veggies abundant like they're going out of fashion!). It's almost as though the goal of the kitchen is to occupy as much real estate as possible on the fashionably over-sized flatware. That's not a complaint, the premium pricepoint justifies the *amount* of food though I would rather have a modest serving of *better* food for my dollars. But like I said, the scenery, inside and on the sidewalks nearby, is vibrant and attractive with young (and young-in-spirit) working adults, making up for the unimpressive food offerings. Bookmarking for a return visit, most assuredly. _______________________________________________ Chicago can work on their craftbeer game a bit, but their Amazonian, adorable, affable waitstaff game is on point.

I dont love bar like tables but hey I didn't care. They were very loose. Thought was gonna fall off. They need to fix them. So we sat and noticed that the glasses and the napkins were dirty we had to send them back. Happens I get it, but it didnt stop here. We ordered the ceviche and the guac. The guacamole was to die for but the ceviche wasnt. Was just so bland and boring, I might as well ate card board. Maybe it is my fault. My expectations are high. My friend Maria makes this amazing ceviche that is to die for, puts hub 51 to shame. The chips were bad too. They were greasy and paper thin, impossible to dip them. Where is the fun in eating dips when the chips slow down your process and you have to pick up a fork? For dinner we ordered braised pork shoulder with apricots which was great. The meat was so tender, just perfect. My friends had the enchiladas and the asian salad (the last one was boring) and I had the sonoma salad. The waiter asked me if I wanted to add protein and I said steak. The steak was good but it was wierd. I had a bitterssweet relationship with it. It had a very distinct almost too strong of a sauce that made me not eat more than 3 bites but was cooked to perfection.

Our waitress was very friendly and attentive and told us that the menu is kind of all over the place, ranging from sushi, to burgers, to tacos, which is fine because I love variety. First we started with some drinks and I had the Hub Punch while my boyfriend had an Old Fashioned. A coworker had recommended the Hub Punch and boy was it delicious! Very fruity and refreshing and just strong enough. The Old Fashioned, however, was really gross and syrupy, but I've learned that that's just how Old Fashioneds taste so that's no fault of Hub's. My bf then proceeded to get whiskey on the rocks to cleanse his mouth of that taste.  As an appetizer, we shared the spicy shrimp & king crab roll, which was really tasty. Although, just a heads up, it was probably the most Americanized sushi that I've ever had since it came with a plate of spicy mayo for dipping. As entrees, we got the arugula Caesar salad and the fish tacos. The salad was whatever, but I really enjoyed the tacos. They come on a build-your-own plate with cabbage slaw, rice, and black beans. The fish was actually a little dry, but the taste was there so I didn't really mind since I slathered on the guac and pico.  The star of the show was the HUGE slice of carrot cake that they give you fo' free if it's your first visit. They didn't acknowledge that it was my birthday even though I noted that in the comments when I made the reservation through OpenTable, but I didn't really need all the singing as long as I got free cake! The cake was super moist and decadent and the cream cheese icing was divine. I normally don't like frosting very much, but I could've eaten that frosting by the spoonful. I'm always too full after a meal to get dessert, but I will definitely be ordering that the next time I dine here. All things considering, it was a very solid dinner and I will be back to Hub at some point, especially since it's a LEYE restaurant and I'm a sucker for points.

2014-04-23,4.0,"A lot of people don't think of Hub 51 for brunch, but it's a great place to go for brunch on either a Saturday or a Sunday. The vibe is trendy, it's a place to see and be seen with all of the ""beautiful people"", and the food is really solid. I like to get their omelets, and they have great breakfast cocktails - a couple of them incorporate St. Germain, which is one of my favorites. The only thing that I will say is that the breakfast items are a la carte - so if you order an omelette, you are getting an omelette. There will be no potatoes or fruit on the side - that's all separate.  The brunch scene is more crowded on Sundays vs. Saturdays, so Saturdays are good days to go. Another good thing is that they do accept reservations, and they are on Opentable, so if you are on a schedule and you're not in the mood to be on a 45 minute to 1-hour waiting list for brunch, this is a great option.  I've also been for lunch during work hours, and they have such a great variety of items on the menu that everyone will find something they like. I really enjoyed their fish tacos, and their cornbread is also surprisingly really good. I tasted the cornbread and was not expecting it to be so fabulous - so that was a bonus in my book! One thing to note is that there is a semi-private area in the main dining room (in the back) where people can have parties. I saw a bridal shower going on in the room, and it's a nice venue for this kind of occasion. Good to know!",0.9983,0.73,0.262,0.008,0.6666666666666666

Were anxious to return to share the experience with other family members and it wasn't that good the second time around. Nachos appetizer was great again! We ordered five entrees and one was 7 minutes behind the other ones. It was awkward waiting for the one person not eating with us! Tacos were okay but we had to remind the server again, that yes, you do have Mexican cheese we can order on the side to go with those tacos! Ordered desserts and my key lime pie was frozen in the center. When I told this to our server she said it was supposed to be served ""chilled"" and I replied that I knew what chilled was versus frozen. Then a different  person brought back the new key lime pie slice and mentioned again it was supposed to be served ""chilled."" I am intelligent and have been eating key lime pie for many years - this was FROZEN in the center. Then we ordered the brownie desserts but my son was taking the brownie home and just asked to eat the ice cream that comes with the brownie (and is stated as such in the MENU). When we noticed hte bill, we were overcharged for a vanilla ice cream dessert and then the server told us it didn't come with the brownie (It's written in the menu)....... So overall it was an ""off"" visit and I hope we can visit again with more clarity on the part of the staff: defrost the key lime pie, alert the servers you can have Mexican cheese on the side with tacos, and learn the menu a bit more so we don't have to be charged for ice cream that came with a dessert. (Obviously you can't take ice cream home ""to go"" that comes with the brownie dessert).One other thing, can we get some better lighting in the bathrooms?

They have a little kick to them.  3) Any of the sushi rolls - I honestly think they are better than some real sushi spots in Chicago (i.e. Union).  Come here from 3-6pm when they are half off.  Service is usually great.  They comped our entire bill one time after I found a walnut in my salad (i had told them I was allergic).  I didn't even complain, but they told us they take allergies seriously.  They gave us free dessert too (get the carrot cake!).  Service like that is what keeps me coming back!",0.964,0.849,0.139,0.011,0.47054195804195803
2014-04-03,3.0,"I think the overall yelp review of 3.5 stars is appropriate for this restaurant. The food is moderate to good, and the service could be better. My friend and I met a Wednesday after work when it was not too crowded, and we got seated right away. The atmosphere is cool with tall ceilings and wood furniture and dark wood walls. The menu features a lot of sandwiches and a few fish platters; it seems more suited for lunch. I got the spicy burger and we also got the ribs and cornbread. The burger was not very spicy, and it was juicy in a bad way. The sauerkraut or whatever topping they had on it made the bun wet and soggy. The burger itself however, was cooked just fine. Not a lot of flavor for their touted ""best burger""; I tasted no spicy mayo or chipotle flavor.  The dry rub ribs was the best item I had. They has a really interesting flavor and the peanut/fennel seed topping complimented the ribs very well.  Another good thing: we got a free desert! Yes free!!! It was our first time there so that was very complimentary. Usually only five star restaurants do that kind of thing. The carrot cake was very good with a delicious thick cream cheese icing, and I would recommend it. The service was the biggest downside to this place. EXTREMELY SLOW. Like I think a snail race would be faster. It took about 10 minutes to get their attention for our check. My friend said, ""get your credit card out and ready!"" Which was genius because it probably would have taken him another 10-15 mins to check back up on us. I would return here for lunch maybe, or just to get appetizers.

But that is just what you get here, a mediocre marginal experience every time. My servers are usually nice here, but can be ultra slow. My most recent visit was yesterday for bunch and our server was pretty good for once. He was nice and friendly and prompt. However, there are issues that happen every visit here. Food issues. If you ask for food to come out without one of the ingredients, don't plan on that happening. Portions are inconsistent. One order will be huge and the next is super small, I don't see them pricing them accordingly... Once I ordered sushi and it took them 45 min to get it to me. Then I had to ask for water refills several times because they didn't leave the usual bottle of water on the table that they have in other visits. I have had food come out every visit that I considered turning back to the kitchen. Yesterday my wife asked for an omelet with no tomatoes. It came out with tomatoes. I am positive the server ordered it correctly, the kitchen got it wrong. Although, he did deliver it to the table with tomatoes all over it. Also, that omelet was supposed to have spinach... Well, it had about three leaves of baby spinach on it, long stem and all. Not what I consider an omelet. It's pretty much just scrambled eggs at that point. It was a big omelet in their defense. However I ordered corned beef with poached eggs. Very good but super small portion. I dine at lettuce entertain you restaurants often and I have to say this one needs more attention for it to gain more business from me.

Joy C. and I split a salmon roll which they had roasted the top of, delicious and a Brussel Sprouts salad, also awesome.

2014-01-27,5.0,"I think this is my favorite Lettuce Entertain you restaurant, which is actually pretty impressive because I've had a Big Bowl obsession for years. But everytime I come here (and it's been probably 10 times), I am never disappointed. Never. The food is always good, the drinks even better, and the service always professional. Now let's get to the favorites. When they say on the menu that they carry a ""Really Good Ahi Tuna Burger"", they mean it's really good. Like, best ahi tuna burger I've ever had good and always consistently that good, good (and I just came back from Hawaii). I order that every time because it's amazing. That, and the HUB PUNCH. If you have yet to try the punch, get a glass, or better yet, get a pitcher because it's a good deal if you have a party drinking and it will undoubtedly be finished. It can be strong too, will sneak up on you if you're not careful ;) I've been here for bachelorette parties, birthdays, brunches, dinners, and even just meet ups for drinks. They are so on top of their game every time. But here is one of the most notable experiences: We came for a birthday on a Friday night, we were a party of 8. They sat us at a bar height table and said we may have to move by a certain time because another reservation was coming. We were annoyed at first but had two hours and kind of understood - this place is always busy. But about an hour in, they found an open table for us that we could stay as long as we wanted at so they offered to move us there. We said sure, and they carried all our drinks and food for us. We were happy and didn't think anything of it. Come bill time....they felt so bad for the inconvenience that they literally comped our ENTIRE meal! All 8 of us...who ordered lots of stuff, and offered us 2-3 free desserts in addition! Our mouths all dropped to the floor. We couldn't believe it. All the times I thought the place was pricy (which it can be though worth it) were validated....Hub51, I love you even more.",0.9911,0.794,0.168,0.039,0.5930035903250189

We ordered pitchers of drinks, which came out to be ridiculously expensive, especially for how watered down they tasted. I ordered fish tacos that were on the special that night (fried, not grilled), and they were just ordinary.  Definitely not worth the $19 or $20 I paid for them.  The portions were very small for the price.

2014-01-06,4.0,Definitely a nice option if you're in the area - fresh food prepared well with typically good flavors.  The wine list is fairly nice and drinks are okay but unspectacular yet you come here for the food and the upscale yet casual feeling atmosphere created by Lettuce Entertain You.  Pulled chicken nachos are difficult to eat because the nachos get very soggy but the ingredients and flavors are great and if you're having drinks at the bar or watching a game they're a great choice.  Grilled fish tacos are an outstanding choice with freshly made tortillas and a perfectly cooked fish fillet that allow you to make your own tacos.  The main disappointment I've had so far is sushi - the rainbow roll just didn't cut it with oddly textured rice and not great flavor.  Serves me right but fresh fish and sushi actually appear to be a hallmark of Hub 51 so I was quite disappointed at how bad the sushi was. I'm gonna say 3.5 stars and I'll round up to 4 based on a nice atmosphere with good food including excellent fresh seafood options.  Definitely a solid place.,0.9952,0.609,0.32,0.071,0.6524181547619049

However, I don't believe in ransoming a business for a good review nor receiving compensation. What is the point of the review if it is totally biased? The first time was with friends in the dining room who we had raved about the salads to... fortunately we didn't look like jerks as the salads were perfect and our server was awesome. The second time was back in our fav the bar. Again the salad was back to it's former quality. Kudo's to the management for responding and fixing the issue. 3 stars is because no matter how early we show up the bar is filled with reserved signs and every visit when we inquire at the hostess stand we get a different reason. Which is kinda rude. Especially since we have tried to reserve a tall top & have been told that Hub 51 does not take reservations for them.  Just say you are waiting for the after 8 / 9pm crowd. We are fine with that as when it starts to get a little ""meat markety"" we are out anyhow. Then there is the whole ""let me ask a manager dance"". The manager is always gracious, but maybe could tel the hostesses to let folks know that the tall tops are open from x time to x time. Many other restaurants are happy to squeeze folks in with the caveat that the table needs to be vacated by a certain time for a reservation.  Again, no worries - we can work with that.

The hummus was average and the nacho toppings were very good, but a more substantial chip is needed (got very soggy). The Sonoma salad was a bit overdressed, but a good basic green salad. The entrees were hit or miss, with mostly miss. We got veggie and short rib tacos with toppings. The beef was in very large chunks so hard to eat in a taco, would be much better shredded and was also rather bland and dry. We also got a plate of grilled salmon that was frankly an insult to the fish  they came from--over-cooked and extremely bland.  Dessert was more of a high point--a massive brownie a la mode and huge chunk of carrot cake. The brownie had a delicious gooey, melty chocolate center with nice brownie crust surrounding it. The carrot cake was missing texture (no discernible nuts, raisins, carrot pieces) but had nice flavor.

2013-09-06,3.0,"I was a bit skeptical of a restaurant that features Mexican food and sushi, but since I like Mexican and not sushi, this place is a good compromise destination for me. It was super easy to get a reservation (via OpenTable), and when we were about 10 minutes early, the hostess was really nice and seated us immediately. Our waitress was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. We ordered beers first (good prices on draft beers for River North- $5/$6, depending on what you get). While walking in, I was struck by how many parties seated outside had nachos on their tables- it was at least 75% of the tables! Being the nacho lover that I am, I ordered them, too, and was pleased. The plate is enormous! The chips are a bit thin for the toppings, but the toppings are judiciously applied and spread out amongst the layers, so it's not too difficult to eat. There was a satisfying amount of guac, which I'm always happy to see, but the jalapenos were fresh, not pickled (my preference). I'd order these again. My bf ordered the enchilada stack and was pretty disappointed. He was expecting traditional enchiladas, but with the ingredients stacked instead of rolled. Instead, he got a stack that contained the following: a thick layer of plain white rice (we conjecture it's the sushi rice, before they put vinegar in it!), shredded chicken, a corn tortilla, a thick smear of guacamole, another corn tortilla, and broiled jack cheese, surrounded by green salsa. He's not a guac fan, and since enchiladas don't typically come with it inside, it didn't even occur to him to ask for it on the side. I tried them and wasn't thrilled either- who wants to eat hot, mashed avocado? The standout of the night was dessert, and I don't even care for sweets. Give me cheez-its over cake any day. We ordered the ice cream bar of the day, and the flavor that day was chocolate ice cream, covered in a hard chocolate and hazelnut coating. The plate came with a generous amount of homemade whipped cream. I would go back just for this ice cream bar!

2013-07-26,4.0,"I had several concerns regarding Hub 51 before visiting.  One being a LEY restaurant and the other being that the menu is all over the place.  But a friend recommended it and said the tuna poke was excellent. So we decided to give it a try and I really enjoyed it. The place looks like the a lot of other Chicago restaurants inside.  It's big with ""decorative industrial"" look.  Girl & Goat and Baume & Brix have also put their spin on this style.  Service was excellent.  Our server, Meagan C, was a bit ""standoffish"" at first but by the end of the meal she was super friendly and interacting with us.  She won major points when my partner noticed his 2nd martini was watered down. She apologized and quickly got a much improved replacement without question. Great job! We started off with the Spicy Tuna Roll, Hamachi roll and Tuna Poke. The spicy tuna was so-so. Seemed a bit mushy and the tobanjan sauce didn't really to work.  The Hamachi was the standout! Loved it and especially loved the inclusion of the pepper on top. Delightfully spicy! The tuna poke was good but I was not a fan of the Asian rice crackers.  They tasted like Styrofoam. House made won ton chips would've worked better. For the entrees I choose the short ribs and my partner went with the pork shoulder. I loved my short rib. It had a pot roast quality to it. My partner loved his pork shoulder. The apricot mustard was very tasty. We saved room for dessert but nothing can prepare you for the size of Hub 51's desserts.  While good, they are just too freakin' big. They could reduce them by at least 1/4 and still charge the same price. I opted for the daily ice cream bar. It was good but it's best to wait a few minutes before eating it after it's served to you. It's a bit crystallized at first so letting it get a little soft makes for a more enjoyable dessert. Partner went with the carrot cake. It is served with extra whipped cream AND extra frosting.  Why you need extra frosting for a slice of cake that is the size of a small child, I have no idea. But he loved it and really made a effort to finish it but just couldn't. We both were impressed with Hub 51. The menu made sense after dining.  They are located in a rather touristy area so they have to cover all the bases.  And they do a great job of doing that!",0.9989,0.745,0.236,0.019,0.44694444444444464
2013-07-25,5.0,"I love Hub 51 - it's one of my favorite places to go for lunch, brunch, or dinner and is always one of the restaurants I bring out-of-town guests to.  This is the one place my out-of-town guests continue to talk about weeks and months after dining at and wish they had in their hometowns!   I love Hub 51 because the food and service is always consistent.  I can go there confident that I will have a great dining experience.  I've never had a bad experience here, instead always having a pleasant and enjoyable experience.   Three of my favorite items to order are the pulled chicken nachos, the brussel sprouts salad, and the chicken enchilada stack.  All of these dishes are exploding with flavor and are made with quality ingredients.  The portions are also generous - I actually order the nachos as my entree and always have enough to share with others at my table.  Their desserts are also tasty, especially if you have a sweet tooth!  My favorite is the chocolate pudding pie (pay the extra to get it topped with marshmallows).  Their drinks are also great -- I love their hub punch.  My suggestion is to get the pitcher and share it, you get more bang for your buck. The ambiance is trendy, but not stuffy or uncomfortable.  You'll want to talk a little louder though since it can be kind of noisy!   If going during lunch time (between 11am-2pm), I suggest making reservations as you'll be waiting awhile.  You'll also want to make reservations if going there 6:30pm or after.  It seems like any time between 2pm and 5:30pm is their ""down time"" and you should be able to get a table right away.

The overall experience was a decent place to bring a group with varying tastes (american, mexican, japanese, vegetarian). Service was standard to good.  Appetizers: -Green Trio & Nachos. The nachos were very large and the group seemed to love them. They cleaned the plate. The green trio on the other hand was uneventful. The edamame had the salt underneath, no dipping sauce with the tempura, and a few straggler green beans that missed the tempura and fryer. Definitely don't recommend the green trio. Salads: -Sonoma salad and brussels sprouts salad. The sonoma salad was pretty good but nothing amazing. The brussels sprouts salad I wouldn't recommend ordering. The mustard vinaigrette was undetectable, the salad was small compared to the other salads, and overall was underwelming.  Entrees: -Veggie burger, enchilada stack, and the salmon. I didn't try the stack or salmon but my guests enjoyed them. Though a note don't order the nachos and enchiladas as they are very similar. The veggie burger was tasty.  Desserts: -Lemon meringue pie and raspberry sorbet. Both pretty good. The meringue pie is enormous though. Heads up.

BIG MISTAKE! Ahaha. I finished half of it; it was that good. The chicken was moist, tender, and very tasty. I love the marriage between the crispiness of the nachos,  the spiciness and freshness of the salsa and the Jalapeño peppers without overpowering, and  the creaminess and richness of the guacamole and sour cream; all without being too heavy with the cheese. We ordered two (one for myself as entree). At the end, we decided to combine the leftover tacos; it looks like one whole dish. I brought it home and my family loves it, especially my sister. Yes, I had some before my sister finished it. Just too good. We also ordered the iced Hub tea; it tastes like a refreshing Spring tea with a slight kick at the end. Most of my friends ordered burgers with fries or sweet potato fries. All was pleased with the food. I would highly recommend it for first timers to try this place out.

2013-05-17,4.0,"Just got back to my hotel room after an excellent dinner at Hub 51.  We came to Chicago on a business trip and it was recommended to my colleague and I by a business associate who called in a favor to book us a table last minute. The place was insanely busy -- booked to the rafters on a Friday night with several large party groups upstairs and down. At most places, this would be a nightmare. But here, we got absolutely amazing service. Our waiter, I believe his name was Mitchell, was just incredible. Exactly the right attentiveness, he knew the menu, made great recommendations, and was there exactly when we needed him (but not hovering).  Every thing from drinks -- including off the menu mixed drinks -- to appetisers to entree and dessert were perfectly timed with no absurd wait time. The food was delicious. There was no point where we felt rushed or like we were waiting and trying to flag down our waiter. The service would have been impressive on a quiet weekday -- on a bustling Friday night, it's absolutely outstanding.  Drinks were fully loaded. Their punch is outstanding! And let's not even go into the carrot cake. That, alone, is worth the trip. Seriously. Amazing. And I'm picky about my dessert -- especially carrot cake. There's a little something for everyone on the menu, and it's extensive without being so huge that it's overwhelming. The only caution is that it's definitely not somewhere for people who may be hard of hearing -- the large room with high ceiling and concrete floors makes for loud ambiance and the music is pumped up pretty loud. Also know that this is a 21 and over establishment and they *do* card and turn away at the door.  Overall really excellent choice. Will definitely come back next time I'm in Chicago! Thanks for a wonderful experience.",0.9962,0.779,0.195,0.027,0.5681659765355418
2013-05-10,3.0,"I chose to eat at Hub 51 because it is a Lettuce Entertain You Restaurant and I did have to use some extra cash to use here.  Unfortunately, I left my card at home with my membership number on it and there is no way to easily retrieve that information online.  As a result I would end up paying the full price in the end.  Ah well I still have the extra bucks to use at a later date so it's really not a big deal. That aside, it should be noted that this was an establishment for ages 21 and up at the time that we went.  It definitely had more of a club type of atmosphere to it, keeping a youthful vibe by blasting hip hop.  For some strange reason, I've decided that I'm temporarily a vegan, so I wanted to hold up to that even though I was eating out.  The two cocktails that I ended up having were pretty good.  I was feeling adventurous as always so I went with the Chipotle Margarita.  I'm not immune to lots of spice so for me personally it could have been a tad bit spicier.  Also, I didn't notice this until after I ordered the drink but it is made with a chipotle vodka and not tequila.  The effect of this leaves you wanting a little bit more of the strong bitter notes that distilled agave provides to the palate.  Overall the drink is good, but it could have been slightly better, again as a disclaimer I like really bold flavors. The other drink that I had was a Cucumber Cuatro.  It tasted very much like a day at the spa.  The bit of ginger was used with a very light hand.  I will say the overall technique used by the bartenders seems to be to hide the flavor of the alcohol rather than accentuate it.  That's not necessarily a bad thing for most but it's not the particular flavor profile that I desire in a mixed drink.  I find that sort of thing akin to putting on jeans and a T-shirt to go to a wedding.  Yeah it keeps you comfortable but you are totally out of place. I had the Garden Roll.  It was very bright and light roll.  It was also my first foray into a vegetarian version of sushi.  The presentation was lovely and the rice in the roll was a perfect texture.  You get  the nice cool mild flavor of the cucumber along with the earthiness of the beets.  The hot appetizer we had was the Three Bean Trio.   I loved the tempura green beans.  They were nice and crisp and tasted very fresh.  The blistered padron peppers weren't exactly great yo me but they were still pretty decent.  Rounding out the trio was some edamame, or as I like to call it, a good way to charge you more money for soy beans. For my entree, I would have the vegetarian tacos.  It was one of those times I could have sworn that menu read peppers, portobello mushrooms and butternut squash.  Somehow my portobello  mushrooms were absent. I convinced myself that looking at the menu, I must have been mistaking it for some other dish on the menu and that there were no portobello mushrooms served with the tacos.  I mean after all there were black beans present.  Now in the comfort of my how reading the menu online I realized I was robbed of mushrooms.  The sad part is I think these somewhat bland tacos could have benefited from the addition of the earthy mushrooms.  I wondered why the meal only felt somewhat satisfying in the end. My friend ended up getting the the meatloaf sandwich.  It looked a little unwieldy to be a pick up and eat type of sandwich so she managed it fork and knife style.  I can't vouch for how it tasted personally but she said it was pretty  good.  It is something that I would personally never order though because of all the wonderful ground meat options there are in the world, I find turkey completely abysmal.  It's pretty strange because I do like turkey  in general, but as a rule I'm pretty much against it.  I personally think that Turkey is a one way ticket to bland town.  I did enjoy the french fries they served alongside her burger as I thought they were well seasoned and crisp. For dessert she would enjoy a few bites of a carrot cake that was honestly so big that it could have probably been shared by about three people.  It had a classic cream cheese icing and looked pretty well put together. As an added bonus it was comped since it was her birthday.  All and all I have to say that HUB51 is a pretty nice place and I would try it again, but it definitely isn't quite on the level of the many Chicago restaurants that I will go out of my way to search for.",0.9994,0.77,0.2,0.03,0.5510562015503876

Got the chicken Nachos --easily the best chicken nachos I've  ever had. The serving was also large so it was enough to hold over our large group as we waited for a table. The Guacamole & chips were GREAT. Usually restaurant Guac has too much lime or cilantro, but I loved how this was prepared. This tasted fresh and was served in a cool mortar. For an entree I got the rainbow sushi roll. Also fresh ingredients but nothing special. It was overpriced *BUT* since we got seated so late, by the time we ordered sushi prices were half off -so that was a sweet deal! most of my table ordered sushi & wine. One guy had chili, the other had tacos. I commented on how weird it was to order sushi & mexican food off the same menu, but hey --it was all good. But honestly, I came here to DRINK! Josh was my bartender of the night (ummm, CUTE!). I started off with the Cucumber Cuatro --cucumber vodka, lemonade and a perfect touch of ginger. It was crisp, cool & refreshing. Possibly my fave new drink. Next up was the Five Alive, kinda like a margarita --a little too sour for me but it was good. Lastly was the Biscayne Buck. (at this point i was drunk and pretty sure I called it the biz-KANYE, don't judge me!) it's Bacardi, Lime Juice and ginger beer. This was AMAZING! You need all five senses for this one, the ginger really hits you but it's welcomed! Josh was definitely awesome behind the bar. Also got to watch the final minutes of the bulls game, It's always great to have a tv in there so Chicago fans aren't missing out!

At dinner we were served family style.  The dishes were Sonoma Salad, Braised Beef Short Ribs, Grilled Vegetarian Burger, and the Chilean Sea Bass.  The salad to start was good.  The Grilled Vegetarian Burger was very good.  The Chilean Sea Bass was slightly overcooked, but still good.  Now, the Braised Beef Short Ribs were so freaking good!!!  I am not a red meat eater...I only endulge about twice a year.  I have been craving these things since I left last week!!!  When I got home I made my husBAND promise to take me there for dinner coming up...must have more!!!

I am ashamed to say the number of times I have been, but it is in the 25+ range over the years.  Here are some of my tips: -The nachos are amazing. You won't regret getting them. -The burgers are superb -Get the Hub Punch if you like sweet drinks (I often cut it with mineral water because it is a bit sweet for my liking) and the Cucumber Cuatro is always a safe bet -Don't be alarmed by the canned champagne - it isnt bad!

The inside is modern and chill, so it's good for a date or even a group - as we were surrounded by groups of 4 or more. As for the food and drinks (the most important part), there were some ups and downs.  Best - The Pulled Chicken Nachos! Probably the best nachos I've ever had. I gave up on trying to eat with my hands and grabbed a fork. The chicken is delicious, and I like that they didn't overdo it with the cheese. The only problem is that it's a loooot of food, especially for 2 people. We ended up getting so full off of this that we couldn't finish our dinner. So maybe just get this if you're just drinking. Good - The Fish Tacos. They had Mahi Mahi that night, which is my fave. Was cooked well and was yummy.  Decent - The ""Really Good Ahi Tuna Burger"" and all of the cocktails. The burger was very... mushy. I've definitely had better. At least the fries were great.  As for the cocktails, they're more juice-y than liquor-y. I tried the Chipotle Margarita and the Five Alive first. They were uncreative in presentation, we actually thought they had given us 2 of the same thing by accident. It was an ok margarita, and we could barely taste the grapefruit in the Five Alive. Next was the Hub Punch, which was also a bit disappointing, but good enough.

2013-04-01,3.0,I came out here on a Friday night with a reservation at 5:15 but didn't actually get seated at a table until 40 minutes later.  I'm guessing they were understaffed or something because I saw a lot of empty tables while I was waiting. I ordered some hummus and corn bread for appetizers and had a first rate burger and fish tacos.  The hummus was really good and the corn bread was pretty decent but I was somewhat disappointed with the burger and the tacos.  The fries were oily and in pieces like they were scraped off the bottom of an old batch and the burger was rather disproportionate as if it was a giant meat ball so it was a little difficult to eat.  The fish tacos were rather bland as well. Our waitress kept up good on her service at least though so I'll give this an okay.,0.9247,0.812,0.133,0.055,0.5614583333333333

I was actually surprised at the number of people at the restaurant given the awful weather - the rest of my party had arrived before me and already had tossed back a few glasses of wine by the time I arrived. My wife and I both ordered the tacos and got them ""green"" which means they give you a decent amount of full, crisp lettuce leaves instead of tortillas.  A great option for all you fellow carb-minimizers out there and I was very excited to see that on the menu.  I had the filet mignon version; she had the chicken.  I thought the steak was tender and delicious but a little on the salty side (which I actually love but try to avoid).  I laughed a little bit at the amount of guacamole that came with the tacos, I think it was about 2 teaspoons.  I hate it when ya get skimpy with the guac dammit! One of our friends ordered the chilean sea bass, which had me extremely excited.  Luckily our friend was in a sharing mood and we got to try some - it was good but not nearly to the quality I've had at some other places; Devon Seafood Grill comes to mind, good god their sea-bass is sexier than Lululemon extra-see-through yoga pants. I swear one of these days when a server drops off a plate of chilean sea bass I I'm going to yell ""Kick his ass, sea bass!"" and look around at everyone waiting for laughs at my awesome movie reference, only to be let down by blank stares or insults.  but this evening wasn't the right time or place for that.  maybe next time. oh and the wine... not so great.",0.9951,0.757,0.197,0.046,0.5554648526077097

2013-03-18,3.0,"Hub 51 was the selected dinner spot for my Golden 25th Birthday! I made reservations 2 weeks in advance to ensure my party good seating and no wait. However, I was completely displeased with the service upon arriving. The Host rudely threatened to take away our reservations if our entire party did not arrive within the next 15 minuets. My cousin felt the need to invite random people to have a drink with us just so we could be seated. Skipping that plan, my cousin thought it best for me to take off my winter coat and strut my shimmering, gold sequence, designer, rental dress just to make it a point to the Host that I was celebrating my Golden 25th Birthday. The lengths we had to go through were over and beyond. For that, I am deeply disappointed.  Finally seated my party ordered an array of entres: MISO SOUP & CALIFORNIA ROLL: This entre was nothing short of a typical miso soup and sushi roll however, for not being known for serving sushi, I was still pleased with it.  CHICKEN ENCHILADA STACK: These enchiladas were filled with braised organic chicken, covered in cheese and topped with salsa verde. This was also served with an order of rice, black beans and guacamole. My cousin who enjoys Mexican food said they held up to her standards!  BRAISED BEEF SHORT RIBS: My friend said, ""They were finger licking good!""  FIRST RATE CHEESEBURGER WITH HAND-CUT HUB FRIES: My cousin ordered this and described the burger as, ""Perfectly cooked and juicy."" She mentioned topping the burger with blue cheese was a mistake because she personally didn't like it.  MARGARITA: The margarita was the favored and most liked drink at our table. My cousins are avid tequila drinkers and hold high expectations when ordering a margarita. They described it as, ""strong with a good kick!"" I can testify that the rounds did not end at after one!  Overall the ambiance was very energetic for a Saturday night! Once everyone was conversing over dinner and drinks everyone forgot about how rude the Host was and had a good time. Also, I would not recommend going to Hub if you have a party larger than 11 people, in which, Hub requires a pre-fixed, family style, all you can eat menu. I was in the process of coordinating a pre-fixed menu with the party planner but was completely turned off by how expensive the additional labor cost was. Rather I would recommend the pre-fixed menu for a more major event such as a wedding reception, baby shower, or large business meeting. Furthermore, I was glad to see an array of options on their menu; gluten free, asian, hispanic, steak, fish, chicken, and even vegetarian! Next time I go back I would like to make my way to the Sub 51 and dance! Lastly, this Lettuce Entertain You restaurant definitely lives up to it's other Lettuce Entertain You locations!

They were huge, and pretty good, but the only thing that made them ""breakfast"" nachos were the eggs, otherwise they were just standard nachos. I ordered the hash brown benedict, which was okay. Their bacon is really sweet, and tasted a lot like beef jerky to me. My boyfriend got the short rib benedict- which was a much better choice. The service was fair, could be friendlier.

And the food here is DELICIOUS, we had the following: 1) Chicken Nachos - super yummy and HUGE. It seemed like the tortilla chips were made in house. They added beans for us because we had a lot of vegetarians, and then gave us chicken on the side. The nachos alone would have been plenty for an appetizer, but we also got two sushi rolls. 2) Sweet Potato Roll - I like this one way better than Sunda's. The roll comes with bbq sauce, but it is actually not too sweet. This seemed like the best veggie option. 3) Crunchy Tuna Roll - This was the table's favorite. We had to get 2 orders of this, just so everyone was fully satisfied. It's perfectly crunchy without too many tempura flakes, and overall just fresh and delicious. For dinner, we got the following: 1) Sea Bass - this was my favorite. It was really light and delicate and flaky, without skimping on the flavor. 2) Chicken Tacos - it comes with a big side of rice and beans, and the tortillas are made in house. This was so good, but I was way too full to have more than one. 3) Veggie Burgers - ehh, this was the groups least favorite dish.

So, instead of accidentally, I should say serendipitously because we sat at the mostly empty bar in Hub 51 and enjoyed being waited on by Lance, the bartender.  My wife had her first celebratory Cosmo and Lance served up a killer Negroni which, as he so rightly stated, ""is all about balance"". With 8:00pm dinner reservations, we were just looking for a few cocktails and a light lunch to tide us over, so we ordered the California Rolls and Brussels Sprouts Salad. The rolls were good but pretty standard, which is not a bad thing because I would run away from a place that has sushi on the menu and can't make a decent California Roll.  But the salad was really, really tasty and enjoyable, the bits of Medjool Dates a perfect companion to the cabbage flavor of the sprouts and shavings of Manchego cheese, toped by a light mustard vinaigrette.

Some diner in our group had food allergies which I noted on our reservation, however the hostess did not convey that to our server, so we had to ask to see the gluten free menus. (which by the way is huge and awesome)  Our server was really great about the food allergies, making sure to let us know if any of the items we ordered had the offending products in them, however the rest of his service was pretty terrible. It took almost 10 minutes before our table was even greeted, it was nearly impossible to order more drinks, and he never checked back once to see if we were enjoying our food.",0.9718,0.769,0.181,0.049,0.7773148148148148

I've been here twice for large group events (a bachelorette party of 15 and birthday party of 17) and highly recommend it.  I worked with event services beforehand to select a prix fixe, family style, bottomless menu -- for $34 per person you get three appetizers and three entrees (+$5 for dessert).  It works great because the food is ready quickly and there's a big enough selection to make everyone happy, and splitting the bill is a breeze.  They also do a customized menu for your event including a photo if you want.

Coming from a state that doesn't offer a ton of options nightlife wise; being on State street was party enough for me. We arrived at Hub around midnight. It was definitely crowded and the lower level was only accommodating people that purchased bottle service (starting around $500 bucks or something like that).

He played 90's hip hop (the real stuff), R&B, pop, Motown and rock. And the seg-way from each song (no matter the genre) was perfectly blended. The atmosphere was lively and loud. It was perfect.

NO ONE does it better than Hub in the nachos department (and many other departments for that matter.) First of all I was semi-hungover and needed something that would fulfill my craving for unhealthy hangover food. What I got was way more than I expected. A plate of pulled chicken nachos as big as my head, with chicken, guacamole, sour cream etc..and some fresh spicy salsa on the side. The guacamole was wonderful, chunky and a perfect compliment to the just-salty-enough tortilla chips and cheese. Everything about the nachos was jussst right. So right, in fact, that I have dreams about them and anxiously anticipate the day that my girls and I go back for lunch so I can get two orders, one for then and one to take home for later :) Be forewarned, however, that unless you are a professional eating champion there is no possible way that one person could finish the generous heaping pile of nachos that Hub provides.

At first glance, there were a lot of options and all reasonably priced. I enjoyed the humor of the witty menu and the upbeat music for a Sunday morning.  After a good amount of deliberation, I decided to get the Truffle Egg Sandwich with Brie. It also came with a side of their seasoned fries...and I ordered a mimosa! A girlfriend of mine ordered the Lemon Skinny and we were able to split the two dishes with lots of ease (big portions!)  The sandwich overall was very good. There was a bit too much egg for me so I took some off but the truffle made for a high-end breakfast sandwich along with the Brie. The fries never disappoint either, with their seasonings and ketchup for the side.  The one dish that made this review worthwhile was the Lemon Skinny. I kid you not that I am not a big pancake lover due to my lack of a liking for syrup, but these pancakes are more like a giant plate-sized crepe. Served with raspberries and a huge helping of lemon butter (tastes and smells like ice cream...I dare you to think otherwise!), the pancakes were AMAZING.

My Chicka is pretty friendly and is a big fan of tipping the server and scrubbing the hotel room for the maid because she worked in the service industry and really ""feels for those on the front lines"". So, a female server is not friendly... it is certainly not for lack of trying on my Chicka's part. The Fish Taco's rock! We have been coming here for years and can see a difference in portion and cost. We used to believe that the Fish Taco's were an unbelievable deal for what you got for the cost. They have however become smaller over time. For $18 they really have become skimpy on the fish. We also get the Asian chicken and chopped Chicken salads all the time. Unfortunately... they also as cheap on the included items. They are advertised as meal salads.... to who we wonder. Yum, a plateful of wilted old lettuce and 4 tomatoes drowned in salad dressing.

I found a few places in Yelp that were within walking distance from the tour and thought Hub 51 sounded interesting based on the menu but had no idea what to expect. We were in shorts and t-shirts and thought we were heading to a fairly casual spot for a quick bite that Friday night. When we walked in and saw that it was quite nice inside and also very busy I got worried. The hostess asked it we had reservations and I was even more worried. I sheepishly said no and felt stupid for not thinking ahead. The hostess quickly made some adjustments and we were seated in less than a minute. Great start. When we looked at the menu we saw numerous things we wanted to order. Luckily we hadn't eaten yet that day so we were plenty hungry. We ordered and shared: the signature miso-glazed salmon roll - don't bother, it doesn't have much flavor jerky (3 types of homemade jerky) - very tasty if you're into jerky shaki-shaki tuna - fantastic though the rice is a bit thick cornbread - great flavor and not dry at all like some other reviewers said short rib nachos - SO good. When they first arrived, we saw the amount of meat on top and though it was reasonable given the fact that this was not an expensive dish. But, as we ate we realized there was a huge pile of meat hidden under the first layer of chips! Awesome flavor and value. They come with a little pitcher of really tasty salsa that goes amazingly well with the short ribs. pulled pork tacos with lettuce cups instead of shells - great flavor, tender pork with peppery crispy edges They have a great beer selection and a fantastic signature drink called the Hub Punch. I had the Hub Punch Part Deux and it was so good I wish I had one right now. It tasted like a liquid Starburst. The service was also really good.

My husband threw a bachelor party here for his brother and it was a great success.  Everyone enjoyed their meals and they make good drinks here.

I don't know whether it's the quality of the organic, pulled chicken, the fresh guacamole, the Oaxaca (which is just fun to say) cheese, or the fire-roasted salsa but bite after bite, these were the best nachos I'd ever eaten. And, at $14 a plate, reasonably priced. You are not ready for how much food it is. You'll be tempted to get a meal. Don't. You won't have room to eat it. I discovered that the hard way. Nachos and cocktails are more than enough for a good time. Yes, cocktails. It's a River North hotspot, so a bangin' cocktail menu is, most definitely, front and center. I started with the Five Alive: pink grapefruit vodka (you read that correctly), lime juice and agave nectar (pass on the salted rim). Refreshing and addictive, this drink will get you ready for a night of fun. Hub sells them by the pitcher. #dangerous. As I ate the neverending plate of nachos and sipped my healthy cocktail (grapefruit and nectar are healing elements, y'all), I began to regret my entree order. Not because I didn't think it would be good but because I didn't think I would have room for it. I valiantly dove into my open-face BLT with slabs of bacon, frisee, tomatoes, bleu cheese, and a vinaigrette dressing served on a slab of bread... but I was already over-titrated. It didn't help that the fries that came with the sandwich were magically delicious. I, literally, could not stop eating. It's a good thing there was more booze to drink. Think of it as a digestif. To end my meal, I had a black tea-based cocktail with cognac and St. Germaine. Mhm. That's right. Not only was it perfect for the season, but it healed me! I no longer felt as though I was about to pop! I left Hub 51 a little saddened that it had taken me so long to get there. The reviews about wait time and attitude can be scary. I'll give you that.

With an LEY gift card in hand, my group of 4 decided that Hub 51 was the place to go for a swanky din-din on a Saturday night. Only problem? We didn't make a reservation, and they don't take reservations over the phone (commence sadface). The hostess reported an hour wait, but when we arrived live and in the flesh, a 4-top in the bar area opened up, and we jumped on it. Perfect! It's the full menu in the bar (or, at least, as far as I could tell) and we had a nice, quiet, cool corner to ourselves. Score!  The menu is right up my alley: seriously, you're a genius in my book if you have the balls to put tacos and sushi next to each other, PLUS burgers. Why go anywhere else, then? Well, I'll get to that.  First: the guacamole for starters. Smooth and really creamy, I was hoping for a one-two punch of spice and salt, but it didn't deliver enough of either. The chips served with it, however, were crispy and light, but in my mind, under-seasoned. Yeah, I know, don't kill us with the salt, but we still like it! Next: all four of us went for the burger, 3 beef, one veg. The reports from my dinner mates were middle-of-the-road...no one was jumping for joy over their meal, with exception of their french fries, which were deeeeelish. I opted for the veggie burger, a thick, dense patty mostly comprised of lentils and beans. The patty itself was the best part of the burger--fantastically moist while holding its shape, and tasty, too. I would have done more to dress it up, though--the grated cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickle, and nondescript bun did nothing to enhance the flavors. Garlicky mayo, chili ketchup, perhaps? C'mon, people. I'd say the service was the deciding star-factor here: our server was fine. Just--fine. Nothing special---he checked on us the compulsory amount of times, so that counts for something. But he didn't know how to answer our beer questions (we ARE pros, I know, but...) and his attitude was just, I dunno, lackluster.  For such a hoppin' place, I was hoping for more.

I just return from Mother's Day Brunch at Hub 51 and it was mediocre at best.  The food was just okay mildly warm and the eggs, egg benedict, sushi, hash browns pancakes were almost non existent.  The staff was struggling to keep food available on the buffet warmers.  While the french toast was excellent, the waiter brings that dish to the your table separately.  For a party of 7 he put 5 rather small pieces of French toast on our table.  That wasn't enough and when we asked for another order, he wanted me to ask the table how many additional slices we wanted.  It was rude and unprofessional.  The waiter was not attentive and we found ourselfs always turning around asking for assistance in removing our plates, replenishing our drinks, etc. What I found to be interesting, is when he brought over the check for payment, he had 18% gratuity added to our check.  I am a gracious tipper when it is warranted, however, I refuse to give this guy $42 for the lack of service he provided. I had the tip removed and he received 10% which turned about to be $25.  I believe I still over compensated  him for the service he provided. Needless to say, I was disapointed with the service and the food was just okay.  On a positive note, my family did rave about the chicken nachos.",0.9565,0.825,0.123,0.052,0.5622727272727273

Our server, Emily W, started by asking us if we had ever dined there before so she could give us the rundown. When we didn't immediately order drinks, she was very chill about it, and not pushy at all. When I couldn't decide between two drinks, she gave me additional information. When my drink came, and it was way too salty (the prickly pear), she happily switched it out for the other one I was leaning toward (Hub Punch Part Deux -- So good -- tastes like sweet tarts). My girlfriend's drink was really good as well - it was Pomegranate Mojito. Both of us ordered burgers, me the regular one, her the green chili burger. Both were excellent, and the fries are made just right. To top it all off, we then ordered the recommended dessert, the carrot cake. One word: AMAZING. Just do it. Order the carrot cake.

The two of us were pretty hungry when we arrived and may have ordered a little too much since the portions were very decently sized. We started off with an Absolut Bloody (could've been spicier)  and a St. Germain with OJ (80% St. Germain, 20% OJ, talk about a brunch cocktail!).  We got the guacamole and chips as an appetizer (which was huge for two ppl), and it was pretty good- a bit on the creamier side but the chips were wayyy too thin and kept breaking when we dipped. My friend got the short rib benedict and I opted for the restaurant week lunch menu for $22.  The short ribs were a bit on the small side for the cost and my friend finished pretty quick, but they were delicious, rich and filling. I went with the brussel sprout salad (the dates with manchego cheese was a great combination), the grilled fish tacos (3 huge pieces of baja rubbed fish with rice, beans, salsa, and slaw; really really good), and the carrot cake.  The carrot cake was my favorite part!  Although I was already full, I couldn't get enough of the carrot cake, the slice was huge too.  The cake was moist and full of flavor, the cream cheese filling and frosting was rich and not too sweet, and the whipped cream was fresh and absolutely wonderful. Overall, really great experience.  I took away one star since I thought the prices were too high for the food quality, but that's probably because they're located directly in River North's restaurant area.  And I took another star away because the service was extremely slow and a little bit inattentive.  Also, it's quite loud since the space it completely open.  With a full dining room, a bar in the center, and TVs going, it was hard to hear my friend speak.  It'd be a great place to great drinks and hang out on the weekends though.",0.9981,0.778,0.206,0.016,0.641268115942029

The nachos - oh holy hell, they are exactly that... everything good and bad in this world and beyond on a singular plate. Did God create this or the devil himself? Both angles can be believably argued, as this is a dish comprised of hearty lust, savory sins and everything you'd want in heaven. If any of these statements are blasphemous, I'll happily step to the side and hang out in purgatory for just one more stab at those nachos.

Came here on a date last Friday night (caution: do not come here on a date; there is more than too much to distract you from your companion; prime neck snappage in this joint.), and had a wonderful experience-minus the date. Entered with the obligatory ""hey, hi, ID please.""

The bartender - a sweet and apt redheaded gent, who knew exactly how to make a Hendricks gin gimlet. No sugar. Not full of ice. Fresh lime. He was attentive and speedy; not sloppy and arrogant as I find in so many of Chicago's most happening waterholes. We were seated by the window facing the bar, so the people watching elevated our real estate value immensely (again, do not go here on a date). Our waiter was young, hip, knowledgeable about the dishes and could even recommend suitable wines to pair.   I had the pork shoulder accompanied by my steady friend Mr. Hendricks. It arrived exactly as described; simply plated atop what tasted like real (not boxed) mash with a light au jus drizzled over the dish.  The meat was piping hot and butter tender. Very lightly flavoured, and not over salted. Its drippings were just enough to flavour itself and the mash. I've not enjoyed a pork shoulder that left me feeling light - I didn't feel like I had just eaten a quarter of a wild animal. Very well done on the part of the chef. My companion had the sea bass over asparagus, and it was light and airy with a fine seared crisp. A cleanly and beautifully done fish, paired with the house pinot gris, another fine recommendation from the waiter.

We ordered the chicken nachos, fillet Mignon tacos, and short ribs.  All were pretty good, but not A-mazing.  The food was also a little cold, which is semi-disappointing, but not life ending. As for cocktails, the hub punch is definitely delicious, and decently priced. Service was great!  Our server was attentive enough, but not overly attentive or annoying.   Given that it was date night, we were more into each other than the scene.  However, the scene did look happening!  If you're going for the nightlife, I would suggest making a later reservation (8:00 ish) and going from dinner down to Sub51, which apparently opens at 10:00.   I would go back with my girlfriends, really just for drinks and scene, but not really a date spot.",0.99,0.794,0.184,0.022,0.5852222222222222

2012-02-16,2.0,"I want to start by saying the area in which this restaurant resides in is a semi-decent location. Perfect for anyone that likes to eat out and get a porn afterward. Hubbard is the porn district! Hub 51 is at the corner of Hubbard and Dearborn, as soon as you walk in the restaurant you are not greeted, at ALL! Personally I like to feel welcomed. When we were greeted the host was quick to get us to the table and leave. As you sit down you are surrounded by an industrial like setting lit up by candles, the lighting is very dim and perfect for those who love to drink!                           When our waitress finally presented the menu, she was very informative with the specials and drinks, our waitress was the high-light of our night. We decided to get the Rainbow Sushi roll which was good, but not the best I have had, especially for the price! My fiance ordered the Hub Punch and I ordered the Five Alive for our drinks..The Hub punch was dull and by far TOO strong, definitely not to my liking. My Five Alive drink was great and the best part of my experience at Hub 51! We ordered dinner, my fiance had The SKIRT STEAK AL PASTOR....It was the most disappointing dish he has ever had! You basically got a steak the size of a remote control, and I don't mean a big one. Your side dish is a bunch of sweet potato string fries, which tastes good if you like that kinda stuff. The dinner also came with a small cup of some sort of southwestern style sauce to dip the steak in, the sauce was just OK! . But a man wants a thick juicy steak with potatoes and root vegtables, not this shit!                   For my dinner I ordered the FILET MIGNON STEAK TACOS which happened to be delicious, at medium rare the steak was melt in your mouth good, and the Five Alive cocktail drink complimented the dinner perfectly! The proportion is perfect! But honestly I have had better, not to say it was bad because it was't! I found it to be a decent price and something I would defenitly go back for, but I would not say this is a gem in the river north area.

2012-02-16,2.0,"I'm going to save a lengthy rant about restaurants and bars that lure you in with style then fail to deliver anything valuable by way of substance. Suffice it to say that this describes my experience at Hub 51 to a T. I'll admit it, Hub 51 is well laid out with a beautiful industrial-chic motif. Further, the menu at first glance is pretty intriguing, combining equal parts Asian, Mexican, and traditional American fare. Good design and a solid concept, however, do not a great restaurant make. The problems with the cuisine were due primarily to execution (exhibits A, B & C: overcooked Pacific King Salmon, forgettable-yet-overpriced sushi, and the Brussel Sprout Salad, a dish that with almonds, dates, and manchego cheese should in theory be hard to mess up). On drinks, I can only speak to the Chipotle Margarita which once again seemed to fail less from a lack of creativity and more due to poor execution. The service was unable to make up for any ground lost to the mediocre food. I think a lot of the poor service could be blamed on the fact that we were seated by a large (~15) group that came in only about 15 minutes after us. We were clearly an afterthought throughout the meal, not even receiving the perfunctory 'how is everything?' and, inciting my own #1 pet peeve, forcing us to wait roughly 15 minutes to get the check at the end of the meal. A restaurant doesn't have to be perfect in every way for me to go back. Unfortunately Hub 51 just missed the mark in too many ways to justify a return. In a food city this great, the opportunity cost of a bad meal out is much higher than the price you paid (which, as an aside, will not be unsubstantial here). With that in mind, I'd recommend looking elsewhere.",-0.8288,0.768,0.103,0.128,0.5165445665445666
2012-02-15,3.0,"Decided to check out Hub 51 with my girlfriend after we had both heard a number of great things about it!  Made a reservation a couple of days prior and was seated immediately upon arrival.  The restaurant looked awesome inside with a large and well spaced seating area. The service was great. Our waitress regularly checked up on us and was very timely with our order.  We started off the night ordering Pomegranate Mojitos which were very good. I later ordered the Hub Punch which is a mixture of Grey Goose Le Citron, Cazadores Reposado Tequila, Licor 43, and Pomegranate which was AMAZING and by far the highlight of the night. The Hub Punch was very strong but not overpowering and at $8 a glass I found it to be very reasonably priced considering the quality of drink that I was receiving.  As for the food my date ordered the Premium Fish Grilled Tacos while I ordered the Filet Mignon Steak Tacos (which the server recommended since I couldn't make up my mind). The plates came extremely fast and the food was enjoyable but nothing spectacular. However, I found that the portion was rather small and left me slightly hungry.  At $19 for my entree I found it to be overpriced for a plate of steak tacos that I could get at most other restaurants for about half the price.  Overall, I think that hearing all of the positive reviews sort of raised my expectations for this place and unfortunately I was slightly disappointed with Hub 51.  I would definitely return for drinks, and perhaps to try a different entree.  In short based on our experience and what was ordered: Positives: - Nice decor, and adequate table spacing for large parties or couples. - Great service. - Fantastic and reasonably priced drinks. Negatives: - Small portions for the tacos. - Overpriced plates for good but average food.",0.9949,0.792,0.188,0.02,0.5290902687056532

I was delighted to see sushi on the menu, but I quickly gave up the idea of ""eating light"" when I saw the sandwich selection. After much thought, I decided on the new & improved egg sandwich (described as fluffy scrambled eggs, truffle butter and melted brie), which comes with fries. My friend ordered the Chilean sea bass entree. We were both completely thrilled! My sandwich, with its mounds of scrambled egg and ginormous hunks of brie, was difficult to fit in my mouth, and I could only eat half of it, but that made it perfect for sharing with my friend, whose sea bass entree was completely pleasing to her, but is pretty much just the fish in broth. She sampled what was left of my sandwich and we both enjoyed the strangely addicting skinny French fries.  I had a glass of wine, but my friend had a very tasty prickly pear margarita, which she thought was a kind of ""skinny"" version of the popular drink.

The perfect blend of tequila and vodka, the ""Hub Punch"" features Grey Goose Le Citron, Cazadores Reposado Tequila, Licor 43, and Pomegranate. Now, I'm well aware that most people would never contemplate mixing vodka and tequila, but this drink was insanely smooth and free of hints of either liquor. It had notes of orange and pomegranate, but not obnoxiously fruity either. Seriously - - the PERFECT COCKTAIL. What makes this even better? It's only $8 a glass or $32 for the pitcher. This my first time at the restaurant, but consider it love at first sip! After losing count of how many drinks I had, it was time to ""break the seal"". Guess what? Even the bathroom in this place was gorgeous. Individual stalls with solid wood doors and amazing lighting! I was in bathroom heaven. My girlfriend did an awesome job putting together a menu for her 30th birthday and I think the Roasted Turkey Chopped Salad was what my dreams are made of. I wish I could comment on the other items, but the salad and hub punch were all that I had.... oh, and a bit of sushi, the Miso-Glazed Salmon Roll. The sushi was forgettable, but the salad was delicious and the Hub Punch was the essence of amazeballs!  I wish I could spread that drink from coast to coast... package it up and sell it! *sigh* Oh, the memories... I need that cocktail in my life lol...

The Italian bread was very good, the scrambled eggs were very light and fluffly while also being rich and having a hint of truffle oil, thankfully not too much.  Truffle oil gets deserved negative press for being an artificial flavoring made from somthing called 2,4-dithiapentane and olive oil and having no truffles in it. I dont think they would use fake vanilla, krab or artificial bouillon cubes so maybe its time for a forced truflle oil seperation.

When people from out of town come to visit for the weekend, I always make it a point to take them to Hub even if it just for drinks. I highly suggest making a reservation no matter what time of day you go. There have been limited times where I've popped in without one and still was able to be seated right away. The wait staff, hostesses and bartenders are never short of polite and helpful. For dinner I suggest trying the tuna and Thai basil sushi roll; the unique, refreshing flavor is one that I've only tasted here. I also suggest, during cold months, to order the chicken tortilla soup. It's whipped, thick and is complimented by thinly sliced chicken pieces; basically it's a tasty meal in itself. For brunch, I suggest the short rib benedict which is a symphony of savory meat and gooey fresh eggs or the lemon skinny pancakes that are perfectly crafted crepes complimented with lemon butter. To top off your early afternoon meal, order the River North mimosa and not just because I'm wild about their Hub punch (or Hub tea in the winter) but because it's a flavor you can only get here. Being a Lettuce Entertain You restaurant they pride themselves on service and delicious food and Hub 51 delivers. It's reasonably priced especially for the quality of food you are given.

A fabulous option if I do say so myself! The bar is crowded, however the bartending staff is well observant and know who is new and waiting for a drink. Forget having to wait for thirty minutes or some random to pick up your drink. One of the bartenders will see you and get it for you in minutes.

Absolutely nothing separates the decor/music/ambiance, but that's not necessarily a bad thing if you're looking for a chilled, sports bar atmosphere, but don't want an Irish/pub style scene.  The prices were reasonable, the portions were sufficient, not too large/small.  We shared the guacamole app and the jerky/charcuterie app. The jerky/charcuterie was a joke to be honest, and I suspect the olives were quite old since they lacked the distinct olive taste. The meat was, as advertised, jerky and bacon. Pretty boring. The guacamole was actually nice, and comes in a cool mortar/bowl and has corn as the base of the guac. They could had provided more chili sauce in the middle of the tortilla chip plate, but whatever.  I had the sea bass, which I must say was delicious. Very pleasantly surprised as I didn't expect this place to make anything really tasty. It came in a broth with pea tendrils which were okay, but the broth was quite bland. My friends had the enchiladas and the seared tuna and it looked just fine to me.  I would probably give this place a 2 if not for the really tasty sea bass.

So myself and  the person I came with both ordered burgers.  I ordered the cheeseburger and she ordered the green chili burger and both of us ordered sweet potato fries ( some one else in a yelp Review to get those).  Big mistake they were thiner than shoestring French fries and COLD!  The green chile burger had a clump of cheddar that wasn't even melted! Bleh!  The cheeseburger was good but not for almost a two hour wait!   Luckily server was pretty good but the only saving grace of the night was the carrot cake!   Really moist and the frosting was excellent.   So would come her again??  Maybe, for the carrot cake, but not during rush hour and NOT without a reservation!   Addendum: hostess came and removed the charge of the the carrot-cake for our trouble.....some redemption points there.",0.9817,0.868,0.124,0.007,0.5436148818501759
2011-09-13,3.0,"I was here for a friend's 30th birthday party. The menu was preselected and had an assortment of ""endless"" appetizers, entrees, and desserts for the group. Good atmosphere in the back bar area where most of the larger parties are seated; the volume level is considerably lower than by the front bar. Too many meatheads on staff working the door. A few of them were congregating near the revolving door causing people to get smacked as they tried pushing their way in, and grunted when asked to kindly move. What worked: Chicken tacos were quite tasty. The salsa tasted like grocery store bottled, though. Their ""ultimate"" burger was pretty good. Nothing too special though. Transparent tomatoes ahoy. Grr. The salmon....cubes...were very good. Cooked perfectly, I ate more of these than anything else, and there was a lot of food served. Spicy tuna rolls weren't spicy. Some pieces were almost entirely vegan. Cornbread is fine, but it's nothing super special. I may have missed it, but it would be better if they served it with some honey butter. Carrot cake. Well duh, it's fantastic. Best reaction ever: ""that's not ice cream!"" (yes, there are two huge dollops of frosting on the plate.) What didn't: Brussels sprout salad. I like brussels sprouts, but they just didn't work in this salad at all. Others at my table gobbled up at least three servings. I felt it lacked a lot of flavor, which is to say I couldn't really find a flavor at all. Hub Punch: It's tasty and not overpoweringly boozed-up. At $38/pitcher, though, you're better off choosing something else unless you like overpaying for fruit juice/lemonade/well liquor. S'mores pie: It sort of melted all over the plate and looked like a pile of poo.

2011-09-01,4.0,"Hub 51 was highly recommended to me by a friend whose opinion I quite value, but for some reason, I was still prepared to be underwhelmed. Admittedly, I thought Hub51 would be a Kardashian of sorts... stylish on the outside, dull when you really think about it, and with that air of being more important than it really is.  I was expecting a modern, sleek, and hip look with mediocre food and overpriced drinks, a ridiculous ""place-to-be-seen"" kind of crowd. I gotta say, I was really impressed and I take back all my negative-vibe-beams.  I went with a party of seven people on a celebration dinner with a 10pm reservation on a Saturday night. Everyone chose something different for dinner and everyone seemed more than content. My pork tacos were AMAZING. And I am Picky McChoosersons when it comes to my beloved pork-filled tacos. The handmade tortillas were pretty super as well! Someone else got veggie tacos, which she reported were as great as they looked. Another friend said the bacon on his knife-and-fork BLT was the ""best bacon I have ever had."" I saw his plate, and if there is such a thing as picture-perfect model bacon, there were two strips of Gisele in bacon form on that burger. Perfect. One girl got nachos and the portion was comically huge. I swear it kept regenerating itself, because  she had barely made a dent in it before she was stuffed. The nachos were probably meant for the table to share, but oh well! Seriously, everyone loved their food. Drinks were pretty good. I had a better Manhattan at Paris Club next door, but I'll let it go because I was all high from bacon-scent-endorphins. It was crazy busy in there and I thought our server was pretty great despite looking obviously stressed, not outstanding but not bad at all, had no problem dealing with seven credit cards.  Only two things I disliked at this visit: We got there a bit early so had to wait for our table (no prob), but the packed bar meant we had to stand awkwardly in the way of a ton of people eating, shimmying up to the bar, people going to the bathrooms and Sub51, and employees trying to do their job while crushed in a throng of people. That kind of sucked, not the waiting, but the not having enough room for people to wait. I'll have to come back again and see if this happens all the time or not. Also, the huge line of people waiting to get into Sub51 totally blocked the path to the bathrooms at the end of the hall. I, and like three other bathroom-seekers, had to literally squeeze through this huge mess. Even if people wanted to get out of our way, they couldn't because it was just that packed. Hugely inconvenient, inefficient, and probably not super safe, especially for anyone in the path of a pack of people who need to pee!

The carryout service is always fantastic and their timing is really accurate so I would recommend it.  I've had the veggie burger on several occasions and once ordered a greek salad. The greek salad was absolutely terrible so I would definitely steer clear of that. The iceberg lettuce wasn't washed properly and the salad itself wasn't exciting at all. The veggie burgers aren't the best ever, but are more interesting than a Boca burger since they are made at the restaurant. Even though the menu makes them seem flavorful, they could stand to pack more of a punch. The portion size is really big so I think that they are a good value.

2011-08-05,2.0,"I would have loved to give Hub51 more stars. It looks like a great place and the atmosphere is great. The service and food quality leave much to be desired. My wife and I had dinner at Hub51 in Chicago last night. The valet was great but a bit over priced at $12. When we walked in we felt like the ambiance was great. At 6pm the restaurant/bar was about 75% full on a Thursday night.  Now for the bad part. The beer I ordered was warm, somewhat flat, and a bit watered down. It was from a tap. When I asked about it they said they had a power outage recently and some of the beer barrels where not chilled for some time. So I felt like they were treating me like a chump and trying to get rid of their bad beer on me. They said they would bring me another from a different tap. The second beer was much better and colder which only confirmed my suspicions. We ordered a salad to share, my wife ordered the Chilean Sea Bass and I had the chicken enchiladas. Number one rule for salad - make sure the lettuce or spinach is not wilted. Some of my salad had wilted and somewhat rotten spinach. Apparently they're trying to save a buck by using old salad. Next came the main course. My wife's Chilean Sea  Bass at $21 left much to be desired. It was a small piece (4-6 oz) of fish on top of a scoop of plain white rice. No garnish or seasoning of any kind. Just plain fish and rice that had absolutely no taste to it. She ended up sending it back and had them bring here the Ahi Tuna special which was much better. My chicken enchilada (at $14) was nothing special. Side of black beans, side of Verde sauce, and a stack of tortillas, chicken, guacamole, salsa, topped with cheese. I can get the same quality meal at my local burrito joint for 4.99. I do have to give credit to our waiter who accommodated us no matter what the issue.  Total meal was about $70 w/tip.

Often, I like to go to restaurants only once since there are thousands of choices in this city, but Hub 51 provides a fun and fabulous scene without breaking the bank. Many times at other establishments, I'll enjoy a delightful dinner and when the bill comes, I want to cry myself to sleep as soon as I get home. Whenever I eat at Hub 51, I feel like I ate a fantastic ""fit for foodies"" meal without the financial guilt. Food Recommendations (I've eaten there more times than I can remember and have hosted a few business meals there as well):  1. Hub Punch for Cocktails 2. Open-face BLT sandwich is AMAZING. I'm not sure what's going on with their bacon, but I'll tell you... it's a GOOD time!  3. Chicken Nachos 4. Onion Rings for Appetizers (even though it's considered a side order). The tempura batter (though a little greasy) is a nice twist to the traditional batter. 5. Sonoma Salad (WITH chicken). I add chicken to the salad to make it a substantial meal for lunch/dinner. (You know... sometimes salads for a meal is a joke. ""I'm gonna be good tonight. I'll order a salad."" Then an hour later, you're starving and eat two bowls of ice cream. So trust me, get it with the chicken... it's delish anyway!) 6. Turkey Meatloaf Sandwich (Totally not your ""old school"" meatloaf!) On select nights (I think Thursdays and weekend nights?), there is a DJ spinning... and surprisingly.. the music is ON POINT! You'd think for River North all you'd hear is Hall & Oates, Bruce Springsteen and ""Sweet Home Alabama."" (Oh, River North. You're so... hetero.) Thank gawd Hub 51 plays current or contemporary music that doesn't make me feel like I'm in a dive bar... from Michael Jackson to Justin Timberlake, B.I.G. to Miley, Britney to Akon... One thing that annoys me about Hub 51 (and a lot of ""trendy"" or ""upscale"" restaurants), though, are the restroom attendants. Great. So you handed me a paper towel. How is that worth a couple dollars? This service is not luxurious to me. But... I also say this because I'm a grad student with the stipend worth one week's of a CEO's salary. Anyway, I'm moving out of Chicago soon so I'll really miss this spot! It's great for entertaining guests from out of town, has an energetic feel, and the wide variety of food & drink on the menu is a plus for the finicky eaters among us.

2011-07-26,3.0,I think Hub 51 is one of the more attractive restaurants downtown. It is new age and not cram packed with the typical douchbags.  On the other hand it can be a bit over priced for the amount of food you get. My recommendation would be to take advantage of their weekday specials (like half priced sushi).  The portions are all askew. My salad was huge and I ended up taking half of it home. On the other hand my friend ordered the fresh fish of the day and it was tiny. She ended up ordering an appetizer to fill her up.  They are pretty typically priced with their drinks for downtown.

First, the chicken nachos.  They're out of this world.  The salsa is amazing. It isn't spicy, but it is warm and roasted and utterly delicious.  The chicken and cheese are generous and the perfect amount of sour cream and guac are included.  And you know how lots of times with nachos once you get past the first layer there isn't any topping left?  Not with these!  Everything is layered throughout so there is no chance of your running out of topping before you run out of chips.  And there's a very good chance you won't get to the bottom of the platter no matter what.  Even with three people eating these as our main course for lunch, we can't quite finish. Then there are the teriyake salmon maki rolls.  Delicious.  Not out of this world, or better than maki at my favorite sushi places, but definitely a solid choice that will not disappoint. And the shining star of the menu?  The dish that I almost cried over when told they didn't also have it at Paris Club (not that they would, but a girl can dream)?  That would be the butterscotch pot de creme.  You really should never go to Hub 51 without ordering one of these.  Since last year, I fear every time I go in that a menu change will take them away from me, but so far so good.  I really cannot imagine a more perfect dessert- butterscotch creme covered with a thick layer of actual butterscotch sprinkled with sea salt...and generally I don't even like butterscotch that much! I never think of Hub 51 as being one of my favorite restaurants, but if you told me to make a list of my 10 favorite restaurant items in the city, I'd bet their chicken nachos and butterscotch pot de cremes would make the list for sure.",0.9965,0.766,0.194,0.04,0.5947376543209877

The food was presented very well even though the server tilted the plate on its way from the kitchen and had to take it back to wipe the plate's edge down. The ranchero sauce was as bland as the black beans, very little spice or flavour. The egg was cooked well, but the meal was not as hearty or flavourful as I had hoped. The nachos that my table ate collectively was better than the huevos rancheros. Good concept with subpar execution.  The beer selection was decent but the server took long to return with the drinks.

The food here is very very good.  The menu's got everything from Tacos (splurge for pulled pork over the chicken), salads, sushi (BOGO until 6pm every day!), and burgers.  Everyone in our group enjoyed their dish, incl my Mom who ordered the pork shoulder.  Both times I've eaten here we've had sushi, and the rolls aren't anything out of the ordinary but delicious for what they are.  And even if you're stuffed, order the S'mores pie dessert thing.  It's out of this world with toasted marshmallows on top!  The 1st time we came with a group of friends, Eric (Manager) was kind enough to treat us to 3 desserts.  Props to him, we also tried the brownie with ice cream ... who wouldn't love that.   The bar and wait staff are all very nice and the atmosphere is impressive and pretty.  Once it gets a bit later at night, lots of well-dressed folks and Chicago socialites come through.  A hoppin' spot that's doing everything right!",0.9887,0.84,0.14,0.02,0.5681385281385282

2011-06-13,4.0,"Yum! Usually I am not a fan of these Houston type places (this  NYC speak), aka the all encompassing American but perhaps some Mexican and sushi too places, but this was good.  Recommended by a local Chicagoan (who I dined with), apparently the restauranteur knows what he is doing.  We came at 7pm, and had to wait a bit (with a ringer). We were seated around 7:30 or so. There were a few shake-ups re: service. Firstly, our waiter came around within a few minutes of sitting down...I mean, er we hadn't ordered yet, so that was a mess-up.  It did take a while for us to order though, and then another waiter came by to take our order...again? Clearly, the service was off and people were confused. Anyway, after 15 minutes or so perusing the menu, i settled on the Ahi Tuna Burger. It was really good- nice big patty (the portions are way better out in Chicago), toasted bun, juicy avocado, onion, tomato- I asked for it sans mustard, and wish I'd asked for it sans mayo, too. The tuna alone was standalone- really juicy, and an actual grounded tuna burger. The taste I'd tried was at Five Napkin in NYC and it was a tuna steak, but a juicy grounded burger.  The fries were delicious- and I love fries. Perfectly small and thin-cut, but not shoestring, they were seasoned and salted and peppered nicely. And juicy. And I ate ALL of them. :)  My companion had the fish tacos, which she says is a speciality. The plate was huge, as all of the entrees seemed. Came with standard 3 tortillas, which black beans, and very white rice. (bright rice!). Lots of pico de gallo and guac. She didn't finish it.  I did because I was starving!  Entrees came out to be around $16 or so, they were in this range and up.  The ambiance again, was a vast tub of chain restaurant, but good chain.

Before we could order dessert, the manager came over to greet us (we had been in touch with him via twitter that day), and to offer us a complimentary dessert of Carrot Cake.  My sister and I were dreaming of trying the carrot cake all day, so this was so sweet of the manager to offer.  The other girls agreed, and we waited for the cake. It was a gigantic slice, served with a dollop of whipped cream and a dollop of extra cream cheese frosting. Do you know how awesome that is!? Our table was pretty silent as we indulged in the BEST carrot cake we'd ever had. Even the other two at the table who are not usually carrot cake fans, were in heaven.

The average price for an appetizer or entree is around $15 - somewhat expensive for what is really average food.

Here's the story: It's a Friday on a 40 degree weather night for Chicago  in March (that was good weather for us), I'm smart so I made reservations for 8pm. Believe me on a Friday with plans at 8pm that was a smart thing to do! Walked in the place and it is CROWDED. I was thinking my type of place. The people? Yes, it was yuppie paradise. That doesn't bother me because I'm of a down to earth buppie (Black Urban Professional). Ahhh keep reading you might learn something from this, huh? It was several guys at the bar scoping out women. It looked weird because they just looked old and lame though. Like I said yuppie paradise: One woman walks in with NO reservations sometime after 8pm (my date and I were in our booth at this time), and she prances with her shopping bag in hand to the front desk like she was going to be seated right away. Let's just say she had egg on her face. That didn't happen because they place was packed. The FOOD: We started off with the Chicken Nacho's. OMG those things are huge and I'm glad we shared them. We didn't even get to finish them but we did make some damage. They are delicious and our friendly waitress said that was their famous dish. Avocado, cheese, green pepper, hot peppers and I'm sure I'm missing something else. The Food Part 2: We both had the cheese burger. It's a big thick burger and very juicy. I thought the French Fries had a decent taste but also a slightly different taste. The different part sent off my taste buds for the bad. It taste like someone sprinkle a sugar or sugar substitute on my fries. WHAT THE HELL? The VALET: Dropping off your car is EASY. Picking up your car is a long and obviously difficult process that the Valet drivers don't understand. While 40 is a nice weather to Chicagoans, it's not an ideal weather for women in dresses to stand outside in. Actually it's not an ideal weather for anyone to stand out in. Get me my car NOW!

2011-03-04,4.0,"All right, finally getting around to reviewing this place.  After about 15 visits, I suppose my opinion carries some weight, non? First off, carrying off a large volume restaurant is a challenge on many levels, but I give them credit.   A large space typically does not rely on local business only, having to cater to the tourist crowd & corporate events - yuck! - which inevitably causes problems (production, quality, service......) The food is well portioned (a peeve of mine if it is not) and well presented.  The variety of the menu (lunch or dinner) is well thought out and there is pretty much something for everyone.  Yes, the early evenings bring out the local convention crowd & later the party crowd moves in, which makes it impossible to get a drink!  The weekends bring out the touristas (where's the Area 51 restaurant?) and suburbanites on the town (what-it's how much?#?!) from a Snooki look-alike's boyfriend who clearly was not going to tip at this ""#@$%! place"". To enjoy the food without the distractions, try lunch or a weekday evening.  You will be able to sample the ""crispy baked potato debris"" or Dr. Ongs Thai shredded chicken salad - both very recommended!  My favorite mains are the filet mignon tacos, the standard filet and the Pac King Salmon.  All three are top notch.  I was disappointed with the Amish chicken recently, chalking it up to undercooking, but not sure. The sushi is above average as well, preference given to the sweet potato rolls the crunchy tuna rolls.  I get them as an appetizer and as a meal, depending on how I feel.  The Del Mar seafood salad is an interesting mix, but not entirely sure I like - held off on the hub vinaigrette as it's too potent for me.  Will have to try again..... Long story short, good choices and great food.  Take heed to the aforementioned crowd shifts if you want to enjoy your meal and don't expect proper service- waitstaff sometimes switches while you order, disappears at length and cannot tell you what is contained in each dish as they probably rotate staff weekly!",0.9946,0.777,0.177,0.047,0.49330933923957176

ChadTrixie level high, self importance to the moon, hilarity ensued with this combo.  Service - our waiter was as on top of us as he could be but a tad frazzled at times. Didn't help that our group of 4 turned into 10+ in a flash but he made it work. When we wanted to scoot he was able to split our bill out from the posse with nary a complaint. Thanks buddy.  Food - Chicken Nachos, potato bits and the spicy tuna roll. Nachos, cooled to fast as it was way to much, cut back a tad and make it a little more manageable. Potato bits - got to us cold and the small amount of condiments was weak - seriously, give a little more I don't want to burden your server with getting me more. Tuna Roll, kind of weak for the price and no chop sticks (when the tables around us had them) was a mild annoyance.  People - Hub has no control over this but really, is this the first time you have ever been out in the big city? Come on how about being cognizant of your fellow patrons.

Sushi, sandwiches and salads - and apparently they also have a great brunch.  Most of our table ordered sushi and also started with the order of chips and guacamole, which comes with roasted tomato salsa as well. My spicy crab hand roll was fresh, though small, and ended up perfect for the light lunch I wanted. However, I was a little jealous of the fish sandwich that came to our table as well - it looked great and came with a PILE of fries.  I wasn't wowed by the space or the food and I felt like we overpaid for the scene. $11 for chips & guacamole - really?? Tasted just like Chipotle to me!

But beyond the heavily silver studded crowd lies something worse... a menu that tried so diligently to be unique, BUT FAILED. Miserably.. Hub 51 seems to show a bit of initiative in composing their menu upon first glance but I urge that you DO NOT get your hopes up because they will be smashed like Prozac's on an inner city school bathroom counter.  Hub tries to use ""Cool"" terms for their food like 'chos instead of nachos but it really translates to ""How can we shorten up an already short word because I'm a douche bag and that's what we do.""

Now let me be fair, the first time our server, god bless her was dense in the head.  I yelped my concerns, and a manager responded to my review. I appreciated it, and decided to give it another try.  Second time, our food was not how we ordered--may have been a tiny problem in the kitchen.  Again, it was addressed and rectified.  Mildly annoying, but forgivable. I just dined there 2 nights ago.  A party of 3. It was an hour before closing.  Not 5 minutes before closing, an hour. The kitchen and bar were still open.  There were other customers too. Not slammed, actually a light house.  We stood at the entrance for 5 minutes waiting to be seated by the host/hostess.  I know this isn't Charlie Trotter but it ain't Apple Bees either.  A server who was on her way home (coat on and all) saw us and said ""Hey did you guys want to be seated?"" She drops her bag, grabs menus and seats us.  I appreciated her, but I wondered who the heck would allow that? If there was no house manager, where was the shift manager?  Okay we sit, we order.  We wait and wait for our drinks. We had to ask her for our beverages. Why? Maybe she forgot, I don't know...don't care.  She was sweet, but timid and didn't seem confidence about the menu.

If you type the order into a computer do it by seat number.  Serve the lady first, then the men. We got the food and all was well.

2010-12-20,4.0,"If you haven't much patience, please scroll down to the 5-spice fries and dessert passages! :)  Hub 51 is near my office and we've been a few times for 11am lunches.  At this point in the day there's no one eating there and it truly pays off as the servers take great care of you because the food is prepared with less of rush. The swanky, black dining room is fronted by a sizable bar. I love the black leather high chairs and dark wood tables offered as booths. Now on to the food, that's why you're reading this right?  Those 5-spice fries are bold, southern and mouth-watering!  I tasted black pepper, chili powder and BBQ.. they sorta remind me of Jay's BBQ chips which have similar flavors. These are definitely a unique treat and Hub 51 gives you plenty of them. We also love the pulled chicken nachos!  Hot and fresh green peppers and white cheese top crispy tortilla chips.  My friend enjoyed a generous glass of Malbec and ordered the Knife and Fork BLT. It looks like it has little bubbles of gourmet cheese and shredded lettuce over a brioche type bun.  I'm not a pork eater, but their chunky strips of dark bacon which are perhaps coated in brown sugar was slightly seductive in its presentation -- sitting over thick, red tomato slices. I opted for a glass of pinot grigio and ordered the Ahi Tuna burger, which is freshly-ground instead of the usual slice of frozen fish.  This moist and juicy treat came with several slices of creamy Avocado, mayo, shredded lettuce and tomato on a slightly toasted bun.  A lot of places overcook fish, but Hub 51 had no problem delivering it to me medium, just as I asked. We sealed the lunch with a slice of their chocolate pudding pie with buttery graham cracker crust. This pie came with what looked like whipped cream made from scratch.  There were long stretches of our eyes rolling back deep into our cranial cavities from the mouthgasms! The chocolate tastes as if it's dark mixed with a bit of caramel. The crust was so moist and it took us a while to figure out that they probably used a bucket of butter to make it. But dammit if I'm going to have heart problems, let's make it worth while! :)  I've always loved Health candy bars but I'm sure many of you know how tricky it is to scrap the fragments that stuck to your teeth off. That's what's great about this pie... it has all the goodness of a health bar, but none of the work is required. The soft pudding negates dental hell. I surfaced from this bliss with a tall, hot cup of decaf black. The tab was about $60 before tip but I have no regrets, what-so-ever.

There's a lot of pretentiousness going on here.  I feel like most of the people here are young and good looking and sporting as many labels as possible.  Exhibit A: I waited in a loooong line in the women's bathroom and no one said a single word to one another as they relentlessly primped and made faces of ""blue steel"" at themselves in the mirror.  Most of these women did not even acknowledge the existence of the assistant in the bathroom, nor did they offer a mere ""thank you"" for her services.  They avoided eye contact with you but you could feel them watching and judging you...wherever you went.  Maybe I'm just a small town girl, but this is not my scene whatsoever.   That said, I can't judge Hub 51 on the basis of its largely snobby clientele.  They get an A for effort in terms of decor, cleanliness, and most menu items.  The pulled chicken nachos and cornbread are particularly noteworthy in terms of late night bites.

I visited again during the week for lunch with a group of five. We did have a reservation this time (thank goodness, because even for lunch this place is packed!).  We were seated promptly and overall, throughout the visit, service was great. We were greeted quickly, water filled, drinks showed up in no time. Everything on the menu sounded so good that I couldn't decide what to get!  The table finally decided on the cornbread to start, followed by: knife and fork blt, chicken tacos, pulled pork tacos, fish tacos and a burger (no, not all ordered by me!). Based upon all of us that joined the clean plate club that day, this restaurant was enjoyed by all! The BLT was really fantastic - I wasn't expecting anything so unique for a BLT, but it was delicious and all of the flavors blended perfectly.  I heard that the tacos were all fantastic, although I didn't try them. I believe the burger must have been good as well, because it seemed to disappear.  Dessert was a chocolate cake. I didn't try the cake, but I did have a spoonful of the chocolate ganache that came with it. OH MY! SO FABULOUS! I'm a girl who knows her desserts and I was highly impressed!  The room got to be bustling early into the lunch hour, so I would definitely recommend reservations. This is a great spot for lunch (and I assume for dinner as well).

My mom doesn't keep kosher but she likes to share dishes so she was happy to oblige my vegetarian needs.  The menu was eclectic, and largely a mix of Modern American and Mexican dishes.  We split the Nachos (substituted black beans for chicken-no problem), Brussel Sprout Salad, and Ahi Tuna Burger.  The nachos came out first and I quickly understood how they could charge $13 for it.  The portion was huge, and loaded with fresh toppings.  Everything tasted like it was made from scratch and no component fell flat, from the chips to the guacamole to the black beans.  The white cheddar/oaxaca cheese blend was the star of the dish, and it was perfectly melted into every crispy bite.   I had heard great things about the Brussel Sprout Salad from my wife and was excited to try it.  Unfortunately, I was underwhelmed.  I was looking for whole brussel sprouts but the salad included only the ""leaves"" of the brussel sprout.  It wouldn't have bothered me so much if it wasn't so lacking in flavor.  I don't like to doctor my food with salt and pepper but this salad really needed it.  The ingredients were fresh and well put together but I was forced to add some pepper in order to feel like I was eating something substantial.  The manchego cheese did add some flavor, but I would have liked to see more of it on the plate. The Ahi Tuna Burger, on the other hand, did not disappoint.  I appreciated that the burger was in actual burger form and not just a piece of tuna on a bun.  It was cooked to a healthy medium rare and well-seasoned.  The accompaniments (avocado, mayonnaise, mustard, ginger, tomato) were well-balanced and the entire sandwich held together nicely.  My only complaint is that it was a little heavy on the ginger.  The fries that came with it were excellent-hot, crispy, and just a little spicy.   Overall, the food was good, the atmosphere was vibrant, and the service was great-friendly and accommodating, yet professional.  Don't be intimidated by its swanky reputation-if you can handle the River North prices and want to have a fun, tasty dinner, Hub 51 is a great choice whether you're 25, 51, or even 62 (sorry Mom).   [Thanks for reading my review and be sure to check out my other reviews on Yelp.  My mission is to find restaurants that have great vegetarian, kosher, and vegan fare.  On every review, I rate food, service, atmosphere, and value on a 1-5 scale to give you quick and easy overview of the restaurant.  I love cooking, eating, and doing both with my friends and family.  I always welcome your questions, comments, and suggestions so contact me on Yelp or Facebook if you want to share ideas.]",0.999,0.754,0.218,0.028,0.5006204906204905

2010-10-26,4.0,Visited Hub 51 while on vacation in Chicago.  Arrived around 8pm on a Thursday night and didn't have a reservation.  We were told by the waitress that the wait would be 1.5 to 2 hours.  We decided that was too long of a wait and we would try coming back another night.  After I gave back the buzzer the hostess asked if we would like to squeeze 5 people into a 4 person table and we could be seated right away.  Of course we did that.  It worked out perfectly.   All I can say is order the Hub Punch.  It is delicious.  Sounds strange that it has vodka and tequilla...but don't worry...it is so good!  You will have more than one trust me.  Food was pretty good...with a wide variety of items from sushi to tacos and everything in between.   Love the fact that they play good music in the restaurant.  Cool vibe and nice ambiance.  Will come back next time I am in town.,0.9881,0.787,0.203,0.01,0.49621848739495805

We all got a variety of dishes but the only dishes that stood out for me was the crunchy tuna roll that had a bite to it and the carrot cake dessert was really good. This place has a club in the basement so if you're up for more drinking and some dancing you can just stay here after dinner.  Overall it was ok for a group gathering.,0.7958,0.916,0.084,0.0,0.52
2010-10-23,5.0,"Finally made a reservation at Hub 51, and on a Friday night it was pretty packed. But with the reservation it was like a 10 minute wait, so it worked out pretty perfectly. They card you just to get into the restaraunt, so no minors I guess are allowed in at all, even to eat. So its a very cool vibe in the place, nice ambiance. We were seated sort of on high chairs so we got to view the whole place, the music was bumping typical club jams, but it was very cool to listen to and to hear a song that makes you want to get up and dance while eating. The food was pretty incredible. We had chicken nachos for appetizer, and I was worried since I have sensitive teeth that it would be hard on them, but the nachos are fresh and cripsy and super thin, I believe they make them in house, along with their tacos. And the way they pile it is, they put nachos in the plate, put all the works in the middle, then put more nachos on top, and put more works on top, so all the toppings are evenly distributed instead of just put on top. My friend got the tacos, she loooved the fresh made tacos. I had the pork shoulder which was tender and tasty, with really good mashed potatoes. but its the dessert that made us a believer. We split a chocolate pudding pie,, and it had to be the best chocolate I have had in my life. I took one taste of it, and it sort of comes in sections. At first you're just like ""its just pudding"" and then its like ""oohh hersheys chocolate bar"" and then its ""ooh decadent cocoa"" either way this is something that happened in slow motion. Everytime we took a bite, we had to put down the fork and sit back. ""You can't eat this standing up, your knees buckle"". Wow.  Made reservations on open table, and make a note on the reservation it was my friend's bday, and I didn't remind them or anything when I got there, but when we ordered the cake they brought it with a candle, and it also got comped. They have a club downstairs, but it looked like you have to buy a bottle to get in. LOOOOOVE this place.",0.9963,0.821,0.164,0.015,0.6321380471380471

The scene is a bustling, yuppie crowd with a good vibe.  The bar is always packed on the weekends and when you want to step it up a notch, head down the stairs to their club/lounge Sub51 to pop a few bottles of Dom and hang with celebs (or wannabe celebs).  They fly in DJ's from all over the country and usually have a pretty solid crowd (a few nights its been hit or miss, but overall it's one of my favorite places in town) Hungover after all that?  roll in here for brunch, solid bloody mary's and some of the best b'fast around the Hubbard area.",0.9936,0.787,0.191,0.021,0.43152329749103946

Space us out a little and you could cancel your gym membership. Everyone recomends the sushi special, and they're not wrong. For half-price, the rolls were generous and delicious.

There is a distinct hierarchy here which includes: 1) those who have a table in the bar section, and 2) those who don't. Obviously this is true of most trendy bars, but the layout of this place greatly increases the divide. Unlike other drinking establishments, there is literally NO good place to stand. No matter where you are people will be sliding past you and bumping into you constantly. Its almost panic inducing and impossible to have a decent conversation with anyone.  Add onto this that the drinks are expensive, there's usually a line outside(whether its actually crowded inside yet or not), it takes forever to get a drink, and the typical patron is wearing an Armani t-shirt with a sparkly dragon on it, and you've successfully created my personal nightmare.  Two caveats: This is obviously a singles place, and I'm engaged. So the female talent that populates Hub 51 might make up for a lot of the negatives if I were single.

This is one of my fave happy hour spots, and that's prob where i will keep Hub in my repetoire.  Their nachos are the best thing on the menu, the sushi happy hour is fantastic, the Hub punch a favorite, the carrot cake to DIE FOR (and i dont even care for carrot cake really, its all the yummy cream they serve it with) and the atmosphere and service are always top notch.

We started with the Hummus app, which was a pleasant surprise; hummus with almond spice (and olive oil to dip) and a generous portion of pita points & bread. My coworker had the turkey chili and raved about it. I had the chicken tacos, which were good. It came with beans, rice, salsa and quac. Huge portion!  The homemade tortillas where the star. I love me some warm homemade tortillas. So, last but not least, we opted to go not with the famous carrot cake (thought it may be too heavy since we ate so much but went with the lemon meringue pie. We are so glad we did. It was a refreshing balance of cold, sweet, tart and fluff. Service was fine. Bathrooms are cool.

Unfortunately, some of us arrived late and apparently, they gave our table away. Furthermore, because Hub 51 has a policy that they will not seat the group until every one is there, our friends were left standing around at the bar for 30 minutes in an EMPTY RESTAURANT!!! Where is the logic here? This kind of service is simply unacceptable. If the restaurant is crowded, it's one thing, but when there are scores of tables available, and no other parties waiting we should have been seated. To make matters worse, our server wore a smirk on her face the entire time she was serving us. Policy dictates she was going to get her 18% tip - and she proceeded to give us dirty looks and semi-attitude throughout our dining experience. WTF. Needless to say, I'm never going back. Who cares what the food tastes like - my money is better spent elsewhere The HUB 51 crowd (appears to be): Folks looking for a trendy place to be seen and eat. They do have a half-price happy hour sushi deal between 3-6pm (but that just makes the prices more in line with regular sushi prices) Avoid HUB 51 if you are like me and: Don't want to put up with wait staff who don't take any pride in their job and policies that force patrons to stand around and stare at empty tables and chairs.

Overall, the place is just okay.  I think the space is well-decorated but the bathrooms in the basement and the number of tables makes for some difficult maneuvering.   It's just my opinion, but the menu is pretentious.  Any place that describes their tacos as ""deconstructed"" needs to get the cr*p kicked out of them. Seriously? Apparently Chi-Chi's has been on to something for years... The food was pretty good but I don't think it stands above any in the area and the prices are a bit too high for what you get.  Also, I thought the beer selection was boring and disappointing...but I know I'm more particular about good beer than most.",0.9022,0.829,0.117,0.055,0.5004135338345863

The food was amazing, hence the four stars. The brussel sprout salad danced on my tongue. The flavors harmoniously in step. Parmesan and dates, almonds, brussel sprouts and dried cranberries... all mixed to perfection in the most delicious light dressing. What was it? Tell me! I need to know! The guac was good. Pieces of grilled corn on the cob on the bottom. Personally, I prefer my guac to have slight more of a kick, but everyone raves about it..so I'll go with it.

Typically I start with the hummus which is wonderful, but I went around with the guacamole and chips, which turned out to be a great decision! Chips were lightly fried, salsa was spicy, and the guacamole was really good. I'm not a big fan of chunky guacamole and Hub 51's is a little creamier, which I like.  For my main dish I went with their Grilled Vegetarian ""Burger"". This veggieburger is made up of lentils, pintos, chilies, and shredded cheddar cheese. I opted out of the cheese. Unfortunately, the waitress said that the burger isn't vegan, but it's the best option for all vegetarians. I have to point out that the best part about a veggieburger is when it falls apart when you eat it. I love that! It feels like the chef just made the burger 20 minutes ago against a hard, frozen patty. Props for that! For my side I got the green salad with the ""Hub"" vinaigrette, light and flavorful. Better than getting heavy fries. Big fan of Hub 51. I love the music, atmosphere, and crowd. The service is attentive and helpful.

HUB51 opened over in the North Loop a little over a year ago and still remains a trendy atmosphere today, even if that's mostly at night.  During the day, it's a normal busy restaurant that turns to almost club-like proportions at night.   The menu is a hodgepodge variety of food, from salads to tacos.  It changes slowly and they're slowly getting it centered.  The guac is awesome with roasted corn at the bottom and comes out fresh.  The tacos are tasty and there's a variety to choose from. However, the Skinny is my go to choice.  A burger with a really thing, large patty, covered in creamy cheese with the sweetest of onions.  As odd as it sounds, this is a burger that tastes even better as a left over.  Not sure why, but it does.  Possibly because the Skinny is only that in appearance as it packed with flavor. For a place over in River North, sure, it's got the club crowd flocking to it, but that's just because it makes them look good.  HUB51 does do it's menu right and puts out some really good food.  It can get a little noisy at night, so hit it up during lunch.",0.955,0.883,0.102,0.015,0.5809193121693123

Why not start off with amazing dinner and drinks, then move downstairs to the swanky Sub51 to dance the night away with bottles of bubbly and good friends? Count me in! After a lovely dinner at Joe's last night, the girls and I stopped by for a couple cocktails at Hub for some good music and fun scenery. By fun scenery, I mean a mix of good looking people in their late twenties to mid thirties socializing and mingling. Then of course you'll get the River North meatheads, who, in their 40's with wedding rings on, still believe they've got the game to mack on young ladies out for the night. No sir. Of course it makes for a good laugh. Our server Manny was a doll and kept us laughing all night. This place is packed every day of the week, but most of the time I'd just prefer to snag a table in the cocktail lounge for prime people watching. The drinks are strong and they have Sofia Coppola which puts a gleaming smile on my face! As for the menu, there's a nice mix of items sure to please most of the growling stomaches out there. They've got sushi, sandwiches, tacos, jerky, salads, short ribs and a decent selection of fish.  I've been lucky enough to have tried a good majority of it. The sushi is pretty impressive as I was apprehensive when ordering. The Rainbow Roll was delish, as was the Spicy Crab Hand Roll. Their Hummus platter left something to be desired, but what can you expect from a Hummus platter? The Chicken Enchilada Stack was also superb (as I love Mexican food). Any place that can pull off Sushi and Mexican food under the same roof is ok in my book!  The Ahi Tuna Burger was notable and the Filet was cooked to perfection. Of course, all of this food was consumed on separate occasions, but amazing non the less.  On the weekends, be sure to check out Sub51, (if you can get in) and dance the night away to  awesome dj's.

It is normally crowded with fashionable, well-to-do types and one of those River North joints you commonly hear name-dropped by trendy and pretentious individuals. My particular experience just turned out to be a series of awkward moments and stale dessert.  I came in here to get some post-dinner drinks and dessert with my twin sis and beautiful Mom. After a few minutes of being seated, our waitress springs to our table with a bottle of champagne and tells us it is compliments of the table behind us. A little bashful and flattered, we turn around and see a group of portly, older males. Although we were a little flattered, this set an awkward tone for our dining experience especially after they toasted to ""three beautiful ladies!"" We snapped our heads back after mustering out a brief ""Thanks""  and tried not to make eye contact the rest of the night. I actually felt guilty drinking the champagne and it seemed they were watching us the whole time. It's not like we could have turned it down but since we never asked for it, we knew we didn't owe this group of males anything.  Onto dessert. We ordered a brownie, which was cold and hard. I would expect an apparently high caliber place like this to nail something as foolproof as a brownie. Bring on the warm, gooey, fudginess next time please.  I really think this place would be nice meet-up spot for cocktails, but unfortunately I think I stumbled in at an inopportune time when we were unlucky enough to catch the eyes of some older, unhealthy looking male tourists that must have wandered over from Rainforest Cafe.

I had the turkey meatloaf sandwich, which was a great concept -- modern comfort food on a winter day -- but the execution was mediocre. The meatloaf was dry and tasteless -- cardinal sins of meatloaf, and the sides were just ok. I had my standard Arnold Palmer as my lunch beverage of choice, and places that can't make a good Arnold Palmer piss me off as much as a place that can't make a proper martini. Note to Hub 51: It's iced tea AND lemonade. Half and half. Not 70-30. Not 60-40. Talkin' 'bout 50-50 tea and lemonade! Get a clue, folks.

Had a martini at the bar (no Stoli -- had to get Grey Goose) which was nice and met my friends for dinner. The chicken nacho appetizer was a lot of food and a step above the usual nachos one might get...I had the ahi tuna burger, which was quite good.

We called ahead to see if we could snag a table for 10. They reserved a fun party table for us at the long table at back of the bar area. The ladies ordered pitchers of the Hub 51 punch and the guys made selections from their large beer menu.

2010-02-01,4.0,"I've been into Hub 51 for lunch three times in the past month, and have liked this place more with each visit. At first it seemed like an upscale Applebees for trendy professionals, as the food is your typical American fare of burger, tacos, salads and sandwiches. But now that I've tried a number of menu items, I can say that the food is generally spot on, though the service (at least on weekends) could use work. Here's the rundown... - Arugula Caesar salad: A heaping plate of arugula with little else. Not exactly what I was expecting, but it's dressed well and actually pretty flavorful. Good for a light lunch. -Brussels sprout salad: They peel apart the sprouts so they come in slices rather than balls. Definitely more to it than the arugula. The mustard dressing is really tasty. -California roll: So not worth $11. They use crab mix when the price calls for chunks of crab. Not super fresh, either. I like the idea of being able to get sushi with burgers and tacos, but the execution indicates that sushi is best saved for places that specialize. -Ahi tuna burger: Fantastic. I dream about this thing. The avocado, mustard, lettuce and cheese goes perfectly with the tuna patty. Admittedly $16 is pretty steep for a burger, but I can find a way to justify this one. Plus, the seasoned fries are delicious. Just yum. -Veggie tacos: Spicer than I would have thought. They are served compartmentalized so you make them yourself. The peppers are way longer than the shells, which is weird, but they have a nice bold flavor. The rice and beans are good, albeit basic. Large portion. -New and improved egg sandwich: Really just a scrambled egg on toast. Still I like the idea of having what is essentially breakfast for lunch, with a side of fries. And I'm always a fan of things I can douse in ketchup. -Carrot cake: Supposedly delicious, although I never save room despite my dining companions' requests. Service during the week has been perfect. I imagine it has to be, given that this is prime business lunching for high powered professionals. The one time I went on a Saturday afternoon, however, my server was kind of surly and listless. She forgot my ketchup and kept wandering around the table, but not really stopping to check in with us. Really slow with taking our order and bringing the check.

Very, very friendly from the hostess to the servers.  l was wandering around looking for the bathroom and one of the employees practically escorted me to the ladies room.  When you have trendy places like this, I kind of expect to be treated dismissively, so this was a lovely surprise. I will be going back. Also, we had the private dining area which is perfect because you have your own bar, but you don't feel removed from the action of the main dining area.",0.9329,0.852,0.148,0.0,0.5807291666666667
2010-01-11,3.0,"Ok,so this is my first ever review for Yelp so bear with me. I went to HUB 51 last Saturday night with a group of friends to celebrate a couple of birthdays. - For appetizers,the table ordered guacamole,hummus,onion rings,crunchy tuna roll,and I ordered the turkey chili for myself. The turkey chili was delicious,but the portion could have been a bit bigger. The guacamole was served in a large stone mortar and was overflowing. It was not the best in the world but it was tasty. The hummus was serviceable,but was served with toasted bread instead of pita. I guess they were out? The onion rings were underdone and doughy. The crunchy tuna roll was good and they surprised us with two bowls of miso soup which was tasty. As for the main courses,most of the table ordered burgers and fries as they were recommened by the waitress. Two of us had the salmon which was described as having melted fennel and baby spinach. While cooked well,it could have used more seasoning,the melted fennel was overcooked and the baby spinach was almost non-existent. I was disappointed. I had to collect some fries from my friends to get enough to eat. I did taste a couple of the burgers and they were huge and delicious. The meat was juicy and they were perfectly cooked. The fries were really well-seasoned and yummy! I had to give only 3 stars because of the salmon and also we were seated next to a giant glass enclosure that must serve as the patio in the summertime. It was 18 degrees and we were freezing. Also,our waitress seemed to check out on us after she realized we weren't going to order a ton of drinks. Overall,I think it was just okay. If I go again,I'll skip the salmon,order a burger and get a table away from the window. -",0.9777,0.852,0.111,0.037,0.569047619047619
2010-01-01,1.0,"FYI: went to Hub51 for New Years Eve. Thought it was going to be awesome. I couldn't be more wrong. The problems started when we had to wait outside for over half an over before we were let in...even though everybody in line had paid over $100 for tickets (and the bar should have known how many tickets they sold). Then, the bar was understaffed. We're talking about 4 bartenders per 100 customers. Does that sound like a good ratio to you? We found an open space at the actual bar but that didn't help. It still took about 15-20 minutes to get a drink. The music was good...excecpt there was no room to dance. The food was good...from what we actually got. They stopped serving food at about 10:30 (thanks, considering the party didn't start until 9:30). Then...when 1:00 rolled around, they told us that it was a cash bar from 1:00 on. But here's the best part: HUB51 STOLE A HALF HOUR OF DRINKS FROM EVERY PERSON IN THE BAR. Online and on the tickets that we printed out said that the drinks ended at 1:30. I talked to a manager and all he did was offer me a free drink. And that's great and all, except they had promised EVERYONE who bought a ticket drinks untitl 1:30. I have the tickets still printed out. They say that the package goes from 9:00 to 1:30. I would like to know how they are going to explain that to the 1,000 people that were there.  Finally we had enough and were ready to leave. The girls got in line to get our coats while the guys waited for us (none of our guys brought coats). Us girls get our coats at the end of the night, and are IMMEDIATELY forced outside. It didn't matter that the rest of our party was still inside. They kicked us out. Thank God for cell phones.  All in all - I AM EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED IN HUB51. THEY LACKED EVERYTHING FROM PROPER PLANNING (how about scheduling more bartenders on the busiest night of the year?) TO A CHAMPAGNE TOAST AT MIDNIGHT (even though it was advertised, there was not a drop of champagne in the building).  PLEASE: READ THE FINE PRINT BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING AT THIS ""BAR"". THE SERVICE IS TERRIBLE AND ANY SPECIAL YOU THINK YOU GET MIGHT BE A LIE.i  Bottom line: I AM NEVER GOING HERE AGAIN. THEY TOTALLY SCREWED NOT ONLY MY GROUP, BUT EVERYBODY ELSE  I TALKED TO THERE.

2009-12-28,5.0,"We went to Hub 51's lower-level club on Saturday night for my BFF's birthday. The swanky ""scene""-y river north spot would not normally be my choice, and I'm not normally much for bottle service, but I really enjoyed this place!  The Environs: There's no denying that this is a basement...The decor was super dark with a few unique features, one being that the benches of the booths lifted up so you could stick your purse inside. Another feature was exposed pipes about 7 feet above the tops of the booth, creating a cat-walk/vertical pole-dance opportunity for the many 20-something ladies who packed the space. The DJ was really great. He played ""Off the Wall,"" which was amazing and a far less obvious/more awesome Michael Jackson choice.   The Service: Lovely, impossibly leggy waitresses greeted us, whisking a ginormous bottles of Grey Goose and Veuve Clicquot champagne high above their heads to our table, with appropriate pomp, circumstance and ""looky-here-at-the-VIPs-with-the-pricey-booze!"" Mixers included cranberry, Red Bull, tonic and more. Drinks were mixed for us at our booths with flair and good cheer. The girls were super friendly and nice! My husband, who is accustomed to working in jeans and sneakers, was impressed with their ability to work all night in tiny tight black dresses and super high heels (I'm sure that's not all that impressed him about them...) It was quite impressive how much bending and stretching they were able to do without accidentally exposing themselves. They brought us rounds of complimentary shots at least three times, and though they were super acidic and a bit rough going down, they got the job done.  The Crowd: If you enjoy being around very good looking girls in very little clothing...you should hang out at the Playboy Mansion...or Hub 51! Either one works...I personally was wearing snow boots and a sweater, as the weather dictated, though I seemed to be in the minority, as most girls were in tank tops or mini skirts. The guys were nothing to look at, so you'd THINK they were at least really rich, but the only guy my friend spoke to there was a butcher counter worker at Jewel from the suburbs with 2 kids.... Overall, I really enjoyed the party! It was the perfect atmosphere for a birthday party. I was feeling tired from the holidays and not in the mood to party when I arrived, but within 15 minutes, I was really enjoying myself!",0.9995,0.653,0.326,0.021,0.5681278344671201

I found myself going back for seconds and shamefully sometimes thirds b/c the food just kept on coming! They brought out second helpings of the sushi rolls and the sea bass. They definitly were not stingy on the portions which our motley crue truly appreciated. Warm brownie & carrot cake ended the meal. The carrot cake was amazing! Mmm...so good.

I'm giving Sub51 5 stars because it literally saved a hopeless night.  I know it sounds like an exaggeration but picture this: mid-October, 50 degrees, pouring rain, thursday night... and you have visitors from sunny California visiting Chicago for the first time.   Prior to hitting up Sub51, I attempted to show these out-of-towners that Chicagoans know how to have a good time.  I thought I could bring them to the obvious joints... not that night.  What's worse?  They were 8 guys and I was the only girl (since Chicago girls rarely go out when it's pouring rain out).  Everywhere we went before landing at Hub 51 was completely empty or a dude-fest. No bueno. As we were entering, I mentioned it was a good sign that a group of 3 girls just went in.  I was right.  Upon entering, I realized it was a good ratio of male:female - and since it was around 11pm, most of the patrons were around the bar area.  There was enough eye-candy there to distract the boys for a good 45 minutes before we realized the bar had started to filter out.  That's when I went downstairs to go to the bathroom,walked past Sub51, and realized that's where everyone had filtered into.  There's another door person (which makes no sense since you get ID'd to get into Hub51...?). Once we entered this 1-room club/lounge, I finally saw some life in the eyes of the boys.  Why?  Because it was packed full of people - attractive 20-somethings (and early 30 somethings) including girls who clearly did not take the weather into consideration in choosing their outfits for the night.  Yay! Prices are the usual downtown Chicago prices.  They have bottle service too (which I thought was odd considering how small the lounge is).  The music was hip-hop/pop-40's.  The sound system was good.

Seems brunch is definitely now on their menu on weekends and please go try that french toast it is something melt-in-your-mouth delicious. After the shower, there was still plenty of game left so we headed over to the bar and Jay mixed us up some more delicious Bellini's and Dirty Martini's!

I don't want to completely hate because it's in a toursit-y area chalk-full of unimpressive places - but there's not a lot going on here, and I say that after visiting three different times with three different groups.  As a happy hour spot, I'll go back again. Decent beer selection. And there's always been quick seatin accompanies by  pretty good service.  But I've found the appetizers overpriced and bland.

2009-10-05,4.0,"Another Monday night at Hub 51 and I'm feeling overwhelmed with the vast array of menu options...sushi? two-handed sandwich? tacos? That's the great thing about this menu, there really is something for everyone. My friend highly recommends the brussel sprout salad and as soon as I see the list of ingredients (dates, almonds and the divine Manchego cheese) I can't refuse. This is healthy goodness with a twist - I was expecting chopped brussel sprouts but the ingenious nature of this salad is that the leaves of the little sprouts ARE the salad. Cool, huh? Well if you're a b.sprout fan like me its a must try! I also opted for the 3 Green Bites appetizer and would highly recommend it as a good sharing option for 2-4 people. Again a little something for all palettes - with edamame, tempura green beans and hot peppers. After my ""light"" green fare my friend agreed to split a decadent desert with me. Grandma Bee's chocolate pie had a graham cracker crust, rich chocolate filling and it's offered as an option, but I say its a must, to get the s'mores style marshmallows on top. Ooh, such a sweet finish. I love the Melman boys playful menu and the whole vibe that they've comfortably established at Hub 51.

2009-09-30,1.0,"let me just get to the point with this review right away. WILL NEVER GO BACK TO HUB 51 EVER AGAIN!  My boyfriend made reservations for 8:15 for dinner and drinks for him and I because it was my birthday. Just wanted to check out the place cause I had heard mixed reviews. Figured we'd try something new. We got there at 8:15 promptly and we got sat within 5 seconds....wonderful! and we even got a cute booth amongst all the crowded tables. Was very happy with that! So a guy came by said hello gave us our water and we thought he was our server, unfortunately he wasnt. about 2 minutes later a young girl about 24ish came to the table. ""what can i get you to drink"" she says with an attitude and a smirk. I was really offended, but just brushed it off. Said I needed a minute and once again she smirked at me.....ok 2nd time i brushed it off. maybe she was having a bad night. she came back and my boyfriend and i ordered a beer and i had the hub punch. she carded us and my boyfriend just said well let the birthday girl go first, kinda just to say to her, you know we're here for a special occasion. she didnt flinch didnt make conversation and say oh btw happy birthday. (i wasnt asking for a song and dance just for her to acknowledge the simple fact) . she checked our ID's and now for the 3rd time smirked @ myself and my boyfriend and walked away. now, my boyfriend and I both have served table for years and he still does, we have NEVER in our lives gone out to eat and had someone make our jaws drop and wonder what in the world we did to upset the waitress. we literally sat there debating on just leaving. and we've never done that. so our drinks came and we ordered sushi for an app. she put some app plates on the table and some orange sauce and walked away. didnt say a word about what the sauce was. my boyfriend was especially pissed about that cause he doesnt eat sushi. sushi came, it was fast and good. she never asked us how it was or anything. we ordered dinner, him the fish tacos and me the salmon. she didnt say thank you, she once again, yep you guessed it!! smirked and just walked away! so now my boyfriend and i have empty drinks. i can see her walking around the restaurant dropping stuff breaking it, didnt look busy at all. so the same guy that dropped off our waters came by, and asked if we wanted more drinks, we said yea and we had been waiting for our server, who was apparently TOO busy roaming around the restaurant doing nothing, to come back cause we wanted to order shots before the food came. at that point my boyfriend asked to talk to a manager. manager came over we told him what was up and we asked for a new server, which we did not get. we told him we felt like we were intruding and obviously asking to much from our waitress just to be served!!! she came back with our drinks we ordered from the other waiter and in the most monotone voice said ""i'm sorry guys"" cause obviously she was just forced to say that. gave us our drinks and our food came. he loved his fish tacos but my salmon was ok. at this point i wasnt even hungry because i was so upset at how we were treated by our waitress. finished what i could and pushed my plate to the side, she came over asked if i was done said i was full and she once again in the most computer generated monotone voice spited out ""was this food not what you thought it would be"" i almost said yes but just to get her out of my face i just said i was full. she asked if we wanted dessert and we declined said we were full but we really just wanted to get the hell out of there. she turned to walk away and my boyfriend caught her roll her eyes at us! wonderful!! she came back with the check and once again in her wonderful smirk she said well since you didnt want dessert we bought your shots, have a wonderful birthday (and this time she was just being rude) so we paid, tipped 20% and left. so wish i could tell you her name, but she never told us. basically we had the most rude and condescending waitress in our lives! the thing that really urks me is that we would have stayed for at least 3-4 more rounds of drinks had dessert and tipped 30% if she wouldnt have been so rude. so thanks hub 51 and our wonderful waitress for making our first and last experience so horrible and i really appreciate the fact that my birthday dinner sucked cause she was in a bad mood. will never go there EVER again. and that waitress should try a different job route cause she's obviously not a people person.",0.8136,0.845,0.08,0.074,0.4565678102991536

When we arrived the restaurant was packed, but easily made our way downstairs to the club. On our way down, we were asked multiple times if we were on a list to get into Sub 51 and we said yes we were. The bouncers gave us tons of trouble and all kept exclaiming that we were not on any list, but finally let us into this club. To my amazement, the place was COMPLETELY EMPTY except for two other women. FYI Sub 51 bouncers this is not some hot LA club, but rather a concrete room in the basement of a restaurant., so lay off the integration of letting people into your club -especially when it is empty!

The DJ was ok, as the night went on, the music got better, but it took quite some time.

I had no cravings other then somewhere we could sit immediately and have some options. We got to Hub 51 and were immediately seated in the middle of a packed floor. The space is low lit, LOUD, and filled with 20-30 somethings. A cute corn-fed midwestern gal quickly took our order and had the beers come ""in a jiffy.""  The menu is diverse, a Mexican section, a burger/sandwich section, and then a nicer entree (chicken/fish/steaks) section. I went with a burger cause I couldn't really think and I saw one go by that looked good. Def a two-hander, that I needed to cut in half to really get a hold on. Cooked to a perfect medium with a pink center and loaded with lettuce, tom, onion, pickles, and condi's. Good crisp well done fries with lots of spices. 1 burger, 2 beers and tip ran me $25, not sure how that ranks in Chicago, but I def think you are paying a bit more for the trendy happening scene. Oh the music was of the crappy radio popular hip-hop variety, and it was loud.  I noticed an area in the back with tons of people standing around and boozing. My buddy told me lots of places in Chicago offer deals on sepreate areas where if you can guarantee 20+ people will pay $30 a head you can have an open bar (sans top shelf) for anywhere between 2-4 hrs.

2009-09-07,4.0,"When I think of Hub 51, I think of amazing food period! My boyfriend and I went here for a late Friday Night Dinner, I had been to Hub 51 twice for lunch right when it opened but I heard it had a great night atmosphere so I figured I would try it.  To start off with, we arrived at 9:30pm, got a drink at the bar (I got the Hub 51 punch which was really good!) and then we were seated pretty fast which was surprising and nice considering how busy they were. The bar area was rather crowded and it definitely had a certain feel, hard to explain but definitely a wealthy crowd.  We sat down and decided to go for more appetizers rather than getting meals. We started with their Spicy Shrimp & King Crab Roll which was absolutely delicious. It is served with soy sauce (of course) and then their spicy mayo sauce which of course is not healthy but was sooo good! After we finished with that we moved on to the Dry-Rubbed Ribs, there were four of them, it had a weird smell (I couldn't think of what herb it was that was throwing me off) but it still tasted good. They served crushed peanuts on the side which I felt was odd, I would understand it if the ribs were wet with BBQ sauce but since they were dry-rubbed seemed a little off. Oh well, we then moved on to my favorite, the pulled chicken nachos. They were HUGE for an appetizer but absolutely delicious. We were stuffed by this time, but it was so good, I can not wait to come back and try more.  For drinks, we shared a pitcher of Shandygraff, which is beer & lemonade. That is how they serve it in Germany at all of the beer gardens. While the drink was good, it did not even compare to Germany's, but you can only expect so much. If I didn't know the difference I would have thought it was great.  I also want to take a minute to talk about the decor, I really like what they have done with this place. The two Melman sons (Rich Melman is the founder of Lettuce Entertain You) are the owners/creators and they have really made this place perfect for their target group, the 20-30 year olds. I love the dark wood interior and and the bar is very well done in the middle with alcohol shelf's hanging over head.

2009-08-07,5.0,"Last night, my friend and I encountered some of the best customer service I have ever experienced! We left a birthday party at another nearby lounge, and we were hungry for tacos. We stopped and asked the bouncers outside Hub 51 where the closest taco place was. Unfortunately, the nearest place was 8 or more blocks away, and we weren't ready to make that long of a trek in heels. We followed the bouncer inside to look at a menu--they didn't have any tacos, and the menu items were more expensive than what we were looking to spend. While we were looking at the menu, the bouncer went and talked to the owner, who agreed to allow us to special order tacos! We decided to stay, and sat down in the big, fancy dining area. The waiters and waitresses were very friendly, even though we didn't order drinks or appetizers or anything besides the tacos. They continually checked up on us and refilled our water glasses and treated us so well, even though we were the weird girls who special ordered tacos! And the food was DELICIOUS! The tortillas seemed hand made. I'm a vegetarian, and they made me roasted corn, tomatoes, and asparagus to go inside my tacos. It also came with black beans, rice, guacamole and salsa--all of which was crazy-delicious! I had such a great experience! Even though I was only looking to spend 5 dollars on greasy taqueria food, I didn't mind the extra expense for such outstanding service and such delicious food. I would definitely go back to Hub 51!!!",0.991,0.796,0.168,0.035,0.5270266439909297
2009-08-03,4.0,"I came to Hub 51 twice in one day and this review will be a tale of two restaurants. Restaurant One:  I came in for a lunch meeting and thought this was a cute little place.  Our service was super duper slow, but the food was good.  I'm a huge fan of a 5 million calorie salad so the chopped salad with turkey was perfect for me.  It had two types of dressing, big chunks of cheese, and yummy strips of turkey.  I also tried my co-worker's fish tacos and they were good.  If you're watching your carbs you can get the tacos with lettuce cups instead of tortillas.  Also, our table shared their special sushi roll of the day and we all thought it was phenominal.  It was a decent lunch, except for some painfully slow service.  Restaurant Two:  I came back after a drinkfest at Rossi's becasue homegirl needed to eat!!  Also, I had been thinking about that sushi roll and wanted some more of it.  My friend and I ordered three rolls and devoured them!  Also, we got a pitcher of Matilda, which I paid dearly for the next morning.  I was finally able to try the carrot cake that everyone was raving about and it was really good.   The service was much much better at night than during the afternoon.  The vibe was different too.  It was more of a cocktail lounge at night, while the afternoon was more of a business vibe.

We ordered the Hub Punch pitcher for the two of us and the Guacamole to start. The punch is unbelieable and I highly recommend you try it. The guacamole was perfect. A little tangy and a little salty with corn salsa mixed in. It was perfect. For our entres, I ordered the hamburger with fries and my friend had some sushi roll. She was extrmemly happy with the roll which was $12 and my hamburger was perfect with grilled onions. The fries were extra crispy and spiced perfectly.

We managed to belly up to the bar and listen to the music for one drink - well that was until we saw the most beautiful man ever and had to talk to him - this might be the only reason I'd go back.  Also, I'm surprised there aren't any reviews for Sub 51. Sub 51 is downstairs near the bathrooms and that's the only reason I know its there. It's some kind of club - maybe I will go back for that too next time.",0.9887,0.816,0.163,0.022,0.5032921810699589

Each time I hope it will get better. It doesn't. It gets worse.  Visit one. We have reservations. We sit down. They rush us to order, and our appetizers and entry actually come out at the SAME EXACT TIME. Bad form.  Visit two. They (the wait staff) spill a glass of red wine on my friend's white coat. Rather than offer to pay for the coat (which is ruined) or comp our wine which was spilled on the coat or our dinner, they tell my friend she actually needs to COME BACK IN even though it is nowhere by her work or home and drop off her dry cleaning receipt, which they will reimburses her for (the dry cleaning not her coat). We try to explain that the red wine is not coming off her white wool coat, and they say that we can deal with that when the time comes. SERIOUSLY!?!?  Visit Three: We come for dinner. I am hoping things have improved. They sit us at a table behind the bar, which s fine, until they open up that side of the bar for patrons to stand and drink at. Our table is getting bumped every two seconds by the drunk bar people or even worse, by the wait staff who act as if it is our table that is in their way, not the drunk bar people. The drunk bar people even start to use our DINNER table as a resting place for their drinks, cell phones and purses WHILE WE EAT. When I mention this to the hostess, she looks at me like I am the problem, and says, Well, there is a rope divider up, what else can we do? GRRRRRRRRRRRR.  Richard Melman should be ASHAMED that his sons run a business this way. I literally think it is worse service than a fricking McDonald's or taco bell. NEVER GO HERE.

We weren't doing any of the silly bach stuff with decorations and boas, but rather wanted to dress up and go dancing for a night w/o any of that attention. All my friends flew in from all over California to enjoy a fun weekend. None of us had been dancing in a long time nor had we all seen each other in a year since i moved to chicago. I was pumped to reserve 2 tables and bottles at each and have room to dance and have a great time.  We got in and were instantly excited. The music was PERFECT the room amazing. we grabbed what we thought was our 2 tables only to discover they gave one away. even after my friend reserved them 2 months ago. Whatever, we moved on and still enjoyed ourselves. We got champagne as a nice token for the lack of the extra table. As the night went on it got a little more hot in the room and crowded. My friend decided to go take her tights off in the bathroom so she could cool off. She comes out and starts dancing again, mind you none of us got wasted. All of a sudden a bouncer comes over and takes my friend away. When my other friend went to find out what happened she came back and said my other friend got kicked out for doing drugs! My friend doesn't even smoke cigarettes let alone do drugs. what an accusation!!!! but because she was the last one in the bathroom she was the one blamed. What an awesome way to ruin the night. we all got up and left as a result. Not to mention the nice gesture they gave us for the champagne was added to the service fee! So disappointed. I gave it 2 stars because for what it was worth, the music was good and before the drama we had a decent time dancing.

2009-03-16,3.0,"Hub 51 is a busy, pretty popular restaurant with what seemed to be an even more lively bar. Was with a few friends and wanted to try a sample of what they had to offer so we went with mostly appetizers: Pulled Chicken Nachos: Not too bad. The mixture of white cheddar / oaxaca was really a plus, but the distribution felt off, with some bites having no cheese and others having way too much. Guac was tasty but was more runny then I would have liked (bring on the avocado chunks). Cornbread - this is more of a savory cornbread while I'm more of a fan of sweet. Good, not great. Ceviche - Again, good but not exceptional Spicy Shrimp / King Crab Roll: Really had high hopes for this one, especially at $13. Unfortunately, it wasn't that spicy and for the price it felt WAY too small. It's served with a creamy sauce on the side (a great addition) but I don't understand why they didn't just use some kitchen judgment and apply it on the rolls themselves.  Sweet Potato Roll - This was better and for some reason spicier then the supposedly spicy roll, but for $9 it should have been epic. It wasn't. Entree: Cheeseburger. It wasn't bad, but it failed to live up to its description as ""first rate"". White Cheddar again was the best part, and it was well cooked, with kudos to the kitchen for a nice medium-rare, but the bottom bun broke apart due to sogginess. BURGERFAIL. I subbed onion rings in for fries. Now, I didn't want onion rings...I wanted to sub in macaroni and cheese. Waiter informed me that any side can replace fries for the $ difference EXCEPT Mac and Cheese. Why the hell not? That makes no sense. Went with the onion rings and was glad that I did; they were perfectly crunchy and very good. Mac and Cheese ended up being subpar. Overall, the problem with Hub 51 is simply that in most cases, it's not anything more then a sum of its parts. Ceviche tastes like seafood, juice, lime. Sushi rolls feel like a few pieces of fish waiting for some inspiration. Burger lacks any knockout flavor.  I'd definitely go back for the bar, the crowd seems lively and fun.  I'm a big fan of LEY Restaurants, and checked this one out ahead of time and noticed the 3.5 and was hoping to bump them up to a four. If the kitchen is open late after some drinks, you could do worse for a late night meal and maybe the combo is worth a 4 but it's no more then a 3/5 for dinner alone.",0.9932,0.711,0.188,0.101,0.5012510822510824

I had a craving for the peekytoe crab nachos here and called my girlfriend who has had a great experience at this place and she was willing to join me. Her food was also really good...well at least her mashed tators where. We had good wine and good conversation but because we weren't spending a lot I feel like she was disappointed with our table.  We didn't order a couple of bottles of wine and three courses. Sorry what can I say...recession seems like it would fit here. And while I know they get some spenders and the after work crowd don't judge all of us like that. Also don't sit me at a 4 top when there are only 2 of us if that bothers you.  Despite this I know I'll be back. I love those little peekytoe pieces and the salty chips. Maybe I'll eat at the bar so I don't take up so much space.,0.9725,0.74,0.179,0.081,0.5725

The waiter was really awesome the entire night and was really patient with my group of my loud, chatty friends. (5 stars) 3. The menu looks as though it hasn't changed since the restaurant opened. Meaning that food never changes with the seasons. This harkens to bar food more than restaurant food. Mac and Cheese was still on the menu, even though they've long since decided not to offer the dish. Dude, just print off new menus. (2 stars) 4. No cocktail list. I love restaurants for their interesting take on alcoholic beverages, but alas, nothing but the Hub Punch, which didn't have much punch to it. (2 stars) 5. I had the waiter choose some appetizers for the table. He chose the Ahi Poke and the Nachos. Ahi Poke was above average. However, deconstructed sushi is hard to eat. Nachos were woefully bland. (2 stars) 6. I had the waiter choose my entree and side as well. He recommended the Chilean Sea Bass. Well cooked, but very boring dish. Nothing that I couldn't have done by myself at home. Not worth the 24 dollars. Parmesan potatoes on the side were really tasty. (3 stars) 7. I had to get the carrot cake as per a recommendation, and even though I don't particularly like carrot cake, this one was awesome. Came with mascarpone and whipped cream on the side. Nice pairings with the dish. (5 stars) 8. Design of the restaurant was very nice. But I sat by the glass garage doors. While they allowed a nice few of the sidewalk.

Not stellar, but decent. The menu is full of hokey little flourishes and silliness that can found at a few other LEYE restaurants.

Especially considering I had two decent glasses of wine, wolfed down [every last bite of] my food and greatly enjoyed the company of my two dining companions. But I can't...bring myself to give it any more than that either. Can I? Hub 51 has a massive identity crisis. Part of it obviously wants to be a club, attract the attractive downtown demographic that isn't put off by loud music and bathroom attendants -- I am not of that demographic, by the way. Two stars. But another part wants to be a dining destination. Overall, it's a lovely space that carries off whatever it's trying to be with a touch of smooth, dark-wood-covered class. Three stars. Crap. The menu is as schizophrenic as they come. Make up your mind, Hub. Do you want to be a sushi place or serve tacos? Throw in some burgers, too? Sure, why not. You CAN'T be all things to all people. Two stars. That said: One appetizer did the genre mixing very well, a trio of greens that included tempura green beans, steamed edamame and blistered peppers with a chipotle dipping sauce. Bah. Three stars. And my friends enjoyed their sushi. And my burger was passable, though the top slice of Jarlsberg hadn't even begun to melt by the time I finished it. Which was more than a little gross. One star. Hell! The staff is as confused as the menu, especially where their attitudes are concerned: The bartender wanted to be brusque and pushy (totally zero stars if I could), but our server wanted to be sweet and attentive (four stars). Luckily, I spent much more time with our server; the bartender gave me my can of champagne (yes, really. Thanks, Sofia Coppola) and was done with me. Don't spend that $1 tip in one place, lady. Oh, fine. I guess it wasn't two stars bad. I'll give it three, but only because I couldn't really make up my mind.",0.979,0.849,0.116,0.035,0.5480994152046783

That being said I have to say there were a lot of things I really liked about this place and a few that just kind of were a buzz kill.  Sad but true. The appetizers were fantastic, although the potato debris or what ever it was called could've used a little something more, I did enjoy the saltiness and the rosemary, both of which happen to be two of my favorite things.  Kung Fu Girl Reisling, nice value, decent wine.  My braised short ribs were absolutely divine.  Worth every penny and would have ordered a double order and happily paid the price.  The mashed potatoes that came with it however were a big disappointment and mashed potatoes are sacred to me.  And very hard to mess up.  These just didn't cut it and for that I'm gravely disappointed because its such an easy thing.  I couldn't put my finger on it but they were pretty bland.  I left them on my plate with a sad face.  The server didn't really have an answer for me but thats neither here nor there.  It wasn't her fault.  I skipped the desserts but they looked awesome.  It is incredibly  LOUD in there.  And I used to run nightclubs so I'm all about loud music.  Just not blaring when I am trying to have a conversation.  And really, on the menu they  have the audacity to state  ""music is the level we like it at-ear plugs available upon request"" or some other snotty little comment along those lines.  From the Melman's? Really?  You're that fabulous that you can essentially insult your guests before they even order?  Wow.  I missed that class in Customer Service 101. I did have fun leading random customers whom I did not know on the adventure that was the trek to the bathroom, down the barely lit hall.  Again, I am all about lighting but when I had to help an elderly guest down the second part of the stairs because she couldn't see....seems a little silly not to brighten it up a tad, for safety's sake.

The bar carries Delirium.  Beware of the price tag.  Ouch. So what was the other thing that got my attention, besides my lovely dining companions?  The ice cream bar dessert.  Its size was more than big enough to feed a few drooling diners.  A crunchy, chocolaty outside surrounded a creamy, frozen slab of ice cream would certainly satisfy even the biggest sugar junkie's craving.      I'd be inclined to visit again, though next time just for drinks and/or dessert.",0.9183,0.887,0.084,0.029,0.5317757936507936

First, I was impressed with how well the servers handled our group of approximately 13 ladies.  Our glasses kept full of delicious libations like pomegranate and dirty vodka martinis, vino and of course, the infamous Hub Punch, which, after sampling it, I'm convinced is just vodka and tequila with a splash of food coloring.  Our meals were served promptly and we were checked on very frequently. My section of the table ordered the crab meat nachos, which were, in a word, awesome.  Hub 51 doesn't skimp on the fresh crab meat, and they piled that plate high with cheese, tomatillo salsa, jalapeños and guacamole.  Simple, fresh and delicious. I had been fantasizing about ordering ""The Dude,"" which is a bone-in, parmesan crusted rib-eye steak served with sautéed mushrooms and a side of cheesy mashed potatoes since I saw it on the menu about a week ago.  Is your mouth watering yet?  It should be, because it was arguably one of the better steaks I've had in recent memory.  I split it with a friend, who summed things up with this statement: ""Angie, if I was here with my family and not a group of friends, I would pick up the bone and pick it clean.""  You don't get much better than that.  We also ordered the fish tacos and a salmon sushi roll to share.  I fully enjoyed everything on our plates, but I did hear some gripes from the other end of the table that the food was just okay.  Personally, I think they're jealous that they didn't order The Dude. All in all, a great dining experience.  I would certainly come back for dinner, but I actually kind of want to come for after work drinks and maybe an appetizer with friends.  Sure, the bar area was like a Chad explosion, but sometimes you want some cute, yuppiesh guys to flirt with you and buy you drinks.  I think Hub 51 could fit that bill perfectly.",0.9917,0.799,0.168,0.033,0.6286017740429505

Wrath or not, no man can't keep a good crew down and we set out into the night, stilettos ablaze for our eagerly anticipated group dinner. Impressively, the Hub crew was on top of their game and ready to accommodate. With two long, high-top tables (that we actually pushed together) beautifully set near the window for us, we were ready to rock.  A quick glance around the large chic Hub space told me this is a spot where the young, upwardly mobile go to practice their mating calls.

Take your boss or clients here and be prepared to swiftly stick feather in cap.  This packed, hip spot is where everyone is clamoring for the latest in dressed up casual cuisine. Think chicken strips in a prom dress or mac 'n cheese in a fedora. Seriously though, the trend is popping up left and right these days; unpretentious food served in a classy locale (with the classy prices to match) and shiny, happy faces serving you. The food was certainly approachable... chicken nachos, potato discs served with ketchup, a few tame maki rolls, fish tacos and steak all in plentiful quantity and OK taste. Unfortunately nothing wowed my socks off... the nachos were greasy with zero kick or spicy element, the potato 'debris' were uninspired and boring, the sushi was bland and my filet mignon tacos with accompanying rice/beans/salsa/gauc while very tasty were lukewarm aside dry tortillas. Harumph. Well, I can't say it was all meh... my few bites of Angie M.'s 'the dude' parmesan crusted ribeye and cheese mashed taters was ahhhmazing!!! Next time upsell me on that Hub, it's worth the upcharge. The desserts were also sinful deliciousness... the carrot cake was the fluffiest cloud of love I've ever taken a joy ride on and my hand-dipped ice cream bar was sick. In a good way, of course.   If casual, playful food in trendfabulous surroundings is what you want, head to Graham Elliot to sample flawless execution.

Looking over the menu it was really hard to pick something to eat everything sounded good. I finally decided on the turkey meatloaf sandwich, I don't have meatloaf very often and don't think I have ever had one made with turkey or in sandwich form. The food came out super quick. We ordered an appetizer of guacamole and barely had time to eat any of it. Speaking of the guacamole it was down right tasty. It featured a lot of corn which is a plus - corn is always a welcome addition to most things. Now my turkey meatloaf sandwich was sitting in front of me and I dived right in. It was great! But... it was less meatloaf and more square turkey burger to me. That didn't stop me from eating the whole thing and finishing all of my fries.

We were seated immediately inside the large, warehouse-like room.  Our waitress came over within seconds and made us feel at home right away by explaining the entire menu.   Hub 51 has all types of cuisines so we wanted to make sure we made the most of the experience right off the bat.  We began with an appetizer of the guacamole and their signature sushi roll.  The guacamole was awesome and came with roasted corn on the bottom.  The corn added a smoky flavor the the guacamole, which was also served with roasted tomato salsa and very thin tortilla chips.  The sushi roll we chose was called Miso Salmon, and came eight to an order.  Each piece of sushi came topped with a cooked piece of salmon, marinated in miso, and wrapped around a huge chunk of avocado.  Very unique and very good.  This was the first piece of sushi I have ever had that was actually cooked and not raw. For entrees, my sister had the Sake Salmon and I decided on the Grilled Amish Chicken.  The salmon was super moist and cooked to perfection.  It came with melted fennel and was presented very nicely.  The chicken was average, but I didn't expect that much in the first place.  The chicken came with a huge side of roasted corn and tomato succotash. Desserts are simple, and unlike everyone else who has reviewed Hub 51, we didn't order the carrot cake.  We figured the Warm Brownie Skillet with a side of ice cream would be a good ending.  The brownie was OK at best and resembled something a beginning baker would be able to make.  Should've listened to everyone else's advice. Overall, Hub 51 is a great new place to try and is definitely a place to see and be seen.  The bar was packed when we left and I think there was even a small wait.

It is very open and just has a nice decor in there--dark and open, trendy, etc. (Except there was a art piece I wasn't crazy for.) The best part about the restaurant was the bathrooms... totally cool with the contemporary sink and stalls. Yes, I judge a place by its bathrooms. I would have to say that the ambiance and decor was what impressed me most about this place. Hub 51 definitely is one of those places that is now ""in"" where people are there to see and be seen. There is some great people watching to be done there. And, I went there pretty early in the night so I can only imagine it gets better as the night gets later and people get drunker... I also saw the Sub 51 bar downstairs that looks like it could get fun in the wee hours of the night... Now let's talk food: Their menu is all over the board--from sushi to burgers to tacos. I think their food is nothing spectacular. One thing that was impressive was the chicken nachos. The tortilla chips were homemade and delicious! One only complaint is that it gets kind of soggy if it sits for awhile. And I feel there was a weird kind of cheese at the bottom... not so sure about that! Also tried the fish tacos, those were A-OK! Not the best fish tacos I have had, (Oh, how I wish MAS was still here!) but still pretty tasty! We also got a Cobb salad, which was good, but how can you go wrong on that? And then, of course I like to try fries almost everywhere I go and the ""hand cut"" really got my attention so we ordered a side order. What a rip off! The plate was almost the size of a bread plate. Granted, it was cheap, only $4 but still... potatoes are like the cheapest thing ever... at least give a real portion! Tried the Hub Punch, which was very much a tasty delight! Not even sure what was in there... maybe vodka, juice, tequila. Whatever it is, it is worth getting!

Your drinks will rarely fall below the halfway point without someone asking if you'd like a refill. Food was pretty delish, but what's up with not having the boneless crispy chicken the past 2 times I've been here? If it's on the menu, it better be in the kitchen. We were here for dinner at 6pm, so it's not like the kitchen ran out of the dish (or they very well shouldn't have). The table shared the hummus and chicken nacho apps - both very very good. The hummus plate came with plenty of bread for everyone, but there could have been more chicken with the chicken nachos. I dined on the Charred Sake Salmon which was very well designed and the portion was just the right size. The 2 members of our party who wanted the crispy chicken kept raving about the summer substitute of the grilled chicken breast, grilled corn, and mashed potatoes, too. Desserts were great. The Snickers/Butterfinger vanilla ice cream bars are too die for, but share with a friend otherwise you will have to be rolled out of the place. On the other hand, the butterscotch pudding is served in a tiny tiny cup... not enough for the $6 price. Overall, the atmosphere was good, but towards the end of our meal as the place filled and the music was turned up, it got too loud and we couldn't hear each other across the table. Decor is very clean and inviting, but tables are cramped and there is no way not to bump other diners' chairs as you are trying to leave... which is pretty annoying if you're one of those seated on the narrow paths out. The private party / bar area in the back of the restaurant looks like a good place to spend an evening with friends, and is semi-secluded without feeling closed off from the general atmosphere.

We got seated, and our server-I don't remember her name, was really good.

My friend liked the fish from her fish taco plate, but I think presen tation wise, it was too overwhelming.  It was heaps and mounds everywhere.  For my turkey meatloaf, it was ok.  It was soft... I don't know how to quite describe it..but it was like it was kind of wet almost. Not the moist wet way, but too wet kind of way.  The fries weren't crunchy, but kind of soggy and SLATHERED in this spice/salt mixture.  It was a little too much.  I kind of wish I knew about it so that I could have it on the side, or 1/2 and 1/2 regular. Overall, I think I would go for the bar- if I were going to meet people for drinks, but from the look of the menu, it looks like it is kind of all over the place.

For an entree I had the pulled pork tacos - they were delicious.  I loved the corn tortillas, the pieces of corn really made it.  The pork was well seasoned and I love that it comes with more guac and also rice and beans, which were surprisingly good.

Beware before you go- its going to be loud and crowded- I wouldn't call this a date spot- rather, somewhere to go for a night out with a group of friends I didn't really know what to expect from the food because I just hadn't checked out all 27 reviews that have collected since it opened (wow that got popular quickly, but I suppose that's no suprise between the owner, location, and atmosphere).  We ordered the guacamole, which everyone else at the table seemed really impressed with (I didn't like the sweet factor, but it still tasted fresh and of good quality).  My bf and I split a California Roll (I don't normally love crab based sushi, but this was very good) .  Three out of  four of us got some form of tacos- as others have mentioned, plates were enormous (these were definitely platter-sized, and I only managed to cram down about 1/3 of the plate (I can blame that partially on the sushi and guac though).  Everyone really loved what they had.  I mean, just really, really good.   The owner stopped by a couple times, but I think that's because two out of four went to school with him at some point.  This will show my complete ignorance of the Chicago dining royalty, but  I think it was his dad who also stopped by (apparently he's interested in making sure the boys live up to the family standards :)) Its nice to see people taking enough pride and care of their business to watch over their customers. I've been back twice since that first visit.  The second time was with a large group at around 5:30 on a Sunday.  It was not too crowded.  My side of the table stole bites from the carrot cake ordered by one of us- very very good, served with a side of extra frosting (I LOVE YOU).   Third visit was a Wednesday around the same time.  This time VERY crowded with a post-work bunch.  Didn't have to wait for a table (the bar was more crowded when we got there, but the dining room filled up shortly thereafter) The moral- unless you're there for the ""early bird"" time Sunday, expect a lot of people. I was a little miffed about the wait for the table on that first night (people were just NOT getting up and leaving though- this definitely has a sceney vibe), but this is a great addition to an area that's overrun with restaurants, and yet I always feel at a loss for where I really feel like going when eating in River Norh.  This will absolutely be in my rotation.",0.9949,0.785,0.15,0.065,0.5316163548752835

The amount of recent reviews of this place made me want it bad, and their bipolar menu piqued my interest. We started with appetizers of their much raved Guacamole and the Hummus. OMG, you get a gigantic serving of one of the best guac's this side of the Mississippi. Plus it has this added touch of corn in it, which adds more than you would think, and while your tastebuds celebrate over this delightful dip, you may miss the AHmazing salsa located on the plate which is almost as good as the guac. The hummus was pretty good but nothing spectacular, I would have liked some more kick to it. For entree I got the chicken tacos with lettuce cups (low carb after downing chips and pita bread for appetizers) it doesnt come with cheese or sour cream something that would usually bother me but I didnt even notice til the end. The chicken is divine seasoned perfectly with a hint of lime and they give you a scoop of both their salsa and guac to make these wonderful tacos. Also added are a side of beans, which I despise and usually ask for them to be 86'ed but these were something else, something actually worthwhile, and the rice on the plate, was beyond normal rice. Holly W. was our waitress and what a waitress she was, if you can get her do.

And their salads aren't bad either: the seafood salad comes with all sorts of ""chopped vegetables"" - including edamame beans! Not your typical salad... But my favorite new dish at Hub is on the lunch menu - the pulled chicken nachos! We stayed away from the nachos before because one Yelper said the chips were flimsy, but I am so glad we decided to try them anyway. These were the probably the best nachos I've ever had and they come in a huge mountain on a huge dish. Definitely enough for two people. The chicken was tasty and the sauce was good - they gave us a mini pitcher of sauce and I think we poured almost all of it on the plate. So good. I think we are definitely fans.",0.9913,0.769,0.222,0.009,0.671291866028708
2008-07-14,5.0,"Great new restaurant! Their menu has a big variety (sushi, burgers, salads, tacos, steak) - everything I've tried so far has been awesome! I love their pulled chicken nachos - perfectly crispy thin tortilla chips and yummy toppings....great appetizer to share. Their Hub punch (on tap!) is the perfect compliment. It tastes like a margarita but not as sweet. I do think they put too much ice in the pitcher though...Unnecessary. Their halibut tacos rock....I love the flavors and their cilantro rice is so flavorful! My friends have had the sea bass, salmon, salads and sushi...everyone loved it. The salads are HUGE....big enough to share! I've been twice, service rocked the first time (3rd day it was open so expected), but was slow this past Friday night. Didn't bother us much since we had plenty of punch to finish, but if I wasn't 2 pitchers in it would have bothered me.",0.9862,0.728,0.237,0.035,0.5668642951251648
2008-07-14,4.0,"Went here on Saturday night - it's located in the Marriott on Hubbard and Dearborn. New restaurants within walking distance of home are always welcome. You cannot go wrong here; noticed Rich Melman was sitting near the entrance when we were came in. when we arrived at about 6:30 there was no wait, but by the time we left, the place was packed.  Beer and wine selection is good though they should serve a glass of wine cheaper than $9. Opted for a beer; there are some good ones on tap. The food was very good - I had the fish tacos (they used halibut), served with guac, rice, and black beans, and a little side of cole slaw. It's served as a filet so that you can slice it however you want. Tortillas are homemade. Didn't try any appetizers, but they looked good. And we saw some of the other dishes being served - everything looked well-prepared and salads are large.  Service was attentive and I have to mention that this place has beautiful servers! The entire waitstaff (at least on this night) was female, and they all looked like models.  There are 2 big bars, one in the front and one in the back. Downstairs on the way to the restroom I saw their lounge, which from the looks of the crowds on other nights, is already very popular.  I would recommend and I look forward to going back soon, trying different food, or even stopping by after work for a drink. It should be a popular  restaurant for a long time given the location, the setting, service, and food.",0.9932,0.825,0.165,0.01,0.5254858104858106
2008-07-12,4.0,"I had one of the best lunches here ever. The food and selection are perfect....and the huge bar area is definitely a place that I'll want to come back to for a few drinks. Had the smokey chicken tacos, to-die-for guac, ceviche, coffee, hummus, and probably about every dessert on the menu split between the six of us.  Love the minimalistic decor as well. I will jump at the next chance I have to come here.",0.9501,0.773,0.227,0.0,0.41875
2008-07-11,5.0,When I first looked at Hub 51 I thought that it was the type of place that had too broad of a menu for anything to be really outstanding but I was most definitely wrong. This place is out of this world. We started off by ordering the pulled chicken nachos. By the time we were done we had cleaned almost all the broken chip crumbs off the plate. They also have a drink called the Hub Punch and you feel like someone hit you in the head after a few but they are soooo good. They have all kinds of liquor in them and they taste amazing. For dinner I had the salmon which is glazed in miso. I've never tasted miso before (except for the soup) but this was amazing. It was almost a sweet glaze and the fish was cooked to perfection. My girlfriend had the fish tacos and she said they were possibly the best she has ever had. This place also plays the most amazing music. Anything from Jack Johnson to Kanye West. It sounds like it might not go with the ambiance but it works really well.  This place is a must go hands down.,0.9933,0.744,0.221,0.035,0.5894290123456791
2008-07-11,4.0,"I was lucky enough to be invited by a friend for their soft opening.... so we were able to sample ALOT of the food.   The appetizers were awesome - good guac and alot of it plus the salsa was really good too.  Very tasty sweet potato sushi roll - definitely good on its own but the dipping sauces were quite yummy accompaniments.   So with that - we were all hyped up by our appetizers and had such high expectations for our entrees.  Unfortunately, we were a little let down.  Don't get me wrong, the entrees were decent, but didn't knock our socks off. Two of us got tacos - fish and chicken.  Good portions and well seasoned meats, but I found it a bit weird that we had to constrict them ourselves. The other two in our group ordered fish - both felt their fish was undercooked.  But the saving grace was the uuuuhhhmmazing CARROT CAKE.  Who knew carrot cake could be so decadently good??  I couldn't stop eating the stuff.... and the cream cheese frosting.. heavenly.  Yummmm ! Good beginning and amazing ending -which made up for our 'just ok ' entrees.  Id definitely go back and try out their other entrees for another chance. P.S.  The place had a really good vibe... nice decor and loved the garage door windows.  Extremely attentive waitstaff.  Also, I really got a kick out of the comments throughout the menu and their website.  (When their website was under construction it said something to the effect of 'Conveniently located near the adult bookstore' ... hahaha)",0.997,0.727,0.256,0.017,0.600105105105105
2008-07-10,5.0,"Martha D hit the nail on the head.  This weekend was Hub Punch 2, Steffan 1.  It was a good fight though.  The atmosphere is amazing.  The bottom of the menu says it all (you'll get it when you go).  It has a very laid back yet semi-formal feel to it.  Sub 51 (the downstairs) is a great place to party or for a private party.  I have tried a good portion of the menu and it definitely lives up to the Let Us (Let Us Entertain You; google it) reputation.  Final thought:  Try the Jerky.",0.9661,0.75,0.226,0.024,0.5583333333333333
2008-07-08,5.0,AMAZING!  We ate there during the soft opening and ordered about half the menu including every dessert on the Menu...Can you say the chef's mom's family recipie for Carrot Cake?...Best I've ever had (and they put extra frosting on the side!)  We actually went back the next week and ordered two pieces to go along with the one we ate after dinner! The main courses were nothing short of perfection either.  Who would have thought a restaurant would have great sushi and guacamole on the same menu?   Keep up the good work!,0.9014,0.844,0.127,0.029,0.3104166666666667
2008-07-07,4.0,"So it's not even 10am yet and I'm already thinking about their Hub Punch. Citrus vodka AND tequila with pomegranate... ridiculously strong and totally addicting.  Oh and there are other good things to note: my friends loved the Ahi tuna burger and sweet potato sushi. Plus they have great beers on tap, random but fun music selection, and the club just opened downstairs.  I'm headed back for dinner - and more punch :) - this week.",0.9602,0.733,0.248,0.019,0.5715277777777777
2008-07-01,4.0,"My boyfriend and I stumbled upon hub 51 last night we had a great experience.  The decor is young and unpretentious with great 'garage door' windows.  The music was great and not loud (which they insinuate it is on their menu...they tell you to bring ear plugs) Our service could have been better...nothing bad, but our waitress was a little awkward, like it could have been her first serving job.  My boyfriend didn't like that after we ordered she said, ""that's all?"" but she was nice and attentive.  I really liked that they keep a bottle of water on your table so you can fill up whenever you need to, instead of waiting for someone.  The menu has a little bit of everything on it, like four types of soft tacos, ribs, sushi, and burgers.  We ordered the appetizer pulled chicken nachos ($11), California burger ($12) and a Simple Green Salad ($5.) And let me tell you...both of us said these are probably the best nachos I have ever had!  The toppings and chicken was spread out all over instead of globbed on top, which was a plus for me.   Unfortunately or fortunately, depending on how you look at it, the nachos were so large that when they brought us the rest of our food, we had to ask our server just to box it up because we were sooo full.   They packed the food us so well, will all the sides in a different container.  We will defiantly be back, and order more wisely so we can eat our whole meal at the restaurant!",0.9877,0.836,0.14,0.024,0.5862889983579638
2008-06-30,5.0,"Well I'm sort of partial to these boys since I've known them for close to 10 years.  But besides knowing them for so long, they've created a great space. I love the decor, simple yet elegant.  When I looked at the menu I thought to myself, this has to be everything that RJ and Jerrod like to eat.  There's everything from sushi to filet mignon tacos to crab nachos to carrot cake.   We ordered the chicken nachos, they were fantastic.  I ordered the filet mignon tacos based on RJ's recommendation since he said it was one of his favorites.  The steak was perfectly cooked and was delicious.  The tortillas were homemade and fantastic.  The only thing I didn't like was I was under the impression that the rice served with it would be Spanish rice, not regular rice.  The rice was good, I was just thrown off.  My boyfriend and friend we were with both ordered the burgers, they loved them. The fries have a bit of flavor to them as well.    My favorite thing was that they have a cocktail on tap, how cool is that?  The service was great, I always am a fan of other waiters helping each other out and not just standing there when they see plates that need to be bussed that aren't in their section.  I always prefer more of a team atmosphere. Let's see what else, the bathrooms are located downstairs and you have to walk by this cool lounge thing that I hear will be opening up in a few days.  Oh and the best part is reading the menu, I love the sarcasm.  It's so RJ.  :)",0.9974,0.739,0.255,0.006,0.6271876271876272
2008-06-24,4.0,"Really on the fence in between 3 and 4 stars....but I am givin them the benefit of the doubt as it was a pre-opening night.  I enjoyed the food and atmosphere at this restaurant.  We were here for a test run night last week and they didn't have their liquor license yet so I'm only reviewing the few things we munched upon and the general vibe of the place, not the service or anything like that.   We had the dry rubbed spare ribs and crab nachos to start.  I'm not a huge fan of ribs, but they were pretty darn good.  They come out with a dry nutty side dish to dip your ribs in, and watch out, because it contains pop rocks!  If you aren't ready for the sensation it can be quite a shock.  The nachos weren't too heavy on the crab, which is understandable costwise, but seemed to be light on everything else as well...once you got done with the top layer of the nachos there was nothing but chips!  The chips were a little flimsy as well and couldn't hold up the excessive guac on top.  Our entrees were simply delicious.  We both had fish....sea bass on my part.   Exceeded my expectations and could match the fish at any fine dining establishment in my opinion.  The dessert I fell in love with was the carrot cake.  I normally wouldn't order such an item, but the combination of the just right frosting and contrast between that and the moist deliciousness that was the cake....to die for.   The other dessert we had was some sort of ice cream bar, and it was just so-so...especially in comparison to the cake!!  All in all a good dining experience.  My only concern with both the set up of the tables/bar areas and the menu was that I couldn't decide whether or not I was eating in a bar or a quirky fine dining restaurant and that kind of bothered me....but then again that may very well be what they are going for.   I can't wait for the bar to open downstairs as it looked super cool, and I enjoyed the spy cams in the ladies bathroom so you could check out what your man was doin' while you were away from the table!  I shall definitely return when they are up and running full speed to try other menu items and I recommend you go check it out!",0.9934,0.806,0.149,0.045,0.5992063492063492
