I ordered the tacos and had a margarita, the tacos were very tender and tacos (skirt steak) and filling, I only ate 1.  The margaritas were good but the servings weren't huge for the large which I ordered.   I will visit again if I am in the area, but I will know what to stick with as far as ordering.",0.5234,0.895,0.069,0.037,0.5572420634920635

2017-03-03,2.0,"The food was average. The margaritas were good. This review is about neither. What really upset me was this...we came here to celebrate my friend Kimmy's Birthday. During our time here, several (at least four) other birthdays were acknowledged. Singing, clapping, the whole nine. From the time our order was placed, me and Kimmy's husband told our server and other servers several times that it was her birthday. Each time, they acknowledged us. So we continued talking and eating and totally unaware of the time, and they made the last call for alcohol. When they brought the final bill, I made sure to let the server know again that we were celebrating a birthday. Our server took pics of us. We paid our bill. We heavily tipped the waitress. Then, the tables were being cleared and floors were being swept. They were closing. No acknowledgment. No song. They were ready to go. Kimmy's husband had to go to the staff to let them know she was not acknowledged. They finally came with a birthday cake and a dry song, but it was obvious by their demeanor that this was something they'd rather not do. Wow. Maybe I would have felt differently if I had not witnessed their lively acknowledgement of so many other birthdays. No doubt about it, we were slighted, and I feel some kind of way about it. Whether we decide return or not remains to be seen. It definitely won't be to celebrate a birthday.",0.5628,0.843,0.089,0.068,0.5072222222222222

The Mexican rice was dry and the vegetarian burrito dinner ($10.95) was not good, because it was a white flour burrito filled with lettuce, rice, a smidge of guac, sour cream, maybe refried beans?, and a tomato (seriously? no bell peppers at least?). What was on the burrito dinner plate was also in the burrito. Meat eaters might enjoy the fajitas or house specials, which look a little tastier. I did enjoy a medium frozen strawberry margarita ($6.95).

My wife did not notice at the time she signed the ticket. When we got home my daughter told my wife that the restaurant called my sister who joined us for dinner that evening, since they had her phone number from her calling them earlier.

She brought the pitcher and i was waiting  for my drink. I taught my drink was still being made  and it still kept  taken long till i got up and ask for my drink. The waitress  forgot my drink. I understand  she was busy because  she had a big group in the other table  but she was more concerned  with the other table  then us. She didn't  come as often  to ask  if we needed anything at all. And she was by that table most of the time  till after 45 minutes  she ask if we needed  anything  we just  ask for  are check! Busy or not busy as customer service you should be like that  with all people not just one group because  your concern  with your TIP!!  Its about  taken care of all of your customers the same way. I had stay away from Poncho for a long time  and well continue  to doin it. I think  people  react to this restaurant  more then anthing. People that dont know good MEXICANA food and also there  margaritas  are not the best. But that  what  alot of people  think  because they don't  know any better.  I go to this place that makes 100 percent  better margaritas then Poncho. The owner needs  to get better waitress. That treat all the customers the same way.,-0.7884,0.861,0.058,0.082,0.375

They were real good, but did not get it replenished, especially compared to other restaurants I've been to.

Recommendation : Everything's good, but the Bistec a la Mexicana is amazing! Recommendation: If ordering a large takeout order, make sure all food is accounted for before leaving. I came here on 8/23/2015. I ordered 4 things: a Chicken Taco Salad, Nachos, a Burrito, and the Bistec a la Mexicana. I was surprised that it cost me about $50 for those four items, I was hoping more around 35-40. I ordered the food for takeout, and it was ready very quickly. It seemed like a nice casual spot to sit down and eat, and they were busy when I came in to pickup my food. I paid for it, left, and went downtown to my event. When I got there I noticed they didn't give me my Bistec a la Mexicana! That was the most expensive item I had gotten, and it was very frustrating because that one was for me to eat.  I called and told them about it, and they apologized and said the cashier forgot to give me the second bag.   On my way back home, I went back to the restaurant (5 hours later) since they were open until midnight, I had to explain what happened again to the manager on duty since the person I talked to on the phone didn't leave any note for them. They almost tried to give me that same order that had been sitting out for 5 hours. But, quickly, the manager decided to refund my money for the Bistec a la Mexicana and remake it so that I could have it fresh. Since this was my first time trying this restaurant, I believe this was a good decision, and I appreciated the show of good faith. While I waited for them to remake the order, I was offered water and chips and salsa. The food was finished quickly and they apologized again for the confusion and mix-up. He promised that I would like the food. I DID! That Bistec a la Mexicana boosts my rating of this experience back up to a 4-star. (along with the refund and apologies). I'll more than likely be back to this place. It was spicy and well seasoned, dripping with flavor, and a good sized portion. All of the food was very tasty, and the people were nice.

The restaurant was crowded and there were only two tables left up front by the window. The hostess informed us that the adjacent second floor area would be opening at 5pm and that we could wait if we preferred. We waited and was subsequently seated just after the five o'clock hour. You have to exit the first floor dining area and walk next door to get to the adjacent second floor. Once inside you walk upstairs to a large dining area. The restaurant has a warm, inviting atmosphere and nice decor. Our waitress was wasn't extremely engaging but she was pleasant and efficient.  I'd originally ordered the combo platter that consisted of tacos, tostadas and an enchilada. I don't like enchiladas so I'd asked for two tacos and one tostadas instead. But the waitress came back and said that she was informed that no substitutions were allowed. Huh? You mean you can't substitute an enchilada for a taco?? Seriously? That makes absolutely NO sense to me. What difference does it make? Since I wasn't allowed to make the substitution I changed my order to the taco dinner. I ended up getting the three beef tacos with rice and beans. The food was hot, fresh and flavorful. My only complaint is that the rice was a bit salty. My friend ordered the flauntas and he liked his food too. We also had margaritas which were delicious.

It's now my favorite entree and I have enough for two days.  I've also had the hochata and omg I absolutely loved it.  It's sweet, but not to sweet and just enough cinnamon. I've also had the strawberry margarita.  It's just like I like it,  nice and strong. To finish off,  I had a slice of tres leches cake. The slice is small but great after a large meal.

It was very good and tasted like authentic Mexican guacamole. I also had the carne asada dish, which was excellent. Although the portion size was a bit small, it was definitely filling. The steak was very juicy and tasted very good. It was definitely one of the best carne asada dishes I have had at a restaurant. Also, this time around, the rice actually had flavor...and it was good. The music they play here consists of random Spanish music. They did play a couple songs from Heroes del Silencio and Soda Stereo, so that gets them extra points.

NEVER ORDERING FROM PANCHO PISTOLAS AGAIN!!  **TELLING OUR CO-WORKERS ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE** A group of us at work decided to treat ourselves and have lunch delivered in today. We called to place our order and when it was delivered we discovered that one order ( burrito dinner no beans and double rice ) was missing. Included in the order was a single burrito loaded with beans that we did not order. When we called back to let them know that they did not include the burrito dinner, the woman on the phone sounded annoyed and said "" How many bags were delivered?"" I didnt understand what that had to do with the missing dinner (by the way I was charged for it on the receipt).  She continued by saying well we can give you a credit and you can pick it up next time. I stated that the person who order the dinner  has nothing to eat for lunch and that I woud like the burrito dinner that was paid for delivered. She then placed me on hold for about 5 minutes. She came back to the phone and said the best she could do is to send the deliver guy back with some rice. I could not believe she suggested that  we keep the burrito with beans until she sends back a side order of rice!!!! REALLY!!! So in the meantime the person is suppose to eat the burrito with the beans and eat the cold rice after it arrives??? When I asked for a manager she gives the phone to the girl who originally took the order. The girl that took the order was rude and far from accomodating. When I asked to speak to the manager again she asked if I would like ""rice"" on the burrito.  Needless to say, I never got a chance to talk to the manager because she rudely said OK OK we will send you the burrito dinner you ordered.

My best friend and I arrived about 25 minutes before our group of 10 and we were both starving. We decided to order the quesadillas. At first, the waitress kept coming around to take our drink order, despite us telling her we were waiting for a group. Our quesadillas arrived after about 5 other people came and the service only grew worse. It seemed all the other tables were full with large groups, as well, but they kept getting their food and drinks before our table. The 2 baskets of chips we had were never replenished. On to the food. For the most part, we all enjoyed the food. Their giant, arm-length burrito was a hit with one of our friends. The steak a la Tampiquena was just fine for someone else. My friend ordered the tilapia tacos, which I doubt he'll be having again. The fish seemed to have a coating reminiscent of Shake N' Bake and very a bit on the greasy side. The spicy chipotle mayo that came on his tacos was a bit on the hot side so it wasn't too enjoyable. I'm normally skeptical of ordering shrimp in smaller places for fear of it being tough/rubbery, but meatless Friday called for shrimp fajitas. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. A huge serving of shrimp with sweet bell peppers and onions came on a skillet, piping hot. Served on the side were the typical re-fried beans, rice and iceberg lettuce. The shrimp was delicious, with a bit of a kick. Nicely done. We all shared a tres leches cake, which was moist and not overly sweet.

Simply having their Venezuelan sauce did not help. I did enjoy the fresh avocado topped with the sauce.

The place wasn't packed and we were immediately seated and greeted with menu, iced water, and complimentary chips and salsa. Refills on chips and salsa are not complimentary so do not be surprised if you see an extra charge on your bill. We did not ask for refills but we did finish the chips and salsa. Both salsa dips are spicy but there are slight variations in the ingredient. One consisted of diced tomatoes and shredded peppers whereas the other was liquidy and saucier in a darker red.   For dinner, we ordered two horchatas, fried ice cream, steak taco, pulled pork taco, two steak tostadas, and taco dinner with grilled chicken, pulled pork and ground beef. The horchata was great! It is $1.95 for one huge glass. My friend didn't order one but she couldn't help but steal a few sips from mine. So it's enough to share! The steak taco and tostada were zealous. I devoured both within minutes! The steak was well-marinated and soft. I hate it when my steak is well done, dry, and chewy.   On a side note, my friends didn't enjoy the pulled pork and ground beef. One stated how the pulled pork was gamey and overly salted. The other commented on the ground beef being unpleasant. She didn't go into further detail and I didn't get to try a bite, although she left 75% of that taco untouched.  The fried ice cream was mediocre. It's basically fried corn flakes wrapped around a ball of vanilla ice cream. It was my first time to have fried ice cream so I didn't know what to expect. I anticipated it to have a ""blow-me-away"" effect and it left me feeling dull and disappointed. Next time I will try the flan and tres leche!",0.968,0.797,0.133,0.07,0.5233333333333333

I could go to Pilsen and hit up Aztecas Tacos on 18th/blue island and pay $3.55 for the same ""jumbo"" margarita. I took 3 friends there yesterday and our bill was $50 before tip for 4 people, and we all had several ""jumbo"" drinks and left over food.  When my sister and I went to Pancho Pistolas, our waitress was rude and we had to constantly find her if we wanted our bill, or if we needed anything. My sister didn't like her taco salad and she ate much less than half of it. She told the waitress who just shrugged and asked if we wanted something else. She even charged us for it. In the end, 1 burrito, 4 margaritas, 3 quesadillas, 2 extra lime wedges, and 1 bag of chips(yeah they even charged extra for chips and lime slices) , oh and the half eaten taco salad was $70(no tip).  I foolishly decided to give them another chance so I just made a delivery order today. 1 burrito, chips, and 2 tacos was $21. WTF? Each taco was $3.50(because cheese is $.75 extra).

I tend to go after the White Sox games because it's in Bridgeport, but mostly because the carne asada is consistently good. I don't know how they prepare it but it's really their signature. The peach margaritas are worth every dollar and even the regular margarita on the rocks (I prefer an unsalted rim) is pretty good. The Pancho Grande (17"" burrito) with steak is around 12 dollars but I haven't seen anyone finish it in one sitting for a number of years. Try the other half the next day from the fridge. It still tastes good.  The service is usually decent and the place can get crowded especially now that it continues to grow in popularity.  I noticed a trend that when I went for lunch it wasn't as good as when I would go for dinner and I tested this by going for lunch and dinner on the same day and ordering the same thing. Result; it's better at dinnertime. Now don't get me wrong, it's still good for lunch.

But a few friends and I went out last night looking for: 1) Good, reasonably priced food. 2) Margaritas. 3) Somewhere we didn't have to wait on a Saturday night. I'd gotten a little cynical about whether these three were possible for a group of seven - but Pancho Pistolas delivered.  1) Good, reasonably priced food. Check. Crunchy chips, spicy salsa, followed big ol' portions of Mexican favorites. My tablemates were big fan of their beef/chicken soups, which came out in enormous bowls that looked a bit like porcelain buckets; I was happily pleased with my huevos racheros. (Huzzah, breakfast all day.) 2) Margaritas. Double check. Available in enough sizes and flavors to keep the table conversation flowing in goofy directions, and priced appropriately - no forcing your hand with the smallest drink priced at 12 bucks. Also a few Mexican and domestic beers for the manly men with us. A lot of places in Pilsen are BYOB; this is all well and good, but sometimes, as my friend noted, you just want someone to make you a margarita with a fancy little piece of fruit in it. Pancho Pistolas can do that for ya. 3) Easy for a big group. I don't live in Bridgeport, but this is why I'd come back to this restaurant - they easily handled a big group arriving at 8 PM on a Saturday night with minimal fuss. It's probably not the most authentic Mexican food in the city, and I'm sure somewhere else is bragging about the best margaritas in town, but if you're looking for a friendly place where your friends can easily stop in at for chips, salsa, and booze, visit Senor Pancho.

As far as the service, our server was nice, but we noticed that the restaurant was getting very empty (we sat on the second floor) until finally we were the last people.  At some point during dinner, we were brought the check  (without asking) and the bus boy started picking up our dishes, one of us finally asked what time do you close?  he said ""10 o'clock"" - it was almost 11.  We rushed out, but didn't like the fact that we weren't even offered the option to order dessert downstairs, which stays open later.   Nothing wrong with this place at all - food is fine.  But in a city with a gazillion great Mexican restaurants I think it will be a while before I come back to Pancho Pistolas.",0.9958,0.824,0.147,0.029,0.5342391304347824

However, I thought this was worth mentioning: Last trip to PP was a few weeks ago.  Went with three other friends.  As usual, we were brought two kinds of salsa, along with chips (without having to ask for it; pretty par for the course for a Mexican restaurant).  We took probably 10 to 15 minutes to order dinner, as one of our party had never been to PP, and we were yappin' and munchin' on the salsa & chips.  When we placed our dinner order, we started with guacamole and then ordered four entrees. Here's the thing:  By the time the guacamole was served, we were almost out of chips and asked for another basket.  At this time we were informed there would be $1.50 charge added to the bill for an extra basket of chips. So lemme get this straight.  We don't ask for chips, we are served chips, NO charge.  We order guacamole, which cannot be eaten without chips, and we ARE charged.  Oooookay. How is this reasonable?  Why would you risk alienating your customers for something that probably costs the restaurant all of thirty cents? The amount we were charged wasn't the issue.  The principle certainly was.  Ridiculous. _________________ (Review of 5/2010) Went yesterday (Friday night) with two other friends.  We were able to be seated on the first floor at around 7:30, didn't feel cramped.  Greeted immediately with water, chips, and two different kinds of salsa (the chunkier version was pleasantly HOT). Waitress took our drink order and returned fairly quickly with our  pitcher of margaritas and took our order.  A short time later we were served.  My friend enjoyed her enchildas (suisa, I think), one each of beef, chicken, cheese.  My other friend and I ordered carne asada, which was probably the best I've ever had.  Flavorful and a nice thickness.  The waitress returned a few minutes later to inquire if we were thus far satisfied with our meals.  We were. We never saw our waitress again until she came back to ask if we were ready for our check. This is my only gripe.  We three had finished our cocktails and would have liked more.  Another margarita, a few beers, what have you.  Maybe we were purposefully ignored so she could turn the table (mission accomplished!), but we were disappointed.  It was my birthday, and I wanted to get my birthday buzz on.  Is that too much to ask? That said, I'd probably go back.  Overall nice atmosphere and good food.  Oh, and I took a steak taco to go, and it was fantastic.  THAT's the kind of steak you want in your taco.",0.9878,0.864,0.108,0.028,0.4632980599647266

2009-12-29,4.0,"Was originally supposed to go to Freddie's across the street but after the hike out to Bridgeport the wife decides she wants Mexican Food. So after a long drive I'm starving, trying not to succumb to a state of insanity due to the indecisiveness of my better half. Right across the street I see a modern spacious Mexican restaurant with a diverse crowd and the Hawks game on the Flat Screen TV. Pancho Pistolas to the rescue! So we walk in it's Saturday night, crowded, but much to our delight there is a sole table in the back for 2 empty so no waiting necessary. The first thing I noticed after the chips and salsa came to the table(which were overall pretty good red salsa and basic tortilla chips) was that the menu had a LOT of options. So after a lot of head scratching I settle on the Shrimp Fajitas and the wife orders the Enchiladas Verdes(enchiladas in green salsa) We start off with frozen Margaritas which were great, very authentic and you could actually taste the tequila. So I thought we were headed for a mediocre meal as usually great margaritas is usually a cover up for mediocre or bad food. Man I tell you I'm glad I was wrong. The food arrives at our table a short time later a long smoky sizzling iron skillet of SCRIMPS fajitas shows up at the table with sour cream, veggies, and guac on the side and did I mention HOMEMADE TORTILLAS! The wife also gets her enchiladas which she was impressed with and considering shes an authentic Mexican who makes her own they must have been good if they actually impressed her. The fajitas were flavorful and unlike most joints they were very generous with the shrimp and these were a good size not some canned or frozen crap. Very impressed with this place as by the looks of it from the outside it appeared to be one of those North Side yuppified Mexican Joints, but thanks to the diverse crowd I gave it the benefit of the doubt and I'm glad I did.",0.9933,0.739,0.18,0.08,0.4707996406109614

That's what I feel like with this place. The Environment:  Not the most authentic Mexican restaurant, but it's no Taco Bell either.  The first floor is quite small so it does get packed rather quite quickly, however the second floor seems to be much better spaced out and over a better view.  It is stated on the front of the door that it is the ""Home to White Sox Fans"", but yet there were a few time I went over during the Summer months in the middle of a Sox game and there where no Sox games to be found on the two TVs at the restaurant.  Even when the games are on, I usually find myself the only one paying attention to the score.  That does not sound like the place a true White Sox fan would want to go to enjoy an important game. When it does busy, it seems like the place is over packed and everyone is on top of one another.  The spacing on the first level seems to be maxed out and don't ever sit anywhere near the door in the winter months, as people will open and close that door about 50 times during your meal and you feel like you are dinning outside.  The food: The complimentary chips are good but limited and they do not offer free refills on the chips.  The salsa they offer is good and spicy.  The chicken is usually pretty good but I have been striking out on the steak lately.  Not sure if they switch to a cheaper meat or what, but it used to pretty good too.  The sides are fairly plain, since its just beans and yellow rice.  The horchatas are decent but not the best out there.  The margaritas are usually nice and strong, although I'm not a fan of margaritas anyway.  The beer selection seems limited to the usual commercial brands.  The prices are pretty high for it be considered a mom and pop Mexican restaurant. The service: The Assistant Wait Staff (Some call them bus-boys) are great here.  They always give you chips and a jar of water within the first 5 seconds of seating down.  However if this place is busy, you can forget about quick service from your waitress.  Some of these waitress seems to fold under pressure as they take their time whenever this place is packed.  There were a few times we had to walk out because it took so long for the food to come out.  Not cool.   So why do I keep going back?? Well cause it is sooo freaking close to where I live.  I came to the conclusion that the best way to enjoy this restaurant is to not eat there.  I usually just place my order and pick it up and enjoy it at the comfort of my home (sometimes with my own unlimited chips and salsa).  Food is usually good, but the service and atmosphere can be way better.  As long as I live in the area, I'm sure to be going back there; but not too sure about eating there.",0.9982,0.761,0.186,0.053,0.47215913715913715

I've had just about everything on the menu at one time or another (which is all good) but nothing is on the level of the Carne Asada. The steak is perfectly marinated and always tender and juicy. You will not be disappointed. The rice and beans are the best I've had and I've tried most of them!  The margaritas (lime, on the rocks w/salt ... the only way to really drink margaritas if you ask me) are made from the mix but are not overly syrupy as some can be and have just the right combination of sweet and sour. They are also extremely potent which is exactly the way I like them! If you're with a few people and are planning on doing some drinking go with the pitchers as they are going to give you the most bang for your buck.  I tried the flan for the first time yesterday and it was great!  I'm not that big on flan in general but this was homemade and prepared to perfection. This restaurant is friendly and inviting. If you see that the street level dining room is full enter through the door just west of the main entrance to get to the upper level dining room which is generally more open feeling and can accommodate larger parties.

2009-09-21,3.0,"This place is really cute but I think it's overpriced. We went for dinner last night, and I wasn't expecting it to be so crowded for a Sunday evening.  We had to wait 5-10 minutes for a table, but it was a little less crowded about half an hour later. We sat down and were immediately greeted with glasses of water, a carafe of water for the table, and chips with salsa.  We quickly ordered chicken quesadillas as an appetizer.  Everything was tasty.   As we were in the middle of our appetizer, the waitress asked us if we would mind switching tables since the big group next to us was kinda cramped.  So we moved everything over to the next table.  I thought this was a little odd, but didn't really mind.  However I think it would have been nice of them to offer us something for the inconvenience. One of the guys asked for another thing of salsa, and when the check came we were charged $2 for it.  That seems like a lot for a little extra salsa. When our food arrived, my fiance was given the wrong thing after he told the served that wasn't his dish (he had ordered the taco dinner and they tried to give him a chicken dish).  The waitress took it away to get him tacos, but I found it odd that they set it in front of him after he said it wasn't his. My burrito dinner was very tasty, and I like that there was guacamole on the side.  But it was just a good burrito, with good rice and beans.  Those are pretty standard Mexican items. I ordered a frozen margarita.  It was good, but I did see them pouring margarita mix straight from the bottle into the glasses, so you could definitely make these at home.  The pitcher was around $16, and that seemed like a good deal, but I was the only one at the table having one, so I just ordered a large one.  It was only $1 more than the regular, and definitely worth going up a size. Overall, if our bill had been a bit less than it was, this would have been a great place with 4 or 5 stars.  But it just wasn't quite good enough to have been almost $20 a person.  (That was for 1 appetizer, 3 dinners, 1 coke, and 1 margarita).",0.9934,0.824,0.142,0.035,0.4165360479313968

2009-08-02,4.0,"Aaron S. took me out to dinner here tonight. I had mentioned to him that I wanted to try it one of these days because it just intrigued me when I would pass by it on my way to work or whatever.  Walking in I noticed how small it is, not in a bad way but for some reason from the outside it just looks bigger. Aaron mentioned that they have an upstairs which is kinda cool. They had a party up their tonight and on most nights I would guess they'd seat the bigger groups up there.  The room is also kind of noisy and I think Aaron had a hard time hearing me, but it wasn't that bad considering how crowed the place was ( I think all but three tables were filled up), I also think the table was a little cramped, not much room for the food and drinks, but it wasn't a huge issue.  We were given menus and water right away, and the waitress was nice enough to bring a small pitcher of water out for us seeing as it was our only drinks. Also some super crunchy slightly warm chips and two kinds of salsa. I liked the one with the chunks of tomato best but both were quite good. I even spooned some of the spicier one on my food.   We were having a hard time deciding what to get, it had been a while for me since having Mexican food out so everything sounded tasty.The waitress cane and asked what we were having we had to tell her we didn't know yet. We were given ample time after that to decide, nice that she did not hover. Though it did seem to take a while for her to come back, I think because they were really busy though, so it was understandable. It wasn't a super long wait or anything.   I went with the Chimichangas and Aaron got the dinner that had carne asada, and an enchalada (sp?).. I  was pleased reading the menu that they don't stuff that yellow rice stuff in their burritos like a lot of other restaurants do. That makes me happy, not being a rice fan. The Chimichangers were dammed near perfect. They were fried to a nice golden color and the meat inside had an excellent flavor and juicy texture. I mentioned to Aaron ""You know how at a lot of Mexican places the meat is almost crunchy? well this isn't"" They came topped with a generous dollop of sour cream and gauc...the gauc was super fresh, yum! They beans they served on the side were tasty as well. Aaron said his steak had a great flavor but it was a lot of work to eat.  They have two TV's and tonight they had the game on. The whole room clapped and cheered when the cubs lost. Hooray for living in Sox territory. Also there was a group of cops at the table behind us, and apparently one of them was having a birthday. Aaron and I joined in the singing.  Aaron also ordered some flan which we split, the sauce on it was so good we nearly licked the plate, very good flan, and I am usually not a flan fan.  (Also just a note, they seemed a little pricey to me, but still in the fair range. I think the only reason it seemed high to me is I ate at more of the taco stand divey type Mexican joints, you know the type I'm talking about, where they don't even have a seating area and you have to take it to go...)

2009-08-02,3.0,"If I had a TV Show on the Food Network, there are a lot of names/programs I'd LIKE to pitch and record - but I know I'd wind up hosting the ""Fat American Can't Figure Out Foreign Cuisines"" show. It was made pretty evident in my multiple attempts at ""hot pot"" and how to apparently abuse the few utensils we were given and ruin a lot of food in the process.  It was only recently that I discovered the reason why Italian places give you a spoon in addition to your silverware when you order saucy pasta.  And even though I've consumed a metric ton of sushi in my years, a Japanese chef would slap my hand for improper holding of chopsticks, as well as using the wrong end to grab from a communal plate and chastise my usage of soy sauce for dipping. Which brings us to Mexican food at Pancho Pistolas.  Now it's pretty clear at this point that I'm not ""well-versed"" in Mexican food.  I know ENOUGH to know that Qboda is not Mexican food at all (my review states that several times), but when it comes to more-authentic-style Mexican cuisine, I'm stumped at random things. I went with the Carna Asada A La Tampiqueña because it's a steak, an enchilada, and all the side-piles.  I admit to looking confused when the waitress asked if I wanted flour or corn tortillas after I chose ""medium-rare"" for the carne, but I went with corn and thought nothing more of it. Of course, first we were brought a lovely basket of chips and two salsas.  I preferred the spicier one, but only because it wasn't a bowl of chunks like the milder one and the cilantro was less pronounced in flavor and chunkage. (Yea, I hate cilantro, but I won't let it affect my review.  Unless the place sucks as much as cilantro does.) When our meals came out, so did a lovely steamer basket with corn tortillas for me.  And there I was, a stranger in a strange land of foods, it seemed.  I enjoyed the flavor of the Carne Asada, although found the cut to be very stringy and full of sinew.  It would have been easier to cut if I the place weren't so dark that I couldn't tell the grain direction of the meat, though.  I know the flank steak is itself known for chewiness and stringiness, but a good chef would know how to work around that. And it was sitting next to a pile of Spanish rice, nestled next to my enchilada (which was excellent), and then there was a pile of lettuce with guacamole on top and a big ol pile of refried beans with Chihuahua cheese melted on top and a large roasted Poblano pepper?  Forgive my American ignorance, but what am I supposed to do with this stuff?  I tore up my tortillas and scooped some of the side dishes into it like a floppy nacho, but something didn't seem right.  I could almost sense that somewhere hidden from sight were a bunch of waitstaff watching me on CCTV and laughing at me. Of course, I wouldn't have been able to hear a second of it.  The place is very loud, and you can barely hold a conversation with someone across the table, especially when the place is packed (which it usually is).  This place also falls victim to the ""random HDTV showing something you can't hear"" and we spent a few minutes trying to figure out what the hell show was on before we gave up and it switched to Sportcenter or something. Everyone talks about margaritas when it comes to Mexican restaurants.  I think there are much better testaments to the quality of a Mexican establishment than tequila-based frozen drinks - but when you reconsider that their mascot is a stereotypical handlebar-mustachioed Mexican wildly firing pistols into the air, I guess a jumbo peach margarita served from an electric slushie machine in the bar area doesn't detract much from the Mexican authenticity. As for me, the true testament is in the Flan.  And while I've said before that it's very hard to ruin a flan, it takes a pretty good flan to stand out above the rest - and Pancho Pistolas served us a glorious custardy flan with luscious caramel sauce and a little maraschino cherry for garnish.  It was a pleasant end to a large and satisfying meal. So it's not the most authentic or fancy of all the Mexican restaurants in the area - but it does try to bring a little extra to the table.  The tortilla chips are far better here than elsewhere in Bridgeport.  The tortillas themselves seem to have a little more quality to them in general as well.  I'm not saying I'm never going back to Taco Erendira or Tacqueria San Jose - I'm just saying that then you're looking for a place that's more date-friendly and a nicer sit-down joint (although a crowded one at that), then Pancho Pistolas is the place you're looking for. If you can manage to figure out what to do with those extra items on your plate...  Seriously, what do they want from me???

2009-03-25,3.0,"Pancho's is a great place for dressed up Mexican food (in comparison to the the Tamale Guy) that's close-ish to my place of work. I went there for the first time today and had a reasonably enjoyable time.  At first the Margarita's were too sweet, like they were made from a mix maybe? But after a few sips, who cares? And after a glass they're delicious. :)  We said we'd have 8 people to start... they gave us a table that comfortably sat 6 and crammed in 2 extra chairs. We then heard from another friend that a another person was joining us and tried to move an extra chair over... we were then sort of scolded and told that our table is for 8, if we have more, they can do something then. Okay, whatever... but it is awkward when the 9th person walks in and feels unwelcome because there's nowhere to sit. Let me also say that there was only 1 person at the ""bar"" and 1 other table of 2 in the entire place... plenty of room. When a 10th friend dropped in they eventually broke down and let us have an extra table... one of the 12 other tables that were open and available at the time.  The 2 types of salsa they give are delicious! A really great and not bland amount of spice but As far as the food goes, it was pretty basic and nothing I would ever crave. It was all pretty dry and not very flavorful. I got 2 vegetarian gorditas that I didn't think were that great but I also don't think it was their specialty. Actually, prior to eating here, I thought gordita's were something made up by the Taco Bell corp... and truthfully, I would have really preferred taco bell. Pancho's tacos looked really good though. I know I'll be back and when I go defo I'll give the taco's a try.  The food isn't expensive but it's not cheap either. I feel like I could have gotten tastier and cheaper food at a mom and pop Mexican food stand but I was out with coworkers/friends and for that, I was happy to be at Panchos for a clean Mexican meal... I don't mean as opposed to dirty, I mean as opposed to sloppy, greasy Mexican food... mmm.

2009-02-21,4.0,"Here's what I like best about this place: the steak they use for their steak dishes is actually steak quality. When you order a steak taco or steak burrito at most Mexican places, they cut it up into tiny little pieces so you can't tell how mediocre the quality is, and then they fry it up on a griddle (usually in mass quantities) to ensure that it is devoid of any taste save whatever seasoning they may or may not use. Here at Pancho's, you get  big, juicy succulent, perfectly seasoned strips of grilled steak. Everyone we bring here is an instant convert to their steak dishes, be it the carne asada, the milanesa, or the steak chimichangas. My wife's brothers practically beg to eat here when they come to visit.  As for the rest of their dishes? Pretty good but not mind-blowing. But with the steak dishes so good, I'm not sure why you'd order anything else.  Margaritas are straight-up tequila and pre-mix; not terribly creative, BUT strong enough to get the job done. Prices have crept up lately but it's still quite reasonable.  Finally, I have never, and I mean NEVER, eaten here without at least one table being occupied by cops. I take the presence of cops at any restaurant to be a sign of a high quality-to-cost ratio, because those guys (and occasional gal) generally know every restaurant on the beat and they know which ones to go to and which ones to avoid.

2009-02-02,2.0,"I think a certain decent Mexican restaurant is starting to believe its own hype like when a semi-decent looking person starts dressing all slutty because two really horny people told this person that he/she was hot...well that's what is happening here except the people were hungry not horny but could have been and that may or not have influenced their behavior.  Full disclosure, I am Mexican and tend to prefer this place over Carbon simply because it's closer to where I work.  Let me begin... Everything about this place is okay.  They started out good enough with presentation.  The food was warm and pretty okay, just missing the cut off for good.  The big draw was the price so if you weighted the grades then it would be pretty good because it's so cheap.  But gradually Pancho's quality has slid and their prices have gone up.  Most notably in their rice which I distinctly remember never being frozen in an ice-cream scoop shape....seriously.  If you're going to cut corners do it with the more expensive stuff not with the fucking rice or the beans.  The beans have been the greatest disappointment.  Refried beans are so easy to do and not hard to do well.  Their bean quality has slipped significantly.  So this cutting corners stuff is total bull especially when you up your prices and build out a ridiculous looking second floor lounge (WTF?!?) to try to class things up, oh so reminiscent of El Cid's tragic fall from grace when they built their second floor lounge.  Sigh.   Focus on the basics and making things taste good.   P.S.

Well on this sunny, cold Sunday - Pancho Pistolas was packed- and it was 3:30 in the afternoon!  We grabbed the only open table and the server was quick to get our drink order and to hand out the menus. Warm chips and two kinds of salsa were put down before us (chunky and more of a puree) Both were hot and set my tastebuds up for what was to come. Note that they charge for refills on the chips and salsa which seemed odd to me given that is usually complimentary so know before you go!  We went with both of the server's recos- the steak burrito for my friend and the combo plate for me with steak and pork as my meats.  The food came up quickly. While the burrito was big and filled the plate- that was all there was- a burrito. I get that the rice and beans and ""stuff"" is on the inside- but the plate looked like it was missing something at least to my eyes that like a bounty of food on the plate.  My combo plate, on the other hand was beautiful in its visual appearance. A pork soft shelled taco with raw onions (hot and spicy) the tostada with steak topped with a dollop of sour cream, and the enchilada?

I had the Carna Asada a la Tampiquena, which came with the usual assortment of side toppings (beans, rice, cheese, veggies, tortillas, and a hot pepper). Although I've had cana asada that's been marinated with a better flavor, the meat itself was juicier and seemed to be of a better quality than other places I've tasted. My friend had the Fajita mix, which to me seemed too small to serve as an entree, but my friend said it was the right size, and it left him full. The crowd was mixed, split between families grabbing late dinner and the twenty-something South Side party crews tanking up before their night out. The service was ok, the waitress forgot my tortillas (oh the humanity!!!), but they were brought over once I got her attention. Overall I got the impression that this Mexican restaurant is for people who want Mexican but don't feel like going the extra mile over to Pilsen or Little Village. Overall, this placed seemed pretty good. I would go here again and maybe try something takeout to see how they rank on the quick and easy side. I heard they make good margaritas, but being the driver that night, I had to do without. My portion of the bill for food, drink, tax, and tip was $19. Approaching pricey, but any good dinner that I get change for a $20 bill is a plus on my end. Pros: Menu offers something for everyone, family friendly atmosphere, quick service.

Pancho's Pistolas seats many people, and on a Friday night this place is packed; however, the tables are placed well, and you won't feel crowded in. The average priced meals taste decidedly average. I would stay away from those if possible. If you are craving a taco or burrito, Taco Bell is the better place for you. What you really want to focus on are their house specialities, which are excellent. A plus to dining in the restaurant is that you get complimentary salsa and chips, but don't look for salsa and chips in your takeaway order because you won't get any. I often order over the phone and pick-up, and that particular service is a bit below average. I go in, tell each waitress my name and order, and wait and wait even though I can see my order on a ledge behind the counter.",0.8536,0.912,0.088,0.0,0.48503401360544224
2007-03-03,4.0,"I love the name of this restaurant. It's something that is just so easy for me to remember. Good Mexican food for the price, definitely. The place is pretty small for the amount of people that come in to eat. Expect a wait time.",0.9497,0.688,0.312,0.0,0.5619047619047619
2007-02-13,4.0,"This will sound weird, but it's better than 4 stars, but it's in no way 5 stars. If that makes sense to you, the uniqueness of this place becomes totally clear. You can have a massive marinated pork burrito, stuffed with cheese, onion, cilantro for just $4.95!!! The chips (which are complimentary) come with a unique non-tomato based salsa - which I actually like quite a bit. Don't sit right near the door in the winter, they need to work on that. Service is what you get for the price and value, but everything is made fresh (It doesn't get there in 30 seconds).   Other than Ricobene's one of the few reasons to ever go to the south side...contact me if you have better ones...",0.9616,0.81,0.16,0.031,0.5210034013605441
2007-01-30,5.0,"i don't know what some of the previous reviews are talking about.  although most of the waitresses are lithuanian (and this is due to the proximity of a lithuanian community in the area), the food is absolutely delicious and authentic!  as a matter of fact, the restaurant was recommended to me by my mexican friend who lived in bridgeport for a number of years.  he's moved further south, but he still visits the restaurant regularly.  the enchiladas are amazing, and the tacos (with cliantro and onion) are my favorite.  i want to try their shrimp cocktail on my next visit, and you can be sure that it won't be long.  street parking is not difficult to find at all.  you may have to wait for service during the weekends.",0.9672,0.822,0.178,0.0,0.5398199023199023
2006-07-07,4.0,"Pancho's Pistolas actually deserves 4 stars for overall ambience and drinks for a neighborhood place, but only 3 stars for authenticity (not that I really know any better, but lunch time meals ordered by Spanish speaking coworkers at delivery places that don't speak English or have any English on the menu has taught me a few things about Mexican cuisine).  Nevertheless, our favorite things to order are the chiles rellenos, shrimp cocktail (steamed shrimp in delicious lime and parsley infused cocktail sauce with chunks of tomatoes, onions, and avocado), and strawberry margaritas.  Honorable mentions (from friends) are carne asada, giant burrito (17 inch?), chicken fajitas, and  marinated pork tacos.  Great place to watch the Sox games.  They've opened up outside seating for the summer, but good bet to head to second floor (the stairs are on outside of the building).",0.9842,0.824,0.176,0.0,0.38421052631578945
2006-06-09,4.0,"I'm not sure this is really authentic mexican but it's pretty tasty.  For the real deal, you'd need to seek out greasy spoon hole in the wall type places.  Pancho's is too clean for that. My friends and I come here for their bargain margarita pitchers and what I consider to be some of the best chicken fajitas in town (the portions for fajitas are GIANORMOUS).  Service is okay - nothing exceptional but no complaints either.  It's great to come here and have a nice meal and drinks while watching the Sox on TV.  I was here along w/ the Telemundo news crew when the Sox were going for the championship last year.",0.9881,0.691,0.273,0.036,0.6311965811965812
