They try hard to be typical chicken joint but this honestly the worst I've ever had, it's sad that's in right in the loop so even tourists have to taste it.

2016-12-06,4.0,"I am totally not understanding the low reviews here! JJ has like the best fried chicken in the loop. Actually, it might be the only fried chicken in the loop aside from Popeyes. I am a huge fan! The chicken is always piping hot, made to order, fresh, AND they sprinkle lemon pepper seasoning on it for you and this just sends it right over the f*cking edge when doused in the hot sauce. Yall, even the fish is lit. The perch and the catfish are the best. JJ reminds me of my father and his fried meats and seafood. And, its all reasonably priced. It gets cramped, and can be a bit of a wait since meals are made to order, but its so worth it. Try the cakes too. Notably the red velvet and caramels.",0.9419,0.854,0.146,0.0,0.5913533834586467

I'd suggest going for the catfish nuggets and shrimp lunch combo special they often have, for about $7 with soggy fries to meander through for the last 45 minutes of your American mid-day break.
