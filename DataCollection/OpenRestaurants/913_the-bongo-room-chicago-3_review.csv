The pros about the entire experience was that the ingredients were fresh and the chief has crazy talent - the egg portion of the omelet was just so fully and light.   The only vice would be the spiciness of the chorizo and paying $13 for this dish, although the homefries made up for the cost - tasted so good. I took the pink (or orange) line to the restaurant.  Once outside, I made a left and Bingo Room is located at the corner of the street.  Don't bother driving unless you plan on using a parking garage or metered at the park.

Granted the last time I tried it was over 5/6 years ago but this time was well worth the trip. I met friends there. By the way, we all had infants and toddlers and they were kind enough to place a ton of waters in To go containers on the table, so, the toddlers wouldn't spill. (^19 cool points ) I couldn't decide on what I wanted and narrowed it down to two different French Toast options, Lemon brioche and the Chocolate tower. To my surprise, they'll let you buy one of each and create your own meal of sorts. Yeap, that SOLD me! This is the perfect place if you're like me and have to have a bite of everything. Next time, I'm going for the BLT benny or perhaps I'll try the lobster omelette.  I only gave it 4 stars because the Chocolate French toast looked like it would be amazing ,but, it wasn't. The bread used to make it just gave it a different flavor. (Maybe you'll like it. )Then, the eggs were overcooked and lacked any seasoning at all. Overall great experience,good staff, & a great time.

I came with a group of gal pals on a Saturday for brunch and we loved this spot. Obviously, we had heard of its popularity, but were willing to wait for a brunch that was worth it. They let us drink mimosas while waiting for our table, so we didn't mind. They have a plethora of different flavors - I went with raspberry & pear. One of my friends for the black raspberry & grapefruit, which also was pretty great. Mimosas as a classic, but it was fun to have a fancy little spin! Depending on the day you go, you can get either the breakfast menu, or the breakfast AND brunch menu (I suggest going on a weekend to snag one of the brunch menus) I ended up getting the Deconstructed Lobster Roll Benedict and it was fabulous! They make a great hollandaise and the eggs were perfectly poached. The only reason I give this place 4 instead of 5 stars is that the amount of food is a little smaller for what you pay. My benedicts came with two and some potatoes, and after everything I was still a little hungry (but didn't want to pay $4.95 for some fruit).

2017-07-09,3.0,I was a HUGE fan of The Bongo Room because of their Wicker Park and Uptown locations (my favorite is still Uptown). I recently moved apartments and found out that I live right by the South Loop location. I was ecstatic at first but ended up being disappointed.  This location isn't as aesthetically pleasing as the other ones and looks kind of sketchy from the outside. I've been here a couple times and wasn't wowed with the food like I was before. They change their menus every now and then and I was so bummed to learn that they got rid of their banana pancakes. I don't understand why they only keep the white chocolate pretzel and red velvet pancakes. I now get the chorizo avocado omelette which is a pretty good portion but kind of pricey ($13.75). I usually eat half and then save the other half for another meal. The service is very good here though!,0.932,0.773,0.16,0.067,0.5158276643990929

My friend had a build your own omelette and she didn't want potatoes so they substituted tomatoes which I thought was nice. I've had the croissant sandwich before and that is also stellar. Our server was attentive and helpful. He let me know about the pancakes because it wasn't on the menu. We went at 8:45am and only a couple tables were filled.

2017-06-11,3.0,"This is a really cute place, but the cons outweighed the pros in our case.  *** Pros: delicious brunch (try the lobster roll Benedict!), quick turnaround between ordering and receiving your meal. People watching was delightful. Also super convenient to CTA transit.  *** Cons: wait times can be long. There's also no real waiting area to speak of, so if you're averse to being bumped by strangers, maybe consider waiting outside. We waited about 25-30 minutes on a Sunday at 11 so not *that* bad, but if you're starving, eat a snack before you go. Another thing we noticed was inconsistency with table readiness. For instance, we arrived and put our name in, and 10 minutes later another couple put theirs in. This couple was seated right away while other couples were still waiting. They don't take reservations, and they tell guests that it's first-come, first-served. Next, the hostess called a guests name, this guest said ""the rest of the party is just around the corner"". The remaining guests didn't arrive until 10 minutes later, so the restaurant held this table for them when it should've been given to other parties who were all present and had been waiting just as long, especially since they explicitly say they won't seat until the whole party has arrived. The atmosphere is also quite loud. It's a small space, with all hard surfaces, so every sound is just bouncing rather than being absorbed by anything. It will be difficult to hear your fellow diners. Finally, none of the staff looked happy at all to be there. From the hosts to the servers and the bussers, not a single person smiled the entire time we were there. They all looked like they were being managed to quickly get guests in and out as quickly as possible without being allowed to enjoy their jobs. While I appreciate fast service, I prefer happy servers if I'm out. Management, take care of your people! The stress levels in there were palpable.  Overall, not a bad experience.

After perusing the menu, which had tons of delicious sounding sweet and savory items, I ordered the croissant breakfast sandwich (bacon, muenster, and one egg any style on a croissant with a side of potatoes). My husband tried to order the chocolate French toast tower, but the waiter said they had run out. No problem, he went with the vanilla cinnamon French toast instead. Our food came out pretty quick and was really tasty. The French toast was especially good: the vanilla cream on top was heavenly, although they definitely skimped on the sautéed apples (there were only 4 thinly sliced pieces on top). The croissant sandwich was delicious too, just what I expected with a perfectly cooked over medium egg. The potatoes were redskins with lots of herbs; it was a little too herby for me, but my husband devoured it. Then, the snag. The couple sitting right next to us also ordered the croissant sandwich, and the lady found a hair in her food. She told the nearest waitstaff, who whisked the plate away. A few moments later, our waiter appeared, but he didn't apologize to her at all. He just wandered around our tables and then went back to his station, pulled out his phone, and started playing with it. Very unprofessional.

I was expecting a bit more in terms of atmosphere-it's a pretty bare-bones diner feel, with old chairs, small tables, etc.  It wasn't dirty or anything, just very basic decor.  The tables are packed pretty tightly in there, as it's not a large space (as in, I could have reached over and taken a forkful of the breakfast of the person at the table next to me, who I didn't know).  And it was quite warm in there-we were sitting by the side door and they had it propped open to get a breeze going, but it helped only minimally. The food was amazing, so that lived up to expectations.  I had the White Chocolate Caramel Pretzel Pancakes, which I've been dreaming of for years, and they were amazing.  Not too sweet, and the crunch of the pretzels in the pancakes was a nice touch.  It was way too much to eat at once, so I got leftovers.  My friend enjoyed her BLT Benedict as well.

2017-05-11,4.0,"Looking for a good brunch spot, I stopped here with some coworkers on a weekday morning. We were seated immediately and the service was quite fast which was very convenient for us.  I ordered a freshly squeezed grapefruit juice, which is always a refreshing start. There were so many amazing options to choose from, so we decided to order a large selection to share amongst the table. The Chorizo, Potato, Avocado Omelette was delicious and a great savory option. The Breakfast Burrito was probably one of my favorite dishes. We ordered it with chorizo as well for a more filling meal. I enjoyed how both were served with ample amounts of salsa and roasted potatoes.  The Pumpkin and Spice Pancakes were definitely more of a dessert dish. I'm glad we all shared, because it was so sweet and rich that I could not have eaten an entire plate on my own. Even with the four of us we couldn't finish these sweet pancakes completely covered in vanilla glaze. My favorite pancakes though were the Caramelized Pear Pancakes. They were just the right amount of sweet and tangy. They were also somehow crisp and fluffy at the same time. It reminded me a little of an apple crisp.

It's not that they have poor food or service, both are reasonable, but this place is not worth the hype or wait. We came here on a super busy Saturday for brunch, snagged a table after 40 min of waiting, which is very normal for them. Their menu was not changed from the last time I came, which was disappointing. It is small, and I didn't feel attracted to any of the options. I think the sweet options are definitely better here, but paying $14 for a stack of 3 gourmet pancakes when Yolk and its delicious large portions are just around the corner seems off. I got the breakfast burrito this time, and found myself regretting it. Not that it was bad, but the ""burrito"" was plain scrambled eggs wrapped in a green tortilla with salsas on the side. Bland, boring, and the potatoes on the side were not flavorful and really messily cut and cooked. Hm. My friend's red velvet pancakes were delicious, but pancakes need a side of fruit to not be overwhelmingly sweet. Service is quick and awesome, but this place is just an average, pricey brunch spot.

The most important part of the review. The food.. I ordered red velvet pancakes and eggs with potatoes. The red velvet pancakes were not as good as they sound. They were thick, gummy and covered in a creamy sauce and garnished with walnuts or pecans. The potatoes were really good they had a lot of cheeses to choose from with an over medium egg. It was nothing special. My boyfriend on the other hand ordered an omelette with potatoes with Gouda. He really liked his food but he said he wouldn't go back simply because the food was only good and overly priced.  In all, I will probably never go back.

2016-11-08,4.0,"""Do you have any blood orange juice today?"" That's what an insider like me once asked at the original Bongo Room, having heard someone ask the question the first time I went there. Their space occupied the El side half of Stan's Donuts on Damen. I had never tasted blood orange juice before, and it was sure sweet. Probably even sweeter, feeling like I was in on the secret. It didn't seem too much longer after that that they opened their location on Milwaukee Avenue that must have been four or five times as large. I shook my head, thinking that the surefire way for your restaurant to fail is to expand too quickly. It got so popular that I didn't go there too often anymore. Sunday I Divvied by the South Loop location around 1 pm and I only saw a few people milling about outside so I decided that it was time to try it once again. The price of the coffee is highway robbery now ($3.50), though they'll give you a mug while you're waiting and refills like any respectable breakfast place and the coffee is still good. The menu hasn't changed too much, though the breakfast burrito is still as tasty as it ever was, and that was a time where breakfast burritos were still a relatively new thing. The one mistake I made was visiting the place alone. In the past, I've always tried to visit with someone who is willing to equally share two dishes: one savory and one sweet. (Not one of you people who only will give a taste and call it ""sharing,"" and you know who you are!) It would be nice if they had offered a half & half option, a little like a half a sandwich with soup or salad, only without the sandwich or the soup or the salad--I think you get what I mean.  In any case, I'm glad they're still around after all of these years, the lack of change in the menu notwithstanding.

My boyfriend and I shared the red velvet - also pretty good. Only complaint about the pancakes is that the bottom was  a bit touch and chewy, but the cream cheese topping they put on top was the perfect balance to the sweet velvet pancakes.  I would definitely try and come back for their brunch offering but the regular breakfast menu was nothing spectacular.",0.9923,0.712,0.263,0.025,0.5680836707152498

The host was incredibly rude and actually suggested that maybe we eat somewhere else after getting into an argument with one of the members in our group. As a note, they insist that all members of the party order at the same time and are very inflexible with this.  I tried the chocolate French toast tower that was recommended on Yelp and thought that was actually pretty good. The bread is stuffed with a chocolate filling that was particularly yummy! However, very good French toast should be crispy on the outside and this was a little soggy (see unflattering picture). The lobster Benedict was no good either. Nothing special. Did not taste very lobstery - the meat was all shredded and tossed into some sort of lobster salad. Egg was overdone. I tried a friends pancakes and while the sauce and toppings were good the pancakes themselves were dense and doughy tasting. Good pancakes should be light as air.   Overall not very enjoyable as a brunch spot, which should be a nice relaxing friendly environment to enjoy delicious foods.",0.9857,0.714,0.219,0.067,0.5013320653705269

I came here for brunch after hearing great things from a friend whom I respect greatly in terms of knowing good eats, and because of the numerous great Yelp reviews.   I ordered the vegetarian croissant sandwich. Lots of veggies, not enough sauce, and my croissant seemed to be a tad bit stale (it was pretty difficult to bite into). I would have liked if some of the greens were cooked because the entire sandwich was pretty much just a bunch of raw vegetables slapped onto a croissant with an egg. I suppose that I got what was written on the menu, I just think execution could have been better. Also, I asked for a poached egg and they told me it would take 25 minutes.... (25 minutes to poach an egg?! Seemed to me like they just didn't want to make me one :( ) My friend got the breakfast burrito. She said it was plain but okay.  Neither of us finished our meals but didn't ask for to go boxes.  Overall I give this place a 3/5 because it wasn't bad. The wait staff was friendly. Our food came our quickly.

The croissant was supposed to be grilled, but the only grill action this sandwich saw was perhaps looking at the grill longingly as it went out of the kitchen. It was a uncooked croissant that was too chewy to enjoy. The house potatoes served alongside the sandwich were a different story! They were delicious - made even more so by the addition of cheese (only 75 cents extra!). These potatoes saved the day!  The other people at my table ordered pancakes and French toast.

Order by Instagram, and not what you're craving. The side of Thai chicken sausage was 3 or 4 links (like, the skinny small sausage kind) for $4.75 -- it was grossly overpriced and underflavored. While the omelette was brimming with meat, that was due to my friend's order and I think it ended up being $16 with the custom changes and she needed a ton of hot sauce to flavor it. My other friend did like her croissant sandwich - it was a good size and the croissant was quite sturdy.

2016-07-12,2.0,"How do you make sickening pancakes? I feel like I was tricked.  Pancakes are the best thing that EVER happened to breakfast and unless you pre-make batter or over cook a pancake it's almost impossible not to make them light and fluffy. Not sure how but The Bongo Room pancakes are dense, thick and chewy; and to say I was disappointed would be an immense understatement (Damn it Gina!). Bongo is located in the south loop in the old Roosevelt building. Therefore they cannot place awnings outside making the corner rather inconspicuous. The space is cozy and the dining room featured two and four tops with brightly colored chairs. We'd stalked the pictures and knew exactly what we wanted. I'm not a big egg person so I went with the pancakes because how can you get a pancake wrong; and with toppings like Meyer lemon, blueberry with crumble it had to be delicious? vine.co/v/M16zPExzi7w My 1st order was like rubber - could barley cut them with a knife. I must've had a WTF look on my face. My waitress stopped by I said they were tough and thick - she said they do that so it can hold toppings - I'm part of the pancakes should be light & fluffy crowd - so she went to have them remade. While I waited on my pancakes my chicken sausages just sat and got cold. The ""re-made"" cakes came out and I'll be DAMN - there was no difference. Still thick as a cinderblock and still as though as an uncared for rib eye steak. My orange juice was good and the waitress was very kind and swift.

Inside, large windows allow for plenty of natural light to shine in, beautifully lighting up the restaurant.  Service was smooth and staff were pleasant and attentive. I ordered the Lemon Brioche French Toast, my girlfriend ordered the pancakes (forgot the flavor). The serving sizes are really big. Neither of us were able to finish our dishes. My dish came with 3 big French toasts and hers came with 3 pancakes. The sauce was delicious but the French toast themselves were pretty normal. The pancakes are really dense and I personally didn't like it but my girlfriend really liked them. I was expecting the dish to be very sweet but it actually was very well balanced and enjoyable - not drowned in syrup like you would get at some other places. There's not much to complain about at The Bong Room, the only faults I noticed was the seats were a little hard and the menu selection was not as large as I was hoping.

The server that goes by ""Shrimply Pibbles"" on all her receipts and pregnant was not the norm for the location.  Yes, it was a holiday weekend but it did not seem to stop the other tables getting served normally. No refills on water, lack of follow up on the items that were actually ordered with her and how they were served. See pictures.  Left side is the normal way they are served on the right was how there were this last weekend.  We ordered the Deconstructed Lobster Roll Benedict. When asked about the missing hollandaise sauce, we were told we got what we ordered. She did bring out the sauce in a small dish and it was ice cold, and solid like to try and pour on to the dish. Then on the Chocolate Tower French Toast - as stated in their description from the menu. ""Bittersweet chocolate chuck bread stuffed with maple mascarpone, banana cream brûlée sauce, fresh bananas and shaved chocolate."" There was no sauce on the top or shaved chocolate, there was a very little amount of sauce on the bottom of the plate that toast sat on.

2016-05-30,2.0,"The four-star average rating The Bongo Room South Loop location currently has at the time of this review truly puzzles me. After having tried the food at The Bongo Room at the Wicker Park location (and having had a great experience), I was really excited to try out the South Loop location because it's much more convenient for me. Unfortunately, the next time I'm craving sugary goodness for brunch, I'm going to have to make the trek to Wicker Park because this South Loop location is disappointing.  Strike 1: There is barely any signage for the restaurant. When I saw that there were what looked like janky home-printed signs reading ""The Bongo Room"" in the windows, I assumed they must have just opened a few months ago. Not so. This location has been open for years. What gives? Super unappealing and unprofessional.  Strike 2: We put in our name and the wait was 45 minutes. No biggie. It was a Sunday at 11 AM and we were certainly prepared for a wait. They told us to check in again after 30 minutes in case people dropped from the list. We came back after 30 and were told it would be another 15 minutes. That was our original quote, so still no biggie. However, when we came back after waiting a total of 45 minutes the table was STILL not ready. We ended up having to wait another additional 10 minutes in the sun. They should have overquoted instead of underquoted for time. Or, perhaps a texting system like many other restaurants with long waits would have been appropriate.  Strike 3: My girlfriend is a food blogger so a major consideration when brunching is access to natural light. Usually we're able to request seating by a window or she can move to take a picture in good light before eating. There was none here because all of the blinds were drawn. But the lack of natural light thing is not even a strike. Even though it was a beautiful day outside, it was dark and HOT inside. There was no air conditioning on for some godforsaken reason. It was also super cramped with tables pushed as closely together as possible. With the heat, it was bad.  You're out: Our waitress was unattentive, offering us the BARE minimum. She stopped by to take orders, bring out our food, and the check. She never dropped by asking if we needed anything. Our waters were never refilled (bad because it was hot). To make matters worse, the chocolate french toast ""tower"" was extremely disappointing and looked nothing like any of the pictures of the dish on Yelp. They were clearly out of a few ingredients and just left them off.  The only saving grace of the entire meal was that the white chocolate salted caramel pancakes were good and as I remembered having them at the Wicker Park location. Everything else was disappointing. I had high hopes for The Bongo Room, but this will not be the go-to brunch place in the Loop I was hoping it might be.",0.93,0.863,0.084,0.053,0.5108597883597885

The wait ended up being closer to 45 minutes which was a little annoying. We would have ordered coffee or something during the wait but it was apparently $3.50 for a plain cup and I really wanted Oj but it was maybe $5. So that was a little bit of a rip-off.  However, our food did arrive pretty quickly so that was a bit of a help. I made my own omelet with avocado, mushrooms, mozzarella and sausage, and got some pretty tasty russet potatoes on the side.

I felt like I was back in high school lunch hour C with the bell ringing!  Okay the food.... The food was an ""okay"" bland American breakfast the kind they would serve to in a nursing home. No seasonings just the good ole American way of throwing a piece of cheese on it and tasteless oil.  I will give this place another chance during the week when it's not busy and try a different dish.

Bongo Room delivers on that. They have hands down one of the best menus in the city. Mom visiting? Take her here. Old college roommates? Take them here. Third wheeling on a friend's date? Come here. It's really to die for.  When you come make sure you go either when they first open or close to closing. They are always packed. You can buy hot chocolate and coffee at the bar while you wait. There is not much waiting room inside either, which means you will have to wait outside. Don't assume that if its raining it won't be busy, because it will be.  The service is a little off, but literally the food is killer. You have to order the white chocolate pretzel pancakes or croissant sandwich. The potatoes are incredible. Oh and the OJ is fresh so it's delicious. The only downside to this place, it tends to get a little too warm inside, and the volume is pretty high. Additionally I don't know who picked out the table and chairs, but if you over 5'8"" you will be hunched over. Very uncomfortable. But the food is so good it makes up for everything!

We ordered the  Chocolate Tower French Toast (Ctft), White Chocolate and Caramel Pretzel Pancakes (Wccp), Red Velvet Hotcake (rvh), and finally the Deconstructed Lobster Roll Benedict (Dlrb). I liked each of these dishes with the exception of the Rvh because the 'hot cakes' are too dry. The Wccp was the best dish by far. However, with both pancake dishes, my recommendation would be to order 2 pancakes instead of the standard 3 because the ratio of pancakes to syrup is overwhelming (esp with Rvh). The Dlrb dish was terrific-potatoes were well done and seasoned. As with most other dishes, the Dlrb wasn't large enough for two people.

The wait was anticipated, and the hostesses knew what they were doing and did their best to value their customers and sit them as quickly as they could. Between the two of us, we each got an entree and split a stack of pancakes. Definitely more food then we needed, but we couldn't resist; the best part of their menu is definitely the Sinful Section. The only flaw from everything that we had gotten off the menu was that whoever rolled my breakfast burrito did not seem to know what they were doing. The first few bites of the burrito I only got guacamole. Then all I got was eggs. Then eggs with the salsa and cream cheese. I ended up opening it up and mixing the stuff around and rolling it back up. Other than that everything was tasty and delicious.

Quite a long time, but at least I was engaged in entertaining conversation. After my friend and I sat down, the server at the table next to us, proceeded to back up and spill a LOT of water all over my side of the table, my coat (which was on my lap), me, and the floor. (I was happy she hadn't spilled a pot of coffee on me.) Lots of mopping ensued, as did an apology, while I remained extremely calm. It would've been appropriate for our server / the restaurant to offer me a free breakfast or SOMETHING out of that mess -- that water had gone everywhere -- but no one ever did.  My small strawberry lemonade was $4.50 and no refills? The waiter, a seemingly nice guy, just laid our bill on the table without asking us if we wanted anything else. And the food was just okay. I seem to be in the minority here regarding The Bongo Room's food: Had I ordered something more exotic, maybe I'd be saying something interesting about the food, but I ordered Eggs Benedict.

The Lobster Roll Eggs Benedict was just as good as it sounds, but the real MVP were the roasted potatoes on the side. Crunchy yet buttery yet flavorful all at the same time!

I explained the scene outside was not pleasant and the person told me not to worry about it. I had to further explain watching it while trying to eat would be difficult as it was pretty stomach churning. - They spilled water on my side of the table and on my phone, offering no apology, just walking on.

2016-01-24,4.0,"If Yolk earned three stars from me, The Bongo Room has to earn four! This was hands down my favorite breakfast during the trip and a wonderful start to my day. The Bongo Room is a breakfast joint and bruncherie with a few locations scattered around Chicago. Their menu is rather limited. However, TBR compensates for this scarcity of menu options by offering well-made breakfast staples featuring their own little twists. This is especially evident in the seasonally-changing pancake and french toast menu. Customers will occasionally encounter interesting creations such as heath bar pancakes and cranberry/orange pancakes with vanilla cream and crumbled gingersnaps.  I personally prefer my breakfasts savory rather than sweet. I initially wanted some sort of benedict. Much to my dismay, TBR only offers that during weekends. I ended up with the vegetarian croissant sandwich and some cheesy house potatoes ( yelp.com/biz_photos/the-… ) The sandwich was super delicious! They split a toasted croissant and crammed it with sprouts, tomatoes, spinach, cheese, and a fried egg. The cheese is typically melted muenster but they gladly substituted goat cheese upon my request. I loved the contrasting textures and the taste was also very good. The only real drawback for me was that the sandwich was on the messier side. As for those herbed house potatoes, I loved them. The white cheddar cheese was a nice touch as well.  My two friends ordered pancakes and liked their orders to a degree. I tried a few bites. The health bar pancake legitimately tasted like a heath bar but it was too sweet for me. As for their red velvet pancake, we all thought it wasn't sweet enough which was odd.  Service was just ok. People stopped by infrequently. They weren't even busy that day... Customers that require alcohol will be disappointed. This location is the only one that doesn't serve booze.  Regardless, The Bongo Room is definitely worth checking out.

The pretzels added a nice crunchy texture to the pancake and the white chocolate and caramel layer on top of the pancake was heavenly. It wasn't terribly sweet so it was very manageable to finish the pancake.

You can get it anywhere though-- try something more unique. White Chocolate & Caramel Pretzel Pancakes (special menu) - For the table. These were EXTREMELY sweet and slathered in the sauce. Nobody was able to have more than a bite or 2. But they were good. Normal Croissant Sandwich & Breakfast Potatoes- Was devoured and a fan favorite. Just as messy as the veggie one- so beware of your surroundings. Drinks- lots of alcoholic options: Baileys & Coffee + Black Raspberry/Grapefruit Mimosas were the groups drinks of choice.

We had a very late start to the day, and arrived around 1pm on a Saturday. Despite the fact that we arrived one hour prior to closing time, this place was still packed. Both of us enjoy brunch, but have always found it a little on the heavy side, so we ordered the BLT Benedict and one (very huge) red velvet pancake. I really liked how they offered an option for you to choose how many pancakes you wanted (ranging from 1-3), since I always tend to over-order when it comes to brunch. I actually really enjoyed the BLT Benedict - the basil pesto hollandaise sauce gave the poached eggs and spinach just the flavor they needed. The red velvet pancake wasn't very heavy, which I was grateful for, and provided the rest of our savory brunch with a good amount of sweetness.

2015-12-05,2.0,"I frequent the other locations in Wicker Park and Andersonville. It's unfortunate this location lacks the professionalism of the other locations. I give this 2 stars only because I will continue to eat at the other locations.  I have eaten at the South Loop restaurant three times in the past 6 weeks. Problem #1 - we requested  a table for 3 and mentioned we had a friend arriving late. We said we were going to order right away. We were told they would make an exception and seat us, but they usually wait until all the people in our party are present. They weren't busy! In fact the restaurant was only half capacity. Our server wasn't too happy and noticeably annoyed we were taking up a table.  Problem #2 - As a vegetarian, I haven't had any problems ordering dishes without meat. I had the Tamitillo Egg Scramble without the chicken. It tasted like watered down eggs with absolutely no flavor. When I asked the server to take it, I asked if the lack of flavor was due to not ordering chicken. She said yes and proceeded to tell me she knew that when I ordered. Why didn't she mention it at the time? She took my plate but didn't offer me an alternative dish. I had to ask for a HALF order of pancakes.  Problem #3 -  Our friend arrived and quickly ordered a simple cheese omelette. She received an egg white omelette... Not sure how that was lost in translation. She asked the server to take it away and remove it from the bill.  Ultimately, we were charged for 4 entrees! Three of which shouldn't have been charged. We paid it anyway but asked to speak to the manager on the way out. We stated the facts and although he apologized, he made an excuse that the restaurant gets loud and it's hard to hear orders. Was it our fault?  My friend is acquaintances with the owner. In fact they are clients of hers. Interesting... the manager disregarded that comment. She plans on relaying her experience at this location. They just lost 3 customers and probably more since we work in the area.",-0.901,0.807,0.08,0.113,0.5342385912698413

Against all normal brunch ordering habits, I decided to go with the veggie croissant sandwich, which let me tell you, may be the most the most underappreciated thing on their breakfast menu -- because you can add bacon to it. A grilled buttery croissant stuffed melted muenster, tomato, spinach and lotsa other veggies,  basil mayo, and the other KEY ingredient (besides bacon): a poached egg on top.

The front door service was excellent. They have a coffee bar where you can hang out while you wait for your table. That was nice. And the coffee was perfect.  After a minimal 15 min or so wait (this was a Saturday morning), I was seated. The wait staff was perfectly pleasant. I really wanted to try one of their French toast options, but I went with an omelette. I got bacon, spinach, and smoked Gouda. The omelette came with potatoes and toast. The omelette was literally whole pieces of raw baby spinach, big slices of bacon, and some Gouda thrown in the middle of an egg. Eh. I get that this is an omelette, but the presentation was lacking and I wasn't impressed. I make better omelettes at home and cooking breakfast isn't my forte. But, I digress. The potatoes were ok and the toast was toast. The best thing I had was the coffee and the worst thing I got was a phone call regarding my repair estimate.

2015-11-12,4.0,"I have never, ever been a fan of the sweet breakfast. Everywhere I go for brunch, I thrive on benedicts, omelettes, quiche, fried chicken, etc. I've been known to eat hamburgers for breakfast but I stay the heck away from pancakes and waffles because when I wake up, I do not want gallons of sugar going down my throat. The Bongo Room is the only place I have ever broken this rule and dang, it was 100% worth it.  We arrived on a Saturday morning to a 45 minute wait - not bad.  The coffee bar in the waiting area is great not only because it gives you something to do, but also because when you're 40 people crowded into a restaurant waiting area on a hot summer day, they give you endless water, which is much appreciated. The restaurant itself has a lovely, clear, sunny atmosphere. We sat a table in the middle (which I usually don't like) and were treated to endless amounts of gorgeous sunlight. Our waitress was friendly, polite, and fast-moving. We were never a table that had been left hanging.  I broke my sugar-for-breakfast rule for the strawberry-banana-passionfruit pancakes. Oh my God, these were everything I could have asked for and more. They were so FRUITY. I refused to add any syrup because the tart-sweet-creaminess of the passionfruit mousse was the most amazing topping for the pancakes. I wanted to lick it off the plate. The strawberries and bananas were plentiful (though I wished they were in the pancakes themselves - a banana pancake topped with strawberries and this passionfruit JOY mousse is the only way I could see to make this dish even better). As a result, I ended up with an amazing, tropical, sweet-tart, light and fluffy pancake dish that I wish I could eat daily. My friend got the vegetarian croissant sandwich and an iced coffee -- both were also great The croissant sandwich was packed with fillings and very flavorful. The coffee was excellent.  Altogether, a great brunch experience.  PS - they don't do takeout on the weekends, which is a bummer.",0.9975,0.742,0.214,0.044,0.5717320261437909

I was visiting Chicago with a vegetarian friend and had woken up at 4 AM to make the Friday morning flight, so I was pretty famished.  I ordered an egg white omelet (not omelette? I'm uncertain) with goat cheese and veggies. It came with a side of potatoes and my choice of bread. The omelette was good, up to a point. The ingredients inside were segmented in a way that made the front end of the omelet exclusively goat cheese, the middle stewing spinach, etc. Like imagine opening up the omelet to find it soaked in spinach water, with the pile of spinach still sitting there. It just wasn't appetizing past the goat cheese bite. I didn't even try to salvage it with Cholula - the vegetables and associated water had done the damage. The potatoes were quite tasty. They were very different, and reminded me of some potatoes I had had for dinner a few years ago. I believe they were seasoned with dill, which was interesting.

My bf and I both agreed that these pancakes were hands down, THE BEST pancakes that we have EVER had!!!!! It's even one of the reasons why we want to come back to Chicago!

2015-09-02,5.0,"Out of the 4 days I stayed in Chicago, the Bongo Room has to be my favorite brunch spot. My sister told me that I was not allowed to return to New York until I tried this place out. I wanted to go to the original Wicker Park location, but it was a little out of the reach for me so I went to the Southside location. As busy as it was, we only waited about 20 minutes to get a table for 2. Chicago portion size is ginormous! I did not see one person leave without a take-out box. We were smart about it and the waitress allowed us to order single pancakes so we can try multiple flavors (which is not advertised on the menu directly). It's a little more expensive but way worth it for foodies like me. For this place, I say stick to the pancakes. They were the fluffiest pancakes I have ever eaten. I love this place so much that I came back twice during my vacation. I used to think Clinton Street Baking Company in New York was the best pancakes I ever had, but this place blows them out of the water. 1 - The pineapple jack pancakes with vanilla bean cream was our personal favorite. It looks plain in pictures, but I guarantee this was the best thing invented by mankind.  2 - The strawberry banana pancakes with passionfruit cream was another favorite (especially the cream), but I felt the flavoring of the strawberries overpowered the dish.  3 - White chocolate with berry dressing french toast special was another good option. It was very pretty to look at and the size was again, huge! I was afraid that it was going to be too sweet for me, but surprisingly it was not. I wished they cut the bread into smaller slices so the batter would cover the entire inside of the bread or if they dipped the bread into the batter a little bit longer so it wouldn't be as dry inside. FYI: another option where you can order just a single slice of toast instead of the full size.  4 - The Veggie Croissant was also great option considering that we didn't eat much veggies on this trip. It had the most buttery croissant I have ever tasted (very french style...which I enjoyed) filled with melted muenster cheese, baby spinach, tomato slices, sautéed mushroom, cucumber, alfalfa sprouts & scallions topped with an egg with basil mayo served with house potatoes.  This place really lives up to the thousand reviews! Totally worth my 1.5 mile walk.",0.9975,0.828,0.169,0.003,0.502852998065764

She heard that we were moving to Chicago and told us the Bongo Room was a MUST GO TO restaurant. She said it was one of the best brunch places she's ever been to. And, the Bongo Room definitely met our expectations.  We love how friendly and homey this restaurant is. Although we had to wait a while to get a seat at the bar, it was definitely worth the wait. We were served immediately upon seating. We highly recommend the Chocolate French Toast Tower and the BLT Benedict. Keep in mind the portion sizes are HUGE! Each dish can serve 2 people. We had lots of left overs to eat for breakfast the next day. Also, the dishes come out FAST. We probably waited about 5-10 minutes before our dishes came out. Talk about great service, especially after our wait time.   Keep in mind that the location in Wicker Park gets really crowded early. Come early!

I had the deconstructed lobster roll benedict, which I highly recommend to seafood lovers.  The lobster was cooked perfectly and really worked well with the hollandaise sauce.  When done well, lobster is probably my favorite meat and I definitely feel like they did it justice.    My group also ordered a chocolate tower french toast, which was gigantic and more than enough for the three of us.  The chocolate tower adds a great touch of sweetness to a savory main course and so I recommend that as well - but beware, it really is big so you might be better off ordering it as a side unless you have at least three people sharing it. The waitress was very patient and took the time to split the cost of one item (The Chocolate Tower) among three of us and adding it to the separate tabs for our individual orders.  Even with the hour plus wait, this was a highly enjoyable experience worthy of five stars.",0.9975,0.722,0.257,0.021,0.5133333333333334

The pineapple upside flapjacks are also not bad--nicely flavored with cranberries and a hint of pineapple without being overly sweet; however, the portions are seriously huge, so I would recommend going for the 1 or 2 stack pancake option.  I've also had the chorizo omelette, which was by far my least favorite dish. The chorizo was far too salty, and the omelette simply lacked balance between chorizo and egg.

Luckily, they give you the option to ordered just 1 or 2 pancakes if you want and I would suggest doing so if you choose one of the specialty pancakes.  Otherwise, great service and reasonable prices! Update 3/13/16: Tried the White Chocolate Pretzel Pancakes and in they did not live up to the hype compared to the reviews.

The waitress answered my questions and allowed me time to review the menu.  I decided to go with the Vanilla Bean French Toast and 2 eggs, bacon, and potatoes. I asked for the sauce on the side as I thought it was going to be way too damn sweet. But I was wrong. The flavored go together nicely and there is a hint of lemon. I started with one piece. Ended up ordering a second. (Don't judge me...I'm on vacation!) My food came out quickly which was a surprise. But sadly so quick my first piece of French Toast was cold. I'm not one to complain. So I ate it anyhoo. When the waitress asked I did tell her it was cold and she was very apologetic.  Greedy me ordered another.

The French toast was phenomenal and the berry assortment on top complimented the toast perfectly. I would only suggest adding a bit of whipped cream to complete the flavor profile. I also ordered a customized veggie croissant breakfast sandwich. The smoked white cheddar I substituted was an AMAZING addition. The basil mayo was my second favorite part of the meal. And the croissant itself was thee BEST one I've EVER had in life. Super buttery and flaky. The only thing I wasn't particularly fond of was the potatoes. I usually like crispy home fries.

2015-07-27,5.0,"[Out-of-Towner Review] This will be my first breakfast when I'm back in Chicago. I love breakfast, but I am a crazy traditionalist when it comes to the delicacy that starts off your day. Two eggs, toast, potatoes, and coffee make me the happiest person ever. That or a breakfast sandwich, which is essentially half of those items put together to make a heavenly sandwich. So, to be recommended to this little, very non-descript breakfast spot, I didn't know what I had in store. We arrived 10 minutes before it opened and we were third in line. I knew from that moment on, we were probably in for a treat. As soon as it opened the servers and busers were lined up to take each party back to the dining area. Again, if you were to look at this place, you may think it was a generic cafeteria. Everything is made with the bright, light colored wood (think IKEA), concrete walls, with splashed of blue and green. I wasn't judging this book, by its cover...I was just taking it all in. The menu isn't huge, but now I know why it doesn't have to be. I, as usual, went for the Croissant Sandwich. It is always what I'll go with when I want to be a little more adventurous for breakfast. J loves sweet for breakfast, but he wasn't too sure about pretzels in his pancakes. But after speaking with our server, she assured him this  decision was what many others make on a daily basis. I don't do sweets for breakfast, but I probably stole more than my fair share of his White Chocolate & Carmel Pretzel Pancakes that morning. Event typing the name I feel like I'll get a cavity. However, by some magical stroke of genius  they've created a pancake that isn't overly sweet, with just the right amount of sweetness and fluff! Seriously, these pancakes look like they are dripping in sugar, but once you take a bite, you are transcended into whatever pancakes in Heaven should taste like. The blend of the white chocolate and caramel, combined with the fluffy (not too dense) pancake, sprinkled with bits of pretzel is something that I can't even begin to describe. I also shouldn't forget to talk about my actual breakfast, not go on an done about the one I kept stealing. The croissant was amazing, buttery and flakey, just how I love them. I opted for egg whites and they were not shy with their portions. I did not like the potatoes, they were too 'wet' for my liking, but had great seasoning and flavors. If they were crispy, they would have been the equivalent to breakfast crack! Sadly, I left most of them on my plate. Both breakfast portions were huge, sadly we couldn't finish either of them to their entirety. We both also ordered the Intelligentsia coffee, which we was also recommended to us by the same person. We enjoyed way too many cups of this caffeinated goodness, they even provided soy milk at no cost (follow suit CA)! It was basically packed since opening, but they have so many people working your coffee cup never gets empty, your food comes out fast, and their kitchen is killing it back there. It is a well oiled machine, that not only knows how to manage the breakfast rush, but their dishes already speak for themselves.

I guess breakfast/brunch isn't as big in Chicago as it is in SF. Came here to try the Lobster Roll Benedict and it was good, but not fantastic/wow/great. The potatoes that came with my benedict were also underwhelming -- they tasted like they potatoes had been boiled first and then hastily (and poorly) seared to get some color on them. Boyfriend had the Chocolate Tower Pancakes and felt it was too sweet. It looked great, but I guess that's as far as ""great"" went.

If you're in the mood for some sweet cakes and portions enough to fill you up, this is the place for ya. Busy atmosphere and the service was up to par. The hostess quoted my boyfriend and I a wait of 30 to 40 minutes so we hung out outside for a bit and were called in after waiting 10 to about 15 minutes which we were happy about since we were dying to eat after hearing such positive reviews about this place (and because we were starving).  We came on a busy Saturday morning and decided that we were going to split some pancakes and order our own individual dish (preferably a savory item). We ordered the half-size of the Pumpkin Spice Pancake with the toppings on the side, An egg-white omelette with spinach, mushroom, broccoli, onion, and green onion (keep in mind it's $1 extra after the 3 ingredients included) and an omelette with sausage, cheese, and another ingredient I can't recall.  The waitress was very friendly and was patience with us considering it was our first time here. The food arrived 20 minutes after we had placed our order and we noticed that the whipped cream for the pancakes wasn't delivered with the rest of our food. The man that dropped off the food wasn't aware of it but when we had asked, he seemed impatient about it but it didn't phase us from our experience so far (just kinda something to awkwardly laugh about).  SO ABOUT THE FOOD....let's just say it was pretty amazing. My egg white omelette was STUFFED. They definitely weren't stingy about fattening that thing up. The potatoes it came with were good but I was never a fan of  dill as a seasoning. They got my boyfriend's omelette order wrong and ended up throwing some broccoli in his but it didn't bother him (or so he says since he picked them out). And last but not least....the cakes. I'm so glad we ordered the toppings on the side because I felt that if it were on top, it would have been too sweet BUT since we were able to control our whipped cream intake with each bite...it was one of the best pancakes I've had. Wasn't too sweet, it was just right. Also, the whipped cream was kinda cold which was a nice combination with the warm pancakes.

I must admit, I thought the menu would be larger but there were plenty of options to choose from between their savory and sweet items. While I know this place is known for their unique pancakes, I'm more of a savory breakfast with kind of girl so I went with the breakfast burrito. The sauce on top, I think a chipotle type sour cream, was so good! The burrito was huge and very filling. The breakfast potatoes were nothing special, actually could have done without them. One of my friends got their chorizo omelette and said it was some of the best chorizo he's had and the least greasy. My other friend enjoyed her cross isn't sandwich. Service was good, coffee and water refilled regularly. This place was good, don't get me wrong but a bit overhyped. I would not wait for two hours on a weekend to eat here. What did impress me was their reaction to my friend breastfeeding her 6 month old daughter, in that they had no reaction. It was no big deal.

Lobster roll benedict ($15): I love lobster rolls and eggs benedict, so this dish was a no-brainer, and Bongo Room does it justice. The eggs were perfectly done every time, and the buttery biscuits are perfect with the lobster and mayo. One of my favorite eggs benedict, definite winner! Apple brioche french toast ($13.50): Exactly what you'd expect, thick cut brioche with warm sauteed apples and cranberries. I'm glad the french toast was thick cut, because it was absolutely doused in a decadent vanilla creme anglaise. Don't get me wrong, the creme anglaise was delicious, but the french toast ended up being too sweet because of it. Chocolate tower french toast ($13.50): The maple mascarpone completes the french toast! They're not kidding when they say tower, the toast is extra thick cut and deeply chocolatey. I've always found the toast itself to be a little dry, but the banana cream sauce and mascarpone fix that problem for the most part. By the description, I expected it to be cloyingly sweet, which it wasn't. I guess it's hard to mess up chocolate french toast with bananas, but nicely done. White chocolate pretzel pancakes ($10): These pancakes, on the other hand, I found to be too sweet. The pancakes themselves were loaded with crunchy caramel pretzels which added a nice hit of sweet and salty, but the white chocolate sauce is just pure sweet. I thought the pancakes were a little too dense and a little dry.

Definitely one of my favorite restaurants on the planet!  Pros:  1. Delicious food! Flavors are delightful and compliment each other well. 2. Free STREET parking on WABASH on Sundays. If it aint Sunday and you aint parked on Wabash please FEED THE METER. 3. Generous portions. 4. 5 Walking distance to the Redline Roosevelt stop (green line and orange line too) 5. You can order 1 french toast or 1 pancake. This is a good option if you don't wanna over do it! Cons: 1. Long lines, sometimes there is an hour wait. 2. Street parking only 3. Certain days and times you can't add anything to your bill once your order is placed. Example, if I decide to order something to go (while eating my meal) I can't because my order was already placed. 4.

Eggs benedict: Extremely bland Spinach was uncooked which doesn't go with that dish (florentine has sauteed spinach which is better),so just a bunch of uncooked leaves of spinach on top of bread Hollendaise sauce had neither flavor nor salt nor butter English muffin was stale and blah, not toasted properly and arrived cold Tomato was mealy and not sliced in a pleasing way House potatoes:  Bland No texture UGH.

2014-12-18,2.0,"So disappointed... After rolling through my Yelp feed and vacationing in Chicago, I decided to try out the Bongo Room for breakfast as I heard it was phenomenal and it appeared that the reviews and pictures backed up the claims... Oh Yelpers how you wronged me, lol. First, the signage of this building is horrible, even the cab driver thought this was some abandoned building but after a closer look and an apprehensive door opening, I discovered this was the location. Note to management - if funds are limited to place a sign on top of the building, may I suggest some type of stand up poster that sits in the curb with an arrow towards the door? Second, this place is SMALL, they truly took the concept of making the best out of there real estate as it was tight to walk to your table, the tables were on the small side and even the construction of booths were awkward. Third, the service was IMO horrible, I don't remember our waitresses name but she was so transactional, offered no recommendations and found alternative ways to place work on me for certain request I made instead of telling the kitchen of it, she was even sarcastic in responding to certain things and choose to only check on us once and that was after the food came! No wait, a lie, she came over to give me the check, so twice. Fourth, the food, as YUMMY as the Red Velvet Hotcakes looks, they are BLAND BLAND BLAND! Sigh, the only saving grace and the reason for the two stars instead of one is because the eggs were scrambled well and the portion was a good size and the potatoes were seasoned really good too which didn't result in me playing chef.

They do not accept reservations under any conditions, and different locations have slightly different hours and menu options (ie. the South Loop location does not serve alcohol). The breakfast burrito ($9.75) was enormous and tasted AMAZING - Spinach flour tortilla filled with guacamole and generous portions of scrambled eggs topped with melted jack cheese & sour cream. Served with salsa on the side and house potatoes. I know it's 'murica, but honestly the portion is big enough for two to share.  You can order a side of Canadian Bacon for an extra $3.75! As a Canadian, I never realized we had our own bacon! Other unique sides on their menu include Thai Chicken Sausage - I regret not giving that a try. The seating is pretty cramped as the restaurant is literally one room. The space between tables is just big enough for the server to slide in to take your order.

We were lucky and happened to look beyond the door and saw the name on one of the windows. Before we left Chicago on 08/20 to head back home after a pleasant but exhaustive vacation, my boyfriend and I chose this place for a brunchy-type meal. I wasn't sure if I wanted something savory or sweet, but I was intrigued by the Croissant sandwich (grilled with muenster cheese and served with bacon, house potatoes, and one egg any style). My boyfriend decided to head down the sweet road and ordered the Meyer Lemon and Blackberry Pancakes. I have to say, I don't believe I've ever had a croissant quite like this. I knew right off the bat it would be too sloppy to eat with my hands, so I chose to hack at it with my knife and fork. Still messy? Yeah, but come on, melted cheese with crisp bacon and eggs cooked however you want? And perfectly seasoned potatoes? What more could you ask for? (Don't answer that.) I tried some of my boyfriend's pancakes, and Jesus wept they were super. Very filling, but the pancakes were soft and fluffy, and the lemon sauce (?) on top was absolutely out of this world.

2014-07-11,4.0,"Yum.. One star off for the torturous wait. And I absolutely hate waiting, especially in the morning prior to having some food in my stomach, so there you go. We came on a Sunday and had to wait for about 45 minutes outside since the waiting area inside was too small to accommodate all the parties. I wonder what people would do in bad weather, especially considering the harsh winters. We were taken here by our local friends who raved about it, and the previous day we went to the other location in Wicker Park only to find out it was closed for the weekend. So it'd better be worth it. To share, we ordered two white chocolate and caramel pretzel pancakes and two oreo and praline flapjacks for a group of five. The pancakes were of course - as it's commonly known now - sinful, sweet, and scrumptious. I think next time I'm there I'm going to order them for post-entree dessert; otherwise devouring just a portion of one such cake will interfere with my main course for brunch. I'm not a big white chocolate fan so I had more of the oreo ones. But both were large, hot, super sweet and gooey. It's one of those ""it's so wrong but yet feels so right"" things in life you just gotta experience once in a while.  I ordered chorizo potato avocado omelette as my entree. It was a generous portion; so of course after having some of those pancakes I couldn't finish it. Our bill was a little over $90 for five so it was definitely a meal with good value. I wouldn't say it was the best food we had in town (one in our party complained about the dry croissant) but certainly unique.

The chorizo was okay, but the side of hash browns it came with were seasoned good. I wouldn't come out of my way to come here again, but it wasn't bad.",0.9885,0.741,0.231,0.028,0.6281249999999999

I'd suggest sharing the pancakes with 2-3 others. Red Velvet Hot cakes - I could only eat a few bites of this, it was so sweet and over-powering that I got my fill very quickly - leaving 80% of it still uneaten.  Red Cornmeal and Cranberry hotcakes - at first I thought the large purple scoop on top was ice-cream, but it's all butter. I thought it was good, but you'll probably want to share with several people. The Sweet Potato and Black Bean Burrito was everyone's favorite at our table.

The facade, however, is minimalist and nondescript, so you'd miss it if it were not for the massive line out the door. You WILL be waiting for upwards 40 minutes, so plan ahead and get your name on the list early. They will step outside to call you, and if you're not physically there, your table is gone! Fortunately, the area around is not sparse in things to do while waiting--Trader Joe's across the street, Jewel Osco in the other direction, Starbucks and some convenience stores nearby for groceries or loitering. Upon entering, you will pass a darkened area that looks like some sort of juice bar, and then be seated at a table on the Roosevelt side. The tables are all quite close to each other, and the ambience is chatty. Your server will start you off with drinks, and you'll appreciate that their menu includes various teas that is always nice to select from.  But unless you're on a liquid diet, you probably came for their breakfast or lunch menu! Categorized as ""Savory"", ""Sweet"", and even ""Sinful"", you'll find all manner of eggs, omelettes, croissants, pancakes, and the usual staples, as well as some more creative, Bongo-creations. Particular gems include the Deconstructed Lobster Roll Benedict, Chorizo Potato Avocado Omelette, and the masterfully executed Chocolate Tower French Toast.

Banana tiramisu pancakes? I understand I'll have to take an insulin shot to the heart later Pulp Fiction Uma Thurman style, but the taste creations are worth it. I find they roll out a new pancake concept every month or two and I've yet to be let down.  As for the savory menu, there is a good balance between traditional breakfast fare and more creative items. Dad can get eggs and bacon, while you can treat yourself to a vegetarian croissant sandwich with goat cheese, spinach, and stop reading and go order it. And if you're an only child, you can build your own omelette. Want butternut squash and a flat tire? They can build it for you. Some dishes I've had recently include the beef tenderloin and butternut squash omelette, the carrot cake pancakes, and the beef and portobello mushroom sandwich at lunch time.

I had asked very politely if I could have some extra sauce and she confidently said that they were out of sauce in the kitchen. Well, fortunately I'm buddies with Aaron, one of the male servers and had him grab me some and he told me they were NOT out.  Another time, I received snotty attitude from the redhead waitress and most recently it was their hostess (Katy Perry wannabe). Me lady and myself were waiting in line per the wait-list and we brought it to the hostess' attention that she had let someone behind us skip us in-line.(as anyone else that's been on a 40 minute wait would have). We were certainly not rude about it but even the person going in felt bad because they knew we were there before them and clarified with Ms Katy Perry - wannabe. Rather than admitting it was her fault for the oversight, she turned around and said, ""Next time, you should let us know if your party is complete...."" . Clearly, on her list it says ""PARTY OF TWO"" and me-lady and I were sitting down holding hands. I don't think I randomly do that to strangers while waiting in line. So either learn to count or get an attitude check, bee-yotch!

The prices are reasonable because their portions are big, so you'll have extra to take home.",0.9866,0.756,0.226,0.018,0.4924369747899159

The pancake itself was VERY bland and dense. I also had a side of 2 sunny side up eggs that were also very bland and not seasoned well.i had high hopes and left very disappointed.

2014-02-22,5.0,Bongo Room is hands down one of the top two brunch places (along with Yolk) in Chicago...in my opinion. I've been coming to the Wabash/Roosevelt location for years and have never once been disappointed. Guests that I've taken to Bongo Room 1-2 years ago still talk about how amazing the food was there and I have some snobbish/picky eater friends so for them to all love Bongo Room speaks to the awesomeness of this place. Must tries are: 1) Chocolate Tower French Toast 2) White Chocolate & Caramel Pretzel Pancakes 3) Breakfast Burrito,0.9377,0.848,0.152,0.0,0.42986111111111114

2014-02-08,5.0,"This morning was my first time at the South Loop Bongo Room location.  I have been to the Wicker Park location a few times (love it), and I was hoping I would find the same great brunch experience here.  I'm happy to say that I like this location even better! My friend and I arrived just after 9am on a Saturday morning, opening time.  There were already a few people seated and settled in, but the majority of the tables were empty.  It was not full as I was expecting for a Saturday morning in Chicago.  We were greeted by a very nice hostess and seated right away.  Within a few minutes, we placed our order. I ordered a Dark Orange tea and my friend ordered an iced mocha.  My tea came with a lemon wedge AND a packet of honey!  It is those small touches that I enjoy.  Tea must come with lemon and honey, and so many brunch places just don't *get* that. I ordered a VEGETARIAN CROISSANT SANDWICH (no cheese) with a side of BACON. This is how brunch is done, son.  The plain croissant sandwich is not as packed with goodies as the vegetarian one, so just order the veggie croissant with a side of bacon.  :)  You order it with the egg sunny side up (so the yolk breaks and soaks yolky goodness into the croissant) and add the crispy bacon to it.  It's awesome.  The sandwich is gigantic and comes with potatoes. My friend ordered the CHOCOLATE TOWER FRENCH TOAST!   Holy moly, that thing was HUGE.  It was so decadent and glorious:  THICK slices of chocolate french toast stuffed with maple mascarpone, on a plate of banana crème brulée sauce and topped with chocolate shavings, banana slices, and a decorative ""chocolate crown.""  This dish is delicious and is so big, it gets attention from the entire room as soon as it comes out of the kitchen. The Bongo Room is one of my favorite places for Brunch.  I only wish they had more room to seat diners and opened earlier!  I definitely need to come here more often!",0.9974,0.797,0.198,0.006,0.5288239538239539

We ordered the white chocolate caramel pretzel pancake (say that 5 times fast!), chorizo avocado potato omelette, and Thai chicken sausage.  I was apprehensive about trying my friend's pancake especially because pancakes I've tried at Bongo Room in the past were overly sweet or very heavy, but the combination of the white choco/caramel sauces with the salty pretzels tasted great! If I were craving something sweet, I would order this again. When it comes to Thai cuisine, I think of strong bold flavors. Sadly, the Thai sausage was the antithesis of those flavors. Also, I found it really bizarre that the links were cut in half and only three are served; not worth the $4 in my opinion. The skillet potatoes that came with the omelet were delicious -- crispy brown on the outside and tender inside. Although the flavors of the chorizo omelette were fine, the eggs were slightly overcooked for my liking and I felt the dish was overpriced at $13. Maybe it's what I ordered, but I wasn't wowed by my meal.  Servers and hosts were friendly and attentive so no issues there.

An omelette chocked full of chorizo, potato, avocado, and cheese...there were additional potatoes on the side. I have to say I was disappointed with it because for 1) eggs were way too hard for an omelette.  Seemed like a piece of rubber, 2) chorizo lacked in flavor. Seemed like spicy red beef in an egg. FLAVOR, please! 3) Potatoes... nothing special. Overall, nothing special. Would not recommend this dish. My friends and I all got that dish... we also decided to split a sweet dish and got another one of the specials- apple cranberry brioche french toast. On the flip side.... all I have to say is YUM! Definitely would recommend this. It is vanilla brioche topped with sautéed apples and dried cranberries. No need for maple syrup, it is topped with vanilla cream and oatmeal streusel crumbs.  Wow, typing that out makes me want to eat it again.  I recommend the black raspberry and grapefruit mimosa to accompany with whatever you are having. I've never had that mix in a mimosa and I would definitely get it again.

2013-10-24,4.0,"Few tips to have the best experience at Bongo Room: 1. GET THE RED VELVET PANCAKES - you will not regret this decision. It's like eating a fabulous cupcake for breakfast, but in pancake form...so it is socially acceptable. 2. Stick with their sweets menu [pancakes and french toast]. My friend made the mistake of ordering one of their breakfast burritos which was very unimpressive and best summed up as: a lot of scrambled eggs and a little bit of melted cheese wrapped with tortilla...[they get one star off because of this] 3. Order the full order of pancakes. You will eat it all, if not you, your friends will be more than happy to help you finish it. 4. Arrive early! This place gets packed quickly, especially on the weekends. My friends and I walked right in when it opened, but upon leaving, there was already a crowded waiting area!

2013-10-20,5.0,"I love the bongo room! Having tried the one in the Andersonville area, I had super high expectations coming in and they were certainly fulfilled here. The wait was a bit hefty- a party of 3 at around 10:30 was 45 minutes, but luckily there is a starbucks in the area to and plenty of grocery shopping to be done. I came here with a party of two others and we shared all our entrees family style. We had the breakfast burrito, chorizo omelet (special), and the chocolate tower french toast.  Everything on our table was excellent. The breakfast burrito had great flavor and was filled with chunks of avocado. Normally I really dislike sour cream, but they add some spices too it turning it into an orange color that enhanced the dish. Needless to say I ate the entire cup. The chorizo omelet also had plenty of avocado in it and the chorizo was not too spicy which was nice because some breakfast places definitely overdo it on the hotness level. The potatoes that came with omelet came really charred  (not burnt) and added some extra crunchy texture which I thought was unique.  The chocolate tower French toast is humongous! I couldn't imagine eating this alone let alone as my breakfast meal so it was super nice that we split it into thirds which came out to be the perfection portion size. There are three slices of french toast stacked together and it comes with sliced bananas as well as this banana pudding sauce beneath it that actually looks a little like vomit, but was the perfect complement to the chocolateyness of the french toast. Banana and chocolate is a wonderful combo. Great, friendly, and fast service here as well!",0.9974,0.732,0.24,0.028,0.557242703533026

On the plus side, service was great and even though they quote 30 minutes for a four top table, we got seated in 10. And the service was stellar. They were very a accommodating when I asked to substitute chirizo for veggies.  The minuses? My savory dish was just okay. A big fat burrito in fact, but on par with many other decent brunch spots. For the table, we ordered a sinful dish, stack of pancakes with white chocolate and caramel glaze. Delicious but way to sweet to eat as a main dish for one person.

Both times we've gone on the weekend and there's been a wait (~30-40 minutes) - as expected for a popular brunch place (at least in my mind). We walked across the street and wandered around Trader Joe's to kill some time. It's not a huge place so they won't seat groups larger than 5-6 because of fire hazards. They'll split up larger groups into multiple tables if necessary. The first time we went we split the breakfast burrito, chorizo potato avocado omelette, and white chocolate & caramel pretzel pancakes amongst 3 of us. We finished off the breakfast burrito pretty quickly - the cilantro jalapeno tortilla is delicious. The omelette was probably our least favorite of the three, but still tasty - the avocado is the best part. I was expecting the white chocolate & caramel pretzel pancakes to be overly sweet but they weren't at all. The pancakes are huge and fluffy and the salty pretzels in the pancake balance out the white chocolate and caramel flavoring. SO GOOD! The second time we went we tried the red velvet hotcakes - they were good, but not as good as the white chocolate pancakes. The bottom two hotcakes were a little dry since there wasn't enough vanilla creme sauce. We probably wouldn't order this again, but we'll definitely be back to try a few other things. The waiters aren't dressed in uniform so they're somewhat hard to spot or track down sometimes.

We kept passing it by because the name Bongo Room really did not jump out at us.  Once we walked in there were a lot of people waiting on tables. Our wait was 30 minutes.

Now onto the food.  Our impressions were that the sweet stuff was better than the savory dishes.  This is kind of expected (and happens at other brunch places too), but it is always disappointing. The savory dish was the chorizo avocado omelette.  Nothing exceptional about it with some weak chorizo and a hudge as fudge side of bland potatoes.  I order a lot of chorizo at restaurants as when it is good it is really good; sadly, most place have mediocre chorizo and so I get burned. For sweets we tried two of the chocolate french toast and one red velvet pancake.  The latter was kind of gummy, though the ""frosting"" was very tasty.  The highlight of the meal was definitely the chocolate french toast soaking in banana creme and fresh bananas.  A little skeptical about whether it is in fact a french toast, but that is really secondary to how delicious it was.  I would come back for this.",0.9821,0.766,0.166,0.068,0.4712962962962963

If I'm going to only go once during a visit, this has become my staple. The white chocolate topping is incredibly rich and heavy, but it's amazing. Add the salt and sugar and there's really nothing to complain about...except for the overstuffed feeling you'll have when you're done. With a menu that's always changing, there's no guarantee that what you got today will be there in a few months, so enjoy it while you can. Fortunately the pancakes I mentioned above have always been on the specials menu when I visited! You just can't go wrong with any of their special items. I'm also a big fan of the breakfast burrito (read: lots of guacamole inside!) The downsides? The wait. That's about it. Some may say the service is a little slow, but it's never been so slow that I've been annoyed. Make sure you get there early or stop in after the breakfast rush for brunch. Otherwise, don't be surprised if you encounter a 45-minute (or more) wait. Whether or not it's worth the wait is up to you, but more times than not, I'd say it's worth it. In the end, if you've got the appetite and a craving for sweets, skip the doughnuts for breakfast and down some excessive calories that'll feel ""worth it!""

A little Mexican cheese of something  on the plain sliced tomato would have been nice.

First off, the Bongo Room has probably less than 30 options to choose from versus Yolk, which has over 150 options. The Bongo Room has really 3 kinds of dishes: omelets, eggs benedict and sweet options. The service is was really fast, (helped by having so few options) and our serve Mike was super nice! I got the BLT Benedict which is two english muffins, topped with bacon, spinach, tomato, poached eggs and a basil-pesto hollandaise sauce. The sauce was AMAZING! I could have that poured over anything and I would eat it! In comparing the two restaurants, I think that the Bongo Room has fresher food just because of the way everything is set up but its pricier and I think that the portions are much larger and at Yolk.

2013-06-23,4.0,"Ooh this place... So, while perusing Yelp for breakfast places, we landed on this one because it was the highest rated place and within 6 blocks of our hotel.  Fair enough!   We arrived maybe five minutes before it opened and there was a line around the block.  This is a good sign.  Thankfully when the place opened, we were seated immediately.  I imagine the wait gets a little ridiculous.   Normally, I write a quick blurb about the atmosphere of a place, but I LOVE how bright and colorful everything is here!  It's like eating breakfast in a kindergarten class.  Well, maybe like an upscale Montessori kindergarten class...  The noise level is a little reminiscent of a kindergarten class as well.  I haven't even had any caffeine yet, calm down, people!   The menu has a great selection of non-egg items, which was a big sell for my boyfriend (he's allergic to eggs but not when they're in things...I don't understand either).  I normally get egg items, but everyone raves about the pancakes here, so I got the banana heath bar pancakes.  My boyfriend went with the blueberry pancakes with lemon cream.   I was a little annoyed at the waitress when she forcefully suggested that we order two pancakes instead of three because the normal portions are so large.  I went along with her but my brain was screaming ""I'LL OVEREAT IF I WANT, LADY!  DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO!""   BUT she was right and I'm glad I didn't fight with her.  The portions are huge.  I guess you can order one, two or the full set of three pancakes and they charge you accordingly (i.e. you're not paying 'three pancake' prices for one pancake).  This lady sitting next to us was SMART and got two one-pancake orders.  It was basically a pancake flavor sampler...which is great since they have so many options.   Our pancakes came to the table, and based on looks alone, I may not have picked up a fork.  These are not pretty plates.  BUT the food is just spectacular.  My pancakes were nice and fluffy and occasionally crunchy from the toffee bits inside.  The bananas and praline cream on top were to die for, I just wish there was MORE.  My boyfriend's pancakes were bursting with blueberry and the lemon cream on top was tangy and just delicious.   But surprisingly enough, my FAVORITE thing about the meal was my boyfriend's side of sausage.  GET THE SAUSAGE!  It's crisp on the outside but tender and flavorful on the inside.  Maybe the best breakfast sausage I've ever had.   The service was quick and we did not feel rushed out the door (but then again, we're not restaurant lingerers).  I would visit this place again and certainly recommend it.",0.9974,0.763,0.188,0.049,0.5890917107583775

Egg yolks just runny enough for Vincent Y. The flapjacks were my favorite, though. They were pretty dense and pretty banana-y, which I like more than the traditional soft fluffy pancake (I guess this means it's not for everyone).

Also, I feel that most of the times that I have gone to the Bongo Room, I have had to ask to replace my silverware since they were dirty. Lastly, the last time I went to the Bongo Room, I left upset. I arrived at 1:50pm. It was my fault for not checking the time that the Bongo closed.

I asked for the breakfast potatoes to be well-done, only to be told that it wasn't possible because they're all made in a big batch for brunch and can't be cooked to order.  OK, fine - although it seems to me a simple proposition to throw a couple potatoes on a griddle for a few minutes.

2013-03-24,2.0,"You know, there is so much hype around this place. I was so so so excited to try it. The way people talk about it you would think it was the holy grail of breakfast foods.  Not quite.  I mean It's alright. I wouldn't say it any better than Nookies or any other 10 to 15 dollar breakfast place you see around here. I had the breakfast burrito and all it had in it were eggs and avocado. No onions or any kind of meat ??  The potatoes had great flavor but they were a big pile of mush. We asked if we could have crispier more well done potatoes when we originally ordered and apparently they ""can't do that on weekends"". Give me a break.  My boyfriend got the eggs bennie, he enjoyed it but agreed that it was not worth the 40 minute wait.  We were with some more people so we all split the banana pancakes, They came with what seemed to be a side of melted frosting. I enjoyed a bite but I couldn't imagine eating more than that. So sugary.  THE SERVICE SUCKED. We asked for a stack of plain pancakes and for some reason that was not possible even though it was a breakfast place. She then went on about how terrible the pancakes are without their melty frosting toppings. Then she brought us the check without asking if we wanting anything else, didn't ask us if we needed a box for our leftovers, and starred at us until we left so they could seat the next people  I get it your busy but its not like we were sitting around not doing anything, we were finishing our meals.

The Chocolate Tower French Toast was really good, but I didn't like Eggs Benedict. I always order Benedict at every breakfast place I go because it has always been my favorite thing.

Tried to go a little healthier with poached eggs, chicken sausage, home potatoes, greens and whole wheat toast. Everything I had was really good!

He chose the banana pancake with hazelnuts (I'm not a big fan of bananas but I still tried a bite).

Red velvet pancakes: just heavenly. Completely doused in vanilla creme sauce, topped with assorted crushed nuts, the pancakes were moist and light, yet decadent. It was creamy but not too sweet. Perfectly balanced for me!   2. Chorizo Omelette: comes with a side of potato hashbrowns, it was good. Nicely seasoned and a bit charred. The omelete had chorizo and avocado inside that made it pretty tasty. Not amazing though.  3. Baby Spinach, Arugula, Red Peppers Eggs Benedict: Least favorite dish, it didn't work well together on my palette. I wasn't a fan of this dish because it tasted sour to me. But it also came with a side of potato hashbrowns. I wish we got the regular eggs benedict instead, that would have tasted much better.  4. Apple Currant Brioche French Toast: This was very special and very delicious. Rich and texturized by the softened apple and currant pieces, there was also vanilla creme sauce on top and crushed nuts for that crunch.  We split this among 3 girls and the waitress told us we could split up the portions from the full size. So instead of getting 3 pancakes for $10.05 we could get 2 pancakes for $7.95. Instead of two french toast slices, we got one slice for $5.95 or so. It was very nice to be able to try different dishes at a reduced price.

I've waited from 15 minutes (getting there around opening time) to 1.5 hours (getting there a bit after opening time) but after getting seated, service is attentive, quick and efficient. But how about the food? Everything is very well portioned, tons of food to go around: - The benedicts here are really, really good. The eggs are poached perfectly, the english muffins toasted perfectly and the various different kinds of toppings (BLT, smoked salmon, etc) all blend together a fantastic combo of flavor and savory goodness. The benedicts here are on a totally different level compared to other brunch places in Chicago. They also come with lots of potatoes to fill up all the corners of your GI tract.  - The pancakes are enormous. I once had a warm praline syrup, banana and bacon pancake. While strange on the menu, it came together pretty nicely. A little too rich/heavy for me during the last few bites but I appreciated the adventurous combination of flavors. The other pancakes also deserve notice; friends have really praised the Red Velvet ones.  - Chocolate Tower French Toast: I really don't like chocolate but friends seem to enjoy this one. I guess the big stack of chocolate on everything banana-y and french toast would look pretty great if I had normal chocolate taste buds.  - Omelets are great. I've yet to order one myself but from what I've mooched off of the plates of others, they've seemed quite tasty.  Prices are not cheap but the restaurant (Roosevelt location) is super accessible via the Red Line and various bus lines and the place itself is clean and friendly.

That was fine, if they want to be all ""yo bro, I'm not gonna bother you eat unless you have something to say"". At the end of the meal, he tossed the bill on our table without saying a word. Maybe, maybe, maybe he uttered ""here you go"" but that's a big maybe. After we paid, and when he brought back the bill, he said ""thanks"" with the most quiet voice without making eye contact. As we were walking out of the restaurant and I initiating eye contact with him hoping for a saving grace ""thanks guys see you soon"", he deliberately dodged my eyes.  That is it.

Once we discovered the nondescript entrance, the sun was piercing through the large windows that enhanced the mix of spring colors and its minimalist décor. The vibe was casual and hipsterish as we were seated upon arrival. I was glad to get out of the cold after the brisk walk, and quickly felt the comfort of the sunny window with a fresh cup of Intelligentsia coffee that arrived soon after. The Chorizo Potato Avocado Omelette ($12.95) was added with queso, a side of salsa, house potatoes, and English muffins. The eggs were firmer than expected, but still flavorful with lots of fillings embedded. The salsa packed some heat, and complemented well with the sweet avocado and a good amount of savory chorizo. It was a heavy dish but one that I would recommend for those looking for a big breakfast.  The Red Velvet Hotcakes ($10.50) was fantastic. The makeup was different from the soft fluffy ones at The Griddle Café. Rather, the firmer texture reminded me of hot delicious brownies with small chocolate chips in the middle. Not too sweet, the pancakes had a nice buttermilk flavor to accompany sprinkles of semi-melted chocolate chips and an amazing warm vanilla cream and shaved walnuts layered at top. The pancakes were good, but the vanilla cream came with tremendous wow factor and made this dish highly addictive. Loved it. Sometimes it's best to go straight for the dessert and breakfast is no different. Portions were generous, but service was inconsistent and absent most of the time. Overall, the firm textures in both dishes were a surprise but they soon became a source of strength given the unmistakable wow factor.

On to the food! After reading reviews, I really wanted to order the benedict (never had one before) but it looks like that was only for brunch and that's on weekends.  I was disappointed, but that isn't their fault.  Instead, I opted for an omelette (chicken sausage, yellow peppers, and mushrooms) with white toast and house potatoes, and my girlfriend picked scrambled egg whites with wheat toast and house potatoes. The toast is your standard run of the mill bread and came with butter on the side.  The potatoes though... wow!  Cooked just right, not too hard, but not squishy.  Not overly oily, and not too flavorful.  They were so yum, and I had to stop myself from finishing them so I could start on my omelette :p. It's been a while since I've had an omelette and I don't eat at these special breakfast places very often so do take my review with a grain of salt.  I LOVED this omelette!  I usually get cheese in my omelettes, but this time there were so many choices to choose from and I could only pick three so I left out cheese.  Nevertheless, the omelette was STILL awesome.  The sausage was juicy and very tasty, and the mushrooms and peppers were fresh.  The eggs was cooked just right too; I've had a lot of omelettes where they were overcooked and the omelette was a bit dry but this was not the case here. My girlfriend enjoyed her egg whites as well.  These came at an extra cost of $1.50 but this was an extra charge that we felt was justified.  We've never had them before but we loved them.  The texture is different from normally scrambled eggs, so they might not be for everyone.  They also didn't overload the egg whites with salt, which is often a problem with scrambled eggs.  Deee-lish :) After tax and tips the meal was about 22 dollars.  For the setting, the food, and the service, this was 22 dollars well spent!  If you're in Chicago and are near the area, please please stop by the Bongo Room for breakfast!",0.9977,0.79,0.183,0.027,0.5550054112554114

Orange is also guilty of pretty sweet plates. Yolk is a little more cautious with their sugar in my opinion.) They have good ""savory"" dishes as well.

Their amazing array of various pancakes are what I miss the most even though I'm a savory breakfast gal.  We always will get 1 or 2 (you can get half order or order 1 pancake) for a dessert pancake after ordering our savory breakfast.  Some of my favorites over the years involved Ginger butter and a lemon pancake... or a smore pancake... or a pumpkin spice pancake.... creme anglaise...::drooling:: my stomach is literally growling as I lay in bed writing this review...

But I just loved the look of their HOT CAKES.. Portion sizes looked big and would serve two.

My croissant came out soggy, my soft poached egg was cooked hard and served cold, and the potatoes on the side were over spiced and oily.

2012-07-29,3.0,"Food had great flavor, but was lacking in quality control, which it shouldn't be for the price or just for the sake of professionalism. My husband and I went on a Sunday morning at about 9:15 and immediately got a seat. The decor is pleasant but the crowd was so noisy it was hard to hear each other - not sure if that's an acoustics problem or just a particularly vocal breakfast crowd.  We ordered blueberry pancakes and BLT eggs benedict to split. For some reason it took an extraordinarily long time for our food to come - I think they might have missed our ticket, though, because other people's food was arriving in a more timely fashion. The coffee was decent (although I'm generally unable to judge bad coffee for some reason) and refilled often, and there was plenty of cream and sugar at the table. My husband's orange juice was pretty small and cost $4.50, but that's not too unusual for fresh-squeezed. The waitress scrupulously avoided our table during the epic wait for the food - a cowardly move, especially since we are very easy-going diners and hadn't complained at all. When the food did come, the pancakes were piping hot - so hot that they were STILL hot after we'd both eaten our half of the eggs benedict. And they were delicious. I was definitely worried that all of the creamy goo they smother them with would make them soggy and super sweet, but it didn't. The only negative is that the pancakes themselves are not your standard soft, fluffy pancakes. They are thick, sturdy, bready suckers that involve a bit more chewing than you would like. I think the object is to make them sturdy enough to handle the toppings, but they could definitely dial it back just a little.  The BLT eggs benedict was beautiful, but cold on arrival. If that weren't enough, the eggs were WAY overcooked; essentially boiled, complete with a rubbery yellow yolk that I left on my plate in the hopes that I might clue someone in. The flavors were  great, but that was - pardon the pun - cold comfort, considering the shoddy craftsmanship, the conspicuous absence of apology from the wait staff, and the fact that the eggs benedict was the most expensive part of the meal - $13 or $14.  Now let me say that perhaps most people would have no trouble sending a meal like this back, or at the very least mentioning the issues to SOMEONE. But that's not me - I like to avoid confrontation in life generally, let alone when I go out to eat to enjoy myself. I was happier to eat my cold, tasty meal than I would be to complain and embroil myself in an unnecessarily unpleasant situation. That doesn't mean I was all that happy about either choice; I wish the restaurant had just done a half-decent job in the first place, which they did not. And it wasn't as if the quality control issue was a hair or something else hard to notice. This was cold tennis balls on english muffins. So disappointing! One more thing: potatoes were yummy - AND hot - but they really do have too much pepper on them. Get a clue, Bongo Room. A lot of people agree on this point. I will probably go back to try other things, and I will recommend the place, but not highly and not any time soon.",0.9922,0.752,0.152,0.096,0.5401313813813815

2012-06-13,4.0,"Bongo Room is my go to brunch place in the city when I have out-of-towners visiting, because its brunch is really something unlike I've ever had anywhere else. Namely, their sweet options are absolutely delectable.  As a tip, a full order of pancakes and french toast is 3 pancakes/pieces of french toast, but you can order one or two pieces if you want for a lower price (this is not on the menu, but trust me, it's worth doing). Whenever I go, we generally get one or two mini orders of sweet stuff for the table to share, and then everyone gets their own savory thing. The White Chocolate Pretzel Pancakes with peanut butter are AMAZING.... so rich and creamy and just... try it. I haven't really had any sweet thing there that I didn't like, but the pretzel pancakes are phenomenal.  The veggie breakfast croissant is also really good, but kind of messy, so don't order it if you're on a date or a business meeting or something. Build your own omelette is also a great go to option, and all the savory options come with a mound of potatoes.  Only complaint is that the wait can be very very long, and they're not very good about turning over tables etc. You could sit there for 20 minutes looking at 3 open tables before anyone realizes they're open and clears them. Also, when we last came, we had a group of 8 people on a Saturday morning, and we were the first in line. They opened the door to let us know they'd be opening at 9, and we told them we had 8 people so that they could get a table for us while they were getting ready to open.

I'm staying in Chicago for the next couple of days and have no idea where to go for good food. Checked out yelp and to my delight, your place turned up only 2 blocks from my hotel. Walked in and was seated promptly - on a Monday afternoon. After reading about what seems to be the popular dish here - hotcakes; I wanted to try it but currently on a gluten-free diet. So I narrowed down my food groups to the omelettes, which I'm not particular crazy about... and decided to live a little and shoot for the Special - Chorizo Omelette. The order came out looking like most ordinary omelettes, until l took my first bite into it... then suddenly, I felt the most taste-gratifying moment since the invention of chocolate... Now I have a new found love for omelette, and not just any omelette, Chorizo Omelette from Bongo! I can't exactly pinpoint what made this a pure awesome plate, perhaps it's the perfectly spiced salsa mixed with the beautifully seasoned chorizo, or could it be the fresh avocado and melted queso fresco cheese. Whatever it is, you guys got it right! Kudos!",0.9939,0.753,0.223,0.024,0.5173053284164395

2012-05-29,2.0,"The food is great, but they'll nickel-and-dime you the whole time.  My girlfriend and I go there every couple of months, and this latest trip didn't make me happy.  Of course there was a long wait, but for whatever reason, that's the norm in the South Loop.  I got an orange juice while we waited, and I got the ""large"".  The ""large"" is the size of most places small size.  When I order a water from someplace like McDonalds, I get a larger cup than this orange juice.  The cost, $4.50 for that ""large"".  That pissed me off more than anything else at Bongo Room. The other issue were their pancakes.  I ordered the carmel-creme-something pancakes, and they were delicious with one big fault: the sauce.  The pancakes were heavy and dense, so the sauce on top really helped to lighten the 'cakes.  Once you got through the top layer and the edges, they were way too dry.  I asked for another cup of sauce, and in typical nick-and-dime fashion, they charged me for the extra sauce. I get that it's a higher end breakfast joint, but if I'm paying more, I expect to get more, and that doesn't include being taken for all I'm worth.  I will certainly be patronizing Waffles and Yolk more because those places will at least provide adequate amounts of sauce from the start and don't rob me when I ask for a little more.",0.8551,0.832,0.106,0.061,0.4817336309523809
2012-05-27,2.0,"I was excited to try the Bongo Room after seeing the reviews, and realizing I didn't even know about this place, even though my office is six blocks away. We arrived 15 minutes before they opened, and were the third party in line. During the next 15 minutes, the line got much, much longer, so excitement was mounting! Finally the doors opened, and we, along with numerous other people and strollers, poured into Bongo Room. Yay! It took us a little while to decide on our entrees, but the coffee started flowing while we did, and the dining room filled to capacity. We finally ordered, and proceeded to wait. A long time. When my rock shirmp benedict finally arrived, all was forgiven, it was delicious. The remoulade hollandaise sauce was fantastic, the shrimp were not huge, but tasted very fresh, and had that nice ""popping"" texture to them that I like. The potatoes were buttery, fragrant, and tasty, and the portion was massive. Unfortunately, my fiancee's omelet was not so good. It looked good from the top, but the bottom was burned, lending a burnt egg flavor to the entire omelet. In addition, the omelet fillings she ordered were scant. She was so hungry, and we had waited so long for our food, that it took her a while to realize what was wrong with it. By that time, we didn't want to send it back to the kitchen, for fear of having another long wait for her food.  By that time, the waitress came by with our check, and we told her about the problem. She took the check back, and spoke with the manager, who took $5.00 off our bill. $5.00 wasn't quite 50% off the $10.75 the omelet cost. We argued a bit with the waitress (no, the manager didn't stop by to negotiate with us), but we just wanted to go at that point. So we paid $36.00 with tip for shrimp benedict, a burnt omelet and two cups of coffee. The benedict was great, and the service was good, save for direct contact with the manager to resolve our issue. The coffee was pretty darn good, too. But overall, I feel like we paid too much for what we got. I don't think I'll be back.",0.9599,0.777,0.132,0.091,0.5736111111111111

Don't expect much chit-chat from the servers...they are all business - get in, get out.  The service was good though, water refilled often...they charge for anything extra, like if you ask for extra sauce for your dry pancakes, it's a $1. I liked what we got..their highly talked about red velvet pancakes, which I swear are not pancakes, but very thin cakes made in round baking sheets, the sauce made the dish!  The eggs were good, and I liked that their potatoes were seasoned. We came in with Starbucks and no one scowled at us, so that was nice.  Anyhoo - both the hubby and I were pleased, but I can't say its any better than Yolk...in regards to quality.  The food choices were however more unique, so that is a big plus!  I would go back and try some of the other plates that I had drooled over as they went past my face and to the other dedicated breakfast eaters.",0.9804,0.83,0.146,0.024,0.47452674897119346

Take me anywhere else and I just kinda feel let down by what 'could have been'... what could have been in my belly, that is. Other than the annoyingly long line of hipsters that's usually snaking out the door on any given weekend, there isn't much that I don't love about this place. Be prepared to stand and wait... there is a small bench area, but it's only wide enough for four normal-sized butts, or six waifishly thin hipster girls... Why are they there anyway? This is no place for a salad and it would be a shame to 'refund' anything this place serves. At any rate, while you are standing, and waiting, you'll be sipping on nothing but Intelligentsia coffee. It's the best, and the mark of an outfit that doesn't cut corners. One hour, 4 cups of coffee, and a trip to the bathroom later, you may be shown to your table. Be prepared to make friends, because you're going to get cozy in the dining room with all of your neighbors. The food here is phenomenal, and during your hour wait in the lobby, you'll see plate after plate leave the kitchen... you'll stare in amazement and try to piece together what you are going to actually order when the time comes. Every plate just looks better than the last. You'll stare at the menu - divided up into sections such as 'Savory,' 'Sweet,' and 'Sinful'. You'll have made up your mind when all of a sudden you realize that there is also a menu of the day sitting on your table with five or six even more ridiculously delicious offerings. You'll find yourself torn between something sweet and something savory. Don't be torn. Be whole. Be indulgent. Get something savory, and then get one of those ridiculous pancakes. Get *one*. Don't get a stack, because nobody can eat a stack - at least not without going into a diabetic coma... sweet delicious coma. They don't say this on the menu, but you can order an individual pancake for $5... and you'll find it's more than enough for two people to split as an after-brunch dessert. It's the way to go. I opted for a croissant sandwich with roasted potatoes and then got a pancake to split. It was first topped with crushed pretzels (salty goodness) and then covered with a cream cheese sauce with white chocolate and caramel. I couldn't help it. When I put the first bite in my mouth, I had 'a moment'. Good thing I was sitting down. Now, on top of the fabulous coffee, and ridiculously delicious food, the service here is also awesome. The water glasses were always full, the coffee always topped off, and the service was always friendly. The only thing I don't get is why they call this place 'Bongo Room'.

We had a little wait, but coming in at noon on a Sunday at a place known for their Sunday brunch, that is only to be expected.  But, while we were waiting, they have a little bar set up in the front where we were able to order our Sangria, the most important part!  We were definitely happy not to have to wait for that!!! The manager, I believe he was, kept coming over to us, and everyone else at the restaurant, to make sure we were doing ok, if we had any questions.  He was very amicable and answered all our food questions (we were starving!) without getting annoyed and it was very enjoyable to talk with him. Our server, Becky, was so great and very patient.  Me personally, I was ready for food.  When I am hungry, I have a one track mind, and all I want is to get food in my mouth.  At this point I was ready to just open my mouth and have someone shovel food in.  Really, I get cranky.  And being with four other girls who are just chatting away, ""la-de-da"", Becky was awesome enough to recommend we start with coffee cake while we figure out what we wanted.  If she hadn't, I would've eaten the arm of my friend next to me.  The coffee cake was delicious too, and the perfect thing to ward off my cannibalism until our breakfast was FINALLY ordered.  Next time I am going to brunch with my guy friends, cause I know they'll want to order first, talk later.  I'm such a lady sometimes. And I gotta say, with all the waiting we made her do, Becky was extravagant!  Very professional, yet so nice and friendly.  I loved her! As for the food part, I ordered the Nanadict, their specific take on Eggs benedict.  Instead of ham they used chorizo, and I can't remember what was used instead of muffins, but it was also really good.  The ""Nanadict"" was good, but as someone who isn't particular to chorizo I didn't care too much for it. Then again, that was my fault for ordering it knowing they used chorizo. The chicken sandwich was boasted by everyone who worked there as ""The Best Chicken Sandwich You Will EVER Eat - Guaranteed!""  Two girls ordered it, and I almost had to recommend they book a room for privacy as the noises coming from them were close to something else.  They did say it definitely held up it's guarantee! AND, if you have a side to order, and like a little spice, I highly recommend the acorn squash!  I love spicy food, and the two girls that hated spice ordered it.  So Yay for me cause I got free squash!  It was the best I have ever had, and I even asked the guy how they made it.  He was more than happy to tell me they put red chili flakes in it with a smidge of brown sugar to make it sweet.  I LOVED IT!

The BLT eggs Benedict was perfect, with delicate spinach leaves (raw) and a sauce I forgot to ask for on the side (a little PTSD from hollandaises past) but didn't mind having allover because it wasn't too creamy or overpowering and complimented the runny egg yolk very well.

The Sweet Potato and Black Bean Burrito was both savory yet sweet at the same time; the side of potatoes that came along with it were delicious as well! The amount of vegetarian options was welcome, as half of the table were vegetarians. The other half, however, was happy because there were plenty of meat options for them as well. Our server, in a word, was horrible. When asked about the menu, her response always was ""well I don't like it but other people do"". When asked for vegetarian recommendations, she said, ""well I like my bacon so I don't know"". The food did not come out all at once, but instead with a solid 4-5 minute wait between plates. By the time we got started, half of it was cold. And, only after a few minutes of having the food, our server dropped a check right in the middle of our table and told us she would come back for it in a few minutes. Forgive me, but when you're spending $80+ on brunch WITHOUT booze, you absolutely should not drop the check off when we've just started our meal.

A very relaxed atmosphere. Our server was friendly and attentive. We ended up having the french toast with vanilla bean sauce topped with apples and walnuts and an omelet with yellow peppers, avocado, pesto, and feta cheese to share.

My sister deemed it a must have for her future visits to Chicago and was still raving about it hours afterwards. Thanks Bongo Room for a delicious brunch.

2012-02-06,3.0,"A Bongo Room haiku: Dessert for breakfast Dishes drowned in sweet sauces Ho-hum savory If you love yourself some sweet breakfast, I assure you that you will find a dish you like (possibly even love) at Bongo Room. I enjoy the french toast that was on special - it was a baguette type of bread treated in a traditional french toast manner with some delectable caramelized apples served atop the toast. To be honest, so many of my friends raved about the white chocolate pretzel pancakes that I thought that was for sure what I was going to order.... but I saw them and I just couldn't do it. When I got a look at them, the pancakes were positively swimming in white chocolate and caramel. I may or may not have contracted diabetes just from looking at them. Along the same lines, the apple french toast that I did order was positively drowned in a vanilla creme anglaise. It was ok and the particular bread they used did stand up to the sauciness, but it was just an absurd amount of sauce on the plate. I would come back here to try the cranberry & yellow corn hotcakes - I got a glimpse of these on the way out and they looked seriously amazing and pleasantly NOT drowned in some sort of syrup.   My bf's southwest/chorizo omlette was disappointing. The portion size was large, but the chorizo was not good. The texture of it was weird. None of the few savory dishes I noticed in the dining room looked particularly great. I think it's pretty obvious that the people who know what they are doing come here for sweets.  We experienced only a 15-20 min wait on a Saturday morning at ~11am. There was a much longer wait when we were leaving a bit after 12 noon. Seemed very typical/average as Chicago brunch waiting goes.

2011-11-07,4.0,"I've been to Bongo Room three times for breakfast and absolutely loved it. If you're health-conscious, this is NOT the place for you but there IS a Trader Joe's across the street :). Come here only if you're looking to leave full, satisfied and blatantly ignore any and all calorie counts.  I've had the banana/Heath bar pancakes (amazing), the egg scramble (pretty good) and the white chocolate/pretzel pancakes (amazing) - Not all at once though, of course :). This place has quite the local following and I haven't been to the Wicker Park location yet, so I can only speak for this location when I advise readers to get there EARLY, preferably right before opening time in order to get a table right away. Bongo Room is very popular with the local students and young twentysomethings in the area.  Bongo Room is small but charming and the breakfasts are, of course, to die for. They are very popular and every time I've been here I've had to wait at least 20 minutes to be seated - That is in NO way a complaint, though! I don't mind waiting because the food and the service are worth it. Waitstaff are all very cheerful and friendly and the hostess always has a smile on her face, even when the morning crowds start to complain or get a little antsy. Wish I could've gotten her name so I could've called her out with a compliment for awesome service, but I didn't :( - I just know that she worked in the AM yesterday. Like I said, there will almost certainly be a wait if you go, but don't sweat it - My favorite thing to do is find a place at the bar area to chill out at, grab a cappucino or a hot chocolate and people-watch to my heart's content until my table is ready. You won't be bored.   Anyways, everyone should stop by and try this place once - The pancakes are great and unless you're superhuman (or very, very hungover), you will almost certainly leave with leftovers. Although I think you can order smaller helpings, half-stacks, etc, because the regular-sized orders are massive.

I decided to go for it and ordered the red velvet pancakes.  It was a struggle to eat more than 20% of the dish.  Obviously the point is for it to be like a red velvet cake and on that front, they succeed.   I just thought they would be more like pancakes that tasted like red velvet and not like eating a dense layer cake at 9:30 in the morning.  It was just too much for me. My boyfriend did like his orange ricotta pancakes, which were lighter in consistency and not as sweet.   Service was okay.  Our waitress was very perfunctory and didn't seem to be very happy to be there.   It is worth trying if you're into this kind of thing for breakfast.",0.9679,0.822,0.152,0.026,0.4176470588235294

2011-08-26,4.0,"Great brunch spot, definitely in the top 5 places to brunch in Chicago. They only serve brunch on Saturdays and Sundays, and they have a lunch menu that is only served during the weekdays....which I haven't tried yet. The Wabash location is a little bit smaller than the Wicker Park one, but the wait in Wicker is usually longer....especially during the prime brunching rush hour which is Saturday and Sunday between 11am and 2pm. If you're planning on going around those times, be prepared to wait about 30-45mins for Wabash and 45-60mins for Wicker Park. The good thing is that you can get a cup of coffee or juice at the bar while you wait.  And now for the good stuff....the FOOD of course! Menu is not extensive, pretty basic except for the pancake choices which changes every so often. They have your usual eggs with bacon or sausage selection, a breakfast burrito, a version or two of eggs benedict, make your own omelet, and mother of all french toast creations....the chocolate tower french toast(bittersweet chocolate chunk bread stuffed with maple mascarpone, banana crème brulee sauce, bananas & shaved chocolate). The rest of the choices are going to be a variety of pancake creations....red velvet, Oreo, pumpkin spice, nutella and bananas, etc.....They change it up frequently so you never know what you're gonna get.  Here are my recommendations in no particular order:  1. Breakfast burrito - good size and fresh ingredients, your choice of bacon or sausage...they're both good  2. The chocolate tower french toast - huge portion, really good for sharing so you can try other menu items as well  3. Red Velvet Pancakes - if you like red velvet, this is a must try  4. Oreo Pancakes - mix of  chocolate and buttermilk batter, then smothered in chocolate and vanilla sauce with crushed Oreos on top...mmmm! Quick Tip:  They allow you to order a full, short stack, or 1 piece of their pancake selections.  So if you can't make a decision, you can ask for 1 of each and have a pancake buffet!",0.9864,0.839,0.127,0.034,0.4552083333333333

2011-06-26,2.0,"Brunch is my favorite meal of the week, and it's a hard meal to mess up. Give me some eggs, maybe some French toast, and keep the coffee coming, and I will leave a happy customer. I have always assumed that brunch was beloved worldwide, and that every city could boast a number of solid brunch spots. Given my experience at Bongo Room, however, and the overwhelming number of five star reviews, I must ask you, Chicago - HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MINDS? There is no way this place is worth standing in line for over an hour for.  We were prepared for a wait and were not surprised by the 90 minute time we were quoted. The waiting area is small, but again this is not a surprise. Luckily it was nice outside so we hung out in the sunshine until enough space opened up inside the door. It would be nice if they could put some benches on the sidewalk. It also seemed like a lot of people either abandoned their spot on the list or did not hear their names called. It does seem like there is some room for improvement in their system.  The food is where I felt Bongo Room really let me down. Especially for the price, I was expecting not only very well executed brunch classics, but also some innovative twists. Most of the food was only meh. The absolute biggest disappointment, though, were the red velvet pancakes. Luckily we ordered these to share and everyone had another entree, because anyone stuck eating these for breakfast would have left hungry. They were so bad that we spent our meal trying to figure out what had been left out of the batter. Honestly the only flavors were flour and water - they were heavy like cement and had an awful texture. You cannot improve cement by putting cream cheese frosting on it, dudes. It was an all-around failure.  Nothing else that we ate approached the train wreck-like quality of the pancakes. I had the BLT Benedict and really liked the pesto Hollandaise sauce. One of my friends ordered the breakfast burrito and pronounced it excellent, although it came with a miniscule amount of salsa and there is an additional charge for more salsa. Come on, dudes, if you're charging $9 for a burrito you can comp some condiments. Another friend ordered the vegetarian croissant sandwich and also enjoyed it, although we'd now recommend you order your egg prepared other than poached - it makes for a messy sandwich! All of the entrees came with potatoes that were ... weird. Not delicious. They were heavy on some kind of herb that I remember figuring out halfway through breakfast and have since forgotten. I can see how some people might love them, but they just did not do it for me.  To top off our mediocre-to-really-poor food experience, I was very underwhelmed and sometimes grossed out by the service. The place was incredibly busy, but welcome to the world of brunch - I've been to dozens of restaurants that handle being slammed better than Bongo Room. From the reviews, it doesn't look like this is a new thing for the restaurant. Step it up and train your staff right! Keep my coffee filled, take my order promptly, check in to make sure everything is OK. The only thing they managed to do quickly was to bring us our check - eager to get us out the door, much? As I was leaving, I noticed one of the runners was also preparing toast and English muffins at a toaster in the window to the kitchen. This is the guy who had been running clean and dirty plates back and forth to tables. Touching food and plating it with his bare hands. Seriously, dudes? I am hoping that in your kitchen the people touching my food have clean hands, at least. I don't need hands that are all over your dining room pawing my bread. I'm glad I didn't see this until after I'd eaten because it would have seriously dampened my appetite.",0.9965,0.752,0.162,0.087,0.583464470964471

This location of The Bongo Room was our first breakfast on our way to The Field Museum. I had some french toast/berry compote monstrosity and it was AMAZING!! I quickly realized why I was asked if I wanted a half order (which I totally should have ordered). The Boy had the Tomatillo Salsa Scramble (for the first of two times over our weekend visit).  The service was SPOT ON. It was late on a Friday morning and the place was busy but not swamped. We were sat right away at a quiet table in the corner.  We never felt rushed and our waitress was very good. My only complaint is the location of the bathroom.

For a party of three, there was no wait, and we were able to eat at our own speed with peace. I like how the restaurant is clean and bright and the service quick and pleasant. My mom got the veggie sandwich with a croissant. Unfortunately, they ran out of croissant already, so we had to opt for multigrain toast. What was most surprisingly was the size of the sandwich. The fillings were pouring out and two slices of toast was definitely not enough to eat this thing. This was definitely a fork and knife sandwich, which my mom happily devoured. I got the orange ricotta hotcakes which have to be one of the best pancakes I've ever tasted. It was moist and just heavy enough to have a perfect texture that melted straight in your mouth. My sister got the white chocolate and berry flapjacks, which were equally as good.  I even stole a picture of my neighbor's pancakes while we were waiting for our food because it looked so amazing. My neighbors, one boy and one girl, ordered three entrees, and I was shocked to see them leave with only a quarter of the pancake eaten. It was obvious they didn't know the portions of the entrees here at Bongo Room. Luckily, my sister recommended that we get just one pancake each, so we could also try their blueberry french toast, which was amazing.

We had quite a wait (about an hour), but I was too busy caffeinating to really notice.  Once seated, a friendly server quickly brought us the water our bodies were desperately craving and since we'd studied the menus meticulously while waiting, we quickly put in our order.  The food definitely took longer than I'd normally expect, even with taking into consideration that the restaurant was fairly slammed.  But the lead-up was all worth it, because nothing cures a hangover quite like dessert inspired pancakes.   You see, I'm a ridiculous person when it comes to breakfast--gotta have something savory and sweet--so I was extremely pleased I was able to order one Banana Heath pancake with my omelet special.  Sure there was no way I'd finish it all, even equipped with a monstrous appetite that only heavy drinking can induce, but you'll never hear me complain about portions being too large.   One of my friends I was dining with got the white chocolate brioche French Toast with some berries, which looked divine (and I don't even really care for FT normally).  The other went for the Red Velvet pancakes, which I had to sample, since I've totally jumped on the ""RV is Trendy"" bandwagon and typically order it wherever I can.  They were good, but I actually preferred my Banana Heath ones, because the supersugary heath factor was a lot more subtle than the overwhelming cocoa flavor of the RV.  The omelet was just okay, but it was Mexican inspired and I'm from LA, so I knew I was setting myself up for inevitable disappointment and went with it anyway.  Side breakfast potatoes could have used a little more pizazz, or at least some salt.  That's easily fixable, though. l must say I'm a big believer in the hair of the dog recovery method, and the lack of a bloody mary or mimosa with my meal slightly bummed me out.  Not a deal-breaker, though, and I hope to be back at Bongo Room again soon.",0.9896,0.782,0.154,0.064,0.5082716049382715

From the minute we entered we were treated rudely with curt answers and smirks from the hostess, then had the unhelpful waitress (who insisted we order all of our food at once - we wanted to order sweet pancakes for a ""dessert"").

2011-05-02,1.0,"A very mediocre food experience. Arrived on a Sunday morning to this venue because of the reviews that the Wicker Park site tends to have a longer wait. The wait at 11:30 was about an hour, but it went by pretty quickly because of the beautiful weather outside. My fiance and I decided to share the classic eggs benedict, a single slice of the brioche french toast with lemon curd and blueberry compote, and a single red velvet pancake. We usually do the salty/sweet pairings, and I'm especially glad we did this time! I should just start off my saying I do not have a sweet tooth but my fiance does, and even for him, the french toast and pancake were too sweet. The flavors of the french toast were quite good (lemon and blueberry is a favorite combination of mine), but awash with sugar. I like to taste my fruit! So my idea of a good pancake is the Clinton Street Baking Company blueberry pancake...so perhaps you can fault me for even trying the red velvet pancake. But I wanted to try it, because I love the classic cupcake so much. Condensing the flavors into such a flat, large surface area decreases the fluff ratio to nearly nil, and the texture ends up being doughy and slick. It not only fails to evoke the classic cupcake, but also falls flat as a good pancake. (Pancakes are supposed to be fluffy too..right...?) The eggs benedict was also poorly executed. When my fork first pierced the egg, clear fluid flowed out. Ie, uncooked egg white. A brunch place that can't even poach an egg properly? No thanks!",0.993,0.783,0.176,0.041,0.3880668934240363
2011-05-02,1.0,"If you're looking to have a five-year old's palate validated by a restaurant willing to serve you an entire birthday cake for brunch and pass it off as a meal, then by all means this is your place. If you've got no plans for the day and are content to sit around nursing a sugar hangover like you wouldn't believe, inevitable after eating here on the empty stomach you woke up with, then head on in.  But, you say, they have a full menu! No. Under no circumstances should you stray from the restaurant's singular strength, obscene heaps of dessert pancakes passed off as a meal. Their omlettes are pathetic: a homogenous disk of liquid egg (a la McDonalds) lovelessly flopped over (rather than mixed with) a lukewarm and usually segregated scoop of whatever fillings you've ordered.  Omlettes would constitute a real breakfast anyway, and if you want that, there are about 30 better places to find it within a 15 minute walk of the Bongo. Given the hour-long wait you'll have, there'd be ample time to walk to one, have a real breakfast, and come back in time for dessert.  If you serve somebody enough sugar in one sitting, they'll be temporarily happy. Nothing else needs to matter, and obviously here, nothing else does.  One tip: when waiting, DO stand inside. If you're a party of two and close to the hostess stand, they'll generally bypass the suckers on the list rather than expend energy walking out side and yelling names. Of special note: If you're visiting the city, don't plan to do any sightseeing after a ""breakfast"" here. You'll be miserable all day.  In Summation: If you don't have the sugar tolerance of a Statistically Typical Midwestern American circa 2011, don't even try this.

We were seated in a corner bench table, and then it was on to the adventure of which delicious sounding entree to try. Everything sounded so good, and yet, surprisingly enough we both ended up settling on the same dish: a breakfast burrito.  Sadly this location does not offer alcohol so no tasty mimosas, however their coffee is good, and they have a decent selection of tea to choose from.  The burritos was as delicious as described. The perfect blend of flavors and textures, and very well-portioned, and served w/ a side of potatoes to boot. I was ravenous and finished off my plate, my companion was not able to. A very generous serving size indeed.  Since we were in a booth-style table along the windows, we did not have to combat the crowded-ness of the dining area, though it was noted as we traveled to and from out table.

Who wants to eat dry pancakes?? I ate about one and a half of them and there was no cream cheese topping left.  Anyone that goes here knows that the pancake are nothing with out the toppings.  I decide I would like to bring them home since I paid $10 bucks for them and don't like to waste.  I ask the gentle man packing up my food for a little extra cream cheese so that I may enjoy them later.  It took our waitress about 7minutes to come back look me in the eye and say we don't have any more red velvet cream cheese topping and the kitchen is closed.... Looking around seeing people still waiting on there food and it was what 1pm and they serve lunch too?????  So then I ask I wouldn't mind any other topping, that would do just fine (they have  about 6 different type of pancakes every day)  and her name is Halo. she looked me in the eye and said we don't have any left and walked away quickly with out letting me reply!!!!!  I couldn't believe she would say such a ridiculous lie to my face it was very insulting.   I mean your known for your pancakes and your out of all the toppings that go on them WOW can't believe I payed $10 bucks and this place is so cheap they wouldn't give me just a little extra topping so that I could eat the pancakes later.  The worst part was Halo just lied right to may face.... I mean she could have said it's policy we don't give extra topping or WHATEVER but she made up that they where all out of everything.   I won't be going back there ever!!!!

2011-02-14,4.0,"We came in with one mission: those pretzel pancakes that everyone keeps talking about. Honestly, they weren't spectacular. They were a little dense and dry, and all the sauce gets soaked up by the top pancake so the bottom ones are even drier. I was expecting more pretzels and a little bit of crunch... instead of pretzels throughout the batter, the pretzels were finely crushed and sprinkled on top right before the pancake is flipped. The sauce is likely to put you into a diabetic coma if you make it through the whole dish. Not what I was expecting. Not terrible, but just...not mind-blowing. However, we split their smoked duck breast benedict with crunchy leeks - totally saved the meal, it was amazing! Seriously one of the best benedicts I have ever had. Potatoes were seasoned well and nicely crispy. I've had dreams about that benedict several times now. Highly recommended.

My BF had the duck breast eggs benedict and I ordered the half order (2 pancakes) of red velvet pancakes. I also had a side of bacon as suggested by some other reviewers. The eggs benedict was pretty darn delicious. The potatoes that came with the benedict was just ok, seasoned well, but the texture was too mushy. I like my potatoes a little crispier in texture. The red velvet pancakes were pretty delicious. Although very sweet, the bacon on the side did help a lot. I could only eat half and brought the rest home.

It was not a horrible wait and the food was decent. I personally do not think that the food was worth the price but it was decent. As my friend and I started to finish our meal we were visited by almost all of the waitstaff on duty that day asking us if we wanted our food wrapped up. I continued for the next 10 minutes. It seemed like every 2 minutes it was a new waitress visiting our table asking us about wrapping up our food and if we needed the check. It became almost annoying and we both had a feeling that they wanted us to leave. Finally, we spoke to the ""posing manager for the day"" who explained to us that there was a line of people waiting for a table and they needed the table. We explained to the manager that we can understand that but there was a better way of conveying that message without being rude. To get an idea of the time frame we arrived at 10:30am and was sat by 10:45am. We ordered food by 10:55am and received our food by 11:10am.

Four of us split: Caramelized Apple and Toasted Walnut Flapjacks, Smoked Duck Breast Benedict, and Tomatillo Salsa Scramble. All three were so, SO mouth-wateringly good. I don't think I've had brunch food this memorable in a long, long time. Highly recommend. Some highlights: - Perfect texture in the flapjacks. They were thick with the right amount of fluffiness and I couldn't stop eating them. Could. Not. Stop. - My friend's Banana Oreo Hotcakes. While I prefer savory foods for brunch, this was tasty because it really emphasized the Oreo and banana and didn't overuse sugar. - BIG portions. More than enough for 2 meals. For example, the Chocolate Tower French Toast was, quite literally, a tower. Downsides: - Not much room to wait (and you will definitely have to wait if you come on a weekend). My suggestion is get a coffee and wait in the little alcove near the windows right next to the door. - Waited about 40 minutes for a table -- granted, they originally told us an hour so getting a table in a little over half an hour for 8 people is really not too bad. - Kind of cramped inside since it's a small place.

This seems simple but I can't tell you how many restaurants would not offer this option or would make you buy full portions of both and charge you accordingly. Speaking of the red velvet pancakes, they would have been my ""best ever"" pancakes if I had ordered them alone.  Again, just made to perfection.

Since moving to Chinaport (my nickname for our area in Bridgeport next to Chinatown), it's been fun trying out new places, since I'm mostly familiar with downtown and north side eat spots. Bongo Room is a sunny, casual yet trendy eatery that sits around the corner from Yolk, which is a bit more pedestrian. We've tried many things on the menu including the gigantic french toast offerings, but my favorite is an egg white omelette with scallions, chicken sausage and Havarti cheese with hash browns and wheat toast. The food is well-prepared and that's a bonus because many busy restaurants drop the ball when trying to prepare a ton of breakfast dishes in hurry.

2010-12-20,5.0,"My wife and I had breakfast there this Monday morning. We were in the city on a mini-vacation from the western suburbs. She had the Toasted Egg Croissant with Bacon and Cheese. I had a special, the Brioche French Toast with Apples and Raisins. The brioche bread appealed to me as I love the brioche ham and cheese sandwich at Labriola Bakery, but that is another review. We split them meals between the two of us, as we often do. The waitress seemed to sense we were going to do this and offered an extra plate before asking. Service was excellent, the waitress was of the bubbly type and just attentive enough. The food I would rate as a very good to excellent. The french toast was three huge pieces of bread stacked high dripping with a very rich, sweet, white sauce. The croissant was also very good. It came with fried potatoes, that reminded me of the ones my grandfather would cook up on the weekends.    There was a handwritten sign on the door when got there indicating they would not be opening until 9am (normal opening is at 8am). As we were standing outside the door around 8:30 trying to decide on another place, the waitress unlocked the door and  invited us in. We had the place to ourselves until our food arrived - i guess weekday lunch and weekend brunch are their busy times. Sometimes being the only one in a restaurant is an odd experience, but the busy corner location left us able to people watch.

Party for two, and we waited about 30 minutes at 10:30am, which I think is about average for brunch on Sunday in Chicago.  The menu looked delicious - unfortunately I was experiencing some tummy trouble so couldn't venture to try some of the crazy options (e.g., the red velvet pancakes or the white chocolate and caramel pretzel pancakes) and it seems from other reviews this might have pushed up the star rating - but I had a really delicious omelette. They have a great variety of ingredients and you can choose 3 with egg whites for 10.25, which is great. I tried spinach, mushroom and grilled chicken and it was perfectly cooked, hot and fresh, and very savory and tasty.  One thing that seems to separate brunch places in Chicago is the side potatoes - I've seen a lot of different versions of this, and have some favorites (Yolk) and not so favorites (Orange) - Bongo Room falls in the middle. The potatoes are red potatoes that are partially ""smashed"" and mixed with some spices, so they have a nice little kick. I prefer the crispy little fried bits that you can dip in ketchup, aka french fries haha, but some people might like this better than I do.

Their offering of omelets and various egg dishes provides a savory counterpart to the decadence of their pancakes and french toast.  If you go with a sweet breakfast, be especially sure to get the coffee.  They use an intelligentsia blend which is strong enough to cut through the richness of many of their dishes.  All of the ingredients are high quality- the potatoes, though I would prefer them a bit more crispy, were tasty and the fresh dill brought them to a new level. The roast duck eggs benedict was well executed, the hollandaise was very good.  Personally, I would like my english muffin crispier, and the dish cooled down rather quickly, had the plates been warmed this would have been prevented.  Overall the dishes here are unique and benefit from small details like fresh dill and a delicious cup of coffee to accompany the meal.",0.9959,0.71,0.266,0.024,0.5272427398989898

The menu is fairly limited and skews heavily towards decadent, rich, sugary breakfast items with a few omelets and traditional breakfast options thrown in.   They seem to have a pretty decent selection of coffee drinks and the coffee is actually quite good since they use Intelligentsia coffee.  I only ordered a regular brew so I can't speak to the espresso drinks.   We waited about 5 minutes for our server to arrive at the table and the first words out of her mouth were, ""Are you ready to order?"".  To me, at a place that averages $10+ for breakfast items that is totally inappropriate and completely unprofessional.  I don't even think you can get away with that at Denny's.  I proceeded to order my $13 Mexican omelet and asked that my hash browns be cooked well done, I don't really like potatoes but when they are crispy they are acceptable.  As much as I thought the first words out of our server's mouth were unprofessional this is where it got interesting, ""They are already cooked so I'm not sure the kitchen can do that.  I will see what I can do.""  What? You will see what you can do?  No one was asking for mountains to be moved, just throw the f*cking potatoes back on the flat top or back under the broiler for 2 minutes and be done with it.  Or at least lie to me and say ""no problem"" and blame the kitchen when they don't come out right.  Total turn off and I feel like I'm generally a pretty accepting customer. Omelet was good but I could have gotten the same thing down the road for half the price with friendly service and chips and salsa.  I also thought it was a bit odd that I didn't get my coffee refilled till I asked the food runner to do so that brought us our meals.  Once our server thought we were getting close to finishing I had 6 coffee refill requests and the check dropped off without asking if she could get us anything else that morning.   Perfect example of bad service ruining a decent meal.  Again, I could really care less if you are at a turn and burn dinner with a $18 check total but when your bill comes to $40+ for breakfast expectations are a bit different.

Along with that we ordered the pumpkin pancakes, a side of hash browns and, just because we needed some protein, some Thai sausages.  The pumpkin pancakes were delicious. They were served with some maple syrup butter that obviated the need to put any syrup on the pancakes (on the excellent recommendations of the waitress, who brought the syrup but hinted that it was optional). The sausages were awesome (not the best deal on the menu but some needed protein). The hash browns? Well, I forgot we were in northern climes. Y'all do not understand what hash browns are.

2010-10-17,3.0,"2.5 stars (sloooow service, really slow) I had high expectations for this place, but after dining here this past Saturday around 1:15pm, I thought this was a very average brunch place.  Perhaps I will give it another try at some point, but nothing stood out about this place for me. Let's start with the fresh squeezed orange juice.  At $4.25 for a ""large,"" I received what I would term to be a pretty small glass of OJ - probably half the size of a pint beer glass, which made me wonder what the ""small"" would be at $3.25.  Anyways, it always annoys me when fresh squeezed OJ is overpriced. In terms of the main courses, the three of us ordered eggs benedict - considering half of their brunch menu is eggs benedict, we assumed that these would be phenomenal.  I ordered the BLT eggs benedict, which consisted of your standard eggs benedict, except with regular bacon instead of Canadian bacon (better this way, always) and spinach.  My friends ordered a smoked duck benedict, and another benedict with feta cheese.  All of us thought the eggs benedict could have been better - the egg was poached nicely, and I appreciated the crispy English muffin underneath, but the Hollandaise sauce was a bit on the cold side (ugh, cold Hollandaise is NEVER a good thing - this could be part of the fact the service was so slow), but the overall flavor just did not stand out.  You would expect a place that has multiple eggs benedict items on the menu to specialize in this dish, but alas, that was not the case. The service was also really slow.  Granted this place closes at 2pm on a Saturday, it took us over 30 minutes from ordering to receiving our eggs benedicts.  The Hollandaise was getting a bit cold already, which have been due to the fact that our entrees might have just been sitting out there before we were served them.  Fail.  Anyways, if I come back here again (a big IF), I will probably try some of their pancakes and french toast, which looked a bit more promising when I was looking around the restaurant.   Other notes - the breakfast potatoes that came with the eggs benedict were mediocre to plain bad.  I never understand when breakfast places can't perfect their potatoes that they seem to give out with every dish...these were soft/soggy and not flavorful at all.",0.9546,0.865,0.088,0.047,0.44895168323739754

Luckily, my friend and I always go the one sweet, one savory route, and share our dishes.  Lately we've been rocking the beef tenderloin sandwich and their white chocolate/caramel covered pretzel pancakes.  Absolute heaven.  A good hearty sandwich and pancakes good enough to make the sugar coma worth it.  The staff here is always super friendly - ask for some extra sauce for your pancakes and they'll bring you a whole saucer, not some tiny dispenser with a couple of drops.  Ask to leave a few toppings off a sandwich and you'll get a server suggesting you get everything on the side so you can still try everything.  Of course when this happened to me, my little piglet self ended up loving everything, and I never would've known it if I didn't take her up on her offer.   On a side note, I decided to have my office bday lunch here.  Not only were they able to accommodate our group of fifteen perfectly, but this is the only place we've been to that was set up on time and ready for us when we arrived.  Our waitress was also super patient while everyone decided on what to order.  This after sending everyone a copy of the menu, hoping to break them in ahead of time and cut back on the shock and awe reaction to the amazingness of Bongo Room's menu.  How dare they doubt me.",0.965,0.822,0.127,0.051,0.529320987654321

And of course, since it's the Bongo Room and it was a Sunday, there was a little bit of wait, but it actually ended up being shorter than I thought it was. Maybe 30 min at most.  There were so many tempting things on the menu, but I know I made the right decision because... Oh. My. God.  The Red Velvet Hotcakes are warm heaven on a plate! Seriously. I kid you not. The pancakes were perfectly fluffy, red & chocolate-y and the vanilla sauce it came with wasn't overpowering. It was the perfect amount of moderate sweetness. It was amazing, like punch someone in the face good. My friend almost lost it when she tasted some of mine. It's worth multiple return visits a week. Just for those pancakes.

Rather than your typical scrambled eggs or French toast, Bongo Room boasts more interesting (and delicious) options, such as pumpkin and zucchini pancakes with white chocolate and caramel, or my personal favorite, bacon banana pancakes with maple butter (I get them without the bacon and they are equally fantastic). Sticking with pancakes, most people swear by the lemon ricotta version. Or, if you prefer, Bongo Room also offers tasty non-pancake treats, such as perfect Eggs Benedict or the Chocolate Tower of French Toast. Either way, you get the idea - this is not your typical brunch place. The only complaint for Bongo Room would be the wait - the best time to visit is during the week.

The decision wasn't easy, but I eventually I settled on the veggie breakfast croissant.  I wanted something delicious, but a little on the lighter side and it didn't disappoint.  The veggies were piled high on one mother of a croissant.  It was light, flaky and filled with sprouts, tomatoes, cucumber, gruyere cheese and an egg.  On the side was breakfast potatoes that had dill and it was just as good.  I had to stop myself from eating the entire plate. I really wish that I was a sweet tooth person though because the lemon ricotta pancakes and the red velvet cakes looked so good.  Maybe one day we'll just have to order a short stack as ""dessert"".

The breakfast burrito was bland, as was the benedict.  It didn't help that I thought I was going to eat a burrito touched by the hand of God, but isn't salt a basic ingredient in every recipe since the beginning of time?  Savory breakfasts 0-2. The brioche french toast w/ vanilla bean something and strawberries for days was the single best breakfast item I've had in Chicago.  The hype on the sweet items is not overstated.  I still think about that french toast and as god is my witness I will learn to execute it and some day pass it off as my own.  My friends will beg me to go into business and I will modestly refuse...  The wait on a Saturday at 11am is 45 minutes.  That's standard for most good places downtown.   There is no parking and I don't live by any direct means of transportation to the place... once I add the parking meter fare onto the breakfast bill Bongo Room immediately leaves my go-to breakfast list.  Which is good, because 2 months of brioche french toast would result in an additional monetary investment in new pants.",0.9816,0.836,0.134,0.03,0.3931758056758057

Slowly but surely we saw people all around us (even people that were seated 15 minutes after us) received their food and started eating. We thought nothing of it since it was busy, but 20 minutes later, people started leaving that were sat after us! Our waitress noticed that we had yet to get our food and told us that she was going to check on it. 2 mins later she returns (empty handed) and tells us that it will be out shortly. 10 mins later (and 3 cups of coffee later), we still had yet to get our food. By this time we had been sitting for nearly 45 mins and our waitress was no where to be found.  We decided to leave. We flagged down the host and asked for our bill- but informed him that we did not want the food (just the coffee) on the bill because we were never served. He asked what the problem was and my husband told him what had happened. He looked us in the eye and told us to "" DON't COME BACK"" I WAS STUNNED- I didn't know what to say but he was so rude. We went to him very calmly and wanted to speak with him or the manager about what had happened but he told us to ""NOT WORRY ABOUT IT AND DON'T COME BACK!!! We wanted to pay for our coffee and leave the waitress a tip but he wouldn't even give us the ticket. He crushed it in his hand and told us not to come back. So we walked down the street the Eleven City Diner - which is always great, quick and the staff is excellent. Hell- the owner is back there behind the bar as the soda jerk making soda and dessert!  My recommendation is don't visit this place - the service sucks and the food is extremely limited. Not worth the time or the effort to drag your butt down there just to be told not to come back.",-0.9807,0.846,0.05,0.104,0.3523561507936508

2010-03-23,4.0,"Great brunch spot, if you can stand the long wait. This is less of a problem in warmer months, since you can grab a coffee from the side bar and wait outside. There is not a lot of space inside, so in winter you are either crammed against a wall or you walk a block to Yolk which has ample waiting room (sorry BR, you're just too popular...). My party of four showed up around 1pm on a particularly nasty Saturday afternoon. We waited about 25 minutes for a table but luckily squeezed into the coffee bar area and warmed up with some hot beverages in the interim. I like that you don't have to pay for your coffee there, they just magically put it on your meal tab. So many places can't figure stuff like this out. It makes for less of a hassle in the cramped waiting area.  The breakfast menu isn't huge, and doesn't have some standbys like plain old buttermilk pancakes. I guess the idea is to try something new, like a giant tower of chocolate french toast or zucchini pancakes. I went with the smoked salmon benedict, and it was solid. Eggs could have been runnier but the salmon and the hollandaise were right on. Rick had the apple tarte tatin pancakes and wasn't that happy with them, even though I thought they were effing wonderful. Almost too sweet, but the tart apple saves it. Our friends split the aforementioned chocolate tower and loved it. I really wanted to try some but just could not fit any more in. My order came with a side of breakfast potatoes, which are more like homestyle potatoes rather than hashbrowns. Rick ordered an additional side of these, but we definitely could have gotten away with just splitting mine.  Service was great. Very prompt with our immediate requests for maple syrup and ketchup, and kept the hot water/coffee flowing.",0.993,0.789,0.168,0.043,0.5621785077667432

The Bongo Room is known for its great sweet treats (inventive French toasts and pancakes), but unfortnately I had the taste for something savory (menu items a bit lacking in this department, but then again-I wasn't looking at the brunch menu).  Breakfast/lunch here can run you anywhere from $8-$13.   I went with the breakfast croissant with eggs (any way you want them), bacon, and muenster cheese.  Loved it!  Big portions and my plate was littered with hashbrowns (think big chunky cubes of soft herbed potatoes).  I'm a girl who likes her sausage...chicken sausage that is.  So I couldn't pass up trying their Thai chicken sausage with ginger.  Well, I should have just passed.  Sausage was bland at best.

The service was incredibly efficient, if not outstandingly friendly.  They took our juice and coffee order right away, and our food orders very shortly thereafter.  The food came out unbelievably quickly, and was very good.  We both stuck to the more classic egg dishes, since all of the different pancakes looked more like desserts, but they were very good, and the portions were quite large.  The ""hash browns"" - which were actually roasted red skinned potatoes - were outstanding.

Downside: it's very noisy, particularly when it's packed, which is just about every weekend.  Very difficult to have a conversation when the place is packed.

2010-02-27,3.0,"Eh, if I'm being honest.... it was just okay. It didn't suck, but I definitely didn't leave here plotting my return either. I came here this morning for brunch with a friend who had been raving about this place for months. I finally gave in, despite the fact that they didn't serve alcohol. Sorry, but I only require two things at brunch to make me happy - mimosas and bacon. Anything else is icing on the cake. ""Are you going to be okay without your morning buzz?"" my friend asked me. Hrmph. BUT! I did some searching and called, and found out they are BYOB! They must not advertise it, and when I called to confirm my internet findings the woman seemed reluctant to tell me. But FYI, you CAN bring your own bubbly if you're like me and need your mimosa fix at brunch. (It's a shame Sam's across the street closed!) Sadly, by the time today rolled around it wasn't going to be a good plan to be drinking, so I went without mimosas so I could be presentable for post-brunch activities. Sigh. On to the important stuff... We lucked out and came at just the right time, and once we were both there we were seated immediately. About 5 minutes after we sat down my friend noticed the entryway was packed with people. Yikes. I decided to go with one of their specials - brown sugar french toast. The food came out so quickly I thought, ""whoa."" But... they didn't bring my side of bacon. I waited for a couple minutes, thinking perhaps the food runner had his hands full and went back to get it. Nada. Finally I flagged down our server and she promptly brought it out, but didn't even apologize. Well. Okay then. The french toast was good - it wasn't overwhelmingly sweet at all, like I was sort of dreading. But it didn't taste... special. It tasted like regular french toast, drowning in a cream sauce and topped with apples. Honestly I didn't even taste brown sugar, and when your dish is called ""brown sugar french toast"" I guess I was expecting to taste a little of that. I just wasn't wowed at all, and I guess I was sort of expecting to be. The bacon (once I got it) was really good though, so thank god for that. My friend was extremely pleased with her breakfast burrito, and I sampled some of her potatoes and thought, ""meh. I've had way better."" The thing that really bugged me about this place was the service. The hostess was perfectly friendly when I arrived, but... our server just wasn't that great. When we were seated she promptly came over and greeted us, then gave us time to look over the menus... and then didn't come back. We waited for a very long time for her to come back to take our orders, despite her making eye contact with us several times. Then the bacon incident and lack of apology. 30 seconds after dropping off the bacon she did ask if we were okay, and I knew it was wise to ask her for more water then, because sure enough she was MIA throughout the rest of our meal. But once she dropped the check she was very eager to get us out of there. You know... that bugs me. I've worked at a restaurant, and my friend has as well. We know all about turning tables when it's busy, and we aren't people who camp out when there's clearly a wait. But don't provide subpar service and then rush us out the door. Nothing annoys me more. And I guess this sort of explains why they don't seem to advertise that they're BYOB - drinkers are more likely to camp out, and they'd rather turn tables. Fair enough. Either way, I don't think I'll be rushing back here. That's not to say I would never eat here again, but I'd definitely be a little reluctant to agree to come back.

I went to Bongo Room after reading review after review about their amazing pancakes.  My husband and I went on a late Sunday morning and waited for 45 minutes for a table.  Two other couples occupied the waiting area seats, so we had to stand.  Really, hover around the hostess.  It was pretty awkward to wait there because we could see the servers grabbing the food - they keep their bread for toast in those clear plastic drawers like college kids take to their dorms for socks storage.  How do they sanitize those things? When we were finally seated, we were brought into their bright, lively dining room.  I was really impressed by the pancake menu, and I couldn't decide what to order.  I asked the waitress if I could get a split order of two different types, and she said yes.  She failed to elaborate and tell me that instead of getting one full order (4 pancakes) with 2 of each pancake, I would get a ""half"" order of 3 of each pancake.  These pancakes are HUGE and COVERED in the syrup/frosting/sauce.  There was so much sugary coating on the pancakes that I was stuffed after only three bites of each.  I couldn't believe the waitress didn't think to warn me.  Then I was charged for two full orders minus about $4 as the reduced size discount.  Very annoying.  These pancakes are not a good breakfast option.  They'd be awesome for anyone craving breakfast food late at night when one's stomach can handle all that sugar.

How have I not reviewed ______ yet?!"" Well, this was/is that review. My first Bongo Room experience was at the Wicker Park location five years ago. Crowded, loud, spotty service, bad waiting space in crappy weather, not much intent to make it a regular haunt.  Then I discovered its more laid back, roomier, friendlier sibling in the south Loop and bingo - one of my new favorite brunch spots had made the radar. The staff is always friendly, the coffee stays hot and filled (Intelligentisa, even better), and while I am not a sweets-for-breakfast type, the single serving s'more or nutella and banana pancakes top a person off exactly right. I love the steak benedict, actually all their benedicts, in particular.  This most recent visit was a let down though and had I actually written the update, I would have docked at least one star. We sat and ordered at the same time as the table next to us with the same sever, but their food came out several minutes before ours. When ours did arrive, the bacon had cooled, the poached eggs were mostly set and I found a piece of egg shell in my dish. Truly, truly unhappy with that experience. I rarely mention things like that to staff or management, but that was one of those times I wish would have because meals there aren't cheap. Egg shells in diner food ok, but when brunch for two rounds $40 I was probably within my rights.  But overall, in the last several years of Bongo Room dinings, that one time does not speak on how often that brunch is right on and the fact that I try to guide the brunch bus in that direction whenever I have the vote.

The BEST thing about the Bongo Room in my humble opinion can be summed up in three words: chocolate pretzel pancakes. The creative use of pretzels in menus is a treat in Chicago; the Bongo Room ups the ante by adding a drizzle sauce of white chocolate and caramel, with strands of caramel expertly criss-crossed above the mammoth stack of four fluffy cakes.  (Next time, I might not succumb to the temptation of the full stack.  Because, if I'm in Chicago, there will be a next time.)  Chunks of sourdough pretzel mixed with the batter provided a sweet/savory juxtaposition. I also ordered the Thai-seasoned chicken sausage - a tasty protein companion to my mountain of carbs.  Seasoned, yet very appropriate for breakfast. The iced coffee was also tremendous - all warm days in Chi-town should begin with a glass.  Prices were very reasonable given the quality and quantity of food. The room is colorful and full of light.  I appreciated being able to admire the lovely Jasmine in front of a literal canvas of color blocks adorning the wall.  The dining room is street-level with a view of the busy Roosevelt/Wabash corner, just a few feet from a staircase leading to the L.

I went with my favorite, the rock shrimp and chorizo breakfast burrito. Now what is fun about when I come here, I eat. Talk? No. Not really. Not when there is some delicious, small shrimp, chorizo, eggs, cheese, avocado and wrapped in a lovely green tortilla. By the time our server came back to check on us, I had just joined the clean plate club, and guess what? Those pancakes were next.  Of course I shared. I certainly allowed the girls to get in their bites until I was ready to come in and do the ""Are you finished with that yet?"" and polish off another plate. Do not mess with me when I am down to go to town on brunch. Now when I am hungover, you can laugh.  Aaron was a gem of a server, super friendly, energetic, loved having fun and was certainly having fun with our group. What wasn't fun was trying to stay awake while the food coma was seeping in to my system. Thankfully, brunch doesn't happen every weekend, but when it does, Bongo Room is always a good choice for me.",0.9938,0.824,0.157,0.019,0.46599449303530943
2009-09-09,4.0,"I scoped out the Bongo Room before traveling to Chicago this past weekend, and it sounded like my dream breakfast pitstop.  Much of the menu is a combination between my two favorite food concepts: breakfast and dessert.  But if that doesn't get you going, their menu contains many other breakfast staples. Our cabby almost missed the joint because there is construction and the Wabash storefront is blocked by scaffolding.  But we turned the corner and sure enough, there it was.  The wait wasn't more than 15 minutes on a Saturday morning at 10:00am for a group of 7.  I was originally hesitant to order out of fear that the Banana Nestle Crunch pancakes would be too sweet, but I ordered the hashbrowns choosing jack cheese from their list of approx. 10 cheese toppers for my breakfast spuds.  Confident the salty breakfast side would compliment my sweet cakes, I relaxed for only a few minutes before being served.  We were served ridiculously fast...like 5 minutes max.   The food was delish and my coffee was stiff.  Exactly what I needed to get me through a long wedding Saturday.  My companions ordered everything from the white chocolate pretzel pancakes to the breakfast burrito.  There were no complaints.  I would return on my next trip to Chicago.",0.8909,0.816,0.113,0.071,0.517361111111111

2009-08-04,4.0,"...you hop off the plane at O'Hare at 7:30am with bags in hand - you're scheduled to meet your family who is driving in at 10:30 at the art museum - you catch the subway into town and hop off at Jackson - you make your way to Wabash - Hello Bongo Room...er, well, hello construction with Bongo Room Hidden behind it.  After a wonderful experience at the Wicker Park location back in December a return visit to the alternative location was only logical - what better way to kick off my first day out of the inpatient setting in nearly 2 months?  Making my way into the restaurant I was actually surprised at how empty the place was - but the smell of eggs, baking bread, and candy coated pancakes was anything but unexpected.  Seated quickly at a booth up front and handed a copy of the local paper I quickly browsed the menu - 4 pancake options and 2 french toast - decisions, decisions.    ""Are half portions available?"" ""Absolutely."" ""Which two would you recommend?"" ""Have you eaten here before, our pancakes are pretty big?"" ""Yes, I was too full after two full orders and I'm planning on lunch around noon, so which two would you recommend??""    Orders placed, coffee filled, I watched my neighbors tuck into a big pile of wonderful looking eggs and pulled out a copy of GQ to finish up the Tarantino article I'd been enjoying on the plane.  Waiting for approximately 20 minutes for my order I notably had to flag down an alternative waitress to fill my coffee as my waitress literally seemed to have disappeared after taking my order - but when she did return it was bearing the object I'd been craving; two heaping plates of dessert-style pancakes.  Denny's commercials be damned - ""Grown Up Breakfast"" is for the work week! Starting with the option recommended by my server (along with the caramel pretzel version which I declined as I had it on my last visit) I dug into my Black Forrest Cakes with Brandy Soaked Cherries, Warm Vanilla Panna Cotta Cream, and Chocolate Creme Anglaise.  On first taste I must admit I was struck by the wonderful flavor of the panna cotta cream and how it contrasted with the doughy pancakes.  Unfortunately once this initial impression passed I was suddenly aware of just how flavorless the cakes themselves were - literally doughy and sporting maybe 4 small cherries each (none of which tasted like Brandy.)  Without the absolute dousing of cream and crème I can honestly say these pancakes wouldn't have been much better than the standard McDonald's Hotcake - and had my server not stopped by and challenged me by asking ""you doing all right, would you like a take home box?"" I'd have likely not finished the plate.  Hey now, don't judge, I have my reputation of vacation gluttony to uphold! My second option, selected on my own accord because it simply sounded amazing fared much better than the Black Forrest - MUCH better indeed.  Entitled Banana Nestle Crunch Bar Flapjacks with warm Toffee Cream Sauce and Fresh Bananas the dish is exactly what it sounds like - banana accented flapjacks with a muffin-like texture absolutely loaded with melted and gooey nestle crunch bar and topped with a salty toffee sauce and at least 2 whole chopped bananas.  Comparable only to my one previous experience with banoffee pie this creation was smoothness contrasted with crunch, sugary sweet tempered by creamy savory, and absolutely excellent - on par with anything experienced on my past visit to the Bongo room, for sure. Sitting around waiting for my family to call I finished the issue of GQ and drank another 2 cups of coffee while watching the place slowly fill up and listening to a mix of The Decemberists, The Shins, and Radiohead, and Regina Spektor play over the stereo - I was never pressured to leave and everyone was friendly.  While not as great as my previous experience with the Bongo Room in Wicker Park (I like their décor better, as well) I would definitely like to return for the seasonal brioche French toast - the option I'd originally considered until being steered toward the Black Forrest.  Like the Griddle in LA, the Bongo Room is a MUST for all future visits to Chicago.",0.9986,0.818,0.158,0.024,0.5172671261487048

Everyone complains about the long waits, but on this particular Sunday at 12:30, there was only a 20 minute wait that allowed me to soak in the sun. One issue I have with the wait area is that at this moment, it is outside with no chairs or anywhere to sit, but I guess I shouldn't be so lazy huh...  The decor is nice and simple; many tables fit inside the small space, but I was still able to drown out side conversations and focus on the person I was there with.  First up, of course, were the beverages. I ordered the strawberry lemonade for $4.50, but there were no strawberry pieces to be seen and it was pretty tart. Nonetheless, with a little sugar added, it was up to par.  My friend ordered a make your own omelette with egg whites and a side of fruit. I don't like omelettes, but the fruit plate had a huge amount of fresh fruit that made both our mouths water. I am a big fan of pancakes and ordered the pancakes with toffee sauce and nestle crunch bits baked in. The sauce was delicioso...the pancakes themselves were okay, I enjoy fluffy pancakes and these were a little thin for my taste. However, they were still good enough for me to eat most of the dish even with my stomach about to burst. The Thai ginger sausage was a side order of mine and was tasty.  All in all, the prices were high for the beverages, but I feel priced right for the entrees and sides, and were comparable to other great brunch spots.

2009-05-04,3.0,"I love mornings. I especially love getting up right when the sun rises and it turns out to be a magnificent day. So after spending a lovely couple of hours at the Big Swap Bonanza at Soldier Field (which was OK but being outside in the weather was the big attraction for me) it was time to get the grub on and have massive amounts of coffee too. We were actually in a line waiting for this place to open, but once inside we were seated quickly and everything started operating very smoothly with the menus, coffee, etc. (BTW 5 stars for our waitress Peaches. What a doll!)  After reading the reviews, however, I get the distinct feeling that this place's forte is the sweet side of breakfast. All the raves that you see here go towards the french toasts & the pancakes, the savory dishes, not so much. And since I rarely have a Jones for sweet that early in the morning, I think I got a lesser experience here. I ordered an omelet, which has a great number of ingredients to choose from, I got roasted red pepper, chives and cheddar. But the eggs were very plain in flavour and the cheese was almost indistinguishable.  Shame too, since both mine and Andy's eggs benedict were absolutely gorgeous in their presentation. The roasted red potatoes with the rosemary were quite nice though as was the Intelligensia coffee.   Moral of the story, you like it sweet, go here.  if not, maybe hit up some other joint in the area.",0.9931,0.806,0.181,0.013,0.49274193548387096

I know the trendy thing to do is to call this brunch (since I am usually not eating until noon or later) but it's the breakfast foods I love so I always define it by the food I eat and not the time I eat it.  The Bongo Room is a great place to grab breakfast but be warned! Like every other good place in the city- there is going to be a wait! On a recent Sunday morning- the wait was about 45 minutes in a crowded area but even that didn't seem to bother anyone.  Once seated- the minimalist decorated room with windows along the Roosevelt and Wabash side allow you to people watch to your heart's content while you peruse the menu. It has a diner feel with a similar noise level so don't expect tranquility to go along with your eggs.  I had a craving for Eggs Benedict and I was not disappointed. Lots of sauce, perfectly prepared eggs and some tasty potatoes as a side made my morning. Add to that a cup of Intelligista coffee and I was content.  In looking at the menu- their take on french toast and pancakes sounded amazing- with flavored toppings and chocolate chips. Definitely a must for my next visit.  Parking in this area is metered and usually available but know that the new meters are there and you get 7 minutes for a quarter. Or there is also a garage at 1130 S.

It's definitely hidden on the corner of Roosevelt and Wabash, although I don't know how that's possible.  The inside is bright; lots of bright oranges and greens really wake up the place. It's fun to look out the window and watch the busy intersection and the people walking in and out of the Starbucks across the street. The waitress was pleasant, but quiet. She did however, keep our coffee mugs full.  The food at the bongo room is eccentric and fun. My friend had the peanut butter chip infused pancakes topped with creme fraiche, chocolate sauce and fresh bananas. YUM! The portion consisted of 3 GIGANTIC pancakes, probably 10 inches in diameter. You can get full off just this even if you have a big appetite. I had the breakfast burrito, which is not something I would usually order, but I'm glad I did. It was huge and scrumptious! There was no meat in it, just eggs. It is served with mild salsa and I'm not sure what sauce comes on top of it but it is delicious. It comes with breakfast potatoes, and is sure to fill you up.  What I do not like about the menu is that it is fairly small. There aren't a lot of items to choose from. I believe this is just my preference; I like a lot of choices. Also, parking can be hard to find. There is a sign on the front door that says that they validate for the parking lot across the street, and the cost after the validation will be $9.

2009-03-13,3.0,"If I had to describe Bongo Room with one word, it would be 'uneven'. Bongo room is a great spot for brunch with your gals. On weekdays that is. On weekends, not only there is a long wait, but also uneven service. It seemed like they only had two servers to take on all the customers the first time I went there. The place was packed. Second time, the service was wonderful. Our server was very upbeat and energetic which is always a plus in the morning. The decor is simple, bright, minimalistic, and chic. The prices are very reasonable for downtown brunch. Food on the other hand... again, uneven. We've gotten tasty food from here during the week, but during busy weekends they always seem to mess up our food. I tried the breakfast burrito stuffed with sweet potato and black beans. It was very tasty and filling. I was a little skeptical of the sweet potato at first but the combination really works. The potatoes that came with the burrito were grossly undercooked. With burnt spots. I did enjoy the touch of rosemary but when your potatoes are unintentionally semi-crunchy, what's the point? My friend got the regular breakfast burrito stuffed with scrambled eggs, guacamole, cheese and a side of Thai sausages. The sausages were dry but the burrito was solid. It's very savory and I don't think I can eat more than half a burrito but still delicious nevertheless.  They also serve an item called chocolate tower french toast. I'm not a big fan of sweet breakfast food so I didn't order it. However, the table next to us did, and it looked like a huge mountain of chocolate cake. Mmm.

I just couldn't get excited about the menu.  A huge chunk of it was devoted to dessert masquerading as breakfast.  I know that is some people's thing, but just the idea of that much sugar in the morning tends to nauseate me.  The egg dishes all seemed really uninspired -- especially in comparison to some of the sugar-laden treats.  I ended up getting a breakfast burrito and my boyfriend finally selected a boring-sounding eggs, bacon, and toast.

You cannot have meetings of any sort there.  I would not push having many guests with you, it is a 2-seeter joint.

If you want breakfast esp. on a Sat or a Sunday morning get here early as it fills up quick and sometimes the wait can be 30 minutes or more...and the waing area is small and in the city on a cold day you don't want to be waiting outside :)  I always order something different as I want to try it all :)  The servings are large so becareful especially if you don't want to waste food and don't like leftovers. :). I love thier pankcakes and seasonally they have something different. There are rich and filling and yummy...get a half order if it is given as an option.  It is great for people watching as well. It is not a typical greasy spoon it is a pretty modern breakfast place...in decor and as well as the people running the place.  It never feels sticky?? Does that make sense (for whatever reason everytime I go to other breakfast places it always feels sticky..weird I know) .  It is very light and bright with a lot of windows.  The only issue I have is that it is LOUD...I think it may be the acoustics in the space...all wood and brick...so if you want serenity and quiet this is probably not the place for you.

Undeterred, we put our names in and were quoted 35 minutes. We decided to take a walk around the block, which wound up being such a nice walk that it wound up being around 3 blocks, and when we walked back in the hostess was calling my name. I'm a big fan of perfect timing. Needless to say, the place was jammed, but our server was great- cheerful and kept the coffee cup full. Hang on... what's this? Space between the tables?? It simply didn't exist at the Wicker Park location! I had the pumpkin-carrot pancakes, which were really very good. Her breakfast burrito was great as well, and we had leftovers to take home.

It was however very bland! The bacon and cheese tasted nice but the onions were still crunchy which didn't go over well with me.( i prefer if my onions are kinda soft and brown it adds a lot more flavor that way). Also the eggs were not seasoned, and devoid of any butter, eggs need butter dang it! Also the potatoes were strangely undercooked and burned at the same time...sounds impossible but that is what I experienced. Also way too much rosemerry in them, which is kinda gross IMO.

2008-06-07,5.0,"This is one of my favorite places in the city. Even though I only indulge in this calorie-laden brunch orgy every 6 weeks or so, there are waiters and waitresses that always recognize me and stop to chat for a few moments or so. Also, my friends and I like to sleep in, so we are often scooting into the Bongo Room 20 minutes or so before closing. Even after the restaurant closes, the waiters allow us to sit in peace and finish our breakfasts! It is those personal touches that make all the difference in such a hectic yet scrumptious breakfast place as this.     I feel like Charlie in Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory when I enter the Bongo Room! I ordinarily wouldn't eat dessert for breakfast, but the Bongo Room's heavenly concoctions are too whimsical for me to resist. One tip that I have for those complaining about the high sugar content of said concoctions (as well as high prices) is that I have made it my rule never to order a full-order of whatever pancake feast I have been lusting over. Instead, I order a half-order, or even one pancake of whatever type, and the waiters and waitresses always accomodate! That way, you save a belly ache and an empty wallet. I often save even more money by splitting said half- or mini-order with my boyfriend or other friends at the table.     Another plus to the Bongo Room is its rotating summer and winter menus. Just as soon as you satiate yourself on a certain dish, it disappears, only to be replaced with something equally innovative and satisfying. Some of my favorites include the black bean and sweet potato breakfast burrito, the chocolate carrot cake pancakes, and the white-caramel pretzel-coated pancakes.     My only complaints are that the phenomenal chicken avocado sandwich is only available at lunch times during the week, the breakfast potatoes are a little under-seasoned, and there is often a long wait.     Enjoy!",0.9922,0.789,0.167,0.045,0.6083862433862435

I could eat these things everyday for the rest of my life and I would be happy.  Just to warn: There's a LOT of egg in this burrito. Some people say there's too much. I say - woo! I love eggs. I like their pancakes, but you have to be careful with them. They sound good on paper (ie S'Mores pancakes), but when you get them it's kind of a sugar overload that leaves you unable to finish your meal. Go for the more subtle pancake varieties, such as, exhibit A:  Last summer they had these saucy pancakes that were of the Lemon-Raspberry variety. The pancakes had lemon zest and raspberries cooked inside of them with a light whipped cream to go on top. It was DELICIOUS. And it didn't taste sickeningly sweet, either - that's what you have to be careful of in this place. Some of their food is just too sweet. The potatoes are undercooked and greasy. Skip. With Bongo, the food that is good is REALLY good (which isn't the majority of the menu) but the rest of the menu is kind of a turn off.

The wait was at least 20 minutes for 2, but it smelled so good that I didn't mind the wait!  Very small place and pretty crammed.  Their menu is not very extensive, but I'm always happy with a classic omelette so I tried an egg white omelette with veggies.  The price for an omelette is ridiculous...$9.25 ($9.50 for egg white) which includes only 2 ingredients, and each additional was $1.00!  $1.00 for a few diced onions??  I wouldn't have minded the price for a great omelette but this one disappointed - it was basically a layer of egg folded around bland veggies.  (Yolk has way better omelettes and a better selection!)  They messed up my toast order and I had to wait for that also.  We would have forgiven the food and prices if it wasn't for the waiter throwing the bill on our table while we were in the middle of eating - we felt like we were being rushed.  To top it all off, as we were finishing our meal, they rejoined a small open table to ours, and wiped it off with a dirty rag while we were still eating!  Couldn't they wait 5 more minutes?

2007-10-16,1.0,"Is it just me or are the good ole breakfast places pulling over to the side of the road to make way for the ultra modern contemporary ""brunch spots""?  Despite my ""refined"" palette, sometimes I just want some breakfast/brunch standards like corned beef hash or biscuits and sausage gravy or steak and eggs .  Brunch is supposed to be the bridge between breakfast and lunch.  Having said that you'd think you'd find a menu balanced with items that were soley breakfast, soley lunch, but then several items that really bridge that gap and satisfy the consumer who truly wants brunch.  If this is the type of menu you are expecting than Bongo room is not the brunch spot you are looking for.   Bongo Room has ONE dish that has meat in it, the croissant sandwich, and that's what I ordered.   Had I know that this was a $7.50 knock off of the Croisann'Which that can be found at Burger King, I might have actually went to Burger King.  Like Burger King the croissant was greasy and flimsy.  Like Burger King the 3 slices of bacon were as thin as Keira Knightly.  According to the menu accompanying my Croisann'Which where ""hashbrowns"".  However, what was delivered to me were the standard run of the mill red potatoes with a bit too much rosemary.  According to  dictionary.com  hash browns are:  crisp-fried potatoes made by dicing, chopping, or mashing boiled potatoes and browning them in hot fat or oil.  The potatoes where none of these things.  I really wish they would have accurately portrayed these potatoes on the menu so I knew what to expect.  Ok, so onto the rest of the menu.  There is a French toast offering and 4 different types of pancakes all which are covered in a healthy amount of cream.   If you really look at the menu they truly only have 4 unique items.  I guess I want more variety for breakfast. So aside from the menu, the ambiance is great.  I like the room and the overall design.  It feels like a bright fun airy light filled brunch/lunch spot.  It's always crowded which gives the room and lil electric.  Sadly , the design is all I really have to say that is positive.  The service really missed the mark.  We sat at 9 and the food didn't arrive to us until 9:45.  Futher complicating the situation, we had asked the waitress to further delay the delivery of our food so that one of us could move our car because of the bears parking enforcement which begins at 10.  Of course when I returned at 9:55 my cold Croisann'Which awaited me. I have been here several times and I think this time will be the last.  Maybe I would go back for lunch if I was really hungry and standing in front of it.  Otherwise I will steer clear of Bongo Room. 2 Croisann'Which 1 Cream Covered Pancakes 1 Can't Remember What John Had 1 side of sausage 2 coffees 1 orange juice ---------------------------- $55.00.

Decor is minimal and modern, the chairs a little uncomfortable, but it's brunch, not a five-course dinner, so who cares?  It was crowded, but it didn't feel like we were sitting too close to those around us.  It was little toasty/humid in there from all the peope, so hopefully next time we go it will be warm enough outside for them to turn some air on.  Overall it's an awesome place for breakfast/brunch/lunch out of the ordinary :)",0.9928,0.8,0.172,0.029,0.4901505901505901

Service is efficient - haven't had any problems there. Our server last weekend was super upbeat and deserved a huge tip just for being so nice.  I always have the omlette with spinach, tomatoes and smoked mozzarela - my recommendation would be to stick to the simpler items and let your friends order the more adventurous ones (like Cherries Jubilee French Toast: Carmaelized brioche with warm dark cherry compote and vanilla bean ice cream, topped with cinnamon-brandy creme anglaise) so that you can take a couple bites. Your eyes may be bigger than your stomach when you check out the menu, and you don't want to regret getting stuck with a giant plateful of oozing sugary stuff when all you really wanted was some good eggs&veggie.

Yet when a wildly successful business opens a new location, there's no excuses for skimping. While the space has good light, it's cavernous and incredibly noisy, more so than the other location. Despite being a large space, the tables are crammed within inches of each other, giving the feeling you're in a cafeteria, being forced to overhear strangers' conversation (and making it difficult to hear yourself over the din). The omelette was underwhelming, and service was patchy, considering it was after 2 and not that busy anymore.
