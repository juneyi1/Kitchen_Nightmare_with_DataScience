2017-09-01,5.0,I have lived in the city for 10 years now. I think its time to RAVE about this place. I eat here at least 3 times a month. It is just the best.

2017-08-27,5.0,I've been travelling around America this summer and trying out different breakfast spots but I have to say this place has been my favourite. The Bacon Benedict and Banana Pecan French Toast were just 10/10 but I would share the French Toast as the portions are quite big. The staff are so polite and was really nice seeing the staff smiling at eachother and not only the guests.

2017-07-20,3.0,"PMU is my favorite diner in the entire Chicagoland area. From the amazing food to the great decor and atmosphere, Pick Me Up is great. They offer a plethora of vegan options and cook them separate so whether you're eating for ethical reasons or dietary/allergen ones, you can guarantee your meal is gonna be good.  Just remember, you never go to PMU for the service. Their wait staff is doing their best but you will always have to wait a little while between sightings. It's not a bad thing, the service isn't BAD, it's just slower than one would generally expect. But know that you're in good hands regardless. And the food totally makes up for it!  My favorites are the Florentine Benedict (not vegan but omg goat cheese), and the vegan tostadas. As far as drinks, you can't go wrong with their mimosa, with or without the flavor of the week. Their beer selection isn't the most amazing but I can always find something I'm happy to drink. And their coffee is some of the best diner coffee around.

This place needs a huge bleach wipe all the fuck over it. Floors dirty, workers lazy, bad attitude and bad service. Oh and the smelly monkey Pube hair guy, blows off a couple that kept looking around for service but smelly decided it better to sit his stinky ass at another customers table and ruin any ounce of dinner they just had. Then he took his monkey hair ass to the bathroom while another worker opened the door to exclaim""OH MY"" and continued to hold the door opened too long. Don't bring your kids! Last time I will ever go in there as I was disgusted to no end! Also, smelly ass holds one of the cooks/cleaner hands and doesn't let it go while he's talking so loud while he finally gets to the couple desperately wanting a server. Its a bitch to want to be the center of attention and you smell like shit. The cook walked away trying to rub the stinch off his hand. Oh and the one mozzarella stick for $2.48 each, were served on a wilted piece of lettuce and you only get 4.

The rest of my group was awed at the menu choices since it was pretty vegan/vegetarian friendly. I got an eggs Benedict with country potatoes - $9.25. This was such a good value and the food was good. Now for the not so good experience wise. -There was already a 30 minute wait for our food. Then when it comes, everyone was served but me. The waitress explained that another waiter accidentally took my eggs benedict and that they're making one right now. It's always so awkward when everyone has food but 1 person.. it would have been a nice gesture to just bring me something small to nibble on instead of having me just sit and wait while everyone else has a plate. Really didn't like how they handled that.  -Waitress asked my friend if she wanted avocado with her scramble, friend said yes. There was an extra surcharge for $2.50 for the avocado. While my friend didn't say she was bothered by it, I sure as heck am. I hate when waitresses aren't up front about the cost, especially when it's higher than expected.

I ordered coffee which was brought out right away, and the very friendly server stopped by to keep it topped off throughout our time there. We also ordered food and milkshakes. The shakes came out after about 10 minutes, but it took over an HOUR for the rest of the meal to arrive at the table. It really was an hour, we checked our watches. That was frustrating, but perhaps they were short-staffed. Again, the server was very attentive regardless and continually stopped by to refill drinks. Despite the very long wait, the food was excellent. I ordered a vegan strawberry milkshake, and it was fantastic. Just a solid, classic milkshake with little bits of actual fruit throughout. My favorite! My meal was the vegan benedict: English muffins topped with tomatoes, greens, tofu, and a vegan hollendaise sauce, with potatoes on the side. The potatoes were heavily seasoned, but not unpleasantly so. I loved the creamy hollendaise sauce over the tofu and veggies. The portion was huge and I only could eat one English muffin half. Definitely enough for leftovers if you're into reheated breakfast food. My dining companions spoke well of their respective dishes, a chicken sandwich/fries and a breakfast plate (included eggs, bacon, toast, and two pancakes).

2016-09-18,4.0,"Hi. This review is for the one time my girlfriend and I visited Chicago. This was the first place we ate in the whole city and we were very pleased. First and foremost I understand that this place is well known for its vegetarian selection, but we are carnivores and still enjoyed the food selection.  We're from Orange County so we were impressed that a place such as Pick Me Up was open later than 10PM. Anyway I ordered a cesar chicken wrap which was of great quality. I won't go too in depth with how it tastes because its just an f'ing wrap but if you cant decide on what to get, you won't be disappointed. I got fries on the side, which is probably the only slight downside to my meal, but only slightly. They we skinny seasoned fries, which I like, so I had a certain expectation of hiw they are supposed to taste.BUT they were a little too over seasoned/salty. WTH? But I'm optimistic, we were there only once, an hour just before closing time, so I'm just going to just assume that the fries werent as great because they werent as fresh. I see the potential though. This place gets 4/5 because I havent tried it enough to give it a perfect score. The service was also great. I forget the waitresses name, but she was helpful with their extensive menu and was always checking up with us. As for the setting and ambiance. Its cool. There's colorful Christmas lights dangling from the ceiling and a bunch of other weird decor throughout. It was unique to say the least, and just overall cool. Anyway it made a good first impression of the kind of food you can find near Wrigleyfield and all over Chicago.  Thank you pick me up. Alright peace bruh.",0.9961,0.749,0.208,0.043,0.6003357753357751

Some of the booths and tables were on different levels so it wasn't just one flat floor. The entire restaurant was just very interesting to look at :) I got the veggie burger with fries and he got the buffalo chicken wrap with mashed potatoes. And we each got iced chai tea. The buffalo chicken wrap was good with big pieces of chicken. The mashed potatoes came with mushroom gravy. I recommend the gravy with the potatoes. I know some people don't like gravy, but trust me. Mushroom gravy with mashed potatoes is a big thumbs up. The veggie burger was alright. I personally wasn't a big fan of the bean sprouts but I wanted to try something new. Halfway through my burger, I put some of the gravy with the burger and let me tell you. I finished my burger in seconds. So overall, the gravy was my favorite! The one thing that bothered me was when we first arrived the girl handed us the menus, didn't say anything else and returned to her post behind the bar.

Largely because they serve food that is not just greasy hamburgers or cheap fake tacos (looking at you, Taco Bell). My friend and I ordered the nachos and the buffalo wings (both appetizers) as meals to split. And both were good. The nachos could've used a little more cheese on them but I defintiely appreciate the avocado slices - pretty sure they sliced up a whole avocado. Which was delicious.The buffalo wings were weird  - little stringy things. Like as thick as a normal french fry but they tasted like buffalo wings so I can't really complain. Especially since they didn't have a bone and weren't horribly messy to eat. In fact, I think I didn't even need any extra napkins - that's how unmessy the wings were.

2016-04-16,1.0,"I have been going to this restaurant for over 10 years; this is the last time. My girlfriend and I went here for my birthday. Per usual, it's a spot I frequent either after ball games, parties, or at times just leisurely strolls to just eat here. Upon arriving, we had a waiter named Robert (his name should be melvin because he's a doofus) take us to the table. We did not need any time, so I cannot give him feedback for that, as we were ready to order right away. We ordered, and waited, and waited, and waited some more. Typically, you are given water right off the bat to consume; we had to ask a waitress for some, since Robert was too busy messing up the order to bring us some. When the food arrived, my girlfriend and I began to eat. My girlfriend specifically asked for the chicken sandwich wrap to not have bacon on it. Well, it turns out her sandwich wrap did. We asked Robert to remake the sandwich, to which he reluctantly said, ""Uh.. ok.. umm.. hold on."" Seconds later, he walks back to the table with the wrap on the plate; the wrap was opened up, and with its exposed buttocks facing us, Robert said, ""well, it's made right... there was no bacon in there, it's burnt cheese."" No, Robert, it's not, it's bacon. He then left the plate on the table, with the wrap open in front of us. Oh, by the way, this jamoke had cheese and sauce on his hands from, get this, the exact wrap we ordered. So he fingered the daylights out of this sandwich himself to figure out if it had bacon in it. We called him back, again, and asked if he could remake it because we wanted a new sandwich wrap. Again, Robert said, ""uh... ok.. umm.. hold."" So he takes the plate back, and again, seconds later -- here's Robert saying, ""well, we can't make you a new one because it was made right the first time. I can discount it for you, I guess, but that's it."" ""No,"" we replied, we just want the check. So he leaves, we get the check, he takes the card and comes back with the receipts. I was so upset at this point that I asked where the manager was to which he replied, ""there is no manager on duty."" I then asked, ""Ok, what is your name?"" His reply, ""uh... my name [chuckling] why do you want to know my name?"" Because I want to take you out, you jamoke (I thought), ""Because I am going to report you to your manager, what's his/her name?"" I asked. He said it; I then asked what the phone number was, to which he had to testicles to walk to the menus, and grab one. He then placed it in front of me, pointed at the phone number on the sheet and said, ""it's here."" I have never had this type of service, ever, in my life. More importantly, I have never had an experience like this at the pick me up cafe. By the way, that was the last trip I will ever make here. The owner by the way, after speaking with the manager, still had the idea to charge us full price for the ""meal"" we apparently paid for. The reply to the credit card company was, ""we cannot help you in anyway, because you paid for the service you received."" Basically, you get what you pay for -- which is crappy service. Thanks; you lost a customer that has been eating there for years. Say hello to Robert (or melvin) for me.",-0.3584,0.916,0.043,0.041,0.3535943854125672

The fries have a great spicy seasoning and the beer was ice cold. Service was prompt and friendly. I would definitely eat here again.

Usually we are in and out within an hour, pretty average for a place like this. Today, however, it took us an HOUR before we even got our food... We saw tables come in after us, eat, and leave all before we received our food. When the server brought us our meals, I asked if there was a reason the food took an hour to come out.... The server responded with ""uh... Well I really have nothing to say."" Nothing to say? I get it that sometimes things happen, and food is slow sometimes. It's one thing if the kitchen was backed up, or he forgot to put in our order(which I think this was the case) but he didn't even ask us if there was anything he could do for us to make us happy... He only told us he has nothing to say? Very unacceptable.  It gets worse. When asking for our bill, he later drops it at the table, without saying anything. We notice that he did take off ten dollars, but it was extremely strange that he didn't say anything about it. No apology, no explanation.  Overall it was just terrible service and it will be awhile until we come to Pick Me Up again...

The staff has always been friendly, so I won't give them too much grief for being overly hipster. And the food is really delicious. I always get the chicken ranch wrap, which is another option that exceeds my expectations. It's bacony, ranchy, a bit oniony, and the flavors meld really well to make it more than ""just a wrap,"" in my opinion. I also love their homemade soups, it seems like they always have a different selection when I'm there. Though I can't quite remember which soups I've had, they've always been very savory, hearty and flavorful.  My friend had the Mac & Cheese once, and he was a little disappointed that it tasted a bit powdery, though. The only issue, in this area of course, is parking.

We've had everything happen here from orders being taken down wrong, getting hassled for special orders to suit dietary needs, servers conveniently disappearing for extended periods of time and leaving us to sit waiting to order - or waiting ridiculously long for our food, and getting shooed out of the restaurant within minutes of paying our bill. I'm also a bit more wary of this place than I used to be, since I've heard a few horror stories about carry-out orders gone awry and kitchen staff giving out food/drinks prepared with non-vegan ingredients (butter, milks, etc.) to vegan customers. If you're not vegan it's no big deal, but this could be dangerous for people who aren't just vegan for ethical reasons. If you're allergic to dairy and they don't bother to sub the ingredients because they think you'll never know, that could be potentially harmful to someone's health. Either way, there aren't many super-cool-quirky vegan diner/cafe joints in this area - at least none I've heard of that cause quite as much a stir as the PMUC. Whenever I'm in the neighborhood I'll continue to go here. Everyone I bring seems to like it here, too.",0.8881,0.865,0.088,0.046,0.5712154614932393

Maybe it's also because it's been late-ish - close to midnight? - and the chefs are running purely on lentil energy at that point. Who knows. The chorizo and eggs shindig was not only spicier than I had envisioned, it was also not popping with flavor to make up for it. The eggs Benedict was better, but the house potatoes were also mysteriously spicy - they just weren't a good time. That said, the pecan pie was good punctuation to the night, as it was the bomb dot com.

2014-09-05,2.0,"Clark and I stopped by to grab some sandwiches to take to the lake for a lakeshore dinner. We were riding bikes, and had never been to PMUC before, but I doubt we will order takeout from here again. The gentleman that took my order was as sweet as can be, helping me pick what to order, telling me what's good, making recommendations. I placed our order, and he told me it'd be about a 10 minute wait. It was already a longer wait than Clark and I would hope for, but since we were trying something new, I let it go.  I went back in to check on the order after 10 minutes - he let me know it'd be another 15 since the kitchen was so busy. He explained that it'd gotten busy right after I walked in and there was only one cook on staff, so things were a little backed up. This was disappointing to me, since we had been told 10  minutes originally. NOthing like waiting more than double the time for some sandwiches.  Food Review: We ended up waiting for about 35 minutes for our food to be ready. Since we had rented a Divvy, we nixed our plan to go to the lakeshore and just returned the bike. Should have just stuck with Potbelly. Clark's sandwich (the BHT Club) was HUGE. He didn't even finish it all, and he usually can put down sandwiches like that with no problem. I ordered the Garlicious Chicken as a recommendation from my host friend. It would have problably been awesome if the chicken wasnt so dry (to the point of being difficult to chew) and if there was more than just pesto mayo and goat cheese on it. Even a tomato would have helped. The pasta salad was really, really good though! I wish we wouldn't have waited 35 minutes and paid $20 for two mediocre sandwiches. I'll likely order something else next time - disappointing, because I can never get enough garlic, goat cheese, or pesto.",0.974,0.805,0.124,0.071,0.5872120216947802

Pick-me-up is a 24 hr diner and I recently went for a late night meal, but the food was meh. I ordered a buffalo chicken wrap and all it consisted of was buffalo chicken, in a wrap, with a few strands of lettuce...perhaps my bar is too high. I feel like lettuce is such a cop-out for restaurants to use, it's ultimately just green water and it has very little nutrients or flavor. Peppers, tomatoes, spinach...anything could of been added to the wrap to give it some life. But obviously lettuce is cheap, so lettuce is what we get. Since the buffalo chicken wrap was nothing more than smothered ranch dressing and hot sauce on a wrap I would have preferred it as a bite size appetizer rather than as an entree/wrap. Also the wait staff was frustratingly inattentive for a empty restaurant on a Thurs night and we waited much too long to get the check.

One recent experience is when I came in with a friend and the waiter looked at us multiple times and never came by our table for 25 minutes and we left. Today, the waiter was rude with our sub out of meat as we argued that it wasn't logical, meat is probably more expensive than cheese and you wanted to charge more for the sub? He seemed very frustrated and wanted to explain to us that it didn't work that way, then held back and gave us the free sub anyway. Even with the free cheese, the service was very poor and I think I am going to have to find a new breakfast place. We used to come here both Saturday and Sunday mornings, so it wil be a sad transition to no longer come here. Come on Pick me up! You can do better!

2013-10-06,5.0,"In the barren landscape of bros and hoes that is Wrigleyville one restaurant stands as an oasis of authenticity and good food. The Pick Me Up is a Chicago institution. It is a last refuge of the real in a city increasingly becoming a joke of itself.  30 years ago the Belmont and Clark area was a hive of punks and hippies, now there are merely pockets of that old city left: the Alley, Belmont Army Surplus, Strange Cargo, The Vic, the Metro, and of course The Pick Me Up. The bros and bar girls have a natural aversion to the PMU.  On any given night after the bars start closing, a few will come in, sit down and will immediately be overwhelmed by the colored lights, rustic decor, and and menu that has a good selection of vegetarian and vegan options.  ""Do you just have a big hamburger, brah?""  No brah, there's a bunch of tasty items on the menu, but this place has a strongly alt bent and red meat is not on the menu.  Try instead the Buffalo Chicken wrap or the Barbecue Seitan sandwich both of which will leave you craving it again the next day. There are those entitled others that think they should be getting something from Top Chef out of every $10 meal.  This is late night diner food, trixie, you are going to have the best damned chili cheese fries you've ever eaten, but if you're looking for a ceviche, maybe you should move along. The wait-staff are awesome. They have to deal with a dozen drunk assholes stumbling out of the social train wreck that is John Barleycorn every weekend, and they do so with grace and charm.  It's a well organized place so you rarely are waiting very long for anything. I wrote this partially because of some of the recent reviews in here that are written by some entitled brats.  I truly believe the PMU is one of the best places in Chicago, and I don't want to see it slandered by these absolutely stupid reviews.",0.9711,0.796,0.131,0.074,0.433639846743295

And then proceeded to say that there are hand washing stations we can't see . I said that is a sanitation violation. She snarled her lip and said I'm sorry you feel that way. Not to mention my friends food wasn't cooked all the way. And LIZZY ( the manager) said well I took care of her food. Meaning she took it back to the kitchen to be re heated in the microwave.  I said I didn't appreciate her attitude and she said, I'm sorry that's your observation. I asked for the owners name and she said , NO I will not give you the name, but feel free to call in the morning they are usually here then.  Needless to say I will NEVER go back to pick me up.

Then it took another 30 minutes for our food to arrive. Which would have been fine, except that none of it required cooking.   My boyfriend got the equivalent of a club sandwich, and I ordered a small house salad and the Mac Daddy, which was described as a sharp cheddar mac and cheese topped with vegan chili.  A more accurate description would have been bland, unsalted pasta with cheddar cheese thrown on top, then covered with vegan chili that was watery and tasteless, as if it had been thrown together in 5 minutes with no time to cook and develop any sort of flavor.  Apparently vegans don't have taste buds. The waiter never returned to check on our meal, so I couldn't order anything different. At that point, my boyfriend had finished eating, and I certainly wasn't willing to wait another 30 minutes for more bland food.  After we told the waiter that I couldn't eat the dish and asked for it to be taken off the check, he offered no apology, nor did a manager ever visit us. We were then made to wait for our check for 40 minutes, while tables around us complained about the unreasonable wait time.  The table next to us actually left after placing their order because it took too long for their food to arrive.

2013-09-10,4.0,"Late night food is traditionally unhealthy. When you think of places open late you have burrito houses, pizza joints and fast food. That's especially true in Lakeview. But what if you're a vegetarian or someone who's a bit more concerned with what they chow down on when they're out late on Clark Street, in Boys Town or anywhere in Lakeview? Pick Me Up Cafe is the solution. Pick Me Up is always open until at least 2 a.m. Rather than serve breakfast during the week, they just stay open later, and considering few restaurants serving diner-type food in the area do that, it makes Pick Me Up a very useful restaurant to have in the back of your mind, especially your drunken mind. That said, this is one of the few places you'll be happy to dine at whether drunk, hungover, or stone cold sober. It's a great spot for ""getting to know you"" dates, casual meetings/networking or full-on eating. It always comes to mind when I'm suggesting a place to meet in Lakeview. The menu is diverse. There's breakfast and lunch, plus a variety of appetizers that don't really fit any kind of theme. How many places offer both drunken chicken skewers and vegan nachos? Most everything you order will be good. Maybe not great, but good. I definitely don't come here when I'm looking to have a great meal, but I'm never unhappy to eat here.

Too much of the menu is vegan and not a lot of great alternatives. Service can really suck sometimes - the waitresses can be miss or really miss. Either way you're waiting a bit too long for your check when you were ready to leave ten minutes prior. Seems to be a haven for sad-hipster-galore.

The two people who ordered the scramble eggs started to complain of a weird taste after a few bites, which then I took a bite to confirm something was not right. The eggs looked good, but did not taste or smell right (my eggs where OK).

SO we ate our meal (no one had cleaned the table also so we barely had any room) and then we waited 15 min to get out check and the waitress didnt even run our cards we had to hunt someone else down to do that for us.

Three shots of espresso, two cups of coffee, steamed milk, and mountainous serving of whipped cream drizzled with chocolate and caramel sauce. *see picture* With the amount of caffeine in this drink, I was wondering if by the time i finished it my eyes would be red and bulgy like Judge Doom's from ""Who framed Roger Rabbit?""

2012-07-16,2.0,"After hunting all night for a good 24-hour place, my friend and I settled on the Pick Me Up Cafe, which seemed to be exactly what we were looking for.  As far as the food was concerned, I had a chicken salad sandwich (Very good!), and over seasoned fries that weren't very fresh. But overall, I was pretty satisfied. My friend had the chocolate milkshake, which he loved, and the Vegan Mac and Cheese, which I also tried, which was virtually inedible. Now, let's just assume that this is because it's Vegan, and it's an acquired taste.  I work at a very busy restaurant in Chicago, so I know when a place is packed or not, and what to expect from a server based on the volume of the restaurant. Pick Me Up was moderately busy, and it took an extremely long time to be seen by our server. Assuming it was part of the atmosphere and because we had tons of time, my friend and I didn't worry about it too much. After finally being seen by the server, we got our food, which came out in a reasonable amount of time, and everything was peachy. It took an obscene amount of time to get our check, but again, we weren't in a hurry and were having great conversation, so not a problem. When we finally received our check, we decided to split it ourselves, which is totally acceptable. I understand that many places don't accept split checks, but most, if you tell them how much to charge each card (which in this case was only 2), they are more than happy to do so. I know in my restaurant, we'll split checks right at the counter, no problem, and our servers also ask. Seriously. It's not that big of a hassle. Regardless, we were more than happy to oblige no matter what the circumstance was. Again, we waited FOREVER for our server to come back and get the check. When he finally arrived, he picked up the check tray, and I asked VERY POLITELY (again, because I WORK IN THIS INDUSTRY. I know how to treat servers) if he could charge the amount we had written on the back of the receipt to each card. He said NOTHING, and literally slammed the receipt tray back on our table, and turned around. This is literally the most rude thing anyone in the service industry period has ever done to me. I cannot see the reason why we were treated this way. It may have been one server having a bad day, but honestly, that's all it takes for me to NEVER return to a restaurant again.",0.9806,0.84,0.11,0.05,0.5784761904761905

2012-02-23,4.0,"I've got to be honest, reading through some of the reviews on here has me really confused, but maybe it's because I've worked as a waitress before.   Pick Me Up is definitely a place I will frequent this year, because the food was amazing, the atmosphere is pretty cozy, and the service was really good.  Granted, I don't expect someone to grab me a drink and ask what I want to order the second I sit down.  My feelings towards dining out are perhaps very different from most people's. If you're planning on coming here for anything more than just a chilled out dining experience with delicious foods, you might be a little let down.  I don't know, maybe it's just me but I really like when you have a moment to look around where you are, read the menu, talk to people if you're with them, and just generally not feel pressured while out.  The atmosphere is so nice here.  Now let's talk about the noms. Luckily I went with someone who'd been there before, because I was tempted to order one of everything on the menu.  The Vegan and Vegetarian options are plentiful, as are the non-veg ones.  I had the Garlicious Breast, as recommended by my friend, and I still can't stop thinking about how great it was.  With a side of Mashed Potatoes, no less!  I'd been craving mashed potatoes all week, and these really hit the spot.  I got them sans gravy, so I couldn't really tell you how that was. I want very much to go back for breakfasty foods, as breakfast is the best meal ever, and their options appeared to be exceptionally pleasing, even just reading them from the menu. The price of foods and drinks is decent.  A beer and a sandwich was just under 15.00, which to me is not so bad, and I'm really into not spending lots of money (I was going to say I'm cheap but...ok I'm pretty damn cheap). For an area that has way too many food/bar choices, I would strongly suggest choosing Pick Me Up.",0.9976,0.769,0.21,0.021,0.5635555555555556

Lucky for me, Pick Me Up Cafe was right there to rid me of my morning-after-drinking (.. let's be honest, afternoon,) syndrome - with something WAY less greasy and more delicious than my typical hangover dining picks.  Over the course of the meal, there were 3 main, notable things that made me fall in love: - Soy Eggnog Latte with a Shot of Jameson. This was the choice of my partner in dine. The thought of a hot, frothy egg nog drink kind of crept me out, but Oh My Gosh was this hot concoction mouth-watering. It was like a tummy-warming snickerdoodle and the perfect way to start out our dining day. Not to mention, the friendly waitress was more than happy to reheat the leftovers after it had cooled from too much chatting. And the 2nd round was still delish. - Tons of Vegan and Vegetable-filled plates. Me being a veggie lover and friend being a vegan, all of these delightful veggie options were amazing. So many to choose from: breakfast, lunch and dinner options. She went with a tofu scramble and I went with a veggie eggs benedict. Needless to say, we had no left overs... not because we didn't get enough food, but because we definitely wanted to eat it all.  - Friendly wait staff. So friendly I ended up paying a 40% tip. And I'm not exactly the richest lady on the street, we'll just say that. Other qualities that made me feel great: - Mimosa specials (and the daily drink flavor was peach. Um, yum.) - Late hours (Open 24 hours on the weekends too!) Let's just say this: The friendly staff combined with the unique food and drink menu definitely put the Pick Me Up Cafe on my list of restaurant venues to return to.",0.997,0.771,0.206,0.023,0.5848511904761905

I ordered the veggie chili and mr Chipples went for the vegan cheese Mac and cheese. Side order fries. Coffee and water for both, of course. We waited for quite a bit to be waited on initially and then waited again for meal order and waited a thurd time to receive our meal. During this wait 1 coffee refill and zero water fills and no straws. Fries were damn good, honestly eating them was a pleasurable as being at the Aquarium on a quiet Thursday afternoon watching the fish as they swim in their little glass world.  Perfectly crispy and well seasoned; we were even supplied with not one but two bottles of ketchup, neither of which had that much ketchup in it.  Our chili and mac arrived about twenty five to thirty minutes after the fries.  The chili was watery, but passable as food that could be consumed for energy.  The macaroni with vegan cheese was horrifying in every way and tasted like dish soap.  M Chipples has been a vegetarian and connoisseur of vegan delights for over a decade and is v. familiar with how delicious vegan cheeses can be.   This vegan cheese was terrible.  It was runny and sour and lukewarm.  The pasta was bowtie (wtf? what happened to the MAC) and overcooked by about 20 mins.  Soggy.  Eventually we sent it back and the waiter comped it for us on our check but did not seem that concerned about the fact that we didn't really like our food that much.",0.9405,0.847,0.109,0.044,0.5224999999999999

My boyfriend and I decided to indulge for breakfast on a Saturday morning, and I absolutely loved it! We both started off with black coffee, and the coffee was surprisingly delicious. It wasn't overly hot or watery, and it had a great flavor. Sadly, they didn't have it posted as to what type of coffee it was, and we neglected to ask. For breakfast, I decided on the Berry pancakes. They were five ginormous pancakes that two people could EASILY share, but it was worth it to indulge. The pancakes were very fluffy and had the slight griddle crunch to them that, in my eyes, makes the perfect pancake. To top it all off, the pancakes were lightly dusted with cinnamon which combined nicely with the syrup. I've never been to a place where the pancakes were lightly dusted, and I felt that it made these pancakes very unique and tasty. Surprisingly, my only complaint about the pancakes was the berries themselves--they were obviously canned or frozen, and they sat in a giant mush in the middle of the plate. I found myself eating around the berries, so I think next time I'll probably just go for the buttermilk pancakes and save a few bucks.

I always hate that I have to walk through Wrigleyville to get to you, but all could be forgiven if my meal tasted as delicious as I remembered it being. But my favorite buffalo tofu squares had this marinara like sauce (instead of a hot sauce??) and the blue cheese was runny and flavorless. Then I switched to the veggie chili over vegan mac n cheese and it smelled so much like feet that I could barely put it in my mouth. The warm chocolate soy milk was pretty expensive (almost choked when I saw the check) but it was the only good part of the whole meal. So disappointed.

2011-07-15,4.0,"On one particularly cold and snowy night, we ran many blocks up Clark Street to find a sweet little cafe that our friend Danielle recommended. Finally, we made it to Pick Me Up Cafe and hurried in out of the cold. When I first stepped in I got a feeling of instant warmth. Not just from being indoors; the whole place felt cozy and friendly. It was not crowded that night, but some tables were full with a great mix of people. Families with small children and college-aged kids. We were seated in a cute booth and ordered some drinks. I had hot apple cider that was crisp and sweet, and just delicious enough to make me forget about the weather outside. Gordon had a smoothie and Brynn had a delicious, rich mocha drink. They offer organic coffee and prepare beverages way better than most coffee shops. The menu at Pick Me Up is just as diverse as its patrons. There is a full breakfast section available all the time, classic American diner food, and entrees inspired by Mexican and Middle Eastern cuisine. We started with an appetizer of cheese fries that were golden and extremely indulgent. I tried the falafel wrap which was good and came with a side of vegetarian chili that was terrific. I could have just had a bowl of the chili to eat, it was that hearty. I felt that the falafel could have been seasoned more, but I can't complain otherwise. Gordon had a giant sandwich that was comprised of three different types of deli meats. This sandwich was nearly too tall for him to eat, but don't worry. He put up a brave fight and thoroughly decimated it. We had this meal before leaving for Christmas, and no one can remember what Brynn ate Seriously... everyone is blanking. We all got distracted because we exchanged gifts over dinner. At least that's my excuse. The staff of Pick Me Up is comprised of hip, tattooed folks who are friendly and don't mind putting up with customers who can't decide on what to get. They will also gladly make recommendations. And you can get food from them anytime as the cafe is open 24 hours. With most entrees under $10 each, you can afford to splurge on a fancy drink or appetizer. There are many vegetarian and vegan options as well as manly and meaty items that have been Gordon-approved.

It's cute, unique, and a great place to go if you have a mixed group of Vegetarians/Vegans and Carnivores. (We can all get along, ya know) First time around I went with my parents (Mom and I are currently Vegan, Dad is a carnivore) and we were all well pleased. Mom and I shared the Chocolate Coconut Vegan Milkshake (nothing says 10am like a milkshake...), Vegan French Toast (Best I've ever had, vegan or not. And HUGE. More than enough to share, and then some) and the Tofu Breakfast Scramble. In my opinion, the scramble could've had more flavor. I wish they'd marinated the tofu or even scrambled it, similar to Chicago Diner's tofu ""eggs"". My dad had ham and eggs and I heard no complaints.  Second time around: I cannot recommend the Skordalia enough. Oh Man. Absolutely crazy delicious. It's like a hummus platter- carrots, celery, tomatos, cucumbers, pita bread..only instead of hummus it's a Greek potato/garlic dip. I also had the breakfast burrito. Delicous. Everything is delicious and prices are beyond resonable.

Most of the people who complained about the food in their reviews ordered things that I'm not a huge fan of either, so I suppose it helps to know what's the best on their menu. The best thing to go here for? Breakfast! Any breakfast scrambles here are amazing! My favorites are the Vegan Tofu Scram and the Humboldt County. Also, I love their Sourdough French Toast. Their soups (especially the vegan chili) are usually pretty awesome. The Hummus Plate, the Jalapeno Poppers and the Buffalo Tofu are all great as well. They have updated the menu there a few times and some of the newer offerings there I am not too thrilled about, but luckily they haven't gotten rid of any of my old favorites like the Cuppy Burrito, Gnocchi, Gnocchi, Who's There, the Grilled Veggie Pita, and the Bumpen Grinder. Oh yes, and the Grilled Cheese with tomato on the 12-grain bread with a side of seasoned fries? AMAZING! The Vegan Tostadas are one new addition that I really like. I don't particularly care for the mushroom appetizer, or any of their pizzas or their pastas (besides the gnocchi with delicious tomato cream sauce), and their desserts can sometimes be hit-or-miss, but you can't go wrong with a mocha or four berry shake or one of their delicious brownies. I love coming here, ordering some coffee and something to eat, and relaxing or studying at one of their spacious booths.

That being said, a vegan friend was visiting and we headed over here to get our grub on.  Intrigued by the idea of jalapeno poppers that could be made with either cream cheese *or* creamy tofu, I opted for the latter. They were very interesting to me, and therefor I think a win. The breading was thick and soft, almost like corn-dog breading!  The peppers themselves were only mildly spicy (always a hit or miss) but juicy and good. And for my part, I really enjoyed the difference of them being stuffed with tofu as opposed to cheese. I would probably get these again for the sheer strangeness factor, to share them with my boyfriend, and b/c they were fun. It was halfway through this plate (they are huge!) I realized I over-ordered. I'd ordered the 'tofu' chalupas just to try them - what a mistake! and the soup of the day, which happened to be chicken. The soup was A-mazing!

2011-04-12,1.0,"Ladies and gentlemen, my experience at the Pick Me Up: ""Dear lord. Where to start? I came here on a date hoping to see what all the hype was about. I was pretty pleased with the atmosphere at least. It's funky, and I dig funkadelics. Anything bizarre or out there, I'm all for it! So, 1 star for the cool look! Now... onto the cons. Let me break it down for everybody. The staff here either does not care one way or another about getting your order right, or they have hearing problems. Severe hearing problems. My girlfriend and I walked in with our hearts set on getting her a grilled cheese sandwich. The guy asked her to repeat her order several times, so we enunciated every syllable for him slowly. ""Guh-rilled- Cheezzzz - sand-wich"". We got a goat cheese sandwich. I wanted to ask for the right order but she told me not to cause a ruckus. So she picked at her pitiful goat cheese sandwich and we agreed that it was okay. We just had an inside joke following our visit: (""You beat me in scrabble? Baaaaaahhh!!! Goat cheese sandwich."") Alright,  maybe you had to be there. Went back for a second shot. This one is why I'm writing the review. The same douche-baggy guy who gave us the goat cheese sandwich was at it again! He seemed confused when I asked to be put at a booth instead of a table, and when i asked what kind of deserts they had after we finished eating, he appeared even more confused and pointed us towards the pastry unit. We picked out what we wanted, came back to the table and waited to let him know. And waited. Waited some more. Looked around. where the hell was our waiter? 15 minutes later he remembered us and asked if we found anything. A little irritated, but keeping the smiles, I asked for the snickers cheesecake. It looked rockin. He half-heartedly scribbled it down, and left. Did i mention this guy is always dead pan? No smiles. Another 20 minutes went by. How fucking hard is it to take a piece of cheesecake out of a case, set it on a plate, drizzle some chocolate on it and put it on a table? I decided fuck it. My mood was already soured and, to me, the cheesecake had become the work of jaded hipster jerks. I got his attention and told him that the cheesecake was no longer necessary and I'd just like my bill. Here we go. Waiter: Ohhhhh they actually just maaade it... I'll go get it. Me: No thank you. I'd just like my bill. Waiter: I'll go get your cheesecake. He sets the cheesecake on my table quickly, as if i might leap up and grab him by the neck. Me: i don't want this anymore. This took forever to get here, i don't want it any more. I'd like my bill. Waiter:  I mean, they just made it. Me: I don't want it. I want my bill please. The waiter rolls his eyes, goes over to the guys behind the pastry counter, mutters something to them, and after a couple seconds sets my bill on the table. The $5 for the cheesecake stared me down. He leaves and goes to the register. I saw red. glanced over at him. He offered a weak, incompetent smile and I looked over at my girlfriend. Looked back at him. Looked at the dripping, uneaten and sorry cheesecake. Oh hell no. I brought the receipt up to the register and got his attention. Me: Please take this cheesecake off my bill. I told you I didn't want it even before it came to my table. I don't want the cheesecake. He gave me a snide little look and jutted his chin out at me. Waiter: No. You asked for it. I'[m not taking it off. Me: And I waited for forever for it to get to me and told you repeatedly that we no longer want it.  You brought it to us anyways, despite me saying no. I'm-not-paying for it. Needless to say, I didn't pay for it. And needless to say, I'm pretty angry. Angry enough that I made this yelp account specifically to review the pick-me-up. Don't waste your time on these guys.

I was BEYOND excited to see they had homemade vegan jalapeno poppers ($6.50 - not bad), but very disappointed  to find that they were stuffed with mashed tofu and not cream cheese. Using Tofutti cream cheese would likely be a little more expensive but would be SO worth it. Jalapeno poppers are supposed to be rich and fatty and if you're going to go to the trouble of stuffing and frying them, you might as well do it right. I also got the small vegan mac and cheese ($4.50 - not bad), and also wasn't super impressed. I'm a big fan of the Teese cheese texture so that was right on but the mac didn't really have much flavor so I ended up dumping on salt, pepper, and hot sauce. I would have liked it better if it had some garlic, nutritional yeast, or were baked in the oven with breadcrumbs (to give some ideas :)).

An absolute oasis of cool sitting on the border of Lakeview and Wrigleyville. It's a litmus strip of hip that you have to experience at least once before you die a miserable, lonely death. But enough of the cheery rhetoric. What makes Pick Me Up so good? Atmosphere. Imagine, if you will, a movie. And in this movie there's a scene where the protagonist and his cool friends go to a coffee house to hang out and expound inefficaciously about nothing at all, but look good doing it. This is where they go. Its dramatic but not overdone lighting, its recessed seating and the eclectic cast of workers make Pick Me Up the island of awesome that it is. So as far as the actual food and drink go, they have some well made, artistically decorated espresso drinks with all the frills you'd expect from baristas who take their craft seriously. At the same time I like their plain ol' drip coffee too and having worked in coffee for so long, I think I know good joe when it hits my lips.  Grub-wise I'm a huge fan of their hummus and skordalia. Both are great with pita bread and veggies and good to share with a couple few people for a snack. Their cheez fries too are really tasty with ranch. Their BBQ Chicken pizza is maybe a little too sweet but I can tolerate it. Who cares about all the rest, however, as their Kahlua pancakes knock my socks off.

Finally, two years later, I did and the inside is just as cute. After standing around for a little bit before the seater took notice of us (he is complaint #1) he rudely gestured into a room and said take that table. So we did.  Our waitresses friendliness made up for his brashness and she helped me pick out something good to eat (I can never decide!). Service was great. Food was good. The food was a little on the greasy side but that is what I come to expect from a late night place.

Service was never great but they got me my food and left me alone.  Fine by me. Then I made the mistake of bringing a group of friends here. I raved about it all the way there. (No, it is not unbelievably good food but it is solid, pretty cheap and I just really liked it here.) Well, shit. Of course everything was awful. Our waitress was the biggest jerk ever. She acted way too cool to wait on us dorks and was just plain RUDE.  Our food took forever and was all cold by the time it came out. I still could have forgiven this. But my sister's order was wrong. She ordered pancakes (I want to say the Kahlua) that I had had before and told her she would love. When they came out they clearly looked like PLAIN pancakes. I said maybe they just look different today? She tasted them, I tasted them, the whole gosh darn table tasted them. They were plain ass pancakes. So my sister timidly told our scary waitress she thinks these were just plain and not what she ordered. Did the waitress say ""sorry"" and bring out the right item? NO. She picked them up, looked at them, and said ""These aren't plain, they are the Kahlua pancakes"" with plenty of stink eye and threw the plate back down and left. All of us were stunned. She then never came back to our table and some random dude brought our check. We asked for a manager and were told there was not one in the building at the time.. Ummm. Alright.  Needless to say, this was two years ago and I am still steamed. It was just unforgivable service and attitude. It made me feel like crap. My boyfriend begs me to try it again for our beloved Clown Combo but I cannot. I know that weenie waitress might not work there anymore but it was such an awful experience I just can't go back.

Literally...they were ICE cold.

What I got was a restaurant experience from hell. My 3 friends and I stopped in and were seated rather quickly. We sat and pondered over our food choice while waiting for some service. After 20 minutes of sitting and not having anyone come by, our server comes up and takes our order. We just thought that they were busy and possibly shorthanded that night. As we sat and chattered, we realized that our stomachs were still grumbling. I looked down at my watch and realized that we had been sitting there for 40 minutes without any food or service since our server came by to take our order. At least they could have brought some water. Finally our food, if you could call it that, was brought out by a different server. I order a Grilled BBQ Chicken Pizza which I was completely turned off from after biting into a half cooked piece of chicken. I was even more upset that I was going to have to pay 9 buck for it. After finishing (sort of) the rest of our food we all sat for another 35 minutes, irritated by the terrible service and food. After the first 20 minutes of sitting with empty plates we contemplated leaving since it didn't seem like our original server (who hadn't come back to our table for over an hour and a half) was ever going to come back. Just as we were about to get up and leave, our original server swoops in and plops the check on the table. This is when things get downright offensive.

2010-02-23,4.0,"As a fresh college student at Columbia last year, my eyes were wide as the massive city of Chicago rolled over me like a wave of ocean water. One of the first suggestions made to me by a second-year student, was to hit up Pick Me Up (PMU) cafe. It was off of the Red Line (oh boy, the train!), and it had good, cheap food. For my first year of school, this is where my friends and had as a continuous backup. Over a year later, our pallet has expanded a bit, but PMU will always be comfort food. My buddy Felicia and I hit up PMU, steno pad in hand, to bring about a review. PMU is an interesting mix between Ragstock and a restaurant. Ragstock is a cheap thrift store that's a bit gritty with loud punk music. PMU does not sell clothing, but it is a bit gritty and is known to have loud punk music from time to time. They also have lots of vegan and vegetarian options. The decor is so wicked. Their tables all have themes- Sesame Street, Pez, Wonder Woman,etc. Ours was Star Wars. There is also a large bulletin board full of sketches and photos patrons have left. There are dozens of napkin-drawn pictures and photos of people chilling out. After all, it's a pretty fun place. We started things off with a soft drink and a hot tea. The tea came in a beautiful beer-drinking mug, and, according to felicia, was quite delicious. It took ages to order, as there are many options (such as a pizzadilla which is a mix between a pizza and a quesadilla). Eventually I decided on the Chicken Rub-Down and Felicia chose the Pasta of the Week. The Rub-Down is a chicken breast with lots of strong flavoring coating it, sliced and put over a bed of rice. As an entree it includes a side choice. The pasta of the week was marinara and spaghetti, including garlic bread and a side. ""The pasta was delicious and filling, although the marinara was a bit...runny,"" Felicia said. We enjoyed the laid-back environment of the restaurant as we chatted away, slowly bloating with food. As our plates cleaned up, we decided that dessert was required. Felicia ordered the blueberry pie, and I got a slice of vegan peanut butter chocolate pie a la mode. ""The blueberry pie was served in a large portion, which I loved. But it was a bit...solid, when poked,"" commented Felicia. We did spend a good 30 seconds poking it to see if it would jiggle. Overall, while not the best PMU experience I have had, it was a good time. ""The staff was friendly and prompt. It's definitely worth a return trip,"" said Felicia.",0.996,0.812,0.154,0.034,0.5612811791383221

I have eaten here a few times and I always love the vibe and the food, not sure why I am just now reviewing Pick Me Up....

The milkshake making man made himself - and the server - look so ungrateful and rude right in front of our eyes.  I'll have a hard time spending mine or my mom's hard earned cash here again.",-0.8668,0.791,0.089,0.12,0.631584249084249

The tofu ""cheese"" was decent, but needed more herbs and less salt. I also had a chocolate rice krispie bar ($4) which was too dense and heavy for my likes.

When we arrived the place was fairly empty, I noticed only 2-3 other tables seated and one was a girl intently studying.  I ordered the veggie burger with a side of fries and Michael got the gnocchi and soup on the side. They actually had two veggie soup options, a chili and tomato-based soup, which was nice. My veggie burger was decent, falling somewhere in the middle of dismal and mind-blowing. From its shape I'm guessing it came out of a box. The fries were really the high point of my meal, I love whatever type of seasoning they put on them. The gnocchi looked good, but in all honesty they strongly resembled packaged gnocchi I used buy from Eatzie's (sigh, I miss Eatzie's).  As I said before, service was slow and inattentive. Polite, but slow and inattentive. The place was virtually empty so I'm not exactly sure what our server was doing to occupy himself.

I have tried one of the sandwiches, which I wasn't too fond of, but it wasn't bad.  The Vegan Tofu Scram was okay (although, I much prefer Heartland Cafe's Tofu Scramble) and the Jalepeno Poppers were fine but I don't see myself getting them again, oh and the Vegan Chili Mac was really really good. Something about Pick Me Up's Chili is outstanding... A little spicy and a really good flavor, makes me crave it no matter what the weather outside. I also liked that they had vegan cookies, rice krispie treats, shakes and other snacks.  I haven't tried any of them yet, and if I could stop eating the Chili Cheez Fries, I may have more room to try everything else :) Okay, other points that I love about this place:        They serve meat also.  This is especially handy as many of my friends/family are not vegan/vegetarian, and so it is super convenient that we can all be served sufficiently at one place.      They are open 24 hours on the weekends.  This was extremely useful for me after a night of dancing with a girlfriend a couple weeks ago.      They are easy to get to from the Addison Red Line stop.  Close enough for me to go, but far enough away that I'm quite sure my hips are appreciative that it is a treat to go there for the Vegan Chili Cheez Fries.

2009-06-17,4.0,"Pick Me Up Cafe is an anomaly in many respects. It's on the edge of the sports bar stretch of Wrigleyville, but is decidedly un-jock-ish. It's also a late-night/all night (on the weekend) diner, but the food is of surprising quality, unlike the common greasy spoon fare you might find at Clarke's or Hollywood Grill. Finally, the atmosphere seems to recall a college town/indie/punk aesthetic, something the old Clark and Belmont once delivered, before the arrival of a Starbucks, Jimmy Johns, and Potbelly's. Your PMU experience will vary, most notably depending on when you arrive. A weeknight visit may be a low-key affair, whereas dropping in at 5:30 on a Sunday morning after a long night of bar-hopping ensures that you're in for some of the most lively people watching in the city. In fact, after the bars close is when the restaurant finds itself the most slammed. It's the best quality option, when every other worthwhile restaurant on the north side has closed for the evening. Regulars frequent PMU for a number of reasons. Some, for it's socially inviting atmosphere and large tables, which can accommodate a healthy late-night grouping. Others, for the full plates of solid french toast, or the overwhelmingly massive cuppy burrito plate. Personally, I'm addicted to the peanut butter/chocolate/banana milkshakes. The fact that they have Pet Sounds on the juke box, a full album play for only five dollars, certainly doesn't hurt. PMU isn't the cheapest option around. If you're looking to spend a bit less while sobering up after last call, you'd do better to hit any number of neighborhood burrito joints on Halsted, or perhaps Clarke's right off the Belmont L. But for those willing to part with a few more dollars in exchange for an experience and a full plate, Pick Me Up, especially on those marathon weekends, is easily your best bet.",0.9935,0.836,0.153,0.011,0.4669486215538847

No, not nookie, that was far from incredible.  No, some of the best potato stuffed shells in Chicago.   Anyhow, back then, the Pick Me Up wasn't renown for being a vegetarian-friendly establishment like it is now (it's sort of cool that they don't specify on the menu what meat they can add to some things, they just call it ""meat"") and the food was a little less dinery in quality (less grease to be sure).

Our group was split between eating slices of apple pie or cherry pie (they also offered pecan pie, vegan desserts and a lot of other food). Both pies were super sweet, and for some reason the cherry pie left my mouth feeling pretty dry. But it was okay, since I balanced my slice with some vanilla ice cream. The slices were also large (~1/6th of a whole pie). Two of my friends also ordered coffee drinks that were served in nice tall float glasses and topped artfully with whipped cream.

I guess it was the name of the Pick Me Up Cafe that inspired me to dust off and drag Superchunk's ""Come Pick Me Up"" CD out of the Archives for my drive to ""Veggie Night 2: Tofu Boogaloo""! It's a hit or miss album, with some highs, some lows, but lots of middling middles. I would give the album a solid three stars, just as I do the Pick Me Up Cafe. I had a great time at the UYE Veggie Event planned by Becky W. and Michael G.! Parking around Pick Me Up Cafe is scarce, so bring a few quarters and plan to circle like a vulture looking for a spot if you're driving there. I liked the casual environment, the good tunes, the casual but attentive service. This could be your favorite hippie-run cafe in Anytown, Big Ten country. It's big on keeping the vegetarians happy and well-fed; and had a good mix of breakfast and dinner items. They specialize in breakfast for dinner: Brinner! They didn't have the Veggie Breakfast Burrito with Tofu, so I went with the Huevos Rancheros. Almost served omelette style, the huevos were fluffy and filled with veggies and sides of sour cream and salsa. The salsa was tangy but mild on the spicy meter. It was an excellent choice! As Michael G. seemed to be on a mission to carb up for a Marathon the next day, he let me try his mashed potatoes and gnocchi (rhymes with pokey! like me- poke poke). The gnocchi was in a mild creamy marinara sauce and was excellent! I'll definitely heed the recommendations of diners in-the-know next time! Yes, I'll be back to Pick Me Up Cafe again.

I ordered a side salad and the buffalo tofu strips.  They were out of sprouts but the salad was lovely. What made it lovely was the balsamic vinaigrette dressing. For some reason I couldn't get enough of it. The buffalo tofu bits were ok. They would have been much better with something to dip them in I think. The portion was large. They were out of veggie burgers so my husband had the pizzadilla with the whipped tofu on it. Very strange idea with the whipped tofu and in my opinion it didn't work out very well.

I was a loyal fan of the Pick Me Up for a few years until they started to gradually raise the prices out of my college kid budget.  Since I wasn't living off of my parent's dime at the time, I had to stop going there. After college, I started going there again, but we had to break up, because the quality of food in relation to the price took a bit of a nose dive.   I was convinced a few years later to give the place another chance and as luck would have it, there were a lot of improvements.  Better fries, the old French toast was back and now they have a liquor license.  Most of the wait staff is really good, but occasionally, you'll get a pretty horrible waiter/waitress .  Fortunately, the really bad wait staff doesn't last long.    Next time you go, order a four berry shake with chocolate ice cream.  It's excellent.",0.9732,0.765,0.16,0.076,0.4236666666666667

He was kind enough to give me the name, but then he hung up on me. I guess he didn't like that. I won't hold it against him, though. I will check out his place sometime. In short, I came to lunch at Pick Me Up to try their famous garlic chicken sandwich. I had read an article about it somewhere. The sandwich was good, although the chicken breast was a little tough. I usually avoid most chicken breast sandwich choices for this reason, but the garlicky goodness and pesto-y lusciousness made me forget about the leathery one-half of the sandwich. The server was helpful and friendly. I love the ""nouveau haphazard"" style of the place. Kind of an indie haven, I guess, but I still felt welcome there. I would definitely go back to try some other things. Even if it IS vegan. Vegan is fine. Vegan-gelical is not!  And after all, they did serve me a flesh sandwich.

To me, Pick Me Up provides some of the best coffee drinks in Chicago.  It's been a fixture on Clark for as long as I can remember, and regardless of what anyone wears or is into, you can find yummy eats and FANTASTIC coffee.  I'm just glad the corporate moguls haven't ousted this local gem.  This is a place for veggies and meat-eaters alike, but all is pretty tasty. As a fun bonus, your coffee drinks may display various artistic swirls, leaves or even a cat head drawn into the foam with chocolate or dusted with cinnamon.  But cute art frills aside, please take a sip.   Dang good joe.   And for someone with a bit of a lactose issue (yuck!), I struggle with having to order soy.  In fact, I usually hate soy in my coffee because of grittiness and it just doesn't taste the same.  So I sometimes bite the bullet and order milk (lactose issues be damned!).  But I have to say, soy in my coffee drinks at Pick Me Up are PURR-fect.  Wow.  Never thought it could be so good. So, if you don't care about who may be sitting at the table next to you and you want a REALLY good cup of coffee, or a specialized coffee drink at a veteran local shop, try Pick Me Up.  Take it to go if you have to.  Just don't pass it up for a bitter, cookie-cutter, corner-hugger.  Believe me, you won't be sorry.",0.9937,0.755,0.207,0.038,0.5380434782608695

The best part, though, is the menu!  There is really something for everyone.  The vegan options are plentiful and pretty darn good.  The vegan mac-and-cheese thrills even my milk-loving friends.  The pancakes and the vegan milkshakes are to die for.  My only criticism is the lack of vegan desserts to choose from - while the peanut butter rice krispie treats are good, they seem to be the only option more often than not. Vegans and vegetarians beware: a server mentioned that the french fries are made in the same oil as meaty dishes.  Make sure to ask about veg specifics when there.

Service - - Eh, it really depends on when you go.  Obviously late-nights and prime brunch-hours the place is going to be packed and service is likely to be hurried or harried and you'll likely wait a long time to get your food - there are times when getting a coffee refill is seemingly impossible - and the attitude of the servers seems to sometimes depend on whether they got any sleep the night before, or whether they're still ""on"" from the party they went to last night - - for sure this is a hipster's joint.  I'm getting to be an old fuddy-duddy, but I'm still willing to put up with some apathy for a good breakfast and coffee that'll put hair on your chest :)",0.9563,0.879,0.104,0.018,0.6343434343434343

When I ordered the breakfast burrito with tofu (on available during brunch hours), my breakfast pal and the waiter looked at me sideways. I quickly changed to bacon, and I'm glad I did. Eggs and tofu in a burrito? That would be boring. Nice save, guys. I really appreciated the host looking out for me by giving me the option of sitting in a booth in either room. She allowed me the choice of sitting near dorky college-aged kids or a loud family with children.  The food was pretty good. Without the sour cream and salsa, my burrito would have been horribly bland. But it's nice to have the option of flavoring your own food to taste. The avocado on the burrito was generous and fresh.
