I am a southsider so I know of dozens of places to get some good fried shrimp, but the reviews were okay enough for me to try. Well..I ended up trying the grilled shrimp wrap. Flavor is pretty good and has a hint of spice to it thanks to the andoulle sausages in the wrap (I didn't get the hot sauce). Wish I didn't have to spend $7 but I guess that's standard these days.

2017-06-23,3.0,"Just another shrimp house here in the city and nothing sets them apart from the others. They're more expensive than the others, and you seem to get they same amount of food as other shops. I like the location, as it is a skip from the brown line Irving Park stop. I also like that they do have some seats. Whereas in other shrimp houses in the city you have to order and eat in your car. As for the food, I got 2 pounds of shrimp. I know a lot of people say there's a lot of bread; however, I find when I eat mine while still hot it doesn't seem like a lot. Now, if I wait for them to cool, that's when the breading seems to be thicker, and I find myself pulling it off.  While I liked my order, there is no incentive for me to go here unless I'm in the neighborhood. Everything is about $2.50 higher than at other places. The taste is no different from Lawrence's, the shrimp house, or Goose Island. So will I wouldn't mind paying the price I am not getting anything for it. Except being closer to a doctor telling me I can never eat fried foods again. Try if you're in the area and want seafood.

I showed him with the fork how it was lodged under the skin and fried in, and not something that may have fallen on top. Obviously my appetite was shot contemporaneously.

2016-01-31,5.0,"2016 is the year of the shrimp...this is the year we are going to be fried shrimp silly, trying out different fried shrimp eateries in Chicago. So we start with Snappy's. I say this to open: ""Lawd Ham Mercy"". The pros: 1) ABSOLUTELY GREAT FRIED SHRIMP----ordered two pounds, and it was great yes they were!! I commend whomever is in back fryin their butt off. 2) NO WAIT TIME----I ordered my shrimp 90 minutes ahead of time on a Saturday night, picked it up about 930ish..my food was bagged up, on the counter with my name on it. Just paid, chit chatted for a few minutes then headed out.  There was absolutely no one in there & that's a bonus for me. 3) WARMED UP GREAT---Naturally it was cold when I got thru running errands and got back home. Threw those jokers in the microwave for a few and they came out wonderful. Not tough or extremely chewy. 4) JUST ENOUGH BREADING---not heavily breaded. I commend them on how they do it. There's nothing worse than trying to eat shrimp when you got 20% shrimp and 80% breading. Ok maybe the ratio is somewhat stretched but still, it's a disappointment when there's no meat. It's like opening a taco & all you see is lettuce & one small piece of meat. 5) FRONT COUNTER STAFF---extra friendly. She talked to me for a minute or so while making change. She hipped me on what to try next time I call in an order. 6) PARKING---now I know we all can park in the back lot while waiting for our food. I was in a hurry and double parked at the corner. She said there was a back lot (not that I saw it) but I figure next time I'll look for it. 7) CLEAN FACILITY---oh my how that place is clean!!! I friggin adore the lights in there too. Gives it a certain warm glow if you should decide to eat there. But I prefer to eat these golden trinkets at home. The cons: 1) BLAND HONEY BUTTER---I was given butter but it wasn't honeyish. In fact it had no flavor to me. I even took a hawaiian roll and smear some on it, still didn't taste anything like what everyone else was talking about. Did I get a bad batch or was it plain ol' butter?? 2) The sweet sauce---I was given three of those. It didn't taste sweet at all. Rather it tasted like really bland bbq sauce with a hint of smokiness. I used a bottle of honey bbq sauce & that did the job. Where be the ingredient for the sweet taste?? 3) THEY DON'T DELIVER---something I better get used to. I'm finding no shrimp joint like this delivers...unless someone else knows something I don't, pleeze share (0: But at the end of the day, I can't give 'em anythang BUT 5 stars!! Well deserved.

2015-06-14,1.0,"I've tried this place four times now. I really wanted to like this place. Good fried shrimp, fish, scallops, etc., are not that easy to find. I am from Louisiana and I know my gulf shrimp. I'm not convinced these shrimp come from the gulf coast. They seem to come out of a bag from the freezer. And who knows where they came from before that. The scallops on the last visit were gummy and suspicious smelling. The fish tasted reminiscent of supermarket fish that come from Southeast Asia, where it likely sat in shit-water before being processed and shipped to the US.  There is no place to sit usually, especially at 12 noon or 1pm. One table with three high chairs, and a few stools along a counter by the window. I like hot fried food HOT, and if you have to carry out, it loses something on the trip home (which for me is six miles). Tartar sauce can spoil enroute home and I don't enjoy dying from food poisoning. Fries, slaw and canned drink choices are unremarkable. The hush balls are good but why serve cups of honey butter that are frozen hard as rocks??? Hard to spread that on a hush ball. I even snapped a plastic knife trying to accomplish that feat.  But the biggest thing I have to comment on is the service. The guys behind the counter - who also do the cooking - are not the brightest bulbs in the chandelier. I've had orders messed up a couple of times. When you order, they barely let you take a breath before they cut you off and ask ""what kind of sauce you want with that?"" Let me finish the order, the main items, please, before we get to the condiments, etc. And I guess it doesn't matter, because they invariably forget something. Once a worker decided he would finish up some texting while I stood waiting to order. That was after he asked if I was ready to order and I had replied that I was ready. The man who I believe owns this place is rude. He seemed condescending toward customers. Two workers were having a conversation and using vulgar language including multiple F-bombs. Not appropriate! Cooks who double as cashiers did not wash their hands.  And lastly, get this ... if you want to visit the restroom you have to walk through the kitchen. I saw pans of fish and shrimp sitting out in water and some other food items sitting open. Nobody was back there. The area was completely unoccupied and unsupervised. Someone could put something on/in the food, piss in the fish water, wipe a booger on a shrimp .... just saying .... And it's for that reason above all others that this place gets one star.

2014-10-22,4.0,"Snappy's Shrimp House is divine. They ship shrimp over from the Gulf, which are plump and juicy and don't have those gnarly brown poop lines running down their backs, like sketchy shrimp you get at other places. The place looks a little rough when you walk by it and into it, but that's because they spend all their time and energy on ascertaining that their ingredients are fresh, rather than trying to come off as garish. Besides, presentation is so overrated.  Anyway, Snappy's seriously serves the best fried shrimp I've ever had. I met some guy from Louisiana a month or so ago, who flies to Chicago several times a year specifically to go to Snappy's. That's like 400$ for some fried shrimp, and he lives near the Gulf. Whether or not he has more money than he knows what to do with is debatable, but Snappy's is obviously doing everything so right if he keeps coming back. If you love shrimp and eat at Snappy's and don't love it, you probably need an attitude adjustment. I don't know if they serve coffee or not, but if they don't, there's a Starbucks down the road, and I'd be happy to buy you a scalding-hot espresso, splash it in your face, and slap you until you understand how great Snappy's is.

The breading was much better than that corn mealy crap that's fried up in other seafood casual spots in this city. *shudder* The seafood was nice and plump and I liked their dipping sauces- a nice change from the usual old cocktail sauce. The crab cake was thick and crabby; it was good despite being breaded (meh to that). The one thing I'd pass on are the onion rings.. a lot of batter and too little onion present but it was satisfying for when you just don't give a fuck about the fat and empty calories you're consuming in all of that deep fried batter.

We used to live right around it, and now that we're away, we miss it terribly and stopped by a few weeks ago to get a fix. So, the thing is, I always overdo it here. But I can't help it! Everything is so good. We usually split a half pound of the shrimp, fried to a crunchy but tender crispness and dunked in their cocktail sauce. The best part is that the shrimp are tail-less, so you can eat the whole thing. The fries are crinkle cut and my favorite kind, but the standout side is the hush puppies, slathered with their housemade honey butter. They also offer healthier stuff, like wraps and shrimp cocktail, which I do sometimes. You can eat at a counter or a few small tables, but I have found that the food does hold up OK to go, too.

The consistency of the meat is everything you want from a fried shrimp: firm but not hard but, also, not squishy from being over-greased. These are just right. Each shrimp requires 3 or 4 bites to eat. These things are big! Perhaps BP has mutated these beasts past the point of recognition. I don't know for sure.

2009-09-24,3.0,"Snappy's is a great place to get some fried seafood in Northcenter. The first plus, obviously, is that they sell food by the pound. That's just a big fat plus in my book. But, for this trip, and to preserve some modesty, I ordered their Crabcake Sandwich (which a friend recommended), and some fried calamari, with a (small) side of cole slaw. Within a few minutes, I had my delights with some lemon wedges and cocktail sauce on the side.  The dining area was tiny, but it looks like no one eats in so often, because it was empty the whole time I was there. So, I sat and ate, while the owner(s) watched ""Dancing with the stars"". I'll go ahead and say it now... that was not a plus for the ambiance. What can I say; I'm picky. Everything was delicious. A few of the calamari were a bit soft (the coating wasn't cooked completely crispy), but the crabcake sandwich was undoubtedly delicious. I was done a bit sooner than I hoped, but happy with the meal. I'll definitely be back there for a few pounds of shrimp at some point. Or, their other delights (check out the images; one of them includes the menu!) It's not the best seafood in the world, but it is certainly worth the price, and the folks are friendly (I was invited to sing along to something on the TV).",0.9903,0.779,0.185,0.037,0.41944444444444445

The choices range from chicken wraps, to sandwiches, to seafood by the quarter-pound (sea scallops, fried Gulf Shrimp, shrimp cocktail, and yes, even chicken wings). We weren't super hungry, so we decided to split a wrap. After looking over their selection of four wraps (including a Shrimp, Grilled Chicken, Jerk Chicken, and BBQ Chicken Wrap) we settled upon the Jerk Chicken with a side of hush puppies that is served with honey butter.  The jerk chicken had just a slight heat to it which was contrasted by the lightly sweet taste of the pineapple. The lettuce and to tomato served to squelch the heat instantaneously while the rice was not overwhelming, and did not seem to serve as a filler as much as it was there to add to the taste and textures of the wrap. As for the hush puppies, they were freshly fried right in front of us, and served to us piping hot. The crunchy outer crust segued nicely into the cooked inner portion that had been thoroughly warmed. The heat of the freshly cooked hush puppies served to melt the honey butter ever so slightly. If we ever find ourselves in that part of town again, we will be sure to stop by.

Anyway, I threw up my hands (gaily) and went inside.  It was surprisingly clean in the shrimp shack.  The patrons were what you would expect for a corner eatery.  An old man perched atop a stool by the window bar, two overweight working class blokes waiting for a to-go order, and an aging cop at the one table dipping his fries into what looked like the Most Amazing Tartar Sauce on Earth. I got the fried shrimp wrap, because I figured that had to be good, if they are all about their shrimp and all.  It came with some kind of barbecue-like sauce on the side (I got the spicy), which added a nice kick, but it didn't melt my tongue off.  The shrimp were perfect and crunchy, piping hot.  It wasn't the perfect wrap, but it definitely hit the spot.

I drive over there and pull up to the place.  To be honest, it kind of looks like a dump...I expected that and have found most Chicago hidden treasures do look like dumps.  Walk into the place and am greeted with a friendly smile.  The place still looks like a dump...but look behind the counter!  The food prep area is spotless.  Even the fryers are without a smudge.   After looking behind the counter, you'll realize that the vast majority of food they have is fried.  Nice and greasy.  The menu confirms that...though they do have some sandwiches and shrimp cocktails.   I order the 1/2# shrimp, calamari, and fries.  The guy behind the counter seemed to be the owner.  He was quite friendly, especially after I told him it was my first visit.   Plan to take your food home, though there is some counter space on the perimeter of the place to eat there.   Food: Everything is made to order, even the fries. The calamari was all right...they were small and most of the taste came from the breading...but they were #2.50.  A great deal, don't get me wrong, but I probably won't get them again.   The fries were good...no different from what you find anywhere else.   But the shrimp...oh the shrimp.  AMAZING!!!!  They were perfectly breaded to get that fried food greasy goodness, while still fully displaying the gread, wild flavor of those huge shrimp underneath.  And to top it off, the shrimp don't even have the tail on them..you could pop them in your mouth whole if you want...though I don't know why you'd want to when you can savor bite after bite of these awesome shrimp.   I'll be back...but not without scheduling some appointments with my doctor...this is a heart attack on wheels!!!  But oh how I love it!

2007-04-04,4.0,"I was really suprised by this place.  I was definitely not expecting it to be so clean and new inside.  I ordered the fried shrimp wrap.  Not what I expected.  It came wrapped up with lettuce and rice.  I liked the addition of rice.  I wasn't in love with the mild sauce I ordered, a little too tomato based for my liking.  Of course I don't like cocktail sauce either.  But I noticed from the menu and the other reviews they have other sauces and I would like to go back and try those instead.  I didn't have enough cash on me to try the hushpuppies so now i definitely have to go back.  Oh yeah, they had a sticker on their drink cooler from Yelp.  I wonder how they got that???",0.8606,0.814,0.129,0.057,0.42696969696969694
2007-03-13,3.0,"I want to like this place.  The shrimp and hush puppies are great, but everything else is just about average.  Owner is very friendly and the staff is quality as well.  I would like to go here more often, but the little voice in back of my head says to skip it.  Only when I'm in the mood for shrimp will I go there.  If you love shrimp, then this is your place.  I feel bad giving it three stars, but I'm just being honest.",0.9741,0.675,0.28,0.045,0.5966666666666667

However i know now not to get the fish sandwich (kinda like a Mrs. Paul's frozen fish fillet between bread) but, to instead get the shrimp. The Hush-puppies were awesome! I totally recommend this place.",0.9078,0.798,0.202,0.0,0.75
2007-03-03,5.0,"Boiled shrimp, fried shrimp, shrimp cocktails just to name a few.  This place was awesome.  Really clean and modern on the inside, even though it kind of looks dumpy on the outside.  The shrimp wrap was really good, kind of like a po' boy sandwich.  I guess they only use Gulf Shrimp, not farm raised, so maybe that's why it tasted so yummy.  They are ranked #2 for shrimp by Time Out Chicago Magazine and I can see why.  It's probably better to take out or order out, since there is really only counter services.",0.9294,0.759,0.183,0.058,0.6409090909090909
2006-09-28,5.0,Major tips: Carry-out. CASH ONLY. There is an ATM seconds away on Wolcott & Irving Park near the bowling alley. The food is so good! Great advice from another reviewing about calling in your order first. This was my second visit to Snappy's and I called first. Food was hot and very good! Great prices and tax is already included. I was full and saved the rest for later. The leftovers still tasted great and fresh the next night (even the jumbo shrimp)!!!

2006-09-28,3.0,"When it comes to fried fish, I tend to favor catfish, and what I've had at Snappy's is acceptable, but not great.  They seem to go a bit heavy on the breading, which can overwhelm the taste of the catfish itself.  Also, their ""hot"" sauce was surprisingly uninspiring, tasted more like mildly spiced ketchup. On a positive note, the prices for all their offerings seem to be pretty reasonable.  Perhaps I should try the shrimp on my next visit.",0.9135,0.723,0.207,0.07,0.5745454545454545

2006-05-29,4.0,"Very tasty food -- I usually don't go after seafood in the midwest, since it's usually not very fresh unless it's flown in, in which case you pay a premium.   I usually call ahead or drop in only if I have time -- it takes a while for them to weigh the food, drop it into the fryer, etc.  This is NOT fast food.  I went in once and there was one customer ahead of me and it took 20 minutes or so to get out of there. If you have the time, definitely worth the wait!",-0.355,0.87,0.047,0.083,0.45000000000000007
