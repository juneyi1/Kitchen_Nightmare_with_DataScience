2017-08-19,3.0,"I had the salmon porto, it comes with a side platter of pasta which did not go together at all. The salmon was really tart and sticky sweet as one would expect of a dish with balsamic. The salmons plate included a pool of the sauce, it thought it was overkill. I am not sure I would order it again; I got food poisoning later this night. It could be from the food here... We ordered 'appetizers' of garlic bread and cheese bread that both lacked flavor, both were such a waste. I did enjoy the hot sauce they provide. Do not order these, if you want bread they already provide for the table and just ask for some of the sauce. We also got two desserts, the chocolate in one of them was finger licking good.  Overall, this place is okay. Nothing to write home about and I do not think I will return.",0.4094,0.867,0.078,0.055,0.4262626262626263

2017-04-12,4.0,"A number of our friends have had great experiences here. A number of our friends have also had poor experiences here. We weren't sure what to expect, but we'd decided we wanted Italian and put a few restaurants to a vote. This is the one that won, so this is where we went and I was happy to find that things went well for us. We reserved a table for 5 and it was ready for us when we arrived. I walked through most of the dining room to get to our table and got to smell all the delicious dishes and see what people had on their plates to give me some ideas of what I might want to order. There was one Entrée I kept spotting, so I decided to give it a try. It was one of the Specials of the night and I didn't catch all the names but I think it might have been the Agnelotti Rossini, though their menu doesn't mention the baked cheese top. Back to the beginning - It's BYOB and there's no corkage fee, of which I am a huge fan! We sipped our wine while we waited for Appetizers. We ordered the Bruschetta and the Calamari Frittii. I thought both were very good but seemed very pricey compared to other items on the menu. It was $15 for the Bruschetta alone, which was 5 pieces. I just don't think I could bring myself to buy a $3 per piece bread starter again. But that's me. The pastas are also not cheap but I think the portions and quality make it more justifiable. Main meals came out not too long after and we passed our plates around to try everyone's dishes. I was very happy with mine, but I found I enjoyed others' more. There was a pesto-stuffed pasta that was also a feature and my friend got a decadent Lobster Ravioli with a luscious cream sauce. There was a tasty chicken dish, but the winner was my other friend's Pappardelle con Porcini. I need to preface this by saying that I mostly loathe mushrooms, but this worked so well. The best way to describe it would be as the best Mushroom Stroganoff you've ever had. There was no rush to leave, so we sipped coffee and nibbled on a few Desserts. Their Tiramisu perfectly rounded off the evening.",0.9971,0.767,0.193,0.04,0.5466283524904214

2017-02-14,3.0,"Been meaning to check this place out as I pass it every day on the way to work.  Cute decor, very festive.  There is street parking (no lot), but be warned that the parking on Wilson is only for one hour.   Sat down and three slices of bread came out on a plate with cheese...figured there was a slice for each of us.  I ordered the bruschetta con boconcini mozzarella; the garlic was almost overpowering to the point that you almost missed the tomatoes.   The chicken parm should be called the chicken farm as the piece of chicken took up the whole plate.  Very impressive size, covered in a red sauce and lots of cheese.  This came with a side of pasta, but it was dwarfed next to the chicken. The penne matriciana  (penne pasta with homemade italian sausage and meatballs, served in a homemade marinara sauce filled with, onions, sliced pancetta, white wine, garlic and parmesan cheese) was nice.  Again a little too heavy on the garlic for me, but the serving of meatballs and sausage was nice as I tend to have to order an extra side of meat, depending on which is in the dish originally.  Sausage was tender enough that I didn't really need a  knife to cut it.  While this was a nice dish, I didn't think that the $26 price was justified as it didn't come with soup or salad. For dessert I had the chocolate soufflé with a scoop of vanilla gelato.  Nice flavor and texture...the gelato was nice as well.  Lovely sensation of hot and cold going on. Food was solid, but a little too much garlic for my taste.  I like that they are BYOB, but feel the prices for some of the dishes are too high considering that they are pasta.   Also the charge to split a dish seems trifling considering the size of some of the dishes.  Not sure what the charge is as I have heard that it is $10, but on the website it says $5. Food was good, but for the price, I feel that there are better options when looking at overall value and taste.  I could eat here again, but would probably do take out, as I observed several people do.  This way I could split a dish without the extra charge.",0.9946,0.836,0.146,0.019,0.5791944444444446

2017-01-04,4.0,"Came here for a gathering with a group of friends (about 15 of us) and enjoyed the food and atmosphere. They take reservations for groups bigger than 4 so I would suggest calling if you have a group bigger than that. They offer packages for big groups, but depending on the day, you can just order single items. Talk to the main chef first before making arrangements on a package or not.  **Make sure if you do order single items, that you ask your party to bring cash. They only require you to put it on one bill and only use up to 4 CCs maximum/check. If you use more than 4 CCs, there is a small service fee. There is also a small service fee for splitting checks as well at a table. My party just brought cash and everything worked out great.  The food was great, we seemed to all enjoy it. Be advised that the food you order does come in big portions, good enough to split with another friend, however, if you do split a plate, there is also another service fee ($4 I believe).  Good food, prices for the plates are a little high (average about $19-$20) however understandable when you are not paying for alcohol and there's not even a corkage fee for BYOB. Drink and be Merry!

It was literally the best meat lasagna I have ever had. My dad agreed but we only had 1 issue that kinda gave us a bad taste.  There was a $10 SPLIT charge on top of the lasagna that we were not informed of by the waiter. I understand that some restaurants have this rule for splitting dishes but if we were informed we would've just gotten a 3rd entree or even an salad to split.  All in all, it was still great Italian food in Lincoln Square.

Although the portions were huge, I think it was a little overpriced considering that the only accompaniment to the meal was 3 pieces of bland, white bread- no butter, no oil. There is another Italian restaurant in Andersonville that is similarly priced and includes foccacia bread and salad.  The lemon sorbet was extremely nice but overpriced for the amount.

We started with a couple appetizers then ordered our entrees and we did not think that the portions were huge. In fact when the 1st plates of chicken and veal parm came out we thought they had already split the meals (they charged addl $5 for splitting the entrees yet never did so!?)  The chicken parm and veal parm portions were really just enough for one. The entree is served on a large plate that is drowning in red sauce which makes it appear to be larger than what it is. The chicken parm came with a scoop of pasta served with bland marinara sauce on the side. Honestly I think Barnelli's pasta tastes much better at a fraction of the cost. The veal parm didn't come with a side @ $22 plus the $5 for splitting - so we ordered a side of pasta. The other (3) entrees were equally unimpressive. The Service is kind of slow then again with a party of 6 or more they add 20% gratuity so they didn't have to work for it. The place is dated, doesn't have much ambience and overpriced based on the quality of the food. The food is mediocre at best so for the same price you can go to Capri or Maggiano's.

I was very polite, expressed that service had been great but that I couldn't eat my meal due to it being over salted, partially cold and it's appearance clearly showing that it had sat on the line for a long time before it arrived at our table. My real issue was that my husband and I were accosted by the manager. He came over to inquire about me not liking the food and then began to defend his restaurant. I politely interrupted explaining that what he was doing was inappropriate, that service was great, but that we didn't like the food. He started screaming at me and my husband to ""get a life"", ""don't come back"" and my favorite..""you belong in Lincoln Sq"". This was after we paid and tipped of course. I shoulda known something was up after I sent the food back and got nasty looks from the manager before he approached my table. I've read many reviewers with the same experiences- especially women.

This entree is penne pasta in marinara sauce with pancetta, onion, garlic, white wine, parmesan cheese, italian sausage and meatballs. So so good. Licked my plate clean. The tiramisu and cheesecake are must haves if you still have room. We were a bit annoyed by the woman (either an owner or manager) who saw that we had paid our bill and asked us to leave to make way for another party.

My boyfriend got one of the veal entree dishes and it really didn't have much to it. There was little meat and it was literally all sauce. Just not at all decent.

Moving past that, it then took another 20 minutes to get our order taken, with no offers of water refills in the middle.  After receiving our food, the waiter did not come even once to ask how our food was and we had to request a water refill.  We then requested boxes.  We received our boxed food and the dessert menus.  Three of the people in our group wanted desserts.  However, after 15 minutes of waiting for anyone to take our order, we lost our appetite for any dessert.  During this time, one of our party caught our waiters eye multiple times, however he continued to talk to his friends at the bar.  We then had to ask the woman who was picking up our parmesean jars to ask the waiter to get us our checks.  That then took us another ten minutes.  We finally got our check and saw a 20%/automatically added tip, no wonder our waiter did not care at all.  We will not be returning to this restaurant, which is disappointing as we used to come regularly and used to recommend it to friends.",0.5234,0.879,0.065,0.056,0.3078402366863905

The kitchen serves up cartoonishly huge portions of oversalted, oversauced (we're talking DRENCHED in sauce), overpriced, unimaginative standard Italian restaurant food. Truly disappointing, especially for the price.  -No reservations for parties under 5, which means Caro Mio caters to large (noisy) parties. -Why noisy? Four letters: BYOB.

They were very, very drunk and totally terrible people, basically holding half a restaurant hostage with their general awfulness. Caro Mio was evidently more than happy to oblige. -Caro Mio appears to have downsized. It was never a huge place, but they used to have two separate dining rooms.

The Chicken Parm is also absolutely amazing. An absolute massive piece of chicken (clearly, it's so big, the chicken must have been some Godzilla beast) smothered in mozzarella and marinara.

The staff are all so kind and helpful. The minestrone soup is delicious, and they often have a bruschetta special that we always get. The menu has many options, but my boyfriend's favorite dish is the chicken parmesan. It is a huge chicken breast on top of homemade pasta with the most amazing marinara sauce and mozzarella cheese.

The portions are quite generous as with most Italian restaurants so be prepared for an onslaught of delicious food.  As we were unprepared for the enormity of our main courses we started with the calamari - nicely fried with a zesty dipping sauce.  On our subsequent visits we decided we had two options: forego an appetizer and get two entrees or get an app and split one entrée.  We never chose option two because it would have meant I had to share my pasta which was never gonna happen. The porcini cream sauce is so so so so so tasty that even my mushroom-hating ex loved it. I'd always have about half of it and then heat the rest up on the stove the next night.

They don't take reservations for parties under 6 and will fill up on the weekend by 7:30. Park on Wilson for free-no permit required. My parents and I went after an afternoon concert in Lincoln Square. Come hungry because their portions are ample. The tomato salad and minestrone soup were standard for Italian restaurants and satisfying. I ordered the Gnocchi special which was gnocchi stuffed with pesto and ricotta cheese in a tomato sauce. The gnocchi was incredibly light and flavorful which sets this apart from a lot of places.  The tomato sauce was clearly fresh and creamy. My mom ordered the chicken Parmesan with homemade rigatoni. Not only was it at least two meals but the rigatoni was incredible.

2014-12-01,5.0,"""It was a Dark & Stormy Night..."", no...REALLY...it was a pitch black night with epic rains that flooded the curbs!!! And of course, THAT was the night that my best friend and I chose to try this Italian restaurant that I found on *bing*. (NOTE: I can NOT stand Italian Food!!! I hate pizza, pasta and red sauce, so when I asked my best friend ""What kind of place do you want to celebrate your birthday?"", I was hoping and praying that he'd say ""Thai! Indian! American!"" (groan, ANYTHING BUT ITALIAN!) Since this type of food is not in my knowledge base, I reached out to several Italian friends who kindly recommended Italian restaurants in the Loop and Lincoln Park. I looked at their menus and their prices and said, ""WTF!!! A meal for two is a car payment!!!"" That's when I turned to *bing* and found this place. Aside from the great reviews that Caro Mio received, I chose this place for 3 important reasons: 1) FREE on-street parking!!!; 2) The interior shots! GORGEOUS!; and 3) They served FISH, which is neither pizza, pasta or red sauce so I knew that I could enjoy 'something'.  Because of the storm, we were the only people in the place for the first 1.5 hours; after the storm let up, people began to flow in, turning the place from Private to Jolly. The hosts, (a husband and wife?), were warm and gracious; I told them that not only was this our first visit to their place but it was my friend's 50th birthday. Service was impeccable, fast and not over-bearing. And, kudos to the man who served us when he did NOT chastise me for spilling my entire glass of hard cider when I knocked it over while handing my friend his birthday gift bag. ~sorry, Caro Mio!~ I had the Salmon Vesuvio, which hand's down, was the BEST salmon dish I've ever tasted in my life!!! Portions are LARGE, so this one dish fed me for three meals: at the restaurant and two meals at home. My friend had Veal and he was in Heaven: he is crazy for Italian food and exclaimed, ""OMG! I haven't had veal taste this good since my childhood!""  We both ordered dessert: I had the limoncello ice and he had the mango cheesecake, which was delightfully served with a birthday candle and ""Happy Birthday"" written in CHOCOLATE SAUCE along the border of the plate. What a charming and personal touch! The prices are fantastic, there's no corking fee, the hosts were magnificent and both empty and partially filled, this charming bistro was a delight. I have told every single one of my friends about this hidden gem of an Italian restaurant and they've excitedly tried it out on their own...even my wealthy friends who can afford 4 times the price. Tonight, I am taking my other best friend HERE, to celebrate HER birthday: we are so very excited to enjoy their ambiance and great food.  Eating here, this place allowed me to change my mind about Italian food and realize that it can be so much more than what I had known.

2014-11-30,2.0,"Four of us went to Caro Mio last night. First off, the service was very poor, that is slow for a not too busy Saturday eventing. Our waiter said that bread would be arriving shortly after explaining the specials. It never came. I asked again for bread when the good but overpriced bruschetta($15) arrived. The bread never came.  I ordered Linguine al Arrabiatta. In the description it said julienned eggplant, onions, and green and red peppers in marinara sauce. When it arrived I was surprised that I didn't see any eggplant. I dug through a large dish of pasta and only found 5 small pieces. No red pepper. Lots of green pepper and onions. The cheapest ingredients were abundant. Not what I would expect in a $19 dollar past dish. I ordered this dish for the eggplant and arrabiatta marinara sauce. Hardly any eggplant and the sauce was too tomatoey.  I left most of the dish unfinished and I complained to the waiter who was arrogant and unapologetic. I am from an italian background and have been to Italy many times and I don't need a waiter to condescend to me. I know far more about italian cooking than he will know in his whole life.  The other's dishes were Ok. I would sum up this place as mediocre and overpriced. You are better off going to a restaurant with a liquor license.

2014-09-10,2.0,"I've been here many times before because their pasta is very good, but the reason for only 2 stars is because of my most recent experience.  Was there with a party of 6 and ordered the caprese salad to start.  When it came out I was surprised that there were 6 tomato/mozzarella pieces on the plate.  I know some restaurants will alter their portions slightly so all get a taste, and thought, what a kind gesture!  When the bill came, they charged us 18.95 for the caprese salad.  It's listed as 11.95 on the menu.  I went up to our waiter to ask about it and he said it was because there were 6 pieces.  I said we just ordered one order and no one asked him to do that.  In fact not all of us even wanted the app and we sent a piece back.  He looked at me dumbfounded (prob thought no one would notice) and said he could change it.  I said yes that would be great.  After a few minutes another gentleman (maybe the manager) came to our table and told us the price was $18.95 because we got 6 pieces.  I insisted that we didn't ask for that and simply ordered an item off the menu and were prepared to share however much came in an order.  He argued with us for a bit making all of us uncomfortable and causing a scene and finally agreed to adjust the price.  The waiter's ""mistake"" is perhaps excusable but to then send the manager out to debate $7 on a $200 bill was insulting.  To boot, when they changed the price they changed it to $12.95 instead of $11.95 but by that point I no longer wanted to argue.  The kicker is the automatic tip (it's either 18 or 20%) to parties of 5 or more (didn't most  places do away with that because of new IRS rules?)

Our waiter didn't understand what that meant. And after making a point that meant,no animal products, including eggs, and butter another waiter came by and instead of explaining that we were in good hands he was dismissive. And one of my guests thought that he had been disrespectful. When the waiter brought the food he explained that the bag that the gluten free pasta came in was corn and didn't have egg as an ingredient. I started to say that the menu said that the gluten free pasta was supposed to be home made, why did it come in a bag? And my partner kicked me, so I didn't press. Instead of Italian bread, they served white bread with a delicious garlic, red pepper and olive oil dipping sauce that was wasted on this pasty bread. The green bean salad was wonderful and they served it with the cheese on the side as we requested so our vegan could enjoy it, as well.When the bill came our vegan noticed that his dinner was ten dollars more than the other three even though we all had shrimp and meat dishes. I said it was 'because you were a pain in the ass.' And the cook had to prepare a gluten free pasta dinner with fresh veggies and olive oil that was overly salted.

2014-05-11,4.0,"Every time I go to Caro Mio, I question why I'm not here more often.  Caro Mio comes through in many ways. For starters, one has to love that they are $0 corkage. Add in that the food is good and plentiful, and we have a constant winner. The first thing to remember about Caro Mio is that the portions are very big. This always has to be kept in mind when ordering as there've been times when my eyes are much bigger than my stomach. Now, the benefit of the portions being so big, is that if you have a group with you, you can sample basically everything. My wine groups try to do this all the time, so Caro Mio is a great fit for that.  I wouldn't be giving this love to Caro Mio just because of the corkage and portion sizing. You have to have some good food to follow through, and that is case as well. This is excellent food at excellent prices. It's hard to pick out specific dishes as very rarely do I have something I don't enjoy. It's also well worth checking out one of the specials as I've always been impressed with them.  Caro Mio is a major win. It should be in every BYO lover's rotation as the food is excellent, the service is great, and the prices are very reasonable.

It was one gigantic piece of flattened, dry, under seasoned chicken with a blanket of cheese on top. It came with a small side of pasta.  Since the chicken triggered a gag reflex, I ate the 20 pieces of pasta and the cheese off the top of the chicken.

The garlic bread especially was a highlight for me--they put so much fresh garlic on top that it was almost spicy, so if you love garlic I would highly recommend it. Everything was very flavorful. Atmosphere was a little cramped, but they were very busy both times so I didn't mind. I also appreciate that it is BYOB--while I sometimes love trying new wines or suggested pairings, that can get very expensive, so bringing my own is welcome.   Because yes, I like saving money, which brings me to my only complaint, and the reason I am deducting 2 stars. Being young doesn't make me cheap. The first time I went here, I was with my aunt and uncle, who are older, and service was fantastic even though they were quite busy. The second time, it was just my boyfriend and I, and the service was shockingly bad--even when compared to the table right next to us that had with the same waiter! He would come check on them and not even glance at us, it took forever to order our entrees, and later dessert (we were there for more than 2 hours). I had to ask for more water. And the whole time we were watching someone else get better service from the same person for no good reason. Was it because they were older? Are they regulars? Were they better dressed?   Perhaps our waiter assumed we weren't worth the effort, and is now thinking he was right, since after being treated so poorly there was no way we would leave a good tip. So now the next young couple will get the same treatment. I find this extremely frustrating.   Due to the location and the flavor, I really want to love this place, but I'm struggling with the way I was treated last time and not sure I want to rush back.",0.9887,0.763,0.164,0.073,0.4759123447358742

2014-01-20,3.0,"My Caro Mio habit fell away over the last couple of years, thanks to financial issues, family issues, cat issues, whatever . . . I've been wanting to revisit and see how Caro Mio changed, if it has changed, since it expanded next door into the old Cuban restaurant, and since I don't know the dining room staff anymore. While the setting is still beautiful, the food has declined. Caro Mio is still BYOB without any corkage fee, and that is a wonderful thing. Caro Mio is open on the ""off"" nights of Monday and Tuesday, and that is good, too. What's declined is the food. In the past, as soon as you sat down, you were given a basket of fresh, hot, crusty bread, two small plates, a bottle of olive oil, and served choices of Parmesan, garlic in olive oil, or hot pepper, so you had a wonderful little selection to start with. It really was heavenly. That's gone. We got some common bread with no side of anything after we ordered. I could get that bread at Jewel. Big disappointment. My friend ordered the gnocchi of the day, and she liked it. A huge serving, of course - she took half of it home. I ordered capellini noodles with carbonara sauce. It was dry, dry, dry. We had a small bottle of olive oil on the table, and I liberally doused my entree with it, trying to infuse it with some kind of moisture. It didn't help. Somebody eventually came by to check on our food. When asked how my entree was, I said, ""It's very dry, and adding olive oil isn't helping."" I think the server nodded. Certainly there was no verbal reply.  We shared a tiramisu for dessert. It was very good. There are specials every night. The basic menu has not changed at all, in all the years I've come here. That can be a good thing or a bad thing, depending how attached you are to certain menu selections. For my part, I'm wondering if the kitchen staff has just gotten bored. I've ordered the carbonara in the past, and it was wonderful. I won't do it again. It's very sad to see a beloved neighborhood institution going downhill. I hope the people who run Caro Mio will pay more attention to the food and add some life to it.

2013-07-05,5.0,"I have been to many Italian restaurants throughout my lifetime and there have been many that have been on my ""Look at that, they have great Italian food"" list.  However, this one topped the charts.  This little restaurant exudes Italian culture and there is something about it that sets it apart from the rest.  One of the best attributes is that they make their own pasta in house.  It is also BYOB with ZERO corking fee which is utterly fantastic (especially when you come with a large group that loves wine).   Upon entering Caro Mio, you will notice an intimate setting filled with calm lighting, amazing smells and beautiful music that extends way beyond the typical Frank Sinatra.  The hosts and servers are on top of their game here, immediately providing cork service for our many wine bottles.  Our orders were taken within the first five minutes of arriving and our food arrived very shortly thereafter.  Let me remind you that I love authentic Italian food- I adore it.  However, I had never had gnocchi quite like the way Caro Mio created it and I fell in love all over again.  It was so delicious, practically melting in my mouth and you really can't put a price on something that makes you feel as though you have died and gone to heaven.  The portion size was so large that I probably repeated the death and heaven travel process nearly a hundred times and it still did not feel like enough.   If you love the Olive Garden and chain restaurants that are similar, you will be shocked when you head to Caro Mio.  It is definitely different which is a great thing.  I don't need to be a part of the ""family"", I just want great food and so I have decided to remove myself from the typical chain and keep Caro Mio as my go-to Italian place. I could probably go on and on about the amazing experience that took place that night, but really, what is the point?  The best way to figure it out for yourself is to go there (AND YOU DEFINITELY SHOULD).",0.9933,0.819,0.164,0.017,0.5325108225108225

I've had bad, decent, and in cases like this one, pretty darn good, but never great. This was more on the level of really good food that your friend's Italian mother makes.

Nothing of the kind: we were shown to the worst table: your typical ""dump the worst first"" tactics. The waiter was okay, but it took forever for our dishes to arrive. Obviously, the priority here is to stuff as many tables (and paying customers) as possible in the small area, and the kitchen is probably as tiny and understaffed. My gnocci (not a sure spelling) was okay, although I wish there was some other stuff on the big plate to kind of spruce it up. her frutti de mare (again the spelling) was pedestrian at best: pasta was ordinary and the seafood was sparce. All in all, a very average experience. The kicker and the hook is the BYO status without corkage fee, but our check with just two items came to $52.00, which more than offsets the BYOness of the place. The best feature? the customers.

Next the positive(?): The wait staff.  The vast majority of them are Latino men, and most are what I'd like refer as to ""muy guapos.""

I had the risotto Gorgonzola which was WAY more food than anyone needs to eat but was outstanding. I also thought the meatballs and sausage were fantastic. In fact the bruschetta was probably the best I've ever had! BYOB is always fun, as long as you remember to bring enough to drink as I didn't see anything nearby and no cork fee is a bonus. Food prices seemed a tad high, but the amount of food you get *shrugs* maybe worth it.  The only reason I'm not giving Caro Mio 5 stars is because service was a bit slow. I get that it's BYOB so maybe the waitstaff doesn't need to stop by every few minutes but at one point it had been about 10 minutes of waiting before he came back over and we could ask for our wine to be opened. This was before our food arrived. Now the place gets busy and I get that, but a quick stop by to see if anything is needed is always a good idea and if our waiter had been just a little more attentive not only would we have added even more to his tip but I'd be giving the place 5 stars.

Not that I am a culinary superstar or anything, but I've always prepared pretty fantastic Italian food at home. I saw no need to go out for it. Caro Mio changed that for me.  Caro Mio was a backup choice after my original dinner plans fell through. From the outside, you wouldn't really expect much. It looks like a small mom and pop type of restaurant. The interior is nice, but not over the top . Caro Mio is dimly lit and romantic in the evenings. I like it.  On my initial visit to Caro Mio I ordered the zuppa di pesce. It is amazing. It was filled with seafood deliciousness. At first I thought $25 was a bit pricey for the dish, but there was enough food that it fed me for  two days! Well worth the price.  On my most recent visit to Caro Mio I had the linguine alla pescatore puttanesca*. Another seafood dish, this time it was shrimp and calamari. It was fantastic. One of the best things I have eaten all year. Once again, there was enough leftover that I had the remainder for lunch the next day. It was just as enjoyable on day 2.  Caro Mio manages to produce Italian food that I know I can't replicate at home. The service has been steller with each visit. The dishes I have had have been Italian culinary perfection. They also are BYOB with no corking fee. This is great because the food isn't cheap, but your booze can be!  *Food trivia: Puttanesca means ""whore style"".

For my main dish I ordered the chicken tortellini with fresh tomato sauce. This dish knocked my socks off. The freshness of the homemade pasta is virtually unmatched. The winning dish at my table of 4 though was one of the specials- homemade rigatoni with bolognese sauce topped with chicken parm. The dish was huge. The best part was definitely the noodles. They were thick and perfectly cooked. I've never had anything like it and I'm still dreaming about it. (My husband was sorry he ever shared because I couldn't keep my fork off his plate).  Everything sounded perfect, so why the 4 stars? The ambiance was a bit lacking for me. Had we been seated in the main dining area, this might have been a 5 star review. However we were taken back outside to enter their private dining room, which I guess was open to the public that night.  It did not have nearly the charm of the main dining area and I thought it smelled odd.

I had a Salmon pimento, which was salmon, balsamic, pine nuts and spring onions. I expected balsamic drizzled over the salmon. I got my salmon engulfed in a lake of the most sickly sweet and sticky balsamic vinegar. There must have been about a quarter of a inch of balsamic on the bottom of the bowl. The pine nuts and spring onions floated on the top. I had to struggle to eat the dish. My husband ordered an aubergine parmegano which had chewy aubergine, and to our taste was too salty.   If the meal had been inexpensive I don't think I would be as gutted, but the salmon dish was well over 20 USD. The staff were nice enough but I'm not sure we want to risk coming back. Maybe the pasta dishes are more reliable.  We also ordered off the menu, rather than the specials, and it was a Monday night so I'm wondering whether the regular chef had had the night off.

I'm a sucker for those little potato dumplings...  I could eat gnocchi every day!  The pappardelli arrabiatta don gamberiwas amazing.  You could tell that the pasta noodles were freshly made.  And the spicy arrabiatta sauce was the perfect compliment.  The shrimp were cooked just right and the veggies gave it a little texture.  I loved this dish.  There was so much food that I had to take it all home!   I was eyeing the dessert menu but settled on just an espresso to sober me up a bit...

As it turns out, they were fullway decent. Went on Mother's Day with my whole nuclear family, 6 in total. All of us enjoyed the heck out of our food. I recommend getting the specials that aren't on the menu. The waiter gave us the rundown, and the females in the family made him repeat the list of special specials (so special, they aren't on the menu!) to hear his Italian accent again.  Anyways, I had a chicken breast in porcini mushroom sauce with housemade portobello mushroom ravioli. Delicate, tender pasta, perfectly cooked chicken, and super flavorful sauce. The only criticism was it was a bit salty, but I like salt. For someone more sensitive to it, could be overwhelming. Everyone had one of the ""special specials,"" except my sister, who had a normal special, the salmon picatta. She, and all of my family, raved about their food. $24-ish per entree. Not cheap, but worth it, in my opinion. BYOB makes it all the more affordable. Oh, and we had the bruschetta, and calamari appetizers. Nice bruschetta, very fresh tasting. Calamari was exactly as it should be. If you order calamari and it comes out rubbery, immediately flip over the table in fury and storm out, even if you already ordered your entrees, because a poor calamari portends poor entrees.

It didn't have the traditional fresh basil leaf on top. It had actual  small pieces of dry oregano on top of the mozzarella cheese cheese with a crostini that was crispy but not too dry. The tomato was also minced, not chopped that was nice because in one bite my tomato wouldn't fall off, haha. After the appetizer, I ordered the spinach gnocchi and it was super rich by means that the sauce stuck to the plate. The portions here are not too bad. The flavors are so stick to your rib, you have to have a to-go box. The creamy gorganzola cheese sauce was good but lacked just a bit of flavor, I prefered the one with the tomato sauce which was Super flavorful. The gnocchi was super good though, it was airy and fluffy. Tried a bit of my friends lasagna portion which was more than plenty and pretty delicious. The one I wasn't too fond of was the Lobster ravioli, which could have been the sauce that it was paired with, it almost clashed. However, my friend enjoyed it. If you must visit, please RSVP the place is super small. The staff is super accommodating and nice. Would definitely come back again.",0.9985,0.708,0.269,0.023,0.5332605428759275

My food was ample, but it wasnt good. The caccitore was butchered in a way that made it seem the chicken had fought for its life. The arrabiata dish i ordered had jalapenos in it......italian food doesnt have jalapenos. (red pepper flakes, sure). Its a kitschy place, but i wouldnt say its romantic.

Typically I do not prefer Italian, I can make pasta at home. I had heard rave reviews, though, of Caro Mio. Suggesting a date night on Friday night to my boyfriend we decided to just walk a few feet and try this place out.  I had popped in earlier to ask whether or not we needed to make reservations (we were walking our dog at the time) and he told me no, they had ""plenty of tables"" (it's VERY small in there!)...  We came back after walking the pup, and there were 2 parties of 10 in front of us. As I look around there are no longer ANY tables available. My boyfriend speaks to the manager, he tells him we live 1 minute away and would like to become regulars. We had stopped in and they told us not to worry about waiting/making a reservation. The man tells us that they do not take reservations (word to the wise, folks) and then pulls out a note pad with tons of 2 party ""reservations"" and claims they are ""waiting for tables to open""... Isn't that a reservation? Whatever. SO, my BF being the persistent savior that he is talks him into letting us sit before the people on that list...(who were not physically there, they were on a call list). So - kudos to Caro Mio for listening to us, and letting us be seated ASAP...  We brought wine, and ordered the bruschetta. (REALLY REALLY GOOD! fresh mozz! Loved it.) and then I got some kind of... tri colored shells with marinara and cheese. It was amazing. SO good, and a large enough portion that I ate it for lunch the next day (it was even better as a left over!)... Pricey, But I highly recommend - avoid the busy times though if you don't want to wait (there is no waiting area what so ever, so you will most likely wait outside) - friday nights, saturday nights... and parking is free along Wilson so that is a plus too.",0.993,0.829,0.14,0.031,0.4595758928571429

Its main detraction is the price (~$20 for a pasta dish is a bit ridic, IMO), but the dishes my friends and I had were full of flavor. The portions are HUGE, so the fact that you get another meal out of the leftovers almost makes up for the cost.  I ate some ziti with tomato-based sauce with pancetta, onion, homemade meatballs and Italian sausage. It was absolutely delicious. I am pretty sad that the bussers mixed up my leftovers with my friend's...I got stuck eating her pappardelle with bolognese the next day (it was okay, but not as good as mine).

2011-08-22,3.0,"Really people...?  4 Stars?  5?!?!?!?!  Noooooo, this place is just alright.  I have no complaints with the service or ambiance, but the food just didn't do it for me. I was out there this weekend with a party of five.  Two off the boat Italians, and 3 who were born here (myself included in the three).  Admittedly, I'm more critical than most reviewers, particularly of Italian restaurants.  But hey, you're not reading this for a yes-man.  You're on yelp to find out what the place is really like before plunking down your hard-earned cash. Despite what the website says about reservations only for six or more, they accommodated us.  We were informed of the oft-noted ""2 hour limit"", which I don't really have a problem with.  They're running a business, we were there on a Saturday night, and being a BYOB, (no corkage fee) they lack the significant margin alcohol typically carries at a restaurant.  They have to make it up on turnover.  Get over it people. So onto the food: For me, first impressions at Italian restaurants come down to be bread on the table.  Good bread excites me.  And this place has bread that was average.  Not a good start, and very surprising since they have the more traditional olive oil/chopped garlic/red pepper plate instead of the more American olive oil/Parmesan. In general, the dishes were large portions that only the heartiest eater could finish.  On the downside, they were heavy on the salt and VERY heavy on the oil.  Not at all how Italians cook.  We use simple, flavorful ingredients that don't need much doctoring. Here's the part where you can stop if you want.  From here on out, I'm just going into more detail about our particular dishes. Appetizers were grilled eggplant and polenta.  The eggplant was terrible - very seedy, and therefore, bitter.  The chef compensated by using a lot of salt, but it just made it inedible.  The polenta was OK - lacking some flavor, but the sauce was very flavorful and made up for it. Going around the table: Gnocchi in marina - The gnocchi were surprisingly light, but had no flavor whatsoever.  Sauce was good, but again, salty. Chicken in some kind of reduction with mushroom-stuffed ravioli (one of the evening's specials) - the chicken was pretty typical, but the ravioli were tasty.  Both the pasta and the stuffing.  Unfortunately, the person who ordered this spent half his meal scraping off the sauce.  WAY too much.  Seriously, it was like soup. Veal arrabiata - Veal was tender, but not cut-it-with-a-fork-tender like the good stuff should be.  For the price though, it represented a decent value.  The gravy had just the right amount of spice, (present but not overpowering) but again, way too much on the plate. Veal in some kind of a wine sauce with potatoes - Same issues with the veal, sauce, salt, etc.  A little bland, even with all the salt. Linguine frutta di mare - tons of calamari.  Good calamari at that.  Actually, all of the seafood was good.  This was my plate, and I found it to be oversalted to the lowest degree of the plates we ordered.  The pasta was of good quality and cooked al dente.  The biggest problem I had was the amount of oil in this plate.  EASILY 1/3 of a cup, maybe a half a cup remained after I had finished.  I was actually eating the linguine the old-school Italian way - twirling it in a spoon - out of necessity to wring as much oil out of it as I could.

2011-07-22,5.0,"I've had good Italian food my entire life. Of course I would, my grandfather was from Sicily and all the good family recipes have been passed down to my mom, who is my favorite chef in the world. Also, I grew up in St. Louis, and have eaten meals on The Hill (the Italian community), so yes, I know good Italian food. However... Nothing could possibly top the food we had at Caro Mio off Wilson Ave. This BYOB place is small, fitting maybe 30 people maximum in the restaurant. Due to it's small size, it was pretty loud, a little cramped, and our waiter sometimes seemed to forget we were sitting in the corner. HOWEVER, after a long wait for our food, it was completely and utterly worth it.  It is hands down the best Italian food I've had ever.  The dish I ordered, the pappardelle with mushrooms and wine based cream sauce, was the winner of the table. (We all shared, family style) So flavorful and rich that I could only manage a quarter of the huge portion before I was full, and even after everyone at the table had their fill of mine, there was enough left over for another meal.The second place winner was the evening's special, gnocchi stuffed with cheese and topped with a mild creamy tomato sauce and parmesan cheese. Third place was the Eggplant Parmigiano, which was good, but very garlicky. Last place was the spicy veal, which I obviously cannot attest to how it tasted- I would never eat veal. As a closer, we all shared the house-made tiramisu. Which was topped with scoops of vanilla bean gelato. It disappeared in seconds.

The best part is that it's BYOB with no corkage fee...woot.  We downed two bottles of red like it was no thang and devoured some serious plates of carbs.  I read here on Yelp that the Spinach Gnocchi was pretty fabulous so that's what I ordered and yay for cream sauce.  That is why I work out. Husband wanted to be a copier but he chose the gnocchi special, stuffed with asiago cheese in a creamy tomato sauce.  I tried mine and thought it was heavenly.  Then I tried his and thought mine sucked, that's how good his was.  I stole three more pieces before he gave me a look that told me he was going to stab me in the wrist with his fork if I took any more.  And then I proceeded to eat all but four pieces of my gnocchi so it definitely wasn't bad but I was staring longingly at his plate for awhile. Overall, definite thumbs up.  The homemade pasta dishes hover right around $18-$23 a plate, but if you're not a hoss like me, you can eat half and be comfortably full and eat the other half for lunch the next day.  That was the plan that flew out the window after a few bites.  Skip the side salad though, nothing fancy for $8.",0.9963,0.722,0.224,0.055,0.4768772893772893

The dishes were $16 each so it wasn't worth splitting it. Bill on a Monday night for a family of 5 with no drinks (only water an no apptz!) was $165.

If you like American-Italian with LOADS of sauce, then this is for you. The servings are indeed generous and each pasta would cater for two people. I commend the generosity of the servings.  However this is not really our thing - we are after flavor. We had the polenta in tomato sauce which was ok, not really grilled enough for my tastes to bring the flavor out in the polenta and it was masked by the red sauce a fair bit. The bruschetta with mozz was fairly good - very generous servings, with the tomato finely cut and nicely marinated with oil and herbs. This was the nicest thing we ate. For entrees we got the lobster ravioli in cream sauce w/ sundried tomatoes and the cavatelli con salisiccia, with homemade sausage. Overall the pastas were very one note with tons of sauce and not much variety. The lobster ravioli overall was quite salty and the sauce just overpowered it to the point where it was like eating a bowl of cream.

The service here on a Wednesday night was attentive and I love the fact gthat it's BYOB. However, it is heavy, heavy, heavy on the parts of American Italian cuisine that I really don't like--i.e. lots of raw garlic in everything and heavy red sauce on most items that gave me serious indigestion for the rest of the night. We started with the brushetta, sans mozzarella as we were both hoping for a lighter meal. It was okay, but lacking fresh basil and the overabundance of raw garlic wasn't doing it for me.  I wanted something with lots of veggies, so I selected two apps: the sauteed mushrooms with wine and the eggplant with mozz. Unfortunately, both were smothered in a red sauce that had lots of raw garlic (not sauteed at all--clearly just stirred into the sauce) and both were oversalted and heavy. The house bread was soft, bland, and not crusty at all--clearly store bought, so it wasn't great to sop up the veggies as I'd hoped. My husband had homemade papardelle with an eggplant sauce. The eggplant were nice, but the sauce was again, full of that raw garlic.  Maybe if we would've gotten a non-red sauce dish (i.e. one of the cream sauces), this would've been remedied, as their homemade pasta had a nice texture and flavor. But we aren't huge fans of heavy on the cheese and cream sauces. BTW--the portions here are HUGE, but pricey ($22 for a simple vegetarian pasta dish?), and they charge you $8 to split an entree. So, we left here having had an app and the equivalent of two veg entrees with no alcohol or dessert for over $60. Pretty pricey, if you ask me. Which all leads me to: who said that raw garlic = Italian? I don't know, unless you're lightly seasoning with raw garlic in an app or dressing. Raw garlic has no place in a cooked sauce! Or as a topping for bread (though rubbing a slice of toasted bread lightly with a garlic clove is a good idea)! No one does that in Italy--just ask Marcella Hazan ( bit.ly/gKo14W ): Q. What is the biggest mistake we still make in cooking Italian food? A. Too much garlic! Too much ruins everything. We say in Italy that what you keep out is as important as what you put in.  Carol Mio--remember that: what you keep out is as important as what you put in. I'll be going elsewhere for Italian, or cooking my own at home.",-0.3498,0.855,0.075,0.07,0.5112065018315017

Admittedly, we were about 10 minutes late but had called and they said it would be no problem to get our table. We walked in with no host to greet us and a large group of people wondering who to talk to be checked in. We ended up being told they overbooked the restaurant and ended up waiting an hour for our table along with another couple. We were asked to move so they could make a table by the drafty front door? (we declined).  The minestrone soup was fantastic, tasted so hearty like grandma made it special. We split the spinach gnocchi with gorganzola cheese sauce which I felt i could have made at home for way cheaper. The tiramisu they said is homemade and tasted like it, delicious!  Our server was hardly hospitable, rarely came to see if we needed anything. I I had to ask several times for more bread and finally received it when i was finished eating.  Though they did give us a tiramisu for having us wait for the table, I was left disappointed with the overall experience, wondering where my romantic dinner night was.",0.9631,0.825,0.125,0.05,0.5112155388471178

Whatever that is, it is unknown to the chefs at Caro Mio.  But the main reason that I was stimulated to write this review - I usually do not bother - is the attitude of the waiter and apparently the manager.  He initially came around and asked how everything was - yes, I mistakenly said ok.  I then told him what I mentioned above about my dish - the lobster ravioli.  Then my companion wrote a review about our meals. She and I both signed this and I handed it to the waiter who became defensive, stating that I should have said something ""when asked and the chef could have done something.""  The waiter was not at all apologetic about our complaints.  We would only return should we be offered a gift certificate for a future meal and then only return again if we were wowed by that meal.",0.9648,0.857,0.111,0.032,0.5037981859410431

We had bruschetta for an appetizer; it was simple but really fresh with great flavors. My dad and I both had the gnocchi that was on special - spinach stuffed gnocchi with a creamy tomato sauce. My dad opted to substitute marinara, but the sauce wasn't overly creamy or heavy for me. My mom got the chicken tortolloni, which she said was really good as I couldn't taste it. Service was good.

The Frittura was a seafood pasta dish.  I am not an expert with this dish or Italian Cuisine, but the dish just did not work.  The tomato pasta sauce did not work well with the seafood.  The beef shank dish could have been good, but the problem was the bone for the shank became the highlight of the dish rather than the meat.  I'm talking a bone that took up half the plate.  It became somewhat comical towards the completion of that dish as almost everyone at the table requested to have more beef but was surprised to learn that was a bone sitting on the plate.  Dessert was fierce.  We had the tiramisu and some lemon ice cream.  Probably the best Tiramisu I've tasted.     The biggest disappointment was the service, or lack there of.  Our server was very nice and spiced up the evening for me and my family as he spoke in a very thick Italian accent making the dinner more authentic.  However, regardless of him being nice, we never saw him more than twice during the length of our dinner.  We waited 15 minutes between when the last dish was cleared off our table until we were approached with dessert menus.  Then another 15 minutes between when the dessert was finished to a follow up.    A lot of the service issues can be a result of us dining in with such a big group.  Places usually calculate gratuity for groups of 6 or more, which most of the time, can result in the server to avoid giving the extra attention to your table as compared to the attention they would give to a table where his service would affect the amount of gratuity he will receive.  A LOT of places in Chicago fall in this category and it is quite unfortunate.   Overall, mediocre Italian Cuisine (for Chicago) with a serious need for their service to be addressed.",0.8825,0.873,0.073,0.054,0.5086617647058824

One of my guests said it was the best meal of her life. That's a strong statement, but I would say it was one of the best meals I've had in a very long time. The four of us had separate plates, and each plate provided a different taste experience, which is nice; so many restaurants ""recycle"" their sauces so that they can have a huge menu, but just a few stock ingredients in the kitchen. Not so here. Each plate was different from the next. Desserts were absolutely top-notch as well. Part of the reason my experience was so good was the atmosphere of the place.

After that I just tasted that familiar taste that one finds in cheetos, doritos or boxed mac and cheese mix......which really does make everything taste better, but its just not right for a restaurant to rely on something so easy.

2010-07-07,4.0,"If you are looking for authentic Italian cuisine at a reasonable price, this is the place for you.  While this delicious restaurant is in an unexpected area (perhaps just for me since I don't usually frequent Wilson Ave.), the food gets two enthusiastic thumbs up.  We started with the bruschetta special, which had slices of freshly cut mozzarella cheese drizzled with olive oil and garlic. It was by far the most delicious and perfected bruschetta I've had in my life.  Most places, the bread is either too crisp or too soggy.  This bread was perfect with a great garlic flavor, the fresh tomatoes were seasoned well and all together with the slightly melted mozzarella, well, let's just say I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.  I then moved on to my main course.  I again chose one of the specials which is pretty standard for me when trying a new restaurant. I had the asiago and pesto stuffed gnocchi with a hearty meat sauce. It was amazing, almost like little pillows of fluffy deliciousness. The meat sauce had a robust flavor and didn't overdo the meat to sauce ratio that so many other Italian restaurants fail.  The only real downside to this restaurant is that it is so small. If you are trying to have a large group meal, I wouldn't recommend doing it here.  My only other small critique of this restaurant is that the olive oil they serve on the table is quite salty for my personal taste (and shame on me for not trying it before I added salt and pepper)!  When I used it the second time without adding salt/pepper, it still seemed quite salty but is definitely something I can overlook in comparison to the rest of the quality cuisine.",0.9686,0.856,0.115,0.029,0.5292803030303029

I highly recommend the homemade pasta.  Anything in this section of the menu is delish!  I went basic the first time and had their cheese ravioli - just awesome.  Second time added some chicken tortellini.  Again - just wonderful to eat.  For dessert we had the lemon...something.  Can't remember the name.  You'll know it on the menu.  Very good.  A nice refreshing way to end the meal.   I've never had a problem with the service.  Waiters and bussers are attentive and we never waited long for anything.,0.9927,0.758,0.22,0.022,0.5331159420289854

They offer a decent selection of pastas, although we were a bit confused with our waiter's explanation of the homemade vs. out of the box choices (and the difference in cost, at least according to him). In fact, our server was the worst part of our dining experience. He was impatient, distracted, and at times, downright rude. At one point, he actually walked away as my husband was still speaking to him. We literally had to ask someone to send him back to our table, which clearly annoyed him. When I asked  questions about how certain foods are prepared (since I have several food allergies), his answers were all over the place, and at times, his visible irritation with my (very necessary) questions made me feel extremely uncomfortable.  Regarding the food, my entree was okay; nothing special - and somewhat over-priced. My husband ordered some sort of seafood pasta - which he thoroughly enjoyed.

You will get seated right away, but after the water comes out, the bread takes awhile. Then you dump on the olive oil and fresh garlic and grated parmesan and wait to be waited upon. It kinda sucks. But I drink my wine like it's going out of style, so I don't really notice. They bring you a bucket to chill it in and uncork it for free.

The fried calamari is some of the best I've had, but the fresh calamari salad is outstanding. It is enormous, so share with your friends. The balsamic dressing is very flavorful and complements the ingredients well.  The service isn't especially quick, but they make up for it in personality.

My girlfriend had the cheese ravioli which was good, but the bolognese sauce missed the target.  We were there with a group of 10 and I don't think I heard one person rave about what they ate.

Now, we just went back over the weekend and asked about the owner or his son.  This waiter (who claimed to have been working there for 8 years) said that the restaurant is/always has been owned by a Venezuelan with no children.  Not that I really care (except that now I know a Venezuelan is behind the menu and that makes a little more sense), but what's going on with all the waiters having a different story!?   Food was exactly how I remembered it.   Average.  I got some chicken dish stuffed with prociutto, served with 3 cheese ravioli and drowning a creamy alfredo-type sauce...not good.  Entirely too rich and overdone with the cheese.  Picked off my ma's plate, which was baked eggplant...and fantastic.  Next time I guess I'll order that.

The table next to us recommended that we try their green bean salad and share an entree as their portions are HUGE! The green bean salad was very refreshing, light, and crisp. Most places tend to over cook green beans, but this was prepared perfectly. For entree we decided to split the shrimp in a spicy red sauce with linguini. WOW, it was probably one of the best spicy red sauce with shrimp I've had anywhere!  The only downside is that we waited forever between each course. We had spent over an hour there and had to flag someone down to get our check.

If I lived a little closer, my boyfriend and I would be heading here every couple weeks! After bookmarking Caro Mio over 3 months ago, I finally made it in. That is the one downside to this place: no reservations, so get there early or be prepared to wait a LONG time.  Prices were extremely reasonable for the quality of food and the ambiance is great. It's small, but I love the funky, bright art on the walls and the plants by the window to shield the restaurant from the sidewalk without losing the natural light. My group of 3 decided to all share our meals. We started with the polenta which was good, but didn't realy blow my mind. You could tell the tomato sauce was homemade, though. We also ordered two of the special entrees:  Gnocchi stuffed with pesto ricotta in a tomato cream sauce (definitely my absolute favorite-incredibly light if you can believe it from that description. yummy pillows of hand made gnocchi with and intense, basily, cheesy center.) Lobster Ravioli: Lots of lobster stuffed in each ravioli with an incredibly rich cream sauce. I'm really glad we shared because I'm not sure I could've eaten an entire plate of this. It was almost too decadent for me. Our third entree was an eggplant rolled with cheese, rice noodles and baked with more cheese on top. It was yummy and a great, lighter dish to break up the heaviness of the other two. Um, yeah, even with all that cheese, I consider it ""light"" since it contained a vegetable. Ha! They were out of the tiramisu which seemed like a tragedy, but our super sweet server took the blame as it seems he's the one who usually makes it and he was out of town.

It was for a party of seven people for my birthday dinner at 6:30pm on Saturday night. Myself and a friend arrived at 6:30pm (our reservation time) to get our table but they do not seat incomplete parties.The short man who was ""helping us"" needed an ETA, which we gave of 10-15 minutes. The cubs were getting out, traffic was really bad, and life happens. He told us this was not good enough and asked us, ""You would'nt be late for a job interview would you?"" WHAT!!!!???? I told him that this was a nice dinner out and for entertainment purposes, in which case he responded, ""Your table is cancelled!""  Where am I? The WORST customer service EVER!!!!

A real head-case walked out and sat us by the front emergency glass door, where there was a draft of -15 degree air.  Nice.  We gestured from across the room for another table, and he pointed to another table, not saying a word, but his eyebrows almost touched his receding hairline.  Unprofessional. Oh, our server...he was such a sweet young Italian man, but we really didn't understand more than 3 words when he was telling us the specials.  He meant well, though, and tried hard.  His accent was just very thick. We ordered the eggplant appetizer which I thought was very good, but the other person in my party insisted was not cooked completely.  Also the table bread was stale.  I had the chicken tortellini.  The pasta was overcooked and almost mushy, and the chicken was just gross and dryyyyyyy.  I will say, however, that their sauce is really good and fresh. For dessert, I had the tiramisu which was probably the worst I've had with way too much espresso soaked into the lady fingers.  So much, that I requested a spoon to scoop it up before giving up halfway though.  It was a mushy mess.  But props to the lemon sorbet dessert -- it tasted amazing, actually.

2008-10-31,4.0,"My dinner pal and good buddy, Jeff Borden met me here one night. We like to meet once a month and dine somewhere neither of us have been. He's a great guy to have dinner with. Great conversation and he likes to eat at nice places that aren't mainstream. It was a bit romantic for a couple of guys, I'll admit. Nevertheless, Caro Mio? - Outstanding. Step through the front doors and begin your journey to the heart of Italy. From the paintings on the wall to the quiet candlelight table settings to the delectable aromas wafting from the kitchen, just steps away from the tables. I love to hear a  Chef ""clanking away"" in the kitchen just under the music. Wonderful. Be prepared because Caro Mio restaurant is a trip to Italy for your senses. In every bite of their fine Italian cuisine, you can taste the essence of a cozy Italian villa, over looking a rolling countryside with winding roads and a gentle sea breeze. (That was a bit sappy, I admit but I always wanted to write like that...yuk)  Service -  European, slow, authentic, but very personal, no rush, relax, take your time and drink some wine and enjoy a good conversation. I would never take a large crowd to Caro, no more than 4 people, tops. It's not that kind of place. Decor - is small, dark and romantic. You'll feel lost or in hiding. Food - ""Bella.""  Music - Euro lounge, very nice... different. Bottom-line: Bring your best bottle (or two) of Red, your best girl (or wife) and huddle and cuddle in this cozy Chicago hideaway. I'm going back but on a really snowy night, mid week, sometime in late January. This time,  I will take my wife or daughter, as shes my best girl. I have the best of both worlds.

2008-10-28,3.0,"Happy 100th review to me! Maybe I am a yelp dork, but I wanted my 100th to be something special. So, I decided on Caro Mio since it is where my hubby & I went to celebrate the anniversary of us getting engaged (3 years ago Oct 12)--yes we are those kind of people who like to celebrate those milestones others find annoying--to you haters out there--suck it!  Okay, now that we have that out of the system--let the review begin. In all honesty, I try ever so hard to rate a place by the quality of their food, not the service. With that I feel compelled to mention, that I think we got the shaft when it came to service. Unfortunately for us, there was a HUGE group (I swear like 20 people) who arrived at the same time we did. I assume they knew about this group since they had almost all their tables in the main eating area arranged for them. Now, you would think they would have arranged for more than 2 servers to be working at that time--nope! So, my hubby & I had to deal with sub-par service, good thing for them the food was good or else I would never return. plus, our server was a bit on the snarky side, normally not something that bothers me, but when combined with an almost non-existence at our table--it is a bad combo.  Now the food, was in actuality very good. Our entrees were very tasty & bountiful--I mean you probably would want to grow an extra stomach just to fit it all in. That would be awesome if you could do that, but also not gain weight in the process--one can dream can't they. My singular complaint with the food, is that it took over 40 minutes to come out. 40 MINUTES is absolutely insane for Italian food, again the flavor of the food made it worth it. I ordered the special which was homemade rigatoni, chicken parm, covered in a tomato cream sauce--very delicious, although very heavy at the same time. My hubby ordered a sausage pasta dish (the name escapes me at this moment), which I actually preferred to my dish.  Since the portions were huge, we skipped dessert. I must say that at some point I will give this place another chance as the food is really good, but I hope the service will have improved by then. If you are looking for romance, I do highly recommend this place. The ambiance is UBER romantic & very intimate. That was also another saving grace of this establishment.",0.9981,0.723,0.222,0.055,0.5763435374149659

2008-10-26,3.0,"Decent Italian, but I think it's suffering from a slight case of the overrateds. In this no-mans-land that's kind of North Centery, close to Lincoln Square, almost Andersonville, and yet known as Ravenswood, you have two really good options for a nice dinner: Mixteco and Spacca Napoli. Caro Mio isn't a bad third choice, but doesn't really stand up to the other two in terms of food quality. As is customary at many Italian restaurants, they bring you some bread and parmesan. What's different is they also offer you crushed red pepper and fresh garlic. Throw some olive oil on top of all that, spread it on your bread, and shit, you're all set. Fucking delish.  But then we got our calamari. BIG THUMBS DOWN. Almost embarrassingly poor. Flavorless with a super thin marinara dipping sauce.  For my entree, I got ""pappardelle con pomodoro secco imported sun dried tomatoes in a creamy marscapone cheese sauce $17.95"".  Now I'm not going to lie, I like stuff like this, and I ate it, but it wasn't what I was expecting. I thought it would be a well seasoned, tomato-y dish with some marscapone on top. What it amounted to was basically a very heavy fettucine alfredo with a hint of marscapone and a very slight dusting of little sun-dried tomato pieces. Are you trying to give me a heart attack? Because I already had one that morning after eating like 8 pieces of bacon.  Anyway, I put some more red pepper on top to cut the heaviness. Then, with the encouragement of my bromos, I beer bonged 3 bottle of red wine. Coronary averted.  I also tried ""imboltini di melenzana lightly breaded and pan fried eggplant rolled with vermicelli noodles, boconcini mozzarella, basil and parmesan cheese - then topped with more mozzarella cheese and baked $15.95"" which was much better. It was seasoned well and each element was balanced. It didn't make me feel like I was going to die quite as much as my dish.  Now I have good news and bad news for you. I'll give you the bad first, you pessimistic son of a bitch: Like almost every review has said, they were out of the chocolate tartufello. Does this even exist, or do they just put it on the menu to make you feel bad about yourself? How can they possibly be out of the same dessert every day? Now the good news... we got iiterally, THE last tiramisu. You could tell it was homemade and each plate made individually. Unlike most places where they just cut you a big piece off a huge whipped beast on a sheet pan, this was individual lady fingers with the marscapone and maybe some sabayon and coffee and cocoa powder. Not a huge portion, but impressive.  So yeah, if you want to be a total dick, go to Caro Mio really early in the evening and order a bunch of desserts. They'll quickly run out, and you can lol at everyone's disappointment as they find out there is no dessert left. Or you could just sit there with a bunch of desserts on your table and offer to resell them to other customers... at a handsome profit.  Shalom mofuckas. P.S. The one penis mensroom was kind of gross and the door wouldn't lock. I thought I was going to have to free up some space mid-meal.

We were originally told that it was going to be a half hour wait, but it was only ten minutes. I can handle that. They seated us in the back room, which was dark (good dark, not can't see my food dark) and quiet.  We started off with some fried calamari. Granted, I fried calamari is a fairly easy dish and most of the time, even when I have it at not so good Italian places, it's always at the very least decent. And Caro Mio's calamari mas definitely better than decent. The breading was light and crispy and the calamaris were not too oily. Then, on to their delicious, in house made pastas! There is a huge difference between boxed pasta and homemade (or restaurant made, if you will).  The lady ordered the special: gnocchi in a tomato cream sauce. It was a (fairly) basic that had just enough of those homemade, authentic touches that made it a beyond basic dish. I, on the other hand, had the pappardelle con porcini, which was beyond outstanding. It was just enough cream and oil (you know, the good stuff) in the sauce and it had the perfect mushroom flavor to it. Plus the sauce and the porcini mushrooms was paired perfectly with the the pappardelle (which is almost like a wide linguini noodle). Altogether, it was a little over $50, which isn't bad for a nice, romantic dinner at all. And BYOB with no corkage fee! Bellisimo!",0.9941,0.752,0.202,0.046,0.5640048840048839

I have been here a few times and must admit that I have some bad luck choosing a dish. The first time I went with the Risotto con Porcini, quite literally, it tasted like a salt lick. The manager was very apologetic and tried the dish himself and assured me it was very off that night. After the ptsd has subsided, I may give it another shot. The last time I went I tried a beef tenderloin dish and though it was good I was not totally wowed by it,  if you are looking for something more home-style this will be a good bet, but I like to take risks myself.

2008-04-02,3.0,"I have been to Caro Mio twice now, but I can not believe the two experiences took place at the same restaurant.  Our first time to Caro Mio, my fiance and I both had pasta dishes.  We had calamari as an appetizer and shared the lobster ravioli and the gnocchi for the main dishes.  For dessert we made on the fly lemon dish which featured limoncello and sweet lemon meringue crumbles.  I am not a huge fan of calamari, but the dinner was a celebration dinner in her honor.  The dish was cooked perfectly, tender, breaded perfectly and seasoned well.  Both pasta dishes we delicious.  The sauces were great, a little rich but great.  The dessert, especially for an improvised dish, was nice and refreshing. Last night we had a completely different experience.  We ordered the green bean salad for an appetizer, and it was by far the best part of the meal.  The beans were served with tomatoes, a hint of garlic, olive oil and balsamic vinegar and fresh mozzarella.  Our main dishes were the linguini all' arrabbiata with a side of meat balls and beef tips in a white wine and marinara sauce.  The linguini was pretty good, but the meatballs were a disappointment.  They lacked flavor and were slightly over cooked.  The presentation of the beef tips was the first turn off to this part of the meal.  The dish looked a bit like slop.  There was way too much sauce on the plate.  The beef was a bit stringy, but not horrible.  The sauce was lackluster.  Overall, the dish would have benefited from the addition of onions and peppers.  I am on the quest for the perfect Tiramisu, so we order it for dessert.  The presentation was nice, but the lady fingers were soaked too long.  This caused the dish to be soupy and grainy.  This was definitely on the lower end of the scale for Tiramisu. We love the atmosphere and the BYOB aspect.  We will definitely give the place another shot, but I think we will stick to the pasta dishes.",0.9983,0.739,0.232,0.029,0.5908119658119658

Well ok, so it was 14 below zero, snowing, and the night BEFORE Valentine's Day, but I have grown a bit more ""amenable"" in my old age. :) It was still pretty damn close to perfect.  I should preface this review with the fact that I generally do not like to ""go out"" for Italian, unless it is pizza, which I think should actually be a different genre. I feel it is usually too filling, and that we could cook it at home (which we wouldn't do, in reality, but...whatever).  But my boy is Italian, and no one does romantastic dinners like Italians, so off we trudged to Caro Mio, highly recommended on Yelp.  I can see why. Cute, cozy little restaurant with neighborhood locals chatting over wine (that they brought themselves, AMEN!). Animated Italian staff/family bustling around. The only thing I didn't like was all the plant life in the windows...I just don't get that choice for decor, but it was a minor flaw... OMG. And the food...so. GOOD. We both had the specials, I indulged in the chicken and ravioli in mushroom porcini sauce. (Thank you Chris M.) It was earthy, rich and downright sinful.

It had been years since I've been here and we were all anxious to try it again. The meal didn't disappoint. It was an amazing meal. It was a longer wait than I had anticipated to get a table. But I suppose it was 7 on a Saturday. Even with reservations some groups had to wait along with us. We waited so long that a member of our group drove to get some beer on Western & Lincoln and made it back before we were seated. Still it was worth the wait.  The service was spotty because it was so busy but when you had the staff's attention you had their complete attention. We never felt rushed to leave the table. There were several groups there celebrating birthdays that gave it a very festive atmosphere. There were people waiting for tables throughout the meal. I had a very lovely risotto. It was the perfect texture. Everyone else at the table had one of their lovely specials. It was such a great time.  It was all going well until we got our check. We were offended that they had added a gratuity to the bill. We were surprised that there wasn't a corkage fee. Was it supposed to make up for that? We would have tipped at least 20% for the service especially since it is a BYOB. I had to knock off a star for that. I think their service speaks for itself and if they don't have enough faith in that I don't know if I should. Are people usually bad tippers?,0.9875,0.81,0.147,0.043,0.4973484848484848

The walls of the restaurant are a vibrant red-pepper color, with lovely local art hanging by the light of candle-powered chandeliers. Lovely and cozy, very Chicago, and just the right atmosphere to melt away the drabness of the day. The crowd was small when we arrived, though we got the last 2-top in the dining room. Around 7 p.m., the tables really started filling up, and by the time we got our food the place was packed. That's always nice to see on a Monday! Based on the heavy traffic, I thought our food would be stellar. Our server, who was flamboyant, wildly gesticulatory and SLOOOOOOOOW as molasses in January, had plenty of good things to say about the food. We ordered... And waited. And waited some more. Half an HOUR later, our meals finally arrived. They must have gone to buy the cheap, flavorless chicken for our dishes in Italy. I'm sad about it. I had pollo alla parmigiana, sort of my Italian litmus test: rubbery, heavy on the breading and DROWNED in cheese and sauce. My cousin's chicken piccata was much prettier and tasted better (than mine), but she still wasn't terribly happy with it. We finished our food, and 15 minutes later, our very gay and adorable server came over and asked us if we wanted dessert. By that time, we'd been there more than an hour and needed to get my cousin's Zipcar back to its home, so we just wanted to leave. Another 15 minutes later, we'd signed our credit card receipts and headed back into the fog. Le sigh. Just looking for that really special restaurant experience in Chicago...

I also really really like the bread where they give you garlic, red pepper and grated parmasan cheese.  What a great idea and it was so good.",0.9826,0.722,0.278,0.0,0.4035714285714286
2007-11-22,4.0,"Dining here for the first time on a blustery and wet November evening, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food. The calamari appetizer was well prepared but was pushed to a new level with a good dose of chopped garlic (garlic makes everything better). I had the lobster ravioli in a cream sauce, which was nicely done, except for the few strips of sun dried tomatoes. The tomatoes were out of place texturally, and I felt their intensity clashed with the subtle taste of the lobster filling. I just avoided eating them (although I do love sun dried tomatoes). For dessert, I had their lemon tartufo. This was a very light lemon gelato ball with limoncello. Very delicious, even if it was served without the meringue crumbles. I have mixed feelings about the service. Let me explain: when I arrived, a few minutes early, I was greeted immediately and when seated, asked if I would like something to drink. Good thing, because I wanted coffee, which I received promptly. My friend arrived a few minutes after me, and not seeing me sat on the other side of the (very dark) restaurant. No one greeted her initially -- she said she stood at the entrance for at least a minute -- nor was she asked if she wanted anything after sitting. The difference in the level of service was confounding. (We found each other when she called me, wondering where I was, since I'm rarely late.) It's possible that she seated herself in a section that wasn't being utilized, but even so she should have been greeted. I moved myself over to her table, and after that things went smoothly.  Another little problem: I just discovered that they wrapped up my friend's leftovers instead of mine. Great, I'll get to try the stuffed gnocchi! Good thing she's a CLOSE friend of mine, otherwise, ewww. Still, overall, it was a fine experience, with good food. I'll be back to try their other dishes, for sure!",0.9958,0.788,0.187,0.025,0.49532687991021324

I had the gnocchi special - stuffed with asiago cheese and a little spinach with a creamy tomato sauce.  Awesome.  Others had the veal parm and said it was good but nothing special. The bread seemed homemade and came with the triumvirate of red pepper flakes, minced garlic, and parmesan.  Mixed with olive oil, it was a treat, but probably added to the still-full feeling I have now. $14 for the lunch is not bad, especially when you factor in the service and quality.  Did not take advantage of the BYOB as I was at lunch with co-workers.  But good to know it is there if it is an especially stressful week.

It's a nice little family-owned Italian restaurant next to the Metra track on Wilson.  It's always decently crowded, but never too crowded. Basically, the food is way too salty, and the service is extremely slow. The waiter was very knowledgeable and all, but he couldn't have been any less attentive -but it wasn't his fault. They desperately need more WAIT STAFF!!! I couldn't believe only one guy was taking care over at least a dozen tables by himself. Not surprisingly, service is really really slow although the bus boy did a great job filling up my water glass. I had been here about 9 months ago on a date, and I went back there recently with my brother. Both times, service was consistently slow since they were short on waiters. Food was good, but consistently too saucy and salty.  I usually prefer independent restaurants over chain restaurants, but I'd rather eat at Francesca's or Tuscany's before eating here.

2006-12-02,4.0,"Ravenswood seems ripe with hole-in-the-wall restaurants that mask the hidden jewel within, and this is no different.  Forget the rest of their filthy food, walk in right now, and demand Tiramisu. To be a little more serious, the food is nothing less than succulent, as long as you order the right thing.  It seems like every day they have a different special or five, and each one of them sounds like some obscure delicacy.  I was never let down by their handmade portobello mushroom ravioli in bolognese, or any of their chicken dishes, but I was sadly disappointed by the shrimp risotto. Sadly enough, they are also located next to an obnoxiously stinky and rarely emptied dumpster half a block down next to the L track, and sometimes you can actually smell it in the establishment.  Considering the quality of the food here, this is a great disservice that can detract from an otherwise exquisite meal.  Take my advice here: if you can smell it outside, it may be a problem inside as well.  This only happened one of the times I went, so my warning may be unnecessary. But the real shining jewel here is the Tiramisu.  They are family owned and operated, and the person waiting your table may have contributed somehow to your meal, so keep that in mind.  More than once, our waiter was the resident Tiramisu chef, and he's so modest about that fact, it's hard to believe how shockingly divine it tastes.  This is something you'll want to eat slowly, and enjoy every second.  The rest of the food, no matter how delectable, doesn't exist so far as I'm concerned so long as I can order plates of this dessert.  If you do nothing else, treat yourself to this. It's really a shame they're between the Damen and Montrose brown-line stops.  It's a really out of the way location for a surprisingly good bite to eat.",-0.607,0.74,0.123,0.137,0.512390873015873

Alright, I'll be honest--I've only actually been to Caro Mio once... but I LOVED it.  Maria C. and Dustin B. were kind enough to share this little neighborhood gem with Justin and me and I am so looking forward to our next trip there (hint hint, nudge nudge).   Caro Mio is BYOB, which is all sorts of stars on its own, but it's the combination of super friendly service and excellent food that pushes Caro Mio to the top.  Our server was awesome and happy to make suggestions--and we were very happy to take his advice.  We skipped all the appetizers and salads (sort of unusual for us, but really--the handmade pasta is where it's at).  My husband left me for a dish of risotto, I cheated on him with a plate of agnelotti rossini (half moon pasta filled with ricotta in a creamy tomato sauce with peas and prosciutto - DIVINE), Maria enjoyed her old standby of cavatelli con ricotta and Dustin had something with pumpkin, I believe (maybe more risotto?).  For dessert, our server gave us The Bombe - three kinds of sorbet in a white chocolate shell--and I am looking forward to trying the chocolate tartufo (chocolate gelato with a zabaglione center, dusted with cocoa powder and hazelnuts - yum!).  Everything at Caro Mio was fantastic and now, having written about my agnelotti, I will be completely unproductive at work due to pasta daydreams and much drooling... *Edit 8/31/07:  Ohhh, I've been back to Caro Mio a few times and let me tell you--that chocolate tartufo?  Get it.  GET IT.  And if you like lasagna, get that, too.  And some gnocchi.  Hell, get whatever they tell you to--it's gonna be damn good!!",0.9974,0.745,0.211,0.044,0.5275148809523809
