Just due to the fact that when you first walk in it's incredibly dark. But once you enter the restaurant there is more lighting.. However the restaurant has a darker ambience with in general. The food was spectacular, the service was amazing and the environment was casual. We were able to eat our food in peace without the constant annoyance of a server asking if we are good.  It's not a huge menu compared to other restaurants, but a great selection nonetheless. You have some interesting flavor combinations on some of the choices, with a spin on some classics with others. Not one thing that we ordered was bad!  The draft and whiskey selection is a nice touch. Lots to choose from.

I have heard from a friend that the fish tacos are incredible, so I will try those soon. The beers are pretty standard price, the selection is large, and the atmosphere is pretty nice.

2016-04-24,2.0,"I went to Rocking horse last night for a friends small gathering. First time I've ever been there drink selection was great and from what I saw the food did look amazing. It was a busier evening due to the Hawks game but this is normal for any establishment. I'm only giving two stars because half of the service was pretty horrible. There were two bartenders working one guy and one girl, I had the unpleasant experience of having the girl serve my wife and I our first few drinks...  Upon walking up to the bar she was much more interested in serving the patrons on the furthest side of the bar, whom she was in a very fun conversation with. I enjoy seeing this it helps show the bar is a pleasant place, so I politely waited then she eventually saw my wife and I. I figured maybe is just busy and it was a one off situation. My wife and I played some pool I returned to the bar for a few more drinks, same scenario was playing itself out... Male bartender rapidly making drinks, socializing with his patrons, bar back working, female bartender leaning against back bar and conversing.... Eventually she saw me again and strolled over and I ordered my drink. I walked back and asked my group if they were experiencing the same service and it was a mutual feeling of lack luster service between 6 people at 7 individual points of drink ordering...   Third round... I returned to the bar to order, this time I went to the center of the bar, to easily be seen and possibly help get my order faster... The initial patrons in bartenders earlier conversation have now left, the bartender was now speaking with a couple I was standing next to. Mid conversation she spun in a circle with middle fingers up then laughingly asked what I needed... I was taken back at this moment, I didn't think any gesture was directed at me but rather to the conversation she was having with the woman. I got my drink and walked away.  For my last drink, i returned to the bar and was immediately approached by the male bartender, quick approach, polite and gave a sense of what you would expect from a bartender in the service industry. I got my drink in record time from that bartender and I felt inclined to order another one from him. As I returned to my friends the female bartender was delivering an order of tots to another person in our group, as she placed the tots on the table she rudely threw the napkins on the table in two spots as if it was intending to be insulting... A friend asked her politely if she could please have some sauce for the tots and her reply was ""Look I'm just the bartender!"" My friend apologized and asked if we should speak to someone else whom could take our order, bartender replied ""you can order at the bar"" then walked away. At this point we were all confused and realized we were not wrong, this woman is terrible at her job and is possibly one of the rudest people in the service industry. Shockingly she returned with the sauce, our group was stunned.  We finished our drinks and tots and had zero votes to stay here...  Hopefully the management of Rocking Horse can identify the strengths and weaknesses in their bartending staff.  #undercoverboss",0.993,0.814,0.13,0.056,0.4228703703703704

Interesting and differently done burgers (and chicken sandwich) options as well. My cuzzo got the gyro burger, which had a gyro/beefy mix for a patty. Shesaid it was good. Really, I like that it's simple food, but done right. And not crazy greasy or stupid fatty. Thumbs up, for catering to your clientele.

Definitely an underrated spot to grab grub.  I don't like the layout here though.

Definitely an eclectic group.  Beer- They have a great selection and the Thursday special above the bar would make me come back.  Food - I only ordered appetizers but what I had and what I saw for the rest of our group was delicious! Great portion sizes too. I ordered the Quesadillas and Tater tots to split with my friend. Here we thought they would be small and bite sized.....nope, she ended up taking her other peice home. Along with Tater Tots. Be prepared to eat!  So here are the downsides:  Noise Level - If you like to scream and lean in for any kind of conversation, you have found your hang out. Our group of five sat in a booth by the window. I couldn't hear anything the other four friends of mine were talking about, which definitely made for an awkward setting.  Parking - Logan Square is starting to become a pretty happening place. So street parking can be difficult. (I'm surprised the Megamall across the street doesn't work out a deal where it can be used by the local business at night. Is that thing even open anyway?????)  I'm fairly new to the Rocking Horse, so I was not aware that they couldn't split the check amongst 3 cards. Our waitress had informed us she can only split it twice, then felt the need to add ""we have it all over our menu and receipt."" That last part could have been left out, because it sounded like a snotty remark. The ""wording"" she was referring to was at the bottom of the menu and the bottom of the receipt in small writing. I'm sorry, but I don't look at the very bottom of a menu. My eyes stop reading once I see the border under the last set of food items. And the receipt? My only concern is the total.

This entre came with a whopping 3 sausage patties, toast, and lots of potatoes! Delish! Take some home for later!  PULLED PORK BENEDICT: Who would have thought pulled pork would go great atop an english muffin, under an egg, and covered covered with chipotle hollandaise sauce! So acquired to have the regular pulled pork sandwich smothered in bbq sauce this was a delightful twist into a brunch item! Also came with potatoes!   REGULAR TATER TOTS W/ A TURKEY APPLE SANDWICH: This sandwich is served warm. All the ingredients compliment each other so well; smoked turkey, bacon, gouda, sauteed apples, and roasted garlic aioli! Side of tots and it's nom nom nom! Nuff said!  Overall, it's wonderful to find such an energetic Sunday brunch spot! I love hearing M.I.A and Vampire Weekend blaring throughout the eatery!

2013-02-26,2.0,"The food has been awesome every time I go but the wait staff does a disservice to the chefs. I had a small issue with service a couple months ago but the bartender recovered from it and ended up being a nice guy. I wish I could say the same thing for my server Katie two nights ago. I ordered a beer, they came out and served my girlfriend her beer and told me they had to go in ""the back"" to find mine. A few minutes later and Katie informed me that they had no more of the beer I ordered. No sweat, I asked for a minute to look over the beer menu again. So after taking a couple minutes to look it over I turned to see where the server was so that I might flag her down (there were only 4 tables seated in the restaurant). Unfortunately she had her backed turned to me and was showing the bartender and other server there videos on her cellphone. After waiting another couple minutes she finally turned and realized I was waiting and came to get my order. I asked her about what the Unibroue Ephemere was like and her answer was, ""Oh, uh it's a belgian so um smooth and sweet, you know beer tasting. It's kind of hard to describe the flavor..."" I was extremely upset, their beer menu has no descriptions so I don't believe it's unreasonable for me to want to know a beer style. It was under the Belgian and Saison section so I kind of figured out the Belgian part of it on my own. The fact that she actually said ""beer tasting"" condescendingly to me like I was stupid for asking the question had me sincerely angry. The real kicker is that after a little research at home I found out that the Ephemere is a fruit beer that features apple (I don't like apple tasting beers so I would have been really angry if I had ordered it without her telling me that) I ended up ordering a different beer immediately to get her away from the table before I said something I would regret. To make the matter even worse when she finally came back with my beer they had somehow found the beer I had originally ordered in the first place. It was very unprofessional. After that I had an Ahi Tuna Club that was to die for. That's why it hurts me so bad to give this place a mediocre review. I feel like the place should always be packed based on just how good the burgers are alone. Somebody takes a lot of care in crafting great food and a server makes me so irritated I can hardly enjoy my meal.

Shots are expensive here.  Anything with ""bomb"" on the end cost around $9.  Our total check at the end of the night was $169 for a group of 4.  This included at LEAST 3 appetizers, 12 beers (probably more), and about 7 shots. Service was great.  Our waitress was friendly and attentive, even with a nearly full bar to serve.   The crowd here isn't too rowdy, even for NYE.  It was exactly what we needed that night:  something that wouldn't break the bank, and a bar with good food and drinks.  The music is crowd controlled by a jukebox, so we listened to some unusual tunes for awhile - growly, roaring, almost metal stuff.  A friend remarked that he recognized only 5 or so albums in the jukebox:  The Clash, Flaming Lips, and he couldn't remember the others. Getting a taxicab on the way home was much easier than expected.  Don't hang out in front of the bar, though, it is easier to catch a taxi closer to the next traffic light, about a half block away.

The food is good.  I am a particular fan of the sliders and tater tots.  I just never feel quite comfortable there.  I've seen people come in, sit down and not order anything for 15 minutes or more, or have 1 person take up a table for 4 to have a beer or two.  It's peculiar at best.  And I would never go there just to drink, it just doesn't fit. So, it's got good food, a good beer selection and an identity crisis which does more damage than you'd imagine.  I could see it being good for lunch, which I haven't done yet, but later in the evening I don't know what to do with it.",0.9536,0.733,0.173,0.095,0.44527588813303093

Here's the thing: at Rocking Horse, the food is good and interesting, you don't have to fight your way in and the people seem normal Logan Square kind of people. At Revolution Brewing on the other hand, I spent 20 minutes listening to some dude explain that he got a Joy Division tattoo on his arm because the band is such a huge part of his life. Even though the kid was 25, and therefore in the Venn diagram of Joy Division's life and his own, there is no intersecting circle. Ok, enough of that.

Well, I don't think I've ever had such bad experiences with food and service like this before, but I gotta say the beer menu is fantastic. To start the night, the doorman was friendly--and that makes me happy, because almost any place that has a doorman checking IDs, he's usually miserable, cranky, or just plain rude. Anyway, my friend and I decided to start the night with the Goat Cheese balls appetizer.

So, the waitress came back and she brought the remaining four goat cheese balls back to the kitchen. The same four cheese-balls returned to us about two minutes later. I bit into mine--still frozen. Their microwave must not be very powerful. Instead of sending them back again, my friend and I just avoided making a big deal out of it and left the remaining appetizer at the edge of the table. I ordered the black and blue mini-burgers. A few minutes later, my friend and I got our food. I received three McDonalds-thin patties with semi-melted American cheese on top. After my food was sent back once more, I received the correct mini burgers. They were ok. Again, the meat seemed very processed, as if the patties had been delivered by some fast food chain, and even though they were ""mini,"" the meat patties were the same size as a normal burger, but they sat on tiny buns. So that was kind of weird. Near the end of the night, our waitress gave us our bill, but never returned to collect it. After about 20 minutes, my friend called out to her and she approached in a hurry, saying she completely forgot we were still there. So, really, come here for drinks only.

We ordered drinks and an assortment of appetizers: nothing difficult, just tater tots, fries, etc. At around 11:45, one of my friends asked our waitress about our food, and she assured us it would just be a few more minutes. At midnight, I went up to the bar and asked to speak to a manager. A few minutes later, our waitress came back and told us that our drinks were on her. We said that we didn't need free drinks, we just wanted our tater tots. The manager came by a few minutes later and was extremely rude. He told us that we had only put in our order at 11:50. I said that maybe our waitress put in our order at 11:50, but we ordered at 11pm. He just kept saying that our order was put in at 11:50.

Instead, we were told that we were lying about our experience and that a comped drink should make up for an hour without tater tots. We stopped at the rocking horse to get a drink and a bite to eat on the way home. Instead, we went home and ate pizza rolls. In retrospect, we should have just gone with the pizza rolls in the first place.",-0.8016,0.888,0.045,0.067,0.3993506493506494

Don't get me wrong - great food - just not one of those places where they are trying to go all Food Network faux gourmet. The food manages to be unique and high quality without being pretentious. Solid burgers. Love the pulled pork sandwich - lotsa good flavor and a bit spicier than you'd think. The Ranch Fries are great as are the Poutine Fries (fries covered in brown gravy and cheese - hey arteries! Fuck you!) The beer selection is great - not huge like Quenchers or the Map Room but very well selected. They keep a pretty fresh rotation of beers on tap - I come here about once a week and there's always a few new varieties available each week. I always sit at the bar and have never had service issues. The bartenders are usually pretty friendly. The music is usually decent.

Well, we came here instead of Estrella Negra after being told of their unreasonable 1hr wait.  Good choice!  There was a wait here as well, but it was more along the lines of a reasonable 20 minutes.  Plus there is a bar where you could get your choice of many beers.  I got a tasty Dogfish Head. I have a feeling that if I wasn't drinking beer that night, the bartenders still could have made me some tasty drinks. Food:  Appetizers (shared between 4) Fried Green Tomatoes:  Well cooked, perfect texture and topped with a balsamic reduction and goat cheese.  A nice change from the remoulade I am used to coming with Fried Green Tomatoes.  Plus, the texture of the breading was very fine- it's a welcome surprise to the gritty cornmeal I am used to coating the tomatoes. Everyone loved this.  It was a good size and easily shareable. Kim and Scott's Pretzel basket:  I love Kim and Scott's Pretzels to start off with.  Great people, great local company, and great pretzels!  I was so happy when I saw them on the menu.  I thought they were a little on the cold side, but it could have been due to me devouring the tomato first.  I thought the mustard that was on the side was a bit typical, especially since it was the only condiment to the appetizer.  Not to sound picky, but I think a spicy Dijon would have been perfect.  None the less, everyone was happy. Dinner: Mediterranean Wrap w/ Chimmichuri fries (shared with someone):  We asked for the chicken on the side (for my sake), and they obliged.   As an aside, there was alot of chicken for that sandwich!  The sandwich wasn't  groundbreaking, but it was pretty good.  The fries could have used less oil, I was expecting more flavor out of them.  I think it is pretty cool that they have alot of different ways to flavor up your fries.  I don't like fries on their own, so I was really pleased to see how many options I had to jazz them up. How can you make it better?  Expand your dessert selection.  Not to say that you need dessert after the good portion sizes but it needs more than the one item on the menu.  Get some Kim and Scott's dessert pretzels!  Start and end your meal with one!  Just expand that menu!",0.9989,0.739,0.248,0.013,0.6651041666666667

My boyfriend and I stopped in on a Thursday night and the place was nearly empty-we were seated right away.  They have a very impressive beer list, I enjoyed some banana bread beer to start things off along with their Pretzel Basket-1 grilled cheese, 1 jalapeno cheddar, and 1 plain pretzel with a side of spicy mustard.  My fav was the jalapeno cheddar but they were all good-we took half of one home and ate it the next day and it was just as good reheated in the oven. Choosing what to order next from all the delicious sounding menu choices was tough, but my boyfriend settled on the Prime Ribeye Steak sandwich and I went with the Smoked Turkey and Apple sandwich and we were both very happy with our choices.  The steak was cooked medium rare, just as requested, and was very good.  My turkey sandwich was AMAZING-I've had a few daydreams about it over the past couple weeks.  Smoked turkey, bacon, gouda, sauteed apples, and roasted garlic aioli on ciabatta bread...I didn't want it to ever end.   We also had the cajun fries and the Greek fries...yum and yum.  The Greek fries are a little soggy because of the lemon juice but I loved them all the same-tons of feta piled high, you could make a meal out of those alone.  The cajun fries were really really good too...lots of seasoning, pretty salty-just how I like 'em.  Rocking Horse isn't exactly in our 'hood but totally worth the short drive-we'll definitely be back for more!",0.9939,0.822,0.157,0.021,0.4910267857142857

We showed up and got a table right away but after our drink order we did not get our beers for 10 minutes.  This seemed to be directly related to that there was only one waitress taking food and drink orders for the whole dining room.  Short staffed? I know a bunch of people who would like a job.... While taking our food order our waitress thought she heard my brother say pulled pork sandwich when he said pulled pork quesadilla and heard my side of buffalo sauce as side of barbecue (which I had to pay .50 for 1oz?).  Now I understand that these are not big issues, but I think they could be avoided if the music was not so loud and that everyone in the whole place did not have to yell to each other to talk.   Lastly the food.  My buffalo chicken sandwich came on a nice hoagie type roll which I enjoyed, but it came with only enough fixings (tomato, lettuce, onion, pickle) for one half of it. So one half was eaten plain.  The pulled pork quesadilla on the other hand was almost inedible due to the amount of salt in it.  I understand bar food being salty to go along with the beer, but this was overkill. Overall I would say that it seems to be a good neighborhood spot to get some drinks, but the service and food quality was hit and miss.",0.9732,0.891,0.089,0.02,0.4963435374149659

Cannot wait to try their pulled bbq pork if it has the same sauce on it. The grilled red onion was just the right touch with the thick slab bacon to balance the flavors. The tuna......omg.

Creamy, warm, and they give both chips and bread for dipping. YUM! I had the turkey club.....another good choice. The bread was grilled panini style, and the bacon was thick with just the right amount of salt. It's served with a side of fries....mega size! Great beer and whiskey selection too.

We placed our drink orders and mused over the menu.

If Jim Morrison were living in Logan Square today, he'd never have far to go.  Whether wandering out of Longman and Eagle, or RevBrew, or Helen's, the Rocking Horse is easy stumbling distance.

The food here is fine but not outstanding - standard bar fare, primarily sandwiches and lots of fried food options.   While the Italian wedding soup was excellent, but the chicken parmesan sandwich was lacking in marinara, and the chicken breast was too thin - more breading than chicken.  But at the same time, its what you would expect for bar food.   While I wouldn't come back for the food, I would definitely hit the Rocking Horse again for drinks before or after dinner at Longman, Lula's, or RevBrew.",0.9879,0.869,0.121,0.009,0.4916111111111111

I'm SO happy I did.  Rocking Horse has an absolutely stellar bar menu AND delicious beers on tap AND inoffensively priced mixed drinks.

They're ranch flavored and therefore add a cool bit of bite to your regularly scheduled tot-fest and 2. They're SUPER ranch flavored, so you can only eat a few of them before ranch overload sets in.  You won't totally kill your diet. Also on deck were the buffalo chicken strips and the Santa Fe egg rolls.  The chicken was a pretty hearty portion with a nice, spicy buffalo sauce and the Santa Fe egg rolls were spicy perfection.   While I only dove into the appetizer menu, I was floored to see a truckload of salads and some really interesting sandwich options on the backside of the menu.  I cannot wait to get my mouth around an ahi tuna club (wasabi is so my bitch), a portabello feta wrap and a Mediterranean wrap.  They look amazing.

So the draft beer selection was decent and the specials were fair, but there just wasn't that special something to make me fall in love with it or to go back any time soon.  They also had the IFC channel on and there was a very graphic movie playing and it was really distracting for me to talk to the table because I couldn't take my eyes off the screen.  I feel it was an odd choice of channels for a bar.",0.9594,0.767,0.15,0.083,0.48373809523809524

It was pretty damn smooth so that lead to at least a few more shots which then lead to us  calling it the Stabin Cabin because we were getting screwed up.

The top two businesses on Yelp Chicago are Revolution Brewing and Longman & Eagle (most bookmarked). Within stumbling distance is Coles, another great bar. Add to that the Rocking Horse.   I came to Rocking Horse for brunch last Sunday and found the food, beer, and service to be above average. Hell, I'm gonna say the food was pretty damn delicious. The bar is dark but not at all dungeon-like. I really appreciate the clearly written drink specials above the bar. There is a sign for each day of the week written in large black type on a white background-- making it visible from anywhere in the bar and easy to decipher if you're already a little tipsy. There is a small room in the back with a pool table, photo booth, and Pac Man.   OK so maybe the addition of Rocking Horse doesn't elevate Logan Square to 'best 'hood eva'. I still like it, so there.

2010-03-05,3.0,"Like many junkies before me, I just can't quit ""The Horse."" I was first lured into this den of sin and temptation by a gateway drug, its sister bar High Dive in Ukrainian Village.  Being a regular there, when I heard the owners were giving me a fix closer to home (way too close to home as I pass it on the way to the train every day) I was euphoric.  Or ecstatic.  Without that other drug, I mean.   My first time with ""The Horse,"" however, was less than stellar.  It was at a (birthday) party.  The bar was dark, crowded, and relatively expensive (though with a really nice beer menu).  Plus the large tables near the windows (which anyone can see inside from Milwaukee Avenue using) being elevated also made for an awkward feeling.  I guess I just didn't like being that high. Then, as I was passing one morning, there was a sign (though, sadly, it wasn't ""the first one is free""). The sign told me that word on the street was that ""The Horse"" was now serving brunch (another addiction).  It took me a while but I finally got my first fix with my brunching buddies in January.  And, just like High Dive, the second I put one of their potatoes into my bloodstream (by way of my mouth), it was pure bliss.  Their seasoned breakfast potatoes are to die for (but, not of - well at least not from overdose)!  Almost as good as High Dive's tots!   And they can be ordered as a side to any breakfast. Their brunch menu is pretty immense and diverse.  The breakfast burrito (the plate by which all others shall be judged in my mind) is average and sort of small but most of their portions are large and with the side of the potatoes (did I mention those, yet?) are more than filling.  Especially when washed down by a refreshing mid-morning cocktail.  They have bloody marys and mimosas for $5, but are currently lacking a bottomless special.  Though unlike brunch places, they do put on sports with the volume up above the bar (have to feed all my addictions at once). The lack of a bottomless deal is sort of sad as they are really missing their calling.  Rocking Horse at night is filled with the same scene making hipsters as so many other northeastern Logan Square bars.  But in the morning, while the pale ones are asleep, Logan Square really does come alive in this place (they even allow kids).  If they were to feed my brunch addiction fully, I would be visiting them ""on the corner"" almost every week.",0.6993,0.854,0.079,0.067,0.5126839881251645

They have an excellent beer selection at typical prices.  Today, my wife, her cousin and I went for brunch.  I don't like eggs so I decided to go with the Turkey Club.  Big mistake.  When our food came out, after a suspiciously long wait, I ate a fry.  The french fry was my first indication that something had gone awry.  These fries had obviously been sitting around for ten or fifteen minutes.  They were basically stale, salty sticks.  The sandwich was definitely not as advertised.  The menu described it as a pannini.  If you consider a Turkey Club on toasted white bread a pannini, then yeah, I guess it was a pannini.  My sandwich eating experience has informed that a pannini is a grilled sandwich.  Not one that merely has toasted bread.  Get a panini maker if you want to call it a pannini. They are very affordable. The ingredients in the sandwich were all cold as a fridge.  This is not panini-like AT ALL.   To make matters worse, this sandwich had been sitting as long as my fries had.  You know how your mouth can get all scratched up from eating over-toasted bread?  That's how mine is right now. You might be asking yourself, ""Why didn't he just send it back""?  Well, it is because our waitress, whom the bill identified as ""Victoria"", never came back to ask how our food was or if we needed anything else.  After I had given up on eating she did come by and mumbled something about getting me another beer.  I declined.  When it came time to bring us the check, she had the other waitress take care of it.  I can only imagine that she was as ashamed of the quality of the food and service as I was to have eaten there.

When hubby recommended it for brunch, I was a little skeptical because I didn't think it was the brunch atmosphere I was looking for, but the food more than makes up for it.

Let me start off by saying, I live 2 blocks away, up Milwaukee, so for me, this is the closest, and nicest bar around, besides El Cid, and I'm not as much of a fan. I have been here twice in a week, just to put it in perspective.  The service has been excellent and friendly. The decor is fashionably of last season and dark. They are trying to go for that comfortable, upscale pub, with black tables, red curtains and dark walls. But I'm not sure if it is working. Maybe if they brought the lighting down, closer to the tables to accent, it would feel more like a speakeasy, which is what I think they are kinda going for. I do have to say that the bathrooms are exceptionally clean and  the place is never fully crowded. Its always easy to get a seat. Oh, and they have a pool table in back, that seems to have a monopoly on it at all times. One problem, besides the lighting, is that they play the music too damn loud for a place that serves pub food. Its not a club, its a pub. I shouldn't have to scream across to my companion.  Unless this is  ploy to buy more drinks.  The beer selection is decent but they need to get some better ciders. They offer 2, but they are too sweet to be called anything other than fruit juice. And the $4 Jameson shots on Wednesday, while a good ploy, should actually be full shots, not medicinal sized 2 tbsp shot glasses. I will come back, yes, if only for the chips and salsa(which was definitely good) and the proximity to my house. Its reasonably priced and open late.

I went on opening night, and the place was just packed and loud as hell, so I thought that wasn't really a fair assessment of the place. Went back a couple weeks later on a weeknight. And the experience was much better, but not all that great. The place is still loud and echo-ey, even with just a handful of people. The acoustics of this big open space and the jukebox volume force everyone to talk way louder than they need to. And it can be kind of annoying. Maybe ok on a weekend, but on a slow weeknight when you just want to sit and talk over a drink and food, not so much. The place is also really dark, due to black walls, dark furniture and incidental lighting. You can't really even get a good estimation of the decor.

As it is, I spent $25 on chicken wings I didn't finish, a few beers I wasn't that impressed with, and a noise level more acceptable at a club than an open area restaurant and bar.  I'm assuming the point of this place is to attract all the young hipsters in the neighborhood who are more than willing to spend far too much money on food and alcohol than they should. The reason I make this leap of judgment is because the lighting is dim, and yet the only decorations on the walls are mirrors, so that all the young fashionistas can admire themselves while eating. After all they need something to do since they can't hear anyone else with the music volume in here after 10pm. No seriously. The sound level was fine and then somewhere between 10 and 10:30 they pumped up the volume (and not in an awesome Christian Slater way either) to the point of annoyance.  In fact, no one was impressed with their food, save the one shimmering foodie goodness (which is the reason they get 3 instead of 1 star) knows as Poutine. By the gods this potato/cheese/gravy concoction is a work of genius. We didn't just eat it, we devoured it. It was good enough to up the review two whole stars. I am not kidding. I would actually come here again (early in the evening next time...thank you) just for this dish.  Also, the waitress was nice, the bathrooms clean, the door-guy pleasant, and the seating arrangements well thought out. There...I said some other positive things.

The ambiance is really chic on the inside, I just hope they don't let it get to their heads and jack up the prices. I had the Black & Bleu Burger.  Nothing to write home about, but alright.  I opted for the Ranch Fries, which didn't really have much flavor.  I will try the Cajun ones next time.  Hopefully those will be a little more flavorful than regular fries.",0.8572,0.877,0.123,0.0,0.3622960372960374

2009-08-29,3.0,"Went to The Rocking Horse a couple weeks ago because, like everyone else, we were ecstatic a new place opened up on the square.  Its ok. The decor is really nice and everything is sparkly and new. They have a good beer selection which is great for my wife and the food is decent. But I do not like beer. I'm more of a martini drinker so I asked the waitress what martinis they had, if any. She had no idea. Okay fine, new place whatever. She told me they could probably make me whatever I wanted so I daringly asked for a pomegranite martini. She looked at me like ""yeah right"" so I said ""ok give me an apple martini."" She went back to the bar and awhile came back and said that they couldn't do apple, but they could do cosmo, lemon drop, or a 3rd option I can't remember. I told her to get me a cosmo. About 5 minutes later this guy (I'm assuming the manager) came over with an apple martini saying that they didn't think they had it but he ""found some in the back."" Um ... what? You ""found"" it? I had suspicions that this was probably from a mix and when I tasted it I was pretty sure that was the case. It tasted very much like a low quality appletini. My wife tasted it and said it was awful. And on the bill it was quoted as ""well vodka"" with a ""martini"" upgrade. You DO NOT make a martini with well vodka. I will never get a martini there again thats for sure. I did have a raspberry stoli and lemonade as well and that was fine, but not exactly difficult to make.  The other thing I didn't really like was that the waitress said that I couldn't get the fries that came with my burger upgraded. I rarely want to get fries for an appetizer since they come with burgers and whatnot, but I really wanted to try their poutine fries. I was totally willing to pay for the upcharge and it should totally be doable. I really hope they work that kink out and realize they can make more money by offering such an upgrade. So instead I got tatertots and they were pretty bland. I was disappointed in them.  The night we went there they were having a $6 burger and fries special. That's cool I like specials, but this was only a barebones burger. If you wanted anything on it they would charge you more or if you wanted one of their specialty burgers you are charged full price. So it really didn't feel like much of a special.  And, as other's have said, this place is noisy.  I'm sure we'll go back since its close and their food is decent, but I doubt we'll be spending much time or money there. We actually left earlier than we had expected to and went down the street to The Whistler where for 50 cents more than that awful martini I could get a tasty handcrafted drink.",0.9905,0.789,0.146,0.065,0.5191862502576788
2009-08-28,4.0,"Checked out Rocking Horse for dinner earlier this week and am pleased to report that some of the initial service issues a few people mentioned seem to have been ironed out.  Our server was attentive and friendly, and all our food came out pretty quickly. We had a plate of tater tots as an appetizer, but just got the plain ones (they also offer ranch or cajun, I believe).  The tots were good - came out hot, not under- or over-salted, just yummy.  They actually had a pretty extensive list of appetizers that sounded great, but it seemed best to start off with something safe.  Still, I would go back just to try some of the other options. I had a burger, my friend had the Ahi tuna club.  My burger was good - nothing exceptional, but certainly good enough to be ordered again.  The tuna club was a little disappointing.  The advertised avocado was like a light smear of avocado on the bread.  Very light.  As someone who likes avocado, my friend was pretty disappointed on that front, but the rest of the sandwich was pretty tasty. Rocking Horse also has a very nice beer list that I am looking forward to delving into.   Rocking Horse is definitely a good addition to Logan Square.  It's a little less pricey than Dunlay's, but the food is just as good and it's definitely got better food than Logan Bar & Grill.  Welcome to the neighborhood, Rocking Horse!",0.9979,0.654,0.301,0.045,0.59453007518797

The interior is nice and new with lots of booths and tables to sit. It's pretty blank, though. No theme. One rocking horse on one wall. There are 2 TVs but not that big and not taking over the decor like a sports bar. The food menu was big - 2 pages. We got a trio of pretzels for an appetizer. They were very tasty. Dallas really liked the ahi tuna club he ordered. I got a buffalo chicken wrap. It was good, but too spicy for me. Also the sauce to chicken ratio was kind of high. Too saucy.

Almost too nice, given the lovely neighbor, The Milshire, and across from Mega Mall. Kinda expected a little more of an edgy vibe, but it's just so new. It's also pretty big with a large open space. More of a restaurant feel than bar, due to lots of tables: large booths along the walls/windows, 4-6 regular tables, plus another 6-8 high tops. Estimates, mind you. We were sitting at the bar, where many folks started, but it filled up pretty well after 7-8. The bathrooms were sparkling and nice. The discovery of the 'private' game room, with pool table, photo booth and PINBALL was great, that could be a fun time to take over with a group. Not a huge menu, mostly apps, sandwiches/wraps, some less-than inspiring salads, burgers, tacos, etc. We split chorizo wontons (decent) and the Ahi Tuna club (awesome).

There is an excellent beer selection with most pints going for $4.50, which I would say is below the average price.  The menu had lots of options, including a few that were veggie.

The menu is really big, and we decided to order just appetizers--poutine (read about in the Red Eye), spinach/feta won tons, and black and blue sliders.  Perhaps it was a function of the place being new and wanting to impress, but all were fantastic and arrived at our table piping hot., with special praise going to the won tons.

This bar is quite welcome to me in the Logan Square neighbourhood. Dunlay's is alright, but it's a little more yuppie for my taste. I like the dark black and red interior of Rocking Horse, and the soft leather/pleather (I don't know which) booths are casual yet solid. There is a whole game room with a pinball game, photobooth and pool table, which, unfortunately for me, was occupied the whole time. Since the bar just opened, I'll cut the server some slack for not knowing the whole draft/bottle list. The bar will add more beers to their offerings over the next few weeks or so as well. I did not try the food yet (other than a few tater tots), but there are several vegan (-able) dishes: portabella sandwiches/wraps, veggie burgers, jalapeño hummus, guacamole and salsa, french fries and tater tots to name a few. The acoustics were kind of poor. Everyone's conversation bounced off the shut windows and smooth walls/ceilings.
