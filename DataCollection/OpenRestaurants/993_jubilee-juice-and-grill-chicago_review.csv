It's always clean and smells like delicious smoothies. I've tried almost all of the smoothies and they're all fantastic. Although they seem a bit expensive at $6-7 (I'm a broke college student) it is worth every penny.

I am happy to tell you that, if you order that chicken sandwich from Jubilee Juice, you are wrong. This place changed my expectations for a grilled chicken sandwich.

I've ordered the Jubilee Chicken Sandwich with Waffle Fries several times and sometimes I order the Caesar Chicken Salad. I always call my orders in and arrive 20-25 min after that because they are slow. After today I won't be going back. I called my order in and they tell me it will be ready in 10min, which is never true with them. I get there 25 min after placing my order (it wasn't busy at the time). I paid, and walked to end of the counter expecting to get my bag-o-food. But the taller Eastern European girl there was just dropping my fries in the oil. When I asked her why my food isn't ready she lazily told me so that my fries are hot when I pick up. I then tell her the point of ordering in advance is so I don't have to wait when I get there and I don't have time to wait. Otherwise I would have just walked down there and placed my order in person. After listening to her excuses for a couple of minutes she rolled her eyes at me after I told her I expect my order to be ready on arrival. That's when I demanded my money back, which I got, and walked out.  This place is not worth the hassle. Their customer service is terrible.",-0.1894,0.911,0.041,0.048,0.4818713450292396

Actually, the two really have nothing to do with one another, but their titles kinda sound similar, and I'd never waste a somewhat relevant opportunity to add a creepy Zoobilee Zoo clip to a review.  All joking aside though, the place is great for more than just smoothies. The menu is way larger than you'd expect and the food was very legit. The Jubilee chicken sandwich was totally tasty, and I love the fact that instead of fries you can get several other options on the side such as steamed veggies, spinach pie, or marinated asparagus. Makes it much easier to eat healthy in these summer months.  Overall it's a tad pricey, but I really don't mind paying a little more for healthy alternatives that are delicious. Go. Enjoy, and without fear of those creepy characters from the clip.",0.9937,0.752,0.241,0.007,0.5154301075268817

My meat eating friends have said that their other sandwiches are also good. All sandwich orders can be upgraded to a combo meal with a fountain drink and (yep, you guessed it) waffle fries or a smoothie and waffle fries for an additional charge. The smoothies and juices are freshly made and delish.  A bit of warning, all food is made to order so sometimes there is a bit of a wait. This is especially true around lunch time.

I definitely feel the portions at this place are just way to big. Maybe that's why it's so expensive. I also took off a star because the eating area is so cramped. People on top of people. I'd rather eat in my car.,0.9723,0.785,0.199,0.016,0.5388392857142857
2007-06-19,4.0,"My office orders delivery from here for lunch at least once a week, and we've been doing that for over a year now.  Consistently good food, always speedy delivery.  Salads are huge, and like jesca c. says below, the grilled chicken is fantastic.  I would've given it 5 stars, but for a lunch joint it's a bit overpriced when you factor in the delivery charge plus tip.",0.6858,0.882,0.118,0.0,0.7499999999999999
2007-06-18,4.0,A nice place that totally doesn't feel like overly clinical chains.  All I had was the lemonade which was excellent and freshly squeezed.  Can't say much else from my limited experience but it was a good place to cool off on a muggy day!,0.8483,0.701,0.234,0.065,0.626984126984127

2007-05-09,4.0,"One of our regular places for lunch --  - cheap (fairly) - healthy - deliver - tasty!!! I got so sick of the same old carry out.  Jubilee has a great amount of Veggie options such as : Goat cheese Asparagus sandwich, Roasted vegetables, a nice veggie burger, and my favorite 2 salads ever -  The Jubilee (blue cheese, walnuts, pears, raspberry vinegerette)  AND  The BBQ Baja Salad (avocado, black beans, corn, and a slightly spicy bbq dressing) Also ** They have fresh juice and wheat grass!!** This has saved me on tired, weak days at work... -Forget the coffee -Plug your nose -And shoot a double shot of wheat grass.. -You'll feel like a million bucks! My only complaints:  The salads are amazing, but you have to share them..there is literally enough lettuce to feed a rabbit farm...A  smaller salad option would be nice.  The women on the phone can be a bit snappy and rude. But who cares really, I'm just so happy it's near me for  lunch!!",0.9626,0.732,0.184,0.084,0.5513102282333052

Their waffle fries are awesome, their chocolate chip cookies are outstanding, their smoothies are killer... but their chicken sandwiches take the cake. The chicken breasts they use are HUGE (almost scary) and they do something with marinade that seals the deal. There is NOT a better chicken sandwhich in the city. There just isn't. Stop looking.

2006-06-24,5.0,"I can live on grilled chicken sandwiches, and Jubilee's are the best I've ever had, by a wide margin.  The portion is huge, their ""secret marinade"" is delicious and sets them apart from anywhere else, and when you can get your choice of everything from field greens, goat cheese, or bacon on it, perfection becomes possible.  You can also get their famous grilled chicken (or other sandwich options like strip steak, ahi tuna, or halibut) as toppings on fresh, crisp salads.  If I'm getting something to eat, I get plain juice.  Fresh-squeezed orange juice is a revelation, and Jubilee makes theirs with whole oranges, absolutely key.  Having it once is enough to turn you off anything from a carton forever.    If I'm just having a smoothie, my favorite is the pina colada.  The smoothies that include the thicker, smoother Greek yogurt Jubilee uses are usually enough on their own to have for breakfast or as something light enough to have if you're hungry and planning on eating later.",0.967,0.877,0.123,0.0,0.6228670634920634
