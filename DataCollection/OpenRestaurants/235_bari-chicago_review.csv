I can't describe it, but it was horrible.  Additionally, I asked for mustard and it was slathered all over and outside the sandwich.  Messy to eat on the go.   Maybe the guy who took my order and made my sandwich was having a bad day... he was without a smile and definitely disinterested.   But here's the biggest problem... I don't think I'll go back because 1.  Why should I pay to see if it's better the next time and, 2.  I don't accept freebies to improve my reviews..   No pictures..  sorry.  I threw the sandwich away after just two bites.",-0.9699,0.749,0.08,0.171,0.476875

I got the Italian sandwich for myself- I can't like a place if the bread is not fresh when you're a sandwich shop. I'm reading other reviews and people are commenting on their flaky and soft french bread- but what I got was so hard and crunchy that it was hard to bite into it- I'm wondering if my bread was over baked or if it was too old. If mine was just a fluke then I hope this establishment works on their consistency and make all of their sandwiches with fresh baked bread. The oil and seasoning on the sandwich was overwhelming- and the filling of the meat was minimal-  I'll stick to Hero's sandwiches on western and addison- never disappoints!,0.4799,0.865,0.071,0.064,0.3898809523809524

OK, all of that was way way overload. Way too much cheese, way too much eggplant and the hot peppers were SO hot, we couldn't really eat the sandwiches. Beware of the super hot!! :)  So last time I toned it all down - not extra anything. I got the regular hot giardinera. It was still pretty darn spicy. I mean, and I can put down some spice. Maybe it's in the eggplant, I don't know. I doubt it, because the eggplant is probably the part that is ruining this sandwich for me.

2017-04-23,1.0,"First, I do not think I have ever left a negative review. However, in my opinion, this business seems to be operated by a perfect storm combination of incompetent, rude, careless, and unreliable. I feel I need to share my cautionary tale.   I cannot give a review of Bari's food. Here's why: I called and placed an order. I specifically asked, ""do you deliver to [insert address]?"" The employee confirmed they do deliver to my address. I then ordered and confirmed the order would be delivered within an hour. After an hour passed, I called and spoke with a different employee about the status of our order. That employee confirmed the order had not left yet, but ""it would be there soon.""  Then, a minute later, another man called and told me their policy does not allow them to deliver to my address. He then told me they refused to deliver the order. Were they even going to call us? I understand that is their policy. However, since it was their error, they should have gone the, literal, extra mile. Instead, they chose to be lazy and rude. The last employee I spoke with said he was sorry. However, the tone of his voice, and failure to correct their error, clearly indicated he could not care less.  This is an unacceptable way to run a business.  I wish I could leave zero stars. The poor way we were treated by this company must be noted. As a business owner, I would want to know if my employees represented my company in such a sloppy manner. If I did learn of such shoddy treatment of a customer, they would no longer be employees. I hope the owner reads this and is able to rehabilitate his/her image.

2015-05-19,5.0,"In my opinion, Bari unequivocally makes the best ""Italian"" sub in the city.  I've been coming here for years, and even though they may not know my real name, they call me ""Chuck Norris"" ( guess they think I look like the old boy ! ! ) Although making a sub sandwich isn't rocket science, a noteworthy version can only be the sum of the freshest and best quality ingredients.  My checklist would include the following.  The bread should have a thin, crispy crust and soft crumb.  The meats & cheeses , lettuce & tomato must be both flavorful and freshly sliced.  And last, but not least, the giardiniera needs just the right amount of crunchy & soft veggies, herbs, and olive oil.  Bari meets all these standards. ( In addition, Bari makes its own giardiniera, and sells it in jars too)    Its no wonder the small place is always packed with customers.  Service is always prompt, but at prime time, you might need to wait a few minutes.  Its a small  price to pay for a terrific sub.  From Chicago cops and office workers to Italians from Harlem/Belmont, Brideport, or Elmwood Park, Bari is what the Italian-American sub is all about.  If you happen to be looking for Italian groceries, they carry an ample selection of oils, canned tomato products,pasta, canned fish, and homemade condiments.  They also have fresh meats , homemade sausages, cheeses , and a wide selection of deli meats/salads.  If you don't enjoy cooking, checkout their prepared pastas and sauces.  (Currently, there are a few parking spaces just 2-3 doors South which are for customers shopping at Bari)",0.8459,0.907,0.063,0.029,0.40209523809523806

I prefer it this way, but I can see how some people would not like the texture if they are used to soft bread.  One word of advice is to call-in ahead of time to place your order. If you go on the weekends you could be waiting in line for 20 minutes or more compared to walking in and getting your sub right away.

What they have in common is that they're built with love and care and great quality ingredients. This is exactly what Bari's Deli has created for several decades. If you landed here, it means you are searching for a fantastic sub sandwich in Chicago. Yeah, yeah, bada-bing bada-boom-boom, you found it so look no further, because this joint is number one when it comes to subs. We love the made-to-order deli sandwiches. Picking just one of their masterpieces at this deli shop is no easy task, since every massive mound of bread, meat, and cheese here is nothing short of a Chicago treasure. Years ago, I tried the prosciutto, sopressata comprised of fresh mozzarella, sweet roasted peppers and olive oil -- simply memorable -- fresh, chewy bread melds perfectly with the cold cuts and cheese. The savory olive spread adds an extra kick to the whole she-bang. We were astounded by the carniv-orgasmic offerings at this place when we first  came here over 10 years ago! You can try ham, salami, turkey, roast beef, mortadella with American, Swiss or provolone cheese, lettuce, tomato, onions, hot peppers, mustard, mayo, oil and vinegar, all packed on a fresh, fluffy Italian bread. The bread is simply ethereal. There are lots of solid options to choose from at this joint, which prides itself on creating sandwiches to satisfy every palette. Thick Italian bread envelops plump pieces of their meatballs, all elegantly smothered in delectable fresh mozzarella, Romano cheese and piping hot tomato sauce. Afterward, you can nap for weeks, awake refreshed (and five pounds heavier). My favorite sandwich here is their Italian sub (or Italian hero). If you want to have the gastronomical experience of a sub sandwich life time hit this place up for lunch. There is only one thing you need to know about this joint. What dat? What dat? The Italian sub is the one you want. Don't think twice! Just order it and step back. Let the man work his magic, while you marvel at the quick dance of sandwich seduction happening before your eyes. First, a long loaf of Italian bread is sliced open and fresh cured meat after cured meat thinly shaved goes directly into the sandwich. At this point, your mouth is watering as cheeses, peppers, dressing, everything, added so deftly that if you blink you might miss a step. Second, hold your wrapped sandwich tightly in your hands and try not to quiver with excitement at first bite! This mom and pop operation has been serving fantastic Italian sausage, Sub sandwiches and Italian beef for decades. I wouldn't say they have ""the best"" Italian beef in the city, but it is definitely worth trying (even if it is only once). This is carry-out only, so get your sandwich and get the hell out.  Bada-Bing, Bada-Boom.

What would have been a 35min round trip sandwich run took almost 4 hours. I could have walked that faster. I kept asking my friend if the 2 spicy Italians we got were worth such a pilgrimage... But I've gone farther for seemingly less. Even wrapped, they smelled amazing in the car and I devoured a 12inch in minutes when we finally got back.  A sandwich worth the 3 hours in traffic for sure. The meat is just so quality (and in good quantity) and everything on it is so on point. They are giant sandwiches. I think a smaller 9in would have been plenty and a wiser decision for my belly in the long run. But whatever. Worth it. And that alone is 5-star quality in my book - and I don't say this easily. Aside from sandwiches there are aisles of interesting packaged food products to browse through, and a deli counter full of pretty good and sometimes hard to find stuff. Def worth checking out!

There is also, and this is important, sauced up pasta dishes ready to take home and reheat. In addition, you can buy quarts of marinara (aka gravy) with or without meat and or meatballs.

It was packed with cheese and marinated eggplant.  It was pretty good, but not my favorite among veggie subs.  The quest for a great Italian store continues.",0.9446,0.798,0.168,0.033,0.5662941176470588

I love a good sandwich and I am a sucker for a good Italian sandwich. This one is done right. All kinds of right.  Bari is quietly tucked in between flashier delis and Italian joints along the same stretch, but I have a feeling they are head and shoulders above the others. It's old school. Meat hanging from the ceiling. Three claustrophobic isles full of Bari's homemade foods and old Italian boys making the grub. I dig it. Their Bari brand jarred giardiniera, which is sealed, is oozing so much goodness that the cardboard beneath the jars is saturated with oil.  Yumminess.  The sandwiches are big. Big as in the small is 9 inches, medium is 12 inches and large is 3 feet. I ordered a 9 inch, Italian, hot (meaning use the hot giardiniera), with onions. I grabbed a pop and the total was just a little over $6. Seriously. I wandered outside and found a stoop. A stoop with the view of the city skyline. When I started eating the sandwich I was thinking that is was definitely a high 4 star sandwich, but as I continued to eat my way through (the plan was to take half home, that didn't happen) I could taste the quality. The quality of the meats, the cheese,the tomatoes,  the herbs, and especially the olive oil and peppers. The key to stellar food is quality ingredients. Period. The bread was dense and a little too hard for my liking, but I realized it needed to be in order to stand up to the oil and giardiniera. It never got soggy and I appreciate that, hard core like. It's one of the overall best Italian sandwiches I have ever had.   I'm going back to stock up on their pumpkin ravioli and homemade giardiniera!",0.9851,0.866,0.114,0.02,0.39162499999999995

2013-01-05,4.0,"When visiting a couple of friends who had just moved into the West Loop, we walked over to Bari based on my friend's rave reviews.  I was shocked to find this popular sub shop hidden in the back of an unassuming Italian market.  But man, they knew what they were doing. I was tempted by their Italian, as that was the most popular order by the other customers, but I opted for the meatball...I have a weakness for meatball subs. The bread is ridiculously good, the meatballs were quality, and I had very little to complain about aside from that it could have used just a TOUCH more sauce...but that was a small complaint.  And for six bucks, it's hard to complain. I took my wife back a few weeks later, and obviously I loved the meatball more than I realized because I STILL didn't try the Italian...we both ordered the meatball and both thoroughly enjoyed.  Do yourself a favor and stop in -- it's a great spot making affordable, quality subs.",0.8881,0.732,0.154,0.115,0.43409090909090914

2012-11-30,4.0,"This place is a destination, an institution really and oh so very Italian. Since it often graces the front page of the Chicago Yelp section and seemed much more approachable then Alinea we made it our lunch destination. Scored some parking and walked over.  For the most part Bari is an Italian grocery with a deli counter in the back. That sounds simple, but it really is. And simple can be wonderful. As others have mentioned they sell their own products such as giardinera, sun dried tomatoes (getting those next time) etc. Sandwiches are listed on the wall. They had some great looking salads in the case (next time getting the olive salad) I got an Italian sub and some Italian wedding soup, my dining companion got Italian sausage with sweet peppers.  During the short wait for our sandwiches we wandered the isles. The products on the shelves are authentic, some of which I hadn't seen since I spent time in Italy.  The memories came flooding back when I saw the cookies (the little circle ones with the frosting dots) we used to eat for breakfast. Tons of other great stuff here flavored San Pellegrinos in bottles, ladyfingers for your tiramisu needs. The only thing this place is missing is the gelato! Now for the sandwiches. For $5 I got an enormous sandwich layered with some of the best quality meats I've had in a while (which you can purchase there). The bread was fantastic, toppings great - the only thing I would change is next time I will ask for more hot giardinera. The Italian Wedding Soup was fantastic, plenty of little meatballs, veggies and a flavorful broth. My friend loved his sub as well, for some reason I didn't try it - silly, silly me.  We had to take them to go as there is no place for eating in house. I think if it had been warmer we would have just found a stoop and dug in. Such a good sandwich, seriously Subway should just shut down now.

Oh wait, that too) goodness.  The meatballs were extremely well seasoned and this comes from someone who has meat sphere architecture in his blood.  The sahs was plenty good as well.  I make my sauce without tomato skins or blend the hell out of them as I have a texture issues.  Bari keeps them in, but hey, ""when in Rome"" 'n shit.  At around six dollars for most of their foot long subs, you'd be wasting yo got damn time at a chain sub establishment.",-0.8696,0.861,0.06,0.079,0.3144179894179895

Bari is AWESOME, A+, primetime, fuego, off the charts.  Mind you, all i get from any deli/sandwich spot is the Turkey so I cant personally speak of the other sandwiches. I can say that any one I have gone with has loved whatever they have gotten.  The hot peppers are amazing, some of the best in the city. I always get them on the side so the sandwich doesn't get soggy.  You cannot beat the price. Last weekend i was there and got 2 footongs which may be bigger than a foot and 4 containers of hot peppers on the side and the total was about $13.  I would recommend this place to anyone I cared about.  Bari also has groceries to buy.

2012-05-03,5.0,"If you are looking for the best Italian Sub in Chicago then this is the place hands down.  I have been coming here for such a long time that I can not even remember my first sandwich here.  In fact, if you did a blood test you might find there homemade hot giardiniera in my veins.  Yes it is that good and there is always a jar in my fridge. Near the deli counter you will see a shelf of homemade items from Bari.  It does not get any better then that.  You will see several kinds of giardiniera on the shelf...mild, medium, hot, super hot, super super super hot!  I usually buy the Super Super Super Hot as gifts for my friends, that tell me they can handle anything hot.  Most of them still have the jar sitting in there fridge and only use the oil for cooking because just opening the jar makes them cry.  Also on the shelf is sun-dried tomatoes and various other things too. The deli counter is amazing.  All of the sliced deli meats are so fresh because of the high turnover.  You never have to worry because the sandwiches fly off the counter here.  At lunch time people will wait in line, while a full crew works to bang out sandwiches.  I always like to plan ahead and call my order in and I advise you to do the same.  So when you walk in you can bypass the long line up the left aisle and proceed directly to the middle aisle all the way to the front and wait for one of the guys to say, ""Okay who has a phone order?""  Then you yell out your name and the guy comes back with your yummy sandwich all wrapped in white deli paper. I also highly recommend the meat counter here too.  They will cut meat for you as requested and grind different cuts if you want to create burgers or meatballs.  Yes a real butcher shop.  My favorite thing behind the meat counter is there homemade sausage...they have 3 different kinds to choose from.  My favorite is the Barese sausage which is a very small sausage that packs a lot of flavor.  I usually use it to make my famous sausage and peppers and all of my guests rave about how good it is. Yes this sausage makes me look like a rock star celebrity chef. They also have everything you would need for a party too...homemade roasted red peppers, olives, olive salads.  If you also check the fridges you will see Bari's homemade sauces too.  I have never bought one of these because being Sicilian I make my own sauce and they would take away my Italian Membership Card, if I did ever buy one.  I have talked to others and they have told me that the sauces are really good.  They also supply freshly made pasta here too from another local company. So this place is more then just sandwiches.  It has everything you could need and I love having this place nearby.  The sandwiches here are amazing.  My favorite is the Italian with Hot giardiniera.  They get the bread fresh from D'matos next door.  Sometimes I think it is the bread that just makes this the most delicious sandwich ever but once you taste the cut meat with the mixture of there giardiniera you will understand why I love this place.  But they also have other sandwiches too available here and they are just as good.  I usually always will add the hot giardiniera to every sandwich I buy.  Yes I am very addicted to it.  In fact, I graduated to the hot stuff over time.  Many years ago I use to only get the mild but now I need the hot stuff on my sub. I also must give a shout out to the owners and the staff here...they feel like family.  The owners and staff always say hi to us even if we see them on the street or at another location away from the store.  Sometimes I think...maybe I do go here too much but I also think I am not the only one that knows how good this place is. If you have not tried one, then I recommend you stop in for one.  We have taken these subs every where from hitting the lakefront, to Bears games, fireworks at the Pier, the zoo and even airplane trips.  The farthest I think the sandwich ever made it was somewhere over the Atlantic...our flying neighbors were a little jealous of our yummy eats!!! Bari's is unique...so many businesses in the neighborhood have popped up over the years and have tried to copy a Bari Sub but there is nothing like an original.   This place makes me excited because I know it is going to be so good and Bari's has never lets me down.  Okay just typing this review has made me hungry I think I need to walk down and grab one for myself now.",0.9975,0.854,0.125,0.021,0.539798534798535

Here are some tips to getting to that sandwich: -Come at the wrong time and you'll be patiently standing in a loooong line.  -Know what you want by the time you get to order because you don't want to be reminded that you're not at Subway. -parking in the neighborhood is annoying. Take the El if you can.  And... if you've been searching all over the city for Truffle oil or asprin, they have that too.

Now, I can say Bari changed that for me...if only the woman wasn't sitting next to me. Just kidding... My girlfriend and I have wanted to try Vinnie's and Bari for a long time, however, ""Operation Hot Body"" for the summer is going on at the apartment so I haven't had an opportunity to get there. When one finally arose, I pounced all over it like a lion on the prowl. We originally decided to try Vinnie's first, but it was closed so we went to Bari. It is a great spot with no frills...an Italian deli and nothing more. I am a self-proclaimed sandwich connoisseur. Actually, ""Sandwich Snob"" better describes me. It takes a lot for a sandwich to separate itself from the pack, but the Italian sub I had did. There is nothing groundbreaking about this sandwich, but Bari does something that most places don't, they do the simple things the right way, which equates to an amazing product. None of the ingredients were overpowering and were all high quality. The bread, which is from D'Amatos bakery, is exactly what I envision when it comes to Italian bread.  Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The meats were cured perfectly, the provolone cheese, tomatoes, lettuce and giardiniera were fresh, and all of it was topped with a great dressing. I will definitely order this sub again, however, I have to admit, my girlfriend got a vegetarian sub and it was better. I never thought that was possible given I would bite a cow if I was hungry enough. It was an amazing collection of eggplant, giardiniera, provolone cheese and bread.   All the sandwiches looked amazing and all are reasonably priced. I 100 percent recommend this restaurant, but if you don't have the same restraint that I do sitting on a public bench while eating, you may get arrested for doing more than consuming your sandwich. I will definitely go back, but am planning on visiting Vinnie's first so I can compare.",0.9933,0.798,0.156,0.046,0.4643040293040292

I ordered the veggie sandwich which included- marinated eggplant and then the normal lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle. Can I say that marinated basically meant, pickled eggplant! The eggplant was extremely sour/salty, almost to the point of inedible.  My boyfriend ordered the American which had ham, salami and American cheddar cheese. The quality of the meats were basically equivalent to packaged meats and the cheese was like a Kraft single!  The French bread roll was basic and nothing special. I think if you want a really good sandwich (bay cities in Santa Monica, CA) the bread has to be top notch. I was really disappointed in Bari and only went here because J.P. Graziano was closed and I was in dire need of a sub. I don't really understand the positive reviews of this place.

Left at room temperature, sprinkled with salt and fresh ground pepper.....decadent, rich, perfect with home-made fig jam and fresh bread from D'Amatos next door....I might put a ball in my crib under the tree next year.

We spent a glorious night munching on salami cured with fennel and orange rind, gorgonzola dulce, olives, burrata, endive salad with arugula, pomogranate seeds, walnuts and candied lemon, the most scrumptious lasagna alla bolognese you'll ever have in your life (PM me for the recipe), sautéed broccoli rabe and a decadent chocolate and amaretti cake.

2011-12-12,5.0,"I am completely homesick for Bari.  I miss their delicious (super hot) Italian subs more than anything in all of Chicago.  Growing up eating Italian subs in New York, I can honestly say Bari is far superior to any subs I have ever had.  I even got my non-sandwich eating fiancé obsessed with them.   Let's start with the bread.  The bread is perfect. Crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside- fresh from D'Amato's next door.  What more could you ask? The meat and cheese?  Only the freshest, most outstanding tasting meat and cheese you could ever imagine in your sub.  In fact, I have ordered both by the pound to munch on at home.  It is that good.    Now, if you want some real spice and flavor, you have to get the super hot Giardiniera.  Trust me, if you like heat,  you will love it.  It gives the sub the extra oomph all other subs are lacking.  I love their super hot Giardiniera so much that I bought a jar of it before moving to Denver.  It is phenomenal.  Warning, it is pretty spicy. I also can't leave out the Proscitutto & Fresh Mozzarella sub.  Lord, that Proscitutto is the most tender, delicious Proscitutto, ever.  It enters my dreams on a bi-daily basis.  I always got basil on top and it made the flavors pop.  Highly recommend.  This review has now truly depressed me and made me miss Bari even more.  I am jealous of all you.  Visit Bari, and eat a sub or three for me, please.",0.995,0.709,0.238,0.053,0.5883216783216784
2011-12-01,4.0,"As many of the other reviewers have stated, these sandwiches are pretty good. For me, it was all about supporting local businesses (my pledge for the entire month of December) and Bari was my choice for lunch. I am a sandwich lover, so I was looking forward to trying something that isn't a typical national sandwich chain. I came in around 11am on a Wednesday, and there was already a small line formed (NOTE: because it does get busy back there, make sure you know where the line to order is, and who is standing around waiting for their order to be made, or to be picked up. As a first-timer, I was confused by this lol). The display cases has plenty of meat, cheese, and side items, and everything looked fresh and tasty--not to mention reasonably priced for a deli. I ordered the turkey and cheese 9-inch, with pickles, tomato, spicy mustard, and a little mayo. There are also other condiments and items that you can put on your sandwich, such as sun dried tomatoes, which I thought was appealing and different. Although the guys were busy making sandwiches, they were super friendly. My order was up very quickly (but if you're in a hurry you can place an order for pick-up), and I paid in the front of the store ($4.25). I open my wrapped sandwich, and couldn't believe how big it was! They are very generous with the meat, cheese, and condiments. Not only did it look and smell great, but after I took a bite, I was very impressed with how everything tasted. Oh, and that bread!!! So good and flaky, fresh and not stale. It is the type of bread that I would cut up dip in olive oil/pepper/salt for a snack. I saved half of my sandwich for later in the evening, and it was still as tasty and fresh hours later. I don't think you can go wrong with sandwiches from Bari. So glad my month-long pledge to support local businesses will have me coming here many times during this month...and beyond :)",0.9911,0.834,0.143,0.023,0.5101641414141415

I was expecting greatness, and was extremely disappointed.  I ordered a Prosciutto and fresh Mozzarella with roasted red peppers, tomato and oil and vinegar. When I opened my sandwich, I was excited as it looked perfect. Until I felt the bread. How can any of these people give Bari 4-5 stars with this bread, is the first thing that crossed my mind. The bread was NOT the soft Italian bread I was expecting. It was extremely hard and way too crunchy. The whole time I was eating it I was debating in my mind whether it was stale, or if the people at Bari were insane. I'm leaning towards the latter- I don't think it was stale, but rather just extremely hard french bread. A REAL Italian deli makes their sandwiches on soft fresh Italian Bread, and because of this simple but miserable flaw, Bari loses. What made it even more disappointing and confusing is that there was a fresh bread bakery next door. The prosciutto and red peppers were good, but not plentiful. My tomatoes, the bread, and the macaroni salad I got were awful. The macaroni salad was more like mayonnaise salad, I had one bite and threw it away.  I can't comment on the homemade sauces or pasta, because they looked tasty. But then again my sandwich LOOKED tasty too and that turned out to be a disaster.

It wasn't gross or anything, it was a tuna salad sandwich and I personally think I make a better one. What I WAS blown away by, was the huge selection of imported Italian foods and spices. Which brings me to today. I wanted to make a pizza and I went to Bari to get the ingredients. A 1/4 lb. of pepperoni, fresh basil, marinara sauce, green pepper, mushrooms and a container of Italian seasonings for under $10. Not bad....and the pizza wasn't either.

Way better then subway.  When you go inside its a little Italian grocery store but when you walk to the back that is where they make these delicious sub sandwiches.  You can choose from different sandwiches that they have or you can create your own. They are friendly and they make you fell welcomed there.  The sandwiches there I think are the best in the city of Chicago. Their bread is so fresh and crunchy the meat is fresh and I recommend that you should have some gerenaria peppers either on the side or on your sandwich. The price is very reasonable and the sandwiches are a good size.  I love to have my sandwich with and Italian soda that they sell there. There are no chairs or tables to eat this wonderful sandwich.  When your done ordering your sandwich go next door and to D'Amato's to get you're some delicious Italian bakery good.

The subs from this place are absolutely amazing, and has been featured in many newspapers and magazines.  I live in the west suburbs of Chicago, and I plan on driving into Chicago just to get the subs from Bari.  The bread that they use is freshly baked at the bakery right next door, and is what makes these sandwiches #1.  The crust is flaky, crispy, and chewy, which screams freshly baked.  Because of how flaky and crispy the crust is, it is not a neat sandwich.  You will have a pile of crumbs at the bottom of your plate after eating a sandwich from here.  You will also probably have a half a sandwich left because they are Huge. These are my 3 favorite: The Italian Sandwich is what they are most known for. They've chosen the perfect blend of meat, vegetable, oil, and homemade Giardiniera (mild or hot) to make a hearty, delicious sub. Prosciutto & Mozzarella.  This sandwich has a very delicate flavor. This is fresh and extremely creamy mozzarella, not the stuff you buy at the grocery store, sliced thick and paired with an equally delicate prosciutto.  This is a great alternative to the big, bold in your face flavor of the Italian sub. Meatball Sandwich.  The sauce and the meatballs are all made in-house.  Its their only hot sandwich, and it's almost a meal in itself.  The meatballs are GIANT, and it will take several bites to get through just one. Bari is also an Italian grocery store, with a lot of the specialized Italian foods such as truffle oil, panettone, a HUGE selection of pastas I've never seen (fresh and dried), cheeses, olives, butcher shop meats, and cured meats.   The place is VERY cramped though. It has a total of 3 aisle, about a shopping-cart wide each.  The middle aisle is also the line to check out.  I'm surprise with their success that they haven't opted to get a bigger place or a dedicated sandwich shop.  Or maybe this is just standard fare for a dense urban city like Chicago. When you walk to the back of the store to order your sandwich, its hard to tell where the line ends or begins because there is just a crowd of people standing around awaiting their tasty sandwiches.  When the guy at the counter yells, ""Next!,"" you have to do that whole akward ""Are you in line waiting to order?"", ""Were you next, or am I?"", ""I think he's next"" , etc.. If you can, call your order in ahead of time, and just go pick it up.  It can save a lot of headaches when this place is packed.  It also sucks that they close at 1 on Sundays because that means I have to get up somewhat early so I can have sandwiches for Sunday afternoon football games.",0.9954,0.854,0.125,0.021,0.4638814016172507

This place scores major points for not looking great - anyone you take here will feel very cool and in-the-know for entering such a nondescript storefront and finding an amazing deli in the back.  We tried the Italian sandwich and the ham and cheese. The Italian was fantastic, definitely what I'd recommend. The spicy version was just spicy enough for me (nothing requiring stoicism, but a decent kick), the meats were delicious, and the bread was great. Like other Yelpers said, nice and crisp on the outside, but on the inside, soft and chewy.  The ham and cheese was good, even tasty, but nothing remarkable. We ordered it because some other Yelpers had recommended it, and maybe if ham and cheese is your thing, you'd be over the moon. But the place is known for its Italian meats - unless you're a vegetarian, why not order what they're best at?  This place does have at least two vegetarian options that looked good: the Italian Vegetable sandwich, featuring eggplant (mmm) and the Caprese sandwich with basil and fresh mozzarella.  Portions are HUGE - half of the 9-inch was enough for me, and my hungry fiance could only eat half his 12-inch.  The store itself is pretty great, too - next time, I plan on bringing a bag and a little more money, so I can try their vast selection of ravioli, sauces, spices, and other savories.  Afterwards, go across the street to the Italian bakery and get a cannoli (the best I, a poorly-traveled non-gourmet, have ever tried), cookies, or bread.

2009-07-28,4.0,"~~Update~~ So I remember a fantastic Italian sub that i had eaten, from years ago.  Busting my brains to remember, and it was this place.  Hahaha, trippy;  perhaps it was cuz the sandwich was delivered that the sandwich dried out.  Suppose they got skimpy with the oil.  Either way, I'm sure this place will be a five.  Just gotta try it again. I feel bad giving this place a 4.  I always feel something is wrong with me, when I don't fall in line with the majority. I guess my main gripe would be the bread.  It's a crusty, flaky, and kinda chewy bread.  A bit too chewy, I was having trouble tearing it.  I felt like some dog having to wave his face side to side...okay I'm probably exaggerating a little bit.  But it was too tough for comfort.  I like bread that holds strong, but has some give to it. The ingredients tasted top notch.  I had both the Italian sub and the Prosciutto and Mozzarella sub per the recommendations of my fellow Yelpers.  The italian was pretty good, but not stellar.  I honestly liked Fontano's better...probably because I liked their bread better. The Prosciutto and Mozz sub though was the best I ever had, though.  They pack in a fairly good amount of prosciutto, and you can actually taste the salty goodness of the meat.  Since the slices are usually razor thin, I feel many times in a P and M sandwich the P gets overpowered.  The mozzarella was tasted very fresh.  Enjoyed it a lot. The size is much bigger than I thought.  I was expecting Jimmy John portions, but these footlongs are more filling than a Subway footlong.  They are packed much tigher and are generally much, much denser than a Subway sandwich.   In that respect, GREAT DEAL.   I ordered delivery, and the delivery guy was 15 mins early.  Kinda felt that put me on the spot.  Oh well, I forgive him.  I wouldn't say this place is the best, hands down; but it's definitely one of the best.",0.9969,0.734,0.218,0.047,0.4921652421652421

I used to absolutely love their sandwiches and ordered from there all the time.  Then, I had a very unpleasant experience.  Knowing they would be busy and that I was in a hurry, I ordered two sandwiches ahead of time.  When I arrived 20 minutes later to pick them up, there was a ridiculous line.  I walked to the counter to tell them that I had a pick up and was told to wait in line.  I told him again that I had an order waiting and didn't want to wait 20 more minutes so he could hand me my already made sandwiches and he told me again, but ruder ""You don't get to jump the line.  I don't care that you called ahead.  Everyone waits in line.""  So I said thank you and walked out.  As I walked to the sandwich shop down the street that makes similar food but is ALWAYS NICE, I called Bari to explain my displeasure.  The person on the phone told me that the guy at the counter was wrong and that I can just pick up the food without waiting, I told her that I wouldn't be coming back and that they should probably make sure to tell the counter guys what she had told me. So a few weeks back (months and months later), I ordered ahead again.  When I got there, of course, there was a line again.  Once again I walked up to the counter and once again I was told to stand in line even though I could see my order sitting there (all he had to do was turn around, pick it up, and hand it to me).  This time, on my way out, I stopped and explained to the cashier (a family member of the owner) and told her that I won't be coming back.  Though she apologized and offered to give me my food for free, I declined.  I never wanted free food.  What I wanted was for this place to give good service.  I'll happily pay a little more to be treated like a customer instead of an a-hole. Either dump the ordering ahead, retrain the numbskulls behind the counter, or expect me never to return. I'm not waiting 20 more minutes in line so someone can hand me an order I placed 40 minutes prior.  The bread gets soggy, the freshness is gone, and I get pissed!

2008-08-25,3.0,"My review is based solely on their sandwiches - one of my clients frequently has it brought in for lunch. I've had their Italian sausage, prosciutto and mozzarella, smoked turkey, corned beef, and roast beef sandwiches, and all are decent.  I'm beginning to get a little tired of their bread, which is an Italian loaf, and while I'm a fan of good crusty bread, this is both crusty and chewy, and my teeth hate me after a little bit. My other (admittedly nit picky) complaint is that condiment distribution is not very even. I love mustard as much as the next guy, but when there's a big stripe of it running down the middle of the sandwich, and none elsewhere, you get alternating bites of no mustard, and more mustard than you really wanted at any one time. I can't take price away from them. Maybe it's just the way the client handles orders, but I'm paying $6 for a huge 12"" sandwich, which strikes me as a pretty good deal. A lot of these reviews seem to be incredibly complimentary of the grocery store aspect, which I should check out. I also see reviews of food items that are not available to me on my client's order form. So take my review for what it's worth.",0.85,0.844,0.094,0.062,0.4011752136752137

The meat is fresh and the cheeses are perfectly aged - they haven't even remotely begun to form the hard edges like the cheeses you get from any grocery store or any other Italian import store.  The 9"" sub is enough food for 2 meals. Some words of advice: 1. ask the guys behind the counter to cut the sub into quarters for you so it's easier and cleaner to eat; and 2. Ask for a Mortadella and Prosciutto with mozzarella sub. In Sicilian, it's referred to as the Buttana Grassa, or ""fat whore.""
