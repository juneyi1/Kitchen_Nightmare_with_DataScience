2017-08-29,3.0,"Let me preface this by saying the food is very good. If this is what I am to expect deep dish to taste like, I think I am off to a good start. My experience with the service was appalling however. Management, you really shouldn't allow your staff to diminish an experience that should be outstanding.  To be fair I was one of a party of 13 arriving for a 9pm dinner reservation. I stress reservation, to point out that the purpose or scheduling one is to be prepared for guests. I digress. The restaurant was not ready. We hovered around the door for a few minutes, then escorted upstairs to two tables that would only accommodate a portion of our party. It wasn't until another table of two left that we were able to add our other three members to the group. Fine. No big deal.  Enter our server, Tonya, or was it Terry? Right off the bat she looked stressed. Was she overwhelmed with such a large group to tend to? Who knows. She made it clear that she was in a hurry and not in any position to be polite. My colleague is Vegan so we asked it they had Vegan options on the menu. No, the pizza is not vegan. We then asked about the bruschetta. Her reply, and I quote ""are you always this annoying, or is it just today?"" My head exploded but because I was with work colleagues I didn't snap my head. I wasn't the only one who kept mum. She really didn't want to ask about the bread. In a tone that was forthright, yet polite, I requested that she ask the kitchen about the Bruschetta just to be sure. She did. Anyway, the bruschetta wasn't vegan either. I forget what my colleague ordered.  The rest of the team well H.A.M on the deep dish. The classic, the mushroom and the cheese were all ordered and devoured with pleasure. But, we are getting ahead of ourselves. When it came time to serve said pizzas I couldn't tell if I was being yelled at for ordering my food or being yelled  at because there was so much. In a loud voice ""okay, I've got two Classic, where are they going,"" ""well hand me plates and I'll hand you the pizza!""  At this point everyone was bewildered at her tone, her body language and her hastiness. When we discovered we were missing two additional pizzas the team opted not to push with ordering them. Since it would take 45 minutes for them to come out. We were quite ready to finish our food and leave as quickly as possible.  Miraculously (perhaps she overheard our whispering) our server tried to redeem herself. ""May I serve you another slice,"" looks like the pizza order was fixed your pizzas are on their way."" They came, we took them so go.  What a missed opportunity by Lou's, all because of one lousy server. The floors weren't clean either!

2017-08-28,1.0,"There are so many other places you can get deep dish pizza from in Chicago!!! We (group of 6) visited Lou Malnati's pizza yesterday for lunch prior to heading to O'Hare for our flight.  We arrived around 11:15am, so the restaurant was still fairly empty as they had just opened. All of us had our carry-on luggage. We asked for a table for 6, and they took a minute to seat us. The staff decided to seat us upstairs- keep in mind there were clear tables on the ground level- so we all had to carry our bags up to their second floor. Our table wasn't yet ready, so we waited near another table that was set up for 7, and asked if it would be ok if we sat there. The waitress said no, and explained that the table was set up for 9, despite only seeing 7 place settings... and proceeded to seat us at a table in the far back, by a service door, and next to a large group on a food tour.  Waiter took a while to come over, I'm guessing because we were sat so far back in a corner. Assuming this was because we had luggage. He took our order and left.  During the first interaction with our waiter, we explained that we had one dairy allergy at the table. No, this is not someone who decided to cut out dairy, go vegan, whatever. She has a severe allergy to dairy (different to being lactose-intolerant). We explained this to our waiter. Normally at other restaurants when we explain her dairy allergy to our wait staff, they respond quite attentively. This waiter seemed to brush off our statement, and carried on taking the order.  We ordered a few appetizers to share, and our friend with a dairy allergy ordered the bruschetta, again asking for her order with no dairy.  Our first appetizers came, we ordered the chicken wings and calamari. Upon asking the man who was refilling our water if the chicken wings had dairy, he said he didn't know. We had to ask him to check for us, or find our waiter. He never returned to our table with an answer.  Our waiter returned to our table for something unrelated, and we asked the same question: Do the chicken wings contain dairy? He said he didn't know, and we had to prompt him to return to the kitchen to find out.  About 10 minutes later, he returns to assure us that the chicken wings didn't have dairy in the breading. My friend proceeds to eat one of the wings.  About another 10 minutes passes, ironically while she was telling our group of another time at a restaurant they had messed up her order and the aftermath of that day. We then see the manager and our waiter approaching our table. The manager asks ""did you eat the chicken wings?"" We all knew where this was going and were SHOCKED. We even asked if he was joking. The manager let us know that the wings did in fact contain dairy, AFTER she had already eaten the wing.  It is shocking to me that a restaurant chain would be so dismissive and rude about a dairy allergy. Every staff member we interacted with were unprofessional and dismissive, and we were absolutely not impressed. They offered us a gift card (we gave it away because we don't live in Chicago) and offered to comp our meal.  The manager and waiter offered their apologies, but we left before finishing our food. I would never recommend this place again, especially to those who have sensitivities to food of any kind. I understand these kinds of this can happen, the reason for my review is the combination of lack of knowledge of the menu and attitude the wait staff took with our group when we inquired about whether or not the appetizer contained dairy.  Food was average, but will never return to be talked to or treated that way again! It's a shame because the restaurant on N State St (we were on Wells St) did not share this terrible service. *side note- as we were leaving, the table we asked to be seated at in the first place (the one the waitress told us was used for groups of 9) had a group of 6 seated.  tripadvisor.com/ShowUser…",-0.9169,0.915,0.033,0.053,0.5124861572535989

When you pay $40 all in, delivery tip etc, for a medium pizza. It would be nice to get what you paid for.  Yesterday I was shorted two toppings that I ordered. I went over my order on the phone at least 3-4 times. But I didn't receive my onions or green pepper. The ingredients that I did receive were barely on there. I could count on two hands the amount of sausage crumbles I received.  I also asked for crushed red and parm cheese. Asked 2-3 times to make sure they bring it, as they never do.  Lastly, my pizza was like soup. Very undercooked.  I know these sound like small things, but add them all up and pay $40.00 for 6 slices of pizza and.... it is not a very satisfying experience.

2017-08-23,3.0,After seeing Hamilton my husband and I worked our way up here for dinner. I was expecting a huge crowd but was amazed by the fact that the place was half empty when we arrived. We got seated immediately. Service however was very slow and took a while to get waited on. Although they have both deep dish and their Malnati's specials we decided to go with thin crust since we were pretty much worn out. Our waiter said it would take 45 minutes to prepare but since we ordered thin crust he said he would check on it and we would probably have it sooner. The main dining area is decorated with jerseys of famous people.  They have near the entrance a sign that says text message area. I guess they must use texting if there is a line. I noticed the place was a bit old and when I went to use the ladies room I had to wait since there was only one stall and it was in a small area. We did however get our pizza in 15 minutes. We ordered a small mushroom and green pepper.Toppings are extra on cheese pizzas and they do note that even if you order half topping then you pay the full price of the topping. I did see many people ordering for take out or doggie bags since you get so much. Place can get very loud at times. There were 6 generous cuts to the pizza. They were good but not anything that I would find spectacular. Maybe if I had the deep dish one that would have made a difference. There are other items on the menu besides pizza. Even for desserts my husband spotted a chocolate pizza but we were pretty full to go beyond the pizza we shared. You can eat either indoors or out. You can even sit on a high top or at a booth. The choice is yours. I No trip would be complete without trying one of Chicago's famous pizza places and we were glad to have the opportunity to enjoy one.,0.983,0.851,0.11,0.039,0.5629047619047619
2017-08-23,4.0,"I've been to Chicago once before and had Giordanos and absolutely loved their pizza. I was going to go visit them again because I knew I'd enjoy myself and it would be a no fail dining experience.  Of course I had to reference my fellow Yelpers and see what they had to say since I haven't been here for about 7 years. I'm glad I went off my plan and took the ""risk"" of trying Lous. I definitely can see what all the hype is about, their deep dish pizza is definitely a Chicagoan staple.  I was staying far from this particular location but had to check it out because the ones close to my hotel were take out only. Arrived at this location and saw a lot of people waiting to be seated. It was good and bad, obviously because I know people want to eat here and the pizza must be good and bad because I was bracing myself for probably a minimum of an hour wait. Was sunrise when I gave my name and they gave me an estimated time of 30-35 minutes. They let you pre order Pizza before seated as it takes about 45 minutes to make.  Sweet! So I thought to myself I've got plenty of time to check out another Chicago place to eat, Stans donuts. Looked it up, saw it was .7 miles away and called the uber. As soon as I arrived at stans, I got a text saying my table was ready and they'll hold it for 5 minutes. CRAP!!! Texted them back and said I was in the bathroom, whoops.  My table was ready within 15 minutes. Okay, now for the nitty gritty. Was planning on only getting the pizza but someone suggested the wings. Being the fatty I am I of course ordered it, wasn't sure if I should get the bbq or the buffalo style so the waiter suggested both sauces on the side and ranch. Hell yes. They arrived and they were mighty delicious. How the heck do I eat this and not be full, or pace it as slow as I can and wait for the pizza? I was hoping they weren't that good, but they were. So hard to do when you're hungry and have been saving your appetite all day for this meal. Alas, my pizza arrived..half pepperoni half sausage. Omg, so good. The crust was nice and crispy and my first bite and a burst of flavor. Pizza was expertly made as it left me to wonder how the toppings don't fall off.  You can taste all the ingredients in every bite, pepperoni, cheese, sauce, crystal working in perfect harmony.  So glad I made the decision to go here.  Now I need to go back to giordanos and have myself a little contest. But wait, there's more. As I had to unbutton my pants and had no shame gluttonizing my way through the pizza and wings, I had to finish it off with their dessert. And yet again, it was bomb. It's a pizookie  basically, a chocolate chip cookie with a bunch of vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. Idk what's different in this one vs bjs but it was amazingly good.

I had intended for the restaurant to be mobbed, but as far as I can see there was enough space on the floor to perform The Nutcracker. I'm just glad that I don't have to wait for seating or have to sit outside--has been humid lately. An expressionless bartender asked me if I wanted to start on a drink. Nope, just a Coke. I had already skimmed the menu and knew I wanted to start on the mozz. sticks. 10 seconds later, I said I might as well put in my pizza order. And he said, might as well, it DOES take 40 minutes. But he said it like a jerk would say it. Like if common sense should have taught me this. I immediately developed a bad taste in my mouth. I couldn't let the bartender in his lonely island take away from the hype. He did mention getting the butter crust and I was later glad I did. You see, optimism. My 7 sticks came out about 10 minutes after ordering. They were gone just about as soon as they were presented to me. I like them hotter(temp) than served and the tomato sauce accompaniment was nice and chunky. And not 40 minutes, but in 25 minutes  my personal deep dish pizza with pepperoni came out. Given to me briskly and with no eye contact. It was an interesting wait though. Got to see the staff do a lot of dancing, and dancing with whipped cream in their mouth, and play patty cake, and dance some more, and the bartender likes sandsurfing--I overheard. BUT THAT PIZZA!!! Boy, was that a delicious circular and singular sensation. I felt weird having to use a fork and knife coming from the land of slices. But I got a personal so I was able to still use my paws. I asked the bartender to go light on sauce as well. Yummy, and buttery and a taste that was so satisfying and that lingered. Each bite had the promise of a happy ending on my palette. Boy, was that a great piece of doughy heaven with poking pieces of pepperoni. I wasn't savvy on the pan sizes until after I ordered. But I think I could have easily took down the next size(for 2). I know I will be back. Maybe at this location, or maybe at another. I need to experience the greatness of this pizza once or twice again. Hope there's friendlier service next time.",0.9979,0.796,0.175,0.028,0.5633798511430089
2017-08-21,3.0,"2nd Stop while on my Chicago trip. I had high hopes for this style of deep dish pizza.  I ate a Small Malnati Chicago Classic ($15.45) and I could only put down 2 of the four slices. Overall it was a good pie, however, it was a bit overpowering with garlic. My favorite thing about the pizza was the sausage with every bite. I like the way the sausage was spread over the entire pizza, that part of the experience was amazing. I have nothing to compare this to except for the east coast, thin crust pizza we eat on a normal basis. That said, I would probably only eat this style of deep dish pizza 1 time a month.

2017-08-16,4.0,"I've been to Chicago dozens of times, and I've eaten deep dish pizza, but I'd never had deep dish in Chicago. A crime, I know. On a winter visit to Chicago my boyfriend and I decided to right this wrong and check out Lou Malnati's for a late lunch. We sadly had just missed their wonderful-sounding lunch special and thus opted to split a medium Malnati Chicago Classic - sausage, extra cheese, and tomato sauce on their signature butter crust.  The menu has serving suggestions for the different sizes, and though there were two of us we picked the medium (serves three) because my boyfriend wanted leftovers. I am here to tell you that you do not need to size up to leave with extra pizza. Despite being ravenous when we walked in, I was only able to take down a slice and a half and my boyfriend two and a half. Even a small would have left us with extra slices.  The pizza itself was delicious and decadent. I generally hate sausage, but Italian sausage done right is a treat and I'm glad I trusted my instincts to give it a try here. The amount of cheese would make any Wisconsinite feel at home, and the sauce was a tasty topper. The butter crust was, as advertised, buttery. You will definitely feel like a 'Da Bears Chris Farley after enjoying a meal here.  I went into our lunch fully intending to order their Chocolate Chip Pizza after a previous stay in River North that taunted me the entire time with the smell of fresh-baked cookies. However, after my gut-busting failed attempt to eat a second slice of our deep dish I had to abandon all hope. Meal or dessert - never the twain shall meet in my belly during a LM visit.  Service was good. When you arrive you can put in your order while you wait for a table due to the long cooking times. We were seated just as we made up our minds and were about to place our order. Due to the long wait between ordering and our pizza's arrival we could have used another check-in to refill drinks, but that was my only complaint. Once we got our pizza our server was great about checking in to make sure we were happy with our meal and that we had everything we needed.  Deep dish pizza isn't something that I can do regularly, but I could definitely see working this in once a year or so on one of our Chicago visits.",0.9775,0.806,0.122,0.072,0.4798687423687423

2017-07-29,3.0,"Arrived in Chicago armed with ample pizza recommendations and 9 out of 10 suggested Lou Malnati's, so I had to experience the hype for myself. There was a 25 minute wait for a table (which was fair), and we were given the option to place an order before we were seated so we'd only wait 20-25 min before our pizza was done (which was brilliant).  We were able to snag seats at the bar where I ordered a beer. The wait went by pretty quickly (I hadn't even finished my beer), and we were then seated in a roomy and rustically-decorated upstairs area that I absolutely loved. The reason this place lost 2 stars for me was that the pizza came out on the colder side of lukewarm. We had ordered extra cheese and when the pie was cut, the cheese cut like a block. There was no stringy goodness as my slice detached from the rest of its comrades. That should've been a red flag.  My first slice was a volatile bag of mixed emotions. I would be torn between disappointment and mild satisfaction as I bit into various parts of the pizza that were still warm versus parts that were now room temperature (and the room was cool. The AC was GOING...summers in the midwest are no joke). However, it was my second slice that sealed the deal. The slice was now completely room temperature and the cheese had the texture of greasy rubber. Not cool. I did not know that cold deep dish pizza was the epitome of human disappointment before that moment. Maybe it was just a one-off for Lou Malnati's, but seeing as I was visiting from 1700 miles away, I highly doubt I will be visiting again for a second chance when there's so much good food in Chicago.

2017-07-26,5.0,"You can get the Restaurant Quality but you need to learn the art of PCR.  That being said Lous is the ONLY pizza you can re-heat two or three time and it just gets better each time.  That dense Wisconsin Cheese is unlike any pizza ANYWHERE. Regarding PCR See below: Now that Lou's  is popping up all over Chicago - we now have the luxury of having it delivered right to our door.  Our standard - Lou's Deep Dish Butter Crust - UNCUT with a Lou's family style salad IT'S A MUST!  with the sweet vinegrette. ATTENTION WING FANS  GET THE BUFFALOU'S -  I dont' know how they season the wings but they are awesome just on their own - sauceless  if you get delivery DO THE THE SAUCE ON THE SIDE - otherwise you get a steam room version of them and they don't hold the crispiness you get table side at the restaurant. REGARDING DELIVERY - Well...I'm still giving Lou's 5 stars because well it's the best deep dish in the country.  But the delivery of this Chicago Icon does require some PCR - Pizza Crisping Rehabilitation.  I wouldn't recommend the pre baked because unless you have a commercial oven - it's not the same as their blast furnace pizza ovens.  1. Have your oven heated to 500 and invest in a pizza stone and get that sucker HOT. Most likely if your delivery driver is not driving like Mario Kart your pizza will be in tact.    2. Realize they build their pizza with the sauce on top with no cheese to swaddle it - and it's  - essentially seasoned crushed tomatoes that are fresh and delicious but VERY JUICY.  So once you get the pizza - slide it into the oven for about another 10 minutes and that juice should evaporate or settle into the pizza.  If you're in a hunger delirium take 2 paper towels and gently lay them flat on the pizza - DON'T BLOT it - just lay it on the pizza and tap the towels a little and  the extra juice will absorb enough to make it puddle free. 3. NEVER order it UNCUT - you're liable to get something that looks like a car accident victim. You won't be able to cut that with anything but a pizza cutter the crust is a hearty foe. 4. Finally - just understand that cardboard likes buttercrust and because of that you will not have that firm crust as crispy as if you have it in the restaurant.  But on those cold winter nights - if you invest a little ""rehabilitation"" and some safe harbor by taking your UNCUT pizza out of the box and giving it some PCR (Pizza Crust Recrisping)...it doesn't get any better than Lou's for deep dish. While the restaurant is still the best way to experience Lou's with some PCR you can enjoy your Lou's without the noise the bustle and the travel.  Nothing better in the winter than a good night home with family with a good movie surround sound and surrounding a Lou's Deep Dish Pizza in your pajamas.",0.9943,0.798,0.141,0.061,0.5356398809523809

It was quite busy, but they take your order for pizza ahead of time at the counter and I guess fire it up once you are at your table so you don't waste time ordering it at the table. We ordered the classic with the sausage and cheese. We started with a house salad which was tasty. I also had their italian style margarita..which funny enough tastes JUST LIKE the italian margarita at olive garden. Figure someone from OG must have visited a LM and tasted the margarita and decided to ""borrow"" it..who knows..quite funny. So for the pizza..since this is our first ever chicago pizza, we cannot really compare it to anything else. Well..up in San Francisco Bay Area in Petaluma, there is Old Chicago Pizza Co that has chicago Style. We LOVED that pizza..it was made in same style with sauce on top, but the thick  crust had cheese tucked in it and the cheese was oozy and stringy...yum!  So for Lou's...the toppings were quite..hmm..solid? The cheese was not gooey at all. It wasn't bad..just not what I am used to. It was tasty enough..but was surprised the ingredients were more ""compressed"".  All in all a good meal.

The sauce is always watery and tasteless, without even a hint of garlic.  Like pomodoro vs. marinara maybe, to make a pasta comparison.  The outside crust is almost always too hard, due to the long time required to cook something as thick as lasagne. Lou Malnati's in particular is plagued by service problems even if their version of the Deep Dish is the least worst I've tasted.  An hour to get an appetizer?  90 minutes to get a pizza or a seat?  Wall to wall tourists?  Check, check, and check.  If you want to lose your sanity come here on a weekend night.  You can have my seat; I won't be using it. Other reviewers who didn't really like it gave this place 3 stars because they have become a famous brand.  I docked them a star for taking forever.

The best part was that there was a little link we could click on when we first got a confirmation text that shows us what place in line we're in. This was perfect because we didn't want to get caught up with all the shopping so it was nice to see. I'm literally writing this review with my mouth watering as I'm yearning for a deep dish slice of pizza from Lou's with all my heart. The Cobb salad I believe it was is heavenly and a perfect salad to share with your table. The next thing we shared was garlic bread with the marinara sauce. The marina sauce that they offer is not your basic sauce from the jar. You can tell this was handcrafted with love because there was something very special in there and it was quite addicting.

I don't regret choosing Lou Malnati's for that at all.  Yeah, there will probably be a wait. It's the famous Lou Malnati's. But that's okay because each pizza takes 40 minutes to cook, anyways. While you wait, you can preorder your pizza and they will text you when your table is ready.  What makes their pizzas good is the crust. BUTTERY. GOODNESS. You MUST get the Malnati Chicago Classic for the buttery crust - you can get it with sausage or pepperoni. The crust is a game changer. The tomato sauce was a bit on the tart side for my taste but it didn't bug me too much. Perfect amount of cheese. Decent amount of sausage. Also the Malnati salad was a good appetizer to get while waiting for your pizza to finish baking. It's light and refreshing and the sweet vinaigrette is the icing on top.  By no means did Lou Malnati's convert me into a deep dish lover. I am still a thin-crust lover through and through.

First, make sure whenever you sit down make sure you place your pizza order. It takes about 40 minutes to make.  Second, go ahead and order yourself the cheese bread. It's half a loaf of garlic cheese bread that is a great filler, especially for the price, while you wait.  The pizza itself was delicious I loved every bit of it. It's definitely more of a pie or cake, which is to be expected since it's a deep dish. The layers of meat and cheese and sauce keep you coming back bite after bite. Before you know it you've had two slices and are like geez... I still have another slice left and I'm stuffed.  Deep dish wouldn't be something I would order every time I order pizza.

What I like about this place is that you can get the pizza crust on the bottom crispy and add a butter glaze to the crust (which you absolutely must otherwise it will be a  disgusting soggy mess!). We put an order in for an all cheese deep dish with a the crispy crust/butter glaze and half of it with pepperoni and then waited about 10 min to be seated. We can around 5:30 so it wasn't packed yet but by the time we left there was a huge line. Since we had to wait 40 min, we got the house/green salad in the individual size and it was perfect for sharing. The pizza came out pretty good, again, I don't really like deep dish, but it wasn't soggy like others I've tried and it wasn't as thick. It was way too saucy so next time I'd ask for less sauce.  The only part that could be improved is the pre-seating service. When we first came in the host seemed completely lost and just stared at us for a few min. Then once he put our name down he told us to go pre-order the pizza. That went smoothly but when we were called to sit down, the same confused host started walking towards the back (we followed him), then he turned out and got menus, handed them to use and told us to go upstairs and someone else will seat it. I'm not sure why we had to go back and forth and why it was so confusing for an employee who probably seats many people a day to tell us right off the bat on where to go.

Here you order your pizza so it's being made as you wait, ok that will speed things up.

I ate the pizza with a knife & fork, the pie had cooled and we didn't get that stretchy goo of mozzarella. It thought ""Italian sheppards pie"", the tomato flavor of the sauce was outstanding.

So... how do you choose the best deep dish pizza spot knowing that there's many others. If you're like me, you probably think ""whats the best spot"" , ""where's the best bang for the buck?"" , ""I don't want to waste my time"" , ""I don't want to be disappointed"" .... well I'll make it easy for you... Go to Lou F'N Malnati's!!!! As recommended by a few Chicago natives and locals, we went to see for ourselves if it was everything it was hyped out to be. On our first visit, we ordered the ""Chicago Classic"" - which basically is sausage, extra extra cheese, and their signature tomato sauce. And when i say sausage, I don't mean sausage as in carry out pizza sausage... you know, little turd pieces of sausage scattered across the whole pizza?.. well, no no no no no.. none of that here at Lou's. Here at Lou's, I mean sausage as in a whole freaking slab of sausage (lean sausage may I add) covering every square inch, every square centimeter on the pizza!! The ""Chicago Classic was so good, so meaty, so cheesy, and oooohhh the crust, Oh so buttery!! We also ordered ""The Lou"" which has some veggies on it such as spinach, tomatoes, and shrooms. That was good also but, hey I'm a meat kinda guy so I prefer the Classic Chicago! Aside from the pizza, they also have real good appetizers. Some appetizers that we tried that is worth mentioning are: the calamari, chicken wings and mozzarella sticks. On our last night in Chicago, we decided to do delivery out to our hotel, not knowing when we will get close or even get our hands on this authentic deep dish pizza again.  Being that I am a meat lover, ordered a custom combo, sausage and pepperoni. It was meaty delicious.  Recently, I found out that besides Chicago/ Illinois, there is only one other city/ state that has the pleasure of having a Lou Malnati's in the U.S. ... and that is Phoenix, AZ. Living in Las Vegas, I was ecstatic! It is about a 4-5 hour drive or I have the option on taking that hour flight. Will try to make it a point to visit at least every other month LoL Yes, all for this. Best pizza I've ever had! That's because I've yet been to NYC or Boston.

The crust at Lou Malnati's was a bit different than what I expected - it was actually a little bit hardened. I didn't think it was a bad thing, but just not what I imagined it would be. But the primary reason I prefer Paul's in Clearwater is because it's just absolutely swamped with cheese, where Lou Malnati's had plenty of cheese, but it just wasn't quite the level of Paul's.

It wasn't packed but it seemed like a tour group was heading in there around the same time. I ended up sitting at the bar since it was convenient and they have full service there as well. Didn't get any drinks besides water and chose the Malnati's special (personal size). They were not kidding when they say it takes about 35 minutes but watching tv for a bit and chatting it up and the time kind of flew by though I kept thinking about the pizza. It finally came out and after a photo, I dug in (with a fork and knife. Fork and knife not required but helpful. When you first look at it, the personal size didn't seem too big but it was deep and heavy so it is enough. The crust was amazing. It was the perfect crispness and felt almost like a pie crust. As for the filling, I felt the cheese was too tough and not gooey at all. it felt like a block of cheese underneath the sauce and meats. As for the meats, it was overwhelming. The sausage was laid out over all of the pizza and there was no other flavor that permeated through. The tomatoes on top also leaked out some water so if I didn't let out the juices, I felt the crust would get somewhat soggy. I love deep dish and I was definitely looking forward to getting some in Chicago. The pizza was decent but not as good as I expected. Overall, the service was decent as well but I felt a bit pushy in terms of getting a drink (even though I was sitting at the bar). I will have to try out the others to do a proper comparison...",0.9717,0.824,0.116,0.06,0.5179802955665024

My guess is that it has lost its mojo since it now seems so touristy. The place was packed for lunch when we got there and we were told that the pizza would take 45 minutes. We were 4 adults and two children and they say us in a round table which barely fit all of us, we were knocking elbows. To top it off it was in the middle of the dining room close to the stairs and the kitchen exit. Extremely uncomfortable!  I ordered, my oldest ordered a plate of ravioli and the server recommended we get the adult version. We did. Turned out that he still got us the kids' version which had 3 miserable and unappetizing ravioli on them. The sauce I'm betting was Ragu or something because I've tasted better from store bought. It was pretty sad. We eventually had to order a second plate of ravioli for my child.  So, as far as the pizza goes...I got the small (thank God!) Chicago Classic with a couple of extra ingredients. My family got the The Lou, the large size for three adults. My youngest got a personal cheese pizza. Honestly, the most satisfied person at our table was our 7 years old. The rest of us were very disappointed with our pizzas. Mine didn't have enough sauce, the other adults didn't like theirs because it had TOO much sauce.

But he nonetheless improved upon that knowledge, and now we prefer his version of a tomato pie over all others. Now my partner and myself don't indulge often, and while I am still a fan of Pizzeria Uno's pies, it is always Lou's when we do our Pino (Noir) and Pizza night. .Their Lou's salad is fabulous, their wings, while not a value item, are respectable enough for an occasional treat. But Lou's deep dish pizza is our one true favorite. While some prefer the buttercrust (us), others need to be mindful that Lou's will cook your pizza the way you prefer: Regular, gooey, or well done. If you're not a fan of softer dough, get your pie well done. If you don't want it dry, order it gooey. Lou Malnati's aims to please, you just need to ask your server about this. After all, Chicago pizza is legendary for good reasons. Oh, and if you don't want to deal with dough, Lou's has a crust-less pizza! They use a large sausage patty as the base, and pile the sauce, cheese and other ingredients on top of that before baking it. It's great for gluten-free dieters and others who are avoiding the carb-loading that eating pizza usually involves. Nico, one of the managers at the original Lou's in Lincolnwood, IL, runs a tight ship, is very personable, and seems to have great relationships with his staff. We have had their thin crust version, and it's our recommendation that you get this style of crust half-baked, and take it home to finish the process.

Pizza takes at least 30 minutes to be made, so it may be a good idea to call in advance or bring something to do/be prepared to entertain yourselves for awhile. We tried a small 1/2 Lou 1/2 Classic Chicago (charge is for the more expensive of the 2), which is good portion size for two people.  The Lou itself had copious amounts of cheese, which was nice intermixed with some spinach, mushrooms, and tomatoes. I do think I like the classic better because of the rich flavor. Note that the sausage seems to be one large flat piece of sausage (rather than smaller pieces). The butter crust, was indeed more buttery than most, but not as amazing as it sounds, unfortunately.

Overall, I was incredibly disappointed all around by the service, food and experience provided by Lou Malnati's.  Our pizza took fifty minutes to come out, which wouldn't have been an issue if it were as hot as a pizza straight from the over should be. Our cookie pizza was completely dough and obviously just wasn't done cooking. I had thought that maybe it was just a certain part of the cookie, but the entire thing was mediocre because of the texture being a sloppy mess after the whipped cream and ice cream soaking into the dough. For a $7 dessert, there's a certain expectation that a consumer has. My edible cookie dough just fell short.  I will give the flavor to both of my items great remarks: the taste was totally there, and the proportions were PERFECT for my liking.  Our service was mediocre. Our waiter wasn't very helpful, and elongated our checkout time to the point of extreme frustration. I even asked to pay up front because we were tired of the neglect and have places to visit during our time here. Our waiter showed up five minutes after we sat back down and took our payment, then dropped off the card and receipt without any final remarks.  We won't be visiting again when we come back to Chicago.

The aroma from the pizza when it hit our table instantly told us this was going to be one of the best deep dishes we've had. It definitely did not disappoint. The crust of the pizza was so buttery, paired with a huge chunk of sausage in every bite. Be careful with what size you order here because deep dishes are no joke, we went with a medium and still had two slices leftover.  Aside from the pizza, we got an order of the Calamari Frites which is always a solid appetizer, no complaints.  Service was excellent. Since deep dish takes a little over half an hour to make, I liked that they let you pre-order your pizza while waiting for a table so that by the time you're seated, you're waiting no more than another 10-15 minutes for your pizza. They also text you to let you know when your table is ready which is always nice! The restaurant was very lively with lots of crowds.

Beyond the delicious pizza, the three cheese bread here is a great appetizer to munch on while you wait for your pizza. The service here is just great. Our server was friendly and very accommodating.

I was very impressed with how they handled my experience and what they offered to make it right.  I go to Chicago at least once a quarter and will retry the pizza.",0.8844,0.915,0.075,0.01,0.4046703296703296

2017-04-25,3.0,Over the years there has been a TON of hype about Chicago style deep dish pizza. My family along with myself got together and went on a family reunion slash vacation to Chicago. One of the things that excited is the most was trying true deep-dish pizza. Honestly we were and are truly disappointed about what was put in front of us. The canned tomato sauce that was on top of a artificially butter flavored limp crust was watery and the whole thing lacked any depth of flavor. It was a true letdown. However while at this place we discovered the classic chopped salad. It was to die for! That salad is the only reason that this is above a one star review.

I think our pizza was the equivalent of the ""kitchen sink"" in some other shops, and I'd get it all over again even though I'm usually a one-topping gal.

Got the classic chicago, it has a layer of cheese, sausage, then sauce on top.  The crust was great, very buttery and crisp.  Though before I even took a bite I was pretty certain the tomatoes were frozen, just from the appearance.  I am pretty sure that I'm right after tasting. The sausage was also clearly not fresh, or high quality.  It honestly seemed like that cheap stuff they throw on pizza in high school cafeterias. To me, you have to use quality, fresh ingredients to set your pizza place apart.  I know Lou's is cashing in on the tourist factor and long lasting name.  But as a local (new), I'll be taking my visiting family members to Pequod's in order to show them deep dish in the city.",0.9406,0.779,0.15,0.071,0.5082349000206142

You enter this place, while you wait for a seat, you order your pizza (since it takes about 45 min to make) great idea! So we get in around 1pm..  We were seated probably about 30 minutes later and we order some apps. Apps come out at room temperature. Probably been sitting on the expo window or wherever for a while. We were starving so we just ate them and didn't say anything.  It's about 2:15 now - still no pizza. People all around are all getting theirs before us, so I ask them to check on it for us. They bring out this pizza. It's 2:30 now, so an hour and 30 min after we had put the order in to begin with. It takes an hour and 30 minutes to make pizza. No joke there's like a watery  substance sloshing on the pizza, probably from the veggies, the pizza looks like it had been sitting out for ages. I already in my head told myself there's no way this pizza is cooked. I have a tiny bite and it's cold. Not sure why you'd even bring this pizza to someone by the way it looked. They clearly rushed this pizza, probably forgot to bring it out, I don't even know, nobody could explain to us why this took so long or why our pizza was so bad. They offered us another pizza which we accepted but at this point we are just over being there for so long. Waited another 30 minutes, finally got another pizza. Was alright. I guess the whole experience overall made me lose my appetite. We watched 3 sets of people sit and leave by the time we finally got to eat. Not how I wanted to spend my day.

Okay self (and life-long New Yorker), you like Chicago style pizza, and it doesn't matter what your family and friends say, you're going to go to bat for it.  My partner and I's first stop on our trip to Chicago was Lou Malnati's. It came recommended as the best of the bunch to try deep dish and a location was conveniently located near our hotel. First, I had no idea that these deep dish Chicago pizzerias were more like chains (atmosphere reminded me of New York's UNO locations), which already creates this allure that there's nothing particular special or authentic about it. And while I must agree that message carried on through our meal, I still really loved the Chicago classic with sausage, veggies, ripened tomato, and crispy butter crust. There was just something comforting about it, rich but not overly so, solid cheese, tasty lean sausage, served nice and steamy. For the price the portion seems enormous, and although there's a bit of a cook-time wait, it's well worth the extra minutes. I think we need to bury this age old battle of which pizza champions the other - they're different and satisfying in their own right.

And that is because I have never been to Chicago and never trusted anything deemed ""Chicago style pizza."" After extensive research and gaining approval from some locals, my husband and I settled on Lou's. We were not sure how much pizza to order because we can typically devour a large thin crust pizza. So we figured 2 smalls would allow us to indulge while having the chance to get a couple different kinds. We opted for plain cheese deep dish and the Malnati classic pie. The classic was by far our favorite but the cheese was so good as well. In the end, we did not finish the two smalls but we came pretty damn close. The result was us being extremely full until bedtime that evening (lol!) It was definitely all that cheese! It was layer upon layer of thick, warm, gooey cheese and I do not regret one bite regardless of how large my food baby was.  The service was quick, friendly, attentive, and honest. I say honest because they tell you that the pizza will take about 45 mins to cook (if you're ordering deep dish...and I don't know how you couldn't!) So, take that 45 minutes to drink a couple beers and build up the anticipation of great pizza to come.  I loved everything about that pizza. So thick and unlike any pizza I've ever tried before. I am so sad that I've waited so long to try this style pizza but I am so glad it was at a place that clearly is doing something right.

I'm no expert.  In fact, this was my first EVER experience with deep dish, which is why I'm so disappointed that it was bad.  We read every review and weighed about 5 different pizza places, ultimately narrowing it down to Lou Malnati's and Giordano's.  We picked Lou's because everyone said to.  We called up friends who are from Chicago, we read reviews that said that Chicago natives all seem to prefer Lou's. The crust was crunchy, not soft at all, anywhere, and a little bit mealy.  (This was the butter crust, ordered ""just right"").  It also tasted somewhat of baking soda--it had that off, objectionable taste I get when I try, and fail, to make homemade dough.  Despite the fact that we ordered extra sauce, what we got was basically nothing (and I'm not suggesting they forgot).  It tasted of nothing but stewed tomatoes--no flavor or seasoning almost at all!  The cheese was good, although there was too much of it in relation to the sauce. Worst of all, the entire pie altogether was only about an inch thick at most.  If that's what deep dish is, I suspect I prefer New England greek-style pizza--but I'm holding out hope for a better future, when I'll come back to Chicago and order Giordano's or something.",0.4503,0.859,0.074,0.067,0.4965767367553081

Such anticipation! I expected something sublime after hearing people gush about the place. So I took my first bite, and...bleh. What a huge disappointment. First of all, it seemed like it was only half-cooked. I like my pizza sizzling, with big beautiful crusty bubbles of cheese, and this pie was mushy and covered with very wet, sloppy tomatoes. Second, it was so bland; it badly needed salt, and some oregano and basil wouldn't have hurt either. Third, one slice seemed like a pound of food; it was way too heavy and sodden. So next I tried the thin-crust plain cheese. I liked that even less. It was tasteless! One of our out-of-town attendees asked me if I could get the salt shaker out of the kitchen, and he was right. The crust is completely tasteless. Blech. Pizza is a very personal thing; just because I didn't like this doesn't mean you won't. It's worth a try. But for me, if I never eat another piece of Malnati's, that's just fine with me. In the Giordano's/Malnati's face-off, put me on the Giordano's team.

The wait staff was nice. But 40 mins from the time you place you order until they bring the pizza?  That's ridiculous.  And this was during a non-busy time on Sunday just before noon. The night before, we had gone there for dinner -- a 40 min wait, plus pizza-making time.  Time to take out? 40 mins.  Time to deliver? 1 hr 45 mins. The staff was up-front about it, to their credit.  But this is not some one-of-a-kind restaurant...  It's not the cronut, or tickets to Hamilton.  Sheeeesh... In NYC, they would have figured out a way to get you your deep dish pizza in under 40 mins.  Or they would have been out of business. So, three stars.  If you want appetizers before your pizza, this is a fine place.  Or, if you want to finish those last 80 pages of James Joyce's Ulysses in a setting in which you won't be disturbed for a while, this is fine.  But otherwise, go to Portillos and enjoy the char-grilled sausage with grilled onions...   It won't satisfy your pizza craving, but you'll be on your way to your next stop a lot more quickly.",0.6996,0.882,0.08,0.037,0.5190476190476191

I ordered a personal Chicago Classic pie with added Roma tomatoes for delivery, and I was not disappointed.  First off, the butter crust is absolutely delicious. Probably my favorite deep dish crust I've ever had, and I was pretty in love with Patxi's (in California) version. This version is sweet and flaky, almost like half crust and half pastry. Unfortunately though, like pastry, it got a bit soggy. I thought it was the moisture from the tomatoes, but from reading others' similar reviews it sounds like the mozzarella is so moist that it bleeds into the crust and doesn't keep it crispy. I didn't mind it terribly, though; it was still delicious.  The cheese is fresh, well-melted, and perfectly portioned. There was plenty of it, but I never felt like I was getting just a mouthful of goop. Toppings were SUBLIME. That sausage is one of the best I've had on pizza, and the Roma tomatoes were exquisitely fresh. You can tell that they put a lot of care into their ingredients, and it pays off! I really didn't notice any sauce underneath my tomatoes, and from what I read in other reviews the sauce layer is pretty thin. But what amount there is, I was happy with it because I felt that the pie had a great amount of depth in flavor and seasoning. Lots of different notes going on. The delivery was at the tail end of the 15-minute window I asked for when I ordered online, but still on time.

This place was highly recommended, and by the look of the crowds waiting to get in, was popular among the locals as well. One thing that's really awesome about this place is that they let you pre-order your pizza (because they take up to 50-minutes to cook) so that it's ready to be set at the table when it's finally your turn snag some seats. With our group of five on a Thursday night, it was a 45-minute wait even around 8PM, so we enjoyed each others company while grabbing a few drinks at their bar. What I liked is that within a few minutes of being seated, pizza magically made its way to the tables and we were ready to eat. We got two medium sausage and pepperoni pizzas to share as well as a salad to break up the gluttonous amount of cheese we were about to indulge in. The salad was a great starter and that pizza was nothing to scoff at. The crust was super buttery and they didn't skimp on the meaty toppings. Two pieces are enough for most, but because I was starving, I went for three. I felt like I was pregnant for the rest of the night, but didn't regret any of the bites I had to force myself to take.

What Lou Malnati's does that's wonderful is they will take your order if you call ahead and put your pizza in the oven so that it is ready or almost ready when you do get a table and sit. So call ahead they are helpful! You can't go wrong on what pizza you want. The Classic is always a great go to option if you have never been there before. If you create your own pizza always ask for the butter crust! They also are able to do gluten free crust for any food sensitivities someone in your family might have. Stick to their recommendations I have found a large is just the perfect amount for four people and their is usually a piece left over. Eating two deep crust pieces is like eating four regular pizza slices anywhere else if you ask me. If you are dining in they will cut and serve the first slice for the family.

It was some combination of anticipation and hunger and the fact that it's PIZZA, the greatest thing on the planet, that really drove the experience home. Deep dish is the best pizza hands down and my review is a reflection of that bias. We ordered the Malnati Chicago classic. I'm not one of those people who doesn't eat the crust and, to me, the butter crust was excellent, one of the best I've ever had.  Service was good.

We went here on a Wednesday night around 6pm, so it wasn't too crowded. However, around 7pm, all the booths and tables were filled, so try to get here early if you can. The booths are extremely comfortable and the service at Lou Malnati's is quite good because the waiters are attentive and even slice the deep dish pizza for you. The GF and I ordered a medium sized Malnati Chicago Classic and the chocolate chip pizza for dessert. In regards to the deep dish pizza, the Malnati Chicago Classic was amazing, it came loaded with sausage and the crust was out of this world. The cheese was well melted and extremely flavorful. Initially, the medium size pizza looked too small for us, but after consuming that beast, it was a total hunger buster! My only complaint about the deep dish pizza at Lou Malanti's is that it is a bit oily (also the 30 minute wait for the pizza to be freshly prepared), but other than that this deep dish pizza was out of this world and I would come back to Chicago just to eat here again. Lastly, the dessert was also pretty good, we got the larger portion of the chocolate chip pizza and it was loaded with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. I would tell them to go easy on the whipped cream because it was an overload. However, the chocolate chip portion was warm and soft, which complemented the ice cream very well.

2017-02-24,3.0,"I was super excited to try real Chicago deep dish for the first time. Let me start off by explaining how much I LOVE bread. It is the very essence of life to me. The crispiness it can give and also softness and when extra butter is involved... Ohhh man. So yes, I LOVE bread. Now, one of my favorite things to eat is pizza. I mean, it has bread (super important), but you also get other yummy items like tomato sauce, mushrooms, peppers, different types of meats, etc all in one dish. You'll noticed I didn't mention cheese and that's because I'm anti-cheese, but for pizza I will tolerate it.  OK, onto my experience. The wait was ridiculously long. It's a famous place so I understand and we had 6 people so OK, I get it. But what confused me the most was them explaining we can order while we wait... But they don't actually start making it until we actually sat down and even then we have to wait for someone to confirm the order. What was the point then?? It was about an hour wait for us. Then when we got seated, waited another 5 mins for them to get us water 4/5 waters and then confirm our order. And then another hr to get the food. Hmm... If the food is good, I guess the wait is worth it. But, no. It wasn't. Pizza came, we ordered deep dish and thin slice so we could try both. The servers were really weird... I would think they'd just leave the pizza on the table and let us dig in, but insisted on cutting all the slices and serving them to us... OK, no big deal. That's nice I guess. BUT once everyone got a slice of each, there were of course still some slices left and they just stood there staring at us like they wanted someone to take the rest... Why not just leave the rest on the table??? They eventually did... But I just thought that this process was just really strange. Anyways, so the pizza. Pretty disappointing. It wasn't crispy and buttery like many people state and also barely any tomato sauce. The inside of the dough seemed like it could use some extra time in the oven to cook more. And the toppings... More like what toppings?? Cheese, again I'm not fond of, but even I know that wasn't good. My husband who LOVES cheese as much as I love bread said it wasn't good. So yeah... Not sure if it was an off day for them cause everyone else seems to rave about this place, but I definitely would not come back. Especially with that wait. No thanks.

2017-02-20,1.0,"Over the last six months, I've ordered delivery of a small, Buttercrust, Cheese & Sausage Pizza, and an order of Buffalo Chicken Wings, to an Elmhurst address. The pizza always arrived in a perfect state, but the Buffalo Wings were always a toss up. Were they cooked correctly? Were they overdone or underdone? Were they dry from to little Buffalo sauce, or would they have the proper amount of sauce? When I first started ordering wings, they came out perfect. But now six months in, I never know what I'm going to get. On my last order, I ordered two orders. When they were Delivered, the packages were cold, and it wasn't because the delivery took to long. It was because the wings weren't cooked long enough. After delivery, I bit into the wings, which were pink and raw. I contacted the Elmhurst Manager, and didn't ask for a replacement. I just wanted Rosie to know that the cooks aren't consistent. I have a credit for two orders of wings, but I won't use it, because I no longer trust that location. I'm not sure, but either they changed suppliers or cooks, and both are not doing a good job. I'll go to BWW for wings in the future. I'll trust Lou's for pizza, but not anything else. In six months, I can't get a decent order of wings. That's my opinion, and only mine. But I've been a Kitchen Manager in the past and have dealt with this type of problem. I'd like to contact the owners, but don't have their contact info. I'm no longer going to use Lou's as a supplier. I simply cave trust them, and those two orders of underdone wings cost over $20.  I can no longer spend that money on inferior food. It just costs to much not to be done right. I only wish that upper management would drop in on this stores and review the cooking practice, so that the practice was uniform from store to store, because  sure it isn't, at least from my multiple experiences. The Manager, Rosie, knows who I am. But even after this, even though I have credit, I won't be contacted. I'm one person. I'm not important. Just order pizza. The other items are hit or miss. If I were management, I'd be looking at staffing, because I don't believe they share the vision of the company. I know I'd be very engaged in it as a former Kitchen Manager for the Howard Johnson's chain, The Ground Round. We always listened to our clients. Always.",0.4142,0.839,0.076,0.085,0.4809862976529644

2017-02-20,3.0,"I had high expectations. The wait was the worse for pizza on a Saturday night. Probably waited about an hour outside, received a text to come inside and wait more. They had me order pizza before going in to be seated because that's how they operate and said it takes time to make the pizza. To order other food that's not pizza, you have to be seated. Once seated we waited about 40 minutes or it seemed longer than that for wings to come out. The wings were really good and thick, plenty of meat and sauce, but it's weird how they came with no carrots and only had celery.  I loved the wings better than their pizza! Chicago style deep dish pizza was good but not amazing. The crust was crunchy but hard to cut through since they suggest you eat it with a fork and knife. I like eating pizza with my hand and cheese to be melted or fully cooked but this one was not. The cheese was stretchy and doughy not done baking? The pepperoni was weak on flavor and not many toppings. I'm just really surprised or not use to this type of pizza. I ordered half Lou and half Malnati and they almost tasted identical. Everything was excess cheese which is too much for me but that's not bad. I was expecting the pizza to be thicker and deeper as I've seen on television and YouTube research. The pizza arriving to the table was another hour wait after my appetizer of wings came which is horrible wait time for a small order of pizza!! The waitress even said ""your pizza will be out in 2 minutes"", liar. I'm just being nice with 3 stars because I really liked the wings.",0.9203,0.799,0.116,0.085,0.5887179487179487

2017-02-19,5.0,"If you didn't try deep dish pizza, did you really even go to Chicago? It was hard narrowing down a single pizzeria to visit during our trip, but a lot of Yelp lists and locals seem to like Lou Malnati's. We came on a Thursday night, and there was no wait for a party of two. I loved the atmosphere -- very Chicagoan and classic. Our server was friendly and made some great recommendations. And just a warning - deep dish pizzas take about 30 minutes to make, at least here, so this is definitely not the place for a quick bite. Stuffed Spinach Bread: 5/5. Knowing we'd be waiting a while for our food, our server recommended ordering an appetizer to nibble on in the meantime. The Stuffed Spinach Bread was small, but so flaky and delicious. I could've eaten five of them. It wasn't so much ""bread"" as it was a crust - it was like a Hot Pocket, if he went off to college and became a successful businessman. Malnati Chicago Classic Deep Dish Pizza: 4/5. This was our first time having deep dish pizza ever, but our hopes were high because we're pretentious. Unfortunately my lactose intolerance meant I could only have a few bites, but I got the gist...very delicious crust (their signature ""Buttercrust"" I believe), lots of tasty meat and gooey cheese center. Really good! It fell slightly short of our expectations because it wasn't as deep as we'd hoped, and the cheese was almost rubbery, which is strange because it shouldn't have been sitting out for long before arriving to our table. Malnati Salad: 5,000/5. AMAZING. BEST SALAD EVER. This salad is huge and definitely for sharing, but I did some damage because it was so dang good. There must be some banned substance in the dressing or something because I couldn't stop eating. I feel bad for my future salads.

Our group of 6 barely made a dent in the serving!   Again the pizza is great, by far my favorite Chicago deep dish.  I will give you another shot Lou, just hopefully not with the same waiter! The most aggressive part was when the food was delivered and he insisted on cutting and serving the pizza out- he barely gave us time to decide what to eat- it was an intense experience!  The only other con is the size of the ""waiting area"" you are essentially crowded in the doorway and when you're told 45 minutes to wait for a table that can be a huge turnoff- probably why it only took us 20 minutes to get seated!",0.9561,0.809,0.128,0.063,0.6118357487922705

2017-02-15,4.0,"My boyfriend and I came here on Saturday a little after 5PM and were seated immediately at a booth. Lou's is a casual, cozy pizza restaurant. We ordered the calamari and a medium deep dish (half The Malnati Chicago Classic and half The Lou - yes you can do half and half!). The appetizer took 25 minutes and the pizza 45 minutes to be served.  Can I please say how the calamari appetizer is literally one of the best calamari I have ever had? When it was served on the table, I was not expecting much already because it looked too crispy and fried. But wow, the combination of the calamari with the house dipping sauce is AMAZING. The dipping sauce is not your typical tomato sauce. It's refreshing and it reminded me a little bit of a mignonette sauce used for raw oysters.  The deep dish itself was tasty too. I liked The Lou more than The Malnati Chicago Classic simply because I'm not a very meaty person. I also don't love to eat cheese... so the triple cheese on The Lou was a little much for me. The tomato sauce that Lou Malnati uses is homemade and so so delicious. If you read the description on their menu, their vine tomatoes are handpicked from California (or something like that). Note that they have suggested portion sizes and I advise you to listen to that. For two, a medium was WAY too big (my boyfriend claimed he could finish it). A small would have been perfect for us and maybe even a little bit leftover still.  The service was also phenomenal, even during the Saturday evening rush at the restaurant. Basically, the homemade tomato sauce and dipping sauce made the experience a great one for me. As we were leaving, there were about 40 people waiting around in the lobby, on the stairs and outside for a table. Good thing we just missed the wait!",0.9887,0.859,0.125,0.016,0.4838670852956568

But, for me, that's where the advantages of Lou's cease.  Lou's deep dish certainly lacks the cheesy goodness and volume of toppings that Giordano's or Art of Pizza boast and it also doesn't have that light fluffy crust that Pequod's can boast. Plus I find the wait, especially at this location, to be much lengthier - Giordano's especially just seems to turn tables a little more quickly. Lou's thin crust is kinda the same story. I just find that the other pizza places offer better options when it comes to thin crust and there are plenty of local mom & pop pizza places with good thin crust.

Fortunately, enough we happened to be in the River North area.  We came with no reservations and was anticipating a line. However, we were coming at the end of the lunch rush on Friday afternoon - just as the restaurant started to turn for dinner. We were able to have a peaceful late lunch looking seated next to the upstairs windows. I guess we kind of got lucky with that.  Our eyes were definitely bigger than our stomachs. We ordered the garlic bread appetizer and a medium Malnati's Classic. We had more than enough food for 2 people. Despite our waitress warning us that the pizza usually serves 4 people, we figured we were that hungry. The garlic bread good as greasy, but tomato dipping sauce helped even it all out. The pizza was absolutely delicious and best eaten warm with the ooey-gooey cheese spilling over. I wished we ordered a salad, just so we would feel better about our gluttony. Packed up the rest of the pizza in a box. Unfortunately, by the time we got back to our apartment the pizza slices had formed into a layered pizza block. Put in the fridge and surprisingly it was delicious cold as well the next day on my flight back.

2017-01-17,5.0,"For dinner on my first night in Chi-town, I knew it had to involve pizza. Deep dish pizza. I've heard the saying that only tourists seek out the famous Chicago-style pizza, but this spot looked like a local's favorite. Lou Malnati's looks like a tavern or pub and has a welcoming vibe. Very patriotic with their sports team memorabilia decorating the walls. The staff is great: super friendly and attentive. The chain restaurant of Lou Malnati's has traditional dishes you'd normally find at an Italian restaurant - with the exception of the pizza. We ordered the fried calamari as an appetizer and the chicken pasta and cheese deep dish pizza for our entree. All enough to share between four people and have some leftovers. The calamari was good - not greasy or overly cooked to the point of overly chewy, just the right amount of chew and crunch. They came with a cocktail dipping sauce. The chicken marsala pasta was delicious: rigatoni pasta covered in a creamy, white sauce mixed in with chunks of chicken breast and mushrooms and topped with shavings of parmesan and slivers of basil. It felt homemade, which is what made it better. The pizza is allotted a certain amount of cooking time which it tells you on the menu, so hopefully you're not in a rush. Either way, it's worth the wait. We ordered the large pizza and only six out of the eight slices. They're thick slices of pizza. Crunchy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside with a hefty amount of cheese and sauce; you'll be happy you waited thirty minutes. Their dessert menu did look enticing, but we were so full from dinner that we could not fathom eating a chocolate chip pizza or tiramisu. I'm sure it was fantastic.

However, being gluten-free (not by choice, trust me, i wish I could smash my way through a Chi-town hot dog/pizza/sammich fest), I figured I'd be relegated to crying sorghum tears over another one-size, flat, cardboardish, probably-bought-from-Udi's-and-marketed-as-""'made daily in house"" pizza.   Damn, I was SO wrong.   So Lou Malnati's gluten-free deep dish isn't really a bread crust; it's made out of sausage.  Hold up. Wait.  Rewind.  A sausage crust available in multiple sizes, you say?  And I don't have to pay $5 extra for it?  Whoooooo Yep. And after careful deliberation, myself and a friend opted for the smaller size (and a two-slice serving was pretty filling). The pie took a bit of time to make, prob 20-30 min, but I'm used to waiting a bit longer for my grub so I was ok with it, besides, I needed to let my three lunches settle anyway.   Once it arrived, the smell of the freshly cooked sausage topped with fresh mozzarella just wafted its way up to my face,  slapped me and said ""Welcome to Lou's!""

We ordered the deep dish and were cautioned by our server that it would probably take about a half hour. We agreed and that would have been great but it took a full hour to get the pie.  It was good.

2016-12-29,4.0,"I decided to come here after a friend recommended it to me to try when I was in Chicago. As a New Yorker, I'm often convinced that New York pizza is the best pizza, period. After this trip, I can honestly say that a fair comparison cannot be honestly made. NY-style pizza and Chicago deep dish are two entirely different things. You eat deep dish with a fork and knife and you eat NY style with your hands. Try to do one or the other and you'll either look weird in NY eating your slice with a fork and knife or you bathe your hands in oil eating deep dish in Chicago with your hands.  Now onto the real review here for Lou Malnati's. I was in town for work and decided to give it a go before heading back to O'Hare. Service in the afternoon was quick and easy and I struck up a conversation with the bartender there that afternoon. He helped me walk through their menu and ultimately convinced me to get the Lou. I got an individual portion just for myself. My oh my, was I surprised to see just how much a small pizza was and how filling it was! The crust was flaky and the sausage was a perfect complement to the pizza, though the oil on the pizza was a bit much at times. Fork and knife definitely needed! The staff's recommendations were spot on and their pizza was something that allowed me to taste something unique to Chicago. I enjoyed the food overall and the service was great. Granted that it wasn't a super busy late Friday afternoon (it was 25 degrees out) I was glad to have been able to eat some good Chicago deep dish while also being able to converse with some locals.

2016-12-21,5.0,"Chicago is known for deep dish pizza and so that was what my friends and I were set out to try. Lou Malnati's was recommended by both of my friends as Giordano's was deemed the tourist trap. We got one small pizza (meant to share between two people). I wanted The Lou for that garlic butter crust but my friends wanted the Classic since it had meat. We were able to compromise and get our pizza ordered half Lou and half Classic.  The wait was expected to be half an hour and usually the small pizza is cut up into four pieces but since we were three people, they asked if we wanted it cut into six pieces instead. I didn't have much expectations for deep dish pizza. I had expected it to be similar to lasagna instead of pizza but I was wrong. The thickness was only about an inch deep and it came in its own personal pan but our server helped served each piece on our plate.  THE LOU This was my favorite simply for those Roma tomatoes. So flavorful with the sauce and three cheeses and the garlic butter crust. If it had meat, it might be even better.  THE MALNATI CHICAGO CLASSIC This was nothing to sniff at either. It pales slightly in comparison to The Lou in my opinion in terms of flavor but since it has sausage, that brings it back up a notch. I ate with a knife and fork and cutting into the crust can be a little difficult. During my last piece, I stabbed my pizza and it popped off my plate. Whoops. 5 second rule. I'm not letting that slice go to waste. I'm usually a thin crust pizza kind of girl but Lou Malnati's is beginning to change my mind on deep dish pizza.",-0.6262,0.868,0.059,0.072,0.43187074829931976

DEEP DISH PIZZA: the pizza came out a little underdone.  I would have liked the dough to be more cooked, but it came out a little doughy and floury.  The menu does say you can request the pizza your way but I didn't know what standard was but if I knew it was undercooked pizza i would have requested it be well done dough. Loved the sausage topping. The Small doesn't give you as much a feel for deep dish since it's really only 4 pieces.  It's not a stuffed pizza though. Ask for ranch dressing.  Well if you like it, but dipping the crust in ranch dressing is so good. Liked this place way better than Giordano's.  One thing Giordano's had going for it was that you can order your pizza as soon as you check in, so even if you wait 45 minutes, your pizza is starting to get fired up so when you sit down, you don't have to wait as long.  Giordano's has more of a ""stuffed"" feel to it and way cheesier, but the flavor for Lou Malnati's was better for me.

However, we were disappointed with the pizza. The crust was bland and definitely not buttery considering that they call it their ""buttercrust"", and the cheese and toppings were just alright.

2016-11-07,4.0,"First the good stuff:  I am a long time Chicago area native, this is my favorite deep dish.  Love the crust(I like the regular better than the buttercrust upgrade).  Always order a sausage, mushroom, onion - but like some of the other reviewers, don't like the way they have the sausage as one large piece the same diameter as the pizza.  The flavor is great, so we order it with ""sausage crumbles"" to take care of the too much sausage ratio.  The salad was good, really enjoy our meal every time! Now the part that pissed me off:  the greeter at the door.  As we were leaving our musical at 10:30, I called to see if there was a long wait (if so we had the option of carry-out as our condo is very close by), and told no wait.  When we arrived, there was no waiting line, but told the wait was 35-45 minutes.  ""A party of 9 just showed up"".  Not pleased, but no big deal, just bad luck.  As I went to the restroom on the first floor, I saw a round table with 6 chairs, and asked this ""greeter"" if we could squeeze 7, rather than stand waiting 35 min or longer to sit down.  Again no one else waiting.  He said no, just go to the bar and get a drink.  OK, I understand.  I walked upstairs to the other restroom(first floor had a wait), and at the top of the stairs was a beautiful table big enough for 7-10, and a few other 4 tops all open, bused and ready.  As i came back downstairs, I tried to think how I could ask again without being obnoxious.  3 employees were standing at the desk talking, so I waited.  The ""Greeter"" was looking straight ahead and would not acknowledge me, so I thought maybe he was on the phone or something.  No, just rude.  I kept waiting.  A nearby manager asked if I needed something, and before I could answer, my greeter friend said ""no, he's just going around the restaurant trying to find a table, and I already told him to wait at the bar.""  He still wouldn't talk or acknowledge me.  That is when I got pissed me off.  I wanted to leave, but my family is much nicer than I am, and the manager said he would take care of it.  5 minutes later we were seated and had a great meal and night. I understand how I could be perceived, but this guy was just an ass with a bad attitude.  We love the pizza so much I stopped the next day to pickup a frozen one to take back to Michigan.  I was hoping to see my greeter friend, but my wife was glad he was not there.  OK, I feel better now...

Secondly, they told us that we would have a long wait time however we did not experience that. We got there during the dinner rush on a Saturday night and we waited 15 minutes when they said it would be 45.

We came here pretty late on a Friday and expected a long wait. Our wait ended up only being a little more than an hour. We were able to easily get to the bar to get drinks while we waited and even ordered our pepperoni deep dish (I had not previously known this was ordinary since the pizza takes so long to cook). Once we sat down we ordered another round of drinks and a salad. The reason I knocked a star off is because the second drink (Moscow Mule) I received was not very good. I continued to drink it as I really dislike complaining at a restaurant unless absolutely necessary. I think instead of vodka, gin was used. We ordered the Malnati Salad and it was really good. We all expected to eat a little bit then prepare for our pizza, but I am pretty sure we all went back for at least seconds. The salad was in a giant bowl and was perfect for a table to share. Finally came the moment we were all waiting for, the ZA! I was mesmerized by it and was very happy when the first slice out landed on my plate. It had the absolute perfect ratio between crust, sauce, cheese, and pepperoni. My eyes were bigger than my stomach and I assumed I would eat 2 slices. I barely made it through the first and was completely full and satisfied.  Their large pizza was the perfect amount for 4 people, we had 3 women and 1 guy.

Once inside it expands into a back room as well so it offers more space that you would expect. But due to high demand if their oh so gooey pizza it's pretty packed with tables and a full bar.   The place was hoping when we got there so we had to wait for about 15 minutes before we were sat. Which was fine. But once sat our sever was Kady and she was great! So busy but was definitely on her toes and was keeping up well.   My boyfriend and I ordered a glass of wine each and decided to split an order of fried cheddar cheese balls, on my request. They came out nice and warm served with marina sauce, and they were very good! A good option other than just motz sticks. We ordered our pizza, a small deep dish with sausage, onion, spinach, garlic, basil and tomato sauce. It came out fresh out of the oven and was sliced right at our table and plopped hot and oozing with cheese onto our plates for us! If this wasn't Chicago style deep dish then I don't know what is?

2016-10-21,4.0,"This was highly recommended to me as a first time visitor to Chicago. Wait here is not absurd, about 1 hr for me coming in as a solo diner on Friday evening. They're nice enough to take your order ahead of time and also take your number to text you when your table becomes available. They provide you with a link to a website that tells your position, which i thought was very useful. I started at position like 50 something? Not sure how accurate it is as I got seated when my position on the website was at about 10. Anyway, good marker that would allow you to walk around and come back in time. Make sure you do come back in time, they allow you 5 min to show up when your table is called otherwise you forfeit it.  I got the classic pizza or something that has sausage and their ""famous"" butter crust in a personal size. It's a pretty reasonable prize at about $12. One of the best pizzas I've tasted flavor wise, not sure how they did it, but I was quite impressed. This place easily would have earned 5-stars but I felt they messed up either accidentally or intentionally. The pizza I received was warm, not hot. And by warm, I mean the cheese didn't have the melted or gooey effect I usually expect from a pizza place. Rather the cheese stretched a tiny bit before tearing. Unsure if this was how pizza was normally served in this style, I ate at Giordano's and they served the pizza much hotter than Lou's.

If it was too busy, they were understaffed, or for some reason that escapes me, but our experience was less than par that left a sour taste in my mouth. The wait was expected, but what wasnt was the seating of multiple 4 tops before my party even though we clearly put our name down first. It was only until I went inside and ask the hostess about it was when we finally got a table. Maybe it was really coincidental that our table just came up when I decided to ask, who knows.  Next our server took an exceedingly long time to take our order. Now my qualm is not with her service, but the speed of the service. She herself was extremely nice and helpful, but it seemed that she was second guessing and taking her sweet time despite the rush. We put our order in before we were seated per request of the hostess in the beginning, and was told by our server that it would take 15 minutes to come out. IT TOOK AN HOUR. Tables around us got theirs before us, and to top it off, it was WARM. It was cooled to the point that I was able to pick up the metal pan with my bare hand and the inside most of the pizza was cold. They reheated it for us and gave us a free dessert, but by no means did it compensate for the time we lost waiting for a table and our pizza. We didn't account for the extra hour that we lost instead of exploring Chicago's secrets.  Maybe our experience was a bad one, and I hope no one else has to wait that long for anything here.

I was expecting this to be a disappointing Friday night experience, but I heard that this is one of the better popular deep dish spots in town.  While waiting for our table to be ready (a one hour wait), we decided it would be best to order the pizza 30 minutes into the wait (that way it would be ready relatively close to when we were seated).  Ordered the vegetarian deep dish (forget the name because I was definitely tipsy at the bar by that time).

2016-09-29,3.0,"The Chicago-style deep-dish pizza we had at Lou Malnati's was OK. If you order a deep-dish pizza, be prepared for about a 45-minute wait. It takes a while for these pizzas to be prepared. The menu says the pizzas take 30 minutes, but our wait was closer to an hour. I actually had my first Lou Malnati's deep-dish pizzas in Atlanta -- they were shipped to me as gifts through Lou Malnati's Tastes of Chicago ( yelp.com/biz/tastes-of-c… ). I tried both a pepperoni and a sausage deep-dish pizza and they were delicious. The pizzas I had at home and the pizza I tried in the restaurant were very similar. I don't know if that's a good thing or bad thing considering how terrible I am in the kitchen (even with frozen food). This Lou Malnati's is located in the River North neighborhood of Chicago. It's a little over a half-mile walk from the south end of The Magnificent Mile (about a 12-15 minute walk). I chose this place for our group for lunch because it had a 4-star rating on Yelp with about 3,000 reviews. I would consider this place touristy. We showed up on a Monday around 2:30pm, hardly a peak time, and it was still busy. There's both indoor and covered outdoor seating. We were seated in the dining room in the back where there are booths and tables. They've tried to cram as many people in this space as (un)comfortably possible. It was such a tight fit that servers were constantly brushing up against us throughout the duration of our meal. When we first sat down, one of the servers accidentally painfully poked my friend in the arm with a pen. SMH. The atmosphere is casual. The dining room has TVs playing sports and Chicago sports memorabilia (mainly jerseys) adorn the walls. The restaurant sells both deep-dish and thin crust pizza. They come in four sizes from personal to large (serves 4). The standard pizzas have simple ingredients: cheese, sausage, and pepperoni. The cheese comes from Wisconsin, the sausage is local (not sure about the pepperoni), and the tomatoes come from California. They have a veggie deep-dish as well as their trademarked ""Buttercrust"" which you can add at an additional cost ($0.75 per pizza) plus over 10 additional enhancements/toppings if you so desire. In addition to pizza, they have appetizers like bruschetta and calamari; soups, salads, pastas, sandwiches, and desserts. We went with the ""Malnati Chicago Classic,"" small size (serves 2) for $14.95. FYI, a personal runs $9.45 and a large runs $24.95. The Malnati Chicago Classic is made with sausage, extra cheese, tomato sauce, and Buttercrust. While the pizza was good, it didn't seem exceptional to me. I was actually expecting there to be even more cheese (out to the edge of the deep-dish pan) and I was expecting the crust and cheese to be burnt in places. Instead, the crust had hardly any char whatsoever and tasted rather plain. The Buttercrust was noticeably richer than plain dough though. Admittedly, I think I was expecting more of a cheesy caramelized crust like those served at Pequod's. Overall, I thought the quality of the pizza and its ingredients were fine. Other items we ordered included a medium Caesar salad with grilled chicken for $8.75 and an order of the ""BuffaLou"" chicken wings for $8.95. They were alright too. The Caesar was made with Romaine lettuce, lean chicken strips, chopped tomato, shaved Parmesan cheese (a healthy amount), and crunchy croutons tossed in Caesar dressing. Six wings came to an order of the BuffaLou wings (on the apps menu) with celery and ranch dressing on the side. These were basically your standard buffalo wings that were slightly spicy. The staff was friendly and welcoming. If you've never had deep-dish pizza in Chicago before, Lou Malnati's is one of the classic places to get it. According to the menu, this location in River North is the oldest (established 1986) of its four city locations. Another place to consider is competitor Giordano's.

Good suggestion because it's the perfect walking distance from Navy pier, Millennium Park, and other sightseeing touristy spots.

I got the Chicago Classic - lean sausage, tomato sauce, cheese on buttercrust - and it was good, but nothing life-changing.

Anyway, we picked up our pizza (a small) for two and then took a Lyft to Navy Pier and ate there.   We found the crust to be plain (compared to the other place we reviewed), we found that there was virtually no sauce, and we found the pizza just to be rather plain and not that great tasting.   Again, our opinion; however, not impressed.",0.5071,0.864,0.073,0.063,0.5017857142857143

So, it doesn't really mean what they say it means.  The pizza was amazing and we got 2 mediums for the 4 of us to enjoy a good 2 slices and have leftovers. This is also good for larger groups as the pizzas take the same amount of time to bake, rather than ordering a large and a small.

This is one of the greatest pizza staples in the entire Chicagoland area. They are renowned for their deep dish, and it is truly excellent. One of the more out of the norm things they do is their sausage deep dish pizza- you don't get little chunks of sausage, there is a giant, unbroken wheel of it! Sausage in every bite! If you are looking for something other than deep dish, they have some other great options for you: their thin crust is great, with great thin slices and a very crunchy crust to top it off. If pizza is not your thing, they make a ridiculously good Caesar salad (just don't count the calories, you may hate yourself). My personal favorite here is ""The Lou"" which is a buttercrust deep dish pizza with mushrooms, spinach, tomatoes, three cheeses, and a blend of spices that compliment it all perfectly. If you want to experience true Chicago pizza, this is one of the top two. Be warned, as it is so wildly popular, it can get very crowded.

Though the closest I've ever had to a deep dish was Pizzeria Uno. So of Course being in Chicago, my dining partner and I had to try the Deep Dish Chicago Pizza which Chicago is famous for. We arrived for lunch on a Thursday at 11:00 a.m. as not having to wait as I've read that wait time can be long. Believe it or not at 11:00 a.m. we got the last available table. Our server Sam introduced herself, took our drink orders while we looked over the menu. We ordered the Medium Malnati Salad and the Personal Pan Cheese Buttercrust Pizza. The salad was excellent. The Pizza was good, very thick and cheesy. I just have a personal preference for Pizza styles, but I'm so glad I've had a taste of the best Deep Dish pizza Chicago has to offer.

We have had Lou Malnati's catered to my office several times and I loved their thin crust pizza!! Sadly, whenever my boyfriend and I try to order deep dish at home, it falls short of delicious/edible. On Valentines day, we ordered the heart pizza and it came soggy and very undercooked. We informed the store of this and received a gift card in return, which was a very nice gesture by the manager of the Gold Coast location. Last night, we decided to give it another try and we ordered a large deep dish with lots of delicious sounding toppings: pepperoni, garlic, mushroom, olives, extra cheese, and buttercrust, cooked well done and uncut (per the previous managers suggestions)!! WE WERE SO EXCITED. However, our excitement quickly faded when we started eating the pizza only to find it covered with a thin slice of sausage covering the entire slice/pizza! I have a strong distaste for sausage and decided..ok..I'll just take it off and enjoy the rest of the cheesy goodness. FAIL. When you take the sausage off, it takes off the entire top of the pizza including the sauce and olives, etc. I was so disappointed. As much as I wanted to love it, I think I'll stick with Peaquod's for my deep dish cravings from now on. :(",0.9889,0.764,0.186,0.05,0.6041496598639455

We went pretty early in the day and we were seated immediately. I ordered a sausage thin crust and my wife got the personal sausage deep dish. This pizza was different than anything else I have had. The deep dish butter crust was so good, and the cheese was just an amazing ratio. I pretty much ate half my wife's pizza and then 3/4s of mine (I had to share).

However, we started out the day early and hunger struck, so we checked this place out, unaware that it's an institution. Being early and not realizing how lucky we were, there was no line and we were quickly seated. The attentive waiter informed us that if we were getting deep dish, we would have a bit of a wait for the food to prepare, so we split a sizable garden salad as an appetizer. The pizza, which we also split, was absolutely delicious - fresh and perfectly seasoned tomato sauce, excellent, crisp and tender crust, and tasty mozzarella. I couldn't believe I almost missed out on this treat and I highly recommend it to those who, like me, are otherwise close-minded about deep-dish. No, it's not traditional, but it's its own thing. Also, it is absolutely filling and powered us for the rest of the day. I recommend going early, because soon after we were seated, this place filled up very quickly!

2016-08-03,3.0,"My father and I got there on a Tuesday night and were told to expect a 15-20 minute wait. Not bad, we figured it represented how good the restaurant was. They asked us to give a phone number and said they would text us when they were ready to seat us, and to place our pizza orders at the counter to expedite our food getting to us when we were seated. Going off of that, we placed our order (a simple large deep dish cheese pizza) and decided to go for a short walk in the immediate vicinity since it was our first night in town, it maybe took us about ten minutes. We hadn't received a text yet but decided to head back anyway. We got back and waited an additional twenty. At this point we figured it wouldn't hurt to ask if the wait time had increased. They said they called us for our table already. Huh!? They told us they would *text* us. Not too big a deal, they sat us at the next table for two, but if we hadn't asked we probably would have been waiting in the dark for a lot longer. Poor communication on their part. We were seated and the server was incredibly cheerful and friendly. She appeared to have a couple of large parties in addition to us so although the service wasn't lightning fast, it was definitely fast enough given how busy she was. She took our drink orders, it took some time to get our beer because they were changing the kegs, which was poor timing but had nothing to do with the service of the restaurant. However, the food took a very long time to come out, which was odd to me seeing they took our order about 40 minutes before we were even seated to *avoid* the food taking too long. And when it came out, it was lukewarm. For a pizza that doughy, we both agreed it lacked flavor. I wouldn't say it was worth the wait. Overall, I give it three stars for fair pricing and excellent service, but the wait for the table due to lack of communication on the part of the restaurant and the lukewarm/bland food soured our experience.

So we told them we had not gotten our pizza and there was no way we could have gotten our pizza because there was no way the delivery driver would have been let up into our building. So then they called back and now the story changed to our driver had brought our pizza back to the restaurant and it was going back out for delivery. They refunded our card- which was good because obviously they should. 30 minutes later the delivery guy calls. My husband went downstairs to get the pizza and the story changes yet again. The driver said he called our phone number when he arrived (this is a lie) and a lady answered (also a lie). He had my husbands cell phone number. We were all sitting watching a movie.

The nice thing is that they will text you when your table to ready so you don't have to wait inside necessarily. Since I was a party of 1 I decided to take my chances and wait by the bar as a backup plan because it's open seating there. Right when a seat opened up I was notified my table was available. The hostess said that there were no more couples on the waitlist left so they had a table for me. Not sure how I felt about that comment, but was glad I would have a table instead of being crammed at the bar. I was pretty set on just ordering a pizza but the server told me that it would be at least 45 minutes unless I pre-ordered at the hostess stand. I wish I would've known that.

I think Lou's deep dish has just the right amount of cheese. Other places serve deep dish with extremely thin crust and a pie full of cheese, Lou's crust is just a little bit thicker, which evens out the ratio of cheese to dough in every bite. I  also really like Lou's sauce. And their ""Lou's salad"" is wonderful. To top it all off, they have individual pizzas! They cost $6 and are a perfect dinner for one.

The staff was all smiles and made us feel like stars. The restaurant was packed, but we were seated very quickly. Our server/waitress was a young girl and she was great. She seemed like the happiest person in the world when taking our orders and serving us.   I ordered a pepperoni deep dish pan pizza with sausage and mushrooms. Once I finally tasted the pizza, I instantly thought of all the ""Chicago-styled"" pizza places that I have visited over the years and how their pizza DOES NOT measure up to this authentic Chicago deep dish pizza from Chicago. I definitely see what the hype is all about. If I were not a fan of Chicago deep dish pizza, I was after eating at Lou Malnati's Pizzeria. OUTSTANDING PIZZA!

Definitely go there and put your name on the list then go shopping or walk around. Don't go hungry expecting to eat right away. Their system is very efficient though. They'll call you when they're ready and you also pre-order your pizza so it is already cooking by the time you sit down.  The pizza itself was pretty good. They're know for their butter crust which was the most interesting part. We got the Classic and it had sausage, pepperoni, cheese and lots of tomato sauce. Overall, it was crunchy on the edges, fluffy in the middle, piping hot and amazing on the top. The medium doesn't look like a lot when it comes out but after two slices I was stuffed.

The sausage was well seasoned and the inconsistency in size (as found in crumbled sausage), complemented the cohesiveness of the pizza, giving it that homemade feel.

Thankfully we order some wings which came out within 15-20 min, no pizza... so we patiently waited another 20-30 minutes and noticed other tables seated after us got their pizza,  I decided to ask another waitress since our waitress never came back to check on us after we got the wings.

Why did I get pizza chips if I was going to order pizza as an entree, you ask? Yeah, I'd question myself too, but I thoroughly enjoyed it!

We arrived at 7:30 on a Friday night and we KNEW that there was going to be a wait.  However, it was a rather chilly May evening and everyone tried to stay inside and therefore made it very difficult to get to the hostess as well as find a place to stand and wait.

2016-06-20,4.0,"Rewind to a few years back...my first time in Chicago, a group of us wanted taste the Rivalry between Lou Malnatis and Giordanos first hand. We've heard that each establishment claims to be the ""best."" We had come to the conclusion that Giordano's was the better Pizza once and for all.  Fast forward to a few days ago when a new group of friends came to Chicago with me and we decided to leave it up to them to decide for themselves. However, it was a little tougher this time for me and my other friend that was with me the first time around. While the sauce is robust, spicy and more flavorful than Lou's, Giordanos delievered an abundance of cheese (layered to perfection) with thinly sliced pepperoni... but the crust was a little bit more dry and mealy than I remember.  On the other hand, Lou's had the most incredible buttery, flaky crust. It was absolutely delicious. I do NOT remember the pizza being so good last time. It could have been that we ordered in last time and maybe this type of pizza is better served hot, and fresh. While Lou's doesn't serve up a crazy amount of cheese like Giordano's, nor is the sauce as robust,  it's still superb! The sausage was also fantastic here (I normally don't order sausage on pizza but we ordered ""the classic"")  it was thinly sliced and layered so precisely with every other layer including cheese, and pepperoni. Omg it was delicious!  So I've come to stand still, to which family owned Pizzeria serves up the best deep dish. Both are fantastic and both are affordable as a family of 4 can fill up on a medium pie. While the prices may seem steep ($20-$30) you can, and probably will be, stuffed with 1 slice. I thought I was going to be pizza-d out for awhile and as I type this, I'm already craving a slice...Lou Malnatis for the Tie!",0.997,0.805,0.192,0.003,0.5389354066985645

We were given an estimated 1 hour wait so we grabbed a drink and hung out outside. There's barely any waiting room inside which seems silly to me for a restaurant that is almost always on a wait. We lucked out by waiting outside as their patio is first come first serve, something they didn't tell us at the host stand. You would think that would be the first thing they say, to hopefully keep the wait down. They do allow you to pre-order your pizza, since the deep dish pizzas take up to 45 minutes, which helps a lot. Our server was slammed but she was great and their bottles of wine are cheap. The spinach bread is a great appetizer and their regular size salads are huge! After an app and salad, my BF and I split a personal size pizza, advertised as for 1, and it was more than enough.

I'm not typically a fan of deep dish pizza, but I guess it's because I never had Lou Malnatis.  The crust is just crisp enough and buttery that you don't feel like you're getting a full mouth of dough. The ingredients on the pizza were outstanding.  They told us the wait was an hour and we only ended up waiting around 45 minutes. On a Saturday in downtown Chicago, that's not too shabby.  Portions were great. My husband and I each got our own personal size and each only ate about half.  As long as you preorder your meal during your wait (which they suggest you do when you put your name on the waiting list) the wait for the food to hit the table when you sit down is substantially minimized.  They take your number and you're texted when your table is ready.  As far as the ambiance goes, it was very loud in the restaurant but it was mostly background and didn't affect my husband and I from having a good conversation.  Pricing wise, we got two soft drinks, a beer, the calamari appetizer, and two personal pizzas for $42. For how good the pizzas were, that's a steal.  I wouldn't order the calamari again, it wasn't crunchy enough on the outside for me, but don't regret ordering it tonight. The table next to us was raving about the garlic bread.

We walked in on a thursday night and got seated immediately. We decided to opt in for the Malnati Chicago Classic deep dish pizza with Lou's lean sausage, olives, and jalapeños.  I thought the pizza was ok. Or maybe I'm just not a big fan of deep dish pizza because it's way too cheesy for me. The sausage is not the usual small pieces you get at your regular pizza places but large, slices of sausage. I'm not usually a fan of sausage, but their blend of sausage and seasoning sure makes this kind pretty tasty. You really do get your bang for your buck here.  I've had deep dish pizza before in California and I feel like they all taste the same to me. The only thing that's different was the sausages and crust wises.

I felt there was barely cheese, didn't fall off the spatular and was actually a little cold.  Lastly the dough was too thick.  I did try my friends pizza, she got the Lou Malnati Classic. More cheese on hers!  What I did like was that you can pre order your food. Because there was an hour wait.

2016-05-21,5.0,"Located near a corner with outdoor seating (too cold and windy for us to eat outside on a Saturday when we visited), my husband and I came here for a late lunch a little before 2:30 pm. There was a wait even this later in the day. We waited 22 minutes for a table, which wasn't too bad. While we waited, an employee told us that we could actually put in an order for our pizza so that it will be ready by the time we are seated (you can only put in your order for pizza only, which is great because it does take some time for it to be made).  So 22 minutes later, we were seated with menus in hand and ended up ordering: Spinach Salad, $9.25 prior to tax- I asked for the dressing (balsamic dressing) to be on the side, which is how it came. This salad was a good size for 2 people to share and came with thinly sliced pears (added a nice sweet taste), some crumbled goat cheese and sliced red onions. I thought this salad was good, but would have preferred grilled onions.  The Malnati Chicago Classic, Small Size, $14.95 prior to tax- If you come to Lou Malnati's, you have to get the Chicago classic. This deep dish masterpiece is topped with sausage, roma tomato marinara and extra cheese. Toppings are simple, but so perfect together(but you can add extra toppings at an additional cost if you want more). The small size gives you 4 large pieces (our server cut and served the pizza for us) and honestly could probably feed 3 people (you only need to eat one slice because it is really filling). The cheese is so oozey and wished I had more it. This is a must order! Chocolate Chip Pizza, Individual Serving, $3.35 prior to tax- Not that I had much room for dessert, but I still wanted something sweet to end this meal. So my husband and I opted to share an individual serving. This serving really is perfect for 1 person (or 2 full people). The cookie and ice cream was a good match and would love to order the larger serving ($6.65 prior to tax, serves 2-3 people). By the way, if you want to order this dessert, let your server know ahead of time because it does take some time to make.  --------------------------- (Total= $29.75 after tax, prior to tip) Wow this meal was delicious! Even though a local Chicagoan (whom I met on the plane on my way back to Southern California) told me that Lou Malnati's is just ""decent"", I still think this place is pretty good. I would definitely come back here again the next time I am in Chicago.

We came in on Wednesday night around 9 pm and we were quoted for a 30 minute wait. Since we were rather tired after a long day of sightseeing plus all the positive reviews on Yelp, we decided we would just wait here than go to a different place.  We put in our order while we were waiting to be seated. It is recommended to do so because it takes a while to bake the deep dish pizzas. We ended up ordering two personal size pizza to share - the Lou and the Malanti. We also got a house salad to share. We actually got seated in about 15 minutes rather than half an hour. Our salad came first. I ordered it with dressing on the side, but when the salad came the dressing was no where to be seen. We were sitting in the corer by the window so it was hard to flag down a waiter to get dressing. However once we got to our waiter, he brought us the dressing soon after. Even though we preordered the pizza, we still waited for a some time for them. It's just the nature of the dish, so I would definitely recommend preordering the pizza. Neither my sister nor I are fan of deep dish pizza after our meal. We definitely prefer thin crust. I never thought I would say no to extra bread. However, the pizza crust isn't very flavorful, so the extra crust makes the pizza rather bland. To me the cheese, sauce, crust ratio is off for deep dish pizza. Too much dough!!

I fell in LOVE with the buttercrust, it was so crispy which is just the way I like it.  David offered awesome recommendations and took excellent care of us too!

For the 4 of us, we ordered a medium Sausage & Mushroom Deep Dish with a butter crust, Lou's Bruschetta, and a family size Malnati salad.  Wait time for the food was a little longer than expected.   When the salad came, it was a lot bigger than what we expected.  I wish our server would have informed us that it would be too much as that was enough for 8-10 people!  We ate as much as we can, but most of it unfortunately, went to waste.  The bruschetta was pretty good.  Nothing fancy, but still tasty.   The pizza was definitely worth the wait.  It was delicious!   I had one slice and it was just right. I wasn't stuffed like the last time I came.  Last time, I had the Malnati Chicago Classic so the pizza was caked in sauce and cheese which was heavy and overwhelming, but this one was just right so I highly recommend ordering the Sausage Deep Dish.

I went to three different deep dish pizza places, including this one, and I must say this one is the best. What's so memorable about this one is their amazing, crunchy crust, and I normally hate eating the crust of a pizza! The crust had a garlic-like seasoning of its own and the pizza sauce was just out of this world--it was definitely an awakening of the ilLOU-MALNATI (did they do that on purpose or it is mere coincidence?). The tomatoes were freshly chopped and oven-baked onto the deep dish pizza while the mozzarella cheese toppled all over this hearty and savory pizza pie.  We were hungry so we also ordered their spinach cheese bread--wow. The cheese oozed out of the bread and the dipping sauce contained freshly pureed tomatoes. I guess the only minor issue is the lack of meat--the sausages specifically, but because I'm more about the sauce-kind of person, I let that slide!

2016-04-20,3.0,"Keep in mind I am not a fan of deep dish pizza. WAIT: I called around 6:30 pm and asked how long the wait was for 7 people and they said 30 minutes.  We come back around 8:00 pm and find that the wait has tripled to being 1 hour and 45 minutes! You give them your phone number and they add you to an app that tells you what your number is in line.  Since the wait was too long we decided to get the pizza to go and eat at our hotel. ORDER AHEAD: Most people tell you that you should order your pizza ahead of time.  What this means is if you are waiting for an hour, you should order your pizza at the kiosk next to the check in area 30 minutes beforehand so when you sit down the pizza will be ready.  The pizza itself takes about 30 minutes to bake so plan ahead! Unfortunately, you cannot call ahead and order but you have to be physically present.   For take out, they tell you to check back in 30 minutes to see if your pizza is ready.  If you're in a rush go earlier to see if it's ready because most likely it is. FOOD: The large has 8 slices while the medium has 6 slices.  Each person ate about 1 1/2 slices so plan accordingly.   Chicago Classic - This has cheese, tomato sauce and sausage.  For being the meat pizza it actually was the one with the least amount of flavor.  The ""buttery"" crust was a little hard on the bottom and not as crispy on the edges.  Definitely need a knife and fork for this one.  They didn't overdo it on the cheese, which was good and it also wasn't overly saucy.  This of course could be because we took it to go and ate it when it was slightly warm but still. The Lou - all vegetarian, but very flavorful! I actually like this one better than the classic.  The crust was a little softer too. Malnati Salad - the dressing was a slightly sweet balsamic with fresh ingredients (the family size fed all 7 of us), mushrooms, peppers etc. I would recommend this to help cut through the grease of the pizza. Overall, probably worth trying once for chicago deep dish style pizza but still didn't blow me away.",0.9889,0.876,0.107,0.017,0.3869274376417234

We shared the Lou's small pizza and oh my gosh was it the best pizza I have ever eaten. It had spinach, onions, garlic, mushrooms, and we added sausage. And Of course we got it with the butter crust, because well, why not? After we ordered the server asked if we wanted an appetizer or salad because the pizza would take 45 minutes. We decided against a starter and I was regretting it about 20 minutes into the wait, but once the food came out I was glad we had decided against it! Deep dish pizza is SO filling!  My only complaint was that the hostess sat our party of three at a two top booth. I asked if we could have a table that properly sat three people and she just moved us down to another two top booth.

2016-03-28,2.0,"This review is strictly on the quality of the food that we had delivered to us (it's about half a mile away). Originally we planned to dine-in but when we got there, the place was crowded and they said the wait time would be nearly an hour (and this was on a Monday night). We opted instead to have the pizza delivered to our hotel and relax with a movie since we weren't up to deal with the noise and figured the pizza would get cold on the walk back if we got it to go. We ordered ""The Lou"" and the combination platter and it took about 45min which was fine. I was excited to try the butter crust that everyone has been raving about but I found the crust plain and doughy rather than flavorful and flaky like people had described. The cheese was not gooey and stretchy; instead it felt like I was gnawing through a block of cheese. I'm not a fan of marina so that's why we got the Lou but were disappointed with the lack of flavor - we might as well have gotten the original just for the flavor aspect.

We didn't have their dessert pizza, which I understand is some sort of chocolate chip cookie and I'm told not to be missed. Oh well, next time! We took a city tour where our guide dissed Lou's and said this other place by the Willis tower was the best in town (don't remember the name now, sorry).  After we visited the tower (tip: go there early to avoid huge lines!), we stopped by for a drink, and the place was not that busy, and the deep dish looked so so.  I suspect that our tour guide was getting a kickback to plug the place to visitors. Lou's is ALWAYS packed!  What does that tell you?  I've also heard locals say that it's the best.

THAT is why this review is 4 stars.   My main issue (and reason for not awarding 5 stars) is that they prefer for you to place your order while your waiting.  In theory, I think this is a great concept.  Where it goes wrong is that you can only order pizza ahead.  A member of my party was planning on ordering pasta, and we had planned on an appetizer of the cheddar cubes (so good, btw) and were assured that this would come out at the same time as the pizza (even though we couldn't place this order til we got to the table).  WELL, not only did we wait 30 minutes for our table we also waited 35 minutes AT our table for the pizza.  When it came out it was DEFINITELY worth the wait but the pasta and appetizer STILL hadn't come out.  We waited an additional 20 minutes for it(while everyone else anxiously/nervously tried to eat as slow as possible so that we would still have food when the pasta came).  (And the pasta was watery and virtually tasteless when it did come. My sister waited forever for something she couldn't even eat.) The waiter did compensate us for this, so the situation was rectified, but this process of advance ordering may need to be thought through a little bit more or done away with altogether.

After reading up on different locations of establishments claiming to have Chicago's Best Deep Dish Pizza I settled on choosing Lou Malnati's and I am so happy I did.  We were greeted by our waitress Laura from the minute we walked in and asked us if we were first timers. I assume being such a popular establishment that is usually the first question to ask. Laura explained the menu to us and even added on an informative tip of it taking 30 minutes for the pizza to be made. With that in mind we started off with ordering the garlic bread for an app. Garlic bread was delicious. It was perfectly drizzled with just the right amount of garlic and olive oil. Good choice.  Now the deep dish pizza. I must say I am bias towards my NY style pizza and still prefer getting a slice versus a personal pie. However this deep dish pizza did not disappoint. The crust was extremely fluffy and soft and included the right amount of sauce and cheese. The pizza came straight out of the oven so it was nice and hot. After the second slice I was completely stuffed and satisfied.  If you're looking to try a Chicago style pizza I would go to Lou Malnati's!,0.987,0.847,0.147,0.006,0.5456959706959708

Not once did he blame it on the workers or question if it was ours. He said ""No one knows how it got there and things happen unfortunately so I apologize for that."" This is the kind of manager we all love working with.  He offered us a thin crust pizza pie to try since we already have the deep dish pizza slices on our plate. We were really full by the time he brought that over. Then he kindly told us that the pizza will be on the house and apologized again. He definitely knows how to make a bad situation better.

I loved every layer of it; sauce, toppings inside the pizza, cheese, and crust blended perfectly together every time I took a bite. I ordered a medium sized pan but was full after eating two slices.  Another dish that people should order are their barbelou wings!!! One of the best wings I've ever had. It was cooked with just the right amount of tenderness, crunchiness, and sauce.  I came here during lunch on a weekday but didn't have an issue getting seated or difficulty with service.

2016-03-09,4.0,"Lost my deep dish - ginity to Lou. Literally. The Lou came LOADED with spinach, mushrooms, sliced roma tomatoes, and three types of cheese. Would I ever do it again? Probably not. But it was a great one time thing.  My friend described this pizza as a casserole. It's extremely thick with too much ""stuffing"", which in my opinion ruins the point of a pizza. It was a heavy dish in every way. The bottom became too soggy and droopy to be eaten without a fork and knife. I'm all for folding my pizza in half and eating it by hand, so this was a no no for me. But again, if it did and had all the things I liked then it wouldn't be a deep dish. For what it is, I think Lou Malnati's did it justice.  Also ordered the same pizza but with a thin crust. Basically, a NYC pie. Crust was thin and crispy. Toppings weren't as overwhelming. It was good, but I wasn't able to take more than two bites because I was already stuffed from a slice of deep dish.  For appetizers, I had the calamari and spinach stuffed bread. Calamari was soggy and the breading was coming off. The bread was delicious and you should definitely order it!  Apart from the food, the service was stellar. One of the nicest bunch of staff I've ever come across. Had an incident with the food but the waitress and manager were so cooperative about it. Ended up covering the pizza bill. That itself deserved the 4 star!  Great experience overall.

I'm not a crust person and I didn't eat the crust on Giordano's pizza, but you best believe I ate the crust here. I love this crust. The things lacking in comparison to Giordano's: 1. The cheese. There's simply not enough cheese on the pizza to make for that stringy, I'm-going-to-drown-in-cheese experience. 2. Giordano's flavor combinations blend together in an irresistible way. You taste individual components on the Malnati's pizza, but they don't come together. If only someone could combine the two, you'd probably have the most amazing pizza ever...

Drinks were fast enough and then we entered the order for an appetizer (buffalo wings). We had the appetizer in about 15 minutes and just as we finished the pizza was coming out.  The small was perfect for two people, with two decent sized slices per person. That with wings and the cookie pie for dessert was enough to fill up up but not leave us overly stuffed.

It is everything you want in a bruschetta: perfectly crunchy garlic bread and fresh flavorful tomatoes topped with delicious parmesan cheese and herbs. Just perfection.

To me deep dish is Sicilian or pizza hut. Now this is much better than pizza hut im sure even though I was probably 10 the last time I ate pizza hut. The beef I have with this style pizza is 1. it just seems super rich an unhealthy and 2. you cant just get a slice. In NY when your running low on time, rushing to catch a train or what have you, being able to just grab that slice and go is key. Also a classic NY slice will run 300-350 calories. One of these baby pizzas will cost you over 800.  Still giving four stars here though. It was delish and service was friendly.

I preferred the classic over Lou's. I liked how it wasn't too salty.  The Lou's had too much veggies which made the crust more doughy and killed some of the crunch.  One reason I usually opt for thin crust over deep dish is because the cheese and toppings usually make it too salty on deep dish and also the crust comes out too doughy. I usually also go for pepperoni over sausage, but in this case I had to try it the way it was to see what it was all about. I wasn't disappointed. Very good crust.  Haven't tried the other joints yet, but I will on return visits to the Windy City.",0.924,0.821,0.13,0.049,0.4498717948717949

On the way there, this old uber driver dude that can bare drive drops me off at ""Due's"" pizza place.  I'm thinking, ""man...this ain't the place"".  After he left, Ask me why I caught another uber again and ended up at this Lou Malnati.  Walked in. Hostess were friendly. Sat at the bar and I ordered my pizza.  David G the bartender, who was fast and friendly btw, took my order but told me it would take 30-45 minutes as the kitchen whips it up from scratch with tender loving care.  I'm thinking, ""that's a long time, but fine.""  The game is on at the bar. They playin Michael Jackson in the background, and the patrons were friendly and conversational.  After chatting it up and watching the game, my son face timed me from DC. Went outside to take the call, and after about 10 minutes, David G the bartender came out in the freezing cold and said ""yo! Your pizza is hot ready. Take your time but I got you"".

I'm thinking to myself ""how the heck can this pizza get any better. I have never had anything like this in my entire life"". So David G proceeds to bring out the peppers.

One of the best attributes to a deep dish pizza from Lou's is its butter crust.  This is definitely what separates Lou's from the rest.  The beer sausage on the sausage pizza only enhances the experience as well as the cheese that covers your favorite pie. The other night, I was feeling like pizza but not feeling deep dish.  Decided to try their thin crust sausage pizza.  To my amazement, the crust was the same used on their deep dish but just thinner and less cheese.  So if you're thinking about thin crust at Lou's, I would definitely vouch for it.

This crust is amazingly crisp and tasty. After the crust it is a thicker layer of very fresh clean tasting mozzarella cheese, not really greasy at all. Then it is a loaded layer of house made sausage very flavorful and loaded across the whole pie. Finally, there is a very hearty fresh tasting layer of sauce to cap off the entire pizza. It was very tasty and much fresher not greasy pizza.  On the personal opinion side, I thought it was very good but not what I was expecting with a deep dish which I thought was going to be more of a thicker crust but it was still very good.",0.9647,0.869,0.118,0.013,0.5195138888888889

(maybe lunch rush was crazy right before) I waited at the cash register about 10 minutes with only 2 other people waiting and 3 staff standing by the register talking. 2 or 3 more people come in and were a bit more pushy and the hostesses helped them over the couple of us already waiting, which wasn't super fair.  I ordered The Lou - since vegetarian. Based on the description of spinach, mushroom and mozzarella, I expected this to be more like a creamy alfredo or blanca pizza. It wasn't at all what I expected. The buttercrust I thought would be airy and light.. it was crisp and crunchy. There wasn't very much sauce on the pizza (good because it wasn't soggy by the time I got back to the office, bad because I didn't taste too much pizza sauce). The cheese was mostly cheddar. I didn't taste any garlic.. Honestly this pizza reminded me of when I was in grade school and use to take english muffins with canned tomato sauce and cheddar cheese and pop them in the toaster oven for a bit... tasted about like that... It was okay.. but I definitely don't think it is 5 star pizza. And I really don't think my personalized size pizza was justified for the $10 price tag on it.

But there was a group of ladies standing behind us who would not stop complaining. They were saying the bartender was ignoring them but they only been standing there for like 5 mins...In a fully packed restaurant... Really?!? They ended up tipping him like a dollar so we gave him extra tip.. When we sat down we got calamari for an appetizer and demolished it within 5 mins then came the pizza. The crust cheese and sauce taste like a buttery heaven. I was so happy. I ate two slices of a medium and was more than satisfied.  As a bonus we saw a couple of players for the 49ers since the Bears were playing them that weekend. They were huge and ate a ton.,0.9905,0.746,0.243,0.011,0.6568376068376067

We arrived on a Sunday around 1pm and were sat by the nice hostess immediately. It took awhile for the waiter to acknowledge us and then take our orders. He seemed a bit discombobulated, perhaps high on pizza or in a food coma. Either way, he sucked... it was a good thing that I was wow'd by the cheese. I'm not a huge pizza fan, and I'll disclose and consider that. I chose the personal deep dish lunch special which was $8.95 and included side salad and a soda or unsweetened tea. Since unsweetened is my tea us preference, I was in luck. But if you prefer sweet tea, you'll have to add your own sugar. The side salad came on a tiny plate, piled high of greens, tomatoes, etc. They really should considered a bigger plate. I was a fan of it, but made a mess as I tried to keep it between my mouth and the plate. The pizza, oh the pizza! The sauce was chunky and topped the pizza. The depth of the pizza was mostly cheese. The cheese was the best part... stringy, gooey, excellent cheese. The crust wasn't as thick as you would think, nor was it at all doughy, as some deep dish pizzas are. My husband and daughter split the specialty Malnati Chicago Classic, made with Lou's lean sausage, some extra cheese and vine-ripened tomato sauce on Buttercrust. I tried their pizza, which came with sausage slices. I actually liked their sausage pizza more than my pepperoni pizza, but I didn't taste the butter on the crust. The crust was my least favorite part. We all sort of picked around the crust. My second least favorite part, was the sauce. I wasn't a fan of the chunky sauce, but my daughter fell in love. I scooped the sauce off and she scooped it off of my plate and on to hers. Yeah, love will make you do strange things.",0.9834,0.825,0.125,0.05,0.5130026455026456

What's even less reasonable is the fact that I believe it was worth the 2 hour plane ride from New York. This pizza was unlike the traditional New York pizza I'm used to. The biggest contrast is obviously the thickness of the pie, but what else is interesting is that it is constructed with the cheese on the bottom and the sauce is on top. The sauce was absolutely packed with flavor and chunks of tomato offering the bite needed to compete with the various textures present. The crust was buttery, flakey and delicious. What was truly impressive however, was how it remained crispy under the substantial weight of pizza filling. For me the real seller was the significant presence of mozzarella cheese oozing out of every bite. Finally, there was a pleasant surprise, a layer of sausage underneath the sauce. I didn't even realize what was happening until the second bite. All in all I must tip my hat to this mid west treasure.

The toppings were arranged well: the sausage was laid out in strips, and every bite was packed with flavor. Mushrooms. Garlic. Sausage. Spinach. Cheeeeeese. Mmmm!  We ordered a calamari appetizer which was slightly above average -- the chunks of squid were large, but each bite seemed slightly soggy. While we were intimidated by the large crowd assembled at the entrance when we arrived on a Fri night, we were pleasantly surprised by the ease of being seated. The waitress took our pizza order in advance, as the pizza takes 45 minutes to cook, so by the time we were seated 25 minutes later, we only had a small wait for our food. Additionally, we devoured the free pizza samples while we waited. Lou's is MUCH better than Giordano's in my opinion, mostly because I've been underwhelmed by Giordano's soggy crust.

I look forward to trying you out again. I was determined to eat some Chicago deep dish on my most recent trip. Our shuttle driver said that Lou Malnati's was the place to go. I also overheard a fellow conference goer talking about his experience and he recommended to go here. I was originally planning on a different pizza shop, but changed my mind after hearing this place recommended twice. My mom and I walked over from our hotel and it was quite a nice walk. It was not busy when we arrived, but quickly picked up by the time we were being seated. They gave us the option of ordering our pizza in advance so we would have less time to wait at our table. Note: you only order the pizza, not additional items such as salads.  We were seated upstairs after about 15 minutes. Not bad. Our food came out very quickly. I find it odd that the employees need to cut up and serve the pizza. We could have really done it ourselves. I think this slows down service quite a bit. More on that later. The salad was fine. The pizza was pretty good. It wasn't as deep as I expected. Also, it didn't seem to have as much cheese as I am used to with deep dish. We thought it was good, but not spectacular.

At the time I call the woman I spoke with told me they were so sorry and would credit my account. In fact that is not what happened at all. Instead of crediting me they charged me twice. I have spoken with several different managers at the restaurant . They have told me that they can't access that one single day on there company records. They can see every day of the year just not October 7th. With that being said I have tried to be understanding. One of the managers was very nice  and for all the inconvenience offered me a free meal this past weekend. We were having people over and I took him up on the offer. Unfortunately when the order arrived It was not hot and incorrect. Fast forward 3 days and I called to see if we had found any resolution to the overcharging issue I also wanted them to know the the order they had sent me was less then satisfactory.

The service. They had SOOOOO many staff members and they all seemed unorganized. We had a party of 5 and for whatever reason the party of 4 for seated before us with no wait but we had to wait about 10 mins to get seated. We were all hangry (hungry and angry) so we ordered ahead of time in hope of having the pizza semi ready by the time we got seated. We sat down and our waitress was pretty inattentive. Our drinks went empty quite often and the table of 5 females that sat down after us had their pizzas before us. We waited about 50 mins from the time we ordered until we got our food. I would suggest coming here when you aren't super hungry because you'll be waiting a while! Too many staff members with too much confusion amongst them! There's no reason to have 3 bus boys cleaning one table or 5 hostess at the hostess stand.,0.7936,0.836,0.099,0.065,0.5469135802469136

I've had deep dish from Zachary's in California (which I've heard is pretty authentic) and I've always just thought it was ok.  We looked up a couple spots, but this standard and in a central location. There was a wait, but you can order your pizza ahead of time, which is awesome! They got it down to science. A bunch of the pizzas looked pretty good but we stuck with their special--gotta go with the classic to set expectations. So I ordered ahead of time, and they said they'd get a head start but it'd still be 10-15 after we're seated for the pizza to be ready. I thought that was reasonable and great that they did that.  The deep dish pizza itself. OMG so good! The crust was really good and buttery, it was not overly saucy. Good flavor, everything worked together really well. It's different than your traditional pizza, but I really liked it! Definitely hefty, there's a lot of cheese, all of it was yummy. Loved the crust.  Also, I thought the prices were really affordable.

I was here for a short three day weekend and came here on two of the days because it was that good! My sister has been to Chicago a few times and has tried other places and didn't like deep dish at all, after trying this spot she likes deep dish again! Their ingredients are fresh, the crust is buttery and my personal favorite pie is the ""Lou"" which is pretty much a veggie pie that comes loaded with fresh tomatoes and etc, I have tried the minatti Chicago classic on the second day after reading reviews on Yelp and I thought it wasn't bad, the sausage was yummy and it's slightly more salty compared to the Lou but still a delicious pie itself for those who love sausages. The only downside is the wait for the pizza is 30-45 minutes but I would still recommend everyone to come try this. I considered going to Gino's on the second day but the prices for their pie was ridiculous and I would rather get two pies from Lou's with toppings compared to one pie from Gino's that is just a plain cheese pie.

Hands down, The Thin Crust Sausage Pizza was the top favorite for our table of 5 people. The 2nd choice was The Malnati Chicago Classic. The Lou, we could have done without.

2015-10-22,2.0,"After some careful consideration, I have dropped down the number of stars this place deserves from four to two.  There are many reasons for this, and I will elaborate.   The GF and I came here at a not so busy time; after lunch, but no quite time for dinner.  We were seated in the back room with two other parties, despite plenty of room in the front.  Our server greeted us and took our drink orders.  We looked at the menu and decided on the spinach stuffed bread and the small pepperoni and mushroom deep dish pizza.  Our server told us the pizza would take 45 minutes to bake.  At first, I thought he was joking, but soon realized he was serious.  45 minutes for a pizza to cook is a bit excessive.  It is a really good way to get customers to order more food though.  By the time they finish eating all the appetizers and salads, they will be too full for the pizza.   The stuffed spinach bread came out in less than ten minutes.  It tasted great, maybe because we were so hungry.  The bread was soft, and as you ripped a piece off, cheese oozed out.  It was seasoned perfectly, and was devoured in a quicker time than it did to bake the thing.   The pizza did in fact take nearly 45 minutes to make its way to our table.  By now, the dining room had filled up quite a bit.  The pizza tasted good, but the amount of time waiting, really hyped up my expectations.  The expectations fell short once reality hit.  It was just an average tasting pizza once the high wore down.  For dessert, we shared the chocolate chip pizza.  We decided to tell our server to put the order in while we were still eating the pizza for fear that it would take forever to come out.  Good thing we did though, because it did take quite a bit of time.  The heat from the cookie paired perfectly with the cold ice cream.   In conclusion, I clearly did not enjoy waiting 45 minutes for my pizza even when there were hardly any other patrons dining.  I just can't seem to fathom that it actually takes that long for the pizza to cook.  It is absolutely mind boggling.  They were pretty stingy on the toppings too.    As my first deep dish experience in Chicago, this place was a let down.  One up side of our experience was that the service was great, and our guy was super friendly and helpful.   I would recommend going to Pequod's Pizzeria instead, which we tried the next day.  Their pizza was hands down the best pizza I have ever had.  It took less than half the time for their pizza to make its way to our table.",0.9969,0.818,0.152,0.029,0.4807952069716775

Lucked into it on a short trip with the family to see the sights around the Chicago Loop. We knew we wanted to eat the local version of pizza and were staying close to several spots that make the lists for being ""the best"". I thought our decision was down to choosing between Pizzeria Uno or Due but the hotel front door guy told me to go to Lou's. At first I thought he was kidding because I couldn't find a place for pizza named ""Lou's"". He took pity on me when he realized I had no idea what he was talking about and told me it was short for Lou Malnati's. He told me that it was further away but the walk and wait in line would be worth it. His endorsement sold me when he said, ""I think it's da best and I'm from Chicago."" Found it without too much trouble and it had a 45 min wait for a table. Thought I was going to die from hunger while waiting since it smelled so good when we checked in. The wait was worth it. Got a great Malnati Salad to share and the Malnati Chicago Classic pizza which is described as extra sausage and tomato on a deep dish butter crust. The description does not do it justice because extra sausage in this case came out looking like a deep dish pain with a sausage manhole cover over it hidden by cheese.

2015-10-12,4.0,"Warning: I'm an outsider. This was my first time visiting Chicago. Obviously, I had to try one of the famous, highly rated, traditional Chicago deep dish from Lou's.  My understanding of Chicago pizza is that there are three main types: deep dish, pan pizza, and stuffed pizza. Lou's is dd. I thought the Malnati Chicago Classic (sausage, cheese, crushed tomato, butter crust) was very good. It had a natural tomato flavor, with a nice helping of cheese along an interesting ""butter crust"". The sausage brought very little to the equation, lacking flavor but adding texture. The crust is much different (and not comparable to other types of pizza). This type of crust has a crumbly effect it, almost cornmealy, which holds everything together well. I would not say its my favorite type of pizza, and it certainly is not the best I have ever had; but it is a different spin on pizza, and it is good if you can accept it for its differences.",0.9476,0.805,0.149,0.046,0.5408982683982685

I came here with a fairly large group so we ordered 2 medium sized deep dish pizzas and it really hit the spot! Flavors were definitely on point and serving sizes were perfect as well. The Malnati Chicago Classic is made with their Lou's lean sausage, some extra cheese and vine-ripened tomato sauce on a butter crust. This was probably my favorite of the two. Can never go wrong with a classic meat pizza.  The Lou's is more of a veggie style. I believe it had cheese, spinach, and mushrooms? Not bad either, but I'm a meat on pizza kind of guy so it wasn't my favorite.  All the toppings tasted fresh and the crust was crisp as can be. One thing about Malnati's is that even though it is a deep dish pizza, it holds together very well. I've been to several other deep dish pizza places where the entire pizza just falls apart when you eat it, but at Lou Malnati's the pizza is well composed. At other places, don't even think about picking it up and eating it with your hands, you need a knife and fork, but at Malnati's you can pick it up perfectly find and the crispy delicious buttery crust holds everything together like a champ!

2015-09-26,3.0,"After tasting Gino's East and Giordano's, I knew the best big thing to round out the trio was a pie at Lou Malnati's. And man I do have some mixed opinions on this. Again, in accordance with my deep dish factorial analysis, I gotta judge it based on the crust, sauce, cheese + toppings, and ratios. How do we break this down? Crust: Lou Malnati's takes on a close second to Giordano's for sure, but barring anything else they are both essentially equal. Flaky and crispy butter crust, never burnt. I will knock on the fact that typically because Lou's and Gino's has smaller pizzas than Giordano's, the ratio of dough to ingredients seems to be greater. Still crispy and delicious though. Sauce: I actually prefer the flavor of the sauce at Lou's compared to Giordano's, but much prefer the consistency of Giordano's(which just seems fresher with larger chunks of tomato). The sauce at Lou's is a bit sweeter while still being spiced similarly(I'm a fan), but for the most part seemed like a paste rather than a more natural and made-to-order tomato sauce. We ordered two large pizzas, the Lou(Spinach mix, fresh tomatoes, 3 cheeses), and the Chicago classic(Sausage, extra cheese). Here is where I have mixed opinions. Despite the lack of meat, the Lou is probably one of my favorite deep dish pizzas in Chicago. The extra tomatoes and the fresh spinach mix really just makes it all taste vibrant, and the cheese with the sauce really just brings it all together in an oozing fatty mess of deliciousness. The Chicago Classic on the other hand....the plate of sausage was nice but I think I prefer the sausage at Giordano's(Lou's was about equal to Gino's in that respect). However the ratios of the Chicago classic were a bit off for my tastes: far too much cheese and crust and not enough sauce. In the end I sort of just wanted an extra side of sauce just so I could dip the extra cheesy bread. Overall verdict: Lou's can make some good pizza, and the namesake is there for a reason. As for the Chicago classic, if you want a meat based pizza I'd stick with just a regular pepperoni or sausage deep dish because the ratios will be a bit more favorable. Unless you're willing to say cheese.",0.9933,0.854,0.131,0.015,0.39033211233211235

This was my first time in Chicago, and damnit, I just felt like being a tourist for a little minute, so I ordered the famous pie. Ive had the contender too many times to count, but your not going to find Chicago style pizza in Charleston, so I took advantage of it while here for work.  I ordered delivery with no time to venture out and find it, and thankfully, there website is clean and efficient. Ordering a pie was super easy. No registration or signing up needed, which is smart because I would have skipped ordering from them.  They also provide a time that the pie will get to you which was very helpful because then I could plan accordingly to be upstairs when it arrived. Remarkably, it actually arrived within the time frame that was listed when I purchased it. Check check.  Take the handoff, and was not prepared for how heavy the thing was. This medium pie weighed some pounds..I couldnt help but laugh that I felt I was about to eat pounds of pizza. Open it up, its bulky, thick, heavy...its a lot. I ate a sliver of it, but honestly it didnt wow me. I really dont know what else to say about it. It was good, but not remarkable. I will say I am thankful they used real mushrooms and not canned--that is always worth noting. Im just going to chalk this up as the beginning and end to my Chicago pizza experience. It was also $30, so it is was coming back to South Carolina with me. For $30, I dont care how eh' it was, it was getting finished!",0.9779,0.757,0.159,0.084,0.5000541125541125

And thus I find Lou Malnati's, on whose shoulders I must place my entire opinion of Chicago-style pizza.  But I was not alone.

""The sauce is on top."" ""But why?"" ""Who can explain the mysteries of this earth?"" Fortunately, Malnati's provided an excellent example of the red-topped step-child of the pizza family, as our ""Chicago Classic,"" topped with sausage, tasted fantastic and certainly stands as one of the best Chicago-styles I've had.

Anyone that doesnt understand what I mean by 'tourist row', this should help explain. It was the day of the Bears vs. Packers and 90% of people had Packers jerseys on... because no self respecting Chicagoan would be donning green and yellow in 'real' neighborhoods. Anyway, my rating has nothing to do with that... So, we entered the joint and asked to sit outside because it was beautiful out. The tables were set and no one was out there. They said we couldnt because it was closed. I said, it doesnt looked closed.. they said nothing and asked if we still wanted a table. I'm not a dick but seriously? No place in 'real' Chicago would have treated me like a tourist.. but alas, I was in 'tourist row'.. So, we sat in the stuffy crowded and loud back room.. ok, no worries - lets just get our pizza on and move forward. Server was not friendly but I can handle that... I asked for my Italian Beef to be made dry and she asked me what does that meant? I asked if this was her first day and she scowled at me... again, 'tourist row'. For those of you that dont understand - Italian Beefs are severed dipped or dry in Chicago. She then explained mid scowl that the au jus comes on the side - which is great but rare when ordering a Beef. I then asked for chopped onions to be put on the Beef.. She said, 'WE DONT DO THAT HERE' - I put this last part in caps because really.. like really? Its a pizza joint.. you have chopped onions. I have worked at like 5 pizza joints that severed Beefs as well.. YES, you can have f'ing onions on your Beef if you want. I had to explain to her that since they also serve pizza then I bet that they have onions in back that they can put on the Beef... She had the nerve to say, NO - but we can put them on the side... like really? Come on, was that really necessary? Sure, put them on the side, I dont care.. just give me some onions for Christ sake. Needless to say, Beef came out without an onion in sight... weak.  Now, I know that this might seem like nit-picking to some people but having shown my relatives some serious awesome neighborhood love for a few days, this experience was really getting my goat. Pizza came out and was great as usual... as was the wings and Beef overall. So there you go, solid food from the Lou's I have grown to know and love for 35 years.. wack service.

We were glancing over the menu, taking our time...waiting...waiting...about 15 minutes went by without anyone coming to our table. Major bummer, cause I was really hungry and I thought they were better than this. Eventually after making an obvious glance at one of the waitresses, she helped us with our drink order and we eventually got our pizza order in as well. Now for the good part! We got The Malnati Chicago Classic and it was pizza heaven. Tons of delicious gooey cheese and the crust isn't too hard and full of flavor as well. As an appetizer we got the Malnati Salad to share and it's pretty big! That might have been one of the best salads of my life though. Couple that with a local Chicago IPA and this meal turned out really good. Don't miss out on this authentic Chicago pizza!",0.9908,0.782,0.206,0.012,0.5030701754385966

We sat outside, our waiter had 3 tables, and couldn't seem to handle basic server responsibilities like checking to see how our food was, do we need a box for our leftovers, would we like dessert or how about our check? I might mention that it was 8:00 on Labor Day Monday, it was muggy with humidity so I am assuming he wanted to hang out more in the air conditioning, then service the diners outside. I couldn't help but wonder how many people leave without paying for their meal  We asked the three employees standing around the hostess stand for a box, and they said they would let our server know, obviously they never did because he didn't come back with a box. We laid our credit card on the table to let him know we were ready to pay, too bad the attentiveness to customer's is so lacking at such a well known pizza resteraunt.",0.8699,0.843,0.102,0.055,0.455

The spinach bread is a smaller sized loaf of bread filled with cheesy goodness and a little bit of spinach as well. The pizza with the butter crust is amazing as well! Took about 30 min for them to make the pizza but it was definitely worth the wait. The crust has a really nice crunch to it all around and every bite was filled with ooey gooey mozzarella goodness and Oh my, they definitely do not skimp on the sausage! Instead of bits of sausage, it seemed like they had sausage on every inch of the pie!

We ordered two small pizzas for three people (and trust me it is enough bc my boyfriend is an eater and I can definitely scarf down a few slices normally without budging). We got the Malnati and the Lou pizzas. I think maybe because I ate the Malnati's first, I think it tastes better since it was served piping hot. The crust was perfect and so was the layering of hot melted stringy cheese and the sweet, tangy tomato sauce.

Just know you'll feel comfortable when you first walk in. I actually ended up sitting outside to enjoy the beautiful anyway nahmsayin? To the point tho. I came to the Chi for the sole purpose of eatin some authentic Chicago Deep dish pizza and that's what the gawd did. I'm not one of these cats that try and break down the texture of crust n pepperoni n ish; or the robustness of the tomatoes. If the food is good then no need to put it to a science yo. With that said your boy opted for the deep dish pepperoni and I'll say this, I approve. I got the 9"" because I got the build of a king so a king size portion is what I'll take. I've had deep dish from other places outside Chicago and I must say I'm happy I took the trip. The pepperoni spicy, the tomato sauce choonkie, the cheese mad cheesy, and my favorite part the crust perfectly crisp on the edges and chewy on the inside. On some real ish tho your boy was reconsidering getting a 9"" (wild pause) because I was ready to tap by the 3rd slice. I came on and empty stomach and still almost had trouble finishing. Needles to say I'm no quitter and handled my thug thizzle like a true g. If you like white iPhones n ish or enjoy ballads by Drake then they got a 6"" that might satisfy your personal needs too. Overall this place is great; it could get a five star review, but; my experience with deep dish is kinda limited ya know? They also have a full menu with all types of Italian dishes that looked appetizing but I ain't go there for that.

Good for tourists and for being unhealthy Food: for tourists reading this review, Chicago deep dish is basically in a deep pan with dough lining it. The inside is filled with sauce, cheese, and other toppings. It is just as unhealthy and delicious as it sounds. Bring friends. Lou Malnatis was my first exposure to deep dish and boy did I take a... Deep dive. The menu is pretty simple, with salads, apps, and of course, deep dish. Each pie takes about 30 minutes to bake, and seem to go longer on busy days. And it was busy the entire time we were there. I got the vibe that the waitress wanted us in and out when she constantly offered to take our plates. Oh well, I guess Chicago just moves faster.

I'm also a big fan of sausage and glad that Lou Malnati's was very generous with the amount of sausage that was on the deep dish. It's been a few years since I've been to Gino's and Giordano's but I appreciated that Lou Malnati allows you to put an order in while you wait to be seated.

You can pre-order your pizzas while waiting but since this only saves a few minutes I'm not sure what the point is. Service was a bit slow once we were seated as we didn't see a waitress for almost 10 minutes and from that point every time we needed something we had to flag her down. We tried two pizzas - the Malnati Chicago Classic and the Lou. Both were pretty good, we debated at the table which was better and I think we were split 2-2. The serving estimates in the menu were very accurate for us as we ordered two smalls and it was perfect for the four of us but we had also ordered the Spinach salad which was also pretty good.

My family and I came here on a Monday night and this place had a line surrounding the door.  It's a bit different than what I'm used to. Here you order before you're actually at your table. Order while you wait and then once you get seated your food will be ready. Well, at least this is the idea. The inside of this place is really crammed. Everyone is really close together and there's constantly someone trying to get by. The walls are covered in sports memorabilia which really gave a really nice feel and warming atmosphere.  We ordered a few pizzas to share amongst the five of us. Two deep dish and one thin crust. The server will cut the pizza and serve everyone at your table which I thought was really convenient since it's a bit crammed inside. I was so excited for the deep dish but I really think the thin crust stole the show. It was delicious and addicting. However, the deep dish was also rich and fluffy. I loved the fact that it wasn't dense to where you couldn't enjoy it. The toppings are piled on so make sure you love what you order!

We also had the calamari which was battered perfectly and was still moist and juicy unlike most places where the calamari is dry and stringy.  Oh the pizza!!!! We had the sausage pizza and lemme tell you... I can usually do damage on pizza, averaging 4-5 slices. However, this pizza... after two slices I was stuffed and couldn't move. It felt like each pizza slice weighed about a pound of yumminess. They certainly aren't stingy with the sausage. Instead of sprinkling morsels of sausage, it's like a a blanket of meaty goodness cooked to perfection. Also, as most people commented, the butter crust... Ridiculously good.

2015-08-04,2.0,"This review is to comment on the service my husband and I received last night. Several minutes after we sat down, our waitress came over to take our order. We ordered a small pizza and a personal slice. She asked if we wanted an appetizer because the pizza would take 45 minutes to come out. We didn't really want one because we we didn't want to ruin our appetites for the pizza, but we were so hungry we decided to order an appetizer too. We ordered the 3 cheese bread appetizer and were told the appetizer would take 10 to 15 minutes to come out. 3 other groups of people came and ordered after us. 30 minutes passed and we still didn't have our appetizer, but two of the other tables had already received their appetizers and one had received their entree. We decided to ask our waitress when our appetizer would come out since it had been so long and all we ordered was cheese bread. She told us it would be out in a few minutes. My husband jokingly said, ""Sorry, we're just starving."" To which the waitress rudely replied, ""So is everyone else."" About 5 more minutes passed and she came by apologizing for the wait and told us that the appetizer would be free. Several minutes later we got the appetizer which was literally just garlic bread with cheese on it and marinara sauce for dipping. I'm not sure why that would take about 40 minutes to make. Between finishing our appetizer and receiving our entrees, it took another 20 minutes. During those 20 minutes, the 2 of the other groups of people received their entrees and one of them had completely finished their food, paid for it, and left. When we received our food, the personal pizza seemed like it had been sitting out for a while because it was not hot at all compared to the small pizza that was still steaming. Despite the bad service we received regarding the time, there were a few good things about the service since the waitress did apologize for the wait and she was pretty friendly except for that one rude comment.

We arrive and are immediately seated, the restaurant was pretty empty at the time.

We barely had a chance to look at the menu and haven't even had a chance to glance at the drink menu. We order our pizza anyways, we split a sausage deep dish for two. She tells us it will take about 30 minutes, which is fine, we try and tell her we want to order drinks too, but she rushes away before we can say anything else.... so she doesn't come back at all... and then our pizza arrives. I asked the poor guy that brought us our pizza if he could get our waitress for us. In retrospect I feel kind of bad for that because I was kind of rude to him, but I was very annoyed we didn't have drinks or silverware so we couldn't eat our food and it could get cold. She then comes over apologizes and gives us silverware and we order our drinks, which we then get quickly.

When we got there the wait was over 2 hours so we went to Giordano's instead. No confirmation of Jay Z or triangle pizzas.  Fast forward to 2015, we planned to visit Chicago again, thus made it my life mission to try their pizza. Unfortunately there's no Jay Z posters in sight but the pizza was so damn good. It was worth the pizza blue balls for 5 years. We had the Chicago classic with pepperoni as a deep dish and the thin crust with pepperoni and giardinera. (Omg totally in love with giardinera but that's another story) wow, both pizzas deep and thin were the best pizzas I've ever had.

As expected, the place was super crowded. We were seated after 40 minutes of waiting. It was weekdays, so I guess if you visit on weekends, waiting time would be longer. But it was worth waiting! I visited Chicago 7 years ago and the pizza I had at that time was thick but dry. I didn't have good memories on that. Also, some friends living in Chicago didn't recommend deep dish pizza. They said it's just a one time thing. But this one was thick but still juicy and cheese and tomato sauce mixed really well. Four of us all really enjoyed the dining here. Prices are reasonable too. I paid only like 10 dollars and felt very full afterwards. I took out a star just because you need to wait quite a long time and the servers were pretty busy.

We tried the Chicago classic Medium size ($20) and a penne pasta lunch special. I would skip pasta and just do pizza.  The pasta didn't have much flavour to it, just felt like I was eating pasta and cheese. For pizza, I would suggest their Classic or Sausage version (we tried sausage a few days before at a food event where Lou's was at too). Both are good!  Service was okay, decor was interesting.

2015-07-22,3.0,"So we were in Chicago for five or six days and I haven't been in years. I love pizza. And I mean, I LOVE pizza. All kinds of pizza. Thin crust, deep dish, New York, Chicago, Neapolitan, whatever. I'll eat frozen pizza, leftover pizza, pizza that may or may not have fallen on the ground. In my books, even bad pizza is pretty good. And while Lou's was FAR from being bad pizza,I was just a tad disappointed, just a little let down  and perhaps a victim of my own sky-high expectations. Oh well, it was still pizza and it was still pretty good.  So starting at the beginning (finally) we had limited time and settled on going to the two biggest players in town (so far as I could ascertain), Lou Malnati's and Giordano's. Now I know that there are a LOT of other options but again, limited time and a long absence made me want to keep things as simple as I could.  So although I did cheat and have a thin-crust at the place next to our hotel, we stuck with the plan when it came to deep dish.  First off, the place is huge and even though we were relegated to the dreaded upper level, service was still good and they were more than accommodating with our many questions and various restrictions. Honey had the gluten free and I dropped the mushrooms from ""The Lou"" (despite the 'no substitutions' request) and all was good. We each ordered salads and I'm glad we did, seeing as they were both quite tasty (she had the Spinach, I had the House) and that the pizza took quite a while to get to us...but that's deep dish for you. But after all of that it was just okay. She's had better gluten free and I've had better deep dish even in Toronto. Mine looked great and was more than acceptable but just wasn't as doughy, as savory, as buttery and as cheesy awesome as I was expecting. I don't know why, I really don't. It was fine and it was pizza and I still liked it but I felt a bit let down. When the salad is the best part of the meal, there's something not quite right. So on our next trip we probably won't be back to Lou's, given the vast array of other choices.

We were supposed to have a twenty five minute wait, but we ended up waiting only five minutes! YAY! Also, if you had to wait more than I did, there's the option to order the pizza before you are seated, just because it takes so long to cook. Plus there's a really nice diagram in the front register area to see what the sizes of the pizza look like.  My mom and I ordered the Spinach Salad, the Stuffed Spinach Bread, and a small Malnati Chicago classic pizza. The spinach salad was pretty average, but I was still happy that we got a salad because the rest of our meal was so carby. It was nice to be able to eat something while waiting for the ~grand finale~. Nevertheless, our appetizer, the stuffed spinach bread, was delicious. It was kind of like it's own extra mini deep dish pizza with marinara sauce on the size, and I definitely recommend it if you aren't planning to eat an entire pizza!  The pizza was really good - the crust was crunchy, the tomato sauce was good, cheese was melted, the usual. Everything you want in a pizza! The only qualm I had was I wish it was a little more hot when it arrived to our table. Maybe it was just our pizza, but the cheese was pretty solidified after like five minutes which was kind of annoying.  Just to give you an idea of how much we ate - my mom and I ate all of the salad and spinach bread but only ate half of the small pizza and took the rest to-go to eat later.

The wait went on forever...first to get a table - 15 minutes longer than quoted - then to get the pizza that was preordered - 40 minutes after being seated - and lastly to get the check. Apparently the restaurant was having issues with the credit card machine and the waiter kept stopping by to say, ""still working on it"". Finally I asked to speak to the manager, but I was told he's busy. Eventually we said we are leaving (we arrived around 7pm and it was 10:30 at this point) and he asked if he could write down my credit card to run it later. I agreed and headed out frustrated that I had to give my personal information (on a napkin) to someone I didn't know. This morning I woke up to see that the charge to my card included a 20% tip...hummmm...apparently they just tip themselves for the inconvenience they caused. I expected the manager to comp the entire meal initially, but agreed to pay when I left. I did NOT, however agree to tip the waiter for what I felt was a poor dining experience (whether it was his fault or not).  Going forward I think I'll stick to Pequods or one of the other 5 deep dish restaurants that treat their customers better. UPDATE - Bernie, the Manager at the location just called to apologize and get more information about the experience - she is looking into the tip issue to understand the issue we had that night, but perhaps more noteworthy, she is going to send a gift certificate to ensure we give them another chance.

2015-06-19,4.0,"One of my friends came into town and she's never been to Chicago/had deep dish pizza. I had the daunting task of deciding which legendary Chicago deep dish pizza to show her. I chose Lou's, because I grew up eating Lou's, and figured it's the most well known.  We chose this location purely because of where we had finished our little walking tour of the Loop/central downtown. For 6:00 on a Friday, I was SHOCKED that our wait was only about 20 minutes. This location is a bit smaller than what I'm used to, but they use their space well and have a really efficient wait system. It uses modern technology (an iPad and texting) and they encourage you to order your pizza(s) while you wait so it cuts your wait time in half once you get to the table. Very efficient. Loved it.  They also make the waiting atmosphere thiiiiis much better because they have complimentary thin crust pizza while you're waiting! Score! We ordered a small pep and a small Lou's, perfect for 3 people, and we even took a couple ""slices"" home. Pizza was perfect as usual. My out of town friend loved it and asked if we could go back for more tomorrow.  The only reason this Lou's location doesn't get 5 starts from me is because of where we sat. There are about 5 or 6 high top tables right by the front entrance, bar, and waiting area. This is where we sat. Now, I'm sure on a normal day (not a cold-ish Friday night), sitting there is fine. But there was a swarm of people basically on top of us and we felt a cooooooold breeze every time the door opened.

2015-06-18,4.0,"Finally tried this after trying most of the other ""best deep dish"" places in Chicago (Giordano's, Gino's, etc.) I must say, it was pretty good. Tourists flock to all the good places, and Lou Malnati's is no exception. Pro-tip: Always remember that deep dish takes at least half an hour to 45 minutes to prep, so make sure that you don't have any impending obligations less than an hour away, or call ahead. It also might be worth getting a few appetizers while you wait for that long. We got the original Lou's (roma tomatoes, mushrooms, spinach, cheeses), and the Malnati Chicago classic (sausage). The crust was pretty good, with a bit of a tart, sourdough taste, which complemented the rich toppings. Both were very good, and left all of us stuffed, with a few slices to spare. We ordered two mediums for 6 people, and the stuffed spinach bread as an appetizer, which was more than enough food. Service was a little spotty, but not enough to be a problem. The prices are actually pretty good, in my opinion, as each of us only paid around $18, including a 20% tip. Overall, not to be a deep dish hipster, but I still think Pequod's is still my favorite. Screw it, I relish being a deep dish hipster. That being said, Lou Malnati's has stood the test of time, and rightfully so. With so many locations, the convenience factor is there, and while they're all mostly tourist destinations, you'll likely get a good, consistent, deep dish pizza no matter where you go.",0.9761,0.825,0.141,0.035,0.5144850948509484

We were seated quickly upon arrival and after a short wait our server arrived and gave us what appears to be the standard greeting of... ""Our pizza's take about 40 minutes to cook should we get yours started.."" We ordered the Chicago Classic and, due the 40 minute cook time, a spinach salad to share. The Salad was a a good sized salad served with a flavorful dressing not to strong.  The pizza, when served, was actually excellent. At the recommendation of the server we opted for the Chocolate Chip Cookie Pizza to end the meal.  The server told us this took about 15 minutes to prepare which was fine. (In their menu it says to expect about 10 minutes). After what seemed like forever, (30 minutes) the ""Cookie Pizza"" finally arrived and was horrible... Nothing more then a cold, stale cookie served with a scoop of ice cream on top (probably to hide the abysmal quality of the cookie). Why it took 30 minutes to prepare this horrible thing is still questionable to me,. Certainly NOT worth that type of wait.  If we were to ever go again I would stick with the pizza and salad and skip the cookie pizza... Dessert is definitely NOT a strong point here.  Service was average. It seemed like they did not have enough servers to handle the crowd level adequately.  As we mainly went for the pizza, which as I stated was excellent, I gave 3 stars.

We were lucky we were staying only a couple of blocks away so it was very convenient walking to Lou Malnati's.  After a very short wait, the hostess seated us in the back of the restaurant and we ordered right away. (We were just about to pre-order our pizza when we were called to get seated. If there's a wait when you're there, just go ahead and place your order as you wait for your table since it takes awhile to bake.) We decided to order the Malnati Chicago Classic deep dish pizza with Lou's lean sausage, some extra cheese and vine-ripened tomato sauce on Buttercrust. We were starving by now and thought the 3 of us could finish a large. (Note: a large is meant for 4 people).  Now the long wait begins... it took over 45 minutes to an hour for our pizza to arrive at our table. The waitress said it was due to the size and because they wanted to make sure the sausage was cooked thoroughly. Now, the sausage is not the usual small pieces you get at your regular pizza places but large, slices of sausage. I'm not usually a fan of sausage, but their blend of sausage and seasoning sure makes this kind pretty tasty. You really do get your bang for your buck here.  I've had deep dish pizza before in California but this was amazing. The crust was delicious and the toppings were so fresh and flavorful. BUT, you really can start getting full after a slice... and we made the mistake of ordering a large. We should have opted for a medium pizza that was meant for 3 people. While we were so full from 2 slices, we were determined to finish the pizza... this came at a price though. We probably didn't want to see another pizza for awhile after stuffing ourselves with this pizza.  Lou Malnati's does offer other options besides pizza on their menu, but why come if you're not going to have the pizza?

I arrived around 8 PM on a Saturday night and the place was packed. I gave them my name and was told it would be in approximately 30 minute wait for a table or I could just sit at the bar. They also recommended placing the order for my pizza ahead of time since the pies generally take around 30 minutes to prepare. They have a chart on the wall near where you check in illustrating the sizes of the different size options  ranging from personal to extra-large. I was famished and was concerned the ""small"" size (one step up from personal) would not be sufficient to satisfy my appetite. The lady at the check in desk was correct, the ""small"" sized ""Malnati Chicago Classic"" (  Lou's lean sausage, some extra cheese and vine-ripened tomato sauce on Buttercrust) pie shut me down like a pile of bricks.   As you can see in the photograph I made it about halfway through slice 4/4 and that was it for me. Perhaps I should not have ordered minestrone soup, without it I may have made it through my iPod. They also have a full bar on-site, a nice touch; I had a few glasses of red wine to go with my pie. Being from the Northeast I had reservations about the Chicago style deep dish pizza, but my meal here made me a believer. The ingredients were all of high quality In the crust itself was delicious.  I still prefer New York style pizza, however if I had a place like this near my home I am sure I would eat their from time to time. Five stars for a nothing-but-positive Chicago deep-dish pizza experience.  After I finished my pie, I jumped in an Uber and headed to my next destination, but that is another story!",0.986,0.896,0.086,0.017,0.399927654927655

2015-05-29,4.0,"Look. I'm giving this 4 stars but not because it was really good pizza.  It was good...something...but we really need to come up with a different word for what this is.  It might be in the pizza order, but it is not the same species as pizza.  That said, because we don't have a word for it yet, I will call it pizza.  But it isn't pizza. I don't get it Chicago, I really don't.  There isn't a comparison to be made between NY pizza (or, just pizza, for short) and Chicago deep dish.  How do you compare the two?  How can you possibly say one is better than the other?  It's like saying chocolate is better than football or unicorns are better than rainbows.  It's not comparable. Let me get on to the ""pizza"" for a moment - it is 4 star worthy food.  I would probably go 3.5 if I could, but I can't, and its definitely better than a 3.  Heck, it better be since this is the go-to for Chicago pizza...depending on who you ask.  Apparently, you can ask 20 people in Chicago for the best pizza and get 20 different answers, but that's not much different from NY.  Anyway, I got the Lou, or something like that.  It's their signature deep dish pizza with butter crust and a flavorful tomato sauce and cheese.  It's basically what you would expect a deep dish pizza to be, though I am not sure I would go with the butter crust again.  It was good, but a bit too heavy on the buttery goodness. My girlfriend and I sat on the patio and the service was good out there, though we failed to read anything that would have warned us the food takes 35-40 minutes or else we would have planned our day better and not gotten so annoyed by the wait.  Once the food came, I will admit I devoured it.  Again, it's not that it wasn't good, it's just that you walk in expecting to be floored and really struggle with the idea of NY v. Chicago pizza.  There is no struggle, there is no contest. So, again, its good, but its not pizza.  This is what you get if your pizza was bloated, or perhaps if your pizza was allergic to bees and got stung, or nuts and was served with sausage cooked in peanut oil.  It deserves its own name and its own category.  But please, for the love of all that is good and holy in the world, stop calling it pizza and stop comparing it to NY.",0.9933,0.754,0.164,0.081,0.5353968253968254

My wife and I decided to split a small size Classic Lou Malnati's with Italian sausage. To start we all ordered local beers, the tortilla chips with three dips (for the veggie in our group) and cheese sticks for the one guy who thought he wouldn't get enough cheese with his pizza. The apps were fine and tasty along with the nice cold beers.  It wasn't long before our pizzas came out. My wife and I found the small size to be perfect for the two of us to split. The crust was crisp despite being quite thick, the extra thick layer of cheese was yummy without being gut filling, the sauce had a nice texture and taste to it and the sausages on top were lean and paired nicely overall with the pizza.

2015-05-04,4.0,"This was my first trip to Lou Malnatis, and my first taste of true Chicago deep dish pizza. Our group ordered 2 medium deep dish 1 pepperoni and 1 called the Lou which was ""spinach mix"", tomatoes and mushrooms- we ordered no mushrooms. We also got a combination app which included mozzarella sticks, fried zucchini, cheddar cubes, and fried mushrooms, and we got one called the dips with pizza chips-3 different styles of dips 1-spinach dip, 1- hummus, and 1- garlic spread. Needless to say our party of 4 had plenty of leftovers.  The Good- everything I tasted was delicious, I had mozzarella sticks, cheddar cubes, and the pepperoni pizza. The fried items were hot, fresh and not greasy, and the marinara that came with was very good. My favorite though was the pizza. The crust was buttery and crispy-somewhere between a biscuit and pizza crust, the cheese was plentiful and had that nice stretchy factor, the pepperoni was tasty, a little spicy and the sauce was great-not too heavy, lightly seasoned and just the right amount. My dining partners really enjoyed everything. The location was perfect for us-not too far from parking. The not so good-now I will say, we arrived on a Saturday around 5:30, so there was a wait, we were told 35 mins- not terrible-especially considering the nice weather, it's a weekend in downtown Chicago and the NFL draft was in town. So being our first visit it gave a chance to look over the menu, and because deep dish takes quite a while to bake, they tell you to preorder your pizza with the cashier so it'll be ready close to when your seated. We did end up actually waiting about 45 mins- and with how packed it was we waited outside- not terrible as the weather was great-but we constantly felt in the way of pedestrians and other patrons waiting. Now when we got our call saying they had a table ready we had to go back inside and wait behind people who were waiting to get on the list- it's was very unorganized to say the least. Seating was very tight quarters and the noise level is astronomical, I couldn't even hear our server. Service was chaotic, took a long time to get refills and napkins. She was very nice though, and I don't hold her completely responsible, as it was super busy. Parking- the proximity of where we parked to the restaurant was not at all bad-it was the cost. $18.00 for 2 hours! Parking in downtown Chicago is a pain and crazy expensive, however this is not the restaurants fault.  Overall our experience was good, and we will go back.

There's just a lot going on with a deep dish, and a more plain one seems to work. Crust is a bit plain, but considering how crazy thick/cheesy/intensive the rest is, that's a reasonable compromise.

We order the Malnati Chicago Classic, The Lou and the Malnati Salad. I don't know if we just ordered on a ""good day,"" but the Classic was cooked perfectly with the right amount of sauce. It wasn't dry at all. I actually prefer the Lou over the Classic because it's not has heavy and hardy as the Classic. I would also recommend getting the Malnati Salad.

If you're a cheese lover, this place is the place for you. If you're a sauce person like me, the pizza will be overwhelmingly cheesy. It fills you up or you get sick of it after once slice. Regardless, I'm so glad to have tried this place.",0.9442,0.78,0.157,0.063,0.5926339285714285
2015-04-07,5.0,"Being a New York/Jersey native, I'm used to that classic style thin crust pizza. If there's one thing that always brings a smile to my face, it's a slice of delicious pizza. So when I heard about deep dish pizza, I kind of cringed at the thought of mountains of bread and cheese on a pizza. Until I came to Lou Malnati's. Grabbed a seat at the bar and got the run down from the bartender on how they concoct this child size pizza. You can either have a pre-made pizza which is ready in about 10 minutes, or have a pizza made from scratch. I went for a small pepperoni deep dish made from scratch, which takes 35 minutes to make...  What came out after 35 minutes changed my view on pizza forever. From the first slice, which is cut and served to you by the bartender, I was taken to a happy place. The best part of this pizza is hands down, the sauce. There's an abundance of it and it taste as if someone spent hours putting it together. It's about as perfect of pizza sauce as you can get. There is a massive amount of cheese and bread, causing most human beings not to be able to finish a small pie. I was able to get through three out of the four slices. But those three slices were absolute perfection. Everything mixed perfectly. And just when you think it can't any better, you get to the crust, which is crispy buttery goodness that is seriously almost as good as the pizza. I'm not a crust guy at all, but this crust is amazing. Not much else to say here. I now understand the hype around deep dish pizza, and I've seen the light. I also understand why Chicago locals vote Lou Malnati's as the best deep dish pizza in the city, because frankly, I can't imagine it getting much better than this.",0.9756,0.877,0.1,0.023,0.5291386083052748

What I do know is that I had built this pizza up for my youngest daughter and then had to take her to Giordano's two days later in the attempt of giving her a better experience. I cannot put my finger on it, but the pizza just did not taste good. We had the old standby -- sausage and mushroom -- and the sauce was not very good, the sausage was scarce and did not have the best flavor and the crust was pretty bad ... rather cardboard-like and not the butter crust I yearned for. I had been to this location in the past year and had a good experience, so maybe they are trying to milk more profit by cheapening ingredients or something. The service was slow, but it was a Friday night and they were busy so that is understandable.  Whatever it was, it was bad and I am not likely to return.  Since I felt like my daughter did not get a good impression of the heralded Chicago pizza, I took her to Giordano's two nights later and the pizza was outstanding.",-0.8833,0.786,0.087,0.127,0.5124456654456655

My sister, her boyfriend, and a coworker put in an order for pickup (we didn't want to wait for a couple hours on a Friday night) and ended up getting a large "" The Lou"". What is this? A freakin deep dish of spinach, tomatoes, and mushrooms with a blend of cheeses, all on top of a garlic buttercrust. We're all huge fans of garlic so this pizza was just freaking off the charts with the garlic. MMMMMmmmMm.  Unlike some restaurants in the Bay area like Zachary's and Little Star that boasts authentic deep dish, Lou Malnati's is the real deal. The mix of the tomatoes, spinach, and cheese was the perfect combo, with the mushrooms adding nice flavor to each bite as well. The crust was nice and soft, brown and golden on the outsides. I've always thought Chicago style pizza was just ""whatever"" after having slices of pizza COVERED in tomato sauce at Zachary's (I think imo doing this makes me stop at one slice because the tomato sauce is just too much for me). Lou's has changed it for me--it was not slathered with a huge later of tomato sauce. Instead, it was just the perfect balance of crust, cheese, and filling. Mmm. Give me more (or ship it to me! PLEASE?!) Another thing we had on the side was the Malnati salad...but there's not much to say. Who care's about salad when you have amazing pizza to drool over?

If you're in there, sit at the bar if Justin and Joe are working they give great service, have awesome tips for local places, and are all around goodfella's.  I was chatting up some good friendly local regulars at the bar and laughing a bit louder and longer than I would in LA, thanks to the anti-hero beers, (look for the draft with the green fist tap handle), when my pepperoni personal sized pizza arrived right at the bar for me.  Heaven followed! I mean real taste-bud, eye rolling, temporary loss of consciousness culinary heaven kids!  The tomatoes on top are fresh, not canned. The texture of freshly chopped tomatoes is unmistakable. Yup turns out they use fresh globes for the pies.  The cheese and crust are perfect! Ooey-gooeyness meeting crunch in absolute harmony.  It was a filling dinner for one (not counting my previous dinner only an hour before). Ladies and gentlemen I've had pizzas from all over the world. When it comes to pizza ""pies"", Believe me, this place does it the best, and gets a rock-steady, blues harp jammin', sweet home Chicago wailing 5 stars from me.",0.9951,0.783,0.203,0.015,0.445910138248848

Like I said, I'm not a huge fan of deep dish pizza. In fact, I pretty much thought I hated it up until Lou Malnati's. And you know what else I'm not a big fan of? Delivery. I love my pie fresh and hot. LM blew these notions out of the water.  The first thing I noticed about this pie was that it holds heat WAY better than a thinner crust pie. So that kicked my delivery judgement out the window. Secondly, how is this thing not the greasiest thing ever? It just isn't. I have no idea how, but hot damn it's good. Third, that sauce. You can actually taste the fresh tomatoes--obviously homemade. The sauce had enough flavor to carry this entire cheese pizza. Fourth, this is REAL deep dish pizza. That stuff in Cleveland I thought was deep dish, isn't. Can never be.  Now I know, only Chicago knows deep dish and Lou Malnati's just might be the best.",0.932,0.807,0.131,0.062,0.4830128205128205

2015-02-28,4.0,"Oh Lou Malnati -- how do I love thee -- let me count the ways! If you are searching Yelp and have landed at the Lou Malnati's reviews you need not search Yelp any further. STOP searching Yelp, and experience Lou Malnati's pizza for yourself. Yeah, yeah, bada-bing, bada-boom, you are definitely at the right spot for Chicago style deep-dish pizza. The quality of ingredients is above 5-stars. Malnati's was voted number one deep-dish pizza several years in a row by Chicago locals, and for good reason.Yes, it is better than Gino's East, Pizzeria Uno, Pizzeria Due, Pizano's Pizza, Pequod's, Nancy's Pizza, etc. For the gastronomical experience of a pizza life time it doesn't get any better than Lou-Lou! When we lived on the corner of Illinois and Orleans, years ago, we used to walk here regularly. In the summer time, we enjoyed huge salads, ordered a few brew-skis, and our favorite deep dish pizza (sausage). The crust is crispy, never burned with a buttery and meritorious flavor! The dough is made from scratch daily, so you can taste the quality and freshness at first bite. Also, a crispy exterior creates an almost irresistible situation. The toppings are endless and the tastefully satisfying plum tomato sauce makes for the ultimate amalgamation. For some of us, it is a matter of personal preference or taste as to ""which"" place in the City has the BEST 5-star or 10-star Chicago deep dish pizza. It's the bite you always look forward to and multiplied to serve you ubiquitous satisfaction. This is exactly what Lou Malnati's does time and time again! For the most part, this location is filled with people who live in the River North and/or the Loop surrounding areas, so you have your local Chicago peeps, coupled with a few tourists. Yes, people come from all over the city, but I like that this place has more ""locals"" than tourists. I also like the diversity of the crowd here and the cool vibe that the restaurant offers. This isn't NYC pizza, so don't expect that kind of pizza here. Hey, this is Chicago where we invented deep-dish pizza that you eat with a fork and knife! This restaurant has been around for a long time now, and for good reason. If you come to Lou Malnati's when it is warmer weather in Chicago walk around the neighborhood and explore the River North neighborhood (known for art galleries and antique shops). The area has changed a lot since we lived here over 15-years ago, but it is still a vibrant, trendy, artsy section of Chicago.  It is difficult to find street parking around here, so you may end up having to park in a nearby parking lot (which could be pricey) or simply take a cab or public transportation to this location. Reservations are not accepted. You may have a long wait if you come on a Friday or Saturday. Expect to wait any where from 45 minutes to 1-1/2 hours!  4-stars = Parking (challenging; a pain in the a$$) 5-stars = Pizza - excellent -- awesomeness 4-stars = Service 4-stars = Beer and other Spirits 4-stars = Price-Point 2-stars = TV (why oh why does every restaurant feel the need to have one) When the moon hits your eye Like a big pizza pie, that's amore When the world seems to shine Like you've had too much wine, that's amore .....;D ...and this is what Lou Malnati's is to me!!!",0.9932,0.866,0.115,0.02,0.47878965006624585

After doing some intense research on the internet, Lou Malnati's seemed like the #1 place to go to. However, I wasn't too impressed.  Food: Pizza orders take about 30-40 minutes to make so you definitely want to order an appetizer if you're hungry. We ordered the 3 dip appetizer. I liked the spinach artichoke the most out of the roasted garlic, spinach artichoke and hummus. As for pizza goes, I ordered a personal Lou pizza (spinach, mushrooms, roma tomatoes) and added pepperoni. I felt like my pizza was a bit too greasy and the crust was really hard, making it difficult to bite into.  Service: Our waiter was very attentive and friendly. He constantly checked if we needed anything (food/order wise). We also asked him about the night life in the area and he was kind enough to write us a list of suggestions of where to go! Service included, I would probably rank Lou's with four stars but the food itself was okay (The ranking I gave was purely on the food because that's what Lou Malnati's is famous for =P).

The ""Lou"" was what I opted for, a whimsical affair featuring spinach mix, mushrooms and sliced roma tomatoes covered with blended Mozzarella, Romano and Cheddar cheeses on a thick, yet flaky garlic ""Buttercrust"". This Pizza is very good. No, scratch that... it is excellent. A perfect cheese to tomato ratio and the crust is doughy in the inside but does not overwhelm the other flavors. The meats follow through in the finish along with a hard hit of Garlic. One piece had me feeling pretty full but I went all in on a second slice since we simply do not have pies like these out west and I walked out feeling like the Michelin man.

I did not like the atmosphere very much.  It was very 90's chain restaurant and also a bit touristy in terms of the clientele (myself obviously contributing).  It sounds like I should give this experience 2 stars.  But I decide to give a 3 by default until and if I have tried more similar places on future Chicago visits.",-0.5878,0.852,0.065,0.083,0.5089425770308122

2015-01-19,5.0,"If you're coming to visit Chicago you have to find a place to try quintessential Chicago deep dish pizza.  I really recommend Lou Malnati's.   I really like this place. The Decour wasn't what I expected for a pizzeria , hockey shoes on the wall couldn't really make sense of the rhyme or reason for the decorations. But otherwise is a busy hubbub of a  place to eat pizza.  Great bring kids because it's so loud in there nobody will even notice that your kids are behaving poorly if indeed they do.  Judging from the way the locals talk about it the food is pretty consistent too.   Our group of six with seated within minutes without a reservation. The waiter came quickly and today I drink orders and reappeared with them very shortly.  In no time the server had made suggestions, and taking a rather complicated order. And in very little time our Malnati salad arrived. This salad is unique and delicious.  It is a mixture of romaine lettuce, tomatoes, black olives, mushrooms, salami bits and gorgonzola cheese with our Sweet Vinaigrette and romano cheese.  We ordered  family size for $12.25 and there was plenty  for six with second helpings (4 guys & 2 gals) and the sweet vinaigrette dressing was amazing and addictive. You have got to try to salad dressing.  One of our party does not eat pork and they gladly prepared a small version for him.  By the way, they have several gluten free options here. We ordered 3 large pies, which reportedly each serve 4.  The Lou (spinach mix, mushrooms, tomatoes, covered with mozzarella, romano and cheddar cheese) is DELICIOUS and the cheddar cheese blends perfectly with the spinach for a unified pizza experience in each bite.  The Malnati Chicago Classic (sausage, loads of cheese and a chunky tomato sauce) does not hold back on the meat.  This Housemade Chicago sausage covers the entire pizza.  I actually think it was one large pizza size patty!  The third was a build your own pizza ( can't remember the toppings). The crusts on all three was the trademark Buttercrust.  This crust lives up to its name with its buttery goodness.  At first glance I thought a Buttercrust would clash with the savory toppings, but no it's the perfect accompaniment for Lou Malnati's fresh pizza toppings.  The Lou's crust includes garlic which minimizes the sweetness a bit and helps to create the perfect crust for a savory all veggie pizza.  Eat here when you visit .....they have over 25 restaurants.

For years I thought lesser of you than your cousin from New York, probably due to the pasty and forgettable offerings from chain pizza joints scattered throughout the Midwest. But here in Chicago is the real-deal thing that slapped my taste buds upside the head and made them call it ""Sally"" and beg for mercy. This pizza is simply unlike any other pizza I've ever had. Living in New York for two years, I found that the vast majority of pizza places (usually with the name ""Ray"" in the restaurant title) were pretty interchangeable. But the deliciousness I had here is truly one-of-a-kind. So, which is better, New York or Chicago pizza? IT'S A TRICK QUESTION. They are two separate and delicious things. The ""classic"" that I had at Lou Malnati's is a sit-down-and-savor type of meal, not something you absentmindedly nosh while watching terrible reality shows. This was like a beautiful crimson pie stuffed with meat and other goodness. I'm a husky gent, and even I could only finish two enormous pieces before being stuffed beyond belief.

2014-12-12,4.0,"1. Verdict/Value: Decent food, decent prices, and a solid choice for deep-dish pizza in a town full of deep dish choices!  Folks looking for personal sizes of pizzas will appreciate this place. 2. Food: The Bar-B-Lou Wings ($8.75) featured just 8 drumsticks and wings, but they were big, meaty, juicy, and flavorful.  Order it with the honey BBQ sauce on the side, since they normally come over-smothered in sauce. The Malnati Chicago Classic personal sized pizza ($8.95) comes with tomatoes, sausage, and plenty of cheese.  For $0.90, you can get extra toppings; pineapple worked well for this Hawaiian diner.  Unlike some of my fellow Yelpers I had a reasonably soft crust - likely because the Classic comes with a special buttery crust.

I made two variations to it by ordering it on thin crust and adding sausage. It was so good - the thin crust was crunchy and not as filling as the deep dish pizza crusts.

My friend and I settled on Lou Malnati's as our deep dish choice. It was extremely crowded when we came in and the wait was about 35 mins. We were finally seated upstairs. I discovered a hidden gem lost in the midst of all the pizza hype here. The buffalo wings! My goodness Lou Malnati's has some of the best wings I've ever had in my life- I was so impressed. If you like wings at all, I would highly recommend this. Then came the pizza- my friend and I ordered a medium Lou and a medium Malnati Chicago classic. Fantastic pizza choices, terrible size choices. We severely underestimated the size of these things. They were so thick that we barely finished half of each one. The pizza was out of this world though- buttery thick deliciousness- full flavored sausage and the sauce was to die for.  We had so much left over and it was our last meal here, we decided to box up the rest, stuff it in our backpacks, somehow make it through airport security, and smuggle authentic Chicago deep dish pizza to Dallas. We shared it with our family and friends back home and they were in love with the taste as well. Overall great pizza, fantastic wings, and a phenomenal atmosphere with excellent service.

Put your name down and the number of your party.  Next, stand in line to place your order with the cashiers (soft drinks, water & second round of beers will be ordered from your table server). They encourage you to do this since they are very busy and by time (20mins or so) your table is ready, so will your food. As you are waiting, order a beer, they will also provide you with a fresh baked thin crust pizza as free apps. Probably to suppress the appetites of a happy mob before they morph into an angry one :) The large pizzas are big. For a party of 4 I would recommend 3 pizzas.

I took my out-of-town friend here to show him what the big fuss about Lou Malnati's was. First we got an appetizer of Garlic bread. I would expect some fantastic dish from this place, but what comes out? COLD pieces of Garlic bread which tastes exactly like it came from the frozen section in any supermarket. When we complained that it was so cold, the server doesn't even ask if we would like to replace it. All she says is 'I can toss it into the oven and reheat it for you"". I was like 'Whhhaattt?' Which restaurant does that?And doesn't she know that bread loses it's moisture and gets more crisp if re-baked! Frustrating!. We then got a veggie deep dish pizza with mushrooms, onion, olives and spinach. The pizza takes over 40 minutes to come and when it does, it's like this big goo of marinara sauce over a buttery crust. The crust had no salt, the sauce was like fresh tomatoes with no seasoning and we couldn't even taste any of the vegetables. I will definitely not be there again.

2014-10-28,4.0,"I was in Chicago for the weekend, and my girlfriend and I decided that we since we both loved pizza is would be a crime to not get some Chicago style pizza while we were in town.  The restaurant itself is very nice.  The décor is fairly modern, though sparsely decorated.  We were seated quickly though we did have to wait several minutes for our waiter to get to us.  He did a drive by, and said he would be with us soon during our wait though.  They were busy at the time, so it wasn't a big deal.   Upon arriving at our table he gave us a quick rundown, and informed us that *****all of the pizzas take around 45 minutes to cook*****.   I don't think that's a problem, but it is certainly something you want to take into consideration.  We heard other servers ask if their patrons had called ahead, so this is probably a regular practice to avoid the extended cooking time.  We ordered a Malnati Salad, Three-Cheese Bread, and The Malnati Chicago Classic. After about 20 minutes we got the cheese bread, and the salad.  I am not a salad person, so I can't really comment on the taste, but I did have a bite.  the salami bits are very crunchy, and add a flavor I didn't enjoy.  I would have enjoyed the salad without that addition.  The cheese bread is very good.  There is a good blend of cheese, with a decent flavor of garlic.  The edges of the loaf were fairly crispy with the portion under the cheese being relatively chewy but not undercooked. True to their word around 45 minutes after our order was placed our pizza arrived.  I have to say after eating this pizza I would not recommend it to anyone.  The pizza is made in layers.  Starting from the crust, followed by cheese, then a layer of sausage (I'll get to that in a minute) and then the sauce.  The crust is extremely delicious, and they use a high quality cheese.  The sausage on the other hand was pretty much like a gigantic sausage patty that covered the entire pizza.  It was fairly tough to cut through, though it wasn't overly chewy.  All in all it detracted more from the pizza than it added.  Luckily because it was a continuous piece of meat it was extremely easy to slide it off the pizza.  The only drawback was that because the sauce was on top of the sausage I had to scrape it off and add it back to the pizza.  Once I performed this minor surgery it was probably one of the best pizzas I had ever eaten.   I would probably recommend Lou Malnati's to a friend, but I would certainly not suggest the sausage patty pizza.",0.9936,0.825,0.132,0.043,0.4973875270029116

Then the pizza came.  We ordered the Malnati Chicago Classic, which came at the recommendation of our server.  It was essentially pizza crust, topped with a THICK layer of cheese, thin layer of tomato sauce, then a layer of meat.  The pizza was so dry and hardened quickly as it cooled (especially the cheese), making it difficult to cut into a mere 3 minutes after it arrived.  It was so bland too, all I tasted was the calories.  I was brought up to not waste food but after one slice I couldn't bring myself to finish another.  Service was fine and our waitress was actually quite sweet.  Half star for the salad, and another half star for her.  I hope maybe we just had a bum pie, but going forwards, I will be sticking to my New York or Italian style pizza.",0.6962,0.843,0.084,0.073,0.41984848484848486

The bartender was very friendly and charming. I ordered the 9"" pizza because I'm a hungry girl. The single probably would have been sufficient. They pride themselves on Wisconsin mozzarella and California tomatoes for the sauce. There was a nice sweetness to both, and the crust was crisp on the bottom yet doughy. I thought the crust could have been more buttery and lacked salt. They put the cheese on top of the crust, what we call an ""upside down slice"" in New York. That is followed by lean sausage, and then tomato sauce on top. It was tasty.

Very decent for the price, and we loved that we could leave our name AND our order and explore the surrounding area because they would call us once a table was open! And since we placed our order ahead of time, it was ready about 10 minutes after we sat down. Very spiffy, especially since we showed up on the later end of peak dinner hours.

Also, this is kind of random, but I noticed that the restaurant was just really dusty.  I was admiring some of the pictures and other knick knacks on the walls... only to notice a good layer of dust and cobwebs.  Kind of disgusting as they're hanging directly over our tables of food.

2014-10-13,5.0,"I was in town for one night running the marathon and before I left town had to have the best Chicago pizza.  Thanks to Yelp and other research sites I settled on Malnati's but it was close as all the pizza options are highly reviewed. I walked into Malnati's after the marathon and found a seat at the Bar and Lamar helped me choose the best pizza on the menu.  Since it was just me I wasn't sure if the personal size pizza would do deep dish justice and Lamar guided me to go with a small size to get a true feeling for the pie, plus I could have left overs and make all the passengers on my flight jealous. I went for the Chicago Classic with sausage pieces instead of the whole patty.  Lamar was very engaging at the bar while I waited for my pizza.  I learned that at Malnati's there is a 1 to 3 hour wait every day Monday through Sunday.  I had arrived around 12:30 and the place was about quarter full but 30 minutes later the place was packed and the bar was hopping with marathoners and spectators.  I think if a place has a 1 to 3 hour wait every day it tells you a lot. The pizza arrived and finally I had my chance to have my first Chicago deep dish pizza.  Did i make the right choice?  Would it hit the spot and drive me crazy to want to come back to Chicago for the pizza alone. It was spectacular.  The tomatoes are the hero of this pie, not to say that all the other parts aren't pure perfection because they are.  The tomatoes taste like they were fresh picked, so pungent, such bright flavor, really, really special.  The cheese was creamy with just the right amount in each bite.  The sausage was soft but firm and flavorful but not overpowering.  And the crust was fantastic.  Crispy at the bottom and doughy and crunchy around the edge.   This pizza reaches a perfect balance that's hard to match.  All components work together to create a masterpiece, using each of their unique food assets to create a sum that far exceeds the amazingness of the parts.  You can taste how they've been doing this right for a long, long time and why it will always work. So if you are visiting Chicago and have one shot at the finest Chicago pizza, you got to go to Lou's. Thanks for the great service Lamar!  Your stories of snowmobiling up in Minnesota sound amazing and hope to get there someday.",0.9974,0.777,0.187,0.036,0.5113139329805996

The calamari was cooked perfectly and not rubbery. The marinara sauce added a sweet, tanginess to balance with the salty, spicy batter. We ordered a Pepperoni Deep Dish Pizza with olives and butter crust. The crust was crispy and buttery. The pizza was full of gooey mozzarella cheese. The sauce was mild, but brought all of the ingredients together. The pepperoni and olive combination is onolicious! Their pepperoni is more like salami versus the pepperoni that you would traditionally get on a regular pizza. The taste hasn't change since my first Lou Malnati's Deep Dish Pizza in 2007.

My opinion of what makes this so good, is that they are not trying to get all 5 star chef on you and add all kinds of ingredients, but they stick to the basics. Firstly, the crust is so wonderful, that if you are a bread person, you can just eat on that by itself.  The cheese is and sauce are so simple, and that is what to me, wakes your mouth up and you begin to wonder, how did you go your whole life not eating this. There is always a wait, but that is to be expected. I personally think it is worth the wait. When we use to drive there after a 9 hour drive, we were always willing to wait, even after we were already tired.  In all of my 12 years of visiting this place, it never disappoints.

The bottom was a bit less soggy, and the crust was a bit flakier, but that's it. It was not a drastic difference to either of our tastes.  Service was fine, but we were a little letdown by the feel of this place. Didn't have that established, old school pizza place feel - felt more like a newer chain. The pizza wasn't an event, so I guess we should have gone somewhere with more history. Beer selection was underwhelming, but that's expected.  The order also took a very, very long time (almost a full hour) and it was far from busy.

Just like in New York, Chicago is no exception when it comes to pizza joints battling out to claim themselves as the best pizzeria for deep dish. Fortunately, based on the helpful suggestions of several locals, my friends and I chose Lou Malnati's as our culinary introduction to Chicago.  We came here on a Sunday evening when the pizzeria was bustling, and we placed an order in advance for ""The Malnati Chicago Classic."" A half-hour later, we were seated upstairs in a windowless dining room along with 30 or so other diners. It's not the best ambiance, but the service and the food make up for it. I was expecting our pizza to be ready by the time we were seated, but we had to wait an additional 20-25 minutes -- what was the point of placing an order? To prevent ourselves from becoming hangry, we requested a few appetizers.  Caesar Salad with Chicken: Tomatoes on a Caesar Salad? Odd, but judgments aside, this was a good salad to start off dinner.  Calamari Fritti: Fried deliciousness, and not at all chewy! It was a hit at our table.  The Malnati Chicago Classic: Worth the wait! The sauce was perfect and didn't have that prominent acidic flavor. Not being a fan of sausage toppings on my pizza, I digged the sausage on ours. The cheese was nice and stringy, and the garlic Buttercrust was perfect and not hard to bite into.   Service: As busy as the evening was, our server did an awesome job.

Got the Classic, which says it has extra cheese but omg was it a lot of cheese.  Another reviewer said it best, the first few bites were great, but after awhile the cheese cools down and becomes kinda rubbery.  Combine that with a thin layer of sauce and a slightly-still-doughy bottom crust, and eating became more of a chore.  The outer crust was buttery and good enough to eat.

2014-09-02,1.0,One of the worst pick up setups in River north. Hostesses forget you are there.

2014-09-02,3.0,"Lou Malnati's has the potential to be good, but the River North location did not impresss. After hearing of the place from multiple friends, we decided to try Lou's to see what the buzz was about.  Wait time wasn't bad, but this may have had to do with the holiday and coming earlier in the evening (around 6pm). To be honest, I'm not sure what to think of the interior and decor -- not sure if they are going for old school italian, sports bar or dirty. Having lived in NYC, we decided to try both the deep dish and the thin crust. The deep dish was NOT worth the 45 minute wait -- I'm not sure if the pizza had sat out for a while, but it tasted like they had baked the crust, sauce and cheese separately. Although fresh, the pizza looked like it came out of a refrigerator.  The thin crust was actually much better, but not really what we had come for. Be sure to add meat / veggies to give it some flavor! Overall, forgetful experience, will continue to search this city for some good deep dish!",0.9741,0.76,0.168,0.072,0.5368888888888889

We were able to quickly place the order for a Classic pizza (which takes about 30-40 min to bake). We also ordered a house salad, which the waiter made sure would be big enough for two to share. It was my first time eating a Chicago style deep dish pizza. It seemed more like a pie to me, rather than a pizza, but was very tasty nonetheless (especially the buttery crust). The salad was also nice. The service was very quick and the waiter was very friendly. When he arrived with the check he realized that he had forgotten to charge for the salad, but told us it was on the house. We gave a very generous tip. Overall a good pizza experience with good service.",0.9745,0.819,0.166,0.015,0.5007309941520468
2014-09-01,4.0,"Because it seemed like one of the most authentic pies, I tried The Malnati Chicago Classic. With a menu description of ""Made with Lou's lean sausage, some extra cheese and vine-ripened tomato sauce on Buttercrust. It's authentic Chicago!"" I felt like that was exactly what I was looking for. The Buttercrust was wonderful. Every pizza should be on some type of buttery crust. Actually, I've decided everything should include butter. It brings happiness. Wu Tang and butter are for the children! The sauce was also delicious. It had a spicy element to it, but the primary aspect was a deep, robust tomato - exactly what you want from a great tomato sauce. My only problem with my Malnati Chicago Classic was the sausage. You have the option of getting the sausage crumbled (common with most sausage on pizza) or a sausage patty on the pizza. I decided to try the sausage patty, and it ended up being my only mistake with this meal. For whatever reason, the texture wasn't nearly as good on the sausage as it typically is when you get sausage crumbled on a pizza. This was only thing that keep my pizza from being the complete package. There's a reason Lou Malnati's has been successful in Chicago for the past 40 years. The sauce and crust are always the key to making any great pizza, and Lou's has both of these covered.",0.9697,0.834,0.128,0.039,0.5679012345679012

2014-08-31,4.0,"I've eaten deep dish before in California when I was little, but I wanted to try the real deal in the windy city.  So we came to check this place out on a Monday for lunch. It was packed with tourists and locals, which I guess was a good sign.  We could pre-order our pizzas at the counter while waiting for our table, and that greatly reduced the wait time once we were seated.  Brilliant!   They also had an interesting concept here where they'll send you a text message when your table is ready, instead of handing out pagers.  I've never seen that before. My bf recommended getting the lunch special with a small personal deep dish pizza, a side salad or cup of soup, and a drink for under $10. When we sat down, we told our server we were both getting the lunch specials, but apparently the pre-order ticket didn't reflect that (even though we had told the woman at the counter).  But it wasn't an issue and our server was able to change the order immediately.   I got the cheese and sausage pizza with minestrone soup and pink lemonade.  I liked how the soup was chock full of meat and veggies, but I wouldn't say that the taste totally blew me away.  The lemonade was nice and refreshing. When our pizzas came out, I was a bit disappointed by the little disc on my plate.  I had imagined a large pie, immensely thick and piled high with dense toppings.  However, I guess my vision wasn't really realistic with a mini personal pizza.  :/ Well, that ""little disc"" turned out to be quite delicious!  I loved their signature Buttercrust™--so buttery and tasty!!  That was probably the most delicious crust I've ever eaten in my life.  And the sausage was a gigantic layer that covered the entire surface of my pizza--not little chunks sprinkled throughout. The meal was actually the perfect amount of food, so I'm glad we got the lunch special.  Plus, this restaurant had a sports theme with memorabilia decorating the walls, and our booth had Magic Johnson's jersey framed above us.  It's like that spot was meant just for me--L.A. girl!  Go Lakers!  Haha.  The perfect setting for some yummy food.  :)",0.9979,0.781,0.202,0.017,0.6046366843033512

Having grown up on NY style pizza, it took a bit of a mental adjustment to accept this. The way I got around this psychological block was by not thinking about this as pizza. Instead, think of it as what it is: a savory pie. My wife (a true New Yorker) had trouble making this adjustment, so she wasn't super amused by this Chicago treat. I, on the other hand, found it quite delicious, although the crust was definitely a bit too hard. What I've been told by a couple of Chicago buddies is that when you order the personal sized pizza, the crust tends to be a bit more firm. I was able to confirm this at two other places after this one, where we got the sharing-sized pizzas. I must also mention the stuffed bread appetizer. It was good in so many ways.

The hostess said there would be an hour wait, but we could order it to go and have the food within 30 minutes. We went with this offer originally, but once we realized how cold it was outside, we decided to ask to hostess to put us on the wait for a table. About 30 minutes we, we decided to check in to see how much longer the wait with. Apparently there was a mix up and our name was taken off the list completely. They said they would solve it and get us a table soon. About 30 minutes later, we asked about for the approximate wait. They had never solved the issue.  However, at this point, they brought the manager out who apologized profusely. He immediately bumped us to the top of the list, cleared a table for us personally and sat us.

The salad was delicious, it was light but the creaminess of the goat cheese definitely paired well with the more sweet strawberries they used as their fruit. The onions also added that sweet crunch. The Chicago classic deep dish was to die for. It had the perfect ratio of ultra gooey cheese to meat ratio. And I love that the sausage wasn't little pieces strewn randomly about...it was a 1/4"" sausage patty enveloping the entire pie. That's LOVE.

I think I still have Gino's East and Uno's left to try, but I have to say my favorite deep dish is from Lou's. The ratio of sauce, cheese, meat, and carb is undeniably the best. Also that butter crust is so good- I could eat it for dayyzzz. My friends and I ordered a half chicago classic and half pepperoni. Butter crust vs no butter crust was the difference between night and day. I will never make the mistake of not ordering butter crust again. Anyways there's always a long wait here and the interior is kinda dingy and crowded since it is always so busy. However, it's the best deep dish I have had thus far and deserves five stars.

BUT I can say that the the pizza here will be something that I will crave for years to come.  I went there with a bigger group (9 people) on a Sunday afternoon. It was still hopping, but the wait was only 45 minutes and there were plenty of furniture shops to walk around in the area. We did put our orders for pizzas in, per the hostess' suggestion. We got the large Lou and the Chicago Classic. First of all, they say that a large pizza feeds 4 people. Total bullshit. That thing easily feed like 6 people. And not 6 little petite girls that will normally only eat a salad for lunch. Like 6 people that just did a triathlete and then feel like gnawing their hands off as the hunger hits as the endorphin high fades away (and yes, we were actually in town for a triathlon and we race to eat). But before we get to the pizza, which is making me drool just thinking about, we also ordered 2 orders of mozzarella sticks and a large Malnati salad to munch on while waiting for the pizzas. The mozzarella sticks were just normal apps that you can get anywhere, nothing special, but someone at the table really wanted them. But the salad ... oh the salad. It was delicious! Normally I don't like sweet Italian dressings, but it balances out the saltiness of the salami, olives, and cheese very well. I had to stop eating the salad knowing the pizza was coming.  And the pizzas came. Everyone on the table was doubting that 2 pizzas would be enough. And when we were looking at pizzas, we still doubted that it would be enough. But then we all had a slice. And the table went silent. We were too engrossed in the cheese and butter crusts and just the general amazing-ness of what a chicago style pizza should be. I don't think any New York style pizza was able to do what these pizzas did to us. Everyone had 2 slices and were in pain by the time we called uncle. But we still had half a pizza left that we left with the only person that lives in Chicago (he just moved there from DC).  The service was amazing. Our waitress made sure that our glasses never went empty. The only thing is that the upstairs room that we were seated in was that it was sooo warm.

My friend's and I tried probably every major deep dish place in the city and most of us concluded that Lou's had the best pizza. When we came by for lunch it was extremely packed on a Saturday afternoon. The good thing is that you can order your pizza ahead at the counter so that it comes out once you get seated. Just grab a couple beers at the bar and you're set. My party got 2 pizzas here, The Chicago Classic and the Lou. The Chicago Classic had to be one of the best pizzas I have ever had , EVER. What made it unique was the the sausage was a giant patty, not crumbles like you are used to. This gives you a bite of sausage with every bite. The sauce and cheese they use was very good but what sent this pizza over the edge was def the crust. It was so buttery and flaky yet not heavy. The Lou we got since we felt like we needed some veggies. This pizza was ok, I preferred the Veggie pizza at Giordano's but the Lou was still good nonetheless.  Besides the pizzas we got the Malnati salad which was very good and an order of bruschetta for an app. The bruschetta ok. Nothing too fancy to talk about. The service here was also top notch. Our server was extremely friendly and attentive. She got everything to us quickly and check up on us often to make sure everything was to our likings.

The short version is that Giordano's is still my favorite. I had the lunch special, which is a salad and a personal pizza with a drink, plus I ordered a starter of garlic bread. The salad was a typical side salad, so nothing good or bad there. To be fair, I love me some garlic, but the garlic bread seemed somewhat bland. Definitely needed the marinara sauce on the side to help give it some flavor. The pizza itself was good, but not as good as Giordano's, IMO. On the plus side, the lunch special is available on the weekends at Lou Malnati's, which is not true for Giordano's, so if that's what you're after, then Lou Malnati's is not a bad option.

Fine, I thought, I'll do it when we are leaving. Then the waiter comes and asks if we want drinks. But then he tells us that he can't serve us until we go and close out our tab at the bar!

This wasn't too far from our hotel, so my mom and I dropped by for lunch. We ended up waiting about 15-20 minutes, so not bad.

We ordered the spinach salad and the Lou's special, which has spinach and tomato. Spinach salad was delicious - came with lots of freshly sliced strawberries, goat cheese, and a balsamic vinaigrette. The pizza was super disappointing. The crust was yeasty and underdone, I believe, and not as buttery flavored as I would have imagined it would be. It was pretty bland and actually...quite healthy tasting. Normally I have one slice of deep dish and that is ENOUGH. My mom and I ended up finishing a small pizza.  Maybe we ordered the wrong thing. The fact that there was no sauce made this literally cheese, spinach, tomatoes, and crust. It wasn't very well seasoned, so perhaps a more traditional pizza from here would be better.

I could have been comfortable with only one slice, but I loved the lou slice so much I had to go for another.

2014-06-03,4.0,"When in Rome...well, in Chicago...you've got to try the deep dish pizza once. I'm not a pizza person, really, hardly ate it back home unless someone else insisted on getting one. So, first day out we came to LM's for the famed Chicago deep dish. We had ""The Lou"" which featured marinara sauce, cheese, spinach, and mushrooms topped with slices of fresh tomatoes. The pizza came out piping hot (so do let it cool a bit, lest you want to burn your tongue and kill all the taste buds along with the burn). The first bite of the gooey cheese oozing and steaming along with the tomato, sauce, etc. did not disappoint. It made my taste buds do a little dance! The crust was light and buttery in spite of its thickness. Loved it, I dare say! A great start for our Chicago experience. Only complaint here was that the sauce was not evenly distributed so that portions near the edge were lacking this deliciousness. This was Sunday lunch. Then after a horrible experience at another deep dish joint, we returned on Wed for lunch to erase the bad taste from our mouths and memories. This time we had a half-&-half, ""The Lou"" and pepperoni/sausage/mushroom combo, with extra sauce. While the toppings were still perfectly done, given it was half/half the tomato slices were smaller in order to fit in the tinier space. And while the crust was still good, it was not as light and buttery as the one we had on Sunday...go figure. Still we enjoyed it very much. I have to say we like LM better than the others we've tried, not just in Chicago but elsewhere also. For deep dish, LM is the one to beat. Off course we didn't try its other locations, but it sure makes for a great reason to try them all. Too bad, we had to leave and couldn't get to them. For the 3 of us, we ordered the small (we're light eaters). Medium in deep dish would have been way too much, and we couldn't deal with leftovers at the hotel. Am I now converted to deep dish? ...only in Chicago at LM's. One minor complaint, the hostess on Wed was not very nice to us. For every table she led customers to, she'd lay out the menus in front of each place setting, but she simply tossed the 3 menus onto the center of the table for us. (No, the place was not busy since it was past the lunch hour rush.) She did, however, say ""Have a good day"" when we left.",0.9226,0.868,0.084,0.048,0.49238147195593995

And we both agree that Lou's is better. We're still not fans of deep dish pizza but no question Lou's wins.  Similar wait times as Giordano's. But one big difference, at Giordano's they call out ur name looking for you. And if u don't hear them or miss them, ur screwed. That is what happened to one couple when we got to Giordano's. But at Lou's, they use technology. They get ur number so that when ure next, u get both a call and a text that ur table is ready. Easy for them, easy for me. No need to worry about whether or not u missed ur name being called like that on couple at Giordano's.  And now the pizza. The pizza is a million times better than Giordano's.

We ordered 3 large pizzas for a group of 12 hungry people. I had no idea how big they would be and how HEAVY The boxes were!! When I met the guy In the lobby, he handed me the boxes and I had to take the elevator to the top floor and walk to the end of the hall and I literally had to stop partway because the boxes were so heavy! We ordered two all veggie pizza's and a sausage and pepperoni and I was starving. After devouring 1 slice, I tried to get another but was so full off of my first slice that I could barely get two bites from the second slice. Everyone LOVED it and all we could do was bite, chew, and say Mmmmm. The room was silent aside from the Mmmmm sounds being made. The pizza was cheesy, saucy, and flavorful and absolutely PERFECT! I didn't taste the meat pizza but the veggie pizza has to be the best pizza...not just deep dish pizza but overall, the best I've had in life and yes, I've eaten plenty of NYC pizza.

We had an appetizer that the four of us shared and a sausage and other meats deep dish. Clean it off with a few beers and it was perfect. We were full and satisfied. Great for a cheat day (low carb diet here). The only thing that kept it from a five star was our server. Service is a big deal for me as you can see in my other reviews and our server, an older gentleman, wasn't good. It was a freezing cold day, we're not from Chicago, so during our table conversation he proceeded to chime in and start bashing a particular political party over climate change? It wasn't cool.

It would only come up on my radar when a friend is visiting from out of town or a non-local friend has the crave.  The usual order consists of: Malnati Chicago classic, Malnati's salad, and calamari. What makes Lou's deep dish better than others is it's not overly stuffed. The sausage is lean and not overly salty as it carelessly rests on a bed of vine-ripened tomatoes. One can easily down two slices without feeling too guilty unless you also ordered appetizers. The calamari was standard, lightly breaded, and seasoned. It delight to have but I would not say it's a must-order. As for the salad, I could care less. Honestly, when I go for deep dish, I'm not looking for a healthy meal. I mainly ordered it so as to not further provoke my out-of-country friends into thinking what unhealthy and detrimental eating habits Americans have.

This was our 2nd night out and we just had an AMAZING first experience w/ deep dish pizza the night before at Pizzaria Uno (the crust was garlic-buttery crisp, not too thick, and the fillings - sausage, marinara, mozz - was absolutely to die for). It was so great we wanted deep dish pizza again. It was a Friday night, 6pm, was told it there would be a 45 min wait but we can pre-order our pizza since it takes about 30-45 min to prep/bake. Ok, fine, no biggie. We waited 45 minutes the night before. An hour and 35 minutes later of standing room only (the front half of the restaurant were all the patrons waiting in every available inch of space, the back half was a small room of tables). We sat down, was thanked for waiting (props on the customer service), and ordered the rest of our food (cesar salad & drinks).  Our waitress was friendly and considerate and was swamped but took good care of us - drinks were refilled, food came out as soon as it was ready. After waiting almost 2 hours (1 hr and 55 minutes) for our pizza, we were excited when it arrived. And then sadly very disappointed. The Lou Malnati Chicago Classic (sausage, cheese, sauce, butter crust): Soggy, crust. toppings/fillings were fine, but the crust. yuck. this is exactly what i was afraid chicago deep-dish style pizza would be.  Maybe it was a bad night, maybe they rushed this and took it out too soon, but just. YUCK. The salad came after the pizza and was covered in dressing. no green was left untouched. I couldnt even finish a small plate. GROSS.

While ordering, we were told that it would take 30 minutes for our pizza to arrive. 30 friggin' minutes? I could watch a sitcom in that time. I smiled on the inside because I knew my opinions were once again about to be confirmed.  30 minutes later, I was forced to reevalute every decision I had ever made in my entire life. How many things have I been wrong about?!! I decided that I would have been willing to wait twice as long for this perfection.  Of course all of this occurred in complete silence because there was pizza to be consumed, savored, and enjoyed.  Sadly that trip came to an end but I came home on a mission to find that same quality pizza in South Florida. Mission failed! I thought I could push those thoughts of gooey cheese with a soft, yet somehow crispy dough out of my mind, but I do not posses magical powers.

With that said, if you find yourself wanting deep dish near your hotel, go to Lou Malnati's, it is still my favorite deep dish. Go here especially if you are visiting Chicago and haven't made reservations anywhere else. Two reasons: 1) Deep dish dinner is a must and 2) You are seriously going to wait over an hour (if not much more) at any restaurant if you did not make any other reservation. I plead with the tourists who come here, do not complain about the wait! It is like that everywhere. Plan ahead or plan to wait. I only give this location 3 stars instead of 4 because I have been to the Gold Coast location which is just better. It's bigger so the line goes quicker. This location is just smaller, and filled with out of towners who (rightfully) want some Chicago Pie. No foul on the tourists, just makes it busier in a busy city.

We had picky eaters in the bunch whose palates haven't grown in yet apparently because they didn't think their thin crust cheese pizza was as good as little ceasars, but they were wrong. It was good for a plain cheese pizza. The deep dish my family ordered had pepperoni, green pepper, onion, sausage and sliced tomatoes. Very good in the buttery crust. Personally I don't like pepperoni in my deep dishes but it was a consensus so I didn't fight it.  Our waitress was a gem. Kate(ie?) Just cool, always was around when we needed her, had an eye on our refills. Final note: While you wait, you can put in your order for pizza. They will cook it most of the way and then finish it off when you are seated and ready to feast. This is a good gig because deep dish can take upwards of 45 mins to cook, so it double duties the waiting time for the food by ordering before you're seated. Thanks for taking the time to read before you feed! Hope it helped.",0.9896,0.861,0.122,0.018,0.5511369047619047
2014-04-11,4.0,First time experiencing Deep Dish in Chicago and it was really delicious. The server was really helpful to all of us Wisconsinites that needed a bit of help picking the best pizza. He told us about their specials and even brought out a dessert for my friend's birthday without us requesting it. I definitely recommend for a group or just for a dinner.

2014-03-28,4.0,"As a disclaimer, deep dish pizza shouldn't be enjoyed frequently. As pretty much a life-long Chicago-ian, I would say my intake of deep dish depend strictly on the number of out-of-towners that pass through this glorious city. So when time comes to satisfy the curiosities of the passing by tourist, my preference is to set time aside for Lou Malnati's offering.  I have tried both the Lou and the Chicago Classic, and I would say that these offerings are for the most part really consistent. The pie is a bit shallow in comparison to other deep dish offerings in the city, but I think it allows the person to safely enjoy 2 slices without feeling like a blob afterwards. I like the sausage that they use on the pizza on the Chicago classic. It is not too oil or salty, and is works in good harmony with the bed of tomatoes that accompany it. The Lou is a good choice with people not too fond of sausage, and provides a nice mixture of mushrooms and spinach (both favorites of mine in deep dish). The crust (which is the main standout in differentiating the different pizzerias), is much lighter and crispier than other places. I'm not a fan of very doughy crusts so this maybe my bias in this regard.  The appetizers and salads are a nice change of pace from the huge hearty pizzas, but I'm not sure it's really worth it. I don't mind skipping them, and I don't mind having a side of light salad. Just kind of a big ""meh."" We tried the thin crust pizza with pepperoni. I think my bias against pepperoni may have shifted my opinion, but there were a few fundamental problems with the offering. The pepperoni was layered underneath the cheese, stretching across the entire pizza. I think that's too much pepperoni to pizza ratio. The pizza was also brought out a bit cold. The cheese had already hardened by the time I got to it, and the crust was a bit hard. While it wasn't awful, I would definitely stay away from it next time.  Overall, I think there are very small differences in the many deep dish pizzas in Chicago. However, I would say that Lou's is my favorite (although, due to the proximity to my apartment, it is not my go-to). The ingredients are quality, the pricing is very fair, and the overall experience (besides the long expected wait times) is consistent and good. So if you're in need of a decent deep dish offering, I would definitely recommend giving Lou Malnati's a try.",0.989,0.797,0.137,0.066,0.49780922431865826

After years perfecting his craft in other pizza shops, Lou was finally ready to venture out on his own.

So good in fact, that we had the left-overs for breakfast the next day!

The bartender was doing a great job, as no one appeared to be wanting for a drink.  When my boyfriend (who was 3 people back) from the bar raised his hand, she immediately took his beer order, which was impressive with the crowd all around.

The wait was 2 hours. We had walked here from our hotel and were already starving.  They do keep samples at the hostess stand, but it didn't help that they were mostly meat offerings. And the other starved guests were grabbing rows of these.  Once you sit down, they inform you that a deep dish will take 40 minutes to bake. Pretty good hustle, if you ask me. Long waits means you'll sell a lot more salads and appetizers. We ended up with 2 salads and an order of spinach bread.  There was nothing terribly memorable about this place. I liked that they dust the pan with cornmeal, it added a nice crunch. I just remember the dough being kind of raw, even though we ordered ""well done"".

I started off by getting the calamari. Lightly breaded with a fresh dipping sauce. The batter wasn't thick, and so you're able to actually able to taste something other than deep fried goop.  It was delicious. When it comes to ordering, me and my compatriots do one thing: We order the Lou Malnati's classic, and then add pepperonis on top. So you're getting sausages, a ton of cheese, and a bed of pepperonis. It takes about 30 minutes to get your casserole, so be patient, grab a beer, and enjoy your company. Once your casserole arrives, your server will chop up your initial pieces, and then its game time. The crust is crispy, flaky, and oh so buttery. The sauce is rich with flavor, and will knock your socks off. The large chunks of italian sausage will not leave you wanting. And to top it off, slices of crispy pepperoni complete the absolutely amazing casserole. We liked it so much we ordered a bunch to take back with us to LA (ask your server on the best way to do it).

The staff was very friendly and service was extremely fast for an early dinner!",0.9817,0.763,0.195,0.042,0.416431623931624

The pizzas, once the pizza's arrived we were drooling just at the smell! After the server put the pizzas on the table she proceeded to cut slices for everyone, you could hear the crispy crust!! Made you want to stick your face directly into the pizza!! Once on my plate, I decided to fork and knife it for the first bite... oh soo good! top notch, one of the better deep dish pizza's I have had! Hearty, flavorful, and enough cheese but not too much to bring the whole pizza together. Lastly, the crust... it was divine, crispy, flaky, butter, and sooo darn good.. almost like a prefect pastry crust expect savory not sweet. Made you eat each slice all the way to the end! No left over crust here!! So the pizza's were oh soo good!! Therefore we decided to order a Choc. Chip cookie dessert pizza... that was great as well, the Choc. chip cookie crust was rich and gooy but soo good - good for 4 people.  Again I would highly recommend Lou Malnati's!

I ordered the ""Malnati Chicago Classic,"" which came with Lou's lean sausage, some extra cheese and vine-ripened tomato sauce on Buttercrust.  It was positively ambrosial.  The cheese just melted in my mouth and the crust was so crunchy.  It was such a glorious meal on a crisp October day in Chicago.  The personal pan size was enough food for this hungry foodie! The service was great, though you should expect it to take at least 30 minutes for your food to come out (since they put it in the oven and ensure that the crust comes out very nicely).  Also be aware that this restaurant can be PACKED.  We fortunately visited at around 6:30pm on a Tuesday night, so it wasn't too terrible yet.  About half an hour into our dinner, we noticed large groups being turned away because they didn't have reservations and there really wasn't any space.  This restaurant is quite big, space-wise, so that just tells you how popular this place is!  This place is totally worth any wait, in my opinion.

I just moved to Chicago a month ago and have already tried Pequod's so the other pizza joints are really going to have to ""wow"" me after P's.  Unfortunately, Lou's was a major fail.

I begged to place the order before he got there so it could be ready in a relatively reasonable time after he arrived.  They supposedly put in the order. However, after he finally showed and after we sat down, we STILL waited another 50 minutes for the ""famous"" Lou's pizza to come out.  First of all, we had ordered a medium. What a huge mistake. It was huge. It could've easily fed four, maybe three fatties haha. Second of all... wait, wait, before I get to that... Is it me or is a pizza supposed to have four specific things: dough, sauce, cheese, and whatever other crap you choose to put on your pie (""toppings""). Well, it was missing one very very vital thing! ...Sauce, sauce, where art thou?! It was seriously just dough, a massive amount of cheese, pepperoni, and GREASE. So much grease that I had to take napkins and soak it up in order to 'enjoy' a slice. [this was my second of all rant] Third: Taste test! The pizza tasted okay but definitely does not win the crown for Chicago's best deep dish.

I had high expectations, having heard great things about Chicago pizza. I ordered over the phone and walked over to the restaurant to pick it up. It took about 30 minutes for my pizza to arrive - this was not a good start. When I ate the pizza a few minutes later in my hotel, I was very disappointed. This was a sausage pie and the sausage overshadowed every other aspect of the pizza. There was basically a giant piece of chewy, salty, tasteless meat taking up the entire radius of the pie, covered with a thick layer of gummy cheese. Under this was a skimpy lawyer of tomato sauce. Not only were the proportions way off, but none of the components tasted particularly good individually. The sum of these parts was even worse. In an effort to sate myself for the coming flight home, I ended up pulling the meat patty off of the pizza and trying just the crust. This was similarly unappetizing. I ended up tossing most of the pizza and getting a sandwich at the airport.  Perhaps dining in is the way to go. Perhaps the larger pies provide a more balanced pizza.

Seating came soon thereafter, maybe 10 minutes, and we were off and running. Our server was not super personable - but obviously busy so that's understandable. We order up some beers, the salad, and started waiting. And waiting. And waiting. Then the salad came. Beers meanwhile needed replacing.  Waiting... Waiting...... 2nd round of beers show up and the table next to us sits down.  Then more waiting.  I won't bore you anymore with the copious waiting we experienced, but when the adjacent table got their pizza before us, I'd had enough. We flagged down our hustling server and ask what's up. The only response is, 'yeah it should be out soon'.  I agreed. It should be. It better be. (I'm actually angry at this point). When our pie finally showed, no apologies were offered, even though the aforementioned 'other table' had already finished eating theirs.

2013-10-31,3.0,"I so want to be a fan to Chicago style pizza. So. But this place could not make me stray from my love of NY style pizza. I love the fact that the pizzas seem to be fresh or at least it takes 35 minutes to get one (not a bad thing, just be advised).  Overall, I liked the fact that there was a veggie ""lou"" pizza and that one slice alone is totally filling because of its density.  The place is a bit dark, puts you into a post prandial coma. The sports memorabilia is very ""chicago"" and fun to look at. Great service and those waitresses seem to get a fabulous upper bod workout dishing out those slices.",0.9718,0.747,0.212,0.041,0.46444444444444444
2013-10-30,4.0,"""Illuminati???"" - No, ""Lou Malnati"".  The number one repeated recommendation from Chicagoans (Chicagans? Chicagies? .....pizza boasters extraordinaire).  So we strolled on over to one of their many locations.  Lemme tell ya, about three dozen other people had the same Saturday night dinner plan ( - das how you know eez gooood - ).  We put our name in for the hour wait and then perched like comfortable little vultures around the bar - hovering over every stool with pending check. After a mere 55-minute wait, two seats opened up at the bar and we settled in and placed our pizza orders.  Drinks were delicious (though, there wasn't a wide variety to the available liquor list) and our pizzas came out of the kitchen in about 20minutes.  SUGGESTION : get the""Individual""-size pizza - mine (tomatoes + spinach + moz) was just the right size without over-stuffing myself.  The flavor : crust was DELISH, but the tomatoes kind of left me with a watery taste (I think it needed some basil / seasoning). For dessert we were served their Chocolate Chip Pizza (a cookie freshly baked up in the individual-sized pan, topped with vanilla bean ice cream, whipped cream, and a cherry).  Do ya see how I said earlier ""get the 'Individual'-size pizza""? ....this is why.  You want this cookie pizza after your cheesy pizza.  You just do.  Gooey melted buttery cookie with ice cream - it's fun for kids AND adults alike. Service was great and the buttercrust was just as delicious as everyone had proclaimed it to be.  Sitting at the bar and watching the world series while I was served delicious things was also stellar.  If you're in the area and don't mind a line : GO HERE!  Even if it's to order take-away to binge on buttercrust in the privacy of your own home - I wouldn't judge (it's probably not a bad thing that they don't deliver to my neck of the woods!).  This spot is totally second-date-friendly (for the casual atmosphere, yummy food, and the price).",0.9906,0.873,0.119,0.009,0.5891941391941392

This place was mentioned most often and was the closest to my hotel.

I spoke with them on the phone about the service we received, and the rep was very apologetic. They stated that they are not perfect, is a family run restaurant chain, and apologized for an experience we should not have had. Since we are from California, they compensated us with a digital gift card thats good for an online purchase of any food products/gifts that they sell, along with their partner companies. In the end, great follow up customer service.

2013-10-28,4.0,"I know there are a lot of deep dish pizza place in Chicago, but this place was something that my brother and I during our road trip stumbled upon.  Being on the road for 4 days and arriving one stop before Indiana, took my brother to Chicago to explore!  At that time, we were both starving and try to find a nearest deep dish place and this one was a pretty good walking distance (approx. 30-45min from Millennium Park).  It was a nice atmosphere place and the server was very knowledgeable and helpful! We had a hard time deciding what size and what type of deep dish and the server suggested us that we can easily finish a small easily (we both got three slices) and he allowed us to do half and half of their Chicago Classic and ""The Lou""!  This worked out perfectly because we were able to try a slice of each and had one extra slice to choose which one we preferred! Both were good Now I don't have any knowledge of deep dish pizza and the only kind I had was BJ's Brewhouse's style.  I remembered it being very doughy and just too much bread. Yuck!  But here . . . oh man. . . . was I blown away!! First off, it takes 45min or so for these pizza to come out and it's worth the wait!! So while you wait, you can drink and eat appetizers or salads, but you really don't want to do that cause you'll fill yourself up quick.  When the pizza came out, the crust and the bottom portion were nice and crunchy on the outside, but nice and not too doughy in the middle! The topping was phenomenal on these pies and my image of deep dish thought it was going to be heavily sauced, but at Lou's, it had the right amount of sauce on it!! I think my brother and I did not finish our first slice cause we were just in complete awe and just mesmerized by the texture and the taste of these deep dish!  We were both satisfied and felt content leaving this place! Just FYI, this place gets packed around dinner time (we arrived right before the rush).  So there will be huge lines of people waiting, placing order and waiting for a table to open.  But this kinda works nicely cause you can grab drinks while you wait and by the time you get seated, the pizza will arrive and ready to eat. I've been here now twice and I will try others, but I can definitely recommend this place to other.  I try to stay away from franchise restaurant cause I like to find the most original or authentic type of cuisine.  I think this franchise has two other locations, but this one is pretty good.  I will definitely try other places to give yelp reviewers and browser a better perspective, but for now, if you've never been to Chicago or visiting through, then I recommend Lou Malnati's!

It even convinced my Texian partner that he could dress his salad with something other than Ranch.  The pizza, however, was a bit of a disappointment.  The crust is nice and buttery, better than Giordano's.  But the rest of the pizza was lacking.  It seemed as if the sauce consisted of a can of crushed tomatoes that had been opened and poured over the top with absolutely no seasonings.  The sausage was strangely stringy.  The layers of crust, cheese, toppings and tomatoes were not nearly as thick as Giordano's.  Some people don't appreciate feeling full after only two pieces of pizza, but I do.  I guess that's why I'm a Giordano's guy.",0.8621,0.839,0.108,0.053,0.5050420168067227

2013-10-24,4.0,"Best Chicago Style Pizza...so far I'm going to hold off on giving a pizza place in Chicago 5 stars until I've tried all the deep dishes in the area, but out of Gino's, Uno's (and Due), and Lou Malnati's, Lou Malnati's wins, hands down. I think the thing that stands out at Lou Malnati's is the fresh tasting tomato sauce and the crust. The crust was a perfect crispiness, and a good amount of it too (some places have too much crust and it's like eating bread with cheese). The toppings are good too...the cheese is top notch, the sausage is good too, and although they don't put an entire patty on the pizza like Gino's, sausage still covers the entire pie. Be prepared to wait 35-40 minutes for your pizza. Ordering a salad or appetizer may make this time go by faster. Tips:  You can order the pizzas online, frozen, to your house. My grandma sends me some pies every Valentine's day (they have heart-shaped!)

As filling as the pizza was, I thought the sausage was really excellent, tender and full of flavor. I also really liked how the sweet tang of the tomato sauce cut through the richness of the meat. But I did not care for the dense buttercrust, which was hard and crumbly and reminded me a little of biscotti. I was also turned off by the heavy layer of cheese in the center, which had started to coagulate as it sat and cooled in the pan. Had the pizza not been so heavy, I might have liked it more.

I have eaten deep dish pizza maybe twice in my life before and wasn't crazy about it. I like pizza, but I don't love it.  Despite all that , this was the most amazing deep dish pizza I have ever eaten. Buttery crisp crust that held up to the massive filling of fresh cheese, tomatoes and sausage. The salads ( the Malnati and the Caesar ) were very fresh and tasty, though I wish we hadn't wasted the stomach space so I could have had more pizza, I barely was able to finish one slice.

My friend and I waited for about an hour for our pizza (at 2:30 pm on a Saturday). So, while I get that this is a popular place, it just seemed odd to me that at 2:30 it took an hour to make a deep dish pizza for two (9""). Whatever, I was sitting at the bar crushing a couple of Goose Island IPAs to kill the time.  So once the pizza arrived, I rolled up my sleeves and was ready to have at it. Used a fork and knife, because everyone else was doing it, which was probably because there's a lotta sauce, cheese, etc in there.  It was A-OK. The sauce was nice and tomato-y, the cheese..well it was cheesy, and the other veggies we had in our pizza tasted just like regular, normal vegetables.

Thin pizza tasted reheated from the freezer section at the grocery store. Deep dish came cold and the sauce tasted canned and bland--watery. Yes, I tried both butter crust and regular crust--one was bland, one just tasted like butter. What's up with no veggie options other than a spinach mix (mix? No fresh options)????  Salad came with a ton of chopped, old looking tomatoes on them--I had to pick through the heap that was thrown on it.   The clincher? My husband cut his lip on a chipped beer class. It happens--it sucks, but whatever right?  We pointed it out to waitress and she promptly took it back with it being a  little over half full. She didn't bring him back a full beer!  Meaning: they had either re-poured his other beer into a new glass (um hello?) or only poured the new glass that full. I had to say something--really????? C'mon now.  Sorry, his lip is bleeding--don't insult us.

EVER. and also, SAUSAGE CRUSTED PIZZA (not on the menu, you have to ask for it)!  the atmosphere of this place is killer, feels like where Al Capone would do his business if he wanted to eat pizza while he was doing so. there's a bar by the entrance with a couple people watching baseball on TV, and further inside it's slightly dim with sports memorabilia all over the walls. It definitely has an old-school feel to it, which i absolutely loved!  we walked in on a wednesday at 4pm with a party of 3, because we heard the line and wait gets pretty bad later on. we went with a Chicago native who comes to Lou's pretty often, and says it's one of his favorite places! we got seated right away, and there were already a few parties inside enjoying their deep dish, and it looked thick and delicious!!!  the decor makes it appear much less like a family establishment than Girodano's, and more like where middle aged Chicagoans come to play poker or enjoy cigars. but there were quite a few families inside.  our waiter was extremely friendly and answered all the questions we had. we ordered a Lou's deep dish, and since my boyfriend is gluten free, they offered a standard 10'' gluten free pizza, or they revealed to us a CRUSTLESS PIZZA, where sausages ARE the crust!!! I had no idea how that would work, but we were about to find out!  pizzas come in the size of small, medium, large, and extra large. our waiter warned us that the crustless pizza is some heavy stuff, and that a medium size would be a hike, but the large would be a trek... so we went for the large!! one bite into the deep dish and i was SOLD. it was PACKED with fresh, gooey cheese and the toppings were so savory and flavorful! Also, the crust was just thick enough to still feel like a crust but have the texture of really tender bread. and one bite into the crustless pizza, my boyfriend was in HEAVEN! he ate almost the entire pizza by himself! the sausages were molded into crust form, and it was packed tight with cheese, with additional mushroom and peppers on top! it was some legitimate sausage crust, and definitely one of the most innovative pizzas I've ever had! it had about twice the flavor of the deep dish pizza, but that's probably because the sausages are super salty and there is no bread to mediate... INTENSE STUFF! you can tell all the ingredients are fresh, and the crustless pizza is perfect for those who are allergic to gluten but still want a packed mouthful of flavors! GF pizza crusts tend not to be very good... so why not get rid of it entirely!?  pizzas take a while to make as they are fresh, so if you are starving maybe some salad will hold you over... the service is wonderful and the waiters personally serve each slice to you, although we started serving ourselves because it personally feels awkward to be waited on.

I tend to think that New York Pizza is the best that United States has to offer, but i kept an open mind since i was in Chicago. It goes back to that old debate question who's pizza is better New York or Chicago. The Chicago deep dish pizza is one of the many things Chi-Town is known for and I wanted to know if it would live up to the hype. My friends ordered a whole pie which was delivered at lightning speed and was still steaming hot, so i was very impressed with that quick service. Over the course of my trip I had four different deep dish pizza's from different establishments and Lou's by far the best. Crunchy, buttery, doughy, cheesy and very tasty is the best way i can describe the regular deep dish slices that I had. Taste wise in comparison to New York slices I just don't see it beating a Grimaldi's or Forcella. But it definitely represents Chicago as the best slice, if i lived here I would only have Lou Malnati's Pizza",0.9969,0.72,0.28,0.0,0.5041458541458542
2013-09-30,4.0,Heard this is the place to go for a true Chicago deep dish. Came here on my visit to the city from Ft. Lauderdale. Had Lou Malnati salad with the crumbled Salami which was great. Not too over dressed and not oily.  Then had a small Lou Malnati's special which i found delicious. A lil on the doughy side but i love deep dish pizza. I would recommend this place but then again i'm not from Chicago and didn't have anything else to compare it too.,0.9493,0.807,0.193,0.0,0.5964285714285714
2013-09-29,3.0,"Conservative, n. - A statesman who is enamored of existing evils, as distinguished from the Liberal, who wishes to replace them with others. -- Ambrose Bierce Chicago is a town known for both a surplus of Liberals and exceptional pizza.  What's the very best deep-dish pizza in Chicago?  A question worthy of a Doctoral thesis at least!  I sifted through numerous suggestions, and this was the first of two pizzerias I tried on this trip; with a four-star average on over eleven hundred reviews AND glowing recommendations from foodie friends who know their way around Chicago; I had high hopes for Lou Malnati's.  By the end of the meal, my hopes weren't totally dashed, but I sure wasn't ready to ask Lou to build a Silicon Valley annex. We walked in on a Friday night at 5:30, and the place was packed!  We were told there'd be a 30 minute wait, but a table opened up right away just as I sat down to look at the menu.  Looking around as we were seated, I really liked the vibe and the look of this place.  yelp.com/biz_photos/lou-…   Consulting the menu and our exceptionally friendly waitress, I saw there were three crust styles available: deep-dish, thin-crust, and glueten-free ""crustless"".  My Droogies and I know what we like - we ordered two small deep-dish pizzas: The Malnati Chicago Classic (Lou's lean sausage, some extra cheese and vine-ripened tomato sauce on Buttercrust)  yelp.com/biz_photos/lou-…  and The ""Lou"" (Spinach mix, mushrooms and sliced roma tomatoes covered with three cheeses).  yelp.com/biz_photos/lou-…  The waitress warned us that the pies would take 45 to 50 minutes to cook (fairly standard duration for deep-dish), so we got an appetizer to tide us over - pizza chips with three housemade dips - roasted garlic, artichoke and giardiniera-topped hummus.  yelp.com/biz_photos/lou-…  This dish was a classic example of the whole being much greater than the sum of the parts.  The chips didn't taste all that appetizing when eaten plain, but paired wonderfully with any one of the three dips for a very delightfully flavorful experience. It was the kind of muggy, hot, humid, Eastern U.S. type of summer day that makes me glad I'm now a Californian - I got a Blue Moon to pair with my pizza.  yelp.com/biz_photos/lou-…  If vintage Cabernet is unavailable, Belgian beers go with pizza better than Bill Clinton goes after Interns... With our appetizer long gone and my Blue Moon a growing temptation, our pizzas finally arrived!  yelp.com/biz_photos/lou-…  I took my first bite, and I hate to say it, but the gestalt taste was VERY disappointing, the toppings were good quality, but the sauce was decidedly lacked personality.  The crust wasn't anywhere near crispy enough; in fact, it bordered on soggy!  The cheese didn't melt like I'm used to and there wasn't much sauce on the pizza.  I was NOT a happy camper. Frankly, I've had much better Chicago-style pizza in California.  I'll give Lou's three stars for the service and the atmosphere, but don't think I'll be rushing back for another one of their pizzas any time soon.",0.9939,0.839,0.127,0.034,0.5415355417529331

2013-09-01,4.0,"About 3 or 4 years ago, my Aunt sent me frozen pizza as a gift.  She is from Chicago and sent me a Lou Malnati's frozen pie.  Not being from Chicago, I'd never heard of Lou Malnati's before.  I made the pizza for dinner one night and could not believe how good it was.  I was shocked - if it's this good frozen, how good can it be fresh?  Then, I saw Malnati's on Food Wars and they won best deep dish in Chicago.  I knew I had to get to this place. My wife and I went here for dinner on our most recent Chicago visit.  We walked in and were told that it would be about 30 minutes for a table.  That's fine - we weren't in a rush so we grabbed a couple of stools at the bar.  4 minutes later, the hostess was yelling my wife's name.  So, we ended up not even waiting 5 minutes for a table when we were told it would be a half hour.  We were seated upstairs - the restaurant itself is not huge.  The bar is also tiny and they probably only had about 6 beers or less on tap.   The menu is pretty straightforward.  We were a party of 4 so we decided to start out with a salad and ordered 2 deep dish pies.  I think we got 2 large pies - let me tell you - that was way too much food.  My wife and I only had four of the eight slices.  I think we were a little off because we are from the NY/NJ area and the pizza is much different.   We started out with the Malnati salad.  It was actually very good.  The blue cheese and dressing was great.  I would easily recommend this salad as a start to the meal.  I don't see how you can go wrong. Like I said, for our meals, we went with the deep dish pies.  Honestly, how can you not?  They should throw you out of the restaurant if it's your first time there and you don't order deep dish pizza.  My wife and I went with the Malnati Chicago classic.  It's stuffed with sausage but also comes with their buttercrust.  Trust me - the buttercrust makes a difference.  I had pizza at another famous joint that didn't serve buttercrust and the Malnati pie was much better than the competitor.  We also added peppers, mushrooms and onions to our pizza so it was basically like a supreme pie.   The pizza itself was very good.  From what we are told, it's classic Chicago.  I enjoyed the pizza a lot and I'm sure I'll find myself craving it when I'm back in NJ.  Heck, I can always have it shipped back to my house.  This pizza is much different than NJ pizza as you have to eat it with a fork and a knife.  It's almost like a much messier sicilian, because the sauce is on top, whereas with the sicilian the cheese is on top.  The cheese almost glues everything together, in a way. Overall, I think Malnati's is great.  I'm just super glad that I finally got out here to try the deep dish pizza.  Service was very good throughout the meal - just a major mix up on wait time.  I'd definitely head back here.",0.995,0.833,0.13,0.036,0.5211153628117914

Not giving up, we continued our search and realized that Lou Malnati's was opened till 11. It was already 10:15pm, and we were pretty far so I called to placed an order for take out (it takes 30 mins to make) and then we ran through Chicago getting lost multiple times before we finally made it at 11:15pm.

2013-08-25,3.0,"So we finally land in Chicago, and what's the first thing we did? Check out the much raved about deep dish pizza, of course! Aside from being fatty's, we also made it a priority to check it out because we watched an Anthony Bourdain episode where he was in Chicago and described deep dish pizza as a pizza/pot pie... What??? Pizza pot pie? Sounds.. different! Since the place he went to was too far from where we were staying, we strolled over to Lou Malnati's pizzeria...  Lou Malnati's reminds me of the Bennigan's chain that existed in Miami once upon a time. It has that family style vibe and old Italian pizzeria décor to it. It was pretty full inside, so we decided to sit outside and enjoy the delicious weather as well. The hostess promptly seated us and our server came. She wasn't very informed on the beer selection, however her recommendation ended up being what I was craving. We started off with some garlic bread and salad appetizers. The salad was good, not GREAT... Just, good. It would've been great if she would've let us know about the bleu cheese so this is just another example of how uninformed our waitress was of the menu. We also had some garlic bread which was warm and toasty, not over indulged in butter and garlic. After a 45 minute wait, finally the deep dish pizza arrives. We ordered the sausage one and decided to go with the small portion which my friends, was enough! It's cut into 4 and even with an appetite I was only able to finish one slice. Lou Malnati's deep dish pizza is reminiscent of the pizza hut and I say this because of the similarity of the crust, which also happened to be really thin. Deep dish pizza is literally the recipe for heartburn! At least this one was. Luckily I happen to like lots of tomato sauce but this was out of control. It was like a tomato sauce pie with some cheese on top. Did I expect something better? Kind of, but after hearing that locals don't usually eat deep dish I also kept my expectations at a realistic level.  I came to Lou Malnati's because of the great reviews.

2013-08-23,4.0,"Ladies and gents, please bring your stomachs.  No snacking prior to your visit at Lou Malnati's!  I've had Giordano's, Gino's East, Lou Malnati's, Uno's, and Pequod's.  I think you could say I've had a lot of deep dish since I moved to Chicago.  Out of all the places I've tried, I really prefer Lou Malnati's crust.  It's crunchy, yet chewy.        When my party of six strolled in at 8 PM on a Thursday, we were quoted a wait of one hour.  The server took our phone number in order to reach us, then we decided to hit up Bull & Bear next door for a few drinks to kill the time.  BUT DON'T LEAVE YET!  If you're ordering a whole deep dish (which I recommend you do), then you should place your order now. The pizzas alone take +/-45 minutes (depends on how busy the place is), so it's best to put your deep dish order in while you are waiting to be seated.  If you're ordering other things (salad, pasta, or pretty much anything other than pizza) then you will order once you're seated.  Our plan worked out flawlessly at Bull & Bear because we got seated outside without waiting and could easily pay and leave from the patio.   Alas, we got ""the call"". At Lou's, we ordered a Malnati salad, calamari, the ""classic"" deep dish, and the ""Lou"" deep dish (vegetarian).  Both pizzas are medium-size.   The food truths: -Malnati salad:  To be honest, I was surprised at the tastiness of the salad because I feel that a lot of restaurants only serve salads as a requisite. The salad is tossed with sweet vinaigrette dressing, gorgonzola, salami, olives, tomatoes, mushrooms and romano cheese.  I'd definitely order it again without any changes.  The menu says it serves 3-4 people, but our table of six all had enough salad.   -Calamari:  I'm a calamari freak.  I don't know why, but I almost always tend to order calamari at pizzerias.  The calamari wasn't the best, but I would order it again because I lurve (love) calamari and the marinara sauce was delicious and fresh. -The ""Lou"" (vegetarian) deep dish:  let me just say this... No one at the table was vegetarian, but everyone liked it.  My manfriend even preferred it over the sausage-laden ""Classic"" deep dish that we also ordered.  This pizza was a happy marriage of delectable mushrooms, spinach, cheese, tomater sauce, and thinly-sliced tomatoes on top.  I'm not big on tomaters so I did begin sliding them off of my pizza. Sorry I'm not sorry. -The ""Classic"":  oh, hellllllo you sausage-y goodness, you.  This Classic was jacked up on lean sausage, tomater sauce, and lots o'  cheese.  This pizza was perfect.  Probably due to the leanness of the sausage, the sausage actually had a good bite to it. Still perfect and I'd order this baby up again! The service was perfect and I never had to play Where's Waldo to locate my waiter since he was very on top of things, especially considering how jam-packed this place was on a Thursday night.  Water was filled at all times and he did a nice job of serving us the pizzas once they came out.   One thing they really can improve on is having a bigger bathroom.  C'mon! One stall for the women's bathroom?!  Other than my bathroom gripe, everything else was just peachy! Hostess was also very kind.  Now, go treat yourself.",0.9976,0.801,0.16,0.039,0.5455357142857143

2013-08-13,4.0,"Caveat...I grew up in New York City in an Italian neighborhood, ate thin crust pizza as a child and that was all I knew.  Now I am older and wiser and have tried some generic deep dish pizzas, nothing to rank me as an expert, and I wasn't too impressed.  I like to think of myself as having a very adventurous palate and I will try ANYTHING edible once, I am a foodie and I know what I like.  My wife and I are on a quick vacation to Chicago, staying in a hotel in the loop and we wanted to give Chicago Deep Dish a fair taste.  We ate at Gino's East on Saturday (see my newly posted review on Ginos)  afternoon and while the pizza sauce was good and the pizza was good, the crust was a disaster, and the experience was touristy.... SOOOOOOO, here I am thinking that maybe I just don't care for deep dish pizza all that much.  I don't hate it but nothing to write home about. We continue on our touristy ways, standing on The Ledge at the Willis Tower and after coming down to earth from those heights, we made a route correction on the way back to our hotel to stop at Lou Malnati's.  Neither of us cared for Gino's crust and thought that if that was great deep dish crust, then we aren't deep dish people.   To be fair we wanted to give Deep Dish Pizza another shot, not to mention that I LOVE PIZZA and didn't want to find that there was a whole gender of pizza that I would find that I would not like....so I convinced my wife that this would be better than our pizza on Saturday.   We got to Malnati's early, lunch time on a Monday.  Got seated at the outside sidewalk tables right away.  We didn't even go inside so don't have any comments on anything other than they have a red awning over the front door that is up 3 or 4 steps from ths sidewalk.   Our waitress was right there and we ordered a soft drink and a medium Malnati Chicago Classic, a medium sized pizza with sausage, double cheese ""vine-ripened tomatoes on a Buttercrust"".  Our waitress was helpful, and efficient and stayed on top of our beverages.  I was having diet-coke and she kept my glass filled up for the 40 or so minutes that it took for our pie to cook.  Our pizza came out hot and sliced, we had 6 slices in a medium pie and the crust was golden brown, a saucey covered bed of cheese and sausage that DELIVERED!!  The sauce was plentiful and flavorful, it was nicely seasoned with basil and thyme evident in the taste, nicely seasoned.  There was plenty of sausage amply spread throughout our pizza, the cheese was waiting under the whole mess to surprise your palate and stretch with every bite! Then there was the crust...well it was buttery, crispy and not hard like our Saturday experience.  It all combined for a crispy, buttery wrapping around a cheesy saucey, bite of sausagey goodness.  We were full after the waitress served us both another slice and then she wrapped our pizza in aluminum foil so we could take it back on the plane with us to spread the good word on Lou Malnati's pizza.  Now I don't know if all the crusts are the ""Buttercrust"" because I didn't see any other pizzas on the menu with this description, but this ""buttercrust"" was great, crisp, buttery, great tasting and flavorful. While I am still a NY style pizza guy...thin, crisp crust, flash cooked, in a super hot oven, I am open to trying another great Deep Dish Pizza. I feel like being a New Yorker and liking Malnatis Deep Dish Pizza is almost like rooting for the Red Sox. NOT!!   The price was right, out the door with 2 slices to take with us for about $25.00 with sodas.",0.997,0.831,0.129,0.039,0.47931773088023105

I walked by at 7 on a night of the Stanley Cup and it was a zoo outside. I went early one night around 5 though and avoided the crowds. I got the small deep dish with extra cheese and mushrooms. I love the cast iron pan it comes in at the table. So how was it? I'm a New Yorker, therefore we don't get deep dish unless you go to a Pizzeria Uno chain in New Jersey. So i was looking forward to the authentic real thing. The pizza was tasty, definitely cheeeeeeesy and had a really nice savory tomato sauce with just the right amount of sweetness but there are two critiques I have. 1. I wish the crust was able to hold the toppings a little better. I felt the crust may have been a little under baked, because some pieces the cheese just slid off. 2. I wanted more mushrooms. Some slices didn't have more than a couple of mushrooms. Overall though, I enjoyed it. It's not New York pizza but I mean c'mon. In an out in 45 minutes to go to my next eating exploration.

We parked in a metered spot near the Humane Society which is around the corner. We finished our dinner and had a very unwelcome surprise when we discovered that our car had been towed away because the metered spots become tow-away zones during rush hour. To add insult to injury, the phone numbers on the parking meters were non helpful in helping us to locate our car. I was able to get the information that I needed from a nearby business. They handed me a paper with a map to the impound lot and they told me that this happens all the time! It cost us $160 impound fee+$60 parking ticket to get our car on the road again.

2013-06-20,1.0,"After visiting this location two nights in a row on vacation, because it was so awesome, I decided to come a third time, almost two years later. I'm really sad to report that it was not at all the same experience whatsoever. In fact, I would say this was the worst service I've ever experienced anywhere. This time, the wait staff seemed to be overwhelmed by the crowd and were doing a tag team operation and ""helping"" each other. After waiting over 30 minutes for my deep dish pizza, the minimum wait time for a standard deep dish, a waiter who was not our server delivered our pizza to another table. There was a pretty clear language barrier, which did not help the situation. Since Lou's personally serves each guest their first slice, they doled out my pizza to another family, who immediately started devouring it. The other family's pizza came out to us, of course, which we immediately alerted the server of. It was offered to us, but it looked disgusting and had extra cheese, which is just not necessary on a deep dish pie. Not surprisingly, based on the service that night, this server who brought our pizza was not the server who took our order. Had it been our original waitress, this whole situation could have easily been avoided. Once we called our original waitress over, she was very flustered at the situation and brought over her manager.  Now, if you were the manager, who would you address first? The people who are already eating a pizza, of which they clearly could not recognize or care was their own OR the people who are sitting pizzaless, hungry, and annoyed at the situation? This manager opted for the first. Absolutely ridiculous. Said manager seemed confused as to what to do, and gave more attention to the the table who now had 2 total pizzas, versus my table with none. She went over to the family who received my pizza and apologized to them, even though it was clear that they were stuffing their faces anyways, and did not care. Her first interaction with my table was asking us, ""Did you guys eat any of this one?"" in regards to the pizza we incorrectly received. It was visible that we hadn't, and told her we hadn't, to which she replied, ""Cool!"" and then proceeded to give that family the pizza they originally ordered, in addition to ours. How rude! She then disappeared into the kitchen for several minutes. When she finally reemerged, she wondered out to tell us that they were making our pizza a top priority and jumping it in the line of orders. She didn't once apologize to us, and she acted annoyed at us, even though it wasn't our fault. Maybe she expected us to just accept the pizza we didn't order? Whatever the reason, the customer should come first, and this was not the priority of this manager. I was visiting from out of town and then had to wait a whole additional 30 minutes. This really took a chunk out of my night that was set out for exploring the city. I was not at all pleased about this. We ate quickly once we finally got the pizza we ordered to begin with. Our original server was very nice and extremely apologetic throughout, while her manager remained apathetic about the whole situation. Ready for the kicker? We were finishing our last slices of pizza and our waitress came over and dropped off a check. Are you even kidding me? They had actually billed us for two pizzas, and zeroed both off of the check, giving the illusion that we had saved $30 or something.  Since we were aware of the wait time, I ordered a beer and a fried calamari appetizer before the meal. I didn't really want either, but some time had passed since lunch, and I wanted to get started on something. It ended up that this is what we were being charged for, including my girlfriend's drink, which came to a total of an additional $25 or so. I couldn't believe they had the nerve to charge us for anything! We were in their restaurant a total of over TWO WHOLE HOURS! How could they have the nerve to try to charge us for anything.  The waitress came back around again and I asked her to speak with the manager again, to which she responded, ""Oh, is there something wrong with the check?"" to which I replied, ""Yes. The fact that there is one."" She looked confused and ran off to grab the same unhelpful manager from earlier, who also appeared confused as to what additional problems there could be. Was it really that surprising? Really?!?!? I told her that it was ridiculous that we had to wait that long, that we were from out of town and our night was ruined, that it was insane to charge us for anything, etc. This dismissive jerk of a manager walked away from our table, while I was expressing our displeasures, which was even more infuriating. This, of course, caused a small scene, to which I walked straight out. I couldn't believe the service I had just received. It was by far the absolute worse service I have ever experienced from any public restaurant, grocery store, retail store, or anywhere ever, really.

I think I am just not a fan of deep dish cause I finally got around to trying Malnatti's classic and was unimpressed. This was a delivery order so maybe it is better served on site. The tomato sauce was barely ok, the sausage patty was the worst bit, and the butter crush was good but didn't rewarm well. Coming from a sauce/sausage/butter fan, this is abysmal. Where did it all go wrong? I RECOMMEND- The cookie pizza dessert. IT IS SUBLIME. Decadent, warm cookie dough pie with melted ice cream. No brainer, even in delivery (they took the pains to package the ce cream separately. kudos).  EXTRA TIP- I had quite the bout of indigestion after this meal.

2013-04-05,1.0,They probably make the best deep dish pizza in Chicago problem is I'm not a big fan of deep dish pizza. The pizza I ordered was the Malnati Chicago Classic which essentially is a thick layer of some type of meat over a soggy base with a thick layer of tomato sauce and sprinkles of some type of melted cheese. This pizza was so boring I will never recover and or eat deep dish pizza again. The trio of dips and pizza chips and Chicken BBQ club salad were equally as boring and unsurprisingly absurdly massive in proportion. The atmosphere is equally as boring and I resent that the only thing they played on their old school televisions was the fishing channel. I mean c'mon you have a bunch of signed jerseys in glass cabinets on display how hard is it?,-0.7984,0.841,0.045,0.114,0.6164351851851851
2013-04-04,5.0,"I haven't had a better deep dish pizza...anywhere. The portions are large and 1-2 slices does get you full...if you're a normal person. Me? The fatty I am ate half the pizza. Okay anyway, the cheese goes on top, toppings (we got the sausage deep dish) in the inside, and you got the crust on the bottom. The cheese is great because it wasn't too stringy and it wasn't as heavy and oily as it could be. The sausage was the best part. They were not cheap with their sausage. Every bite I took had some sausage in it and it was great. The crust was flaky and buttery, that won't scratch the roof of your mouth! We also got a thin crust pizza and this was also....almost... as good as the deep dish. Its tomatoes and spinach were cooked to perfection and the perfect amount of cheese was on the pizza. I'd definitely recommend this if you don't want something too heavy in a deep dish.  I wish I was able to take one of their frozen pizzas home with me back to Ann Arbor, but unfortunately that might have to wait til next time I'm back! Also worth noting: somehow we escaped with paying only about $8 per person. What a great dinner for a great rate!

2013-04-04,4.0,"After visiting ""The Bean"" in Millenium Park we worked up an appetite for some Chicago style pizza.  We thought what better then Lou Malnati's Pizzeria.  Lou's boasts over a 1000 reviews as I add mine, with a solid 4 out of 5 stars.  We arrived about 15 minutes early grabbing a rare parking spot right in front of the iconic red awning.  The staff couldn't have started out any better with this foodie then they did, opening the doors 15 minutes early on a cool spring day on the streets of Chicago.  The staff was super friendly and seemed surprised when I told them I was ready to order before even glancing at the menu.  We started with an order of the Calamari Fritta.  Well seasoned, perfectly fried squid served with extra lemons & a tangy red sauce.  We didn't have to wait as long as you might for some other Chicago style pizzas, because the server was dishing up some pie before you knew it.   The pizza was absolutely amazing.  A thick , buttery crusted pie oozing with cheese ( I mean oozing, the cheese stretched as far as my son could stretch his little 8 year old arms).  But what really made the pie was the layer of their house made sausage.  The sausage was a combination of pork and beef, made in house and was the highlight of this visit if you ask me.  The sauce was very simple, crushed tomatoes with a pinch of salt & sugar.  We really enjoyed our visit & I would have to plan a return visit on road trip passing through Chicago for sure.  We had some pizza left over and I don't think it made it half way to St. Louis.  It smelled the car up something good, and if you would have been in the car you would have seen a little drool drip down the corner of my lip when the carry out container was cracked open.  I have eaten at several Chicago Pizzeria's & I would have to say Lou's is high up on my list.  A must try if in Chicago!!",0.9893,0.87,0.121,0.009,0.4422152777777776

Just to warm you up: From the moment I was home in Connecticut until the point I entered this place, I tossed and turned in bed every night thinking of the Chicago Deep Dish pizza. I never had it before (or at least not in my adult conscious life). 2.) What your eyes may see: Clean. A lot of wood grain, frames, sports jerseys and icons hung around. There is a 2nd floor. 3.) Food: I ordered the Malnati's Chicago Classkc which had sausage, extra cheese and sun ripped tomatoes.. I thought the taste was great, but not happy with the lack of depth it had. It wasn't really deep, I believe a New York Sicilian pizza was deeper. Nevertheless the crust was buttery and crispy and no burnt edges like other places I've seen on Yelp. I ordered the tiramisu. It was a little watery but tasted pretty good. 4.) Service: Clean, sleek, bartender was cool, they say us in 20 minutes even though they said 30 minutes. The staff were very nice. We sat on the first floor. The bartender was very cool and helpful with drinks. When we were seated our waitress was fine, nothing spectacular about the refills and such. 5.) Impressions: I was looking forward to a ""deep dish."" I believe the New York Sicilian slice was deep than this one. It didnt compare to what I saw on the food network specials on deep dish places in Chicago. Definitely didnt match my expectations of this place.

We had a tall young blond man (I thought his name was ""Rick,"" but the receipt says Jarrad) who was spot on, and the host staff was friendly and obviously well-trained too.   I'm a former server myself, was once the #2 waiter at a high-volume upscale restaurant that closed awhile back, so I know what makes for great service.  Below are my own criteria for great service.  In my experience today at Lou Malnati's, they *nailed* every point. 1. Greet my party at the door - if there isn't a line, don't make us wait more than one minute without being greeted  2. A server should greet our table within 3 minutes of being seated, ask for a drink order and tell us the specials of the day 4. Servers must have a thorough knowledge of every item on the menu, especially for customers with common dietary restrictions (vegan, nut allergies, etc.) 5. If our food is taking longer than normal, at least check in with the guests.  An explanation might not be needed - just don't ignore us.  Communication goes a LONG way in preventing unhappy guests! 5. Servers MUST do at least a visual check (make direct eye contact, if not verbal contact) within 3 minutes of our entrees being served.  This is the 3 most important minutes of the entire meal!  If my food is over/undercooked, not as I requested, if I need more salad dressing, or want another glass of wine WITH my meal, etc. - NOW is the time for those requests to be handled ASAP.  MOST restaurants in Chicago fail at this basic point of service 6. A great server will notice if I am getting low on iced tea/coffee/water, etc., and keeps it refilled without me having to flag them down 7. A great sever will be able to ""read"" his customers, and know if they want to be entertained, or left alone and interrupted as infrequently as possible.  A visual check - the server makes their presence known in case the customer needs anything, but does not interrupt - can be highly effective. 8.

I ordered the Malnati Chicago Classic.  Overall it was the perfect balance of tomato and cheese.  Some of the other places are too heavy handed on one or the other.   The tomato sauce on the pizza was fresh.  Larger chunks of tomato and last processed tasting.  The cheese wasn't overwhelming the pizza, but was enough to make you savor twirling your folk to get those last strands of melted cheese from the bottom of the plate.

I had ordered Giordano's originally and it was solid do not get me wrong but there is nothing like a Lou Malnati's deep dish pizza.  I was actually very fortunate because a co worker was very familiar with the pizza in the city as he had been here a few times and after he had heard my experience with Giordano's he told me that I had to try Lou Malnati's or I would not be getting the right deep dish pizza experience. So that night I order a pepperoni, sausage, and cheese deep dish pizza. Wow. That is all I can say and even that does not justice to this pizza. This pizza has awesome crust, the toppings are super fresh, and oh man the cheese is outta control. One bite of this gooey cheese is enough to make me start drooling. The sausage is awesome because as opposed to bits of it, it's essentially a sheet allowing you to have the perfect proportion of sausage, pepperoni, cheese, and fresh tomato in each single bite that you take.

My coworker and I stopped in for Chicago-style pizza because we were in town for work.  We found this place through Yelp! We were really looking forward to good Chicago deep dish pizza.  The only place I'd been to in the past that had a great crust was Uno's (another Chicago chain). We decided to sit at the bar since the wait for a table was quite long, and a couple stools opened up at the bar.   We ordered: Small pan classic Chicago ($12.70) - The pizza was okay... the crust had a bit of cornmeal which I don't really like.  The crust was definitely more bread-y than pastry. We both agreed that we didn't really like it, but there are many who do like this crust. I would have preferred a thinner crust.  Medium Malnati Salad ($7.75) - My coworker ordered this as a starting course, and we shared it. It was huge!  The salad was quite good, but how could you screw up salad.  Along with 2 sodas ($2.25 each), our subtotal came to $24.95 + 2.20 tax + 4.88 tip = $32.00 total for the two of us.

The slices looks small but are mighty! Went with my husband and the small was plenty for both of us due to the richness of the toppings and the hearty crust!

Super cheesy and super topped with tomato sauce, but full of flavor and really hit the spot after a whole day of walking around Chicago and being a tourist. Super filling though and slightly hard to cut. This is the one pizza that requires utensils to eat.",0.9387,0.875,0.106,0.019,0.48578431372549025

Service was friendly, but slow.  I attribute that to the full-house, but still, you think they'd be able to compensate by hiring more people if that's a persistent problem.

I was in Chicago attending an internet marketing conference and just so happened that not only had I already eaten pizza from Giordano's nearby the hotel, but I go a second helping (oh goodness!) but with much better company haha. I remember it like it was... a couple of months ago, although its already been a year haha. There's this large tall fluorescent sign outside that says, ""Lou Malnati's"" - you couldn't miss it. We walked in and waited for the rest of our 10 person group to arrive. Inside I felt a sense of nostalgia even though I'd never been there before; but I felt the history speaking through the brick walls and cliche nicely framed photos all over the walls.  The waiting area was a bit cramped; mind you, there were about 10 more people waiting to be seated too. It was packed. I thought we'd have to wait at least an hour before we got a seat, but after about 20 minutes, they brought us in and started walking up the stairs - THERE'S A SECOND FLOOR?! oh yeah.  We got seated on this super long table... wait, there was 12 of us. not 10. It could have been 13 but who's counting? All I know was we were at this pizzaria that people definitely knew about and I'd only heard great things about it. We ordered 5 pizzas. First they came back with 2 different kinds of salads in huge bowls you'd expect to see from the Olive Garden here in Canada; but without the huge translucent salad tongs. People ordered wine; we all shared - I don't remember the bottles but they were decent to say the least :) Good gracious! eating one of my most favourite food, sitting with ONLY internet marketing people, sipping wine and having a great time! Could a guy ask for anything more? Oh wait, the pizza! It arrived... Meatlovers, Vegetarian and a classic Pepperoni. I gotta tell you guys, here in Canada we are ripped off. Any meat pizza I had in Chicago with sausage in it tasted like they just made it the same day and they definitely don't skimp out on it. Everything down to the sauce and the dough had me wishing I had longer to stay just so I could eat here again. I've only eaten at 2 pizzaria's in Chicago. Lou... you won.

We ordered two pizza pies to share: 1) The ""Lou"" - we had a vegetarian among us, so the ingredients in it were suitable for the veggie lover: spinach, mushrooms, and roma tomatoes. 2) The ""Manalti Chicago Classic"" - comprised of sausage, cheese, tomato sauce on a buttercrust.  Super fattening! My eagerness to try these famed pizzas diminished with every minute I waited for the pizzas to come out of the oven; they took almost 40 minutes!  I recommend that you do not come here while you are famished.  Or, be smart and order an appetizer to tide you over to the main course. I think the ""Lou"" was the better of the two in terms of taste.  Whereas the Manalti Chicago Classic was salty due to the sausage, cheese and buttercrust, the salt in the ""Lou"" was absorbed by the vegetables.

I needed something to change my mind. I had always thought I knew what a true deep dish was, but boy was I wrong! Lou Malnati's encompassed the essence of the Windy City. Not only was their pizza tasty, but the gangster/team posters made it feel like you were in a true Chi-town family restaurant. I was prepared for an hour wait (at least!) so when I arrived and saw a small waiting area I was pretty surprised. The wait staff was definitely on their game and even took our order ahead of time, assuring it would get to our table once we were seated. After waiting about 15 minutes, we were seated and I decided to relax with a nice cold 312 brew. After about 40 minutes of great conversation and ooh'ing/ahh'ing over the pizzas at the table next to us, we were served. I went with the Lou donne with their homemade sauce, spinach, tomato, mushroom and four cheeses. My bf ordered a sausage, mushroom and green pepper pizza that also looked amazing.

2012-10-04,2.0,"I thought the pizza was OK-- not as amazing as it was billed to me, but decent. Not sure if it was worth the wait. However, what ticks me off is that the bartender offered a lunch express pizza, but made it sound like the only difference between a la carte and the express is that I am limited to a sausage pizza (as opposed to the classic whatever one) and it's pre-cooked. No mention of price or the salad and drink that is included in the deal. (And why he didn't think of suggesting the deal in the first place when I ordered a small salad is totally beyond me. Many waiters have been nice enough to point out to me that there's a similar option/deal that's cheaper to save me a few bucks.)  My bill came out to $17 w/tip, which is a lot in my opinion for a personal pizza and a (small) salad that was way too big for me -- no drink because I got water. (I wanted one of those tiny salads I saw around, but I guess that was the one included in the lunch deal. Go figure.)  The waiter was nice enough, but I feel a bit fleeced. Why isn't the lunch deal more prominently advertised? Why isn't that the first thing I hear when I sit at the bar? I try to stay off the beaten path to avoid tourist traps, but Lou Malnati's got me on this one. I've finally accepted the fact that deep dish is not my favorite kinda pie and my heart lies with Santarpio's crispy and doughy crust in Boston. But even if I have to go for deep dish, I'd rate Giordano's over Malnati's. Especially after this experience.",0.2153,0.846,0.075,0.078,0.5542498719918075

2012-09-26,5.0,"Lou's is my favorite Chicago deep dish. I like Gino's a lot, too, and it is indeed more like a pie, but the crust at Lou's is unbeatable. Buttery, just a bit crispy, but not dead and thick and chewy like Giordano's. This is the kind of pizza where you actually want to eat the crust--it's not just some handle for you to work with (not that I would ever pick up deep dish with my hands). And the sauce is so well-balanced and well-seasoned and the cheese is so good. As far as toppings go, their sausage is amazing, so I nearly always get the Chicago Classic. I've had the Lou before as well, and each time I've had it I've only thought that I was wasting stomach space that could be filled by the Chicago Classic. I understand the need for a good vegetarian option, and it is good, but the sausage is unearthly in its deliciousness. Pizza aside, the spinach bread is pretty good (it actually just tastes like a pizza though) and the house salad is a good appetizer to have while you're waiting 40 minutes for your pie to bake, but if you're patient you should just get pizza.

But since Lou Malnati's is supposed to be best in this city, I decided to maintain an open mind and give it a shot.  The bf and I split the small 9 inch Chicago Classic (with tomatoes, cheese, meatball sausage on their famous Buttercrust) and added sauteed fresh garlic to the mix. After 35 whole minutes, as the waitress had warned, our pizza arrived hot in its own cast iron deep-dish pan. I have to say that I did enjoy the overall flavor of the pie, especially the sauce and sauteed garlic. The buttercrust was good too, if not a little greasy; I was grateful that the deep-dish here isn't actually too ""deep"" - not too heavy on the crust to filling ratio. What I didn't enjoy so much however, was the way that Lou Malnati's layers the different components of their pizzas. The cheese is layered in slices under the sauce, and the sausage was layered similarly, evenly across the bottom of the pan. The construction not only made each bite kind of boring after two bites, but the cheese also got quite gloopy and chewy as the pie got cold. Overall the pizza was just a total gut-bomb, not something I would want to have more than once.

We were in Chicago just for a day, so we walked from Navy Pier to this shop. Not a bad walk, and were seated right away, which for lunch time on a Saturday, I was pleased.  Our server was fantastic. I cant remember his name, but was chatty, informative, and checked on us quite a few times. Kept our glasses filled, and asked questions as he told us about the menu.  I think our problem was that my guest and I really wanted different pizzas, and thus, we settled on lunch sized individual 6"" pizzas. He chose the pepperoni, and I got the Lou - a white pizza with a garlic/spinach blend and mushrooms. We also started with the appetizer sampler. The sampler was a large platter of fried stuff... zucchini, mushroom, mozzarella cheese sticks, and cheddar cheese balls. The flavor was good, but it was just way too fried. Served with marinara and ranch, I found myself picking of even more of the fried coating than I usually do. I wish I would have ordered a bruschetta or garlic bread app instead. Maybe next time. I did not try the pepperoni pizza, so I will comment just on mine, the Lou. It had a good taste and mouth feel, and I liked the spinach/garlic/cheese blend. What I didnt love though, was that it did not remind of me of real deep dish pizza. And I know that Lou Malnati's is not necessarily known for the deepest dish, but I was disappointed in the deepness of the individual pizza. We saw several smalls and mediums come out that looked much deeper. To be fair, the server did recommend a small instead of the 2 individuals. He said you get the same amount of pizza, and its cheaper, but since we had such different topping interests, we settled for individuals. I'd like to come back again, and order more appropriately. I know the thin crust gets good marks too, so perhaps one of those is in order.  So I guess for me, this review is somewhat of an Incomplete.

It was tasty, but a bit much. The toppings were delish too. It was a good pizza, but I didn't fall in love. Very good, though. As for the whole restaurant experience, it was rough. Long lines: over an hour wait. And it didn't have a convenient bar (yes, there's a bar; it was packed three deep with Sox fans). We pre-ordered, which seemed like it was a good idea. We finally got our table in a very crowded, difficult-to-walk-through, hard-to-hear-yourself-think basement. It only took four requests to get a glass of water. And the wine list was mediocre.

Finally our deep dish arrived.  We ordered the small personal pizzas, however next time we would simply order a small or medium pizza.  After having the larger deep dish a couple of nights later, it does taste different than the personal pizza size for some odd reason.  Not sure why, but we found this to be the case.  We ordered the Malnati Chicago classic and the cheese deep dish.  Both were awesome.  A couple of things that I noticed about the Malnati Chicago Classic, which was my favorite!  They make the pizza on their famous buttercrust...its fantastic.  The sauce that they use on their pizzas is awesome as well.  Not too sweat, and they don't flood the pizza with sauce.  This has always been one of my complaints with many other pizza places.  They actually put on the toppings before the sauce, so the crust stays nice and crispy.  The sausage had a mild seasoning on it, but just enough to add good flavor to the pizza, however its not overpowering.   We ran into an issue with the cookie pizza we ordered after dinner, and we had to wait over 30 minutes, but they finally brought it out to us, comped us for it, and apologized profusely.  It was such a minor mistake, that things like this happen.  The staff was super friendly here, and I would visit this particular location in the future again!  If you haven't had Lou Malnati's pizza...you have to try them.  Its amazing.",0.9966,0.829,0.154,0.017,0.5158898508898508

I went on a Thursday evening just ahead of the crowd, and it did get crowded.  First, the side salad I ordered was huge.  It was a meal unto itself.  I really had to work to finish it before the pizza came.  All the greens were very fresh and crisp and the ranch dressing was good.  The only complaint, if you can call it that, was that the salad was so big it barely fit on the plate.  In fact, I couldn't take a bite without salad falling all over the table.  But on to more important things.... I ordered the Chicago Classic pizza which included the famous butter crust and sausage, to this I added pepperoni.  What I noticed on the menu was that you can order extra tomato sauce on the pizza.  Never having seen 'extra tomato sauce' as an option I didn't order it.  It was a mistake.  I think the pizza really lacked that great tomato flavor.  The crust, mild sausage, and mountain of cheese made the pizza everything I expected.  It would have been perfect with more sauce.   The service was excellent as my water glass never went dry (which for me is a big deal) and they always cleared the table quickly. in three weeks I go back to Chicago again!  So, will it be Ginos East or Lou Malnati's next time?  Good question, I'm not sure myself.  But, I'm leaning towards going back to Lou's but this time ordering the extra tomato sauce.",0.9903,0.827,0.146,0.027,0.4573015873015873

Yelpers and friends reported that Giodano's smallest size could feed 3-4 people and then some.... As my boyfriend and I walked in, we weren't too impressed by the ambiance so we decided to get a personal sized ""Lou"" to go. We took our pizza back to our hotel, a 5 minute walk away. Super excited, I tore apart the box and I stared in disbelief at the sad looking pizza in front of me. The Lou contains ""fresh spinach, mushrooms and sliced tomatoes covered with a blend of mozzarella, romano and cheddar cheese."" For one, the tomatoes were sad and limp and lacked the beautiful hue of fresh, ripe tomatoes. The mushrooms were both few in number and undercooked. I wouldn't have even known that the pie was supposed to contain spinach if I didn't double check the menu. The buttermilk crust tasted like stale bread. With just one bite, all the cheese would fall off the slice. A huge disappointment....",0.9223,0.839,0.118,0.043,0.528888888888889

Also don't exercise at any point after you eat it. I made the mistake of running a couple hours after and had to stop after cramping up.

The deep dish pizza was good.  We were digesting a few bites of it when someone in our group stated that the cornmeal dough was raw and uncooked in the middle.  We all immediately dropped our forks and knifes down. The manager offered to replace it.  We agreed.  We continued with our thin crust pizza.  I liked it but didn't love it. Our replacement deep dish came, but I was somewhat full by this point.  So I ate most of the sausage on it and a little of the cheese and cornmeal crust.  But it was baked perfectly this time.  The sausage was more like sausage patties than crumbled nuggets of meat.

With a group of friends and my girlfriend, we finally decided on Lou Malnati's as our first Chicago pizza experience. Never have I done my due diligence on Yelp, but this time, I read review after review and decided that this would be the optimal choice (unfortunately, other joints in the running like Giardano's were just too far away). We went on a Saturday night (also Cinco de Mayo) so I was expecting a packed house. In fact, we got quite the opposite: we were seated immediately, but our service was not so immediate. I had to think they were understaffed or our waitress was overworked, but after we were seating, we waited 15 minutes before flagging her down just to get some water, and put in our pizza order. This is the only I'm slighting this place a little bit and subtracting a star. All in all, their classic Chicago pizza was delicious. We ordered a medium pizza for three people, not including myself (though I wasn't that hungry at the time). Having two smaller women in our group was a key factor in a size decision as I think the large would've been too much food. Seriously though, one slice of the large is enough to be a meal. That being said, be careful in choosing a size. Look at other pizzas that people have ordered to get a good idea of how much you'll need. The atmosphere was riddled with baseball memorabilia which indeed gave it a ""classic"" Chicago feel.

But what was a surprise was that I found their house ""Malnati salad"" to be refreshing and delicious.  They used a perfectly sweet vinaigrette to pair with their fresh salad, which included Romaine lettuce, olives, Gorgonzola, salami, fresh tomatoes, and romano cheese.  It was a great way to start out the meal and I'd recommend it to you as a great thing to pair with the heavy deep dish pizzas. Surprisingly enough, my favorite pizza didn't come from either Gino's East or Lou Malnati's.  This distinction was saved for Pequod's Pizzeria, which was not on my radar at all until I talked to some local foodies.  Check out my review on that if you're curious about what I perceived to be the best pizza I had the pleasure of trying in Chicago.",0.9955,0.826,0.174,0.0,0.5909090909090909
2012-04-04,4.0,"If you are going on a trip to Chicago, you need to try some deep dish Pizza.  Much different from our thin crust in NY, this pizza takes a full 45 minutes to cook.  The place to go for this is not Pizzeria Uno (which originated in Chicago), but Lou Malnati's.  Started in 1971, this family owned and operated chain is now 33 Restaurants strong.  The location Carol and I frequent when we go to Chicago is The River North Location on North Wells Street.   Upon entering the restaurant, there were two hostesses on duty.  It was a cold night and the restaurant was not yet busy.  We opted to sit at the bar so we could watch T.V. while we enjoyed our meal.  The hostesses were friendly, but did not seem overly sure of what to do. While at the bar, we were greeted quickly by the bartender, Greg, who offered us drinks and menus.  Carol had a glass of Chardonnay and I opted for an unsweetened Iced Tea.  Both the wine and the tea were good, but the Iced Tea did not taste fresh brewed.   We each ordered an individual Deep Dish Pizza with Lou's famous butter crust - I ordered the Lou and Carol the Classic Chicago.  We split a medium Malnati Salad.  Salad was very good with fresh crisp lettuce and a nice variety of toppings.  The dressing was excellent and had a sweet taste to it.  The Pizzas were phenomenal and the Butter Crust really gave them a great flavor. For Dessert, we tried the Chocolate Chip Cookie Pizza - a deep dish pan with a homemade chocolate chip cookie topped with Vanilla Ice Cream and Whipped Cream.  Very Nice!  The only negative I can give it was that it had too much Whipped Cream on it.   Atmosphere in the restaurant was OK, but I felt it was a little bright.  The walls are filled with pictures and memorabilia so you have a distraction while you wait for your food.  One of my personal pet peeves was evident here as the restaurant was a little slow to start and the servers were standing at the service station doing crossword puzzles and griping about the seating rotation of the hostesses.  There was no manager evident until we were done with our meal, and this would have been his issue to deal with.

I loved the freshness of their tomato sauce, but I thought the butter crust (tm) could use just a dash of salt to balance the buttery richness out. The sausage on the pizza is a favorite of many, but I didn't love the way its done here. Instead of being bits of sausage throughout, this is more one huge disc of sausage that covers the whole pizza. That is my fault in ordering it though, and will try a different variation next time I am back. The spinach mix was lovely though and added a lot of flavor to our pizza. Oh, and if you order a family sized salad, its huge. We were laughing because it took the entire table up, but the sweet dressing they make is really good!

The recommended pizza was the Malnato Chicago Classic deep dish which I thought was very hearty and a delight to eat but felt like it feel short of delivering that ""wow"" factor. I just think with most deep dish pizzas, it's difficult for each of the ingredients to be tasted because it is muddled with all the cheese and tomato sauce. But don't get me wrong, the pizza was not unappetizing or tasteless -- it just wasn't my type of pizza. Probably out of the few places I have tried a deep dish pizza, Lou Malnati's was the best one.

So the fact that I enjoyed the deep dish ""pizza"" as much as I did should say something about this place; that yes indeed, the food was delicious. I was with a friend, and we started off with a single order of bruschetta. It was fucking delicious... fresh tomatoes, cheese, basil on tasty toasted bread. Yes, I was biased because it was the first real Chicago thing I'd eaten since arriving the night before, but the freshness of it is undeniable. Sadly, it did take up more room than I anticipated. So when we got to the Maltani Chicago Classic pizza, we were already slightly full. The pizza was super oily, dripping in butter. The crust was a bit cooked enough, but still was a bit too doughy for my taste. It was definitely like a pie crust, with cheese, tomato sauce, sausage, and other stuff thrown inside.

When we arrived at the only nearby location which opened its doors before 4pm, we were amazed to discover the uncanny resemblance it bared to both Giordano's and the scores of Pizzeria Uno restaurants we had visited in the past. Prior to our venture to Chicago, we made the assumption that Pizzeria Uno was a watered down version of true Chicago-style deep dish. While we have often enjoyed Uno's, we dreamed of discovering Chicago's deep dish equivalent to Difara's, a place that crafts a truly special pie. We enjoyed Lou Malnati's, but found the pizza comparable in nearly every respect to that of Pizzeria Uno. It was good, but nothing to write home about. If Lou Malnati's is truly among Chicago's best, then we are mystified by the ongoing debate between Chicagoans and New Yorkers regarding their native pies. I want to make clear that I do not praise New York pizza simply because it's my hometown. I will proudly wave the flag of any pizzeria regardless of the city, state, country or planet from which it came (see my review of Grimaldi's in Tucson), providing the taste is worthy of such acclaim, but Lou Malnati's simply wasn't that good.",0.9917,0.797,0.188,0.015,0.48211212655657104

You would think that with a combo of sausage and buttery crust this pie would be greasy as hell setting yourself up for a triple bypass ....

Get the smaller one and you will have more than enough for two people.We pre-ordered our pizza, so it came out pretty quickly. It was the perfect Chicago style pizza. Nice flavors, crust actually had flavor enough to want to eat it and was a nice texture.  We had to get dessert when we saw the people next to us get the cookie.. a fresh cookie in a pizza pan with ice cream on top. Hot damn!

As we were in a rush our options were not overwhelming as we had to decide on a place that was walking distance and wouldn't take too long to eat at. Seeing the high rating and number of reviews, Malnati's seemed like the best bet and it ended up being a good call.  Anyways, for around 12pm on a Friday afternoon we only had to wait 15 minutes or so, there were perhaps 5 or 6 other groups already waiting and no one seemed to be too frazzled to be standing around. The great staff also brought out 3 medium pizzas cut in to sample bite sizes for those of us waiting for our tables. While waiting we were able to give in our orders as well to cut down on time. Which is a great default service they offer as we still had to wait at least 10 minutes for our food arrived after being seated.   They were offering a good ""lunch special"" deal for $7 or $8 we would get our own personal pizza along with soup or salad and a huge glass of pop (or soda as they call it in the States).  I ordered the cheese and sausage pizza and opted for the Spinach mix as well for an extra 50cents. But I recommend just the cheese and sausage/pepperoni since they are solid options as they are.  Our server was courteous and quick in serving us, clearly too busy to chat do chat around with us.

2011-11-21,5.0,"Firstly, lets clarify that there are TWO types of deep dish pizza in Chicago. One is a thinner butter crust (Giordanos, Gino's East, Lou Malnati's) and the other type is a thicker more-doughy pie-crusty (Uno, Due, and I think Pequod's though I haven't been here yet). Obviously, everyone has a preference to which type of deep dish they prefer, but I feel people who say Lou Malnati's is so much better than Uno or visa versa are comparing apples and oranges. As far as apples vs apples or oranges vs oranges go, LM serves one freakishly good pizza. The buttery crust which put this place on the map is legit! You eat it knowing it is infused with butter and will shorten your lifespan but it's so good you don't even care! Crunchy, crispy, buttery, goodnessery, deliciousnessery!! Pee-in-your-pants-and-just-continue-eating good! Just writing this review makes me want to go back. I find that after eating out a lot, I consider very few things to live up to the ""hype"" I find advertised on TV or magazine or even on Yelp, but I really think LM lives up to all the positive reviews. Definitely a place I take all visiters.  Also, you can order and they'll make the pizza while you wait. Pretty sweet deal if you ask me!  If you prefer the thicker more-doughy crust, go to Uno's. It's also freaking delicious. A true foodie respects all food worthy of respect, and I think both establishments are great.",0.9952,0.754,0.213,0.033,0.5482081686429513

Conclusion:  Deep dish pizza - yummy.  Lou's was the best of the bunch.  The crust was perfectly crunchy, the dough had the best mouth-feel, the whole-pizza sausage patty well-seasoned, the cheese had wonderful texture, and the toppings are a good amount.  They store your order info under your phone #, so it's easy to tell them you want your usual - deluxe whole sausage, add pepperoni, butter crust, uncut.  Can't go wrong there.

2011-11-21,4.0,"With so many pizzerias in Chi-town, how does one narrow it down within a few days? Impossible unless you're eating stuff crust pizzas for breakfast, lunch, and dinner which would be pretty disturbing. We decided to give Lou's a shot since it had plenty of positive reviews and most importantly, it was in walking distance from our hotel. Giordano's delivered an amazing stuff crust pizza a few days before so now Lou Malnati's had to prove something. When we arrived for dinner, you betcha there was a lovely wait. People were crowded everywhere; from the waiting area inside, to the bar, and even outside on the streets. I don't want to know how everyone huddles together when the whether is extremely cold but I was glad I wasn't there to witness it. We put in our order for our stuff crust pizza which is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED while we waited. Remember, it takes a good half an hour for it to come out so if you order it at the table, you're only wasting valuable time. When we were finally given a table, we were seated outside in their make shift patio if you want to call it that. Good thing the night wasn't too cold, it was a perfect 50 something degrees under clear skies. We were hungry so it really didn't matter where we sat at that point. To start, I ordered the soup of the day which was the corn chowder. They need to put that bad boy permanently on their menu. It was one of the better corn chowders I have tasted. If it's available the day you dine here, give it a try especially if you're a fan of chowder like myself. Another app we ordered was the Malnati salad. Our waitress said that this was a great choice even though in the back of my mind I was questioning: how salads can be possibly that great? Little did I know that the Malnati salad lived up to her words. Whether it was the potent and effective gorgonzola cheese or their classic Lou's dressing, the bowl was spotless after we were done with it. The medium size was more than enough to share between two people. Don't laugh, but that stuff crust pizza I ended ordering was the smallest size they had which was the individual. Although a pretty good pizza, I think I should have at least went with the small size. By comparing my pizza to others around me, I felt like the individual sized pizza lacked something on the grand scale whereas the bigger sizes had that intimidating stuff crust cheese spewing I was hoping to find. Noted for when I return: go with at least a small and bag the rest for to-go if you can't finish it. Still, The ""Lou"" pizza was still a tasty treat. To top off our dinner, we had the individual serving of the chocolate chip pizza. Think of the pizookie from BJ's. Chocolate chip cookie baked in an iron clad pizza pan topped with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream and whipped cream. I like how you have the option to order this smaller size and not have to deal with that fattening regular size we're so use to getting. I think I may have liked this more than the pizookie actually. It takes about 10 minutes to come out so you may want to order this slightly beforehand. It was a great closer to our meal at Lou's. With all our own positive feedback from all the items we sampled this night, I will have to say that I am truly going to miss Lou Malnati's. Again, another satisfying pizzeria that is only located two time zones away from me. =( Come on Lou, open a spot in LA and we'll bring you plenty of business.",0.9986,0.792,0.17,0.038,0.5812943441301649

Very cool looking place and big.....wasnt very crowded and I later found out why. We sat down and had a really nice waitress and we immediately ordered our pizza and salad. We thought it would be 15 minutes or so not knowing deep dish. It was 35-40 minutes. I was starved by then. The pizza was delicious and was good for breakfast a day later.The only downside was the timing and the normal employee couldnt go here because they couldnt get in and out quickly enough.

So here is the scoop - this place did taste different than the other two. The sauce is better, but what gets it is the crust. Its really buttery and the sausage patty (my recommendation) is perfect on the the pie. Their pizza has what you pay for, meat, veggies, where the other guys tend to skimp on the meat. Also the other places crust sucks!!! The pricing is identical, and it does take a while to get your pie. Hey at least you know its fresh as fresh. Their salad is also very good. I woke up with a hangover and the salad settled my tummy before eating my pie. They sell the pizza and the salad dressing (I should have brought some home) but I only brought 3 pizzas home from this place. I tried the three on the 3 nights that we were in Chicago.

They were nice about it, but the wait was twice as long as they had told us.  The pizza tasted awesome after the wait for a table (and another 35 minute wait for the food). But I'm fairly sure it was only that good because of how absurdly hungry I was. I'm not convinced this is Chicago's Best Deep Dish Pizza. It was certainly filling, and it's hard to screw up an inch-thick pile of cheese covered in sauce. The small size was just about right for two. The pizza had a pie-like, buttery crust, about an inch of mozerella, sauce and a layer of sausage. Despite looking impressive, it was surprisingly bland. Parmesean and pepper flakes were necessary to liven things up. The signed H.W. Bush Yale jersey they had on the wall next to us didn't help either.

I was downtown and weighing several deep dish / stuffed locations, but Lou Malnati's seemed to be calling with a siren song. Don't get me wrong, I've been to Lou's and enjoy their thin crust and deep dish all the same and with a friend in from out of town it was time to try some of Chicago's best deep dish pizza. 8:30pm on a Monday night and the line for a table was ""30 to 40 minutes"" worth of waiting. Knowing Chicago deep dish takes about 45 minutes to make, I quickly ordered the Malnati Chicago Classic and patiently waited for my friends to arrive. The Lou's on Wells is a popular tourist spot and there were some English folks enjoying their pizza and a large group of tourists with cameras more advanced than mine. Crowded and family-friendly, there were several strollers rolling around the place. TVs in the background televised the Dallas-Oklahoma City matchup while some tables around were slicing into their pies. The appetizer that arrived was Lou Malnati's three cheese bread. Upon seeing this behemoth, my jawk dropped! I didn't really read the menu and thought I was ordering bread sticks or something. Instead this giant loaf of bread dropped down on the table and it was a welcome sight as I hadn't eaten all day. The bread was crisp but could have used a bit of garlic, but overall a solid appetizer. The moment of truth had finally arrived right on our table. Lou's renowned butter crust has been a staple of the deep dish circuit over the better part of the past thirty years and this was the place to be. Picking up my knife and carving into the piece of pie, I could hear the crispiness of the crust as I cut into it. Starving, the pizza was worth the salt and the extra pepperoni added some additional flavor. Lou's deep dish also has an entire layer of sausage cooked underneath the top and the tomato sauce mixed with the sausage flavor and butter crisp to make the fiercest version of Chicago Deep Dish.

2011-09-05,3.0,"I have been here once before but my boyfriend had never been and wanted to try deep dish pizza.  It's hard to get a consensus on which place has the best deep dish in Chicago when doing research but this one kept popping up along with few others. We started off with calamari which was average.  They serve it with cocktail sauce which I'm not really a fan of. Next up was a Chicago Classic.  I think it's official: I don't like deep dish pizza.  I don't get it, I think it's too heavy and I can barely make my way through more than one slice.  The more I ate it, the less I liked it.  The tomato sauce and cheese were good, there was too much sausage and the butter crust was just okay.   That's not to say you shouldn't try it.  It wasn't bad quality, just not my thing.  It might be yours.  And I'm glad I did try it because I think any connoisseur of pizza (and I do love pizza) needs to try all the different kinds they can. My advice would be to try it for a later lunch, when we just walked right in to a table.  We passed by the next night and there were at least 30 people outside waiting.",0.9771,0.843,0.127,0.031,0.37597789115646263

Me and a bunch of friends were in town for the Cards/Cubs games last weekend (shut up, I don't want to hear it...) and stopped by here Friday for dinner. I was very pleasantly surprised. Intimidated by the large city and the popularity of deep dish pizza joints, I was expecting ""We're-so-awesome-we-don't-have-to-try"" service. Not so. We were seated promptly, and then helped by three different people. It was kind of amusing. One of the servers explained it was because they were in the middle of shift change, so he wanted to make sure we weren't missed. We appreciated this - instead of standing back and waiting until tables were assigned and turned over, several servers saw our table with no food or drinks in front of us and went out of their way to make sure we were taken care of, even though it wasn't necessarily their table. We noticed, and we appreciated it. Our friendly evening shift server then moved our group to a roomy booth across the room after one opened up shortly after we were seated so we could be more comfortable and have a better view of the game (shut UP, I don't want to hear it!). Another thoughtful gesture that wasn't necessary, but appreciated. When our beer order got mixed up in the fluster of shift change and he brought us an extra beer, he let us keep it free of charge. He was outgoing, friendly, and attentive for our whole meal. He really made us feel welcome and that our patronage was valuable. The food, all around, was excellent. The deep dish pizza was just as amazing as I hoped it would be. We left full and happy, despite the disheartening loss in the 10th inning of our home team.

2011-07-06,5.0,"I'm an outsider who recently came to Chicago to visit a friend. One of our top priorities was to try out some of the most famous deep dish pizzerias in Chicago - Pizzeria Uno, Gino's East, Lou Malnati's, and Giordano's.  For me, Lou Malnati's came in a very close second place, just behind Giordano's. The deep dish pizza here is definitely very different from the other 3 places. The slices are smaller, and the crust is thinner (so take note that you should probably order more than you normally would at the other deep dish places). It also seems like, instead of overwhelming you with an enormous, thick slice of pizza, Lou's takes a more refined approach. And boy did it work. The flavors were perfect, and the butter crust was delicious (not an easy feat - most of the other butter crusts I had on this trip were thick, dry, and just plain excessive).  We got here around 7:30 PM on a Sunday. We were quoted for a 90 minute wait, but got inside in less than an hour (funny how an hour-long wait became something to celebrate). After that, it took another 40 minutes or so for the pizza to get to our table. One negative was that, instead of leaving the pizzas at our table, the waiter kept it on a tray by the wall, which means that we had to wait for him to come by every time to refill our plates. I don't know if we were allowed to just walk over and get our own slices or what, but that was kind of just a strange thing, and since the restaurant was crowded, we ended up sitting around waiting for more pizza, which should not have happened. So the service wasn't the best, but it was tolerable. However, the ambience was the best of the four pizzerias that I visited - just a nice, clean place to enjoy great pizza. Make the journey now!

The pizza is definitely cheesy.  Thanks to the fresh tomatoes, the pizza was moist but somehow the thick crust stood up against all the ingredients well.  Comparing it to Pequod's, it's less sauce but tastes more refreshing, or as refreshing as a deep dish possible could.  The crust is a super flaky buttery crust and yes, you can go for the thin version... but unless you live in Chicago, then just go with the deep dish! Our pizza took awhile to arrive (around 40 minutes) so it's probably a good idea to order a salad or appetizer.  We just wanted to eat our fill of deep dish so we didn't get any, but thanks to that strategy, I did manage to take down 2 1/2 slices!  Whooo!

The wait was about an hour, not too bad - but it was pretty bad if our insides were eating us alive because we were THAT hungry. Luckily, our breaded mushrooms appetizer came in a flash. The breaded mushrooms were pretty good. It was lightly breaded and crispy. The mushrooms were fresh. Wow I must admit, I really do love mushrooms! For 3 really hungry girls, we've ordered two 6 inch deep dish pizzas. One is the Malnati's Chicago Classic, a special house sausage, with extra cheese and vine ripen tomato sauce in butter crust. The other deep dish we've gotten was the vegetable pizza because one of the girls is a vegetarian. Okay, so the sausage pizza was just okay. The vegetable pizza was actually pretty good - veggies gave it more texture and crunch, which the pizza itself lacked. The butter crust, well it was buttery, but I wasn't too fond of it. Maybe the New Yorker me is spoiled by pizzas in NYC and found this deep dish pizza overrated?  For dessert, we've ordered the Chocolate Chip Pizza, a freshly baked chocolate chip cookie prepped in a deep dish pizza pan, topped with vanilla ice cream and loads of whipped cream. The dessert was pretty good, the warm cookie with the combination of ice cream was super! The vanilla ice cream was not white, but it has a hint of orange coloring. To be really honest, I felt the mushrooms and the dessert were the best highlight of that entire meal. Maybe it is just me, a New Yorker, who loves her thin crust pizza.",0.9985,0.757,0.236,0.007,0.5346869314260618

2011-05-02,4.0,"There are more cabs in Chicago than deep dish pizza places ... but not many more.  Deep dish pizza has become the ubiquitous menu entry in far too many restaurants who care far too little about the craft of preparation.   Lou Malnati's is my choice when I decide that I really need to do deep dish.  Here are my three reasons: 1) Malnati Chicago Classic - Sausage pizza where the sausage is a thin slab that covers the bottom of the pizza.  Sausage with substance.  Even better is the buttercrust, which manages to support a deep dish offering without being the layer of rigid particle board you get on so many other deep dish crusts.   Can deep dish pizza be light?  This might be as close as it gets to that gustatory oxymoron. 2) It's Not Pizzeria Uno -   I actually like Pizzeria Uno.  I like it in Detroit, in Ohio, in California, in Vermont.   Why do common when uncommon is just down on Wells.   3) 30% Less Touristy - Sure there are out of town visitors here, but it doesn't have the feel of a place that ONLY tourists would visit.

The sausage was barely cooked and thrown on top without any care.  The service was pretty horrible and our waitress was totally aloof. Our plates were on the other side of the table and when she came to cut the first slices, she just held out her hand without asking ""Can you please pass me those plates.""

I've had better at Joe's Crab Shack, seriously.  The sauce for it was pretty good though. The house salads were standard, but the gorgonzola dressing was so good you could eat it with a spoon.

Asking my friends (2 of whom live there, and a couple of whom have visited in the last year) I was getting differing opinions. I had already tried Giordano's, wasn't too impressed. So we decided to go to Lou Malnati's. We ordered take-out because the place was PACKED!! I ordered a small deep dish with italian sausage and pepperoni. Apparently, the italian sausage is most popular, and really could see why. The size small is 9 inches, was enough to feed 3 girls, and came out to be $13.50. REALLY!? $13.50?! soo cheap!!! i was seriously shocked at how much quality and taste was in the pizza for such a price!  But first, the restaurant: We took the brown line to merchandise mart and the restaurant was only a few blocks away. very convenient!! The place, as I've said, was packed! There were people outside, and as soon as we opened the door, it was hard to get in because people were waiting.  the restaurant interior is warm, brightly lit with orangey lights, tables pretty close together but not in a bad way bc it gave off a very homey feel. The employees (the one who directed me to the restroom and the one that helped me at the counter) were all very nice, easy going, and friendly.  Back to the pizza: SOOOO yum!! the crust was crispy,  cheese was enough to be delicious, but not overpowering and not too much. the italian sausage!! the seriously, lined the entire pie with the italian sausage. as you can see from my picture, the entire pie is lined with a sheet of sausage so that you get a heavy dose of sausage in every bite. that was different from giordano's, whose pizza my friends and I exclaimed ""wait..wheres the sausage!!?"". The saltiness of the pepperoni was perfectly balanced against the juiciness of the fresh tomatoes that filled the top of the pie. When we opened the pie, it was juicy due to the fresh tomatoes, so be careful if you're taking it long distances. (Quick tip: we took it to the portillo's a few blocks away and ate it before we ate their hot dogs and italian beef sandwiches. Sorry portillo's, :P, we know we broke your rules, but 3 hungry girls in a big city CANNOT be expected to wait until we get to our hotel room before we dive into the food :P)  all in all, my favorite meal in Chicago. best pizza I've ever tasted. juicy, fresh, crispy, savory, yummy, delicious.

And thus they had a thin crust which was pretty good alternative. As for the famous Malnati Chicago Classic, it was pretty damn yummy but I wish there were other veggies such as green peppers to balance out the layers of tomatos and sausages which does get overwhelming after the first slice. My favorite part was the crust which was perfectly crunch and not too doughy, and so delicious that you could probably munch on it as a snack later.

My colleagues had been in Chicago a few weeks back for a trade show that had lasted 3-4 days. Apparently, they had dined at LM's more than just a few times during the course of their trip (this was the location they had visited) - this already says a lot about this place! LM's left such an impression on my boss, that he wanted to order some for the office!  How AWESOME is it that they deliver nationally?!?! My boss ordered the Best Value (6 small-9"" pizzas for 99.95). We got the 3 pepperoni/3 sausage; we ordered on Wednesday and they were delivered to us on Friday morning, still frozen thanks to the awesome styrofoam box and dry ice! The moment our treasure trove was delivered, we opened it immediately and popped one into our toaster oven. The cook time was 45 minutes so as it was cooking and the aura of pizza heaven wafted our office, we were all ready to eat when it was done! As soon as it was done, we popped in a second pizza to cook while we ate. Now, imagine this: one small 9"" pizza that is meant to serve two adults was divvied up to serve five adults. It was pretty much a sampler, but as we had our pizza cooking-rotation system going on, we were all well fed by the end of the day (we went through 2.5 pizzas)! The pizza cooked wonderfully with cheesy mozzarella and a golden buttery crust.  My favorite part/ingredient is probably their tomato sauce: it had chunks of tomato in it!! Unlike any other Chicago-style pizzas I've had in California (Zachary's in Berkeley and Lefty's in San Diego), LM's pizzas are simple yet delicious. They're not so salty that you're gulping water every few bites, and not stuffed with other filler ingredients; you can taste all of the components of their pizza. I'm so glad we still have three more pizzas sitting in our office freezer to save us the trip to Chi town! :P",0.9945,0.855,0.145,0.0,0.5308755760368663

My friends all said eat here, so I did.  We made reservations for 5:30 and we were seated promptly.  Good thing we got there at that time, because by 6 it was pretty packed.  We all started out with the Malnati Salad, which is AMAZING!  If you go here, definitely get that salad.  The dressing was just right, a little tangy, a little sweet and the bacon bits gave it a little more crunch. We ordered a deep dish sausage pizza.  Another reason to go a bit early is deep dish pizza's take a little longer to cook (approx. 40 mins).  The waitress was nice, she did not try to get us to order the largest portion of everything, but told us mediums would probably be enough for three, which it was. The pizza itself was delicious, very fresh products, the sausage was well seasoned, but and the tomato sauce was really fresh with some larger chunks of tomato.  I enjoyed the pizza because the crust was not too thick, but the only issue I had was the buttery crust.  It made it kind of flaky and taste like a biscuit, which in turn made it a little more doughy then I would have liked.  For the dessert we got the chocolate chip cookie with ice cream, which was delicious- probably tastes the same everywhere.  When it got crowded the waitress came back a little less, which was fine, but completely forgot our dessert order till 30 minutes later.  She did not even take it off the receipt, but oh well.  I decided to order a fresh frozen pizza to take back to DC, which worked out well and hopefully that tastes as good as the one in the store!  I would have given it 4.5 stars, due to the service and I really liked another pizza place, so it was not ""As good as it gets,"" but I am a FAN!",0.9972,0.807,0.193,0.0,0.5348024316109423

The crust is buttery and delicious in every way, the cheese is melted to the perfect level of stringiness, there's just enough of that undeniably savory tomato sauce -- and the sausage is just indescribable. Only Lou does this just right. So get used to it: You have to plan your trip to Lou Malnati's. Eat breakfast and be prepared to wait until 2:00 for lunch. The smallest size they have is just enough for two people, no matter what it says on the menu about it being suitable for one (unless you're a bear). This plan really works.

Of all the deep dish pizzas I have had in Chicago, this place is tops for me.  I am a person that's not big on having too much sauce on my pizza and usually like my sauce thick.  Lou Malnati's: check!  You will feel as if you get more cheese here on your pizza than sauce which is perfect for me.  Also the crust is not cornmeal and buttered well so you get a nice crunchy crust.  I would also recommend starting the meal off with the Malnati Salad as well.  Really good flavorful dressing on that.  Another note: don't ask for too many vegetables on your deep dish pizza because it will make the pizza a little runny due to the water that cooks off the vegetables...

I think a good pizza is about a good crust and sauce, toppings yeah they are important but without the crust and sauce the toppings don't matter.  Lou's has the best crust and sauce I've ever had on a pizza, the toppings are also excellent.  It's just fantastic substantive pizza that doesn't get overwhelmed by stuff toppings (If you want the obscenely thick stuffed pizza head to Giordano's, Lou's isn't that and they are better because of it). I couldn't recommend this place enough... it's not a place that will be buzzing with annoying tourists, but it is busy because Lou's isn't a secret.  The service is good but be patient, it takes a while to cook the stuff.  If your in a rush you can call ahead and put in your order (or if there is a wait, you can order so it cooks while you wait for your table... do this, be smart don't wait until you sit down to order a pizza that takes more than 20 min to cook).

Never before in my life have I tasted, let alone heard of, Gorgonzola dipping sauce. I ordered it on a ""feeling adventurous"" whim and it was a very well-placed whim. This sauce was the consistency of sour cream and faintly reminiscent of bleu cheese dips but it was all its own and complimented the wings like peanut butter goes with jelly.

I think I'm just too passionate about the exquisitely indulgent meal I just had that I need to try my best to convey my foodie feelings. Here's a love letter to my first deep dish pizza: No others will ever compare to you. I thought I knew what ""Chicago style deep dish"" was. I thought BJ's Brewery served me the real thing. I thought all you needed was a deep pie dish, dough and voila, you've got your Chi town pizza. Oh, but others have lied. They're impostors. And you, Lou, have managed to turn a depressing Domino's disgrace into a gourmet masterpiece of cheese, dough, sausage, dough, real tomatoes and some more cheesy dough.  You could strip each layer of the pizza and you'd unveil the craftsmanship behind the pie. The cheese is in-between the bottom layers of dough, the sausage seems to be one huge slice instead of those balls of ""sausage"" that's usually sprinkled on top and the sauce--non-existent. Instead you get real pieces of stewed tomatoes. Oh yes, it's heavenly. That crust is proof that butter works wonders. I couldn't get enough of the crispy, flakey buttery crust that seriously could been the entire pizza and I would have been happy.

Some trivia - my cab driver told me that the founder of this joint used to work at the restaurant that actually invented the deep dish pizza years ago. I realize now that over 90 percent of pizza out there is more artificial than natural - what sets this apart is how fresh the ingredients are, which is fairly obvious when you sink your teeth into the textured crust, and savor the blending flavors of the vegetables, tender sausage, and the non-gratuitous amount of high quality cheese.   They bring it out in the pan that it actually baked within, and the pizza is surprisingly watery to a slight degree due to the moisture coming out of the dough.  This quality makes the pizza taste like a pie rather than a bread.  What an amazing experience.  Try it with the Malnati salad, which has just the right amount of dressing that's sweet and tangy, blended into the wonderfully fragrant vegetables, which is the perfect complement to the heaviness of the pie.

Awesome that they deliver, since most, if not all, places in SF with deep dish pizza don't deliver.  I kind of see why, though after this expedition with LM. They delivered us the wrong pizza.  It wasn't even a deep dish pizza, and the receipt attached to the box was clearly for a different party.  It took awhile to get a hold of the restaurant and fix the mix-up and so our actual pizza delivery was delayed by about half an hour (in addition to the original half an hour it takes to get a pizza delivered).   So unfortunately, by the time we got OUR pizza delivered, it had been sitting in the box for a bit longer than a normal delivery time, and the crust had time to get a little soggy.  The flavors were good, but compared to my trusty Little Star Pizza in SF, I can't give LM more than 3 stars.

Considering I'm not huge on pizza to begin with, and this place actually made me LIKE deep dish (which again, I had never experienced before Lou's) I have to give it at least 4 stars. I reserve the 5th star because I have nothing to compare Lou's to. We called ahead to check on the wait - none. We arrived to an about 1/2 full restaurant around 2 pm on a Monday. We walked in to a semi-disgruntled hostess who finished helping a couple people who were picking up food before seating us and calling a waitress over.  What the hostess lacked in social skills, the waitress more then made up for with her smiling, friendly, here-to-serve-you attitude. She was a pleasure to deal with. We browsed the menu, placed an order for the Original Lou's deep dish (red sauce, tomatoes, garlic, mozzarella, Italian sausage) and began the wait (as deep dish is made fresh by the pie, it would take 20-40 minutes, we were told). We were happy to wait, and even happier when the pizza arrived to our table, in all it's glory, 25 minutes later. We feasted our eyes on the 2 inch deep pan of pizza pleasure while the waitress sliced us each a chunk of the cheesy, chewy treat. We all took our first bites of Chicago deep dish pizza and looked at one another. Check. Nod. Smile. It was good! My boyfriend was skeptical, I was worried I hadn't picked an authentic enough restaurant to try the deep dish and my mom was just plain hungry. And we all ended up loving the deep dish! I would certainly go back to Lou's for deep dish. I would like to try Uno and Due and Giordanos and Ginos. But given the ""bad food"" and ""exacerbating waits"" described for those places, I was happy being able to walk into Lou's unannounced and be able to enjoy a great deep dish pizza within 30 minutes of reaching the restaurant. Next time I'm in Chicago, I will have to try one of the more popular places for a comparison. Then, all things considered, we will have a true understanding of where Lou's places in the derby of deep dish. Wait: None, walked right in.

For starters, I have to say that I am an East Coast person and looooove pizza, but usually only thin-crust.

It's exactly how I will think of Chicago pizza from now on (I know I've said, Chicago way too much, but I can't help it). It's an actual pie with a great crisp crust; lots of filling (we had one sausage/meat and one spinach/veggie; meat was much better); a proportionate amount of cheese. Soo good. I may just order some online and have it delivered to me in Arlington! Oh--a couple things about this location. Holiday weekend, marathon... it was packed. Our wait for 5 people was over 40 min.

The Chocolate Chip Pizza was great.  It was a monstrosity of ice cream and whip cream on top of a big chocolate chip cookie, sitting in a deep dish pan.  I only had a couple of bites though, and let my sister have the rest.   I think next time I try Chicago deep dish, I will go to another restaurant.  Lou Malnati's was not bad, but I'm betting there's better pizza to be had in Chicago.",0.9944,0.846,0.138,0.016,0.5497727272727273

2010-09-22,5.0,"Hands down the best deep dish there is out there because of it's delicious crust and sauce.  These two things definitely set it apart from all other deep dish pizzas.  I've been 3 times and everytime I went back the pizza was just as delicious as I had remembered!  The prices are very reasonable and the atmosphere was very fun and energetic.  Definitely a good palce to go with family or friends. Another thing to note about this palce is their amazing salads!  The Malnati salad is delicious as was their summer watermelon & chicken salad.  They come with have tons of delicious, unique, and fresh toppings and are very affordable! The only downside about the dining expereince is the wait to get seated when it's busy.  I've gone 1 time and been seated right away, but the other 2 times I went I had to wait almost an hour.  My advice is to go to one of the bars or resturaunts around and grab a drink while you wait.  (We went to Sushi Sambe across the street twice, sat in their loungs and got cocktails which made the wait fun!)

So we arrived around 1:30pm and this place was packed, we had to wait five to ten minutes for a seat, but that wasn't a problem. We started off our meal with two beers and an order of wings. They had a special ranch sauce that was very plain, there wasn't much of a ranch taste. But the wings still had a kick and were really good! We ordered a peperoni deep dish, and when we ordered our waiter said it would take 45 minutes. It took 45 minutes. However, when he brought it out, he said because it took so long he would give us a free dessert! Right on! The pizza was delicious, like I said I'm not a huge fan of deep dish because of the amounts of cheese they put on it, but we both cleared our plates.  The Pzookie (or half baked cookie with ice cream, whipped cream, and a cherry on top) definitely hit the spot.

What I don't love is having to spend a Saturday with fellow classmates for a 7 hour long orientation. When I found out that we were having Lou Malnati's catered, I had - or so I thought - one bright point of my Saturday to look forward to.  Well, to be brief, my bright point wasn't very good. The sauce didn't taste fresh and the crust was soggy. Don't get me wrong, I use canned diced and stewed tomatoes in many dishes I make at home; it's just when you are going to have a sauce on a Chicago deep dish pizza, it's a pretty damned important component that should taste good whether dine-in, carry out or delivery. The thin crust was actually significantly better than the deep dish; I would give that a solid 3 stars but unfortunately cannot click 2.5. I'm fully aware that travel time, standing time, etc... can lead to a pizza that isn't as great of quality as if I would have sat in the Lou Malnati's and ordered a pizza, but overall taste is only going to change to a certain degree.

It didn't take me long to figure out what I wanted to order since I usually order a plain slice with tomatoes as a topping. In this case I got the same just Chicago style while my mother ordered the ""Lou"". What we did not realize is that it takes 30 minutes to prepare the deep dish pizza and since we were on a somewhat tight schedule we decided to order it, go run some errands and come back. We were back about 40 minutes later and we got our food right away. we both had individual sized pies, they were both good but neither was exceptional. I did have a hard time figuring out how the hell was I going to take a bite into that pizza since it is so thick, but I figured it out eventually.

The pizza (sized for 2 people) was just intimidating in its size and gooeyness.  We ordered the ""Lou"" pizza which was loaded with veggies.  Unfortunately the veggies were just drowned by bread and oozing cheese.  I like fresh, crisp, flavorful veggies so this was not for me.  The crust was thick and had a decent texture, but did nothing for me in terms of taste.  The cheese was standard pizza cheese.  The sauce was unremarkable; I don't really remember anything about it.

(2.75 rounds to 3, I can do math) I was ridiculously excited to go to Chicago to consume some REAL deep dish pizza. I've only ever had Chicago ""style"" pizza in NY. I heard that the locals' go to Lou's for their fix. What I didn't expect was A) It's clearly a chain and has the kitschy olive garden/applebees feel to it and B) Cheese fail.  Generally, to gauge restaurants, I order a basic staple and something a little more complex to contrast it. I like having both ends of the food spectrum. So, you can guess that I ordered a plain 6in cheese and the ""Lou"" pizza.  Plain Cheese Pizza- Wtf? I thought I was eating reheated mozzarella sticks on top of dough. This is the cheesefail part. I was concerned that I was eating pizza hut ( I've had it once in my life! ) in another dimension in Chicago. The crust was crunchy, doughy and carbalicious, but the cheese was terrible. It came off in giant clumps and if you pulled them they would stretch --but not break, like mozzarella sticks. If this pizza were a 11th grade student taking the NYS english regents, it would fail by 5 points.  The Lou - Ah, now this dish had some cajones! Spinach, mushrooms, sliced tomatoes, mozzarella, romano and cheddar cheese and some spices all played nicely together. The toppings didn't clump off and it certifiably had some zest to it.  86/100 Lou!  Sorry Chicagoans but I'm just not convinced.

The plain was delicious and I thought it was actually better than Gino's East, which I had had only a few days earlier. I wish I could say the same thing for the sausage deep dish though. The sausage seemed to cover the entire pizza and was completely overwhelming. I really did not enjoy it very much.

When we arrived we waited next to the hostess station to be seated. After a few minutes of standing there with no one helping us, finally the hostess turned to look at us and angrily said ""do you need something?"" Obviously, we would like to be seated, thanks for being so great at your job... When we were ordering we decided to order the ""individual sized pizzas"" thinking it would be enough for a lunchtime meal....we were wrong. The 'Individual' size pizzas should be called the 'child size' pizzas, because they are enough for only a 5 year old. They do not even come served in the deep dish tray, but on a mini plate. The pizza itself was good, however, there was very little of it, and we had to wait an hour for our pizza...AN HOUR for the pizza the size of my fist. We only actually received our pizza once we flagged down another member of the waitstaff. Our waitress passed by us numerous times without asking how things were, or letting us know our order was on the way. Frankly, I think she forgot about us, because for awhile she was standing against the wall of the restaurant doing nothing.

Let me preface this review by showing my cards: I lived in New Haven for seven years, and as anyone versed in pizza knows, New Haven is ground zero for it.  Chicago pizza is a different beast than the New Haven style. It is deep dish. I had heard some about the deep dish crust being greasy, but I didn't find that here. Actually, this crust seemed rather dry to me. We also ordered one of their thin crust pizzas, but don't even go there. It's neither Chicagoan nor anything else--the thin crust is just a sop to those who are afraid of carbo-overload. I thought the pizza was tasty. But that was it. I would not stand in line for this.

It was basically garlic bread topped with cheddar and mozzarella with a marinara dipping sauce. In fact, it was so good, we ate all three pieces before I could even take a picture ( tiny.cc/ecuyw ). The crust of the pizza was unforgettable. I'm not sure what kind of crust it was, but it was corn-meal-y in terms of texture and extremely crispy.

There are actual diced tomatoes in the sauce, its not so pulverized that you forget what you are eating.  -The cheese, like the crust, isn't over powering.

This is my second visit to Chicago and now I can finally compare two Chicago-style deep dish pizzas and Lou's definitely kicks Giordano's in the behind. After my daylong flight and four hour wait at the airport, I was looking forward for some good Chicago-style pizza. I was not disappointed at all and actually pleasantly surprised by how much I liked Lou's.  We ordered the famous ""Lou,"" with spinach, mushrooms, and sliced tomatoes, with the addition of sausage. The best part of the pizza was the buttermilk crust. Unlike the flaky and dense dough from Giordano's, Lou's buttermilk crust is lighter and more buttery. It is wildly addictive as I found myself wanting more crust than the rest of the pizza (usually I just like to eat the pizza and forgo the crust). I think my only complaint about this pizza is that the excess of vegetables creates a watery composition. This is due to the water loss from the spinach and the pizza becomes not quite soggy per say, but it would be getting there. But I can appreciate that the three vegetarian ingredients keeps the flavors simple and good. Between two people, we ended up ordering a large with 8 slices that feeds four people. I managed to polish off three slices before satiation overcame me. All of this was washed down with an ice cold coke. Last time at Giordano's, I said life was good.

2010-02-23,2.0,"This is a review for the gluten free among us. I went to Lou Malnati's to try their (in)famous gluten free pizza. To make the pizza gluten free they substitute a large disk of sausage for the crust. Since hearing about it, I haven't spoken with anyone who actually tried it. I think it's one of those things that sounds interesting, but is a little more than the stomach can handle. I ordered a small (rather than personal size) with the optimistic hope that I would love it and want leftovers. With my first bite, I was surprised to find that the sausage is not dripping with grease, and actually has a distant resemblance to the consistency of a chewy crust. This is not what sausage is supposed to do. After a few more exploratory bites, I decided it was not a bad substitute -- the lack of oil/fat in the sausage is good because really fatty sausage in that quantity could do a person in. But without the flaky pizza crust to support it, the sauce and the whole pizza tasted bland. I had two slices, then called it a day. The leftovers didn't go home with me. Lou's has had this version of the gluten free pizza for a while now, and back when they started serving it there was much less known about the food chemistry of how to make a gluten-free crust, and certainly fewer suppliers of quality ingredients. Times have changed though, and several companies are now serving excellent gluten free pizza that is indistinguishable from the rest. Lou's needs to revisit this offering and bring it up to date. if you're with someone who HAS to have Lou Malnati's, the personal pizza is a viable part of a larger meal.

We were expecting to need a box to take home leftovers because we'd read that while the pie wasn't huge, it was filling. There was no need for a box because the pizza was just that good, and we scarfed it all down (politely, of course). The spinach and mushrooms tasted very fresh and the tomatoes that garnished the pizza were slightly crispy. Plenty of cheese yet it didn't feel too heavy. The crust was nicely buttery.

I was happy to see that you could order personal sized pizza's, as my bf and I have polar opposite taste in what toppings we like. We put in our order and enjoyed some starter salads in the meantime. Unfortunately the pizza's took much longer to make it to us than we had originally been informed. We weren't going to say anything, and in the end didn't have to. The manager came out on his own with our waitress to apologize for the delay and let us know that dessert was on the house. Yum! Free fresh baked chocolate chip cookie/ice cream for us!

I had to wait for what felt like centuries for one of their own waitresses to finish doing god knows what in there before I could go in.

During said bathroom wait though I overheard two managers talking about how a customer gave great remarks on how good the pizza was. They seemed genuinely excited about the great comments so to me that translates as pride in their work and restaurant.

On our most recent trip to Chicago (in December) Lou Malnati's was on our list of places to dine. Our first trip to this particular location was on a cold and snowy Chicago night. It so happened that the power was out so there were no pizzas being cooked that night. Before we left Chicago we stopped by Lou Malnati's and picked up one large deep dish combo pizza and one large sausage and cheese thin crust pizza. The deep dish pizza was extremely heavy. We carried both pizzas through the O'hare International Airport. People all over the airport stopped us to tell us how much they love Lou Malnati's pizza. By the time we had both pizzas at home they were cold. We reheated them in our convection oven and they tasted absolutely heavenly. The crust on the deep dish pizza was buttery and had the right amount of crunch, the sauce was zesty and flavorful, and they had a good amount of toppings to make the combo. The thin crust was delicious, the cheese and sausage were made to perfection. Pizza is among my favorite things to eat. Lou Malnati's is the best Chicago style pizza I have ever had in my life.

I must say that Lou Malnatis is really the best of the 4 major deep dish places in Chicago for me.  Now the interesting thing for me, is I actually prefer the pizza to be reheated at home in the oven as opposed to straight from their oven.  I usually try to save at least half the pizza after purchase to reheat at a later date :). This place does tend to get pretty packed, and as has been mentioned in other reviews, I have noticed slow service when I've actually eaten in. Granted, it is rare for me to eat in, so it's not a major concern of mine. The outdoor seating is nice, when the weather is. However, it does tend to take even longer to actually get drinks/food out front than it does inside. My favorite is simply the Sausage Pizza.  I can't recommend one better.",0.9631,0.863,0.11,0.027,0.46285202252944185

When the spinach stuffed bread arrived, it just looked like a mini loaf  of bread but once we sliced it as we do with bread, it was filled with gooey cheese and spinach.

It was fine with us since we had time to digest the stuffed bread. The pizza was cheesy, and filled with fresh ingredients you can taste. It was the most wonderful deep dish I had.

For toppings, we chose pepperoni, spicy mix (ghiardani maybe?) and spinach. WOW.  It came out after I had already washed down two delicious bloody marys and was ready to devour.   The place would get 5 stars, but the service really really sucked and the decor is lame. We had to ask over and over for menus; get ourselves drinks at the bar; ask over and over for water; hunt down our waitress. It was annoying. But not enough to significantly denigrate a sublime culinary outing.",0.8324,0.791,0.14,0.069,0.513847837985769

But I had never had a true Chicago style deep dish pizza to compare it to... so I felt rather biased in saying that Zachary's pizza was the best thing EVER... So I resolved that the next time I was in Chicago, I would go and get true Chicago style deep dish pizza... and I would settle that question once and for all... ...So for the past couple of weeks (OK maybe a month) every time we had meetings preparing for this meeting I would say, ""OK, team, the most important thing for this upcoming meeting is for us to go get Chicago style deep dish pizza..."" I wonder if my colleagues got annoyed of me saying that... Hehehe... Anyway so... We got here to Chicago and all of us that were on the SFO to ORD flight were starving... So I said, ""Deep dish pizza?"" (Borderline obnoxious, I know.) Within 20 minutes (after saying hellos to a bunch of other folks we ran into in the lobby) we were on our way to Lou Malnati's (which was recommended by the kind concierge at the Westin River North lobby)... ...And the verdict? Zachary's wins. At least for me. The pizza at Lou's was OOOOOOKAY. For someone who's used to getting tomato filled deep dish pizzas... These cheese filled ones were a bit bland... But I wonder if something was wrong with my taste buds? Because I couldn't really taste the heaps of red pepper flakes I put on top... Maybe it was the FANTASTIC salad that masked the pizza... Man was that salad good... Mushrooms, olives, baaaaacccoooon, tomatos... YUMMY YUMMY dressing... WOW... ...So, if it was just the pizza, I would have given this place 3 stars.

We placed an order for a bottle of wine and a medium deep dish 'Lou' pizza with butter crust. This specialty pizza has spinach, tomatoes, and mushrooms, with a blend of cheeses.  The wine was brought to our table already open, which was highly unusual. The waiter later explained, after we brought it up, that the bartenders inside always do this. Not a great policy for $20+ bottle of wine, in my opinion. On that note, there wasn't really much ambiance to speak of at Lou Malnati's; they seem to be primarily focused on their pizzas, which actually is not a bad thing. The pizza itself was quite good. The toppings were fresh and flavorful, the crust was flaky and delicious, and the tomato sauce was just right. The price was reasonable, too, especially compared with other deep dish joints around town (see my other pizza reviews). We were content after eating 4 of the 6 slices, and I happily took the leftovers home with me. The next morning I topped my leftover slices with some fresh chopped spinach and popped them in the toaster oven for a few minutes. I sat myself down with the pizza in front of me, and as I brought the first forkful to my mouth I experienced again the pleasantly complex aromas of the sauce, the cheese, the toppings, and the crust, and I drooled just a little.

2009-08-10,4.0,"Having visited Art of Pizza when my family was too full to enjoy it, we opted for another go around with the windy city's pizza after spending a few hours in Millennium Park and wandering about Michigan Avenue.  Parking all the way back at the park and hiking the three quarters of a mile was not my mother's idea of fun given the city's street/sidewalk quality, but the weather was beautiful and a walk was in order after the gluttony of previous days.  While Chicago foodies will argue back and forth until the end of time about whether Uno's founder Ike Sewell or employee Rudy Malnati (whose sons own both Lou Malnati's and Pizano's) originally invented the deep-dish, all I wanted was an excellent pie.  As my sister had been to Uno and we'd all tried Giordano's in the past, the choice was Lou Malnati's or Gino's East - we opted for Lou's. Arriving just after 1:00pm the patio was open but we opted to eat indoors at the River North location on Wells Street.  Greeted promptly by a friendly young waitress who I honestly couldn't believe was old enough to serve a beer, our waters were filled quickly and my sister opted for a local Goose Island 312 while my aunt and mother chose their standard iced tea.  Orders placed we sat and waited while examining the kitschy bar interior and laughing as the crowd burst into boos while watching the Yankees put up a few runs on the White Sox.   Waiting for about 10 minutes we were brought our first item, Lou's Bruschetta with fresh chopped tomato and basil tossed with olive oil and served with homemade garlic toast.  Excellent and crisp Italian toast with a mild although notably clean tasting olive oil and subtle use of garlic was matched well by the impressively fresh tomatoes and aromatic basil.  While it wasn't listed, I detected a bit of rosemary in the dish that added additional complexity.  At less than $5 the portion was generous and the quality excellent. Finishing our bruschetta it was another 20 minutes before the young lady arrived to tell us our pizza would be out soon.  Interestingly, my mother began sorting plates from the center of the table at this time and noted one to be quite dirty.  Showing this to the server the server stated ""hmm, well, all our plates are in the washer now but I'll see if I can find one.""  With nearly twenty Lou's operating in Illinois, I'd like to think their flagship would have a bit more tableware - or that someone in the place could hand wash a dish. Arriving in about 10 minutes, along with a fresh plate, was our main event - a medium Lou with Buttercrust, Fresh spinach, mushrooms and sliced tomatoes covered with a blend of mozzarella, romano and cheddar cheese.   Served in prototypical deep-dish glory the pie came steaming hot with cheese still bubbling and the thick buttery crust layered all the way to the top of the pan.  An intoxicating aroma I had to bear in mind the temperature to make sure I didn't burn my mouth digging in.  Slicing the pizza with an enormous pizza cutter we were each plated a hefty slice and waters and teas were refilled.   Not quite as traditional as the standard sausage/cheese variety of deep dish, this glorious pile of cheese and veggies topped with a hearty tomato sauce was quite excellent with a great juxtaposition of buttery, creamy, savory, sweet, and crunchy.  While the sauce wasn't quite as impressive as Art's, the use of multiple cheeses added a lot of nuance to the dish and really set it apart from ""other"" Chicago Pizzas - the whole tomatoes and garlicky mushrooms were also excellent and I particularly loved the butter crust as it was crisp on bite but gave way to the teeth and nearly melted in the mouth.   While the menu stated a ""medium"" would be enough for 3, the heft of this pie made that a challenge that took some time to complete - with myself doing most of the legwork.   When the meal ended we were asked if we'd like dessert - and while I still do regret not experiencing the deep dish chocolate chip cookie, I had dinner plans with an old friend at North Pond later in the evening and didn't want to chance it.  All told really enjoyed Lou's and the price can't be beat - were it not for the beverages we'd have likely been out of there under $25 all inclusive.  While I must say I liked Art's Pizza better, the service and style at Malnati's was excellent and it'd be a great place to catch a game with friends.  A long walk back to Millennium Park interrupted by more shopping was a great way to close out the trip with my family and I'm glad we had a chance to try Lou's.  Gino's East or Uno is next.",0.9994,0.788,0.187,0.025,0.49544846050870145

What this means, is that I know my Lou's pizza.  I'm only going to talk about the pan pizza though there are some other worthwhile things on the menu. I'll also have to admit that Lou's wasn't always my favorite pan pizza.  The thing about Lou's pizza is that the crust is very crispy.  It took a while for me to warm up to it... hundreds of pizzas later :-)  I actually liked Due's pizza a little better for a while because of the crust.  Though many know that Uno's, Due's and Malnati's have the same bloodline.  Strange that someone might say that this isn't real pan pizza when this is actually the original Chicago pan pizza.  Thick dough never has and never will have anything to do with authentic Chicago-style pan pizza.  In fact, if you call it ""dough,"" whether you're talking about thin crust or pan, you're not talking about Chicago pizza.  In Chicago, it's called a ""crust;"" for good reason. What we're really talking about is crust that lines the bottom of and comes up the sides of a pan, filled with delicious toppings. One thing's for sure, whether this is your style of pizza or not, Malnati's is concerned about good pizza.  It's a heritage. TIP: Here's a tip that I know from serving hundreds of these pies.  If you call ahead, Lou's will pre-cook your pizza for you and take it out of the oven with 10 minutes to go so that it can be finished when you arrive.  The only way that this makes sense is if you call in 20 minutes before you get there.  That way, the pizza is already cooking but doesn't get pulled or if it does, doesn't get pulled for too long.  Otherwise, the pizza's just not the same.

I had to ask another waitress to get hot fries - which the manager actually brought us a new basket of hot fries.  After we finished eating we waited around 30 mins- we just wanted to pay the bill but no one was around to help. I literally walked around the restaurant hoping to get anyone's attention.

Now after all this, I was pretty upset - never had I had this poor service before and now they messed up on our bill? I asked to speak to a manager. The manager was extremely apologetic after I told him everything that had happened - and he offered to comp our bill.

Loved the fresh marinara sauce to pour on top, but the bread concoction itself could've used more flavoring to push it to be incredible.  - Gluten free option: they called out a crust-free option which is fantastic for those allergic to gluten (like me but it's mild so I eat small portions of bread products) - Soda glasses: biggest I've seen--might be big gulp size so no need for refills  Lowlights: - Eli's cheesecake: on the menu it said you could get slices to go, but they didn't have any on the dining in menu Overall pretty good but still on the lookout for what I consider the best.",0.9888,0.752,0.195,0.054,0.5398437500000001

The crust at Lou's is crispy, but it was thin and dense, rather than flaky, which is what I expect from butter in a dough.  I think the flavor would have been improved by more salt in the crust. I did, however,  like the golden brown cheese on my pizza.  Most pizza places don't cook their cheese long enough to form that crispy, chewy, caramelized grease, but Lou's gets it right. I liked the flavors of the Lou pizza toppings (spinach, mushrooms, onions, tomato), but didn't appreciate the Deluxe (sausage, bell peppers, onions) as much, since I like a stronger flavored sausage if I'm eating a sausage pizza. We also ordered the breaded zucchini appetizer.  It was probably the crispiest fried zucchini I've ever had, as it usually turns to mush within a few minutes of serving.  Lou's zucchini held its crispy, crunchy texture, and I appreciated that.  It was a bit salty, even for me, someone who often cooks her food with restaurant-style sodium levels.

Also tried their minestrone soup, which definitely tasted homemade, and their house salad, which came with a sweet balsamic vinagrette.",0.9894,0.751,0.249,0.0,0.542156862745098
2008-07-01,5.0,"I'm not one to give out 5-star ratings easily, but Lou Malnati's is definitely deserving.  Planning a trip to Chicago, I've realized that there is not one definitive ""Chicago deep dish"" pizza place.  Everyone you talk to has a different opinion, and every place has tons of reviews that say ""this place is good, but it's nothing compared to so-and-so"".  Ultimately, I figure you just have to keep coming back to Chicago and trying new places until you find the one for you. The atmosphere here is great.  It doesn't feel like some kind of patronizing, touristy, ""oh look how big our pizzas are!"" pizza place.  It is very down to earth, with a bustle of people eating delicious food.  The draught beer selection is pretty good too, and even appetizers are good!  The calamari was average, but the bruschetta was actually really good. As for the pizza, obviously you gotta go for the butter crust upgrade.  We ordered a large plain cheese, and a large deluxe (I think that's what it was called).  Normally, plain cheese pizzas bore me, but not this one.  Fantastic sauce and really good cheese.  I'm not sure if they use a blend of cheeses here or what, but it was outstanding, and was surprisingly not heavy or oily.  Despite being a butter crust, deep dish pie, this was one of the lighter tasting pizzas I've ever eaten.   The deluxe was excellent, though with so many vegetable toppings I couldn't taste the sauce or cheese as much.  Still, the vegetables tasted fresh and crisp, and the sausage had excellent bite to it.  Once again, despite being loaded with toppings, this pie was very light tasting and I swear to you there was not a speck of floating oil in sight and the crust didn't leave your hands covered in grease.  Amazing! Sadly, I do not live in Chicago so I may never return here again.  I must continue my deep dish tour and check out another place the next time I'm in town.  I will say though, that compared to Gino's, Lou Malnati's is far superior.  Gino's has a great feel to it, but the food just doesn't compare.  For those that are able to get to Lou Malnati's whenever they want, I can't stress enough how great it is. A side note: we were way too stuffed for dessert, but the deep dish chocolate chip cookie, and the deep dish peach cobbler both looked amazing.",0.9979,0.767,0.198,0.035,0.6196160484395776
2008-06-29,4.0,"Chun's Pizza Consumption Checklist... 1) Thin Crust - Check 2) Sicilian Squares - Check 3) Deep Dish - Check (Reviewing Now) 4) California Grilled Style - Yeah...  We'll wait on That One! 5) Old School Mainly Land Italian Pizza - Definitely Before I Die! It was by no coincidence that a patronage was paid to the fine establishment known as Lou Malnati's.  For starters, I am a New Yorker!  My experience with Pizza has solely been limited to that of Thin Crust and Sicilians.  The Deep Dish version of this delectable everyday eats, was one for which I have yet the pleasure of indulging.  That is, until I visited Lou's... The décor at Lou's is best described as Sports Bar meets Pizzeria.  The subtle and modest atmosphere, that's greatly complemented by the ensemble of autograph jerseys that engulfs the walls of this establishment, aides in its theme.  Various notables ranging from a Bobby Knight autographed Red Sweater to a signed Larry Bird Celtics Jersey are on full display.  Needless to say, the sports fan will find this establishment hard to turn up. On with the food... We opted to order the ""Deluxe"", which consisted of toppings ranging from Sausage, Mushrooms, Onions, and Green Peppers.  Let's not forget the butter crust!  It's a must have!  After placing our order, our server had to inform us that the wait time for this pizza was about 35 - 40 minutes.  Here's my ""polite response""... ""You're absolutely kidding... Right?""   Needless to say, I was hungry! Now this part is a bit fuzzy for me but she suggested we order an appetizer?  Two things come to mind... 1) Do I really need an appetizer if I'm going to eat Deep Dish? 2) Is she scamming us into spending more money while we wait!?!? Either way... We opted to order the Spinach Bread as my friend Brian had suggested this as being a ""must have"". Not to boast the server's diligence, but the spinach bread had a wait time of 15 minutes...  Great! Tick Tock...  Tick Tock...  Ding!  Spinach Bread! The Spinach Bread:  Two Words... ""Queso Grande"".  Don't let the name of the dish fool you.  Neither bread nor spinach are the hosts of this dish, it's the cheese!  Sure, the appetizer was coated with a  in thick piece of bread and strategically sprinkled spinach pieces (which were few and far between), but once you cut into the sucker, the mozzarella persistently flows with no end in sight.  The steam of mozzarella can engulf the entire serving plate if you allow it!  Let's focus on the taste...  Of course, anything with gluttonous amounts of cheese will taste good.  Just ask the Italians, they eat cheese straight up.  What I took from this dish was that despite the insurmountable amount of cheese used in the application, the balance in taste between all ingredients was well thought out.  Overall, despite the gluttonous amounts of cheese used, the application was highly preferred... Like clock work, Spinach Bread Down...  Here comes the Deluxe Deep Dish! Lou Malnati's Deluxe Deep Dish Pizza:  The presentation of the dish itself produced high praise and fright.  From the visual perception alone, the monstrosity that is to be my lunch overwhelmed any conscious dieting efforts.  For starters, the simple thickness of the Pizza resembled that of 5 thin crust slices stacked upon one another.  Still, despite my inherent dieting nature to turn away from such a decree, I indulged.  The taste...  Despite the burdensome corpulent nature of the Pizza, the balance (despite it's hearty portion) was exactly what was needed for such a ""casserole"" inspired application.  Digging into Lou Malnati's Deep Dish was comparable to that of eating a meatloaf with a butter crusted piece of bread on the bottle.  The overwhelming, but pleasantly, enjoyable, pizza was one in which the mightiest of eaters can only consume but so much of a good thing.  I opted to cop out @ 2  1/2 slices, my ordinary thin crust consumption would be the entire pie.  Much tasty, much preferred indeed! As if the Pizza wasn't enough...  Why not dessert? Chocolate Chip Pizza:  The individual sized dessert was coated with a bottom layer of a freshly baked chocolate chip cookie.  The dish was then topped with 2 quarts of ice cream, whipped cream, and cherries.  From my first visual gaze of this dessert, I was even more astonished at the fact that Chicagoans were able to create consumable monstrosity after consumable monstrosity.  The taste did not disappoint, although I found the dessert to be rather sweet, the cooling sensation generated from the ice cream gave the buttery chocolate chip cookie the right balanced needed for such a dessert.  The whipped cream added a nice touch of lighten sweetness to both the ice cream and cookie. With all things said and done, with all items consumed to our best efforts, the bill relinquished by the restaurant was a mere $43.00!  Yeah...  This Chicago ""discounted"" pricing scheme should be implemented by NY!",0.9965,0.859,0.107,0.034,0.5297673394426641

FOOD Don't get the appetizers.  Just go straight for the pizza.  Get the Lou (spinach, romano cheese, and other veggie stuff) which automatically comes with the butter crust or get the Sausage/Pepperoni with the butter crust.  The crust is soft and buttery (duh) and incredible.  The cheese is thick and perfect.  You will be in heaven (which may end up sooner than you wanted given how much your cholesterol is about to go up after eating one of these pies).

I made it back up to Chi-town for a 6-month internship last year and took everyone I knew to experience a lil Lou's.  Most of them absolutely loved it.  Those that didn't, weren't a huge fan of all the cheese.  But I mean, that is deep dish after all.  So I discredit their opinions, hehe. My family and I love the pizza so much that we frequent  loumalnatis.com  to overnight ship 4 pizzas to Florida at least 3 or 4 times a year.  The pizzas aren't AS GOOD as fresh out of THEIR oven, but they certainly are comparable. Mmm mm good. One negative in my opinion, I suppose, is that the pizza is topped with a ton of tomatoes/sauce and I'm not a big tomato girl, so I usually scrap half of them off to downplay the tomato-ness. I've never ordered anything but the pizza or the garlic/cheese bread (which isn't anything amazing, but still tasty), because honestly, it's all about the pizza. :)  Now go and get some!  And save me a slice! P.S. One thing to note is that if you go when it's busy, be expected to wait a while.  The great thing though, is that once you get your name on the list you can grab a menu and figure out what you want - and then you can put your order in with the host/hostess so you don't have to wait as long for your pizza once you're finally seated.  Great idea!",0.9906,0.772,0.174,0.054,0.5594278033794163

One thing he didn't know: I'm allergic to tomatoes (not resulting in death allergic reaction, luckily and I do like what I can't have).  Second thing he didn't know: I HATE Cheese.  Albeit, I did warn him I am a protein gal.  So I've been traveling via a flight that didn't serve or sell lunch, I was starving.  at Lou's I ended up with a really big, yet soggy and uneventful Cesar salad but a very tasty cup of chicken and veggie soup (with tomatoes, but who cares). Where am I getting at... The two large stuffed pizza looks absolutely soaked in grease and not edible unless I really want a heart attack before I'm 40 yrs young.  I did try one,  I scrapped off the nasty cheese and toppings, the crust ended up pretty good. Lack of choices didn't help. but I did find our waitress very friendly bringing me 12 sugars for my 32 oz of tea at every refill and the soup, crust on the pizza, plus the cookie pizza with ice cream were delish. After I get back to Cali, I need to detox from all the grease I've eaten and going to eat in chicago.",0.6116,0.832,0.097,0.071,0.5136621315192744

The signature ""Lou"" pizza with fresh spinach, mushrooms, tomatoes, and cheese sounded good but was actually a bit disappointing. Still, the restaurant deserves its five stars because of the pepperoni and sausage deep dish. Probably my favorite deep dish in the city (though Giordano's stuffed pie is my favorite pizza!).

I think the thin has decent crust, and cheese is a bit different (but in a good way), but if you aren't really really into meat (as in pork) I'd skip the sausage. They put on huge pieces of this. If you're looking for a good family place, try the one on the far north side, Lincolnwood. It's spacious and decorated with tons of interesting sports stuff, no lines.

I looked at a few places for my trip and settled on Lou Malnati's based on several reviews and ratings. They have several locations and I'm sure the quality and experience can vary, my choice was on Wells. I got a starter and a pizza. Spinach Bread I liked this dish for the contract in texture of the cornmeal crust and the spinach, cheese filling. It also came with a marinara sauce that's quality was so-so. Small pepperoni, sausage deep dish pizza with butter crust Where do I start with this one as there are several components to a pizza? I'll go outside to inside: The famous butter crust --- I was imaging something buttery as in light and airy and greasy. This was butter as in a dessert tart and hard. I was not a fan. The tomato sauce --- The use real tomatoes in the sauce and I liked that, but tomatoes have a high water content that ran into the pizza. Again, was not a fan of. Overall, I liked the quality of this component. The cheese --- A lot of it, but no different than any other pizza cheese. They just put a little more on it. The pepperoni --- I thought the quality was better than most pizzas, a little thicker. The sausage --- The second most disappointing part of the pizza next to the crust. Large chucks, but very bland. It needed fennel.  Overall, I think it's better than LA pizza, but not NY. NY pizza has a smoky flavor that develops in the cooking process that I dig. I wouldn't go to Chicago just for the pizza and it shouldn't be their claim to fame. I'll try a different spot next time I'm in town to make a better assessment of the city. I would still recommend this place for visitors.",0.9417,0.87,0.087,0.043,0.4395590828924162

2006-02-27,2.0,"if you don't hear from me for awhile, please check certain notorious alleyways in chicago.  i fear i may be in for a mob hit.  this pizza barely crosses the line into mediocrityville.  it would be decent if it weren't for the crust.  i even upgraded to the ""butter crust"" for an additional $0.75.  lifeless and banal, the dough reminded me of this one time when i was trying to adjust my rugby cleats and had to try and move this strange cardboard insert with my mouth as my hands were tied up with other parts of the shoe.    i am also reminded of high school when i made scones in my home economics class.  as i added this class late, i got paired with the resident beavis & butthead duo of two stoner metalheads('sup Mark and Ricky?!) with pencil-thin mustaches.  when these cats weren't preoccupied with trying to set the other's textbook on fire or boiling the toilet crystals or debating the merits of Judas Priest's first album, they often contributed to my earnest efforts by fiddling with the oven temperature and telling me i was a dumbass.  i'll leave it to you to decide who was the dumbass(es)(HINT: my SAT score: 1320).   i suspect some divine intervention, but we managed to crank out a batch of these scones and they tasted exactly like the raw ingredients that went in - flour, lard, baking soda, and salt.  ok, we added currants too but they are basically like retarded raisins and added almost nothing to the finished product.  anyway, this pizza tasted like those scones covered in a can of tomato sauce.  the chunks of sausage added some much needed cholesterol and zing.  i must give some credit to the delivery as everything i wanted was there and packaged very efficiently.  they even brought ice cream in it's own separate plastic UFO container for the peach cobbler.  in short, the pizza - not so much.",0.925,0.859,0.089,0.052,0.4111483516483516

2005-12-09,3.0,"Some of the better Chicago-style pizza I've had, but somewhat lacking on atmosphere.  I topped my pie with diced tomatoes, sausage, and garlic.  In retrospect, I should have left the garlic off - they took this addition very, very seriously.  Also, the sausage blanketed the entire pizza.  I don't think I had a single bite without a giant piece of sausage.  I may as well have ordered a pork chop on the side. The garlic bread appetizer was nothing to write home about - just cheap italian bread with butter and garlic powder. The highlight of the meal was the ""chocolate-chip pizza"" dessert - a small deep dish pizza pan used to bake a fresh chocolate-chip cookie, topped with ice cream.",0.7746,0.884,0.091,0.025,0.47326839826839834

2005-09-11,5.0,"Just about every Chicago pizzeria claims to have the best pizza of some sort (Pat's for thincrust, Gino's, Chicago, Giordano's for pan). It's subjective, but I give Lou's the edge. It also has the feel of being Chicago's oldest family run pizza restaurant, though this location ws only opened in 1986. While Lou Malnati (who died in 1978) did work in Chicago's first deep dish pizzeria in the 1940s, the first branch wasn't opened until 1971 in Lincolnwood.   With 21 branches now, it's still family run, and in 1995 they opened a West Side branch with all profits going back to the community for children's educational and recreational programs.
