2017-08-09,4.0,"Wings and beer. Pretty sure they are two of the most important food groups recommended by the ADA...no not the American Dietetic Association (apologies to the delectable Mrs Funk, Dietitian extraordinaire), but rather the American Drinking Association. Birds Nest is a fine neighborhood establishment nestled on a corner of shade trees and easy traffic. On this late July mid Saturday evening the large front window and side doors opened fully offering to bring the outside in and inside out. A lot of wood paneling, A LOT of TV's, so viewing can be had from any location and any angle, a somewhat clean and level pool table, and an easy and relaxed vibe. On to food. Wings Advertised as ""the best in Chicago"", we had to sample.  So 20 wings, 10 Signature hot and 10 Teriyaki. The best in Chicago? To we Funksters if these are the best in The Windy City, then Funkster logic dictates chicago has some mighty crappy wings. I mean they were good, but if these were the best in a city of 2.7 million people, and by extrapolation 10 million wing joints, then give me Buffalo! We added a very fine spinach salad to the mix of wings that was likely the highlight of the meal. At $12 maybe a bit overpriced but still delicious and enough for three of us to share! Add to this a fine beer selection and the evening was complete with one caveat. I do not understand why any establishment where conversation can be expected, plays music at ear bleeding levels?!?

It's $6 for 10 wings, IF you purchase a drink, the cheapest being a $2 PBR. That comes out to $8 for 10 wings, which isn't a good value considering the subpar quality of the wings. You must order in batches of 10 and can't mix and match flavors. I ordered 20 wings, so I could try the different sauces, and because I had heard the hype about this place and thought it'd be better. Turned out the chicken was tough and dry, the sauce was subpar, the skin was decently crispy, but that didn't redeem the tough meat. My server was nice though, but that's not really enough to make the experience any better. This could have been a fluke, but if so, then expect inconsistency. Came for the wing special, spent $20 for 20 wings. Overall not worth it, skip the trip and go to Dak. They have the best wings in town, and are a much better value.

2017-06-20,4.0,"Opening Liner: Quintessential dive bar but with the best wings in Chicago. Background: Came her with the BF on a Sunday night for some wings. It was during a ""big game"" - can't remember which one - so it was busy, busy, busy. We arrived and waited around for a table for 2 for a few minutes till we were able to score one, just long enough to order and pay for a beer. Vibe: You wont find a host here to help you locate a table, you are on your own. Patrons include dudes that like sports, dues that like wings, dudes that recently graduated college, dudes that recently scored an internship, dudes that some how wound up bringing their 'best girl' for some cheap eats. Food: nachos -- better than the ball park! (and that's a ringing endorsement!) I really, unfortunately, like concession style nachos and these are that but about 75% cheaper. House salad -- I KNOW it;s strange but I like salad with my nachos and buffalo wings... and it was actually a great salad. I would confidently order another salad here again! They are a decent size and very fresh. Wings -- it has been said that these wings are the only truly authentically made buffalo style wings in Chicago. I have never been to Buffalo NY to judge, but these wings are truly delicious Service: While you wont have help getting a table, once you have one, your server will be attentive and ready for whatever questions you have.

We sat down and saw that they had their $2 burger special, so we ordered a couple of those, wings (of course!), and stuffed mushrooms.  Our waitress was very kind and we were waited on promptly.  About 10-15 minutes after we placed our orders, our waitress came back and told us that the burger special only ran until 8. She apologized several times and was very nice about the whole situation, but I was disappointed because the time restriction wasn't disclosed anywhere on the small menu (but happy hour times WERE disclosed, 5-7 pm), the regular menu, or even on the board they have out front. We pointed this out, and the waitress said she told the cooks inside the same thing, but they wouldn't honor the price.  We ended up getting some more wings, and they were pretty good (hot BBQ), but the experience left a bad taste in my mouth. I really wish they could have honored the price or at least have it posted somewhere that the special ends at 8.  Aside from that, our waitress was great, our food came out hot, and we never had an empty drink.  I hope our experience will be better if we go again!",0.9887,0.747,0.196,0.057,0.5382772980987266

It was a beautiful evening and the place was lively but not crowded, both inside and out. We were a little confused upon entering so we just sat ourselves at one of the enclosed booths with a personal screen (score!). Shortly after, a waitress notices us and gives us menus. She was awesome throughout our time here. I am used to your standard lackluster service and food for most neighborhood bars, but I was pleasantly surprised at Bird's Nest. We ended up getting 50 wings - 30 hot, 10 teriyaki, 10 honey bbq. These were very solid. Texture was on point - slighty crispy outside and moist inside. While I'm accustomed to a traditional buffalo or super spicy wing flavor, theirs was unique and tasty with a nice tang to it. These were also much larger in size than most places, which was great. While my boo and I both thought we each easily devoured 20 wings (I'm convinced they gave us more), we were left with much more, which we gladly took home.  Overall, it was a perfect experience with food and service. Their other menu items looked good too. We wanted a casual satisfying meal and got just that. Again, service was great and we were in and out of there by half time, making it home just in time for the second half.

For 15 years I've only had their signature flavor and I ordered 50 of them. My friend ordered 10 of the hot variety. They looked great so I tried one and next time I'm ordering that flavor. They were even better than the award winner in my opinion. We only stayed 90 minutes and I of course took most of my wings home. The service as I mentioned was stellar and could not have been better considering the crowd. We may have stayed longer and had a few more beers but it was just too loud to enjoy good conversation.

2016-09-09,1.0,"I am 100% never going back to BN and here is why: 1) First Impression. I entered the restaurant around 7PM. It was already a clusterfuck as every patron that hadnt been seated yet were clogging up the entryway. What already gave me a bad feeling about the night was the bouncer who decided that I was going to be the only one of the loads of people at the door to get carded. I left my ID at home as I rarely carry it or a wallet because I hate feeling ""at risk"" walking around with a wallet in this city, so unless I specifically plan to go to for drinks or to a club, I dont bring it. Once I communicated this with the bouncer he very rudely told me I had to leave. I told him I had not planned on drinking, as I was only here to celebrate a birthday party. He said nope. Leave because theyre having alcohol. So I need an ID to eat chicken?! Tuh!! I said that had nothing to do with me. I walked out of the restaurant to find my friend who was waiting for the others to file in. Which leads me to the next red flag. 2) Leadership. I walked up to the birthday boy who was mid debaucle with the owner or manager who was upset that he had pulled several tables together. Okay, I understand this because half our party hadn't arrived yet. REGARDLESS OF HOW STRESSFUL YOUR 50CENT WING NIGHT IS, BEING ABRASIVE TO PATRONS IS NEVER THE ANSWER! Especially when said patron is about to bring you hundreds of dollars worth of business. Treat all of your customers with respect. There is a right and straight up wrong way to express your qualms with your customers. This isn't Dick's, so that owner/manager should have checked his attitude at the door. 3) Service. I don't know if they ran out of chicken and someone had to rush to pick some up or if they truly made every order from the time they received them, but methinks if you are used to Thursday nights being insanely busy, why not make batch upon batch upon batch upon batch of naked wings, and then toss them in the sauces as the orders file in. There was absolutely no excuse for every single person who ordered 10 or 20 wings have to wait half an hour plus to even get their food. The same can be said about basic things like napkins and water and towelettes. It was almost as if this was their first wing night because there were so many errors from their service end that I just couldnt wrap my head around. I had already had enough of BN from the moment I got there but when the wings finally came I knew then I wouldnt return. 4) Quality. These wings were not anything special. I dont know who dubbed these the best wings in Chicago which somehow creeped into the minds of the other reviewers who have left these five star reviews, but Ive had better wings at Buffalo Wild Wings. Sizes of the wings were good I admit, but those  sauces were decent at best and not a lot of variety. Definitely nothing special and certainly not good enough in any fashion to be dubbed ""the best."" Perhaps its because Im from the south and we definitely know how to do wings. Like, even the wings in Chinatown are better than these. 5) Service. Again. So after I waited 35 minutes for my 10 wings, and ate them (all the while underwhelmed and feeling petty because of the bouncer who tried to refuse my service), I noticed another member of staff yelling at my friends who were standing on the walkway to ""go back inside the cage"" (fenced patio). Again, there is a right and straight up wrong way to speak to paying customers. They are not animals! What truly baffled me was the fact that, despite having a large party, NONE of us were loud, yelling, drunkboots, toasting, WOOHOOing, etc. So I truly dont get why the staff at BN chose to be as hostile to us as they were. We were all very friendly customers. We weren't disrupting the other people on the patio, neither were we rude to our lackluster service-providing waitress (and lord knows I wanted to be). I just can't wrap my head around why the night went as rough as it did. The final straw that broke my back was when that bouncer with the Napoleon Complex came back outside and once again yelled at some of our party who were standing inside the patio. He literally said and I quote ""if you want to stay, sit down!"" Okay. We are not children. We do not need to be babysat. None of us are drunk and being crazy. THEN he saw me again and yelled at me and said ""YOU'RE THE ONE WITH NO ID! WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE?!"" At that moment all I saw was red flash before my eyes. It took everything not to take a big chunk of the leftover birthday cake and smush it into his face as I felt singled out. But i didnt. Because Im a classy person. I instead just decided to leave. I said my goodbyes enthusastic and confident that I would never again go back to this place.",0.9931,0.825,0.112,0.063,0.4526397042835399
2016-09-09,2.0,I was with a big group. So I get it they were probably a bit overwhelmed. But I would expect the staff to just roll with it and as we are paying customers. There were not enough seats so some of us were standing. We were trying to take pics and it wasn't like we were breaking stuff or throwing stuff at ppl and causing a disruption. But the bouncer guy came and yelled at us and told us to sit down. So those who didn't have seats ended up having to move to he sidewalk. We felt very un-welcomed. My drink took a super long time and the wings even longer. I was okay with that given the size of the group. Wings are pretty decent. 50 cents and they don't do less than 10.  To me great service is paramount to a good experience so I definitely will not be back and neither will I recommend this place to anyone due to our experience.,0.9256,0.843,0.117,0.039,0.4475925925925926

So our friend decided to meet there with a bunch of people to celebrate his birthday. Well, uh nice idea only perhaps next time we should've gone somewhere else that could host a big group of people for a birthday party. Honestly this place wasn't suited for us. We sat outside in the patio and it seems the owner or the manager didn't like we that our group was getting larger and larger. We ordered food and drinks and for the most part we were a polite group of customers. However, our group was massively big and some of us were sitting down some of us were standing up. Eventually a bouncer came to us and told us we need to sit down if were going to stay here. We were paying customers at the end of the day. A bunch of us left the area bc we paid and were ready to leave anyways. Enough said here the food was alright the service was decent. I won't be going back any time soon.

Wash it all down with an ice cold beverage of your choice, though I am partial to the PBR's here -- seriously, they must keep them at a top-secret extra-special temperature, because a PBR at the Nest is unlike a PBR you can find anywhere else.  Don't sleep on the other menu options either. Buffalo chicken is here and there throughout the menu and they do it in a number of different ways like salads, pizzas, wraps, and sandwiches. If you're extra hungry, go for the Drunken Buffalo Chicken Sandwich -- it's a beast.

As i walk in the front door, my first thought was ""This is where my grandfather must be hanging out drinking his Old Style and Milwaukee's Best before I see him stumbling home and crashing in his chair at 2am"". But I told myself im here for the wings. As I wait to my surprise 30 somethings kept rolling in. So I can accurately describe this place as an old man' s bar for 30 somethings. Now lets get to those wings! Massive sized wings with some of the tastiest sauce I have ever had. They were crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside then then tossed in their house made sauce. Folks that is a special sauce. A complex sauce with subtle notes of sweet, spicy and tangy. Buffalo wings are very common in Chicago so its hard for establishments to differentiate themselves from each other often replicating the same taste profile. For example many places just toss their wings in Franks Hot Sauce and out they go, which is not a bad thing. However since I am always looking for something different and unique these wings transported my taste buds into a happy world of deliciousness not experienced eating wings before. I must now proclaim Bird' Nest as having the best wings in Chicago. Yes I said it. Quite Incredible! The service was very good as I did not experience any of the service snaffus that are mentioned in the reviews. Our server, a short but cute girl was on top of our order the whole time and we really put her to work. Filling our drinks and waters, napkins, extra sauce...She earned her big ass tip!

Take-out is cash only and when I called the first time I was put on hold and forgotten about for five minutes, so I tried calling back only to have the exact same thing happen again. It took three calls for them to get my order, so I presumed they were busy. When I arrived to pick up my food there was a group of four playing pool and two tables with customers and five staff members at the bar - they weren't busy. All in all I would say ordering wings here isn't worth the trouble. Places like Crisp and Justin's both have great wings, take credit cards, and are typically much quicker and have much better service. Crisp even delivers. I would recommend them over Bird's Nest if you are a wing fanatic.",0.6814,0.822,0.105,0.073,0.3996031746031746

We've been the past two Sundays for their 45 cent wing special after 3 PM and holy cow....These are the best wings I've found in the city so far after trying about 15 other bars which claim they have some of the best. The sauce is really what makes them great. Get Birds Nest Hot, you will not be disappointed.  Another overlooked appetizer they offer... The Garlic or Cajun fries with Cheese. They were awesome! I could eat those every other day for the rest of my life and be satisfied!  The atmosphere is what you would expect out of a neighborhood bar and the staff is very friendly and helpful.  I haven't experienced it yet but it appears they may have live music here some times since they have a decent little sound system. That could be very interesting to check out if you're back in the area. The prices and daily specials seem fair compared to other bars in the area and really the Food gives this place the 5 star rating it deserves.

I ordered a chicken Caesar wrap (I know, who orders a wrap at a bar - but it was my trade off for the calories in the chili cheese fries). The wrap was mediocre and not much flavor. I did try some of my friend's wings and they were phenomenal. If I went back, it would have to be for the wings. They seemed like a fun place and the wings were good, but it was just really slow and a little bit dirty. We had nine people with us and all the tables were rickety to the point that if you leaned on them, someone was spilling a drink.

2014-07-12,1.0,"My family and I had a horrible experience at The Bird's Nest last night. We are all native to Chicago and love this city. In general Chicagoians are not people that would try to scam or screw over other people, especially their customers. Apparently, the manager and wait staff at this place are not above scamming their customers. My brothers and I were eating wings and playing pool with our mother. During this we ordered nachos and mozzarella sticks. It was $1.50 PBR night so we decided to get rounds of that for the night. The waitress we had visited our table rarely to check on us. The door guy had to bus our table and we started ordering from a different waitress. When we were ready to go, we had to wait 30 minutes to get the check and another waitress had to track down our waitress to get it. She came back with our bill and it was for $130! I know my brothers can drink beer but not that much. My mother and I had a combined total of 6 $1.50 PBRs. If you do the math our meal and drink total was nowhere near that much. We would have had to drink around 40 PBRs. This is when my brother asked the waitress to re-calculate the bill, because she was clearly trying to rip us off. She had this ashamed look on her face and went off to figure out how to do simple math. The manager came out and told us we owed $72 dollars, that was the re-calculated total. If that is true, where did a $130 come from? Thin air? Needless to say according to our total that was still 10 bucks to high, we settled on $60 and call it a night.  I've never been in a situation where I've to negotiate the tab. Usually it is all in the POS system (or should be).  Maybe they thought we were drunk because we laugh a lot together and cheer each other on in pool. That's just how my family is, we aren't wallflowers but by no means are we rude. Having a place that we would gather to watch the hawks or share a beer rip us off was really frustrating to say the least. That waitress should be fired for running a scam like that. It just makes your business look shady and most importantly drives away customers. We will never be back, even if your wings are good.",-0.2238,0.843,0.08,0.077,0.5318692564745195

2013-12-03,3.0,"After four months deployed, when my boyfriend finally came to visit me in Chicago, the first thing he wanted to eat was chicken wings.  Not getting to choose your own food in the military is rough.  A quick google search revealed that Birds Nest had the best wings in Chicago (according to the Tribune).  I was dubious, since I'd never heard of them, but Chicago is a big place and try as I might, I can't stay on top of EVERY food trend. We walked in the numbing cold from the Fullerton stop until we got to the Birds Nest, which was a total divey looking place and not what I was expecting at all!  Actually I think we were both pretty surprised to find that it really just looked like a college bar, nowhere that you'd think would have the best wings in Chicago.  But we had faith and took a seat at the bar, with eyes on the Bulls game and ears on the crazy loud drunk people sitting at the table behind us.   We got a house salad, which was absolutely massive and can easily be shared by two hungry people as a starter.  If you added chicken it'd be a main in its own right.  It was fine, pretty fresh actually for a bar salad.  Next was our basket of 10 chicken wings ($8) with the Bird's Nest Hot Sauce - basically just buffalo sauce.  They were big and tasty, with a tangy kick and lots of finger-licking sauce.  Can't say there was anything about them that made me think they were the best wings in the city, but as my boyfriend said, there's only so high you can go with chicken wings.  An upper limit, if you will.  Let's just say I wouldn't go out of my way for these, but they were very good. We also had the stuffed peppers appetizer which was just okay.  It really needed salt and some other seasoning.  One pepper was stuffed with ground beef and the other with turkey, but the overall effect was of general blandness.  Making stuffed peppers better than these would be a breeze. It's cheap, and the food is fine, but I certainly wouldn't go out of my way for any of it!  Service was also pretty poky and the place is certainly lacking in charm, even for a dive bar!",0.9958,0.802,0.163,0.035,0.5863376623376624

I should have asked him more questions though, because i took my wife here for dinner- big mistake. This is definitely not a date night place, it's more like a sports bar that happens to serve food; it's not a place most would go to just to eat. It'd be a great delivery place or for to-go orders, except it's 20 minutes from where I live. Firstly, neither of us are sports fans, and they have like 20 TV's and the commentary is blaring loud. The place was also packed and we almost couldn't sit down except we happened to catch one party leaving (their capacity limit is 120 people according to firer code and there was probably 100 people there on a Thursday night at 8:30) We just about left because  1. We couldn't find anywhere to sit.  2. It was too loud         3. The bartender said it would be half an hour for any food orders 4. No signal on our smartphones Why we stayed 1. We had already driven there, I wanted to try the food and at the last minute a party left so my wife and I took their spot. 2. I ordered a bloody mary while waiting for the food and it was perfect 3. Free wifi 4. The bartender (young guy, forgot his name) was really friendly and made the visit a lot more tolerable. 5. It only took 20 minutes for our food to artrive I had the standard hot wings. They were good but I was not blown away. The sauce was not acidic like some and had a buttery flavor I liked. I prefer my wings to be a bit crispier though. I also had onion rings. They were perfectly crispy and were probably the best I've ever had. My wife started with mozzarella sticks which she said tasted like homemade and were the best she's had in a while. She also had a sausage and pepp pizza which i stole a slice of and i was impressed because with the quality because pizza wasn't their specialty In summary, i this place wasx closer to me, I would definitely order delivery or to-go because their food was very impressive, but my wife and i don't plan on returning because the bar was too crowded and noisy, we might if they doubled their size and had a quiet half that was just to dine in.",0.9959,0.832,0.15,0.019,0.5433933933933934

The reason for 4 stars is when we walked in the small Hispanic waitress was kind of rude when i asked her about seating...ill give her a break since it was pretty busy...i was also over charged ...i ordered 2 pitchers, & he charged me for 3.... but i told him and he was apologetic and quick to correct & refund the incorrect amount ...took like 5 days to clear in my account but no biggie ...ill give him a break also since it was busy lol I would definitely come here again !

I met friends and family there for their wing special.  My brother in law got a table and we we lucky that the table next to us was getting ready to leave.  Since there were 6 in our party we moved the tables together.  The server got our drink orders and came back several times to see if we were ready to order.  Once we were set, we got wings and two baskets of fries. Over an hour and many minutes later, our food arrived.  Wtf.  The place was busy but not that crazy! The server came around and apologized that it was taking long after about an hour of waiting.  We asked if we could get the fries at least and she pretty much told us that we couldn't.  I'm not sure of her explanation since I was on the other side of the table. About 15-20 minutes later, our food arrived and she plopped them on the table without any word.   To my disappointment, they were warm.  Not piping hot like they were just made.  It seemed as if they had been sitting waiting to be dropped off to our table for a while.  Not sure if the server forgot to place our order or what but an explanation would have been appreciated well before we hit the hour mark.  The food was disappointing when in the past, it had been great. I was so tired that my friends paid for me and I left.  I found out the next day that the server only comped one pitcher of beer.  Yikes.  Not coming back for a long long time.  If ever.",0.9772,0.812,0.136,0.052,0.4173208923208923

Unfortunately, we visited this place back in March, so the details on who was there on that date can't easily be put together. Thankfully the owner did provide both his cell phone and email contact information if I wanted to provide more commentary.  In his message he assured me that such a night as we experienced that he, nor any of his regular staff or patrons were involved. My original review of one star stands until I can pay the Birds Nest another visit, which I will next time I am in the neighborhood.

2011-07-14,3.0,"Went on a Thursday night to try the wings. Now, mind you, I love buffalo wings. A lot. So I think I am a pretty good judge at this point. And these are good...not the best, but good.  We started off with their signature house hot sauce, which apparently is supposed to be their version of Buffalo style sauce. But do not expect Buffalo. There is a distinct difference between their sauce and true Buffalo sauce. Bird's Nest sauce is DUMPED on (it actually pools at the bottom of the basket) and is red, peppery, and a hot that tastes like a mild siracha. It is a good amount of heat, and the flavor isn't bad, in fact it is quite good. The wings are large with tender juicy meat. Just don't go in hoping to fill your craving for traditional Buffalo wings. The honey bbq was pretty good as well. The service was...meh. The waitress seemed really out of it and wasn't particularly friendly. But what really killed me were all the extra charges. First, I spilled my first beer because the table we were at (which had 3 chairs) was way too small for 3 people and was VERY wobbly. I am a short girl, and was attempting to scoot my tall ass bar chair in and ended up just barely knocking the table, which spilled my entirely full beer. I asked for another beer afterwards, to replace it, and ended up being charged for BOTH. Not really cool in my opinion, especially when it was their crappy table that led to the beer spill and not a drunken accident. We also were asked what side we wanted with our wings (ranch or blue cheese) and when we asked for both we were NOT told that it would cost us $2. We ended up spending $4 just on small containers of dressing! Oy.  Overall, decent wings, but not the best service.",0.9685,0.762,0.15,0.088,0.46355311355311357

She got mad at us for ordering our drinks at different times. At one point, she started to ignore us.  Something that is undeniable is the quality of their food. The wings are award winning, for real. They have bbq, buffalo, and hot. All three are highly recommended. Tip: Get the garlic fries. GET THE GARLIC FRIES. Get it...it tastes amazing.

We arrived a little before 6:30 on a Sunday night, and it wasn't too crowded, with plenty of tables in the back. We seated ourselves and found our own menus. We asked our waitress a few questions about the specials and the menu, which she knew a few of the answers to. We ordered drinks and waited. We needed refills and waited. Finally our waitress was ready to take our order, so we ordered an appetizer and each of us ordered an entree. And we waited. Forty five minutes later, she had only come to our table one time to apologize that the kitchen was backed up, which as former servers, we understood. When the food finally came, the appetizer was served at the same time as our meals, so when we complained that we did not want to pay for our appetizer, the manager came to find out the problem. He explained that if we had wanted our appetizer to come out first, we had to ask for it that way. Um, last time I checked, that's the definition of an appetizer. Literally, hors d'oeuvre means ""apart from the main work."" No real apology, just an explanation that we ordered incorrectly. One of us was given the wrong sandwich, so when the manager brought over a cup of buffalo sauce to turn the regular chicken breast into a buffalo chicken, he handed us the cup and awkwardly said that he had just licked his finger. I'm not quite sure why he told us that, we were all pretty disgusted. Once we got our food, it was decent, but cold enough that it seemed like it had been waiting in the back for awhile.

The reviews say the Thursday special was quarter wings but it's .35 cent wings now, with the purchase of a drink-all the specials are like that. A little sad for the GF because she didn't want to drink but she ordered a Blue Moon to get cheap wings. I ordered 10 Bird's nest hot sauce wings, and after perusing the menu got the Italian beef pizza. My girl ordered 10 Teriyaki and BBQ. The ranch was extra-nothing unusual and we got 4 ranch sauce cups, a misunderstanding but okay.  My wings were okay, not too spicy in the heat department but a pretty good flavor. The teriyaki wings were probably the best flavor of the three we got. The Italian beef pizza was okay, the beef was good but it could have used more hot giardineira. I can see the potential for it.  Our server was okay, friendly and pretty willing to guide us around the specials. She was a little on the slow side when it came to checking up on us. We were ready to go but had to wait an extra ten minutes or so for her to come by so we can get a check. They allowed a couple dogs inside, which I considered odd.

Ladies, if you're a douche and are seeking yuppie, lame, pretending to be drunk type of guys, this place might be your jackpot.  FOOD: DO NOT BE FOOLED ABOUT THE WINGS!!!! True, they were accredited for having the best wings in the city. Yeah, back in 2006 !!!!!! Gosh,  Bird's Nest, stop taking pride in something that no longer holds true. Worst wings that I've tasted in a while. Overcooked and average sauce served COLD. It was probably cold because it took the waitress an hour to bring it to our table even though there were only a few tables there that night. I once ordered just the garlic fries, and it took them one entire hour to bring it out. SERVICE: Slowest service ever. Waitress was non-attentive, and when we were done eating and ready to have the table cleared for beer and a good time, she was nowhere to be found. She didn't take anything off the table; I had to walk it over to the trash myself. I'll take my business somewhere else next time. When I asked to talk to the owner of the bar, the bartender pointed and directed me to him, but I saw him piss drunk from a distance, so I quickly came to realize why the place was such a shit hole and how I knew I wouldn't be visiting this place again. What a douchebag loser. He's old, fat, and looks like he's missing a chromosome....stay classy, bird's nest. MUSIC: Because the crowd is lame, the music is lame as well. They do have a pretty fancy jukebox though, but no one there ever knows what good songs to put on. Just that B-96 radio shit.  SANITION: Gross. Sticky foors towards the back room which by the way reminded me of a dungeon.  I give them one star for the guys with sleeves. One behind the bar, and one at the door. Shane, the bartender, was very upbeat and took great care of my friends and I. Cracked a joke every now and then...always looking to entertain.

Monday night isn't their wing special night but they do have 30 wings for $16, so 50 cent a wing isn't too bad.  Along with the wings we ordered garlic fries and artichoke dip.

We each finished a beer before the food came out, I wasn't watching the clock so I'm not sure how long that was. For our 30 wings - we got 20 with hot sauce and 10 with teriyaki, why we didn't get the award winning BBQ wings... I'm not sure.  The teriyaki was good but having more then one of them was just too much. The sauce for the teriyaki was just too sweet for my liking.

2008-06-16,4.0,"i see alot of bad reviews on here, and I'm not entirely sure why, every time i have gone here about 5 times, i have been pretty happy, i mostly go on weekdays from around 5 to 7 so there is no crowd, sometimes we are the only people in there, so there is no way the servers can screw that up.  I have received good service, not great not terrible but good enough for me to eat some wings drink a couple Guinness's and leave... Now a quick note on the bar selection, there is not much to choose from unless you like lite beer, they have all the bud and miller shit, but they don't really have any micro brews, i think they have fat tire but not sure, i always seem to just get a Guinness  The wings them self (the only thing i have gotten there) are great at least the hots, there are BBQ and terryaki (i can't spell) but i didn't dig either really the HOT is where its at, the wings are meaty and good size, way bigger than BWW, which is a joke, so if you want some good wings and are patient maybe this is the place for you",0.544,0.775,0.116,0.109,0.6664351851851851
2008-05-03,2.0,"There was a time when I would have given Bird's Nest 5 stars.  Not anymore. First I'll rate the bar.  I've only gone on Tuesdays, when their specials suck.  I don't like Miller anything.  Whatever, they don't get stars off for that.  The food's ok.  The garlic fries used to be wayyyy better.  The service used to be awesome, but it's also gone downhill. Now for the reason I used to show up on Tuesdays.  I am an open mic-er and this used to be my favorite.  Kane was so nice and really good at his job.  From what I can gather, I think his day job probably got to be too much to deal with, with the open mic also.  If you're reading this, Kane, I miss you!  The guy they got to replace you sucks!  I got up to perform, and during my songs I kept hearing weird noise that was not coming from me or my guitar.  When I finished my first song, I realized it was the music he was playing earlier!   He hadn't turned off the radio in the monitor!  C'mon, you've got one little job, and that's the sound.  Argh.  No thanks.

2008-03-18,2.0,"I was here a long time ago and came to listen to some live music and what else, but drink beer.  It was a friend of a coworker who sang some really great Howie Day cover songs and a U2 song per my request.  I really enjoyed it, and now having come back again my feelings are changed.  I guess it was the music that had me swaying to a different beat.  It's basically your small narrow Lincoln Park bar.  Every time I've been here it's not very crowded.  Maybe I'm just lucky or is here on some off nights, but we had the whole back to ourselves with the exception of a fantasy league that had some tables reserved.  We came because it was suggested that the wings here were good, but I beg to differ.  Actually it was agreed amongst a few of us that the wings are overcooked and slightly crispy.  I like things a little charred if they are on a grill, but this wasn't like that.  I apologize for inviting so many people out for not so great wings or experience having to wait so long to get our food.  I had been craving them all day and my coworkers were rubbing it in that they went to Hooters for lunch.  I was like, ""It's alright, I'm going out for wings for dinner tonight.""  (Plus, I had gone out for sushi and had like 20 pieces of it...) I tried all three wing flavors and liked the hot ones most compared to the bbq and teriyaki.  I think the teriyaki is supposed to be some version of an Asian marinade or sauce, but I'd say it's a no go for this spot or they need to change it up.  The fries were nice and crispy, but it's hard to mess that up.  The Tuesday night specials are the sloppy joes for $1 and $2.50 Miller Lites, but the joes weren't very flavorful or else I'm just used to the canned Manwiches.  They were supposed to have open mic night, and I didn't see that happening, not that I was looking to tell any jokes or anything.  I'm not sure if they were understaffed that night, but our food took especially long to come out given the amount of people at the bar.  There was only one waitress, and she did ok bringing things.  She didn't seem to talk much or seemed very friendly or happy though.",0.9964,0.815,0.159,0.026,0.5096096096096095

2008-03-11,4.0,"I thought about giving this place 3 stars, but then I recalled that I visited the Birds Nest in three successive weeks.  Any place that can be my destination of choice for 3 straight thursdays deserves a four star rating.   I've only been here on Thursday's ($6 Miller Lite pitchers, 25 cent wings), and I've never had anything other than those two items.  So a full review of the joint, this is not.  However I can inpart some knowledge on the limited realm within which I've explored. Wings: Good size (a dozen is plenty for a full-blooded male).  Get the hot sauce (just slightly hotter than BWW's ""medium"").  BBQ is sweet, Teriyaki not bad, a little sweet.  Hot is the way to go.  I'm currently on a Tour-de-Wings for Chicago, right now Birds Nest is at the top of the list. Beer: Just get the pitcher of Miller Lite.  It's a real-size pitcher, not the kind where half the beer is lost to that stupid ice holder. Service: sssssssslllllllooooooowwwwwww.  It will take an hour to get your wings, so take the edge off your hunger before you go out. Amenities:  Crowded on Thursdays, it's always a fight for a table but so far I've been able to elbow my way to a table by the time my wings have showed up.  It's true that if you get a table by the bathrooms you might get a bit of a show, but such is life.  Flat screens abound, a good place to watch sports as you make the long wait for those delicious wings.",0.9563,0.8,0.131,0.069,0.5679846938775511

2007-10-10,1.0,"Had probably the worst service experience that I'd ever had in Chicago.  It was two years ago now, so I don't remember all the details, but it mostly involved our waitress ""forgetting"" our simple order of chicken wings over and over again until it became apparent that she had turned this into some sort of passive-aggressive game and was probably not placing our order with the kitchen at all.  We were offered a couple of lame excuses, but the long and short of it was that we sat there for about 90 minutes and eventually wound up with about half our order.  Let me pause to remind you that all this place has to do is put some fucking chicken wings on the fryer, not cook up a souffle or something.  The worst part was that we were offered no apology whatsoever by management, no free drinks, no nothing.  I wasn't the one responsible for paying the tab, but if I had been, I'd have left a $20 bill on the table, walked out, and told them to call the cops on me if they wanted -- I'd sooner have spent the night in jail then to give them a dime of my money.",-0.9516,0.868,0.027,0.105,0.5043417366946779
