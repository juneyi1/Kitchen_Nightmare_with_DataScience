It arrived on time, hot and perfectly cooked.  The Rigatoni Procini was amazing. The sauce is almost like a vodka sauce but not quite. The mushrooms are plentiful, cooked well and so flavorful. I'd definitely recommend this dish. I filled up so much on the rigatoni I barely got to eat any pizza. However, what I did eat was fantastic! The pepperoni was fresh and bursting with flavor and the pizza was super cheesy. Definitely high up on my pizza list. Go here now!!!",0.9926,0.693,0.307,0.0,0.595952380952381

You see, the sauce is soooo important when it comes to stuffed pizza in order to balance out the mass amount of cheese. Again, these guys know how to make a pizza. The sauce tastes very fresh with just a hint of natural sweetness. I almost got a pasta marinara flavor from it with the consistently of a smooth pizza sauce. It wasn't overwhelming either. Just enough. As I mentioned in my previous review, they know how to balance the flavors and ingredients. The bottom of the pizza was still firm and crispy, where some other stuffed pizzas get way too soggy. Toward the end of the slice, I was able to pick it up and eat pretty easily. I gave JB's my stamp of approval for best stuffed pizza in Chicago, but this might be neck and neck now. I'll update again once I order their pan pizza.

I am writing this review because of an experience my wife and i had with ordering delivery this past week. We ordered 2 salads with grilled chicken and an antipasta because we had a guest at our home. We received 1 salad without the chicken and the antipasta. My wife placed the order and both myself and my buddy were standing next to her. I called to follow-up on the incorrect order.  I spoke with the same person that took the order. His name began with ""P"". He was nothing but combative claiming he repeated the order to my wife and the error was her fault. The call my wife made was on the speaker and at no time did ""P""e ask to confirm the order. I asked if he wouldn't mind having the owner call me ""A"", When ""A"" called back, he insisted his employee ""P"" verified the order. When my wife inquired if that was the case, how were 2 mistakes made, lacking 1 salad and no chicken""A"" hung up on my wife.  Now, I am not a business owner, but who hangs up on a customer. Not only was this extremely unprofessional, but it was rude and disrespectful to do this to a women, my wife that was being patient and respectful.

However, there was only one person doing take out at the register and waiting on all tables. A bunch of people had to wait to be serviced. It also took a long time to get our food. So, though he was working hard, everything was slow. Down to 3 stars. We had ordered a 1/2 order of pasta and the server brought out a full order by mistake. He said he would bring a 1/2 order but they would have to throw out the full order. So, we said we would take the full order so as not to waste the food and have to wait longer. We get the bill and we were charged for the full order. We brought up the issue, and were told because we said we would take the full order, we would be charged that way. As much as that can make sense, the restaurant made an error, and it would be reasonable for the restaurant to do the right thing and not up-charge on their error. I asked to speak with the manager, and apparently our server, Anthony, was the manager. I asked if they would reconsider given the error and miscommunication. And, point blank, he said no. This is not a disastrous error, and I also blame myself for not double checking we would be up-charged. However, customer experience was poor start to finish, yet had a chance to get some bonus points back, and instead it was a sour and salty finish. Error completely aside, I still do not see myself wanting to return or give my business moving forward.

Upon arrival at the time of reservation, I was apologetic to the desk/waiter since I originally reserved it through Groupon from party of 5 it balloon to 10.  The first thing the waiter who claimed to be the manager reaction was sarcastically emphasizing at my face that the policy of their Groupon is that all parties has to order an entree in order to get accommodated- the act is so bold that I felt so demeaned maybe he is thinking the group is there for the freebie from Groupon, I hope he didn't associate his emotion to us being Minority. His demeanor everytime he tries to tend to my table bears a repugnant attitude, very opposite to how he treats the rest of the remaining 5 tables since the place is very small. With any group that exceeds 5, the establishment has to practice courtesy of inquiring if there is a celebratory reason to that particular night- this place never bother to asked! The washroom is too small and at the back passing the whole kitchen- I wonder if it's to a City Code.

We also got the stuffed gnocchi with vodka sauce - little pillows of heaven. Ordered fried calamari for apps - fresh and tasty. Fresh crusty warm french bread when you sit to start. The service was spot on. Richard are waiter was knowledgeable of all the items on the menu and was so attentive to us. This was my 5th time here and it only keeps getting better.

Well tonight it was awful the bruschetta came smushed in the tin and the tomatoes were frozen. For the first time in 5 years I called and complained and asked for a credit. I was told by the ""owner"" that tomatoes are not in season and that he should have warned me the bruschetta would be bad and offered no credit and said next time he would throw in a slice of tiramisu! Well thanks but I think its only fair to credit me back for your crappy not in season bruschetta. Last time i ever order from them!",0.4161,0.709,0.163,0.128,0.5125170068027212

We shared calamari that was grilled and tender, I had the gnocchi and my date had the tortellini panna, which I sampled and thought was rich, tasty, and well-seasoned. We went there on Saturday 1/23/16 and had the pleasure of being taken care of by the male waiter, I think his name was Dee? He was very attentive, was very bubbly, fun, and polite. He helped make our night special and I'll definitely be back because of the staff and great food. The menu is extensive and you get the sense that the pastas are homemade.  As people have said before, the restaurant appears from the outside as being just a strip mall eatery but it is super cozy/romantic with just 5-6 tables, the lighting is low, and the ambiance is kept by candles and window drapes.

The atmosphere is very warm and welcoming-A great place to to dine with a loved one or a close friend, not so much for kids. I ordered the egg plant parmigiana and the egg plant Monte Carlo. What makes this place so awesome is that you have the option to have anything cooked the way you would prefer it, in this case the question I asked was if the eggplant had to be breaded or not, ( some places focus so much on the breading that at times there is barely any eggplant inside). So, I ordered them both, and both of them were sautéed which made them a little al dente, so if you prefer your eggplant to be a little softer you should definitely ask. Both dishes were delicious, but I preferred the eggplant parmigiana because it came what's a marinara sauce that softened it up a little and gave it great flavor!! The Monte Carlo was good because of the other vegetables, however, since it wasn't breaded it definitely needed a marinara or a different type of sauce to go with it. However both were really delicious and so fresh!! The waiter also made the evening very very nice.

He also brought over a sample for us to try. We ordered based on his recommendation which was a rigatoni / sausage / tomato cream sauce and I got the chicken parm with spaghetti. Both absolutely fantastic. They give bread as well but I felt that it had a freezer burn taste so I didn't eat much - however my husband loved it so not sure if it was just me or the bread?

The calamari had really good flavor, and was still hot when it arrived at our house! It wasn't overly chewy, but cooked just right. Not sure if i would order this again though, just because I really like fried calamari. - Rigatoni Boscaiola: this was SO good. Normally I'm not a huge Italian sausage fan (I don't really like spicy food), but this was so perfectly flavored! I would order this again and again. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.  - Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo: This was only okay, and the reason I'm only giving four stars. First of all, Alfredo isn't my favorite Italian sauce, so I might be a bit biased. I didn't think the sauce was very flavorful and there wasn't enough sauce for all the noodles. On that note, there was a ton of food! This entree was more than enough for two meals. I don't think I'd order this again. -  Homemade Tiramisu with Disaronno Amaretto: this was an interesting version of Tiramisu.

I called ahead to see if there would be a table open, and when we arrived, we were pleasantly surprised to see that the manager had put a Reserved sign on the best seat in the house, just for us! There were only 6 tables in the restaurant, and it was cozy and romantic, just like we had hoped for. The food overall was very good - calamari fritti to die for. I have only had better calamari in Boston in the North End - so that's saying something. The only thing that turned me off about this place was that the meal I ordered (Pumpkin Ravioli) came out completely cold. It had obviously been previously frozen, and there were chunks of frozen pumpkin left in my dish. This was quickly remedied, but it did take away some of the restaurant's charm.

Last time, they sent spaghetti in meat sauce, and I am a vegetarian so had to throw it out. Another time, the pizza was messed up. Today (the last straw) it was no side salad. When I mentioned it to the delivery man he said to ""call the restaurant"". When it took just shy of 2 hours for delivery in the first place, I decided I'm not willing to wait another 2 hours, and that they instead will lose my patronship in the future.  Quite a shame!

My husband and I had previously ordered food and had it delivered via GrubHub. It was ok, not great, but since sometimes takeout doesn't do a restaurant justice, I wanted to try dine in. We made a reservation for 8:30 and arrived five minutes early. The restaurant has a cozy footprint - 6 tables in the main dining area and one directly in front of the entrance. If you're not already a regular, caveat emptor! The waitstaff seemed too busy chatting with each other and other tables to greet us. All of the tables were occupied, and I get it, you want to take care of your regulars, and sometimes people need to wait - but there's a right way and a wrong way to deal with waiting customers. Ignoring them for 10 minutes, then being unapologetic/openly rude and complaining to other tables is the wrong way. I love Italian food and live close by - the makings of a regular.

This time, the mussels were slight suspect and the flavor of the sauce was not even close to what it used to be. The smoked salmon pasta which never had much salmon to begin with had practically none. My go to pasta dish with sausage was a not nearly as good as it use to be.

2013-05-21,5.0,"I do a lot of home cooking and I feel that I'm pretty conservative with my ratings.  For something to get five stars, it has to be truly fantastic.  Rarely, will I give out high praise unless it is worthwhile.  I have to say that I was wowed by my dinner at La Gondola.  Totally unexpected, considering the location in a strip mall.   The start was so-so.  I had the grilled octopus appetizer.  It was OK.  Not bad, not great.  Could have been better, could have been worse.  The octopus itself was decent, but the artichokes were really good as was the red bell pepper.  I'm glad I tried it, but might try something different the next time.  The spinach egg drop soup was fantastic.  A tad over salted, but not enough to ruin the bowl.  I took a chance on it and I'm glad I did.  Very, very good soup.  For my main meal, I went with the Ciappino (fish stew).  I've never had such fresh, great tasting shell fish in a restaurant.  Honestly.  I've eaten at Shaw's, Joe's, GT F&O etc and have have ordered many seafood dishes at Italian restaurants.  No rubber taste, no frozen taste, not overcooked.  The shrimp were fresh and awesome.  The clams, mussels, and calamari were very good as well.  Perfectly cooked.  Couldn't have been better.  Of the two sauces, I chose the spicy tomato.  Fantastic.  The accompanying garlic bread was great to dip into the sauce.  I've had maybe five truly memorable restaurant meals in my 38 years.  This was, to my unexpected surprise, one of them. My wife had the gnocchi made on premise.  She found her plate to be very well prepared and would definitely order it again.  She's the type that when she finds something she likes, she'll order it over and over again.  I like to try different dishes at every visit.  Regardless, we look forward to our next visit to La Gondolla. Some other points....we went on a Tuesday night...no wait despite the small size of the restaurant (8 or 9 tables?).  Ashland location.  Nice, helpful wait staff (Richard, I believe).  As for the five stars, you could knock off half a star due to the appetizer, but it wouldn't be worth it.  It was a great meal.",0.9978,0.678,0.246,0.075,0.6121527777777779

I went gluten-free recently and you connived me into eating bread, you sneaky restaurant, you. 2) Your atmosphere. I love not having to shout my dinner conversation over fourteen semi-inebriated people within super close proximity to me- a grand total of about six tables, so definitely plan a reservation if you're planning to dine here. 3) Everything is fresh and flavorful. I have never returned a dish (and I both dined in and ordered delivery from here multiple times). The last time we went, the steak pizzaiola was quite bland, but the steak was still cooked to perfection, so we went with it. I cannot complain about a single other dish I've ever had here.  4) Their grilled calamari is in a section all its own. Huge, succulent pieces of squid grilled with red peppers and artichoke hearts and served on a bed of greens with a lemon all dolled up in its own skirt. HEAVEN.

In the old days when tomatoes tastes like tomatoes and you could go to a movie with out having to get out a credit card and La Gondola only had the one location on Ashland I would say my rating would of been higher. Unfortunately since their expansion it seems both locations have declined a bit in quality. It's not the big things Gondola falters at its more the little things, like over dressing salads, having to wait for bread, a little chaotic service, the hostess who seems kinda lost, the server that is running and seems rushed. I am not sure but all of this might stem from the pot smoke left in the air from the days when Joey's Brick House was located in this same space, everyone always seemed stoned at at Joeys.  We usually get the Rigatoni Boscaiola  it is very good and according to the server the most popular dish, the portions is very big and can easily feed 2 plus you get a salad so if you don't mid sharing you can get out pretty cheap. As far as casual Italian places go Gondola is pretty good and has all the classic dishes and most are good. The tiny Ashland location has a better atmosphere then Belmont  in my opinion. Ashland has a warm, quaint, quiet atmosphere with Italian music playing in the background Belmont is big kinda like a warehouse not much personality other then a few pics on the wall it's very loud and some nights they have live music that would be better off dead. Some musicians are better seen not heard, and that's all I have to say about that.

2012-10-15,4.0,"I didn't know about this place until my girlfriend and I were feeling extremely lazy on Saturday night. We ordered the Chicken Vesuvio & Chicken Parmiginia through their website and followed up with a phone call to confirm (I always recommend doing this if you order online). The site said we'd get an instant 20% off since it was our first order, but it really meant we get a $7 couple (20% of our bill) for next time. We needed some wine so I ordered for carry out and picked it up about 40 minutes later. I laughed when I realized it's in the strip mall, but was quite impressed by the cute little dining room. Every table was full and my food was ready. $37 for both entrees and a coke. I've ready some folks complaining about prices and portions sizes on here. And I couldn't disagree more. The entrees both came with soup and the Minestrone was great! They also packed us a loaf of bread which was good for sopping up sauce. The chicken parmigiana was delicious and huge. Girlfriend's Chicken Vesuvio smelled great and came with three big pieces of chicken, great roasted potatoes and a side of broccoli. I'll easily get two meals out of mine and she'll get three. You might be able to get cheaper prices at other places, but not with free soup, good food and portions like what we got. I will be back for sure.

Finally, the service...meh.  She got her job done, but nothing more and had a complete lack of friendliness.        For the most part, as long as you stay away from the seafood (although their signature calamari appetizers are still good), their food is good.  But the only way it's worth the price is if you use a Groupon or a  restaurant.com  certificate...and even then, I'd just say you're getting your money's worth.",0.9043,0.853,0.097,0.05,0.43799999999999994

2012-09-11,5.0,"La Gondola may have grown to a larger location on Belmont but I still love the original small store front located on Ashland Avenue.  Why do you ask?  Because it has the old world charm of a tiny restaurant you might find on the streets of Italy and that keeps me coming back here.  I have tried the larger location but I want the small charm of this location.  Thanks go out to the owner for keeping this location open because it is delicious. The reason I am re-reviewing for a third time is that we had Dan as our waiter.  Hopefully D will not read this because I do not want him to think we are cheating on him.  Dan works here on Monday and Tuesday and he rocked the 5 tables he had in here.  He has to do everything...clean the tables, get water, seat people, make drinks, deliver food, listen to my stories that take 20 minutes, help people with carryout orders, hand out take out menus, wrap leftovers...honestly I am tired watching him run like crazy. And Dan did all of this and still had a smile on his face.  This is what the service industry is.  Dan you made our meal really good with your incredible service. I was really impressed with Dan when I heard the bell ding in the kitchen...Dan was stuck at a table, where the two young ladies could not decide on what to get...they had been looking at the menu for about 15 minutes.  I looked at my lovely wife and said, ""That ding means our dinner is ready!'  We watched Dan wiggle his way out of the conversation to run and get our dinner...he did it tactfully. Before I knew it our piping hot food was sitting on our table! Let's talk about the food.  It is so good here.  We had the homemade minestrone soup which is out of this world.  We had the salad with the homemade creamy garlic dressing...it is one of those dressing that you want to drink it is that good.  We then moved on to a Lasagna with meat sauce and Dan twisted my arm towards the Carbonara.  Dan said, ""We are putting even more bacon in there then usual, if that will help in your decision!""  Okay we have a winner...who doesn't like bacon.  Also the bacon that they put in here has an amazing smokey flavor which takes this dish to a new level.  It is one of my favorite carbonara dishes outside of Italy.  The chef does a great job preparing it. This place is an old favorite and I am happy to re-review it for a third time.  For those who are reading one of my reviews for the first time...if you are going to this location always and I mean always call for a reservation.  There are only 6 tables here.  It is small and you have only one waiter....so if you do come have a little patience and enjoy the show.  Secondly, the food is really really good and the portions are huge...so expect to have leftovers for lunch tomorrow or breakfast if you want to start your day out like that.

Pizza bread was just a soggy mess. In retrospect it would probably be better in the restaurant but as a delivery item it was unsuccessful. I got the eggplant parm. Not bad, just mediocre and lacking salt. I did like the salad dressing for my side salad (creamy garlic).   The really bad was my poor husband's fettuccine alfredo. You know how it's usually creamy? Upon opening the dish, I didn't even see any sauce. And then I saw... Well. It looked like the sauce broke (if you cook, you know what this means). Instead of a rich creamy sauce, we got white clumps and oil. It was awful. And that's not something that happens because it sits for a while, so I can't blame the delivery. It would have looked like that when they boxed it up. Can't believe we paid for that. I have had better alfredo at Olive Garden, and that's saying a lot. What Italian restaurant can't deliver a standard alfredo? I'll give another star for large portions. Too bad it wasn't good. Very disappointing.",-0.9688,0.703,0.117,0.181,0.5714761904761905

2012-07-27,5.0,"Oh hi, it's me again.  Reviewing La Gondola.  Again.   And what can I say?  It's still damn good. We stopped in for our 7PM reservations and were seated in the same exact corner table I sat in with my mom almost two years ago.  And were served by the same exact waiter, whose name is 'D' and not Dean (woopsie!), that served my mom and I two years ago.  D looked at me and actually remembered who I was, remembered that I had sat at the table, remembered that my mom was there, etc., as if I had just been there recently.  Was it true... was I unknowingly sleepwalking to La Gondola and engorging on their dreamy Italian cuisine?!  Based on my record of Yelp check-ins and my credit card statements, no; it turns out, the last time I visited this location was back in August 2010 (I have been to the Belmont one in that time).  I'm easy on the eyes, and guess it's not easy forgetting this pretty face ;) We started with a bottle of cab and a loaf of their crusty bread.  I have no idea how they get the bread so crusty on the outside and so soft on the inside.  I remember when my parents used to chastise me for filling up on bread at dinner.  They'd be like ""Damian, you are going to spoil your appetite and waste your food.  Money doesn't grow on trees ya know?!""  Well, money does grow on money trees, but you can't pay for a meal at La Gondola with it, but the bread is an integral part of the meal that goes great with oil, parmesan, or as a scoop for all the sauce on your plate.  It may as well be crack because I am completely hooked.   For dinner, my date had the crab stuffed gnoochi, while I opted for old trusty, the chicken parmigiana.  I have been to La Gondola enough to know where to get the best bang for my taste buds, and the best bang for my buck, and the chicken parmigiana wins both categories.  Two juicy breasts of breaded chicken, penne al dente, and deliciously sweet marinara sauce - yum yum give me some.  My eyes always say ""eat the whole plate,"" but my off-the-gym-wagon self says ""save the rest for lunch tomorrow...you'll thank me later.""  D let us know that some people came in recently and ordered the dish with arrabiata sauce and it's definitely on my list to try next time. Unfortunately, there is never any room for dessert, but there is always room for limoncello and chatter.  D came over and chatted with our table, talking with us a whole range of topics from life, his origins in the UK, the food, the two restaurants, and, most importantly, the cackly loud girl and her equally loud mother at the table in front!  I think we must have spent 15 minutes or so just chatting it up, and I think the other tables did the same.  I can see why so many reviews love D and I am confident it's a huge part of the reason people keep coming back for more.   A couple more shots of limoncello did us in and we rolled out the door, tasty Italian leftovers in tow.  I love the personal feel I get at La Gondola and feel like they really value their customers and have great pride in the food they serve.  If I were ever to open a restaurant, I would want it to be exactly the same way.",0.9984,0.813,0.165,0.021,0.4386494252873564

2012-07-24,4.0,"This review was very close to being 1 star. Why? Because they weren't going to honor my La Gondola Ashland Gift Card with my Groupon. The only reason I give 4 stars is because server Dan stepped up, made an executive decision, and accepted it. So, I propose he gets a raise or a promotion because, besides the good food, he is the only reason I will now return and recommend this restaurant to other people. I've had the pleasure of sampling La Gondola's food at a number of Yelp events, so I was super excited when I actually won a La Gondola Gift Card at one of the events I attended. I couldn't wait to use it, but I live in the suburbs and just never really found the time. A while back, a $30 La Gondola Groupon was featured and I snatched it up. I now had a $25 Gift Card and a $30 Groupon. This was perfect for a dinner for two and I treated my man to Italian dinner for date night. The only problem was that I made the reservations, we showed up and I informed them of the Groupon (as you should) and then inquired about the amount on my Gift Card. At this point, server Dan tells me they cannot accept both. I'm shocked. Now, I wasn't trying to pull one over on La Gondola. I made sure to read both my Groupon and the Gift Card beforehand. The Groupon fine print was ""Limit 1 per table. Reservation required. Dine-in only. Promotional value can't be combined with other offers"" (check, check, check, check). I met all the criteria. The fine print for the Gift Card was something along the lines of ""Can't be redeemed for cash. Valid at LG Ashland. Treat this card as cash."" So, technically, my Gift Card was cash and not another offer, right? I checked in with both 4square and Yelp and unlocked deals, but I didn't even bother trying to redeem those because I knew quite well they were considered other promotions, deals or offers. However, the back of this Gift Card said ""Treat this card as cash,"" and I felt La Gondola was telling me that this ""cash"" wasn't welcome here. It really put a damper on things. Having only brought a little extra cash to cover drinks and the tip, we found we'd only be able to each order an entree and tip our server since they would only accept the $30 Groupon which was expiring soon. It also meant I had this $25 Gift Card that I wasn't feeling too inclined to even bother coming back to use because of their refusal to accept it as cash when it specifically said to use it as such. We ordered waters and entrees and sat in sad silence. I had the sense to ask about both forms of payment before we ordered our meals, but another couple there waited until the bill came and were equally as surprised that they wouldn't accept the Gift Card. At this point, it was pretty apparent they had two disappointed tables. So, server Dan took this into consideration and made the decision to accept both forms of payment. We happily ordered desserts and tipped 30%. I apologize for the long review and should mention what we ordered. My BF had a chicken dish which was quite delicious. I ordered a customer favorite, the lobster ravioli, and was very happy with my decision. We also ordered the cannoli and tiramisu. Both were good, but the tiramisu was the best. The portions were big and we both had leftovers of our main meal. I would happily return to order any of these choices or something new, and I will return because of Dan. I highly recommend La Gondola for a date night. I highly recommend you make reservations, because the building is small. I hope you get Dan as your server, because he is awesome.

2012-05-07,3.0,"Ooooooooh man.  I wish I could give this place a higher rating - but I can't.  I made a res at La Gondola via Open Table for 7:00pm on a Friday night. At 6:00pm I got a call from the host asking to push the res to 7:30pm, and I wasn't terribly enthusiastic about doing that but I wasn't given much of a choice. We arrived at La Gondola at 7:30pm and we weren't seated until 7:45. La Gondola was lucky I wasn't in Hungry Hungry Hippo mode, otherwise I would have been very cranky.  We ordered some wine to start with - and then didn't see our waiter for about 15 minutes. Eventually our waiter showed up again and we ordered our meals. We started with Fritto di Calamari, and my husband ordered the Rigatoni Boscaiola and I ordered the Stuffed Gnocchi.  The Fritto di Calamari (fried calamari) was very good. It was fried to the perfect tenderness, there were no chewy squiddies here! We then waited 20 minutes after we finished the calamari for the soup/salad that came with our meal. I got the minestrone soup, which was fantastic. It was very well done and filled with beans, pasta and delicious veggies. My husband got the salad which he enjoyed as well.  We then waited around 15 minutes for our entrees. The stuffed gnocchi in marinara was very good - it was stuffed with ricotta and it was super pillowy. The marinara was tangy and salty. My husbands dish, the Rigatoni Boscaiola, was rigatoni in a creamy tomato sauce with sausage. It was also VERY tasty. Both entrees were huge - we were only able to finish about half. Lots o' leftovers! Our wine was comped due to the res pushing, which was nice...but that doesn't make up for the fact that we were supposed to be seated at 7:00pm and ended up leaving dinner at 9:20pm. The food was good, but the service desperately needs work.  Part of the issue is it's a very tiny restaurant and they only have a few tables so if one res shows up late, every other res gets pushed back. They also do an enormous amount of carryout and they just can't seem to keep up with the carryout orders and the dine-in orders. The people next to us received frozen entrees TWICE - which is totally unacceptable.  I don't know that I would come back.

2012-04-10,1.0,"My recent visit to the Ashland LaGondola restaurant was a disaster. I had been to this location on previous occasions and liked the food. So I was pleased to invite a friend and colleague to have dinner with me here for an early Saturday evening. However, the list of ways in which our server ignored, minimized, and downright insulted us is almost too long to catalog. And unfortunately, management fully cooperated in our poor experience. First, a bullet list,  and then details--yes, it was bad enough to warrant spending time to write it all out. * Suggesting we were early for our reservation time and then repeatedly arguing with us about the ""real"" time of our reservation * Telling us they were not ready to serve at 4:30 and we'd have to wait, even though they had accepted our 4:30 pm reservation * Long wait for BYOB bottle-opening service - then ignoring us thereafter * Insinuating we should be charged for our wine because it looked like one of theirs--when he had not even waited on us yet * Forcing us, while we waited for service, to listen to his loud swearing and inappropriate conversation with a fellow retailer who'd come in  * A completely out-of-line $15 corkage fee on our tab * Patronizing explanation of menu items  * Telling us--as he served our 5-year-old her pasta--the restaurant is not child-friendly * Ignoring the two women at the only other occupied table who called out for attention several times to no avail * Aggressively demanding to know why our meals were simply ""fine"" and not better  * Having the manager call, pretend to offer a discount, and then fail to follow through It began with the reservation. We were told the only available time on Saturday was 4:30, which was fine with us. When I called that day to say we might be a little late, the manager said he didn't know if that was alright or not. He'd have to ""check with D, because he is very particular."" I said, who is D? He said your server. I wondered what kind of server had so much power, even though I'd assured the manager we would still gladly vacate the table by the required 6 pm.  When we arrived, exactly on time for our 4:30 reservation, we were told in a frankly snotty way that we were not only early but ""27 minutes early"" for our reservation. We were shocked both at this ""news"" and at the way it was delivered. The person at the desk, who we later discovered was D, our server, acted as if our conduct was so unacceptable that he might not even seat us at all. Seeing that the dining room was empty at that moment, being threatened with no service seemed totally out of line. Some minutes after they grudgingly seated us, all the while saying we were going to have to wait because they simply weren't ready, our server finally came over and, rather truculently looking me in the eye, said I left you a voice message. Didn't you get it? I said, No, I didn't get any message. I called you, he said, and told you we had a 5 pm reservation you could take instead. I called you yesterday and left that message. I said, well, I may have already left my house and I didn't get it. He continued insisting. You can imagine the tone this set for our visit. But despite many chances to redeem himself and his restaurant, D continued to make it worse. We waited another some minutes, and when he finally came over to our table, he eyed our bottle of champagne (it's BYOB which was one of its selling points to me) and declared he thought this must be one of theirs--and he should therefore charge us for it. And my jaw dropped to my knees when I got home and read that we'd been charged an outrageous corkage fee of $15.  Also when I got home I checked my messages and found one from the restaurant saying they now had a 5 pm reservation available if we'd like, but if they didn't hear from us they'd keep the 4:30 time. Ahem. Almost immediately after I found that message the phone rang. It was Corey, the restaurant manager who, after having read the note I wrote on our bill about our poor service, called to ask what I meant. After listening to a few of our dissatisfactions, he agreed we did, indeed, seem to have had a bad experience and began to offer me a discount for delivery--or, of course, on my next visit, if I still cared to enter the place. I asked how much was he talking about, and suddenly he explained that it was very loud there and he'd have to call me back. Ten days later I still had heard nothing. Prejudice against all-female dining parties? Prejudice against having to wait on a child? Or a case of a guy who feels he must put others down so that he can be right?  Who cares? There's nothing that can excuse that kind of unprofessional, low-class behavior to customers. The okay salad and dressing, the massive portion of plain garlic-oil spaghetti, and the pretty-good crab-stuffed gnocchi could never make up for the horror of that service. I will, of course, never patronize the restaurant again. And I urge fellow Yelp readers to take heed..",-0.991,0.852,0.052,0.096,0.4910225442834139

2012-02-28,4.0,"I would have totally given La Gondola a 5 star rating if it wasn't for the fact that I ordered 2 salads and didn't receive any dressing. They did everything else right though: delivery was fast, presentation was nice for take-out, food was hot and fresh.  I ordered the antipasto salad, caprese salad, chicken parm sandwich, and pizza garlic bread. I had a discount and was apparently starving! It was one of the quickest deliveries I had gotten in a while and all the food was still hot. The first thing I tried was the antipasto salad and half of the chicken parm. The salad was beautiful, but the salami they used had a weird taste to it. I picked it out and kept the rest of the meat and cheese. I'm happy I had my own dressings at home because if I didn't it might have been world war 3. The best part of it was the chicken parm. It was fresh and tasty, loaded with melted cheese and tomato sauce. It easily lasted me 3 meals. The next day I tried the pizza garlic bread and caprese salad. I was a bit disappointed with the caprese. I wish there was more mozzarella and that they used cherry tomatoes or vine ripened ones instead of those big cheap ones. I also wish there was more Kalamata olives in each salad. The pizza garlic bread was nothing too special, just garlic bread with tomato sauce and a dusting of parmesan.

Their extra-thin crust pizza has a great sauce, crunchy cracker crust and the sausage is awesome! Their shrimp pizza was also a favorite of mine as well.  This was my go-to spot - and it's been hard to find a replacement in the west burbs. We weren't as fond of their deep-dish, because that crust was a bit dry and bland, but I'm not a deep-dish guy anyway. My wife really enjoyed their other dishes as well, like the Eggplant Parmesan.

Dizzy, I fortunately found myself at La Gondola (who has not seem them at a Yelp event!). It was about six and I took up a table by the door. What you should know about La Gondola on Ashland is that 1) it is very small 2) MAKE reservations!  Since I was very lucky I was the only one in the restaurant without a reservation. I ordered veal parmesan and out came bread and olive oil. Yes, bread to break my fast and it was a mighty magical bread and I refrained from engulfing the entire loaf since the hunger was getting the better of me. After this some minestrone came out and I returned an empty bowl. Next came a giant stack of veal parmesan but I could not finish all of that food. It was delicious because it was crunchy and the cheese and the sauce all blended in to make me want to Pac Man everything. I refrained, and for that I was rewarded with leftovers. 99.99% of the time I refuse to eat out by myself, but in the 00.01% chance that I am starving and willing to eat by myself, there could be no better place than LA GONDOLA!",0.9071,0.814,0.113,0.073,0.6809375

Food: The pasta here is repeatedly amazing!  Serving size is a little large which makes for great leftovers at work.  Of course after all the pastas I have tried here I always come back for their signature dish Rigatoni Boscaiola.  I absolutely LOVE this dish.  The pizza is wonderful too and I have yet to try any of their specialty dinners. Drinks: Tiny drink selection but for the size of the place it's perfect.  For me, as long as their is somewhat of a decent wine selection I'm good to go.   Service: Carryout service has always been fantastic but for our first sit down experience, couldn't ask for better service.  She was friendly, fun and prompt.  Kinda can't deliver bad service in such a tiny little place unless the kitchen messes up. Overall: For great Italian food, this place is perfect.  A little tiny and a lot of carryout traffic makes it not one of the more intimate Italian restaurants though it is cozy and the food is outstanding.  I will continue to do carryout and will come back and eat at this little restaurant again.",0.9954,0.772,0.217,0.012,0.5301485551485552
2011-12-12,5.0,"La Gondola; Perfect for what it is and doesn't try to be something it's not.  This is an extremely cozy ""strip mall"" restaurant that will leave you quite surprised.  It's true that there are only 6 or 7 tables inside, so reservations are almost always required. They use Opentable, which likely causes some issues for ""walk-ins"" having to wait due to needing to respect the pending reservations. You can of course also call ahead before you leave home, and have a table ready when you arrive. I've never waited more than 10 minutes here; even on a weekend. Im surprised by the other reviewers who were angry that there was a wait, on a weekend, in a place with 7 tables..... The Food: Incredible and affordable. This is really really good Italian food without trying to be too pretentious or ""silly-fancy"". You aren't ordering Primi, Secondo, Contorni, and Digestivi. This is American-Italian. You get your appetizer, wine, entrée, and if you have room desert. But the options are numerous and wonderful. I haven't had a dish I wasn't impressed by.  Most recently I had the Pesce Risotto, as I was craving seafood. This risotto was CHOCK full of huge mussels, clams, squid, baby grilled octopi, huge shrimp, and probably other yummy things I missed. Huge portion and wonderful. I couldn't believe how much seafood was in this risotto; simply abundant.  You will have a hard time ordering wrong here. Service: It's true; we have ""our' waiter: D. So I may be slightly biased, but that being said, how does an ordinary waiter end up becoming ""your waiter""?  By being extraordinary. The second time we came here, D remembered us from our previous visit a few weeks back, and welcomed us as friends. I was astounded that he remembered our previous visit, and was quite impressed. Since then, D has learned our names and welcomes us back warmly each time we visit. Nice friendly chats at the table, coupled with wonderful menu suggestions and wine pairings; one of the best server's I have ever encountered.  Service is at a more leisurely pace in this restaurant. They aren't trying to turn tables and aren't trying to ""get you in to get you out"". Of course, in a restaurant of 7 tables, its easy to catch your server's eye if you need something. They let you take your time to enjoy your meal; the timing is wonderful. Things do sometimes get busy; but if you are in a rush and let your server know, they will accommodate you to ensure you get everything you need to get to that movie on time! Take out: Again, very impressive. I just wish I lived closer! Food is wrapped up nicely, and you get lots of bread and everything you would enjoy as if you were dining in. I think the majority of their business is take-away; and they do it well.  Overall, I recommend La Gondola highly, and for a modest price you can enjoy a wonderful meal and evening out.",0.9986,0.769,0.203,0.028,0.6260655737704918

2011-10-01,3.0,"Dine-In Service: 2.5 Delivery Service: 4  Food: 4 Oy! Another place that I'd rather get delivery from rather than dining in. The place is really intimate (meaning there's like 5 tables in there) which is fine but my gripe with this place is the service when you dine in. The food on the other hand is a completely different ballgame and they boast some of the best thin crust pizza in Chicago. I can't even count how many times I've ordered from this place. I bought a groupon because hell, it's one of my favorite places, but the one stipulation was that you had to dine in. We had dined in at their Belmont location but wanted to check out the original. And although, I don't really care for the service at the Belmont location, the Ashland location even lacks more in the service department. So you ask: what was the problem? Let's start off with the server/hostess, she sat us down but failed to bring over menus so we had to wait 10-15 mins before we were even able to peruse the menu. In fact, we had to flag down the busgirl to bring us menus because our server kept disappearing. In addition, it took us quite some time to even get water. Don't get me wrong, the server was very nice, I just think she was a bit flustered during that night's service. There is one thing I can't stand and it's when my servers are flustered; the energy just kind of rubs off on you. I know the place is small but maybe that's a good thing because I don't think they could handle the traffic. The expediting of our food was even worst. We ordered the Baked Spaghetti and a Pizza. My spaghetti came out a good 15 minutes before the Pizza so my poor BF was starving (sure he had some spaghetti, but he really wanted his pizza). I felt so bad for him, he pretty much lost his appetite waiting for his pizza while I was munching on my meal. At the same time, I was eating a super-snail speed because I didn't want him to have to eat by himself. I, literally, ate one noodle at a time so that I wouldn't get stuffed before he got his pizza. The server kept saying that the pizza was going to come out in 5 minutes. Expediting food was definitely a problem there because the party next to us had the same thing happen to them. The poor guy had to wait for his fish while his whole party had received their food.  For the most part their food is amazing if you stick to pasta and pizza. I don't care much for their other entrees (e.g., chicken dishes, appetizers). Although all their appetizers are homemade, I find many of them lacking, especially their fried zucchini which has a sandpaper-like breading. It was so dry I wanted to dip it in water to reconstitute the breading. The exception is their Octopus appetizer which is amazing and a great meal in itself. I had their mixed seafood entree the first time and found the same issue with the breading. So perhaps, avoid all breaded items here? Their Stuffed Gnocchi with Pesto is a must have. It's light and fluffy--just pure decadence. They have it available as a side so if you're not willing to commit to the whole shebang, get a taste at the very least. Their baked spaghetti is awesome. Their meat sauce is delicious. The biggest standout, however, is their Pizza! Try the Gondola Special or the BBQ chicken. Their pepperoni is also no fail!",0.9315,0.774,0.122,0.105,0.5665188834154349

Their ravioli is huge and filling in the best of ways. My favorite was the cheese ravioli.   So glad we found this place...and that they deliver!",0.9923,0.685,0.284,0.032,0.6472222222222223
2011-08-12,4.0,"Wow, I totally thought I had written one already for La Gondola...We came here about 6 months ago? Anyways, the food was surprisingly good for being hidden in the plaza next to Jewel. It was super tiny, about the size of a bakery shop. Maybe can only fit 20 people tops in there. Anyways, we were on a double date with my good friend and her hubby and wanted to try a new Italian place. When we finally found it, I walked in and the host was a bit upset that I had given them a wrong number to call since we were running late past the reservation and he was trying to reach me. He showed me the number he had and I have no idea where that came from. My account on OpenTable has my correct cell number. Aside from that, the food itself was surprisingly awesome and very satisfying. We started with some apps - calamari and some breaded ravioli. Delish! We barely had room for our entrees though since they were so big. My hubby had the rigatoni bolognese (or the equivalent) and he ate the whole thing! plus soaking up the sauce with bread later. I actually can't remember what I ordered, maybe the linguine with clams. It was good too. My friend had the rigatoni vodka and she made cooing noises when she ate it. her hubby had some medallions of veal. He enjoyed it but thought the portions were small. I tried the mushrooms from his plate and the sauce was really tasty. We ended with sharing a tiramisu. It was just ok.

I was surprised by how small it was, but I found it really charming and cute. I guess because it was so late, they had quite a few tables open.  As far as the food goes, I loved it all. From the bread to the lobster ravioli to the tiramisu, it was all perfect. The price was reasonable in my opinion, considering I had lunch and dessert for the next day for about about $30.

Our server, D, was awesome.  He had a great knowledge of the menu and made sure everything about our meal was going smoothly.  When he said, ""are you ready for a lot of food,"" I thought he was just schmoozing.  He was right!  The two of us ended up with at least a pound of pasta each! The food itself was good.  It is the typical italian-american fare.  I had enough for 2 meals afterwards.

La Gondola has quickly become our favorite casual Italian restaurant. Great service, outstanding food (especially the pasta), very reasonable prices, and CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP bottles of wine. A superb value. We went back last night and again had a wonderful meal. Our favorite server Dee was there. We started off with a bottle of wine, but couldn't remember which one we liked on our last visit. Dee said no problem, and not only described every bottle they had on the list, he brought over four bottles he thought we would like and poured us a tasting of each! The table next to us was so jealous they asked him to pour them a tasting too! Our favorite was the Valpolicella and it was only $25...on top of that it wasn't even the cheapest bottle on the list! The pasta here is soo delicious. I highly recommend the stuff gnocchi, lasagna, Rigatoni Boscaiola (fabulous creamy tomato sauce with Italian sausage and mushrooms), and my personal favorite is the Eggplant Monte Carlo...a huge mound of lightly breaded eggplant in a wonderful white wine sauce with mushrooms and topped with melted parmesan.  We were so stuffed at the end of our meal and still had tons leftover to take home.  If you haven't tried La Gondola and you like authentic Italian food, this is a must try it.

2011-06-16,1.0,"Located in a strip mall, the restaurant itself holds no more than 6 tables.  It's about a 20ft by 20ft box of a restaurant, the kitchen looked larger than the dining area.  We had a party of 5 without a reservation and felt lucky they had an open table large enough to accommodate us; we fit snugly. I wouldn't exactly call it an intimate or romantic restaurant either.  The strip mall exterior killed that thought.  I felt a little claustrophobic and a little like an eavesdropper too. There was NO privacy from the conversations at neighboring tables. I was surprised that the wine list was as limited as it was for an Italian restaurant.  My Dad and I read each others minds, we both asked if they had Lambrusco...which they didn't.  The didn't even have Chianti.  I just stuck with water, and I'm glad I did because my brother ordered a soda.  It came in a can for $2.50.  For that kind of money we could have walked over to the Jewel-Osco and bought a 12-pack.  This kid drinks soda like water and the point of ordering soda for him is to be able to get free refills.   The menu prices are what they would be in a classy Italian restaurant, $15-20 per entree.  But ambiance is not up to par with that kind of price tag.   After a week in Mexico indulging on buffets of food, my stomach could only handle soup and salad.  There were two soup options, both vegetarian, minestrone and egg drop spinach.  I went with egg drop because I've had minestrone before and thought it'd be nice to try something different.  Huge disappointment, it was basically Chinese egg drop soup with cook spinach in it.  It lacked any kind of flavor or spice.  Even though I'm not a sausage person, I found myself wishing there had been some spicy Italian sausage in it to give it something more or even a spicy tomato broth could have been better.  I had the La Gondola salad; romaine, Gorgonzola cheese, endive, tomatoes and kalamata olives, tossed in their house dressing.  It was okay. The rest of my crew ordered a mix of meat Tortellini, Mostaccioli w/meat sauce and Lasagna.  The portions were big but the general consensus was mediocre at best.  The tortellini received the comment, ""It was okay, but I've had better frozen tortellini.""  The mostaccioli comments were, ""The noodles were really skinny and the sauce was nothing special.  For $12, I expected something more authentic.""  The lasagna, ""It's good"", which was accompanied with a shrug.  I tried the lasagna and I didn't think anything much of it, pretty plain.  No one finished their entrees.  Our server lacked the service attitude and had an even less engaging personality and I felt we were ignored most of the time we were there.  She came only to take our order and give us our bill, the water server did most of the maintenance on our table. When we were finished, we sat around for about 10 minutes before we were attended to for to-go containers.  The bill took another 10 minutes to round up.  In the meantime everyone did a round on the restroom facilities.  I don't know which is the biggest turn off, that the bathrooms are located through the kitchen or that they are no bigger than a small closet.  The guys said the men's bathroom was no bigger than the little table we sat at.  You could wash your hands while seated on the toilet.   I would never go there knowing what I know now.",0.9055,0.876,0.074,0.05,0.5241803278688524

I found this restaurant to be very romantic once inside, the lighting is dim, the service speed timed just right, the byob allows your hard earned dollars to go towards food rather then wine, the check always comes with a delicious lemon cello shot:). The food is outstanding, we have had a wide arrange of everything on the menu and it is all always very good.  Their dishes are traditionaly italian american, meaning large sizes, extra cheese and rich sauces - yummy! The service is the best we have had here in Chicago.  We always get Dee at this location a friendly guy from the UK who has a great balance of getting to know you without joining the date.  He has even snuck us in when we didn't have reservations and when we walk in he knows what we ordered last time our names.  I think they have some sort of system but whatever - it makes me feel special. The only bad is that sometimes the tables are so close you feel like you have to monitor your conversation a little bit or listen to theirs.  Also, the one time we didn't get Dee we got this kind of coarse Polish woman who wasn't friendly at all and let us order a salad even though one ended up coming with both our meals.

2011-04-30,1.0,"Food wise, I think this place is not too bad. But attitude of the server is horrendous. In fact, it's the worst service that we've come across.  We were 2 couples. We ordered between us, a lobster ravioli, shrimp Diavolo Linguini, a coke with lemon and a La Gondola Special pizza. We also had a voucher that gives us a free appetizer. We showed our waiter via the phone and he asked suspiciously (in a British accent which we thought was inspired by the Royal Wedding held the day before; no offence to British yelpers, just felt this guy was being someone he wasn't), ""Is that for la gondola?"" Hello! We're showing it to you right in your face! You're looking at it, can't you read??? Subsequently he said (very reluctantly), ""well, I guess so then."" After a while, he came back with the appetizer of calamari. That was pretty good. The calamari was very well done. Tender and full of flavour. Oh, by the way, the starter bread was great too. Crispy on the outside and yet so soft and fluffy on the inside.  Thereafter, our pasta of lobster ravioli and shrimp diavolo linguini were served. Next up was the pizza. We haven't gotten that glass of coke!  So we asked him and he merely went, ""oh is it? I'll get it for you."" The Lobster Ravioli was amazing. The meat filing was delicious. The cream was thick and yummy. The Shrimp Diavolo was equally heavenly. The spiciness of the sauce was just right - enough to give you the ""kick"" but not enough to kill you with each mouthful. The shrimp was cooked to perfection; crunchy, juicy and tender all at the same time.  It was a great idea that we got a cream pasta and a tomato base one else we might not have enjoyed it that well.  The pizza was ok; nothing special. We only managed to finish half of that 12"" pizza.  After, we ordered a tiramisu that wasn't fantastic either. Normal.  Through it all, guess what? Our server did not bring us our soup!  So we asked him at the end and he merely replied, ""oh really? I didn't... I can give it to you now if you want.""  We said no because we were done our meal, the soup was supposed to have come at the start!  ""I could let you pack it away..."" We didn't want to because we had a performance to catch thereafter.  ""Well, then, if that's the case..."" And he spun on his heels and walked off.  We were stunned. We were hoping for some discount or something for your oversight and nothing? Actually, we wouldn't have minded not having a discount if he had apologized sincerely/was nice to us about the whole issue! Ultimately, we gave only 10% as tip although we were tempted not to give at all because that guy really didn't deserve it.  You can come here for the pasta but don't expect even an acceptable level of service. I'd have given them 3 or 4 stars if not for our server. EDIT: Just to clarify, the pasta is really good. But I believe dining experience should encompass not only the quality of food but also at minimum, a friendly, sincere service. If server(s) treat me differently from the other customers in the restaurant and make me feel as if I'm being despised and not welcomed, then, as I mentioned to Glittershoe, even if food is of Michelin standard, I would not dine there. Another thing to mention was that after we disagreed with him regarding the bill, he actually went off and sent someone else in his place to let us sign the check. I felt that was very rude. 2nd EDIT: Glittershoe has told me that he is a British (thanks Glittershoe.), so my bad for picking on that. But that's not the main issue, the major thing was that he asked rhetorical questions (""Oh, is it?"" ""Oh, really?"") in response to our questions for our missing food items without a single hint of apology.",0.9916,0.828,0.114,0.058,0.482295386904762

They have a strong, if not minimal, wine selection - just enough to offer variety, without the wine list being overwhelming.  Dee is very knowledgeable about vino and is always happy to make recommendations based on your taste.  Once you've settled on the imbibements, prepare for the most arduous task of the experience - deciding which tasty morsels to indulge in that evening.    The grilled calamari is divine, undoubtedly my favorite starter.  Things become a bit more complex when we start looking at entrées - the pastas, the eggplant, the chicken, the veal - all amazing!  Since my good friend Gina introduced me to La Gondola almost ten years ago, I have never, NEVER, had a bad dish.  That being said, very few thing are more comforting than a big ol' plate of chicken parmigiana.  And when I say big, that may be an understatement.  Perhaps whopping would be a better way to describe La Gondola's ample plates of lovin'.

And you can't beat the deals that are offered to friends of LG on facebook!  For instance, this weekend if you ordered before 6pm for take-out or delivery, the entree's were buy-one-get-one free!  My deal was even better.  LG had guess the score contests last year when the Hawks were in the playoffs, and I won 3 gift cards. Our order: Ceasar salad - Good, a little different in that it had tomatoes and cucumbers also. Baked spaghetti w/meat sauce - very good.  Melted cheese on top with a rich satisfying meat sauce.  Day old spaghetti is even better and I can't wait to eat the leftovers! Calmari stuffed with bread crumbs, garlic, and butter - This was so ggod!  The calmari was not tough or rubbery, and the filling was rich and buttery.  The filling reminded me of the topping on shrimp de jonghe.   A special thanks to LG.  I was looking at an old menu that had this dish when I phoned in my order.  They made it, no questions asked, even though it's not on the current menu!  I just hope I can get it again!

First of all, it is tiny in here: only about 7-8 tables.  Luckily, we scored a tiny two-top right by the door.  SO many people came in and out of here, presumably to pick up food, and it was a little chilly.  But the delicious wine, warm and crusty bread, and pleasant Italian music made me feel all cozy and at-home. My boyfriend ordered the rigatoni with sausage, mushrooms, and sage, and it was AMAAAZING.  One of the best pasta dishes we've had.  I ordered the rigatoni vodka with peas, and it had a semi-strange smoky flavor.  I'm not quite sure why it was smoky; I still ate a lot of it, but I wouldn't order it again.   After dinner was over, our waiter asked us if we wanted dessert.  We declined because we were so full, but he came out with three shots of limoncello for all three of us to take together!  Such a welcome surprise.   We enjoyed our experience so much that we decided this would be one of the regular places we go to.  La Gondola is a perfect little strip-mall gem.",0.9869,0.842,0.152,0.006,0.5906064306064306
2011-02-26,3.0,"Dined here Wednesday evening for the first time. Had heard good things about it when it was in its old location in the strip mall on Ashland. First impressions. The room is wide open, and was certainly crowded and bustling. Upon entering we were seated right away. Overall, its quite dark, which I usually like, but this was borderline cant read the menu dark. Maybe could use another candle or two at the table. Waiter was a very pleasant gentleman from Italy! The accent was authentic and he was competent, friendly and seemed to know his stuff.  We ordered the grilled portabello appetizer. Its two large portabello caps smothered in what I believe to be a wine, garlic type sauce with a roasted red pepper garnish. It arrived very hot, seeming freshly prepared. First impression was that it was a bit saucy. Presentation was not what I was expecting, but in the end, taste won out. Very tasty. We split an order of the 50/50 ravioli, meaning half meat and half cheese. It arrived at the table very hot. Overall it was good. Sauce was a red meat sauce, relatively fine, not coarse. Pasta tasted fresh and the ricotta cheese was fresh as well.  Honestly, I am a big bread fan, and theirs did not dissapoint. Super fresh, right out of the oven hot, wonderful crispy outer shell and soft, puffy interior. The olive oil and grated parmesan were a very nice complement to it. Total tab around $34 or so with tip. No alcohol, as they are still waiting for the liquor license.  A 3 star review from me is a solid review for a solid dining experience. With a bit more flair, or creativity food wise, and maybe a slightly brighter environment to enjoy it in would probably push this to a 4 star review.

The wife and I decided to get delivery from these guys for the NFC Championship game; as we were planning to just be lazy and watch football all day, we got a couple of different things to nosh on throughout. First up was some chicken tenders; I realize ordering fried items for delivery rarely goes well, but Jesus did these fall short of the mark. It kind of looked like powdered cat turds in an aluminum bowl. Tiny, little-finger-sized bits of chicken covered in a very grainy/powdery spice/breading mix. We didn't eat much of these. Next was a half-cheese/half-sausage thin crust pizza. It was... just below average. The crust was slightly stale-tasting, with a very dull crunch. The cheese and sauce were thinly spread out, and the sausage, while plentiful, was pretty bland. There was just nothing memorable about it at all, just pure fuel. We ended up tossing about a third of it, which is VERY rare for us. Lastly, the wife wanted a pasta dish to take for lunch on Monday, so we also got the vodka rigatoni. This was pretty good; their take includes peas, which neither of us are fans of, but the portion was huge, the sauce tasty, and the pasta cooked right. Overall, though, we won't be ordering again.

Grease is good, I'm a fan of grease, but honestly, I don't find their pizza to have any taste but grease.  The amount of salt and red pepper I have to add to actually feel like I'm not inhaling pure fat is astronomical.  The last and final time I tried pizza from here, I made the mistake of including ricotta, which to my surprise, practically replaced tomato sauce as  a sheet under the mozzarella.  Every bite literally sent ricotta gushing through the spaces between my teeth - I could only eat two squares of a medium pizza, and trust me, I've killed my fair share of medium size pizzas in one sitting before. I ordered the thin crust - boyfriend and I weighed it, because honestly, it was the heaviest thin crust pizza I've ever held - weighed five pounds.  I kid you not. The pasta also was not the best I've ever had by a long shot.

What an awful experience!  I am NEVER one to get upset with places over poor quality food or service, but since this was the ABSOLUTE worst experience ever, I felt it was my duty as a Chicagoan to sign up for Yelp, and be sure to let everyone know about this place.   I have read the reviews about La Gondola a few times, and decided to finally give it a shot.  After all, they did just open a new location on Belmont which is steps from my front door.  After calling the Belmont location 3 times to place a carry out order, no one ever picked up.  We then proceeded to order delivery from their other location and were quoted 45 minutes to an hour.  Yes, this did seem a little long for a Monday night  at 630, but we were excited to finally try this place.  By the time 8 pm rolled around, and still no delivery guy at the house, we called to check in.  They claimed the order was on its way.  Well they could have fooled me, because another 30 minutes later, we finally heard our buzzer with the delightful delivery man.  Needless to say, after 2 hours from placing our order, the pizza was barely warm, the cheese had hardened and grease pockets sat on top of the pizza, and the one thing I was most excited for (grilled calamari) was cold.  Had the whole meal been warm, it still would not have met my standards of good.  The problem could have been solved, if they had employees who actually answered the phone at Belmont, but unfortunately La Gondola had one downfall after another.  Not to mention, the customer service at their Ashland location was heinous.

Within moments of the food arriving I realized that we had upon us the best meal of the entire last week.  And with each dish, it was better and better. Highly recommend the apppetizer or entree pizzas.  Ours was wonderful (Margherita) with a terrific rich Basil flavor.  The girls loved their salad and Minestrone soup----my spinach and egg drop was the best I have ever had.  I would drive back here just for that soup. The Rigatoni Puttanesca was amazing----the best we have ever sampled although it was a little lacking of artichokes.  Yet the flavor more than made up for it.   The Rigatoni with Vodka sauce was also terrific---only second to the sauce I make at home according to the judge. My gnocchi with homemade pesto sauce was the absolute best I have ever had, both in form of the gnocchi and the pesto.  I even dreamt of it last night it was so good, and left a note on the leftover in the fridge that it was not for general consumption.  It was amazing. Portions are HUGE----you will take much home with you.   Service is excellent and more than attentive without being over the top. I would never venture in without a reservation-----they are  opentable.com  friendly.   Although they are not close to home, I have no problem driving past Taylor street and Pilsen to come back here and have some of the best Italian food I have ever had the pleasure of sampling.  Try it and you'll be hooked too! My only complaint is that you do not have a location in Tinley Park, IL!",0.9969,0.791,0.174,0.035,0.4612014991181658

But the filling for the lobster ravioli was downright disappointing. I did not taste the lobster at all. I probably shouldn't have expected full chunks of lobster tumbling out of the ravioli but I certainly wasn't expecting a filling that largely resembled and tasted like turkey stuffing.

2010-12-23,3.0,"First off, let me preface this review by saying that the pasta was fantastic (earning them 3 stars instead of 1). The stuffed gnocchi and gnocchi piemontese were delicious, and clearly home made. We will go back (although probably to the larger Belmont location) for the quality of the food alone. I do have to say that the service can only be described as terrible. Gordon Ramsey needs to come into this place and open up a can of front-of-the-house whoop ass. When we first arrived on a snowy Monday night (we had a reservation at 6:30, and were right on time), no one greeted us when we came in the door. There were 3 women behind the host counter and not one of them said hello or even looked in our direction! Seriously? That is unacceptable. I have worked in many restaurants, and it is front-of-the-house 101 to greet customers and let them know you will be right with them. My partner and I literally stared at the women for 5 minutes before one of them said, ""Did someone help you?"" Um, no. She then asked us to wait at an open two-top table by the door because the people at our reserved table were not finished yet. Yes, I said an open table. She did not even ask us if we wanted to dine at that open table by the door. She could have at least offered us the choice. About 10 minutes later, we were seated at ""our"" table, which was a nice table in the back corner. The rest of the service can be summed up by the words ""painfully slow."" We were there for more than 2 1/2 hours and we didn't even have dessert! When the check came, my partner said, ""Please give them your credit card now, or we'll be here until after they've closed."" And the waitress never once apologized for the delay with any of our food. Again, front-of-the-house 101 people. People understand that things go wrong in a restaurant, but a server should at least approach the table and say, ""We're sorry for the delay. Our kitchen is slammed right now. Can I bring you some more bread or anything else right now? This is not difficult. It is unbelievable to me that staff are not trained to do these things.

2010-11-14,4.0,"Food:  4 Service:  5 Atmosphere:  4 Value:  4 Between the hundreds of great reviews, proximity to my apartment, and of course, the groupon, there was no way I was going to miss out on this restaurant.  I'm always looking for upscale food without the upscale attitude, and this romantic, 6-table hidden gem nestled in a quaint shopping center on Ashland Avenue provided a quality dining experience.   My wife and I had reservations for a Wednesday night and they were definitely needed given the small size of the restaurant.  The menu isn't anything special--it's pretty typical italian, but it is quite large and had a lot of vegetarian choices.  Before we could even order, a basket of piping hot, delicious homemade bread appeared at our table-always a good start.  After much deliberation, we decided to split the Baked Mostaccioli and the Vegetable Special with spinach, broccoli, tomatoes, and artichokes. The pasta came with a salad and they were nice enough to split it into two bowls for us, providing samples of both homemade dressings.  I had the creamy garlic, which had an incredibly thick consistency but a smooth, mellow flavor.  The salad was a little thin (I believe only lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumbers) but I'm not going to complain about something that came with the meal for free when most places charge extra for it.   I'll start with the pizza because, instinctively, that's what we immediately reached for when both entrees arrived.  It was thin crust, but not like any thin crust I've had before.  It was cut into triangles and had a crispy, raised edge that allowed you to pick up a slice like a more typical, hand-tossed pizza.  Although the pizza was loaded with veggies, it was still crispy on the bottom.  The most striking aspect of the dish was the cheese-it wasn't anything special (just your basic melted, shredded mozzarella) but it had such a pungent, rich flavor that hit me with the first bite and never let up, even the next day when I reheated the leftovers.  The pizza alone made the trip worthwhile.   After a couple pieces of delicious, crispy, hot pizza we were already feeling full.  Nonetheless, we still gave the mostaccioli its due attention.  It was nothing like the pasta at Nella (see my review), but still pretty tasty.  It was rather plain-just cheese, marinara sauce, and pasta-but everything was well-seasoned and the pasta was cooked al dente.  However, the dish could have been improved upon.  First, the cheese could have been baked a little more to get that nice golden brown finish.  Second, the marinara was a little watery-probably the result of a poor pasta straining.  That was certainly a rookie mistake, but given that it didn't take away too much from the dish, I didn't let it bother me too much.  Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone.  The menu is extensive, the food is great, the portions are huge, the service is friendly and attentive, the atmosphere is unique, and the price is right.  Just make sure you call ahead for reservations.  You could also tell them that ""Neil G. from Yelp"" sent you, but they probably wouldn't care.  Well, at least not yet.

I can't believe it took me a year to make it back to LG, even with 2 Groupons burning a hole in my pocket; there was no debate about where we'd have our (me and my dad) birthday dinner. Since my dad's only complaint last time was that he felt claustrophobic, I requested a window table when making our reservation.  We started out with drinks. I love Richard's, our server, strong drinks and generous wine pours; my pinot grigio was poured like a pint, right up to the brim. We decided to forgo appetizers knowing portions were generous and we'd already tackled the bread basket with the vigor of an after-Thanksgiving sale. I ordered the stuffed gnocchi with marinara, my dad the eggplant parmesan, and my mom the veal special. Entrees come with soup or salad; my mom and I got salads with the house creamy garlic and my dad opted for the spinach egg drop, one of his faves and prepared just the way he liked it. My mom was the only one disappointed with her meal, and by disappointed I mean she really liked it, but didn't love it; my dad and I loved our meals. I don't typically order gnocchi, I've been disappointed by it too many times, but these were delicious, glorious little pillows stuffed with ricotta. Both of my parent's dishes also came with sides of pasta, their plates were teeming with food which just means they get to enjoy a second meal; I finished mine off. I didn't really have room for dessert, but my parent's had called ahead and Richard brought out an order of tiramisu with a candle and happy birthday etched in chocolate. To be frank, I don't really care for tiramisu but I took a few obligatory bites, it wasn't bad, and turned the plate over to my parents - I'm suspicious that was their plan all along.

2010-09-14,3.0,"So I have this friend.  She's really nice and sweet, but has a couple of marbles loose.  More than a couple. She just got a new boyfriend - over the internet.  She hasn't met him yet, but she calls him her boyfriend.   Unfortunately, she's had some bad experiences with men she's met over the internet, and is a little afraid to meet him.  And I, being the easily manipulated person I am, agreed to meet him *first*, to scope him out, so I can tell her he's cool IRL (that's ""in real life,""  for those of you unfamiliar with Internet forum speak).  And he, as a probable serial Internet dater, felt this was perfectly normal and agreed to meet me for dinner. I had earlier started a thread asking where the best gnocchi in Chicago was  yelp.com/topic/chicago-b… in which La Gondola got a solid five votes (one extra after my tally).   I had been meaning to go for awhile, and yesterday I saw my opportunity.  If I were going to pig out on gnocchi, who better than with my crazy friend's imaginary Internet boyfriend?  I told him to meet me at the strip mall. I got there first, and was HORRIFIED.  It was adorable and romantic and intimate -  that is NOT the direction I was seeking this particular evening.  It most certainly was not what I expected from a place in a strip mall.   The football game playing on the wall helped a little, though. My gnocchi: The ricotta stuffed gnocchi was light and pillowy, and quite perfect.  The pesto was not basil-y enough.   It definitely could have used more garlic as well, but after all, this was a date restaurant.   I found myself being super tacky and adding tons of red pepper flakes, black pepper, and some salt.  Sorry La Gondola, but your bland pesto reduced me to bad manners. The service: Attentive and polite.  The waiter teased me a little on actually being able to finish ALL my gnocchi in one sitting - ""well, I see you didn't like the gnocchi,"" and this embarrassed me.  But how much more embarrassed could I be on a pseudo date in a romantic restaurant with someone else's internet boyfriend?  Not much more.   The man: thoughtful, interesting, and quite considerate and kind.  Quite a catch, even IRL.",0.994,0.704,0.201,0.094,0.5602000940236235

La Gondola was simply a wonderful experience from beginning to end.  The meal started with freshly baked, crusty Italian bread, and ended with an excellent crisp pizza with some of the most amazingly creamy cheese I've ever tasted.  In between, and I know this sounds really odd, I ate what had to be the best fried mozzarella sticks ever made.  La Gondola's ability to even make those unique and classy really speaks volumes of this tiny little place's ability. Now was it the absolute best Italian food I've ever had?  No.  It's easily in the top five, but what is really worth noting and really sets this place apart is the unbelievable service.  Friendly, attentive, conscientious, our waitstaff provided just about the best service I've ever had outside of a cruise ship.  Good food is great, but care for the customer pushes an establishment from a solid 4 to a well-deserved 5.  For a six-table place that barely seems big enough for carry-out, La Gondola puts much bigger more ""fine dining"" type places to shame when it comes to service.  I was extremely impressed.

But I knew we had to plan ahead, because I'd read the reviews, knew it was small, and knew it might be a hassle to get to on a weeknight. Finally, we made it. And yes, the place IS small, and not quite what I was expecting -- but they managed to pack a lot of charm into a six-table restaurant. It's a bit cramped but very cute, nicely decorated. We were sat pretty quickly and perused the menu. Service was at about 90% -- not perfection, but very good, very friendly, plenty of drink refills, offers of bread and checking in.  And the food? Awesome. We started with the warm, crusty bread -- tasted fresh out of the oven, and was delightful with some great olive oil. Then went with some great, clearly homemade mozzarella sticks.  My salad had plenty of fresh, crisp greens, cherry tomatoes and cucumbers, plus a fantastic, flavorful (if a smidge salty) house dressing. My entrée was the gnocchi caprese -- so so good. Delightful little pillows of potato pasta plus fresh, creamy mozzarella, diced tomatoes and a sprinkle of basil. Huge portion, half of it came home. My dining companions split a pepperoni pizza that I managed to snag a bite of. It looked scrumptious and it was -- with a taste I can't quite put my finger on, a certain creamy buttery richness I rarely taste in pizza.

2010-08-06,5.0,"okay okay, i'm about as guilty as it gets when it comes to ""never judge a book by its cover"" on this one. but c'mon. you're telling me you'd think a tiny little ristorante in a strip mall sandwiched between SUPERCUTS and H&R BLOCK would be five stars worth of deliciousness? that's what i thought. first of all, the rather tacky sign out front reads ""la gondola pizzeria"", implying that pizza is what this quaint little joint specializes in. while that may be true, it is SO MUCH MORE than that. first of all, make sure you have a reservation. we're talking six tables here. make the call. once you walk in, the effervescent dee greets and seats you, and be prepared for the warmest smile and the wittiest comments from him. once you're situated, the vast, ugly parking lot melts away, leaving you with your dining companion(s), the beautifully decorated interior, and excellent service. the food blew me away. the bread is so fresh it's still hot to the touch once it reaches the table. get the grilled calamari. the large tubes are perfectly seasoned and cooked, whetting the appetite for more. my mother and i both got pasta, and each pasta comes with your choice of soup or salad. get the stracciatella. it's basically a spinach egg drop soup. not too salty with plenty of popeye's favorite for vitamin a. i got the tortellini panna, which had prosciutto, mushrooms, pecorino romano, and sat in a generous amount of light cream sauce. it was simply fantastic. the prosciutto had a little crunch to it, and that coupled with the softness of the mushrooms and al dente-ness of the tortellini strung everything together in flavorful heaven. there was so much sauce the only logical move was to rip off a fresh piece of bread and go for it. my mother got one of the specials of the day:: boneless chicken breast with portobello mushrooms in a creamy sauce over fettucini. she loved it. wait a sec, yelper. we're not through just yet. for the record, i don't even LIKE tiramisu that much. since my mother was the birthday girl, she got her pick of anything. the only word that comes to mind when describing this tiramisu is ""wow"". fluffy, juicy, and about as satisfying as any dessert can get. it was perfection on a plate. trust me. i'm careful when knighting a restaurant with five stars, and i *wanted* to give this place four stars for the lack of air conditioning or the lack of employees answering the phone. however, there IS air conditioning. you just need to ask for it to be turned on (dee likes the soft breeze). also, when i finally got through on the phone, la gondola was more than accommodating. honestly, it was no surprise that about 15 different people came in to pick up orders while i ate my meal. so the next time you want some good montepulciano and margherita or manicotti, hop on la gondola and enjoy the ride.",0.9981,0.762,0.193,0.044,0.625194191151638

The first time I came here with my Groupon, I made the mistake of not making a reservation. Poor judgement, I know. There was a 2 hours wait so I decided to come back some other day. Other day rolled by and this time, I was smart. I called continuously until I reached the maitre de and reserved a spot for me and the bubby at 7:30.  When we got there, there was a 10 minute wait but we made use of our time at the nearby Pier one and office depot. I got the rigatoni boseaiola and the bubby got smoked salmon pasta. When the portions came out, holy moly it was big. Nevertheless to say, I had to brown bag the rest. The smoked salmon was good but a little on the salty side. But that was given because  it was smoked salmon.   Atmosphere: The place is pretty small if small is a word. It reminded me of a dorm room. My suggestion is moving the place a couple of stores to the right which is empty and a lot bigger. Therefore, they can accommodate more people.  But the place is cozy and the ambience was nice and romantic.  When I first came through the door, I saw a place seating for 2 at the door. I hoped it wasn't for us, but sadly to say.... It was. But as it turns out, it was the best place for me and my bf. We got to listen in to people coming in and getting turned away because they did not make reservations. Yes, we are one nosy couple.  One person even said "" I thought this was a pizza place, is it really that popular?""...... I wanted to answer.... Yes, it is! -1 Star: Why? After eating my boseaiola, I realized that it had no meat and I wasn't sure if my dish had meat or not. I didn't want to complain so I did not say anything. But after re-reading reviews, it did indeed have sausage but it was not on my dish. I was a tad disappointing afterwards. But since the dish was so tasty, I didn't mind it a whole lot. It was still tangy, hearty and delicious.  The tiramisu was also sub par. It wasn't my favorite dessert in the city. Next time, I will skip that and enjoy my meal.

2010-07-15,5.0,"My first thought when I walked in - holy sh$t this place is tiny. I think the dining room is about 10x10 with like 6 tables. Which is why I hear they do a killer take-out and delivery business. Which is also why if you want to dine-in, make a reservation!! So anyway, I'd been wanting to try this place out for awhile after getting glowing recommendations from a fellow yelper and his Italian GF. Apparently she is very picky about italian food but said this place is up to par. And after eating there, I have to agree. The pasta is phenomenal. So good in fact, that I ate every last bite and the last time I was able to finish off a plate of pasta, after having first consumed some bread and mussels, was...........never? Or a realllllly long time ago. But my dish was just so damn good I ate until my pants almost burst.  So as I said, we started with the mussels. They were cooked really well - very tender - but personally I didn't love the tomato sauce. It just tasted kind of bland. But, this is coming from someone who typically likes her mussels served in more of a white wine & garlic sauce - so take that with a grain of salt.  So while I wasn't blown away with the mussels, that pretty much flew out of my mind when our entrees arrived. Upon a recommendation from our server, I ordered the Gnocchi Piemontese. The sauce was to die for. Really, as that annoying twit Rachel Zoe say's ""I Die"", and I did. Well not literally, but I wanted to lick the plate and then steal the recipe so I could eat it every day. Which would have then turned me in to the worlds fattest woman and eventually that would have led to my death. So there, in this case 'I Die' works. But let me get back on track. I also tasted the Rigatoni Porcini, which I thought would taste very similar to my dish since they both had a tomato cream sauce, but surprisingly the sauce was a bit different (and almost as good). And the last dish I tasted was the Mostaccioli Salmonate. Again, very very tasty. Truthfully I would have been satisfied with any of those 3 dishes. Everything was so good, the pasta perfectly cooked, the sauces so decadent, that it would have been impossible to leave unhappy.  All I can say is I went about a week ago and I'm STILL thinking about the pasta. Will I go back - uhm hell yeah!

2010-01-21,3.0,"I like deep dish pizza, but I have yet to find a really good one in Chicago.  I've only tried twice, but still, I thought it would have been easier than this.   We ordered from La Gondola on a Saturday night so cold it would have frozen napalm, and it took an hour an a half to arrive.  I'm not taking anything off for that, as I'm guessing they were pretty busy that night, and they called almost immediately to warn us of that.  Some places would have just delivered whenever it was done without saying a word.   The french fries we got weren't bad, weren't spectacular, but there was one glaring problem with them.  We didn't order french fries, we ordered garlic fries.  Now, I don't just like garlic.  I love garlic. When I cook a dish with garlic in it, I take however much the recipe calls for, double it, then throw in a couple of more cloves for good measure.  When I order something with ""garlic"" in the name, you had better bring it.  These fries did not.  Meaning either they got our order wrong, or they think ""garlic fries"" are french fries that someone waved a head of garlic at.   The pizza wasn't bad.  It was quite filling, and the cheese was very good, as was the sauce.  The dough, however, had very little flavor, and the toppings (spinach and garlic) were barely detectable.  They were there, but they added very little to the dish.  Considering we paid an extra $3 to have them put on there, we wanted more.  We should have saved our money and just had a cheese pizza.  So, I would give La Gondola a second chance if I lived in the area, but I was not overly impressed.",0.9906,0.809,0.153,0.038,0.4921428571428571

We got a cozy little table near the window but away from the door (the couple near the door looked cold...) We had the lovely experience of having D as our waiter.  The couple next to us? They had come specifically to just see D and had driven from an hour away.  That is dedication. The bread was warm and delicious with olive oil. Salads are included with your entrée (which is really not that common) and they were fresh greens with tomatoes.  I got the house vinaigrette but after trying the creamy garlic, I wish that I had gotten that instead (it is made in house as well).  The creamy garlic dressing had a bite to it and was rich and delicious, without tasting too salad dressingly.  Entrees were gnocchi with mushrooms (though next time, I plan to try the house specialty with homemade pesto).  The gnocchi was light and fresh and there was definitely a good sized portion.  D recommended the eggplant Monte Carlo for me.  Oh goodness-this was a decadent dish! There were three layers of fried eggplant with a white wine sauce.  It also had artichoke hearts and fresh tomatoes and was served with a side of sautéed spinach.   It tasted creamy and rich but there was no cream used.  So delicious!! It was way too much to finish so I took the rest of that home as well.  The desserts I am sure are amazing, but we were too full. We were there for 2 hours and at the end of the night, D came around with shots of Limón cello for everyone.  This is also made in house and is um...195% proof.  What?! It was delicious and didn't burn on the way down.  The service was good, but a bit slow. There is only one waiter for all six tables (but maybe when it is super crazy, they have two?) But when your waiter comes and talks to you and visits with you and has recommendations, it makes eating there an experience.  Just go in knowing that it may take a while, and this isn't a place for a quick meal.  However, this is a wonderful place for good food, great atmosphere and nice wait staff.   It is quite dangerous that this place exists.  And they do take away.  Oh dear...I may or may not gain 10 pounds this winter.  But they will be happy pounds!",0.9983,0.769,0.195,0.037,0.6083333333333333

2009-10-19,4.0,"4.5 Stars.  Holy Strip Mall Batman! Yes, LaGondola is in a strip mall. So you need to look for it. I was recently there on a Wednesday night with my sister & nephews. Very intimate. Downright tiny even. And way romantic. Just the place to have dinner with your sister and 2 teenage nephews. Yup. The host inquired if we had a reservation. We did not think we needed one; of course seeing how small the place is it probably would be a good idea in the future. We were seated right away. But it was a Wednesday night. I can only imagine it gets way busy on a Friday/Saturday. Our host, Richard was also our server and he was attentive, thorough and knowledgeable regarding the menu. Warm bread brought straight form the kitchen to the table. Olive oil & Parmesan cheese for the bread. Typical appetizers. We tried: Deep Fried Ravioli homemade meat or cheese ravioli breaded and fried, served with homemade meat sauce.  I started with Stracciatella: a secret recipe our chef brought all the way from Rome: Spinach egg soup. Delish.  My nephews ordered a pizza (shocking, I know) I had Rigatoni Boscaiola (signature dish): cream tomato sauce, fresh mushrooms, and sautéed Italian sausage and fresh sage. Now, it's hard to be blow away by a pasta dish. Well hard for me anyway. But I was. Blown away that is. My sister ordered the special. Lobster Ravioli and was raving about it. I tried a piece of the pizza and it is thin crust and yummy. It took every ounce of self control to not finish my pasta. Two days later my pasta leftovers were as good as when ordered.  Everything was perfect. I will certainly be back with the bf for a romantic dinner.  It actually pains me to give it 4.5 stars instead of 5, but you have to go through the kitchen to get to the bathroom. Don't care for that.",0.8968,0.896,0.08,0.024,0.4901766513056835

I have NEVER tasted lobster ravioli as good as this place.  We ordered the deep fried meat ravioli appetizer and the portion was enough for all four of us and wonderful.   My sons couldn't get enough of the fresh bread out of the oven so they could dip it in the the olive oil.

2009-10-10,4.0,"A restaurant goes from good to great in my humble opinion for one reason...service. My girlfriend took me to La Gondola last night. The food was good. We shared the Calamari alla Griglia which delivered as promised. Pretty good way to start off... She had the Linguini with Mussels so big each one was the size of my fist -- they were huge!  I had the osso buco special. it was also ridiculously large. It was done alla milanesa style with saffron risotto. People are finnicky about how they like their risotto cooked, so for my taste it was respectable.  The twin shanks though...were gi-normous! And cooked to perfection right down to the marrow --which came with the little marrow fork which is always a nice touch. So, I would have given La Gondola a ""3"" which is a good rating, but our waiter, a gentleman named ""Dee"" was probably one of the better servers either of us have experienced in any dining environment in years. He was excellent.  It's a small dining room and I think he pretty much had the six or so tables to himself. Yet, still managed to pay effortless attention to each table (ex. singing happy birthday and bringing a big martini with a lit candle on the rim to the table next to us.) If it was the last restaurant on earth, I wouldn't dream of eating in this uber-depressing strip mall. I think there's a dolllar store in it!  This little nook however with its six tables, solid food and Ace waiter makes it an experience...no...an italian oasis (!) I would come back to as my default neighborhood italian choice every time. It's not fancy.  It's not even remotely trendy. But it doesn't pretend to be something it's not and delivers a great experience. ..and interestingly enough as a marketer, I was really impressed with their social media marketing.

The mozz sticks were half frozen and looked like they had been pried off a cafeteria tray circa 1983.  Disgusting.  We both got the same pasta dish (cavatelli with cheese and ""fresh"" basil) and it was literally drowning in grease.  I mean these noodles were sloshing around in the tin like it was their job and all the basil must have drowned long before it reached us.   The only thing I ended up having for dinner was the Diet Coke I ordered from them.   Thank god they haven't found a way to screw that up....yet.  Bleh.",-0.2342,0.815,0.098,0.087,0.5112179487179488

I was on GrubHub and decided to try something new.  I'm now addicted and find myself ordering from here up to 3x a week. My favorite dish from here is the Penne Arrabiatta. It is the best I've ever had hands down. I try to order different items from the menu and have tried many different things but for the most part find myself ordering the arrabiatta. They also have a wonderul rotini primavera and fettuccine alfredo! Their portions are large which is wonderful for leftovers. Their sauces (including Alfredo) are all homemade and made from scratch. I wish they bottled it and sold it in grocery stores. Everybody who I have ever recommended La Gondola to has fallen in love with it. They have unbelievable Facebook specials every week which only makes it even better.  Delivery: These guys have mastered the concept of delivery. It is amazing how well they preserve pasta/pizza/salad until it arrives at your doorsteps. They do not use cheap delivery plates, rather high quality materials to keep the food fresh. Dine-In: Yes people, it is located inside a shopping center. Get over it. That is not a good enough reason to dock a couple of stars from a review. Once you walk in, you will notice a wonderful decor and the most friendly staff I have experienced at a restaurant. Dine in space is very limited so make sure you make reservations well in advance depending on the day. They also have gift certificates available on  restaurant.com  ($25 certificate for $10).

FRESH ingredients - yes, I could taste the freshness of it all - the crust, sauce, the cheese, the green peppers, and even the pepperoni was deliciously fresh.  I was in heaven.

It's in a strip mall and while some of the best restaurants are in strip malls back home in Florida, it's rare to see this in Chicago My friends and I were warmly greeted by D, who I'm convinced may be my favorite waiter in the city. He brought out a bread basket filled with delicious warm bread and we felt right at home.   The vast menu had many tasting looking options, but I was in the mood for chicken on this particular evening. We ordered a fried calamari appetizer for the table.  It was a very large portion (just perfect for our party of 6) and happened to be pretty tasty as well. For my main meal I decided on the pollo monte carlo after checking with D that it would be delicious.  This also came with a soup- minestrone or eggdrop spinach. Eggdrop spinach for me, which I'm going to claim as the best soup ever. The pollo monte carlo was the perfect choice. Delicious chicken topped with many veggies (mushrooms, artichokes, red peppers, and even some eggplant) and the white wine sauce on it was lovely.  My husband loved his veal marsala as well and was nice enough to let me steal some generous sized bites. Others at the table enjoyed various delish looking pasta dishes, as well as a chicken dish that took 45 minutes to bake. But from what I hear it was well worth it.  And of course the meal wouldn't have been as enjoyable without the 3 bottles of  wine we ordered.  While we're not usually ones to turn down dessert (especially tiramisu- mmmm), we wanted to save room for the alcoholic beverages that awaited us at a bday bash.  However, D sent us off read to party by bringing out some homemade limonchello shots for the table before we took off...and I totally blame those for my drunken stupor later in the evening.

My friend told me that the signature Rigatoni Boscaiola is the best pasta dish she's ever tasted. Um, can we say, ""high expectations?"" Turns out she's not far off. While no one can top my mom's homemade meat sauce, La Gondola's Rigatoni Boscaiola is pretty damn tasty. I dug on the ample amounts of sausage and mushrooms in the sauce and the pasta was cooked perfectly. Standout for sure!  La Gondola also has one of the better Caesar salads I've eaten in recent memory. See, the problem with Caesar salad is that while I love the dressing, I hate that you just get boring Romaine lettuce and croutons. This salad had lots of yummy cucumbers, too! And the dressing? Sigh... it's super-parmesany, creamy and just perfect. Nom nom nom!  The pizza is also solid. I hate it when pizza places don't crisp up the pepperoni, leaving you with sad, soggy little circles of disappointment. Not the case at La Gondola.

The rigatoni with porcini is out of this world, as is the linguine with red clam sauce (the white clam sauce is good too). Their pizza is wonderful, the gnocchi melts in your mouth, and their portions are HUGE!  Plan to take home leftovers. The service is excellent and the ambience is really nice.  Even though they only have 6 or so tables, it does not feel cramped at all.  Be sure to make a reservation, though, if you plan to go on the weekend.  And if you go during the week, go early, because I've been there on a Wednesday when all the tables are taken.  They also do take out, and I believe delivery too. For all their huge portions and delicious food, they are really reasonably priced.  Definitely good value for the money you spend.",0.9925,0.776,0.224,0.0,0.6078042328042329
2009-04-05,5.0,"La Gondola is one of those restaurants on Yelp that deserves every star it has received and I'm thankful that I live close enough to consider this my ""local Italian spot."" La Gondola...why do I love thee?  Let me count the ways... Location: A hole in the wall of the shopping center, you would never guess it is there.  Which is probably good because then more people would know about it. Interior: Small, intimate and romantic (or ""cute"" as my girlfriend would call it) with about 6-7 4-top tables.  This is definitely somewhere you NEED a reservation.  If you want Saturday night, make your reservation Tuesday at the latest.  Homey Italian decor, dim lighting and warm colors make you feel right at home. Service: Great food is only one factor of the dining experience.  What makes me so excited to come back here time and time again is the service.  There is someone there whom I believe is named Richard if I recall correctly and you would think he is the owner based on how polite, friendly and helpful he is.  However he is not the owner which says a lot about the quality of the staff there.  Be sure to take him up on his wine recommendation as there is only one wine he ever drinks off their menu and it is great and affordable. Food: I've had a lot of Italian food in my life, and I've been to Italy, and this definitely makes the cut.  True, their menu isn't the most creative--you won't find any bizarre regional Italian dishes like you might find at some other spots.  You won't find ridiculous dishes that are so obviously over the top gourmet.  What you WILL find is some seriously good and perfectly executed home-style Italian cuisine with home-made everything. First, you need to start with their minestrone soup.  Simply the best I've ever had and far outshines their other soup option.  Their signature Rigatoni Boscaiola is great if you like meaty and spicy pastas (which I of course do) while their Gnocchi stuffed w/ ricotta are out of this world.  Their non-pasta dishes are excellent too.  While I'm still dying to have one of their baked chicken dishes, they unfortunately take about 45 minutes to prepare so unless you order ahead, they are typically not doable if you are with a group that is not ordering them.  That said, their Chicken Monte Carlo was very nice, and had a surprise layer of eggplant on the bottom that was deliciously creamy and warm. The one dish I have had there that I did not care for terribly was their Misto Di Pesce Alla Griglia which is essentially a number of different seafood types that are breaded and deep-fried.  To be honest, I found them a little bland because there was no sauce and the seafood flavor got lost in the frying process.  That said, the breading is some of the most delicate and light breading I've ever had on anything deep-fried.  (EDIT: Apparently this dish is baked which would explain the lightness of the breading and is a more traditional old-style Italian dish) And the dish wasn't horrible, it was just all the same flavor which got a little old.  Still decent though, especially if it would be paired with a couple nice sauces. Desserts are all exquisite but because of how huge the portions are, don't expect to have room for them unless you're taking a lot home. Value and Overall Rating: Portions here are definitely ""Italian-sized"" as in, MASSIVE.  My girlfriend and I will each get an entree for about $12-15 each and be able to feed ourselves for at least 1-2 meals with the leftovers.  Plus, when you order in they give you each a massive loaf (not slice, LOAF) of bread, and a choice of soup or salad. That value, coupled with the perfect service, great atmosphere and delicious food make it so you you can't go wrong here.  Just make sure you make your reservation in advance or order in.",0.9975,0.844,0.143,0.014,0.6116740494647471

Amazing, friendly staff, incredible food, and one of the best owners on the planet, our own Andy M.  I can call the restaurant, tell them it's me, specify the number of people I'm feeding and ask Andy to just send what he thinks is best.  Shortly thereafter, a feast arrives that makes everyone silly happy.  THAT is service.  Andy also likes to do cute things, like send out the occasional heart shaped pizza when he knows it's a special occasion or toss in a dessert if he knows I've been having a bad day - seriously, who does that? La Gondola, that's who. Everything is good, but highlights include the EXTRA thin crust pizza (Andy uses a special and very expensive cheese on his pizzas that no one else in Chicago uses), the Italian Beef, anything gnocchi, the strachitella soup (my cure all), the mussels, and the lobster ravioli.  I was recently surprised on one of my ""you pick for me orders"" with a stunning seafood chowder - you should have seen the hunks of beautiful clams and scallops in this soup, it was amazing! Truly, you just can't go wrong here, I trust these people with my stomach without reservation! If you chose to dine in, be sure you make a reservation.  Andy, rightly, has a lot of regulars and the restaurant is teensy, so reservations are a must.  Delivery is always fast and well packaged.  Also, if you have any special dietary needs, be sure to let them know when you order as the kitchen is fantastic about customizing dishes. The glowing reviews speak for themselves - Andy truly cares about his food and his customers and always goes the extra mile to make sure his patrons are happy.  I'd say at least 5 of my winter 10 lbs are directly due to Andy's irresistible food - tiny me just can't stop pigging out!  One of my all time favorites in Chicago and a pleasure to recommend.",0.9982,0.741,0.244,0.015,0.6496428571428571
2009-03-12,4.0,"That Andy McGuire is one smart cookie. While other business owners are bitching about Yelp practicing ""extortion,"" Andy has figured out how to use social networking sites such as Yelp and Facebook to his advantage. How else to explain how this tiny, 6 table restaurant has 150 reviews? Of course, it helps that the food and service are excellent. First off, I must warn you: make reservations! I went on a Tuesday night, and wasn't going to call ahead, because it was a Tuesday. But then I read some Yelp reviews and realized the place is tiny, so I made a reso. I'm so glad I did! The place was packed. Which is easy to do with 6 tables, but still. (Note: although there are 6 tables, one is a deuce right in front of the door. You don't want that table. You may take it if you have to, but you don't want it.) The menu is surprisingly large for such a small place. I always have problems with huge menus, because I'm afraid of experiencing buyer's remorse. Our server, Richard, did a great job of pointing out some of his favorites, and explaining what he liked about those dishes. This was a big help. It's one thing to say you love the ravioli; it's quite another to be able to tell me what to expect from the dish. I ended up getting the ravioli -- the lobster ravioli that was on special - and it was excellent. The pasta was perfectly cooked, the filling had a great texture and flavor, and the cream sauce didn't overpower the pasta. My companion had the chicken parmesan, which was huge -- plenty to take home to her boyfriend! The dinners come with soup or salad, and the stracciatella -- a spinach and egg soup -- was one of the best soups I've ever had. This is not an exaggeration. The wine list is small, and a little disappointing, especially in the whites. I would normally drink red, but not with lobster and cream sauce. I ordered the drier of the two Pinots on the menu, and would have preferred it was a bit crisper. This is a small complaint for what was, over all, an excellent meal. My friend said La Gondola is a perfect Tuesday night place, and I completely agree. And since the restaurant seemed to be filled with regulars, we are obviously not alone.

First off, MAD props to LG for getting my food to me in under 40 minutes.  Granted I live at Addison and Ashland, but still....it was nice for my order to come so quickly especially as I was anticipating eating here ALL DAY! Between my boy and I, we got the garlic fries, the rigatoni busciaola, shrimp diavolo, and the tiramisu.  Let me tell you--  we have leftovers for a week!  Seriously, the portions are out of control and COMPLETELY worth the money they're charging.  In the future, I might not get the fries if we're getting it delivered as they were a little soggy but that's to be expected;  they were delish regardless.  Both entrees came with soup as well--  minestrone for me, a spinach soup for my boy.  The spinach soup was on the salty side so it didn't get gobbled up, but the minestrone was gone in a heartbeat.  Perfect, homemade minestrone-- nothing special, just a basic broth with good ingredients.   The rigatoni was great with a tomato cream sauce.  The shrimp diavolo was also amazing but VERY SPICY.  I even asked for it to be made ""easy on  the spicy"", but I think they might've mistaken that for ""spicy is easy!"".  It was so damn good though, I toughed it out.  The tiramisu was fine, but nothing amazing.  I might be interested in trying the cannoli next time-- the tiramisu was just not as good as I wanted it to be  (Leona's has set a ridiculously high bar in this department).

However, I have to comment on the fake Laurie W's review.   That isn't fair...the purpose of Yelp is to write an honest review, both good and bad.  I know that the person who wrote this review is the owner, Andy.  How do I know?  He knows to put Buffalo Grove as his location which is where my office is.  That being said, he has called me at work 2 times now.  The second time yelling at me.  He threatened to call my boss...I don't know what for.    None of what he stated in that review is accurate.  There was tension when discussing the corking fee but only because I was told there wasn't one on the phone.  Miscommunication happens, and if it happened on my end then I apologize...but never did I once yell at the waitress.  That's not fair...Also, I never said I called in the morning.  I said I called sometime during the work day.  OH, and I never threatened to write a bad review if they didn't give us the corking fee.  We offered to leave and go somewhere else if it was going to be a problem.  At that point we had been sitting down for 15 minutes waiting for the manager to get off the phone to come and discuss the issue with us.  Andy, I know you are going to read this and I can honestly say I apologize for maybe being too hasty in my first review.  Everyone should know that just because I didn't love the food doesn't mean they won't.  The rest of the reviews are generally good.  I just don't think it's fair that you would create a new account (using my name at that!) and call me a beotch, say I needed to be spanked as a child etc...people deserve to know the truth and/or opinion about restaurants and services.  If you have a problem with this you should take it up with Yelp.  Please don't call me at my office or on my cell phone again.",-0.4108,0.835,0.085,0.08,0.6216333792470157

We went into La Gondola and asked if they had any tables available, they said no, and we figured they wouldn't. We ordered a pizza to go. While we were waiting, the chef came out and offered us a drink since we were waiting, which I thought was very very generous of him and unnecessary since we only waited about 15 minutes! The waiter, Richard, is always fantastic and he talked to us the whole time and continued to wait on his tables as well at the same time offering them amazing service all at once.  There was a birthday party who had reservations for 7:30. It was about 7:20 when they came in. Richard said he'd have their table ready in 10 minutes, and that the table before them was just finishing up and then he'd push their tables together since they had a party of 13 coming. The girl said, no it's only 8 people now. Richard seemed surprised, and with reason, since their tables seat 4 each, besides one round one which seats 5 or 6 I believe and he had reserved them 3 tables. 13 to 8 people is a big difference in that place. But he handled it well and offered them to sit down at the table that was available since only 4 of them had arrived so far and he'd have the other table ready in 10 minutes or less. She said, ""NO FORGET IT. I made reservations I should'nt have to wait."" She started storming out and even her family was like, ""What's your problem?"" They actually said that to her. The entire restaurant was surprised at her reaction. Since her reservation was set for 7:30 which would've been ten minutes anyway. But Richard handled it with grace, they came back in and crabbed some more. He apologized and had the table ready for them within 5 minutes. Richard deserves a 5 star rating and that's what I'll give him. OH And the food is DIVINE!",0.9864,0.835,0.13,0.035,0.5093295019157089

If you have not met D, then go to La Gondola on Thursday or Saturday and experience D himself. Beyond D, the rest of the people at La Gondola are pretty fantastic too as well as the food. It is amazing how the service can really make or break a place for me, check out some of my other reviews. If I had to base this place on food alone, I would have given it 4 stars, but D and the rest of the staff here pushed it to a solid 5 (my second 5 star rating to date, and my first 5 starer went to the Harold Washington Library!). This is a small cozy spot located in a strip mall but don't let that fool you! The fact that it is small means you should take heed that if you are going there on a Saturday to experience the awesomeness of D, then make reservations, and don't be late! I heard it first that D holds no reservations over an hour late, in fact, that is how we got our table last Saturday night. D was able to bump an hour late reservations to seat me and my girlfriend which was great of him to do since he could have easily turned us away (the hour late couple even showed up later). The food was pretty tasty. We ordered the bruschetta appetizer which seriously were 'just ok'. For the main course, my girlfriend ordered the gnocchi which was amazing and I had the Linguini Aglio Olio Con Gamberi (yeah I had trouble saying it) which was equally delicious. With fresh bread at the table we definitely ate more than we should have, the portions are fairly large. The drinks are even cheap! Or I should say reasonably priced!  I have to mention that my girlfriend is half Italian, which means most Italian restaurants are a no go for her, but this place had it all and best of all her approval to return.

I've been enjoying this little neighborhood place for some time now, but my visits have become more regular - the food is THAT good. I now use this as my control group for Italian food. Unfortunately, no other restaurant can live up the deliciousness that is La Gondola. I had the pleasure of officially meeting Andy (La Gondola's owner) at YATW and he got me good a few weeks ago! As we were finishing our meal our waitress comes over and puts down a plate of their mussels (YUM!), she told me I should know why Andy was sending them.  SIDE NOTE: The mussels were fantastic, huge and fresh in their addictive spicy tomato sauce. My dining companions that night weren't very adventurous eaters and had never tried mussels. To my surprise they eagerly tried them and enjoyed them! Okay, back to my story -  I thought to myself, mussels? Hmm... YELP! Due to La Gondola's small size I had to choose a different restaurant for a large dinner party (8 people). For this large party we went with another Italian restaurant in the neighborhood. In my Yelp review of the other restaurant I raved about the mussels I had at this dinner. BAM! I put 2 and 2 together - Andy read my review! He came out to the table and we had a good laugh about it. I apologized for cheating, I swear I didn't want to do it!  To top off what was already a lovely evening, Andy then really went above and beyond! During our conversation my sister mentioned she wanted to try the pumpkin ravioli, but they were out when we placed our order. Andy let us know they just prepared some and he made her an order to-go!  Andy and La Gondola took an ordinary weeknight dinner and turned into something really special!

2008-11-10,5.0,"I have ventured out into Chicago in search of the finest Italian dining this city has to offer, and one restaurant struck my fancy more than any other: La Gondola.  When you hear the word gondola you may think of the calm waters of Venice, but after reading my review I hope you will think of your stomach.   Location: Nestled between a Game Stop store and a Super Cuts, lies a unique, quaint and romantic restaurant named La Gondola. When you first step in the scent of freshly prepared food intoxicates your senses  and entices your hunger.  The atmosphere captivates you with a cozy feeling that makes you feel right at home.  The only downside was there were only 6 tables that makes up the dining room, but that seems trivial when a complimentary glass of Merlot is brought to you. Staff: The staff at La Gondola makes us feel right at home. I literally felt as if I were at a family member's house. The staff and owner take immense pride into what they consider a second home.  The entire atmosphere of La Gondola was so homey it made me never want to leave.  What really impressed me was how friendly and willing the staff and even the owner was to talk to me. I couldn't ask for a more hospitable atmosphere and I would only expect that if I were at home.   The food: As an Italian and a chef, food is a vast part of my life. With that being said, I am especially critical of where and what to eat. I can sincerely say that La Gondola is perhaps one of the most underestimated restaurants in Chicago. I've had the opportunity to have tried some of the best and worse restaurants. La Gondola is on the top of the list of being the best. The food is of very high quality and the presentation and taste is exquisite. I have given a rating: Appetizers:  Mozzarella sticks (5): Tasty fresh buffalo mozzarella cheese, breaded with homemade Italian bread crumbs and herbs, deep fryer and served with a delicious marinara sauce. Excellent, is all I can say. I could taste the freshness of the cheese and the breading complimented the marinara sauce. You can taste the quality and appreciate it being homemade.  Calamari (4): A light but flavorful breading that complimented the homemade zesty cocktail sauce. The squid was awesome and not chewy at all, as you would encounter in many places.  Dinner: Gnocchi stuffed with ricotta cheese in a tomato-cream sauce (5+): Absolutely the best gnocchi and tomato-cream sauce I have ever tasted. The Stuff gnocchi was beyond pillow soft, and you can almost feel it melt right in your mouth. The tomato-cream sauce complimented it extremely well and it was simply wonderful.  Dessert: Tiramisu (5): One of the best desserts  La Gondola has. Consequently, La Gondola Italian restaurant is extremely underestimated.  The food and staff reveal what a incredible dining experience should entail and assures that great family run restaurants do still exist. So before your preconceived motions over take your ultimate decision, give La Gondola a chance. You won't regret it.",0.9986,0.743,0.204,0.053,0.6228935064935066

When it comes to baked mostaccioli, I am a snob--but it sounded awesome (as it usually does) so I ordered it for delivery. Found out while ordering that all entrees come with soup or salad, so I happily ordered salad. The delivery man came a little earlier than expected, and while I paid about 20 bucks after tip for my delivery (there's a $2.95 delivery charge), I was thrilled by the amount of food I received. They gave me a side salad, two half baguettes of old world Italian bread, and this HUGE container of mostaccioli. It must have weighed five pounds. I knew I wouldn't be able to eat it all, so I sat down and happily devoured as much as I could before the button on my jeans would pop. The dish was a perfect, piping hot when it was delivered, the mozzarella creamy and hot, the meat sauce pleasantly tangy, and the mostaccioli itself tender and not overdone. Woohoo!  A couple meals later, there's still a heft portion of mostaccioli left in my fridge. I am a happy customer.

I quickly perused the menu, and noticing the time made a quick choice for a plethora of options.  Saltimbocca is one of my favorites with the warm rich texture and flavor and who can resist made to order alfredo.  Gnocchi and the sauteed spinach with garlic.  Everything came in less than the 45 min that they said, piping hot and neatly arranged in the delivery bag.  I will say the spinach was probably the least favorite of the bunch, but all in all, great presentation and taste.  Next time I will opt for the steamed broccoli rather than the spinach.

He had the manicotti and I had the half moon pasta with spinach and ricotta served in a marinara sauce. First of all, the portions are large.  Second, the ingredients are fresh and straightforward.   I really enjoyed the cannoli as well.

The delivery guy came,and went and then I opened the bag (yeah- I know-big mistake!)  Two things immediately were apparent.  One- that they had forgotten my salad (pout!) and two- that there was no flatware in the bag for me to eat my dinner with. OK, I thought.  I'll just call up and the guy will come back.  So I called and waited and waited and waited and finally the bartender took pity on us and found some flatware behind the bar.  I wonder just how much better my lasagna would have been had it been hot?

2008-08-13,5.0,"So, I am tagging on Deanna M's review since I ate the same pizza, though she never offered up the Risotto! Apparently, yes, they even threw in an extra pie and some wine since Jenny Z is a loyal customer.  Cannot remember the exact topping list, but various meats and simple veggie-like were to the two pies we ordered and they threw in a chicken and pesto.  Backstory: I did not really know pizza other than Pizza Hut or some various frozen kind or another until later in life when I moved to NYC. In NYC you have competing factions - John's or Grimaldi's or Lombardi's. There is Patsy's but they are all corporate after a large feud with lawyers and such and stole the name from what is now Grimaldi's. If you are in NYC and eat there... well you ain't getting the best... just a corporate knock off. All of the three make pies that are wicked thin crust, coal fired melt in your mouth loveliness. Me... well, though I hate to ditch BK, I liked Lombardi's best. Just always thought the topping list was better and more consistent pies came out of there oven. Of course one might say that about the others, but who's arguing here. We were talking about La Gondola's, right. Ok. so the pizza here is very similar to what you find in the good shops in NYC. The crust, maybe not as thin, but compared to this ""Chicago Style"" insanity you call pizza here, well done. well done. The ingredients were fresh and simple. I am a bit of traditionalist, so the chicken pesto was not what I would have ordered myself, but was Fantastico anyway. I cannot vouch  for whether the pie here is coal fired or not, so if anyone knows, let me know. I will definitely order more and more and more.

I had the minestrone which was a perfect balance of broth and pasta/pot/veg. It was served piping hot which I really appreciated as one of my pet peeves is lukewarm soup.

I'm so glad we took a chance and went inside.  The space is tiny, call ahead for a seat.   The atmosphere reminded us of an intimate Italian restaurant in Florence.  The food was great, and our server was friendly and knowledgeable.     The Chef/Owner chatted with our table for a while and, upon learning it was our first visit, brought us a complimentary steaming platter of mussels which were plump & succulent (per my mother) and served in a spicy tomato sauce.  Be prepared for a lot of food - all entrees are served with a generous sized house salad or soup and the entree portions are big themselves.   The salad was pretty standard (iceberg lettuce / tomatoes).  The soups were a hit, especially the Stracciatella (a spinach soup).  Unfortunately, none of the soups used a vegetarian base. On to the entrees!  Lots of options for vegetarians, so that made me happy.  The Pumpkin Ravioli with Butter Sage Sauce was a table favorite.  This seasonal special had nice flavors and wasn't over-powering.  The Butter Sage sauce was the perfect complement to the pumpkin filling.   Two of my cousins shared an entree and the chef actually split it in back and put it on two plates for them (nice touch!).  Everyone was pleased with their entrees; the pasta dinners all were large portions so be prepared for leftovers! The restaurant offers a full bar, wine & beer.  The wine list is pretty limited though, for example - there were only two white wines offered and both were pinot grigio.   BOTTOM LINE:  Don't be fooled by the exterior, head inside for a great experience.  Free parking, delicious food and impeccable service make for a very enjoyable evening out.",0.9965,0.774,0.207,0.02,0.6432275132275131

He apologized for the delivery error. Talked about his business and how hard he worked. Eventually, I went to dinner at the restaurant. I'm pretty convinced the food came from a different kitchen. For one thing, the pasta was delicious (and warm). Some of the best arribiata I've ever had, and the marinara sauce tasted different - good. The service was good and much faster. Many of their other items were still painfully mediocre (special salad, anti-pasto, special chicken).  I'm utterly baffled. The restaurant experience was only an hour. My delivery took 3 hours. A second delivery to my friend's house who went with me to the restaurant took 2 1/2 hours. Again, the food was disgusting and cold.   Eat there and don't get delivery, unless you have time to kill and love the microwave. Also, the people who love this place are very defensive. Maybe 1 too many mafia movies or something, but it's like jumping into a Cubs/Sox debate.",0.9863,0.721,0.185,0.094,0.657915057915058
2007-08-28,5.0,"Who knew I would find my favorite Italian restaurant in a strip mall! I ate here for the first time on a whim because I was shopping in the area and spotted it. So glad I did. This TINY restaurant which was very obviously once a take-out joint has only about 6 tables but they added a fresh coat of paint, table cloths, and some nice art on the walls to make for a pleasant dinner environment.  The dinners come with bread and oil and soup or salad. I always get the minestrone soup and it is out of this world, especially when garnished with the wonderful parmesan they supply at your table. You can also buy large quantities to take home with you! The sauces are all fresh and so, so flavorful. I usually order the Gnocchi Piemontese which has a tomato cream sauce with mushrooms basil, basil, parsley, and romano. I seriously have a smile on my face the entire time I'm eating it.  The service is usually friendly, but sometimes the food can take a while. It's worth the wait though. I haven't tried their pizza but it looks really good and I hope to soon if I can only resist ordering the Gnocchi. ***Edit*** Have to add that the fettuccine alfredo is the best I've ever had.

2007-04-30,5.0,"The food at La Gondola is unbearably great. My most recent times eating here included a delivery of the grilled calamari and the bruschetta (I had eaten heavily earlier in the day and thus ordered appetizers). Both were fabulous. The grilled calamari was unexpectedly rich with flavor and a very unique dish. The bruschetta was perfect, as it should be. After that, a group of my friends and I went here for  a large dinner. I ate the veal piccante - beautiful, melt-in-yer-mouth veal in a sauce of roasted red peppers, tomatoes, sliced pepperocini, capers, and white wine. It was fantastic - a perfect blend of sweet, salty, savory, and a slightly pickled spiciness that I consumed in its entirety in no more than ten minutes. I am sure all the veal dishes at La Gondola are similarly succulent and I suggest them all. Veal, veal, veal. Oh, and a bottle of chianti classico is a great way to accompany anything. Only six tables; maybe make reservations? But they do deliver, and the delivery menu is more extensive (on paper) than the in-restaurant menu. However, anything on the delivery menu is available in house. Check out the website for some mind-boggling choices; its more about narrowing it down than honing in on one thing.",0.9893,0.82,0.17,0.01,0.5877267573696144

We went with the La Gondola Special...which had cheese, sausage, onions, green peppers and mushrooms. Crust was tasteless and they put way, waaay too much cheese on the pizza because everytime I picked up a slice everything came sliding off...which was really friggin frustrating.

I'm not giving it 5, b/c it was slightly cold when it arrived, but 5 minutes in the oven on low heat would have brought it right back.  (We were so hungry, we didn't bother.)  To La Gondola's defense, it was a crappy, rainy night last night and I'm sure a lot of people ordered delivery.  :)",0.7865,0.76,0.135,0.105,0.5657186948853616
2006-11-18,5.0,"La Gondola was something I found listed on grubhub when I was searching for some good delivery food a week or two ago; granted, I didn't end up ordering from here but the menu looked very appetizing so I kept it in the back of my mind. And boy, am I ever glad I did.  This place is located in a strip mall alongside your classic strip mall joints--- not where you'd think you'd find a 5 star quality Italian restaurant. What's especially misleading is the fact that their sign only proclaims ""La Gondola Pizzeria,"" which might lead others to believe it's solely a pizza joint (it's much more than that). The one thing that's convenient about this locale is plenty of free parking--- yahoo! For that reason, that's why my bf & I decided to drive on over and eat in. Granted, the dining room has a total of 7 small tables, but when we walked in around 8 on a Friday night, all were full. No problem--- within 15 minutes (and after a stroll around the Jewel to pass time, as there's really no standing room in the restaurant) we were able to sit down and enjoy our meal. (I feel like a majority of their business is take-out/delivery, as evidenced by the fact that you can order online through the website listed above. But, they do take reservations.) There was only one waiter in the place, but he was very attentive. We each ordered pasta dinners, which come w/soup (bf enjoyed the bowl [not a measly cup] of minestrone) or salad (all iceberg lettuce, but yummy possibly homemade creamy garlic dressing). My gnocchi in creamy pesto was fabulous, my bf loved his Rigatoni Boscaiola, and we both had enough left over to take home for a second meal (maybe b/c we had also loaded up on the fresh, warm bread that was brought out to the table when we first sat down). We ordered some dessert suggested by our server--- I think it was called lemon tartouffle (his accent was thick so I'm not sure?). Can't really describe it other than that it was the size of a scoop of ice cream, was frozen & delicious, and we were both licking our spoons.  Being the snoop I am (and hey, the place was small) I could hear the other patrons constantly complimenting on the food to the waiter, to their dining partners, and even saying that it was on the same level as restaurants such as Rosebud & others with fancy names I can't quite recall right now. Here is the clincher: this place is not expensive at all! The pasta dishes at least range $10-$12 (& as I mentioned earlier, are enough for 2 meals)--- the entree dishes aren't much more, around $12-$16.  They do have a liquor license as many were drinking wine (I just got a coke, as wine+mira after a long day of working w/preschoolers=pass out face down at the table) & I noticed a small bar. I also noticed that the restaurant menu differed from the carry-out menu in two respects: 1) It was much smaller and more limited & 2) It lacked the detailed descriptions of each dish that the carry-out menu had. No worries though--- you can order anything on the carry-out menu in the restaurant, you just have to ask (as I heard some other patrons do) so just go online & check out the menu beforehand, so you can get an idea of all they have to offer (which is a LOT)!",0.9933,0.863,0.106,0.032,0.5177917014759118
