A friend of mines and me who haven't caught up in a long time,  came here last night for the first time to chill,  eat and drink. We are ceative people and pretty chill, so we got lured in by the nice outward appearance. So we had to wait a long time to finally be served,  I almost had left cause I didn't have time to waste,  I am about the business,  but I was gonna give them the benefit of the doubt. I was in a good mood from earlier in the day.. despite the wait. So we order our food and drinks, then when our drinks are coming, the waitor gives my friend his drink, then givess off my drink to someone who ordered it at another table,  that was rude cause he was supposed to finish at our table. He asked who order the vodka and i raised my hand but he gave it to another table,  even after seeing me. Also when we got our food, we had received no utensils. On top of this, the music selection sucked badly. It was like some futuristic jungle music, definitely a buzz kill. The vodka was probably watered down because I barely tasted it,  I tasted more limed soda water. I hadn't been in Wicker Park for a while and wanted to see what else there was to do, I was traveling to many places,  but I wanted to go to some new good places back in my city. Unfortunately, this isn't a place I want to come back to and getting treated like this after traveling for so long. I had better service in other countries,  than here. I have never experienced the kind of service and treatment from this place from any other place in America, France, Russia or Guatemala.This service is even worse then the service I get at McDonald's in Chicago. I at first was thinking that some racism was going on, because we are two hispanics,  but now I've read many yelp reviews and noticed the constant trend of bad service. How embarrasing, I can't imagine how tourists would get treated and then they would judge Chicago based on something like that. Thats a lot of potential business that you guys would loose out on. Awful!. I wouldn't even dare to celebrate anything here nor do I wish this on my enemies..  I just to puke from how full I got from all of this negativity..  I keep it real from my perspective. That's why people question why businesses close down eventually,  because customers and their satisfaction comes first. If you do otherwise, nothing good will come from it. I gave my tip to the bus boy, because he was working hard and helped accommodate me better. Definitely a unique place for it's (bad) service in the wonderful Wicker Park area.

My friend made reservations for us weeks before, but when we walked in, it was so disorganized. The hostess told us we could sit anywhere we wanted by the back bar, there were no tables arranged for us, so we sat around the back bar, and waited, but then the waitress told us there was no bar tender at the back bar. There were a ton of people back there, and I was shocked that they didn't have a bar tender at the bar where every seat was taken. Oh well, the waitress came up and told us to let her know if we needed anything, and then we never saw her again, some of us went to the bar to get drinks, but I guess the waitress told the bar tender that we were supposed to get drinks from her, and the  bar tender refused to serve us, We were planning on being there for a couple of hours, I had one drink, wanted at least one more, but literally could not order it because of the poor service, so we ended up leaving and getting drinks at the next place.

It was basically just filled to the brim in B grade hummus. I couldn't even tell what the falafel itself tasted like.

It serves a valuable purpose in the neighborhood as being: 1.) decent food (though it can be hit or miss); 2.) decent service; 3.) not oozing with pretension in a neighborhood that is oozing with pretension; and 4.) not too crowded or pricey.  Northside was a reliable plan B or C when Plan A or Plan B was too crowded.  That being said, it was usually pretty full itself, though never to the extent of having a 45 minute-1hr wait like some trendier joints in the neighborhood do. The outdoor patio always has had a nice ambiance, especially in the afternoon, and most of the time it is relatively clean.  On a nice day in Chicago, it really can't be beat.  Indoors is a little more dank/divey but if you're just looking for a drink, it's not really a problem.   If you're in Wicker Park, and don't feel like shelling out $40+/person for a drink & brunch or lunch that will leave you hungry again in an hour, roll into Northside. My biggest complaints would be those occasions where the service was slow, or the waitress forgot something, or food would be under-cooked or over-cooked.  But like I said, I've eaten there dozens of times over many year, and issues were relatively rare.  Kudos for being solid and unremarkable, Northside!",0.9641,0.862,0.118,0.02,0.6046296296296296

And the mango chutney was a nice touch.

Great Great beer garden/front patio. It is super fun to sit on the outdoor bar. For a Saturday night it took quite some time to jump on a table. The crowd was a loud one but who isn't on a Saturday?  Drinks were average city priced but not as strong as some of their neighboring bars. Which is probably why we ended up leaving. If you are sitting inside the place is just not as fun.  3 stars for the atmosphere of the place...but that is it.,0.9009,0.836,0.135,0.029,0.4333333333333334

2011-05-14,1.0,"I need to start this review off by saying that I have a very laid-back and low-key family.  We're from Iowa; we don't need a lot of attention or over the top service to enjoy ourselves. That being said, Northside Bar and Grill was terrible. If I could give it negative stars I would.  I will start with the one redeeming quality of the restaurant and that would be it is really beautiful inside. I love the greenhouse look of it, minus the fact that the roof was leaking. Yes, that's right, the roof was leaking on myself and family during the meal. We pointed it out the waitress she said she was sorry and would be right back. She brought her manager out with her who instead of apologizing or moving us (the restaurant was half full) he told us that the roof had been leaking in that spot for twenty years and that's just the way it is. Um, ok, why not fix it? He basically told us to suck it up.  Personally, if it had been my restaurant I would have been mortified. I also don't think that the roof has been leaking for twenty years. This is Chicago; I have a hard time believing that for twenty years a roof that has leaked has not been fixed between the fifty feet of snow and rain that comes down each year. Also, Mr. Manager, don't tell us to just deal with it, I can deal with a lot of things, but getting rained on inside is not one of them. Basically his approach to the whole thing pissed me off, I don't think I'm being crazy by complaining about getting rained on. The food wasn't bad, however the waitress screwed up two of our orders (out of five). She messed up my brother's order by putting mushrooms and onions on it, when he asked for them to not be included. She didn't put my order in so I had to wait after everyone else was served. I should note that she blamed someone else for her mistakes, again not apology. At the end of service we were visibly annoyed. I'm upset that the service is so bad, because the restaurant itself is very nice, however between the constant mistakes of the wait staff and the manager who has clearly never heard the phrase, ""the customer is always right"", I don't think I will be returning.",-0.9593,0.825,0.063,0.112,0.5242884510125889

Everything about this place is seriously one notch away from being such a gem in Bucktown.  Not sure if the place is just getting tired or if this is how it's always been. Food - OK, but could be better.  We stayed to safe things like Nachos, Tomato Soup and Burgers as we heard not to get too adventurous from friends.  Some of the items on the menu are trying too hard.  You are a bar, give me straight chicken fingers, not weirdo chicken fingers. Drinks - OK, but could be better.  Soda and Tonic made drinks taste like their gun lines needed to be cleaned.  It just tasted like something was off... same thing with the beer on tap.  My Blue Moon tasted like yesterday's Miller Lite... Service, Not OK, needs to be a lot better.  Had 5 people at our table and each one of use was looking around on more than one occasion for another drink, to order food or even just for water. Atmosphere, GREAT!  Watched the Bears playoff game here, the game we won convincingly, not lost convincingly. Plenty of TV's, plenty of seating if you got there early, this is the one thing I can't complain about...

No wait and available tables at 9pm on a Friday night? That should have been my first clue. Hmmm, let's see here:  - Terrible, slow service.  - It took our server a good ten minutes to greet us, then another five to find us menus.  - By this point it was so bad we debated bailing before our drinks made it to our table. We should have - we had plenty of time, because did I mention service was slow?  - When I did get my drink it was completely watered down.  - Food options are not great. When my friend and I decided to split the mini angus burger, I guess I was expecting something that didn't resemble a McDonald's hamburger in look and taste. The ""natural"" fries were actually good though, so I will give them credit for that. (And no trans fat!)  - They offer unhealthy options with sandwiches disguised as healthy options. Their veggie choices last night SOUNDED healthy, but if you stopped and thought about it they weren't because most of them were coated with a glaze that equaled sugar, sugar, sugar.  - They have plenty of TV's tuned to various things, so that's a plus. The TV in my line of vision played the Men's Shake Weight commercial at least 10 times, and I couldn't stop laughing. If you haven't seen it, behold: youtube.com/watch?v=xbsS…  - The crowd is... not my scene. Not a cute boy in sight. Douchebaggery at its finest. I'll pass.  - Loud music, and not even good music.

I felt bad  as she worked the bar and service line all night. I'm sure not too much fun when the place is packed on  Wed night  and Hawks fans.  Tried the nachos and happy we ordered extra guac. They were really good! I am sure we will all be back again soon now that the weather is nice and we can sit on the indoor/outdoor patio.,0.9728,0.73,0.225,0.044,0.5673202614379086
2010-05-21,2.0,Main reason to go to this place is for the large open patio and the location. Food is edible but nothing to yelp about and the well drinks lacked a bit in the alcohol department so I switched to vodka on the rocks and axed the well drinks. My advice would be to use this place as a starter bar because of nice patio area and then go to a cheaper place to get buzzed. Probably a much better place to go for afternoon drinking in the summer.,0.872,0.832,0.137,0.031,0.5523809523809524

The first place we tried had a really long wait so we moved onto the Northside Bar and Grill. I was not disappointed. We found a table very easily at the patio at the front of the bar. There's also a huge outdoor area to the side of the bar. We ordered chips and salsa and the wings (which were half off). Everything we ordered was delicious. There was tons of salsa with the chips and the wings seemed more baked instead of fried. I'd highly recommend checking out Northside on a nice summer night!,0.9843,0.775,0.225,0.0,0.5945098039215686

2010-05-05,2.0,"I decided to pop my yelp cherry after a group of friends and I decided to stop at Northside for a few of our standard Thursday night beverages back in early April. I'm just now getting around to mopping up the collective cherry pulp and reviewing our experience. let me preface this review with the fact that I'd been to northside two times prior to our most recent visit.   the first time was for dinner with my wife (non-wife at the time) over a year ago.  we sat outside and enjoyed a few brews along with a grilled something and some fried something on the side.  it was good.  not great, but good. the second time was with my sister after a tuesday night white sox game.  this time we sat at the bar and proceed to kill brain cells. the most recent visit is the one I am reviewing.   my wife voted to 'go someplace with a beer garden' so that we could enjoy the pleasant spring evening.  we elected northside because it was fairly convenient for everyone to get to and it has a sizeable outdoor space.   so we get there before our friends and put our name in for a table.   northside immediately lost points because of a few crappy songs.  I honestly can't remember what they were, and I'm not going to just make something up, but it wasn't good. northside (and one of the bartenders) then proceeded to more than make up for the crappy music when they played a black keys track (off of chulahoma no less!) and I purchased a cane and ebel from a bartender in a black keys t-shirt. all the friends arrived and we were seated.  the waitress proceeded to screw up my friend's beer order twice.  he was ordering the cane and ebel and was receiving the special.  I can understand the mix-up the first time because the special was also a two brothers brew.  but the second time was a head scratcher.  I proceeded to order another cane and ebel and received the special.  she blamed the bartender.  I blame the flake in the purple hippie dress. now, for the money shot.  my wife ordered nachos.  we waited over an hour for these nachos.  upon being reminded of the nacho order the waitress brought over a cold plate of soggy chips and brown guacamole.  not kinda brown / kinda green.  brown.  100% brown.  the color of poo.  normal poo.  when asked to return the nachos it was clear that the waitress knew they weren't up to par... and yet, she served them! nachos went back, no replacement nachos required, bill requested.   the nachos were still on the bill.   the bill went back, nachos taken off.  the bill was paid and we left knowing we won't come back.   sure I had two positive experiences and one poor one.  but the positive experiences were in the OK range and the poor one was in the craptacular range.   northside gets two stars, one star without the black keys.  hippie waitress with gobs of personality gets zero.",0.9643,0.799,0.116,0.085,0.3944370821921844

Usually, I pick a tried and true to impress, but I wanted a spot close to the blue line with a decent special.  I took a deep breath, consulted all my resources, and picked Northside, primarily for their $3 Sierra Nevadas and $2 tacos on Monday nights. Good special means this chica will usually show up.  And show up we did. We weren't interested in trivia (another Monday night offer), but we did partake in the trivia taco special. For $2, you could get TWO tacos with your choice of meat (or veggies). Two tacos. I mean, they were no Las Traspasada tacos, but for $2, I say, ""Doin' it."" Same with the Sierra Nevada special.

Another positive- once the bartender took care of me once- he had my order ready to go before I even had to ask on subsequent trips in from the outside.  As soon as he saw me approaching he was lining up the cocktails- Nice! Sat outside for a couple of hours watching the world go by.  Several people around us ordered food which looked good so I will need to try that the next time I go.  Bucktown has alot of places to sit around and meet with your friends.  On a sunny , summer day- this could easily become one of my favorites!",0.9913,0.803,0.173,0.025,0.37222843822843826

What I've learned over time is that the colorful regulars who were drinking there before the neighborhood became a hot-spot for popped collars and white baseball hats are priceless. On any given Friday or Saturday night the second bar is populated with friendly people and a couple of brilliant DJs. The music is usually an eclectic mix of 80's pop and new wave, indie rock and old school hip hop. Drink prices are average to a little pricey, but the bartenders are great and the food is delicious. Everything from the hummus to the hot wings is enjoyable, not to mention a surprisingly good calamari plate.",0.9704,0.821,0.162,0.017,0.4914673046251994
