2017-09-02,4.0,"Came here on a Friday evening. Was a very lively crowd, about an hour wait for 3 of us (ended up being about 40 minutes). Stood in the bar area and had beers ($3 tecates!!!) and chips and guacamole and salsa. Guacamole was unreal good, chips were decent (but not the really really good kind), and salsa was not good. One red smoky flavored one, and a green salsa (which is usually my fave) but just didn't hit. Shared a pitcher of margaritas, they were okay. I've definitely had better, just tasted like a mix which is always disappointing. Tacos were great! Had a fish taco and a steak taco. Friends got the pork belly and the pastor and the fish as well, everyone was pleased. Pretty basic street taco style, 2 tacos was perfect with drinks, big appetites would need 3-5 but they aren't crazy priced ($3-5 each). Fun vibes probably keep this place as popular as it is.",0.9945,0.669,0.296,0.035,0.5791666666666666
2017-09-01,3.0,"5 stars for the food, but 2 stars for the staff. The food is amazing, hands down. We've been here multiple times and ate our way through the menu, top to bottom, back and forth and it's consistently great. My personal favorite is the fish taco, it's sooooo good, and they serve a big chunk of fish! However, the staff seems the be constantly in a weird mood. Maybe I'm just having bad luck, but every time we've been here we had a strange encounter. The last time around, our waitress  would simply not show up. We would have to ask other waiters if they could take our order, or if they could bring us the check. They would then tell our waitress who was just casually hanging out at the bar making goggly eyes to another waiter. But clearly not doing her job. Another time someone mentioned that the tacos come with cilantro and I should order them that way, and not have it removed. What an odd thing to say: half the tacos come with cilantro and you can't expect everyone to like it. I also don't think that cilantro will be the game changer of the dish: either the taco is good, or it's not. But if you add cilantro to my taco then it will be a bad taco for me, guaranteed.",0.9726,0.788,0.147,0.065,0.45163906142167004

Dark , dark , dark , dark place.  She absolutely would not look our way as much as we shouted. And hey, we shouted. Just to order food . So let it be known, the service , kinda erratic. I know it can stink being on the other side of the bar, but don't agree to it then, ok?  Ok. So consider yourself warned and stuff. Ok we went back and Blerg. Ceviche special had no lime and was raw. The waitress got our order wrong - gave us chicken tacos when we ordered fish. The sound, whoa, was really bad. Speakers were terrible. Are they new? Cuz sheesh , they stink.

It tastes really natural and not overly sweet.   -The guac was super fresh, and I loved both of the spicy salsas that were served with the chips.   -The large outdoor seating area is ideal for the warmer months.   -The fish taco was my favorite taco out of the three different ones I tried.       -The service was really fast (considering how busy it was).  The tacos came out about 5 minutes after ordering.   The one negative thing from my experience: -I really wish they would add some black beans or rice to the menu as a side.   A taco dinner doesn't feel complete to me without one or both of those sides.",0.9869,0.754,0.214,0.032,0.561525974025974
2017-08-24,5.0,"I've never eaten at the restaurant, only the walk up window, so my review only pertains to that section of Big Star. They are always super nice, and the food comes quickly. Only downer is that the walk up window is CASH ONLY! I always get my food within 5 minutes, and the sit down area is perfect for a quick lunch on a nice day. One of my favorites is the Pescado taco, but because it's fried, you'll want to eat it first because it just isn't the same soggy. The pastor is freakin' fantastic, and I love the little bit of pineapple on top. I am also all about the chorizo taco and the steak taco. The only taco that I've had from here that I wasn't a fan of was the zanahoria (carrot), but I suppose for those vegetarians out there it's nice to have that option. I'm such a big fan of the walk up window, I have made it my mission to eat in the sit down section ASAP, and I will update my review when I do.",0.9718,0.824,0.15,0.025,0.6546717171717172

This was by far one of the best recommendations! Visiting from New York, we always get a variety of food, but Big Star is something else. It is a family style taco spot where you can choose any of their unique tacos. We ended up getting the following tacos: - Taco De Panza- this wasn't a bad combo, braised pork belly with tomato guajillo sauce. - Taco Al Pastor- the grilled pineapple goes well with the marinated roasted pork shoulder. - Taco De Pescado- Delicious beer battered tilapia fillet. You can taste every inch of crispiness! We got three rounds of this! - Taco De Chorizo Discada- my husband said this was his least favorite. - Taco Alambre De Res- grilled steak- how could you go wrong? so gooood! My husband also ordered a beer (lone star) and a drink. I can't remember the names of either or, but he absolutely loved both!  Overall, great and friendly staff and the food is banging!

Barback was attentive in giving water but no greeting. Bartender took another 4 minutes to finally walk over to take my order and the orders of the people around me. He took my order and asked if I wanted a glass w my beer. I said I'd be ok without one. I watched as he opened the fridge to grab one and another bottle fell out. He went to grab it off the floor and placed it back into the cooler, then proceeded to open my can without washing his hands. I saw his hands touch the rim of the can. Needless to say I changed my mind and asked for a glass. Food was delicious! But when it came time to end the meal, I was curious if there might be dessert. I made eye contact w the bartender to signal that I had a question. He stood there 6 feet away expecting me to yell across the bar. He answered with knowledge and even some emotion/humanity. I asked for the bill and paid. Meanwhile the bartender didn't even thank me for coming in nor did he bid a farewell. On the screen to pay I had to choose a pre-determined tip starting at 18%. I wish I could have left less. Sadly I regret coming into big star this time around.

2017-08-22,3.0,"This place is trendy and fun, but the food could be a lot better. Tacos are my favorite food group, and if you're specializing in them, they better be stellar. My favorite part about going to Big Star is the part when we leave and go to Jeni's! A place that ROCKS at what they specialize in!  Favs:  -They have Lone Stars here!!!  -The margs are strong and nice and everyone I go with usually enjoys them.  -Al Pastor - hard to mess this one up  -Walking Taco - I appreciate that they have this comfort food!  Mehs:  -Panza - the meat is perfectly tender but always a little too salty (and I love salty) -Pescado - okay, but Antique Taco down the street does it better -Chorizo - too salty and the meat is always a little burnt  My opinion on the taco places in this area:  1. Antique Taco  2. Tamale Spaceship  3. Big Star  4.

2017-08-20,4.0,"I had a decent experience at Big Star. We ordered chips, salsa, and guacamole to start. The red salsa had a lovely smoky flavor. The guacamole was good but nothing to write home about. For drinks, I tried both a paloma and a margarita. Both were enjoyable but again, nothing special. I do not eat meat or dairy, so I ordered the potato taco without cheese, and the carrot taco without the yogurt sauce. Points to Big Star for the unique nature of these items. The typical vegetarian taco option is beans, maybe mushrooms if you're lucky. I really enjoyed the carrot one in particular. But, I've had more interesting fillings like tofu or jackfruit elsewhere. My meat-eating dinner companion enjoyed the three tacos he ordered. Service was friendly and we were seated promptly on the very spacious patio. The music was a little too loud for my liking but we could still carry on a conversion okay. I got the sense that if you were there late on a Friday or Saturday night, it might be the sort of place where it could get reeeeally loud. But I can't say for sure. I'll probably go back, mostly because I really liked the large patio, and the tacos were pretty good.",0.9937,0.759,0.218,0.022,0.5557407407407408

She was so sweet, very responsive via email, and really made us feel so relaxed about the whole thing! Jennifer was knowledgeable about food truck weddings and had a lot of great suggestions from past experiences.  We used Big Star for our appetizers, bar service, and dinner (one of the two food trucks we had). All of the staff from Big Star was amazing, our guests raved about how nice and efficient they were.

As we approached what seemed to be the host stand there was a lot of people around it was hard to figure out if they were waiting to talk to the host like we were or just standing around. But eventually around the crowd we got to the hostess, she put me down for 2 and with my phone number she mentioned she would text me when my table was ready. Sweet, so no need to stand around. We headed to the bathrooms but in the entrance there was a men asking for our ID's which was odd but then I asked what he needed them for, he said it was if we decided to have something in the bar, oh okay. The bathrooms in this place are just plain weird they have two tiny bathrooms and a large stall with writing all over the doors. Eventually we headed to the bar, we saw the menu and went for the micheladas one with Tecate & one with Pacifico for a surprising price of $14 . They didn't give any receipt so perhaps there was an up charge for changing the beer. We waited exactly 35 minutes for them to text us that our table was ready, we were impatient and looking online for other options close by.  Once we got to the table we were starving and just wanted to order. The server didn't take long to come ask us if we wanted something or needed more time, oh no we were ready to go. Started with the famous walking taco (really good) and the queso fundido. They were delicious! We also had the salsas, they were okay.  Then we finished it off with 7 tacos! Wow, so many flavors.

I go here during off-times so I can get a table and not wait. I think this place has the best Micheladas in town!  I love the spicy hot sauce in it, which is the main feature.  It's also really well-priced at $6.  Every other place I have had a Michelada at has failed in comparison to Big Star. I also love their chips, guacamole and salsa.  Their guacamole is fresh, lime-flavored, and very tasty.  I also really enjoy their red salsa that comes with the chips/guacamole platter.  The serving is pretty generous so be sure to bring your appetite.   I really appreciate that they have good vegetarian and pescatarian options.  The walking taco is by far my favorite, it sounds weird being in a Frito's bag, but it tastes so good with the tomato sauce, the refried, beans, Frito's, and cheese.  It's such a gluttonous combination.  My other favorite taco is their fish taco which is a decently-sized piece of fried fish served with aioli and cabbage.  I have also had their potato taco, which tastes good, but is pretty lite and is not as exciting as the two other tacos I mentioned.

2017-07-17,5.0,"Big Star Tacos, a place I've been wanting to try and a place for the books. Firstly, the location is perfect. It is surrounded by a variety of restaurants and cafés and is in a central location in Wicker Park.  There are two parts to the restaurant. One part leads to the main restaurant area which typically requires waiting in line or there is another section where you can order tacos to go with plenty of outside seating available. If you are coming for a quick bite to eat, I would highly recommend ordering the tacos in the to go area as the menu items available is exactly the same as the restaurant menu. I have been wanting to try the Taco de Zanahorias which has carrots, chipotle date yogurt, and sprinkled seeds, and my family ordered the Walking Taco. The Walking Taco is a classic taco that is famous to big star tacos and is served in a Fritos bag with corn chips, bean dip, and other ingredients. We were able to find seats in the shade to enjoy our tacos. One thing I appreciate about this menu is that there are plenty of vegetarian options which can be rare for taco places. I really enjoyed my tacos as I felt that the ingredients were a unique combination that tasted delicious together. For a quick bite the tacos were very filling, but if you are hungry for a meal I would recommend ordering more than just two tacos. My family was raving about the Walking Tacos and said that it is one to surely try.

Everything ran so smoothly on the big day, and every one that I interacted with from Big Star were great. Jenn coordinated everything from the wait staff, to the bar and even rentals.

2017-06-23,3.0,"I went here a couple days ago with some friends for the first time. The place looks very nice great outdoor seating and we can even bring pets. It was very busy even for a Wednesday night. They do not take reservations. Despite not taking reservations, we only waited about ten minutes. We were not seated outside even though we requested it. Once we were seated we waited about fifteen minutes before the waitress even introduced herself to us. We ordered drinks to start and she came back the order surprisingly fast. However, she brought us a pitcher with no cups. She then didn't come back to check on us for another fifteen minutes. By then she realized that she didn't bring us cups. It was already too late. We improvised and chugged the water we had and used those cups. We all order our tacos (surprisingly pretty decent), and came with it rather quickly. However, there were six people in our party and all of us ordered three tacos each they put ALL THE TACOS ON ONE PLATE instead of giving us our tacos on our own plate. Then she attempted to tell us which taco is which but it was extremely difficult for her to tell as well as us. I think everyone should get their own plate with the tacos they ordered so people in the future can avoid this problem. Some of us are the wrong taco because we just couldn't tell which is which. She then said she had only been there three months and she's sorry. In my opinion if you've been there three months you should have a pretty good handle on what you're doing. All in all the tacos were decent and the service was poor. I don't know if I'd ever go back there again honestly.",0.4036,0.849,0.084,0.067,0.6178395061728394

The patio is a great spot whether you're in the shade or under the warm sun. We ordered the Al Pastor, Chicken, and Fish Tacos. All of them were awesome! We appreciated that even though the tacos only had one tortilla, the Taco didn't fall apart at all! Usually taco places use two tortillas to hold everything together. Since there was less tortilla, each bite had more flavor from the meat and garnishes/sauces. The Al Pastor was super savory with a hint of sweetness from the pineapple chunks-super good The Chicken was juicy and tender with some sauce and geese to top it off-good The Fish Tacos were perfectly battered with a drizzle of chipotle Mayo that made every bite mouth watering. Would have ordered two more of these if we weren't so full already! The drinks here are also tasty, they aren't the strongest, but they are refreshing and pair very well with the food.

The fish tacos were nice, fresh, hot and crispy, but overall lacking. Paying per taco, I would expect more flare and flavor, and overall most tacos I've tried here never ""Wow'd'"" me. The margarita was mainly salt water, it wasn't strong, and wasn't worth nine dollars. I DO NOT recommendation getting a traditional margarita with salt, the salt is obnoxiously too much and ruins the drink. Overall, for the price it is not worth coming here. There ordering/paying system is awkward and the waitresses even seemed confused. This time aroun I ordered a nine dollar margarita, a four dollars fish taco, with a three dollar shot. Somehow my order while paying amount to being over 30$. It's my mistake not noticing it at the time and speaking up, but afterwards when I realized this I felt ripped off.

However, considering their customer service experience, the restaurant should change it's name to BLACK HOLE aka a DYING STAR. Well, of course there's a reason: Initially I was having a lovely time on my first friend date drinking and eating interestingly composed tacos, there wasn't really a problem. The server could have come around more often because we hadn't seen her in at least 30 min, a few times. We were going to order more food, a loss on money for the restaurant, but she was not around.  Later, we had a new server, and no one told us that the initial one was going home. We got the check, which is done on an iPad, and wanted to split the tab down the middle. NORMAL RIGHT? Wrong, this girl charged me for the entire check, 'went to get a code from [her] manager' to redo the transaction, and she proceeded to charge me for half the bill. She did the same for my friend. The server told me, 'since we used that code, it will only charge you for half the bill, and it won't hit your account till the end of the night.' Okay lady, thanks.  Next morning, I had to pay some bills. To my disappointment, they charged me for the entire bill. ANNOYING. I texted my friend, 'did you get charged, cause they charged for the entire bill.' She told me she was charged. LMAO LIKE IM SORRY DONT CHARGE YOUR CUSTOMERS 150% OF WHAT THEY OWE.  I called them, no one picked up. Classic. I'm getting an idea of how they treat their customers. I leave a voicemail explaining the situation, and tell them to call me back to remedy this issue.  They didn't call me back, and they slyly changed the amount in my bank account.

2017-05-21,4.0,"Visiting family in Chicago, this was the neighborhood spot they were raving about! Walking up this restaurant is an eclectic, funky spot a few convenient steps from the blue line. There's a walkup to order tacos to go if you need a quick bite. They ID you outside before being seated. They have a nice outside patio, but we were seated inside. The inside spot is pretty crowded. Pull a chair out and hit the chair behind you crowded. Weave through the sea of people to the bathroom and try not to hit someone or get in a waitress' way crowded. The service is super quick. We ordered chips and salsa with guacamole ($8) for the table. Guac was good. Salsa is a mild chipotle salsa, and a peppery green chili salsa. The price seemed kind of high, and the chips aren't replenished like other Mexican restaurants. For a big group you probably need two of these baskets. The tacos are sold per taco, and range anywhere between 3 and 5 bucks per taco. If you're looking for a good old fashioned authentic taco, this is probably not your place. If you want an outstanding Walking Taco, this is your place. The chicken taco came with almonds and a sesame sauce, which made it too nutty and gritty for me. Not my favorite. The alambre de res taco was super spicy, even though the menu didn't specify it was going to be burn your mouth off hot. For someone who doesn't eat pork, the menu wasn't super varied. There were a lot of choices if you like pork or chorizo. Hubby said the pork belly taco was pretty good. If I go back, I'd try the potato taco and get the walking taco again. I had one of their whiskey mixed drinks since I'm not a tequila fan. It was ok. Nothing fantastic for $10. Overall, it's a funky, designer taco joint.

Didn't take long for someone to come and take our order. We got 3 chicken tacos. 2 fish tacos and 1 steak taco. I guess I really can't complain about the price but it still is a bit price for pretty small tacos. They try to fill you up with chips first so don't fill yourself with the chips if you get it. The tacos were amazing. Okay really good freaking tacos but probably not amazing. The fish taco was great and the chicken taco was seasoned so perfectly. I assume they use chicken thighs and not chicken breast.,0.9904,0.708,0.266,0.027,0.7298245614035087

Two (2) hours) However, if you plan your evening right, the wait is well worth the time. Tonight, April 23, 2017, my party of three was served by Manny, what a great guy! The service Manny provided was outstanding. When I say outstanding, I do not mean to imply perfect because Manny had several tables, including ours. With that said, he was outstanding. The Queso Fundido, Tacos, and Pitchers (yes, pitchers) came right on time. Tiffany, was also a great host! This beautiful bride was a breath of fresh air. Tiffany was hospitable and understanding. My party started at the bar, moved to a high top, and then to our reserved table. Even though Tiffany did not get tipped from our time at her table, she remained in good spirits and very hospitable. Big Star is an establishment consistent with the level of service and accountability. I respect the owner because the establishment would not be what it is without the owner's support of its amazing staff members.

2017-04-23,4.0,"I came for the tacos, but stayed for the drinks on the patio. Vibes are really great when everybody is stuffing their faces with tacos while downing pitchers of margaritas, go figure.  The taco prices are a bit higher than usual, sure, but they're at least stuffed to the brim with tasty fillings, so the value is at least fair.   Three tacos are normally enough to satisfy me.  Four tacos if I'm starving, and five tacos if I hate myself.  Anyway, on to the -- Tacos: AL PASTOR: These are my favorite tacos al pastor in the city so far.  Great balance of salty, sweet, and savory. STEAK:  Surprisingly really good.  They got this super creamy sauce on top of it that really made it for me. PORK BELLY: Salty, dry, and underwhelming. They definitely get it crispy, but it was at the price of losing a ton of moisture.  Steer clear of this one.   THE WALKING TACO:  Also surprisingly tasty.  Get this for the drunken novelty of it.   FISH TACO:  It ain't no fish taco from San Diego, but it holds its own pretty well.  Average, I'd say.

2017-04-15,2.0,"I had a very negative experience at Big Star today. Don't get me wrong the food was great, as was my server, but I was harassed multiple times by one of the employees. My girlfriend and I brought our dog in today for what we'd been told was a dog friendly patio. We were seated at a table with 3 chairs, in a crowded area on the patio.  Our dog, who is all of 12 pounds, we were told to move because he was blocking a walk path to a side area. We thought this was ridiculous, but complied, and moved him into a chair on the other side of the table.  Fifteen minute later, we were told that chair was blocking another walkway and the same employee aggressively told us to move our dog to the ground while taking the chair away. At this point, the dog was moved to our lap, but he was still thirsty for water. We asked the table behind us if we could use their extra chair to put a bowl of water down on for our dog. Again the employee came up to us, rudely took the chair, and went on a power trip. He told us he was a manger, had half a mind to kick us out, and we'd been a problem since we got there. We brought a lap dog to a supposed dog friendly patio and got harassed for it. He was not bothering anyone or taking up much space, yet due to our seating arrangement this supposed manager ""want to be bouncer"" decided he wanted to take control. He had us move our dog twice, and then told us the dog couldn't sit in our lap and he was doing us a favor because a dog in lap is not allowed.   I was told the name of the employee was Reese or Royce. If you think this may be just one frustrated customer, the table next to us as well as random bystanders witnessing the situation felt he was out of line. After he was gone, they came up and informed us he treated them unprofessionally as well. The employee should be reprimanded, and I'm someone who usually give wait staff benefit of doubt for minor issues. This was not that and I felt offended.",-0.945,0.824,0.072,0.104,0.3630676328502415

2017-04-09,3.0,"Big Star, named after 70s power pop group Big Star (I'm not sure if this is true), is probably one of the most well-known places in Wicker Park, and I had high hopes going into this place. As a California native who has eaten many tacos, I wasn't impressed. The prices for tacos are a bit high to note. It's $4 per taco. You could normally get way more tacos than that elsewhere - and better too. I got four tacos - Panza, Al Pastor, Alambre de Res, and Chorizo Cordero. I found the chorizo (a mix of lamb and pork chorizo) too salty. The panza was ok, but nothing memorable. I found the al pastor good, but not $4 good. I think the only taco I was really impressed with was the alambre de res, so I may find the time to just grab one of those to-go on a late night escapade. I also got the horchata, and wasn't impressed. The ambiance is probably pretty good. If you want to stop by for a drink and some tacos, this would be a great place to do so. However, I'll also note that it's Chicago and windy and that doesn't make for the best taco eating experience. I may be back, but mainly for the steak taco.

2017-04-03,3.0,"This place is ground zero for hipster tacos. Imagine with me if you can a time when there wasn't taco's at every high, middle, and low-end restaurant in Chicago. A time when if one wanted Mexican food, one must traverse to the ethnic enclaves of the city to order off handwritten poster board menus, mispronouncing things, and guessing at ingredients. Tacos would be served in a plastic basket on top of simple wax paper. You may sit on a rough wood table or stand against a deli counter to eat. Maybe you'd slug down a beer or whiskey with your lunch- there isn't many options so you'll just take what they have to offer. Staff may not be the friendliest, but getting their attention and ordering is half of the experience. Yes, I know millennials- it's hard to understand what this was like because it wasn't documented on Instagram. But guess what- Big Star has re-created that entire experience for you!!!!!!! And for like, triple the price!!!!! You GET to wait in line (a line that often stretches around the block) to sit outside on picnic tables and slightly rickety outdoor furniture, order off a one sheet menu, to eat little tacos made out of things you can't pronounce, served in plastic baskets and off wood serving trays!!!!! (all those exclamation points means it's super fun) They have an extensive whisky and beer menu- most of which you have never heard of unless you are super cool and into craft everything. And unlike those mom and pop cash-only places -what's cash? it's 2017 after all- servers will ring you up at your table with their ipads.

Other: -Probably expect to order three to four tacos to make a meal (about $2.50 to $4 each). -People were complaining about not getting free chips and salsa.  Eh.  If you understood what it takes to make a good salsa, you wouldn't complain.  It's not a cheap taco shop.  $3 for a basket and two salsas. -People were complaining that the tacos were small.  They are normal ""street"" sized tacos.  I guess they are used to Tex-Mex tacos. -My husband and I (both over 6' tall) were placed at a two-top near a window where we had no leg room, and had to ask to switch tables.  This was not a problem, but seemed odd that the tall host didn't seem to think better of where to place us.",0.8647,0.822,0.107,0.071,0.5494495647721455

2017-03-16,1.0,"I have not done a review in a long time but I feel that this was necessary.  Before I begin I'd like to state that I've been to all of the One Off Hospitality restaurants, and had an absolutely wonderful experience at all of them.  Unfortunately Big Star is the one exception.   Two days ago my buddy and I stopped in for a few midnight snacks and from the moment we walked in it was already off to a rough start.  I saw some open seats at the bar and asked if we could take them.  The host denied us and sat us at a table saying that those seats were reserved but the rest of the night I did not see a single person occupy those seats.  The food looked promising even at $4 a taco, which by most Mexican restaurant standards is overpriced but I assumed it was priced that way because they use high quality ingredients.  But no complimentary chips and salsa? Seriously?  Any place that serves Mexican food that's worth its salt serves you at least one complimentary basket of chips with salsa.  It took way too long for our server to even touch our table once, especially since she passed by us multiple times before actually taking our order.  She had a terrible attitude.  She was clearly not happy to be there and rolled her eyes at us when we had questions about the menu items.  Too be fair it seemed like she was the only server on the floor since she seemed to be making rounds around the restaurant attending to guests in all sections, and occasionally stopping to chat with the bar.  Our food arrived in a timely manner but as soon as we chowed down we found several flaws with the tacos.  First of all the tortillas were cold, second they were single layer tortillas, and third they were the smallest tacos I've ever had (where were the burn marks from the comal?).  The meat was okay, honestly I could get pastor and asada at a better quality for much less at the Mexican place down the street from my house (and they serve pizza).  The panza was unique and tasty but panza tastes better in menudo. Last but not least when we wanted to close out our server gave us attitude because we wanted to split the check based on what we ate.  She just left her tablet on the table and walked away.  For the amount I paid for three tacos ($15 plus 18% tip) I could have had a whole torta and two tacos on top that at any authentic late night Mexican place.  I went to the 7/11 across the street after that and had three tacitos because I just wasn't satisfied with my meal.  Will not be returning to Big Star.",0.9754,0.85,0.097,0.053,0.42989774114774115

It makes a world of difference when your service treats you like a guest rather than an obligation, and in an area where most of my service has been, um, sub-par, it ensures my repeat business!

2017-03-07,3.0,"Tacos here come in a family style platter, though mosts of the time you'll make your orders individually. They range from $2.5-4 and are on the smaller side, which in Chicago is still reasonable for gourmet tacos. You'll probably end up buying 3-4 tacos for a meal, though if you really want to stuff yourself the orders will just keep coming. The most popular ones tend to be the Al Pastor and the Pescado, both which I ordered, along with a walking taco. The Al Pastor was well-seasoned, but wasn't particularly tender. Most of my pieces were in fact pretty dry. This hopefully was an outlier as most of my friends enjoyed it. As far as the Pescado...the fish itself was flaky and juicy, but otherwise the taco was unremarkable. To be honest, I think the tacos down the street at antique taco tasted better, though they were also more expensive and required two to an order. The other appeal with Big Star are the drinks, particularly the margs. On their own they're $9-10, though a pitcher which is 6 drinks is $36. The margs here are fairly strong too, and with 1-2 down you can definitely get a good buzz on. This place is packed most every day, and between family style tacos and drinks it has the sort of atmosphere that makes it very appealing for get-togethers small and large.

2017-02-28,3.0,"I have gotten a number of recommendations for this place and so I finally decided to stop in this past Sunday.  My ultimate goal was to make it home for the Oscars, so that meant a takeout order. Process: There's a smaller section adjacent to the restaurant that you place your order. Order on one side, receive the electronic device and wait. It was a short line so I waited there. Wait time was about 10 mins  The young ladies there were nice and had great customer service.  Food: I ordered the pork belly and steak tacos, chips and salsa and an Horchata. The tacos are small.  So I could easily see someone who is really hungry ordering 3 unless you have other food to supplement.  I'm not the biggest fan of corn tortillas (I prefer flour) but these work for the choice of meat. Pork Belly, I thought was just ok. The steak however was more magical and left me wishing I had gotten two of them. Chips and Salsa ! Good and good Horchata... I've had better.  Though I only enjoyed the pleasure of the outside cafe this is nice restaurant in the area if you want a good sit down place that serves tacos and some Mexican inspired dishes. Perhaps for the visiting relatives or a business meeting.

It has a lot of hype around it and is known as the cool spot to be seen and go in Wicker Park, especially during the summer due to the patio. Staff is generally unpleasant and act as though they are doing you a favor by allowing you to spend your money there. Due to the demand for a spot to eat there they have lost any sense of hospitality. Menu is fairly limited, but food is good. A bit over priced for the quality in my opinion. Overall I can't justify waiting over a hour to be served over priced tacos by some rude server. I've never spoken to a Chicago native who truly likes this place.

Went here on a weekend with about 5 other people and the place was so crowded you could barely get in the door let alone a table, which I guess is expected for the weekend here? We were able to find a tiny spot on the wall which had a little counter to eat but no chairs. We were definitely getting pushed and shoved standing here since it was next to the kitchen expo and sort of on the way to the bathroom depending which way you took, but we decided to stick it out. For it being so packed and the fact I was about to stand and eat at a little counter that I needed to defend with my life for the next hour and a half I was expecting amazing authentic tacos. I was disappointed when my al pastor and Carne asada taco came ($3-4.50 each). All in all appearance and taste was decently good, however I much rather would have went to a hole in the wall place that served up cheaper, more authentic tacos at probably an 1/8th of the wait time. They were honestly kind of mediocre. Although tasty, there was nothing special about them, and I think they could have loaded them up more with each ingredient given the prices. Also the tortillas were not a great texture; comparable to the corn tortillas that have been sitting in my fridge for months: not warm and crispy, but floppy and bland it kind of took away from my meal. The cocktails were scrumptious, my friends kept ordering drinks because they were well-crafted and tasty. We had to order from the bar and didn't have an actual sever, but the entire bar staff was very attentive and accommodating especially for such a busy night I give the staff an A+.

As usual and as expected, there was a wait. We walked around Wicker Park and came back about 45 minutes later. We got a drink and waited some more (typically, 45 minutes is the average wait time). After an hour, my friend asked if we were close to being called and we were told there was 30 parties ahead of us! Really!! There were many available tables for small parties, we were only a party of 3. I was ready to leave but we did not because my friends ordered a Margarita pitcher. I went to the bar to order something to eat because by this time, almost 2 hours later, I was feeling dizzy...I was not drunk dizzy, I was hungry dizzy. Bartender was practically useless. I asked a female waitress if I could order something to eat and although she hesitated, she took my order. Waited about another 15 minutes for one taco. Seriously after this experience, I am certain I will never eat at Big Star.

We asked for waters to start and our server brought us 1 water.... this validated my assumption that our server was higher than a giraffes pussy. We then moved on to ask the hostess for a water and he brought us a pitcher.... how generous. Our server could've used the water, not us. Finally it was time to dive into our chips and salsa along with the queso /chorizo dip. The salsa was sub par at best and the chorizo dip was mediocre. The chicken tacos come from the thigh region, who the hell wants a thigh piece of chicken? I think most prefer white chicken but maybe that's my preference. The al pastor tacos did satisfy my hunger but they smelled like a donkeys ass if you ask me. And the fact that it was darker than night inside it was hard to tell what was actually in front of us. Now, the one reason I give the 1 star is b/c of the classic margarita.... this is usually what keeps overrated Mexican spots like this in business.

2016-12-13,5.0,"Big Star catered our wedding in October and we couldn't have been happier! Jenn Williams and her catering team are rock stars and they made the whole event so much fun! Jenn was so communicative and really listened to what we wanted and made it happen. She worked with the venue coordinator to make sure all of our decorations got set up and everything looked just right so we didn't have to worry about anything the day of. The event staff was just awesome. We had the sweetest ladies serving from the taco truck and our bartender was outstanding. Everyone was complimenting him on his cocktails all night long. We really wanted to avoid the traditional ""bad catered wedding food"" and Big Star's fare was both delicious and fun. It is also much more affordable than most of the more traditional wedding caterers in the city. Our guests couldn't get enough and they loved the reveal of the taco truck. My favorite catering moment of the day was when my husband and I ran up to our little suite after the ceremony to have a few minutes together before entering the reception. We were both shaking and crying because the ceremony had been so emotional, and we got up the stairs and went inside to find that Jenn had left drinks and a plate full of appetizers for us. It was so sweet and made for a perfect private moment. I definitely recommend Big Star to any bride and/or groom looking for great food, service, and fun at your wedding!",0.9926,0.767,0.189,0.045,0.5154648526077098

And did you know their catering totally rocks in every way possible?!  Big shout out to the catering team, especially Jenn Williams and Laura Toal. Big Star catered my and my husband's wedding celebration (think a big 'ol bash with 115 family and friends after having a private wedding a couple weeks prior). We rented an amazing blank canvas of a venue, Trigger, so we had a ton of flexibility in terms of food, beverages, caterers, etc. We knew we didn't want to serve traditional banquet-style food, so we thought we could serve delicious food from some of our favorite restaurants. Who doesn't love tacos and friend chicken? Big Star and Honey Butter Fried Chicken were served. Oh ... and Bang Bang Pies for dessert! And, Big Star catered all of it. They even brought a couple bartenders along to serve our booze we ordered from Binny's.  Laura did a fabulous job helping me figure out exactly what food I wanted, how I wanted it served, what quantities, etc. And she assured me their staff would be comfortable serving other vendors' food as well. She was super helpful with the coordination with the other main food vendor, Honey Butter Fried Chicken. She got all our ducks in a row and handled the contract. And then Jenn, the event coordinator, stepped in as we got closer to the big day and got down and dirty with the details. She was simply AWESOME! She placed the order for the linens and coolers and helped fine-tune everything. Our venue didn't have a full kitchen or large freezer for ice, so she helped me work through some obstacles and everything went just swimmingly!  Jenn and her catering staff were professional, super sweet during our party and mega hardworking. They set up the food and beverages, bartended and barbacked, served and replenished the food, cleaned up and more. Nothing was left undone and they even helped break down the tables, chairs etc. at the end of the night. They went above and beyond. Thanks Jenn, Laura and the rest of the Big Star catering crew.

Take my review with a grain of salt though because for me, the perfect taco is some al pastor cut off a spit grilled up with a bit of pineapple and garnished with lime. Nothing better in the world.

A little too runny and saucy. Not quite as good as the chicken taco, but still decent. The chips and guac were a pleasant surprise. The guacamole was flavorful with a bit of a kick to it, which I appreciated it. Chips were warm and crispy.  Their margarita's were also very good. Sweet and tangy with just the right amount of tequila. Also got one of the ciders, which was also sweet and refreshing. All of that food and my bill came to just over $30. Decent price.

I had heard so many amazing things about their tacos and considering I have been eating tacos all week (Big and Little's on Monday and Primo Chuki's on Tuesday), I had to come here as well. And I regret nothing about my decision! Contrary to what I had heard, it was not that busy on a Wednesday evening around 6:30pm. I went with a couple of friends and we found a table outside in beautiful weather. We started off with the Big Star Margarita (different from their regular margarita because it has a dash of mezcal which gives the margarita a delicious smoky taste) and also an order of their chips and salsa (the salsa verde was amazing!).  For tacos, I had the Pollo (chicken), Pescado (fish) and Alambre de Res (grilled steak). The grilled steak taco definitely stood out from the others. The steak within the taco was cooked perfectly and the muenster cheese inside went so well with the green peppers. The pollo and pescado tasted pretty good too but in retrospect, I would have been happy with just three Alambre de Res tacos.  The waitstaff was polite and attentive. The atmosphere was casual and friendly. I cannot wait to come back here and try some of the other tacos. My vegetarian friends have praised the Walking Taco (which is a taco inside a bag of Fritos) so that should be next on the list. Do give this place a try.

I'll be honest, I came in with pretty low expectations on the food considering that this is a Tex mex Wicker Park hot spot, buuuuut they kinda sorta surprised me. While chips n salsa are hard to screw up, this has been a deal breaker for me in the past with other restaurants. Thaaankfully they figured out the perfect balance of crispy and salty, making the chips n salsa a win in my book! Tacos were decent in both taste and size (al pastor is my favorite, they even added the pineapple!). And while the tortillas weren't ""El Milagro"" quality, they were at least corn, which thrilled me. Margs were top notch, gettin us giggly just a few sips in.  But the Michelada was the big no star disappointment. As for the atmosphere, I LOVE THE VIBE. Lots of energy since it's so popular, and positive energy with drinks flowing and outdoor seating making it feel open and fun.  There are two sides, with the smaller of the two being the non-alcoholic section.

Out of all the tacos we ordered and sampled, my favorite was the potato (a vegetarian item), which actually surprised me too. The warm tortillas are amazing and loved how soft and light they were.

See, image is everything, and when I would stand outside of Violet Hour, waiting for the doors to open, I'd always see a crowd of people dining at Big Star. In addition, I'd always see a crowd of people just waiting to get into Big Star. Witnessing all of this, I figured that your food and spirits had to be excellent. I have never been more wrong in my life. I tried your tacos, and they were average, and that's being kind. Pepe's tacos are way better. Why? Pepe's tacos actually have flavor. Big Star's tacos have to be the most bland creations I've ever had. While eating these waste of time tacos, I began to wonder why people like this place so much. Then, it hit me. People like these tacos because they've had 5 - 15 drinks at Big Star before they've tried them. Drinks have the power to make food taste better than it really is. So, I decided to have a couple of drinks, and then I had one more taco after the drinks. The taco tasted better; not much better, but better. People, don't be fooled by the drinks. If you want poor tacos, then go to Big Star. However, a drink or two will at least make those tacos taste average.",0.8844,0.828,0.12,0.052,0.40611111111111114

The other tacos were standard, nothing awe inspiring. The pork belly could have reached new heights, maybe they were an old batch. For those who are accustomed to a Michelada, I would not get the one here. It's as if they poured half a bottle of tapatio inside a beer glass, and they couldn't finish a whole can of beer so they gave you the rest on the side, may I suggest using a bigger glass so you can fit a whole can in there.

I've been coming to this spot for a very long time, I've recommended it to many friends, family, clients, etc. Tonight I came in with my boyfriend to celebrate a promotion at my new job. We made the drive up from the south side (Pilsen) because we're craving big star margaritas. We get to the hostess and she tells us there's 9 parties ahead of us, no problem. We put our name down on the list and head to the bar for some drinks and guac. We order, usual pretentious type at big star bartender, no biggie. We go on having a good time. Our check comes and the waitress asks us if we'd like to leave it opened or closed, we're waiting for a table so we're gonna close it. My boyfriend is treating (I didn't bring my card, only about $25 in cash on me) and he goes through his wallet and realizes he forgot his card. Immediately, we approach the bartender to tell her the situation, apologizing profusely and she's just stone cold to us. She says she has to get her manager. Ok. Her manager comes after about five minutes and mind you the moment we realized that he forgot his card and didn't have enough cash to cover the bill, we immediately brought the drinks back to the bar, not one lick of salt or sip gone. My boyfriend knows his card number by heart, he offered to give the waitress his card number and information but she impolitely declines. I immediately apologize for the inconvenience and again explain what happened, he looks at me and goes, ""this is so unacceptable, not once in all my years of bartending has this ever happened?"" Wait, so you're telling me not once in the shit show that is Big Star you've never had a customer be short a few bucks??? He said ""I guess just give me what you got."" Our bill was 30.49 and we gave him $27. I'm sorry that shit happens, but don't shame us in front of other customers with lies. Sorry we were honest enough to come to you, bring full drinks back, and tel you that we were short instead of leaving y'all with nothing, which I'm sure is the usual classy move of the typical big star client, dine and dash not for me. I end up saying, ""you can keep your drinks."" Dude says thanks, doesn't even make eye contact, takes our cash and takes the drinks.

2016-07-13,1.0,"Have you ever cried at a restaurant because of the poor experience? I couldn't say I had until I went to Big Star. I went with several friends and acquaintances on Saturday evening, June 26. My drink was tasty, but put mezcal in anything and it will be good. I'm vegetarian and I don't like super spicy foods, so I ordered carefully. I asked about removing the peppers from the potato tacos, and the server said they were in the sauce but they didn't taste like much. My carrot taco was spicy, but not so much I couldn't eat it after adding a lot of sour cream. (Little side story here: I ordered a side of sour cream when the server suggested it. A few minutes before our tacos arrived, our chips and guacamole were refreshed and the waiter set down some ""crema."" I assumed someone in my group had requested it, especially since it was at the other end of the table. When one of our servers - not the main one, but maybe a busser/expediter - asked how our tacos were, I asked if my sour cream was coming. She pointed at it and said, that's it. I said, ""Well, that's the crema-"" She interrupted and said, ""Crema is Spanish for cream."" Yes, thank you, even if I hadn't lived in South America, I would have known that. But you guys called it by two different names and it came out with a different course and set it on the other end and there are many types of cream, so I did need some clarification. What is called ""crema"" at Mexican restaurants is often NOT the same as usual American sour cream. The condescension wasn't necessary.) Anyway, I had ordered two potato tacos. They were beyond my threshold. I told the waitress they were too much. I was embarrassed at first because I get teased and scoffed at a lot for my spice tolerance, so I cushioned it with saying, ""I can be a little sensitive to spice, but..."" She snorted, ""Yeah, that's our spiciest taco. I could have told you that."" Ah, but you didn't. Even when I asked about having the peppers removed. She just said that they were part of the sauce. (For everyone who is blaming me, take note... I did my diligence.) So I said, ""Okay... well, I can't eat it at all."" Pause while I wait for her to suggest an alternative taco. Nothing. So I continue, ""Can I have them taken off of my bill?"" She pursed her lips. ""If you have special needs you should have told us."" I don't have ""special needs""; I just didn't have any reason to think that taco would be the spiciest on the menu. I asked her again. She made a face and said, ""Well, I could ask the manager. But next time, you really ought to tell us."" Seriously?!?! Thanks for the lecture. And there will NOT be a next time. I politely said, ""Maybe the menu could have a scale of which tacos are hot. A lot of restaurants have that."" She glared at me, reiterated what I should do next time, and walked off. I was stunned. I was already having a very bad evening, for unrelated reasons, and that was the straw that broke the camel's back - I started crying. I can't remember ever crying over a server's attitude before. She was also rude to another girl in our group, and generally sarcastic and dismissive to our table. Most of the group lives in Chicago and almost all of us have been servers before, so there wasn't a cultural disconnect. She never took my tacos off the bill, but since it was given to us as an entire-table bill, I let it go. I didn't have it in me to fight anymore or delay my party. All in all: good drinks, okay tacos (but some are super spicy and not labeled as such), deplorable service. Edit: If people don't like my review, fine. Almost all of my reviews are quite positive; I'm not a serial complainer. Move on. Don't bother leaving me a sarcastic note blaming me for the server's terrible attitude.

2016-06-25,4.0,"I was only in Chicago for a day and a half so I don't have much to compare Big Star to locally; nevertheless I would highly recommend to anyone.  Prior to heading out here, a friend of mine was raving about this place (she is originally from Chicago)-I had to give me the info, but wasn't sure if I would make it. Another local friend of mine took me out my first night and Big Star was apparently the place!   Downside: be prepared for a long wait. However, we put in a name and gave them a phone number, and were free to grab a drink anywhere in the area--located in wicker park there is plenty nearby.  They texted us when the table was ready. The hostess and our waitress were very friendly. The food and Margs were great. The margaritas were a good balance of tequila and lime, but apparently stronger than they taste (which in my opinion is a good thing). We started with chips and guac--the guac was very fresh, homemade, probably the best restaurant guac I've had.  For dinner, I think 3 tacos is a good option, though a bigger guy might want more. I like they they sell each flavor as a single taco so that you can try a variety, and each is reasonably priced to do so (~$3-4 per taco). I had the pastor (pork), panza (steak), and chorizo--I loved the pork (which also comes with pineapple) and the chorizo.

2016-06-20,1.0,"Worst service in the fair city of Chicago I will not rail off against the food or drink, both of which are exceptional, albeit overpriced. That said, I left Big Star with an outrageously sour taste in my mouth, and it wasn't the margaritas. The service was so bad that it, in fact, negates the superlative quality of the eats and quaffs. For context: I arrived at this restaurant with two of my brothers, both of whom are of drinking age. I am nineteen years old. Everything was going relatively well, until one of my bros offered me a sip of his margarita (yes, a sip. Not a glass-- a sip). I took it without batting an eyelid. In a moment's notice, another lady (not my server), began scolding my party, saying something along the lines of, ""My waitress saw you give your drink to him [me],"" to which my brother said, ""I was just letting him taste it."" Then, the overseer responded, ""I understand. I'm just coming over to warn you before you get in trouble with the security guard."" What?????!!!!!!! There are a number of problems with this interaction. 1. My brother is several years older than me and practically raised me. My brother's gesture was akin to a father giving his son a sip of his wine at dinner. I'm not sure if this restaurant is in trouble with the police for providing minors with alcohol, but that doesn't matter in the slightest. Neither I nor my family have ever been reprimanded for a gesture so innocuous. What was the manager going to do? Call the police because I took a sip of a margarita? Give me a break. At bottom, both the manager and the server demonstrated an astounding lack of judgment and courtesy. A server without judgment and courtesy is like a tennis player without nets or a racket. Which brings me to problem number two (2): Why are the servers hovering over my family while we eat dinner? In spite of my limited experience in the service industry, I know that you are not supposed to scrutinize and skulk over every exchange among your customers. Even if you do not like whom you are serving, you have to give them some measure of privacy. In this way, I got the impression that our servers didn't really like us. Unfortunately, there is nothing in the server's handbook that says anything about getting retribution with your customers. To add insult to injury, our server hovered over our table like a hawk for the remainder of our meal, ostensibly trying to prevent my brothers from ""providing me with alcohol."" We could not hold a conversation without our taciturn, imperious server staring directly at us. When it was time to pay, she craned over my brother's shoulder as he signed the check. I knew exactly what was happening: In light of the abysmal service we received, the server put my brother under duress so she could get the tip she felt she deserved. This is beyond appalling. I wish my brother had given her a $0.00 tip. She deserves way, way less than that. If I pulled a stunt like this at the restaurant I worked at, I would have been fired on the spot. In sum, this was, by far, the worst service I have ever received in a Chicago restaurant. If this was a hole-in-the wall taco joint, this would have been bearable, but Big Star charges over eighty dollars for tacos and margaritas for a party of three. The service should, at the very least, be tolerable. This place makes me want to vomit. Do not go here!!!!",-0.9429,0.828,0.077,0.095,0.4766078777189888

The service was terrible, our waitress was great at first but once our food arrived, she was a ghost.  It took forever to track her down to get the bill. And speaking of food arriving? It doesn't come how you'd expect, instead of your tacos on an individual plate, all of the tacos for your entire table come on a single platter (i.e., if two people ordered fish tacos, they would give one plate of fish tacos, not one for each of you). It's annoying and petty to try and sort it out if you have a big group (we had six). Also, I did not care for the hipster/rude attitude of our waitress.  One of the people at the table asked for sour cream and she replied ""you mean CREMA?"" (heavy fake hispanic accent on crema).  Seeing as this place is 100% hipster and has no hispanic staff, I found this sort of a ridiculous thing to correct.  The person who delivered our tacos also pointed to the sour cream and said ""side of CREMA"" (again, fake heavy hispanic accent). It wouldn't bother me if say, our waitress was hispanic, or if the food was traditional mexican food and not hipster-fied... but it wasn't.  These tacos are not authentic. You're going to insist that people use the spanish word for sour cream when ordering (but not use spanish in any anything else lol), and then don't even serve limes with the tacos????

She took our order, when it was delivered, we discovered we were missing one taco. The order taker came back and said, "" What is it that you believe you're missing. She said it in a way that implied we couldn't possibly be missing anything and was very arrogant and sarcastic.  Molly took over but the experience was already ruined for me by this point.

Pretentious and pretty obnoxious but we waited none the less. I gave my phone number and they told me they would text me when the table was ready. Five minutes later, I got a text and we were seated inside. They do ask you your preference but we were hungry so we took whatever came up first. We were given an enormous booth for 3 people so they do truly just go down the list and give tables in order of when you came. I ordered the Big Star margarita and it was awesome! Loved the smoky flavor from the mezcal. We also split chips and guac and that was also so delicious. Really well made guac. I was impressed with the number of vegetarian options on the menu! I usually don't have more than 1, maybe 2, certainly not 3 or 4! I ordered two tacos, one with pinto beans and one with potatoes. Both were delicious! My friend ordered pork belly and thought it was good but nothing special and my husband ordered beef tacos and said the same thing. Vegetarian for the win again! Really liked this place.

We ordered chips, queso, and guacamole to start. The guac is $8 for a small-ish bowl but it was so delicious that we were okay with it. The queso was good too but not as good as the guac. For tacos, I had the pescado, the al pastor, and the pork belly. I thought the pork belly taco was by far the best and the pescado was the worst. The batter to fish ratio was off on the taco and the sauce wasn't that great; it tasted a lot like mayo. We also had four or five pitchers of margaritas which were delicious. Definitely order them one at a time because the ice melts quickly if it's warm out.

The food was really meh too, you could tell the Mexican theme was an afterthought. $9 for 2 small tacos, what a joke.

My tacos came and there were green onions on them. After a few minutes I'm finally able to grab her attention. I said excuse me but I ordered my food with no onions, I'm sorry but I can't eat these. Very rudely she said I ordered them with no onions. Hello bartender I'm sure you ordered them with no onions. But clearly there were onions all over the food. I just wanted some tacos with out onions. I really don't think that's asking much. She didn't offer to have them remade or anything.

I asked the man who delivered the food for the chips and he very rudely told me there was nothing he could do. We had not even touched the queso but started eating the tacos.

Sadly, the combination of less than stellar tacos (at a higher than average price point) and lack of service made for a lame experience. At any other taco joint, I might have done a second round of tacos, but I just had to leave after the first here. Taco de Panza (3/5): This may have been the tastiest of the three tacos I had. The pork belly could have been fattier, but the crispiness was also nice in this particular taco. -- $4 Taco al Pastor (2/5): This was the most disappoint one, since it is normally one of my favorites. Unfortunately, the pork shoulder was too dry, and just overall felt underwhelmed, especially since you're paying $4 for it.  -- $4  Taco de Pescado (2/5): This was actually quite a bit of tilapia, almost too much in my opinion because the fish itself was not that flavored and this relied on the chipotle mayo. Added quite a bit of red and green sauce to flavor this up. -- $4 Service (1/5): We got seated immediately and food came up relatively quickly. However, it seemed we were completely forgotten soon as we got our food. After our plates finally got taken away, we waited for a good 15 min before we were able to flag someone to ask for the check.

The meat was succulent, the flavors were bold, and the ingredients were fresh. The margarita was very good too. Since my friend was the designated driver, I couldn't order multiple pitchers for just myself but would love to try a few more in the near future. Street in front has paid parking so no hassle there and across the street is the Violet Hour which makes a great post-dinner stop. One more thing, their salsas were pretty good, although not the chunky, fresh ones I typically prefer but I did like that they had a good selection of the salsas and are pretty attentive about refilling the plates as and when you're done.",0.9962,0.733,0.239,0.029,0.6158802308802309

Despite the long wait and craziness, I really like this place. The place is so lively and fun. A great place to go for early afternoon drinks with friends. Big Star Margarita is gooooood. Not too sweet, not too sour and quite strong. A pitcher lasted a long time. I think it made about 8-9 glasses. The Guac here is packed with flavor. Well seasoned with a lot of spices. Taco Al Pastor was okay. I will need to try more of their tacos to comment on it.  If you just want to try their taco, there is a separate window outside that you can order and pickup tacos.

2016-02-22,3.0,"I came here on a Friday night. Against my better judgment, I allowed my friends to make the reservation. As many of you know, when working with people in their late twenties, ""I'll make the reservation"" often becomes ""Oh, we'll be able to get a table,"" within a matter of seconds.  That being said, our experience was good. I had a chicken taco and a margarita at the bar. We ultimately didn't sit at a table to eat because, as you may have guessed, they were crazy busy. As far as the food goes, I had a chicken taco and a margarita. The chicken taco was pretty average as far as tacos go. Nothing truly special, but definitely a solid and well-seasoned few bites. The margarita was about the same - pretty standard fare. I imagine this to be the kind of food drunk people rave about but a sober person would likely pass on by. What really brought this place down for me were two things: First, the volume level. It's just way too loud in there. Conversations are not a great idea if you're anywhere near the bar. Second, the design of the place makes the bar a terrible place to sit or stand - serving staff, god bless them, were extremely courteous when they needed to get through, but the tight space in between the bar and the wall does them no favors. Perhaps I'll get dragged here some night when I've had a few drinks and my friends insist, and I'll think better of the place, but I think I won't go back again while sober.",0.9712,0.788,0.151,0.061,0.5674196174196173

And for me the only one worth waiting forever for. Chicken taco has a strange sweetness to it. Idk. Not for me. The new beef taco - meh.  The Guac here is on another level. So good.  The thing that I really don't like about big star is the way they serve the tacos... They just bring a big dish of all of your tacos - like the whole table's tacos on one platter - and you have to remember what taco is what and divvy it up yourselves like some kind of animal.  It's weird. I ordered my thing so I want it placed in front of me like I'm a human at a normal restaurant.  Why? Why big star? Why do we have to be served like a bunch of pirates??? Whatever.

We chugged, and arrived at Big Star feeling good. It was a small price to pay for a massive platter of tacos. I had the al pastor and the taco de pescado.

My only companions were a young boy and a magical goat that sustained us with milk from its teats and songs from its breath. The boy was pretty cool, too. We would drink to life's confines and gnash our teeth at the frequent squalls, our shouts alive with laughter and the smell of goat milk. We were content that if an errant wave should smash us against the rocks, then they would at least be the rocks of glory! But our euphoria would not last, for we soon found ourselves becalmed. There we existed in those doldrums, and after a week and a half without wind we knew that the sea's bounty could not hope to sustain the three of us. And so, with tears in our eyes, we ate the boy.

Basically you have to see the host to be seated but since it's a bar you can be seated for as long as you like and they will not ask you to leave, so estimated wait times are probably not very accurate or hard to gage.  We actually were seated right away as a group of 2 on a Thursday night at like 830 pm, but I am going to say that was all luck, since all other groups where 3 or larger and the wait was at least estimated to be 45 min or longer.  The food: Tacos Al Pastor (amazing) I love sweet and savory so the meat with the pineapple is such a great combo. Tacos De Panza (while still amazing my least favorite of the three) this was a very good taco I would just prob order another pastor next time I go bc that was sooo good.

The chips were soggy as we got to the bottom of the stack. Service is decent. What bothered us most was that our food came out about 3 minutes after we ordered which could o ly mean that it's not made to order.

Get a square and a cell phone.  3) the tacos were yummy but not worth the price. I mean they were good gourmet tacos but they were so small. Probably the reason the margaritas were so strong. Usually I can eat 3 tacos and 2 margaritas and be fine. But not here.  The balance is alllll off.

The pricing is also incredibly reasonable, especially considering how much traditional wedding catering costs, for food with much less character.

We started off with the queso fundido and Guacamole and chips. Both were well portioned starters. They give more than enough chips for the chips and guac. The queso fundido cheese was perfectly melted with peppers and chorizo, served with hot corn tortillas for spooning.  I then got the Taco de Pescado and Taco de Panzo. Both really delicious. That fried fish was the length of the taco and was well fried. It had plenty of slaw for balance. The Taco de Panzo, pork belly, was nice and fatty but not overwhelming. I also tried the Taco Al Pastor with pork shoulder and pineapple. Great balance of sweet and savory. The tacos here are definitely not tiny so you are getting your money's worth. The amount of meat/toppings they give definitely deserves a thumbs up.",0.9819,0.819,0.181,0.0,0.6321428571428571

We also got a side of chips and guacamole. Wow. Everything was phenomenal. My only personal preference would be to take the pineapple off the al pastor taco.

There was plenty of outdoor seating on this perfect September day.  The tacos themselves were great. I had the Taco de Pollo Pibil and Taco de Picadillo, both were excellent.

You'll get solid good food, although it's cash only. Womp womp. You've got two options. you can dine in: indoor and outdoor seating. Or, you can walkup to the window, and even seat at benches just outside of the restaurant. in other words, sit your drunk butt and pay tip, or keep-a-steppin, and take yo tacos elsewhere! They do have really good food, and they aren't shy about adding a kick to their salsa. It's not your standard run-of-the-mill tacos, either. They've got some flavor. I think this spot is great for a two or 4-some kind of dinner, but it can get pretty loud. Come here if you want the happenin' kind of vibe, or to follow-up a night of drinks with friends. It's got that hipster/metro kinda feel. They've got beer, they've got spiked horchatas... they've got tacos. tacos tacos tacos.

We were seated promptly, which is unusual at Big Star because of its popularity, so we were excited. We ordered apps and they came out promptly (queso fundido is on point). When our waitress came back we ordered tacos, I got 2 and my fiancé ordered 3. My first taco came out, and apparently that was all we were granted that evening. No other tacos came out, and our waitress fussed when we complained one hour later and asked that these be removed from our bill because they never came after multiple check ins with service.  Not only was Big Star not busy, but they were not courteous or respectful when we, rightfully, complained.

The mole was such a great counterbalance to the sweet tender carrots. The fish taco is always delicious.  If I have one complaint, the waitress was so soft spoken! It was difficult to hear her and I felt like I shouted in responding to her to overcompensate for her quietness! Overall, Big Star is a must. Take advantage of these lingering days of warm weather.

I would summit that no two experiences at this place will be rendered the same.  The age range varies greatly and difficult to pinpoint the average that makes sense of the crowd.  The 21yr olds are there with skimpy clothing and eager to get that drink while the 30's are dressed for casual Club attire looking to be recognized.  And then there's the 40's that seem to look in amazement for why there are so many people packed in one spot and trying to find a server for a table, food and/or drinks.  Safe to say that it caters to everyone's needs. Seems that the success of this place likely relies on the varying groups that are able to find a niche in what it offers.  Like it or not, a sliver of opportunity is often better than a defined demography and/or style.  The drinks are good, food tasty (tacos) and atmosphere vibrant while being pretty F'ing loud. :-)   BigStar is a place to frequent but be forewarned that there's a time limit of your tolerance and patience of its ways.  Nevertheless I somehow manage to not mind the ambiance and have a good time.",0.9647,0.848,0.131,0.021,0.5942028985507247

I asked for no ice so it wouldn't get watered down, but sadly that meant the amount they gave you barely came to half the size of the pitcher. The taste was strong but not very pleasant. Appetizers we ordered were chips, guac and salsa. Really enjoyed the apps and would order them again. Ordered the following for entree: #1 taco - fried fish taco - cooked to perfection and had a spicy mayo sauce that was extremely good. Definitely added a kick of heat to the dish. #2 taco -  beef taco - caught me off guard with raisins and peanuts in it, but it was alright. Had a kick of heat as well in it. #3 taco - pork taco - ive had a lot better from places in pilsen area so would have to say thumbs down.

Waited an hour for table.  First thing was server spilled red salsa on wife's shirt, pants and bag,  and on son's shoe. Next, drunk woman at table next to us performed the dumb ass routine. Clearly, the restaurant served here too many shots. Her friends enjoyed taking photos of this person with head down on the table. This was followed by pouring water on her head. We ordered salad which was good and chips and guacamole, which were a bit bland.  Some of the chips were chewy. Then we waited for 20 minutes before server returned. But, we got the free entertainment. Suddenly, drunk woman leaned over and vomited about 2 liters of what looked like nacho cheese. This was about two feet from my daughter. No apology from staff., if I was manager, free meal for those next to vomit who had to witness this. I got up and told employee that we were not thrilled by salsa spill, vomit and neglect. About ten minutes later a pleasant manager and her co-worker came over and apologized. He offered a free beer. She vetoed this lame gesture and said she would take items off menu. From that point on our server looked grumpy. We finally got meal. We ate several tacos which were tasty, but nothing we couldn't get in an average California taqueria without the large number of drunk, uninteresting yahoos.  Al pastor was my favorite.

I gave them my phone number so they could text me when it was our turn to be seated. Well, either I didn't feel/hear the alert or the text was delayed in delivery. So, after 25 minutes, I went to ask how much longer and the hostess said they had already texted us and never got a reply from me. So she offered to put us back in the cue to start over. (The wait time I assume had grown).  I wanted to accept defeat and suggested to my friend that we leave or go to their take-out window but my friend did not. So, after she argued about it to the hostess, the hostess relented and gave us the next table. Nice! My first time here.  Thanks for cutting us some slack.   My only complaint is not really a fault with Big Star. But, since it's so crazy busy and we got seated right across from the hostess stand, I couldn't help but feel pressure to eat and leave.  To be clear, nobody made me feel that way.

I do not live close to the Blue Line, so I was reluctant to make the almost 45 min bus commute just for some tacos. This weekend, I was helping my boyfriend move into his new apartment that is only a few blocks away and decided to pick some up for us to eat while we unpacked. The setup is very smart with ample amounts of outside patio seating that looked pretty crowded when I walked up. To order take out, you walk to a window off to the side where there is plenty of room to stand (or sit) and wait for your order. I appreciated that I didn't have to wade through waves of diners in order to place my order and the shortened wait time from having take out and dine in orders/prepped separately.  As for the tacos themselves, they were amazing! I am not generally a fan of tacos as I tend to think of ground beef and generic taco seasoning with some tasteless lettuce, shredded cheese and a bit of sour cream, but these tacos are nothing like that. They are as diverse as they are creative. I had the pescado and the pollo while my boyfriend opted for the pazzara and the walking taco. I tried a bit of each, and the chicken was probably my favorite, but they were all tasty!  Probably not worth the trip if you live far away and are only thinking about getting take out, but if you have some time to sit back, soak up some sun while enjoying a margarita and delicious tacos, I definitely recommend checking this place out!",0.9838,0.845,0.125,0.031,0.5460807050092764

My friend had a walking taco, and for something that's served in a Fritos bag, it looked pretty delicious.

If you haven't come to drink, you can hit the walk-up stand on the right side of the patio and grab an open seat. Only thing I dislike (outside of the wait and the Chad/Trixie douchebags that seem to gather at the bar - do they have PBR on tap or something?) is the parking sitch, which it awful here at all times of the day/week. If you can avoid driving, do so. If not, the best (i.e, most often available) parking is a few blocks south on Damen.

We decided to go with Big Star for our wedding instead of the traditional catered wedding food - and we are SO glad we did! EVERYONE raved about the food!! Our wedding was relatively small with only 60 people, which made doing a taco buffet very easy. Big Star gives a half hour window on when they will deliver and for us they showed up within the first 15 minutes of that window, which was perfect. The set-up was quick and easy, and quiet. I didn't even notice them setting up until I could smell the tacos :)   With only 60 people we ordered enough food for 70, and I'm very glad we did as it was the perfect amount, everyone got enough food with many getting seconds, and there were hardly any leftovers. We ordered the 3 taco choices, with 4 tacos per guest, of grilled fish (the best!) pork shoulder and the mole carrots - all extremely delicious - with chips, guac, salsa, side salad, and beans. They put everything for the tacos on the side, which is great when you don't know how picky your guests may be. They also provided plates, napkins and cutlery. While we didn't get drinks from them, we did get ice. The food was hot and fresh! Believe it or not... but it was better than eating at Big Star!  Margaret and the rest of the catering/event staff were extremely easy to work with and very helpful - we were able to change our delivery time just a few days before the wedding and they were patient and friendly on the many different iterations of our menu, adding items and changing the order various times, until two days before, and allowing us to order the mole spiced carrots, which isn't offered on their catering menu. We appreciated their friendliness and patience during what can be a stressful time.  If you're looking to do something a little different for your wedding (that I promise your guests will love!) or just have awesome food at your party, I highly recommend Big Star Catering - also, there is no wait!",0.9952,0.821,0.158,0.021,0.568851851851852

I ordered the one with pinto beans and bacon expecting it to be a taco and it was soup with a tortilla. What? I mean, that's fine, but I feel like the menu should have been clearer.

The zanahorias is a roasted carrot taco; the walking taco is served in a Fritos bag; I loved every bite of both! In addition to the tasty food and fun set-up--there's a huge patio and the restaurant is in an old garage--Big Star has a solid alcohol selection.

The first time I was expecting to wait a really long time, but I think it was around 30-40 minutes. Margaritas were good and so was the queso fundido. We ordered one of each taco to try and enjoyed them all!  This last time I was a little disappointed. We waited almost two hours for a table. They do take your number and text you when it's ready, but they refused to give any kind of estimate as to how long you have to wait.we were finally seated, but I was not fond of our table. We were seated right near the entrance to the inside so it was super loud from the music and noise coming from the bar. We ordered a pitcher of margaritas and chips and guac to start. The chips and guac were on the table almost immediately. The pitcher came and the guy slowly distributed ice from the pitcher into our glasses, spilling on me as he went. No one wants to go out to eat and get spilled on by a server.  We ordered our tacos- 3 pork belly, 2 al pastor, 1 potato, 1 fish, 1 chicken and 1 beef. The two winners were the al pastor and the chicken. No one was impressed with the rest. My fish taco was burnt on one end. The pork belly was just not good. I couldn't even finish it. So overall I felt the my second experience was completely different from the first. There are other places to get good tacos and it doesn't require such a long wait.

The atmosphere is always great. They really do a great job of cultivating the right feel. Big Star is cash ONLY, so be prepared!

Tonight has completely changed our attitude towards coming back. We were greeted by a very rude waitress at our table and we ordered our usual queso fundido and chalados to start. The queso fundido was so over done the entire bottom was rock hard and we had to ask for a knife to try to cut it. Our waitress never checked on us once! We had to ask a random server walking by for a knife. Once we paid the check and let the waitress know how disappointed we were with the queso she replied you should have said something to me. I let her know that if we would have seen her or if she had stopped by we would have but that was not the case. We didn't hear from her or see her for over 15 minutes. Once we payed the bill she slammed(literally the table shook) her hand on the table and picked up the bill and stormed away. There was no I'm sorry or anything from her. I'm sorry but that is not the great service or food I have raved about to all of my friends.

The Panza was a great braised pork belly taco, onions, cilantro mix with this great tomato based sauce that had some heat on it.  Out of everything I ordered this taco is a probably the shining star.  Tostada de Hongos is probably the next best thing that I ordered at Big Star.  Tostadas are basically a crispy corn tortilla base with toppings on it.  In the Tostada de Hongos, the stewed mushrooms acted as the protein and it was mixed with some fresh greens, goat cheese, and fresh tomato based salsa.  My first bite into this vegetarian dish made me think that they had given me the wrong food; the mushroom tasted almost just like meat and I enjoyed the dish a lot.  The goat cheese went surprisingly well with the stewed mushrooms and helped give it another layer of flavor.  The Picadillo, ground beef, and Pescado, tilapia filet, tacos were mediocre and could be ignored.  Picadillo almost reminded me of your regular taco meat and while Pescado had a crispy outer shell, was extremely soggy in the middle and had a layer of oil between the fish and the crispy exterior; not very pleasant.   Overall, if I were in the area and wanted food near the Damen-O'Hare Blue line train stop I would definitely stop by Big Star for some food, but I wouldn't make a detour on my trip just to drop by.",0.9246,0.862,0.099,0.039,0.4756617038875103

Guacamole was too sour and once again chips were not that fresh.  Cash only this day in age? Get real! Probably will not return.",-0.372,0.892,0.031,0.076,0.4241666666666667

It was marinated too much with an interesting flavor that didn't taste savory, just salty (?). Taco al Pastor was by far my favorite. It was rich with sweet sauce sprinkled with pineapple chunks on top. Taco de Pescado had a crisp, but soft fish topped with lime flavored cabbage that was greatly complimented with the chipotle mayo. I enjoyed the cabbage with the fish making it a great combination.  Ranking of Tacos: Pastor, Pescado, Panza. Service was great.

After the Hawks Rally yesterday we were starving and didn't want to stay in the chaos of the Loop, so she suggested Big Star.  For 2pm on a Thursday, it was much more crowded than I thought, but I did see a lot of Blackhawks red - and the weather was beautiful. Luckily, we were able to snag 3 seats at the bar with no wait (SCORE!) and were quickly served by an awesome bartender, I didn't catch his name,  but his tattoos were sweet.  We ordered a few beers and by the time they came, ordered food. Let me preface by saying that I could not choose a favorite, and if I could've alternated bites of these tacos without making a horrible mess, I would've.  Next time, I'm going to come in and plan to sit for a long time, gorging on tacos! I tried: 1) queso fundido - which we shared as a group.  SO GOOD.  Came out piping hot (too hot to eat, but that's the point when things come out in cast iron, no?)  Full of poblanos and chorizo. 2) Taco De Panza: crispy, braised pork belly, tomato guajillo sauce, queso fresco, onion, cilantro.  The flavors were great.  I added their green hot sauce. 3) Taco Al Pastor: marinated, spit roasted pork shoulder, grilled pineapple, grilled onion, cilantro.  Al Pastor tacos are a love affair of mine, and how I judge taco joints.  Big Star passes the test, BIG TIME.  Don't pass up this taco! 4) Taco de Pescado: beer battered tilapia fillet, chipotle mayo, cabbage, red onion, lime, cilantro.  I don't normally dig on tilapia, and I would never order it at a restaurant... EXCEPT HERE.  Get this taco.  The chipotle mayo has great flavor and everything marries so well.  The fish was crispy and delicious (which I again, never say about tilapia.)

Didn't care for the chicken taco because I only eat chicken breast and this is made up of chicken thigh. So for those who like dark meat, this taco is calling your name.

I've had Big Star on my radar for quite some time now, so when I happened to be in the area around lunch time, I was eager to give it a shot. However, I was less than thrilled when I saw the line just to check in with the hostess. She took our number and told us it would be a bit of a wait, so we were free to walk around the area or whatever. What she failed to tell us is that you can sit at the bar and get the same freakin' service that you get at a table. That part we figured out on our own.  So, instead of waiting, we made our way to the bar area and found a table near it to place our order. Interestingly enough, there were several open tables not being utilized, even though customers were being turned away due to the ""wait"". I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and assume NONE of the people waiting by the hostess stand were 21. Who knows? That was just the first annoyance. The second annoyance came when I discovered they were cash only. Okay, not a huge deal. I'll get cash out at the ATM. Oh, they want to charge me a $3 fee to use it? Ok, whatever. Fine. Take my money. Now, I've worked at cash only joints. I know what the owners are thinking. And most of the time they are thinking about how much money they can make by avoiding CC fees and charging people to use their ATMs. It's a bit of a shady game, especially if you are operating a place as large as Big Star, but you do you and chase that paper, bro. I won't judge.  Onto the food and service. Our waiter was nice. The food was good. Was it mindblowingly good? Nah. The guacamole reminded me a lot of the kind you get at Bakersfield on Mass Ave in Indy, for those of you Hoosier folks. Heavy on the lime and garnished with radish. I dig it. It was probably my favorite part of my meal - that and the delicious limeade. The tacos were okay. I had the pork & pineapple one and a walking taco.

2015-05-07,5.0,"As a confirmed Fat Kid, I love places that cater to my tastes. This includes pork, beer, pork fat, and tasty accoutrements to the aforementioned. Big Star, I felt like I was coming home. I went with 5 friends on a Wednesday evening at about 7:45pm. The place was wall-to-wall packed, and tables (there are only 6 of them) were in high demand. There were people eating EVERYWHERE, even perched atop the waiter's station. I remember the inside of Pontiac being a lot bigger - perhaps there needs to be some logistical re-tooling of Big Star's interior - the square bar that takes up a good 5/8 of the space is massive - the bartenders have more room to navigate than the patrons do, which doesn't really seem fair; we're the ones who came to eat [and pay]. We found 2 stools and immediately staked our claim, plunking down and rolling up our sleeves to tuck in to the tacos we had all been hearing about. I began with a paloma - which tasted nearly exactly like a well-crafted margarita, as in, I could taste the tequila, which I consider to be a very good thing (sour mix-heavy cocktails need not apply here); at $7 a good value, although the beer list has more bang for your buck - (7oz Schlitz for $1, High-Life, Tecate, and Lone Star for $3, plus assorted microbrews all topping out at about $5). My friend ordered a michelada - a tasty concoction of Tecate, Lime Juice, and salsa (I'll get to the salsa shortly) with a salt rim. I'd replace my Sunday morning Bloody with a michelada anytime - it was tart and spicy and refreshing all at once.  There is also an impressive array of sodas available, even BIRCH BEER (a childhood favorite), for a cool $3 a pop (pun - get it?). We took full advantage of managing to flag down our [often absent and slightly disorganized - we ordered guacamole twice before it actually went through, and she seemed to favor the other side of the bar to ours] waitress and ordered a variety of the tacos and tostadas. They were out of the braised goat taco, which was disappointing, but I live about 100 feet from here and will definitely be back to try it.  The menu, although small, has a decent variety of fillings from which to choose, as well as a few side dishes and apps. The guacamole is delicious; topped with crunchy slivers of fresh radish and redolent of lime juice, the only improvement to be made is the portion size.  The chips are clearly freshly fried - we seized the opportunity of having [many] leftover chips from our guac to sample the 3 salsas available in squeeze bottles atop the bar: Green top: Salsa verde, very lime-y, not too spicy, and very tasty; Yellow top: My personal favorite, a sticky, garlicky salsa roja with a slightly sweet finish - literally, I could drink this stuff; Red top: Probably chipotle based, the spiciest of the three, with a delicious smoky flavor. After a considerable wait [but hey, the place was packed, and newly opened, so I will give them some leeway on this], our tacos arrived. I had spoken to at least 6 independent sources prior to dining at Big Star, and all had said that the tacos, although small, were mightily delicious. Would they measure up to the hype?  The answer is... YES! Amazingly so. I'll give a rundown of each that we ordered: -Taco al pastor: Braised pork shoulder with sweet chunks of sticky pineapple - savory and sugary, definitely delicious, although the pork, in my opinion, was just a *touch* on the dry side. -Taco al panza: Fatty, sweet, melt-in-your-mouth pork belly goodness, topped with a flurry of cotija cheese - heads above even the roasted duck breast and corn salsa taco from de cero - I left in a pork belly coma, and am still dreaming about this taco the next day; my mouth is literally watering for one even as I write this. At $3, I could scarf these all night; I'd suffer the slings and arrows of congestive heart failure, high cholesterol, and any other ailment overconsumption of pork belly could lead to. Top 10 best things I've ever put in my mouth (get your heads out of the gutter) -Tacos de rajas de poblano: Always conscious of the vegetarians, this taco is surprisingly delicious; sweet and smoky strips of poblano peppers topped with a grilled slab of charry-melty cheese. The poblano was grilled in such a fashion that it almost took on a meaty quality. -Tostadas al pescado: Creamy and crunchy and refreshing, this tostada comes with a generous hunk of smooth avocado atop the fish, sliced radishes, crispy lettuce, and poblano cream; I was worried that the tostada shell would be soggy, but it remained perfectly crispy and delicious. Can't wait for the patio to open in the summer because this tostada will be perfect for warm weather refreshment. -Tostadas al pollo: During round 2 of taco consumption, I decided to give the chicken a chance. Normally, I steer away from ordering chicken in restaurants because I don't feel it is special enough, but something told me I wouldn't be disappointed. Perhaps it was the description: braised chicken thighs, b",0.9991,0.816,0.16,0.023,0.5270318055369602

2015-04-24,5.0,"I think all of Wicker Park was at Big Star last Saturday.  The patio area takes up almost an entire street corner!  The wait for a table inside looked long, so we decided to order at the window and then eat at one of the tables outside.  The order window is a genius idea for take-out orders, or for anyone that doesn't want to wait for a proper table. I asked my friend Aimee M. what was good here, because I couldn't decide, and if there are maybe six varities of tacos, well...I know I couldn't eat six tacos.  At her recommendation, I ordered one fish taco, and at my own accord, one pork taco. THE FISH TACOS ARE SO GOOD.  I should have ordered a second one!  The fish was perfectly battered and fried.  It was crispy all the way through, it wasn't greasy or soggy at all.  This is the best fish taco I've ever had!  Tacos at Big Star cost a bit more than your neighborhood tacqueria, but this fish taco was absolutely worth $3-4.  The pork was good, but I honestly don't remember anything else about it because I'm thinking about that fish taco. The chips and guacamole are also a must-have.  The chips were fresh, but again not greasy, and the guacamole blew Chipotle's out of the water.  The guacamole was fresh, creamy, but also had nice chunks of avocado.  I thought $8 was a bit steep for guac, until I saw the portion that is really meant for sharing. Grab a horchata or limeaid to wash it all down and sit on the patio.  The number of people standing or just meandering about is great for people watching. Parking in the area stinks.  I tried to come here once before, probably turned the wrong way at a red light at a 5-way intersection, couldn't find parking, so I gave up and went elsewhere.  I ended up parking down the street this time, but there was a lot of effort put into finding that spot.

We crammed into the bar and ordered a margarita and a michelada. Both were decent - not the best ever - but reasonably priced for Chicago. After we finished our drinks, it had been about an hour and our table was ready. On the patio. It was 30 degrees. Not ideal, but again, fine. We were hungry, and we were promised patio heaters. We ordered the al pastor, walking taco, tostada de hongos, and the frijoles. The tacos and tostada were average but small for the price point. The frijoles, however, were terrible - soupy, bland, and they came with two palm-sized corn tortillas. Two! Our waitress rushed us through the meal and had the check on the table before we had even finished eating. If it hadn't been freezing out and if the patio heater covered more than 1/4 of our table, this would have been more of an issue.

Also, none of the sauces there were hot or flavorful enough, and even when we tried loading our tacos with the sauce hoping for SOME flavor, it just did not work out.

The tacos (my favorites being the pastor, chorizo, pescado, and papas....so pretty much all of them, ha) are delicious and, in my opinion, sizable. I also think the price point is very fair. The margaritas are perfect for a sunny day on their patio.  Can you get equally good tacos elsewhere in Chicago? Sure. Will they be cheaper? Maybe. But you won't get the same patio atmosphere. It's really comparing apples to oranges. If I'm just looking for a quick taco meal, I head to one of the taquerias found inside local Hispanic grocery stores.

In reality, living in a far neighborhood from them, it's my indulgence to stop by Big Star for take-outs when I have a business in WP every few months.  That's why I got so disappointed when I finally got home and opened brown bags to find that some items were missing. Soon I called to the restaurant. But what I learned was that because they ran the business completely on cash, they did not have any means to refund me directly. The girl said that they usually kept that amount as a credit for the customer to claim at his next visit. I was not very comfortable with that, for it basically required me to travel all the way to WP again to claim 10 bucks or so.  So she forwarded my concern to the restaurant manager, and I am telling you, his response to this matter was the most sincere, compassionate, and generous one I have ever known in my life. Apologizing that they would not be able to cash refund to me, he instead offered me to deliver a free dinner of my choice.

After being repeatedly lied to we decided to leave. Still no text arrived. I think they let people in ahead of us. Plus while the ambience is good (but noisy) the food did not look great.

2015-03-20,2.0,"I've heard about these tacos for years, but never trusted the hype; most of their customers would fail a random breathalyzer test, so how good can their taste buds be? But they deliver on Grub Hub now so I figured I'd give it a try. The order came super fast (I live about a mile away) - in just about 30 minutes.  I ordered 5 tacos so I could try most of them.  I was disappointed that there wasn't a steak option, but they may have been out of it for the day. Much to my dismay, the tacos arrived with no condiments - NO SALSA!  Ach!  Not a drop!  I would have dropped dead if I didn't have some of my own in the fridge!  I would have liked to try their salsa, but perhaps you have to buy it separately?  Odd. I have to agree with the other reviewers and say the tacos are pretty pricey for their small size, between $3-$4 bucks each.  They are served on the smaller more traditional Mexican style tortillas, and the tortillas were pretty good.  The spice level of each of the tacos was pretty good as well. Where the food fell short was flavor.   Overall, the only taco I really liked was the al pastor.  Here is the breakdown: Chorizo Taco - made with what I assume is house chorizo, the meat had a ground beef flavor, and was pretty bland, with a strange after taste and none of the spicy succulent sauciness of chorizo.   It was also an odd color, very grey. Chicken taco - the sauce and toppings were good on this one, but the chicken was quite dry. Veggie Taco (potato & rajas) -  this taco was just all potato, also dry and bland, with no rajas to be seen.   I was looking forward to the peppers as the description said ""chipotle rajas"" which sounds delicious and certainly would have added more flavor to the taco, but they were MIA. Al Pastor - al pastor is one of my favorite Mexican dishes.  I found this taco to be delicious, though it wasn't very authentic.  It didn't have the traditional red sauce and spicy rub, but it was smoky, grilled, and seasoned properly, and the pineapple chunks were great. Overall, I was disappointed in these tacos and the only one I would order again is the al pastor.... unless I was drunk, then I might try some others ; )",0.9845,0.722,0.166,0.112,0.6015136054421769

One was joking with me about taking pictures and it not being allowed. She must've noticed that I was in from Chicago. But hey a bloggers got to do what a bloggers got to do.  To eat I had three tacos. I had the taco de pescado, taco de pollo pibil and the taco de chorizo verde.  The fish taco had a beer battered tilapia fillet, chipotle mayo, cabbage, red onion, lime and cilantro. It was very good; I added a little bit of one of the sauces to add additional flavor. The chicken taco was quite good too; it had chicken thighs steamed in banana leaves with citrus marinade, pickled red onions and cilantro. My favorite, however, was the chorizo taco. It had pork sausage, poblano, serrano, pumpkin and sesame seeds, potato, onion and cilantro and had quite the kick.  I absolutely loved it.

That said, I'm giving it one out of five stars to put it on notice for occasional egregiously bad acts of customer service.  The key instance: When I sat inside to eat earlier this week, one of the bartenders took my driver's license (as the bartenders normally do as insurance for payment) and never returned it.  When I inquired about it over the phone later, I was asked to ""call back in a few hours when we have time to check.""  I ended up returning to Big Star a few hours later, after 10 PM, to pick up the license.  The bartender was unable to find it.  When I suggested that Big Star accept cash deposits in lieu of driver's licenses (with numbers associated with each patron's deposit), she rolled her eyes like they were in a hoola hoop competition.   Worst still, when I left the restaurant to order food from the take-out window, it had closed prematurely without advanced notice (it wasn't the first time this has happened).  Because too little time was left before the Metra train departed for me to investigate other restaurant options, I went home hungry and without a driver's license.  This morning, I filed a police report in order to have the license replacement fee waived, but 69 W. Washington wouldn't have it.  I had to pay $5 for a replacement driver's license - which means that Big Star owes me a free cup of its out of this world $5 guacamole!",0.7115,0.933,0.043,0.024,0.37723214285714285

I already had a bad taste in my mouth about Big Star for being cash only. I mean, come on. You get that much business and you can't afford to get with the times and buy a credit card machine? We enjoyed complimentary chips and salsa as we perused the menu. I ended up getting something called a ""walking taco"" and a potato taco. Imagine my surprise when our food comes out and my ""taco"" is actually some taco fillings thrown into a small bag of Fritos. What!? Typical hobo-chic Wicker Park, I thought. It tasted fine, but it was just odd, ESPECIALLY because there's nothing at all on the menu description of the item that suggests it's actually a glorified bag of Fritos for way too much money.

The sign is literally a big 'ol star.  Seems to me they have a large outdoor seating area that's probably popping in the better weather months.  The weather on the night we visited it was a toasty 37 degrees, so the 45 minute wait just to put your name on a list for a table was fine comfort wise.  They also provide outdoor heaters that were blazing hot.   Once inside, we gave our name and were told we'd get a text in about an hour for our table. No biggie, because the bar are is huge and the bartenders are on their job.  A beer(Shiners Birthday Beer) and 2 shots later(Prairie Dogs) the hostess actually came to find us to take us to our table. So the atmosphere here isn't made by the cinder blocks or lawn furniture, it's all about the food. Tacos. Tacos for days y'all.  We had Taco de Panza(pork belly), Taco Al Pastor(pork shoulder), Taco Carne Asada, and the Queso Fundido.  My favorite was the Taco Al Pastor because it had these tiny pieces of pineapple that really brought the flavor.  The Queso Fundido was a cheese lovers dream, melted perfectly over this delicious homemade chorizo. Excuse me while I reminisce and drool.   To avoid long waits, my dining partners suggested coming here during lunch or grabbing a taco at the carry out window.",0.9716,0.861,0.115,0.024,0.49325396825396833

2015-01-08,4.0,"UPDATED REVIEW: 4 STARS: So I am updating my review, truly for only one reason. Not only did I review Big Star on here, I sent a email directly to the restaurant expressing my disappointment and explaining what happened. Not too long after emailing Big Star, the General Manager Mark called me (which he had to track down as I did not leave my phone number on my email). He communicated that he received my email and felt horrible for what happened. He stated that what had happened was not communicated properly to me and that if he knew what was said and if he could have, he would have driven my order over to me personally. He seemed extremely genuine in his response to me and offered to have my food delivered to me right away.  I communicated that I had already ordered food from somewhere else and he immediately offered to send a gift card to me. Now, this was AMAZING customer service. I cannot yet comment on the food, but I am now willing to try Big Star sooner rather than later,  thanks solely to the GM Mark who gets a big shout out.  PREVIOUS REVIEW: 1 STAR: I am extremely disappointment in my experience this evening with Big Star. This way my first time ordering food to be delivered and first time trying Big Star. After placing my order online the food showed up really fast. After realizing that my order was wrong(they delivered someone's order who had walked up to order not ordered online), I called the restaurant which the lady who answered the phone seemed to not know how to handle this situation and did not seem to care. Finally, I was told that the restaurant was too busy to redeliver my food and that I would get a refund. TOO BUSY?!? I honestly find it ridiculous that a restaurant that makes a mistake on their end decides to tell their customer that they cannot redeliver their order. What kind of customer service is that? I thought that I needed to pass along this information and my disappointment, as I stated in the beginning this was my first time with Big Star and I had heard such great things about the food. After tonight, I do not think that I will be trying Big Star anytime soon. Wish Antique Taco delivered... :(",-0.5905,0.868,0.064,0.068,0.4572817460317461

Their food is overpriced and their staff is pretentious.  Went there last night with two other couples and headed straight to the bar. While we were ordering drinks we saw two booths open up so I walked over to the very unpolite hostess (either she was unhappy or just had RBF) who told me that I needed to wait to be seated. I was watching her put our name down and we were third on the list so I was hopeful that one of them would be ours.  In the mean time I received my drink, a vodka soda, which was actually tequila soda, everyone in my group tried it and agreed. When we told the bartender, two of them proceeded to tell me that it was made with vodka, CH distillery vodka, and their vodka happens to taste like tequila. Ummmm....I work at the building on Clinton and Randolph...I'm at CH distillery for happy hour all the time....their vodka does not taste like tequila and why all the sudden is another bartender jumping in telling me, ""I watched her make it. It's vodka."" Instead of a lesson on ""this is how vodka tastes"" can you just offer up another beverage other than tequila soda? I prefer to drink my tequila in shots. I can't sip it with soda water.  And why did another bartender have to jump in? Eventually, I was the one to ask for another drink and was told that it was the only vodka they serve. Shouldnt I be offered something else since I'm clearly telling you I don't like how the vodka soda tastes? Make a suggestion on another drink possibly....one that doesn't taste like tequila soda. As this was going on, the hostess walked up to my husband to seat us at one of the booths but since we were still trying to figure out why I was given tequila soda. She gave the booth to another group. Eventually all 6 of us were sat at a 4 top aluminum table.  My husband and I left and got real tacos elsewhere.

If you're coming here for the drinking, then no problem with that. The food is what I have the problem with. No it's not bad food, but it's overrated. You will hear people describe it as the best tacos in town, which is downright offensive when you consider the plethora of authentic taco joints in town that are much better, especially on the SW side of the city. The tacos are in no way bad, but they aren't even close to the best that this city has to offer. They are usually about average when compared to what you'd get in the Mexican parts of town (which are many). If you aren't familiar with tacos and think that Cantina Laredo offers great, authentic Mexican food, you'll probably think these are great too. However, if you have a lot of experience with authentic Mexican food and especially good tacos, you might be let down by these if you have heard the hype.

I really loved my experience there, not because the tacos were the absolute best I'd ever had (although they were still quite delicious), but because Big Star really excels at being a great late-night spot where you can wind down, sober up, and have some great drunk food. (I'm sure it's also wonderful all day every day in the summer, as their outdoor space looked awesome). My husband and I had two tacos each - 1 al pastor, 1 potato, 1 asada, and 1 chorizo - and enjoyed all of them, but I have to say the al pastor with the grilled pineapple was a favorite. Had I not had several other cocktails already that evening, I might have opted for their $3 whisky shot of the day, but instead we got 7 oz. mini Miller High Life's for $1! Very fun. Great spot in the heart of Wicker Park, and a place I will definitely return to for late-night eats and cheap beers next time I find myself in Chicago.",0.9953,0.732,0.253,0.014,0.5315843621399177

2014-11-16,4.0,"Taco al Pastor - You can really taste the pineapple, and the pork is a better quality than most, with strips of pork with more substance than what I have typically found in other such tacos with shredded pork. This is my favorite type of taco and I give this high marks.  Taco de Chorizo Verde - I almost didn't get this, but my wife suggested that I ask if they make their own chorizo. They do, and it shows. This is not the typical chorizo taco with the signature electric, red/orange grease running down your wrist. It is very flavorful, less greasy, and perhaps seasoned a bit more subtlety than usual. It was very good plain and also good with the tomatillo salsa on the table. While on that subject, the red salsa on the table had a distinct chili powder flavor reminiscent of what I found in New Mexico many years ago. I love chorizo, Mexican and Spanish (the latter being my preference), and this version was a little bit off the beaten path, in a good way.  Taco de Panza - I wanted to like this more because I love pork belly. Maybe I didn't love it because I really loved the al pastor and chorizo. There was  nothing wrong with this whatsoever, but this was third place for me.   Good guacamole with a strong lime component. Small beer selection on tap. LOTS of whiskey to choose from. Not horribly crowded, but I came on a Sunday, mid-afternoon. Friendly staff. Could not call ahead. The phone rings and when it picks up it asks you to enter your number. Huh? Typical Wicker Park crowd. Loud old school rock was blaring, which was funny as I assume that the 25-35 year olds had no clue what they were listening to. I was probably the only one there who could sing the chorus to Sunshine of Your Love.  Cash only. Well, I'm a small business owner. Can't blame them.

No. Is it a nice, laid back place, with very good tacos that warrant making a special trip to Wicker Park? Yes.

This place has indoor/outdoor seating, the aesthetic is on point, the food is great, and the staff is quick and polite.  We were in and out super fast, which is good when you have a Tour Mangaer that feels like you ""don't have time"" to do A-N-Y-T-H-I-N-G, so there's really no reason NOT to come eat at Big Star.

I was extremely underwhelmed. Somebody told me that they had awesome, authentic reasonably priced tacos which being from Los Angeles made me excited. I moved to Chicago a year ago and have been on a hunt for awesome Mexican. Unfortunately Big Star was a Big flop for me. Tacos are around 3-4 dollars which is fine until one of our tacos came in a Frito lay bag which was a sad attempt at being original. It looked like something you pick out of the trash and notice a homeless person threw up in it. It tasted so mediocre and was not appetizing at all. The taco sizes were way to small and it immediately makes you hate that you paid 3 dollars for it and how dumb you look when you see how tiny these things are. ALSO, I was royally insulted when I saw they charge $37 dollars for a ""pitcher"" of margarita. Mind you half of it was ice and we barely got 4 glasses out of it. Unless that was Anejo Tequila which I know it wasn't. there is no reason a margarita pitcher needs to be nearing $40 dollars. It was insulting, over-priced and the fact that they are only cash just adds to the annoyance of this ""taco joint""  I will not be revisiting this establishment.  3 words -- overrated, unoriginal, overpriced  I hope this helps anyone who is on a search for REAL TEX MEX.",-0.7195,0.81,0.085,0.105,0.5907407407407407

But this is a fun spot to grab some tacos for sure, and their queso fundido was super tasty--nothing quite like melted cheese and poblano and some pretty tasty fresh tortillas to brighten up my day.

2014-09-20,5.0,"Very belated review for their amazing catering service. Margaret, the catering coordinator, was spectacular during the catering planning for our wedding in 2013. I know that there are a lot of people with strong opinions about wedding food and how it should be done, but frankly I'm not that person. We like their tacos. They would deliver them to the venue. That sealed the deal for me.  But Margaret blew all of my expectations out of the water! First, before we even booked our wedding or Big Star tacos, Margaret was already paving the way for us. She had traveled to the venue to convince the somewhat uptight event planner that Big Star was a respectable-enough taco joint for this place. Some other bride had gone to the mat for them and strong armed our venue into allowing the tacos months before we got there. We all won for that, so thank you, May 2013 bride.  After securing service at the venue and our business, Margaret really rocked that ""coordinator"" label and spoke with literally everyone involved in the planning to make sure they had what they needed. Because it's a wedding and why should anything be easy, that meant she spoke to the table rental people, linen people, venue people, server people, and my mother-in-law who wanted to help with decorations. The woman rang my mother-in-law to figure out where she could put her table decorations. There's no way she's being paid enough for this kind of nonsense, but she was so cheerful and helpful, I have to think she enjoys it. I was called exactly once to make sure I was ok with everything. I immediately high fived myself for choosing such a great caterer.  The food was amazing - so many compliments (which everyone is going to do at a wedding anyway, but my photographer is a pal and pulls no punches, in addition to having been to hundreds of weddings, and she was floored by how good everything was). The servers they brought were kind and helpful. Everything was fresh and hot. The whole room smelled like guacamole. I've never been happier. (Also, wedding day. Wedding day + guacamole is about as good as life gets.) The restaurant is always fun, always a good time. But you already knew that. Their catering service, and Margaret in particular, really blew me away.

To put our name on a list for a table.  So we stood by the bar while waiting for our table.  I can see the charm of this place, if you go there with a large group of friends to drink, (the drink prices were very nicely priced, pitchers of margaritas, tequila shots, etc) finally got our table after waiting another 20 mins and order fish, pork, and pork belly tacos.  Fish was overly cooked and tasteless, pork was dry and burnt, and pork belly tasted the better of the three, but too burnt and salty.  Order nachos with two different types of fresh home made salsa.  Now what do you think they means?? You guessed it, ketchup bottle salsa sitting at the table.  And it taste like.. Bottled salsa with tostitos.  If I knew better, I would've just ordered from the take out stand next to the bar and save my self the trouble. I can see the charm of this local place if you are a local but not my cup of tea and what I was looking for that night.  Bad food and horrible to make me wait twice.",0.7542,0.843,0.097,0.06,0.5084335839598997

But here's the problem.  This place turned over into a sh*tty bar which held its popularity pretty well, for a while.  But it replaced that awesome manager at the door (f*ck, I forget his name, but chill dude) who used to text you from his old iPhone when your reservation was ready with two weird chicks and an ipad. Big star blew up - and honestly it blew up because it really is a kickass place to grab tacos and cheap beers... and I don't think that'll ever go away. But here's the issue - this place kind of sucks now.  It's not the food, or the beer that made it suck.  I can head to 10 different restaurants in Pilsen and get cheap tacos and warm mexican beer.  It sucks because that awesome guy running the front door is no longer around, and instead you've got two girls with an ipad who can't look you in the eyes taking your reservation.  I drive 20 minutes to go here and get treated like I'm an asshole.  And it sucks because you've got too many weird ass middle aged men hanging out here, who used to feel out of place, but instead, once one of them infiltrated this fucking formerly beautiful establishment, the rest of them somehow swarmed. It sucks because I feel like I'm doing the waitresses a favor when I show up - not the other way around. It sucks because it lost its charm.  Which was this fucking beautifully cheap and chill bar in this semi-remote part of Chicago where I could bring my parents or go on a first date and not feel like I'm at Planet Hollywood.  So.  Big Star peaked and is on the way down.  Or maybe it's plateaued.  But my guess is that it turns into the Ed Debevic's of Wicker Park where we pop into 20 years down the road for some kickass porkbelly tacos and guac.  This place did well - but they got lazy.   Service went downhill and the good vibes there are dead.   Thanks for killing it for a while.  But you're not as good as you used to be.  I'll still be back.",0.9127,0.736,0.147,0.117,0.48907828282828286

2014-07-27,4.0,"I've been here plenty of times to form a good opinion about the place. First off, the drinks: I've only had their Micheladas & Margaritas, both which I absolutely love!  Be warned, their Micheladas can be a bit on the spicy side at times.  So if you suffer from acid reflux or don't like things too spicy I'd steer away. The food: Their guacamole, queso fundido, tacos al pastor, walking taco and frijoles were all phenomenal.  Their fish taco was okay, I've had better elsewhere.  They also had, what was called, a Sonora hot dog at one point, PLEASE BRING THAT BACK!  I could practically live off of that.  Every now and then they offer a tamale as a special, I'd pass on it as it's not all that great. Even though this place is ALWAYS busy, I've never experienced bad service.  My servers have always been very nice and attentive.  The service at the bar is as good as it can be; they have a lot of bartenders trying their best at serving a ton of people crowded around the bar. Side note, if you stand along the south wall, beware!  The darn vents build up condensation and drip on you!  Is there anything that can be done about that Big Star??",0.9681,0.811,0.139,0.049,0.5735714285714286

In my opinion i thought because they may be adding crack to whatever they are serving which keeps people coming back! (RELAX I'M JUST KIDDING) My girlfriends and I came here because we were craving Tacos and Margaritas! It was about 10 PM on a Friday night and we caught an uber over to this place. This place was so freaking crowded, i literally had to bully my way through to find a seat at the bar. I honestly think that we were super lucky to find 3 seats right next to each other.  First off their Taco menu is DRY. I mean it was a waste of my time reading the menu because they did not have STEAK. All that other rubbish that was on there turned me off, where i then decided i was just going to drink and then go to Flash Taco and get myself a steak taco. When my girlfriends got their Tacos they were pretty much disgusted by what was served to them. Since i have already made the executive decision that we were going to Flash Taco after we got some drinks in us; they both were on board with my decision (its not like they were going to veto this decision).  The music was too damn loud as well. I felt like i was in a night club and couldn't hear Jack! I understand that this is a bar but lord please turn the music down just a bit! Also the majority of the female bartenders were just RUDE! I was looking for a reason why they could possibly ALL have nasty attitudes but it wasn't like supermodels were serving me to have a stank attitude. Maybe its a trend in there that they all collectively decide to be nasty to paying customers. I really wanted to like this place but NOPE!

2014-07-14,3.0,"NOTE: If you have a big appetite, but not a big wallet, don't make this place a go-to. That being said, the food here is of high quality and is very flavorful. Unlike most Mexican restaurants, whose menus play in the ridiculously large space, Big Star limits their offerings to a handful of options that they do very well. It helps you make up your mind. $3 for a small soft taco is pretty high. And if you're a hungry guy (like my husband) you could easily be 10-12 tacos in before you actually start to feel full. But that means you're also $30-36 dollars in the hole. For one person. I know they're charging for the quality of ingredients, so perhaps this just needs to be a snack or light lunch for those of us who don't like leaving a place hungry. The pastor meat is amazing, brightened by pineapple. I asked for a side of it to go atop the Big Star salad, which ended up being a good-sized meal and very fresh. The guacamole was mediocre; you can get much better at Las Palmas up the road on North Ave or at Irazu on Milwaukee. My husband was raving about the chorizo tacos, and the tortillas are corn-based and scrumptious. If you like to ""be seen"" and talk very loudly to your dining companions, try to sit at a table.

I expected the wait to be a lot longer but within 30 minutes we were seated at a table on the patio. While I know waiting can be annoying I think the advantage here is that there is enough in the neighborhood to keep you occupied while you wait.  Once seated we needed a few minutes to browse the drinks menu and when our server swung back through for the second time we grabbed 2 gumball heads and ordered chips and guac. So so so so soooooo yummy! I can't say why I thought it was so good, I've eaten guacamole all over the country and in Mexico but this really hit the spot.  We took our time enjoying the sunshine, beers and appetizer. When we were ready we ordered three tacos each. I enjoyed the taco al pastor (delicious! the pineapple was perfection with it and it's one of the best pastor tacos I've had in a while), the taco de panza (perfectly cooked pork belly and the sauce that was on it was so damn good!) as well as the taco de pescado (this was seriously one the top 3 fish tacos I've had. I don't usually do beer battered fish tacos but it was amazing.)  I can't wait to come back here this summer, the food was delicious and the beers were cold. I will agree with most of the comments about the staff. They were kind of a pain in the ass. Pretentious and seemingly either annoyed about the fact that they're at work or just annoyed with people in general. I get annoyed with people in general too but when you're job involves dealing with people I think you should at least pretend to be happy about being at work. Maybe that's just me.

The fish tacos were delicious with a nice crunch from the batter and a good amount of slaw mixed in to provide a nice vinegary taste to balance everything out.

We stood in the sweltering heat waiting for our indoor/outdoor table for 2 for a weekday lunch, watching as party after party of 3 and 4 arrived after us, yet was seated before us.  The reason this was annoying was that there were a number of outdoor tables meant for 4 people that already had 2 women seated at them WITH THEIR HANDBAGS TAKING UP THE OTHER TWO SEATS.  Big Star, at least be consistent with your claim to need a minimum of 3 people to occupy a 4-chair table. Our waitress got our drink orders wrong but never came to check up on us since another worker brought out all of the orders.  So we put up with it.  Their next flub was that we had to wait another 20 minutes after the drinks and chips were brought out to place our taco order.  At times, the waitress was literally standing a few feet behind our table but was chatting with another employee and so did not notice us trying to wave her over.  As she finally walked past our table, I politely called out ""Can we place our taco order, please?""  Just as I finished uttering this question, she stopped at the table immediately next to ours, looked me in the eye with a ""How dare you call out to me"" stank, looked down at our empty table, and then completely turned away to see to the other table.  Did not even give us the courtesy of a quick ""one minute please"" hand motion or nod to let us know that she had acknowledged our need for service.  One of the worst waitresses I've ever had the displeasure of ordering from.",-0.631,0.89,0.048,0.061,0.44040404040404046

The batter on the fish taco was too heavy. fried fish tacos should have a light batter so you're not eating a bunch of grease and you should also be able to taste the fish, but it was a big piece of fish for a street taco so I'll give them that.

And there is reason... the food is really good and the atmosphere is fucking killer. For months now people have been asking me if I've tried Big Star and now I get it.  A huge patio, tons of interesting people enjoying tasty (and tiny) tacos, and something in the air that makes you feel like you're making all of the right choices in life. I ordered 2 tacos, the crispy pork belly and the chorizo. Both were really devine. Incredibly flavorful, perfectly fatty and just... good. But small. Super teeny tiny. I wish I had ordered more, which I will upon next visit.  So yeah, this place is pretty rad.

I don't expect to eat in silence - or anything close to it - but if I have to strain to hear the person sitting next to me, we've got problems.  And two, what's with the ID nazis at the door? I once ordered at the take-out window and was asked to pick up my order inside. When I tried to go in, the door guy stopped me and asked to see my ID. I explained that I was simply going inside to pick up an order, and he said it didn't matter. He still needed to see my ID. Okay... Are you a bar, or are you a restaurant?  I'm 28, so it didn't matter. It was just annoying.  Kudos for curbing underage drinking, I guess, but I once saw the door guy card - and let in - someone who was under 21. And this was around 9 p.m. So if you're going to let underage people in, why are you carding? Or at least carding so stringently?  Luckily, I rarely encounter either of these issues (the noise and the nazis) because I'm about a 10-minute walk from Big Star, so I almost always order to go. The food is insanely good, but the in-restaurant dining experience leaves a little to be desired.  I repeat: The food is insanely good.

There is nothing greasy on the menu. The Fundido cheese chorizo dish was the best. Definitely get that one. The tacos are well priced and the best you will ever taste. The chicken taco is very fresh with a tasty yogurt sauce, while the fish taco will prove tasty even if you don't like fish per say.   However, if you have never been here, I recommend you DO NOT GO HERE unless you are with someone who has been here before and understands how seating works. Most importantly, do not - whatever you do- attempt to enter the restaurant without being invited to do so. You must wait on the sidewalk outside until you are invited to go wait at the bar area. There will be a very scary bouncer to threaten you if you do not know what to do. If you are looking to fight someone, I would definitely recommend you wander around Big Star's sidewalk as you will be threatened by their hosting staff within minutes. He is rather unsightly with tattoos and is larger than your biggest friend. When you walk into the patio area to ask how seating works, he will simply clench his fist, cock his head, look you squarely in the eye and say, ""BACK UP"". By this point you will understand that your are not to enter the restaurant, but the inability for their staff to use their words to explain their needs will you leave you guessing as to what to do next... You will be left wandering around as to how to get a table at this delicious restaurant. It's a shame the staff are so violently threatening, as there is no need to be this way.

In Chicago however, this was maybe enough for one of us. 2) All tacos are served by default on a flour tortilla and are about the size of the average adult's palm. 3) The beef tacos with pineapple were tasty with tender beef - but a bit bland. 4) We all agreed that the chicken tacos were dry. 5) The fish tacos are breaded and deep fried. Generally the flavor is good-very good but I would've hoped for something less calorie heavy/not fried so I could actually taste the fish. 6) The tequila list is extensive and moderately priced. 7) The outdoor atmosphere was crowded but pleasant. We never went inside - had no need.  The bouncer at the door questioned my 20 and 17 year old sons but okayed their entry as they were with their parents. He was nice about it.

So we will wait in line to be allowed to find a space at the bar. The line isn't long. Luckily, there are free tables. But we will wait until the perfect one is available.

Bouncer looks like a hipster, go-with-the-flow kinda guy. So it's cool.  Cash only inside?  Who does that in 2014? My food truck takes a credit card. I'm sure a place with a foundation can too.

Went here on our taco crawl but since Big Star is a taco mecca, I knew we couldn't go wrong and as it turns out, was my favorite place of the day (out of 6). We sat inside as the weather was bit cool to be outside but I can see how in the spring and summer sitting on the patio, day drinking and putting away tacos like there's no tomorrow is not a bad way to spend an afternoon. We went there at 4:30 on a Saturday afternoon and waited an hour for a table for 6 so if you're hungry, plan ahead and bring snacks as you may be waiting a while as I don't know if this place has a slow time of day. High energy place with great music and a lively crowd. Wide variety of people in there but definitely skewed towards the younger, hipster side. As you can see by my picture, I am not even close to fitting that description but had fun none the less. Food was great with interesting tacos of the day as well as killer guac. Interesting selection of draft beers (local and national) as well as Texas favorites like Sheiner. Excellent.

2014-04-20,1.0,"We were visiting Chicago for the weekend and decided to meet some old friends for lunch at Big Star.  I've tried to visit Big Star before but it has been incredibly crowded that we decided to go elsewhere.  As we were driving up I was excited to see that half of the patio was empty.  When we arrived we asked to sit on the patio because it was a nice day.  They seated us in the shade right behind their door that was propped open.   It was chilly in the shade, and being from Wisconsin, we were so excited to be able to sit on a patio in the sun so we moved 3 feet to a table in the sun.  Immediately we were scolded and were told that we could not sit at that table because they were ""not seating that side of the patio yet"".  We told the door man that it was cold in the shade and we had wanted to sit in the sun.  His response was that we could wait for a table on the other side of the patio.  Mind you, the patio is literally just a big square with a small aisle down the middle. Also, there WAS a table of 2 already sitting on the other side of the patio that they were apparently not seating yet.  2 minutes later a few tables walked in and they sat them on the other side of the patio.   I then asked the door man if we could move over to the other side of the patio now that they were apparently seating that side, and he told me that I had to go ask the hostess.  So I walked inside and asked the hostess if we could sit on the other side of the patio and she told me that she would have to ask?! Then, she told me to go sit down and that she would find me.  Thankfully one of the tables on our full side of the patio in the sun opened up and the hostess asked us if we could sit at that table because moving us to the other side of the patio was unacceptable?!  I thought it may have had something to do with the servers, but the servers were working both sides of the patio.  I have worked in the service industry for years, and normally I wouldn't write reviews when I haven't had great service because I understand that shit happens.  However, I felt like I had to review this because it wasn't something that was a product of someone being slammed, it was just straight rudeness about not wanting to sit at a table on the patio where we were freezing.  If ANY of my tables asked to sit elsewhere, I would immediately say ""No Problem!"" even if it was going to be a small issue.  If we were not waiting for some friends to join us, I would have picked up my stuff and taken my business elsewhere.  Not only that, the food wasn't even that great! I've had much better tacos.  I can tell you that I will not be visiting Big Star again.",0.8734,0.894,0.062,0.044,0.46887896825396835

Maybe the Texan in me has made me a taco snob, but compared to other places in the area (Antique Taco, taco burrito express) Big Star pales in comparison.

It was so crowded that it was not even possible for me to squeeze past to use the bathroom during that insane wait time, so I had to run to another business to go. Awkward.  Service was friendly, but not particularly attentive. My water glass was empty for half the meal without any notice from our server. He didn't fill it until we were done eating and had been sitting at the table chatting for a while. I found the atmosphere a bit loud and therefore difficult to converse. That being said, I really enjoyed sitting outside. The atmosphere was charming for late summer. The fish tacos were highly recommended to me, so I ordered those and they were indeed delicious, though a bit overpriced for a small amount. I was still a bit hungry after finishing the tacos which is not at all typic for me, which could give you an idea of the portion. I recommend the tacos but I also recommend ordering something else! Three of us shared the guacamole, which was so plentiful that we struggled to finish it.  My first and so far only experience at Big Star didn't knock my socks off, but I enjoyed the food. I would certainly return here in the future though I will probably opt for a weeknight instead to avoid the big (hipster) crowds.",0.9829,0.807,0.142,0.051,0.6215391156462585

She aggressively made the drinks looking everywhere but our direct and then asked if we wanted to start a tab.  I asked to have my drinks on a separate tab and she insisted that she can't split a check... Say WHAT?! I've never encountered this there before... Is there new management?  Has the name of the drinking game changed? Feeling bewildered and bamboozled, I then asked to just one off my drink and pay for it then.  With attitude, she took my cash and I still tipped her $3.

My boyfriend always likes to try new and crazy whiskey, Big Star never disappoints. They have one of the best selections in the city. Though I love this place, I will say upfront that they are ALWAYS packed (for good reason) so you may wait and you may wait long! I usually put my name in at the front, then search for bar seats. 100% of the time! bar seats become available before tables but I keep trying. Though you may wait long to be seated, the food comes up super quick. Whether you are a local or in town for the first time, you must visit Big Star.",0.9938,0.755,0.23,0.015,0.4683884297520661

Other than that, worst service imaginable. I work in he service industry. I get what happens at busy restaurants. We had a table of seven that had to wait over 2 hours on a Wednesday night! And the tables we should have gotten were given to smaller parties that easily could have sat at the EMPTY four tops. But as the hostess said, ""they didn't want to sit there,"" leaving an open table and our party to wait even longer. When we sat down the waitress took our order and proceeded to incorrectly deliver three peoples food and not come back to correct it until ten minutes later when we flagged down a bus boy. the food is decent for the price, but based on how heinous the experience was I would never go back nor recommend it to anyone who doesn't feel like wasting an evening.",0.2789,0.845,0.083,0.071,0.47383040935672516
2014-03-04,2.0,"Given that this is my neighborhood taqueria, we come here quite often. When the chef changed a little while back, most everything went downhill. We have been in about 15 times since then - what used to be an incredibly consistent and satisfying taco is now inconsistent at its best and flavorless/unseasoned at its worst. The fish taco had changed and now been re-instated to what it was originally (tilapia etc) but each time I've had it (every time we go) its been either incredibly off-putting and soapy tasting, fried too long prior and cold, served without the mayo, and totally inconsistent. The al pastor used to be my favorite taco in Chicago but lately has been either overly saucy/greasy, lacking in any pineapple whatsoever (used to have at least some, never none), or cold. The new vegetarian options are also inconsistent. The tostado do hongos was good on a recent trip, but the flautas de papas have almost no flavor. The filling was unseasoned and was boring after one bite, and the sauce (salsa borracha) was stone cold. The food used to take time to come out, which helped me believe it was actually being prepared and heated up properly for serving. Now, after we place our order, it seems the food is out one minute later. Maybe some people like this speed, but to me it seems like nothing is actually prepared fresh or to order and food is sitting around cold waiting to be served. I'd rather wait for hot and consistent food. We miss the old Big Star.",0.9514,0.871,0.095,0.035,0.5267045454545455

I went to order margaritas and the bartender really impressed me by recommending we order a pitcher instead of individual drinks because it was a better deal, you have to appreciate that kind of service!  The margaritas were freaking delicious and definitely some of the best I've had in the city. They're just the right amount of sour and VERY strong. Watch out for those bad boys because you may be feeling it the next morning if you drink too many of them.  When we finally got seated at our table we ordered the chips and guacamole as well as the queso fundido. All of it was delicious and I could not get enough of the queso. I also really enjoyed the salsa they had on the table. For our meal we were all pretty stuffed from the appetizers so we all tried a taco for our main course. I had the pescado and it was so good! I've had fish tacos at a ton of different places but this was definitely one of the best and was much heartier than other fish tacos I've had.

We were told to be ready to wait about an hour for a seat which were definitely fine with - anything to put good tacos in our bellies!!! We got there around 10pm, and there was a line up outside the door. The line up, monitored intensely by the bouncer(?) was to wait to speak to the hostess - a little odd, right? There was a poor girl whose friends were inside and had a seat for her and they wouldn't even allow her to go speak to the hostess about getting in. Finally  they let her through to the hostess who then told her she couldn't sit there because there was no seat, but there was. It was quite off-putting. Eventually her friends got the waiter to come and get her. This was probably the worst part of the experience, it gets better from here. We got in and put our name down for 2, then went to the bar for some margaritas...when I say some I mean 1 pitcher - and then another from our new friends at the bar (I think you can see where this is going...) It is quite crowded and difficult to stand, luckily we were short and could cozy up to the wall and keep out of the way. About an hour later we got our table. Our waiter came right away and was ready to take our order, a few questions later I decided on: Poso Rolo: Super spicy and delicious.

The bartender, also, ignored us because she was under the impression that we weren't going to tip (we believe). We did tip her after we finished, but were dismayed we couldn't order more drinks because after we paid for the first round, we had to track her down to giver her the tip because she never came back. After some margs, though, it's hard to wait for the table we put our names in for--so we naturally just head over to the taco window instead because the tacos are out of this world and all we would have ordered anyway. I love the al pastor and the fish options are also very good.

2014-01-29,5.0,"I've been to Big Star countless times--which is not to say that the number of times is uncountable: I've just never bothered to keep count.  For the structure and formulation of this review, I will estimate that there have been at least thirty occasions over the course of Big Star's operation: sometimes for a swift duck, sometimes for an extended session; sometimes just for drinks, sometimes for a quick gorge, sometimes for a lengthy splurge; sometimes by day, sometimes by night; sometimes at a packed Friday-night peak, sometimes on a frigid, snow-burdened late Tuesday afternoon; mostly at the bar, sometimes on the patio, rarely in a booth, and often milling about a bit before my group scoops some seats. All of this is simply (a) to express that this review is the product of a very longitudinal experience with Big Star and (b) to illustrate a point about this bar, specifically, and maybe also something generally about reviews. After the first ten or so times (over the first year-and-a-half post-opening), I would have begrudgingly awarded Big Star three stars, and in my heart would have felt something between two and three more appropriate.  But I kept going--because I had friends who really loved the place, and because there *were* a few things I thought Big Star did exceptionally well (namely the de pescado and de panza tacos). And I kept going.  Over the course of another ten or so visits (maybe roughly the next year-and-a-half of operation), I began to regard Big Star--subtly and through a gnawing process of growing appreciation--as a solidly four-star establishment.  The margaritas--especially the Big Star Margarita, with its dose of mezcal--began to settle into a delicious, damn-dependable drink; the weekly carousel of three-dollar whiskey shots seemed to harmonize with my needs on any given night; the draught selection became much more well-curated, variable, and locally-sourced; I developed a keen taste for micheladas; they continued to refine and innovate their cocktail and food offerings. Now--a bit over four years into their operation--I consider Big Star indispensable.  It's place I actively crave at arbitrary moments, or after long spells of not patronizing, or when I'm drinking tequila at a less-satisfying bar in another city.  And in these instances, I covet not just what it purveys, but what it is; I don't just want to eat that great beet tostada from the autumn menu, or try that Quarter Mile Manhattan I haven't got around to sampling yet: more nebulously, I just want to haunt one of its counters or corners for an hour or three. But you *must* know when to go, and what to expect--and what you can tolerate--given the time you're choosing to go: a chilly Tuesday afternoon in late November is a great time to grab an immediate stool, while a Friday night at 8:00 is a great time to ensure you'll wait in cramped (but hopefully liquored) discomfort; and if it's the first warm, sunny, patio-perfect day of the year ... well you're probably better off waiting for another weekend, because everyone else has that same idea, too. Personally, a sleepy mid-December Sunday evening, snow landing lush on the large windows, twinkling strings of light glazing the wood and white paint with a limpid-crystal warmth, a shot of Overholt in one mitt and a pint of Gumball Head in the other, a couple tacos down the hatch and a couple more en route ... let's just say sometimes it takes a spell to develop things, be they restaurants, reviews, or one's personal little reveries and idylls.",0.994,0.877,0.107,0.017,0.4249930381509328

I've been coming here for years and it is always a great experience.  I've had many of my friends compare Big Star to bars that you'd find in Texas.  I've never been to Texas, so I will take their word for it. It's best to go in the summer because they have that great patio.  They have a lot of great cocktails, and I like to try something different every time I go.  The cocktails are more on the dry side, something I strongly prefer over very sweet drinks.  They have a really good variety of bourbons and tequilas. Order up some guac and a variety of tacos, and you are set for the night.  You order ""by the taco"", so you'll only get one of something unless you specify for more, but no worries.  They stuff the tortillas so that they are overflowing with deliciousness, and definitely worth the price. Possibly the best fish tacos I have ever had!  They often do special prix-fixe dinners with other restaurants in the area (like Revolution Brewing).  I recommend checking out their website so that you can take part in one of those. My only issue with Big Star is that they don't have other Big Stars in the city that I can also frequent.

We were told our wait would be about 20-25 minutes, but were seated in the back by the bar to wait. Since we had kids with us, we weren't sitting at the bar or ordering drinks. However, they came by several times to check in on us and offer us drinks while we waited. Even though we turned down the drinks, they brought us all waters. The wait ended up being a bit longer due to one of the tables staying long after they had paid their bill. We were seated in the atrium in a 4-person table so it was pretty tight. We put in our appetizer orders and very quickly got the chips and guac. DELICIOUS guac, and this is coming from a 100% Mexican family. A booth opened up and the staff offered to move us over to a bigger table. We accepted and they moved everything over for us. We finally got the queso fundido and it was really good as well. Perfect size for 5 people to have a couple of bites of it without getting too full.  Finally, the tacos. The Al Pastor tacos are my favorite. Absolutely delicious and rich. The fish tacos were great as well. The slaw on the fish tacos is a great addition. As always, throw some lime on your tacos! It always enhances the flavor! We also tried the chicken tacos, which were very good and had the queso fresco for an added dimension of flavor. My parents had the Panza tacos and said they were the favorite by far.

However I was just with my girlfriend so we had no place asking for a booth. We got seated and and we tried one of each taco and started with the queso fundido which was piping hot small cheese dip delivered with tortillas. It was steamy and delicious but I felt it lacked either a uniqueness in flavor or a lack in portion size for its value. We tried the al pastor, fish, and pork belly tacos and I was super satisfied with al pastor. The addition of pineapple is pretty genius and the whole dish was packed with sweet and savory flavors. The Fish taco was good and the pork belly taco excellent. Note: With the glass exterior, the sun can shine pretty brightly into the restaurant, and it happened to right on our table.

I had been to Big Star once before in the summertime when the patio wasn't filled with frostbite and Christmas trees for sale.  The lights strung around the restaurant now brought a holiday cheer.  This was Matt's first visit and I knew he wouldn't be disappointed.  We were there in celebration, to ward away the traditional case of Monday blues. My first visit, I split the chips & guac appetizer with a friend.  The avocado was fresh and there was the perfect amount of Serrano pepper included to make it zesty and flavorful.  The grilled pineapple in the taco al pastor was delicious.  Even the thought of combining pork, pineapple and onions in a single taco still makes my mouth water.  I concluded my meal with the walking taco, an item that I was a little unsure about at first.  Walking tacos reminded me of high school basketball games, mystery meat thrown in a bag of Fritos with unusually bright yellow cheese sauce.  The walking taco, however, was in a whole different league than any of the walking tacos I had ever had before.  Big Star's walking taco is the Lebron James of walking tacos.  The toppings were flavorful and fresh, the chili sauce with the perfect amount of spice and kick.  This time, Matt and I sat at the bar and evaluated their famous margaritas. I opted for the Big Star margarita while he tried the classic version. Both were very strong but delightfully combined the lunazul blanco with natural citrus flavors. All in all, the margaritas were a delectable and refreshing way to conclude Moday.

They're rude, swanky lifestyle is a must, and if you don't look a certain way you are definitely not getting into the hottest club on South Beach.  Well, I didn't know a RESTAURANT could be so discriminatory like the South Beach nightclubs until this past Saturday night. Let me give you the low down: My friends have been raving about this place the whole month I've lived here. I was dying to try their tacos! We had gone out to a few bars in the area and decided to give it a shot as a ""food coma after party.""  Fast forward to us being in the restaurant. It was packed. We put our name on the ""list."" The male hostess, which now I am convinced was pretending to be a bouncer at a hot nightclub, did not keep a list per say. He just said, ""how many are you?"" We responded, ""three."" He said it'd be a few minutes. We thought, ""no big deal. We'll wait.""  Well, tick tock tick tock TICK TOCK. Approximately half an hour later, if not more, there were about 5-6 empty tables. Since then, I had already personally went up to the male hostess and asked him what the deal was. Why was it taking so long? He kept telling me we had to wait and that was that.  So here's when his true colors came out. Full disclaimer: I consider myself a pretty good looking girl, I'm not conceited or anything, but if you see pics, you know I am not at all ugly. I was dressed in jeans, a long sleeve blouse, and since it was cold, I kept my coat on during the long wait.  Well, here comes a group of half naked girls walking in as if they own the joint. They open the door, say hi to the ""hostess"", and get a table immediately. WOW! Are you kidding me, guy? I was in awe. We tried to sit at one of the other empty tables (one of the ones the promiscuous girls did not snatch from us) and were told that was not allowed.  So I personally went up to the male hostess once again and asked him his name. Let me just tell you: he thought about his name for a solid 10 seconds so I'm assuming it wasn't his real name and he didn't give a rats butt if he threw a coworker under the bus. The name I was given was Peter. Was it Peter? I don't know. But I will give you a full description of the discriminatory male hostess so that people who walk in and see this guy, can immediately avoid the place like the plague if he is there. Or so that MANAGEMENT (the people who should be reading these reviews and should want to make these awful situations better) will do something regarding this insanity.  He was a tall, black guy, not super dark skin, but a lighter black complexion. He did have an oddly shaped head (sorry to say) and was bald.  Please, for the love of God, Big Star. Do something about his discriminatory actions. Sorry I wasn't dressed to his expectations. Maybe if I was, we would've gotten a table, I would've fallen in love with your tacos, you would've had a new, devoted customer, and my friends would've continued dining at your establishment.

This particular night, we tried the chips + guac, al pastor, chicken, fish, and potato.  My favorite, by far, was the al pastor- the grilled pineapple sweetness complemented the well marinated pork just right. It also helped that the taco was absolutely heaping when served! The chicken, fish and potato were all fine (I wasn't a huge fan of the chicken, to be completely honest) and the chips + guac were actually quite good. The chips were thin, warm, and crunchy (with a little extra salt) and the guac was as good as I've had elsewhere.  Just wish that for $8, there had been more guac to chip ratio. Prices are a little high- $3-4 for one of most tacos, sometimes a bit higher than that even. Given it's also a cash-only joint with minimal service, definitely paying for the trendiness. I can easily see myself back at Big Star, whether for a taco from the window next summer, or a late night at Violet Hour.",0.9818,0.823,0.146,0.031,0.5256689342403629

We went here with a group of girls/guys tonight hoping to spend a significant amount of $ of beverages and tacos and to show my newly-moved-to-Chicago friend an awesome spot but only to be treated like second class citizens from a bald, rude doorman named Peter.  We were initially told that there was no seating/waiting list at this time, so we figured we'd have to be responsible for seating ourselves. After waiting the 30 min I previously mentioned, I approached a busboy and asked if I could take the table he was cleaning, or any of the other empty tables right by it. He pointed at 'Peter' who then began repeatedly yelling at the top of his lungs at my husband to 'wait a damn a minute.' I couldn't take any more disrespect after seeing random girls given tables that arrived after us so I just walked out. Never in all my years of being loyal to an establishment have I been treated to extremely poorly.

I was pleasantly surprised and satisfied! The walking taco was sooooooo interesting. I had no idea what to expect, so when it came out in a frito's bag I started to scratch my head like, huh? The mini frito's bag was filled with corn chips, chilli, etc. All of the ingredients were swimming in that bag so I grabbed a fork and had at it. Delish.

The queso fundido was delicious, obviously, because melted cheese makes everything taste better-- it's essentially a pile of melted cheese with chorizo and poblano peppers (?).

2013-11-12,4.0,"I started going to Big Star because a personal friend of mine(a yelper as well) told me about the tilapia fish taco's there. When I initially went I was stunned by the tilapia fish tacos. I immediately began to go regularly. I adored the tilapia fish taco. I fell in love with them you can say. I told my whole family and many friends too. I also told a lot of strangers on the public way. For instance I would be at the grocery store and would strike up conversation with strangers just to tell them about the amazing and adorable Tilapia fish taco. Then suddenly, the inevitable happened. It was sudden and without notice. I went to Big Star for a regular routine order of 6-8 Tilapia fish tacos. I just called them ""fish tacos"" to the waitress because they always knew what I meant. When I got the tacos I knew instantly that these weren't the same. They looked dried up and strange. My first bite was horrible. It turned out that they changed the type of fish in the taco. It is no longer tilapia but CATFISH......yea I said it... That's disgusting. It's also a cheaper fish. I instantly felt like vomiting when I made this discovery..... Also customer service has gone down hill...... Enough said..... So sad *I am adding some more information to this review. Since I wrote all of the above, Big Star has contacted me and assured me that the tilapia fish taco is back. I changed the one star rating to three based on this information. I'm going to give them another chance and if the tilapia fish taco is back to what it was then I will rate this place a four. The next thing I'm hoping for is the quality in customer service to return as well. If that happens then this place will be a five in my book. I will keep yelp updated on my next experience at the Big Star.... **I have decided to add even more information about my experience with this place and this may be my final update. Well the tilapia fish taco is back on the menu. No more nasty catfish. However the tilapia fish taco has not seemed to have been restored to its original state. I would have given the original tilapia fish taco 5 stars. The ones they have put back on the menu are like 3 and 1/2 stars. It seems as though either A. They have a new vender for the tilapia fish or B. The tilapia is cooked differently. Whatever it is it's just not the same. They are also very stingy with the chipotle mayo sauce that they use on these tacos now. Why fix something that's not broken??? To top it all off they have raised the price of the fish taco by $1. The okay tilapia fish tacos are now $4.   I feel somewhat betrayed by bigstar nonetheless we seem to have a love/hate relationship so I will be back again and again and again.

Wish there was a little more consistency across the menu, if so this place would be much higher on my crave list.",0.9069,0.835,0.14,0.025,0.499404761904762
2013-10-04,4.0,"I really like this place and have been many times between opening and now. This place gets a weird amount of heat for not being ""authentic"" for whatever that means. People get ideas about how things need to be and spend too much time getting in the way of their own happiness. But enough about that. Food = solid. Drinks = supper solid. The Taco De Panza was my go to taco for the longest time. Uncomplicated and flavorful. I ate so many I actually burnt out on them. Shortly thereafter they introduced the fish taco (Pescado) which I love. Has a nice slightly spicy mayo that keeps it interesting. They recently changed the type of fish and it's basically the same, possibly a little better. The chips and guac are always satisfying but the pinto bean dip is amazing. The walking taco is fun but you need to be in the mood for that kind of thing. The Big Star margarita is the best marg I've had. Not the typical cheesy poolside concoction that gives this drink a bad name but rich and smokey and makes you pucker. Favorite time to go is lunch on a nice day. It can get very busy at night, especially on the weekends. This is where it gets dinged a star because they don't always manage the wait well. They've been open long enough to know how their nights go. Sometimes they're on it. Sometimes they're aren't.",0.9903,0.799,0.178,0.023,0.5315350877192981

They open at 11:30 am, so we got there a little before, because the patio fills up quick.  We also brought our dog, since the patio is dog friendly.  Right when we got there, one of the staff brought out a water bowl for her, which was awesome.  They have a variety of cheap beer options and have a different $3 whiskey shot every day of the week.  Naturally, we started with $2 Blatz and whiskey of the day shots, and the Blatz kept on coming for the rest of the time we were there.  For food, we tried as much as we could.  Started with the Salsa de Frijol Con Quero (How's my spanish??), which was really good.  From there we ordered a variety of tacos, the Pastor, Pescado, and Panza.  I am not going to say they are the best tacos in the city, but they were damn good. To round out the meal we had to split the Sonoran hot dog (hot dog wrapped in bacon, loaded with taco fixings) and the Walking Taco, which is basically a taco in a Fritos bag. The Sonoran was a beast to look at, and to take down.  I was surprised with how good the flavor of the Walking Taco was, $2 well spent.  My Fiancee had the Esalada, which she said was just ok. Our total bill for all that, plus a good amount of beers was $60+tip, not bad at all for a lunch for 3 drinkers.  Some people have mentioned that the service was lacking, but I have nothing but great things to say about our server.  The place is cash only, which is annoying, but we knew that going in so it wasn't a problem.

FOOD HIGHLIGHTS: Queso Fundito - There was one Super Bowl Sunday in college when my friends decided to only communicate with the word ""queso"" to each other.... This queso deserves to be the only queso in the dictionary.  Taco Al Pastor - Marinated, spit roasted pork shoulder with grilled pineapple, onions and cilantro - It was my second time eating pork shoulder in 36 hours and man I could have done it again and again.  Tacos de Papas con Rojas - Potatoes rajas chipotle, queso cotija, onions, cilantro - Going meat-free was my attempt at eating one ""healthy"" thing for the entire vacation. The little cubed potatoes crumbled with the piecey cojita cheese very nicely.  EHHH: Sonoran Hot Dog - Bacon wrapped, pinto beans, lime mayo, mustard, onions, big star hot sauce on a bolillo roll - This hot dog was so spicy that I started sweating... and it takes a lot (Bikram yoga) to make me sweat.

Any time I have visitors come to Chicago, this is one of the first places I think of bringing them, as we can enjoy great food, drinks, and music - the visitors I bring here are never disappointed. First, the food: Taco de Panza - my personal favorite. The pork belly is marinated perfectly and delicious. Queso fresco and onion are good toppings. Pastor Taco - delicious as well, juicier than the Panza, and also sweeter due to the bits of pineapple. Rajas Taco - the ""meat"" of this taco is potato that is spiced very nicely. The spices are hot, and this is one of the heavier tacos, but I love it. I don't think this one would be for everybody. Pollo Taco - fall-apart chicken stewed in a creamy tomatillo/poblano sauce, topped with picked onion. Taste is more subtle, but this one is also quite good. Guacamole with chips - delicious, creamy, heavy on the lime. Tortillas are warm, crunchy, and nicely salted. We almost always start with this. Queso Fundido - melted chihuahua cheese with poblano peppers and chorizo mixed in. A very unhealthy item, but it is also very delicious (the usual relationship). Chorizo and cheese are strong flavors that manage to work very well together. Walking Taco - not that good. A bag of Fritos with refried beans and a big handful of shredded cheese thrown in there. Very cheap at $2, but it felt like I was handed a chip bag that mostly contained shredded cheese. Getting a table - not easy. At peak times, at least a 1.5 hour wait. If you're lucky, you can get a few seats at the bar, or eat at a barrel. This is unfortunate, but the place is very popular, so not much can be done about this. Service - surprisingly good for such a busy place. Wherever you choose to sit or stand, a server will be with you to take your order for food or drinks. They seem to run a very efficient operation. The cash only policy should be changed. Drinks - good deals on beer and whiskey ($5 for beer and shot, for example). Excellent selection of whiskey, small but decent selection of draft beer. Margaritas also very good. Overall, an excellent place to go with friends for delicious food and a great selection of drinks. 5 stars.",0.9986,0.73,0.244,0.025,0.6339211076280041

I don't mind waiting a long time, if I KNOW I'm going to be waiting a long time. I realize the wait is normally long at Big Star, but I still rely on hostesses to give me the most accurate waiting time. They told us 20-30 minutes and we ended up waiting almost 2.5 hours. We kept checking and they kept saying ""soon."" So we didn't leave. If we had known it was going to be that long, we would have just gone somewhere else.  There were 3 hostesses on staff and they all seemed like they didn't really know what was going on. They were doing shots at the hostess stand. I don't care how ""hip"" your establishment is, shots in front of customers during peak hours is just unprofessional. In many of the restaurants I've worked in, that would get you fired or at least reprimanded.  By the time we sat down we were so tired and cranky it was hard to enjoy our experience. If our server had been nicer, maybe it would have made up for it....but he was mostly just awkward.  I feel like this place is starting to skate by on reputation/popularity alone, and the service has taken a nose-dive. The margaritas are still killer though, I'll give them that.",-0.9329,0.811,0.07,0.119,0.40474537037037045

2013-09-05,4.0,"In Chicago, you don't find restaurants like Big Star, and that's why it's such a hit. The main reason is the atmosphere, which (at least in the warmer months, which is the only time I've ever been) makes me feel as though I'm on vacation somewhere in Florida or Texas. Big Star's huge front patio and lack of a front door are more common in warm-weather climates, so to feel as though briefly transported there is incredibly appealing when seeking a fun dining experience. The menu is tacos, straight up, with some chip and dip sides/appetizers. There staples and things change time to time, but there aren't tons of options. If you want choices, go to any other Mexican restaurant. Here, you choose between 6-7 different tacos that you order individually, which is great if you want a taco snack, don't want to fill up or just want to have extra money to spend on drinks or appetizers. On the menu, I personally like the Taco Al Pastor, and the Walking Taco is a tortilla-less taco served in a bag of Fritos, which is both tasty and highly amusing. Vegetarians who eat fish will have some choices here as well (read: fish taco, but there are others), which you might not expect with a limited menu. Chips and guac and queso fundido are also delicious. In terms of drinks, Big Star stands out for its extensive bourbon list, but there are some great cocktails (from the looks of it, I've never tried any) and the beer menu has both craft beers and Mexican-style lagers (though mostly in bottles or cans -- the tap selection is small). This isn't a place where you see everyone drinking the margaritas just because hey, it's Mexican-style food. Big Star is open late, like any place that serves this kind of food should be. You can also order tacos at a walk-up window, so if you just want to taste stuff and avoid the long wait for a table, you can. The full package of food and atmosphere makes Big Star a total standout in Chicago. They're the best specialty tacos I've had in the city, but then again, can't say I know anyone else offering specialty tacos ... this isn't Dallas/Fort Worth. Big Star is just a fun, different place to go grab food.",0.9881,0.85,0.118,0.032,0.4321428571428573

Certainly not worth a long wait, which is what you'll get on weekends and evenings. Go at lunchtime on a weekday and you have your pick of tables. It's a fun atmosphere, especially when the weather is nice. If it's a Saturday afternoon or evenings, go to Zocalo in River North instead.

I had a friend in town on a Monday night, and we decided we had enough to catch up on that we would enjoy a pitcher of margaritas and brave the wait.  The hostesses are always the most friendly of the staff and accommodate people as best they can.  We waited against the back wall by the bar where there is a ledge and stools, which makes it a little more bearable. After about an hour, we were finally seated and ordered the guacamole.  It is always so fresh and delicious.  I ordered two fish tacos and a potato taco.  I should never ever stray from the fish tacos because they are always out of this world.  Love them!

For service, it was a while after we were seated before the waitress came by to take drink orders.  We were ready to order food also at this time, but she walked away before we had the chance, so we had to wait a while again for her to come back with drinks to place that order.  We were out of water quite often (many other tables were given pitchers of water, but we were not).  Also, after ordering, one of the employees took my walking taco away before I was done with it (yes, it is in a chip bag, but hopefully you could tell there was something still in it?  And couldn't you have stopped when I tried to get your attention to tell you?).

Unfortunately, the quality of the food did not match the drinks! The tacos were pretty bland, especially the fish taco.

Very hard to get a table especially on the weekend. Plan on a good 1-2hr wait. They do have a bar area inside where you can order drinks and apps while you wait. If you're looking for a quick bite, I'd recommend just grabbing your tacos from the pickup window on the side and they have community picnic tables you can sit at. Again, awesome food, very fresh and full of flavor!         The only reason why I'm rating 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the horrible seating system. Hostess stand is totally unorganized and can't even give a time estimate. I understand it's a busy and popular place but they are about as useless as a pencil with no lead.

It was the perfect night to sit outside and enjoy the ambiance.  They also don't seem to pressure you to leave the table as many parties around us had been sitting there talking and drinking long after they finished eating.  If you have time to spare, not too hungry and wiling to wait, then it'd be worth it.  Otherwise, check out the take out counter next door and order the tacos to go!  Also, don't forget to bring cash - both places are cash only.",0.9919,0.842,0.138,0.021,0.5044146825396826

I like the de panza (as does the rest of the city) and al pastor, but don't sleep on the vegetarian options: the potato taco and summer squash tostada are both packed with flavor and hold their own on the menu. The queso fundido makes the mark too, in all its cheezy chorizoey glory. And the patio is perfect for a breezy summer night, always buzzing with energy and facilitating a good time. The best thing I can say about Big Star is that it's remarkably consistent, especially given its popularity.

We have taco trucks littering construction sites (and you better believe, you out-of-towners, we have construction all year long). Needlesstosay, I was not expecting what I got in Chicago.  The place is crowded, all the time. The vibe is not what I would have expected, a clear cut Chicagoan crowd. I was clearly an LA girl, stood out a mile in any direction.  Mr. Cotter ordered us $3 Tecate in a can along with our individual tacos de panza.  YUM is the best way to describe this food. The pork belly was cooked to perfection and a lot of given in such a small shell, a bit, though, of overwhelming seasoning. Could've used less, as the pork belly was so tender and succulent in itself.  The corn tortillas were warm and soft, not once falling apart in my hands or mouth. The juices dripped freely, which made the cheese so intoxicating.  A little cilantro went underneath the cheese, giving it a freshly green flavor.  The limes from the Tecates actually greatly enhanced the flavoring, making me wonder why limes are ALWAYS used?! It's almost like garlic. Except who wants garlic in their beer? This was a great pick me up (a ""num-num"") to help with the exceptional cocktails served at the Violet Hour. I would go again, if just to listen to the jazzy vibe (played on a turntable, nonetheless!), the boisterous crowd, and the $3 Tecate in a can.",0.9843,0.859,0.133,0.008,0.4719696969696969

""how many bites does it take to get to the center of the taco de pescado?"" ""one and a half."" i think $3 for this is a little steep, especially considering that the taco is just blah. there are better street tacos in the area that are cheaper in price than this.  - walking taco $2: again, not very impressed by this. it reminded me of the haystack cafeteria meal i used to get as a kid (chili cheese fritos). it took me back, but it's something i can make at home for cheaper. overall, the service was good and the casual ambiance was great, too. in the end, i felt like that's what i was paying for, not the food.",0.9917,0.823,0.16,0.017,0.5106410256410256

First, parking is horrendous in the area. If you aren't close by, like us, you have to plan to go when it isn't peak time so you can park and get a seat. Few things are worth that trouble off the bat. The wait staff is awkward -- I understand that aloof hipster vibe is trendy, but I'm not into it. The tacos are pretty legit, but don't expect something authentically Mexican (head down to Don Pedro's in Pilsen for that). The fish taco is probably my favorite. There's a generous portion of fried fish filet, some slaw and a great chipotle/mayonnaise-y sauce.  In terms of whisky, the pricing seems nonsensical. Some of the crappier booze will cost more per shot than some of the better stuff. And in the end, you're better off from a money-strandpoint heading to Binny's and buying a bottle. And $3 for a bottle of Coke? Someone needs to get a fountain. Last time we were here our tacos were nearly cold when we got them.

Because I'm not, I and my fellow patrons are the reason you have a job.  Anyway, my point is, Big Star has great food, and most of the servers are good. In fact I have a few I remember specifically because they are awesome. Generally servers are around minimally to take your orders, check up on you, and close you out, with a large backup staff of runners and bussers, so don't expect an intimate, walked-through experience. This is turn and burn, folks, but there's nothing wrong with that.

2013-07-19,1.0,"Holy hell, this place is a effing mess. Avoid unless you enjoy a deafening crowd and extremely sub-par food and general disorganization.  Tried to go here around 10pm. Sounded like a thousand children were eating in a tiny cafeteria. So much noise (I've been a drummer in a metal band, I'm not afraid of noise, but good lord, try'nna eat here). Hostess flippantly tells us it's ""at least hour wait"" so we tried the To-Go window.  To-Go window took a while as well, with people just sort of pushing their way up en mass. I was ready to knuckle sammich some frat boy gringos. Then we order, under high pressure since there's a thousand people behind us and you can feel their burrito anxiety. (Settle down champs, eat a light snack before you go out FFS.) Then they close the window after we order.  After a while, the *same* window opens (despite having a pickup window with no line in front of it) and they start calling numbers. So we have to push our way back into the same crowd at the front of the line, with the frat boys acting like we're cutting, and trying to get our food along with the other 3 parties called back. Really dumb.  We got a little of everything. Nothing was great. The best I can say is they did give us a gigantic bag of warm chips (like the family size at the grocery store).. BUT they gave us just a few tiny cups of salsa, so small the chips don't even fit in. And **everything** was really spicy, which I love, but one person in our group couldn't eat because it was too spicy (no mention of this on the menu).  Hey management, is anyone even thinking any of this shit through?",0.9445,0.779,0.129,0.092,0.46511111111111114

I always ask for recommendations from industry folks and get an array of cool places to go eat that i wouldnt have normally sought out. With the EL train stopping and stuck, i got off in Wicker Park and started walking around. Who know when it would start again, so i changed my dinner plans to food hopping. first stop, Big Star. All coincidence that i was told about this place a few weeks ago and then id end up right next to it.  The place is crazy packed. Line, wall to wall people, drinking and partying. You could say that it was a bit of a shit show. Since i was hopping, it didnt matter that i got a seat so i went to the take out window. A pork belly taco, sit on the benches, and watch the people. No bourbon (too early) but a good taco. A bit on the pricey side but of solid quality ingredients. A later came to realize, that this is one of Paul Kahan's establishment, whose hospitality group ive become a fan of. This concept and clientele seem quite different from his other ventures but it seems crazy successful, so kudos to the group.  I think this place requires a bigger group to return with with some bourbon and other drinks in the mix.

2013-07-17,4.0,"Big Star, I think, is kind of like those corny Will Ferrell movies. If you go to see one expecting to see a corny Will Ferrell movie, you will be pleasantly surprised if you laugh a lot. However, once everyone starts talking about how hilarious the movie is, you go to see it with high expectations, and then don't laugh as much as you hoped. I stumbled upon Big Star randomly a few years ago, and since I lived under a rock (or rather, the suburbs) had no idea it would be good. I was pleasantly surprised by the cheap but flavorful tacos, and while my whiskey loving friends love their selection, I stick with the margaritas. Big Star is one of the few places where you can get a good margarita that is light and refreshing, and not poured out of a plastic bottle, at a reasonable price.  Unfortunately, the secret is way, way out. If I had to wait hours to try this place for the first time, I might be disappointed, because of all the hype and constant lines. Try ordering from the window, or if you want the full experience with no waiting in line at all.... go during the winter.

I honestly wondered what all the hype was about...until I tried it. The place is PACKED almost all the time and several times that I went I waited well over an hour for a table. However, if you don't mind being shoulder to shoulder with some randos you can usually find a spot at the bar while you wait. The food is pretty cheap in my opinion, and it's amazing. My favorite tacos are the al pastor washed down with a pitcher of Big Star margs. The pitchers are a little bit pricey but SO worth it. They are strong as hell and delicious. One pitcher split with a couple people is really all you need...but you will order several more, trust me. The micheladas are also really good. The patio is awesome if you get a chance to sit outside on a nice day but the inside is equally as fun. The decor is funky and the atmosphere inside is busy, fun, and cozy when it's freezing outside.

2013-07-05,3.0,"A good margarita will have a kick, but it won't kill you. That is the first of my nit-picky complaints for this wicker park tex-mex joint. The ambiance is great, especially for a hot summer day in Chicago. You have ample outdoor dinning space and they are very dog friendly. I even think they violate a few city codes allowing you to eat in the outdoor patio with your dog under the table. If all you want is a fun cool place to spend a summer afternoon/happy hour Big Star is one of the best places in wicker park. The staff is great and the location is awesome. But food counts and a hate to say I was unimpressed. I had their fish and chicken tacos. The chicken was the best, but the fish tacos (that were beer battered, baja style) were to dry and so thinly battered you could barely taste it. We ordered some chips and salsa and they brought us a plate mediocre chips. I ask were the sals was and the waitress pointed to two ketchup style squeeze bottles baking in the sun on our table (that was $3 bucks). So they skimped on the chips, but not on the margarita. We ordered a pitcher and half way through my first glass I had a strong buzz. Now I'm not a lightweight, but these things were strong; too strong to be honest. When I slowed down to actually taste it, it was apparent the concoction was about 40% tequila.  We ordered more food just to soak up the booze and I'm glad we did, because the queso fundio turned out to be the best thing we ate. Big Star isn't bad, it's just not great. You'll wind up waiting at least 50 minutes for a table on a nice weekend, but if you come here, you're not coming for the food.

Unlike almost all other restaurants, they refuse to tell you the duration of the wait you might expect after putting your name in for a table. Instead, they just tell you the number of parties in front of you. Which doesn't really help for planning purposes.  But they can do this, because it's so popular. This place is a money-making machine. And for good reason. The bar is pretty cool, decent whiskey selection, good margaritas, and, at least when I was there, the  music was great as well.

Let me start off by noting, I saw OK food, I have had over a million tacos in my life since I love and crave them constantly and have tried countless tacos place in Chicago, the US and in Mexico. The tacos are VERY pricey at $3 and really aren't that great. I would say if you want an expensive good taco go to Antique Taco not too far away in Wicker Park. My boyfriend is Mexican and said they are the almost one of the shittiest tacos he's ever had. Also the horchata, YUCK! Don't even try it, it's disgusting. Stick with a margarita or tecate here.  Secondly, I can't quite understand the hype here. As noted above the food isn't that great. I can only assume people line up here since the outdoor atmosphere is nice at a prime location near the Damen blue line. Speaking of lines, my last visit, I had a friend in from MI so I figure why not show her 6 corners starting at Big Star then heading to Violet Hour. I put our name down for a table for 3 (boyfriend was with us) and gave number they said we could walk around. When it was our time for a table, a very rude and I'm thinking racist man wouldn't let my boyfriend in since he wasn't right next to my side while putting our names on the list. Now I'm not just assuming the racist part as he let others though to be seated who weren't all there when putting their names on the list. He told my boyfriend to go to the back of the line but he would seat my friend and I.

This review however is specific to their catering business.  We placed an order with Big Star for a corporate lunch meeting in an attempt to be creative and wow our lunchers with something other than the standard sandwich.  We requested lunch be delivered no later than 11:45am for a 12pm meeting.  It was delivered at 12:45p. With each phone call to Big Star I received an excuse as follows:  --11:52am -- The driver is late due to the rain/weather (It rained at 9am this morning)  They will be there in 10 minutes. --12:10pm -- My assistant received a note that the driver had been in an accident. Yet the food was expected by 12:20am. 12:25pm -- It had arrived...according to Big Star -- still no where to be found. 12:40pm -- The food arrived.  However serving utensils, plates, napkins, etc. had not.  There was nothing to serve with even though it had been requested.  To top it all off the driver boldly told me I needed to tip him in cash.   The entire hour the food was in transit the Big Star staffers threw excuses our way. They also took zero responsibility because they use an outside delivery service. This is unacceptable for an established restaurant company as well as anyone that offers catering services.   In the end, the money was completely refunded.  However, it did not save our business lunch.  Beware if you're considering using Big Star for catering services -- the ""too cool"" vibe in the restaurant translates to their catering service.   A better option -- Cantina Laredo downtown gets it right.  Food was beautifully presented, they bring chaffing dishes and silver bowls and linens....for the same price!  It's a much better option.",0.986,0.843,0.127,0.03,0.3690848214285714

2013-06-18,2.0,"Just not as good as I remembered. I came to Big Star a long time ago when they had lamb tacos. They were so good and I've always wanted to come back for more. One of my friends suggested we come here for lunch, and I was really excited to revisit those lamb tacos. Sadly, no lamb tacos. So I got the Taco de Panza (pork belly), Taco de Pescado (tilapia), and the Taco al Pastor (pork shoulder). The pork belly was described as crispy. Mine was not crispy. But I did like the overall flavor profile. The fish taco was bland. I feel neutral about it. The pork shoulder taco was probably my favorite. I like that they add pineapple since traditional al pastor tacos don't have pineapple.  Guacamole. What is all the hype? This was truly the worst chips and guac I've ever had. The chips seemed stale. The guac was fizzy and limey like they put too much stuff to preserve it from turning brown. I'd honestly rather have slightly brown tasty guac that this nasty stuff. I just want fresh guac. Is that too much to ask for? I know you're always packed, but the quality of food should not suffer for it.  We also ordered the horchata and the housemade limeade. Seemed watered down. In general I just wasn't impressed with the food or drinks here. I don't think I'd return except maybe if I was driving by and wanted tacos to go.  Service: I didn't even recognize that our server was our server. At first I thought she was just a hippie who was trying to help out. She was wearing a loose dress and had no notepad or anything that would indicate that she was a server. Wayyy to casual for me. And didn't really provide ""service.""

Not that I need you to kiss my ass but you don't need an attitude. Service ""2 stars"": Our server seemed annoyed answering our questions. She did however recommend a good margarita. Speaking of the margarita, would it have pained them to fill the glass? I'm not a lush but it was filled a solid inch below the rim which means that at least two employees knew it was not filled properly (the bartender and food runner.) When we asked for our check the server walked past several times without dropping it off. Not a big deal until we realize she's over chatting with the aforementioned hosts. Food ""4 stars"" overall:  Salsa de frijol con queso ""3 stars"" - This was a pork, tomato, and onion dip topped with cheese and served with tortilla chips. It was good, not great. It had a decent flavor and wasn't overly spicy. My friend described it as something you could get at Taco Bell. I happen to like Taco Bell and I have to agree. Taco de papas con rajas ""3 stars"" - This taco contained potatoes, green chilies, cheese, onion and cilantro. Great flavor and absolutely nothing like Taco Bell! This taco was a bit on the spicy side but not overwhelming. I would recommend it but actually want to try some others next time. Taco de pescado ""5 stars"" - I did not have this but my lunch mate said it was the best fish taco she has ever had, maybe she will post her own review with more detail. She also had another taco which she didn't comment on. I can't remember the name of my margarita but it was amazing! It had several flavors including cucumber that blended together perfectly for a summer drink. Very refreshing and I would go back just to have another.

Just hit up the pick up window on the weekends or you will have to wait about 2 days for a table.   2. If you really want a table there, quit your day job and go during the day on a week day (it's worth it...I swear). 3. Order fish tacos. Lots of them.  4.

With one of your friends coming off a full work shift with no food.  Now, imagine rejoicing to have your your name called, only to feel crushing disappointment because you were, in fact, waiting to have your name put on a second waiting list for inside the establishment.  Which is not drizzly, but as loud as any rock concert you'll ever hear.  There's no place to sit, so you stand there with your drink and get in everyone's way.  And you get hungrier and drunker and more annoyed and more deaf with each passing minute.  All 75 of them.   After two hours of waiting, you're seated, and soon after, your order's taken.  Soon after that, the food comes out.  Cold.  The pork belly taco is bland, but it gives you a nice vehicle for the delicious salsa verde.  The guac is good.  Keep eating that.  The fish taco is cold and chewy (?), but more flavorful than the pork belly taco.  The tortillas are actually pretty good.  Then, less than five seconds after putting your fork down, someone on staff comes to take your plate away. You tell them to back off.  It's the principle of it, really. You have the right to sit there for a ridiculous period of time, too! Damn it! Hell, you just pay your bill and get out of there.

2013-05-07,2.0,"First off this place is always packed.  On our second attempt we just went with ordering from their takeout window and that still took 20 minutes standing in line.  We ordered everything except the potato taco as tacos without meat are like Christians without Jesus.  It should be noted that this is one of those places that only accepts cash which is always irksome, but more forgivable for hole-in-the-walls of which Big Star is most definitely not. They managed to completely forget our order and somebody else's as well despite a straightforward number system (I imagine them going ""hey what is after 66?"" and coming up with 68).  We brought it to their attention and they promised us some extra tacos as recompense.  Eventually we get our food after at least 30 minutes standing in line and then the being stuck in limbo. So we open our bag to see what are honestly some small tacos for three or four dollars each.  I mean we are talking taco truck mini taco (or normal tacos depending on your frame of reference), except no taco truck has the balls to charge that much for one taco.  Also, they wrap multiple tacos together in one foil and by wrap together I mean it is not possible to tell where one taco begins and another begins.  Other people around us were similarly chagrined at their order of two tacos turning into one megataco.  Furthermore, we did not receive any of the extra tacos we were promised.  We didn't particularly want more tacos but after forgetting our order and then trying to assuage us with extra tacos, to then forget the extra tacos was adding insult to injury. That brings us to how they taste.  Let me start by saying that the chicken taco was mediocre, hell it was veering into bad and the filling itself looked dreary with its sad and limp cucumbers.  The fish taco is pretty standard fried fish entree at a mexican restaurant, except any other place you can get a huge burrito for like five bucks that is as good or better.  The two pork tacos were much better, but come on, it's pork and these are dirt simple tacos. The walking taco is interesting if not my cup of tea and more suited to a taco truck.  We also had some guacamole, which while tasty was a freaking rip off at 8 dollars when the chips aren't even freshly made.  To be fair every place tries to rip you off for guac.  Avacados aren't THAT expensive. If I could get in and out without any line and without them messing up our order and just ordered pork tacos, maybe I would come back.  But the stars will never align like that and even if they did it would still be a tiny three dollar taco.",-0.7979,0.804,0.089,0.106,0.47939747327502424

We arrived shortly before opening on a Friday and waited behind a larger group. Once they opened, the ""bouncer"" made it clear he would let them in first because they had arrived first. No big deal, until he started checking IDs and none of them could find theirs. The three of us, standing with ours in hand, had to wait while they dug through their belongings to find them. Not a huge deal, but this should have been a sign. When we were seated, there was literally one other table. Things started to fill out steadily, but given the first-come, first-serve attitude of the bouncer, it seemed like we'd be helped relatively quickly. No. We were not. We waited about 10 minutes to place our drink order, which took another 15 minutes to arrive (and they were just not good, at all). By the time the ONE waitress got around to taking our food order I was about to give up and just ask for the check for the drinks. Honestly, I'm glad we waited because the food is the saving grace of this place. Yes, it is just as good as all the reviews say. Interesting flavor combos, and moderately prices. However, waiting forever while watching everyone around us get served before we even got to order really burned my bacon. My advice?

I've gone shoulder-to-shoulder at the bar, enjoyed some sun on the patio, got snuggly in a booth, and even leaned up against the banister just to have a drink and down some tacos.  I have attempted to get something in addition to the tacos in my most recent visits and I have yet to be disappointed. Jalapenos, solid. Queso fundido, slammin. Guacamole, off-the-chain.

The only factor preventing me from giving this place 5 stars is the wait time. I finally ended up making it to Big Star on the 3rd attempt after my previous attempts ended when I saw the size of the line waiting to get in and encountered an extremely rude person directing the line. What I learnt was that if you want to have a good chance of getting a table quickly, pick a Sunday night. Mind you, the restaurant was full that night as well but at least we did not have to wait long for a table. Once you do get a table though, the atmosphere is great and the food is delicious!

I recently ordered the DIY taco bar + delivery service for a bachelorette party.  The ordering process was a breeze, Margaret was incredibly helpful.  More importantly the delivery and packaging was awesome.  The food was delivered promptly when requested by a friendly driver.  We ordered the middle package (3 tacos per person for 22 people, chips and guac, and an ensalata Big Star).  The food was all packaged tightly and all of the toppings were labeled clearly as to which tacos there were supposed to go on.  The tortillas arrived warm and wrapped to stay that way.  More importantly, there was SO MUCH FOOD!! Big Star is known for it's affordability and the catering was no different.  We had insane amounts of leftovers, so my one piece of advice is to order for a few less people than you actually have. Of course, the food was just as wonderful as it is had it been ordered from the restaurant itself.  Pastor, pollo & panza were all cooked perfectly.

They have a spicy kick and the meat is tender. The pork shoulder is my least favorite. Not sure if it's the pineapple I don't like or the meat. On to the plantains....I could eat these forever. They are perfectly grilled and the cheese, sauce, green onions...basically everything they put on top of the plantains make for a perfect combo. Also tried the pickled veggies on the side which I could have gone without. We also tried the bacon wrapped hot dog which was good but be warned...it's really messy!

Not only is this whole taco sweet because of the pineapple, but the meat generally taste nothing like al pastor. The stomach taco was just eh. Ok. It was generally pretty bland because of a lack of seasoning but it tasted more like an actual taco than the previously mentioned.  The margarita was WAY too strong making it unenjoyable. I asked them to put more juice in it which made it better but more sour.  My favorite part of the meal was the chips. The salsa was not spicy enough. My friend (also Mexican) barely picked at her tacos. Plus, $4 for a taco? Seriously? I can buy real tacos for $1.50. Most likely will not go back unless it's against my will.  **The waiter was SUPER nice",0.983,0.767,0.176,0.057,0.4830208333333333

2013-02-26,5.0,"The experience begins before you even enter the space with the unmistakable smell of homemade tortillas wafting through the air, beckoning Wicker Park locals and non-locals alike into the square, one story landmark that is Big Star.  Upon entering Big Star you are greeted by a smiling bouncer and an array of small metal tables with mustard yellow chairs.  Just past the entrance the room opens up to a large, rectangular, lacquered, wooden bar and several large wooden booths. Floor to ceiling windows at the front of the restaurant (conveniently removable during the summer) let in bountiful amounts of natural light. The decorations are minimal: a single string of Christmas lights line one wall, Big Star t-shirts hang on another while a large light up ""tacos"" sign adorns the back wall.  In the middle of the bar atop an island lives an impressive collection of single-barrel Bourbons and Whiskeys as well as a wide variety of Tequilas and Mezcals (A different $3 Whiskey shot is offered every day of the week).  Six draught beer taps adorn the front of the bar, offering tasty craft selections. The vibe is very ""Wicker Park"" with a California-low-key-hipster-badass feel.  Once I walk in, I choose an empty seat at the bar.  For a Monday afternoon in the middle of February, Big Star is not lacking in attendance; the majority of the seats in the restaurant are occupied.  I am greeted by a badass lady bar tender who was very attentive and nice but not at all overbearing. I am immediately given a glass of water, a one-page menu describing the Mexican-street-food inspired delicacies, and a leather-bound menu containing beverage choices for those of the ripe age of 21 and older. I wasn't going to let the fact that it was a Monday afternoon stop me from tasting a Big Star Margarita, which seemed to be a favorite as I looked around.  The margarita is served in a lowball glass and is shaken to perfection.  It is more tart than sweet but is still refreshing with the lingering taste of Lunazul Blanco Tequila.  Don't be fooled by the small size of this classic beverage because it packs a pretty big punch. To help curb my hunger as I perused the menu I enjoyed an order of fresh tortilla chips, guacamole, and salsa.  The house-made tortilla chips are served warm and were not over-salted, which I admire in a chip.  The guacamole is simple and fresh, as guacamole ought to be.  I must note, however, that while the guacamole is good, it doesn't merit the lofty $8 price tag.  The spicy salsa verde and the smoky salsa roja, both homemade at Big Star, are delectable and unique in flavor.   Now, on to the really good stuff. Seeing that Big Star is known for its tacos, I decided to try three of the five that are offered.  The Taco de Pescado delivers exactly what one would want from a fish taco.  The tilapia is impeccably fried with an irresistible beer-battered crispness while the chipotle mayo, cabbage, cilantro and lime tie everything together and simultaneously give you the creaminess, crunchiness and freshness of the perfect fish taco.  Then there is the Taco de Pollo which contains roasted chicken thigh tossed in a spicy, salsa negra.  The chicken and salsa sit atop a generous spread of black bean crema which offers the taste buds some relief from the spiciness of the salsa.  This lovely creation is finished off with crumbly cotija cheese, crispy fried onions and cilantro. The Taco de Panza is easily my favorite: a freshly made tortilla envelopes crispy bites of braised pork belly smothered in a heavenly tomato guajillo sauce and topped with queso fresco, cilantro and onion.  The slight crunch of the pork belly mixed with the lightly smoky, almost fruity, sweet heat of the tomato guajillo sauce is beyond moan-worthy. I would gladly eat ten of these, but that might be unsafe considering the food coma that was induced just minutes after finishing my meal. Overall, I would give Big Star a 9.5 out of 10 (-.5 for over priced guacamole!).  The restaurant is clean, the wait staff knowledgeable and friendly, the drink options potent and varied, and the food is OUT OF THIS WORLD.  For me, Big Star knocks other taco joints out of the ball park not only because of the amazing flavors the food delivers but because this place is just genuinely welcoming and makes you feel good.  I will definitely be back to try the Sonoran Hot Dog and the Queso Fundido along with another Taco de Panza or two.",0.999,0.809,0.168,0.024,0.45554029304029314

I only grabbed a couple tacos and ran, so I can't speak at all to the bar side of this establishment, but they were incredible. The meat was transcendent, well spiced and had just the right mix of fat and meat. Little elements like the queso fresco on the panza and the pineapple mixed in with the pastor gave each one some additional character beyond ""meat, onion, cilantro on a tortilla."" A lot of my love comes from tripping across this place at about 1 AM. With no lines and excellent tacos, I left a very happy man.",0.966,0.789,0.175,0.036,0.5783882783882783
2013-02-23,4.0,"Big Star is very popular, and I think it is for good reasons.  The place has good food, good drinks, and good service.  As far as I'm concerned that makes a great restaurant. I came here at 6pm tonight (Saturday) for a birthday dinner with 8 girls.  I was surprised that there was already an 1.5 hour wait at 6pm, and that they were at capacity. It didn't take us very long to get inside, where we were able to stand around the bar drinking until our table was ready.  The bartender was quick with drinks. There are large booths here, which was good since we had a large group.  We fit all 8 of us snugly in the booth. I may be too old for places like this because I thought it was too loud.   We ordered chips and guacamole and plantains as appetizers.  The guac was very good.  I wasn't a fan of the plantains, but I only like sweet plantains not fried ones, so that is not Big Star's fault. Our server seriously had her shit together.  She didn't even blink an eye when at least 4 of us ordered food without dairy.  (And even more amazing, when I ordered the potato taco with no cheese and the fish taco, she told me there was mayo on the fish taco and asked if I wanted it without mayo.  I love when servers catch hidden dairy in things and let me know.  It means they are awesome). While the server did a fabulous job taking our order, the delivery of the food is a bit odd.  They bring out all of the similar tacos on the same plate, rather than bringing each person a plate with their food.  That was a bit harder for us since we had 1 vegan at the table, 1 person who doesn't eat dairy or pork, 2 that don't eat dairy but eat all meat, and 4 that eat everything.  Our orders were obviously a giant pain in the ass.  It would have been a whole lot easier if the orders were served as ordered.  But then again, maybe most people aren't as difficult as I am.  But it was annoying because I ate a pork taco thinking it was a potato taco. The guacamole and the fish taco were my favorite.  Someone else had the beet tostado and loved that.  I wish I had ordered that because it looked really good. They have Mexican coke and Mexican fresca.  Mexican freca is awesome, everyone should try it!

With that said, Completely disappointed!  I couldn't believe all the hype after my experience. I've had buddies and Chicago's Best on WGN say this place is fantastic.  Looks can be deceiving and this place lives up to that cliche.  My wife and I went there today, Saturday night, around 6:30pm.  The place was a mad house.  The door guy told us it would be a 1.5-2 hr wait.  Crazy!  We were ready to walk out but the door guy said we could go in, since 2 people had left.  They weren't letting people in prior because they were at capacity. We went to the bar and ordered 2 Modelo's. We got lucky when 2 ladies suddenly left.  We were pretty excited as we sat down to get ready to order.  We ordered Frijoles Charros, which were decent, but not for $4, as the bowl was pretty small. Tortillas were good as they are made fresh. The chiles torreados were also good, but how hard is it to char jalapeños?  Now for the disappointment. We ordered 2 tacos de panza (pork belly) and 4 tacos al pastor.  For $3 each, you better get a hell of a taco with a normal sized tortilla. Tortillas were small, but the tacos were stacked.  They looked good, but as soon as we bit in, my wife and I looked at each other with a disappointed look.  The meat for both were on hard and on the colder side.  You could totally tell that the meat had been sitting in the kitchen for a while.  The flavor for each taco was not good, however, I haven't experienced a great Al Pastor taco yet in Chicago, but this was one of the worst.  I was hoping to like this place, but I can honestly say I will not return.  The best part was that we didn't have to wait 2 hrs to eat.  We ate within 15 min since we got lucky at the bar.

2013-02-22,2.0,"Okay, last update.  After traveling to BS a number of times, you start to notice how inconsistent the food can be. For example, I got the pork belly 3 weeks ago and it was one of the best tacos I've ever eaten. I got it twice over the last 2 weeks and it went from good to down right awful. The pork ranges from nice and tender to tough like it's been sitting around for a few hours. My jaws literally started hurting after chewing through one last week. Another example is a mate ordered a chicken taco and it was half full. I ordered one and it had twice as much filling. The dulce de leche milkshake can be nice and creamy one week to icey and cheap tasting the next. You may have a taco with some ingredients missing from when you had it before. And why the hell is the chicken taco $4? I recently went on a Wednesday and our waitress was horrible. She came over after me and my party had been seated for 15 minutes and asked ""when did you guys sneak in?"" We didn't sneak in, you just haven't been in the area since we got here! She then commenced to screwing up our order twice, bringing drinks 15 minutes after ordering them and refusing to check in to see if we needed anything. She also had an attitude because a friend who came late didn't know she was our server and said ""out waitress hasn't been around in a while, can we order from you?""

I wasn't a big fan of this taco joint. Was it good? Pretty. Was it worth it? Maybe. Now, the very reason I give it a three-star, while most others prefer to associate the restaurant with four-star, is because I like the simple taco. You know, meat, onions, cilantro, lime... all the simple stuff. I had the Tacos Al Pastor and the Tacos De Pescado. And my, did the tacos sound delicious on the menu. Unfortunately, the grilled pineapples on the tacos didn't seem to attract my taste buds so much. It was too sweet and fruity for my liking. Also, the chipotle mayo on the fish tacos overwhelmed me. Although they were pretty tasty, it wasn't what I hoped for. Nor did Big Taco become my go-to joint for some hip way to eat Mexican food.  I write all this because my review wouldn't be helpful to the reader unless he or she understands the reasoning behind my three-star. If you are a food junkie for grilled fruit and heavy sauces, such as chipotle mayo, than I won't be surprised you falling head over heels for such a place. But for me, Big Star didn't fit the standards of my perfect taco. So here I am, giving it a mere A-OK.  On the other hand, the beer-battered fish was cooked superbly! And the atmosphere is very hip, unorthodox. Perfect place for late-night groups to hang, eat, and drink. So if you're ever in the area, I hope you get the chance to try it.

Here's where I have problems, friend.  I've eaten a taco or two in cities closer to the border, past the border, and all points in between in my short two centuries on this earth.  So I think I have some experience with tacos.  More so, I think I have some idea of what to expect in a ""gringo"" sort of Mexican restaurant (not enough Norteño).  Things I don't typically see: bizarre salsas (which are rather bland hot sauces in squeeze bottles), very little tequila, and a weird look when I asked for a Chelada.  No matter, I'm perfectly happy with a Lone Star (and the bartender was shocked when I asked for the cap) and the whiskey special that day, the acceptable (and nothing more) light spice of Old Overholt. I say ""light spice"" as a rather poor way of foreshadowing all of the food at Big Star: not spicy.   Again, with my extensive taco experience (I've had at least two ""Taco Supremes"") I was a bit disappointed with my $4 a pop al pastor tacos.  First off,  I have read the origin story of Big Star (Mr Pedro Ordonez) and how he came from the DF (Mexico City) and missed the taste of a genuine Al Pastor taco when he was in med school, so he opened up Big Star.  Well he really must have missed it because these tacos taste nothing like Al Pastor tacos I've bought for change in Mexico, from late night windows in Denver and LA, and generally in any city or place in or near Mexico.  Maybe he's marinating the meat okay (meh, I couldn't taste the guajillo if it was there), but usually the pineapples you get on your Al Pastor don't taste like the one it was cooked with.  Usually you get fresh onions and some cabbage (not on these puppies).  And in the DF and anywhere else that actual ex-pat Mexicans live in droves, you're going to get them on corn tortillas.  (If you're going to use flour tortillas at least use the kind made with lard, not the ones that yuppies smear Nutella on... I am one of those yuppies, FWIW.) But Big Star is a rebel and assumes you know nothing about tacos (they don't either).  Big Star with their bland sauces (what about some El Yucateco Habenero?  That stuff is a dollar from a bodega in any Southwest city), gross salsa, and crowds of faux-hipsters and old dudes in pony tails.  Big Star with the poor service and blah atmosphere. Oh well.  I guess if you're in Chicago and you must have a taco... you should drive out to Lawndale because these tacos suck.",-0.9047,0.862,0.055,0.083,0.4419339164237123

This local establishment treats guests to the finest street foods south of the border.  I've been here on a few occasions to try the multiple, purposely limited menu options and have yet to be disappointed. The tacos are literally some of the best in the city and are only about $3 a pop.  So if you want to test out your appetite with a few beers, you can do so quickly, easily and with plenty of variety. My only complaint? They fall in to the dreaded ""small beer glass"" club. I just don't get why it's becoming so trendy to give you less beer for the same amount of money. It's like some restaurants all get together like classic movie villains and determine every year to make beer glasses smaller and smaller whilst twirling their over-sized mustaches.  I just want a pint of beer with my delicious taco.  I wonder if they would frown upon me bringing my own?  Although you probably wouldn't be able to tell with the over-sized mustache and all... Overall, Big Star's a great place with great food.  Lines can get kind of long in the summer months (reference ""sweet outdoor area"" above), but if you get there early enough and/or you're willing to wait, you'll be able to enjoy some great food in the heart of Wicker Park.",0.9787,0.811,0.147,0.042,0.5349647266313933

A bacon taco is a no brainer.  But for some reason, they always come out of the kitchen at room temperature, always.  I assume they have tins full of pre-prepared meat to better accommodate their high volume of orders.   But at four dollars a taco, there's no excuse for this.   Same with the horchata.  It's pre-prepared in cups with ice so it's watered down. I mainly came here for the ambiance.   The layout encourages interaction with other revelers which I very much appreciate.  It's amazing how many places fail miserably at this.  During the day,  skylights drench the place in natural light and the patio is unmatched in the area.  But in the end, I don't think any of this is worth being demoralized. There's a very good chance you'll encounter some ignorant yo-yo at the door blinded by his or her moment of authority.  For example,  I once went there to meet a couple with my girlfriend at the time.  The patio is in front of the establishment and so they check IDs right before you get into the patio area.  Anyhow, I walk up with my girl and the door guy says there's a wait.  Ok sure.  I don't mind waiting.    Any buzzed about place in Chicago has a wait during busy hours.  But my friends are literally 10 feet away at one of the patio tables.  I calmly said ""Look, those are my friends over there.  See those two empty seats? Those are for us.  Yo!  Wassup Steve!""  I wave to my friends and they wave back.  The door man slowly rears his vacant head over to the table and back at us.  He tilts his head back, looked down his nose at us with his  jaded dead eyes and says ""You still have to wait"".   What?!     I immediately know what's happening here.  There's a lot of standing space inside but it's about 7 pm so they're trying to attract attention by generating a line. I try to reason with the guy but there's only so much you can say about a situation as elementary as this.  Then comes the words that all doormen live to say.  ""Look, I can do this all day""  coupled with a shrug.  Why so smug?    This isn't the Met Gala.  It's a taco joint. Of course you can do this all day.  You're an idiot and idiots excel at mindless jobs.    After standing in the ""line"" (me and my girl were the only standees) for about a minute and exchanging bewildered looks with my buddy who was already sat, I decide it wasn't worth it.  Realizing at this point  that I have nothing to lose,  I decided to tell the door man what I thought of him which was most definitely worth it.  Needless to say, I lost any chance of getting in at all at this point. I have an apartment that I rent out to tourist.  Almost every guest I host is blown away by how friendly and helpful total strangers are in this city.  This is truth and it holds true in almost every other bar/restaurant I've been to in my 10 years of adulthood.  I can make a list as long as their lines of places that have excellent decor, food, and customer service but I wont.  Well, maybe just one.  Antique taco is just a few blocks away.  My point is,  nobody has to put up with this rubbish.   Lastly, being hispanic,  I refuse to perpetuate the irony of privatizing a food that is synonymous with accessibility in my home country.   Stop it Big Star, you're embarrassing yourself.",0.9826,0.816,0.115,0.068,0.4838048552754436

After two rounds of drinks, we were too lazy to go anywhere else, so we deciding on getting a couple dishes to share. With vegetarian restraints, there was only a couple things on their small menu that we were able to order. We asked our waitress if the Queso Fundido could be made vegetarian by omitting the chorizo, and they happily obliged.  The first dish to arrive was the beet tostada (Tostado betabel). I am not a huge fan of beets and my husband is not a big fan of goat cheese, but we were both completely floored by this dish. Everything was perfectly balanced and thought out...the spicy goat cheese, the pumpkins seeds, and the roasted beets with some acidity, all came together perfectly. Definitely my favorite dish! The Queso Fundido was delicious, but isn't that to be expected from hot, bubbly cheese with fresh tortillas?  Lastly, we had the Plantos Fritos, which were a bit like fried patties or fritters. A little dry, but still a interesting twist on fried plantains.  My only complaint was my drink. The La Paloma was very average, a little on the sweet side and had very little tequila. I don't know if I ordered the wrong thing or if the bartender was having an off night.

Big Star, located on Damen & Milwaukee in Wicker Park (I swear I eat in other neighborhoods, I just really enjoy this corner of town!), should go down in the record books for most ridiculously amazing tacos in all the lands. We tried all but the 'vegetarian' tacos, well because I think animals are tasty (Take that PETA!). Tacos Al Pastor (marinated, spit roasted pork shoulder, grilled pineapple and onion, cilantro) my favorite Taco De Panza (crispy, braised pork belly, tomato guajillo sauce, queso fresco, onion, and cilantro) Taco De Pascado (Beer battered Tilapia, chipotle mayo, cabbage, cilantro, lime) my fiance's fave. Taco De Pollo (roasted chicken thigh, salsa negra, black bean crema, corjita cheese, crispy fried onion, cilantro) All of the glory was loaded inside corn tortillas, which in my opinion or the only tortillas for tacos! And for $3 a taco (besides pollo which is $4), I may have overindulged a bit. Its a busy little place, so we sat at the bartop, which I prefer a lot of the time. The shelves are stocked with any and every whiskey I've ever heard of and then some. The bartenders change out the music and play old vinyls, which adds to the kind of 'hipster-esque' atmosphere. It used to be an old gas station or something from the looks of it. Very industrial architecture.  The service was good. I wish I could have said GREAT, but we were walked past a couple of times with empty drinks and spicy salsa. I give them the benefit of the fact that they were balls to the walls busy, which they are almost all the time. Nonetheless, I would absolutely return and try some other menu items.

I strapped the kid into the stroller during a long day slaving away as a nanny and I was delighted to find that we weren't far from Big Star. I wasn't sure how long the kid would keep quiet so we settled on takeout. At the window, the girl was not helpful at all. I asked which was the most popular, she didn't know. I ordered the chicken, the beef, and some type of fish taco. I waited 15 minutes at a picnic bench and out came my tacos in a brown paper bag (just the way I like it). Upon returning home and putting the kid down for a nap, I discovered that the tacos were soggy. Probably my fault. The fish taco was extremely chicken. The chicken was just alright, and the beef was tough. I had had such high expectations for this place which made my experience all the more detrimental to my happiness.

If they are, skip ahead of them (politely), and present your ID to the doorman/woman, and ask to go to the bar. You can usually go right in if you're not trying to get a table. There, you just saved 15 minutes standing behind Buffy and Stacey.  3. When you go inside, go immediately to the back of the bar...all the way back by the bathrooms. Order your first drink here, probably while standing, because the bar is usually fully occupied. 4. Now you can stalk for a seat to open at the bar.

Everything about our visit to Big Star was disappointing other than the tacos. We received the worst customer service I've experienced in Chicago and I've lived here 10 years. Right when we walked in we were stopped and asked for ID's which I found confusing because its not a bar, noone even said hello or welcome. I wasn't sure where we were allowed to sit because staff were hovering around the entrance so I thought perhaps we were limited to the patio area so I asked and the guy at the door said sit wherever. We walked back to a table in the main restaurant and there was a sign on the table that said ""reserved"" so I asked the bartender if we could or couldn't sit there and he said ""i dunno, ask the guy at the door."" I walk back up and ask the same guy who didn't acknowledge me when I walked in if we could sit there and he said ""yeah its fine."" so I walked back to the table and sat down. Whew! Already an ordeal and haven't even ordered my beer. The server was a nice person but had ZERO curstomer service skills and it showed, BIG STAR time. Everything was rushed, the food was slopped down on the table and before we were even finished with our last bites bus boys were coming to pick up our dishes. The entire experience felt rushed, forced and impersonal- what a let down Big Star. Since when are restaurants 'too cool"" to be friendly and provide service?  When we asked for the check the server brought it, saw our debit card and said ""its cash only"" and walked off. No explanation that there was an ATM if we needed it up front, no mention of it upfront (first time visitors we had no idea) and then, this is what really got me, we stood up to put on our jackets and she slid her arm behind my boyfriends back grabbed the cash from the table and walked off.

2012-10-16,4.0,"Big Star is a good Mexican restaurant that uses quality ingredients and makes strong drinks.  That being said, they still need to work on a few things that I will go over below. A group of us went to Big Star on a Saturday night around 7pm and after a 10 min wait we were seated on semi-comfortable metal lawn chairs.  After sitting for a few moments it was clear that due to the above-normal volume it was a good place to meet with friends but not a place for a romantic date or a dinner with family.  We often had to talk above the normal volume to be heard.  The background music was playing at an above normal volume which added to the already high buzzing noise. Let's talk about food and drinks.  This is the category that Big Star gets high marks on.  We ordered 3 tacos: Taco De Panza (pork belly), Taco de Papas con Rajas (potatoes), and Taco de Pescado (tilapia). All the tacos were served on a flour tortilla and had distinctive flavoring.  Out of the three, the Taco de Papas con Rajas was my favorite as it had the right mix of spice and the crunchiness of a deep fried potato.  We also ordered a side of chips.  The disappointing thing about the chips was that on the menu it said that it would come with 2 special homemade sauces.  When the chips came to the table, there was no sauce in sight! Instead we were told to use the 2 sauces in the plastic squeezable bottles on the table.  Here I was expecting some delicious never before tasted sauces and instead I was squeezing the usual green and chipotle sauces.  They also didn't give us any bowls to put the sauces in and had to essentially spread the sauces on big plates and scrape it off using the chips.  I am only being so analytical about the chips since I was paying for them instead of being presented with customary free chips that are given at almost every sit-down Mexican restaurant.  We ordered two tequila based drinks: Big Star Margarita and Classic Margarita.  The classic tasted like a strong margarita made from quality tequila and the Big Star had an amazing aftertaste of smoked BBQ for some reason.   Our server was nice and attentive and she was constantly checking on us.  One important thing to note is that they only take cash.  I wish they would have let us made aware of this beforehand but we thankfully had enough cash to cover the bill. Overall, Big Star is a good place to meet friends for some tasty Mexican food and strong drinks.  But don't bring your date or family and definitely bring cash to pay for above-average prices.",0.9958,0.835,0.142,0.023,0.4462428571428571

While we finished the wait for the table we each ordered a few tacos from the pick-up window and sat in the picnic area. The tacos are exactly the same, only difference is you can't order alcohol, and you're semi-removed from the energy. After a Pastor (pork) and Pescado (fish) taco, we walked into the bar area and I had their signature margarita. Possibly the smoothest margarita I've ever had for less than $15 (only $7). They mix in a special Curacao that really adds to the citrusy-sweetness of the drink. Once seated we racked chips with an order of guacamole and an order of Fondido, a warm cheese dip with mixed in chorizo. Both were delicious, only criticism is that they served us four flour tortillas with the Fondido, meanwhile we were a table of three, it wouldn't of taken much for them to give us six, and we would of never known otherwise if they gave us three. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the tacos more than anything else, with the fish taco taking the cake. Big Star's food is worth 3.5 stars, but the atmosphere pulls it all up closer to 4.5 territory.

He had an Old Fashioned and I had The Rambler, which was enjoyable, but incredibly sweet. Then, our luck changed as we snagged two seats at the bar. Next, I ordered the Bakersfield Buck and he ordered the Tiger Eyes. Our bartender, Casey, came back with beverages that were marvelous; we could taste the effort that went into their creation through the layers of flavor.  For food, we started with the chips and guacamole which were disappointingly ordinary. Both items had a very distinct lime flavor, I would have much preferred something with a kick. Next we ordered several tacos: al pastor, de panza, de papas, and de pescado. I'm glad we went with a variety, but the panza was the clear winner. Spicy, flavorful, moist, this pork belly was cooked to perfection. All the other tacos were great, the papas were really spicy, pastor very sweet due to the pineapple, and you only pulled the chipotle mayo flavor from the fish tacos (least fave of the bunch).

Wow right?? Anyway, whatever....we decided to wait b/c there were plenty of bars within walking distance that we can wind down and grab a drink. But we decided, hey let's give them 2 numbers in case it was too loud or whatever reason for assurance, give them 2 phone numbers we can be reached at.  My friend went up to the list to add her number and the bouncer, yes they have a BOUNCER, was so rude and said she couldn't step up here.  I swear...these ppl treat you like 5-year olds, first day in kindergarten or something.  So it was another 10 minute wait before my friend was allowed to step past the bouncer into another ""inside line"" only to wait 5 more minutes before she can add her phone number. So we go down the street to 6 Corners, a chill sports bar, to hang out and wait to be called. An hour passes, both phones don't ring but we decide to head back thinking ""ohh our table should be ready soon.""  When we get there, my friend again reapproaches the bouncer and goes thru the same nonsense process before being able to talk to the girl that writes down the list.  And we learn that yes they did call us to tell us our table was ready but gave it away since no one answered.....well get this, we asked her to repeat the phone # and she freakin called the wrong number!!!!! seriously, how incompetent are these ppl, wasn't that the whole point to give TWO phone numbers!!!

So the tostadas covered in mushrooms aren't an option for me because if I wanted a fungi, I'd just call my boyfriend (puns!), but the taco option would be good if they didn't make it so hot that it was un-edible. Seriously. Even my friends who can withstand more mouth-heat than me made worse faces then they do when taking a shot of malort.  So I stretched my pescetarian legs and tried the tilapia. My exact words after eating it were ""I wouldn't yelp about."" But alas, here I am, yelping about it. Cause it made my taste buds so bored they considered taking up knitting (no offense to the knitting community). Also the margaritas weren't great. Also we waited an hour and a half.

Yep, it's a gorgeous 60 degree friday alright. Of course they have their typical two hour wait. We decide to have fun with the shops on Damen and get some cash to fulfill their needless cash-only policy. We stop in a bunch of stores, come back an hour and a half later, only to be sneered at by the silly young hostess. Merlot socks though, and that's the color of fall. So she had one thing right. Merlot is the ""it"" color.  The It color aside, she smiles viciously and tells me that it is going to be an exponential amount of time until we are seated and she can't even think how long it will be, but it's not the two hours she told me. She suggested that we have drinks at the bar while we wait for that unknown period of time it will take to get a table. I said that we wanted to eat and the bar wouldn't cut it, but then she just smiled and said nothing. I felt like she had told me to go screw myself, but I just thank her and walk away to discuss it with my buddy. I don't know who waits around for 4 hours to eat $3 tacos, but I can be sure that Big Star is trying to give off the same vibe its' owners' other establishment has. Well, Yelpers, Big Star is certainly not Violet hour and not even close to deserving the same discerning attitude. You can find better tacos and margaritas at 5 places less than a mile away in that area.  So Big Star, give up the 'tude. You are not Violet Hour and never will be, and your popularity will fade. Unless of course, Big Star turns into an ""I Robot""-style plan and tries to kill us all. Believe me, the hostess'  condescending smile certainly could have.  Until then, Big Star, I say no thanks.

2012-08-06,4.0,"This is an interesting place to say the least.  I lived in Arizona for over 10 years where the Mexican food is the best so I have to say the taco's were just ok for me.  We ordered one of each, favorite was the fish and worst was the potato (and I usually love potato/veggie dishes).  The frijoles were delish and served with 2 tortillas...actually liked my little bean and lime tacos I made more than the others.  We also had the Huitlacoche tostada which I was very disappointed in.  Once you have Huitlacoche in Tulum you will never be happy with any US version of this dish...at least that has been my experience. Even though the wait can be annoying I REALLY like the fact that they call you (from a blocked number) when your table is ready.  So smart, I wonder why more place don't do the same thing.  This practice also helps support other businesses in the area as people bar hop until they get that call. Although the food was not up to par in my book, the pro's made up for it.  The margaritas were so strong I could not finish mine, tasted more like a shot which is a great deal for the price.  My husband finished mine and had a few more, I had a beer (very cheap at $3).  The food is very well priced and you could easily have a few tacos and a drink and get out of here for under $15.  Mix that with the awesome patio, fun people watching and overall vibe and I would say it is worth checking out.  Some have mentioned the staff has an attitude and I do agree with that but it doesn't really bug me.  They are ""cool kids""...pretty much hipsters working at a taco place...whatever....I could care less about their attitudes.",0.9835,0.818,0.15,0.032,0.4963471177944861

I think this place is vastly overrated and overpriced. I went here for lunch the other day and after my first taco I wished I had stayed closer to work and just gone to Taco Joint like I usually do. So much for changing things up. I usually don't like complaining about the price at places but I felt like I didn't get what I paid for this last time around. The one thing they do get right here is they grill the pineapple and onions on their al pastor, nice job. I actually kind of like this taco, but that's about it. And this taco is accurately priced. But they charge $4 for their chicken taco, which uses the thigh meat, not even the breast. And the red onion would be better if it was pickled. This one was ok, but I wished I had ordered another al pastor. Their guacamole is good, not great. But for $8, no thanks.  Another thing to add is the people who work there that I have encountered seem a bit snidey. Could definitely do without the attitude. The only reason I can see people liking this place is because of the their patio. But if you are looking for taco's go a few minutes east towards Lincoln Park to the place I mentioned above.

This place was packed with customers, and i wanted to know what the hype was all about. (I *was* in wicker park, so maybe they were giving out free pairs of TOMS? fixies? tats? well whatever they were doing it was working very well) After hearing mostly good things about the food, i decided to venture out to Big Star for lunch today with the expectation that it would be my new fav lunch spot.   My boyfriend and I got here around 2, and despite it being the supposed ""slower"" part of the day, it was bump-a-lumpin'. We were greeted by a friendly host and managed to snag a table outside. We had a chance to sit in the bar, but we decided that the chance of us turning into sweat buckets were fairly slim, plus it was our chance to be outdoors-y? her..her.. The drink menu was extensive and filled with craft beers. The prices were super reasonable, and most of the drinks were $5. I ordered a Lagunitas ""A Lil' Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale"" for $5, and i was pleased because most bars in the city will charge you over $7 for a beer like that.  We each ordered 3 of the same tacos: 1. Taco Al Pastor: marinated pork shoulder with pineapple, grilled onion, cilantro. This taco was very savory and the pineapple added subtle hints of sweetness. I thought it could have used some lettuce and more veggies for texture and cooling elements, but i'm no head chef, and i did enjoy what i was eating.  2. Taco De Panza: braised pork belly, tomato, queso fresco, onion, and cilantro. Probably my least favorite of the three. I thought the crumbled queso fresco was kinda ""meh"", it added more to the texture than taste.  3. Taco De Pescado: MUH FAVORITE! I wish i ordered more of these because it was soo delicious. Beer battered crispy tilapia, chipotle mayo, cabbage, cilantro,  and a lime on the side. This was the most composed in terms of taste and texture, and the chipotle mayo tied everything together to make this one hell of a flavorful taco. The fish was not greasy, but firm and crisp. It got better the more I ate it.  The food was good, but i wished it had more in terms of variety. there were a total of 4 tacos and no side dishes of beans or rice. The service was all right, and I'm a sucker for service. Our waitress was a bit blasé and didn't check up on us to see how everything was. I understand that it can get busy, but a ""hey, everything good here?"" would have been more than enough.  I realize that this place is not what i was looking for, which was a full on restaurant.

I know that al Pastor marinade usually contains some pineapple or juice but I wasn't a fan of all the pineapple chunks. The Tilapia was really bland. I feel like the sauce needed something.

We opted for the to go option where you can still sit on the other side of the restaurant but you just can't get alcohol, which was fine with me since I didn't come to get my drink on, even though people who were getting their drink on seemed to be having a might good time with all those tequila shots we saw.

I was really surprised because I wasn't expecting it to. It was tangy and limey and absolutely flavorful and delicious and for $8.00 I thought it was a generous serving and the chips were crispy and super fresh which made it even better.

2012-07-17,5.0,LOVED this place.  I felt like I was somewhere not-Chicago.  I went with my girlfriend on a Thursday night and it was packed!  We seated ourselves at the bar and had 8 tacos between the two of us (it was a lot of food).  The drinks were great too.  My only regret is that I drove there!  This is not a first date sort of place--it's noisy and crowded.  It's meant for friends and people who will enjoy the hullabaloo. We also had a cute bartender taking care of us.  Hehe.,0.9662,0.715,0.238,0.047,0.7305555555555555

But I pretty much expected it, so my boyfriend and I decided to get tacos to go. His chicken taco was all dark meat and the creme was curdled. The whole taco smelled rancid. We didn't want to be ""those people"" and the place was mobbed so we just bailed.  My second visit I had my fingers crossed that was a fluke. This time my friends and I also decided to grab tacos to go. The Frijoles Charros tasted like baked beans from a can. And the two tiny flour tortillas weren't even enough for the money I paid.  In short, this place is overpriced and overrated. You won't catch me at Big Star again.

2012-07-16,5.0,"Yes I like this place. It does things differently - no credit cards, just cash - tax is included in the prices - food is super authentic, even though this place is really a bar we tried all the little tacos and I think the way they made them was incredible. Great mix of tastes and textures. My faves were the pork belly, the tilapia and the potato. the soup was super bean-y and flavorful too and the hot dog was pretty big, a meal in itself. The menu is limited, so it's recommended that you try everything. Dinner for 3 came to $31 and we had a margarita as well. The margarita was small and saddened me a little, but it was strong and well made. I would recommend that you go in the week, since this place packs up on the weekends. Decor is nice inside the bar area- lots of wood, seating available around the bar and booths that sit upto 6-7 people. Outside was a little more patio-like furniture, and it's great to sit out there in the evening on warm summer nights.",0.9845,0.78,0.194,0.026,0.570887445887446

This is no fault of their own - I think other businesses should invest more in decor - this is what gives Big Star the competitive advantage. The second star comes from the attitude - they weren't total jerks, but that was a bit of an arrogant vibe from those employed by Big Star.

Also when we sat down we were greeted by a VERY intoxicated gentleman ( i use this term loosely ) He was so intoxicated  that he couldn't get his food in his mouth it was revolting. He was eating and all the food was falling on him and on the floor...there was a bartender with a grey tank top...side braid....that looked grossed out by him but didn't pressure his friends to get his guy out of here. At one point I was a bit scared because he he kept staring at my girlfriend and i....weirdo....Finally after about 25 minutes and the creeped out looks from everyone surrounding this guy they left. BACK to us just sitting at the bar when we walked in. the girl with the side braid had us sitting there for about ten minutes without a glance our direction which was a surprise to me because of the drunk show happening next to us....when she finally served us it just felt like a bother...after two beers and being the annoying people of trying to flag her down I was ready to give up. Until I caught eyes with Casey and he came right up and was ready to take our order. The bar was busy but he GOT IT DONE with great calmness and ease. I didn't feel like I was I was bothering him....

2012-06-26,1.0,"A few questions I have for Big Star: 1) Why is your service so confusing? My three friends and I were waited upon by three different waiters and waitresses. None of these people were wearing a uniform, t-shirt, or any other sort of paraphernalia that distinguished them as employees of this fine establishment. During my time there, I saw each of these three people hanging out at other tables, chatting, drinking, and just looking like they were patrons themselves. So imagine my confusion when these people came up and asked if we needed anything. At first I thought we were getting hit on or propositioned somehow. 2) Why is your service so slow? We were sitting at our table for at least a good 20 minutes before we were offered drinks. And then another staff came and asked us if we wanted drinks again, didn't ask if we wanted food, and then walked away without taking our order. We waited another ten minutes before our order for food was taken. We ordered three tacos and one entree, which should not have taken what felt like 30 minutes to come out, which leads to my next question... 3) Why would you put three different orders on ONE plate? Are you trying to save your dishwasher some work or something? One of the waitresses put the plate down, hastily explained which taco was what, and walked away. Nobody but me heard what she said, due to the high noise level in the restaurant, and my friends and I spent the next couple minutes trying to figure out whose food was whose.

My wife doesn't like mayo.  Probably because it's made of eggs and vinegar, or because of the caloric content, I dunno.  This may seem out of place now, but you'll see why this makes sense later. Finally got to eat here while sober.  Came after a disappointing dinner at Acadia.  Had previously eaten here drunk, and the tacos were amazing.  Had the pork and the pork then, of course, and tasted my wife's fish, but she got it with no onions, no slaw, no mayo. When my EtOH level is up, my threshold for non-pork items is lowered.  But I seem to recall not liking the pork belly as much as the shoulder, and I did want to try the fish.....so last night I got 1 fish no mayo for my wife, 1 fish and 1 pork shoulder for me. The fish taco?  Holy shit.  The chipotle mayo lifts the taco to a whole new level than i had previously tasted before, with a slight smoky spiciness along with the mellow bite of red onion, it was 200% better this time around.  And the pork shoulder hits it as usual, salty and sweet, I like to top it off with a squeeze of lime and the red sauce for extra Bruce Lee kick.   Love the salsas.  Properly roasted peppers give it that charred smoky taste without overpwering the rest of the flavors.  And the chips?  Similar to Chipotle with the lime, but not as salty and freshly made, they were served warm and went great with everything else.

2012-06-14,3.0,"After one failed attempt on a Saturday afternoon 2 weeks ago (there was a 2-hour wait), a friend and I tried yet again on another Saturday afternoon last weekend.  There was a table available if we didn't mind sitting in the sun.  Of course not!!!!!  That patio is one of the better ones in Chicago, I'd burn to a crisp in the sun for a seat any day!  (just bring sunscreen) A pitcher of Big Star 'ritas and some guacamole started this adventure off on a good note.  If you like margaritas, go with the Big Star - there is a hint of smokiness in the aftertaste.  Guacamole was pretty good.  I've had better, but I do like the bite of the radishes in there.  Chips... amazing.   Then came the tacos - one fish, one pork, one pork belly.  Absolutely delicious.  I heard they used to be $2 a piece which seems more reasonable to me given their size.  However, $3 is worth the flavorful goodness that each taco provides. ***WARNING: be prepared - they are cash only.  Bring cash!  Lots of it just in case you decide to stay for 7 hours eating tacos and drinking 'ritas.  It can happen.  It happened to me.***   At this point you must be wondering ""why only 3 stars?""  This is where they lost the two stars that the food, drinks, patio atmosphere, prime people-watching location, etc would have warranted... The service.  It's God awful.  And I wish I were exaggerating, but unfortunately I'm not.  Let me make my few points to explain why: 1.  Sat down and got water immediately, which was key because it was damn near 90 degrees and we were directly under the sun.  THEN we proceeded to wait between 5-10 minutes for someone to even walk by.  A food runner passed by quickly dropping some guac at our table (mind you, we have not ordered yet as there has been no server to even greet us).  She ran away before we could even tell her it wasn't ours.   2.  Server finally came.  We explain about the guac, which she immediately grabs and walks away.  How about ""let me take your drink order at least so I can grab those for you on my way back in?""  Nope.  She was out.   3.  15 minutes have now passed since we sat down.  Server is back and we proceed to order guac and a pitcher.  2 minutes later, two single margaritas are dropped at our table.  Again, runner speeds away before we can explain they are NOT ours because we are waiting on a pitcher.  I proceed to grab the next employee who walks by to explain the situation.   4.  When we were ready for tacos, we literally had to flag our server down just to place an order.  You would think - the bigger our tab, the bigger her tip... why wouldn't she want to take our order??? 5.  We didn't see our server again until she came by, this time wanting to be friendly and chatty, only to end the conversation by telling us her shift ended in a few minutes to she needed to close up with us.  Fine by me.  We decide to wait until the new (hopefully more attentive) server comes to order more drinks. 6.  New server floats around the patio and doesn't even LOOK at our table.  Finally we have to stop her as she's walking by for maybe the 10th time to tell her we want to order.  Every time we need something after that, WE have to make the effort to get her to come to our table. Bottom line, it shouldn't be THAT much work to give a restaurant your business.  Those servers should be checking in on their tables with the obligatory ""is everything ok over here?"" or ""can I get you anything else?""  Not at Big Star apparently.  The customers have to do the work in order to get service at all.  What's with the feeling of entitlement?  As if I should feel honored to be dining there or something.  That's no bueno.   Of course, I will be back because the food and margaritas are THAT good.  I can disregard the intolerable lack of service which is a piss-poor effort at best, because depriving myself of the deliciousness they provide is not a life I want to live.   Maybe some day I will go back and have incredible service and my mind will be changed.  But as a first experience, they're lucky they won me over with the food.  I know people who would never go back, regardless of how good the food was, simply based on the sole fact that the service was lacking (and that's a total understatement).   All negatives aside... GO GET SOME TACOS!!!!  Don't base your decision on whether or not to go because I had ONE bad service experience.  Granted it was 7 hours of terrible service, but hey.  Maybe it was just a bad day for both servers we had.  The tacos are good, the drinks are strong & tasty which is a perfect combination in my book, and the patio is to die for.",0.9945,0.819,0.118,0.063,0.5029701779701781

Instead, you have to wait 20 minutes to get served at the bar, and then desperately try to flag the bartender down when you're ready for another.

Once you're inside prepare to wait another 2+ hours for a table. Just to go the bar and be quick when people leave. Their food is whatever but their drinks are never disappointing.  Highly recommend the big star & classic margarita. And for the best $7 buzz get the los tres reyes (shot of tequila, shot of sangrita, and a can of beer). Want good tacos? I would recommend going to your local Mexican restaurant for cheaper and tastier tacos. But if you're stuck at Big Star... get their fish tacos. They have the best flavor and very tender. taco al pastor - the grilled pineapples are too sweet and kills the taste of the taco taco de panza - if you like your tacos to have the texture of beer jerky then this is the perfect taco for you The guacamole is good but its expensive for the amount you get.

We then proceeded to eat right next door where they sell tacos out of another little stand that only accepts cash and ran out of coke (pop) not the drug people, by like 9pm.

We threw everything in a bag and brought it to her little window and all she did was look inside. Didn't move things around, shake the bag a little, nope, just peaked inside and then gave us the rest of our order. I couldn't wait to try it because the food smelled so delicious. What a disappointment!!! $3 for one taco which was like a mini taco, the flavor wasn't good at all and the tortilla was so wet it was mushy and falling apart. We barely ate our food and threw away about $25 of it. We decided to finally go next door because there wasn't a line and thought well lets have a margarita and then leave. Omgoodness, the margarita was equally disgusting. The margarita mix was a weird greenish/yellow color and tasted like a dirty dish towel and the tequila they used tasted like it came from a cheap plastic bottle.

I tried a chicken taco, though it was alright, it was not the best taco I've ever tasted. I've definitely tasted better chicken tacos. Basically, any authentic Mexican restaurant can make a better taco. It definitely wasn't a bad taco, but just didn't live up to the hype. My friends agreed.  The chips and guacamole though were amazing! I have had my fair share of chips and guac and this was probably top ten favorite guacamole and the chips had something extra in them too to give them more of a zest. Next time, I'll probably just eat the chips and guac, skip the taco. Our waitress, and all the servers, were not personable, or even seemed like they cared to try to make an impress. They weren't mean, but usually servers at least try to make you feel like your business is important. Ours did not. They also seemed annoyed by our presence. In their defense, it was a really hot day, the place seemed really busy, and they probably had been working all day. So I can't fault them too much for just not caring to put on the server show I'm used to, but it would have been nice. The prices are great. You can get so much for ten dollars.

Big Star has done it, the only downside is that my chances of ever getting in without waiting 2 hours are slim to none.  The tacos are REALLY good. I tried most of them, other than the pork ones, and they were all really good. Most of them are on the spicy side, so be ready for a kick and have a drink available nearby in case you need it. They also have really good margaritas and a pretty extensive beer menu. This is one of the only bars I've been to in the city that has Gumball Head beer in stock, so if you're looking for that, this is the place to go. Their bar also has some bourbons that are not widely available at bars in the city. The service is good, the atmosphere was fun and festive, and the outdoor seating is pretty big and looked very sunny. However, the wait for an outside table was quoted to us at 2 hours. We were sitting inside waiting for an outdoor table for 5 hours and our name was never called, because I guess nobody was leaving. So if it's a nice day out and you can't get there really early, don't expect to get a table outside. Oh well- I guess I'll keep trying.",0.9965,0.765,0.22,0.015,0.4677579365079366

2012-05-19,4.0,"With over 1100 reviews I'm not sure what I can add, other than the over-hyped fish tacos are just that: over-hyped.  But everything else was excellent. I went here with a couple friends before a show at the Double Door on a rainy Saturday evening (about 7:30) and even with the cold dreary weather we had to wait about 20 minutes in line to get a table.  They did move the line from the sidewalk over up against the building when the rain picked up which was nice of them. After getting a table be prepared to wait a few minutes for the drink order, and even longer for a food order.  So don't go here when in a hurry. So back to the fish tacos; one friend was calling these the best they've ever had, but is just a setup for disappointment if you ask me. I opted for 1 one each meat taco they had on the menu, and we shared some chips and guacamole.  So that's the fish, pork belly, pork shoulder, and (for $1 extra) chicken. The chips were excellent as they had somehow been seemingly infused with lime, it seemed like more than just a lime spritz on the chips as there was a definite hit of lime in every bite.  I make homemade guacamole all the time and I wish I could get even halfway to their result, it was as if the most perfectly creamy avocados in the world where sacrificed for this appetizer. Since we all ordered a bunch of tacos it was interesting that they just bring them on shared plates, so make sure you remember what you order since you'll have to do the match between friends.  Oh yeah, there were a couple decent draft beers incluing $3 for a pint of Stone Pale Ale.  Unfortunately that evening they were out of the draft IPA, as well as the Sonoran Hot Dog (a bacon-wrapped all beef hot dog on a roll) which one of my friends was talking about for the previous 3 hours. I started with the fish taco (Pescado) and yes it was good, but nothing worth raving about.  (Personally I think Carbon in Near South has better encrusted tilapia tacos, their sauce is better as well.)  I then moved on to the pork shoulder taco (Pastor) which I liked better than the fish, great flavor on the pork and I loved the pineapple and pickled red onions. Moving on to the pork belly taco (Panza) this meat was even better than the last.  And (unknowingly) saving the best for last the chicken (Pollo) was great.  The menu says 'marinated chicken' but no mention of the smoky bite from the perfect balance of chipotle adobo sauce it was apparently marinated in. My hands-down favorite. The bill was a bit on the heavy side but we all were famished by the time we got there so we probably went overboard a bit, but if you reign yourself in to 3 tacos and a beer the cost is actually not bad at all.",0.9986,0.764,0.203,0.033,0.5554308390022675

2012-05-14,4.0,"Big Star: well let's start off with food. These are NOT your average chicken and steak tacos, Big Star is a specialty restaurant. They have a variety of pork tacos, an amazing talapia taco, and the awesome potato taco (one of my fave!!). If you're not a pork eater they do have a chicken taco w/ savory juices and cilantro, cheese. YUM!! My all time fave dish is the Queso de Fundido, basically a hot small skillet comes to your table w/ melting bubbling cheese and on the inside you find bell peppers, bits of bacon and onion, served w/ 4 fresh tortilla's on the side. I can eat at least 2 of them by myself! Now as I said earlier, Big Star is not a typical Mexican place, they have a few rules so if you're the rebel kind then this is not the spot for you. There are absolutely NO SUBSTITUTIONS on food orders, so if you don't like something, oh well. Also, it's a cash only place and the plus is that they don't charge tax!! Hmm, think I'm forgetting one more rule...oh yeah, get their EARLY!! Doors open @ 11:30am, I suggest getting their by 10am, the place gets beyond pack and if you don't like noisy places then go for takeout, music will be blasting and you have to literally yell to order your food. Last thing, you can't just order a single taco at a time. Orders must be in groups, for example if you and a friend are going order your tacos together.

HOWEVER, we went back last month and brought some friends, and I can't remember a time I was treated more rudely by a hostess. She was busy flirting with a cheesy-looking fake-tanned Fabio type in cowboy boots and could not be bothered to even respond to me or my friend, who is one of the nicest people you could meet. We finally assumed she wasn't the hostess because she completely ignored us. Wrong! I leaned over, thinking she possibly wasn't hearing us, and asked, Are you the hostess? because I saw her pick up the wait list. She glared at both of us and said, I'm helping someone else. So we waited while she flirted with urban cowboy for a couple more minutes and then were ""helped"" by her. There was no line at this point because we had made a point to get there before the dinner rush. We were nothing but polite to her, and she was so rude that we almost left and went elsewhere.

I've been in Chicago for 22 years now and I'm still in search of Mexican food like I found on a regular basis down South. I thought my search would be over after eating at Big Star, based on rave reviews from friends. I was wrong.  First off, the service is horrible. Our server was so disaffected she might actually have been nodding off from recently shooting up. (I rarely leave less than a 20% tip, just because I know what it's like to wait tables for a living, but here it was a solid 15%.) I felt like it was an imposition for us to be served, and the other staff we encountered tended to be a mixed bag (ranging from stoner-spacey to fabulous).  As for the food: remember that Barbra Mandrell song -- ""I was country when country wasn't cool"" -- that was out in the early 80s? Yeah. Well, I feel similarly about all these hipster eateries. Besides really missing the live-band karaoke at the Pontiac, Big Star seems to be part of this trend of pseudo-foodies who like to bring their brand of pretension to the masses. The tacos I had were okay, but the chips were half-fresh, half-chewy/stale. The ""gourmet"" salsas were reasonably tasty but lacked any sort of bite. If the flavored had been used with a little more heat, I might have liked them better. And the limeade was almost disgustingly sugar-laden and NOT Mexican-style in the least (see Garcia's in Lincoln Square for a good approximation of Mexican limeade).  My dad still lives in Texas, where he bottles his own salsas and enjoys a healthy relationship with local Mexican restaurants. He's coming up here to visit soon, and I'd thought about taking him here but after eating the food myself I'd be embarrassed to do so.  Nutshell: good if you like hipster ideas of what constitutes quality food (which, I admit, many people do); bad if you grew up eating genuine Mexican food and are looking for something of the nostalgic sort.",0.9803,0.803,0.138,0.059,0.42398758648758655

Guacamole: Guac is good and seasoned well. No overly salty mess of avocado here. I do wish it was a bit spicier, but spiciness is a fine line that I can understand. Some chips can be soggy while others can be perfectly crisp. Tacos de Panza: Good flavor and a generous heaping of both meat and queso fresco which goes a long way. The crispy pork belly can be a bit overcooked, however.  Tacos de Pescado: The single piece of beer battered tilapia is large and remains pretty moist. Nice spicy kick from the chipotle mayo that I definitely noticed and appreciated. One of the better fish tacos out there. Horchata: Not too sweet which is a plus! And definitely can taste that cinnamon-ey goodness.  Overall, I was pretty full after the two tacos and my half of the guac.

2012-04-02,2.0,"the only reason to go to big star is to get a quick and small snack while having a drink.  they do not have a full bar; they only serve rum, and a variety of tequilas, mezcals and whiskeys.  while their drinks and food are inventive and unique, they're definitely no bargain (except the tacos at $3 a pop).  the place stays alive because they've got a patio space in a prime location, and because they manufacture demand.  the staff is exceedingly unfriendly and i wouldn't be surprised if they're trained to be that way. i mean, i can forgive a terse and unsmiling bartender because they're overwhelmed by yuppie d-bags who are demanding jaegerbombs that aren't even on the menu.  of course, they might not be so overwhelmed if the hostess would seat people in the inner patio and not force them to stand around the bar where there aren't any available seats.  this requires explaining: two of us showed up at around 11pm on a sunday night to find a packed bar and a virtually empty patio section.  the hostess told us she'd take our name down for a table and come find us in the bar area when something came available.  when i asked we could take one of the (six, or so) empty tables on the patio she said:  ""i'm not ready to seat the patio yet.""  i looked around, puzzled, and noticed two separate empty booths inside.  ""can we have one of the empty booths inside?"" ""those are reserved for parties of 4 or more."" ""that makes sense.  can we have one of these 2-tops on the patio?"" ""i'm not ready to seat the patio yet."" long story short: we went inside, saw no seating available, and decided to get take-out at the take-out window outside the entrance.  (the take out window itself is awesome and, now that i think about it, the only reason i even go to big star these days).   i guess the bottom line is this: hipster attitude comes with the territory if you decide to hang out in wicker park.  it just is what it is.  wicker park is a vibrant, dynamic, unique, and wonderful part of chicago that any tourist or local would deprive themselves to miss.  that said, there is a line one must often decide to cross if they want to partake in such... ""uniqueness.""  the irony here is that i actually have a rapport with one of big star's owners and i know him to be incredibly dedicated to his patron's satisfaction.  every single bartender, door man/woman, hostess and server that i've had to deal with here has been a total assh*** with very little exception.  i would say the only reason to go to big star is at a low-peak time (which is almost never).  but honestly, after my last visit, i really would rather go anywhere else in the neighborhood.    CASH ONLY.",0.8507,0.891,0.06,0.049,0.5106940395205702

It's located right in Wicker Park and is definitely a hipster hangout.  Yes the tacos were overpriced, but yes they were Very good. I tried the Taco de Panza (crispy, braised pork belly, tomato guajillo sauce, queso fresco, onion, cilantro) and the Tacos de Pescado (beer battered tilapia, chipotle mayo, cabbage, cilantro, lime) and both were soooo tasty. Fish tacos are hit or miss and at Big Star they are a Hit; I would highly recommend giving one a try. Anyplace that has Three Floyds Gumball Head on tap is solid in my book.

The staff are often times pretentious jagwheels as well. I've never had a bad experience with bartenders, but I've dealt with more than enough asshole bouncers and hosts (flatly refusing to give a ballpark wait time, etc). I laid down on one of the benches near the pickup window one afternoon while waiting for my order (there was nobody else there), and was reminded that this ""isn't the Holiday Inn."" The clientele are almost as bad. Go back to the suburbs, or hit up that stupid ""Barrio Taco"" near Diversey and Clark in the neighborhood you actually live in, Jesus. The tacos, though, despite being small and overpriced, are some of the greatest tacos I've ever had. The Panza (pork belly) is imported from Mars, I swear to god. I'm a marinated pork junkie, and I've never found anything like it. It's straight outta this world. Guac too, and the beans, and the chicken tosdadas.    So I'm torn, and I honestly feel like I'm giving these guys a harder time than they deserve. But it's a matter of principle, a taco should never be more than $2. Yet I give the place 4 stars. I'm just a hot mess of confusion right now.",0.4182,0.755,0.126,0.119,0.557997557997558

2012-03-25,4.0,"Just ate at Big Star and I was compelled to Yelp about it! My boyfriend and I had been wanting to dine here for a while but never made the effort of standing in the long lines especially since we are used to eating at amazing taquerias like Traspasada or Guanajuato but we finally made it in and I'm really glad we did. The best way to describe this ""taqueria"" and its food is modernized Mexican cuisine with authenticity.   The atmosphere is definitely busy. We arrived on a Sunday night around 7 pm and it was crowded but not crowded enough for me to get annoyed. It was a little confusing at first because the hostess wasn't readily there to put us on the list or let us know the availability. When we finally got a hold of her she didn't give us an exact time of when we'd be able to get a table but advised us that if we waited by the bar, we most likely would be able to find a seat within ten minutes and she was exactly right. We found seats by the bar and the gentleman took our order right away. He was friendly and provided our drinks quickly.  We ordered the following: Chips & Guacamole, Taco de Pescado, 2 Tacos al Pastor, 1 Taco de Panza, 1 Tostada de Pollo, 1 horchata, and 1 Michelada. The Michelada as stated by my boyfriend was just like a homemade Michelada. He loved it. The horchata could have been better; it was more watery than anything which I wasn't a huge fan of. The food was delicious. It would be too hard to explain why it is delicious; you have to just try it for yourself. I definitely recommend the chips and guacamole because it was the best I've ever had and I've had some really amazing guacamole before. I would recommend the pork belly tacos (Taco de Panza) and the chicken tostada for first timers but honestly everything else on the menu is worth trying at least once. Big Star offers flavorful, quality food with efficient and friendly service. I look forward to coming back to enjoy another tasty meal. For those expecting 100% authentic Mexican food, you may not find what you are looking for but I wouldn't judge a book by its cover. Try everything on the menu and I'm sure you will enjoy a variety of items.

2012-03-11,3.0,"10PM last Thursday at Big Star was packed like a boat headed for Ellis Island in 1940.  My girl and I visited since we were craving Mexican and I had wanted to check this place out for a long time after getting one of their recipes from Bon Appetit.  If you go in the later hours (after 9?), the environment should be understood before entry. It's lowed, pretty crammed, and a bit chaotic. I wasn't in the mood for this, but I didn't let that interfere with my dining experience. I'd have loved the atmosphere if I was a buzzed or with a group of buddies. The DJ was mixing it up and hipsters will in full swing.  Ultimately, I enjoyed the Al Pastor recipe I use more than what Big Star served up. I did love the Queso and their pickled vegetables. The queso was perfectly browned, had an almost nutty aroma, and was loaded with chorizo and poblano strips. I've had the style of pickled vegetables they serve before, these were hands down the hottest and best I've had. It would be great to by a giant jar's worth to keep on hand.  The tacos didn't hit the ball out of the park, more like a ground rule double. The tacos are a great size, about 3-4 bites. We had their Al Pastor, Pork Belly, and Fried Tilapia. The tilapia was good, I'm always of fan of the crunch you get from cabbage slaw and the crispy fried tilapia. Great with a squeeze of lime too. I didn't thing the Al Pastor was that great, not a lot of bold flavor or spice I expected. The pork belly was good, a tad dry, but some lime helped that too.  The Margarita we got was disgusting, basically all sour mix...It was really busy, so it's likely the bartender was just trying to get me my drink in a timely fashion. I'd have waited 10 minutes if that's what it took to get a well prepared drink. Too bad, I'll just stick with a cerveza next time.   Overall, Big Star left me feeling satisfied but not impressed. I do like whats all going on here, but I wish the tacos had more memorable flavor.

Their tacos are amazeballs.  I can never decide if I prefer the tacos al pastor or de panza because both are delicious.  Their guacamole is seriously amazing, but I recommend getting it to split between a bigger group because it's a little expensive. They also advertise their daily specials on Facebook, and they're usually awesome. Their micheladas and margaritas are delicious, and their bartenders are friendly and excellent at their job.  Food comes up quickly and it's always prepared perfectly.

2012-02-22,4.0,"I came on a Friday afternoon around 3pm.  Surprise. No wait time! That's kind of how it works.  Either come at a time when people should be at work or be prepared to wait.  Even at 3pm on a Friday Big Star was pretty busy, which speaks to its popularity.  Getting a booth was awesome, however people constantly opening the door to to the frigid Chicago weather outside was not.  I still have no idea why they kept going outside.  Also the service was great since it wasn't too busy. While this is a taco joint, I would first like to point out how awesome the daily $3 whiskey shot is.  Most taco places are all about tequila, but I love that Big Star also has a very large selection of whiskey - even bigger than their tequila selection.  This is almost enough to make me bump up my rating to 5 stars.  The beer selection is not as vast, but still pretty decent with more bottles than drafts.   Now the tacos. They are all so good.  I love pork belly, and the tacos de panza were awesome especially with the queso fresco on top.  I loved the arugula in the tostada de pollo and the pineapple in the taco al pastor.  The chips were nice and crunchy, and there are bottles of the house made salsas at the table.  So delicious and appropriately sized for $3.  They're small, so order at least a few per person.  I'm not the first to complain about cash only, but why does this have to be cash only?  Bank fees suck, yes, but carrying cash is becoming more and more rare.  Maybe it's because Big Star is located in a hipster area, and it must be so hip to eschew credit cards.  Maybe next time I'll try to write a check in protest.  I'll definitely be back for some whiskey and tacos, and I want the sonoran hot dog so bad.",0.9952,0.757,0.197,0.047,0.575843253968254
2012-02-21,4.0,"I'm a huge fan of this place, so I want to give it 5 stars but I will admit that they have their flaws.  The food is 5 stars. Easily, the best tacos I've ever had. The fish tacos are insanely good. I recently came back from China and came straight here for fish tacos when I got off the blue line. Somethings you just can't get in another country. The Queso Fundido is also a must have appetizer when you dine here. It is amazing. Fix of Chorizo, pablano peppers, and melted cheese on top on warm tortillas. It's a bit spicy, but it's a great starter. The margherita's are really strong, but really good. They make them with whiskey and offer a traditional style of big star style. Both are good, but have a heavy whiskey taste as opposed to margherita's you're probably used to elsewhere.  The only knocks that make me give Big Star 4 stars instead of 5 is the staff. The guys at the door, particularly the bald guy that checks ID's is pretty rude and has been a smart ass. Seems like he has an attitude of entitlement and last time when I asked if we can sit at the bar, he responded with ""you can do whatever you want."" Um thanks buddy. To echo the past reviews, it does get crowded but the new addition of the snow globe outdoor patio has helped this a lot and I have not had a problem finding a seat as of late.

2012-02-10,3.0,"This place has many different personalities; some aspects were good, bad, and annoying all at the same time.  I guess I can sympathize with all. My long-time newer-to-the-city college friend and her husband chose this place for drinks and catching up this past Thursday.  She suggested 6PM and, based on the reviews, I was ready to get my Mama Cub on and tackle anyone to get a table.  To my surprise, though Big Star was busy, the super friendly door girl took our name, our phone number, invited us to the bar, and said she would call when a table came up.  Sure enough, 5 minutes and 3 sips into our Gumballhead later, the call came and the table was ready.  Non-fail! Within 20 seconds of being seated our cheery to the max waitress came up and asked if we needed drinks and planned to order food.  We told her we were fine for now and informed her that our friend was still coming and we would get food when he came.  Our waitress must have read Yelp reviews regarding slow service because she was persistent in making sure that she checked if we were ready to order EVERY 2 MINUTES!!!  Waitress: ""Can I get you guys started with some appetizers or food?"" Us: ""No, we're waiting for our friend.""   Waitress:  ""Have you guys decided on anything yet?"" Us:  ""No, we're still looking at the menu.""   Waitress:  ""Do you guys need another beer?"" Us:  ""No, we still have almost a full beer left.""   Waitress:  ""Are you guys ready to order?"" Us:  ""No, our friend is still on his way.""   Waitress:  ""Do you have any questions about the menu?!"" Us:  ""Sorry, we have't had a chance to look at the menu yet (because YOU keep coming over and interrupting us!)"" Maybe I was annoyed because I just got back from Southeast Asia where time is not of the essence and you can dine in peace, but I was even more annoyed because I had to listen to my friend tell stories in shifts. Once our friend arrived, we placed our food order and another round of drinks.  We ordered chips (+salsa out of squeeze tubes on the table) and I settled on the Taco de Panza and Taco de Papas con Rajas.  These tortilla-wrapped bites of flavorful wonder came out in roughly 5 minutes.  Delicious, seasoned perfectly, and just enough sauce to not be messy.  I would recommend at least 3-4 to qualify as a full meal because they aren't very large.  They were better than most that I've had, but the jury is still out on whether these are the best, as so many claim.  4 for the food.   The meal was super cheap - roughly $35 with tip.  I was a bit turned off by the whole cash only thing.  Seriously... a restaurant this busy will more than make up for the teensy tiny fee that credit card companies charge.  The ATM on site charges a $3 transaction fee, equal to the cost of a delicious Taco de Papas con Rajas taco.  I would have rather had the third taco.  PNC and Chase are within walking distance. The reviews for Big Star are as diverse as this melting pot we call ""America"",  and it seems like the day, the server, the weather and the position of the moon in the sky will have an effect on your visit to the restaurant.  My words of advice are to arrive early, in small groups, with cash on hand, prepared to eat quickly and be on your way.",0.9975,0.831,0.147,0.021,0.5146097883597883

Always looking for the next best meal to satisfy my love for good food.  One night, my boyfriend and I got the munchies and decided to go try something new. Thanks to some help from foursquare, we found Big Star. We pass by this place a couple of time, but only thought it was a bar. We came there around 12am, they asked for our ID, so I'm guessing you have to be 21 to be in the bar that late. If you're underage, you kinda out of luck but they do have a walk-up window to order out. Their menu selection is very limited, only have a about 10+ items. But since this is mainly a bar, they have a wide ranch of wine, beer, and other liquors like whiskey for a very reasonable price. Since it was our first time there and they didn't have that much to choose from, we just order all five of the tacos on the menu because they were all around $3-$4!!!. We wanted to try and see which one we would like better to know for future reference. We shared them all, and to our surprise they were delicious. We even order seconds! One on my favorite was the fish tacos, light and crunchy. My boyfriend love meat, and they had plenty of that for him. Each tacos was filled for a good amount of meat with their special toppings. His favorite is the crispy pork belly. Another good dish on the menu is the tostada de pollo, shredded chicken on crispy tostada, YUMMY!!! I would recommend this place to all my friends and clients.

In the summer, this is the best spot to post up and make fun of hipsters riding fixies. Big Star is a real staple if you are drinking and taking people out and around wicker park. The pick-up window is key for these excursions, but if you can, get in and sit down because the menu doubles. Meaning there are now 13 items to choose from. Of these I highly recommend:  Tamales Verzcruz: This is a seasonal item that is not always available, but it is now, so come in and get it, it is sublime.  Sonoran hot dog - bolillo roll, big star hot sauce, pinto beans, lime mayo, yes. Please. Thank you. The server was all, ""Its pretty substantial!."" I then pulled up my shirt and shoved my thumb in my bellybutton and exclaimed, ""So is this, lady!"" This item is a real treat and they wrap it in bacon in case you have second thoughts.  Tacos al pastor - Must get, with the pineapple it plays wonderfully.  Tostada de pollo - cilantro pesto, queso crema, another must get, this is a staple.  Drinks: La paloma - This is freaking awesome, and it is pinkish in color so you know it is super manly. They hide the tequila well. But I do not.  Classic margarita - Nice and smooth. Tons of sea salt on the rim.  Michelada - Mexican cerveza preparada made with beer, lime juice, tomato juice (or Clamato) and hot sauce, get this if you have no fear and want to get properly toasted.  Everything I recommend above minus the Michelada and tip is $38. You can't beat that. After eating and drinking many tequila drinks that have made me forget the horrors of the week, I take my daughters hand and saunter over to wicker park, where I can bask in the unseasonably warm sun and enjoy a few fleeting moments of uninterrupted half sleep time while I allow the juices to marinate in my belly. This place truly is an embodiement of wicker park, supplying the bad and the good, while still allowing you to feel like you're doing something when just lazily lying in a sunbeam after stuffing your face with pork and liquor on a Friday.

2012-01-23,2.0,"The reason I hesitated to go here in the past is because I've tried and failed so many times to get in.  And I think that's pretty fucking stupid for a taco place.  I was there the first week they opened and got smashed between the back wall and 500 sweaty dipshits for about half an hour, until I finally gave up on getting a beer or a taco or even a water.  After that, I walked by with friends about a million times, put my name on the list, and then immediately took it back off after they told us it would be AT LEAST a 17 hour wait.  Sorry, but I just don't think any taco experience is worth a long wait.  I'll go sit on my stoop and have a can of beer and a trailer park style taco I whipped together myself while the rest of you jackasses wait in that line for some gourmet pig butt. Anyway.  So I have no say in the venue for a particular event last week.  I walk in during a snowstorm and I'm bundled and peeking around to see if my party is there yet, and this guy in a super-tight shirt comes up to me and says something.  I say ""hold on"" so I can get my gloves off, pull my hood down and take my hat off so I can hear what he's saying to me.  He does this little huffity huff thing like he's fucking busy trying to online shop for giant star pendants on his smartphone and I've interrupted him.  Meanwhile, as I struggle with my winter accoutrements, the rest of my group comes shoving in the door behind me.  So StarFairy repeats, ""ID'S!!!"" and eyes me like, ""See, bitch?  I am the gate keeper.""  So I dig for my ID and hand it over and he glances and walks away.  I hope he got a good deal on some man jewelry. We approach the pixie in the Zooey Deschanel Halloween costume because she has a clipboard, not because she's like, you know, making eye contact with us or letting us know in any way whatsoever that she's responsible for the seating.  We tell her we need seating for at least 6 people, the rest of us can stand if that's OK.  Well guess what?  That's actually not okay.  There can be no standing.  There can be absolutely NO ONE blocking the aisles.  I have to keep the aisles clear.  Do you understand?  Do you understand that the aisle has to be clear?  Okay.  As long as you understand that.  If you want to stand, stand in the back.  Not around the tables or around the bar.  You will have to STAY in the back.  There will be NO standing around allowed in the front of the restaurant. You have now entered the 1940's Berlin of overhyped taco joints.  We will henceforth refer to this place as ""Der Tacoplatz."" So after reading us the rules of the joint, Frau Doorlein just stands there, looking around, making marks on her little sheet.  ""So..."" we say, ""when can we sit down?"" ""Oh, I have a table ready now, but you can't have it until at least 4 people are here.""  We look around nervously at each other. ""Well,"" someone says, ""there are five of us here now?""  That's when Frau Doorlein SUDDENLY realized that there is a crowd of people in front of her.  ""Oh, I didn't know you were together!  Well, I can seat you now, but you can't stand in the aisles, okay?  Are we clear on that?  No standing in the aisles.  If more people come you have to tell them that.  They have to keep the aisle clear.""  Okay.  We fucking get it.  Give us a goddamn table. So we get a table in the back and we make sure not to stand.  Our waitress was fast, and efficient, but we encountered the same Reich Bar policies with her when we placed orders and she tried to collect all of our menus.  ""Can I hold on to this?"" someone asked about ONE menu (which is a small one-paged double-sided thing).  ""Um, no, actually?"" she says.  ""If you want one, it will be over here and you can come and get it.  It's 'cause the tables are so small."" We realized that in order to get another menu to order more food, we'd have to get up and STAND IN THE AISLE to reach them.  We had to set up a covert mission to do this when we wanted more tacos because we didn't want to get shot.  Eventually, our food came, and one person got his order on a plate by itself, and all the rest of us were served our food on a single plate--which meant we had to figure out what the hell everything was and everyone handled everyone else's food and my germ phobia went zipping off the charts and when I finally got my pork belly taco I was ready to leave.  This was in part because of the Storm Trooper staff and the strict regulations in part because of the giant crowd of Lincoln Park shit sacks standing in the aisles around us talking about beer and football and saying stuff was ""totally boss"" and shit. Oh, the food?  It was okay.  IF YOU LIKE THE TASTE OF FASCISM.",-0.8271,0.83,0.084,0.086,0.4819727891156463

If you don't know and try to hand over a credit card, a bartender will give you a hard stare and inform you.   - The pricing on drinks seemed arbitrary. One bartender charged us one price for a shot, another charged us $2 more for the same shot.   - The barkeeps are undoubtedly hopping, as there are a ton of people around the bar because seating is so limited. But as others have noted, they're also curt and short and I don't like that. Bad thing, because it doesn't encourage me to tip, which sucks for the barkeep and also for me, because then I don't get any service at all.   - I echo another reviewer's comment about the margarita.

The guacamole was good but I prefer my own version. It had plenty of lime but needed more chile pepper to round out the flavor and give the heat that was lacking. I went with 3 tacos: the potato, pork belly, and the al pastor. I actually didn't care for the al pastor taco. The pork was rubbery, tough and chewy which isn't anything like what you should be served. A bit of a disappointment. The potato and pork belly tacos on the other hand were very good.

I am currently 20 years old only days away from my 21st, though I understand and respect the law and respect restaurants whom uphold the law. When the doorman asked me for my ID, I did just that, gave him my ID, with no expectation that I was pulling a fast one over on anyone. Shortly after entering, the doorman physically grabbed my arm and pulled me aside to make sure I knew he was watching me. He told me that I would be on the honor system, whatever that meant. Regardless I had no intention of drinking or trying to cause trouble. After this he informed both the waitress and the house manager that I was underage and after they all rudely pointed and starred at me for over a minute, the waitress came to take our order. As she took drink orders, she skipped over me without asking if I would like a non-alcoholic drink. (The nice bus boy brought me over an horchata which happened to be delicious). For the rest of the night, the house manager if she wasn't pacing by our table to make sure I didn't have a drink in my hand, was standing in the corning watching over me like a hawk.

They need to rework the seating though.. Their main area is outdoors which sucks when it's getting into these colder months, that also means that they'll eventually close it (in case you didn't follow, that means the seating capacity drastically dropped) To put it simply, expect a wait. They do have a to-go window. Also, this place is cash only which sucks b/c I hate carrying cash.

This said, Big Star? Not at all overhyped. Amazing, even.  When you head in to Big Star-- even if the line isn't out the door-- be prepared to wait. Wait for a table, wait on the slow bartenders, and, sometimes, wait for the poor, overworked wait staff to notice you. But chill. Peruse the awesome whiskey and bourbon list (and, boy, do they mix them drinks strong!), figure out how much delicious Mexican food you can conceivably shove in your face, listen to some solid vinyl, and double-check to make sure you didn't drop all your cash at Flat Iron or Debonair, you hipster. Everything on the Kahan-compiled menu is good. Really, really good. The pork belly tacos get a ton of love-- as any bacony, delicious pork products should-- but I'm partial to their perfect al pastor. Deliciously barbecued 'n marinated lean chunks of pork interspersed with soft grilled pineapple and melt-in-your-mouth roasted onions. Topped with a little cilantro, this is my dream taco. And I'm usually a stickler for authentic Mexican tacos. Big Star also serves one of the finest California-style fish tacos in the city. Crispy-battered and topped with a chipotle sauce-- so good. If you still have room with all them tacos, order their citrusy guacamole and queso fundido.

The bus boy finally filled my water but not once was I asked if I wanted a refill on my coke.  For $3 for fountain coke, yes I want a refill; seeing as how it's about a 10oz glass with giant ice cubes that make it 8oz.  After our tacos came out we were finishing up the last bites our plates were pulled immediately from us.  I know they clean up quickly but really, you need to wait in front of me to pull the plate away immediately!  When we were finished we had to wait at least 20 minutes for a bartender to make eye contact so we could get our bill.  When we finally got her attention we asked for a to-go bag for our remaining guac and chips and she seemed like we asked for everything for free. Not sure why we had to wait on the bill seeing as how they yanked the plates so quickly, I thought we were being rushed out?  Needless to say, I'm in the service industry and would never treat the people who pay my bills in this manner.   Two stars solely based on nice hostess and decent food.  The rest was awful this time.",0.9358,0.849,0.098,0.053,0.6645593869731801

All of the tacos are delicious. My favorite is definitely the pork belly; perfectly seasoned pork roasted crisp, sauced simply, and topped with queso fresco. However, the fish (lightly battered and fried tilapia with cabbage and chipotle mayo) and al pastor (sumptuous grilled pork/lamb with pineapple salsa) are also spectacular, and all go well with both of the restaurant's homemade salsas. The guacamole and tostadas (pig feet tostada currently on special is the BOMB) are excellent augmentations to the tacos.. Drinking here is always awesome - Big Star has been partially responsible for many of my best nights out/embarrassing stories. Micheladas (tecates with salted rim and salsa) are divisive, but more often than not I find them delicious. Furthermore, it is impossible to argue with $3 shots of whiskey, all day, err day.  Outdoor seating and seating-independent taco stand are also huge pluses, although during the 8 months out of the year when the weather stinks neither is a huge perk. In summation: I love to make fun of Big Star for its hipster vibe as much as the next guy, but it's definitely unique, and is one of my favorite places in Chicago.

For my first time, I opted to go traditional: two tacos de pescado (fish), and two tacos de panza (pork belly).  They arrived piping hot only a few minutes after I ordered, served on top of deli wrap and a plastic plate.  Simple.  And the tacos?  Absolutely delicious.  Freshly-made, heaped with the protein and a matching ""slaw.""  The pork belly was salty and balanced with queso fresco and a little fresh lime juice; the beer battered tilapia was moist on the inside and crispy on the outside, served with a chipotle mayo, cilantro, and cabbage.  A really nice balance of spice (not heat, but spice) and sweet/tangy. The two bartenders who were serving me were attentive but not all over me; the bar itself was filled with mostly casual-looking people, either grabbing a quick bite after leaving work early or meeting up with friends for a late afternoon snack.  A nice vibe.  And they were playing records on a real record player--very conducive to the hipster ambiance.

2011-10-10,4.0,"Beer, bourbon, and tacos.  What could be more American than that? Well, OK, the more churlish among us may object to tacos, but still, it is a trilogy upon which all Americans should be able to agree and rally around. So it isn't isn't surprising that even on a weekday evening in October, the bar and patio at Big Star are packed.  I'm sure the gorgeous late summer weather helps, but I can't imagine trying to eat here when the patio is not available.  Despite the crowd, on our way to the bar Lady Luck shone down and provided us with a table.  Which was a good thing, because the bar was packed and there would be nowhere for me to rest my weary bones. Even though they were slammed, our waitress showed up quite quickly and, being ravenous, we ordered food and drinks in one fell swoop -- chips and guac, three fish tacos and a margarita for Kelly, two al pastor, one pork belly taco, and a Shiner bock for me. The Guac came out almost immediately, followed quickly by the tacos.  If there was any real problem with the evening, it was that the drink orders were slow to come out - I had to resist eating the tacos until I could wash them down with sweet sweet Shiner.  Eating tacos outside, drinking Shiner, bathed in the light of a Lone Star, it evoked a pleasant nostalgia for my years in Texas.  This is one of the great patios in Chicago. But more about the tacos - quite simply, these were the best tacos I have ever had.  The pork in the al pastor melts in your mouth, the marinade is deliciously complex, and the pineapple ratchets up the flavor.  The pork belly is similarly juicy with a hit of acid from the tomato and a refreshing sprinkling of queso.  The guac is fine, with a little kick, and the chips are crispy and pleasant, but overly salted - the chips in the bottom of the basket are caked in a salt mine. As good as the tacos are, I think the secret star here is the drink selection.  Kelly's margarita was set your hair on end strong, and the bourbon selection here is among Chicago's best, especially their single barrel collection, which is around ten strong.  I'm not sure even Delilah's has that many personally selected single barrels.  After tacos, I had a taste of the Wild Turkey Kentucky Spirit barrel, and one of the Four Roses selections - the one with the higher alcohol content, of course. These two selections perfectly demonstrate the breadth of favor profiles one can find in bourbon.  Kentucky Spirit smelled of sawdust and wood shops, and immediately transported me to the rickhouses in rural Kentucky.  The bourbon was incredibly smooth but provided a warming kick down my throat.  Even Kelly, who finds most bourbons too rough and tumble, enjoyed this one.  If you keep Kentucky Spirit on your lips, it will provide a pleasant numbness.  I would expect nothing less from the Wild Turkey distillery, which excels at the roughneck style of bourbon, even in their more refined product. Four Roses, however, had a more aristocratic flavor profile, with a nose of pine cones an cedar, and smooth, citrus flavor.  I would expect this from Four Roses, where the distillery is designed in a Spanish style California Stucco mansion style.  A California wine grower or Spanish aristocrat would drink this bourbon. I would be content to spend hours savoring their bourbon selection and tacos, but demand far outstrips square footage supply.  If the owners could manage to open a second location, perhaps in a massive factory floor in the Fulton Market with a capacity of ten times or more, I'm sure they'd still make a killing.  Still, if you are able to manage a table here, you'll have an evening to remember.",0.9986,0.807,0.166,0.027,0.5000340136054421

I came here over the summer for dinner with a friend.  The patio was crowded and the bar was crowded.  Okay, fine.  After being carded to even get in (I'm sorry it's 6:45 at a ""restaurant"" and you're carding me?), I asked the hostess how long of a wait.  She told me 4 tables were ahead of us.  I politely said that doesn't really help me much, could you give me a time estimate, please?  She said she absolutely could not.  How does me knowing there are 4 tables ahead of me give me any idea of how long I will be waiting?  Oh right, it doesn't.  I mean, there could be 4 tables ready to leave right now and I'll be seated in 5-10.  Or there could be no free tables for the next hour because everyone just sat down and I'll be standing around with my stomach grumbling for 60 plus minutes, still not knowing how much longer I'll be waiting. Okay, attitude aside, my friend and I decided to find a space at the bar to grab a drink.  Easier said than done.  After about 5 minutes of poking, trying to get through, we saw two seats open up and jumped on them like a fat kid on cake.  We decided to order food there too due to the aforementioned unknown wait time.   The food was fine - my pork belly taco was more chewy than crispy and the special tostada (something with chorizo and potatoes) was good, though hard to eat.  Maybe my friend and I were just yapping too much but I remember that everything was pretty cold when I was eating it.   Take out was not great.  Granted, I don't live very close to Big Star but I had a Mexican food craving and instead of going to get Mexican like I wanted my hubs surprised me with tickets to the Hawks game (the nerve).  By the time the game let out, I still wanted Mexican and this was the only place open that I could come up with that didn't start with Taco and end with Bell.  By the time we got home, our food wasn't super hot and everything was kind of soggy.   The price is right ($3 tacos) so I'm certainly not opposed to coming back, but I won't make it a special trip.",0.9927,0.802,0.146,0.052,0.4676017187177902

We started with the guacamole, which was awesome because it had red onion on top, and it had a lot of lime juice, which is my favorite.  Then I had two pork belly tacos, the Tacos de Panza...... Wow. Big Star, you get a BIG A+ for these pork belly tacos.  They were messy, crispy, tasty, delicious, juicy, and we stood in the bar to eat them because we were too hungry to wait an hour for a table.  But gosh darn it, they were worth it.  Plus, you need to add the salsa verde that they have in the bottle.

The star-by-star review: 1 - If you order food, go with the tacos de pescado; the tilapia is absolutely delicious.  After a dash of hot sauce, these tacos are the perfect snack to prevent drinking on an empty stomach.  Which leads me to... 2 - The drinks!  Big Star's claim to fame is their enormous selection of whiskey, but the tequila and American craft beer selections are also respectable.  Every night of the week (weekends included!), there is a $3 special whiskey shot.  The Big Star margaritas may steal the limelight, but you must try an Old Fashioned.  It was a bit stronger than I'm accustomed to and perhaps not as complex as a drink from ""that speakeasy across the street,"" but it was a smooth and enjoyable drink. 3 - The bar was insanely packed, but the bartender stopped by after a few minutes to see if my Old Fashioned was made to my liking.  Who doesn't love good customer service? 4 - The outdoor patio is perfect for people watching, or when it is just too damn loud inside of the restaurant itself. 5 - Maybe you're getting ready to call it a night and that one little taco wasn't enough for you?  Fear not, there's a to-go window, where you can grab another for the road.

2011-09-19,4.0,Big Star is the kind of place you become a regular at. The concept is to bring an authentic boarder town cantina experience to Chicago. They specialize in my two favorite spirits: Bourbon and Tequila. The cocktails all have deep and complex flavors. I also love the smokey flavor of mescal and this is one of the few places in the city that incorporate it well. The food is simple and excellent. My favorite taco is the pork belly but they also do the best fish taco I've ever had. I'm campaigning to have them add tacos de lengua. I was in last night and did the sonaran dog. I was completely blown away. It had a wonderful spiciness to it I wasn't expecting.

We arrived about noon and got the last booth even though they reserved it for a group of four.  That was very cool!  The waitress was friendly and attentive and the guacamole was great - creamy with a few chunks and sit up and notice lime flavor instead of burn your tongue off spice that is more prevalent other places.  When you are a 58 year old retired Spanish teacher in a Hipster Taco joint it is giggly fun but your expectations for a decent taco are pretty darn low.   And that's what I love about low expectations - when the opposite occurs it just lights up your brain and in this case also your mouth.  I loved the Al Pastor and the pork belly tacos I devoured and my sister loved her corn taco but found it a tad spicy.  My daughter enjoyed the fish taco very much as well so they were batting a thousand. Then why the four, Kathy?  I found the sleek grey cool gas station redo  of the restaurant didn't work in the bathroom - it seemed pretty much like a dirty gas station bathroom to me.  And the music was crazy loud for lunchtime at noon.  I get it if there are a couple of hundred bodies at the bar on a pulsating night but volume controls can be dialed down, yes?

2011-08-27,3.0,"Someone really ought to consider listing a second review spot for Big Star's take-out window, rather than reviewing the place as a whole, because the experiences are completely different. From a business perspective, the brilliant thing about Big Star, is it does a lot of different things for a lot of people.   There's a scene there, and plenty of scenesters to fill the space.  The scene many times spills out onto Damen with people waiting in excess of 90 minutes just to be a part of that scene.  Not my thing for sure, but I can see how if you were a scenester, this would be the place to go- especially in the summer. The over all feel for Big Star is one that I actually kind of like.  A converted garage, kind of divey, with Hank Williams and Johnny Cash spinning on old 45s and ample amounts of whiskey, bourbon and beer on offer at the bar.  The problem becomes, once again, the popularity of the place somewhat takes away from the experience.  Somewhat cramped seating areas and heavily worked staff equals a not so pleasant dining and drinking experience.  On more than one occassion I have had to ask someone to get the bartender's attention because I've had an empty beer and water glass for the last 15 minutes.  I'm a camel...  I need to drink... The prices over all are pretty reasonable.  Considering, no matter how you feel about this, these are some outstanding tacos, paying $3 a pop isn't outrageous.  I find that other items on the menu are fairly priced as well, and the fact that you can get a 7 oz. pour of Schlitz for a buck is about the only thing that attracts me inside these days. Which brings me to the other experience- the take-out window.  Perhaps the best no-longer-kept secret in Wicker Park, you can order pretty much any food item while Big Star is open, wait a few minutes and either take it to go, or eat at some picnic tables immediately next to the scenesters (or venture over to the REAL Wicker Park and eat amongst the families, drug addicts and dealers, and other fun people watching people).  I guess technically it is BYOB, but keep that shit in a paper bag and hide it because it really isn't allowed there. Considering I don't live too far away, and work even closer, I love Big Star for the take-out window and the ability to get some tasty al pastor, huitlacoche (by the way- many of the servers there don't know how to properly say the word ""huitlacoche""), and pescado tacos on the go.

I cam here on a beautiful Monday afternoon, arriving at about 7pm to hear a 30 party wait on the bar side.  Unfortunate, yes, but it was expected.  So of course our entire group just migrated to the picnic side since we were starving.  I got some tacos -- al Pastor (pork), de Panza (pork belly), and de Pescado (fish).  Can I say amazing?  I don't know what the bad reviews are saying, but these are honestly one of the most tastiest tacos I've ever eaten.  The flavors are just so pungent, well balanced, and unique.  They're not that authentic type, but well crafted, well executed, and well done!  Have you ever had those overpowering corn tortillas where you bite into it and all you taste is corn? Well, not here!  There's plenty of meat and all the fixins'.  However, I must say they are quite small, so minus one star.  You will need to eat about 3-5 tacos depending on your appetite.

I like that it wasn't chewy; it was cooked just right. -Chips and Guacamole - I do see many negative reviews on here but personally it tasted great. The guac had a lot of cilantro (which I LOVE so perhaps I'm biased) and the chips weren't too oily either (but a tad salty)  The dollar beers were also pretty sweet!

Someone took our order within 10 minutes and he kept coming back to us consistently, asking us if we wanted anything else etc.  -the bartenders were also keeping up with the crowds and circling around every 5 minutes ** The bathrooms were clean!

I work down the street from this place and often consider popping in for a beer and couple of tacos, and am discouraged by the crowd. Because unless you're on your own and can squeeze in at the bar, odds are, if the weather's nice and it's thursday-sunday, you're going to be waiting f-o-r-e-v-e-r.

As if that wasn't enough, their other three varieties - a veggie option, grilled pork shoulder, or beer battered fish - are all excellent as well. I recommend shelling out the whopping $12 to try all four. 3. The space. Despite the withering Manhattan Once-Overs I always fear I'm attracting, I love the atmosphere once I'm settled in and know someone's hard at work fixing us up some grub. The knowledgable bartenders double as DJ and spin a perfectly eclectic mix of folksy, bluesy honky-tonk records. The bar is enclosed in a converted white-washed concrete garage that's breezy and opens up onto a large, sunny patio. I feel instantly transported way out West, and invariably end up day dreaming until my food arrives.

The bar tenders were cool and very helpful.  Not at all what I expected from a place which is too cool for school.  I recommend the Michelada - beer mixed with lime and something similar to spicy bloody mary mix served over ice.  So refreshing! Based on this I'd be pleased to give this place a three star rating - good solid food, good drinks (excellent Bourbons), but nothing earth shattering. They lose a star (pun intended) for the attitude and waiting.  After waiting 45 minutes for a table I inquired where we were on the list.  It turns out they'd crossed off our name and hadn't called us.  I was told we'd get the next table.  Back in the bar my wife had scored some seats, so we sat.  In 10 minutes, still no word from the front desk, we ordered.  45 minutes later when we left, still nothing.  I'm happy to wait, but the restaurant better keep up their end of the deal.  This was not cool. In short - if you are looking for a sceney bar with fun outdoor space, please go here.  If you are looking for take out tacos use their take out window, they are tasty.  However, I see no reason to wait this long, and put up with the attitude just for a few pretty good tacos.  You can use your time more wisely.",0.983,0.791,0.157,0.053,0.5250712250712251

2011-08-09,3.0,"My first attempt at Big Star was a weekend blind meet up.  It resulted in standing uncomfortably at a packed bar and being deafened by country music for 5 minutes before my date suggested leaving for another place to go eat.  This is not the place to go to in the evening if you want to hold conversation with your company.  Seating for an actual table was over an hour wait if I remember correctly. I gave Big Star a second chance and this time around I decided to have lunch here at around 1pm on a Monday with friends that were visiting from out of town.  This decision might have saved Big Star from getting a 1-2 star review.  We were able to sit at a table on the patio immediately this time around but the availability really just depends on whether you plan to go in the day time or during peak hours. I can't comment on the bartenders here but the rest of the service was average at best.  Our waitress seemed bored and succumbed to the little nuances that separate good servers from outstanding servers (ie, not splitting the check when we asked, not up selling menu items, not smiling).  Here's a tip for anyone working at these types of scene restaurants.  I don't care how hip you are.  The general rules of good customer service will stand until the end of time so you better fall in line. The food here is really good.  It's the only saving grace that keeps this restaurant in business.  Between the 3 of us, we sampled the tacos (fish, pork belly, pastor) and the queso fundito.  The fish tacos weren't fantastic but everything else was excellent.  You might have problems with the size of the tacos but I found that 2-3 were more than filling.  Having the option of getting sodas made with cane sugar was also nice.  We didn't order anything from the bar but I can only assume that if you're a whiskey or tequila person the drink menu won't disappoint you. All in all, Big Star's food is good enough to merit a visit.  They might have been better suited to exist as a fleet of food trucks instead of a brick and mortar restaurant.  Bring cash with you since they don't accept anything else.  If all you care about are the tacos, then go to the side window and save yourself some time.  If you're going to dine in, do it before 6-7pm.",0.9926,0.808,0.141,0.051,0.5399999999999999

I didn't know they made tortillas that small... about 2 bites to a taco.  The fish tacos were nothing special.  The pork shoulder with pineapple was good but dry.  The hot sauces (1 red and one green were good).  I wanted guacamole and chips but at $8 I don't think so.  Shouldn't someone at least bring it to my table for a $20 dinner...?

When we decided to take some pictures, we had to huddle up and have some sit atop the booth to fit the camera shot. Our group was immediately approached and told to get down. We understood their frustration and did just that. Shortly after, we glance over to the bar and see a couple getting a little freaky. now this type of  thing happens in bars all the time, so we all made a comment on how classy it was and tried to get back to drinking. However, it went from heavy petting to a full on view of butt cheek. now having our full attention, and that of some others at the bar, the guy's hand slowly formed two fingers and made way to the butthole. good gawd! after watching this for about 5 minutes and cracking up, we notice a couple of the employees watching as well.. Now here is where the review takes a bad turn....These voyeuristic employees were the same ones that told us dickishly to get off the booth top.

The guacamole was flavor-packed, full of lime (without it being overpowering), and a decent portion for $8. The pork belly tacos are still some of the best things I've ever ingested. The pastor tacos are good, but not quite up to the level of the pork belly (panza), AKA perfection. I tried their pinto beans recently, and though I wish they were a bit less liquid-y, they were plenty smoky and -you guessed it- flavorful. I just can't give this place five stars, you see. It's so pretentious and takes itself so seriously that it makes me want to roll my eyes rather hard. From the condescending hostess (with her not-British-not-American accent) scoffing at the idea that we'd want a table, to the cash-only policy, to the very limited menu...I don't know. It all seems very ""we can do whatever we want, even if it annoys you, because our food is good."" That's fine, but it's annoying. Take credit cards from the hipsters and Mexican food lovers who crowd your place at all hours. Act like you're happy to see customers (you will live, I promise!). Of similar annoyance is their prices - not high enough to be obnoxious, but just a hair above what you want to pay - but you will pay it anyway because it's not THAT bad.

So I don't sound like a whiny jerk a few things to clear up - when my group of friends and I headed off for dinner here we fully aware of three things: 1) We were a group of seven which can be tricky on a busy night 2) We went on a Saturday evening and were prepared for a late dinner 3) We knew this place is really popular right now so our expectation was to wait a minimum of an hour Period end of story, my opinion of this place was ruined by the staff. Our group was treated so rudely I don't care if they offered me a pedicure while eating, gold plated silverware that I get to keep and a $100 to come back to eat again. I won't belabor you with the full shit-show that was our visit to Big Star but essentially what should have been a simple seating of seven people turned into waiting around for 2.5 hours, being told that they can't physically sit a table of 7 (there was a 13-top there when we first arrived at 8pm), being told that we were going to have to be split into two tables, being insulted to our faces AND that was all topped off with mediocre food.  I will give it to them the premise (simple, ala carte style menu) is interesting and makes ordering easy and the patio seating is pretty killer. My braised pork shoulder taco was OK at best. It had a good marinade but I felt like it was lack luster. I also had a fish taco and it was fine. The house salsas were bland. My friend had the chicken thigh tostada that was so spicy she couldn't eat it. This is a girl that practically drinks Sriracha and she couldn't get through this plate!  The only good things about the evening was the margaritas and the guacamole.

It disrupts the pleasure of a dining experience to make me think about how much currency I have, if I'm eating and drinking (i.e., having fun) too much, and to cause me to leave the establishment or even the conversation to go procure money, or stop ordering when I might have otherwise had another drink or Senoran dog (just kidding about the dish; that, experienced, was fairly frightening).

This also happened to be when a huge heat wave came to the area. Luckily on a day where we were walking the neighborhood, we came across Big Star. It looked cool, sounded cool, and had in door and outdoor space on this VERY HOT DAY. Pitcher of margs was amazing and the chips were yummy. We must have sat for about 2 hours and nobody tried to move us along. Granted it was 1pm on a Monday, but there was quite a crowd there and they were all LOVING their food and the company. All of that being said, the food LOOKED DELISH and I am sorry that we didn't have room to try it. I am even more upset that we do not have a spot like this back in Brooklyn, NY.

Just thinking about those pork tacos with the pineapple and cheese is giving me a fwoodie (yes, that's short for a food woodie). ""But then why did you give this place only 3 stars?"" you ask? Two words... The Service. My brother was visiting from LA and we walked through my neighborhood looking for a place to eat. We really wanted to go to Belly Shack, but it was a Monday and they were closed. We trekked further down Milwaukee and came across Big Star. I had heard both positive and negative things about the place, but we were starving and headed inside regardless. The people that work here are rude hipsters that seem to not give a crap about the fact that you're there to give them your hard earned money for a meal. We were seated in such a way that amounted to being told ""There's some stools over there. Go sit."" We were ignored by the bartenders/waiters for about 15 minutes even though we were ready to order about 3 minutes after sitting and attempting to flag down a bartender several times. We finally ordered and our food came out ultra fast, like within 2 or 3 minutes. At least the chef seems to give a crap about the customers. Once we were done eating the fantastic grub we couldn't even get a bartender to give us our damned receipt. He was more interested in figuring out which record album he was going to spin on the turntable next. We just threw a few bucks on the counter and left.

2011-06-17,4.0,"I'm basing my number of stars mostly on the food.  Which is mostly AMAZING.  The tacos de panza are AMAZEBALLS.  They're filled with crispy porkbelly and other wonderful things.  (FYI, I was wary to order these because I've been disappointed by floppy, rubbery, stringy porkbelly before.  This porkbelly is crispy and perfect.)  The fish tacos are really, really good too.  Not greasy at all, nice and bright.  When I come again, I'm just ordering a crapload of these two things. The sonoran hotdog was pretty bad.  I lived in LA for a couple years, so I'm no stranger to the bacon-wrapped hotdog situation.  However, this one is just...not good.  I don't mind that it's covered in goop (I was looking forward to the goop), but it's all SUPER salty and muddled together.  You can't taste any of the individual flavors, so it's just a soggy, salty mess.  I didn't eat the bun because it was too messy and i didn't want to waste stomach space on something I wasn't liking.  I basically just ate the dog part with a knife and fork, and tried to find some combination of the condiments that would be good.  It was all just blah.  It's $7, so I sort of wish I would have just ordered a couple more tacos instead. Their margaritas are also not great.  The upside is that they dump like half a bottle of tequila in each pitcher, so booze-wise you get your money's worth.  (I think it was $30 for a pitcher that provided maybe 6-8 very strong margaritas.)  However, it's basically just tequila and sour mix.  I hate sour mix.  Real margaritas should not just be tequila sullied with crappy sour mix.  Maybe if you order individual ones they do something different or take more care, but the pitchers aren't what I want in a margarita.  Also, they're warm.  Yes, they throw a bunch of ice in the pitcher, but if your tequila is warm and your sour mix is warm, your margaritas are going to be warm.  I wish they chilled the sour mix first.  But, they do have a great whiskey/bourbon list and a great tequila list.  The beers are very reasonably priced for this kind of place ($3-5 in general).  They have some really interesting looking bourbon and tequila cocktails that run like $7.   Yes, the place gets super crowded.  I was lucky that I met friends who had already put our name in and been waiting, so I basically just rolled up and sat down.  But, within half an hour of our sitting down, the place got pretty nuts.  It was raining, so the capacity was seriously lowered by the fact that no one could sit outside.   I did not get any of the attitude from the staff here that other people have complained about, but I could see how a place like this could foster snotty hipsterism.  Our waitress was just fine.  Very nice, did her best to get around to us.  We did have to search her out and flag her down a few times to order more drinks, more tacos, etc., but she was doing a good job in a very crowded and loud place.  The food comes out very quickly, which was surprising and highly appreciated.   So, overall: -Get the tacos de panza and the tacos de pescado. -Don't bother with the margaritas unless you seriously just need a vehicle to get some tequila in your veins, STAT. -Be patient, and if you don't want to deal with the atmosphere inside (which can be overwhelming), order to go.",0.9961,0.732,0.177,0.092,0.5271990740740741

I'm docking one star for the hostess, and another star for the doorman.  I have found both to be unnecessarily smug and rude on more than one occasion.  Don't act like you're doing me a huge favor by acknowledging my existence...   Aside from their general smugness, I had one experience early on a weekend afternoon (it wasn't that crowded), when I was meeting some friends for tacos & drinks... My friends were already seated, and I was on the list with a another friend.  When our name got called, the table next to my friend's table was paying the bill, but the hostess insisted on seating us at a table that had just opened on the other side of the patio.  I asked if she could please just give the open table to the next party on the list and that we would be fine waiting a few minutes for the table next to our friends to clear.  She said no, and kept insisting that she couldn't do that because it ""wouldn't be fair"" to everyone else behind us on the list.  Huh?  I was like, do you think the people after us on the list will be upset about getting seated sooner and not being at a table next to my friends?  She just continued to say no, she couldn't do it.  I said fine, we'll take the table that is available now and just request with our waiter to move to the other table when it opens in one minute.  She still said no... She was freaking determined not to let us sit next to our friends that we had come to hang out with... You call this customer service?  Meanwhile, the people finished paying and got up from the table we had wanted while we were back to arguing some more about the fairness issue... I pointed and showed her that they were now gone (which literally took less than a minute from the time this whole conversation started), and I asked if we could now have the table since it was also empty.  She looked defeated, and although it appeared to pain her greatly, she said fine.  I said great, thank you... And we sat down to eat.  Jeez! My fiancee and I went for dinner recently... We gave our ID's to the guy manning the door and he said there's a wait.  I asked about how long he thinks it might be and he just mumbled something like ""I don't know"" as he looked in the other direction.  It came across as so freaking smug!  Perhaps he could have said I'm not sure and pointed us to the person who would know, or said at least an hour, or something that would have been at least slightly pleasant and helpful.  We immediately just turned around and left, and actually had a surprisingly tasty meal at Penny's across the street.

I do not recommend the vegetarian, however.  I have trouble deciding which taco is my favorite. They're all so perfectly crafted. To anyone who could complain about $3 tacos, no entiendo. A taco at taco bell is $1, and this is three times that, but 50 times better. Mathematically, it adds up. So you pay $9 for 3 tacos. Um, that's how much a taco entree would cost at any regular restaurant. HOW is this expensive??? Right, it's not. The patio and the interior are so awesome. You want to hang out there forever.  Therein lies the problemo. People do stay for hours on end. And you might never get a seat. Add that to the totally apathetic hostess (you're a hostess. You walk people to their seats. Walk. people. to. their. seats. I had this job once, and it is so not as cool as you think it is, lady) and your wait could be 2 hours.  So try to come at off times, and enjoy the food.

2011-05-31,4.0,"I finally got to go to Big Star! Everyone know it's one of the places to be in Wicker Park! A true testament to that is it being featured in the most recent Time Out Chicago.  Alfresco season is upon us in the city and this is one of the prime locations to dine. My friends and I waited 90 minutes for a table yesterday but the great thing is you don't have to hang around while you wait. We put our name down, drove off and did some shopping, then they called us when they were ready. We were seated in their outdoor area and it was the perfect weather for the venue...warm but with a bit of a breeze. We were very slow getting service and just throughout the meal attention to our table was pretty weak. That could definitely be improved upon here. We waited 30 minutes for our beers to come up. C'mon now. However, our server was nice and friendly. A big plus with Big Star is the prices! Tacos are $3 each (took 4 of them to fill me up!) and beers range in price from $1-$7ish? But you can order pitchers plus tons of other drinks. Being the cheap girl that I am, I went with the 7 oz $1 Schlitz beer. It hit the spot so well I got a second one. Great deal! On to the food! I tried my friend's hot dog and am sorry to say it wasn't very special. Drenched in toppings was it's main selling point but that didn't work for me. I tried the Tacos al Pastor (pork shoulder with pineapples, very good), the Tacos de Panza (pork belly taco, extremely tasty but the pork belly was overcooked making it a bit hard to eat, slightly disappointing) and TWO of the Tacos de Pescado (beer battered tilapia with chipotle mayo). The true winner was the Fish Taco! It is highly recommended! The chipotle mayo on it was amazing although it had my weak tastebuds on fire. It was seriously so good, I ended up ordering a second one.

We ordered one of each taco.  The pork belly and the pork shoulder were so delicious, we were fighting for the last bites.  The long bean taco was not my thing, but if you're into smokey than that's probably the taco for you.

2011-05-14,4.0,"I only pull it back to 4 stars due to the wait and service. The food: tacos are amazazing.  The head chef there really loves his food and it shows.  I have zero problems with the tacos.  They are everything I want in a taco.  Plenty of other great options too: sonoron hot dog if you're into pure madness.  It's a hot dog on steroids.  Plenty of classic dishes and the ensalada de big star is perfectly executed every time. 'so why not just get food from the walk-up to-go window and call it a day?' The drinks: 7 oz. schlitz.  A midwest classic.  Big Star also has a featured whiskey shot for each day of the week.  These choices regularly rotate.  They're all good whiskeys, but featured shots are only $3.  It's a great way for you to try out some fantastic whiskeys and find your favorites without having to spend too much cash.  This is perfect for the 'oft hipster crowd, as they can all have their own favorite whiskey and drop those dreaded lines: 'but you've probably never heard of it'.  Whatever, I can deal with the 'scene' there.  If not, I'll just order a margarita that's stronger than a silverback gorilla.  Damn good, too. Service/wait:  Big Star isn't a huge space, so there's always potential for awkwardness as you may be bumped around until you're standing right over someone's table.  The wait may be long, so elbow your way in to the island bar and order a drink.  The service is what you may expect from a joint like this.  Servers are too few and due to being overworked and shouted at, they can't help but be apathetic to individual queries or requests.  Plus, hipsters don't tip. Look, these guys put this place in this location because they wanted to make sure they get a lot business.  The place wouldn't be busy for only that reason, however.  Their food and drinks are great, and the owners have done an excellent job of highlighting both, rather having one take a backseat to the other.  Do many of the patrons spend hours in front of a mirror trying to make it look like they don't give a damn what they're wearing? Yes.  Could it be worse?  Yes.  Much, much worse (been to kumas lately?).  You're only being glared at because people are pissed you've found their spot.  Chicago's restaurant scene is blossoming more than ever, and Big Star is often dropped into that conversation.  If you hate crowds, be sure to go during off hours but either way, you must go here.

2011-05-13,3.0,"So I'd go again, if my friends wanted to go. I think it was only a 3 start-okay was because my expectations were slightly skewed (definitely need to do homework when venturing into tragically hip Wicker Park*).  So I just assumed this was a ""regular"" restaurant.  By normal I mean with a smiling/welcoming host, sturdy tables, and a staff eager to help you (aka quickly help you to get you out of the way when you are standing directly in front of them; however, the hostess here only speaks when spoken to-if she were a man that'd be my kind of guy, ha). Big Star is not a ""regular"" restaurant. I'm conflicted on how to describe it. Could it be taco stand that has some salvage tables and booze or is it restaurant with shabby tables and staff?  Please scroll down to the last paragraph for my conclusion if you don't want to ready my non-foodie point of view on the food. This is what I learned on my big adventure to Wicker Park's Big Star...it is not a restaurant, it's a taco joint with a solid beer and liquor selection. Take Heed my friends!! The cocktails are made by your Let's-start-Happy Hour-at-Noon-Grandma-suffering-from-an-arthritic-shaking-hand (for those that don't get it...they are strong). Don't expect to come here and be waited on; you have to be aggressive here if you want anything. You want a menu-either you get it yourself or ask the server 3 times for it. You want napkins or silverware- take a look around for a station and grab them. If you require padded seats and plenty of table room-forget it.  Some notes on the food...the tacos are good, but not to die for-they did have some creative creations (e.g. Taco de Ejotes-braised long beans.  They only use corn tortillas but they aren't that corny (ha); a very mild flavor.  The Sonoran Hot Dog was Delicious!! It's a bacon wrapped hot dog with tons of toppings.  The guacamole is pretty tasty too.  If I didn't need beer to make me happy, or if for some outlandish reason didn't feel like drinking and was really only coming for the food, I would choose another restaurant.   So in conclusion, I would personally describe Big Star as a bar that happens to have some decent food (um, but wait...doesn't that describe 75% of all food establishments in Chicago).  *The term ""tragically hip"" was coined in the West (North) Side Story performed at the Chemically Imbalance Theater.

The patio area looked full, but there were plenty of spaces to squeeze in along the picnic benches by the take-out taco window, so I opted for take-out.    I ordered three tacos- taco del pescado, taco al pastor, and taco de panza. While the accompanying salsas turned out to be tasty, each taco's flavors were so tantalizing and perfect in themselves, that I did not really feel a need to add anything but the customary lime.       However, I do believe that there are even much better tacos at many of the little taquerías and Mexican restaurants throughout the city, and therefore, I am only giving Big Star 4 stars. For example, Tío Luis' on Archer's taco de carne asada with cilantro, cebolla, y crema feeds my taco fantasies any day, and the homemade tortillas at Café Mundial  on 18th or at Amelia's on 47th & Halsted beat the tortillas at Big Star any day! Oh, yes, and their horchata is just so-so. It's missing the lovely glumps of cinnamon and rice you would find elsewhere. I would give Big Star 3 stars if it weren't for the convenient location & fun patio!    I'll definitely be back, though, for more tacos de pescado and to laugh at all the poorly pronounced orders at the taco window! :)",0.9917,0.831,0.159,0.01,0.46666666666666656

2011-03-29,2.0,"Because of the daunting lines outside and the hornets' nest of swarming hipsters and yuppies inside, I had avoided Big Star for over a year.   I was finally persuaded to go for a friend's birthday and the promise of amazing margaritas and guacamole.  We arrived at 7 p.m. on a Saturday with a group of seven and the hostess warned us that the wait would be long as there were 15 groups ahead of us.   We had anticipated a wait so we squeezed our way to the bar and ordered a pitcher of margaritas to hold us over.  While I still think $30 for a pitcher is steep, it did contain an entire bottle of tequila.  They weren't the best tasting, a little sour for my liking not to mention quite strong, but they did the trick. A mere two hours later, we were seated.  There are very few things in life I'm willing to wait two hours for so my expectations were high.  We ordered the chips and guacamole for the table and I chose an al pastor taco and black bean tostada.  Our order came out fast but our group had expanded to 10 and they brought out each type of taco or tostada on a single plate so you had to shout across the table to see who ordered what so they could put it on their individual plate.  Not the most efficient way to serve a large party in my opinion. The taco tasted not unlike what you could order at Chipotle and while the tostada was good, it was no better than what I've had at any other Mexican restaurant.  The guacamole was a decent size for the price but  it was no better than I've made at home. I realize I'm basing my opinion on one experience but I just don't see the appeal of Big Star.  You can get better taqueria style food for less at any one of the many restaurants in Wicker Park near Western and Armitage, which also serve alcohol, and you won't have to be squished, yell to hear your friends or be bothered by a rude doorman.",0.9593,0.854,0.095,0.051,0.4121428571428571

Our server was VERY nice and was very attentive.  Overall there isn't really anything to complain about except that the patio is very small and even at 2pm on a Wednesday we had to wait about 10 min to get a table out there.  I cannot imagine what the wait is in the summer on a weekend night!",0.9919,0.79,0.199,0.012,0.5616666666666666

We ordered the Taco Al Pastor, Taco Al Pescado and the Queso Fundido.  This was plenty of food for two people and totaled $14.  The tacos appear small when they arrive, but they are full of toppings.  The queso fundido was extremely flavorful and filling.  The pork on the taco was a little dry for my taste.  I wondered if maybe they were using pork left over from last night.  Overall, the food was worth returning to Big Star. Many of the reviewers have had negative experiences with the service.  We had a wonderful experience.  My husband expressed a desire to try tequila, but admitted a lack of knowledge and an interest in trying a flight of tequilas even though that wasn't on the menu.  The waitress was so cool about it.  She wanted to be helpful, so she suggested that he try the three levels of tequila of all the same brand in order to get an idea for the differences.  She went to check with her manager to see what they could offer him.  They put together a reasonably priced flight for him to try.   He enjoyed it and learned something new!  The waitstaff was really quick about clearing away any empty dishes from our table as well.  We were very pleased with the service.",0.986,0.83,0.131,0.039,0.44897447380205996

While my visits are rare over this long cold hell known as winter, only visiting for a quick fix at the taco window after getting off the train, know that I'll return at the first sign of the sun. Like the phoenix that rises from the ashes, your patio will rise again from the muck, salt and grime to become hipster heaven flavored with margaritas and delicious slow-cooked meats wrapped in pillowy tortillas. Are the waits long and occasionally torturous? Absolutely. But once you're ensconced in the comforting bosom of this asphalt-covered nirvana, there is no equal. A pitcher of margaritas or a Pancho and Lefty in hand and a platter of tacos wending its way from the kitchen and troubles cease to exist.  The pork belly, as hordes of unwashed flannel-wearing Wicker Park denizens have said before me, is spectacularly delicious, but there's oh so much more to enjoy. The roasted poblano taco is a subtly sweet herbaceous masterpiece, redolent of peppery goodness with a solid slab of melty cheesy goodness on top.  The Sonoran hot dog is a godsend, with some bizarrely delicious sauce that can only be derived from the purest crack cocaine. And watch out for the specials, the beef heart taco is love in meat form, believe it or not. Braised to tender perfection, it's a reminder that everyone's organ needs some love. Plus - order the dulche de leche milkshake right freaking now and ask them to drop a shot of bourbon in it. There's no way to be unhappy when sipping on a straw full of that. Is the staff sometimes a bit harried? Sure. But deal with the wait and crowd with good humor and they'll offer the same.

At one point, I almost fell over the bar trying to get his attention. The few times he did acknowledge us, he purposely slammed things on the bar right in front of us as though we were bothering him. After enough abuse, we decided to close up our tab and leave. Once again... he ignored us for 15 min.  My boyfriend usually leaves generous tips but this time I argued against that.  If the bartender was annoyed with the idea of serving 2 professional Hispanics, then he should not be upset with not receiving money from us.  After some debate, we agreed to give the tip money to the bar backs. They were the only two who acknowledge us and worked their asses off.  Overall, I consider myself to be a reasonable person. Perhaps the bartender was having a bad day... we all do.

We were sat at our table shortly after getting the bar and grabbing our first drink.  The table allowed for our party of 6 but couldnt handle many more.  Our waitress was great and was full of personality.  I ordered a margarita on the rocks and it was one of the best I've had in Chicago.  We decided on family style which is what I would recommend for groups.  We had a variety of delicious tacos.  Tacos Al Pastor was my favorite (pork shoulder, grilled pineapple, onions and cilantroz)....YUM!  My second was Tacos De Panza made with pork belly...get it!  The close third was the Tacos De Raja De Poblano with roasted poblano peppers and the Tinga De Pollo made with wood grilled chicken thighs.  We ordered two orders of guacamole to go with our meal which was a great addition.   I will definately be back and ready to try more off the menu.",0.9942,0.829,0.155,0.016,0.48302469135802467

I wasn't that hungry and it was great because they have $3 tacos. I had the fish one and the sauce they serve on it was amazing. I also had the special taco of the day which is only$2 and that was an in house made pork skin with salsa verde. It was a bit spicy but also tasted good. Now the drinks, they have a special $3 whiskey shot of the day and some really cheap beer. I decided to stick to the margaritas. I first had the one with mezcal. I always forget I don't really like mezcal because of the smokey taste so the next one I tried had St. Germain in it. This one was much better IMO and I can see sipping on it on a warm summer's day. I finally tried the one with fresca and that by far was my favorite. I love citrus flavors and this was perfect. Our server was also very attentive and didn't rush us and encouraged us to try a few things and order more as we saw fit. It worked out perfectly. She also did a great job of explaining the tacos, beers, and tequilas. I felt like I got some sort of mini alcohol class for free.  They also have quite a few Goose Island beers available. Sophie, Matilda and as of this writing the Pepe Nero which is new and made with black pepper. They also have a GI one that is aged in bourbon barrels.  The one small problem I have is that it is cash only. I normally hate places like that but for smaller restaurants I can understand the hassle and fees that come along with accepting credit cards. However this is a bar or at least they heavily promote their wide array of whiskey, beer and tequila. I don't know anyone who usually carries that much cash on them to be able to afford drinking and sampling of all the delicious drinks. They do have an ATM inside but then think of all the bank and service fees. Luckily my friend had enough cash to cover both of us until I could pay him back. And I suppose it worked out because I was very mindful of how much I was spending.   I need to remember to bring cash the next time I visit and I will be sure to order the fresca margarita.",0.9976,0.758,0.194,0.047,0.5644401154401152

2011-01-13,2.0,"Busy is the word that is most often associated with things operated by the Blackbird, Avec, Violet Hour gang, and this place is usually just as busy as the other buzz joints these folks operate. I have been here many times for beers, but have never had the food here. I like the decor, I like the radio tube amp, and the LPs spinning.  I went in today to try the food. I have been meaning to do so for a long time, and today as I was walking around my neighborhood decided that it was not busy, so I would go in and have a relaxing meal and a beer.  I ordered the pastor taco, the fish taco, and a chorizo and potato tostada. When they came out they were on small tortillas (smallest I have seen in Chicago) which reminded me of the little tacos sold in Piedras Negras, MX for 50 cents. The tacos were wrapped in a single tortilla which goes against the whole taqueria principal of ""dos tortillas de maize"" to hold together the wonderful taco meat/juices.  Taco 1: Grade D  The pastor taco was tasty, but the meat was exceptionally dry. It was one of the worst versions of this classic taco I have ever had. Compared to the Tacos Al Pastor at hole-in-the-wall taquerias this place really put forward a weak offering for a whopping $3 (well more than 30%-50 over the average price of a taco in this city).  Taco 2: Grade A-  Despite the failure to double tortilla the taco, the fish taco here was quite good. Was it worth $3? Probably not, but it was flavorful, and the sauce was perfect. Solid entry.  Tostada: Grade C+  My grandmother who was born and raised on the US-Mexico border in Texas has been cooking tostadas for over 75 years and so I am a tostada snob. This offering was a tiny little tortilla (smaller than the smallest I have seen in Mexico) with black beans (also fairly rare in many parts of Mexico, and certainly Texas), and topped with chorizo and potatoes. Now Chorizo and potatoes is a staple in any Tex-Mex or Mexican breakfast line up, and this was done quite well. The only problem I had with this was that it was a tiny-tiny-tostada, and my grandmother would have had a word or two for the cooks for sure! Was it worth the price? Not really but it was good.  Sauces: the hot sauce (red) is quite nice.  The food was fresh, but not mind blowing.  Cemitas Pueblas a few minutes drive or bike ride west on North Ave. is much better for most of these staples I must say especially if you like pastor.  So, in the end what does Big Star deliver? It gives you quirky ethnic food without having to go into an ethnic neighborhood like Pilsen or a few blocks south of the Wicker Park triangle to Chicago Ave (Think Tacos Veloz). Everyone speaks English, and you don't have to worry about getting a taco made with beef cheek or brains, goat, or lamb by mistake. Many years ago, a friend described this trend as ""de-racinated"" ethnic food. You get the food without the people who make it getting in the way. It is a good business model, but paying nearly $10 for three tiny items was a bit much for me to consider coming back for food.  It reminds me of a place inspired by ""Last Chance Texaco"" (why the Big Star in an old gas station?) which I have always liked when coming here for drinks on busy weeknights or any night for that matter. For people watching, drinking, and fun, and a snack on a hot corner in the city, I'd have no problem going back to soak in the summer sun on the patio and watch the beautiful people, but for the world's best tacos?

And frankly I'm surprised this is the first Big Star review I've written (sorry Big Star, you deserve better). Look the place isn't perfect. It's loud. It's crowded. Seating is limited. It's cash only. But it's also lickable, and that speaks volumes. There are three things I MUST order when I come here.  1. Pitcher of Margaritas- they go down like a hot knife through butter - proceed with caution. You'll lick the salt right off the glass. 2. The Queso- Oh hot damn!! Oh Lord have mercy! Oh lickable gooey cheesy goodness 3. THE PORK BELLY TACOS. You'll lick the pork. You'll lick your fingers. You'll lick the napkin you wipe your hands on. You'll lick the plate they came on. These are by FAR the best tacos I have ever in my food lovin life eaten.  For a casual, fun night out with friends (or a casual date) go to Big Star.

My boyfriend and I went there this past Tuesday around noon and there were about three other people in the bar. We requested a table, since every one of them was empty, but despite the fact that the place was deserted, we were told that we needed at least three people to get a table, so we took a seat at the bar...while every single table remained open for the duration of our stay. We went back yesterday with the required three people and found that again, every table was empty, but were told this time that we had to have four people to get a table. I explained to the hostess that we were just told that we needed three people a couple of days prior, but no dice. She then told us to feel free to have a seat at the bar...which was completely filled. We walked out. I've heard numerous friends complain about Big Star's poor service and pretentious atmosphere in the past. The attitude of the place seems to be ""this place is so popular we don't need your business,"" which I expect may catch up with them at some point.

I'll take three of those and one pork belly taco and chips and salsa. They charged us for the guacamole and chips which is 10 bucks as opposed to just chips and salsa which is three bucks.

Meat was dry and bland and becuase I asked the fucker for no cilantro it seemed like he doubled the cilantro on the tacos.

It was Saturday night o the place was packed but I got lucky with some bar seats pretty quickly. The pork belly taco was delicious and definitely my fave as well. The tinga was pretty good, but I did not like the poblano chile taco at all. The chips and guac were good, I liked the radish garnish.  I had 2 margaritas. They don't carry cointreau or grand marnier or anything similar so expect it to be a little different. I did like them though.  The music was really loud, but also really good. Old school rock-a-billy type stuff. Think Jerry Lee Lewis and Johnny Cash.  As far as bar service, there were 3 bartenders and a bar back. Two of the 3 bartenders were very friendly and helpful but the 3rd (tall blonde) was basically just rude. When we received our food but had not gotten are chips and guac yet I asked about them. All she said was okay and then I watched her put in the order. So clearly she never put the order in the first time, but we didn't get so much as an apology over it. Its something that wouldn't be a big deal at all, if her attitude wasn't so nasty.  We also had an issue with things such as drinks getting picked up and cleared before we were even done with them.

Our bartender was very nice and our food was served quickly. We tried a variety of tacos and tostadas (7 total). The best by far was the fish taco. What I thought was incredibly odd was that the salsa comes in a plastic bottle (like it's ketchup or something) and the chips did not come with a bowl for the salsa. When I asked the guy assisting behind the bar he looked at me like I was crazy. He said ""we have plates."" PLATES???? FOR CHIPS AND SALSA??? It was the weirdest thing.

We arrived at 7 on a Monday night hoping to get one of the 5 actual tables. We waited at the bar patiently for over an hour. It was obvious that those in the booths had finished eating and were just sitting drinking. A couple tables only had 2 or 3 people in them. As my group was hungry, I went to ask how much longer the wait might be. Instead of a ""I'm sorry"" or a ""Just a little bit longer."" I got a ""Do you see an empty booth?"" Look, it's been over an hour on a Monday night, I'm not being unreasonable to ask an approximate time for a table.  Like many places (Tango Sur comes to mind) there is no ""time limit"" on how long you can sit at a table. But unlike Tango Sur there is little to no actual seating. The problem could be solved by just asking people that have already eaten to move to the bar to drink.

Tinga de Pollo - Soft tender chicken, excellent flavor.  Even though it's only chicken, it's a worthwhile taco to try out. Tacos de Panza - Braised pork belly wasn't as crispy as I thought it would be, but the flavor overall was good. Beef Cheek (special) - Wow, this was excellent.  Great flavor, excellent balance of fattiness, it's a shame this is on their rotating menu instead of their regular. Tostada de Pescado - We finished on this dish and kinda wished we had found it earlier... this was by far the best dish on the menu.  Soft tender flaky fish, lots of ""slaw"" with an excllent cucumber-onion yogurt sauce, and some fresh avocado on top.  If you order anything, get this... Horchata - Very cinnamony, but you can definitely get far more horchata at the mom and pop shops for the price.   Verdict:  Lunch service was great, tacos were enjoyable!  This isn't the traditional mom and pop shop, and the price is definitely a higher than what you can get at traditional shops, but this taco is definitely a bit different.  Worth checking out if you don't have to fight the evening craze like others have mentioned!  One of the few drawbacks - Cash only!!!  Be warned!",0.997,0.742,0.232,0.026,0.6038038884192732

And seriously, to all of the ""I know authentic tacos!!"" people, seriously - shut the fuck up already.  There are more than like one or two ways to make a taco - everything doesn't always have to be like that one place you go to when you're druuuuunnnnk and makes ""omg, the best tacos eva!!!"" There are like a fuckbillion ways to make tacos and these are good. Pork belly taco? It's basically a BACON TACO = gooooood Al pastor? STFU! These bitches got it right on! perfect pineapple, lots of burnty pieces with the moist pieces of pork - goooooood Chicken tostada? Hold up - that mess is pollo asado! Con thigh meat - say it with me - gooooooood. The menu changes, but past tacos have included a fried chicken mole taco. That's like my own personal Prince Charming of tacos. I would fucking defile a fried chicken mole taco.  Veg options - rojas poblanos tacos and guacamole and a shake - who doesn't want that? ps - it does seem like a kind of shitty place to work - rich owners making others work with no air conditioning in a hot ass kitchen on a hot ass day while dealing with bitches in ironic gear all day? [shudders] Have mercy on them. Leave tips out of the goodness of your heart or just light a candle later. *I have actually sat inside. It works well only like on a random Tuesday at 2:30pm or something - basically only if it is almost totally empty inside.

2010-10-06,3.0,"Let's get the awful bits out of the way first: 1. TERRIBLE DOOR POLICY/CROWD CONTROL I get that this place is a) a bar and b) a place where food is served. you guys don't kick anyone out, but you don't really let a steady flow of people in, either. This is kind of a problem, not to mention really irritating. There needs to be some rules, I guess, to make sure that people aren't waiting 2+ hours (I've been told this happens to some people) to get tacos and drinks. That's just not right! 2. The food was good, but a bit salty. I ordered Tacos al Pastor and shared a Sonoran hot dog. The tacos had good flavor, but the pork was a bit too salty for my taste. My friend and I ordered the Sonoran hot dog at our own risk, and that too was too salty. I get that I am not ordering 100% healthy food that won't clog my arteries, but there is a line between something that is seasoned well and tastes good but is still bad for you and something that is oversalted and bad for you. If that makes any sense. 3. The noise level. OK, I know, this place is a bar. Bars are loud. But I don't enjoy screaming matches with my friends, so maybe I'll just have to find a place to sit outside instead of inside whenever I am here next. With that out of the way, onto the good: 1. Service was pretty great, considering the place was jam-packed. Our waitresses/servers were so nice and chatty, and they checked up on us often but not too often, which was pleasant. 2. The food and drinks are reasonably priced ($2 for tacos al pastor, $6 for a huuuuge Sonoran hot dog, $7 for bourbon and coke, $7 for a classic margarita), and are delicious even though they are drenched in sodium. Their guacamole is one of the best Ive ever tasted, and their ingredients are fresh. 3. Their drink menu is amazing. Bourbon, bourbon, and more bourbon, please! And the $1 Schlitz draft (7 oz) is pretty awesome. So, this place is alright but not the best. What saves this place from being 1 or 2 stars is the mere fact that they do offer interesting food and serve good drinks. This place is also a good place to people-watch, too. I might be back in like 4 months, if I can ever manage to find an empty place to sit.",0.9981,0.708,0.226,0.066,0.624447895100069

The first two times, I was with two other people and we were told that they would NOT put our name on the wait list for a table unless we had four people or more. We tried to squeeze in at the bar and grab a drink and maybe order some tacos. WRONG. The bartender not only didn't give us menus, she didn't even acknowledge us. And it got old being bumped into and elbowed every five seconds. We left without ordering a thing. Oh Big Star-I have tried!!! Well, last night I went with my husband and some of his friends. We went to put our name down the list and the kind of rude host couldn't estimate how long the wait would be for seven. He took down our cell phone number and said he would call when our table was almost ready.  Two hours later, we still hadn't received a phone call so we headed back to Big Star to see where we were in line. The super UNfriendly host didn't even mention that he forgot to call and miraculously, our table was ready two minutes later. Obviously, they had no idea we were even waiting for a table.  Should I keep going? Ok. We sit down, the waitress rolls over about 25 minutes later to take our drink orders and before our whole group even orders, she walks away. Yes folks, a waitress walked away while taking an order. It doesn't get any better than that. We had to get her attention and remind her that there were still people sitting in front of her who hadn't ordered a drink yet. We decided to order all of our food at that point as well-who knew when this girl was coming back. 15 minutes later our food starts coming out...but still no drinks. Now, I am parched. 10 minutes later, our drinks arrive. Yay! Except she forgets mine. Let's see, 7 people, 7 drink orders,  6 drinks. ???

I had the tacos al pastor and the taco pollo. I love the al pastor. The pineapple is so simple and works so well with it. The chicken was also really tasty, and the queso fresco on top works really well.  My boyfriend and I split a queso fundito, which was really flavorful. The spices they use are really interesting and kind of unexpected. The chorizo is a little salty, but that's the nature of the beast. The bf got one of each of the tostadas and he really enjoyed the chorizo one, but I think he was a bit iffy on the basa tostada. He said it was okay but he probably wouldn't order it again.

Which is what my bf and I did.  We were fortunate to snag two seats and ordered quickly (frijoles charros & tostada de chorizo con papas, with horchata, for him; tacos al pastor, tacos de rajas al poblano and limeade for me).

They do have the takeout window (don't know how long the wait on that is...), so you could order there and hoof it down to Wicker Park (during the day, anyway) to enjoy your comida away from all the craziness.

They serve a kind of Southwest-influenced Mexican street cuisine, Latino-inflected cocktails, and lots of bourbon, among other things. But details about the place are readily available. And opinions too, I guess. Anyway: There are plenty of good Mexican joints in Chicago, but Big Star hits all of the yuppie objectives. Long and well curated booze list. Sophisticated takes on ethnic food. Unconventional cocktails. Calculated atmosphere. But that's not to put it down. The menu, while quite short, emphasizes small, satisfying plates that go well with one of their micheladas or a margarita. You'll definitely pay over $10 a person to fill yourself, so I don't know about ""cheap eats,"" but each menu item I tasted was well put together and highly tasty.

We waited four hours to be seated. Every single table had been seated since our four hours began. They finished their food 45 minutes to an hour and finished their drinks at least two hours into it. They were just sitting and lollygagging. I think that it is rude to the establishment and other patrons to hog seats. The establishment loses business if people decide to leave and eat elsewhere while these customers, who have completed their meals, just hog seats. The customer should not have to wait that long.

He even had me sign a piece of paper to verify my signature on the ID, along with a lot of other vague random questions.

My group and I waited an hour for a table around 6:00 on a Saturday night- before the dinner rush. I tried an al pastor and de panza taco, which were extremely fresh and flavorful. The pineapples in the tacos were a nice touch, the guac was rock solid, and the prices were excellent. The horchata was pretty thick for my tastes, but maybe it is more authentic? I need an horchata snob/connoisseur to help me out here...or someone from Mexico. I prefer the horchata with the consistency of water, but overall a great find. It is near the intersection of Damen/North/Milwaukee- aka the nexus of the universe, so don't bother driving out here. There is so much going on in the streets from hipsters on their bikes, mopeds, dogs, joggers, burnouts- it reminds me of that video game, Paperboy. Remember that one?

The meat is so crunchy, yet tender - how is that possible(?) & topped with the most delicious toppings. The lamb taco was ok. It was very gamy, which I didn't like. I probably wouldn't order this again. The beans took forever - I think our waitress forgot them - & we almost asked her not to bother, but man am I glad we did. The bean, bacon, poblano pepper, garlic, and onion combination was the absolute best way to end our dinner. I ate the beans plain while Ryan loaded it onto corn tortillas.

The queso fundito was good, but when is a glob of melted cheese not good?  As for the tacos, for starters, they are cheap. 2 or 3 bucks each and that's including tax. My favorites are the Pastor (Pork Shoulder and Pineapple) and the Relano (Cheese and Peppers, somewhat spicy). Two very different tastes, but both have plenty of flavor. I don't `usually like the idea of pineapple being thrown in to the mix of most entrees, but with the Pastor tacos they accent the grilled onions and spices used for the pork shoulder so well its hard not love them.  The Pork Belly taco is my next favorite. Totally different taste than the Pastor, the pastor is sweet while the Pork Belly is more salty. It's pretty good, but I just prefer the Pastor over it. Most of my friends disagree with me and like the Belly more. The final taco is the Borrega (lamb), the lamb taco just didn't do it for me. Was it good? I mean it was ok, but compared to the other 3, it just can't hang. You can end up waiting a long time to get a seat at Big Star, so if you can, I advise using the takeout window.

Therefore, unlike many of the reviewers of these places, I don't torture myself and show up at 7 on a Saturday and expect to leave satisfied.  I met my best pals at 3:45 on a Wednesday. Hello?! No wait. Pushed two tables together outside, dove into some salsa and guac. I'm knocked up, so I was hindered when it came to the margarita chugging. (Though I did have a chelada. All you pregnancy police can suck it.) My two friends that had previously been to Big Star ordered a pitcher of their house margs, but with mezcal instead of tequila. I had a little sip and yowzer, they are not F-ing around. The booze and beer prices are reasonable, even bordering on cheap, especially considering the neighborhood. If you're like me and my friends and despise those syrupy, calorie-laden, hangover-inducing margaritas at other places, this is your salvation. Just hooch, lime, and ice.  Ok, the tacos. I could only have two after the guac, so I went with the pastor and the chicken tostada. Both a solid B+. I was concerned with the one lonely corn tortilla holding up my pork, but it held together beautifully. The pork was nice and juicy and I liked the pineapple. (That was not such a hit with a few other diners. They deemed it a little ""too sweet."") Hubby went for all four tacos. I had a bite of each. I think if I had to pick them in order of yummy, it would be 1. poblano 2. pastor 3. lamb 4. pork belly. This could just be because I'm pregnant and my taste buds change daily, but I think a whole pork belly taco seems a tad rich, even for me, though the flavor was clean and it was cooked perfectly.  I think Big Star is a solid 3 1/2 stars, if you go at the appropriate time for your level of tolerance to crowds and douche bags and faux-hipsters. Cheap eats and even cheaper booze.

Only had drinks this time.  Great selection of booze plus, the $3 whisky shots are a great idea.  I like the classy ice cubes too.  They're the big, solid cubes where you only need one or two for your beverage.   Interior, love the fact it's an old garage...at least I'm pretty sure it was or they designed it to look just like one.  Big garage doors open up to reveal the patio in front.  High ceilings, huge horseshoe bar, lots of space for people to sit or stand behind the chairs against the wall, dim, simple lights all around, it's a great vibe.  People-wise, between late 20s to 40.  So all around, just my style and can't wait to go back!",0.9879,0.805,0.195,0.0,0.4960419866871479

The drinks are fun, tasty and perfect for sitting outside.   The service on the other hand is brutal.  The other reviews are right when they say that there is always a long wait to be seated and they tell you they have no idea how long it will be.  Once we were seated, our server came around to take food and drink orders and that was about it.  It seemed like they understaffed the patio area on purpose just to make the place seem busier.  I would have had another drink or two, but it was hard enough to get the server to bring the bill (I could literally see and hear 5 groups around us compaining that the waitress had disappeared).  The taco stand section wasn't much better.  It was a 20 minute wait for them to prepare and give us our 4 tacos, chips and guac, and 2 bottles of water.

I went back the other day with another friend who had not tried it because of the line situation.  Despite the fact that we literally seemed to be melting, she & I put our names on the list.  This was around 6:30 PM on a Wednesday.  I gave my phone number & was told to check back.  I was told that I could not get any guesstimate time-wise because this is a bar where people drink.  Okay, 40-year-old looking mom, we get it.  We'll check back. We tried to look for a cool place to wait in the neighborhood, but just basically walked around for a half an hour & sweated a lot.  Our names were still on the list.  We spoke to the gentleman on the patio who just explained that they would call us. We left again &  walked over to Rodan for a glass of something cool.  After we'd just gotten our drinks, 40-year-old-hostess from Big Star calls & asks if we are waiting outside.  I say that we just checked back in & were told to come back.  I say that we have just ordered drinks elsewhere & request to be bumped back on the list. 40-year-old-hostess tells me that they do not take reservations from people who are not at the restaurant.  I say that we were told to check back in & did & were told that it would still take some time.  She tells me that if we aren't there now, they are giving the table away & that if we would like to wait for another table, we need to come back & sign up again. Call me crazy, but we followed their rules & just wound up walking back to the restaurant twice over the course of a steamy summer evening, only to find that we really just should not have left in the first place.

Anyway it was my first time so I grabbed a menu and sat down to plan my attack.  Simple menu..looked like something you would find on your windshield.  Dont get me wrong; I love simple menus.  It usually means theyre doing it right and spend more attention on what they offer.   Also, no substitutions..which means they want you to experience it the way they intended.   So I tried the Al Pastor, De Berrego, and De Panza.  Which was 3 out of 4 taco choices.  I forget the 4th choice but I know it had no meat so why waste time.  $2-3 a piece.  They were all gone within minutes.  I was starving at this point and they were good but not great.  I guess I'll give it another go around to make sure.   Oh yeah..I almost forgot to mention they have a sign posted: 20 TACO MAXIMUM ORDER really? wow..I mean I love to play piggy but there really is a better way to max out with 60bucks",0.8689,0.78,0.128,0.092,0.49843857832988264

The food is pretty good.  I tried one of each taco because I am a pig.  The pork belly taco was great, the pastor was good, and the lamb was weird.  I'd heard good things about it but the meat in my taco was both dry and had unpleasant pieces of fat in it.  The chips & guacamole are poorly portioned - way too many chips, not enough guacamole.  Either give fewer chips or a larger cup of guac.  $6 is a lot to charge for a few tablespoons of avocado mash.  The drinks are pretty tasty - I had a Paloma and a chelada.   Service is weird. Not bad, just very weird.  The blonde bartender seemed miles away in her head. Perhaps she was dreaming about a sale at Urban Outfitters, who knows. I think she was an alien. I saw a really drunk girl wobbling at the bar at 5 pm and several men wearing sweatbands ironically, so its good for people-watching. I had a good laugh at the male host outside.  The lady host was sweet but this guy was cooler than school and made sure you knew it.  When I asked about how long of a wait it would be his answer was and I quote ""Well we're not a 'typical restaurant', so our waiting system isn't something, you know, we can't just predict that.""  And he sneered an actual sneer.  Yeah OK dude, you're awesome, I get it. In the middle of our dinner it began pouring and hailing in freak summer storm.  Half the patio patrons ran inside and the staff closed the doors, leaving the other half of us still outside trying in vain to stay dry under the patio umbrellas.  After a few minutes there's only so much you can do so we just let ourselves get wet.  A waitress brought out 2 pitchers of beer and let us keep it for free.  So we got that going for us.  Which is nice.  The rain stopped in 10 minutes and we left soon after.

I tried the al pastor taco which was made with pineapples and a sweet sauce (almost like a sweet and sour sauce).  The meat itself was really good but I'm kind of borderline with the sauce.  The chicken tostada was REALLY good. Crisp green lettuce (with none of the hard white pieces), tasty pieces of chicken, yummy beans and a crisp tostada.  Prices were a little on the expensive side considering how much they give you but not by that much more than your average tacqueria ($2 per taco, $3 per tostada).  However, prices for the drinks were pretty steep - $3 for a Mexican soda??  Overall, nothing special about the food here but if you are looking for a place to drink and hang out with friends, this place has great outdoor seating and decent tacos.",0.9956,0.685,0.284,0.03,0.5705988455988455

Instead, I can go to a place with mediocre food and eat along side people that push strollers that are the size of a Pontiac. At this point in time, I've now visited thrice. The first two visits were only for drinks and snacks. This time, dinner. I ordered a pitcher of Schlitz, a pork belly taco, a lamb taco, an order of guacamole, and a side of refried pinto beans. Here goes: I've never gone anywhere in the Americas that serves soft corn tortilla tacos that only uses one tortilla. I'm pretty sure that they cost roughly one penny each which is why even in the poorest of lands, they double up. People won't complain about soggy tacos if ya'll stick to tradition. The meats were all perfectly tender and juicy, but the spice was lacking to a point that it was just boring to eat.  The poor service didn't particularly bother me due to my permanently relaxed nature, but I will mention a few things about it. Our guacamole didn't come out until I had asked when it would arrive. Then I would later find that when I asked, I was charged for a second order. Also, it was around 90 degrees outside and we were never offered water. The business model is actually rather genius. Build a massive bar and force people stand near it while they wait. And make sure that it's cash only. We wouldn't want people to realize how much money they've wasted while waiting for an hour or two. Then seat them, take an order, walk away and repeat.

My friend I went with is very pregnant so she was compassionate to her wait. After we waited about 40 minutes and could see that the tables were not opening up that quickly, we decided to go to the carry out window and eat at the picnic tables that are on the other side. The menu is the same and since we weren't drinking any alcohol, we figured why not. WELL....as sweet as the hostess was on the restaurant side, the order taker was rude...and I mean RUDE!! I would use another word but I don't want this review to get flagged. I have never in all my years experienced someone like that. We placed our order and waited quite some time for our food. We ordered 3 fish tacos, 1 pastor, 1 panza and a quac with chips. The order comes in a bag and when we unloaded it we were missing the pastor. I went to the window with the receipt and told the RUDE girl that we were missing our pastor. She looks at me and says, where's your order, I need to see it. I said it's all out on the table and they were seriously arguing with me that I was not missing anything from the order. I had to bag it up and bring it to them to see that it was missing. The guy that puts the orders together tells me it's all there. Seriously!!! It's not there and you are arguing with me?  It's a $ 3.00 taco!!  After I again showed him the receipt and the order, he agreed it was missing and made a new one. The fish tacos both my friend and I did not like, the panza was OK but the pastor and the quac were delicious.

2010-07-12,2.0,"OK Chicago Hipsters. If you are too cool for school and you really want to go out and be seen this is the place.  Brought to us from the same folks behind Avec, Blackbird and the Publican.  Taking over the old Pontiac Cafe location, this place does have great tacos. Personally I think the best bet is to order from the carry out window cause you will get the same great food and not have to put up with the snobbish negativity that consumes the rest of this place.  The GOOD- Pork lovers beware - this place has awesome pork belly tacos. The meat is so soft and tasty with just some simple toppings. I also am a huge fan of their grilled bass tostada. It is fresh and tasty. The fish is nicely seasoned and the avocado balances it nicely. The tostada can be a bit messy though, so be careful with it. The Guacamole is tasty with a strong hint of lime.       They do offer a great whiskey selection with a decent $3 shot of the night that allows one to sample some lesser known spirits. For those that don't drink they have real ginger beer and some lesser known Mexican sodas. The Tex - Mex theme works well and they play classic country music that encourages the drinking of those fine whiskeys or cold beer. On a nice day the out door seating is prime people watching and can be one of the best patios in the city.  THE BAD- The service here is down right bad. While they are pleasant, they are either over worked or could basically careless. They tend to be slow and they can be a bit pushy when they do arrive. We had one server really push the queso fundido on us, even though some of the group was vegetarian and it contains globs of chorizo. It is not a dish I recommend for eating outside either. Once the cheese cools it turns to a oily rubbery mess.  The Ugly- In this case it is the ugly truth that this place wants to create a scene. They will make you wait in line to get in. You will stand on Damen, and be there to showcase that this is a desirable place to be. Remember you do want to be seen - right? It does not matter that the rest of your party is inside. You can get loud and complain, flaunt you assets, or list who you know, but you will wait. They will also make you wait for a table once you are in.  It does not matter that there are four empty tables and a six foot high stack of chairs, you will wait. They will clear the tables at a ridiculously slow pace, and still leave them open with people eying them both outside in line and inside at the bar. Once you have done your time waiting you will be graced with a small table. If you order the chips there is a good chance that they will be stale and or soggy. I have had the chance fresh basket that was good, but that has been more of a rarity. You will order delicious tacos and drink tasty whiskey, and you will look out and watch all those lesser than you that are now waiting. You have made it to the cool kids party now.   While this restaurant does offer good food the way it goes about creating an elitist trendy vibe sucks. After all we are talking about whiskey and tacos here.

My initial reaction seeing the place was I loved the concept and the minimalist design brilliant from a business standpoint. Teh attractive hostess greeted us at the door with a friendly smile. The music was very honky tonk which I didn't like but it went with the whole theme so I get it. The server was attentive to our every need, but they all looked like they came out of an episode of LA INK...The ""euro bus boy/bouncer"" was hovering over the table uncomfortably  waiting for any shred of paper and staring it was a very uncomfortably annoying. The food was conceptually well but all of the meat was dry and overcooked. Strictly from a food standpoint I was not impressed at all. More attention needs to be made to the detail of the food no doubt. I loved the tortillas, the guacemole, and the salsa verde was good. Out of the two that was the best. I can see for individuals who are looking for a great place to drink, and the food as an after thought this is a solid place, but I expected the food to deliver and it fell short.

First off, I am from Texas, so I like the vibe, and by vibe I mean the one that the staff is trying for, the music, the feel, not the people that actually frequent the place.  The food: Good, ok pretty damn good, its a little pricey but worth it I believe it is worth it.  The drinks: I love whiskey, so we are all good there.  The Service: My god it is awful.  Now, to preface this, I have worked in restaurants and bars before. I am not demanding and I know how things are. Also, I don't come here when there is a line down the block or when it is bat shit crazy. I like to go out on off nights and would usually prefer not to be in the midst of what that place can be say on a Friday at 8 pm.  If a place is packed to the gills, I expect that things will take a while.  So, the first time I tried the food there were four of us, two of us had never eaten here and the other couple had only been once before since at this point it was only open for a few weeks. We all ordered three different tacos, wanting to try everything out. Our waitperson wrote nothing down. Not a big deal, I used to wait tables and I told myself the menu isn't that big, maybe she is a badass.  It took a while, but I knew they had just opened and there are always kinks when a place is first getting started, no biggie.  When we got our food mine was the only order that was correct. Again no biggie, but they never took the plates away from the other three and then it took about another 30 mins to get the right order.  Maybe our wait staff should have written it down, but it was being made right.  When it came time to pay, the waitress asked us if we had eaten the three wrong tacos, we told her we had and then she said ""cool, I will go ahead and charge you for them""   Now, I am not cheap, we paid for everything and tipped, however I would never charge a customer for something that was my mistake.  We didn't pick up the wrong order, it was brought to us.  Not to mention that getting a drink is never quick at the bar, even on a slow night with three bartenders and a bar back and maybe 20 people.  There have been several times that I would have liked another beer, but due to the fact that I have been waiting for 15-20 mins between them, while sitting at the bar, I just cut my losses and go elsewhere.

2010-07-07,4.0,"All right. So after reading scathing review after scathing review directed at the main restaurant, I had to put my foot down. Though I have yet to dine at the main restaurant (and judging by the constant slew of quasi-hipsters and general douche-baggery filtering in and out, I don't really intend to), I have to shine a spotlight on the real unsung hero of this establishment: the take-out window next door. First of all, let me say that those brave souls manning the window put up with a lot of bullsh*t. If I had to deal with long lines of drunken yahoos for hours every night, I would go insane. So props to the window staff, they do their best to keep things moving efficiently among the chaos and still manage to keep relatively cool.  Second, I don't think I've ever had better tacos in my life. I don't live anywhere near Wicker Park without having to make an at least 40-minute trek to get there, but I will come solely for those mouth-watering Al Pastor tacos. The reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 is the consistency of quality among the menu items. I've had other things from the menu, and though good, they just don't quite match up. If everything on the menu were as good as the Al Pastor Tacos, I would be there every single day.

I'm glad we went, the food is good and the drinks are fantastic. Like most people have already noted, I'd go to Big Star for the drinks/atmosphere first with the added bonus of tasty food. The prices for individual servings are reasonable ($2-3 per taco), most people I know need a few of those to feel satisfied. The bill can quickly go from cheap night out to standard Chicago bar and food establishment. Not that I felt there was poor value, just a slightly contrary opinion to what's out there. As for what we actually ate, my small snack included the Tacos De Borrego (marinated, braised lamb shoulder with radish, roasted scallions and queso fresco), and an order of guacamole. I really liked the guac, lots of avo chunks and nice spices. The taco was tasty and a little messy. The radish is a nice touch that I wouldn't think to add to a taco. I was dissapointed with the ""salsa"" or sauce, as well as the hot sauce provided. Neither of the sauce options had any flavor or spice, so you're stuck with what you get. It should not be too hard to find some good and spicy red sauce to make available to customers. I forget what I ordered to drink, but I do remember my first choice of Buffalo Trace Bourbon and Root-beer was not available. All the drinks are delicious and reasonably priced.

2010-06-30,3.0,"This is a review only for the walk-up window (yelp probably ought to split the reviews by seating area for this place).  I was going to give it two stars, but decided to go with three stars because the tacos are good, and the people-watching is excellent.  But ... I'm glad I went, and I had a great time hanging out with friends, but I'm really uncertain why this place has unusually good buzz. Yes, the flavors in the tacos are good, I'm not saying they're not good tacos.  But as a whole experience, I don't see the point. Maybe I'm getting old a crotchety, but seriously: $3 for one taco?  Why do people think this is cheap?  Isn't that twice as much as most authentic walk-up taco places?  Isn't that more than just about any other walk-up taco place?  Three tacos and one soda for $12. I can't think of a time I've ever paid more than half that for 3 tacos and a drink at a walk-up place before.  Sure, places like de cero charge more ($3.95) - but they're not a walk-up place: at de cero you're guaranteed a seat and they bring the tacos to you. And then for your over-priced tacos you get to wait a ridiculously long time - I've gotten fresh risotto in real Italian places faster than these tacos take. So, if your friends want to go to the walk-up window  to hang out and people-watch, by all means go and hang out with them and people-watch.  Just don't expect to be shockingly wowed by the food if you've eaten at any decent, authentic Mexican places, do expect to wait a long time to get the food, and do expect to pay about twice as much as you would for authentic tacos at many of the other hundreds of taquerias around town.",0.9945,0.793,0.172,0.035,0.5466329966329966

WAY TOO DAMN LOUD. last time i was there i very gently asked the bartender if she could possibly turn the music down a tad since i couldn't hear the guy i was flirting with and i'd actually blown my voice out last time i was there, yelling at my date. there are absolutely no soft edges in this space to absorb the music. i don't have a problem with the kind of music, but they don't EQ it to handle the space. as such, it's loud, tinny, full of high-end and shreds your ears. i guess if you're a deaf hipster, maybe you don't care, but if you want to keep hearing till you get old, bring a pair of earplugs to this joint.  * service is dicey. i get it that the guys at the front checking IDs (and also at the violet hour) has to deal with a lot of douche-bags. hell, i have to muscle my way past them to get to this part of the crotch, but do you have to be such an asshole and look down your nose at EVERYONE? i sat there one night with a friend, waiting to order a taco while my buddy finished his drink. the bartender didn't bother to ask if i wanted anything till my buddy was done with his drink, even though he walked by me about 12 times. by then i was ready for a different bar.",-0.2769,0.83,0.093,0.077,0.5186745503818675

For drinks, I highly recommend getting the Chilada, which is a can of beer with lime and salt - for $4, this can't be beat.

Great selection of whiskeys, bourbons, and southern beers too.  Here is my recommendation:  Instead of waiting for a table (which can take a while), just go to the ""take-out window"" and order some food directly from the kitchen.  Same prices, same food, and comes out even faster.  You MUST order the chips and salsa/guacamole.

If you're looking for a place to watch the beautifully bourgeois of Wicker Park in full hipster splendor, this might be your shangri-la.  If however, you're looking for a Mexican meal that approximates the flavors and abundance of authentic cuisine, I suggest literally any other restaurant you can find.  On a Thursday evening I found the staff to be immensely snobby about the prospect of seating me. I was carded before they let me put my name down on a table, even though my stated purpose was dinner. The hostess graciously allowed me to put my name down with only a cluck of her tongue and we waited (and waited).  While we didn't expect immediate seating with no reservations, I didn't expect to be treated like a pest to my hostess, who after calling me for my table, told me I didn't have enough in my party to take our seats.  She told me I was lucky that none of the other parties of 5 had shown up, because if my party arrived I could then sit down. Not a few moments later the remainder of my party arrived. When I approached the hostess stand, she gave me the dreaded no-look  ""just one second"" finger so that she could continue her apparently delightful conversation with another employee.  After we were seated, we waited about 20 minutes just for the waitress to pull menus out of the bench next to us. Another long wait for the drink order, and another one for the main order, they must be advocates of the slow food movement. The atmosphere can be charitably described as immensely loud, I'm not sure Glenn Beck could be heard over the blaring music, but I might prefer his voice to the audiological assault of music. The chips were really great, as were the roasted pork belly tacos. Both nailed their mark, but at 3 dollars for chips with no salsa but those at our table, and 3 dollars per taco, it was more like expensive tapas than a true Mexican meal.   However, nothing else about this place justified the high price and generally intolerable dining experience.  I am of the opinion that any establishment should act as though they welcome each patron and the business they bring. I am told that this place specifically employs a smug attitude to give the appearance of exclusivity, which is also used in other establishments run by the same proprietors.  My thoughts on the matter are, if someone wants to pay significantly higher prices for Mexican food that has but some of the flavor and none of the spirit, then by all means, it's a free country.  For my part, I think the drinks are small, the cheer is smaller, and the only thing in abundance here is the soulless elitism that is slowly gentrifying the city we love into a Disnified version of itself.",0.9898,0.846,0.114,0.039,0.5046135265700483

2010-06-14,4.0,"This hipster taco hotspot has a lot to offer, but Big Star can be a Big Pain if you're not prepared. A few things you should know before you go: 1. There is both patio and indoor seating. If you go during busy times there will be a wait - so, potentially you could wait to get through the front gate, then wait again for a booth when you actually get inside. In that case, it's probably best to just saddle up to the bar. No umbrellas on the patio, so bring your sunglasses. The patio was pretty empty when we arrived, and we still waited between 5-10 for a server to approach us. For me, that was okay because I was nursing a hangover and soaking up the sun, but if you're impatient I can see how your irritation factor would be high. 2. The tacos are amazing. When your menu is that small, you should nail it - and they do. Perfect tortillas that somehow repel getting super soggy, perfectly seasoned guac, and their homemade salsas pack a punch. However, you will wait a while for service. If you're in a hurry and want tacos only (no drinks), go to the pickup window.  3. Cash only. Oh, and the horchata? Bliss. The next time I'm in the hood, I'll be hanging on the patio with a marg in hand.",0.9848,0.759,0.17,0.071,0.5328333333333334

I can strut and preen outside and impress all the other monkeys with my CLOTHES and my ATTITUDE - have, like an addled swarm of snotty, dimwitted locusts, stripped it of almost everything that was tolerable. 4.  But since the owners are no doubt making bank from the locust swarms of d-bags, I'm sure they're not in the least concerned. 5  Somebody on staff really likes ""Pacific Ocean Blue.""

I knew that the place would be packed and the wait would be long.  Our group of six including a 7 months pregnant friend waited for about a half hour for a table. We had some drinks one side of the bar where other hungry people were waiting to be sat. I couldn't get over how gigantic the bar was. Did it really need to be that big? I kept on thinking how on earth are they going to accomodate diners in the wintertime with less than 5 booths inside!  After waiting, we snagged an inside table and poured over the menu. Our group selected chips and guac and various tortas and tacos. The pork belly taco was pretty good as was the fish torta. Overall, the food was good, but slow to come out. We had to get more chips because we damaged the first one upon arrival and needed more to finish off the guac.  Our service was alright, just slow going with the massive crowds. Big Star on a Saturday means a slow dinner whether you want to or not. Overall, food was alright and tasty. The service was fine as well. I guess I'm just not a big fan of a la carte tacos with fancy fillings. For me, it's just another case of someone trying to make street food high-end and hipster.

They were teensy tacos and I could have easily eaten two more. If I were really famished, I think 5-6 would do nicely.  It gets packed but we didn't have a problem getting seats at the bar.

2010-05-12,4.0,"I""m surprised people haven't figured this out yet, but when a restaurant is as crowded as big star servers do not have the time to attend to every little need a table has. Also given the sheer volume of patrons big star deals with, your food might take a little longer than it would at a normal restaurant. its called patience people, and having some makes life  a lot easier.  Having said that, I will move on to the important stuff: the food. basically big star is a one of a kind in the city, and they nail the vast majority of their menu items perfectly. The queso fundido is to die for, the braised lamb tacos are extremely addicting, and the radish-topped guacamole is superb.  As far as drinks are concerned big star has also achieved great success. there margaritas are excellent and real (no disgusting sweet and sour mix) their micheladas are some of the best in the city, the tequila selection is of superior quality, and the whiskey selection  can compete with the likes of any other whiskey bar in chi-town. remember though if you do not like crowds, or you are an impatient up-tight yuppie, do not go to big star. You will only become frustrated and annoyed which will make your server hate you and your experience will suffer because of it.

The salad came with a little too much dressing for my taste but a lot of people like it that way. My fault for not ordering on the side. The salad was huge and enough for three people. The fish on the tostada pescado was fresh and not fried. Pork belly taco was juicy and delicious. You can totally fill up for cheap at Big Star. $1.00 7 oz. beer? Unheard of.

There are a few who rock (Gina) but for the most part you must plan your orders and order ahead of time IF you can get their attention. Sorry Big Star...

2010-05-08,4.0,"When rumors got out last summer that the dynamic duo of Terry Alexander (Violet Hour, Danny's) and Donnie Madia (Blackbird, Avec) were taking over the old Pontiac Grill expectations were high.   The Pontiac had always had a couple of good things going for it, a to-die-for location on the corner of the park and a funky old gas station chic that passers-by found irresistible.  Long a summertime staple for al fresco imbibing beneath a snappy orange and white awning, the Ponitac's patio was jammed from May to September.   But like a butterfly that reveals itself on closer inspection to be an ugly black worm, the Pontiac was a dismal disappointment in execution, the food (such as it was) was awful, the service was deplorable, the attitude was snippy, and the drink selection was a joke.  Watching it shut down brought an odd mixture of regret and schadenfreude.   But then word got out that Alexander and Madia were taking over.  Score!  Two of Chicago's most successful drinking and dining impresarios would be taking over Wicker Park's choicest location.  Who could ask for more? Well, the verdict is in.  Big Star shines. The Alexander/Madia playbook is on full display here: the soft opening, the anonymous presentation, the friendly, down-to-earth service, the amazing drink selection, and the terrific food.  Working a Texas roadhouse theme with grace and subtlety, Big Star burnishes those qualities that make a good honky-tonk shine while never crossing the line into parody.  Chef Paul Kahan's menu of mouthwateringly delicious tacos and tostadas are the perfect accompaniment to a cold bottle of Lone Star and the vinyl strains of Patsy Cline, Lefty Frizzel and Waylon Jennings.     While the cash only policy may take you aback at first, it's nothing if not authentic and it helps to keep the prices down.  And that's one of the most remarkable things about Big Star.  The prices here are Texas roadhouse prices, not Wicker Park prices, meaning that a taco costs $3 and a bottle of Blatz will set you back a whopping two smackers.  You can walk away from a night here for less than $20.  The result has been a minor sensation.  From day one, there have been long waits for tables or a seat at the bar, particularly between 7pm and 9pm, and most especially on the weekends.  But if you can manage to score a seat at the giant pine wood wrap-around bar, you are in for a treat.   Big Star doesn't trade in flat screens or blaring noise, the main draw is conversation, between strangers, at the bar, underscored by country music records adjusted to a perfect volume (enough so you can hear them, but not so much that you have to shout over them).   Sporting a stripped-down look (the concrete floor and exposed light bulbs recall a cinder block dive on the outskirts of Lubbock) and sans the usual ornamental overkill, about the only thing you can do here is drink and eat and talk, which may be why the crowd is mostly made up of bright thirty-somethings with the intelligence and confidence to hold a decent conversation. And while you're talking you can have a quality drink. Big Star is all about the bourbon.  Under Terry Alexander's expert guidance, Big Star offers 20 quality bourbons from the Buffalo Trace Distillery, 9 from Heaven Hill, and 4 more from Old Forester.  In addition, they offer 6 ryes, 2 whiskeys and 25 tequilas.  Already Pontiac is a distant memory.  And if you want beer - which the old Pontiac regularly ran out of - Big Star offers 25 American and Mexican varieties in bottles and cans, as well as five on draft, and they never run out.  Big Star has taken one of Wicker Park's biggest disappointments and made it shine, good food, good drinks and down-to-earth companionability, the best qualities of a genuine Texas roadhouse.   We'll have another round.",0.9919,0.853,0.108,0.038,0.44700910200910204
2010-05-06,4.0,"Took a random day off of work yesterday and decided to celebrate by traversing down Damen Avenue to a spot I've been eyeing for quite some time now...Big Star (I suppose the ""suspense"" of the ellipsis was unnecessary considering you already knew what restaurant I was reviewing...) On first glance walking past Damen and North I wondered if I had somehow passed it...I assumed it would be a large establishment sitting in one of the many connected buildings down that stretch. As I ventured further the landscape opened up and what appeared before me seemed to be some sort of hipster oasis. Flannel shirts, over sized sun glasses, ironic trucker hats, and asymmetrical haircuts converging in a short fenced play pen in front of what looked like a haphazardly renovated auto shop.  The ""door guy"", in this case a young woman with aviator sunglasses so big that I could easily see the confusion on my face regarding the nature of her position in the reflection, asked for my I.D. and then told me there'd be a wait...""I'll find a seat at the bar"" I said, and she nodded in approval. As I walked into the restaurant area I gained more respect for the establishment, as the the interior bar had that blonde wood that I'm finding more and more in new establishments across the city (think all of the Pony Inn and Duchamp...what I refer to as ""Norwegian Wood""). Lots of natural light coming in as the entrance ways are two large glass garage doors and there are rows of bubbled ""moon roofs"" that scale across the ceiling. I sat down for a drink amongst the crowded bar and took a gander at the menu. Cheap...the place is cheap. It's not taco stand cheap, but I don't think anyone should go in there expecting $1 tacos with free chips and salsa. You're getting quality ingredients with innovative pairings. Pork belly tacos? Yes please...El pastor with pineapple? Don't mind if I do. The size and price of items here allow for a diversified meal that is filling without being too filling, and won't murder your wallet. While my experience at Paul Kahn's other restaurant The Publican was amazingly epic, it was so in a different way as I left comatose and broke. This is the ying to Publican's yang in my opinion, and it's a welcome change to my common strategy of valuing food by its weight.  Whiskey and beer selections are pretty standard, with the whiskey selection being a little more defined IMHO. My choice for that afternoon? $1 7oz pours of Schlitz...when a cold beer sounds great with a taco but too much will inevitably lead to an ill conceived afternoon nap, this offering allows you to refresh yourself without the burden of finishing a beer just so you don't waste it. Best surprise of the day...no tax. $11 worth of food is $11 and not $12.10. I know it's not much, but in the highest sales taxed region in the country the ""tax included"" policy is a brownie point waiting to happen. All in all I think this is a place that at times takes itself too seriously...but the location, food, price and concept are well worth what will probably be an ever growing line.

(there are many people waiting for service and not that many servers). if you're in a hurry, or really hungry, go someplace else. if you have no time constraints, are looking for a fun atmosphere with awesome music, just want to chill for a while with a hip crowd and eventually eat amazing, amazing tacos, this place is a must. the pork belly tacos - to die for. the fish tostada - ditto.  although, you really can't go wrong with any of it.  i know this seems like a kind of negative review, but i just wanted to be upfront with what you'll experience. it's really a great place and i want for everyone that goes there to enjoy it as much as i do. which is why i felt it necessary to point out some obstacles you will probably encounter.  bottom line - go there and eat your face off. but don't expect to be pampered.  p.s. its cash only.",0.9925,0.752,0.193,0.056,0.625173611111111
2010-04-27,4.0,"So I ended up spending many hours here last Sunday, and I have to say I kind of love this place. The $3 Tecates flowed endlessly and I totally dug everything I ate, fish tostada, pork belly tacos, guacamole, frijoles, but especially the lamb tacos. Those tender morsels of lamb served with extra braising sauce was enough to melt my heart...YUM. I also love the record player tunes and sort of industrial chic decor. What I didn't love was the service. For the first bit that we were there our waitress was fairly attentive and quick with the orders, but soon she had to leave, and with the shift change came some of the worst service I have ever received in a restaurant or bar. The waitress was never to be found, and never once stopped by to check on us without flagging her down. Many drink orders were forgotten and we ended up just going to the bar...the worst though was not once but twice we ordered different items from the menu, and after 15-20 minutes of waiting finally flagged her down to inquire, both times ""oh oops i totally forgot"" FAIL. I also do not appreciate that after we paid our tab and left her a decent, but definitely not great tip, she found time to keep walking by our table and give us dirty looks as we were finishing. Um yeah, if you had found the time to come by that often earlier it probably would have worked out better for you in the end. That aside I totally dig this place and will definitely be back, hopefully next time to take advantage of the massive patio, and try the rest of the small but totally awesome menu.",0.8714,0.773,0.13,0.097,0.5769841269841269

My friend and I went to meet his friends who were hanging out in the patio area on a warm and breezy evening a few weeks ago. There was actually a line to get into the patio on a Wednesday night. We tried to by-pass the line since we had a group of 5 already waiting, but the man with the clicker in his hand insisted that we get in line. So begrudgingly we got in line...luckily, we were only in it for 5 minutes. The lively crowd consisted of an eclectic mix of scenesters, hipsters, and your run of the mill cubs t-shirt donning frat boy types. I hardly saw the interior of the restaurant since we decided to forfeit our table and just snagged a small table out on the patio. My friend and I got two of each tacos - they were all excellent. I think the pork belly tacos and roasted vegetable tacos were my favorite. Someone in our group got the queso fundido which was just cheesy goodness.   Two highlights of the evening were the $1 6oz glasses of Schlitz. I think our table went through several dozen of those. And Paul Kahan busing tables and going for the most part, completely unnoticed. What a humble guy! All in all, a good, cheap night out.

You know by now that Big Star is not trying, by any stretch of the imagination, to be an authentic taco joint. This bothers a lot of people for some reason. I don't know why. From any street corner in Chicago, you can throw a rock and hit at least 3 other ""authentic"" Mexican places, all of which serve up the same greasy, thrown-together food with ingredients of questionable origin. Who needs another one of those?  Yes, Big Star is taking creative liberties. I mean, lamb in a taco??? Sacrilege, maybe. But it's fucking delicious. And it is ever-so-consciously served with a braising sauce that is just like icing on a cake. I'd like to see somebody eat it in one bite. They're retarded. It takes at least 3, but I prefer to stretch it out to 4 or 5 because the flavor is better savored. Stop being such a fat kid and maybe ENJOY the exquisite food that you obviously very seldom experience. I love their use of the radish. It shows up in many items and perfectly compliments the food. Great idea. I have tried almost everything on the menu and I have to say that the pork tacos are my least favorite. They're just too greasy for me, but isn't that the whole point of the Al Pastor? The alcohol selection is impressive if you're a bourbon or tequila drinker. Which I am. The tequila is as expected, but the bourbon selection caught me off guard. This is one of those creative liberties I was talking about. Bourbon is not typically paired with Mexican cuisine (or many cuisines at all for that matter), yet they stock a shit ton of very very good bourbon. I think the owners just have a hard-on for it. They just said ""fuck it"" and opened a Texas-themed bourbon bar that sells pre-prohibition era cocktails and serves quasi-gourmet tacos that the chef dreamed up while tripping mushrooms. Or maybe it was the fumes from all that white paint on the walls.  Regardless, kudos to their bourbon ""Shot Of The Day,"" which changes daily, for $3. Also to Tecate cans for $3. Also to no extra sales tax being charged. The price on the menu is actually the price you pay. That should be enough to shut the pie holes of all the Trust Fund babies complaining about the cash-only policy. There's an ATM right across the street for God's sake.  One other important point has been mentioned here before, but deserves re-addressing: the 7oz Schlitz draft is ONE DOLLAR. This is the only $1 beer that I am aware of in the entire city of Chicago, especially being offered all day every day. But here's the glitch: the 12oz version of the same beer is $3. It doesn't take a genius to figure out the bad math in this pricing strategy. The only advantage I can see to ordering the 12oz is not having to stand in line at the bar as often. I wonder how dirty of a look you would get from the bartender if you ordered three 7oz glasses of Schlitz. For the same money, you would get 21oz of beer. This is still blowing my mind as I sit here thinking about it. I will definitely be back. Probably tomorrow. Maybe the day after that. I'll take a day off, then I might go in the next day. But that might be too close to the weekend. So I'll just wait until Monday rolls around again. Yee Fucking Haw!",0.9951,0.796,0.132,0.072,0.5156478748524203

Excellent drink selection, excellent drink prices. The food looks and smells great. I will say as a pescatarian my options are quite limited, but whatever.

The salsa verde is too tangy and not spicy enough for my liking. The salsa roja has a strong chipotle flavor but lacking any spice so the smoky flavor ends up being overbearing.  IMO The food tasted great, but not worth dishing out $18 for two tacos, two tostadas, chips and guac + $2 tip.

So here's what you do.  For a booth (party must be greater than 4), you put your name down on a very long list.  The chances of you getting a table are probably slim, though if you do get it, it is very nice and rather spacious and much more comfortable (We got one after our 2nd group of eaters came).  Otherwise, you hover behind someone at the bar until they relinquish their bar stools, whereupon you order everything from the bartender, leaving your id to identify your cash-only bill.  Because of the occupancy rules the wait for a barstool isn't really that long or unpleasant; if you get stuck outside in the cold, though I could see how it would be annoying. The guacamole was great, even better than Adobo Grill or Las Palmas.  We sampled 4 different kinds of tacos, but the al pastor were easily in a different league than the rest.  The $1 7oz schlitz is an easy first drink as you make up your mind.  Our bill for a couple beers, 16 tacos and 2 sets of chips was only $78.  Awesome.",0.9755,0.802,0.136,0.062,0.6035912698412699

2010-02-22,4.0,"I'd been to Big Star a few times, but held off reviewing, because I'd only ever imbibed the alcohol there. Finally, this weekend I waded into the great debate that are the tacos there. So, to start off, I'm a huge fan of the Schlitz. This is for many reasons. a) It's nice and crisp and goes down easy. b) The bad math associated around the Schlitz initially boggled my mind. Why would I buy 12 oz for $3, when I could just buy three 7 oz for $3? But now I think it's a masterpiece. It functions like google goggles. If the people you're with order the 12 oz, both you and big star instantly realize they're horribly, on-the-verge-on-alcohol-poisoning drunk, and you take them home. Right? That must be it. Otherwise it makes no sense. The micheladas are great as well, but I always have to reach for the tobasco sauce for some more spice, but hey, that's just me. And so, finally, to the tacos. It's really something else to be told that you get *one* taco for three bucks. You're like, haha, sure, it must be a monster taco. Nope. They're frigging delicious, I'll tell you that. Amazing. Goes down in one bite. But that's exactly the problem. It's over too soon! And if you're even remotely hungry, and especially if you've drinking and are ravenously hungry, you're going to wolf down 5-6 tacos, and where does that leave you? Working the streets for cash, that's what. So, in conclusion, I love your setup, Big Star. I watched them turn that nondescript little garage into you from the Damen Blue line stop every day for months. I was so excited to see you open. I dig your beer. I dig your bartenders. I dig the way your tacos taste. I do not, however, like their price. So I'll give you 3.5 stars and round it to a 4. Cya sometime again this weekend.",0.9951,0.747,0.192,0.06,0.5624895572263993

I think its fantastic that you can get a wild west drink that'll put a little hair on your nipples for only $7.  To clarify, the liquor to mix ratio is strongly in the customer's favor.  Sasparilla Springs is my number one and its a tie between the HUD and the Black Cherry Fizz for number two.  When you add some Johnny Cash on top of it I am soaring in heaven.  If I was just reviewing this as a bar, I'd probably give it a 4, however its become just as much of a dinner place with the popularity of the bar food. The drinks are consistently fantastic but the food quality varies night to night.  I always get guacamole, a chicken tostada and a fish tostada and it tastes different every time.  Never as good as the first week they opened.  Except the poblano taco.  That was never good, unless you like eating snot. There is no way to beat the rush, but go on a week night if its your first time.  Its worth it to wait for one of the tables and get a server to balance out the crowd- keep in mind you have to have a party of 3 or more to qualify.  Have a snack before you go, get a sasparilla spring if you like bourbon or a san antonio sling if you don't.  Get the queso fundido and a taco or two, but save the rest of your moola for booze and you will have a fantastic night.",0.9911,0.839,0.153,0.008,0.5245245559038663

Second off, we didn't have time to sample the food menu - which I hear is delectable - so my rating and review are only based on drinks, service and atmosphere. So let's go in order. The drinks were great. They had a small handful of great beers on tap (Goose Island's new Green Line Pale Ale, a Californian IPA, etc.) and economical-to-average for the now trendy WP area ($4 for a 12  oz. pour). I hear they have great whiskey pours, but alas, no time to try. Service was eh. Typical hipster wait staff, so it was hard to tell if they were purposely trying to not care to look cool or they were just lazy. I never had an empty glass, so I guess I can't complain. Atmosphere was cool, I'll give it that. They had great honky tonk music playing from an old turn table - good touch. The lights were extremely dim, which is cool, and the place carried over the 'I'm-drinking-in-an-old-mechanic-shop' feel that started with the ol' Pontiac. Overall, cool place to chill and have a happy hour drink - and bonus that it wasn't retardedly busy. Would I come back for drinks or food... eh, maybe.

Normally I would like to try the Violet Hour, but not when I've been up since 4am and kinda don't want to be out soooooo we jumped out of line and went here (its across the street). I still was not exactly happy about being out at this point.  Ambience - Walking in the door I exchange some joke with a person I might call a 40 year old hipster (also known as a MFA). This at least picks up my spirits, as does my friend informing me that they make tacos here. I like this idea. Inside was pretty packed, but considering there was no line I was able to find a place to sit and the crowd was really pretty subdued, diverse and friendly (a patron left his seat for my friend and I to sit together - we were 2 guys, so it wasn't  chivalrous so much as nice). The place was fairly full so I won't say the bartenders were particularly slow, and when I ordered food it was pretty much in my lap by the time I turned around. And they play classic country - does anything else go with bourbon so well? If you have been to Harry's Country Club in Kansas City and liked it, think along those lines. Drinks - I didn't bother with any of the foofy drinks. Miller Lite and a list of bourbon that will make you drool are the only things I really need when it comes down to it. I had a double of Four Roses Single Barrel. Awesome. The bartender came over and discussed the distillery with us because he liked this decision, which led to not only some nice bourbon knowledge, but a free taste of the Four Roses Special Edition (woweeeee), which was nice. Suffice to say I was feeling good after backing all that with some beers. The double was a good sized portion of bourbon, no complaints on that.  Food - After heading a little north of sober I was told to have a pork belly taco. Awesomeness for $3? Sold. Perfect thing to add to a belly full of bourbon with a little bit of grease, crunchiness, and some cheese all in the mix here.  As the night progressed I ended up having another one and also tried the tacos al carbon - this was even better than the pork belly.

I do like the lamb taco's, they are actually VERY good and the Queso Fondito is OK.. but I don't know how people are calling this cheap???? The tacos are TINY and expensive!!!! Not much bigger around than a beer can.. I need to eat about 8-10 of them to get anything out of it.. at $3 a pop that ain't cheap! Maybe if you had the apetite of a squirrel it would be cheap.. Eating just 1 or 2 of these won't even make a dent in your apetite if you are a normal male.. so figure that into the cost. Also, Cash only.. which sucks.. I think its just a scam to hit u up with the extra ATM fee's which happen to be conveniently located right next to the door. I won't eat there anymore the portion sizes are just too small for the price.. Its basically like getting a tortilla chip with some meat and dip on it for $3. You can literally eat it in one bite.  I may stop in for a LoneStar but thats about it. I was going to go 2 stars for the lousy service but the food actually is pretty good.. just way overpriced for the size.",-0.858,0.849,0.063,0.088,0.5368398268398268

The only caveat is that I wish the tortillas used in the tacos were maybe a half inch bigger around, to capture the meat better... though it might overwhelm the texture and seasoning so I defer to the expertise of the chef. One of the more amazing things, and so simple in retrospect is the use of pineapple in the al pastor. It just explodes with taste as a result! It should be criminal to offer al pastor without the option of pineapple or possibly mango. Just tiny amounts, dry and chopped... but still.  The Lamb shoulder is something amazing, it melts and the au jus is superb. I wish they offered a plate of this with rice and beans.  Ah the bar. Best Old Fashioned I've had outside of Louisville. The proportions are all spot-on. I can't remember the other bourbon cocktails i've had here, but they were damn good too.

2010-02-04,5.0,"After once writing that ""the Publican is the reason I joined Yelp"", some people might think this is a Paul Kahan-biased review(er).  The fact is, I just like when food tastes good, is interesting and fits the craving I'm having at that moment.  Now, I am an enormous fan of bars and restaurants that have square bars.  Plus, while walking down Damen on my way to Big Star, I quickly remembered that it is one of only a handful of bars that is serving the new, sustainably brewed and distributed, Green Line Pale Ale from Goose Island.  So, when you put these two factors together, I was immediately impressed with the bar aspect of the spot.  Good country music adds to the - something Chicagoans should relate to - rustic feel inside.  We found an open spot by a corner and got a $4 Green Line quickly.   With the space full and there being no sign of letting up, we decided to order from the bar and take our meal home.   We ordered a bunch of food to share: four Al Pastor tacos, one tostada de pollo and a lamb shoulder taco.  We also ordered chips and guacamole, naturally.  All of the food was delicious, some of the best tacos I've eaten outside of my cousin's destination wedding in Mexico.  Crisp pork in the al pastor was a good complement to the more tender, shredded lamb.  While we ordered a chicken tostada, we were given a tostada de basa.  It wasn't a big deal, actually an interesting white fish. While $3 for a taco is a bit much, its not surprising given its quality, fresh ingredients.   The radishes chopped into the guacamole were the perfect touch - something I think I'll ""borrow"" from Kahan's recipe book.  A full bag of chips (Chipotle take notice), fresh limes and quick service at the bar made this a regular stop for the future. Total bill for 5 tacos, 1 tostada, chips/guacamole, 2 Green Lines and a bar tip = $30. Food and drinks for $15/each?

I had read some Yelps that led me to believe that you get 2 tacos w/each order...this is not true...every item on the menu is just one single thing.  So each taco is like $2-3 and tostada like $3-4.  I had 4 things plus chips and salsa, a marg and a beer, and my tab was like $25 with tax and tip!  VERY reasonable.  Also like the walk-up taco window outside...was able to grab some goodies to take back for my bf to try.  He was impressed as well. The only reason BS isn't getting 4 stars is because of the restaurant itself...i don't like how it's laid out, there's not enough room to enjoy your food, there's no semblance of any kind of order, it's pretty much to each his own...so if you don't feel up to battling w/strangers over barstools and counter space, do NOT go here!  The food was good, but not outstanding enough for me to really care to go back, due to the struggle to get comfortable.  I wouldn't mind going back for some drinks though!",0.9884,0.729,0.18,0.09,0.548030888030888

2010-01-30,4.0,"The Pontiac Cafe was a staple of my Chicago existence. As my stay here draws to its timely close, some friends and I decided to stop into Big Star and see what it's all about. At first I walked into this place and saw 3 dollar tacos. THE ""S"" AT THE END IS MISLEADING. It is 3 dollar tacO. Singular. One. That's it. Three bucks for a taco. Which is fine, what am I - from logan square? (Ukrainian Village snobbery at it's finest) I have no problems dropping a few extra bucks on food, as long as it's worth it. Now if you haven't gathered by now, I love mexican food. I basically dream in frijoles (I sleep in a tub of frijoles), so my expectations, as always, were high. We had the lamb and pork belly tacos. They were small, but packed a ton of flavor. The three salsas were magnificent and the queso had so many flavor qualities I just wanted to deconstruct the entire dish.  I would be descriptive of the food, but here's where big star failed me. I arrived in a group of three.  You have to be in a group of four to get a table, otherwise you are fighting with all the other ham and eggers trying to get a stool.  This. Sucks. Seriously, I REMEMBER the pontiac cafe like it was an image of my blurry, drunk, shaky right hand. I could have SWORN there was more space. They used to do live band karaoke there! YOU CANT DO LIVE BAND KARAOKE HERE. It's a real bummer because I would have loved to sit, drink some beers, listen to the country music and eat al la carte for hours. I plan on doing this too, as soon as I can con three of my friends to come with me. The service is funky but it didn't bother me, but I could see how it would bother people though. You don't really have a server. It's just a carousel of mexican food and beers flowing in a counterclockwise circle. Like I said, that's bound to bother some people, but to me,  a carousel of mexican food and beer sounds like the greatest thing ever.

My thing is...I'm a big spender, I bet you my party of 2 ordered more than your party of 4. Second, the crowd in there sucks.

The seating situation at Big Star brought out all of my bad girl tendencies. Never before has a restaurant tested my need for an orderly lifestyle.  Upon entering what can only be described as a complete clusterfuck was happening in Big Star.  Because most of the seating is around the massive square bar located smack in the middle of the restaurant with a few stray booths reserved for parties of 4 or more, there's no waiting list for prime bar real estate.  You have to uncomfortably hover around the folks eating at the bar, pray they finish quickly, dive-bomb their seats as soon as they leave and hope some bitch doesn't cut you for a much sought after bar stool.  It makes me tuck away all my nice girl tendencies, roll up my sleeves and get ready to tackle another chick wearing stilettos... and I'll do it because I've been working out AND I'm usually wearing flats.

Cons:  Slightly inconvenient.  You can't just pop in here and expect to have a table.  You gotta come mentally prepared/in a laid back mood and know you will wait (indefinitely) for a perch, and you will be squished.  It is ALWAYS packed, in a sardines kind of way.  They have booths, but unless you're 4 or more people, you can't have one.  But you can wait for a seat at the bar.  Honestly, I care not.  I think it's kind of part of the experience.  This place rocks.  So, you grab a beer from the bar, and post up against the wall (there's a shelf around one side of the restaurant with hooks underneath for your coats/bags, so you can hang there and order food while you wait for a perch).  Good beer menu, and the food is STUPIDLY good, and it's even more stupidly reasonable - like, $2 or $3 per plate.  My friend and I went last week, each had 3 beers, and split a guac/chips app (delightful lime-y tortilla chips, and homemade guac), and 2 dishes (two rounds of tacos - both of which made me weak at the knees), and I think it was $35.  Giddy up.",0.9838,0.752,0.178,0.07,0.5496666666666666

Upon pondering some ideas of places to go for an early dinner/late lunch/medium sized snack I had a brilliant idea hit me: Big Star. I love tacos. I have time free when they open. I can eat. Trifecta! I wondered over just before 4pm, staff was having their final evening meeting so I shivered and waiting outside. Ahhh, it was fine, I could email in peace.  Upon entering you feel you are at more of a bar than a taco place, good reason since the drink menu is twenty times the size of the food menu. Sadly, since I was returning to work, food was only on my mind, a drink or three will have to wait for another day.  The bartender was nice, friendly and helpful with the few questions I had. As I sipped my lime aid, (tasty and refreshing even on a chilly winter day), I pondered the menu. I knew the tacos weren't huge, but I decided to go for three and tostada and start there. I am sure if I needed more, I could go for another round. IF I liked them.  One lamb, chicken and al pastor taco and a chicken tostada please. Oh, serrano chilies? Yes, please. I needs to warm myself up! Shortly after about five minutes, out popped the food and damn, small.  Well for me small. Like three bites small. But some wonderful things are in those three bites. The lamb braised in a spicy broth, lovely and flavorful. The toppings a slight overwhelming, but really when blended well in a good size mouthful, it just presents heaven on a tortilla. The al pastor was good, the pineapple I have had with it before, but really it helped to balance the heat from my serrano laden taco. Superb. The chicken, although what many would considered ordinary, was quite a distance from it and neither was the chicken tostada. Loved every bite. In fact had to go for another round of three tacos. Yes, the if can go away, I liked them. Honestly I could have had a few more rounds of everything. More of the tacos, more of the tostadas, try some of the queso fundido. Seriously, I know I have an appetite but I didn't want to seem that hungry.  Also, look and ask about the specials. A regular had gotten a treat, who shared some with me, plantain fries. Loaded.  Plantains. Love. *Swoon* But the nice thing is, its fairly cheap. Tacos are $2 to $3 each, tostadas are not much more. The drinks will cost you, but when you see the selection of the drinks, it may make you giddy to the point of seeing things.

Big Star is popular for good reason.  The food is really good and it's a quintessential ""hip"" spot to sit outside, drink and eat tacos in Wicker Park.   I myself usually skip the wait and go to the take-out window.  They provide picnic tables for take-out seating or you can just take your food across the street to the park.  If it weren't for the taco window I probably wouldn't eat there too often just due to the wait, so I'm happy that they offer the alternative for those of us who just want to eat with out the scene.

We did have to wait in a fake line in the cold (only for a couple minutes) but once inside enjoyed plenty of space. Everyone had a great time - the beer was cheap and the Micheladas (sp?) were awesome. It's one of their specialties: Tecate mixed with a house blend of spices to form a very original, spicy beer. Lined with salt and served with lime. A+ We camped out near the little kitchen window, and it's certainly too bad I didn't come more hungry. The little tacos and other dishes waltzing by looked (and SMELLED) delicous. Several friends ordered 1 or 2 and were very happy. I'm going back here with a group of girlfriends to eat this weekend and I'm really looking forward to it. Let's hope they don't make us stand in line, that's just cruel in the Chicago winter... PS.

Their drink menu is about 8 pages long with many bourbon/whiskey based drinks to choose from as well as a section for tequila lovers (that's me!). Unique and carefully crafted, their drink menu rivals Violet Hour in terms of quality and creativity.  The food menu is tiny, with maybe 10 items but everything is to-die-for, which is an adjective I use sparingly. I've had each taco on their menu (the pork belly is by far my favorite) as well as the fish tostada, the guacamole and their queso, which was described by a friend as having ""layers of flavor that just don't stop."" The food pairs well with the drink offerings and the quality is top notch. In terms of the setting: The space is small and the focus is on the large bar situated in the middle of the room. Large groups will either have to stand or wait for one of the 5 booths. Both times I've been I've put my name on the list and been seated within an hour, which seems like a long time but it flew by as I enjoyed drinks and conversation with my friends.

2010-01-02,2.0,"Salsa in squeeze bottles and a bar made of laminate flooring. That pretty much sums up the vibe in this misdirected taco joint. When you realize that this is the same team behind the fantastic Violet Hour, you lament what could have been. First of all, it's cash only. It's 2010 and I'm not riding in a rogue taxicab. Get with the plastic already. Find another way to pick-up the exorbitant $3 ATM fees.  The drinks are actually not all that bad. Some strange flavor combinations, but overall not too bad. The draft beer selections could use some serious infusion of small craft and latin beers. Enough with the Schlitz and PBR bullshit. On to the squeeze bottles. The three salsas that are available are sitting around the bar in old six-pack carriers. Still not sure why I get charged $2 for someone to slide one of these containers within my reach. None of them is really that remarkable. They're just satisfactory. The handcrafted aspect of these is lost by being packaged in cheap squeeze bottles. The guacamole isn't too bad, though it could use a bit of lime and salt. Accompanying chips are fresh and crisp, but also lacking in salt. (Interestingly, when asked for salt, the bartender returned with a cocktail napkin rolled up with sodium magic. Were salt shakers outside of the budget?) To be honest, we only tried one taco, the pork belly. Pretty good flavor, but not really discernible as truly succulent pork belly. It could have been a fat hunk of garden variety Oscar Mayer. Not impressed. The real missed opportunity was the atmosphere. During our 45 minute stay, the only tunes to be had were d-list mariachi songs cranked out from a turntable. For the love of God. You've gone so far as to associate the name of the place with Texas and create this Austin roadside vibe. Why in the hell wouldn't you embrace the vibrant music scene, i.e., South by Southwest? Ditch this overdone hipster crap; make the sounds enjoyable. A good jukebox would go a LONG way to improving this situation. So, would I go back?

Ambiance:  Not so much in terms of decor, but I don't think that's what they were going for. Personally I love hole-in-the-wall Mexican places where I constantly test my gastric mucosa against the likes of Escherichia coli, Campylobacter and other enterohemorrhagic gastroenteritis-causing organisms (ahem - La Pasadita...mmm). Although I fully realize that ""Paul Kahan"" and ""hole-in-the-wall"" go together about as well as chocolate ice cream and mustard; Alaskan beauty queens and New York liberals; Stephen Hawking and the X-games; me drinking and texting....oh well.  Space: About 80% of the interior is occupied by the bar. There are only 4 booths for parties of 4+. So if you are rolling  less than 4 deep, it's every man, woman, child and hobbit for themselves. This is REALLY annoying. Hopefully come summertime, there will be much more outdoor seating.  Food: We started with the ""Salsa"" which we soon found out were chips that came with 3 bottled salsas that you get anyway with your food - (i.e not traditional pico de gallo). The chips were OK - I could have done without.   OK, yes the tacos are good. And this is coming from someone who isn't that huge a fan of pork (Please keep reading!! I apologize to my bro-in-law and to Kevin from last season of Top Chef). I had the tacos Al Pastor, Lamb, Pork shoulder and the Chicken tostada.  The Al Pastor was my favorite - lots of subtle flavor. Just the right amount of topping. The lamb was also great - the sauce is what did it for me. And I thought the pork shoulder matched well with the pineapple. The tostada was so-so. My buddies also had the Rajas de poblano tacos, which they said were their favorite. (But I couldn't try theirs as each taco is literally 2 bites. Yes, I understand that small tacos with few toppings are authentic).  Drinks: They have a great selection of Tequila and Bourbon here. You can't really beat $1 baby-Schlitz either.  Price: BE WARY!! You may think that this place is cheap after looking at the $2 and $3 tacos. But, if you are like me and can eat more than your average-sized doormouse, you will inevitably end up ordering 5-7 tacos, which adds up when you're drinking.  And cash only?? - wtf? Summary: An OK place. More of a scene than eatery. It will probably be fun in the summer when they open up outdoor seating, but inevitably the lines will be long and annoying. Go for a snack and not a meal, and keep your parties to 3 peeps or less. As for the food - stick with the tacos.  My suggestion - go down the street to La Pasadita. You'll save a buck, and get even more authentic food. Although you'll sacrifice the Citizens of Humanity-wearing crowd for Cubs hats and wife beaters.

First hurdle: There is an entrance, but it's unmarked and you will drive/walk past it several times before you figure out that the drab, grey garage is actually the place raved about in the New York Times. OK, you've made it inside. Next hurdle: It's a restaurant, but you have to sit around a bar. Wait, there are tables, but oh, you can't sit in them unless you have a larger party. Oh wait, small parties can sit in them, but only if it's after a certain hour. Alright, you've decided you can deal with sitting at the bar. Hurdle #3: There is a host, but oh wait, they won't seat you, they'll just explain that you have to hover around the people eating at the bar until someone gives up their seat. And there's no priority system, so you either have to watch your fellow hover-ers like a hawk, or stake your claim to an area and pray they leave as soon as they're done eating.  Hurdle #4: Cash only. Obnoxious, considering this is not a Mom-n-Pop kind of place that can't afford a credit card machine. Final hurdle: The servers don't write down your order. I cannot fathom why places do this. Especially at a place like this, where the menu encourages you to order a lot of small items. It inevitably leads to a screw up, which is exactly what happened. We ended up getting two of something we only wanted one of, and none of something else. There is a very easy fix for this: FUCKING WRITE IT DOWN. If you can get past the foregoing barriers to enjoyment, you will probably find that you like Big Star. A lot. For one very good reason: The tacos are tasty little bastards. Fresh tortillas, piled high with delicious carnitas, pescado, pork belly, ect. Add in just the right amount of guac, cilantro, and/or pico. And, most critically, a lime wedge. Top them off with one of the three salsas set at each station. Yum. And they will run you about $3/apiece. Three to four makes a meal. Big Star also has a great beer selection, and by great I mean cheap and served with limes. Sip it while taking in the converted garage decor, and by decor, I mean the light fixtures above the bar. Sparse, but awesome. Despite the excellent food and drink, I can't give Big Star more than three stars due to the aforementioned set up issues.

That includes all 4 types of tacos, the beans, the queso fundido, the guac, all three salsas. Damn delicious. Their beer list is great, and everything is priced well. Two negatives though, dropping them a whole star: 1) Seating sucks. First come first served is just awkward. You stand waiting for people to finish eating in hopes that they're going to get up from their stools. And there's no space to stand that's not just milling about in the aisle, so it gets doubly weird.  2) $3.00 for an ATM at a cash restaurant. Seriously? I may be wrong, but the restaurant has the ability to set the ATM fee at whatever they want and they chose an unnecessarily high price, while having a cash only place. Really uncool.

2009-12-07,3.0,"Sandwiched between shooting pool at Bob Inn and shooting blanks at a Wicker-Park-dance-club-that-shall-not-be-named, Jenny R and I rolled up in here on a recent Friday night. We knew a little sumtin sumtin was goin' down in this heezey when Jenny spotted some goats chained to a dumpster behind this dig. Jenny was all, ""Oh, they're so adorable! Can we pet them?"" and I was all, ""I ain't pettin' no goats, they'll eat my Ed Hardy shirt."" Jenny immediately wreckanized how important my Ed Hardy shirt was to me, so we walked in. It was fairly crowded, and we were fortunate enough to just barely snag a booth. I was all, ""Look! Those booth-sitting patrons are leaving!"" and Jenny was all, ""Ohmigosh, those other two people not wearing Ed Hardy shirts are making a mad dash for it."" So we took several minutes to devise a plan on how we could get to the table before them. Unfortunately, the time it took to plan our move created a problem: those two people not wearing Ed Hardy shirts had already sat down. They were that fast. But screw that. We went ahead with our plan anyway. Palms up, I locked my fingers together and bent my knees. Jenny planted her boot into my hands and I sprung up with all my might. Jenny did at least three 360s, two-and-a-half twists, and a double fakie ollie before landing squarely in the seat at the booth we wished to claim. Seriously, this was some mad trapeze-artist sh!t. Those two people not wearing Ed Hardy shirts were in such awe of Jenny's skillz, that they immediately offered us the table. Then they saw me walk over wearing an Ed Hardy shirt and they changed their minds. But Jenny begged them to let us sit there and they finally caved...thirty minutes later. After they finished their food, drank their beer, and belched in my face because they were jealous of my Ed Hardy shirt. At this point, you can only imagine how starved we were. The waitress ran through the menu quickly, since she was obviously eager to serve people not wearing Ed Hardy shirts, and mentioned ""goat."" Uh, yeah, she said ""goat."" As you might guess, right about then, the flash light in my brain went off, and I was all, ""Holy crap. I totally forgot that today was Passover."" Then the waitress looked at me like I was an idiot or something just because I know my Canadian holidays. But whatevs. I ordered the goat tacos to honor our country's upstairs neighbors, and Jenny went with the some-kind-of-fancy-chicken tacos. I can't quite figure out just exactly how they managed to make the goat meat taste so fresh and tender, but diggity dawg damn it was delish. It was the first time I'd ever eaten goat before and I must admit, these alone are enough to bring me back here. Outside of putting that juicy meat in my chops, I was otherwise somewhat indifferent to Big Star. I liked the setup, especially since the high ceilings allowed me to vault Jenny through the air, but it was too damn loud. I couldn't hear a thing Jenny was saying, and not just because I was admiring my Ed Hardy shirt most of the time. Also, the loud music made ordering a beer very challenging. I tried ordering a LaBatt's to go with my Canadian holiday meat treat, but I was brought a Blatz instead. Probably because ""I'll have LaBatts"" sounds a hell of a lot like ""I'll have a Blatz"" when you can't hear someone from three feet away. Who knows though. It might also be because the waitress appreciated my Ed Hardy shirt and figured I was a real classy guy, so she hooked me up with a Blatz in a can. Which subsequently nearly made me vomit. After finishing what might have been the nastiest tasting beer I've ever consumed in my life, I went pee. (In the bathroom.) Then Jenny and I rolled out of this bar like we was Autobots. And wouldn't you know it, one of the goats we noticed when we first arrived had escaped. Jenny, the kind-hearted person she is, nearly wept, hoping the goat didn't get hit by one of those big red tour buses with really obnoxious drunk people in them. So I had to wait while she pet the goats that hadn't escaped. But I didn't get anywhere near them because I didn't want them eating my Ed Hardy shirt.  *Please note, my mind was a bit hazy this night, so some details may have been invented in this review.

2009-12-06,4.0,"I don't venture out this way as often as I'd like to but golly gee am I happy I was here last night. Big Star may just be one of my new favorite places for cheap drinks and quick eats. For now, however, they're only getting 4 stars until they change my three complaints: 1. cash only (who carries cash? plus, I'm waaay more likely to spend tons of money on a tab) 2. ""show"" line outside for no reason whatsoever, other than to appear as exclusive and hip as their sister bar, Violet Hour 3. freezing cold bathroom, almost unbearably cold But other than those three things, which would most def not deter me from returning, I am in love with this place. They have a unique drink selection, their 4 beers on tap being 4 things I've never seen or heard of before, and tons of bourbon and tequila (though not my thing, it may float someone else's liver-killing boat). If you like whiskey, they make a sarsaparilla drink that tastes just like root beer. For me though, the michelada is the ONLY way to go for cocktails. It's a Tecate beer with a salt rimmed glass, lime, and the most orgasmic and flavorful house-made hot sauce. Spicy and salty and DEEEEELISH! Loved loved loved the tacos, especially the pork one with caramelized onions and pineapple. The sweetness from the pineapple gave it such an interesting kick, and the cilantro balanced the dish with a true Mexican flavoring. They're cheap too, at $2/taco considering they make them to order and you can order as little or as many as you'd like in whatever combination you desire (they have about 4 or 5 different tacos to choose from). So to the owners of Big Star - my 5th star awaits you as soon as you let me use my credit card, allow me in the door when I arrive, and put a space heater in that bathroom!",0.9962,0.794,0.184,0.022,0.6291774891774893

The cheese dip (I don't speak spanish and I won't try to spell it out here), was also very good.  Drinks and Bartenders: 9.5/11: Got me drunk enough on fantastic margarita's before I ate, so they must of been good. Also had a drink that I don't remember the name of--it consisted of a shot of tequila, some sort of hot sauce, and a Tecate on the side. I don't know why really, but I kind of liked it.   Service: 6/11: Aside from the bartenders, the actual service staff (i.e.,e.g., hostesses and waiters/waitress) kind of sucked. We got there and really had no clue what to do. The person at the door (more like a bouncer than a hostess) accosted us for our IDs, instead of, maybe, saying hello/welcome or even explaining the layout of the restaurant and our options for eating/drinking/sitting. Eventually, we worked up the courage to ask the little hipster lady at the front (she was most certainly a hipster so, of course, much cooler than us, and in accordance, a little intimidating) who informed us that there was a list, and the rules to get on the list. We finally sat down after sitting at the bar for about an hour (though, it wasn't terrible because, as mentioned above, I gave the drinks and bartenders a good score). Our waitress eventually came, and in essence, it just felt that they were doing a sloppy job.

2009-12-04,4.0,"Okay so I went to Big Star last night and really liked it... here's a break down: First off, as the guy at the door said, Big Star is really more of a bar than a restaurant. This means that to go you have to be 21+ like at any normal bar. They have limited table space - only 6 tables - and will only put groups of four or more at a table. Any smaller group can grab seats at the bar as they free up. Because it's more of a bar, people tend to stay at tables longer than at a restaurant, and if the tables are all full up, it can be anyone's guess as to when a group will leave. No reservations. With that in mind.... Food: 5 stars. PORK BELLY TACOS ARE NOW MY FAVORITE FOOD. Okay, they are seriously good. The place also has pork shoulder tacos with pineapple, lamb tacos, and roasted poblano pepper tacos. They have a selection of tostadas and salads as well, but I didn't try those. Good tortilla chips and salsa. Drinks: 5 stars. Good selection of micro-brewed beer, good array of liquors of cocktail making. Also have limeade and horchata. Service: 4 1/2 stars. Door people and waitress were both really friendly (I think ours was named Daniella??), but the crowds can make it sometimes take a little while. Space: 4 stars. If you have a group of 4+ and can manage to swing a booth, it's a nice amount of room. Sitting at the bar looked as though it would be crowded, due to the fact that the bar is in the center of the room and there isn't much space to walk between the bar and the booths. Atmosphere: 4 stars. Music is kind of loud, but it's what you would expect in any hipster-ish bar. Crowd is an eclectic mix, trending mid-to-late 20s. Other: 3 1/2 stars. Okay, so the fact that there's a wait and the wait can't easily be quantified (as mentioned above) is kind of a bummer, but if you go in aware of this it's easier to deal with. We got there shortly after 10pm on a Thursday and waited maybe 20 minutes for a booth - but your mileage may vary.",0.936,0.866,0.087,0.047,0.5350020350020349

So we asked to be seated only to be told brusquely tables were only for parties of four or more and if we wanted to eat we'd have to wait for seats at the bar to  open up.

I had high hopes for this place since I like the owners' other endeavors ... but this venture seems deeply flawed. It's touted as a laid-back no-frills joint, but in fact the staff has been nothing other than condescending and the number of rules and managerial missteps sort of kill that whole ""laid-back"" thing.

Definitely do not leave without trying the three salsas -- they are already at the table, and all you have to do is order chips to go with them (though if you order the guac, it comes with more than enough chips to serve for salsa as well) - there is a red salsa, a salsa verde, and a very spicy, but deliciously complex salsa.

2009-11-16,2.0,"I hate to knock a restaurant when the food is good, but in all honesty my experience here was completely ruined by an extremely poor floor plan (of all things!!).   We arrived around 6:30 pm on a Monday hoping to avoid the horrible crowds and the 1 hour + wait.  Our plan worked well as the hostess told us it would be just a 15 min wait when we arrived.  She recommended we hang out along the wall and grab a drink while we waited.  This is when things went horribly wrong.  We bellied up to the bar and ordered a Green Flash IPA and mint julep.  Shockingly the bartenders replies ""sorry we're all out of the mint julep.""  I almost fell over backwards... YOU'RE OUT OF THE MINT JULEP??? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  Last time I checked there were only three ingredients in a mint julep: water, bourbon, and mint (well, and a little sugar).  I guess Chicago is experiencing some severe mint shortage.  On top of that our bartender poured me the wrong beer, the Lagunitas pilsner instead of the IPA.   I didn't think things could get any worse until some guy total rails into me with his shoulder after standing up quickly from his bar stool (recall me mentioning the poor floor plan).  He apologized, but this unfortunate event could have been easily avoided if they had put at least another 2 feet between the bar and the south side wall.  I mean, I understand making the bar seat as many people as possible, but there is barely enough space for patrons to stand while the servers are constantly running through the aisle.  In fact I should call the Chicago fire marshall in to inspect this issue!  So basically if you stand here, you are constantly getting bumped into on a regular basis by the servers trying to get through.  This can get annoying very fast. After our hostess told us the bar was now a free for all, we moved to the other side to avoid the full contact football and to grab some seats from a party that was about to leave.  We weren't there for more than 3 minutes when I got bumped into again. Twice!  Last I checked they were playing country music here, not R. Kelly...I don't see nothing wrong (Wrong) with a little bit of bump and grind. After ranting about the horrible floor plan and wondering who the idiot they hired to design the bar and interior was, I have almost no energy left to review the only good part - the food.  We ordered all four of the tacos (the braised goat with dipping sauce was awesome, so was the Tacos Al Pastor topped with delicious grilled pineapple).  The guacamole was the best thing ever and served with heaps of homemade chips.  The fish taco, and the frioles - loved the frioles, but could live without the fish taco.  The food was solid, not great, but very good.  At $2-3 per taco I think it's reasonably priced, but not a bargain as others have suggested. Bottom line is Big Star is not worth waiting over and our for a seat at the bar.  If you're into the trendiness of the scene and are making an evening of it, I guess that's alright, but if you've come here for some good bourbon or whiskey, and an opportunity to enjoy your food, you might be in for a rude awakening.  You can avoid the aggravation and save yourself 50% by heading down to Division and stuffing yourself with Mexican goodness at La Pasadita.

2009-11-15,4.0,"Went to Big Star last night (a saturday evening). Got there around 7:45ish with a party of 5. Was greeted at the door by a stylish man with great hair and glasses - gave him my name. Was told they don't quote how long it'll take to get a table, but the list ahead of us didn't seem out of control and it was a nice night so went ahead and waited for a booth to open up.  It was pretty crowded inside but we still managed to grab some wall space and order a round of drinks by sending our tallest friend to the bar as to not be ignored. The crowd while we were waiting was pretty mellow. A funny mix of local hipsters and dare i say ""bridge and tunnel"" folks dressed up a bit too fancy for a night of tacos. But even my super cynical scared-of-yuppies boyfriend couldn't complain about the crowd really.  We had to wait about 45 to an hour for a booth to open up (can't remember, but still not an awful wait - i think some people before us got antsy and left) - and the nice man with nice hair (who i think writes down little descriptions of the people in your party because there is no way to shout names over the din of the crowd and the funny country music) came over and showed us our booth. It was a cozy with 5 people in a booth but could have squeezed one more. We ordered a fair amount of food - a few rounds of tacos, chips and guacamole and a few more drinks. I had two pork belly tacos and a fish tostada. The pork belly was out of control. I sort of wanted the waitress to just bring me whatever bucket they had of it waiting in the kitchen. The tacos are a little small... but premium fillings in a freshly made tortilla for $2-4 a piece is a pretty nice deal. The fish tostada was tasty as well - a good char on the fish - and a nice contrast of cabbage/radish/crema on top - but would have preferred it to be a taco because the tortillas are pretty great. Drank a ""La Paloma"" cocktail (which was refreshingly on $7!) that was super tasty.  Some members of our party had the goat tacos - and said they were also way tasty. I'm not that adventurous.  Our waitress was quick and friendly enough. The food came out really fast. And though the crowd grew and shrunk and grew again throughout our meal, we weren't rushed out of our booth - which was a pleasant surprise - being that we had a few parties staring at us from the bar. Perhaps they were staring at our mounds of food, but whatevs.  All in all - the bill came to $73 for dinner and drinks for 5 people! YAY! We were all so full and happy when that bill came and it wasn't a zillion dollars. Just a bit scared now that this place is super close to home - and it looks like there may be some sort of walk-up window in the works... glad i don't take the damen el - i'd have a pork belly taco every day!",0.9991,0.755,0.224,0.021,0.6427350427350428

Now finding a seat is going to be a trick since there doesn't seem to be any type of hostess directing traffic, I'm not sure I'd want to come expecting/needing a table. We found two spots at the bar very quickly. The chips, tacos, and tostadas we had were incredibly delicious (don't believe De Cero compares at all). The food comes out very fast so you certainly could order tacos piecemeal. As a commited bourbon drinker I was also pretty excited when I saw that the had 4 pages of bourbon in their drinkbook. Now of course you get to hear my gripes! The food was absolutely 5 stars but being a cash-only ""restaurant"" is a real pain and the bartender/server was clueless and disinterested at best. I cut a little slack since the place is new but she was pretty confused/flustered by my ordering specific bourbons. I will be back, but not with more than one other person until they get the seating figured out.

2009-11-13,3.0,"Went on Tuesday, their 2nd day open.  Got there around 8:30p and it was pretty packed already.  Luckily we got seats at the bar. There were definitely some hiccups with their operation, it's understandable it was their 2nd day open, they probably didn't expect to be so busy.  But Pontiac's been closed for so long, and people love to try out new places.  Just be forewarned that it'll probably be even busier this weekend, thus expect long waits for food and drink. Drink - It took a long time to flag down a bartender to get our drinks.  And it's not a big bar.  We finally ordered a round, and everyone ordered 2 drinks b/c we didn't know when he'd come around again.  Finally after he took our orders, it took about another 10 min to get drinks.  And it wasn't like he was taking other orders, it just took him that long to make the darn things.  But when they finally arrived, they were pretty good.  There were only 3 bartenders there, even 1 other bartender would have been so much better.  And it was a Tuesday night! Food - Cheap!  and pretty tasty!  They were out of the al pastor tacos, boo.  I got 2 of the pork belly tacos, 1 order of chips & salsa and 1 horchata for the low low price of $10 before tip!  Pork belly was awesome, very soft, not too fatty, but they did need a dash of salt, which they didn't have at the bar and by the time I would have gotten salt, i would have finished my tacos.  It took a long time for the chips & salsa to come out.  But for $2 they give you a huge plate of chips and 3 big squirt bottles of salsa.  My fave was the chunky one, it tasted like pico de gallo, but put through a blender.  Next fave was the green one, it was slightly spicy.  Least fave was the dark red one, I think it had chipotle.  Horchata was just okay, too grainy for me.  But it was a huge cup.  My friend ordered the guacamole, they say they make it fresh, I guess that's why it took 15 min to come out.  It really needed a lot of salt.   Atmosphere - Lots of nicely dressed young people here.  There's a huge bar in the middle, if you're lucky, get a seat anywhere along the bar, just not by the kitchen window! It was the worst place to sit for obvious reasons - too much foot traffic.  The north (?) wall has big booths, the booths were really cool looking, but looked so uncomfortable!  Other than that, it's pretty bare bones in there, very grey and industrial looking. Big Star will definitely be a quick and cheap dinner spot for me in the future, since I only live 1.5 blocks away, but I'd never spend all night here, it's just too cramped.",0.9937,0.825,0.137,0.038,0.5009083481877598

Okay, other than that set back...on with the other awesome stuff.  The drinks!  Hello!  The cocktails are ambitious for a small place like this, but be patient...they are great!  The bourbon selection if rumored to be somewhere near 50 different kinds.  And if you just want to try some new beers or some old cheap standby's, this is the place.

2009-11-12,4.0,"Thank you. Great job.  Honestly, thank you to the owners of this establishment. I think they hit the nail on the head with the combination of a good beer/spirits selection and a simple but very complimentary food menu. Based upon my first experience here this evening I will be visiting again, perhaps within the next few days. I'll start with the only low notes of the evening.  The guac was not my style.  I like it spicy, salty, and with citrus but this batch was pretty average and not to my liking.  Second, it was a little stressful scouting out seats at the bar.  But I do understand, it's a new hot spot, not really feasible to ""reserve"" seats at a bar and it was relatively busy.  No biggie, but thought I'd mention. Ok, on to the good stuff.  The al pastor taco was excellent, they make the tortillas on the spot and to order and it shows.  Flavor was very nice with an unexpected hint of pineapple tossed in.  When I ordered I thought I would not like, but in the end it worked out nicely.  Next, the pork belly taco.  It was awesome.  I know it is no stretch of genius to make pork belly taste good, but seriously it was a great little taco (I say little because they are smaller than the average, but greater in taste).  We also ordered a side of beans and they were also spot on, smoky, peppery, and very good on chips or the supplied tortillas. Service was great, both of our bartenders, Ben and a nice latin girl, provided us with drinks without much delay and were very helpful and friendly. ***I have to get a quick shot in at Pontiac.  I've lived in the area for about 12 yrs now.  Pontiac left me pissed off and feeling ripped off every time I would visit with it's wretched service, bad food, and overall dirty-ass vibe.  I was happy to see it go and even happier to see Big Star take its place.*** Anyways, I think I've made my point clear.  This is a great new business and a nice fit to the neighborhood.  I look forward to visiting regularly.  You should go too, just stay the hell out of my way when I'm chicken-hawking for a stool.  I will cut you.  I repeat, I will cut you.",0.9968,0.68,0.227,0.093,0.5302530162145547

And so the conversation with myself went.  I'm not sure I was totally feeling this place, but I do think the very reasonable prices will keep me coming back. Without booze, you could easily get out of here for like $10 and be pretty full of awesome pork belly or al pastor tacos. Some of the other things we ordered weren't quite as impressive - goat tacos, queso fundido, beans (still not sure why we ordered ""beans"", but there was bacon in it I guess). On a more positive ""tip"", everything we ordered came with excellent house made tortillas. The drink menu is decent and a lot cheaper than the speakeasy across the street. As for the space, I know I'll get over it, but I was initially offended by what they did to the Pontiac. And I didn't even really like the Pontiac. I was just comforted knowing it was there. Not that that makes sense or anything.  The patio fence and fire pit are completely gone. Where the scary, biohazardous-waste-filled bathrooms were, there is now a kitchen enclosed by a window so people outside can see the cooks making tortillas. There is a valet car hiker in the parking lot. There is absolutely no signage. There is a giant bar in the middle of the building, around which food orders are taken and consumed. The entire room is painted white. Yupster infestation is at level 10 - the highest reading I've seen since 2007, when yupster infestation levels were first recorded.
