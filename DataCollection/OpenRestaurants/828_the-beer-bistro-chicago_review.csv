2017-08-16,3.0,"Went here for brunch. The food was adequate, nothing spectacular. The place seemed nearly empty and it took a while to get our food. We weren't in a hurry or anything so we enjoyed their Bloody Mary (one of the best around) and the Rough Morning (a bit sweet but quite tasty). My date ordered the breakfast bowl and she said it was good. I did the simple 3 eggs over easy with sausage. The sausage was not in links like I expected, it was crumbles of bulk sausage. Even though it wasn't what I expected the sausage was tasty. Overall it was just fine. If you're looking for some drinks for a Sunday fun day, with maybe some food on the side, this would be a good option. They only have 3 outdoor tables so unless you get there at the right time, you're probably not going to be able to sit outside; however, they do open up the front of the building and there are several tables inside that feel like you're in the open air.",0.9575,0.816,0.139,0.045,0.4910218253968255
2017-08-11,3.0,"I stopped in here to get a burger and a beer...the menu appears to be standard solid food choices and quite a lot to choose from. I was intrigued by the Carolina Reaper Wings-which when I asked the bartender-she stated that they were ""the spiciest"" of the wing choices..so I decided against that choice. I ordered the Bacon Burger and a Goose Island Matilda. The burgers appeared to be listed as ""Black Angus""; however, upon close inspection when I brought it home as I ordered ""take out"" it looks like a regular patty that you would get off a grill at a company picnic somewhere where the patties are pre-made patties..like Bubba Burgers in a box for example.....the best thing going for it was the pretzel bun and the generous amount of bacon...too bad...sooooo sad I wasted my money on it.",0.5267,0.856,0.084,0.06,0.2728937728937729
2017-07-28,2.0,"This review is solely on the dining part of things. (I realize it's a place called ""Beer Bistro"" so consider my review appropriately.)   It pains me to write this, as it's a nice place. I've met the owner and he seems like a nice guy, and is a local business working to keep local dollars here and employ people. And they've got an impressive beer selection, to be sure.  But I've been in there a few times recently, both to dine in and pick up to-go orders, and the food, which used to be really rock solid, has slid downhill. Last week I picked up a simple to go order, and two things irked me about it. One, I waited 20 minutes for a to-go order, pleasantly, without complaint, and what I got was a bag of cold food. The fries were cold, cold, cold. Seriously, 20 minutes of waiting so you could scrape the bottom of the cold fryer pile for me? WTF? And secondly, the dude who handed it to me all but threw it at me. No eye contact, no words - you know, words, those things that come out of your mouth when you interact with other people, dude. No ""I'm sorry for the wait"" and no simple ""thanks."" A robot would have been more interactive..... I could practically throw a stone at this place from my window, and have tried over the years to both eat in and order to go as much as possible, but it seems like they would really prefer not to have too many to go orders (they haven't enabled them on GrubHub) and after the last few meals, it feels like they just don't give an eff anymore. Guess what, folks? A bajillion places have opened up within a few blocks that actually do give an eff and (((gasp))) act like they actually want our business. So hey, I'll give them my money instead.",0.6003,0.861,0.078,0.061,0.4970789241622576
2017-06-23,1.0,"I am not one to write Yelp reviews but I will make an exception for The Beer Bistro, as I have never been treated with such inhumanity apart from my experience with the employees at this bar. This all began when I left a personal item there that once belonged to someone very important to me and that carries extremely significant sentimental value for me--a handmade, wooden hand fan in a personalized fan case. I realized I had lost it the next day and called The Beer Bistro the minute they opened to confirm it was there so that I could pick it up. The man on the phone immediately knew what I was referring to when I mentioned leaving something behind, as he was able to describe it in further detail than I had provided him myself, so he went to look for it. When he came back, he said that he couldn't find it and that he'd call me back if anything came up, but that he thinks they had thrown it in the trash. I begged him to investigate further and to contact me with whatever he could learn about what happened to my items. I didn't hear back, and upon reflection realized that it would be incredibly strange for a business to throw away items in their lost and found almost immediately after putting them there. So I called back to receive any updates on the status of my fan because at this point I was certain I had left it there, an employee had confirmed that they had it there, and considering the appreciable unlikelihood of it being thrown away, I was hopeful that someone would know where it could be found. Another man picked up the phone and went to look for it with a colleague of his, but again they came back and told me that although it had been seen in their lost and found earlier, they think that it had been thrown away. Again, I affirmed the significance of that personal item and my confusion about the conclusion that it had been thrown away, so I urged that they look into it and call me back once they learned anything new. A week passed and I heard nothing from The Beer Bistro so I decided to call back. At this point, it seemed unlikely I would be getting my items back, but the uncertainty was its own form of pain so I was hoping that they could at least confirm finally that my fan is now irretrievable. A woman picked up and when I asked her about my fan, she had no idea what I was talking about. This was disheartening since I was told that there would be a larger investigation regarding my fan. Regardless, she said that she would look into what I was talking about. A few minutes later a man came on the phone. Before I had a chance to request any more information about my fan, he interrupted me to scold me for calling them every day of the week (not true, as I had only called them twice and both times were on the same day a week prior). He told me that they don't have my fan nor have they ever had my fan, and that I should stop harassing their business. This was a surprise to me because I had been told by several employees a week earlier that my fan had without a doubt been there. When I tried to recount my previous calls where employees told me that it had been seen in The Beer Bistro's lost and found but may have been thrown away, the man I was speaking to told me that those conversations were imagined. He proceeded to insult me for calling them thieves (which I had not done, at all). He said that the suggestion they would throw something away is preposterous, which I agreed with, but then I went on explain to him that I was simply repeating the information that had been relayed to me so if it was inaccurate that was no fault of my own. He called me a liar and accused me of trying to get money out of their business. At this point, his voice was raised and his tone was harsh and I realized that nothing productive would come of this conversation. As he threatened to hang up, I asked simply that he would acknowledge the circumstances of this situation since I was frustrated with having to deal with accusations and insults on top of the loss of a very significant personal item. He responded by saying, ""I'm sorry you left your fan somewhere."" The conversation went on like this until I reached complete exasperation and he hung up on me. My frustration at this point is not merely with the business, which clearly has its own issues in regards to organization and staff training, but with the lack respect that this employee performed on the phone for me. Yes, it is my fault that I left my fan and its case at a bar absent-mindedly. And if I was told definitively that it had been lost or stolen or thrown away, I would have accepted that. But customer service decorum aside, it is simply inexcusable for one human being to treat another human being the way I was treated by that employee of The Beer Bistro.",-0.795,0.783,0.108,0.11,0.39454004329004333

The food is average bar fare, but it's consistently tasty! Their buffalo calamari is one of my favorites! They also have decent wings and quesadillas. I suggest sticking to their appetizers; their entrees have been hit or miss. If you're going to a Hawks game, there's a shuttle that goes straight to the United Center; otherwise, it's a 15-20 minute walk.

It was all tasty and came out in a timely manner. The Bloody Mary was kind of plain, minimal garnishes and not really any spices in it, but not a big deal.  Here's the negative: the service sucked and they charge for EVERYTHING. As in, a side of mayo costs 50 cents extra. I ordered a burger and chose mashed potatoes for my side; however even if I wanted regular french fries, that would also be like $2 EXTRA. Apparently chips are the only side included with your entree. But when our server (Chelsea) offered us our options for sides she asked ""chips, fries, or tots?"" which definitely doesn't convey that there's an up-charge for french fries. My three friends and I sat at the table to chat and catch up for quite awhile after finishing our meals, and not once were we offered a water refill. When it came time to check out, we asked if the bill could be split, which Chelsea said no, they can't do that. So, one of my friends took the time to write out an itemized list of which dishes and drinks should be charged to which card. Chelsea returned and said ""Uh, since you forgot to figure the tax into the prices, it came to an extra $7, so I put it on this card."" We all just stared at each other and couldn't believe this waitress just SCOLDED my friend for not doing her work for her. The fact that she didn't just let us know before running it and check with us which card was ok to put the extra charge on was just ridiculous.

And she kept on calling menu items hers. As if she owned the place. My friend asked her what the soup of the day was. Chelsea said, ""I don't have a soup of the day. I won't have it for awhile"". I asked her if she was the owner. Because clearly she wasn't saying ""I"" unless she was. Note to millennial server, stop using I. Use we and us. You don't own the joint.  -I ordered a cup of tomato bisque to start off. It was really good. The few spoonfuls I had of it. But just a few moments later I got my main entree. I was like, well, so much for having a chance to enjoy the soup.  -I ordered a burger with no bun, cheddar and mushroom cooked medium rare. I emphasized to Chelsea to ask them to make sure it was medium rare. It came out medium well. The fries were also cold. As in cold cold. As if they'd been sitting around for awhile.  -No condiments were on the table or were brought by the server or food runner. I had to go to the bar and ask for some.  -We asked Chelsea if she could split the check by items. There was only two of us. She informed us that she couldn't. Which was fine. So we gave her two credit cards. I pointed out twice which one was mine and which one was my friends, but Chelsea ending up charging the wrong amounts on the wrong cards. I had to go inside and tell her. To be fair, she did apologize.  -Now here is what sent me over the edge and what really instigated a negative review. As me and my friend were sitting on the patio, this totally adorable teeny tiny itty bitty 9 week old cavipoo comes by. Of course myself along with everyone else wants to see this little bundle of adorable. As we were oohing and ahhhing over the bundle of cuteness, the bartender storms out and informs us that it's against health code and that we can't have a dog on the patio. Really???? You seriously want to go there? In the west loop that's filled with dogs and dog lovers? You want to tell a customer, who isn't even the one who owns the dog, who is standing up to just cuddle the bundle of adorable cuteness, that ""it's against health code""? That's the card you want to play. Attention beer bistro. You already have sub par food and awful service. Do you really want to make a customers experience worse by telling them that can't hold a 3 pounds bundle of cuteness that isn't even theirs? Not a good move. Especially I the west loop. I can promise that I'll spread the word to all my dog loving and dog owning friends while I'm out walking my dogs and at the dog parks and at the dog stores in the west loop.

2015-04-03,3.0,"I met a group here for some after work drinks on a night that was apparently also a ""game night."" Two levels, although my group was asked to cash out and leave the lower level once the game had started and the crowd had thinned a bit so I'm not sure both floors are open all the time.  Drinks were good and reasonably priced; I had a dry hard cider ($6) and a strawberry martini ($10). Decent beer and wine list, few other interesting cocktails. The American pub grub-like menu also looked tasty and seemed like a good value. Appetizers under $10, including a baked goat cheese with marinara, pizzas in the $12-$17 range, and burgers and sandwiches for less than $15. My other half and I wanted to try their slider special (order 1 of each and get a free basket of fries or tots), but the waitress informed us they don't mix and match pre-game, which seems to me like it would actually be the BEST time to offer that special, but anyhow...the turkey sandwich I opted for instead was good - chunks of shredded turkey, good amount of meat, apple slices, and a pretzel roll.  We were slightly disappointed in the service. It was busy at first before the game for sure, but it seemed like our waitress couldn't leave the table fast enough after getting a drink order, several times missing that someone on the other side of the table also wanted to order something because she tore off like a bat out of hell the second she heard one beer order, and if you're that busy, asking if anyone else needs anything would be more efficient anyways. We had to rush to inform her we also wanted to order food; she never even asked if we would be eating, even though it was early evening. We had to flag her down for water refills, utensils, she never came by to ask how everything was. Drinks and food came out at an appropriate pace, so the issue was not the bar or kitchen, it was in actually getting to order anything at all. In fact, the only time she stopped longer than ten seconds was to ask us if she could cash us out and move us upstairs, which she followed up with a trip by our new table to make a comment along the lines of us not having found everything ok, seemingly implying to us that she didn't believe she was tipped well enough. Tacky. Don't get me wrong, she got a tip, we didn't spitefully leave a penny or anything, she just didn't provide service that would be worth more than 15%.  The space was nice, food and drink was tasty and affordable, and I'd be willing to give the service a second chance on a non-game night.",0.9913,0.819,0.13,0.051,0.4370579106428164

I tried a variety of sliders (pulled pork, chicken parm, fish, and meatball) and all were very good. They are decent priced as well.  I was there for a birthday party on a Saturday night and our server was not happy to be there. A friend of mine waited over 20 minutes for a beer he ordered while the rest of us got our drinks significantly earlier. I also felt like a child who got yelled at because I asked to try a beer that I didn't realize was bottle only. She could've been a little nicer about it instead of yelling out an ""absolutely NOT!"". I ordered a raspberry beer that cost about $10 for a bottle and I left the bottle on the table w/ my husband while I walked to say hi to a friend, mind you...the bottle was 1/2 full. I came back and the bottle was gone. My husband tried to tell the bar back or whoever that we weren't done with it, but the person wasn't interested. I explained to the server 1/2 of my $10 beer was gone and she offered nothing in return except I'm sorry.  Things like that irk me. I liked the place enough to go back, but service is so huge.

Are you like me and love trying new beers? Well you've met your match. It's the perfect place to let lose mid work week and enjoy a cold brew. Or 2...or 3... The Beer Bistro truly has a great vibe to it. The staff is very down to earth and every time I've been here it's been nothing but great service. High top tables line the walls and they have 5 big flat screen TVs so you can catch the game. The décor includes vintage beer signs and Hawks apparel including a signed jersey! So if you're a hockey fan, you're in luck. This place loves the sport and even has hockey night specials on Jack & coke, Jaeger, Captain and Kettle One. If it's the weekend and you're looking for more of a party scene, the downstairs (or beer cellar) is a great space and you can even rent it out for your own private party! Now of course with all this beer drinking I'm always sure to grab a meal while I'm here. If you're looking to split an appetizer I highly recommend the steak quesadillas. Filled with juicy steak, mozzarella and cheddar cheese, topped with guacamole, sour cream and pico de gallo this app will have you coming back for more. It's big enough to split between you and a couple friends, but if you love it as much as I do, you might just consider ordering it as your meal! If a good sandwich is calling your name (and you want to stick with the steak theme) I recommend the Bistro Steak Sandwich. It's my go-to lunch order at the Beer Bistro and I have to say, it's quite tasty. The bread is nice and soft and the steak is sautéed with onions and mushrooms and topped with provolone cheese. Plus, it comes with chips or your choice of fries or tater tots (for an extra 99 cents), but honestly I'd stick with the chips. They're not your ordinary snackers - these bistro chips are deliciously baked, light, crunchy and topped with garlic. A fantastic change of pace from your typical pub fries. If you're like me and love a good deal, the Beer Bistro does a fantastic job of supplying their patrons with food and drink specials throughout the week. I think the Beer Bistro says it best: ""Need a place to drink and eat before a United Center event? How about any damn day of the week? We are here for YOU!"" So check em' out!

The atmosphere was perfect for the last stop of the night: dim lights, cozy booths, quality music played at an acceptable volume, and friendly staff. We came in around 11:45 and were excited to learn that we could still order food. We put in an order of the Bistro Chips from the sides menu and nachos off the apps. The nachos had chicken on them and the chips were good, but they served the salsa on the side in a  small cup and I was desperately wanting more salsa. I am all about salsa on the side if it is for the sake of avoiding soggy chips, but if you go this route you need to be generous with that size of the cup. While the nachos may not have fully delivered, the Bistro Chips exceeded all my expectations. They were golden brown, crispy bites of heaven served with a ranch dipping sauce. I am a sucker for ranch. We ended up ordering multiple baskets of these babies and devoured each basket in 2 minutes flat.  I am not a beer drinker and I had also already cut myself off from wine, but hubs did order a beer. He said their beer menu was large which was nice, but they didn't have anything truly exotic or extraordinary. He is a major beer snob so take that with a  grain of salt. He rarely finds things on menus that he hasn't tried. Tough life, right? My only beef with this place was the single occupancy rest room. Unless I am at an outdoor concert and have enjoyed multiple glasses of margarita, I don't do the whole waiting in line with a bunch of guys to pee thing. Don't get me wrong, women can leave a bathroom less than rosy fresh, but getting in line behind a guy and the waiting for him outside the door for more than 5 minutes made me give serious thought to trying my hand at public urination outside in -4 degree temperatures just to avoid that moment when he opened the door and apologized to me with his eyes.

My friend Dan G. introduced me to this lovely spot post a Yelp event last week and then had his going away shindig here a couple days later. So for that, this review is absolutely dedicated to him! :) Dedicating reviews is a thing, right?  Beer Bistro is a great place for grabbing some brews with friends in the West Loop. Street metered parking was never an issue for me either time I went, however both times were on weekdays. It's a huge space with decently clean bathrooms and a stellar staff. I had a very shameful moment here with our server that was kind to me although I'm sure thought I was a total weirdo. People were coming & going and I was meeting many I hadn't before, so I kept standing up and shaking the hands of them introducing myself. Well, the server came and me not realizing she was our server did the same to her. I'm such a douche canoe.  Very important to note, Wednesdays are $3 can nights! And that's not just lovely PBRs...some truly good cans for $3! I got to try some cool new drinks on the cheap.  Even outside of the Wednesday night specials, Beer Bistro has good brews on tap, other great ones in the bottle and their prices aren't half bad either.  If you have a big group like we did, they have a very nice sectioned off area with comfy booths and a table in the middle plus a TV for viewing games.

2012-10-22,4.0,"Beer Bistro is sort of doing two things at once.  It's near the United Center, so a good amount of its business comes from sports fans and other standard bar folk.  But it also has an expansive beer selection, so it also has an element of craft brew aficionados.  And as it turns out, those mix together pretty well. My friends I started frequenting The Beast when a bunch of staff from D4 in Streeterville moved over a few years ago.  It's always a lot of fun--a little rowdier than other after work places, but also has good food (for a bar) and great beer.  Are you a little too old for a frat party but not yet ready to stick to the wine list?  Beer Bistro is for you.",0.9613,0.814,0.167,0.019,0.42857142857142866

Good public transit access; at Madison and Aberdeen on the 20-Madison bus line from the Loop, and about four blocks from the new Morgan station on the Green and Pink Lines They also have a newer second location at 1415 West Fullerton (the former SmallBar location), which I have not yet visited, but which they tell me offers a somewhat different beer list.",0.9831,0.799,0.187,0.015,0.42344877344877335

We actually like the place, but lately the quality has been slipping.  I think they've been overwhelmed by the crowds generated by all the positive reviews -- and they have an especially difficult time before and after Bulls or Blackhawks games. Our dinner last night (just before the Bulls game) was an example of this problem. I had a turkey sandwich and my wife ordered fish & chips. The sandwich came with house-made potato chips that were a disaster -- way overcooked (almost burnt) and horribly greasy.  When I pointed out that the chips were burnt our server brought out another small basket of chips that were exactly the same.  Awful.  A note to Beer Bistro: these chips are inedible as they are prepared now...you'd be much better off just buying commercially made chips from Lays, etc. and throwing those on the plate. My wife's fish was similarly overcooked and greasy.  The fries accompanying her meal were OK but lukewarm. Also, at one point she asked for a Heineken, but our server said that they didn't have any that were cold, so she ordered a draft beer instead.  That was fine, except when we received our check we were charged for the Heineken she never had. Our server quickly removed that erroneous charge, but again, this was an unfortunate service lapse. The bottom line? You couldn't find a nicer place for a drink and the staff is very friendly, but if you plan to have something to eat I'd recommend avoiding Beer Bistro when they are busy.",-0.9185,0.782,0.093,0.126,0.5015467171717173

2011-11-14,4.0,"Beer Nerds Unite! Yep.  This is where you go in the West Loop for lots of good beers in both bottles and on tap. Beer Bistro is also known for their tap takeovers, meaning all the taps of regular offerings will be replaced with a single brewery's beers.  For those who geek out over beers, this is a huge deal because you're able to sample beers not offered anywhere else.  It's pretty cool. Because the tap takeovers are a big deal for the beer drinking community, it can get pretty crowded so don't be discouraged if you can't snag a table right away.  Just wait it out.  I stopped in for the recent Bell's takeover and was shocked with serious people take these tap takeovers.  I spotted several dudes at the bar and a few at tables with the Bell's menus ticking off each beer (and there were A LOT) once they'd sampled them.  That's dedication.  That's also going to cause some extreme intoxication.  I spotted some beers that were over 10% APV.  Eek! Service is always lovely at the tables.  The servers know what's up and will make some recommendations.  Our gal didn't skip a beat when I told her I wasn't overly knowledgeable about beers and wanted something ""girlie.""  It's a bit more challenging to get a beer at the bar when you're standing behind the seated folks, but nothing too deterring. Food looked good, though I didn't sample it.  I did notice, though, that you can order a basket of bacon.  Yep.  It's on the menu as a side item.  God, I love living in Chicago where you can actually order straight up bacon at a bar...",0.9775,0.86,0.119,0.02,0.5486912393162392

We had to call them over to place the order, to get silverware after the food arrived and to get the check. We dealt with 4 different bartenders...each one more rude than the last. While we were waiting for our food the manager brought up a catering order that was made on the wrong day and all of the employees stood at the end of the bar eating mini burgers and talking about . I found that to be very unprofessional and frustrating since we were being so blatantly ignored. With a drinks and food our bill still came to over $60.  I still left my standard 20% gratuity even though I didn't know who it was going to and was not even thanked on the way out.

Alas, its sad how one time can leave such a bad taste in your mouth that you decide to frequent other less convenient places. We went there and ordered a couple of beers and an appetizer.  The beer was brought promptly which is always great, but after 20 minutes the appetizer had still not been delivered.  The waitress came and told us she just checked with the kitchen and it would be up very soon. 20 more minutes go by and still no appetizer.  I am much more easy going about these things than my wife but even I was getting upset.  The waitress then came back and said they accidentally delivered the food to the wrong table and they ate it already so she was going to put it in again.   20 more minutes go by (see a pattern?).  We finally receive our appetizer which was the spinach and artichoke dip.  The chips were stale and the dip was cold (like it had been sitting somewhere for the last hour).  So, after over an hour of being there, we have had three beers (I ordered another, my wife refused to) and a cold stale appetizer. I will say that one of the managers came over and apologized and offered to buy us our next round.  We were in no mood to stay and drink any more (obviously not in the best mood now).  We also were going to get dinner, but during this entire time the waitress never asked us if we would like to order dinner.   So after 90 minutes with 3 beers (between us) and a bad appetizer we get up and leave with a serious bad taste in our mouths. This was about a month ago and we have not been back since and do not plan on returning any time soon.",-0.975,0.787,0.074,0.139,0.5445945945945947
2011-08-23,3.0,"We stopped in here after work one day for the Goose Island takeover.  Why?  Because Sofie and Matilda are crazy delicious and if I had a say in what would be on tap in the bar in Hell where I'll no doubt be employed as a waitress for all the girls who were mean to me in high school, it would be Sofie, Matilda, and straight chocolate syrup. I'm going to have a hard time reviewing just the venue because after about 4 mini glasses of specialty beers at 10.4% alcohol I was pretty happy with everything.  BUT I did notice a few things with which I did not necessarily agree and decided that I would not be back unless there was a whole barrel of specialty Goose Island with my name on it: 1. Regular patrons of this drinking facility seemed ill informed of the ""takeover"" aspect of the evening.  It just did not make sense to them.  ""Well can I get a vodka cranberry?  Can I get a lemon drop?  Can I at least get an appletini?""  The bartender was pretty rad and had a good amount of patience but finally got tired of saying ""It's just beer tonight,"" then being asked ""Well how about a cosmo?!"" and just started making fucktard drinks to keep the fucktards from leaning over my shoulder and shouting fucktardy things.  If there's one thing I hate it's when man-breasts graze my shoulder.  If there's one thing I hate more than that, it's when those man-breasts are covered in cheap satin printed with martini glasses and flames and stuff.  Guuhhhhh. 2. There is one bathroom on the main floor, and I really wish that someone had told me of the second bathroom downstairs.  Because the regular patrons of this drinking facility like to pee on the floor.  I found myself wading through a puddle of urine in the line for the unisex bathroom, and standing in another puddle of (warmer) urine whilst hovering over the fetid toilet to avoid an infection.  You know, one of those restrooms where you think ""Maybe I should walk around and air out a bit before re-joining my party so everyone doesn't think I pee all over myself?"" 3. The general attitude seems to be ""Yo bro, it's fuckin Wednesday and I just sold some muthafuckin insurance and I'm HORNY.  Let's go to Beer Bistro and un-tuck the hell outta our striped shirts dog!!""  Also a lot of ""I'm so glad this Ann Taylor top works as a day-to-night look because I just finished a law class and I'm about to get totes wrecked!""  Waiting in that unisex bathroom line was so painfully awkward that I almost called myself on the payphone nearby so I'd have someone to talk to besides the poofy-chest-haired slicked back weirdo leaning into my face and leering off to the right of my head like he couldn't decide which one of the four of me was cuter. The food was good.  The Goose Island was good.  The bartender was cool.  The crowd?  Not my style.  Not even for an after work drink.  If I was into that I might as well be into floating in a tiny boat down a pee river during a penis parade.  Next stop, Goose Island!",-0.8364,0.807,0.092,0.102,0.5454703088239674

These two issues alone can ruin a hot Saturday afternoon for a group of friends who just want to grab some grub, booze, and of course beer to mark the beginning of summertime CHI. Thanks for ruining that experience with a not so pleasant waitress and a food wait time of over 30 minutes for a few sliders and some fish tacos.  Our waitress was Beth (not sure if this is her name - she didn't introduce herself so I read it off the receipt, therefore if this is the wrong person I apologize in advance...but i doubt I'm wrong) and she was CLEARLY having a bad day. No smiles, she huffed and puffed when we slightly dragged on our order, she rarely came to the table for refills, and at one point she mumbled and I quote ""I can't believe I have to go over there"" - referencing another table on the other side of the room. I know how it is when you work in the food service industry and you are having a shitty day. But we are a light hearted group and I need you to pull it together Beth! You are ruining the beginning of my summer and because of your stank ass attitude, there is a high probability we won't be stopping here again. Beer Bistro's saving grace - a nice gentleman behind the bar who took note of Beth's frustration and came to our table to refill water, refill drinks, and eventually flag our waitress to bring the check (owner maybe?). He was super nice so I'll give them the rebound half star for that.  Food was cold when it arrived at our table. Big no no. We had sliders and fries and generally these things aren't served below room temperature. SN: these are the smallest sliders I have ever seen in my life - great for a diet, not for my fat girl fix.

No worries, they hooked us up with a table when one was freeing up so we could eat. We've had most of the things on the menu. The buffalo calamari, sliders or quesadillas are good starts. Kris usually gets the pizzas because she really likes them here. I'll often have the Gourmet Burger- Pretzel roll with peanut butter, fried egg, bacon & cheddar. It's an interesting combo that really works. You can expect to see wursts for Oktoberfest and corned beef for St. Patty's day. Oh yeah, they have great tots too.  We used to hold our board meetings in the downstairs room. They open that area up on busier nights. It's a long bar with dark wood and a huge mirror. On nice days in the summer, you'll be lucky to snag one of the three outside tables. I have fond memories of chilling out there as the sun set, throwing back hand grenades of the Optimator.  The Bistro is usually pretty crowded when there is a game at the UC. You can hop their shuttle to the game, catch the 20 which stops right here, or just chill and watch the game on one of their flat screens. Bob runs a tight ship here and every server knows about the entire beer selection and can describe them in detail and point you in the right direction. We love this place and the best part is I can fall off my stool and be home. Trust me, I've done it. Cheers Bistro. LDK",0.9974,0.772,0.2,0.028,0.5070728291316529

The others at the table got a bunch of sliders and fish tacos and everyone really liked their food.

The food though is what drags this place down. I had fish tacos. I love fish tacos. Maybe it was a poor selection for a bar-food choice, but if you can't make it don't put it on the menu. These were possibly the worst fish tacos I've ever had. I ate them because I was kinda drunk and hungry, but I didn't enjoy them at all.

2010-11-21,5.0,"It seems that every establishment that occupied 1061 W. Madison is always a favorite of mine.  The first time I visited this building was oh so many years ago (let's say 7 years ago) when it was a martini bar.  At the time I was in my ""Sex and the City sophisticated woman"" stage and was all about the cosmos, french martinis and the like.  The establishment was quickly becoming my neighborhood haunt. But the neighborhood of West Town/West Loop (whatever people or your local alderman are calling it these days) caters to a meat and potatoes crowd (Carmichael's being just down the street and Billy Goat's Tavern a short walk away).  So, eventually, the martini bar faded away. But in it's place (Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Ha-lle-lu-jah),  a pub now stands.  A pub that serves so many beers that will make your head spin, and once it's done spinning, there are still a few more beers to complete the menu. The first time I visited Beer Bistro, I was so ecstatic that a joint like this had opened in my neighborhood.  After reviewing the menu for the first time, I realized they sold my most favorite beer in the whole wide world -- Lindeman's Framboise!!!  That sealed it for me, The Beer Bistro was now my favorite place on earth.   Each time I visit The Beer Bistro, I just loved the place more and more.  The service has always been top notch; all of the servers are extremely helpful and knowledgeable.  The Framboise is my fave, but as there are so many libations on The Beer Bistro menu, I have tasted my share of beer and the staff is always great in providing me recommendations whenever I am undecided. The food is great.  The dining menu has staples such as burgers, pizza, mac & cheese, wings. But also has items such as fish tacos, paninis and quesadillas.  Fare for everyone.  I have to recommend the array of sliders (Mmmm, mmmm, good).  i also recommend visiting The Beer Bistro during the week to take advantage of the weekly specials; visiting on Tuesdays is a must (how can you say no to $2 Angus Burgers?!!). I have hosted my husband's 35th bday party and the large private booth is both secluded and large enough for about 10 people.  If you are interested in hosting a larger party, the private bar downstairs can be rented. Although my visits to The Beer Bistro have been limited since Baby DD's arrival, I have still taken advantage of the take out menu.  I at least can take a little piece of The Beer Bistro home with me.  I am looking forward to the day when I can step back into the bistro, sidle up to the bar and savor a beer from their extensive menu.  I may even try their beer drinking challenge; if you drink all the beers on the menu (you have until June; no need to risk alcohol poisoning to do it in one night!!), you will be invited to The Beer Bistro's outing of the Crosstown Classic at a Wrigleyville rooftop.   I am glad that The Beer Bistro's has occupied the space at 1061 W. Madison for these years.  You are my pub of choice in the city and I cannot wait to get back to being a regular at your establishment.  Save some Lindeman's Framboise and Sofie, Ephemere, Pear Cider, Banana Nut Bread beer (you get the idea) for me.",0.992,0.852,0.114,0.033,0.4758683396981269

Back then it was great-- wonderful beer selection and GOOD bar food all convenient to my house. I'd even take out-of-town beer-nerd friends to this place because they do have a good selection and it was closer than going up to the Hopleaf in Andersonville. Last night I came here with my two friends. One of the friends, like me, used to frequent this place quite regularly over the first couple of years that it was open. The service was always good back then. Last night, the service was not good. We were there for a few hours and had quite a few (RATHER EXPENSIVE) beers and some food. We sat at the bar and while the bartender was pretty attentive for the first round of drinks there were long periods where she wouldn't come by, which ended up in us not ordering food for almost an hour after arriving!  Then we got the bill and found it pretty stupid for them to charge extra ($0.50) for the mayo we had with our fries. My friends told this to the bartender but she was all ""sorry, I have to ring it into the system that way and there's nothing I can do"". Which is fine, it's not her fault.  However, then the manager came by and he was a COMPLETE douche about it. He did the whole ""sorry, that's business"" and ""that's what you're gonna see at any other bar or restaurant in the area"". Now, if we want to get technical about it MOST bars and restaurants in the area serving fries/frites these days ALWAYS provide sauces, so, no I haven't been charged for a tiny cup of mayo in the past. Yes, it was only 50 cents, but give me a break. We spent about 100 bucks there that night between the three of us and they had to nickel and dime us like that?  Anyway, in addition to this guy completely lacking customer service skills, the straw that really broke the camel's back was when he was all ""Well, it was very nice meeting you"" to my friends. Give me a break, don't be a dick and then give that fake response. Say you have to go attend to other things, but don't say it was NICE TO MEET THEM when you clearly treated them like crap. So, the manager needs to take some customer service lessons and perhaps the owner needs to adjust the menu/charging to not charge for A CONDIMENT that should come with the food anyway.

The crowd varied from late twenties to early forties.  (Much appreciated as I was not in the mood to deal with drunken, stumbling woo girls).

When our friends arrived, we proceeded to a screened off, semiprivate banquette that fit all 15 of us.  Equipped with comfy banquette benches, a large table, and several televisions, it offered us some privacy and kept us in the loop with the Blackhawks scores.

No longer does one *have* to go north to Andersonville or chad to Lincoln Park to get a beer on (you could always go sorta north to Lincoln Square, but that's another review). The bistro space is huge. Again, I appreciate not being smooshed onto other patrons. I like the fact that I can get a drink *and* a stretch on. Points to you, Beer Bistro. I wasn't crazy about the draftiness. The same boon that allows for so much space is a bit of a hazard in the winter time. No matter where I sat (I changed my seating), I could not get warm. I always felt the distinctive 'whoosh' of old man winter preparing to knock my @ss out. I spent the majority of my time hunched over and shivering like I was Shaggy/Scooby Doo and had just sent a 'ghost.' I was also a little put out that there was no Amber option on the draft board. I don't know whether this was a temporary snafu, but Ambers are my favorite to drink and I was hoping that a beer bistro could satisfy my amber + draft desires. I settled upon a Milk Stout which lived up to its name. It was pretty hearty, very creamy and I could barely detect any carbonation. It would probably be better as a post-meal brew. I was okay with it, but I wouldn't order it again. I'll come back -- most likely when it is warmer and there are some Amber drafts on the big board. A big shout out, however, to our waitress.

Huge bottle selection. Even a couple cans for those nights where you want save a few bucks.  The atmosphere is very casual with a friendly staff. Decent place to watch a game or just hang out. Gets crowded on Fridays after work. The food is just average, but they do have a nice burger and pizza special during the week. Free shuttle to the UC is a nice bonus.

2010-01-05,4.0,"Beer Bistro is one of my favorite neighborhood watering holes. It's a great spot for a casual date, to catch up with a friend, or to celebrate. There's a small outdoor seating area that has three tables that fit up to four guests. I've lucked out every time I visited over the summer and into the fall and have scored outdoor seating. There are plenty of high top tables for two and a party section in the back of the bar with lush booths and a large flat screen television. Probably large enough to fit 15 guests. They have food and drink specials every night of the week and the waitstaff are wonderfully bubbly. The Tuesday night $2 burgers are large and juicy. It can get pricey when you add additional toppings like cheese and mushrooms. The burger doesn't come with fries but my friends and I like to share a basket of tator tots in lieu of fries. I also enjoy their $5 dollar pizzas. I'd say they're large enough to feed 2-3 people. The food options on their regular menu are your typical pub fare and I've never had a dish that I didn't like.  I'm not a fan of their martinis but it's called the ""Beer Bistro"" not ""Martini Bistro"" bistro so I shouldn't complain of that. I've learned a great deal about the range of beers that are out in the world (120 are offered at Beer Bistro) thanks to the well-versed waitstaff. They always have great suggestions when I tell them the styles and flavors I like/dislike.  It can get a little crowded and rowdy on the weekends or before/after Bulls/Blackhawk games so I like to plan my visits avoiding those days. Also - beware of the bathrooms - or at least the staircase leading down to the bathrooms. I've probably seen three girls trip down the stairs on three different occassions...too many Deliriums perhaps? Cheers to Beer Bistro! I'm forever a fan.",0.9951,0.789,0.189,0.022,0.4783551078551079

Mine was cooked almost exactly the way I ordered it.  I also upgraded to the pretzel bun for $2, which was a prudent investment because the pretzel bun was very soft and chewy, and surprisingly not very salty.  A nice enhancement to the burger.  I also got a pint of the Two Brothers Heavy Handed IPA - a nice recommendation by our server.  It looked like they had about 20 or so beers on tap, and a pretty solid selection with a bunch of local brews. The bottled beer list is even better with at least 100 beers available. They were also doing a 12 beers of X-mas special featuring some solid beers like Delirium Noel and La Chouffe, which was awfully tempting.   My only complaint was the frostbite that was setting in as the cold tundra air swept through the place every time someone opened the front door. In fact the party seated behind us all had their coats on while they were eating!  Wow, now that is determination. No where else on earth will people endure frostbite to get a $2 burger!

While the huge menu of beers is a great idea, I am not sure it means that much when they are ""out"" of over half of the beers. Everything worth ordering on the draft beer list they were ""out"" of. After continually being told ""we are out of that"", we moved onto ordering food. Like the beers, the ""we are out of that"" statement came up at least 4 or 5 times when 7 of us tried to order food. A few people ordered sliders, and instead of bringing them out on plates with the order for each person, they mixed them all up and brought them out on a big plate. We did not come here for a buffet style experience, so figure out how to put the food people ordered on a plate and put it in front of them. If you cannot do that, don't bother working as a server or trying to run a place that serves food. Service was also terrible. No one should have to wait over 15 minutes for a server to bring you a beer when all they have on their plate is 3 tables.

That evening, a pair of businessmen cam in and ordered Bud Lights. I was watching the bartender and observed a quick and uncontrollable look of disgust pass over her face. She quickly and professionally offered some suggestions of pilsners that might appeal to a Bud drinker. At this point, one of the men remarked, ""I have never heard of any of these beers!?""

I joined my friend here for dinner and drinks last night, and when it came time to order drinks I admit I was overwhelmed.  I told our server, Jennifer, that I wanted to expand my horizons a bit and wanted some suggestions.  She was extremely helpful and knowledgeable about their offerings.  We discussed what beer I normally drink (Miller Lite *hangs head in shame*), and she suggested a nice Trumer Pils.  Sure!  My friend was not really into expanding her horizons and stuck with Bud Light. The Trumer Pils was not only delicious, but it came in a really awesome non-traditional pilsner glass.  So awesome that the guy sitting at the neighboring table immediately asked our server what it was when she brought it to me.  That's right - be jealous of my beer. While we waited for our food, we were able to talk and catch up - the bar was almost full when we came in, but it wasn't noisy at all and it was so nice to be in a bar and not have to not scream across the table at each other.  There are plenty of places to sit (though outside was full, of course) and I even spied a sort of semi-private area towards the back with large red couches.  The semi-private area didn't really seem to fit in with the rest of the bar's atmosphere, but at the end of the day semi-private areas are always nice.  They also had the Cubs-Cards game on TV, so obviously I was in heaven and really liking this place. While the service, the atmosphere, and the drinks were great and worthy of at least 4-5 stars...  the food really fell short for me.  I ordered the blackened chicken and it had a little too much heat for my taste buds.  So much heat that it really aggravated my already angry allergies.  The accompanying potatoes and broccoli were fine, but nothing outstanding.  My friend had been raving about the cookie sundae, so we got that for dessert.  I only had a few bites, but it was really good so it was kind of the saving grace of the meal.  Definitely split this one - it's huge. Overall I really liked everything about this place except for the food.  Next time (and there will be a next time - hello, have you SEEN their amazing specials during the week?!) I'll make sure to order something different to eat or grab a bite nearby before heading over.  And perhaps next time we'll be able to snag a seat outside...",0.9973,0.772,0.186,0.042,0.5701567785584177

2009-05-04,3.0,"On a lazy Sunday afternoon, my girlfriends and I wandered into Beer Bistro to grab a beer and catch up. I was somewhat impressed with their beer menu, but the waitress wasn't as knowledgeable about the beers as she thought she was. After finding out that my first two beer selections were out, I selected an Orval - a Trappist beer that somewhat reminds me of a Belgian version of an IPA. The 11.2oz bottle retails at Binny's for around $6. I was expecting to pay around $7.50 or so. I should have been suspicious when their beer bottle menu didn't include prices. When the bill came, I was shocked to see that the Orval cost $9.00! Had I known it was that expensive, I would have chosen another beer.  Sundays are $.25 wing day - awesome. The buffalo wings were spicy - just the way I like them. $.99 extra for about 6 pieces of celery? Not so awesome. $.50 for a little cup of blue cheese dressing - kinda understandable.  My friends ordered the hummus plate, and it was awesome. Crisp veggies, warm, kind of sweet pitas, and chunky delicious hummus.  I was still starving, so I ordered the chopped salad. I'm always a member of the clean plate club, but this salad was so blah that I didn't bother. It did have awesomely large pieces of bacon, but it didn't have adequate blue cheese or other non-lettuce things. The dressing was too fruity for a chopped salad.  The service was fine, but the waitress was not friendly and came off as almost rude at times. Our bill for 2 appetizers, 3 beers, and a lackluster salad came out to about $53 (including tip). All in all, Beer Bistro has a nice beer selection and OK food, but it's a little overpriced for my taste. I would give Beer Bistro 2 stars, but they get an extra star for an extensive (if somewhat unimaginative) beer list.",0.9871,0.778,0.152,0.07,0.5886288998357965

My first impression of the place, looking at the extensive beer list online was of anticipation... a generous selection of fine brews from around the world. Upon arriving, I lapped up a delicious Great Lakes Eliot Ness for $4.50. Not a fantastic price, but palatable. Next, being the Tuesday special, I ordered a $2 burger and split a $3 basket of fries with friends. At this price, how can one resist? Let it not go unnoticed that you get what you pay for: the burger was decently good, but looking at its standardized shape and obviously fake ""grill marks"", it certainly looked like a preformed patty from a generic food distributor. Toppings were a bit sparse for my preference, so I stole extra lettuce from a carnivore friend. The bun was completely forgettable - your standard white bread, not toasted or dressed in any way. It simply soaks up the burger juice and compresses to nothingness. Fortunately, my second beer, a Franziskaner Hefe-Weisse Dunkel was delicious and lifted my mood - once I finally received it. In fact, I had to ask the waitress a second time for my brew because she forgot the first go around. The 25 oz bottle was $6.50, making the price again decent. We finished the evening by sampling the Half Baked cookie (a la mode). This was also decent and huge, a mere $6 split between us. Make no mistake... the cookie is truly half-baked in the center. Some liked it more than others - my preference was definitely for the well done outer edges. The wait staff is eager to answer questions- probably at the hand of management - but they seemed less than astute. Obvious mispronunciations and generic descriptions of the beer seemed to communicate only a textbook knowledge rather than an intimate love of the beer. Maybe the bartenders are different in this regard, but between the two waitresses I had, I left disappointed.

After all, this is my favorite bar of all time:  yelp.com/biz/kams-champa… Their $2 burger specials on Tuesdays sound great, right? But one of the bartenders informed us that the special is only good if you buy a beer as well (even she seemed to think it is a lame deal).

I think its partly because my friends and I have made BB our Thursday night hangout. And Thursday means $5 martinis and 1/2 price appetizers.... such an awesome deal !! So I'm completely cool with passing on the beer cause their martinis are yummmeh and make me happy !! My favorite martinis are the mango, strawberry, and chocolate shake (done so much better than most places).  And the food --- Pretty huge selection of appetizers and pizzas/sandwiches. We've had just about every appetizer and not one has disappointed. Sliders, dips, tater tots, nachos... yumm.  Lots of seating - highboys, tables, and seating around the bar. Outdoor seating is prime during the summer. They even have a cool back lounge room if you have a big group. Though, sometimes the staff can get picky about where you sit depending on how big/small your party is.  So although its called Beer Bistro and they obviously specialize in beer - they definitely have sooooo much more to offer. Its such a great place to just hang out, drink, and chill for hours.",0.9962,0.753,0.239,0.008,0.6272727272727273

The second one I tried, the Effen Pom, was effen disgusting and tasted like cold medicine. I loved that they had Menage by the glass though and the bar was pretty cool. The food we tried was good enough for bar food. My friend Karie declared the tater tots to be A+ and far superior to those at Sidecar.

2008-10-20,4.0,"A visit to The Beer Bistro was suggested without much enthusiasm by a friend who recently moved to ""Little Italy"" (if that neighborhood can still be said to exist). Expectations were low; I figured we'd down a couple brews from an unsurprising but passable selection, but there were a few curveballs--Caracole Nostradamus? Rockies Hazed & Infuzed? Deus? Feeling unadventurous, I chose a Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA on tap, followed by a Surly Bender, also on tap.  As time and the effects of alcohol wore on, the Gourmet Cheese pizza became enticing (cheddar, mozzarella, goat cheese, parmesan, american, and provolone). I expected nearly nothing from the food except to fill the growing void in my belly, but the pizza excelled. The innumerable cheeses blended together to create a whole that truly exceeded the sum of its parts, the sauce was assertively sweet and tomatoey without being obtrusive, and the razor-thin crust yielded completely to the business on top without a hint of crispness, which is just how I prefer it. The decor deftly melds a sports bar vibe with aspirations to the glamour of Randolph Street's nearby higher-end establishments, with the ultimate effect that everything kind of cancels everything else out, creating a pleasant neutralness. A man in a jacket with Lit-professor elbow patches sat just feet away from a disheveled, stringy-haired woman bearing a pushcart. The place has no business calling itself a bistro, but the affectation comes off less like misplaced snootiness and more like a kid who wants to follow in his dad's footsteps. I will almost certainly return for that sublime pizza, as well as to cautiously try some other offerings. A couple notes about the menu, which has some flaws: Although I didn't notice it at the time, in retrospect I agree with another poster's comment that the bar didn't reflect an enthusiasm for beer enjoyment. With such a large selection of beers, most of which are fairly obscure to the casual, mainstream beer drinker, descriptions would have been helpful. Their absence seems particularly conspicuous in light of the menu's exhaustive beer pairings, down to the hummus plate (Goose Island 312). You kind of get the impression that one of the staff members was tasked with matching every single beer to some menu item or other, often arbitrarily--Stiegl Pilsner with the quesadillas?",0.9937,0.816,0.151,0.033,0.4564399092970522

What gets me is how joyless the beer-enjoying experience is here.  The beer list has no description whatsoever -- just the names -- so those who want to venture out from what they know will have to rely on the servers or the bartender to help... except that on a Friday night I visited, they seemed severely understaffed -- my server barely had time to set drinks on our table before she had to scurry off to serve her other 10-12 tables.  Of course, having to shout at my server to be heard doesn't help, but overall atmosphere doesn't make it very conducive to interaction with the staff.  At least other beer joints like Hopleaf or even Sheffield's have a descriptive menu that you can use as a self-guide.   Compounding the problem is that the beer menu doesn't have prices associated to the items.  As such places go, it's not the type of place where everything on the menu is $5 except $6 for Guinness; the choices in the menu can range probably anywhere from $4-5 range to +$15 (for the 750ml brews).  With the rushed service, you basically have to point, then they bring out the beer, and you hope that you have a beer-literate friend who will fill you in and hope to God you didn't point to a Trois Pistoles ($18 for a 750ml, which you wouldn't know from the list).  The prices aren't high for what you'd pay at a bar, mind you, but in a sad way, the joylessness of the beer-experience had me fancy a notion that perhaps this is a penetrate-the-yuppy-market attempt by Yard House chain (they have an outpost in Glenview).   Food is actually pretty good, and very reasonably priced.  With this and the great location, ambience and the enticing beer list, this could have been a better experience.  Sadly, although the place masquerades as a hophead magnet, it's just a really nice Friday-night type place with a good beer menu, obnoxious noise and very little soul.",0.9747,0.838,0.103,0.06,0.5373492063492064

I go there often and the specials are all day everyday, so it was a shock to get the bill today and have it all be full price. its a bummer, such a good place...but yet...not really clear on thier Thursday specials. :(  Great burgers, great home made circle cut fries, THE BEST bbq chicken salad, great atmosphere.  MON: $5 Pizza's, TUES: $2 Burgers, SUN: .25 Cent wings! Sometimes the staff isn't the nicest...but maybe they just had a bad day. I haven't had a Jim Beam there yet.",0.9642,0.646,0.22,0.134,0.5465538847117795
2006-09-01,4.0,"One of the best beer selections in the West Loop, and very good pizza, too!  They have a very extensive beer list, and they seem to have most of them on hand when I order them, which is good considering the number of bottles on the list.  And the food is definitely better than what I expected for a bar.  It can be a bit expensive, but they do have really good specials. Many of the beers are $1 or $2 more than you'd spend at most other places.  However, the atmosphere and the quality of the meals make the prices a bit more bearable.  The service is inconsistent, but usually better than average - though the servers generally aren't as knowledgeable about the beers as I would expect, given the name of the place.  It does seem that, even when crowded, it's fairly easy to have a conversation with those at your table, so that makes it a good place to gather for a beer or two with a couple friends after dinner.  I can't give it 5 stars because it's just too expensive for what you get, but it's a good place to go for a decent meal and good beer.",0.9913,0.8,0.2,0.0,0.5473188405797101
2006-07-28,5.0,"I felt like I was right back in Seattle when I visited the Beer Bistro. It was dark and warm, and, with beer being the main course, I couldn't have been happier. All it needed was a downpour and it would've been the epitome of ""Seattle pub"".  They have about 75 bottled beers and a great assortment of beers on tap. Not to mention a monthly ale special and great food. I recommend the spinach and artichoke dip...you have to work hard to screw something like this up, but theirs was the best I've had.  The space is long and narrow, so large groups have to wait a bit for a table together. But it's a great spot if you're with one or two others. I really enjoyed myself here and would definitely go back!",0.9842,0.741,0.23,0.029,0.4662946428571429
