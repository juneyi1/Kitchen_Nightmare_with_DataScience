I love the caprese chicken sandwich made as a panini and the smoking chicken. However, we did have an incident a few weeks ago when my husband had an anaphylactic allergic reaction after eating one of the sandwiches. He is allergic to pine nuts and we clarified that while he wasn't ordering a sandwich with pesto, we did see it was on the menu and made a point to ask If the pesto had pine nuts. They said no and we went on with our business as usual. After about two bites we had to use a (now VERY EXPENSIVE) epipen as his throat was closing up. I don't hold it against them because I didn't specifically request no cross contamination with the pesto, but it is definitely disappointing that after being reassured there were no pine nuts he still had to deal with this (and it cost us a $300 epipen).  Hope they'll be more careful when using products that contain nuts and speaking to their employees about it!",0.1958,0.795,0.095,0.111,0.5684821428571429

Don't forget to place your order up front, because if you sit like I did and wonder why there is no service, that's why...ha!

You can expect free WiFi, a clean cozy atmosphere, and a staff that seems extremely sweet and accommodating. There is access to free water, which is a big plus for me.

2015-08-15,1.0,"I liked the sandwiches and enjoyed sitting outside eating them--but they lost two customers today. Apparently the manager (owner?) Shirley gives strict instructions to her staff that they can sell food but not ""service"" customers within 30 minutes of closing. We showed up at 2:35 pm on a beautiful Saturday afternoon with our dog. The outside tables and chairs were locked up, so I asked inside if they could unlock them. The friendly counter girl said they lock them up as they're getting ready to close, but that shouldn't be a problem. I placed our order and went outside. Inside I saw the supervisor come out (Nicolette) and tell the counter girl she's not allowed to unlock them. She said we were welcome to eat inside (Not sure what we would have done with our dog).

I stopped in for lunch today and was instantly impressed the second I walked through the door. The cafe itself is decorated so cute. It warming and homey, and all of the uplifting quips and quotes that adorn the walls are so unique and different from any other corner cafe I've seen.  The menu is quite large for a lunch spot which was pleasantly surprising, but also posed a hard decision as to what I will be ordering. It consists of sandwiches, wraps, salads, and paninis. After a long, hard thought, I went with the tuna salad...salad. It was SO FRESH! The tuna was light enough but had such great flavor and the salad underneath was comprised of only the freshest ingredients. I gobbled it all up in record time!  Also offered at Nohea Cafe is a unique coffee and latte menu. I wanted to try so many thing such as a carmel macchietto, the Mexican blend, or the aloha latte which has coconut. Trying to eat healthy today, I decided to go with the Americano, which again, was nothing short of pure bliss.  Noteworthy: Nohea's special snacks they sell at the counter. These special snacks include assorted teas, popcorn, toffee, cookies, brownies, and additional candy and sweets for days. I felt like I was an ole school corner store, right on Madison Ave!

The place is cute (not too big) but definitely can accommodate a decent sized crowd. The outdoor seating is a plus! The menu is impressive (lots to choose from).  I had half sandwich and soup (Smokin Turkey and the tomato basil soup).  The 1/2 sandwich was a little smaller than I anticipated but it was very tasty. The soup was delicious too!  I definitely recommend going back.  The food is a little pricey for what you get, but I think they have a nice selection of food.",0.9875,0.759,0.241,0.0,0.5017543859649124

I'm more a fan of their chips and smoothies, but there really is something here for all audiences. The wait staff is as friendly as it gets, too. If you want good deli food with great service at a reasonable price per portion size, check out Nohea. Unlike other places nearby, they welcome customers to sit and dine and take their time, which is always appreciated for when you don't feel like rushing. Overall a cute, cozy cafe with fine eats.

2013-05-30,4.0,"first let me get it out there - I think Nohea Cafe is a bit pricey.  there I said it.  I think a sandwich - especially one that is between $8-$9 should at least come with a side of chips - those heavenly Nohea Cafe chips. ok, now that I have that out of the way - this place is so cute and cozy.  yes, it's a little cramped, but in this case, they make it work - it's charming.  maybe if it was so cramped with people the day I was there I wouldn't feel that way - but when I was there, it worked.  I can't wait to return. My sandwich was a chicken caprese and I also bought some chips - those heavenly sea salt housemade chips - and a fresh brewed iced tea.  I loved that sandwich, but the bread on there was so good I could have eaten it alone with the chips and I would have been happy. They also have old school retro candy, in addition to several kinds of pastries (including black and white cookies)...my next trip will be for dessert, coffee and conversation for sure.   Quick note - you order, pay, get a number and sit....but get your drink first.  We were kind of confused when we first walked in and got it all wrong :-/  but the nice counter lady and server helped us cause we were totally clueless...

I'm a big fan of the Morning Glory breakfast sandwich, croissants and scones, while my husband prefers the ham and egg breakfast croissant. Coffee and lunch sandwiches are delicious as well. My only small complaint is their odd hours. For a café serving breakfast and espresso, it's bizarre that they wouldn't open before 8am on weekdays (and would love for them to be open Sundays as well). I understand it's a family run business, but would expect that they could hire someone to open earlier.  Since I've been raving about Nohea to coworkers, one tried to stop by the other morning. When she went to open the (locked) door, she was met with a blank stare by the woman behind the counter as she had arrived at 7:55, trying to make it to work by 8. Instead of opening a few minutes early, the woman stood there until my coworker walked away.

Totally kid friendly (toys and stuff for kids to play), kid-friendly food line the shelves, and the staff lets you stay and linger over delicious sandwiches and probably the best ice cream ever (Ashby's).  It's a mom-daughter team that owns and runs the cafe, and they do it really well.  Try their breakfast croissant sandwich - piled high with eggs, the crispiest bacon, cheese on a flaky large croissant.  You can also custom order sandwiches, paninis and wraps.  The coffee is really delicious. There's room for strollers, and the owners love kids (nice large bathroom with very nice kid changing table).  That said, for you non-parents, it's not over run with kids, so no worries there either. The traffic flow is good, decor very elegant but still comfy and cozy and food is very fresh and made and brought out on a timely basis.  Despite my best efforts, I still haven't found a substitute for Nohea in or around Roscoe Village.  Maybe I'll have to move to West Loop to get my daily Nohea breakfast croissant/coffee fix.",0.9793,0.832,0.136,0.032,0.6037362637362638

I would say the atmosphere is definitely not relaxed and quiet... a lot louder, more like a deli.  There is a comfy couch to hang out on.  I believe they do catering, so there could be a lot of ""hustle"" around that side of their business.  They frequently have catering packages laid out on customer tables, taking up valuable space that customers could be sitting down in... not a very good idea.  Isn't there space in the back you can store your catering?

To top it off, she wasn't even nice to whomever was on the other end of the line. Don't you have a back room in which you could conduct your business?

Oatmeal  (4.95) The tiniest bowl of oatmeal which is not worth the money. Just make it at home or go somewhere else for a nice big bowl of warm oatmeal. The granola was okay and my 6 year old did not like it, but I tried it and felt it need some fruit and yogurt. They have a kids breakfast menu, but 2 of the 3 items had scrambled eggs which does not appeal to my 6 year old. Pancakes would be a good addition onto there.  There was an extensive kids lunch menu.

I went to the café on a Saturday morning with 2 friends, we all ordered breakfast and got to doing some work. Sometime around 12:30 it got really crowded, children running around and screaming loudly, something we were willing to overlook. Shortly thereafter, we were informed by the owner herself that they did not offer wi-fi from 12-2 because it was their busiest hours and that we may have to give up our table if a ""family needed it"" (we had been planning on ordering lunch and had several drinks between the 3 of us already).  Needless to say we backed our belonging and left to have our lunch somewhere else, someplace were the owner doesn't have the 1950's back of the bus business mentality.

2011-02-22,5.0,"Somewhere at the intersection of phenomenal sandwiches & very friendly staff is where you will find this great little shop known as Nohea Cafe in Chicago's Roscoe Village.  I discovered this spot somewhat by accident while visiting my accountant in the area. The cafe is located near the major streets of Roscoe and Damen. From street level, I felt compelled to stop in as my eyes were instantly drawn to the colorful cakes, big cookies and interesting donuts on display.  I don't know if she was the owner or manager, but the woman behind the counter was as beautiful as she was nice. After grazing the menu, I ordered a coffee, along with a chicken sandwich and went to a table.  While waiting for my order, I couldn't help but to notice the local artwork for sale on the wall. Since Roscoe village is a pretty artsy community, it made sense that I would see Chicago photographs, and interesting abstract paintings. Nohea also has a very warm decor. The tables are large, so four people can easily enjoy lunch. The cafe is also an ideal place for moms who want to bring little kids along as there are tables with games and toys to play with.  Food  Put it this way: I was sitting at my table when the woman served my dish and my mouth dropped. My comment was, "" Is that for me""? The sandwich was absolutely huge and yumalicious. I always appreciate it when a sandwich shop isn't cheap on the meat. I can't remember what all they hooked the sandwich up with, but all I can remember was it was tangy, and real good.  The only minor drawback to this cafe is that it's not open late enough. If it were open at night, I'd be there all the time.  Nohea also has a ton of other food items that look awesome, including a unique breakfast menu.  I'm going to have to go back on a Sunday morning sometime in the future.",0.9952,0.814,0.168,0.018,0.6007010582010581

Nohea Cafe is one of those little neighborhood gems that you walk by randomly, stop and stare into the windows (much to window sitters' chagrin) and then finally convince yourself that it's worth checking out.  I came in today with my stomach rumbling from neglect and money in my pocket. With a long list of scrumptious-sounding sandwiches, I finally narrowed down my choice to the Chicken Focaccia sandwich--oy. That honey-leek sauce, the warm and soft focaccia--hours later, my salivary glands are having dreams about it. And what's more, is that they aren't just a sandwich shop with Boar's Head products (yum! Meat!), they are also a bakery, a dry goods shop, almost like a little European mart. They carry the same kind of goodies you might find at Gene's in Lincoln Square: dried sausage, cheeses, specialty drinks, Lavosh crackers, even organic baby food. Heck, they even have ice cream!  Extra points to Nohea for: -Julius Meinl coffee (way to represent) -A table that looks like it belongs in your parents' dining room and can seat the whole family -Red velvet doughnuts...seriously.

Second, most people don't go to a cafe to listen to music; it's part of the ambience, not the showcase.  Who cares if they play Jesus music?  You're really going to give them two stars based on THAT?  Ridiculous.  I'm sure the die-hard clientele of Victory Banner don't gripe and moan over the sitar and flute Eastern-Indian music wafting over the speakers while they're eating their heavenly stuffed French Toast.  Sorry, not good enough reason to give a low rating.  Just bring your iPod and problem solved. As for no free WiFi, it's common for neighborhood cafe's to not offer it anymore as they lose business for all the moochers that just sit there for hours and drink one cup of coffee.

I went with my dad and had the special turkey meatloaf sandwich with cole slaw on it. He had the sweet Cubano sandwich with ham, carnitas, pickles, sweet mustard on a ciabatta roll. We picked up a bag of chips and a cupcake to split and we had a good meal. The sandwiches are made fresh and do take a little bit of time to prepare. The chips weren't your normal Lays or Cheetos but homemade chips. They had a few different varieties including salt, barbecue and sweet potato. The cupcake was good, it was no Bleeding Heart cupcake but it was a great way to end the meal.  Sweet Nohea also has a few grocery items for sale in addition to the prepared food. It is a great spot to go in Roscoe Village and I am excited to head back.",0.9899,0.781,0.2,0.019,0.5693624557260921

2010-04-15,5.0,"*POW* I have fallen in love...and his name is Twisted Ham!! Who knew pretzel rolls could be so good?  I sure didn't.  The Twisted Ham sandwich was simply amazing (well worth the $8). ~Mixed Greens, Avocado, Tomato, Swiss & Dijon Mustard on a Pretzel Roll~ I don't remember the last time I was so impressed by a sandwich.  The meat was so FRESH, the buns so soft and the avocado tied it all nicely together.  They offer a good variety of beverages besides the normal soda selection.  I went with the grape juice pouch.  It says on the back: ""He who throws mud only loses ground - Fat Albert"" How profound! If I hadn't been so full, I would have ordered a slice of the lemon pie I sampled.  The people working there were nice and friendly.  The cafe is super clean and has free Wi-Fi. Instructions: -Walk on in and order at the counter. -Turn around and pick out your choice of beverage from the fridge. -Pay for your food. -Pick a seat and wait for your order to be delivered. -Enjoy!

2010-03-30,5.0,"I have been to Nohea several times now and have been more impressed with every visit! Their sandwiches are fresh, flavorful, and original, and I have tried several of the homemade soups, which are fantastic!  The Cafe itself is cozy and inviting, and the staff absolutely could not be any sweeter! They've done a fantastic job with this new little sandwich shop, and you can tell that is has a lot of heart!",0.9563,0.771,0.229,0.0,0.5962121212121213
2010-02-20,5.0,"We had a great lunch here!!  Super cute cafe, a great addition to the neighborhood.  There were plenty of people, but not too crowded and there was no line.  The sandwiches were hearty and the ciabatta bread was perfect.  The herbed cream cheese was a nice complement to the BLT, whose bacon was nice and meaty and not fatty, crumbly, or greasy.  This place just felt comfortable.  There's a variety of seating from padded booths and armchairs and the artwork on the walls/ceiling was great eye-catching.  The deli/gourmet food items available for purchase were nicely displayed and a creative addition.   Nohea is definitely a nice lunch type cafe, though they have a few breakfast sandwiches on the menu.  We didn't try the coffee or desserts either, but they looked delicious.  In reference to the other reviews, they definitely now have their espresso machine, as the drinks are on the menu.  I see a lot of promise in this new place and am glad it appears to be doing well so far!!",0.9966,0.674,0.313,0.013,0.7593434343434344
2010-01-31,4.0,A nice privately owned counter-service coffeeshop / cafe where you can get a coffee or light meal. its warm and inviting and the ladies behind the counter were very friendly. they recommended a few things to try since i had never been and this establishment is new. i got a deli style sandwich which was memorably fresh with high quality ingredients and quite large in size. they had excellent music playing but i'm sadly not cool enough to even begin to let you think i know who was playing. :),0.8495,0.725,0.211,0.064,0.6132077922077922
2010-01-29,4.0,"Appears to be a coffee shop, but in reality its more of a cafe that you'd cozy up and eat lunch in...but word on the street (Roscoe Street!) is that they are getting an espresso machine soon. (fingers crossed). It really could rock a coffee shop vibe, methinks... AND, they do serve brewed Metropolis...which I do love, so points for that.  *Counter service: order yourself! *Cozy/comfy booths.  *Free wi-fi. (and gooooooood) *sweet people at the counter *chocolate covered biscotti *free parking on side streets I think once they figure themselves out a bit, this'll be a real ""coffeeshop/mobile office"" destination. With food. Brilliant. :)",0.9558,0.858,0.142,0.0,0.6599999999999999
2010-01-21,3.0,"This is so very Roscoe Village. That is a compliment! I don't know what the NYC analog to RV is. Murray Hill? I dunno. All I know is that when I walk down Roscoe, even in the middle of winter, I feel cool, a little sexy and like I should have some sort of vibraphone playing in the background, while the number 50 bus splashes me with black snow (but, I will never look like a horsey ballerina). What was I talking about? Oh yeah. Nohea. Nohea sits proudly on Roscoe and is a lot deeper than it's sorta-storefront face implies. The seating arrangements are almost all booths. The booths are pretty tight. I am a trim guy. I had a hard time fitting in the booth. This could be a problem for a party of more than a few people with winter coats/bags. This is America. Better yet, this is the Midwest. We need space. We are people of girth. Step to it, Nohea. The service is counter delivery. You step the counter, read from the board, order, sit and get your food brought out to you. I settled on the Cobb Salad sandwich and Hawaiian iced tea. The sandwich was large, but wasn't quite what I was expecting. There was a lot of turkey, almost overwhelmingly so. I appreciated the quantity but, maybe, you can cut back on the turkey and offer an equal amount of ham, avocado, egg, etc. The fun of a Cobb Salad is that there's a ton of everything. There's no real star of the show. Try to recalibrate the sandwich to reflect this. It's a great idea and the bread was the perfect choice. The tea was very tasty. I can't say what made it Hawaiian...but it tasted Hawaiian. Try it. I can see this being a fun lunch spot in the Spring/Summer. Once it works out some kinks, there shouldn't be much holding it back. Good show, Nohea.",0.9905,0.819,0.151,0.029,0.42600623582766434
2010-01-05,4.0,"This place just opened up down the street, and I just finished my sandwich.  The pros: Excellent quality meat and toppings Loved the little deli-like set-up where I can get a pound of meat or cheese or crackers.  Very cute decor and not crowded with tables.  Fantastically friendly service.  The cons:  Sandwich was $10 after putting my change in the jar. Woah. Imagine if I got a drink and dessert, or soup on the side.  We're hitting $20...for lunch.  I wasn't sure where to order, if they get busier, they might need to make it clearer.  No espresso beverages. Guess I'll still be hitting up Starbucks still :( In the end the pros outweigh the cons. Get a lunch special going, I'll be in a few times a month. The quality of the food was worth the cost.",0.9124,0.823,0.128,0.048,0.6135642135642135
2009-12-29,4.0,"What makes this place great? The staff! It's a mother/daughter team who went out on their first venture together (albeit the mother - Shirley has been in the restaurant business a long time) and couldn't be a nicer pair of people.   Great to have a new alternative to Starbucks in Roscoe Village.  A very nice ambiance, great food, free wifi, and good coffee.  The breakfast sandwiches are truly delicious and their croissants are incredible.  Will be headed back for some take and bake groceries and a friendly conversation with the staff.",0.9838,0.685,0.293,0.022,0.6336829836829837
2009-12-17,4.0,"I am so thrilled that someone has moved into the old Sweet Thang! After that huge disaster, I'm pleased and excited for another venture.  I've been to this establishment twice now, and both times have been extremely pleasant. The staff is extremely warm and welcoming, especially Shirley the owner. They seem to be serving breakfast, lunch, and prepared dinner items. They have coffee, teas, and bottle drinks, croissants and other pastries, breakfast sandwiches, lots of lunch sandwich's, and then other prepared foods. I have a delicious breakfast sandwich with egg, bacon, tomato, lettuce, and cheese served on a delicious baguette. I have also had the turkey burger which was delicious and juicy! Coffee is intelligentsia, so it's good.  The negatives thus far. No latte machine, so they won't be much competition to Starbucks. They close at 8pm which means they won't be open for the post-dinner crowd, which is ashame because they carry 8 different flavors of wonderful ice cream! A little on the pricey side. Sandwich's run close to $9, served with chips but no drink. The prepared salads are VERY small. I would suggest having a few lunch specials to try to balance the expense.  I am so glad to have this cafe in the neighborhood and I look forward to coming back!",0.9788,0.79,0.18,0.03,0.6437179487179486
