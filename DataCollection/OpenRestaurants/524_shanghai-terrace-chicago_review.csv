The moment you enter the restaurant you feel like you've been transported halfway around the world. The service is absolutely fantastic; the wait staff is friendly and attentive throughout your meal. I have never been steered wrong when asking an opinion as far as what I should order. While I think it's hard to go wrong with any menu item, the standouts to me are the Barbeque Pork Bun, the Green Leaves Shrimp Dumpling (SO delicious), and the Magnificent Enokitake Beef Rolls. While the food is definitely considered fine dining, the cuisine also feels highly authentic and reminiscent of a high class meal you could actually order in Shanghai. The hardest decision you will have to make about this restaurant is the dessert. The in house desserts (specifically the Chilled Mango Sago Cream With Seasonal Fruits) are absolutely scrumptious. Particularly if you enjoy Chinese/Cantonese desserts, you are in for a treat. However, you can also get half off the dessert bar at The Lobby (the main dining room restaurant at the Peninsula) if you have dined at Shanghai Terrace.

2017-05-23,4.0,"I'll admit that I was highly skeptical of Shanghai Terrace before going.  As someone who generally finds that the best and most authentic Chinese food in the U.S. is usually in Chinatown, I doubted that a high-end hotel restaurant, even one run by a H.K.-based company, would deliver anything remotely resembling good Chinese food.  Sure, I expected that service and ambiance would be perfect, but if those were the only selling points, I'd have walked away disappointed and annoyed about paying a huge markup compared to most other Chinese restaurants. I ended up being very impressed.  We were a table of 3 last Friday and we ordered the dim sum sampler, which was probably the most disappointing item (I like the dim sum at Minghin so much more), followed by the special Red Rice, the steamed fish special (which was Halibut), the Kung Pao Chicken, and the vegetable stir fry.  Among those dishes, the fish was the best by a wide margin and was consumed quickly.   I tried the Sour Cherry Old-Fashioned and really enjoyed that cocktail.  They have a nice selection of wine and beer as well, but sadly their draft beer was unavailable that night. Service, as expected, was extremely attentive, discreet, and professional.   Overall, the reason it gets 4 instead of 5 stars is due primarily to the high prices.  I'd say it costs 2-3 times more than most other Chinese restaurants, and while the setting and service are what set it apart from places that I go to more, I'm not sure I could justify going on a regular basis.  I'd highly recommend it though, particularly to those who want Chinese food and aren't quite adventurous enough to wander over to Chinatown.",0.9749,0.765,0.156,0.078,0.4912729473255788

It's a 5 stars hotel and venue, what do you expect, right? - Lobster hot & sour soup was tasty, the lobster chunk was big. - Chicken & Lobster truffle dumplings, delicious, anything got  truffle on it, I'm in love. - Foie gras & duck dumpling - Steamed Pork dumpling Shanghai style Xiao Long Bao - was perfect soupy and fatty. - Peking duck and roasted pork, the pork was OK, but the duck was perfectly juicy and melt in your mouth.  - Abalone, scallop, prawn, special for May 2016 menu. - Australian abalone with pok choy, my first time tried Australian abalone, it was crunchy, chewy in texture than the Monterey Bay or Hokkaido ones. - Lobster and long life noodle, special request for the chef and he accommodated. It was flavorful, the garlic and onion were all over it, just how we like it.    2 glasses of wines, and 2 cocktails later, dinner + tax + tip was about $550. For the quality of food, drink, and wine we had. It's very well priced for this part of town.  Service was impeccable. Our waitresses were kind, biggest smile, and so polite, caring, and extremely accommodating. The type of service that you want when you travel. The type of service when you dine at a 5 stars venue.    Post dinner, we went to the terrace outside to enjoy a beautiful night in Chicago. What a memorable it was for me and my ex. We always love it here.",0.9964,0.793,0.19,0.017,0.5064342403628118
2016-06-12,5.0,Super nice place.  Brought my parents here when they last visited.  The food was delicious.  Much more of an authentic Chinese style than your typical Chicago Chinese restaurant (outside of Chinatown).  Service was fantastic.  My Dad tried to leave only a 15% tip (for no other reason than he's a cheapskate)... I wouldn't have any of that and insisted on leaving the tip myself!  Highly recommend!,0.943,0.729,0.226,0.044,0.5248809523809524
2016-06-02,2.0,"The food isn't bad, but for a restaurant that was apparently voted Best Chinese restaurant in Chicago, I was expecting something better. I sampled a variety of dishes for dinner, including a few dim sum plates, the Peking duck, the Maine lobster, and beef noodle. The Peking duck was a disappointment, with skin that had gone soggy and a relatively low ratio of skin to meat. The other dishes fared a bit better, but were lacking in finesse. For example, the beef noodle was indistinguishable from what one might find at a regular take-out Chinese place. The seafood shumai was one-dimensional, paling in comparison to the scallop shumai at Hakkasan, which features fresh scallops resulting in a bright refined taste.  Service, while friendly, was also not quite up to Peninsula standards in terms of overall attentiveness. Pacing also needed improvement, as all of our courses somehow managed to arrive simultaneously, resulting in a haphazard and crowded table arrangement.  However, the terrace setting was very enjoyable - sleek and elegant Asian-inspired decor, and on a warm evening it made for an excellent dining atmosphere.",0.9914,0.745,0.221,0.034,0.4567540792540792

2016-05-19,5.0,"-Shanghai Surprise- Our friends, who we were staying with, made the reservations for us.  They ended up having to cancel, so we went as a party of two instead. The hotel where it's located (the Peninsula Chicago) was swanky.  We walked in and noticed there was some sort of formal function going on in a large room adjacent to the restaurant.  Guests were outfitted in tuxedos, gowns, furs, and jewels!  We felt slightly underdressed. The hostess greeted us and offered a table near the entrance. We chose to wait for a table with a view, one that was more central to everything. She mentioned we could wait at the bar up the stairs, and she'd retrieve us when our table was ready. We walked upstairs and into the cozy bar, and sat down.  The server brought us some nibblly things as we looked over the drink menu. I'd already had a few beers earlier, so we decided to skip the drinks. It was a nice place to people watch while you wait. The hostess came in shorty and led us to our table inside. I loved the way it was decorated; warm colors, dark wood, and splashes of red throughout. The subdued lightning and other touches made it feel like we were in an upscale place in China (although I've never been). Our table had a view of the terrace from inside.  It was a blustery and chilly night.  We'll have to come back when the weather is more favorable, and sit outside like we initially planned.  This isn't a vegan restaurant, but they did have options. We had- Vegetable Dumplings:  They were soft pillows of deliciousness. Pineapple Tofu In Basket:  crisp tofu, sesame seeds, pineapple sauce.  Vegetarian Szechuan Mapo Tofu: asian vegetables, pickled cabbage, szechuan pepper corn. The food was really good, but where they stood out for us was the service. Service was top notch! In fact it was the best service I've ever had in a restaurant.  Thank you for having vegan options!  We dined 5-7-2016",0.9876,0.872,0.12,0.008,0.39539976484420936

2016-03-23,4.0,"""Everyone eats and drinks.  Yet only a few appreciate the taste of food."" - Confucius My mom and partner in crime were in the mood for Chinese food.  In their minds (egg rolls, pork spare ribs, pork fried rice).... In my mind... something more amazing than Americanized. Voted Chicagos' best Chinese/ Cantonese (authentic) restaurant, I had to try it.  Its' received great reviews.  A bit on the pricey side, but we made do.  Upon entering this 1930's-esque upscale setting, we were sat closer to the front door and across the service entrance.  Thank goodness it was not a romantic date.  The table has cloth mats, ornate chopsticks, and mini ship chopstick holders.  Attention to detail.  Of course, nothing expected less with Peninsula hotels.   Our server is beyond helpful, and well versed.  He is not pretentious or even snooty.  Normally I would have a few glasses of recommended wine, but I'm on medication from a recent surgery.  Our server recommends a light and very refreshing Virgin Ning Sling made with orange, lychee, fresh mint passion fruit, soda.  ($9, pretty stiff, no pun intended for a non alcoholic beverage).   We start with dim sum.  Spicy beef potstickers ($13)  Four in a steam basket.  Mildly spicy, the dumpling itself was a little chewy.  Tastes good, but I've had better. Grade B.  Foie gras and duck dumplings ($14), also four in a steam basket.  Purple chewy (maybe taro?) sticky texture but with an incredibly flavorful minced filling, and the hoisin sauce goes perfect.  I give these an A, highly recommend.  The shrimp spring rolls ($13) have a light flaky exterior and tightly rolled served with a sweet orangey sauce (I won't dare call it duck sauce - quack lol).  Tasty.  Give it a B+, I recommend this too.   I opted for the Wok Fried Asian Vegetables with Roasted Garlic ($16) Chinese broccoli with garlic sauce and cloves of garlic.  Cut for me, so I don't look crazy trying to shove the entire stalk and bulb in my mouth.  Ahhhh.  Grade - A. Mom had the wonton soup ($16), beautiful wonton dumplings, plenty of them.  Tasty broth. B+ Shanghai Terrace Fried Rice ($18) wagyu beef, shrimp, with chicken instead of the duck, taro, onion, egg.  Very tasty.  You can tell that they rinse their rice first, giving it a better separated perfect texture.  Good sized portion!  B+ Shanghai Fried Noodle ($18) shrimp, pork, chicken, peppers, basil, premium lime soy.  Tasty, and no lack of toppings throughout the dish.  Grade A.   Staff is right onto of everything, even the busier notices our water and fills it before asking.  Anticipating our needs before we do.  A+  Because I pretty much never say no to dessert, I said we'll share the Shanghai dessert trio.  Blood orange yuzu pavlova, Strawberry Coconut Yuzu verrine, and mango passion dumplings.($15)  I might sound like a dessert critic here, but only because I have been making pastries a good portion of my life, and am able to dissect them with a keen palate.  The blood orange sorbet was on point.  No crystallization here, smooth.  Set inside a yuzu (Japanese citrus) cremeaux filled pavlova (meringue vessel).  The best option in my opinion.  The Strawberry layered verrine (glass shooter) was okay, the coconut was good, but could have packed more punch.  Unfortuntely the little donut ball on the top (as I tried sharing by cutting in half with my fork was as hard as a rock).  The server told me it may have been refrigerated.  Note:  do not refrigerate your balls!  Fresh and always sealed tight.  Refrigeration of baked goods makes them hard and inedible.  The dumplings, cute and skewered, a little sticky, rolled in sesame seeds were okay, and in a ramekin of mango/passion puree.  Not too well thought out.  A bit chewy.  I notified the server, and he apologized and it was removed from the bill.  Service A++ outstanding.   Also, like any good server, he brought this to the attention of the manager and the chef.  As a chef, if you don't know something isn't right, how can you fix it?",0.9991,0.754,0.202,0.044,0.5658610567514676

2015-09-11,5.0,"The combination of restful setting, superb food and faultless service make this Chicago's best Chinese restaurant, and one of its top restaurants overall. It's particularly delightful when it's warm enough to eat on the terrace, a surprisingly serene environment considering it's just a half dozen or so floors above Michigan Avenue. We put ourselves in our waiter's hands, and he assembled a delightful multi-course meal for us. We began with an assortment of six pieces of dim sum, individually plated for each of us. This item is not listed on the menu (nor is any form of dim sum sampler) so it is worth asking about. Although I am not a huge dim sum fan, this was clearly the best I have ever had; each was light and flavorful, and even the crab rangoon managed to be delicate and appealing. Next we shared a split serving of hot and sour soup, also the best I've had, with less vinegar and more broth flavor. Plenty of tender lobster chunks made it special. Peking duck is available in a full or half portion, and the half is perfect for sharing as an appetizer. It's served with the traditional cucumber, scallions, pancakes and sauces, but the duck was so perfect we ate most of it by itself. Crispy skin and no layer of fat at all made it among the best duck dishes I've had. Next time I might try the five spice duck to compare it. For entrees we shared scallops in black truffle sauce, and a spicy shrimp dish. Both were good, and were different from anything else we'd had, but I felt the preceding courses were better. Perhaps the highlight of the meal was an amazing red rice dish that I didn't see on the menu. It was vegetarian, and included various nuts, broccoli and other tidbits, and had a rich, mouth-filling flavor that was remarkable. I would definitely ask for this again. Finally we finished with a fruit and sorbet plate. Our waiter added a bit of coconut sorbet, which turned out to be the highlight. A well-conceived wine list offers many selections designed to accompany the food, including a small half bottle section. Wine prices are erratic, with some barely above retail, and others sky high, so careful browsing is required, but will be rewarded. This was a great meal, and I'm sure we will return often to this surprising oasis in the midst of the city.",0.9982,0.758,0.226,0.016,0.49722726127488037

However, it is safe to say that theirs is definitely in my top 3. The dong po pork belly was really intricate in design but this made it less authentic.

Starters:  Dim Sum Trio - vegetable spring roll, crab dumpling and beef pot sticker I thought all three were good and nicely presented.  Lobster Hot and Sour Soup with tofu, spinach, bamboo shoots and spring onion The soup was not balanced at all. I kept trying to finish it, but I couldn't because it was way too sour.  Entree: Shredded Beef Tenderloin with ginger, scallion and oyster sauce This was my favorite dish of the night. The beef was delicious and extremely tender.  Dessert: Asian Pear Tatin - macadamia cake, pineapple cream and mandarin sorbet I didn't finish the dessert either. The sorbet and cake were good, but the pear was very hard to eat. I expected it to be a lot softer in texture. Drinks:  Sour Cherry Old Fashion - orange infused makers mark, ginger ale, sweetened cherries and thyme The drink was too strong for me so I asked my server if the bartender could add more ginger ale. Service: Our server was very friendly and I liked how she explained every dish that came out.   Ambiance: It's a beautiful restaurant. I imagine it being a fun place to go to during the summer months. I expected more from a fine dining restaurant. I've had much better Chinese food for a lot less money.

The Wagyu beef was good, Kung pao chicken was very average and Happy rice should have been sent back, but wasn't.

However, as our dinner progressed, we noticed that the servers have disappeared, leaving us to wait for any kind of response for a long time. I also noticed that I was the ONLY Asian patron in an Asian restaurant (which is usually a bad sign, if you want authentic, great food). We started getting antsy and irritated as we just wanted to leave. We had to flag someone down to get our main server to give us our check.  Yes, the food was delicious, but severely overpriced. Over $17 for a small serving of fried rice? I mean, sure, there were big chunks of shrimp, but that is uncalled for, even if the restaurant is situated in the Peninsula Hotel. Frankly, I've had better food at hole-in-the wall restaurants elsewhere. The pork buns were tender, but not any better to warrant $10 for two.  Will I ever go back?

Having said that, I was not impressed by the food. The ingredients used in its dishes were not truly Chinese (e.g. button mushrooms in lieu of shitake/dong gu, no true Chinese vegetables were used in the noodles and stir fries - think broccoli instead of bok choy).

I would suggest sharing the dishes: the portions of the entrees can be huge, and its usually better to share one entree and order a few apps or dim sum plates, rather than trying to power through a mountain of meat/veggies/etc.  Our most recent visit was for valentines day: although we love eating on the terrace, the seats inside are nice as well. I accidentally spilled my drink (I'm a klutz), and they replaced our table cloth and brought a new drink. I was mortified, but also really impressed. We finished the meal and were given a box of tasty macarons and a stuffed dog with a heart (for valentines day).

I usually don't look forward to visiting any Chinese restaurants, because the experience plain stinks. Uninspired dining environment, but more significantly, food that is usually overly oily and with clearly lowest quality ingredients, including chicken from weird parts of chickens and pale, sad vegetables, not to mention gloopy overly thickened sauces. Shanghai Terrace at The Peninsula Chicago finally delivered a positive Chinese food experience! Dim sum were colorful, tender, and elegantly prepared. But the kung pao chicken and kung pao prawns! Yum!! I love the Chef here! Finally, sauces that don't overwhelm or drown the ingredients, and actual quality vegetables and proteins. Truly the best kung pao experience. Plus when I requested extra peanuts, they exceeded my expectations. A delicious forkful of peanuts plus tender chicken pieces and delicious bell peppers, with every bite. I can go crazy for peanuts sometimes. :) Such a simple dish, but exceptionally prepared here. I guess for $30+ for kung pao, might be a little lower on the value scale, but sometimes the price is worth it when I have never had this type of Chinese food experience anywhere else, period. Service walks the line between casual and stuffy. I do think the dining room layout is a little awkward as you can pretty much stare at anyone else in the room and vice versa, but at least you can usually have a fair view of their terrace which they keep well groomed with tasteful plants.

2014-06-10,4.0,"The decor was great.  The food was very good and very well executed although perhaps not the most memorable.  I would take guests there if they requested Chinese cuisine, but ST wouldn't be at the top of the list without that preference. Review of dishes shared by my wife and me: Foie Gras & Duck Dumpling - Phenomenal. Best thing we had during our visit. So decadent, so good. Green Leaves Shrimp Dumpling - Good. Restaurants often fumble here--too often I've had dry, sticky rice paper combined with bland shrimp; but ST pulled this off well. That being said, not sure I'd recommend them since they didn't feel as special as expected (and certainly couldn't compare to the foie gras dumplings). Crispy Duck - Very good. Perfectly cooked and juicy with crispy skin -- just how it should be.  Well executed, but in the end, not exactly life changing.  Would recommend though. Kung Pao Prawns - Excellent. Great flavor profile, very high-quality prawns. The perfect amount of spiciness and restraint with the trimmings. The prawns are clearly the star here and the chef knows how to use the other features of the dish to play on the flavor and texture of the prawns. And when you're making a star, the quality better be there, and they delivered. Highly recommended. Pineapple Yuzu - Good. Not much to say here. If you're in the mood for a dessert with pineapple, yuzu, and coconut flavors, you can't go wrong here. That being said, wish it had slightly more of a ginger presence. As for the service, it was.....odd, for lack of a better word. The wait staff was extremely attentive and very knowledgeable, but our waiter very strongly pushed us toward the ""safe"" options on the menu. I attempted to order the Three Ways Cold Appetizer and he very strongly discouraged me from doing so--instead pointing us toward the ""fan favorites."" While I haven't spent any time in China, my wife and I have spent a fair amount of time in Asia (Japan, Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, etc.) We like to try interesting, new things (only thing I've categorically disliked: diced cubes of congealed blood). So a bit of a shame that he discouraged us from venturing deeper into the menu, at least for one dish.  Related, our waiter made comments that bordered on condescension. For example: ""Did you like the foie gras? Most people aren't too sure about trying it, but I tell them that it's just duck."" We never expressed any reservation over foie gras, and yes, we understand what foie gras is. I don't think I've had it in Chinese cuisine before, but I've had my fair share of foie gras. Another example, after we ordered the Pineapple Yuzu dessert: ""Oh, yuzu--it's a Japanese citrus.""  Yes....we know. We know, we just ordered it. All in all though, the waiter's (most likely unintentional) condescension never felt mean spirited, and my wife and I laughed it off. I didn't feel like it was egregious enough to warrant docking any ratings, and really, seemed like he was only trying to help.",0.9986,0.721,0.223,0.056,0.580822801750221

2014-02-27,3.0,"Prior to my visit to Shanghai Terrace, I have had meals in all the restaurants in Peninsula Chicago. With the exception of Pierre Gourmet, I have an impression that the Peninsula restaurants tend to provide good service, yet mediocre food. It seems that the chefs often focus on the appearance rather than the flavors of the food. Desiring to give the Peninsula restaurants a benefit of the doubt, I invited my friend to go to the Shanghai Terrace. Among all the Peninsula Chicago restaurants, the Shanghai Terrace has the most elegant decor. The fusion between the Chinese and Western furnitures and artwork makes me feels as if I were in Peninsula Hong Kong.  The view of the garden was spectacular, and I would recommend Yelpers having meals there on a day with nice weather.  Compared to the food in other Peninsula Chicago restaurants, the food at the Shanghai Terrace was good, yet not memorable. First of all, I appreciate the chefs did not add MSG in the food. Shanghai Terrace is the only Chinese restaurant I have been in Chicago that does not use MSG. Second of all, I applaud the chefs for creating authentic Chinese flavor. Note that despite of its namesake, the restaurant provides authentic Cantonese food rather than Shanghainese food. Putting the origin of the food aside, my friend and I greatly enjoyed the dim sum platter. If you had covered my eyes during my meal, I would have thought that I was eating in HK. Third of all, I am amazed that the Shanghai Terrace serves the bird nest soup. Frankly speaking, this is the sole Chinese restaurant that I have been in the States so far that provides this dish. With all my compliments, why would I say that the food is not memorable? Why would I only give the restaurant three stars? First, although the food in Shanghai Terrace was good, it was extremely overpriced. The meal costs me and my friend around 1000 dollars. I could have had the same meal in HK or other cities with half, if not a third, of the price. Second, even though the food was authentic, it tended to be sweeter than regular Chinese food. The chef had added too much syrup in my soup that he covered the flavor of the bird nest. The ratio between the soup and the bird near was also not proportional. Finally, albeit that the Shanghai Terrace only had few customers that day, the waiters seem to ignore my friend and my requests for tea and food. Considering how much we were paying for the meal, the service should have been better. Yelpers, if you plan to visit the Shanghai Terrace, you should be ready that the meal is going to be pricey. Since the restaurant is often booked for private events, I suggest you making reservations in advance. I recommend this restaurant, under the circumstance that you are allergic to MSG like I do, and want to try out dishes that few other Chinese restaurants would offer. P.S.

2013-09-20,3.0,"I'm not quite sure why this place is called Shanghai Terrace since most of the food isn't Shanghai style but rather Cantonese... But it is very yummy, just not for the price (which brought down the rating from 4 stars to 3).  If you are there for dim sum and are Asian or have been to Chinatown before, the items are severely overpriced for what they are (but do try the interesting foie gras and duck dumplings!). As a result, you would be disappointed so only go if you want exquisitely presented Chinese food at over the top prices. Ambience:  Definitely romantic with the oriental decorations and dimmed lighting.  Also, you should dress business casual unless you want to stand out in a tshirt or shorts. Service:  most of the waiters are from China or Hong Kong and are kind, but our particular waitress seemed to have some issues understanding what we were asking for.  They also didn't come to our table very often, and we literally had to wave to grab their attention (and this was a Thursday night). Food:  the cocktails are superb (I highly recommend Ning Sling).  The dim sum is alright, with Shanghai style soup dumplings that have a ton of flavor it a lack of soup.  For entrees, I would highly recommend the crispy duck even though it's pricey (compared to the same duck you'd get in Chinatown).  For dessert, we had mooncakes since it was the Mid Autumn festival - these were some of the best ones I've ever had!  The fluffy and light pastries were stuffed with a rich, egg custard.  Mmm mmm mmm!",0.9935,0.767,0.188,0.045,0.5172420634920635

Of course, the expert landscaping of greenery and bright flowers, relaxing and comfortable cabanas made for a nicely balanced area. The service is spectacular as expected. I knew the food prices were going to be high, but the drinks were definitely the most expensive I've had in the city. I think a couple of our cocktails were on average $20. We had dim sum here, and it was excellent - making the traditional items into unique and creative palate pleasing pieces. You will not find most of these items made like this in Chinatown. We had the pea shoot & prawn dumpling, shrimp & chive potsticker, scallop bean curd sheet, seafood siewmai, sea treasure dumpling, pan fried turnip cake, roasted peking duck & pork, stuffed sugar pea with shrimp, fried eggplant with shrimp, spicy crab cold noodles, duck salad, chicken fried rice with salty fish, They made sure to customize our order to accommodate our odd numbered group as most things come in quantities of 2. It is certainly a treat to come here for a meal. My only gripe was that the food took a very long time to cook. Each time we placed an order it took about 40-45 minutes to arrive. I understand that meals should not be rushed, but there are other things that we'd like to do and this said from a food lover that could eat all day. There are just some traditional dim sum items that are staples for me that are not on the menu here that I absolutely love. It is certainly a different experience when I think of the fanfare of the carts rolling by and having lids lifted open to see all the many surprises and having the immediate gratification of eating the items that I chose as opposed to a waiter coming out with a tray of the items I had to order and wait for.

We got to the restaurant, were seated outside on the terrace right away, then someone came over immediately to offer us water. So far so good. Then it went downhill from there. I had to ask for cocktail menu. Really? Shouldn't that come with whatever menu that was handed to me? Then we waited 10 minutes for our waitress to come over and take orders. And it's really not THAT busy at the restaurant. Wonder what she's been doing all along. We ordered the shanghai dumpling, bbq pork bun, spicy cold crab noodle, and roasted peking duck and pork, and pan fried stuffed sea scallop.

The best thing we had on the menu.  - Spicy cold crab noodle: there's absolutely no spic to it at all. The noodle had a stale texture that indicated it had been in the fridge for too long.  - Bbq pork bun: this tasted exactly like some store bought buns that I heat up at home in the microwave. Not only it didn't taste like homemade by the restaurant, I was suspecting the chef went to Chinatown and bought them from the supermarket there. - Pan fried stuffed sea scallop: this was nasty. It's more like tempura scallop, very salty, not a tiny trace of fresh scallop. Another store bough item in my opinion. Then we waited and waited and they took away our plates. The waitress came back and asked if we wanted dessert. Huh, I thought I ordered roasted peking duck and pork also? I asked her, she said ohh yeah, you did, but I forgot to put it in. So I repeated, but I did order it right? She said yes, but I forgot to put it in. Ok, at that point, I really didn't want that dish anymore. BUT it's really unacceptable for a place like this to ""forget"" put in my order. I was tempted to talk to the manager, my husband said I was being too harsh... I don't think so.

The restaurant is very nice and cozy, with an impeccable staff. The food is beyond words, so I'll leave it at that. I always try different things when we go, but since the Crispy Duck, Shanghai Noodles, Foi Gras Dumplings, and Lamb (?) are fresh in my head, I'll highly recommend those in particular. It's possible to go here and have a moderately priced meal, but I'd recommend waiting until you can splurge and try a handful of items. Definitely give it a try if you're visiting Chicago, or just looking for somewhere new to dine in town. Get reservations, and dress upscale.",0.9625,0.829,0.152,0.018,0.5281105169340463

The big beautiful gold room is the Terrace restaurant.  Shanghai Terrace is around to the right and down a few stairs. Red door. (It was hard to find so I thought I'd give a few directions.) By the way, we were seated inside (November!) looking at the outdoor terrace which looks great for summer. The hostess said they will have a skating rink there for the winter. We were greeted graciously.  They checked our coats with no little tags or wait.  Beautiful table setting, especially the chopstick holder.  Our waiter came promptly.  He greeted us by name, which he obviously got from the reservation...but he almost pronounced it correctly. This is impressive as our name is very Polish and hard to pronounce.  He asked if we were ""comfortable"" with chopsticks or should he bring silverware. We started with the new fashioned cocktail.  I really liked. Hubby thought slightly too sweet.  He switched to wine after that.  They were great at very subtly and gently up selling another glass of wine, dessert, etc.  But never pushy--just good quiet service. Very classy. Our waiter was knowledgeable and explained things well.  We began with two dim sum orders: spicy beef gyoza  (marvelous, with a great ginger-vinegar sauce) and seared pork dumplings (very juicy as they are infused with chicken broth).  Both were good but  I give a slight nod to the gyoza for more flavor. Then we shared the duck and bbq pork.  Both were cooked perfectly.  The pork bbq flavor was great and the meat was tender and juicy.  Then we shared the happy red rice and beef tenderloin.  The glaze on the beef was excellent and it, too, was extremely tender.  The red rice was good--very finely chopped with cool little things like pistachios in it, but I would prefer a bit more flavor in it. Overall, the food was a ""4""--very well done but in general could amp up the flavors a bit more. Why a ""5"" then? The decor and the service. The service was impeccable from beginning to end.

We tried several of the dim sum and appetizer items first and really liked just about everything we ordered.  The spicy beef gyoza dumplings were so delicious, as was the ginger fried rice and sticky bacon rice.  We ordered a couple of cocktails, the New Fashioned and the Sing Sling (or something like that).  The New Fashioned was waaay too strong and tasted like whiskey on the rocks.  It was supposed to have ginger soda and some other mixes to offset the bourbon, but all we could taste was the bourbon.  The other drink was actually outstanding and we ordered several more of these.  It had mandarin vodka, mint and passionfruit in it.  So tasty! For our entrees, we ordered the Hong Kong Style Beef and it was exquisitely yummy.  Basically, it's a very high quality cut of filet mignon marinated and drenched in a tangy sauce.  My wife had the prawns and really enjoyed hers as well. The waiter recommended the coconut custard for dessert and we were glad he did.  This was so refreshing and delicious after a spicy meal.  We really enjoyed our experience here and will definitely come back. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that even with a ""Shanghai validated"" valet ticket, it still cost us $23 to valet, plus a $5 tip.  I have no idea what it would have cost us without the validation, but when there's a garage around the corner for $11 all day, it's hard to not feel taken advantage of by these guys.  It really put a downer on a very nice experience.",0.9951,0.793,0.178,0.029,0.6119522497704315

Two additional interesting points: 1) The night I dined, the ""terrace"" was divided, with a wedding on the other side.  If you're the kind of person who likes your meal accompanied by a DJ's announcements and wedding music, this place is for you!  All in, if you love good food, and things like the above make you laugh instead of make you angry, this is a good choice for a fancy dinner.   2) When they turn people away (which you can hear them do) they tell them that they are ""fully committed""  (other reviews mention this phrase as well)- I love this line!  Fully committed to what?  We're fully committed to denying you service?  We're fully committed to the local asylum.  I mean, committed of a transitive verb - if you're going to use it, at least tell me what direct object you're implying.  (I assume they mean ""we're fully committed to other customers?).",0.9955,0.73,0.215,0.055,0.5629032258064516

Perhaps when we went it was ""let's give the new people a chance"" night, however for the price much more is expected.

I would definitely go back because the food was delicious, but I would make a reservation next time. After 1.5 hours of being there, the restaurant was even less crowded when we arrived, which actually irritated me more since it was well over 90 degrees that evening.

2012-01-14,5.0,"Two words (three?): Gourmet dim sum! Located in the Peninsula Hotel on the fourth floor, Shanghai Terrace serves up some scintillating dim sum adding the gourmet touch on traditional dim sum plates. Having gone from Uptown to digging through new and old Chinatown, dim sum is #1 on my list of favorite cuisines. In Shanghai Terrace's private dining room there was no shortage of beautiful art lining the walls as well as a simple, yet distinguished table set up. The decor was a throwback to the 1940's, and it felt like a scene out the neonoir classic, Chinatown. We were introduced to a refreshing cocktail before dinner and soon after came a dazzling array of dim sum enough to whet this veteran's appetite! Chef de Cuisine Ivan Yuen guided us through the dim sum meal with recommendations on which dipping sauce to use for maximum impact on the palate. The dim sum was served with a vinegar, hoisin, and hot sauce - traditional sauces for complementing a classic dim sum meal. The Shanghai Dumpling offered a hot broth in the dumpling, which surprisingly the perfect refreshment for freezing outdoor conditions. When indulging in such table delights, it's best recommended to take your time to chew your food extra carefully to extract the maximum flavor and enjoy the texture of refined gourmet dim sum. After eating this gourmet dim sum, you might ask me what was my favorite? Hands down it was the shrimp and chive dumpling, it was the perfect blend of traditional dim sum colliding with the high quality gourmet touch with fresh shrimp, light oil, and a texture that just left my mouth remembering every bite. Most of the table I would say agreed, which is to say that if you get the opportunity to order Shanghai Terrace's shrimp and chive dumpling: do it! Who could resist the family style dishes over at Shanghai Terrace? Dishes of steamed market fish, Kung Pao chicken, Hong Kong Beef Tenderloin appeared along with simple ginger garlic fried rice. The Ying and the Yang was notable with some dishes with oil being the main flavor for some of the Kung Pao and rice while a deeper sauce worked in the flavor for the beef and the fish. There's a certain degree of poetry and artistry that matched the decor that could be appreciated with dinner. Dinner was accompanied by new best friend Clos La Chance and dessert consisted of chocolates and a very subtle pistachio parfait which featured pineapple in a green sauce with coconut pearls. In summary, Shanghai Terrace lives up to vaunted expectation in terms of food and service.

We were very satisfied with our experience.  I do want to start off by saying that it is a little pricey, and some may find that hard to swallow.  But you know you are going to get quality ingredients and likely no surprises.   We started off with cocktails, I had the ning sling, my boyfriend had the white martini.  Both (esp. mine) were very good!  We had 2 dim sum - the shanghai dumplings & the shrimp & chive dumplings.  They were both very good (albeit a little pricey).  We had the three treasures appetizer which I liked better than my boyfriend.  We then had the sichuan prawns, the beef tenderloin, and fried noodles.  Everything was so delicious!

2011-08-28,5.0,"This is a wonderful venue for a special occasion, which is why I was here! We made advance reservations for dinner on Open Table but came a little early to sit on the terrace and have some cocktails. I had the ""Pen 10"" cocktail with gin, lychee liquor, green tea-infused syrup and fresh lemon juice. My companion enjoyed the Ning Sling, which is Absolut Mandarin, lychee, fresh mint and passion fruit. Yum! We then moved on to some champagne. We were having such a lovely time that we wanted to enjoy dinner on the terrace as well. The manager was very gracious and accommodating (we has arrived much earlier than our reservations). Service was impeccable.  We began with the Peking Duck, which you don't necessarily need to order in advance, though there was some confusion about that. We were given the option to have either a tasting menu with Peking Duck, a platter of the duck, or just an appetizer. We went with the appetizer and found the portion to be quite generous. You are given mooshu pancakes, scallions and sliced cucumber together with plum and duck sauces. It was rather delicious. We also enjoyed the shrimp and chive dumplings, which are steamed and served with a Sriracha-type hot sauce and a hoisin sauce. They're a little challenging to eat with chopsticks (because they're too large to shove in your mouth whole, as much as you may want to do so). For entrees we shared the Sichuan green beans (coral crab, spicy toban, chaozhounese cucumbers) and the Shanghai fried noodles, which I believe had basil, ginger, sesame oil, shrimp, pork and chicken. Everything was delicious and we ordered just the right amount of food. Because we'd each had a cocktail and three (!) glasses of champagne, there was no room for dessert. When they bring the check, though, they bring banana and coconut infused chocolates--a nice bite-sized treat! So our total was somewhere around $260 (I'm guessing--I have to verify and will update if I'm wildly off target). It was worth every penny!",0.9972,0.782,0.2,0.018,0.6147186147186147

2011-07-09,4.0,"Shanghai Terrace is two spaces: a restaurant with both indoor tables and perhaps a dozen outdoor tables with views of the Hancock Building and others on Michigan; and a cocktail lounge outside. We started with drinks on the terrace and moved inside for dinner, as the outdoor tables were fully booked.  The terrace is wonderful on a warm summer night for the views, lights, people watching, and comfort. There is sophisticated tropical decor, and the widely spaced apart tables and couches under canopies offer separation and privacy while still providing a festive atmosphere. The specialty drink menu is a little limited and our drinks were weak. Next time, I would order wine, or send back my drink. Drinks are not over-priced given the location. Service was extremely polite and the maitre d took pains to ensure we got a good indoor table after drinks. We noted a number of ""first dates"" occurring on the terrace--and recommend it for that. Dining was a mixed experience. The food quality was extremely high, commensurate with the prices. We had savory steamed dumplings and a fish dish with a delicious dashi-soy-ginger broth. It is great to see lighter dishes done well with punchy flavor. However, the dining service was substandard for the Peninsula; our server seemed to have too many tables as there were long periods of no attention; one order for a glass of wine was taken by one server but never delivered, and had to be grabbed by a second server from the Terrace, causing another delay because of the long walk out there. I will definitely return, but not in tourist season, to ensure the staff isn't unduly pressured. After dinner we adjourned to the Peninsula's indoor breakfast space, which was set up with a $40/person chocolate dessert buffet extravaganza.

2010-12-04,5.0,"A trust fund or an expense account will come in handy when visiting Chicago's most sophisticated Chinese dining room. Nestled underneath The Peninsula Chicago's soaring lobby, Shanghai Terrace serves refined renditions of Amero-Chinese classics, a well-edited selection of modern Chinese food, and several classic Shanghai and Cantonese dishes, including a small choice of dim sum. I have never had the multi-course duck dinner, but other sources report that it is tasty. It is a real joy to organize a traditional banquet dinner with the restaurant's competent staff. Preset menus for large groups start at a nearly astronomical price for familiar preparations of standard proteins, and the addition of more sophisticated foodstuffs like abalone and squab increases your bill geometrically. However, the kitchen is happy to work with you to customize a dinner if you have any favorites, like wu xi pork belly or lobster in X.O. sauce. In general, I am not a fan of Asian desserts. I'll leave the sweets to the Europeans, thank you. But Shanghai Terrace puts out an excellent contemporary Eastern dessert, so save room. Two great food local food tragedies are that Shanghai Terrace long ago suspended its weekend yum cha dim sum service, the best in Chicago by a long shot. Previously, on a steamy summer day on the Terrace you could close your eyes, sink into a har gow, and believe you were in Hong Kong. In addition, the loss of lunch hours in colder months is a shame.

2010-08-26,3.0,"We chose the 3-course Peking Duck meal.  I want to say it was around $130 for two people. We chose the Carved Roasted Peking Duck (of course), the Duck Soup, and the Wok Fried Peking Duck & Duck Fried Rice.  They also gave us a complimentary 4th course in the Tofu Cheesecake, which was very gracious. I had a feeling that we were going to finish the meal, and wished we had just gone to Sun Wah instead, and spent a quarter of the bill. My gut feeling was correct. Overall, the food and quality was clearly much better at Shanghai Terrace, but for the price, not so much.   The flavors of the duck are similar at Sun Wah, but at Shanghai Terrace, it's less oily, which I liked much more. Also, here at ST they served the first course with thin pancakes (think mu-shu pancakes), whereas at SW they used those cushy pillows of man-tou buns.  I think I actually prefer the pancakes, because the man-tou can get a little wet and slimy.  I prefer the toppings at SW, as they provide some pickled veggies. The second course was the soup -- this was a knockout at ST.  They soup base was wonderful and surprisingly tomato-y, but the highlight were the gluten rice dumplings, filled with duck.  If you've ever had chinese rice ball desserts (tong yuen), it's the same coating. A nice surprise to the meal, for sure. The third course was the least memorable.  I thought it would be a combined fried rice with the duck (like at SW), but it was actually two separate dishes -- a fried rice AND a stir fried duck.  The stir fry was good for a chinese dish, but typical.  The fried rice was light and needed more seasoning.  I was tempted to ask for a bottle of soy sauce, but thought that might be too low class of me (like asking for salt and pepper at Alinea). The dessert was light and surprisingly tasty.  The tofu added to the lightness, although true cheesecake lovers might snort at this substitution. All in all, I wouldn't go out of my way to dine here again.  Though the dim sum does spark my interest, I imagine I'll have the same reaction as I did to the Peking Duck -- better than Chinatown quality-wise, but not worth the price hike.",0.9945,0.839,0.146,0.015,0.4556878306878307

I don't remember the names of the appetizers they brought out, but they weren't the common quiches and bacon-wrapped gross things. They had things like bite sized shu-mai's and ha-gows that were presented beautifully and pretty good to boot. The food is actually quite good as chinese food goes. Not over the top greasy, but just very well thought out and prepared chinese food. Not that we had anything very unique or authentic there--kung pao chicken, beef tenderloin with mushrooms and oyster sauce, steamed pike, and baby bok choi, each with a bowl of garlic fried rice. Sounds very Americanized, right? Well, regardless, it was pretty good. Vegetables were tender, beef tenderloin was cooked medium and really tender, and the pike was very excellent--tasted fresh and the sauce mix (I forget the style that it's called) was so good. I definitely thought they used a bit much MSG though--I'm pretty keen on that, knowing how I personally react to it with droopy eyelids and the tendency to want to fall asleep after eating a lot of it. Now, I'd say if this place charged like $7-8 a plate for their dishes, it would probably a 4 star rating. But given the fact that its extremely fancy there, in the Peninsula Hotel, I really doubt that that would be the case. Its saving grace is the fact that the ambiance is excellent, the service is top notch (for the lunch reception, we asked for seconds and thirds and they gladly complied and brought out freshly prepared food for us, sometimes without asking!).

2009-07-18,4.0,"I wanted to take my wife somewhere she had never been for her birthday.  A difficult task given her many dining experiences throughout the city, but one I wanted to do nonetheless.  I have grown somewhat weary of the usual steak / seafood / sushi that we usually order and wanted to try something a little different.  After a solid recommendation from a food connoisseur  co-worker I settled on Shanghai Terrace in the Peninsula Hotel.   A big draw to the restaurant is dining out on the terrace that overlooks an eastern view of the city.  Unfortunately, alfresco dining was not an option for us because it was a little cold outside, however the main dinging room was almost as nice and we still had a somewhat decent view of the city.  After a little cajoling from the waitress we both ordered the 5 course duck service.  At first, I was a apprehensive about ordering the duck because I thought that 4 courses (4 duck courses and 1 desert course) of similar food would get old, but in the end I was curious how the would pull it off, so I went ahead and ordered it anyways.  Every course of duck was tasty.  I guess it never occurred to me that duck could be prepared so many different ways.  There was enough variety in the courses to keep my taste buds interested.  The service itself was pretty solid.  There are a number of reviews on Yelp that criticize the wait staffs punctuality or lack of attention, however we did not experience this at all on our visit.  I could scarcely get up to go the bathroom before one of the wait staff would rush over to fold my napkin.  I don't know why.. but for some reason I really like having my napkin folded for me.   We ended up spending around $300 for the meal and drinks, a bit steep for a recession, but fair given the quality of the food and the location.  There are not many places in the city that can serve duck as well as this one.  I will definitely be back if I ever get a hankering for duck.",0.9395,0.86,0.093,0.047,0.5027777777777778

We decided to take in the unseasonably cool weather and do the 8x8 appetizers and drinks (4 apps, 4 drinks, each for $8).

Good thing because the portions were tiny. 10 minutes in we were talking about getting hot dogs on State Street. Service was also really bad. There were a couple people there clearly trying their hardest and I felt bad for them but that doesn't make up for the fact that most of the staff seemed clueless or would disappear for long stretches at a time. I'm not usually uppity about this, but if you're asking me to drop $8 on 4 pieces of finger food and $7.50 for a bottle of Becks, I guess I would expect the ""experience"" to be better.

2008-08-04,2.0,"Saturday night was absolutely beautiful and we decided to sit outside and dine on Shanghai Terrace's enormous terrace (that sounded redundant). The menu is fairly lengthy both in the number of menu items and it's actual physical length.  The staff encourages you to dine family style, which I am typically strongly opposed to. I mean if there is a dish on the menu that I want; I order it and expect to eat it all. I hate having to share with somebody who took a chance and lost on some dish and then expects to fill his or her tummy with mine (End of Rant)!   Our server started us off with an amuse bouche of a bit sized tart filled with peking duck.  It reminded me of a really good pot pie.  We started off with the Duck Salad and the Shanghainese Trio.  The Duck Salad was served in a crispy wonton bowl and topped with citrus truffle vinaigrette. I didn't think the vinaigrette was going to work, but it was a hit.  The salad was delicious.  On the other hand the Shanghainese Trio was a miss for me.  It consisted of small portions of Marinated Jellyfish, Peking Duck, and something really weird, chewy, and crunchy.  Going into this dish I knew that I wasn't going to like the jelly fish, but I had no clue how much I wasn't going to like the mystery portion at the far side of the platter.  To be fair, Audrey enjoyed the jelly fish and the mystery meat.  Audrey and I also split the Hot and Sour Lobster Soup, which I felt lacked flavor.  For our entrees we went with the Kung Pao Chicken and the Wok Seared Beef Tenderloin.  The Kung Pao Chicken was cooked perfectly moist. However, the flavors were average at best.  I'll stick with my $5.95 kung pao that comes with fried rice and an egg roll.  The Wok Seared Beef Tenderloin was amazing!  The meat once again was cooked perfectly and the black pepper sauce was lick it up at the end good.  The vegetables were also cooked perfectly.  We washed it all down with a lovely bottle of Riesling. We finished the evening with the Banana Cake with Caramelized Pineapple and Lemon Grass Sorbet.  The cake was moist and bananariffic! However, the Lemon Grass Sorbet stole the show.  It was delicious, refreshing, and a perfect end to a romantic al fresco dinner. The interior of the space reminded me of my travels through China.  They did a great job of making it look like a traditional Chinese restaurant without making it a caricature of one. As I mentioned earlier we sat outside on the terrace, where unfortunately the Chinese theme didn't really carry over.  The terrace is beautiful though and perfect for a night like Saturday. The service was a bit odd. I hate to say it but the language barrier really prevented the service from living up to the price tag.  The biggest knock was that I asked to speak to the sommelier to discuss several wines I was torn between and he never showed.  Several members of the staff came over and asked if I was ready to place my wine order. I let each one of them know that I was waiting to speak to their wine guy.  Finally, after 25 minutes of waiting, one of the servers came by and explained that the sommelier was ""busy upstairs"" and would not be able to make it to our table.   I asked my questions regarding several Rieslings and the server responded simply by saying ""The German Riesling.""  I went with my gut instinct and luckily I choose well.    Unfortunately, several not so tasty items and the lack luster service have left a pretty bad taste in my mouth.  I expected much more for the price.  I would like to give them another try and do their Peking Duck service, but then again maybe not.   1 Appetizer 1 Salad 1 Soup 2 Entrees 1 Bowl of Brown Rice 1 Dessert 1 Bottle of Wine --------------------------- $220.00",0.9973,0.773,0.156,0.071,0.5745232172470978

2008-02-05,2.0,"When my mom came in town from Hong Kong, we went to the Shanghai Terrace hoping for authentic Chinese food. I don't know what it is about Chinese people, but every country we visit, we have to find Chinese food. So I was hoping to take advantage of my mother's visit by taking her to the Chinese restaurant in the Peninsula Hotel, which is a Hong Kong brand hotel. The historic Peninsula in Hong Kong is a landmark, has was turned into a hospital during WW2 while the Japanese were in town, and has hosted Presidents, Sultans, Kings, Queens, Politburo members, etc., and has some of the best restaurants in the world, like Felix. Unfortunately, what we found at the Shanghai Terrace was a limited menu of Americanized dishes. Of course, as Chinese food in America goes, the gourmet nature of the restaurant made its food very tasty. So the food was satisfactory... Though, if I am eating this stuff, I would probably prefer Jade East delivery in lincoln park. Not a single dish from the meal was memorable. I guess that is what ruined it for me. I set my expectations too high... I was hoping that this would be like a top flight Chinese restaurant you would find in a hotel in Hong Kong. Where I could order my favorite dishes that they don't really do well in Chinatown. Like sharks fin soup, steamed fish (and I was hoping that they would do it like HK style where the fish is an endangered species from a marine park in Malaysia).  Is that still the dream?

2007-07-27,4.0,"Prompt and attentive service compliment the fine dining options available at this well appointed, two room Asian restaurant.  While I didn't feel as if  had been transported back to Shanghai, the Shanghai pork dumplings (Xiao Long Bao), not the pork dumplings, as there are two varieties listed on the menu, were the most plump and juicy that I have had outside of Shanghai, including all my experiences with Dim Sum in San Francisco and New York. The restaurant is divided into two long rooms and a patio, of which was not available during our visit due to a private reception.  As another reviewer noted, I can see why he felt it was ""PF Changish"" in the decor, although much more upscale, however, I doubt that PF Changs can beat the $2,500 Fortuny hanging lamps in the back of one of the dining rooms. Aside from the Shanghai pork dumplings, we also had the lobster dumplings and shrimp pot stickers, though  I was not as enamored with the lobster and shrimp.  Dinner consisted of KungPao chicken, which was generous and well seasoned as well as Chili Prawns, which were not quite what I expected.  Since I've dined on authentic chili prawns in Singapore, where I understand that they originated, the ones served were quite upmarket, though good nonetheless.  Spare ribs as an additional appetizer as well as a final course of Pepper Udon finished our meal at Shanghai Terrace.   While prices were mostly reasonable, the overall experience justified the expense.",0.9485,0.877,0.092,0.031,0.4481818181818182
2007-05-04,4.0,"I have eaten here twice now.  The first time was back in January with my best friend to celebrate her engagement.  We enjoyed the new chef's tasting menu.  Memorable plates were the kobe beef - delicious (!) - and the abalone.  The abalone is apparently a delicacy that takes 10 days to cook.  It looks like liver and has the oddest texture...sort of rubbery.  I will try anything once, but apparently this is an acquired taste that I shall never acquire.  As my friend put it, ""it tastes like the sea.""  And she did not mean this in a good way.  We also had the bird's nest soup with chrysanthemum petals.  Perhaps it was the champagne or the wine pairings, but by this point, neither of us could stomach it.  We later found out that bird's nest is not just a name - it is made with an actual bird's nest.  Dim sum was excellent, and I don't usually go for that sort of thing. Last night I went with a group of 6, and had an amazing starter platter with the freshest sashimi ever that just melted in your mouth, a crab won ton puff (maybe peeky-toe?) that was delicious, and delectable sauces artfully arranged to go with everything.  We then had shark fin soup, which to me tasted a lot like chicken. :)  I chose the kung pao prawns as my entree and I was not disappointed.  The prawns were mouthwatering.  We all shared a couple of different types of rice - I preferred the seafood one.  For dessert we all had a sampling of several things which were great - except once again I received the birds nest!  This time I couldn't drink it, since I knew what it was made from.  Wine and champagne were delicious here once again.   Both times our service was impeccable and the food presentation was gorgeous.  Everything you would expect from a restaurant in this high caliber hotel.  I can't wait until it's a bit warmer out - I will return to dine on the terrace! 8/12/08 - there's a new chef now and i have not been back since the old chef left - will update once i return.",0.9983,0.772,0.228,0.0,0.5437232620320854
