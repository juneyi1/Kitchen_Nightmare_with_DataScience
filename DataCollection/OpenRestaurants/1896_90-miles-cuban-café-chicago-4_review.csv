I work in customer service as well and I get it gets busy- but I'm just not supposed to eat now because you can only offer store credit? Whomever is managing this location should really think about having more staff to help because it's very clear your cashier and cooks are overwhelmed...

I dont try to be difficult but in my pictures you will see they did this on purpose. The sandwich looked amazing and the yuca fries smothered in the chimichurri sauce. They kid still came out and saked if i wanted it to go or to eat in. I had already told him i wanted to eat in the place. Talk about service. Im in the industry and seriously hope business owners teach your staff customer service. The cook was talking smack in front of me and the girl that works there told him that i was right there. To stop lol. This is ridiculous. I wanted to send it back but maybe the second time i bet they wouldve all spat on my food. So not coming back. I ate my meal because i payed for it and was hungry.

2017-07-02,5.0,"Dined here with my mother and had the most extraordinary Cubano to date :) This 90 Miles packed a whole lot of flavor and care into a unique space and we Loved it!  The restaurant is too small to accommodate inside tables or stools and this very reason allows for communal dining - lively Cuban music greeted us and within minutes, our food was ready!  We sat on the patio outside, took our time with eating and left happy :) We shared the crispy Mariquitas with mojo de ajo and the mixture of chiles, garlic, and olive oil drizzled on the thin plantain chips had me drooling for more. My mom had to stop me from getting an extra order to go. Splitting a Cubano for a snack was a great idea because it's a nice sized sandwich, but  after my first bite I kinda wanted to eat it all myself....if I wasn't with my mom, I probably would've--I'm just sayin'  The Cubano had deliciously soft and crispy bread, juicy ham and roasted pork, salty Swiss cheese, tangy mustard, and fresh pickles. I'm craving one right now. The layers were perfectly proportioned and I savored every bite. I was disappointed in the congrí:  when I sent back my cold rice, it seems to have just been microwaved instead of replaced - due to the shape of the rice staying the same and just coming back steamed. The Arroz Amarillo, on the other hand, came out hot and fluffy, full of savory spices, and made me want to take it to bed...to finish eating while watching a romantic comedy.  I will visit the other locations just to get Arroz Amarillo and a Cubano.  You know, to, uh, check quality control. Right? Right. Yum :)",0.9914,0.815,0.166,0.018,0.5574481074481075

Anyhow, my husband asked the guy with the rimmed hat at the cash register if they had Ropa Vieja he said yes but it only comes with plantain chips. My husband asked if we could get something else even for an up charge. The guy said no, it'd be full charge for a side. While waiting for our food we noticed people to the side of us ordered the same with fries. It was an up charge not to mention the special of the day included a choice of fries or yucca and a drink. Knowing it was our first time there he should have mentioned the special. When my husband received his order there was hardly any meat inside the bread, literally the Ropa didn't cover the bread. He asked the guy if this is standard and if he could get a bit more what he paid for.  The counter guy copped a huge attitude grabbed the plate put way too much on and rudely handed it back with his attitude.  I've worked most of my life in the food industry and you don't do that.

Listen, I know the plantains are fried and I'm ok with that but they shouldn't be dripping oil and they should definitely be fried to the point of slight crispness on the outside. The steak should not be dripping oil. They should be embarrassed that they served this to a customer. The rice was ok. Not fabulous, but edible. It was my first time there and it will be my last.

2016-02-28,5.0,"I love Cuban food and 90 miles does not disappoint! I went there for the second time this weekend and it has to be one of my favorite spots. The empanadas are a must! The beef is my favorite but you can't go wrong with the chicken or mozzarella. We tried the chorizo/goat cheese but the goat cheese was just too overpowering. The empanadas have a perfectly flakey crust with gooey centers. Also try the snickers version for dessert. The churrasco is hands down my favorite entree. You get a huge serving of skirt steak and the flavor is incredible. I had my first yuca cob mojo here and it's delicious. Similar to potatoes but velvetier. I wanted to try something else but couldn't bring myself to pass this up. I sampled some of my friends fricase de pollo and croqueta which were both delicious but would still choose the steak =) Pros: The food- seriously everything is fantastic!

Either check out the daily lunch sandwich specials above the water jug (available until 5pm) or ask for a full menu. At all hours I've found the cashier to be willing to make recommendations. Grab one of the few stools inside and the cashier will bring your dinner to you. If you don't order a drink they have plastic cups and a water jug for you to help yourself.

For an appetizer we got empanadas which you order in 3s. We ordered spinach, chicken, and chorizo/goat cheese. All were delicious and a good amount of filling with a flaky pastry crust that tastes homemade.  For an entree we got bistec de palomilla which comes with white rice and beans and cooked plaintains, a typical cuban dinner. The steak was thin cut and flavorful but I would probably get something different next time because it had too many onions for my liking which overpowered the steak.

After going to the Roscoe Village location 5 times now, I realized that this place is merely popular with white people who have no idea what Cuban or Puerto Rican food is supposed to taste like . I am Puerto Rican and I lived on my island for 9 yrs. The two main ingredients in ALL the food is Sazon and Sofrito. Which this place uses neither. Its truly unbelievable to me that you can make this Caribbean food without these 2 critical ingredients which differentiate this food from any other country! Their empanadas are bland. In fact, all the food there has a blandness to it because of the lack of these two critical seasonings. The food is ""pretty good"" but OMG it  could.be  over the top delicious if they actually used the seasonings of Cuba and Puerto Rico!     Today, I got the papaya shake. They handed me a large glass of milk and sugar. Zero papaya fruit. They said it was in there but. You sure couldn't taste it. It was like a large glass of thick sweet creamer.

The space itself is small, but they do have an outdoor patio, which I imagine is nice for the summer.  The staff seemed overwhelmed by everything going on, and the restaurant wasn't even very busy. Maybe they were understaffed. The counter person was responsible for taking orders, running food and also making all the drinks, which depending on what you get, could take a while. There seemed to be confusion as to where food was going, which sort of dragged things out a while. I imagine it might help if the staff asked their customers if they would be seated indoors or on the patio.... I waited for 20+ minutes for two coffees and my shake. This was definitely more than I would like to wait, and I consider myself extremely patient. This time did give me the chance to look over the menu though, which was awkwardly placed next to the counter (making it hard for someone just walking in to really get to the menu BEFORE having to place the order).

2015-03-28,5.0,"I live right around the corner from this place, so I come here often. I've tried the majority of their sandwiches and appetizers. They are all extremely delicious. I used to go classic Cuban sandwich until I discovered the other sandwiches are even better. I love the lechon sandwich, and my boyfriend loves the croquetas sandwich (which I agree is probably the best sandwich they have). We usually get the aji relleno and the wanna be cuban for appetizers. They are both awesome, but I love the wanna be cuban better (even though it's soy beef, and I am NOT a vegetarian by any  means!) The maduros are also really good. I just think the empanadas are so-so, though. I definitely wouldn't come here for those.  The service is always friendly and usually quick. The only bad experience we've had was on the first nice weather day this year they were super busy, so our order took probably 25-30 minutes longer than normal. They also forgot to give us part of our order. It wasn't a big deal though since it's not normally like that, and they gave us a credit.",0.9911,0.74,0.226,0.034,0.5517619047619048
2015-03-27,4.0,"COME ON, SHAKE YOUR BODY BABY, DO THE CONGA! I was introduced to this place by my 20-something year old niece. She really knows a lot of great restaurants in the city! We've been here several times over the years. My favorite dish is the Churrasco which is marinated skirt steak and super tender. It is served with garlic sauce, a little parsley, yellow rice and boiled yuca (which is like a potato) con mojo de ajo. If you do not like garlic do not order this dish. My husband always orders the Fricase de pollo which is perfectly prepared with an goluptious of flavors and fall off the bone tender. The vibe is cool with people of all ages. When we came here, I heard the song, ""Come on, Shake Your Body Baby, Do the Conga!"" I started tapping my foot to the beat of the music. Hey, after a few drinks I really wanted to start a Conga line, but I was afraid I'd get kicked out of the restaurant. Maybe next time I'll get the courage to actually start a Conga line! Oh, but I digress....back to the food.... For starters, we ordered the empanadas (three different kinds) -- chicken, ropa vieja and beef. They don't tell you which one is which so you have to bite into them to find out ""which"" one is chicken, beef or ropa vieja. We shared the stuffed papa which was perfectly prepared and very, very good. Empanadas are worthy of 4 stars. The stuffed potatoes are 5 stars worthy. To be perfectly honest, I have had much better Cuban comida (food) at other Cuban restaurants in Chicago (for a lot less). Give ""El Cubanito"" in Logan Square a shot (OMFG, I love their steak and Cuban sandwiches). Also, hit up ""Paladar"" (Western Ave) or even ""Señor Pan (on North Ave, near Western) for tasty Cuban comida. Señor Pan has two locations, but I prefer their North Ave joint. La comida at these places is actually much more delectable with higher quality cuts of meat than here. You're welcome for these tips! We usually bring two bottles of wine. We enjoy Argentinian wines, such as, Malbec or Tempranillo, both pair nicely with meat dishes. Go here early (even if you don't usually eat an early dinner), especially on weekends. We brought along two bottles of Bodegas Graffigna 2012 Centenario Malbec, but any Malbec wine balances nicely with meat dishes. Service is effusive, but incredibly lackadaisical. On weekends, it gets super crazy crowded for dinner. I recommend trying this joint for lunch instead. The wait can be crazy long for dinner service, especially on weekends. It is a small restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating. It can also get very polyphloisboisterous inside!  You may wait up to 30-minutes for your comida, so definitely pop open your bottle of vino and order several appetizers to avoid passing out at your table. The food is flavorful with various Latin herbs and spices. Portions are fine, but not huge. This is a great place for people of all ages (great for small groups, not large).  The outdoor seating fills up quickly in the Summer. Hey, if you do not mind inhaling gas fumes while enjoying your meal then sit outside, by all means!  Parking around here can be a pain in the ass. The inside is really dated. Nothing spectacular. The decor is rather tired, dark, dingy and boring.  Service -- 3 stars (at a turtle's pace) Price-point -- 4 stars Cuisine -- 4 stars Ambiance/Decor -- 3 stars Outdoor patio -- 2 stars (please invest in new tables/chairs) For the best Cuban sandwiches hit up ""El Cubanito"" or ""Paladar"" (definitely get the Ropa Vieja here). Also, Cohiba Cuban Cuisine (Broadway, east side, half block north of Diversey) serves outstanding ropa vieja. El Paladar and Cohiba are great spots for a date night with your spouse or for a ""First"" date. Also, give Señor Pan a shot -- really good spot for lunch or dinner (North Ave location). If you are seeking exceptional and delectable Puerto Rican cuisine, hit up Casa Yari, Juanita's or La Plena.

The grilled onions on the inside was my favorite part but somehow I didn't notice the shoestring potatoes which were supposed to be there.

Plus the outside is fried to a perfect light golden crisp.

That means Swiss cheese, diced ham/onions and maduros.  Went there this week for the breakfast sandwich. This ""is"" a hardy sandwich which can feed two people. A generous proportion of egg, ham, cheese and onion folded over. A thick slice of maduro goes on top of the folded over egg tortilla and placed inside a warm toasted french bread.  Did I say ""is"" regarding this sandwich: how about was. First of all the employee turn around at the front counter is like the deli at the Roscoe Village Marianos's. New body every time I visit. Okay, so I called my order in and asked for a breakfast sandwich with everything including maduros. When I opened my sandwich I see they have given my a side order of maduros instead of adding it in the sandwich. No problem. I can put the maduros inside the sandwich myself, plus the side order gave me three slices instead of the one slice I would've gotten inside the sandwich. Or should I say, half the sandwich it used to be. OMG! It felt light right away. It was half the portion of egg it used to be, a hint of ham, I'll say shadows of ham and the bread was not toasted. I can't speak about the rest of the menu except for their fish soup. I tried and it not good. Months later I gave the soup a second chance and it was the same. That was the end of that menu item for me.  I hope this was just a bad day, but know that inconsistency is a major turn off for any restaurant.

2013-04-30,2.0,"My wife and I came here with high expectations.  We left pretty disappointed with the food.  It may be because this was our first time having Cuban food and didn't order the right combinations of things on the menu.  We started with the Tostones Rellenos and when it arrived at our table, it smelled very good.  However, it was very bland.  It tasted nothing like how it smelled like.  My wife got the Ropa Vieja because our fellow yelpers recommended it while I got the Puerco Rostizado.  The presentation of the dish looked boring.  It came very quick so I don't know if they rushed it or what... but it tasted just as how it looked.. boring.  It just wasn't flavorful as I thought it would be.  We did come on a Friday night where it was snowing in the middle of April.  Yeah, I am trying to find excuses for this place. I was just expecting more.  Here's another thing about their staff. I called to check if they take reservations on a Friday.  They said no because they are a small restaurant.  I understood and asked about how long the wait may be for two if I arrived in 10 minutes.  They weren't that busy yet so they assured the wait wouldn't be long. I thanked them and hanged up.  When I arrived 10 minutes later, I was greeted and asked if ""I had reservations for the evening"". What the heck? I brushed it off since they were able to seat me right away.  Also, our waitress was very soft spoken and that didn't help with the loud music playing in the background. I don't mind the music, they can choose whatever best describe the personality of the restaurant, but it felt like they were trying to mix a bar/club with a restaurant with the music.  I may give this another try again one day and I do hope to update my review for more stars but for now... this place was ""blah"" for me.",0.7386,0.865,0.074,0.062,0.5161904761904763

WTF?! Let's begin with the fact that I'm Cuban and I love ALL types of food Cuban food especially! I know what  I'm talking about when it comes to the eating out experience, and I'm always confused about my feelings after leaving this place. A few signature items keep me going back. For the type of food and portions you are given I believe 90 Miles is grossly over priced! I feel that their prices are so high that I'm almost insulted every time I'm given my total. For a good sandwich and some good appetizers and snacks I really recommend this place, but for a full Cuban course this is NOT the place.  *Pro: The sandwiches are pretty damn good. My favorite item on the menu is the Frita Cubana (which basically is a Cuban burger). The frita here is better then any I've had even in Miami!  *Con: THE PRICE! The sandwiches don't come with sides unless you are eating in and I believe their average price per sandwich is about $7 and up. Just recently I went and purchased 2 sandwiches one side 2 drinks and 2 pastries....my total was about $30 which for a Cuban lunch is ridiculously over priced.  I've been to plenty of Cuban restaurants in my day and 90 Miles on average charges about $5 more then other Cuban restaurants in the area for the same meals and actually smaller portions. I believe this place targets the American consumers (young white trendy hipsters/yuppies) and this is why they get away with these type of prices. In the summer I went once and was charged $20 for 2 milkshakes and 4 pastries! It is really difficult to come by good Cuban pastries, and I wont knock the ones they sell here they are good and fresh but cost $2-$2.50 each...**** Side note a little hole in the wall place called Latin American Bakery on Fullerton sells AMAZING Cuban pastries also guava filled for .75 cents each**** Do you understand what I mean about the price now?!

First time, I had a Cubano sandwich w/smashed plantains instead of bread, they were easy on the condiments, & all the flavors strike a perfect balance. 2nd time, I had the ox tail stew. If you've never had ox tail, you don't know what you're missing, I don't think it's possible to make bad ox tail. Theirs was in a rich, tomato-y savory stew, a bit more pepper-heat would have been nice, but regardless, along w/the sweet plantains & rice & black beans, was wholly satisfying. Finally, I had the Guajillo sandwich, garlicky grilled beef on smashed plantains. The quality of the beef was good, flavorful & tender. This one was a little oily, probably from both the meat & the plantains, but it was still delicious, I finished it w/out pause. Maybe not for calorie-counters, but that's not me.

The portion was rather large which lead to indulging the next day when it tasted even better than the first time. My husband had the ox tail special.  Of note... I noticed freshly painted signage from none other than Guy Fieri hanging behind the register. The associate explained to me that he has recently visited and there would be a special about 90 miles on one of his shows (which has probably aired already).  I do wish they had more seating inside. I suppose in the mid fall to early spring this joint becomes mainly a take-out place.

2012-10-06,4.0,"Pretty yummy overall, and I would say that ""I'm a fan"" to this place. I'm probably more like a 3.5 though. Came here with some friends for lunch on a Sunday around noon. There were not too many people around, so our orders came out quickly. The patio is great when the weather is nice.  I left my search of the perfect vegetarian-friendly sandwich to try something new. The waitress suggested one of the specials, a portobello with substitute meat crumbles ($5.95). I enjoyed it, and it was fulfilling and yummy, but I don't remember anything outstanding about the flavor. Maybe I should have tried the tofu sandwich (though I was trying to gauge how firm the tofu would actually be.) My friend ordered empanadas to see if she liked them. She tried several different flavors, including one meat, one veggie, one goat cheese + jam. I thought they weren't filled very much and the veggie one was unimpressive. The goat cheese + jam one was good though! I'm a sucker for those flavors. She ran back to the counter get a lechon (pork) sandwich and I think that was much better. Hearing about others' meat sandwiches makes me jelly to eat meat. We also shared some tostones, or flat, fried plantains with garlic. I love tostones and smothered it with the topping, though eating so much garlic turned out to be a bad choice for later in the afternoon.",0.9713,0.755,0.173,0.072,0.49397186147186145

2012-07-19,4.0,"Please, please visit 90 Miles Cuban Cafe. You won't regret it. For maximum pleasure do the following things: -Upon arrival, order a round of Pastelitos de Guayaba y Queso Crema (guava and cream cheese pastries) along with some Cortaditos. There are many varieties of Pastelitos, but these are filled with guava paste and a special, sweetened cream cheese mixture. They have a delicate, flaky pasty shell and are perfect for dipping into Cuban espresso--the world's finest espresso, especially when mixed with a little steamed milk. Anyway, the Pastelitos are brought in from Miami proper and they sell out very quickly, which is why you should ask for them right away. They're unmissable. Also worth noting, if you're there for the experience, the Pastelito and Cortadito combination is as classic-Cuban as it gets. -The portions here are humongous. Plan to share an entree (or two, depending on your party's size) and order a few appetizers instead of one mega entree per person. As far as selection goes, I've tried almost everything and I think that the two best entrees are the Bistec (so huge) and Ropa Vieja dishes. The Ropa Vieja, which translates into 'old clothes' is a savory, shredded beef dish cooked for hours in a tomato-garlic-saffron stew.  It's served with rice, beans and sweet plantains--a thing of beauty. -The Croquetas are also absolutely delicious. Order those. The sauce they are served with isn't a traditional accompaniment, but I love it. -Also, order the Mariquitas. The Mariquitas are shaved, fried plantain chips. They are highly munchable and extremely addictive. They come with a side of Mojo (garlic in oil, basically) which I enjoy pouring all over the Mariquitas, the rest of my food and myself.  -Lastly, we all know this place is byob and that's great, but one of these days you should order the Jupiña--a supremely awesome pineapple soda that Cuban people feed their children so that their tropical bodies grow up full of crazy. It's so good, sweet and unique. Don't miss it either.  I'm Cuban American, born and raised in Miami's Little Havana. I would know.",0.9976,0.792,0.2,0.008,0.5823280423280424

It came with a cream dressing on the side (which I was not a fan of) but the bread pudding was super good! Service was great and really friendly. Prices were reasonable at about $12 for the dinner. They offer the ropa vieja on a sandwich as well for about $7. So glad we were in the neighborhood to try this place!",0.9916,0.784,0.195,0.02,0.6019333333333333

My bf got the cuban sandwich which was completely bland and the yuca with it also extremely cold in the middle. Our server Ryan, was absolutely fantastic and the hostess was very nice.

Not too much meat or bread, all deliciousness.  Also, they come with fried plaintain chips very crispy and not v. oily.  The tostones were a good size, like the size of a coaster and not too thick.

Of course I wanted to try everything so here is my take on this true neighborhood gem. My boyfriend and I started with beef empanadas. Can you say amazing? It was the best empanada I've ever had. It also comes with this delectable green dipping sauce. I order the Bistec meal which comes with rice, beans, and fried plantains. The skirt steak was wonderful and the grilled onions only added to the flavor. The beans were magnificent and the rice was cooked just right. The fried plantains were out of this world! I love plantains and I thought for sure that no one could do them as well as my beautiful Miami. I have never been happier to be proved wrong.

We ordered 2 Cubano sandwiches (ham, roast pork, swiss cheese, pickles & mustard on French bread) at $6.95 each.  The Cubano was a good average sandwich.  Nothing truly to write home about.  Three Bistec sandwiches (steak, romaine lettuce, tomato, grilled onions, shoestring potatoes & chimichurri sauce) at $6.95 each.  The steak was seasoned very well.  Of course we did think it was weird to have shoestring (just like from a Jays can) potatoes on the sandwich!  Three orders of Ropa Vieja, my true Cuban favorite sandwich (shredded beef, peppers & onions long-cooked in Creole sauce) for $6.95 each.  This was a good sandwich, Maria thought a bit heavy on the peppers though.  One order of Tostones (green plantains) at 5 for $3.50 each.  And we will say they definitely needed salt.  Which should have been sprinkled on as they came out of the cooker and were nice and fresh and hot.  We also thought this for the Tostones and the Mariquitas we received too.  No salt which hurt the true taste and flavor of the items.  Three orders of the Croquetas (mix of ham and chicken) at 4 for $4.50 each.  These were really GOOD!  Two Beef Empanadas and two Ropa Vieja Empanadas at $2.50 each.  Another very good item, a bit greasy though.  Two Pastelito (Guava and cheese) and One Pastelito (Carne) for $1.95 each.  Also two bread Puddings at $2.50 each.  Finally one Coke for a dollar and one Mango Tropical Shake for $3.50 each. Overall with a total bill of roughly $108 dollars.  We thought the food was good.  The service was friendly.  Have we had better, yes I think Senor Pan was MUCH BETTER!  And much cheaper too.  And also being a Cuban family, it was close to home made food but still not quite there yet.  Sorry about that 90 Miles, you were nice to try though.",0.979,0.874,0.105,0.021,0.5698809523809524

Cons The only negative thing is that the bathroom is small, and there's only 1...and it's in the middle of the kitchen.  I kept drinking to much wine, and it was a pain to have to go to the bathroom.  Oh well....",0.9829,0.702,0.228,0.07,0.4959627329192547
2011-07-19,4.0,"After taking in a matinee show, we headed to 90 Miles Cuban Cafe to sit in the sun (well, the shade but outside nonetheless) and order some good Cuban sandwiches. I ordered the veggie sandwich and a guava/cheese empanada.  I thought both were excellent.  The sandwich was busting full of yummy veggies.  I could only eat one half and even that was a struggle.  I highly recommend that those with smaller tummies, try to find someone to split an order.  I also splurged with the guava/cheese empanada, which was equally as awesome.  Each bite had the right combination of flavor and texture.  I was glad to have something with a different flavor profile to accompany the veggie sandwich. The service was great.  I went to grab a water bottle from the cooler but was quickly informed by the staff that they had tap water readily available outside.  Unfortunately they were out of ice and in the hot sun, the water turned quickly warm.   The outdoor seating isn't anything spectacular but was sort of perfect at the same time.  One of the best parts about it was that it was off to the side, not really near the entrance.  This eliminated patrons from walking through to place their orders and left those of us seated peacefully off to the side.  It's the little things, ya know.",0.9939,0.782,0.195,0.024,0.5710141093474428
2011-07-19,4.0,"""Ooh, calamari for only five dollars?  Score!"" No.  No no no.  A thousand times no.  Clearly I should have known better.   What was described on the menu board as ""big pieces of calamari with a zesty tomato sauce"" was in fact a handful of tiny, limp, rubbery grey rings the size of my pinky finger, hidden inside a giant cup of tomato sauce.  Now, it didn't actually taste terrible, but this was nowhere near a quality calamari dish (trust me, I'm a connoisseur).  It was like a game of Bobbing for Squid Rings or the deep-sea trawling industry in miniature--dip in the fork, feel around for anything more solid than a tomato chunk, pull up the fork, and hope to come up with something like a calamari ring.  I think that I got around ten or twelve of them in thirty or forty dives. So stick with the sandwiches, which are still great, and for heaven's sake eschew the calamari and the empanadas. I am inclined to drop them to three stars for the awful veggie empanada and the calamari misadventure, AND because they were out of ice (yes, ice!) and could not make any shakes.  But those two sandwiches (lechon and veggie) were damn good, and the service is still top-notch.  So I'm officially registering this one as 3.5 stars.",0.9224,0.799,0.124,0.077,0.5133333333333334

2011-06-24,4.0,"Boyfriend and I went here for dinner on a weeknight and had a fantastic experience. We wanted something a little more special than pub grub but didn't want to spend more than $40 for the two of us. This place hit that on the mark. In fact, it came in under $40. Our total bill was just $36 with tip. We arrived on bikes and with lots of gear, so requested to be seated outside, along the railing so we could chain up next to the table and not get all our stuff in anyone's way. Hardly an unreasonable request as most of the tables out front appeared to be vacant and it was still a bit early but it seemed to have ruffled the hostess.. Alas, five minutes later, we had just what we wanted -- a table for two, outdoors, with space for bikes and all our stuff. Our server Margherita was incredibly friendly and helpful. We asked her recommendations on entrees, which were excellently delivered. I had the chicken, he had the steak. Both were fantastic. Wish we'd listened to her on the appetizers, though. We went on a recommendation from boyfriend's friend who had been there before. Tostones. The garlic 'sauce' wasn't really a sauce so much as flecks of sauteed garlic that was so skimpily scattered over the plantains, there was just too little flavour going on. The rice pudding? Delicious!!! We brought a bottle of wine. Didn't have to pay a corkage fee. And we were clued on a helpful little tidbit.. they have blenders and aren't opposed to mixing your drinks should you decide to rock up with the fixins for margaritas, mojitos, etc. Overall, everything was great. We'll definitely be back and happily recommending them to friends. Probably won't be order the tostones, though.",0.9962,0.807,0.181,0.012,0.523580586080586

2011-04-23,4.0,"Clyborn (Roscoe Village) Pros: Food, Coffee, Atmosphere, Price, Parking Cons: Limited in Seating (Only in Winter), Area, Service (Sometimes) PROS: I was one of the first customers when ""90 Miles"" opened.   To say the least, I was very happy with everything they had to offer.  All of the food was fresh and really good.   Over the past year or so, the Clyborn restaurant has dipped in service, but not by much.  From time to time, they will get the order wrong but will turn around to make it right.  Sometimes by offering a free cup of coffee. This is great, considering most places would not even bother to admit they were wrong to begin with. The coffee is great, it's made really well.  It is one of my favorite brands since I grew up in a household that served Cafe Bustelo and a great alternative to Intellgentsia and Metropolis coffee that is usually offered around the Chicagoland area. The food is always amazing for me.  Any sandwich that I have ordered over the years has always been juicy, tasty and among other great words that I can not think of right now.  The price are reasonable and you do get a lot for what you pay for.  I do tend to worry about simple things costing a bit much like the Grill Cheese Sandwich ($6.50).  For as simple a sandwich can be to be close to something that has meat.  This is a bit much, but then again, if I went there for a grill cheese sandwich then I have to worry about why I am ordering it.    They also have a great (small) outside patio and parking. CONS: The bad is (and this is not much for me) during the winter month, since the place is so small, when 90 miles can be packed there is not much room to sit.  So basically for me, the winter month are mainly for pick-up and go.  This can go either way for each individual to what kind of experience they are really looking for. At this moment, the area is somewhat shady.  Most times, I have never had any issues, but I know in the past there has been numerous incidents that happen.  This is not because of 90 Miles itself, but for where it is by.  At the same token, this is just the start of a neighborhood that is up and coming.  Granted Roscoe Village is great at certain points and areas, when you head more west, its ... eh. Service sometimes can be somewhat eh too, just because they past few times I have gone they have gotten my order wrong.  I don't know if because if the person behind the counter is new or not.   The last time I ordered (about a week ago) I had ordered 4 sandwiches and received 2 sandwiches and plantains.  Granted I love my plantains, but not what I ordered... The excuse the gentleman gave me is that I ordered it wrong.  REALLY?  you are going to tell me what I wanted & ordered and debated with me what you gave to me.  I do not think so..... But issues like this are so sporadic that i just brushed it off and went on with my own business.  It is not worth dealing with idiotic nonsense like that.

2011-03-14,5.0,"One day, two Irish (one mostly and still in celebratory gear, the other only part) rebels made like Che (he of the part Irish rebel blood - not a fan) and headed for Cuba, er, 90 Miles Cuban Cafe.   I'd read about 90 Miles on Yelp some time ago and had had it bookmarked for some time to try based on the reviews.  It is a bit out of the way for me, so I'd never quite gotten up to it until I started driving aimlessly once again parade day plus one and it suddenly popped into my head.   90 Miles is an island oasis on North Clybourn.  From the outside, it looks like nothing more than driftwood - it's basically a shack.  Walk inside, and you still feel like you're in a shack because it's rather cozy.  The newspaper clippings on the wall will take you back to pre-revolutionary times as you await your meal.  Cuba is a party island. We ordered a Cubana and a Pollo with a side of fried plantains.  Whoa.  Drugs.  Talk about an instant double shot of love to send you adrift into contentedness.  Graziano and Conte, step aside, you've been dethroned by the new Best Sandwich in the World.  The Cubana is pure fried perfection, with ham, pork, pickles and mustard.  And the Pollo is right on its heels.  The fried plantains were also very good, but I wouldn't say they were as good as those found at Carnivale.  I'm craving all of this again right now.  I left my heart in 90 Miles.  As 90 Miles is a tiny place, you will want to be cognizant of when you go so that you don't end up in what I presume would be a long line at the lunch hour.  We were lucky enough to be victims of the time switch such that we were having a rather late lunch, so we encountered no lines.  But a line did form as we were enjoying our Cuban fare.   If 90 Miles is what's typical of Cuban fare, then it is time for Fidel and his brother to scram, for the embargo to end and for what I imagine is a beautiful country to open up to trade again.  But until then, it's my new love 90 Miles again for sure.  Cubanas for all!

2011-01-30,4.0,"I had the most yummy lechon sandwich ever. I loved the greasiness of it, but sadly, because it's greasy, I won't be having another one until months later.  The sandwich was juicy. I was afraid that it was going to be dry. When I think of ""roast pork,"" my experiences has mostly been with Chinese roast pork, which is usually more dry than it is juicy. The juiciness of the sandwich was the deciding factor for me when it came to deciding between the cubano and the lechon sandwich. My experience with a Cuban sandwich (the Milanesa) at Irazu was more dry than it was juicy, and I had a hard time finishing it. This was SO not the case with 90 Miles' lechon sandwich. The cashier recommended an iron beer for my drink. It's a Cuban soft drink that they import from Miami. It's not alcoholic, and it tasted faintly like root beer. It's funny that I actually considered and bought the drink because I was actually thinking of ginger beer when the guy mentioned it... I don't like root beer so it's usually not on my mind when I hear of a ""beer"" soft drink. And I'm glad the taste of iron beer isn't as strong as that of an American root beer.  The icon of a man flexing his bicep reminded me of Pop-Eye, which I thought was amusing. Of course, the man on the iron beer can was a lot younger and less White-looking. ;) My total for the whole meal was a little less than $10! Cheap AND delicious! It's a win! I also tried a sip of my friend's mamey shake. It was very rich and creamy, and very delicious! I have no idea what a mamey is, but it's some sort of fruit.

I just was completely disinterested in eating it. half of my meat was removed as i ate it. my bf tried the ropa viejo? ( might have botched the name). It was with a shredded beef, smothered in sauce, but with some peppers I think. It just reminded me of a beefy stew in a sandwich.  little soggy. little salty. the house hot sauce didn't really do much to change flavors for me either. i dunno. i really appreciate the spot for what it is. better quality than a grab-n-go for sure. it's a pleasant break away from typical grease joints. but still. no ball out of the park for me. if you're on the run and dont want a huge sit-down experience, i would keep this place in mind. otherwise, i'm a bit indifferent.  the waitress was very helpful in suggesting items to me, since i was clueless. but i still don't think that the place warrants a ""tip slot"" on the bill, since it's not as though they truly wait on you other than hand you your plate.  (it's the kinda place where you eat your grub and toss out your tray like in a cafeteria). but is it cheap? yes. decent? yes. but next time maybe i'll just sample the sides like the empanada, tamal, n flan.",0.9942,0.749,0.196,0.055,0.575534188034188

The other important fact to point out is that if your a person that normally seasons food with just salt and pepper, your taste buds may not know how to act when you taste well seasoned Cuban food.

The white rice was good.  I normally don't eat white rice, but when it comes to latin food, it usually tastes different so I try it.  The fried yuca had way too much garlic on it, and this is coming from someone who enjoys garlic.   I won't be coming back here unless someone makes me.  I can get rice at many other places and there are many other places I get can empanadas.  Maybe I should have tried a dinner different than my friend's, but nothing on the menu jumped out.",-0.6069,0.872,0.05,0.078,0.4362745098039215

I work in the industry and am very forgiving in these matters, but I have noticed some trends at 90 miles. My gf always, ALWAYS asks for extra hot sauce or chimichuri  or whatever spicy sauce is to be had at wherever we are eating. Every time we have been to 90 miles she has asked for extra hot sauce and never has it been brought to us upon our first request. No big deal, she's needy sometimes and I love her for it. The last visit our server was friendly and knowledgeable. Two traits that go a long way with me as a diner. But, he was overextended in his section and told us so. Perhaps a server called in, someone got fired, who knows? So, we didnt have silverware when our appetizers came, had to wait several minutes before someone on the staff could help us. Our server gave us our pitcher of Mojito mix without a spoon. How the hell do we dig out the ice cubes? A fork? Our grubby alcoholic fingers?? The hot sauce thing again. Asked for extra limes, took forever to get them. Basically we got poor service from a cool dude in a place we love to go to. I dont know if the service concerns at 90 miles are indicative of deeper issues at the restaurant, but I hope they get resolved.

We walking to this place from Montrose to Clybourn which is about 3 miles, at this time we were extremely hungry and antsy to get there. So after a 30 minute walk we finally got there. It smelled delicious!!! We were so excited to walk in order and stuff ourselves.  I order the, ""Bistec dinner"", which includes a medium size pork steak, caramelized onions, garlic, cilantro, black beans, white rice and fried plantains all for $9.95 plus tax. My boyfriend order , ""Ropa Veija"", which is shredded pork cooked in their Cuban sauce ( the portion of this dish is very generous), black beans, white rice and fried plantains for $9.95 plus tax. We didn't order drinks, we had complimentary water they had by their counter but the food was awesome for my tummy!!!  Overall, 90 Miles Cuban Café is a great Cuban restaurant. Their decor is very vintage, which I love. They have old Cuban newspaper articles, magazine ads, Cuban fashion, Cuban posters and old family photos in Cuba all posted around the walls. They don't have many seats inside, but they do have an open patio which you can sit and its BYOB! I recommend this great little spot between Clybourn and Belmont.

The outdoor patio area had more seating and given the weather and the awkwardness that is sitting/eating/having to constantly look left or right to talk to your company it was a must do.  I've only had Cuban a couple times in the Detroit area so by no means do I consider myself an aficionado. I will say, however, that I've heard hundreds of people talk about how the Cuban sandwich is a Godsend and yet I have not had one good experience ordering it. I ordered one at 90 Miles hoping for redemption and much to my surprise...it delivered. Great sandwich.  The side (fried plantains) were nice because they are an interesting upgrade to fries (or any variation of fries) but the 3-5 small pieces seemed inadequate in comparison to the sandwich price.

And I had heard about 90 mile, and it was nearby. Was it fate? We almost missed it when we drove by the first time. Wait, this little corner building was the epicenter of cuban food in Chicago? Something must be wrong here ... We walk in, and there was a couple people ahead of us. There was just six or so stools lined up around the back of the building. Very small indeed. The menu had a decent selection of authentic cuban food. I settle on a sandwich I had heard about where the white bread was replaced with plantains. Oh my goodness, what a great combination. My friend got empanadas which we shared. Solid tasting. I also had the cafe cubano which was nicely strong, enjoyable. While we were waiting for our food and eating, we saw activity pick up. This location was busy for deliveries and pickups, we were the only ones to sit and eat. At one point there were over twenty people waiting for food inside. I don't know how they do it and not get overwhelmed! But I can see why the place is popular, even though it don't look like much from the ouside. Amazing food. Amazing find.

2010-07-19,5.0,"This place may be on an odd corner and not look like much from afar, but it's packed with flavor. It's easy to drive by and not know what 90 Miles is all about. I've been doing it for the longest time. One day I had a craving for a good Cuban sandwich on the north side and made my way here. They have a small lot that will fit maybe 7 cars and it's never a problem to get in there for a weekday lunch. They have a nice variety of sandwiches to choose from and even some vegetarian selections if that's your thing. They also have a great variety of sides, various preparations of plantains and cassava. I've had a Cubano, Media Noche, and Bistec sandwich so far. All of them come with a few fried plantain chips which are light and crunchy. The sandwiches all brim with flavor; the meat is juicy and well spiced. The breads toasted texture compliments the meat well and really soaks up the juices without falling apart. I did order the steak with fried plantains as the bun instead of bread once too, though I can't remember what the name for it was. Even though it's a little starchy and leaks oil like a BP spill I can't help but love the concept and execution. There are a few imported soft drinks as well which are a little on the sweet side (cane sugar) but great to try and pair well with the saltiness of the food. The employees are awesome and the girls behind the counter are engaging. They bring your food out to you and with the outdoor seating area you get a mini-vacation vibe. Prices are reasonable and the portions are filling. While the cubano sandwich isn't my number one in the city (Cafecito gets that nod) it's still a great spot.

2010-07-17,4.0,"My husband was kind of skeptical when we drove up to this tiny shed-like restaurant with murals all over its walls, but I was convinced this was a gold mine based on all the yelp reviews. And the rumors were true! We went around 1:00 PM on a Friday. Parking was not incredibly difficult even though the 4-5 space parking lot was full. We parked on a side street. We walked in and yes, it's small but we were immediately greeted by a friendly staff. The place actually looks kind of homey with walls covered by Cuban newspapers and old photographs.  Initially we were stumped by the inadequately described menu that was on display (although I must say the chalkboard menu displays are super cute ) but they also had paper menus with more description, similar if not exactly the same as the menu on the website. I already knew what I wanted but my husband has some food allergies and he wanted to make sure he knows what to expect. The kind lady behind the counter was knowledgeable enough to help right away.  My husband got the bisteak (steak sandwich) and I got the pulled beef. We got them to go since there was no room to sit. Every single bar stool at the wrap-around bar, the only seating there is, was taken. There is a cute little patio with umbrellas but it was scorching  outside. I would have really liked to stay and enjoy the music as well as the ambiance. This is the reason I deducted one star. Even as we waited for our food for about 10-15 minutes, there was no room to sit.  After a forty minute drive home (due to traffic), the sandwiches got a little soggy, especially  my pulled beef since it was wetter than the steak sandwich. My pulled beef was soaked in a red sauce along with strips of onions and green pepper. It tasted phenomenal! The bread, you could tell, was fresh. My husband's steak sandwich came with romaine? lettuce and tomatoes(?). Sorry, by that point I was in a trance state from how good my sandwich tasted that I didn't really pay attention to what I was tasting of my husband's sandwich. I do remember the meat was top quality and moist. In addition, my husband, a hot-sauce aficionado, got their hot sauce on the side. The hot sauce was not the hottest thing I ever tried but it went well with the sandwiches. I give 5/5 for the taste. The portion size of each sandwich was adequate for me even though I was starving by that point. Great value for your money at $6.50 each for lunch.

They are crispy, pretty light, and VERY flavorful. Today, because I was in the area, I grabbed a beef and a goat cheese. While the goat cheese is not what I typically had in BA, it was wonderful, goat cheese and a red pepper flavor. The beef was savory and delicious! The pork and others are good too (just not as fresh in my memory.)  The Cafe con Leche here is also awesome! They do it iced in the summer, hot in the winter- anyway you want it- that's the way you need it. They provide! 90 Miles has perfected the Cuban sweetness in this drink- and believe me- they are addicting.  The Sandwiches are pretty darn awesome too! The Cubano (ham, roast pork, swiss cheese, pickles and mustard) is really my favorite, but the Lechon (Roast pork, romaine lettuce, grilled onions and sweet plantains) and Ropa Vieja (shredded beef and Creole sauce) are rocking too!

The Cubano Sandwich is the traditional sandwich standard, and it was fantastic.

This place rocks. Not only does it get points right off the bat for the actual building itself (tiny and unassuming, beautiful mural artwork all over it, cozy get-to-know-the-stranger-sitting-next-to-you inside seating) it scores big for the consistently great food and friendly employees.  Sample of an experience goes something like this:    1. Parking: Easily park in their lot or on many open spaces in the street.     2. Ordering: Order, and while waiting you may be treated to a free sample. Last time we were there it was with a cup of their Cuban coffee. Sweet, big flavor and ah-mazingly thick. (That's what she said.)    3. Scarfing: Eat at the few seats inside bar area or take it outside to the cute side patio.  My suggestion? Opt for the Guarjirito: a killer grilled steak (or pork if you like) sandwich that uses fried green plantains instead of bread.

Yeah I know you have - I'd rather not be squeezed into a corner close enough to eat off the person's plate next to me or stand in a three-block line for a dog (but I have heard duck fat fries are ridiculous). Anyway... Lunch at this small restaurant (orders taken at the counter) was nothing short of a surprise. I was thinking it was going to be something I didn't like with fried plantains on the side. I was completely wrong. I ordered the Cubano (Cuban ham, roast pork, Swiss cheese, pickles and mustard) which is essentially, in my eyes, an American club minus the bacon. It was a wonderful twist on my staple sandwich. My weekend warrior ordered the Ropa Vieja (Shredded beef in creole sauce) which was tender and juicy. An order of crispy fries and a chorizo Empanada to share was the perfect compliment to our sandwiches. Now I have to say I only tried a lunch sandwich so maybe I didn't get the full taste of Cuban fare but it's something to put on my to-do list. I think a dinner plate will fill that order.  Minus 1 star for the dining area which is cramped BUT the food certainly makes up for it. I would be a bit turned off if we had to take our food to go and most likely eat in the car.

2009-09-17,5.0,"At the first sign of a clear and sunny Friday evening, we ventured off to a little gem on the northwest side called 90 Miles Cafe (on N. Clybourn, south of Western). Cleverly named for the rough distance from the U.S. to Cuba, this place serves up only the most authentic Cuban cuisine. In fact, we overheard the owner saying that he had lived in Cuban until he was 11 so these recipes are genuine. The place on its own looks like a little shipwrecked hot dog stand with South American flair. The menu is written in Spanish (half of it I couldn't understand, but some words looked familiar). You walk in, order, and find a spot at the counter - a U-shaped deal that has about 12 spots tops - or take a seat at the spacious outside patio seating. The menu here is pretty simple -- some breakfast stuff, sandwiches and sides, and dinner platters (your choice of steak, chicken, pork, etc). that come with fried plantains, black beans and rice.  But sometimes, the simple things are the best. Lois went for the chicken dinner -- good stuff.  The large chicken breast was lightly marinated and topped generously with sauteed onions.  The black beans, which came in a small cup, were flavorful and particularly good when mixed with the sticky white rice.  But the plantains were the best part -- slightly crispy on the outside but nice and mushy on the inside.  And all of the portions were the perfect size, so you didn't have to worry about loading up on one thing and having to skip the others. Clark ordered the beef steak dinner, which came with all the same sides as Lois's dinner. The quality of the steak was excellent, and the overall taste was delicious. What stood out was the marinade that they use, which consisted of a vinegar mixture that gave it a tart taste. None the less, it was excellent, and was topped with grilled onions and some type of green garnish. But I would have to say that the black beans and the plantains made the meal. I'm not usually the type to request black beans on anything, but this dish came with them on the side, and they were the first to be cleared. And the plantains -- yes, like Lois said, they were delicious and crispy, but full of fresh ""banana"" flavor. To wrap it up, the food was good, the setting was excellent, the owner is friendly, and authentic, and this place was really kind of interesting in general. We dropped about $25 here for two dinners and two sodas and it was pretty much worth it.",0.9987,0.795,0.205,0.0,0.5215245775729647

I asked one of the employees who was going in and out to take the orders to customers sitting in the patio if there is any available tables outside and she was looking at me like I asked her something in Chinese. Finally at the third time she got it. The cooks and one of the waiters were yelling "" si si si si si si"" constantly and it was just annoying.

We received our food, and immediately I thought I could have made this at home. It was two pieces of bread, grilled chicken breast with no seasoning, not even salt and pepper, lettuce, tomatoes and grilled onions. It was just bland, and I didn't enjoy eating this at all. What is the point of eating outside and spending money when the food you're given is something you can make yourself? And I would at least season my chicken and definitely grill my onions with something more than just oil. I don't believe this is how they really do it in Cuba. It's like going to an Italian restaurant and being served spaghetti that's sticky and topped with market-bought marinara sauce.

It should be eaten to the brass sounds of a smooth baritone, may bring the ghettoblaster next time to facilitate this.

The sandwiches were BIG, so we knew we ordered too much food (only $23 for all that and two drinks!), but couldn't stop eating.

With that said it was definitely solid, very tasty.  I also ordered the goat cheese empanada, which I'd recommend in a heartbeat (I can't see how you could mess up a pastry filled with goat cheese...). Quick note though on the shakes that everyone raves about....I definitely saw this dude load up five HUGE spoonfulls of sugar into the shake...like massive scoops.  So, if you're wondering why they are so good, I'd say just know that those things are really, really not good for you.  You wouldn't normally consumer that much sugar in a week, I'd guess.  Pretty absurd and probably over the top. So all in all I'd say check it out - but don't go in with expectations that you're going to embark on a spirtual journey of tastiness.",0.9968,0.72,0.267,0.012,0.5671296296296297
2009-08-15,4.0,"Just visited this spot last night...WOW. Love it! My friend and I both ordered the Guarijito which is basically a steak sandwich that uses green plantains (instead of bread) and has grilled onions, lettuce, tomato, Swiss cheese, and chimichurri. DELISH! A few other reviewers complained that the guarijito was a bit greasy, and it was, but not overly so--and it certainly didn't ruin my admiration for the sandwich. If you've never been, you should definitely give it a go. The restaurant has a nice selection of sandwiches and sides. I found everything to be well-seasoned without being salty. I also ordered the congri (seasoned rice and black beans), but thought that it was just OK. However, that's small potatoes really. The sandwich more than made up for it! Also, the employees are so friendly and helpful. I think the owners may have been there as well. Very nice people. As far as the restaurant itself goes, it is tiny but fitting. I'm sure by now you've read enough reviews about the ambiance. So, go for the food. They serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner. And, apparently they're now open on Sundays (there's a banner outside of the restaurant that says so). Happy eating!",0.9921,0.77,0.206,0.024,0.4917429792429793

It's not as good as Tampa, but it's still pretty damn good. My hubby likes the pulled pork. I tried some of it and thought it was very good. I ordered a chicken dish and was unimpressed. It lacked flavor. I usually order sides when I go (i.e. empanadas, black beans and rice, plantains). Their mango shake is awesome! I'm not much of a fan of the guava and cheese pastry. It's all pastry and barely any guava inside. The food doesn't take too long to come out. The staff is very attentive and friendly. I wish they'd give you Cuban bread with your order.

Besides the steak sandwich, I tried the fried yucca, which was delicious when the garlic mojo was poured over it. I also had an empanada... Not sure what kind, since I ordered the goat cheese but definitely did not receive a goat cheese empanada. It was okay, not particularly memorable, but definitely not bad. I have trouble choosing between 3 and 4 stars. I want to give it 3, but then I think of how nice they are and how their sandwich really was not bad. So I'll be generous and go with the 4.

""Oh sweetie, we could finally try that 90 miles cafe everybody on yelp has been going gaga for.""

I finally dined here on Friday night for dinner, even sat outside since it was warm and light enough that day. It was well worth the wait! The Space The actual interior space is tiny. If the photos posted up here are any indication, it's a shack. But, a delightful one. There's only counter seating inside, but if it's warm enough, I'd recommend dining outside on their ""patio"" where there are high top tables and regular tables.

The staff will have recommendations. Take them. Try the yuca frites and empanadas to accompany your main dish. I ordered the bistec sandwich. It was good, but the second half of my sandwich was a little tough. The bread was perfectly crunchy/chewy. I had a bite of my friend's Media Noche (Cubano on sweet bread), which was very good.

One of the guys behind the counter was making coffee and handing out samples. He was really pushing the Cuban coffee. Starbucks and my coworkers should be happy this place isn't close enough for my morning brew cause it is tasty and I would be wired all day.  A great addition to the neighborhood.

So worth the dehydration. I'm not really a mathmagician so I'm not going to estimate the mileage from Cuba to Chicago... but the fabulous Cuban flavors that have made their way over to this desolate stretch of Clybourn - in an old hot dog shack no less - have lost positively nothing in translation.  Take one step in the kitchy snack shack, then take a deep breath... Smell that? It's like liquid gold up your nose. Those scents of authentic dishes simmering away... plaintains, yuca frita, empanadas, pork, rice and beans transport you somewhere tropical and so far removed from Chicago, it's the best vacation you could ask for this close to home.  I'll go out on a limb and confidently say you'll enjoy anything you order here... there's something for everyone, even you hard-to-please picky eaters. Big highlights for me were all of the empanadas (especially the one with guava), the lechon (pork) dinner - so tender, so flavorful - and the bistek (steak) dinner with loads of garlic punch and amazing onions saddled up to the best and tangiest black beans I've ever had.

What señor dueño needs to do is get better employees and a larger space.  The girl who took orders couldn't understand the request of No Onions/Cebollas.  She asked me twice if I wanted them, checked twice with my friend AND actually put them in another customer's meal.  She must have an onion obsession (maybe it's necessary for the Cuban authenticity, but they already prepare tender Ropa Vieja so who cares if there's no onions too).  Not to mention that both employees don't speak Spanish and pronounce every food item like pure Gringos.  I thought 90 Millas would have a larger seating area as in a restaurant, instead of being a 10 seat, primarily take-out joint.  I guess the Cuban wall decor makes up for it with wallpaper of Cuban newspapers and fun paintings on the exterior.  Oh well, it was worth the trip.",0.9836,0.874,0.103,0.022,0.4873626373626374

2008-11-23,5.0,"Now, THIS is what I am talkin' about!  No, ""Pan Cubano?  What's that?"" Or, ""Drink this nasty stuff we call a milkshake.""  No, 90 Miles is the real deal and nearly everything about it is incredible. It was a cold, drab and dreary late-Autumn day when I found myself on the way to 90 Miles.  I hadn't gone grocery shopping and rather than do it, I decided to get some Cuban food.  One Belmont bus ride later, I arrived at the small, but nicely designed restaurant.  The murals reminded me of Florida, the walls are covered in Cuban newspaper clippings and the blackboard has everything you need to know about that yummy food that awaits you.  Judging from my open mouth stare at the blackboard, the owner offered me a menu so as to concentrate on my order - and stop my drooling.  He didn't need to offer.  I knew what I wanted: a pan cubano and black beans.  He asked if I was cold from being outside (""yes"") and suggested some soup in lieu of the beans.  At the point, his wife (and co-owner) said, ""He wants beans!  You gotta have beans on a day like this, right?""  Since the onslaught on my senses had rendered me as open mouthed and immobile as Ralphie in the presence of a department store Santa Claus, I nodded and was directed to sit at the dining room counter (along with everyone else). I retrieved my Coke, pulled out my stool and started to take it all in.  CNN was on the tv, but all I could concentrate on were the great smells, refrains of Tito Puente-esque (yes, I know he's boricua) drumming, colorful menus and relaxed atmosphere.    Lost in my reverie, I almost didn't notice that my food was in front of me.  There it was: crispy white bread, ham, roasted pork, cheese, pickles and mustard, cut diagonally and pressed flat.  And a cup of black beans.  The sandwich tasted every bit as good as I remembered from my days in the Sunshine state.  The black beans were full of flavor, thick and rich.  I added some hot sauce to my beans for an extra kick.  I only needed a couple of drops to make it perfect.  As I finished my meal, I gave the thumbs up sign to the female owner, smiled, bussed my table and, trying to be suave whilst maintaining conversation with her, threw away the basket my food came in.  At least I saved the silverware from a trashy fate.  Just call me, ""Grace."" I'll definitely be back.  Next time, I am getting the lechon sandwich...and black beans.  Come to 90 Miles and get the BEST Cuban food in Chicago, hands down.  The decor is inviting, the music is great and the food is outstanding.  I do have one caveat you should know before coming: be prepared to preserve and up your sexy.  You do not want to roll in here with a baseball cap and your 'fat sweats.'  ""But, Johnny T,"" you ask, ""why not?  I am coming here to get a serious grub on.""  Yes, you are.  BUT the owners are both so strikingly attractive, you're going to want to look good as well - just to be in their presence.  Not since Brangelina took over the tabloids, have we, as a society, been faced with such a great looking couple.  Bronzed skin?  Check.  Jet black hair.  Check.  Great teeth?  Check.  Great attitudes, amazing food and gracious personality?  Check, check, check.  If we're stuck with 90 months of cold winter, there's no other place better than 90 Miles to bring some needed heat to the season.",0.999,0.772,0.192,0.037,0.5427808302808302

2008-11-20,5.0,"I saw a blurb on this place today and as I mentioned to a client and friend of mine about it, she stopped me in mid sentence and said ""Yes!! My boyfriend loves that place!!"" Well... that is about all the recommendation I needed. Hearing that they do take out, I decided to stop in on my way home. The place is small, but there is street parking and a small little lot to the side of the place. Walking in, the walls are plastered with articles, autographed photos, news clippings, money, comics and other mementos of Cuban life. If you do choose to eat here, the areas are small, more like a sit on a stool, munch on a counter place with bottles of hot sauce in front of you. No fancy tables or anything like that... 'cause you know what? (What?) It doesn't need it. The food itself is pretty damn amazing.  The owner is behind the counter, super nice and very friendly. I was curious about what somethings were and he was more the happy to explain them. I decided to get the chicken dinner, (chicken, choice of rice and beans and sweet plantains), and an order of yuca con mojo. Just under $14, I eagerly anticipated getting home. By the time I got home, my car was swimming in the smells of garlic and spices, but more or less my head was and stomach were spinning from my hunger pains and eagerness to check out my dinner.  I opened up my container, Sweet Jebus! There is a lot of food here for $14!! A large butterflied chicken breast well cooked, not dry but not super moist, (kinda how I like it), with a ton of sauteed onions on top. A huge helping of dirty rice, (I can be dirty sometimes...), and three slices of sweet plantains. The chicken was great, flavorful, but not overwhelmed with spices, the rice was the same, not too dry or wet, but full of flavor and the plantains were soft, but firm, sweet with just a touch of savory. Then came the Yuca con Mojo. The yuca really is a cassava, (think a really starchy potato), which you can get either stewed or fried, (I got fried), and came with a great garlic sauce. The sauce really is more like an olive oil with garlic in it and I want to say vinegar, but really be careful, there is enough garlic in there to choke a horse. Not like I would know... I like animals.. just sayin.... However I don't know if it is that strong yet, I haven't breathed on anyone yet... but just a warning. Besides the dinners, they have about 13 sandwiches, including some veggie options, (their veggie has Portabella, red and green peppers, zucchini, grilled onions, and Swiss cheese... um yum?), a large choice of side dishes as well as tropical shakes, (the drinks, not the involuntary body movement you have by the equator),  as well as hot drinks including Cuban coffee. Oh and a few breakfast options! Nothing on the menu is over $10, (at least not at the time of this review), plenty of options to munch on, friendly owner, really what isn't there to like?

I love that they have a little eating area on stools, and the décor makes you feel like you have stepped into a Havana quick bite spot! The big man and I came here on Saturday night whilst we were out on the town (a.k.a. on our way to Costco). We decided on the croquetas, and two sandwiches: media noche (ham, roast pork, swiss, pickles and mustard on sweet bread) and the guajirito (green plantains, steak, lettuce, tomato, grilled onions and swiss cheese) with the plantains serving as the bread. The media noche was tender, with succulent meats, and the mustard and pickles added something unique, along with the sweet bread, nicely holding the ingredients together, but flat enough to not be focused 100% on the carbs. I loved my guajirito, which was a nice combo of ingredients, with a nice mild flavoring. The only complaint I could see people having is that the meat is not flavored, and I could see people thinking that the sandwich lacks flavor. I, however, like that the flavoring is all natural, and not added with salt or heavy sauces. The plantains holding the sandwich together tasted like two big potato chips, not crispy, but firm yet flakey with that potato / banana taste. So delicious!!!! I love that they have plantain chips as sides as well. Although we both agreed that the croquetas were not up to par, the sandwiches were so delicious that they made up for them. Also, the owner was sitting right next to us as we ate and he is totally invested in making sure that his guests are happy. We took a bread pudding to go and ate it as a treat later on that night.

Coming off my high of cemitas, 90 miles Cuban sandwiches are equally delightful. The minute I stepped into this place I wanted to see if my mom was back in the kitchen working. I mean just the aroma I smelled opening the door was instantly reminiscent of her cooking. I had the Cuban sandwich, a guava and cheese pastelito and a cafe Cubano. All of that was spot on to what I used to have frequently when I lived in South Florida. So there goes one thing I used to miss from living down there ... now what to do about the year long hot weather? The only knock I can give this place is that it is small and if you go when it is busy, you may end up having to take your food to go.

2008-10-23,5.0,"I moved back to Chicago from South Florida about 4 years ago, and in that time have only missed one thing about that godforsaken land - properly prepared Cuban food and coffee.  The offerings Chicago has had up until now have not only been disappointing, but borderline offensive (pickles and mustard do not a cubano make!) Not to mention that a few of the existing establishments were banking on the mojito crowd to be forgiving towards their cuisine. I recommend the Lechon sandwich; having tried a handful of items, this is the one I crave continuously. Is it the perfectly tender (and generously portioned) pork? That alone could carry the sandwich, but the sweet plantains are probably the clincher. The garlic sauce is just enough to keep the sandwich moist without being too overwhelming or saucy. This, paired with a frosty can of Ironbeer, is true comfort food. Last note, the owner is amazing. While in the shop last night, a young woman came in to pick up her first ever order from him. He was insistent that, should there be any problems with the food with it being a to-go order and therefore not presented in optimal conditions, she come back the next day to get a refund! Not to mention his charming send-off of ""See you tomorrow!"" every time you leave.

I also had the Yuca con Mojo which is garlic-ey and great and my wife had the Veggie dinner. She is a pretty hard critic but was extremely pleased with the veggies, rice and black beans. She doesn't like bananas so I ate her plantains. They were sweet and delicious. Soft with a bit of crispiness from the caramelizing sugars. It's a really cute place and the owner is very friendly.
