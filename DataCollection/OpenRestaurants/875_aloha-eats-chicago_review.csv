It's paired perfectly with the gravy over rice. The macaroni side salad is also unique.  In correct Hawaiian fashion, you must try the spam masubi.

Whether you eat in or take out, they'll put the food in a take out box and generally fill it to the brim.  The macaroni salad is just okay...it's mainly a mixture of macaroni and mayo with a tiny bit of salt and pepper. I ordered the BBQ chicken entree and the Loco Moco, both having an iconic kind of authentic label: The BBQ chicken tasted imo like the terriyaki chicken at Panda Express, and the loco moco tasted like a runny egg over 2 rounds of meatloaf over a bed of rice. A little disappointed at the entrees I ordered, but given the vast menu and the fact that I never ordered the Katsu PLUS the price and the quantity, I'd give this place 4 stars. Wish there were more vegetables..the little side of raw cabbage and the seaweed around the spam matsubi don't count for much folic acid!

The pork and cabbage are largely flavorless, as another review has mentioned. Normally, bland is a bad thing, but I don't mind it too much in this dish. I add soy and a spicy sauce for flavor. I think the cabbage saves this dish. It adds texture and moisture.  - The mini loco was still very large.  - The spam musubi is decent. I like mine better. - The BBQ sauce was too strong.

Like borderline too much, and that's bad news cuz I keep eating 'til my food is gone. And it's crispy, warm, delish.. and just.. I can't not eat it, ya know? It also comes with two scoops of rice (stickier than regular, of course) and macaroni salad. I've had better macaroni salad (that place in Cali) but honestly just drizzle a bit of soy sauce over it and it's bomb diggity.. or maybe I'm just addicted to salty foods.

2017-05-19,4.0,"When I saw there was a Hawaiian BBQ place nearby, I immediately set plans to grab some food. When I went to college in CA there was a Hawaiian BBQ place that had a great deal on chicken katsu every week, so naturally I ate it almost every week. Although Aloha Eats doesn't have the weekly deals, their food is just as good and filling. The place has a relaxed Hawaiian kind of feel, with a bunch of knick knacks and random postings on the walls. The space is pretty tight, so I would recommend ordering to go or dining in during the less busy hours. The service here is always great, you really get the family business feel from the restaurant. They always seem to pop your order out within a couple minutes so if you're hungry you won't have to wait 20 minutes for your food. Honestly i haven't tried anything except the chicken katsu (it's just too good to pass), however they offer a bunch of unique plates such as fried shrimp, BBQ pork/chicken, and spam musubi (grilled spam, rice and nori). Chicken Katsu 4/5: This plate is amazing when I'm in the mood to just gorge on something deep fried and delicious. The amount of food you get is actually ridiculous (the plate is probably enough for two people to share...but I never do). The chicken is breaded and crispy and they give you a huge pile of them. You can ask to get white meat for a bit more, but I prefer the juicy dark meat in this meal. The meat is loaded on top of steamed rice, and a side of macaroni salad. Although it isn't the most flavorful macaroni salad I've tasted, it's a good staple. The sauce on the side is delicious to dip the chicken in ( I personally add sriracha to it for an extra flavor kick). Overall the meal is a great portion and all under 10 dollars. Although I haven't tried much at this place, I have no hesitation recommending people to come try their food.

Well, per Wikipedia research: ""Musubi"" is a popular snack and lunch food in Hawaii composed of a slice of grilled spam on top of a block of rice, wrapped together with nori (seaweed). I've overheard conversations between supposed ""foodies"" in the restaurant scoffing at musubi. I don't get it. Is it not refined enough for your palate?

Served up in classic Hawaiian style styrofoam containers, but that's just how they do.  The patty was maybe slightly overcooked, and def needed some salt and maybe a little more seasoning in the gravy.  Decent for what I was in the mood for.  Had the Aloha Brand POG (Passion Orange Guava), I much prefer the Hawaiian sun over the Aloha made which is a bit watered down.",0.5267,0.946,0.054,0.0,0.4511574074074074

2016-09-14,4.0,"This place has been on my list for a long time, but I've only ever stopped by for small snacks until the other day when I made room in Aloha for dinner. Mealtime aside though, Lunch plates are the mainstay here, and they come with two scoops of rice, a scoop of macaroni salad, and a protein of your choosing. These mainly consist of said proteins(beef, chicken, pork, tofu) or combinations thereof, prepared in katsu, curry, or bbq form, along with a few other Hawaiian classics including spam, hamburger patties, short ribs, all forms of homey, satisfying comfort food. These portions are actually quite large, and while I got the double chicken plate and was able to finish it in one serving(I was very full), it could have easily sufficed for two. For smaller eaters, they also serve mini plates which remove a scoop of rice and give you a little less of the protein option, and which are decently filling enough to satisfy most for a lunch or dinner. The regulate plates run around $10 each while the mini plates are $7, so you'll be getting good bang for your buck here, and won't be leaving hungry.  First thought upon getting my double chicken plate was the amount of chicken they gave. Three large pieces of flattened bbq chicken thighs along with a sizeable portion of chicken katsu. They second thing of note, the crispiness of the katsu. Even after pouring over the katsu sauce, there was still an audible crunch with every bite, bringing together panko crumbs with juicy chicken and sweet katsu sauce. Balancing this out with the creaminess of the mac salad and a sizeable spoonful of rice made for a meal that, while not all too complex, was all very satisfying.  Overall, Aloha eats would be a great mainstay to have in the neighborhood just for reliable, warm comfort food. They do what they do well, and offer plenty of it. PS. They also serve a serve a variety of fun snacks, including various musubis(meat on rice block, wrapped in nori) and sriracha lollipops. Nom",0.9913,0.841,0.134,0.025,0.5324506387921021

The meats were well marinaded and the amount of food I received was huge. The macaroni salad is a bit bland, but it helps mellow out the flavours and combine them together nicely for me. One bite of mac salad+meat+rice = yum. Pork tonkatsu: The tonkatsu here is thinner than what I'm used to, so this may be a Hawaiian thing. Nonetheless, still decent and they give you a LOT of tonkatsu. I think maybe 3-4 times what you would normally get.  Curry sauce: This was really salty for me, so I didn't use much of it.

The bbq beef was also overly salted that it left me drinking lots of water when I got home. Another problem I had was with the girl with the glasses on the register under the name of Isabel.

2015-08-11,4.0,"Aloha to me and these big portions! Fantastic Hawaiian here in Chitown. I grew up eating katsu from my parents making them, to ordering a large tray in from our local Chinese restaurant during family gatherings. There is something about a nice fried piece of chicken cutlet that just gets the job done, and that's one of the best items here at Aloha. I ordered a mini chicken katsu box ($7) along with fried spam musubi ($5). Yep, you heard me, FRIED SPAM. While it was supposed to be mini, the chicken katsu came out to be a lot of food for just one meal. The battered chicken in panko flakes was fried nicely- not too heavy or burnt where you could no longer taste the meat. The macaroni salad was very creamy but not overpowering, making it a great side. As for the musubi, that in itself was a meal. I can't say that it was that different from a regular spam musubi, so I'd save the extra calories and go with the basics. Never had spam before? Now would be the perfect time to try it. Only negative thing I'd say is that they were a bit stingy with their katsu sauce. They only include it if you order some kind of katsu, and will charge you $1 for more (esp those that want the sauce but didn't order anything fried). Usually stores offer these up for free, but oh well... minor detail in an overall great lunch. Keep doing your thing Aloha!",0.9611,0.795,0.133,0.072,0.5743273967411898

I think it was the grease that took some getting used to but since then I've eaten Hawaiian in several other places and looking back, Aloha Eats got it right. Now that I've evolved to a pro-grease stance in that ""let's food splurge every so often"", this is my review: I ordered the Chicken Katsu and a side of macaroni salad. The Katsu was nicely breaded and paired nicely with the cold macaronic salad. The macaroni salad was a hearty serving size that ended up as a large enough amount for left overs.

I was hoping that the kahlua pork would taste similar to the kahlua pork I tried in hawaii, but it said ""our version of kahlua pork"" which already made me hesitant. I tried it out nonetheless. It had too much cabbage (in proportion to the meat) and the meat was pretty bland. I definitely wouldn't get it again. However, the chicken katsu was amazing (perfectly fried, very crunchy) and came with a sweet sauce that was perfect for it. You can opt for a brown gravy instead of the sauce, but I'd totally recommend the sauce. I'd definitely come back for the chicken katsu plate. It made me still want to rate this place 4 stars despite the Kahlua pork.  Each plate was huge, by the way... came with 2 scoops of rice and 1 scoop of macaroni salad (which was delicious too).

It's served on top of a bed of cabbage to make you feel a little bit better devouring this carb bomb meal. The sushi rice is just the perfect texture and temperature. I could seriously eat this all day (thank god I don't live here, obesity here I come!) The Mac salad is definitely interesting- it's savory (no added sugar apparently) with a lot of white pepper.

I ordered the mini chicken katsu plate and despite the mini in the name, the portion was a good size. Definitely bang for the buck. The chicken katsu is unlike the seasoned katsu that I'm used to at Japanese restaurants. In fact the chicken is flavorless, and most of the flavor comes from dipping it into the sweet and savory sauce that the meal came in.  The macaroni salad was not my favorite. Too creamy for my taste.  Next time I'll probably get something with spam or one of the saimin instead of the chicken katsu.",0.5977,0.844,0.089,0.067,0.5617647058823529

Unfortunately, from the two times I've been here, I just didn't find the food very good. Some specifics: Pork Katsu - man, this is a lot of food. Generous portions of breaded pork, plain white rice, and macaroni salad. If you love this dish, this might be a good thing, but I didn't. The breading on the pork was a very thick, crunchy armor that did nothing to enhance the flavor of the unremarkable pork inside. The accompanying tangy sauce helps, but only a little. Heavily fried, so it doesn't take long to not feel very good about what you're eating. I found the macaroni salad to also be unremarkable. Fried Shrimp - exactly the same comments as the pork katsu, except replace ""pork"" with ""shrimp."" If I ever go again, I will stay away from the fried stuff. Hawaiian BBQ Mixed Plate - a little better, but all of the meats were mostly uninteresting. Like the above plates, served with plain white rice and macaroni salad. I mostly fail to see what makes the BBQ meats Hawaiian.

Upon entering we were greeted. Thanks to Instagram and Facebook posts I knew exactly what to get. Spam Misubi, Chicken Katsu, and Teriyaki Chicken, and 2 Hawaiian soft drinks. Our order totaled up to $30.  Food was prepared in less than 15 minutes, and these boxes were LOADED with food. Lets just say at Aloha Eats you really do get what you pay for.  Chicken Katsu, perfect. Served with their Aloha Eats sauce which tastes good on everything.  Teriyaki Chicken, perfect. Not too dry, meat was very tender and juicy.  Spam Misubi, could be better but I'm not complaining there was a ton of rice, and the slice of Spam was huge.  Soft drinks. I'm not a huge fan of sweet drinks; mainly a water drinker. But since the drinks were labled ""imported from hawaii"" I had to give it a try. Glad I tried it, tastes amazing, non carbonated juices, low in calories.  Overall.  Great tasting food.

If you want to fill yourself up for very little money, this is a great choice ( i got a drink, 2 hamburger steaks, rice, and macaroni salad for about $7). In fact, compared to a lot of places at this price point, I think this is a really good pick. I'm not familiar with Hawaiian food, but if this is a good example of it, it is great comfort food. However, nothing on the menu felt fresh or remotely healthy. I feel like there would be plenty of fresh fruit or fish options to choose from, but everything was mostly loaded with carbs and very salty. I got the hamburger steak mini plate that come with rice and macaroni salad. The hamburger steaks tasted like meatloaf in gravy. That may sound unappetizing, but I liked it fine. The whole thing reminded me of a TV dinner or frozen meal, however. For some that's very nostalgic, but for me it was more of an unexpected element to the food. the rice tasted really good when mixed with the gravy. I didn't care for the macaroni salad because it was like a macaroni and coleslaw mixture--but I bet many would like this combo. The place is tiny, but the staff are really nice and the people who come and eat here also feel like a very nice and laid back crowd.

Growing up eating island food, Aloha Eat's menu, on paper, would seem to be my comfort food haven.  Unfortunately, almost every dish I've tried seems to just miss the satisfying mark somehow. The BBQ Mix Plate gets you A LOT of meat - bbq/teriyaki chicken, bbq beef and short ribs.  Of the three, I would say the chicken is the best.  The bbq beef was marinated to a point where it simply tasted like soy/salt, and the short ribs were really tough for some reason. LocoMoco is one of my favorite dishes ever.  A ground beef patty, topped with a savory gravy and a sunnyside up egg is simply heavenly...when done right.  Aloha Eats efforts here are admirable.  However, the patty was too salty, and the gravy simply lacked a depth of flavor. Now, I love me some spam, so how can you really mess up spam musubi?  Well, by having the wrong spam to rice ratio.  One thin slice of spam and 8-10x the amount in height of rice?!  I couldn't even taste the spam there was sooo much rice!  Even the teriyaki sauce didn't come through. Ok, just one more gripe.  Spam, Eggs and Rice for over $8 with tax?!  That's just plain extortion.  I don't blame you, I blame myself to giving in to a craving after a run along the lake.  That ish would be 3.99 at a McDonalds in HI AND come with portuguese sausage and a drink.

Either way, it was yuck and if you love the macaroni from this place we should go together so you can have my portion. See, I'm considerate.  Onto the pork. Okay, so the word that I would say I felt when I opened up my tray was really confused. It's described differently from what I expected, I was expecting something borderline sweet. This pork is savory. Not salty, but very very savory. After a few bites I had to take a break because I think my palate was confused.

The short ribs have very good, sweet flavor...love it! the chicken & beef is very good as well. All plates come with 2 scoops of rice and 1 scoop of macaroni salad.

I also ordered some Spam Musubi to go because that's just how I roll when it comes to Spam.

2013-01-06,5.0,"If I needed to name a favorite place to eat in the city (as a person on a college student budget) I would have to say it's Aloha Eats. The first time I went there was probable a year ago and I actually had never heard about it before - My friend and I got stuck in the middle of a winter snow storm after going to the Urban Outfitters down the street and were trying to find a place to eat.  We had walked into 2 other restaurants and were disappointed by their menu and were continuing down Clark but it was Aloha Eats that got us to stop. Let me just say, the owner is one of the friendliest people I have ever witness working.  When we walked in, he greeted us so quickly (and really genuinely) and told us if we had any questions about the menu, just to ask.  I ended up ordering the double chicken plate, imagining it'd be a literal plate with maybe 3 pieces of meat on it, whatever.  I also switches the macaroni salad to the fries because I am not much of an adventurer and when I asked him about it he was just like 'no, trust me.  get the salad'.  So I did. No regrets.  Jesus, even if I did regret it, I had like half a chicken's worth of meat on my plate to eat instead.  And when I say plate, I mean like a styrafoam take out box like the one that I used to get from a Chinese buffet and would be able to share with my family of 4.  The serving size is ridiculous.  It'd be perfect for two people, maybe 3, if you're not that hungry or are friends with 2 people who eat like they're trying to fit into a prom dress.  Some people say that this place wouldn't be that romantic for a date or anything... I feel like this would be significantly better than a Lady in the Tramp sort of moment with spaghetti.   Anyways, I love this place.  A new pro that I found out recently is that Aloha actually also uses the Belly card system which is fantastic.  I love the fact that I can earn point and food just for stopping in... It's definitely working to draw people in since I am making treks down there way more often because I am so close to getting free things.",0.9962,0.756,0.187,0.056,0.45579755892255897

I was dying to get my hands on some Hawaiian macaroni salad since I went on my honeymoon 5 years ago so I, of course, HAD to have that.  We ended up going with the smaller lunch plate sizes of the short ribs and the chicken katsu.  They both came with one scoop of macaroni salad and one scoop of white rice and the chicken katsu came with their katsu sauce (which tastes like sweet and sour mixed with ketchup, know it doesn't sound good, but it's FANTASTIC!)   Both choices were great!!  The macaroni salad was exactly like I remembered it in Maui, mmmm mmmm!!  Creamy, a tiny bit sweet and just SO good!  The short ribs had a great flavor but could have been a little more tender for my liking, but I would definitely order them again.  And the highlight was the chicken katsu!!  It was SOO flavorful and crispy and the sauce that accomponied it was so good.  You also have the option of getting it with their brown gravy but I didn't see that until after we left or I would have gotten some of that on the side, too.  Next time.

Aloha Eats delivers a solid mixed plate lunch complete with rice and mac salad.  It reminds me of a popular local joint on Maui called Aloha Mixed Plate (if you're ever on Maui, you MUST go).  While the food may not be as 'authentic' as on the islands, this is the best Hawaiian food you'll find in Chicagoland and probably even in the Midwest. My personal faves at Aloha Eats are the spam musubi, loco moco, katsu and kalua pork.  Though, we've pretty much tried the whole menu and everything is a win.  Portions are generous.  The mac salad is so simple yet so good...I try to recreate it at home, but it always tastes better here.  They have canned juice imported from Hawaii including POG.  Desserts are delish and everything on the menu is reasonably priced and won't break the bank. The staff is great, very friendly and fast counter service.  If you're dining in, seating can be sketchy since it's not a big place (only about 4 tables that seat 2-4 people, comfy wooden booths and tables) and a counter facing the window with a couple of seats.  Walls are decorated with vintage Hawaiian memorabilia and it's a clean place.  They deliver the food to you once it's ready.  Carrying out is easy and quick.  Very casual with an Aloha feel.

I usually order the Double Chicken (Katsu and BBQ), BBQ Mix Platter, or the Loco Moco: each is under $10 for a huge serving and they all make my mouth water. The Katsu could have a better batter (it's usually a tad bit tough and a little under-seasoned, in my opinion), but it tastes great when you get a spoonful of macaroni salad in the same bite. The Loco Moco ground beef is usually a bit overcooked, too, but the gravy makes up for it (it's so rich and addicting). I do want to come back for Saimin once it gets a bit colder again. I guess I should get some musubi soon as well. The value (5/5): Spectacular. I eat a lot and this place still manages to fill me up for $10. The service (5/5): Their cashier is great.

We had never eaten Hawaiian food before and it had a few good reviews on yelp, so we decided to check it out. The restaurant was kind of small, but it provided a comforting feeling nonetheless. The place was relatively clean, aside from a few flies buzzing around here and there, but I'm assuming that is pretty difficult to manage given the summer heat these days.  I ordered the chicken katsu and BBQ beef combo. Our food came out very promptly, so no complaints there. Although my meal did not look very appetizing, it actually tasted rather delicious. The beef was seasoned well and it was also tender. The breaded chicken was kind of plain, but they provided a nice dipping sauce to scarf it down with. The portions were huge, so that was an added benefit as well. I also had a wonderful strawberry guava drink from there. Overall, Aloha Eats is pretty awesome. Unfortunately I cannot claim that it is my favorite place in Chicago, but for the money, it is definitely an awesome joint to dine with a few friends.",0.9955,0.664,0.279,0.058,0.6474493705528189

Trust me.* Since first eating here a few weeks ago, I always make it a point to stop in here when I'm in the neighborhood and pick up some spam musubi (because a fat kid will always be hungry later and must be prepared!).

Thankfully I don't live that close and parking is always impossible to find or I might eat there every week, which, when your favorite plate is the Loco Moco (two scoops rice or fries and a scoop of mac salad topped with two Hawaiian style burger patties, brown gravy and two eggs any style), could be a very bad thing. I can't say I've tried everything but I've probably come pretty darn close. My favorites in no particular order are as follows: Double chicken plate (both BBQ chicken and chicken katsu) Chicken curry plate (katsu chicken with a curry flavored brown gravy instead of the sweet katsu sauce, GET IT WITH FRIES INSTEAD OF RICE, anyone who's everbeen to an Irish pub knows how awesome curry fries are) Kaluhu Pork (slow braised pork with cabbage, salty sweet and delicious. One time I actually had to pull my car over and dig into it because it smelled so intoxicatingly good I could wait until I got home) SPAM Musubi (kinda like a giant SPAM sushi 2-pack, I get this every time I go, one for now and one for later) I also really like their burgers (a tasty Hawaiian style patty with little bits of chopped onion in it and a flavor reminiscent of teriyaki) I always get a double scoop of mac with my burger rather than fries.  some other items I have had in the past and enjoyed are the short ribs (Korean kalbi style) BBQ beef (thin sliced teriyaki style) Mahi mahi both grilled and fried, and the saimin noodles.  you can also choose from an assortment of canned hawaiian juices and my favorite part of all is that they provide little to-go cups for you to mix your siracha with ketchup cause it tastes good on everything. Did I mention? the plates of food are big enough to feed a family?  One of the things that I love most about Aloha is their unwillingness to compromise on the size of authentic Hawaiian plate lunch, yes their prices have gone up quite a bit over the years but the size has never ever gone down, we even asked the owner about the price hikes and he said that as food costs have gone up he would never consider down sizing the plates as so many other establishments have done, it just wouldn't be the real deal anymore if it were made smaller. Thankfully, for those with smaller appetites or smaller wallets they have more recently made mini plates available. (Just for a comparison, the prices of the mini plates are what the full-size plates cost seven years ago) even with the higher prices the majority of the large combo plates are still under ten bucks and you will easily get two meals out of it.

The food is great!  If you're expecting sit-down style fancy food, you're in the wrong place.  This is everyday style food.  I love the combination plate (BBQ ribs, chicken, and beef).  I'm a fan of the mac salad, but if you're not (like some of my friends) you can swap out for french fries.  The spam masubi is also worth a try! The location is great, but the parking situation is not.  It's on Clark and it's in a busy stretch.  So the location is great for pedestrians and anyone in the area, but it can be a mess when you need to park!  HOWEVER, they deliver.  Yep... people might not notice, but I've ordered take out from them before, they're prompt, there's a small fee, but for the convenience factor... who cares.

2011-11-03,2.0,"Their menu was very limited.  I would have expected this would have meant the few items they do have would be better.  I assumed incorrectly. Let's start with way food is served.  I ate in the restaurant.  I ordered a plate lunch.  My meal was served, as all are in this venue, in a styrofoam to-go box with plastic utensils.  Not on a plate, as I've had it in Hawaii.  The katsu sauce was served on the side in another to-go container, and there was not enough for the dish. The pork katsu.  Plenty of food?  Yes.  Fried to within an inch of it's life?  Definitely.  My jaw hurt when I gave up, about halfway through.   This page, unafilliated with a restaurant, is what pork katsu should look like.   closetcooking.com/2008/0… See how the pork appears to be tender?  That's what you expect.  The dish was bland.  The sauce was bland.  The macaroni salad lacked the texture and sauce of that found in a good plate lunch you get on the islands. The guy behind the register was nice, and suggested the loco-moco, but I really didn't want to try that on my first visit.  I don't plan to make another one though, and have steered my friends away. Operating a fryer, once you have the knack, is fairly simply.  If the pieces of food are of the same size, the oil fresh enough and at the same temperature, you can achieve consistent results with your product.  Get the timing right, and it's pretty hard to mess it up. I'm sorry to say, I did not tip; a rarity for me.  I didn't want any money going back to the cook for what I got.",0.8908,0.872,0.081,0.047,0.47180952380952385

2011-11-01,3.0,"I don't know much about Hawaiian food...so when I happened to be in the neighborhood visiting my friend Molly I decided to swing by this joint and give it a whirl. I ordered the mini chicken katsu plate.  It came with a side of macaroni salad and a scoop of white rice....along with a sweet katsu dipping sauce. I was impressed with the portion I received.  For your money, they seem to really hook it up.  The chicken katsu consists of thin strips of boneless chicken  fried with a batter. The flavor of the batter was pleasant, but it was way too crunchy to enjoy.  I mean, clearly, it wasn't burnt or anything...but damn...why so crunchy? This chicken was so crunchy I thought it was covered in grape nuts cereal. To put things lightly, I almost broke a tooth eating this.  The menu mentions something about katsu sauce or an optional gravy sauce alternative. I ask for a side of gravy sauce to see how it is (I am all about the sauce). The lady at the register tell me it's gonna cost me an extra dollar-sixty. I stare at her...waiting for her to tell me that she is kidding....she wasn't.  I fork over the money and they give me this bowl of instant gravy.  I'm talking about the type of instant gravy that you put on instant mash potatoes. The katsu sauce was better...but after a while I was afraid my teeth were going to be destroyed from the hard, crunchy chicken.   The macaroni salad was my favorite part.  This mixed with the white rice...the creamy texture...the mayo.  I would definitely get two scoops of mac salad next time. The have exotic Hawaiian juice cans.  I washed my food down with the guava juice.  It was good.  I will have to come back here again and try their beef short rib next time.

2011-09-23,4.0,"There's something about gray skies that gets me hankering for Hawai'i. I wonder what. And while I haven't been there for many years (and didn't eat the plate lunch when I was there), katsu sauce can always turn my S.A.D. frown upside down. Wanting to make sure I was ordering correctly, I called the Queen of Hawai'i herself, Emi H, and had her walk me through the menu. After all, if you're going to do something, do it right. I hadn't been to Aloha Eats in years (just after it opened), so I didn't remember what I wanted. I just remembered that it tasted good. She pushed me toward the spam, but I couldn't do it. Spam musubi *is* rather tasty but that's about as far as I can take my spam eats. I just have too many mental blocks up to eat an entire plate of spam. So, knowing me, she compromised and told me to get the chicken katsu plate. I was leaning toward the curry plate but she told me what I needed what sweet katsu sauce and she needed to go because the woman works all the time and accomplishes mucho all over the big island. So, I hung up, ordered the katsu plate, waited an appropriate amount of time and headed home to chow down. I thought I might be pregnant. Not until I open the box and smelled the mixture of aroma did I realize that I *needed* macaroni salad in my life. Usually, the thought of mayonnaisey pasta makes me wretch. That day? I stirred it into my rice, placed it atop my chicken and then poured sweet sweet katsu sauce on top. I realize it sounds disgusting. Writing it even now makes me a little queasy. At the time, though. Slammin'. Slam.Min. From what I understand, Aloha Eats really benefits from having an authentic feel. They're not trying to be upscale or fusion. They're just offering Chicagoans a taste of what islanders chow down on on the daily. I can appreciate that. I can also appreciate the fact that I got enough food for two meals. Of course I ate it all in one setting but I didn't have to. Or, shouldn't have. Potato. Potatoe. Dead sexy. This is comfort food for the Vitamin D deficient. Prepare to see a lot of me, Aloha Eats.

2011-08-31,5.0,"This is the closest you can get to Hawaii in Chicago! With my obsession of Hawaii, I'm surprised it took me so long to get to this place after hearing about it last year.  Finally I set out to take a bike trip there.  Last Saturday, after watching Moody Church's first baptism on the lake that morning I continued my usual bike course to the Shedd and back north.  Already feeling famished and thirsty by 11am (no breakfast), realizing Aloha Eats was too far, I stopped at Navy Pier and got the lowest priced meal deal there:  a McD's Fish Meal $6 including a drink--the ice cold diet Coke most appealed to me right then.  Afterwards, I walked around Navy Pier to burn off some calories and shop for a present for my godson, Josh, whose birthday is coming up. I headed back north along the path fighting a southwest breeze, it was a relief to leave the path as I headed for Aloha Eats.  Somehow I got side-tracked along Lincoln--oh those diagonal streets--but I finally found my way to Clark Street.  I sighted the attractive red lettering ""Aloha "" beckoning me in.  At long last, I was going to get the simple yet pleasing rice/meat/shredded cabbage/macaroni salad combination that I was introduced to in Maui. A young man greeted me with the familiar layed-back friendly Hawaiian aura at the counter and took my order of the Hawaiian BBQ Mix Plate - $9.40 BBQ Beef, BBQ Chicken, and BBQ Beef Short-Rib.  For a moment I was imagining myself back in Maui which was easy to do on one of the few beautiful perfectly warm sunny summer days in Chicago.   As I was waiting observing the different business ads/cards left on the counter and the menu items, I was interrupted by a snotty tone of, ""CAN YOU MOVE YOUR BAG?!""  Immediately I was brought back to reality--this would never happen in Hawaii.  I turned to see a young couple and their 2 kids seated at the table closest to the counter, the woman was standing ready to put her child in the baby carriage which my backpack must have been brushed up against.  I excused myself, but my beautiful day was tarnished by the rudeness of this person.  I couldn't help but feel sorry for her husband as I observed him addending to one of the kids seated next to him.  How horrible it must be being married to such a woman, and to think the kids not learning how say, ""excuse me"" or ""please"".  Seeing how they were not ready to leave, I decided to wait outside away from the negative spirit she released.  On my way out I over heard some reminising of a past vacation at another table.  I walked out into the Maui-like weather where the sidewalks were filled with happy people that day.  There was a unique bike/carriage next to a pole not far from where I locked my bike against a tree.  The father & son that owned it soon emerged as patrons of Aloha Eats.  I wondered how many times they had visited Hawaii, I figure with that cool bike, they could probably afford to go a lot more times than I could :)  Just as I walked back inside, my name was called and they were bagging my order.  I carefully placed it into my backpack and headed back onto Lincoln Avenue to stop at Trader Joe's and pick up some Italian wine that was recently recommended by my friend, Jeannie.  I thought it would go lovely with my Hawaiian dinner.  One more errand and an hour later I was home to enjoy my Hawaiian meal, it was great and the portion lasted me for 4 meals :)   I can't wait to go back and try every single item on the menu!   What are the chances of me running into that rude woman again?  Unfortunately with food this good--lots. Humm...maybe I'll have the Loco Moco next time!  Gound beef patty, eggs sunnyside up, over rice, topped with gravy?  Gashly I first thought,  ""Well, when in Maui, do like the Mauians eat.""....then I tried it.--""WOW"" (however, I believe credit was due to the Hawaiian raised beef & poultry, I doubt AE imports from Hawaii).",0.9913,0.826,0.116,0.059,0.4754343629343629

Rice, macaroni, sliced cabbage, and your choice of meat? Yes, please. The fatty, delectable beef and the juicy, teriyaki style chicken are wonderful.

We also eaves dropped on him talking to another table about the Hawaiian community in Chicago, and how they are distributed throughout the US.  Interesting stuff. I ordered the Double Chicken combo, where you get grilled chicken breast and a chicken katsu with sauce, macaroni salad, two scoops of rice, and cabbage.  For about $9, you get some pretty big portions.  I think that's what sold me: the portion size.  I felt pretty full after eating my order... and a third of my friends' order... cuz I'm a god damn garbage can.   Really liked it.  The macaroni salad has this not-so-macaroni-salad taste.  I know, I'm really articulate right now.  Anyway, it just didn't taste like the mayonnaisey sour tangy macaroni salad that (I guess) non-Hawaiian macaroni salad tastes like.  It was much creamier and awesome.  Went really well with the rice.  The grilled chicken was delicious, very tender and juicy.  The katsu was bountiful (see? articulate), so I had plenty to last me through the meal, with some good sauce to boot. Actually, I lied, I do have something slightly bad to say: the slices of cabbage were a pretty unwieldy.  They were sliced into strips. Really long strips.  They also were raw and large and just sorta got in my way when I ate things.  I was digging through shit, and they kept getting all up in my space, cuz they were so large and long.  Like, they'd flick across my food, cuz they're kinda bouncy and raw, y'know? And they didn't taste like much, they were just hard and crunchy.  I really wanted to ask them, ""why are you here?"" But everyone knows, cabbage are shy and don't like to talk.  True story.

Having had my fair share of Hawaiian food both in Hawaii and LA, my palate for hawaiian food is probably more spoiled than most; and as such, I wasn't expecting a whole lot from this place. But seeing how it's difficult to find a spam musubi of any quality here thousands of miles away from Hawaii, I'm not complaining about the existence of such a restaurant.  To start things off, I ordered a kalua pork and a combo plate of meats. A fair warning: the portions are HEFTY! Just try lifting the styrofoam box of food and you'll see what I mean. 1) Kalua Pork: meh...... the pork was ok, the cabbage tasted like wet napkins (Tasteless as Dennis S. Stated), but overall, it wasn't too bad. I actually liked the macaroni salad, it wasn't the best ever, but adaquate. 2) Combo meat platter: you get bbq short ribs, chicken, and beef all in 1 box. All 3 of the meats we got were perfectly cooked and wonderfully seasoned. I don't remember the last time I've had such tender chicken as I had been traumatized too many times by dry, overcooked chicken. The beef and shortribs were deliciously sweet and salty, perfectly representing the culinary tradition of the island. Oh and about those portions, we ate maybe 1/2 of what we ordered and took the rest to go, and it was just as delicious the next day. Not wanting to leave without grabbing a couple of obligatory misubis we ordered 1 order of 2 spam musubis.

I dragged three round eyes and a few rug rats with me to this place after a freezing visit to LP Zoo.  The portions are ridiculous, and we ordered way too much food!  Unless you are starving, you can probably go with a mini plate versus a full plate. Between the four of us and the crumb snatchers, we got pork katsu, bbq chicken, bbq short ribs, and fried shrimp.  All were good, but the bbq chicken stood out as the best.  The short ribs were a little fatty, and bit too chewy.  I probably won't ever get the pork or shrimp again.  Too much fried action there. Surprisingly the mac salad wasn't awful.  We are a bit leery of mac salad in general, but I ate mine up. So the great debate of whether or not to Spam.  Paying to eat spam at a restaurant seems like a travesty.  Aren't  you supposed to eat that crap when you are dead broke?  And not pay $7 for it at a restaurant?  The great debate will rage on the next time I step into Aloha Eats.",-0.7842,0.688,0.134,0.178,0.5021739130434782

I had to compare theirs with mine and see where everything stood. I may be biased but I think mine is definitely better.  It was $4.55 which is super cheap for a dinner but you only get 2 masubis. The masubis are just packed with rice! It would be super filling on just the two if I could fit it all in my mouth but I just can't. Theirs are way thicker then the ones I make at home. Plus, they don't put enough of the soy sauce mixture on it. So because it couldn't fit into my tiny mouth I was just left with a bunch of plain white rice at the end of my meal.

I guess I should've read more yelp reviews because we were surprised by how much food we got - the portions were huge! I should've taken a picture because it was almost too much for the styrofoam containers.  The chicken katsu was served separately from the curry sauce. I guess I am used to the curry sauce poured all over the katsu, but this time, it was in a container for dipping. The batter for the katsu was thick and crispy! Nothing that we've had before. Really good. . The kahlua pork was also delicious. Though,  there was little bit more cabbage than I would've wanted, hence the 4 stars.

The BBQ beef and short ribs are very tasty and my favorite.  They are marinated the beef in a soy, garlic, seseme-esque sauce - very similar to Korean BBQ beef. The egg noodle soup with Spam was tasty as well.  The broth had a nice flavor.  Plus you can't go wrong with egg noodles and Spam.   The chicken Katsu, I thought was just okay according to my palate, but then again, my palate requires a lot of spice.  The chicken Katsu is chicken tenderized to a very thin slice, breaded and fried.  It is served with BBQ sauce to add extra flavor. The fried shrimp was good and average.  Nothing special.  Breaded and fried, per usual.  One thing I liked was that the breading was too thick.   The macaroni salad is just macaroni pasta in a mayonnaise mixture.  It was mild in flavor, pretty tasty and it complimented the meal pretty well in adding variety of texture.   The ambiance was decent.  Cute decor, clean.  A good place to grab a quick bite with friends or by yourself.  Not a good place for romantic dates or large parties.

After reading that the plate lunches are gargantuan, I opted to go with the smaller, more figure-friendly mini-plate. The teriyaki-marinated Hawaiian BBQ chicken was calling my name! Not sure how healthy my meal became once you factor in the scoop of white rice and a side of the macaroni salad, but after a fierce stint at the gym, I figured I deserved it.  Once in my car, I inspected my to-go container less for accuracy and more for the amazing smell that had overtaken my Saab. Boo - unfortunately, my meal wasn't packed very well and the contents had spilled into the plastic bag. All three chicken filets had escaped and there was sticky sauce leaking everywhere. I realize that this is a ""mini-plate"", but I didn't think that meant I needed to handle it as if it were a baby! It appeared that too much food had been packed into a much too small container.  Finally home and inexcusably hungry (yeah, I forget to eat sometimes when I'm busy), I tore into my meal. At last, we're alone... and you know what? The macaroni salad was the best part. Simple with probably too much mayo, it was perfect. The rice was fine and tasted even better once mashed up against the teriyaki-glazed chicken. I did go with the white meat option, so maybe that's why the chicken wasn't as flavorful as I had expected. It could have used a bit more sauce, too. All in all, a decent meal especially considering the low price ($6 something and change). But would I finagle busy Clark St parking again for a slightly-better-than-average, ill-packaged meal? Probably not. Maybe I'm just missing something, but... aloha does mean ""hello"" and ""goodbye"".",0.9437,0.858,0.093,0.049,0.5256461131461132

I got the Hawaiian bbq mix plate here which consists of Hawaiian BBQ beef, BBQ chicken, and BBQ short ribs.  Now me being of Korean descent, I cannot say no to BBQ short ribs.   When the plate came out, it consisted of two scoops of rice, one scoop of macaroni salad, three big pieces of chicken, one slice of BBQ short ribs (which consists of three bones), and a scoop of Hawaiian BBQ beef over a bed of cabbage.   The macaroni salad was just the way I liked it.  It did not have an overpowering mayo or mustardy flavor.  In fact, the flavor I got most out of it other than a little sweet and creamy was pepper-y (if that's a word) due to the black pepper that was sprinkled into the mixture.  It was rather delicious. The Hawaiian BBQ beef was thinly sliced and had a lot of marinade flavor. The BBQ short ribs was the same thing: a lot of marinade flavor.  It wasn't overdone, but it was done more than I liked it to be (however that's because how much it's cooked in the Korean culture which I know is slightly less than in the Hawaiian style so how well it's cooked as a bad thing). But what threw me off about this dish was the BBQ chicken.  The chicken wasn't undercooked at all.  The marinade was the same which made the chicken flavorful, but the quality of the chicken is what turned me off from it.  Maybe it's because of when I use to do a lot of weight training/extreme college budgeting all I ate as protein was bargain priced chicken breast for about two bucks a pound.  For the amount of protein in it, the price is a steal.  However, the difference with this chicken is that they squirt artificial juices into this chicken as well as preservatives which gives it a stringier and mushier texture that after a little while can be very unappealing.  The BBQ chicken here was that exact same texture.  This made me believe that the chicken was probably refrigerated for a while or just of bargain price quality.  By the time I got to the third piece of chicken I had to force myself to eat it because... you know, there are starving people in other lands and you shouldn't waste food.  Other than the chicken, everything else I ate was fine and great for the price. Note to the wise: it's probably not the best to have this for the first meal of the day or as the first meal from eating clean and light for a while... because this will hit you HEAVY.  Especially if you decide to eat the whole thing in one sitting.",0.9663,0.875,0.091,0.034,0.5547249589490967

Portions are more very generous and you definitely get your money's worth.  Anything on the menu is fair game although I personally am not a fan of their BBQ chicken, not enough flavor (that's the 1/2 star missing from the review).  My usual order is the BBQ Beef plate, very rich in flavor and great portions enough for two. The staff that's commonly there is very friendly and helpful to those who are unfamiliar with the menu so don't be shy to ask for suggestions if it's your first time.  But I'd watch out for their new employee who I felt did not give as great of a customer experience as the employees I'm used to - but that's really nitpicking. All in all, if you haven't been here yet and you live within 30 minutes of the place by any means of transportation, you're really missing out.  REALLY missing out.",0.9853,0.799,0.145,0.056,0.4621434937611409

2010-06-13,5.0,"I've Tried: (My rating in parentheses) - BBQ Mix Plate(10/10) Funny, didn't know it was actually called ""Aloha Eats,"" I've always called it ""Aloha Grill."" Man do I miss this place! When I lived in the city for a year, we used to visit this place frequently! We were starting to get real good with finding parking spots too!  I guess since I only have 1 thing to review, I can explain a little bit about this place. The place is SMALL! There are like 5 tables and no bathroom. They serve your food in styrofoam carry out containers. Also, I know nothing about authentic Hawaiian cuisine, and actually, this is my one and only experience with the stuff. That was my only problem with this place. I had to always remember to goto the bathroom before, just in case, or goto the Starbucks across the street. Which reminds me...parking! I hope you're good at city parking. This is purely street parking, and Clark is a very busy street with tons of eateries, so finding a spot sucks! There're some residential areas around the area, so try there for parking, but beware of signs that say anything about a permit. Another thing, and probably most important, this is a cult-following kinda place. It's one of those places where one person raves about it, brings his friends, and his friends are underwhelmed. So, I'm one of those guys that's raving about it, so take this review how you'd like. BBQ MIX PLATE If you're on a diet, go away! This comes with 2 giant scoops of rice, some shredded cabbage, macaroni salad, and a bunch of korean bulgogi, galbi, and a few chicken breast fillets. These things are SOPPING with grease! The galbi is very fatty, so I end up having to cut around the fat. There's fat on the chicken too, and plenty on the bulgogi. In essence, this is probably very cheap meat, but what do you expect at a cult-following hole-in-the-wall type of joint? Now, even though the meat is bad quality (in terms of it having so much fat), it tastes AMAZING!  I have a chicken-phobia because grilled chicken tends to come out dry, and I HATE that! Thanks to the oil, this is not dry! Think of how juicy and moist KFC is, and yeah...it's like that! The chicken's been salted and seasoned plenty, so you might be able to eat it by itself... The galbi and bulgogi are just incredibly cooked! Man, if these guys had a Korean restaurant, and used good quality meats, we may even have a contender against some LA Korean BBQ! It's that good! The bulgogi and galbi have just the perfect balance of sweet and salty. The salty comes from soy sauce, and the sweet comes from, well, sugar, and there's also garlic and other stuff that goes in, for those not familiar with these. If anything, sometimes they can be very very very slightly salty, but usually it's dead on.  That Macaroni Salad is just freaking phenomenal! The problem is, it's so bad for you! I try real hard to not eat the whole portion they give, but it's just too good! The thing is, this whole dish explodes with so much flavor that the Macaroni Salad acts as kind of a balancer, both with taste and texture. As for the cabbage...um....if the flavors get too intense, I guess you can chew on that, but I usually leave it alone. Like I said, everything's greasy. I typically don't eat rice with Korean BBQ, but for here, I do eat a little bit, but with what I don't eat, I use it to wipe as much of the meat as possible, just to get some excess oil off...just for peace of mind. Whether it helps or not, I don't know, and frankly, don't care. Now, the final ingredient to all this, and this is just a personal taste, is Sriracha sauce. I love spicy foods and sauces! And I love Sriracha. The way I eat this whole meal is.... I open the container, and put all the meat onto the lid. I pour about 5+ tablespoons (I guess) of Sriracha sauce down on that lid too (told you I like this stuff!). I eat a tiny bit of rice, a giant part of chicken drenched  in Sriracha, and a little bit of Mac salad. I start with all the chicken first, then the bulgogi, and lastly the galbi. By the end, I'm practically wiping off the last bits of Sriracha with the galbi.  I'm drooling just thinking about this place! I miss living in the city! :(",0.9931,0.822,0.115,0.063,0.59984283625731

Since we got our food to go, I didn't check the bag for accuracy and I really wish I had because I was given a heavily breaded, super fried mahi mahi sandwich instead of the grilled sammy I was craving.  Maybe it was a blessing in disguise because it turns out the fried fish was actually absolutely delicious.  The batter is super thick giving the protein a most excellent crunch.  Mmm!  Someone's looking at some extra time on the treadmill today, but I don't even care.  It was worth it. I also sampled the chicken katsu, which is a boneless, skinless fried chicken breast, sliced over a bed of rice and served with katsu sauce on the side.  It's kind of like Hawaiian chicken fingers.  The sweet sauce is finger lickin' good.  I grabbed a taste of the fried shrimp, too.  It was moist and tasty.   Notice a theme here?  You pick the meat, they fry it up.  But they fry it up good!

The chicken was grilled and lovingly tossed in a perfect concoction of BBQ and terriyaki sauce, and super tender. Served with a generous portion of rice and macaroni salad and I was in love. Oh wait, can't forget about the cabbage and one slice of spam I ordered on the side. All the flavors were the perfect blend of salty, sweet, tangy and downright deliciousness.  It's like the best backyard barbecue ever and something tells me it's probably pretty authentic.

2010-03-29,3.0,"A lot of pluses and a lot of minuses equate a three-star rating. First, the pluses.  The food, for the most part, is good.  The plate lunch is a generous portion, and the mac salad is just the way I like it.  For those familiar with Hawaiian bbq, you'll feel right at home.  For those not, this is a reasonably priced excuse to try it.  The place is clean and the counter people are friendly.  The short ribs are excellent, but they aren't served like typical short ribs (you'll know what I mean when you see them) .  I love the spam musubi. On to the minuses.  I'm not a green crusader by any means, but this place could not possibly generate more useless garbage.  EVERYTHING, even the food eaten on-site, comes in a styrofoam box.  Regular plates and utensils would be very much appreciated. The musubi come wrapped in plastic.  Why, and how are they heated before serving (since they look like they've been made in advance)?  If they're made to order, why are they wrapped at all, unless they're to go?  I am glad they increased the size of the nori.  It used to be the width of a finger.  I wish they would cover the spam with it, as the combination of flavors is what I enjoy. I thought the fried shrimp were substandard, and the plate lunches come with a ton of undressed shredded cabbage.  Ugh. I want to address something that is a pet peeve of mine.  The musubi is often referred to as spam sushi.  The only thing the musubi have in common with sushi is that they're both made with rice.  Musubi is made with plain white rice.  Sushi rice is made through a long, laborious process.  Musubi are about the size of the palm of a hand, whereas sushi pieces . . . well, you know.  I don't know why this bothers me so much, but it does. This is a place that's worth going to, but not going out of your way for.  The best thing is, Molly's is right next door!",0.99,0.786,0.161,0.053,0.44776751026751027

I love SPAM and rice, but I couldn't get past the flavor of the seaweed and the soy sauce that was added to it, making it a little saltier than I had expected.

2010-01-25,5.0,"Ah, now this is what I'm talking about. By far one of my favorite places to eat in Chicago. Not only is the food fantastic - which we'll get to in a moment so hold your hula skirt, but service is nice and quick.  Side note - though it has nothing to do with the restaurant, the close proximity to Molly's Cupcakes doesn't hurt and makes for a pretty terrific food orgy. You know, if you're into that type of thing. I was recommended this place during a birthday lunch for me about 3 years back. The plan was bbq and when a co-worker suggested Aloha Eats I initially thought, ""Boo, that's not bbq."" But not wanting to go against group think and since I was getting a free lunch I said what the hell. Well, both the carnivore and the Islander I am were satisfied whole heartedly. The food reminded me of barbecues my parents use to have with the marinade they use for both the chicken and beef. It's got this nice salty but a hint of sweet and citrus taste to each morsel. While not the most vegetarian friendly place they do have tofu dishes or as they're called, plates, which is classic Hawaiian dining. I've gone here with vegetarian friends and they have left equally satisfied. Highlight dishes -  1. BBQ chicken - marinated to perfection, it's possibly by far the best thing on the menu. It's tender, aromatic and doesn't last long once in front of me.  2. Kalua Pork - the island version of pulled pork. No sauce needed for this piggy dish. 3. Loco Moco. Now this is a classic Hawaiian dish. Two hamburger patties, two eggs - any style you like but I recommend over easy and rice all covered with brown gravy. This combination might make you do a double take but once you dig in you'll be glad you made a good choice. - Quick history lesson. This dish actually originated in a small diner in Hawaii back in the 50's. Kids would come in after playing sports but wouldn't have much money so the cook took some of the cheaper ingredients to make a hearty meal. This has become a staple in Hawaii. 4. Spam. What other place in all of Chicago serves this tasty mystery meat? It's salty and when fried has a nice crisp outside and a meat inside. Spam can either be ordered on the side or as an item call Musubi which basically is a slice of spam on top of a giant roll of rice and wrapped in nori(seaweed).  Portions - a person can get a regular order of one of the menu items, a mini plate or a combo plate such as the Double chicken - their BBQ chicken and their chicken katsu, which is Panko breaded and deep fried.  Sides - each plate come with two scoops of rice - mini plates get one, shredded cabbage - see they have some sort of vegetable, and a scoop of mac salad.  While I'm not typically fond of mac salad of any kind their's changed my mind. Creamy but doesn't have an overly mayo taste and mixed with their secret ingredient - tuna. Only mac salad for me. Fries or an extra scoop of rice can be substituted for the mac salad. For the Atkins dieter(Is this still a thing?)/maximum meat person they do have a low carb plate - though it's not listed on the menu. It replaces the salad and rice with more meat and two eggs. Nice. While I wish they had a larger delivery area - no service to Old Town, I make the quick trip here once or twice a week for Hawaiian deliciousness.

2009-11-14,4.0,"So my husband and I were in the neighborhood as I started to reminisce about Hawaii.  How I wished that I could get a plate lunch somewhere in Chicago.  To my surprise, minutes after that conversation we walked past Aloha Eats.  Couldn't wait to try it!! I ordered the mini bbq chicken -it's not bbq like texas bbq, but it's more like teriyaki.  My husband ordered the Loco Moco (which he had ordered once while we were in Oahu).  I loved it!  The chicken was well-seasoned, perfectly marinated, not too salty or too sweet.  I actually don't normally order teriyaki anything because it's too sweet, but this was great!  The chicken was cooked to perfection.  They served two BIG pieces of succulent chicken with one scoop rice and one scoop mac salad.  The mac salad is just like it was in Hawaii.  I can understand why some might say it's bland, compared to American mac salad, but in Hawaii, this is how their mac salad tastes. Lots of mayo! Love it.  I was a little disappointed in a couple things.  Underneath the chicken was raw green cabbage. I'm a fan of cabbage but I wish that they would have done something to dress it a little.  Also I would have like a little more teriyaki sauce to put over my rice.  There was no sauce at all.  I will say that in Hawaii, there are more ""sides"" to choose from and we're not always forced to pick mac salad as a side but hey this is the closest to a plate lunch that I will find in Chicago so it's alright by me. The mini is the perfect size for me. My husband loves the Loco Moco. If you hadn't had it before it's two hamburger patties, two eggs (any way you like it), with brown gravy. They serve it in Hawaii at all the local diners and plate lunch places. I had a bite, and I'll honestly say that it was pretty tasty but I don't think that I could eat a whole one by myself. I peruse the menu while eating my plate lunch and saw that they also serve Saimin. Saimin is the Hawaiian version of something like ramen with maybe a fish cake, nori, and some veggies like bamboo shoots.  It was tasty in Hawaii so the next time I go I might try that.

Granted, take out never tastes as good as when it's served piping hot on some nice porcelain. Regardless, we ordered the Double Chicken (BBQ Chicken and Chicken Katsu), Pork Katsu and the Spam Musubi (comes with two pieces). I had to throw that last one in there just because I had read about it week earlier about how Spam is such the craze in Hawaii and Spam Musubi was the delicacy. When I opened the plastic container, I was shocked to see what seemed like two nigiri rolls on steroids - it was just a Spam slice on a bed of rice held together by seaweed. It was pretty lackluster but I imagine it's just really their version of a ham sandwich. That could also just be totally ignorant - maybe their ham sandwich is really a ham sandwich.The chicken and pork katsu were good as well but nothing like the experience I had at L&L's back when I visited Champaign to relive my coed days (tear).

I certainly missed Hawaii's plate lunches so I ordered a regular sized BBQ chicken and chicken katsu mixed plate.  I have been trying to watch my weight and, rather than consuming the hydrogenated fats found in macaroni salad, I opted for an extra scoop of rice.  It was ridiculously delicious.  There was an abundant portion of BBQ chicken and chicken katsu- easily equivalent to 2 L&L plate lunches. I simply couldn't imagine how I would finish it all.  A common problem that I find with chicken katsu plate lunches is that they often come with an inadequate portion of katsu sauce.  Aloha Eats did not have this issue as I had enough sauce for my chicken katsu and even an additional amount leftover for my rice. Since I was on a diet, I decided to only eat half of my delicious meal and to save the remainder as a treat for another future meal.  However, the BBQ chicken was so tasty that I couldn't resist eating my leftovers.  After such a delicious meal, I was completely full and decided to spend the rest of the evening enjoying the music with my eyes closed.  Aloha Eats is a superb restaurant.",0.9945,0.803,0.152,0.045,0.5822091029537838

The moco loco plate lunch is just as I remember it.  Gigantic, piping hot, drowning in gravy, with a delicious scoop of macaroni salad on the side.  No free cilantro soup, and it was a bit more expensive than L&L was, but those are minor complaints.  Anyone a fan of Hawaiian food, Filipino food, Chinese food, or delicious food can find something to love here.

Everything went according to plan, and then we parked (pay at the box parking, no private lot). It was a a very simply decorated cute little shop. I am so glad they didn't have that tacky Hawaiian decor. It smelled and looked clean. That was the go signal to order, Hawaiian BBQ mix plate and Curry Chicken Katsu. We waited shortly for our plates to be cooked to culinary perfection. a few short moments later, the food came out. I was confused as to why they are serving us in the to go boxes but I didn't care.  I open my box and its this GIANT portion of food. I think to myself, ""ohhhh, that's why they did that. Because they know it isn't humanly possible to finish all this food by myself"". My Hawaiian BBQ mix plate consisted of 2 scoops of white rice, teriyaki chicken, BBQ short ribs, beef steak, a side of cabbage, and some macaroni salad. The thing that stood out the most was the cabbage and mac salad! GREAT COMBO! I meat was perfectly cook and it wasn't overly seasoned and I love simplicity. The Curry Chicken Katsu was just as large and delicious as the Hawaiian BBQ mix plate. The prices are also what got me. My plate was like 9 bucks and his was 8.50. Around $20 to feed a small army?? Why not? I warn you now...the plate can feed 2 comfortably and still leave them full.

So, here I am. The best thing about Aloha Eats is definitely its singularity. The reason we call it ""the Hawaiian place"" is because it's the only one we know about.   My husband loves the spam musubi.  Since I don't like spam or seaweed, it's a non-starter for me.  I am, however, a big fan of the BBQ plates - both chicken and beef.  I usually get  mini plate, and I just discovered last night that you can sub in peas and carrots for mac salad (or rice) if you are looking for more vegetables than just the cabbage that comes with every plate.  I don't really care for the macaroni salad - it's a little bland for me - but other people seem to like it.   The BBQ isn't really your standard contiguous 48 barbecue, it's more like teriyaki-style grilled meat.  The chicken is always moist and delicious.  If you are a chopstick person, make sure to grab a knife because they serve the meat in kind of big pieces that make it a little unwieldy for chopsticks. The regular BBQ plates are enormous - two scoops of white rice, a scoop of macaroni salad, cabbage and a heaping helping of whatever meat you choose, which is why I stick with the mini-plate. If you're in the mood for something different, you should check it out.  Seating is limited, but it's great for takeout.  Gotta love the Hawaiian soda, too.",0.9658,0.829,0.114,0.057,0.4916778591778591

Another thing missing was Poi.  We know it's an acquired taste, but this should be on the menu.

First off, the food is so delicious and ""authentic"" as one would call it.  I usually got the mini chicken katsu with all rice (no mac salad because I didn't like it even when I lived in Hawai'i) and a side of curry.  One of my friends was not a big fan of their curry, but I surely was.  Their bbq chicken is done well and definitely has a lot of flavor.  The bbq beef though is a standout.  Usually bbq beef can be tough or too thick, but Aloha Grill's (as it was known then) beef is perfectly sliced and seasoned.  I am also told the tofu katsu is excellent - and it even inspired me to try my hand at a baked tofu katsu recipe!  The spam musubis are good as well.   Portions are extremely generous.  I was often very very full off of the mini plate.  The combo plate can definitely be split.  The musubi come in twos, btw.   The service is always the best.  I always feel welcomed.  The best part though was even in a city with millions of people, I felt like I was back in the islands again.  I was always warmly greeted and had wonderful chats with Ivan when he was working.  I would get the low-down on anything going on with the growing Hawaiian and Hawai'i communities in Chicagoland too.  And when there were other people from Hawai'i dining we would often instantly strike up conversation over our common bond of the islands. I can't rave enough about the restaurant.  The owners and workers are amazing.  The food is amazing.  The whole place just makes me smile thinking about it again.  Who knew such a little place could cure my homesickness with such great food and company!",0.9982,0.711,0.245,0.044,0.5645202991452991

I went with my girlfriend and we got the short ribs and bbq chicken respectively, ate without pleasure, and then quickly descended into the seventh level of bowel-quivering hell.  We'd had a nice little afternoon planned: grab lunch, then take a quick stroll around the pond to kill time before catching a movie up the street.  We got about half way around the pond before the two of us were pale, twitchy and hunched over in pain. Brave souls that we are, we tried to make it up to the movie anyway, but I only made it as far as the afore mentioned bathroom. (Thanks again, Borders) The chicken was a mysterious grayish pink color, and totally flavorless but for the sauce. My ""short ribs"" were nothing more than a half pound of fat, accented with gristle and chunks of bone. Nummers! I tried to salvage it by slicing tiny ribbons of meat from the fat with the plastic knife they supplied. I managed a few bites, then wished I hadn't.

I did however, want to just drop the utensils and eat the breaded strips of chicken with my hands, but after surveying the room and seeing that no one else pulled crap like that, I decided not to endulge my dirty Texas boy ways.  The food was excellent and the sauce that comes with it is great too, still I added some extra cock sauce (siracha) for some extra zest.  It came with one scoop of rice and a nice little side of macaroni salad (very tasty).  The macaroni salad was a nice follow up after using the spicy Siracha on my chicken.

Huge portions, greasy but oh so tasty BBQed meats.  Almost always go with the BBQ mix plate or double chicken because the Chicken Katsu is fantastic as well.  Short ribs and beef are somewhat similar to Kalbi and Bulgogi.  Kaluha pork plate is definately healthier but not as tasty.  The Loco Moco Plate will certainly kill you... and thus tastes pretty dang good.  Macaroni salad is perfect! The spam Musubi is big and Fat as it should be...  Ohhh and try the curry sauce or brown gravy with fries, sounds gross....and it kinda is, but strangely addictive.. The fried Mahi and Shrimp plates sometimes have a funky taste that can only be drowned in a shower of lemon and tartar sauce, but good if your palate is suffering from the constant barrage of greasy meats.

Funny, since they serve the gravy on the side and I figured if it was bad I'd just skip it. How do you mess up chicken?

But it turned out to be a regular take-out joint, which was completely fine by me. The food was very, VERY greasy, but I guess that's what one should expect from deep-friend foods and rib-tips of which 75% of the meat is fat. This is not to say it wasn't good... I liked my ribs very much. The chicken katsu my friend ordered wasn't bad, though I didn't think it was phenomenal. My friend noted that the sauce that came with it tasted like McDonald's sweet-n-sour sauce, but I can't support that since I've never tried the latter. We got the mini-plates and still had food left for the next day, though I felt nauseated all of that next day and didn't eat it. My main attraction to this place was that it was cheap, and like I said, the ribs I got were pretty good and would recommend them to anyone who doesn't mind a little (or a lot of) grease. Would I go back? Yeah, if I'm around the area. I would like to try some of the seafood stuff next time, though I will stay away from the deep-fried menu.",0.9897,0.808,0.16,0.032,0.4738186813186812
2007-05-21,3.0,"Since I am going to Hawaii in a week (hahaha, yeah suckas!!) I decided I'd take a dip into Aloha Grill to check out some Hawaiian delicacy. What I found was alot of white rice.....alot. White rice was everywhere and in everything we ordered. We ordered the musubi's on recommendation from someone who reviewed Aloha on Yelp, and they weren't too good. I didn't think Spam really meant SPAM, but it did. I have never eaten Spam before, but apparently they like it in Hawaii b/c it was on Aloha's menu more than once. The BBQ chicken musubi was okay, but the Spam I am not sure I liked as much. And of course, there was the abundance of white rice underneath. The small plates I think is where it's at. BBQ Beef and Katsu Chicken were both very tasty. The meat is dark on the chicken, but its breaded so you can't really tell. But the darkness is what gave it that extra tenderness. The beef looked like Italian Beef but had a very sweet flavor to it. I'm not all about sweet meat, as I like it straight up, but this was delectable to me.  Both dishes were served with macaroni salad (yummy) and a huge scoop of WHITE RICE!!!) GEEZ, okay on the rice. I like rice and all, but there was too much of it. Could they give you something else with it? Or maybe just nothing else with it so I don't feel as bad about not eating it all.",0.9922,0.763,0.196,0.042,0.4431226053639847

Aloha ""Grill"" didn't bring out the Hawaiian yerning I thought it would. Popped in on a Sunday evening. The two of us ordered 2 mini plates (Chicken Katsu and BBQ Beef). The Katsu was pretty good. Cripsy fried, yet tender, chicken strips battered in what appeared to be coconut. Yummy. It came with enough white rice and mac salad to keep the belly churning for a few hours. I loved the mac salad, that was the only thing I could finish.  The BBQ Beef was ok. The marinade used was sweet. The beef tender, parts were a little to stringy for me to enjoy (fatty pieces scare me!)  Thinking the mini-plates wouldn't be enough for the two of us, we ordered both the BBQ chicken and Spam musubi's. You get 2 musubi's per order. It's kinda like a huge sushi brick of rice topped with the meat/non-meat of your choice (spam, chicken or tofu) and rapped in seaweed. The spam was suprisingly ok. Fried, so it almost took on the flavor of real meat!   All in all, it was decent.
