2017-08-28,3.0,"First visit in six years. We returned because they claimed that the room and the concept were completely revamped. Turns out...not so much.    The (very nice) room is almost exactly the same and so is the menu. The most obvious change is that they used to be jacket required, but that's not really a thing in 2017. Apparently they went 180 degrees on that and now have zero dress code, as evidenced by the fellow at the next table over who was wearing shorts, a t-shirt, and a baseball cap.    Other changes: the prices are higher, the portions are smaller, the service is WAY slower, and the menu descriptions are incomplete. The food is quite tasty, but not really worth the money. For example, my $26 plate of risotto contained about 26 grains of rice, and my $45 fish course was 3 small nuggets totaling about 5 oz. You're essentially paying for the location and the view, which is fine as a splurge...maybe once every six years.",-0.0321,0.972,0.013,0.014,0.362962962962963
2017-08-26,5.0,"Spiaggia presents traditional Italian cuisine with the highest quality ingredients, prepared spectacularly. Stepping into the oversized dining room, one cannot help but notice the fabulous view of Lake Michigan and Michigan Avenue - providing the most beautiful backdrop for some of the most beautiful Italian dishes in the city.  Suited wait staff quickly deliver your drink menus and shortly thereafter present you with a generous piece of fresh bread and the best (and most unique) tasting whipped ricotta cheese spread accompanying it (lemon zest, salt, and cracked black pepper sprinkled on top, and a honey infused olive oil swims underneath).   After placing your order(s), you anxiously wait to begin your unforgettable dining experience. Now sipping on the award winning wine that your primary waiter recommended whilst nibbling on the delicious bread combo, is when one notices the detailed and ornate grandeur of the dining room itself: enormous and elaborate marble columns throughout, one-of-a-kind, high quality glass/dinner/silverware, and real, fresh flowers adorning each table.  The excitement intensifies as one of the kitchen staff eagerly presents your first dish and recites the breakdown of ingredients: CAPESANTE: scallop, kohlrabi, green tomato, dill, and pork brodo. Easily the best piece of scallop you've had in however long you can recall. A crispy outer, with the softest, pillowy inner. You are indelibly shaken at how amazing the ingredients have combined. The euphoria doesn't last long, as the portion size weens on the smaller side. The next dish arrives and it is the most stunning, handmade tortellini shells, topped with fresh burrata and parmesan shavings. The texture is perfectly al dente, and with each first bite of each shell, the juice infused inside of the shells bursts into your mouth - forcing you to be silent as you sit astonished by the taste. Again, just wishing you could have a bit more. More of the delicious bread and ricotta is served in preparation of the final dish. The final selection: RISOTTO, with pampanella pork belly, pepper, and caciocavallo. The magic of the dish floors you, as the bite from the rice is balanced by the smooth texture of the broth. Tastewise, the sweet (somewhat fiery) pork belly is the perfect juxtaposition to the creamy risotto. The perfect marriage.  1.5 hours later, stuffed, impressed, and slightly buzzed, you descend back to reality and exit Spiaggia a couple hundred dollars poorer, however culturally richer.",0.9992,0.713,0.27,0.018,0.5820555555555555

We split the tuna appetizer and tortellini and then had the halibut and lamb for entrées. They serve you amazing bread with ricotta, olive oil, lemon zest and honey for dipping. It was so good! For dessert we had the tiramisu and dark chocolate gelato. The tiramisu was a new deconstructed presentation and while it was good, I don't think it was $17 good. The gelato was amazing though.

Cioccolato 13$ if u love sweet and salty youll love this the mouse was nice and soft and chocolate wish there was some heat in it to give it pop but still good loved the pretzel icecream it really added texture n cut through the sweetness the best part of this was the potato chips wish there was more,0.9995,0.639,0.306,0.055,0.5830738705738705

Service was great, very attentive to details, they all knew it was our anniversary, and even gave us a pair of after-dinner drinks, etc. But I have to say that their food was bland, there were no impactful flavors. I've been to many Italian restaurants in Chicago and this had, by far, the worst food. Go to any neighborhood Italian restaurant in the city and you'll experience more and better flavors.  The menu options are limited. My husband ordered the 5-course dinner and at the end he had to take some from what I'd ordered as he was still hungry.  I ordered the antipasto, primi, and secondi combination - which was more than enough. Thankfully, my husband had my secondi (the roasted duck). But still there was a lack of flavor in all these dishes...  A last thing, dessert... It seemed to me that they only had one dessert option. When it was time for dessert the server brought my husband the dessert that is part of the 5-course dinner (the chocolate cake), and (without asking what I wanted) brought a second chocolate cake for me. If I was given the chance I'd probably order a panna cotta or else.. I don't think I'll be back.

2017-02-19,3.0,"My friend and I stopped by Spiaggia for dinner to try their 5-course menu. Before the actual courses were served, we also received 2 complimentary appetizers from the chef--a butternut squash hors d'oeuvre and a soup served in a tiny mug. The squash in the hors d'oeuvre was excellent and had a nice, light taste. The soup was rather interesting, however. It was a celery-based vegetable soup that had a nice, savory taste. Strangely, it was topped with an apple-nutmeg whipped cream (?) that I thought did not go very well with the savory soup. Another thing to note about Spiaggia is that they have bread service, which I actually thought was one of the highlights of the night. The bread was served with a tasty olive oil/whipped ricotta spread that had a light, sweet taste. The first course was a salad with a duck liver pate. The salad had a sweet dressing, but beware--a large chunk of pate is hidden underneath the leaves. I was not a fan of the pate since it had an extremely rich and salty flavor that was overwhelming. This course was followed by Spiaggia's signature gnocchi. Unfortunately, I am not a fan of gnocchi since I always find the texture to be much too mushy--Spiagggia's take did not change my mind. The next course (the Cioppino) was the best in my opinion. The fish was nicely cooked and the saffron sauce was wonderfully fragrant. The last dish was the Cotechino, which was essentially a large pork sausage. The sausage was a tad salty, but I did enjoy the nicely boiled vegetables that were placed on top. Finally, the opera cake dessert was extremely rich--don't be fooled by the tiny sliver that is served. It was decent but nothing mind-blowing ""Decent but nothing mind-blowing"" pretty much sums up the experience I had at Spiaggia. I am glad that my friend and I opted for the 5-course tasting menu rather than spending $60 more for the 8-course. I would only recommend Spiaggia if you run out of restaurants to try in the Chicago area; otherwise, you can find much better tasting menus elsewhere.",0.9944,0.789,0.17,0.042,0.6030197444831591
2017-02-14,3.0,"Visited Spiaggia for dinner to celebrate my wife's birthday. First, 10 stars for the impeccable service from our server Ernesto. From the minute we sat at our table Ernesto and the rest of the Spiaggia staff treated us as if we were Jay Z and Beyonce (before the twin babies). As is a custom when celebrating special occasions, a few minutes after being seated Ernesto walked over with a sealed card from the restaurant wishing her a happy birthday again. Additionally on numerous occasions he and the staff wished her a happy birthday as were got situated in our seats. :) I asked to be seated with a view but there really isn't a view from the main dining area. The windows look out on a corner of Michigan Avenue and an apartment building where in the evening you can see what people are watching on their television. In short don't worry about requesting a table with a view.  We ordered from the a la carte menu and selected the following items. The pork shank and the duck were flavorful, the wife liked the bucatini but I didn't like the texture of the noodle. We were both extremely disappointed with the gnocci as it was described as one of the highlights on the menu. I don't know how to describe it other than it didn't taste like any other gnocci I have had at restaurants (perhaps that was the goal). The flavor was lacking and the truffles didn't add anything special to the dish. Not worth the $60 in my opinion.  Gnocci w/ Truffles ($60) Ala Bucatini - pasta with crab, squid ink, tarragon ($32) Ala Maiale - pork shank ($47)  Ala Anatra - duck ($46). If you've been dying to try this Michelin star restaurant.

We were hosted by a dear friend who wanted to treat us, and the reservation was in his name.  Trouble started from the get-go, because although my wife arrived before the two of us and registered her name with the attendant upon entering, we were not informed of her presence when we checked in and spent 15 anguished minutes trying to locate her before thinking that she just might be inside, where she was, drinking a glass of water at the bar. When we were seated (about 5 minutes later, we were placed in a specious but extremely uncomfortable booth that had not been set with any utensils or napkins.  The server appeared shortly thereafter with a wine/cocktail list and chattered a bit almost unintelligibly about the wines and cocktails (noise level prevented really good listening) and then disappeared for several minutes.  Still no table settings. After I called someone to serve us we ordered wine and when it was poured we sat for about 25 minutes with no other items, no food menu (yet) and still no utensils or napkins.  Finally, after 50 minutes at the table we were brought some bread, and I asked for menus so we could order food.  Once again, the chattering waitress going on and on about the items and another wait. FINALLY we ordered--two dishes for me, three for our host, and one for my wife. First courses arrived for me and the host; then a second plate--the fabled gnocchi, which in my judgment are easily topped by a good restaurant in Liguria (well, Spaggia is supposed to be Italian).  Small dumplings (unmarked by the typical fork patterns) were served in an undistinguished white sauce loaded with truffle on top. Texture just like you'd expect--a bit pasty--not much flavor overall and certainly expensive at $60.  After another 45 minutes (we're now at nearly two hours) I called for the manager to insist that they bring something for my wife, who gets pretty hungry if she hasn't eaten anything by 9:15 or so.  So--finally our main dishes (2) ""Cioppino"" and (1) Lamb Shank.  I put quote marks around the Cioppino, because it's laughable.  A couple of pieces of fish over which the server(s) ceremoniously add a couple tablespoons of an extensively described (by the server) broth. It's okay, but nothing to rave about. Our host's lamb shank was good, he said.  We did not order desert and left after over 2.5 hours of wondering how on earth this place ever made it onto the Michelin list.",0.9363,0.866,0.082,0.052,0.4578282828282828

We both had the tasting menu and overall the food was good, but unfortunately a majority of the dishes were over salted for my taste.  Hubby had the wine pairings were I had a sip of and those were delicious.  The staff were great and funny, particularly when we were treated to a gratuitous sex show of about 15 minutes midway through our dinner from a pair of guys in the room at the Drake across the street.  According to our server, this isn't the first time that's happened.  To add to the eventful night, there was a traffic accident on Michigan so you can see the police sirens glowing and one of the guys from across the street basically plastered his naked body against the window to get a better view of the accident, exposing all of us at Spiaggia.  It's a shame neither one of them were in shape or attractive at least!  The staff did the best they can with the situation and we did enjoy watching the other diners' reactions as they realized what was going on across the street.  Too bad they can't put up curtains at the restaurant since that would totally ruin what would otherwise be a wonderful view of the otherwise Magnificent Mile.",0.9823,0.775,0.143,0.081,0.55990990990991

2016-05-31,3.0,"Decent restaurant for upscale Italian fare. I wasn't exactly blown away by my dinner here, but still enjoyed my experience overall.  The meal starts with bread service, which is fairly unique - the bread is served warm and comes in a small paper bag, along with two olive oils and salt to sample. I ordered the prosciutto primavera, which was a decent appetizer, although the creaminess of the ricotta was a bit overwhelming. I would have liked to see more emphasis on the prosciutto as a standout ingredient.  The risotto alla carbonara was decadent and creamy, and an interesting take on the regular spaghetti alla carbonara. However, I thought the dish was over-salted, especially since the guanciale and Parmigiano are fairly salty by themselves.  The salmon I ordered for the secondi was my favorite dish - the salmon was cooked perfectly with a crispy skin, and the red cabbage paired wonderfully with the fish.  Finally, although the menu makes no mention of this, the tiramisu I got for dessert is a deconstructed version, which was a letdown. The cake portion was dry, and the dish lacked the signature coffee flavor of a traditional tiramisu due to the weaker espresso foam.  Service, while not inattentive, was not quite as polished as one might expect, and a bit impersonal. We would have liked our server to engage with us more throughout the evening, for example by being present at the table to explain the ingredients and preparations of each dish as they are placed in front of the diner. Slight quibbles, such as hurried placement of new utensils and inconsistent pacing of the meal, were non-issues but vaguely disappointing given the Michelin star rating.  The restaurant is tucked away on the second floor of an office building, but upon entering you are greeted by a grand wine display that opens up into a sleek, airy dining space. Although there's not too much in terms of views, the expansive windows and high ceilings make for an enjoyable dining experience overall.

Favorite - lobster of course. I got the gnocchi next (black truffle, ricotta, Parmigiano Reggiano). Delicious! I definitely knew that this dish was my favorite. I loved every bite of it.

The decor is appealing, the service is stellar, especially at the bar where the barmaid made us feel most welcome and went out of her way to locate a particular spirit I was after. Here is the meal we had........ We started with the Prosciutto Primavera which we were told consisted mainly of ""European field greens"". To see what it tasted like, go mow your lawn and when you're finished, take the bag of freshly mowed grass and stick your head in it and inhale through your mouth. Then, take some whipped cream mixed with lemon juice, put some in your mouth, then stuff two thin slices of prusciuto in your mouth. Chew. Swallow. Boom, DONE! That was the salad. Next up was the Gnocchi. Now, I've never had it until this past Friday but, the texture was far nicer than any pasta I've had before. Unfortunately the sauce that they poured over top looked like pureed dog pooh and smelled about the same, with some very strong garlic mixed in with it. Finally, the Manzo, which was supposed to be 45 day dry-aged ribeye. It was tasty, this part I can not deny...............there just wasn't enough of it! Literally, our serving size of meat was the size of a silver dollar, maybe even a 50 cent piece, but we were only served two each.  I didn't come close to finishing my salad, only ate two ""pieces"" of gnocchi, and ate the two small pieces of beef. Nothing was deducted from my bill at all nor was it insinuated that this would happen, despite the staff seeing that they had taken a near full salad plate back as well as a full bowl of the pasta. Clearly they had to see that their food was not appealing to me. The above ""meal"" combined with 4 drinks totaled $401 including $20 tip. Yes, I know I should tip more for good service but after being screwed out of $300+ for food that was FAR from worth it, I was furious BUT, it was my anniversary night and I was not about to ruin my evening further by embarrassing my wife by verbally shredding the management.

Front door staff look like they are on the typical Gold Coast rejected model curve. Disinterested, dull, not much firing upstairs.  Sommelier who came by, a young, slim male, was about as arrogant as I've seen in awhile. I Wanted to go something away from the Barolo, Barbaresco, Brunello trail I enjoy, and go somewhere different. He just wanted to upsell. He wasn't even trying to recommend. He just wanted me to spend. List is missing that extra special variety it used to have in the old incarnation and even the new version that first opened again more recently.  Too many other great places to go close by, and around the city. Food isn't very good anymore and it's obviously just relying on past reputation to hope it keeps afloat.  Don't go here. Go somewhere else they aren't ripping you off for mediocre food, rude staff, and poor effort.",-0.7496,0.769,0.1,0.131,0.4275517934446505

Things I appreciated: - We had to be out by a certain time and they were so considerate, well planned and self aware of the course to make sure we had enough time to enjoy each without waiting too long to hurry at the end - Service was good though we wish our server had requested the help of a sommelier sooner, he finally did and we got our wine right - The ambiance is quite relaxing by how quiet and beautiful the space is Things we wished more of:  - The food was extremely creative, almost seems to be a requirement for a Michelin star now. But the vegetarian courses were just mushrooms or root veggies all the way. Even my fiance, who had the regular courses, enjoyed some (duck pate and foie gras) but skipped others.

2016-01-12,5.0,"I had been wanting to eat here for many years and it certainly did not disappoint. We decided to go with the Quattorodici tasting menu, and it was certainly a good decision. There was also a white truffle menu, however, many dishes featured truffle flavor so I'm not sure if this option is worth it. Anyway, on to the food. Of the 14 dishes we had, there were definitely some outstanding ones that I will remember forever: -Focaccia with foie gras. This was one of the best foie gras mousses/pates I've ever had. The foie flavor was exquisite and the texture just so rich, dense, and melty. Perfect with the apple gelee over the top and some delicious bread. Also, very generous portion of foie gras. -Chestnut, truffle, cider. A soup, if you will. Whatever this was, it was one of the best things I've ever eaten. Served in a tiny mug, it was incredibly rich and had a delicious chestnut and white truffle flavor. Outstanding. -Caviar with oyster and potato. This dish was served in a glass with a creamed cod foam and my goodness, it was fantastic. The combination of the rich foam, briny oyster, creamy potato, and fishy caviar made that bite one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth. It makes my top 5 best dishes for sure. -Scallop with lemon, chilis, and squid ink. This was the sweetest scallop I've ever eaten! Delicious. -Halibut with beet, onion, and roe. Beautifully cooked halibut and the pickled beets on the side were perfection. -Sofia. A fig, honeycomb, goat cheese, and tomato jam sandwich on brioche, this was absolutely lovely and a great bridge to dessert. What a great way to represent a cheese course! The honeycomb in that sandwich was incredible. Perfect crumbly crunch, nothing like I've ever eaten before. Wow that got me. -Chocolate with rice, truffle, and honey. This was a beautiful dessert with chocolate mousse, freshly shaved white truffles, and puffed rice. I'm a chocolate nut and loved the combination of chocolate and truffle, plus the texture from the rice made this a well-done dessert for me. I will say, not all the dishes were as memorable as the ones I listed, but they were all delicious in one way or another. We did have to request salt for the risotto course, but otherwise, no glaring issues. The service was outstanding and the staff in general extremely kind, which is why this was such an enjoyable dinner for me. I have a food account on Instagram and while posting some pictures from my meal, I got a follow from the restaurant and from Chef Tony himself, as well as personal messages from both thanking me for taking the time to share my experience at Spiaggia.

2016-01-03,4.0,"This is as near to ""fine dining"" Italian that we have in Chicago and it doesn't disappoint.  The room is beautiful.  Great views, open kitchen.  Only problem with the table is that it's dark - difficult to take good pictures of the food (!)  The beverage program is great.  There are a number of specialty cocktails as well as a number of different Negroni's.  Very nice indeed!  As befitting a place of this caliber, the wine program is great as well.  Plenty of WBTG choices as well as a large bottle list, many of which are attractively displayed in the foyer of the restaurant. There is an ala carte menu but I think most people choose one of the chef's degustation menus.  On our visit there were 3 different menus - a white truffle dinner, a ""Sette"" 7 course dinner, and a ""Quattordici"" 14 course dinner.  We were feeling celebratory and so we went with the Quattordici - sounds much better than ""14!"" Our 14 dishes were served in 9 courses.  There were many highlights.  The best bites:   --  Foie gras mousse, apple gelee, pistachio butter, toasted focaccia.  WOW!   --  Chestnut soup, white truffles and apple cider.   --  Caviar, fresh oyster, potato and creamed cod.   --  Scallop crudo with Meyer lemon, chilis, and squid ink tuile.  BEST scallop ever!   --  Alaskan halibut, white beet mouse, pickled red beets, salmon roe.  OMG!   --  Sofia (goat cheese) grilled cheese ""sandwich"" with fig, honeycomb and tomato. Interestingly, some of the Italian standards were our least favorite dishes.  Casoncelli (a kind of ravioli) filled with squash in a bone marrow sauce was notable only for the sauce being divine - the pasta was essentially tasteless.  Spaghetti cacio e pepe (cheese and pepper) was also strangely bland - even after adding a bit of salt it still needed something - maybe more cheese?  The risotto, while expertly al dente, also needed a bit of salt. Our 14 dishes included 3 desserts.  There were some gelatos served in mini ice cream cones.  Cute.  The chocolate and pine nut mousse was interesting.  A chocolate and white truffle mousse-like dessert was also a delicious combination. Overall the food was excellent, some of it quite memorable.  My last note to the kitchen is this: I have teeth, good teeth!  Please add some textural elements to the food - there's a lot of soft stuff here but I do enjoy chewing and crunching on my food too!  I also had the wine pairings.  I have to say that the wines were really, really good.  To me, a successful flight of wines must push me out of my comfort zone at least a little bit, be tasty, and complement the food.  Here, the wine pairings succeeded in all three areas!  I must give kudos to the sommelier for the selections - I enjoyed the wines as much if not more than the food. My rating came up short of 5 stars.  A solid 4 stars to be sure.  The awesome wine pairings nearly put it over the top but a few letdowns on the pasta and general textural blandness kept it from reaching the pinnacle.",0.999,0.757,0.226,0.017,0.5592158256337361

I had the 16 dish pre fixxe... 14 of the 16 dishes were a major miss. Most were unmemorable ... or memorable for the wrong reasons -- too cheesy, too many conflicting flavors, too much truffle oil (wayyyy too much truffle oil)... or missing the WOW factor.  And the duck, not even close to being the quality they should provide -- too tough and gamey. (And I love duck).  I do not have anything nice to say about the wine. Again, unmemorable, unexceptionable and missing the impressive selection a Michelin should have.   Service however was exceptional.  Net net, Spiaggia seems to be going through an identity crisis -- conflicted between their Michelin star and their actual ability to live up to that star. They've been around for 30 years and it's pretty evident they need to reinvent ... and that doesn't mean switching up the menu once in a while.

2015-10-22,3.0,"To begin with, the food was delicious. We had the Sette tasting menu, which was 7 courses. I won't describe each one, because the menu changes. But in short, we had a chestnut soup first course; a diver scallop second course; cacio d' pepe pasta course, halibut for the fish course, duck for the meat course, and dessert.  The cacio d' pepe was probably one of the most delicious morsels I've ever enjoyed. Truly perfect. The pasta was perfectly cooked, the pepper was bright and spicy. It was divine.  The diver scallops were also perfect--said my wife, as I didn't have them. I have a sensitivity to fish when I'm drinking red wine, and we were drinking a robust and delicious barolo. They accommodated my request for an alternative to fish with two beautifully prepared vegetarian dishes: one of roasted wood mushrooms with pine nuts and a ricotta puree; and the second was a grilled white radish. Both were delicious and I didn't feel that I was lacking anything by not having the protein.  And then there was the service. And here is where if all falls apart, and why I'm giving this three stars and not more.  I'll begin with the bartender. I sat at the bar and ordered a glass of cabernet as I had arrived a little early and waited for my wife. He corrected me--only Italian grapes here. My bad, I should have known, perhaps given that this is an Italian restaurant. But then, he couldn't bother to smile at me or say hello, but had lots of smiles and was much warmer to the party of two men and one woman who came in after me, as well as to the man/woman couple who came in soon after and sat on the other side of me.  But... I didn't sit there long before my wife arrived and we went to the dining room. We were seated at a beautiful table by the window. The room is lovely. Classy, chic, and modern. A server came over to our table and my wife ordered a glass of wine--I already had mine. He asked about food allergies--I told him my fish /red wine thing. He didn't explain the menu. We didn't know if we had the option of ordering ala carte, which I thought was a possibility, but only the tasting menu was offered to us. He was polite I guess, but brusque.  And then.... our first course came before my wife got her glass of wine. She had to ask another server for it.  And then, while each course was explained well--there are so many people who come to the table to deliver food, pick up dishes, refill water, the pace is a little dizzying--they came out fast and the plates were picked up the second we put our final fork down. And then the next course came out a minute later. And when we were finished the check was put on our table, and he came by in another two minutes to pick it up. We were still finishing our wine!  The message is.. eat and finish and leave! Even though this was a Tuesday night and there were empty tables around us.  A lot of money spent to feel so rushed by the serving staff. It left us feeling off about the whole experience, instead of leaving with a warm happy feeling, which is what you want after you spend that much money and generally enjoy the food.  So... don't think we'll be running back to the Spiaggia. But, I do think we'll try the Spiaggia Cafe, which seems to have a more relaxed vibe.",0.997,0.855,0.131,0.014,0.47294444444444445

2015-09-16,3.0,"I was here to celebrate our anniversary with my wife, and had the 14-course tasting menu. If I can break down serve and the food, it would have been 5 stars for the service and 2 stars for the food. Overall, the service was excellent, and most dishes were well-prepared; however, as a course menu, I did not see the ""flow"" of dishes. Instead, I felt like that I was having individual ""tapas."" This was probably due to my high standard or maybe it was due to the fact that this establishment only recently switched to a completely tasting menu system. While the experience was still pleasant, I really expected a lot more from this restaurant. The major flaw that I saw was probably the order of dishes served. I really think that they should rearrange the dishes. Review of individual dishes can be seen below.  Artichoke soup, focaccia, and foie gras terrine Not sure whether i should call it terrine, but it was a foie gras mousse. The focaccia was well toasted with oliver oil. The taste was fine; however, I really think that this dish was a bit too greasy or oily as the very first course.  Caviar course Eric Ripert always said that you should be generous with caviar; however, clearly this was not the case here. The dish has a refreshing and tangy taste, and highlighted by the saltiness of the caviar. I really think this should have been the first dish of the starters.  Bass, fennel, and fish roe This was probably my favorite dish of the night. I really like the chewiness of the bass. The grass ash also gave a unique flavor to the fish. Well balanced. Again, I think this should have been before the focaccia course.  Squash blossom Well done deep fried dish. It really brought out the sweetness of the squash. Beef and Truffle It's a mistake to have this dish following the deep fried squash. Perhaps it was the squash blossom, perhaps it was my fall allergy, or perhaps it was low-quality truffle, I really did not think the piles of shaved truffle in this dish had much taste to it.  Tomato and pecorino tortello Beautiful dish, but lacking a punch line. Sweetbreads bucatini This dish was a bit too salty for me, but overall the flavor was bold. Again, while the paste tasted great, I hardly tasted the truffle for whatever reasons.  Corn and Risotto The risotto was well prepared to the right texture; however, for some unknown reason, we waited for a very long time between this dish and the previous one. I can taste the sweet corn, but this dish is lacking a kick, and was not very memorable.  Octopus The octopus was not chewy but somehow I thought it was a bit mushy, Polenta, bison Two dishes were served together. The bison was well-cooked and not very gamy. The mushrooms was very flavorful in contrast to the taste-lacking truffle.  Orange/vanilla ice cream with espresso I am a big fan of dessert, but this was bit disappointing. The espresso overpowered the ice cream. I really had to sip off most of the espresso then I could taste the ice cream. ""Sweet corn frutti de bosco"" Again, this was a bit disappointing. The whole dish was way too sweet, so sweet that the delicate sweet corn taste was totally masked. The olive oil cake was very hard, and I am not sure whether it's meant to be that way. It looked nice, but tasted.. Truffle (chocolates) There were three different flavors, earl grey, banana, and plain truffle, from very sweet to not sweet. In my opinion, we should start with the very sweet earl grey, then move to the banana, then plain truffle since the previous dish was very sweet. Unfortunately, my wife reversed the order, so she complained that the truffle was too bitter, and when she got to the earl grey, it was too sweet.  Overall, I really can see improvement in many aspects of this restaurant.",0.9982,0.804,0.162,0.034,0.4938963546493666

Was I here for dinner or meeting my financial adviser? --Because surely this was not where my restaurant was located? After making my way up the escalator, I did find Spiaggia and as I entered the room, I took in the modern and very sexy space. It was every bit as sleek as you'd expect from a Chicago restaurant with so many dollar signs attached to its name. Gorgeous fabrics, rich dark woods, and chandeliers that force you to take notice. This is a place to impress. Or at the very least, sit in a dim booth, slip your shoe off and run your toes up your dinner companion's leg while he peruses the menu. Don't blame me; the lighting and views just beckon it. The menu changes every season so I will not give a listing of all of our tastings. It was all good, but only one thing stood out for me. My mouth still waters at just thinking about the chestnut and foie gras soup. That might have been the most spectacular soup I have ever eaten. While everyone demands you order the truffle gnocchi, I will say that I liked the first few bites, but was ready for something else well before I finished. Very rich and a little on the salty side.  Although the desserts are quite tiny, the Mezzo (10 piece sampling) was way too much after the many courses. A beautiful display and most samplings were definite standouts, but I would have been happier with far fewer tastings. Next time, I will order the Piccolo (6 piece).

The zucchini flower was crisp and nicely battered however it was missing some flavor, the flower itself is not very strong in taste but overall good choice, the fish appetizer was very interesting, a little red caviar a little cream Fraiche nice combo great presentation, gnocchi appetizer was good and bad. Gnocchi themselves were fantastic however the sauce totally overpowered them! It was too salty and the gnocchi swam in the thickness of it, the sauce really became the main meal, the balance was off. The lamb which was a main was ok, however to me once again overly salty. It was good but nothing extremely fantastic as I would expect from a restaurant of this caliber.

Then my daughter had a side of the simplest pasta that no one can mess up and it was so salty that she couldn't even eat that.I had told the waiter I wanted to pair wine with my meal and never came back to ask but only after he set down my main course which was already too late. We left without having dessert which for us has never happened. I guess we were just spoiled eating in 2 and 3 start michelin restaurants in Hong Kong but then again when you can't chew ANY bite of your meat and a side dish of pasta is too salty to eat then we were definately in a wrong place to dine.

We absolutely loved our view, and our bus boy as well as one of our waiters kindly took a picture of us.  If you love wine, then this your place for quality wine. They have a wine director and two sommeliers listed on the wine list. If you know your wines, you will be pleased to pick a selection from many regions listed around Italy and some other countries. My husband and I shared a rye pasta dish and the lamb. BEST LAMB i have ever had. All though I have never ordered lamb from an Italian Restaurant, the way it was braised was so beautiful. It was the most tender, most delicious lamb I have ever had. It was so enjoyable to know that it wasn't seasoned too much or too little, but just the way it should be. The pesto sauce had outstanding flavors and you can taste the pine nuts.  Please don't leave without trying dessert. At a price of 6 dollars, you can try every little thing. Take a look at my pictures to know what I'm talking about.  Spiaggia is in a great location!

I came here last night for my girlfriend's birthday and had an incredibly special time.

The food is incredible and the service was out of this world good. They had a menu prepared for my girlfriend that wished her a happy birthday on it that she was able to take with her - what a great idea. My girlfriend and I each had a cocktail to start - I had an old fashioned and she had a strawberry fizz both of which were excellent. We each had an antipasti and a second plate which was the right amount of food for us - we wanted to leave room for dessert. The gnocchi was the best I've ever had - it tasted like something not made on earth. Our waitstaff was excellent - they all made fantastic suggestions. When thinking about what wine to get my girlfriend told the waiter that she liked pinot noir and he knew immediately what to get. The wine he brought back was so good we asked to take a picture of the label. The desserts were delicious - gelato flavors like salted caramel and rum raisin and an assortment of small italian pastries were the perfect finish to an otherworldly meal. The pastries were even on the house! Every employee of the restaurant, from the hostess to the busboys to all the waiters were welcoming, friendly and courteous. They each made sure to wish my girlfriend a happy birthday when they had a chance.

The three of us were seated and the view looks out at Mag Mile. Nice. We had some champagne and then ordered the prefix course option on the menu.  We ordered some pan seared scallops to start. They were a little fishy smelling when dropped on the table.  (A few days past their prime?) They were also a bit salty.  My wife had the wine pairing and there were some winners in the mix but I was surprised to see him pour a 2013 red. Seems a little young for a restaurant of this stature. It was pretty good though but without much complexity. I had a 2006 vintage of an Italian red for $28. To put that in perspective, each sip is a bottle of Two Buck Chuck.  They let me taste it first and it was complex, earthy and delicious. There were some delicious courses in the mix but some were a bit salty for my taste. I also found the olive oil puree for the bread a bit salty. There were 2 pasta-y dishes that were good but it's hard to mess up pasta, cream and mushrooms.   The bill for the three of us came to around $1000 with our 20% tip. Ouch! I really wanted to like Spiaggia more but it was just OK. In summary, the food was good but not very inventive and nothing I haven't had at 100 other less expensive restaurants.

Despite having early-evening reservations, my party needed to wait to be seated.  During a busy service, this isn't a problem, but the restaurant was only half-full.  The bottleneck was an apparent lack of servers.  Once we were seated, the server left our table and made several return-visits to other tables near us before taking our drink orders.  Eventually she returned, and I ordered a bottle of champagne.   Instead of placing our order, the server instead attended to several other tables.  We were seated at six along with three other tables who began around the same time we did.  We didn't receive water or champagne until 6:30, after other tables had already ordered appetizers. At this point the server disappeared for another fifteen minutes.  We had not requested additional time with the menus.  Finally, at around 6:45, she returned and took our order.  Her demeanor was such that it was clear to us that we were a low-priority table since her other responsibilities included large groups.   Normally, something like this would not bother me enough to merit a poor review.  However, at a restaurant of the quality of Spiaggia, customers expect better.  I politely asked the server to speak to a manager.  After explaining the situation, he apologized and comped our champagne when we cancelled our order.  I went on to have a much better birthday experience at another restaurant. Overall, I cannot directly comment on Spiaggia's food or more general ambiance.  I can only report on the experience I had, which was, unfortunately, lacking.",0.9821,0.807,0.15,0.043,0.49954767454767446

From the food (gotta have the gnocchi, and end with dolcini!) to the service (professional, yet playful) to the ambiance (small restaurant, big feeling) - this is an experience that cannot be outdone.  Cost: We started with two drinks at the bar and shared a bottle of wine for dinner. We had one first course, two second courses, and two third courses, as well as the 10pc dessert. Our total bill (without tip) was $300.  Dress: The website basically states - wear whatever you want - though we all know that's not hardly the case. The majority of diners looked to be business-related: lots of men in suits. Though my husband wore jeans, and we never felt like we were being judged or under dressed.  Food: Eat it all! Specifically: though EVERYTHING we had was fantastic, I must highlight that the gnocchi was on-point with what other reviewers had to say: perfect. Do NOT order extra truffles. It's truffle-y enough and perfect without the $75 addition. The black sea bass is incredible as a main course. A large portion; the crust/skin was so perfectly crunchy with a tender flaky meat.

2014-11-15,5.0,"Excellent Italian Food, Terrific Service, Great Ambiance Having dined at Spiaggia several times, I can say that it consistently produces excellent Italian cuisine.  The ambiance is romantic, comtemporary, and relaxing.  The service is attentive and helpful.  The menu itself offers a great deal of variety with a degustazione menu as well as a la carte menu.  The degustazione (tasting) menu provides a 6-course journey through many of their delightful offerings.  They frequently showcase white truffles with can be added to the tasting menu (and to a la carte selections) for an additional cost.  We have always gone with the a la carte menu because we enjoy picking out our meals. To start, my wife selected the egg with crispy duck confit.  It was savory and delicate.  I ordered the sea scallop with apple matchsticks, pickled beets and sea urchin foam.  It was outstanding.  For our pasta course, my wife had the famous gnocchi with cream and black truffle drizzle.  It had a delicious and strong but not overwhelming accent of truffle.  Amazing.  I ordered the raviolotti filled with cheese and topped with hen-of-the woods mushrooms.  For her main course, my wife had the duck with cherry mostarda. The duck was slightly rare (as it should be) and full of flavor.  I had the suckling pig which showcased the pork belly, leg, rack, and ""compressed"" head.  All were delicious.  The pork really provided the bulk of the flavor.  It was not over dressed with sauce or seasoning.  It was the freshness of the pork that stood out. For dessert, we had the 10-selection sampler which had several excellent options.  because it was our anniversary, they also gave us a selection of dark chocolate, pistacchio, and salted caramel sorbetti (more like gelato really).   Overall is was an outstanding meal.  Of course, Spiaggia is highly rated gourmet experience.  You can expect to pay a hefty price especially if you go for the degustazione menu.  However, the artistry of the flavors and visual presentation makes it just about worth the steep price of admission. I can't think of a better place in the city to celebrate a special occasion.  There's definitely a reason we keep coming back,,, probably the gnocchi!",0.9957,0.816,0.172,0.012,0.559142857142857

And you must get their black truffle gnocchi with ricotta. My goodness was that a perfect dish. I am glad we got a large order of it because it was difficult enough to share those little potato pillows of yumminess with the size we did order. And their ravioli stuffed with fois gras was out of this world too. That one too we were all secretly fighting for a few of the odd numbered ones left after we each had our taste.  The crudo was also so fresh and flavorful which featured a striped bass with loads of flavor, but the scallop was actually my favorite starter because a perfectly seared scallop is what everyone should want in their want. The veal chop was also really really tender paired with some apple and radishes and the strip loin with more truffle goodness was another thing that was also difficult to share. And then the dessert was a giant buffet of little bites of dessert in the most gorgeous presentation ever--from macaroons with bacon to cheesecake to jellies, you name it!  Pretty much the sum of the story at this place, is the food is amazing--beautiful presentation, great flavors, amazing wine list (not cheap, my a truly great selection), and great service.

With high end restaurants, my expectation is that the servers will be attentive and available while being helpful in making choices.  Our server basically said- you can order the tasting menu or you can order a la carte- what do you want? Then, over the course of the meal, everything was disjointed. There were long waits between courses (some time between courses is good, but 20 minutes runs toward the excessive), and even longer when waiting to put in a dessert order and subsequent to that waiting for the check. I really felt that our server was in training, and if they have someone in training, they should limit the table counts so they can manage it.  The food was from excellent (yellowtail jack appetizer) to ok (overpowering richness of the ravioli). The dessert platter was outstanding though.

The food may come out a little slow for some peoples taste, so be sure to budget plenty of time for this extraordinary dining experience.  While we were looking over the menu, the waiter brought out some, cracker-like breads to tide us over. They tasted a bit like saltine crackers, and were fairly thin, nothing to special there.  Onto the first course. I ordered the cervo, which was raw diced venison, with caviar and other assorted toppings. It was delicious. The flavor of the venison really shined in this dish.  For my second course, I ordered the gnocchi. Apparently the restaurant went through a massive renovation in the spring, and this was the only dish to survive the previous menu. I can see why. I've been lucky enough to try gnocchi at many different restaurants before, but none have come close to the gnocchi at spiaggia. The sauce was light, yet creamy, and it allowed the fluffy texture and potato flavor of the gnocchi to stand out. This was my favorite dish of the night.  For my third course, I had a pig dish. It came with shredded celery, and a creamy potato paste. It tasted great, slightly like smoked bacon, but in the form of a good steak.  For dessert I ordered the 6 piece to split with my friend. I should have ordered the 12 piece at least. These desserts were divine, each bite was an explosion in your taste buds.

2014-08-16,4.0,"Welcome to the newly and fully renovated Spiaggia! The decor looked crisp and clean and I liked it! When you entered the lounge, you passed these cured meat counter and looking at the beautiful Prosciutto diParma, Mangalica and Iberico hams just sitting there by the leg and in their glory next to the slicer, I couldn't help to take a big gulp of anticipation of devouring them slice by slice. Purse, get ready..because this isn't going to be cheap! We had to wait for our table because we were early. We wished to be sat early but they were busy. We graciously waited and ordered cocktail then come to realize that the purse wasn't ready as it was left in the hotel room. The server wouldn't serve me alcohol though when she asked for my ID, I was giddy because she thought I was young enough to be carded. My friends ordered drinks and I took a sip of my friend Bellini. The same server saw me drank the Bellini, and she came and reprimanded me saying she couldn't let me drink it because I had no ID. This was after my friends showed her their ID and let's just say I just had my 20 year high school reunion that weekend. She even said that I could speak to a manager if I weren't happy with her enforcing company policy. I didn't really know if I were supposed to be happy that she really thought and couldn't see me being over 21 without seeing my ID, appreciate the fact she is a true enforcer of the law, or if I were pissed off that she was so obnoxiously strict. Though I didn't have gray hair, I think it was pretty obvious that I am well above 21. Lesson of the day, bring your ID if you want to drink here. They didn't care that the bill could have been $100 more for alcohol. No ID, they'll be happy to serve you complimentary Acqua Panna still or San Pellegrino sparkling water. We ordered the scallop crudo and mangalica ham along with Tellegio cheese to start while we waited. They were so good. Small portion for about $10 for the meat and $8 for the cheese for 2 tiny slices. They served it with toasts that were glazed with olive oil. Simply nom nom nom. Finally we made our way to our table. We ordered two pasta dishes, gnocchi and stratti di vitello. The gnocchi was the only thing that survived the remodel. It was the only menu item that was kept from the old menu. It was superb and so well made. The black truffle sauce was also to die for. The stratti di vitello was layers of flat pasta sheets that were decorated with some fine micro herbs directly in the pasta. They looked so pretty like wallpapers. It was served with veal cheeks, sweet breads that had been lightly fried, ramp and morel mushrooms. I felt like I died and went to heaven. One of my friends ordered the seafood risotto. He said it was nice and it had a little heat. Another friend ordered the Manzo and it was pretty much strip loin served with truffle and baby turnip and it was garnished with this tuille crisp made with squid ink. The steak was wet aged though.. Mh.. For desserts, you can order by pieces.. 6, 9, or 12. We ordered a 6 piece and it came with some candy type desserts like a gooseberry that was dipped in chocolate, a tiramisu served in a shot glass.. Rightfully so as you tasted nothing but brandy. Oh.. But I didn't have my ID.. What to do? Was it ok now?? But the star was the fruit pavlova. It was a proper dessert. Overall, the food was superb. I could do without the obnoxious miss server, though. Oh, I forgot to mention that they served you rustic Italian bread slices in the dining room served with hardened olive oil that had butter consistency. It was just fantastic. The servers in the dining room were much nicer and I truly appreciate on how each one of them explained the food when it came to the table. They were very knowledgeable and the way they delivered the info was so personal and cool, accompanied with little story behind each dish, that you felt like you knew the dish. They weren't just saying generic description. It was first class. I wanted to give 5 stars but that server almost made me walk out if it wasn't for my friends.

The entire table got the tasting menu with the wine pairings. Since I have a lot of dietary restrictions (don't eat seafood or any meat), they pretty much had to redo the entire tasting menu. The staff was super accomodating. Although it did take them a couple of minutes to understand what I meant by ""meat"" and ""seafood""... I was pretty nervous when the first course came out -- the waitress basically described it as the same thing as the regular tasting menu minus the soup. The soup seemed to be the main part because other than that all I had were some vegetables. Luckily, things really picked up after that course. Everything was good, but most of the courses were not amazing. The only course that really blew me away was the gnocchi (a subsititution we made for the ravioli in the tasting menu). It is freakin' perfect -- creamy and decadent. Only downside was that the portion was so small. If I could just have a giant portion of gnocchi instead of the other 6 courses, I would have been much happier with the food. Other than the tiramisu, the dessert was mediocre at best.  Overall, a pretty good dining experience. If I ever go back, I am sticking to the gnocchi.

2014-07-05,5.0,"Amazing, outstanding, legendary!  It took me a long time to admit this as I had to truly ponder many truly fabulous meals throughout my lifetime, however the answer is clear - my recent meal at Spiaggia was the best meat of my life. We were honeymooning in Chicago and almost pulled Spiaggia off our list as we were going to a number of super $$$ places and didn't want to get too carried away.  SO glad we decided to go for it anyway! Admittedly the meal was not off to the best of starts.  We knew they had just reopened and that the intention was to be more casual, less stuffy.  However servers were in suits and not at all warm, very formal and proper.  You can have impeccable service without all the pomp and circumstance - and I think that if Spiaggia is going for a more comfortable vibe, the service needs to aim for that.  I also felt a little off put by the fact that the pricing on the pasta portions was all for appetizer size dishes - it wasn't a huge deal (and do not get me wrong - the price is WORTH IT), but I was irked as price was a factor as we picked what places we would be visiting and this was a surprise to us when we arrived.  And lastly, the first food to arrive at the table were the most boring bland weird breadsticks to ever exist and all I could think was that we had really made a poor decision in coming.  Oh and haha, I ordered some specialty cocktail that came with a honey-carrot popcorn.  The drink arrived with a paper cone of popcorn clipped to the rim.  So logistically, there was no way to eat the popcorn and have a sip, as you would either dump the popcorn all over yourself or you would have to ""drink"" the popcorn out of the cone that you couldn't set down on the table because of its shape.  Just a basic logistical fail on that one. OK from here on out - BEST MEAL EVER. Our amuse was an incredible bite of a spring pea soup with some kind of foam and a rye bread crisp and wow - that bite alone told me that I was judging things way too quickly and that there was a reason we had picked Spiaggia to be our first meal in Chicago.  I really couldn't believe how good it was. Next up I had their ""carne crudo"" appetizer and I almost literally licked that plate clean (just lots, and lots of scraping!).  I almost ordered another one, it was that good - and while I'm not generally afraid to spend money on great food - adding an extra $23 app isn't my norm!   And then.  And then. The gnocchi.  All the reviewers were right (THANK YOU YELP!).  The gnocchi was pure heaven.  Every single bite, my eyes rolled to the back of my head as all I could think was that I was eating food meant for the gods.  Light beautiful gnocchi in rich decadent sauce - this is what I would ask for as my last meal.   And desserts!  I thought the dessert menu was so funny - it was like ""desserts - 6, 12 or 24"" without any real description at all.  We figured, OK, little pastry plate, why not, we'll get 12 and if it's too much we have our midnight snack.  What a surprise when the most beautiful assortment of cleverly crafted 12 mini works of art came out!  There were a few misses out of the bunch for me personally, but I sure got a kick out of how delicate and special each and every one was.  And a chocolate bone marrow macaron?!  OK now you're just showing off. We skipped the big expenses so no wine, no caviar, no added truffle - so 3 cocktails, 2 apps, 2 entrees, and the selection of 12 desserts came to $212.  I'm calling that a no-brainer absolute WIN for the best meal I have ever eaten.  We were so impressed with Chicago that I know we'll be back - and I cannot wait to experience Spiaggia again!!!",0.9984,0.766,0.176,0.058,0.5341465804428767

2014-05-25,2.0,"I should have known something was off when Chicago's ""finest"" Italian restaurant had availability when I called the same day - a Saturday night reservation at 7:00.   I chose Spiaggias to celebrate a very important accomplishment in my daughter's life. Jackets are required for men- perfect- we wanted the atmosphere of fine dining last night - the three of us spent extra time getting ready, dressing the part for this special occasion.  But, from the moment we walked in, things just didn't add up.  The hostess smiled and asked our name, but when another couple walked in behind us, she  set us aside to help them before seating us. As they walked up to the bar, I noticed the man was wearing a wind breaker.  Maybe the hostess was going to get him a jacket. But it was clear that wasn't going to be happening  - when we were finally seated, it was next to a man wearing a sport shirt and blue jeans. Our table was oddly turned, too, so that I was sitting facing this man and his hairy arms rather than having a view of the rest of the restaurant or out the beautiful windows onto Michigan Avenue. I requested a change of tables. That was easy enough because there were so few people there....everyone else dining out in chicago last night knew what I didn't.  Not a good place to be on a Saturday night at 7:00. I had a feeling things weren't going to get better and they didn't. At that point, I remembered online photos of the restaurant had shown cozy elegant booths with linen table cloths. No linen table cloths, no booths. I thought maybe I had chosen the wrong ""Spiaggias.  Too much attention was the next problem. They wouldn't leave us alone. Someone was always refilling our water glasses after a few sips, sometimes reaching across one of us to reach the other. Our meal and conversation were regularly interrupted, and we had to laugh when sometimes we were served sparkling water, sometimes not....in the same half full glass!! The rolls were dry, the portions microscopic, the champagne $30 a glass. Others have raved about the food. I've dined in many wonderful restaurants and I would say it was fine, but nothing special. In the end, $500 for 3 of us for dinner would have actually made me happy had the evening been one of the best dining experiences of our lives, but we left the restaurant feeling sad and still slightly hungry....and I'm sad even this morning.",0.9939,0.769,0.173,0.058,0.4432940323565324

Only flaw in the night was the server at times made us feel that were were not knowledgeable of fine dining and wine and was a little pretentious. Not sure if this was because we are in our late 20s/early 30s, but if we have the money to have a $600 dinner with drinks, we at least deserve some pampering to make us feel appreciated as a customer.

(One person in my party ordered outside the RW menu and got a pasta dish--it looked and was reportedly tasty, but...well, it was a lot of money for pasta.) We tried a few different dishes. They were not things on the regular menu, which isn't a great sign for RW. The ingredients were small and not great (e.g., chicken thighs). The mozzarella and prosciutto app was tasty, better than the entree. The desserts were also good, a choice of 2 or 3, and a substantial amount of dessert (too much fo one person each, actually). The gelato was good, and the zeppoli were reportedly also good, although I tried them and they weren't as warm or as soft as I'd have liked at that point. Service was okay, a bit slow, but better than rushing us. They held our table a few minutes, which was nice of them. The wine was really over the top in terms of price, which is of course how they still turn a very tidy profit on RW (that and the inferior food).

We physically got up to get it because there was no servers present,  I wouldn't have an issue but at $120 a bottle they should be on top of it,  Also, the menu has only the main ingredients but little detail about the serving and preparation of the food.  No server even gave us these details and a few people at our table where surprised when the food came out. Had the menu been explained a little better they may have ordered differently. I would say if the price point was lower say 50 to 75 per person I could give this place more stars but given its about $250 or more person depending on your drinks and coursing its not worth the money.  Half of the menu has very high up charges to add to the minimum $115 per person you will pay for dinner but if you want the steak you can tack on another 55 dollars for 3 or so ounces.  This is just crazy to me for what you get.  I have no problem paying for good food but I better walk out with no issues!

2013-11-28,5.0,"***Spiaggia may feel dated, but the food is fairly contemporary and their tasting menu showcases great flavor combinations as well as many high quality premium ingredients like diver scallops, truffles, dry-aged beef, caviar, and burrata*** The fine dining Italian restaurant Spiaggia feels dated.  The dining room has a great view of Michigan Avenue's bustling shopping scene, parks, greens, trees, and even glimpses of Lake Michigan, but the decor with the table setups and pillars feel a little past its prime.  Jackets are required and the menu does not sound that contemporary. Spiaggia though delivers very satisfying upscale cuisine that is rich with very nicely prepared premium ingredients and this is not easy to do with Italian cuisine.  Italian cuisine really works as refined and contemporary versions of rustic dishes, but some of the renowned Italian fine dining restaurants I have been to (Acquerello, Vetri, Valentino) had good things about them, but they just simply did not measure up to other fine dining restaurants I have been to.  Some of it was because the food felt too simple or old-fashioned and the resulting flavors were just not that special for the high prices being charged. Spiaggia is different though.  Their tasting menu unveiled one great and luxurious course after another and truffles were everywhere--and very good truffles too with great aromas.  The food here stays very simple, but a real talented kitchen is on display here as the simple courses reveal a purity and intensity of the three or four flavors on the plate. A great example of Spiaggia's simple but elegant and perfectly cooked cuisine was their potato gnocchi with ricotta cream sauce and black truffle.  The gnocchi was incredibly light and fluffy and the ricotta cream sauce was great--light, velvety with a smooth and distinct ricotta flavor.  The black truffle provided a great and pungent finish. yelp.com/user_local_phot… The diver scallop was also great.  It was big and plump with a very moist center (nicely soft too).  The outside sear was great and provided a slightly crisp texture.  There was a nice salty note from some very good cheese and very good sweet corn puree.  There was also a dusting of black truffle, which really worked because all of the flavors on the plate seemed to really work together. Their first course was a great flavor combination too and a classic one.  There was creamy burrata with very good, salty, briny, and tasting of the ocean caviar, and a crunchy potato crisp.  This was a great start to the meal--very clean in flavor and bright too with the vibrant and fruity olive oil. There was really indulgent food too.  The duck breast was very juicy and had soft meat to go with the crispy and thick skin.  There was also a velvety and buttery seared foie gras and a classic fruit sauce to go with the duck (blackberry jus). There were modern takes on traditional dishes too.  The moist and very flavorful dry aged carne crudo was wrapped in crispy focaccia.  There were fresh greens to lighten the dish and, of course, truffle for an extravagant touch. The only disappointing savory course was the squid ink tagliolini with zucchini, toasted breadcrumbs and Jonah crab.  The pasta was very good and I liked the crispy crunch of the breadcrumbs.  The dish though felt overly creamy and there needed to be heat or something salty in the dish.  The Jonah crab was fine, but it did not pop as the other ingredients served like the very fresh scallop, the thick duck breast and the nicely prepared foie gras (which was very nicely cut and cooked). Dessert was rich but very good.  There was light chocolate mousse with a very good, rich and creamy dark chocolate sorbet.  There were many other great elements on the plate like espresso granita (strong in coffee flavor) and sticky Italian meringue.  There were some very pleasant mignardises to end the meal including fresh doughnuts, pate de fruit, chocolates, and biscotti. Service was good.  The staff was pleasant and the food came out at a good and even pace. As mentioned, the dining room felt dated, but the view was great and something you can probably not easily find in Chicago. Prices are very high and you can find much more exciting food in Chicago at similar prices, but at least Spiaggia serves high quality and premium ingredients like foie gras, duck breast, Jonah crab, diver scallops, truffles, and caviar to make the high prices seem more justified. Spiaggia is a great restaurant if you are looking for a really indulgent and luxurious Italian dinner in Chicago.  I prefer upscale restaurants that are more creative and deliver more exciting cuisine, but there is still a place for restaurants like Spiaggia that serve elegant takes on classic flavor combinations that have bright and strong flavors as well as perfectly cooked proteins and pastas.

Last Saturday (our first full weekend in Chicago) we were looking on Open Table for available reservations for a last minute, late dinner somewhere nearby. We saw there was a table available at Spiaggia and we jumped on the chance. We were excited about dinner as we had both heard great things about Spiaggia; but we were also welcoming the chance to get dressed up and go to a nice dinner after the exhaustion/stress of moving half-way across the country.  We both opted for the 4 course traditional menu dinner.  Mine: 1st- Burrata with chives and caviar (so good I dont even know how to put it into words) 2nd- Gnocchi with Italian summer truffles (dont go to Spiaggia without getting the gnocchi) 3rd- Artichokes with ricotta di buffala (perfectly done with just a hint of citrus. delicious) 4th- this chocolate dessert platter with espresso granita (good, but probably the least impressive of my courses) His: 1st- Wagyu Crudo 2nd- Gnocchi with Australian Black truffles 3rd- the Lamb chop 4th- (I honestly cant remember what he got for dessert because I was too blown away by the whole meal to take note) Our meals came with a complementary dessert finish that included these little donuts with raspberry compote that were divine. When we go back Im going to ask for just those little donuts as my dessert!

2013-07-21,4.0,"I came here with high expectations, since this is one of those restaurants that is always mentioned as one that you should try if you're a Chicagoean, or at least before you die. It is stated that this is the only 4-star Italian restaurant in Chicago. The restaurant was right off of Oak and North Michigan, so it's easy to find. Get validation at the 900; after 6pm, it's $5. The restaurant is in a building, so you have to take the escalator upstairs, where both the Cafe and the dining room are located. Because we made a reservation, we were seated within 10 minutes. Thankfully, we had a window seat, so we were able to see the Oak and Michigan area view outside, and the park across the street. The restaurant itself is very hoity toity, and the table itself was simplistic, yet pretty. Our server offered us any assistance as well as explained the 'proper reading' of the 2 menus. One was the tasting course, and the other was a la carte. It was 'highly suggested' that one plate per each category was ordered since it was sized accordingly. For the 'antipasti,' we ordered the Burrata Pugliese con Tre Varie di Funghi - these were Pugliese burrata with marinated porcini mushrooms, wood-roasted hedgehog mushrooms, and shaved trumpet royale mushrooms with Parmigano. It tasted like pulled mozzerella string cheese-like mound, topped with a vinegar-y like cold mushroom, strands of leeks, or a wood-roasted something. Not sure if the flavors of the mushrooms came  through. For our main entrees, I ordered the Gnocchi di Patate in Salsa di Rocotta e Tartufi Neri. These were 'handrolled' potato gnocchi with ricotta sauce with Umbrian black truffle(s). The gnocchi were pillowy soft, and they  definitely melt in your mouth. The ricotta (and me, being not much of a ricotta fan) was pleasantly surprising - it was thick, creamy, seasoned well, and great in dipping the bread that they serve you on a wooden tray. The tiny slice of a truffle was set on top, so no plurals of those fungis here. There was a drizzle of some black sauce, so I'm thinking it's some truffle emulsion of some sort, but it looked like the gnocchi was covered with squid skin. Hmmm.  Either way, I really really really enjoyed this dish and would have loved this plate to be an entree-size, times it by 10! I also had the Spaghetti Neri Alla Chitarra con Aragosta, Peperoncini di Calabria e Menta. These were 'hand-crafted' squid ink spaghetti with lobster chunks, dried Calabrian chilis and mint. I was trying to see if this dish was comparable to the Black Spaghetti over at Babbo's in NY, but the latter is a clear winner. However, the squid ink spaghetti was interesting to the taste, and the bits of the calabria were like tiny bacon chunks. The shredded mint leaves didn't do anything with the pasta, and it overpowered everything - I preferred these to be picked out. My cousin, on the other hand, had the Ravioli di Roctta di Pecora con Pancetta D'Agnello e Pesto di Menta. These raviolis were lined up, filled with sheep's milk ricotta with lamb pancetta, shallots, tomato, and dots of mint pesto. It tasted like a strong bleu cheese filled ravioli, but besides that, a bit bland, and the minto pesto wasn't doing much. I think the whole combination of the 'mint jelly with lambchops' were highly missed in this ravioli version. Not seasoned, but the sheep's milk ricotta had a bold enough flavor that you kind of forget within the  few seconds it's in your mouth. For dessert, my cousin and I shared the Monte Bianco, which was a chestnut mousse and chocolate tart with toasted Italian meringue. This was a tart that was half chocolate and half chestnut mouse (definitely can taste the chestnuts), and topped with meringue that was slightly toasted. Interesting combination, but it had a combination of flavors, one after another - it first started of with ginger-like, then creamy chestnuts, then the chocolate hits you at the end. I was a fan of the small little glass box full of single-piece cookies and truffles (no dessert knife to split into two portions to share - either fight for it, or use the side of your fork); there was also a box of a pistachio-like nougat that was cutely-wrapped in a box to go (but of course, we devoured these instead). Service was efficient; free bottled water was always refilled; silverware were always replaced; table was always cleared soon after we were done; never any hounding or aggressiveness; the staff were quite courteous; bread on the wooden tray were tasty (I have no shame and always ask to try one of each, so don't be so hard on yourself for being indecisive!); and the ambiance was romantic. I loved the fact that I was able to try this place.  It is definitely the best gnocchi I've ever had. +Gnocchi di Patate in Salsa di Rocotta e Tartufi Neri",0.9979,0.841,0.127,0.031,0.4851874856222682
2013-07-08,4.0,"This is a restaurant for you to try once and then move on. It's extremely expensive. Granted the services were great, but weren't ""wow, plate synchronization omg"" great (LOL). It's a bit overrated IMHO. Everyone was nice and courtesous with smiles. They put you at the bar if you come earlier than  your reservation, even if it was 10 minutes earlier. Then a different host seated us at a table by the window. Then the waitor thoroughly explained everything on the menu. After the orders, they offer you various rolls to choose from. Then came an apitizer (it was mackerel for us) complimentary from the chief. After that, your food arrives one by one. I'm glad that I tried it but probably will never do it again. It was over $800 for 4 of us: 3 with the pasta tasting with wine pairing and 1 guest just had entrée and dessert with a cocktail. The portions for the pasta tasting were tiny, even the entrée course; though the guest's entrée that didn't get the tasting was a decent size. The wines were ridiculously modest. You wouldn't even feel damp if you spill it on your lap... For the price, I expected more. The view was just okay; you overlooked the streets below and that was it. Food quality was good and different, but then again it wasn't ""wow, it's fireworks in my mouth"" (which I was sort of expecting after so many referral and the sky high price). The snail in the pasta shell was a hoot. It had a great presentation and we couldn't stop laughing when they said the snails were basil fed. The gnocchi was a bit too salty for me. The squid ink pasta didn't taste any different than regular pasta except it was black. The sweet bread and veal was a good fusion, but the portion was totally too small to be called an entrée. I didn't care for their wine pairing, except for the dessert mixer and some cranberry cocktail during the mid course. I do love their basil rolls and it was free! Lol.

The salad smelled, and tasted, fantastic - how rare, to have a perfect salad. I didn't even bother with the dressing. My chocolate dessert was excellent, but it was the sorbets that blew us all away.

The waiter helped me with my seat  (right next to the window) and made his recommendations as we perused our menus. We decided to start our meal with some tea....by far the most expensive tea purchase I've ever made. I tried the cocoa infusion for $13 which tasted like any other inconsequential tea I've had before. Personally lipton satisfies me more. Least it came with a pot, sugar cubes and tiny jars of honey. Appropriately fancy. We ordered the Carne Cruda Di Vitello Con Focaccia (raw lamb, poached pear and crispy focaccia) as an appetizer and though we tried to make the bite sized appetizer last, it really didn't. It was tasty but we mostly attempted to make it taste like $30. Haha. For dinner I ordered the entree sized Gnocchi Di Patate In Salsa Di Ricotta E Tartufi Neri. MANY people swear this is the best Gnocchi they've ever tried...I however felt like the entire plate tasted like ricotta cheese...and that's pretty much it. I loved the consistency of the gnocchi but soon the rich flavor of ricotta was too much for my palette and I was sipping on tea and eating bread (which is very good there btw) in between bites. We wrapped up our meal with the Gelati E Sorbetti and selected three flavors- Cinnamon rice milk (our favorite..tasted like rice pudding) Stracciatella (vanilla with chocolate shavings-also tasty)  and salted caramel (which was our least favorite) The staff then proceeded to give us a hefty sampling of chocolate treats...we probably shouldn't have eaten them all but we did and an unnecessary sugar rush ensued.  Overall I thought the food was ok. We sat by the window but I didn't think it was an amazing view either. Mostly trees with a hint of river behind it. We opted for an early dinner to guarantee a window seat but now we know to wait till the sun sets before coming to a place like this.

2013-03-02,4.0,"Spiaggia recently announced that they were rolling out a series of four themed pasta tasting menus, the first being filled pastas. At $95 for six courses this is pricey (especially for pasta) but considerably less expensive than their typical tasting menu (currently is a six course menu featuring Perigord black truffles for $175, but at times can exceed the cost of Alinea). My wife and I had been wanting to try Spiaggia and decided that this would be a nice opportunity to do so at a more palatable price point. Entering Spiaggia we were reminded some of Per Se in terms of the view, riding an escalator up to the venue, and the large door to the reception area. There is a luxurious foyer, floor to ceiling windows with Lake Michigan off in the distance, the ambiance is pure elegance but not without an air of stuffiness. Our captain presented us with three menus soon after being seated (there is an a la carte menu, also extremely expensive in addition to the tasting menus); I enjoyed the flexibility Spiaggia has in that our captain explained that we could each select different tasting menus and it was also alright for one person to order a la carte and the other to do a tasting menu if we so desired. We both opted for the pasta tasting menu and my wife added the wine pairings (priced at $55) and I chose cocktail pairings ($45). The cocktail pairings were fun; about two to three ounce pours each featuring a different liquor with some nice ingredients such as mezcal and kumquat jam for the bourbon based cocktail. While they were fun and I enjoyed them, they did not pair as well with the food as did the more traditional wine pairings.  Soon after ordering bread service commenced; four different selections with a basil bread filled with cheese being the standout. Not quite up there with L20's or Sixteen's bacon buns, but among my favorite bread I have had during the past year. What was nice was we were offered additional bread on three further occasions during the night; as my wife and I both have rather robust appetites this was much appreciated as it ensured we were comfortably satiated by the end of the evening. My wife is famous for stopping for pizza on the way home from fine dining, so that she did without (aside from eating three girl scout cookies when we arrived home) was a good sign! The food was quite good, but that is to be expected at this price point. Even though a pasta tasting menu does not sound as though it would have the excitement of a typical tasting menu, they did a nice job adding a variety of exotic flavors and ingredients to jazz everything up and the pasta itself was far superior to most other pastas I have consumed. The first course was a lot of fun and included three different miniature portions of pasta (one made from squid ink) each topped with a different caviar or roe. Some pastas included seafood and others were paired with meat such as some excellent lamb meatballs and another with Jidori chicken roulade. In addition to the six courses there was an amuse bouche and five different mignardises delivered with dessert (one oddity about this was there was a single piece of each, so difficult to share).  Service at Spiaggia is fairly polished and they do an excellent job adjusting the menu to meet dietary restrictions and aversions. When there was a delay with one course they apologized and refilled my wife's wine glass. However service is just a bit too impersonal; while I appreciate formal service, I find a dining experience far more enjoyable when the staffs' personalities shine through. Grace and Eleven Madison Park would be the two venues that I feel are the gold standard in having both formal yet personable service. There also were more gaffes than would be expected from a venue of this caliber; our shaved truffle supplement we ordered for one course was omitted and my wife was bumped into by the person refilling water glasses on multiple occasions - and later noticed water had been spilled onto her purse. For it's price range Spiaggia fails to deliver a comparable overall experience to several other top tier restaurants where in addition to a wonderful meal you receive one or more of a kitchen tour, meeting the executive chef, souvenir menu, elegant mignardises cart, a take home pastry etc. Not a big deal, but when splurging for such an expensive meal it is nice to feel pampered and as though you had a memorable evening beyond simply the luxurious food that was consumed. This was no doubt an excellent meal but for the price tag my expectations are adjusted upwards accordingly.

We ordered individual items since the two tasting menus seemed a bit daunting. My two star review is entirely based on the service experience. We arrived on time for a 7pm reservation on a Wednesday night and our table was somehow not ready even though the restaurant was only half-full. We were invited to sit at the bar while we waited (perhaps 10 minutes or so); the wait was not off-putting just odd. We ordered a drink at the bar and were escorted to our table and our drinks were brought to us. So far so good. Our primary waitress then welcomes us after another 5 minutes or so go by (we have our drinks- so again- not a huge issue so far). First impressions on our waitress are very positive as she explains the three different menus. Then, we were basically abandoned for 35 minutes. The ancillary staff popped in and out to refill water but our waitress never checked on our table for 35 minutes (it might have been longer). My dinner companion and I started wondering if she hadn't stopped by because our menus were still opened so we eventually closed them 15 minutes in.... and then we slid our closed menues closer to the edge of the table. What was off-putting was that she didn't disappear completely- she would walk by our table, check in on other tables and not check-in on us. We were not given an opportunity to order until 50 minutes after we walked into the place. From here, I suppose service improved (we DID enjoy our meal and I don't know if it makes sense to complain about cost since the food and space are wonderful), but we expected more from a restaurant of this caliber. Other odd service things happened like drinks and plates being snatched away without asking if we were done (""may I take this?""

Everything we ate and drank at this restaraunt was exactly twice as expensive as it should have been. From the $18 glass of prosecco to the $65 piece of fish. I would have been pleased if I spent exactly half as much for what I got.  We did not get a single course that was properly seasoned (which would have helped me justify the expense) and we did not have an extra $300 to spend on truffles on every plate, so we settled.  Was it bad? Not at all. It was....fine. I love fancy places. I just think that $300 for a dinner should buy you a mind that is blown.

2012-11-14,2.0,"Came here last Saturday and were incredibly disappointed. My husband and I both tried the tasting menu.  At $165 a person without wine pairings, this is already similarly or even more expensive than much finer places like Jean George or Daniel in New York where we moved form (Spiaggia has one Michelin star while JG and Daniel have three).  But whatever, cost is not a huge deal if the food is worth it.  And boy it was NOT at all. The first course was the Sunchoke panna cotta with Maine sea urchin, Mieli Thun mountain flower honey and blood orange.  It did not look like panna cotta but a bowl of custard and tasted like crap.  We were having trouble even figuring out how to eat it when the waitress came by with spoons and said that ""tonight's was especially runny"" so maybe the spoons would help.  Hello?  At a restaurant that charges $165 for 5 courses, you don't serve a course if it's ""especially runny."" Chitarra spaghetti with basil fed snails, shaved baby artichokes, basil and toasted breadcrumbs.  It was not as terrible as the first course, but definitely not great either.  The snails were miniscule and there were only two of them.  To be honest, it was a little bland. The next two courses were pretty decent - the Organic Acquerello risotto with Maine lobster, La Quercia Guanciale, Caciocavallo Silano DOP and Mieli Thun dandelion honey and the Wood roasted pancetta wrapped squab with porcini mushrooms,  heirloom grapes, mortadella and sage.  Even though I'm not a huge fan of squab, it was still cooked well and I enjoyed it. The fifth course was a rather boring dessert.  I don't even remember it, except that I do remember feeling disappointed with the overall meal and kind of surprised at how quickly it went by and how unimpressed I was by the entire experience. The service was decent, although not all of our dishes came out at the same time which is unusual for a place that charges so much.  I definitely am not coming back.",0.7001,0.796,0.11,0.094,0.604066985645933

2012-09-12,2.0,"At these prices, your food had better be through the roof.  A recent dinner at Spiaggia was closer to the basement.   I hadn't been there for a good 15 years.  Fifteen years ago, the food was beyond compare.  I  still remember a sublime ravioli as if it were yesterday.  But today . . . .?    On a recent Tuesday night, a girl's night out to celebrate a birthday, the beautiful dining room was only a third full.  I can understand why. Other than the affable host who seated us, service was stiff and uninformative.  Nobody told us anything about the food.  Waitstaff for our table was exclusively middle aged tuxedoed men of the style found in hotels in the 1970's.  Our waiter didn't say one word to us about the food or wine, except to tell us we should order all three courses (appetizer, pasta, main course) off the ala carte menu for a ""traditional Italian dinner,"" and that the pastas were not main course size but appetizer portion.   I've travelled to Italy over 10 times and this had nothing to do with traditional Italian food. Since the appetizers were priced from $30 to $90, we passed on those. The ""appetizer portion"" pastas -- thirty bucks -- were literally six forkfuls.  Small forkfuls.  We counted them.  That runs to five bucks a small forkful.  At five bucks a bite, the pasta had better be overwhelming.  My spaghetti with lobster was totally ordinary.  Light tomato sauce.  Couldn't taste the alleged lobster at all.  You can get much better at Coco Pazzo or any other high class Italian restaurant in the city without the pretension -- and a lot more than six forkfuls for your thirty bucks.  My two friends had the gnocchi, which was slathered with obscene amounts of  cheese and truffle oil.  Tasty but a cheap trick and very, very heavy..   My entree, a venison sausage with allegedly all sorts of interesting things going on in it -- I can't even remember what the menu said -- tasted like dry venison sausage with a smear of a mustard sauce on the plate, some grapes.  If memory serves, it was $62.  Maybe $64. My friends had the halibut and salmon dishes.  I tasted them. Also cost more than 60 bucks each.   Very average.  If anything, both fishes were slightly overcooked. Nobody came by during the meal to see if we were enjoying our food and our highly overpriced bottle of chianti.  (Maybe they knew what a ripoff it was.) The bggest insult, however, came with dessert.  When I made the reservation, I mentioned that one of our party was having a birthday.  I didn't know if they'd do anything for her, but it never hurts to mention it.   Well, time for dessert came.  We ordered three desserts.  Seventeen bucks each.  The waiter brought three desserts.   The panna cotta was delicious.  The gelato was totally forgettable.  (I forget what the third dessert was.)  When we were halfway through our desserts, the waiter came with a huge plate of rhum baba with a candle on it ... ""happy birthday and compliments of the house.""   After we'd ordered and paid for a dessert for the birthday girl?  THEN they bring the complimentary dessert.  How cheesy.  How very cheap.

2012-08-15,3.0,"I ate here with a group of 6 a few weeks ago on a Monday night - I know, who goes to a place like this on a Monday night, but it was a business dinner. I wanted to use open table to get the dining points, but alas, for a party of this size you have to call the restaurant to make sure they can accommodate your group.   Half of our party arrived early and we settled into the bar area waiting for others to arrive.  The wine list is extensive and exclusively from Italy, but the way the drink menu is laid out is a little confusing and hard to read. I go with a red wine from Tuscany (the name escapes me) which is priced at $29 for a glass!  The rest of our group orders a drink and we are escorted to our seats just around the corner.   The dining room is very opulent highlighted by the dual glass chandeliers and views out onto Michigan Ave. We were presented with two menus, one a choice of tasting menus and their a la carte menu.  While I would have loved to try the tasting menu inspired by their ""Top Chef"", the group decided to plow ahead off of their regular menu. The menu is organized into three sections; antipasti, primi piatti, and secondi piatti. I chose to go with the carne cruda, the finely diced raw veal lion.  The veal was very rich and best eaten with the crustini that it's served with.  It was a good start but not too memorable. Most others at the table went with the diver scallop, which looked delicious although you only get one.  I next went with the potato gnocchi, which was explained as the item that never leaves the menu. It was pillowy goodness, especially when paired with the ricotta sauce. So far the highlight of othe meal!  I decided to finish with the venison sausage wrapped with artichokes and foie gras.  What a little piece of heaven. It was clearly the best dish of the night, but very rich. I believe that I got 4 pieces of venison sausages all wrapped with that delicious foie. Wow - everyone at the table was jealous of my choice and it would be the reason to head back again sooner. Most others at the table ordered some sort of fish dish to finish. I can't remember what I ordered for dessert, but it wasn't spectacular or all that memorable.  All in all it was a great dining experience, but not a place that I would rush back to given the choice. The downfalls were the wait time for the check, required jackets for men, as well as the prices of the wine list - we got one bottle of white $90 and a bottle of red that was approx $200. The servers made you think that Spiaggia is the only place you can get these wines, while I researched afterwards and found them online for less than 1/8th the price. the service was impeccable yet stuffy. While I loved what I ordered, you can tell some others at the table left not overwhelmed. For the money I want to feel blown away and leave the resturant in bliss planning my next return date - since I cannot honestly say that I felt that way, I'm giving you 3 stars Spiaggia for the quality of food and service.

2012-07-25,2.0,"Michelin needs to revisit his star and take it back. I had my doubts about this place as I was making the reservation. I called early on a Friday and actually got a reservation at peak dinner hours on the same day. Now for a restaurant with a Michelin star, in the city, with staffing chefs on Top Chef to have a last minute availability something must have been off or I was just really lucky. I decided to go with the latter and keep my reservation. Upon arrival, we were incredibly late due to unforeseen circumstances. They were understanding and still seated us without any issues.  Plus one star for that. On my reservation I had noted dietary restrictions of any of my guests. I guess they didn't read any of it because one of my guests received a plate of food with beans in it, when I clearly stated on my reservation no beans.  Not a big deal because he just ate around the beans but still, you would expect a restaurant of this caliber to get the details of a meal like this correct.  Now you can say maybe they didn't get my reservation request but prior to the beginning of the meal my guest also reiterated his dietary restrictions.  Another restriction he had was no spicy food and his main course was covered in black pepper which set him off into a coughing spell.  They, of course, remade the dish but my guest had already lost his appetite by then.  Moving on to my dishes. I have no dietary restrictions so I figured my meal would go smoothly but no, this did not happen.  I ordered one of the tasting menus and the salmon dish came out UNDERCOOKED.  Now I can understand if you just wanted to cook the fish medium rare or if it was a tataki type of a dish where it should just be seared on the outside but this was a salmon steak that was clearly meant to be cooked thoroughly and the center was completely COLD. They were of course apologetic and gave me a new salmon dish that was cooked properly but this interrupted the flow of the meal because by the time I got my salmon again, my guests had already finished their main course. Throughout the whole night it also took a while to get service from the staff whenever we needed something (i.e. refill on our waters, etc.) and the guy who comes around with the bread crumb scooper was scooping the crumbs onto my seat which you're really suppose to catch with your hands as you're cleaning off the table so you don't end up sitting on the bread crumbs!  Now all these details I can overlook in say a regular joe smoe restaurant like Chili's but in a Michelin star restaurant, these are details that should not be overlooked.",-0.6468,0.922,0.035,0.044,0.32030130363463694

My pasta was greaat. I was expecting the gnocchi to be excellent after reading peoples' reviews, but felt that I had better (though it was still really good). My sister really enjoyed it though. After that pretty awesome primi we had high expectation of our main dishes. I ordered the guinea hen while my sister got the prime strip loin. I liked my dish but felt that my primi was a better. She felt the same about her food. I really liked that their dishes were not as small as I thought they'd be though (I got pretty full halfway through my secondi)--the portions were just right, and that's a plus.

2012-04-28,2.0,"Let me start by pointing out that the experience was nothing more than an utter disappointment. And, to be very honest, up to this date there is no place in Chicago that has disappointed me more than Spiaggia. It is not in my nature at all to be extremely critical or even a plain SOB (cfr. other reviews). On top of that, I would love nothing more than not to be named person in this reviewing of Spiaggia, but I just cannot do that in good conscience.  Let me start by summing up what I think of the restaurant in short sentences: - great interior - unfriendly yet helpful welcome - friendly, yes even impeccable service - disappointing food - portions are really too small (and coming from me, that means something (cfr. other posts where I loath people who always need to eat as much as prehistorical Dino's)) - Price is way off - Great wines I went to Spiaggia on a Saturday evening, without reservations and quite last-minute. So, to begin with, I was relieved that I had seating opportunity. I had to sit at the bar, but given that I was on my own, that did not matter to me at all. To the contrary, I rather like sitting at a bar when I am alone. I was greeted coldly, yet helpfully.  I was greeted more warmly by the impeccable sommelier behind the Bar. His presence and performance was the pinnacle of the evening (if not the only decent thing). Because I was on my own, and because I didn't want to waste 3 hrs for dinner, I thought I'd take two dishes. First I ordered a veal tartare, followed by a risotto. Let me start by signaling that I entered the restaurant at 7.48 and left, again, at 8.29 (true story!).  My first dish was the veal tartare, accompanied by fava beans and truffled toast (since when Truffles are seasonal at the end of April, I don't know - and no, I do not consider Bianchetti Truffles to be worthy of serving in a Michelin-Starred restaurant). But I shouldn't be too critical either... Although my overall experience at Spiaggia was terrible, this dish was actually very very very good. Yet again, though, I have to come to the conclusion that some (prized) chefs don't understand how to season dishes with paper AND salt. Then on to the risotto. Or was it a soup? I still can't figure it out and it has been a week. Let me start by underlining that between passing the order and serving the plate of risotto, 13 minutes past (I have, indeed, the tendency to always time the serving of a risotto dish everywhere I go and have risotto - it's just one of my tics). Under no circumstance whatsoever can a risotto be prepared under 20 minutes. Unless it has been prepared in advance... well... I guess you will all understand that I will not finish this train of thought here... The risotto was swamped, tasteless and finishes in literally 5 spoonfuls. Again, I am always against ginormous servings of food, and prefer small elegant servings... fit for gastronomic persons and not for beasts... This, however, was beyond reasonableness... And this incredible evening ended with a check for 89 dollars (Just a tartare, and a risotto, and a glass of sparkling water...). I usually don't mind handsome budgeting... And I don't mind paying for exceptional experiences... obviously this did not deliver. Was the food horrendous? No! But that is all you can say about it.",0.9927,0.788,0.138,0.074,0.6117070979335129
2012-04-27,5.0,"I am known among my close friends as the Top Chef Pool Master. For the past 5 or 6 seasons I have been running a pool which now involves a spreadsheet, a point system and a set of rules. Oh yea, it's very complex. While I might not have been a fan of Sarah's behavior on TC, I was rooting for her because she was one of my picks. In the end, I was happy that Paul won but was slightly disappointed that we couldn't bring home another TC victory to Chicago. As you can imagine, I was really excited to get to try Sarah's Top Chef inspired menu upon my first visit to Spiaggia.  The tasting menu consisted of Meyer lemon marinated fluke with uni; hand cut squid ink fettuccine with ruby red shrimp; pumpernickel crusted trout with fennel kraut puree; dashi braised veal cheeks with celery root puree and a hazelnut flour cake with peppermint gelati and cocoa nib streusel.  Everything was wonderful but the best dish of the lot was the crusted trout. I would sell my soul for another serving of that amazing creation. It was hands-down the favorite of the table and Chef Sarah should consider putting this on the regular menu. The fennel kraut puree was wonderful and I practically licked my plate clean. The squid ink fettuccine came in a close second.  Dessert was also fantastic as were the dozen or so assorted gelati and sorbet they brought to our table - with their compliments. The passion fruit sorbet was unbelievable. While I enjoyed the oh-so-decadent raspberry hazelnut flour cake, the shining star for me was the bonus macaron they brought out for us. It's the stuff dessert dreams are made of!  As expected, service was impeccable. They were not pretentious...totally friendly yet totally professional. If you choose to do the tasting menu, the entire table has to do it. We had a couple diners with special dietary restrictions; one non-meat eater (so embarrassing) and one with seafood allergies. Spiaggia accommodated our diners needs without hesitation.  I did not participate in the wine pairing but several in our party did and they quite enjoyed it. I did, however, get in on some cocktail action...their drink menu is not to be missed.  I was a little sad that Chef Sarah was not in the kitchen upon my visit but I imagine she was kicking it with Beverly.

2012-04-23,2.0,"Overrated, indeed....   I asked my fiance to take me here for my birthday and honestly regret it.  Compared to the vast number of fine dining establishments in Chicago, Spiaagia truly comes short.   The evening just started all wrong.  First, we had quite early reservations at 6:30pm.  We walk in and the host tries to seat us next to this wall on the smallest size table they have.  There was a booth open right next to us and I asked if we could have that instead and he said that was reserved for a larger party later.  I also saw other larger tables on the other side of the restaurant with views to the lake, but decided I only get one opportunity to ask for a change in seat.  It is important to note that at this time, ALL the seats (booth and larger tables) were taken up by couples, so it wasn't like I was asking them for a favor.  When you take a step back and look at the restaurant, the seat they put us at was what I call an ""after-thought"" seating.  They were probably like, hey, we can fit another table here, let's do it. After spending a few minutes annoyed, I asked to be moved and they moved us up to seating closer to the bar and entrance of the restaurant, a four-top.  They didn't bother giving us the table next to the window with the view of the lake.  And the booth I requested for in the beginning, well that stayed empty for an hour and a half until they sat someone there.  And in all honesty, they could have seated them at the table they eventually gave us since it was a four-top.  I guess we just weren't special enough to have the booth.  This is a feeling I absolutely hate.  The service was fine.  It took our server a while to get to us, but she was nice, friendly, and enthusiastic, so I appreciated that.  I did notice that they had a lot of the bussers bringing out the meals and they often stumbled over descriptions which I found distracting.   For our appetizers we had the diver scallop w/ mushrooms and parm and the diced raw lamb with apples and olive oil.  These were fine dishes.  The scallops were cooked well and the lamb was obviously high quality.  For our pasta dishes I had the urchin pasta and my fiancee had the cheese filled pasta with lobster, sea beans and caviar.  This was my fiance's favorite dish.  I was however, underwhelmed by my urchin pasta and at one point craved the urchin pasta at Davanti Enoteca on Taylor.  The urchin flavor here was very very subtle and the pasta was all over the place in doneness.  Some were cooked right while others were extremely ""al dente."" Our final dishes were probably the most underwhelming.  I got the pancetta wrapped guinea hen with squash puree and brussels sprouts while my fiance got the prime strip loin.  For what we ordered, the prices were astronomical - $50 for chicken and $52 for prime strip!  There was nothing special about the preparations, they tasted quite standard.  And worst of all, my fiance's steak was overcooked.  He asked for medium rare and got what was almost medium well. I'm so disappointed, and having to write this review, I had to relive what is one of my most disappointing fine dining meals in Chicago.  If you want ""fancy"" Italian, try Davanti Enoteca or better yet, go to Tuscany on Taylor.  After a $500 bill, I really wanted to go to these two restaurants to make up for the disappointing meal I had.",0.9268,0.813,0.108,0.079,0.5382038651004166

Extremely overpriced and in my mind, not worth any meal especially when there are no leftovers, 2. Stuffy atmosphere (dinner jackets required), and  3. Bad service.

2012-03-11,5.0,"We recently celebrated my birthday at Spiaggia and had an amazing time. The meal was basically perfect in every way. The restaurant itself was beautiful and unique, the staff was super friendly and helpful, and each course was more delicious than the last. We started off with a couple drinks while we navigated the menu and the wine list. I was a little intimidated going in because I'm not exactly an expert on Italian wine, but the wine list is extremely descriptive and easy to navigate. I will say that the list was extremely expensive (very few bottles under $200, and I didn't see any below $150). Our server gave us plenty of time to make a decision and was very knowledgeable about all the options. We were on the fence about doing a tasting versus the pre-fixe and ultimately chose to supplement the pre-fixe with a cheese course between entrees and dessert. It was definitely the right call for us. My wife started with the Iberico ham and I chose the roasted vegetables and polenta with a fried egg. The presentation on both courses was amazing. The polenta was crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside, and so much more flavorful than I expected. Next we had the tagliolini with butter, Parmigiano Reggiano and fresh black truffles, and the Amarone risotto with lamb hearts. These two dishes were the stars of the night. Our server mentioned that he felt the best way to taste truffles was in a simple buttered pasta, and after trying the tagliolini I have to agree. It was amazing. I also chose to add fresh shaved truffles to the risotto and it was a good decision. The risotto was far and away the best I ever tasted. I didn't know it was possible to make lamb hearts so tender and flavorful. For our mains we chose the guinea hen and the wood-grilled prime strip loin. Both dishes were perfectly executed and delicious. They were also very generous servings, larger than I expected. The cheese course was also very well-done. The accompaniments included a chili sauce and flavored honey, which were definitely different from the usual figs and bread. The desserts were outstanding as well. I had a ricotta mousse with grapefruit sorbet and various pieces of candied citrus fruits. My wife had an assortment of gelatos which had a texture unlike any I've ever tried. Completely smooth and rich-- this stuff was the real deal, exactly like the gelato in Italy. I really can't say enough about how much we enjoyed our meal at Spiaggia.

Spiaggia gets two stars, not one, because of the phenomenal pasta.  I feel most of my bill went to paying the rent for their extraordinary Michigan Avenue space, not to the food or service.",0.9769,0.808,0.169,0.024,0.5765

2012-01-11,3.0,"Review 35 3.5 Stars Food : 4/5 Service : 4/5 Ambiance : 4/5 Value : 2/5 Consistency : NA (1 visits) Summary We found Spiaggia to be a good, intimate dining experience with good, well executed food and service - however, candidly, we found the prices intimidating enough that it actually impacted the dining experience substantially. We felt that the servings were fairly small and we would have liked to see them to be more generous for the pricing. This is a good place to go if money is no object, however we would not go back as it is overpriced.  Details We dined in the formal dining room as a party of 4. The restaurant's decor is quite intimate yet private and the service was polished and smooth. Note : The 2012 winter menu is not yet online, so I may have a couple of ingredient details missing or incorrect. I'll correct it when I have the proper information. So this is what we had.... Amuse Bouche A nice touch - petite but flavorsome. Antipasti First, was an artful plate of prosciutto, with a earthy yet sweet pumpkin puree, roasted nuts and micro greens. It was very artfully and carefully put together - very delicious and nicely assembled. We just wanted to stare at it, but we got curious and it didn't take long for us to devour it. It was good overall - 7/10. Primi Piatti I had the 'agnolotti del plin con polline di finocchio', which is veal filled pasta with fennel pollen and crispy veal breast. This was 8 pieces of hand-made agnolotti pasta, with a very tasty veal ragu that was fairly delicious. The fennel pollen added a crispy element that also was incredibly delicate. My wife had the potato gnocchi with ricotta sauce and black truffle that she enjoyed. For the pastas we would rate them as 9/10 as far as flavor, but they were just too small.  Secondi Piatti Wood grilled prime strip loin with oxtail, coconut and balsamic. The meat had a lovely crust, while being tender on the inside (asked for medium). The associated elements went together well and had good flavor in many dimensions - every bite was different yet very satisfying. My wife had fish which she said was nice, but she felt it lacked a bit of dimension and preferred the loin dish more. Our other family members felt the meat dishes eclipsed the fish dishes (we had 2 meat and 2 fish dishes). For the meat dishes, around 8/10, for the fish dishes 7/10. Dessert We skipped out of dessert because the bill was looking pretty formidable... Conclusion Certainly a very good, well prepared meal, but the price point is a BIG negative. If price is no object at all then this is a very good option but at ~$150 a head (we had a reasonable bottle of wine) combined with the serving sizes rules it out for me again in future.",0.9974,0.796,0.174,0.03,0.5830333333333334
2012-01-09,2.0,"Like others, I came here prepared to have a fabulous dinner-- and we were being treated by a business acquaintance, so no need to fret about the price..  However like others I was extremely disappointed--particularly with the tiny, tiny portions. With such small portions, it was difficult to even get a real taste of the food. My $26 appetizer had a tablespoon or two of ricotta cheese and a tablespoon or two of squash + what else I can't be sure--swirls on the plate. So you have an artistic plate with hardly any food on it! My pasta dish was ""pasta stuffed with veal and crispy veal breast.."" There were five very little pastas--maybe three inches long and one inch wide with a tiny bit of veal inside. If there was crispy veal breast, I didn't see it. Maybe you need a magnifying glass.  This too was around $27. How can I judge the food when I hardly had any? We'd thought an appetizer and pasta and dessert would suffice. The bread man came around once, but never again.  However, our water glasses were filled the moment we took a sip of water.  I came away feeling that you are supposed to be so awed by the dance of water pourers and waiters who deliver the food in synchrony that you ignore the fact that you've hardly had anything to eat! With dessert (3 scoops of ice cream for $13--the best bargain in the house!) and one bottle of wine, this starvation diet cost over $100 per person. Yes, I'm truly disappointed. If this is the state of haute cuisine, count me out.  For half the price and attitude, you can have wonderful Italian food at Piccolo Sogno or Campagnola (in Evanston).

2012-01-08,2.0,"My husband and I had such high hopes for this dinner, and we were sorely disappointed. Although the antipasti of eggs, polenta, and vegetables was tasty and inventive, the pasta course presented me with undercooked noodles, soggy scallops, and a crab shell (!) in the sauce. My main dish of fluke was simply battered and fried fish. If the skin was removed, it had no flavor at all. The dessert of grapefruit sorbetti was practically my favorite course of the evening. The bottom line: this restaurant's presentation is not in line with the expense. I was shocked when I bit down a crab shell, and it just got worse from there. This was a $50 meal, not $400, and we walked away feeling disappointed and more than a little slighted. We were expecting culinary fireworks and found nothing on our plates that we hadn't tasted before--and better--at other restaurants in town. Sad that Spiaggia didn't live up to the fanfare.

2011-12-31,5.0,"You get what you pay for - and this restaurant is worth every penny you spend. Pricey? Yes. Delicious? Like you wouldn't believe. Quite honestly one of, if not THE, best dining experience I've ever had. The food was superb, the service was top notch from the hostess, servers (even the bread server), bartender and manager. Extremely professional, courteous and knowledgeable.  I sat at the bar to eat since it was just me, and asked the bartender (Brendan) for recommendations. He nailed it with the choice of red wine (their wine list is amazing!) to the app and the main course. I started with the wood grilled scallops as an app. Literally the best scallops I've ever eaten, and I love to eat scallops. The entire presentation of the food, the flavor, the precise cooking, all very impressive. I followed that up with veal stuffed ravioli for main course (it's a 2nd app really, but he got me a main course sized portion.) Incredible! Don't know how else to describe it. See my picture I added to yelp. Gorgeous and delicious veal stock drizzled over it. To die for. Oh, and throughout the meal was an amazing bread service, best ever with a nice selection to choose from and very fresh. In fact everything I tried was very fresh, and a lot of it, like the pasta noodles, made in house. I looked over the dessert menu but couldn't decide from all the great options so just passed. HOWEVER - the bartender was very cool and ordered me some stuff on the house, since it was my first visit. A scoop of rice cake sorbet and pumpkin sorbet, on top a thick raspberry reduction, with a side plate that had a gingerbread wafer, chocolate truffle and cinnamon based orange. My taste buds are still thanking him for that dessert!!! The best.  The ambiance of the whole place is very classy, definitely a more formal dress required (I would wear a suit at least, tie optional) but also very comfortable. I felt relaxed and enjoyed looking around as I waited for my courses to come out. If I have any negatives, it would be that it is maybe a bit slow to get the food out, and is of course pricey (my meal I described, with one glass of wine and dessert free, was just over $100), but I still felt it was worth the wait and the cost. Great place to go if you want a memorable dining experience, or special occasion, or simply want some extremely delicious food.

2011-12-08,4.0,"I was on Michigan Avenue for an errand. Usually, people make impulse purchases on the Magnificent Mile. I made an impulse reservation at Spiaggia.   The amuse bouche was pickled beet with a cheese whose name escapes me. Refreshing and competent; although it felt like a dish more apropos for the summer. Bread service was mediocre. The basil bread was the most successful - the basil added great flavors and aroma. The multigrain was also fragrant and had a nice natural sweetness. Focaccia was odd. It tasted like a normal American roll - didn't look or taste like focaccia at all. The butter was too dense and cold to spread. I had to ask for a dish of olive oil to dip my bread. That was infinitely better. The oil was full-bodied with an understated fruitiness. It was not as bright as what I usually prefer, but it was nuanced and great with bread. The wine list was decidedly Italian. Being not very knowledgeable about Italian grapes, I let the waiter bring out a glass of white. I don't remember which wine he selected, but it was aptly chosen, as it had a subtle hint of tropical fruit without losing body, which went well with my meal. Appetizer was sardine salad. The sardine was nicely cured - pungent but not too salty. The slightly bitter sardine was balanced by the Pugliese burrata cheese. The bed of puntarrelle and radicchio salad provided some textures and lightness; but it reminded me of the Italian mix you get from a bag - not a feeling you want at a fine-dining restaurant. I didn't order a secondo. Instead, I got two primi. First, I had the only risotto on the a la carte menu. The rice itself was beautifully cooked - creamy yet perfectly al dente, albeit slightly salt-heavy. The individual components were well executed - be it the gamy pork terrine, crunchy Brussels sprouts, or the bright grilled Meyer lemon. However, the ingredients were too chunky, crowding out the rice itself. This garish sensibility took away the proper risotto experience. Next, as we were in the middle of Alba truffle season, I got the tajarin off the tasting menu. Tajarin is a Piedmont egg pasta made with white truffle in mind. The rich egg flavor should go well with the truffle. Spiaggia's version was freshly made and hand-cut minutes before cooking. One of the chefs came out with a fist-sized Alba truffle and shaved it in front of me. To my elation, he didn't stint on the truffle. The pasta, however, was not as eggy as I had hoped. In fact, the color of the pasta was almost as white as Chinese la-mian (which doesn't contain egg at all). This was compensated by a rich and creamy fontina sauce, which, while making the pasta too sticky to pick up, paired beautifully with the intensely fragrant truffle. It was a match made in heaven. So even though I would've preferred an eggier tajarin with a simple butter sauce, I could not complain. I got a lemon-lime sorbetto for palate cleanser, and it did its job without much surprise. Then the waiter came out with a cheese plate that I didn't order. I must have looked puzzled, as he explained, ""you mentioned that you were thinking about ordering a cheese plate earlier. So when you didn't, I thought I'd bring it out for you anyway. Complimentary of course."" The three selections were all excellent. The ""Roccolo Valtaleggio"" was especially good - creamy, nutty, luxurious, with a hint of white truffle. Along with two other Piemonte cheeses, this plate was astutely selected to go with my meal, and it was the most successful cheese course I've had. Now the dessert menu was quite similar to the one I saw nearly a year ago, which was not very strong. So it was with reservation I ordered the mascapone torta. This was surprisingly simple and good. The richness of the mascapone was contrasted beautifully with an expresso cream and salted caramel sprinkle. The chocolate shell added texture and acted as a vessel that gave the dessert a manicured look. Mignardises were adequate but felt more obligatory than inspiring.   Decor of the restaurant probably hadn't changed much since it opened in the 80's, and it showed. Thankfully there was the vaulted ceiling and the floor-length window, which afforded a great view of North Michigan Avenue. Service started out professional but sterile and humorless. It warmed up and became more intuitive towards the end. When I asked for a copy of the menu, it came in a Spiaggia tote bag! There was a jacket requirement, and they were more than happy to lend me a jacket for the night.  Spiaggia still offers caliber Italian cuisine.  Its virtue is also its vice - the repertoire is consistent and reliable, but the menu feels stale. The tasting menu seemed more seasonal and better captured haute cuisine of today's Italy, but the truffle tasting menu was prohibitively expensive. If I return in non-truffle-seasons, I'll probably do the tasting.",0.9991,0.808,0.166,0.026,0.5231673534798535
2011-11-27,3.0,"I went to this restaurant with a vegetarian (not vegan) companion, and while it was good, it wasn't so good that I have any particular desire to go back.  My dinner, which was not vegetarian, was generally very tasty, but my companion's was quite boring.  When we made the reservation, we inquired whether the restaurant could accommodate vegetarians, and were assured that it could.  And although there were some vegetarian dishes on the menu, there was not one vegetarian entrée.  I can understand that sort of thing at lower end restaurants, and restaurants based on cuisines that are not vegetarian friendly.  But Spiaggia is an Italian restaurant, a cuisine which is extremely vegetarian friendly.    My companion was brought a lackluster dish of roasted vegetables and polenta, and we both felt that the kitchen was not even trying.   I've seen better vegetarian entrées at steakhouses. Come on Spiaggia, I know you can do better than that! Also, they messed up our dessert service, bringing my companion's desert but my cheese plate-- which I ordered in lieu of dessert-- did not appear for quite a while.  Even after waiting before starting, and watching the gelato start to melt, the dessert was 2/3 eaten before my cheese arrived.  This left my companion (already disappointed over the lame roasted vegetable dish) staring at an empty plate while I savored what admittedly was some of the best cheese I've ever had.  If the food overall had been better, or if we hadn't been paying close to $200/person for the meal, not including the drink tab, I'd have been more willing to overlook this error.  Other than that, however, the wait staff was generally very good at their work.      Nice view from the dining room.  And my pre-dinner cocktail was nicely made if on the large side.

None of the food was bad, although it wasn't all amazing, either.  I had five dishes.  In the order of my preference: Gnocchi with truffles was very delicious, the gnocchi were perfect, the truffle scent was strong and alluring, and the flavors were perfect.  Oysters with mackerel and shrimp, the fish and the shrimp were really nice, and the oysters themselves fresh and perfectly flavored.  One note with the oysters was that one of them wasn't loosened enough to slide off the shell, so I had to loosen it myself with my knife.  Not a huge deal, but seemed odd.  Pork loin and jowl were very tasty, and perfectly cooked.  The jowl (testa) was exceptionally good.  A pasta with oysters dish was nice, although not particularly memorable.  Well-executed and good eating.  And lastly, the cod.  It seemed nicely cooked, although I thought it could have used some additional seasoning as it was rather bland.  It was very dramatically presented, though, with the white fish against a black faux skin.  The faux skin was nice, although it would have been more interesting if it had actually tasted like skin or distinctly like something.  It was nice but, like the pasta, not particularly memorable. So I'm going with four stars on this one.  For their reputation and prices, I'd like to think all the dishes would be memorable.  Great service, well-executed food, but only about half as memorable as I'd expected.

The Frutti di mare was mostly filler fish - shrimp was okay. The best part was the halibut but seemed odd with the other fish in the dish.  The venison dish was good and cooked perfectly.

2011-03-12,5.0,"Spiaggia was delicious.  The ingredients were top notch, the dishes were well-balanced and flavorfull. The first two courses were phenomenal.  We had the scallop dish and the lamb tartare as our first courses.  The scallop was cooked perfectly, it was big, sweet, and fresh and the crispy dewlap and mushrooms complemented it perfectly.  The lamb tartare was surprisingly refreshing, not at all gamy like you might think, the olive oil was beautiful and fruity and fresh.  The second courses we had were the truffle gnocchi, and the sweetbread risotto.  Both were amazing.  The gnocchi were like pillows, the sauce was creamy, rich, and earthy.  The risotto was prepared perfectly, and the sweetbread was pan-fried in a way that kept the outside golden and crisp and the inside tender and delicious. The only possible down-note of the meal were our final courses, they were very good but didn't quite live up to the first two.  We had the seafood bouillabase and the venison.  In the seafood dish, the seafood was delicious and well prepared, but the broth was a little flat and lacked complexity, and the black chickpeas were dry and mealy.  The venison was delicious but undercooked.  The piece of loin was fine being a little underdone, but sausage can be difficult to eat when undercooked. The dessert picked it right back up.  It was like four desserts in one,  We had the flourless chocolate cake.  The cake was delicious and light.  The cookie was crisp and tasty.  The gelato was creamy.  So yummy. The service was great.  The servers were pleasant and refined but still playful.  The service was a little hands-off for us though, it makes sense for a restaurant of this caliber, they let you sit and truly enjoy the food at your own pace.

We were cast off to a hidden table overlooking Michigan and Oak (I think because I am a bit of a Jeff Lebowski type, though I did have the requisite suit jacket on). Hey Michigan and Oak sounds good on it's face, but it was a Friday night, stormy and rainy, the place was still quite empty, it would've been much better to have been seated in the main room, overlooking the restaurant, but I think we were being hidden because of my looks. Oh well. But back to the food. We opted for the 3 course buy in (thank god because the 7 course would have been 250 per person). Fist course, I had a $40 scallop, which was edible. My girlfriend had a beet salad that was as dry and as tasteless as could humanly be made possible. It probably cost 30 bucks also. Next, I ordered a truffle/pasta dish. My girlfriend ordered some brown gravy that laid on the plate as lively as a mud puddle. She commented that it tasted like cat food. We swapped plates and I obliged to spoon it in, just to save face.  The last courses were steak and venison, both so salty that it was laughable at that point. I wanted out ASAP.

As far as the food goes, we were impressed with the sound of both tasting menus (the aged balsamic tasting menu and the truffle tasting menu) but we decided to order a la carte.  I started off with the beets (the mousse was fantastic) which were tasty and then ordered an entree-sized portion of the housemade pasta with butter, parmesan and fresh truffles.  My husband went with the scallops, regular-sized portion of the pasta with butter/parmesan/truffles and the prime ribeye.  Overall, we thought that the dishes were refreshingly simple and extremely well-done.  I never like prime ribeye but had a bite of my husband's and thought it was really delicious. I think that the restaurant warrants a 4 star rating for a couple of reasons: first, the decor is seriously outdated and reeks of the 80s.  It's a bit of a shame because the location can't be beat and the windows overlooking LSD and the lake are pretty spectacular.  I also think that the prices were a little too high.  I have no problem spending money on food but I was a little miffed that the beets cost $25.  I understand the cost of truffles because, well, they're truffles, but beets for $25 is a little ridiculous.

2010-12-31,4.0,"I'd give 4.5 if I could. The only reason I don't give a 5 is that as the night went on, the service fell off.  A friend and I dove into the balsamic tasting menu and ..... oh my god. Each course of this menu featured a different stage of the aging process for Aceto Balsamico.  We started with fresh ricotta, pancetta d""Effino, apple, espresso powder, and saba. Saba is largely unaged (although you may see some that's aged for a couple of years) and is a cooked down must (cooked much longer than aged balsamic) and has this lovely smoky sweetness to it (I've had it with duck confit hash and eggs for breakfast too). Perfect combination of flavors - yum.  Next, we had raw baby garden vegetables with Spiaggia extra virgin olive oil and Condimento Balsamico Agro di Mosto (fermented Saba / second stage of Aceto Balsamico). The cutest, most flavorful little veggies I've seen or eaten. Delightfully simple dish and the Balsamic was nice -- you could taste the development in the Saba.  On to Vandeboom Farm red egg and black pepper cured black cod belly with thyme and Condimento Balsamico San Giacomo (aged approximately 3 years in chestnut and oak barrels). Very refined dish with fresh flavors and perfectly cooked fish. Balsamic was a bit more intense than the last, but did not overpower the rest of the dish. Double-yum.  Then, braised pork filled ravioli, crispy pork dewlap (the skin and meat below the pig's chin - may sound gross, but it was fabulous), caramelized onions, baby green beans and Condimento Balsamico Essenza (aged roughly 8 years in chestnut and oak barrels). Very rich dish, but great texture and flavor, with the Balsamic even more concentration.  Of course, no Italian meal is complete without risotto -- this is hands down THE BEST risotto I've ever had and so simple (I was told), only risotto (Creamy Acquerello), stock, Parmigiano Reggiano (a ton of it) and Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale Aragosta D.O.P. (aged a minimum of 12 years) . Risotto was perfectly al dente and the sharp saltiness of the Reggiano and the tart, sweetness of the Balsamic was literally divine.  One more savory to go ... wood roasted honey lacquered duck breast with red grapes, charred eggplant puree and Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale Argento D.O.P. (aged a minimum of 18 years). By this time, I was getting pretty full, so I didn't eat all of this course. The duck was perfectly cooked and the red grapes were a lovely accompaniment. The Balsamic was even yet more flavorful and almost unctuous.  We finished (and I mean I finished this course) with Italian style doughnuts (yay!!!!!), balsamic zabaglionne, vanilla gelato, Seckel pear, raspberries, white chocolate and Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale Oro D.O.P. (with the ""Oro""/Gold in the name you know this is the stuff). It's aged for a minimum of 25 years. Sounds like too many flavors, but absolutely not; everything went so well with each other and the doughtnuts were perfectly cooked. The Balsamic was so sticky sweet that it paired perfectly with the other elements of the dessert.  An experience to remember. We also ordered an outstanding Gaya wine. This was a girls' trip to Chicago -- after I told my husband about the meal (and the other menu options) we're sure to try it next time we're in town.",0.9986,0.816,0.172,0.011,0.5078735500610498

As I looked out the two story windows, I felt as though I was looking out at a snow globe as the snow was swirling and the lit gazebo in the park across the street was glittering through the swirling white.  I knew we were in for a special night.  We were warmly greeted by the host who took our coats and led us to the bar to enjoy a drink before dinner. The bartender was friendly, offering up a specialty drink list as well as a wine list. And our drinks were perfectly poured when they arrived.  We were seated with a perfect view out the windows at a cozy table. The various menus were explained (there was a truffle 5 course menu, a life of balsamic 5 course menu) as well as their regular seasonal menu offering up a variety of courses. The great thing is that while many restaurants require everyone at the table to order one or the other- Spiaggia will let individuals order what they want . . .and isn't that the way it's supposed to be?  The chef sent out some squid with a potato topping to start which was delicious. I then moved on to my first course which was pancetta wrapped rabbit loin and rabbit sausage. Delicious! And my friend had the sea scallops with caviar. Lovely.  Next up our pasta course. I had the lobster risotto which was perfection on a dish. If this had come as an entree I would have just stopped here because this dish was soooo good. It came with sea beans which I was not familiar with but ended up being a bit like asparagus. My friend had the gnocchi with the black truffle oil. Also good but no match for the lobster.  And this was all just foreplay to the main course! I had the pork loin which was perfect with its perfectly pink interior and delicate flavor. My friend had the black cod which was just a smidge bland for our taste but good with it's crust and squid ink.  Dessert sounded amazing but there was room for only some lemon lime sorbet and some of their homemade complimentary cookies.  The service was impeccable. I love that the servers wear suits that make you feel like you are guests in their home rather eating in a restaurant. And the warm breads that they serve (your choice of 4 different kinds) were worthy of a restaurant of this caliber.  Spiaggia is expensive. Dinner for two with two drinks each (no wine) ran about $370 without tip. So go for a splurge as this is definitely not an every night place. And men . . know before you go that a jacket is required  (try to do better than the guy at the table next to us who chose to wear a leather motorcycle jacket . . . . ) If you drive- be sure to park in the underground garage at the northwest corner of Walton and Michigan Ave (look for the Brite Smile sign) and get your parking ticket validated by your server. Four hours of parking is free if you validate and the best thing is that the elevator in that garage goes right up to the restaurant.  Amazing food. Beautiful view.

I'm normally lenient and round up, but because of the reputation and what I thought would be one of my most memorable meals to date....I'm not giving any freebies! I found the service here to be very warm and helpful, I know some reviewers felt the service was pretentious, but I did not experience that what so ever. They were very accommodating in knowing we had a show time to make, the wine selection they steered me towards was perfect and delicious....just all around the service was impeccable. Moving on to the food....now I am not a person who complains about the price of food or the portion sizes of food to price tag, because come on people if you go somewhere such as spiaggia you know what to expect. If you want those overly large portions and cheap price tags go to Maggiano. I do however expect when I am paying that price for my food to be out of this world and impeccable like the service. This is where my dining experience fell flat. We had one AWFUL dish the Ravioleta(sp?)! It was bitter, dry and disgusting. Take it off your menu....I felt robbed. Moving off the awful and on to the great. The truffle gnocchi, delicious, creamy and amazing. I wish I would have ordered two. My antipasti the beets with pistachio was also out of this world. Everything else was it good, yes, was it perfectly cooked, probably. It didn't however leave me going ""wow"", that was incredible. The menu to me feels like it is a bit stuck in the 90's and is in need of an update. It just felt uninspired and fell short of my expectations. We weren't able to make it to the dessert course as we ran short on time and I can't say that upset me. It was good, yes,but nothing memorable and I can't say I'd go running back, but I wouldn't say I would never go again.

We did receive a baller table, right by the window, so that was a plus. We had two waitresses, although I'm convinced that if I called one of the waitresses a waitress that she would likely punch me in the face.  This woman was ALL business and had the warmth of a glacier.  The other waitress was much nicer, thank goodness. The food was just OK.  I chose Spiaggia because I love love love Italian food and I've read multiple times that Spiaggia serves the best Italian in Chicago.  I now find this incredibly hard to believe. I think Spiaggia serves a tasty over-priced snooty version of Italian food.  We paid $24 for the tiniest plate of spaghetti EVER.  To their credit, the noodle's were homemade, but they were covered in an over-salted mask-up of tomatoes.  I commented to my boyfriend that I could have made the same dish for just $2.  My boyfriend loved his gnocchi but pointed out that at $24 for the plate, he paid $2 for each bit of gnocchi. As our second course my boyfriend ordered the lamb, which he said was the best lamb he's ever had.  Plus for Spiaggia.  I ordered the pork plate and the pork belly was incredible.  Was it worth the price tag?  Doubtful. I was celebrating my 29th birthday but felt like I was at least 11 years to young to be there.  I felt like we paid so much money for the right to be able to go into Spiaggia, and not for the food that was on the table.  While the food was mostly tasty, there was far too little of it to justify the price tag. My review is kind of humorous to me considering Spiaggia is a multiple James Beard award-winning restaurant, but sorry, it just didn't impress me all that much.  Then again, what do I know?",0.9926,0.824,0.147,0.029,0.45904761904761904

What sealed the evening for us was the service.  We walked in looking as though we were ready for TGIFridays, but Management did not turn us away; we did, after all, have American money. At first we were all compelled it sit very upright, whisper and hold our hands in our laps.  Odd.  It was entirely too quiet in there and the man next to us, his hair was entirely too parted down the middle; white socks with black shoes, P.S.  But, as we created a story about said man, our silence turned into quiet laughter and Tyler our server greeted us. They don't have Mich Ultra...  W.T. moment for me, I guess. Joaquin was our bus man; we called him ""Stash"" for the rest of the evening and he seemed to enjoy his new name.  He was attentive and did a fine job clearing the table of dishes and such.  A crumb or dirty dish didn't stand a chance with ""Stash"" at his post. Annette was our bread lady.  Good bread.  We didn't have a nick name for her, but she was the bread lady and didn't miss a beat when I asked her for her name.  ""Annette.  What's yours?""  Aye, Annette, you're a quick one.  She remained Annette and a favorite as we drooled for more bread but left our carb-loading fantasies to our meals. Yes, we all had a first course.  Yes, we shared a second course and of course, we all had a third course.  The veal chop was a Flintstone's moment with that enormous bone protruding; photo opp, of course, but everyone shared the delicate meat and made primal noises over the deliciousness.  Two of us had Halibut and one of us had the steak dish.  Red meat and cheese...Heaven. Throughout the dinner experience, Tyler was very serious about his position, which is probably why he's amazing at his job, but well, I was wearing a tank top and jeans and had to break him.  His nickname was ""Queso Bandito,"" but I will keep the reason to myself.  I will say he did not like his nickname, but I think he lied.  He liked it. He smiled the rest of the night. When it was time for dessert...yeah, we all did, DUH!  We asked ""QB"" what his favorite was; the Torta.  OK, none of us wanted that because we'd just had its trailer park cousin at a work lunch the day before and wanted to get as far removed from that experience as possible.  So, between two other desserts he was asked which of those was his favorite; the Torta.  Ah, the man likes his Torta.  We still didn't order it, but wanting to redeem his moniker, Tyler presented us with the Torta in addition to our desserts AND an amazing after dinner drink which tickled the nose and blew us all away with his professionalism.  He was no longer the ""Queso Bandito;"" he was now ""The Giver.""  Well done, Tyler. Please, take an evening and experience Spiaggia.  Don't be intimidated by the church-like quietness though some probably prefer a nice quiet evening out, I hardly ever do.  Life's to short to be quiet.

I'll save my second point on how Spiaggia keeps it ""real"" towards the end. Now, for all it's decor, awards and friendly people, we still had high expectations on the food.  I would concur with many of the reviews.  The gnocchi here is by far the best I've ever had.  If I could roll in bed with this gnocchi, I would do it in a heart beat.  Even having a tub full of this gnocchi (as disturbing as that might sound), I would dip myself in that stuff and eat away.  It's that good that I'm willing to trade in those disturbing inhibitions.  So yes, I highly recommend ordering the gnocchi. As for the rest of the food, it was delicious and you can't go wrong with their selections.  The only thing ""problem"" we encountered was that we ordered two antipastis and so when it was main course time we were pretty full.   However, this is where Spiaggia keeps it ""real"" for the 2nd time that evening --- we actually asked to box up the food.  I know...in an establishment like Spiaggia why would you do such a thing.  All I can say is that the food was that good that I wanted to eat it later that night and willing to have an eyebrow raised for such a heinous request.  Our server/sommelier was more than happy to do so.  She came back with our food in a small black tote bag with the Spiaggia name on it.  NOT a paper bag, NOT a plastic bag, but in a tote bag.  This bag is pretty sturdy and not some cheap material.  This was a complete surprise, but I believe such attention to detail is why you would be a 5 star review. Now, it was my birthday when we went so not sure if this was a one time thing or if they do this all the time, but if you're going to this place, then it doesn't hurt to try and have your food boxed up and see what kind of bag you get :D If I had all the money in the world, I would come back here any time I had an Italian craving.  However, this is a place that I could only go once in a while.  But its definitely a place I would bring my family and friends for a special occasion or if we needed to really impress our out of town folks.  Until the next time, I will be thinking of that gnocchi while I'm in bed or in the tub.",0.9951,0.843,0.14,0.017,0.5371623503202451

2010-06-03,2.0,"I really, really wanted to like this restaurant. My wife and I have been meaning to go to Spiaggia for some time and we picked our anniversary for our first visit. To give you a little background on us as eaters, we love going out. I proposed to my wife at Le Bernardin in NY and we made a special trip out to California to eat at French Laundry. Some people love to play tennis; we love to eat at nice restaurants. So we came to our dinner excited for an amazing experience and we were left wanting.  Let's start with the good. I ordered the scallop and mushroom antipasti because I had seen a special where it was President Obama's favorite when he's in town. The man is super skinny but he has amazing taste. The scallop was perfectly cooked and paired with a rich, decadent shaving of parmigiano reggiano. It was superb and left me wanting more. My wife wasn't as hungry as I was so she didn't order an antipasti.  Our second course didn't match the expectation set with the scallop. I ordered the truffle gnocchi. I adore truffles and will order just about any menu item with them on it. I've eaten truffle gnochi many times and the one at Spiaggia was really disappointing. Let's start with the size. They charge close to $30 for this dish yet when it comes out it looks like a tasting portion. There was a single shaved piece of black truffle but the taste was incredibly subtle. In my opinion too subtle. If you are going to charge that much for a pasta dish then you have to deliver more. What became a reoccuring theme throughout the evening was that Spiaggia's price didn't match the food. My wife ordered the veal pasta with fellen pollen and crispy veal breast. Again, good pasta, served in microscopic portions. My wife said it best when she said, ""I didn't finish this course and want more."" For this price point and level of restaurant you should be left wanting.  We then moved onto our secondi. My wife ordered the Halibut and it came out overcooked and dry. My wife kept slathering the sauche over the fish to compensate for the dryness of the fish. Halibut should have a nice moist sheen when you dive your fork into it. We've had it hundreds of times and have rarely had it overcooked especially at such a high-end restaurant. She would have sent it back but it would have ruined the flow of the evening so she just finished it.  My secondi was the pork loin. The portion was big and the dish was tasty but it didn't leave me wanting more. The price was more than $40 and I guess if I'm being charged that much I would want more than just adequate. It was tasty food, that was cooked properly but it wasn't special.  Dessert offered a mixed bag. My wife ordered the chocolate cake and she really enjoyed it. It was rich, decadent and totally satisfying. The chocolate was a perfect combo of smooth and rich without being too overpowering. I ordered the three flavors of gelatto. Last year I went to Italy with my wife and we ate gelatto every day, for two weeks in four Italian cities. I've eaten a lot of it and I had high expectations considering that this is the city's finest Italian restaurant. I was incredibly disappointed. The gelatto arrived already in a puddle. They serve it in crispy, pastry shells and the scoops of gelatto were wilting. I dug in and the taste resembled whipped cream. It was too light and the vibrant flavors I was expecting didn't show up. It was a pale imitation of the real thing.  Our bill for the evening without wine or any drinks was around $250. If you are going to charge that much money for food then the expecations are going to be high. Unfortunately, Spiaggia fell woefully short.

Before you go here understand this is a typical Antipasti, 1st Plate, 2nd Plate menu.  Complaints of the portions being too small are results of not ordering correctly.  Selecting a dish from all three sections provides an extremely satisfying amount of food. This place is expensive but not without warrant.  The food is fantastic.  My wife and I both had the scallop antipasti - it was perfectly cooked.  Lots of people have mentioned the gnocchi for good reason.  The veal tenderloin is amazingly flavorful and tender, I highly recommend if you do veal.  I really don't think you can go wrong with anything. The service is top notch.  Steven Alexander, the wine dir/sommelier, is extremely knowledgeable and comforting.  All too often sommeliers at expensive restaurants tend to have an inferiority complex that can make dealing with them less than desirable.  Steve was the opposite, he spent time with us trying to understand our tastes instead of pushing the most expensive bottles.  One of the bottles he recommended was a delicious Quadra.  When I asked if there was any chance of finding a bottle at retail he printed out a card with the name and a local Wine shop that carried it. Bottom line the James Beard nominations and awards are much deserved.  We really hope they win Outstanding Restaurant in '10!",0.9947,0.743,0.22,0.037,0.5289506172839505

It's also worth mentioning that Spiaggia seemed cold and rigid. I like to be in a place where you hear other people enjoying themselves with conversation and laughter, its infectious. There was no indication that anyone was really enjoying themselves. It was like dining with the stepford wives in a library. Very boring and quiet.

We were all very happy with our meal but, if you're ever at this restaurant, order the Gnocchi, the waiter recommended it and I am so grateful he did. It was by far the best dish there. I would come back just to have that again. For dessert I had the Torta a la Mascarpone. It was good but too much. Would have preferred the meal to be a bit bigger and the dessert a bit smaller. Still, definitely a great meal.  One thing that bothered me was the fact that at one point we felt pressured to order. This was a business dinner so, obviously we're going to talk. Yes, I understand the restaurant will need the table for other customers but, for the price we're paying, you'd think they'd be more patient. Don't get me wrong, at no point were they rude and after that I have no complaints, but just a note to take into consideration.

Finally I had the Broken Arrow Ranch venison loin wrapped in venison sausage with Montasio canerdli and Trentino style fennel kraut with Alto Adige speck.

2010-02-16,5.0,"Was very excited to dine here as it's difficult for me to find great Italian food since all I eat at home is authentic Italian. To put it simply, Spaggia blew me away. From start to finish, they did everything the Italian way. Free still or sparkling bottled water, free grissini and free house made breads all made the experience so much better. The truffle gnocchi were to die for. I ordered it a full size and they charged $10 more to make it the same size as a ""Secondi"" dish which I was fine with. For the appetizer I went with the rabbit & polenta..and although it was a lot more modern than my grandma's version, it was so tender and delicious, melting every bite in my mouth. The only thing I have to note is that a lot of their dishes are modernized or made a little different than traditional recipes. For instance, instead of Carpaccio they offered a raw beef tartar, but still served with drizzled olive oil and Parmesan slices. Another example was on their dessert menu, they changed the Tiramisu` to ""Mascarpone coffee tort"" so essentially instead of using lady finger cookies to make the cake, they substituted a tort. People from Italy might not appreciate this but I thought that it was completely appropriate for an Italian restaurant in the U.S. All in all, I liked this restaurant and I liked that they give a unique twist to typical Italian tastes. I tasted Italian flavors with unique presentation. I also met Tony Mantuano but I thought it was so odd how I said Good Evening in Italian and he just repeated it back with an American accent...I wonder if he is second generation Italian then.

The next eight courses, with one exception, only improved on this delightful amuse.  But in Chicago's mass of pan-Asian-molecular-new-American cuisine, Spiaggia stands out because it is so distinctively Italian.  There was a soup course, an antipasti, two pasta courses, two fish courses, a cheese course, and dessert.  The ingredients were a little beyond what you'd find at your local italian place -- think sea urchin and Alaskan king crab in the soup; snapper and cuttlefish with tomatoes and salmoriglio -- but at its core, Spiaggia is a beautiful, romantic Italian restaurant. The only misfire was the second fish course, swordfish rolled with Gulf shrimp and grilled.  This was enjoyable, but simply not up to the high standard; the shrimp was tough, and the lemon leaves added little to the dish.

Additional service issues marring the evening seemed to occur from the moment we stated we weren't wine drinkers - from there on it was as thought our $400 bill didn't matter.  Most notably, while we're on the subject of price, my aunt ordered the crab salad as an appetizer and the lobster spaghetti.  Without explanation Erin simply stated ""I'll make that your main"" and increased the price by $15 without indicating that would be the case.  Next up on the hit list, the incessant reaching across people to fill water (once, lifting the glass and actually managing to spill ~1/8 to 1/4oz of water onto my uovo ravioli.)  Finally, the largest offense was when the waiter behind me elbowed me hard in the back of the head while assisting the other table.  I saw stars, literally, and received and ancillary ""oh, sorry about that"" as condolences.  While ""mistakes"" do happen, it certainly is not like the tables were jammed together. Service issues aside and the fact that communicating this to the restaurant and Chad himself has led to not even an apology - but rather denial, I will state that the food was impressive, albeit pricey. Specific highlights - GNOCCHI DI PATATE IN SALSA DI RICOTTA E TARTUFI NERI Hand rolled potato gnocchi with ricotta sauce with Umbrian black truffles was actually worth the price of admission.  Having tasted and been wowed by Café Spiaggia's gnocchi in the past these pillows of potato were of a similar texture - literally melting in the mouth.  The gravy, additionally, was absolutely transcendent with the creamy and smooth ricotta accenting the sexy essence of the truffles - a truly beautiful dish that is rivaled only by Keller's gnocchi preps at TFL and Bouchon for best all time. GAMBERI ROSSI E POLENTA AL FORNO CON ERBE CIPOLLINA RICCIO DI MARE E CAVAILE Wood-roasted Santa Barbara spot prawns with yellow polenta, sea urchin, Italian Osetra caviar and chives.  While not exactly what I expected from the description this dish was absolutely fantastic - albeit quite petite.  Six medium prawns and three cubes of polenta - polenta blended with creamed uni and fan fried crispy then topped with approximately 30-40 eggs of caviar - once again, flawless execution from a clearly intelligent and ambitious chef. All the above combined with a generalized ""stuck up"" staff who acted as though it was a privilege to eat at Spiaggia left a very poor taste in my mouth - especially when compared to the genuine and truly gracious, friendly, and refined yet (dare I say) casual service at places like Charlie Trotter's and TRU in the past.  This isn't even to mention the following night when I dined at Alinea - a place where it truly is a ""privilege"" to eat and received refined and attentive, yet down to earth service for 4+ hours. All told, Spiaggia has great food and a great view - for some that may be enough.  For myself, I like the service to match the chef's vision and I certainly don't appreciate nickel and dime up charges, snooty pretense, or a stiff elbow.  I also don't like excuses - whether it be from the dining room manager or from customers who act as though somehow Spiaggia's location justifies their prices - I've had better Italian in finer setting for less.",0.9987,0.798,0.155,0.047,0.48614074074074076

2009-07-21,5.0,"Unlike some others reviewing Spiaggia I haven't eaten at more than a few similarly priced / similar quality restaurants. So I cannot say whether it is better than other similar restaurants. I can say that it does deserve to be regarded in the top echelon of restaurants. While at Spiaggia I had their tasting menu. First, to the service. The service was impeccable: quick, helpful, and unobtrusive. Furthermore, when the wine I ordered was out of stock, our waitress upgraded our wine choice free of charge (so instead of the 2006 PIGATO, Bisson, Colline del Genovesato we received the 2006 PIGATO 'Le Russeghine', Bruna, Riviera Ligure di Ponente (we saved $11 on the wine bottle). It is so frustrating when a restaurant is out of something (whether wine or food) so upgrading the wine in this manner is the sort of thing I would expect of a fine restaurant. As to the wine, it was fabulous -- I had never had a Pigato before and I will have it in the future. Now as to the food, I was happy with my food. Every course was excellently put together and tasted good and complete. The use of herbs was appropriate and occasionally inventive. I do have a couple specific comments on two courses: Cold pea soup with Parmigiano Reggiano custard and crispy prosciutto di Parma ---I do not like peas. I first tasted this and thought, ""hmm, peas--this is okay for peas"". By the time I finished this I loved it and wanted more. The crispy prosciutto and the cheese custard definitely enlivened this dish. Creamy organic Acquellero risotto with artichokes, fresh tarragon and grano padano ---This is how risotto should be cooked, slightly al dente. There were artichoke hearts in the risotto and crispy fried artichoke pieces on top. The flavors in this dish came together perfectly.",0.99,0.837,0.145,0.018,0.560858585858586
2009-07-20,5.0,I'm in love.  With Spiaggia.   I will never experience such equisite food on my palate again. Service was amazing. The food was out of this world.  It filled me up but left me feeling light and not overfull. Everything about this place made it a fairytale dining experience. The dungeness crab first course and the squid ink lobster pasta were my favorite two things.  Next time I will have them serve me the pasta course as my main(3rd course).  Apparently you can do this here- I saw someone else across the room do so but from previous reviews it didn't seem possible.   We sat in a little romantic private nook with a view.  Perfect.

2009-04-03,4.0,"Spiaggia is definitely a solid and classy choice for upscale Italian dining in our fair city. Trust me, I pay homage most certainly where it is due.  Which is why I've held off for some time on reviewing this spot since my first visit there didn't do a whole lot to bowl me over... the food was incredibly tasty, but the décor, clientele and overall vibe just came across a bit... well, old. My group was the youngest in there by far - a mix of late twenties and early thirties - and I literally felt the staff almost collectively cringe when we walked in. True, we weren't all clad in Sperry Topsiders, but were there just as any other upscale patron would be; enthusiastic foodies on a mission to spend some hard-earned, young and upwardly mobile dough!  This first experience may have left a slight bad taste in my mouth, even if my sheep's milk ricotta filled ravioli with lamb pancetta, shallots, tomato and mint pesto did not... I was, however, certainly glad to have a crack at a second round via business dinner and (hopefully) prove myself wrong - Spiaggia really is a dining force to be reckoned with and not just a culinary has-been still basking in it's days of yore...  I still stand by my previous statement that the décor is a bit tired... likely better suited for the more 'mature' crowd they seem to draw, I personally prefer a far less conservative atmosphere. The big burgundy leather booths and dark, worn carpet did nothing but help me reminisce about my childhood dinners at Hamburger Hamlet. Eh... at least the menu strongly makes up for what they lack in forward design. And with that said, on to some food!  Tasty, Delicate, Delicious, Flavorful, Phenomenal! These are dishes for a connoisseur of cooking!  Not a bad dish in the house... I've sampled from the regular dining menu and the tasting menu alike, you can't go wrong with either, really. Spiaggia's take on Italian is like nothing I've had previously... to say it's inventive would be a gross understatement. For example... why have a basic caesar salad when you can delight your senses with a warm salad of cardoons, salsify, and baby leeks with creamy fontina, quail egg and crispy focaccia. See what I mean?! Thinking you'll go for a nice plate of spaghetti and meatballs? Not when you can devour hand rolled potato gnocchi with ricotta sauce and Umbrian black truffle -or- hand crafted garganelli with San Marzano tomatoes, Pantellerese capers and house cured sardines... you really would be a meatball to pass up these delectable morsels... Uh Oh.  Sorry... I needed to take a break and wipe my keyboard from all that drool...  I'm back in fighting form now! Trust me, your expectations for dining well here should be met 20x over... I, for one, know their orange blossom honey lacquered duck breast with duck sausage, rapini and creamy yellow polenta is nothing short of sensational... crispy, sweet, velvety, savory and melt-in-your-mouth fabulous, I can't say enough about the perfection of this dish.  Desserts like warm chocolate-filled crepes and lemon panna cotta with polenta cookie and Meyer lemon vodka really round out the menu with simplicity, delicacy and class... it's hard not to be amazed at the conclusion of a meal like this, almost makes slightly haughty staff totally dismissible, doesn't it?  Spiaggia will never be my chosen destination to reveal a new gorgeous dress in a fabulously chic setting, but it will be my go-to for the best Italian, make-your-mouth-water dishes outside of Tuscany.

Next I had the veal angliotti, which are little envelopes of veal in a spectacular sauce. Simple and amazing. Next, I had the duck.

The next course I had was a beautifully presented beef tartare dish. My husband had the rabbit as a beginning course, which was also delicious. The most memorable part of the meal was the gnocchi. My first bite was simply the most incredible taste-- the gnocchi was hand-rolled, fluffy, melted in my mouth, and the sauce was rich and velvety with drizzled truffle oil. I savored every bite. My entree was a seared royale dorade fish, simply cooked but there was something so rustic and familiar about it-- it reminded me of the way my mom used to fry up fish and crisp up the delicate skin, with melt-in-your-mouth meat.

The waitress even took one of my dining companion's plates while I was still eating; unreal. Second, the risotto was raw. We had an 8:30 reservation. I suspect that they ran out and couldn't complete the dish in time for us. I don't have any other speculation. I couldn't believe they actually served it. I would have been happier had they come out and said ""We ran out of the risotto"". I know how long it takes to cook risotto properly. That dish should never have been served.

One can carry the meal, but you pray for both.  Here, the menu is overwhelming and as my boyfriend and I looked over our options (an a la carte menu as well as two different tasting menus, not to mention a very pricey wine list) we were struggling to decide on any one item.  So we went for the whole shebang...the grand tasting menu which was featuring DOP specialties.  Our cast of servers (this is definitely a team concept restaurant) were incredibly helpful. When Blake decided against a bottle of wine and went for cocktails, the server brought me out tastes not only from their wines by the glass list but also from their open bottles for the tasting menu - showing me the bottle for each and describing them appropriately.  Each course came out well timed and its story told as it was set before us.  While I admit that I was impressed by only a portion of the items on the tasting menu (definitely try the beef deckle), we went about it the right way.  We even stopped mid coursing to order off the a la carte menu when we saw the most delicious plate of homemade gnocchi with ricotta cheese sauce, black truffles, and black truffle oil set down at the table next to us (by the way - YOU HAVE TO ORDER THIS).  At the end of the meal, the server thanked us for celebrating and poured us complimentary muscato d'asti (I had ordered it and he brought us both a glass on the house which he refilled mid-dessert).  To top the evening off, a jewelry box filled with bite size bits of heavenly desserts left us full to the brim.  Admittedly, I don't think we'll go back anytime soon - but only because we have so many others to check off our list.  This is definitely a special occasion place and you will leave feeling nothing less than VERY well taken care of.",0.9967,0.805,0.177,0.018,0.5500226757369615
