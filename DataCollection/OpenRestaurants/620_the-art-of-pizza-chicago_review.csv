Unfortunately the night before we'd had Lou malnattis so this one fell short for my taste.  Service: Place wasnt full so we got a table and our food very fast.

2017-05-19,5.0,"THANK YOU ART OF PIZZA. Before you, I had lost my faith in the holy mecca that is deep dish pizza. Every single place had been a disappointment and the deep dish I imagined in my mind was nowhere to be found. But good fortune favors the persistent - I stumbled upon you (ie: bookmarked you on Yelp). First, I love that you can buy deep dish by the slice. For $4, you have the option of going with just 1 other person and not have to argue over which toppings you want (you can even bring that vegetarian friend!). The options are pretty solid: meat lovers, sausage, pepperoni, cheese, mushroom + sausage, mushroom + veggies. The slices are kept warm so no wait required, unlike when you order it by the pie and have to wait 40 minutes for it to cook. Second, the pizza is actually really good. The cross section shows a beautiful layer of ingredients in their perfect proportions. I got pepperoni and meat lover's. I preferred the pepperoni because I realized that the bacon + sausage in meat lover's was just too heavy for me to enjoy in deep dish. The tomato sauce on top was just amazeballs. Towards the end of the 2 slices, despite my overwhelming fullness, I found myself still scraping up the leftover sauce on the plate with each and every bite. I liked the crust here much better than other deep dish joints as well. It's not too thick that it's overpowering the main attractions, while at the same not too thin that the sauce and cheese on top can't hold together.  Seriously - my only complaint (surprise surprise) is that the slices could be served a tad bit hotter. I get that they want to keep it warm so that it's ready to eat ASAP, but by the time I finish my 2 slices, the cheese was starting to get cold and that's no bueno.  I really appreciate what they've done here. Differentiating themselves from the typical Chicago deep dish joint through its fast food vibe, they're really catering to a loyal and local crowd. As long as they keep up the quality ingredients, respectable ratio of crust to sauce/topping, and no-nonsense approach, I will be back!",0.9865,0.824,0.148,0.029,0.4747720364741641

Since it was a Tuesday, their special was a meatball sub for only $3.99!! I was so excited because I love a good meatball sub.

2017-02-04,3.0,"Overly hyped. Not bad but definitely not great.  In a nutshell: Sauce is nothing special, dough is good but too much of it which the raw portion throws off the flavors of the rest of the pizza, the cheese isn't bad.  It's overall lacking something, doesn't have much depth in flavor.  Maybe it's the salt in the dough that is needed or possibly the sauce lacks in flavor but ultimately the dough should be a slight bit thinner and be more cooked.. Really not a top choice for stuffed pizza and the high ratings are probably keeping them from ever making better changes to the pizza recipes. Really,  really,  nothing special but the portion size and they don't lack in cheese.  A well made deep or stuffed pizza always is when it's we'll balanced and this one just misses that mark. Definitely not a place to recommend to people who haven't had Chicago stuffed pizza or really to anyone at all.  It's more of a place to try if you just want to really get it out of the way and know what it taste like...  That's about it.",-0.4926,0.785,0.1,0.115,0.4736693741041566

2016-11-07,5.0,"I'm sure my review is not very useful as by now basically everyone (1000+ reviews already) knows how good Art of Pizza is, but I'm going to tell you about it anyways. First things first, pizza by the slice, a concept that has existed since soon after the pizza itself was invented but for some reason not implemented into the deep dish game for years. Art of Pizza does this and it is (as of 11/3/2016) $4.35 for a slice of deep dish, regardless of toppings! They usually have about 5-6 different types of deep dish (which they call stuffed and there is a minor difference but we won't get into that now) as well as all their thin slice stuff. The slice itself is a work of art, probably why they went with the name. The ingredients are quality and it's tasty from top to bottom. A good sign for deep dish is if you don't mind eating the crust, it's a lot of carbs but its tasty and not dry. I plan on returning here for many years to come, it's even the official pizza of my fantasy football league's draft party. Pro Tip: Red Hot Ranch is only 5 buildings north of here and sometimes I do what I call a ""Chicago Special"" where I get a hot dog from there and a slice of deep dish from here. RHR has a good dog, it isn't a true Chicago style but it's damn close.",0.9347,0.873,0.093,0.033,0.5068070818070818

2016-10-06,5.0,"Hands down the best deep dish in the city of Chicago. I have been eating their 'za for years and I'm a true advocate of AoP! I'm all about supporting the little guys, and even though they're not small on taste, they're not a big chain! For me, that's an added bonus. I have ordered from them many times and have grabbed slices to go (a great deal when you only want one slice of deep dish - and trust me, it's enough!). I have only dined in once, but if you want your pizza piping hot and fresh out of the oven, that's the way to go. The sauce is the perfect consistency, not watery and generously slathered on the pies. The cheese is always my favorite part though. So gooey and delicious. I often just have the plain cheese pizza. But a friendly warning: deep dish is NOT for the lactose intolerant - unless you armed with tons of Lactaid, of course :-) The speciality pizzas are good. I get the veggie all the time, when I want something to top off my cheesy goodness. You can also build your own so the possibilities are endless. They cost just about as much as the other chains, but the taste is where it really counts and it's worth every penny.  I've had Lou's (my go-to chain), Gino's, Giordano's, Pizano's, Pequod's, hell even Little Caesar's, Papa John's, Domino's and Pizza Hut.

I'd give the thin crust 3 stars, but rating overall a 4 because of the selection and by-the-slice convenience. There is nothing special about the inside of this place. You can tell it is more geared toward walk-ins. The thin crust pizza was substantial in size and thickness with toppings. The crust was cooked perfectly crispy. The toppings were generous, which were covered with each bite. The first slice I had was underwhelming at first, but I enjoyed it more as I got toward the center. I concluded that it was that I was able to get more sauce on the slices, which the sauce was a smooth blend and not too runny. The sausage was a bit bland and under seasoned, but pepperoni saltiness added a nice kick to tie everything together. The overall taste was good, but nothing that stood out to me. I'll update once I try their famous deepdish. With that being said, they have a ton of different toppings on 3 different styles (stuffed, pan, and thin) ready by the slice when you walk in.

It only took 30 minutes and the roads were in good shape. I can respect it since being tourist and lugging all of my luggage, the commute was actually pretty nice.  Going inside, the service was amazing. The front guy explained the difference between pan and stuffed (stuffed is the one you want to get FYI) and helped me choose the right volume of food.  I got the 10' stuffed pizza (half pepperoni, half spinach). AND it only counts as 1 topping. Each additional topping is $1.95 extra. Choose wisely. I also got for apps: fried calamari, and garlic bread. The garlic bread was super garlicky and awesome. The calamari, I originally thought were onion rings because it literally had no flavor. It tasted like fried oil. However that's not what this review is about. It is about the deep dish pizza! Sauce was rosy red and just the right sweetness and acidity. Cheese was super gooey and tasted so fresh! I was very impressed by the execution of the pizza.  P.S. If you need WiFi, just ask for it. They'll hook you up.

2016-04-14,5.0,"Deep dish pizza is my favorite and the only pizza worthy of recognition in my book - Sorry, New York!  I've been here at least 20 times and I have only gotten the single slices so I cannot speak about the rest of the menu. Ordering a single slice is great because you don't have to live with the guilt of eating an entire deep dish pizza over the course of two days in the case that they didn't offer slices. There aren't many places which offer deep dish pizza by the slice and that is why I find myself sometimes going out of my way to come here if I have a craving.  I've tried most of the deep dish offerings here and they're all equally delicious. They have a veggie delight option for vegetarians & a meat lovers slice as well (highly recommend it!). I absolutely love the fact that they don't skimp on toppings - every slice is absolutely loaded. They also load on the cheese and each slice is gloriously ooey gooey with cheese! The crust is good too. Once or twice I had a slice with slightly soggy crust but I don't believe that warrants a lesser star rating because it was truly a one off situation. The only downside is that their parking lot is super tiny.  PS- I just wanted to address a few reviewers who said that they had to wait over an hour for a pizza delivery  - dude, this isn't New York. A quality deep dish bakes from 40-60 minutes, depending on the toppings. So expecting a pan pizza at your door within an hour is ABSURD. If you're famished or tight on time, order something else!

A number of other places I don't even both eating the back of the crust cuz it's just bread, but for Art, it's a bit thinner and so you get plenty of pizza with every bite of the back of the crust. Plenty of toppings. Too many deep dish places load you up with cheese (Lou's) or fluffy crust (Pequods). Not Art. Art of Pizza gives you massive amounts of whatever you order. My favorite is Art's meaty delight and that thing is stuffed with meat, topped with cheese and then loaded with even more meat. Layered on top is a sauce which is maybe a bit salty but so damn good. For Art's meaty delight, they then throw a bit of extra bacon back on top of the sauce. For me, Giordano's had always been my favorite deep dish. Art of Pizza is on par if not better.

When I called in the order, they informed me that they deliver downtown, but that I would have to meet them in the lobby. I said since I'm ordering so much food, can they not bring it upstairs? The guy who was taking the order said they the issue is with finding parking downtown while making the deliveries, so I said that they can just use the loading dock in the back, and that should eliminate the problem. I even offered to pay just so they could bring up the food. The guy then says, well, if there's a loading dock, then there shouldn't be a problem.  Well, day of the delivery, the security calls me downstairs at 11:15 to let me know that the pizza guy is downstairs.

Sorry man, I would have tipped you like $40 or something, but since you're making me carry pizza, I don't think you deserve a tip at all, when my security lady had suggested you use the freaking loading dock so I didn't have to carry all that damn pizza! Called Art of Pizza to complain and talked to Oscar, the manager, who said he talked to the owner, Arty, who said he was there the Monday that I put in the order and that he never lets people go upstairs on downtown deliveries. THEN WHY THE HECK DID SOMEONE TELL ME THEY WOULD?? If I had known, I would have gone with Lou Malnati's like I always do-- better pizza at Lou's anyway!. Thanks for insinuating that I lied about someone telling me that they would come upstairs to make the delivery. Why not just take responsibility and admit that someone misinformed me? Oh, also two of my coworkers got food poisoning after eating their deep dish meaty special, and spent the whole night puking. The vegetarian pizza has no flavor and is gross. I do have to say that the cheese deep dish is pretty cheesy and saucy, just how I like it though. And the garlic bread goes great with pizza sauce (that you have to request).

Short scoop: The bf and I just moved to Logan Square, he loves pizza, and he raves about Art of Pizza. We had planned a Friday night eating pizza, and I was ready to try Art of Pizza at last. We had two options because we are dog owners. Walk our dogs, and have Art of Pizza delivered, or drive to the dog park and pick up the pizza if they didn't deliver to our address. SO I called to check our address and see if they deliver. I don't care if I have to go pick it up...I'd just change my plans (I wanted to try this place of all places in Chicago). Gave my address and told them we lived in Logan Square, and was told they delivered there. I said great and I'd call back with an order after I checked out the menu online. Called back 10 minutes later, put an order in, told them it would be 75 minutes. Great, I don't care, I have to walk these damn athletic dogs anyway. Left for walk... 45 minutes later got a call from Art of Pizza... ""Sorry, we don't deliver to your address."" ??? Huh? Well thanks for letting me know now, after I'm sure our pizza and appetizer is about done and ready to go. An hour ago, we would have decided to pick it up or go somewhere else. AND they still charged us, so the boyfriend has to call and get a refund...you'd think they would cancel your payment.  Basically, as someone who has worked in restaurant/bar industry for years, I can understand mistakes are made, but a) know your delivery area and b) make it right if you screw up. You'd think they could have just delivered the damn order since they committed and took forever to figure it out, just tossed the delivery driver a few extra for going further and making the mistake, and let us know they made a mistake and couldn't deliver there in the future.  But alas...I don't know if I'll want to try it in the future. I'm not one to hold a grudge more a couple months, so we'll see.",0.4735,0.881,0.066,0.053,0.3939649470899471

I know it sounds bad starting off, it really wasn't bad.  I did enjoy my lunch, but I was in the mood for the best pizza in town.  Yeah, the best pizza in Chicago, does that exist?  I wanted to order a pizza fresh but the wait on it would have been 45 minutes(because I wanted stuffed pizza, duh) and the other two weren't willing to wait that long.  So we ordered the pre-made-and-sitting-for-god-knows-how-long-pizza-by-the-slice.  I tried two pieces, one was basically a meat lovers(beef, bacon, sausage, pepperoni) and the other was a spinach and mushroom stuffed pie.  The spinach and mushroom one was pretty good but the dough tasted old and I couldn't get over it.  I was so disappointed from the moment I had to order it by the slice.  The meat one was not good at all, the one meat that shined through to my taste buds was the hamburger and oh my god that was awful.  I know it's my fault for ordering it but who wants that crap on a pizza anyways?   It really wasn't good enough for me to ever want to go back.  I will one day find a spot in Chicago on one of my visits that I dub the king of pizza in the windy city.  I bet the locals won't take too kindly to that.",0.9576,0.772,0.143,0.085,0.5009523809523809

First of all, they don't have Chicago deep dish pizza.  I don't know why people don't get it.  There's Chicago Deep Dish (like uno's, lou's, gino's), then there's Stuffed (like Giordanos), then there's pan, thin, etc.  The thick stuff at Arts is stuffed, NOT Chicago deep dish.  Whew... well glad to get that out of my system. Now, as it pertains to stuffed pizzas... the thing is stuffed pizza is good when it's fresh.  That's true for most pizzas including deep dish, for that matter.  I think New York style pizza is probably the only kind that can really work even after it's been sitting around for a while.  So the crust of the pizza was completely soggy.  The sauce, cheese, and toppings were all fine, but I just can't rate a pizza good if there's no substance. I also tried a slice of thin crust cheese.  The thing that makes New York thin crust edible is they have it sitting out and all, just like Arts, but when you ask for it, they throw it in the oven for a couple minutes and the reheating process makes all the different.  By the way, this is not to say Art's thin crust is New York thin crust.  My point was more of the reheating thing.  They don't do it... you order and they just plop the heat lamped pizza into your plate.  As expected, but pizza had no... ""life"".  Really just ""meh"". Now, the only reason I give Art's 2 stars instead of 1 is the format.  I mean, getting pizza by the slice at an OK price is one potential silver lining.  Still, if you think about value that can be had at pizza-slice places... it's probably not that great.  Anyway, it's not common in Chicago, so people might appreciate that aspect of it. I makes me wonder that maybe if we had ordered a whole pie, maybe we would've had a different experience.  Well... maybe another time.",0.9677,0.885,0.095,0.02,0.5685236511456023

Art special was flavorful and I loved the mushrooms. The Hawaiian pizza had huge chunks of pineapple and Canadian bacon was a wonderful touch.

The pizza is not bad, but... it tastes EXACTLY like Giordano's.  If there is a difference in the sauce, it's indiscernible to the pallet.  They may use a handful more cheese.  bread and cheese.  That's their pizza.  I'm not a big fan of Giordano's, so I can't be a fan of Art of Pizza.  Leaves me with an ambiguous disinterest in a return trip.

Me and my fiancee get deep dish from here all the time since it's by far the best in our area, and never once have we been disappointed. All of the veggies and ""toppings"" taste so fresh, it's always hot, and we seldom have much trouble getting in and out. I typically get a slice of the veggie and it is more than enough to fill me up. Definitely not the kind of thing I should eat every day...but if I could I would.  Service is seat yourself, you order up at the counter so no need to worry about a gratuity. Pizza comes out FAST, its pretty much ready to order, though if you order a specialty pie it takes longer. The one time we placed a larger order for a few deep-dish pies for a get together we were having the wait was pretty significant...in the 40+ minute range, but that seems to be the standard at a lot of deep dish places here.

I have travelled the world over, had pizza on different continents and across the USA, this is, hands down, no question, the best pizza I have ever had! My daughters and their friend who was with us, exclaimed that this is also the best pizza they have ever had. My daughter's friend actually works at a pizza restaurant and said nothing they serve compares to this, she was right, this is spectacular pizza. I am not prone to writing reviews or being wildly enthusiastic about food, but, my gosh, this was simply an incredible pizza! We ordered ahead of time and ate it there before the game. The only two negatives I can think of, if you can call them negatives, was they serve no beer, it is BYOB. Secondly, the dining area is rather pedestrian and plain. There is nothing fancy about the place, but, the pizza is the focus and the pizza is way worth the small ""negatives"" mentioned. We had sausage/canadian bacon/pineapple and the cheese was abundant, the sauce was wonderfully tasty with just enough spices and garlic to enhance the toppings, the crust was thick and crispy on the bottom, yet cooked through lightly to provide the perfect bed for the toppings. All I can say is if you like Chicago style pizza, you simply must try their offering. I have had all the others, the big names included, this was far and away the best pizza I have ever had.

2013-06-03,2.0,"Bullshit.  I drove from NJ to St. Paul MN on a strict schedule. The schedule included up to 2 hours for lunch in Chicago. After very extensive research I decided Art of Pizza would be Chicago's representative. My girlfriend and I walk in and the place is far from anything special. I look behind the counter and the pizza is all being kept in some hot food racks....similar to how they keep that wack ass 711 pizza warm. School lunch style heat ya know. I like my food heated by almost anything other than a light bulb. The only thing that could mess up a slice more is microwaving it. I think to myself ""good thing I'm ordering a pie""....or so I thought. We walk up to the counter and I say: ""Can I get a large ""stuffed"" plain pie"" (stuffed pie was deep dish Chicago style with a top dough and another layer of sauce. My girl and I love sauce) Counter Guy :-0 (jaw drops) Me : ""Whats up?"" Counter Guy : ""That takes a hour"" Me: ""That's fine"" Counter Guy ""Literally an entire hour you'll be waiting a long time. You should really just get slices"" (after I told him I wanted a pie he instantly got pissed and the rest of the conversation went on with a ton of attitude) Me : ""So can u not do a pie"" Counter Guy : ""We can eventually but it'll take a while before we make it then takes a hour to cook"" Me: ""Just give me 4 slices"" He takes the slices out of the heating lamp area and hands me them. Room temp at best. I do understand why you can not head up a slice like this in a traditional pizza oven as all the cheese would melt out and be a mess. Instead it was hard cold cheese in the middle like a day old mozz. stick. Just make the f'ing pie next time. It was OK at best with flavor. Horrible as far as having a hot FRESH slice.The only reason I put up with such BS was that neither my girlfriend or I have smart phones so we did not know where to go instead. I don't know if it was just this this guy being a douche or if this was the infamous Chicago rudeness I've heard about.

The key to truly great pizza, in my opinion, is the sauce and The Art of Pizza has very good sauce.  The next key element in a great pizza is the crust, which The Art of Pizza nails (although in this particular category, Pequod's takes the cake).  The remaining ingredients (meats, cheeses and veggies) are always fresh and plentiful.  I typically order the Art's Special (sausage, onion, mushroom green pepper) but have also ordered the Meaty Delight and Vegetarian on multiple occasions and have never had a bad experience. Deep dish pizza is somewhat expensive compared to other kinds, especially if it's being delivered, but in all seriousness, an XL pie will feed you for a week.  After eating the same pizza for a week straight, I definitely need a break but when I get another craving for deep dish a couple months later, I always come back to The Art of Pizza.",0.9894,0.766,0.167,0.067,0.5388898809523809

They showed up 15 minutes later than their prediction (so and hour and fifteen after I ordered), no biggie. Pizza was hot. I was excited. But the sauce is so-so, the cheese isn't flavorful, the onions were strange, and the garlic was barely detectable. Spinach in pizza is always perfect.

As a 'by the way,' this review is solely based on take-out/delivery orders of their stuffed pizza so I cannot comment on atmosphere or their thin/pan options. The box was hefty to say the least (""What is IN here?!""). I was asked to hold the box and tried not to think about the sheer weight of it (""Am I really about to consume this...?""). The dough is super thick and the crust is huuuge and arguably my favorite part of the piece. Sauce was classic tomato, not chunky, no too sweet. I really enjoyed it. Toppings were plentiful and now that I've had a small variety of their offerings, I definitely have my favorites. Tommy R. and David L. like to keep it simple, spinach and onion. Great combo for AOP, definitely recommend, but I typically like a couple more items in there.

The 3.75 per slice price is reasonable, but I imagine that it's a better deal if you pick up a deep-dish slice with piles of toppings. A slice like that could feed a family, probably, with enough crust left over to feed a family of pigeons. Which sounds like the premise of a Pixar short. Actually, now that I think about it, the name ""The Art of Pizza"" sounds less like a DTV action-comedy and more like a Pixar short.  The pepperoni's were a little spicy for my taste, but when it comes to spiciness, my taste cannot be trusted at all. I'm Irish. 400 years of eating potatoes have devolved our taste buds in to sensitive little flowers.

I am a pizza LOVER (and saying that is an understatement), and out of every Chicago pizza place I've been to  the Art of Pizza is definitely top 5. Not only do they have slices, which is perfect when I do not have time to wait or don't want a whole pizza, they also have three different types of pizza: deep dish, thin crust, and pan. The pan is my favorite because it is cheesy without too much sauce. The dough is also great. I have had all three types, but the pan seems to win out every time. The pepperoni is seasoned with spices so it tastes extra delicious. Too bad I gave up eating red meat a month ago :( Sometimes during busy hours the selection of slices is sub-par, but usually there is always a pizza getting ready to come out of the oven so I've never had any real problems in this department. I am always willing to wait an extra 5-10 minutes for a piping hot slice! They also have a large selection of appetizers and pastas, so there is always something for everybody. The daily specials are great if you live in the area and are looking for a cheap pasta meal.

2012-02-09,1.0,"Where do I start off!  I am not sure who paid off the Chicago Tribune food critics to vote the Art of Pizza the #1 Deep Dish Pizza in Chicago. I was really excited to try them and see how they stand up to the best.   Deep dish pizza has pretty much been like a food group in my family for my 39 years and we have a restaurant history in our family.    People... deep dish pizza does not have a soggy doughy thick bread crust!  On my first attempt I stopped at their Ashland store in the afternoon for a slice of sausage.  I asked the guy at the counter how long the pizza has been sitting and he said it just came out.  Great...!  I know pizza does not sit well so I knew I would be getting a good representation of their deep dish.  First of all they call their deep dish pizza stuffed pizza.   It looks like a deep dish should but they put cheese on the bottom of the pizza and a layer of cheese above the ingredients followed by their sauce.  What they were calling"" deep dish or pan pizza""  is a much thinner version which does not resemble deep dish.  True Chicago deep dish pizza has  crunchy crust on bottom followed by a thick layer of creamy mozzarella followed by veggies,sausage, ingredients etc... followed by a nice generous layer of tomato sauce followed by a sprinkling of Parmesan.   Anyways, the guy said the stuffed pizza is the one they are famous for.   I sat down and began to cut into my pizza with my knive.  it was like cutting through doughy soggy bread.  Deep dish crust is supposed to have a more dense almost pastry like dough crunch to it with rich flavor.  This was pure mush!...I took a bite and the dough was absolute flavorlous.  It had absolutely no memorable characteristics that deep dish dough should have.  The sauce had a very funny taste to it ...I could tase oregano and garlic but there was something else in it which I didnt like.  Possibly cheap tomatoes made it taste funny.  Their pizza lacked enough tomato sauce and cheese.  Deep dish should have a thick creamy stretchy mozzarella cheese running out of it.  The sausage and cheese lacked flavor and they didn't put very much on the pizza.   I have to say I was completely disappointed.  The cheap price they are charging for a slice reflects the pizzas quality.  It is a filling pizza because the pizza is all bread. Ok I happened to  be driving by with my mom who also loves deep dish and I said let's give it a second try maybe I just got a bad pizza the first time and I also wanted her opinion.  We ordered a slice of deep dish with veggies and sausage and a slice of thin crust sausage.  Nope!  she also agreed it did not even resemble the good characteristics a deep dish pizza should have... and yes the crust was a soggy doughy thick bread again!!  The thin crust used the same crust as the deep dish and was disgusting.  We couldn't even finish half of the two slices they were that bad. There are only a handful of really good pizza places in the City of Chicago and this one is not one of them!!...I repeat....does not fall in to that category. I don't know how the reviewers could give this place high ratings if they have ever tried and compared it  to good deep dish pizza like Pizano's,  Peaquod's and Gino's East  makes.  Yes the prices for all their food are really cheap..!!!  But you get what you pay for.   Unless you are a poor student on a budget looking for filler..Stay away!!!!",0.992,0.825,0.119,0.057,0.5485489220563847

I will preface my review with the caveat that I, at the recommendation of a good friend, ordered a slice of whatever had most recently come out of the oven. It WAS really really good, but I have a feeling that the quality drops as the pieces and pies sit awaiting purchase. I had a slice of spinach, mushroom, and onion deep dish that just tasted right. It very much reminded me of a lasagna that my mother makes not so much in the ingredients and individual textures but in how eatable it was. While I normally find most deep dish to some undesirable trait like bitterness or being overly sweet or saucy, here, the pizza was gentle, full of flavors, and easy to eat. None of the ingredients were too strong. It didn't feel like any one part of the pizza was fighting for dominance of my palate. I didn't suddenly get a mouth-full of spinach or mushroom. Nothing seemed to be masking some aspect of the piece. Although not overbearing, the individual flavors came out - particularly the onion. It had that great, full taste that only onion can give hitting the perfect spot between undercooked and caramelized. Not being loaded with the onions, it was a nice surprise whenever I arrived at one. I'm not a fan of slices of pizza too difficult to eat. You shouldn't have to struggle to enjoy a piece whether it's too oily or poorly cooked or so thick and heavy (in the case of deep dish) that you tire after just a few. This is where the pizza here shines. It's significant enough to have weight and heft. It'll fill you up, but it won't tire you out. For me, that's probably the most important part. It was just a pleasure to find a deep dish slice which didn't fall apart offering just enough resistance to remind me that I was eating something but also fluffy and light enough to make me want another just as soon as I finished.",0.9936,0.779,0.169,0.052,0.5605952380952381

The butter crust isn't as sweet or rich as some and has delightfully crunchy edges. Shame about the soggy bottom, this was a good pizza. It's better to order the whole pizza (they deliver) or go earlier in the day when the pizza hasn't been sitting around as long.",0.9784,0.797,0.158,0.045,0.5550095238095238

So when we moved in together at the end of February and didn't feel like cooking, I suggested we order from Art of Pizza. I had to cajole (love that word) and convince him that while we weren't getting deep dish, it was still a damn good pizza. We ultimately compromised and got a pan pizza. Fast forward five months later... whenever I suggest pizza and it's his turn to pick a (ridiculously heavy) pizza, he usually chooses this place. The sauce isn't too sweet, the crust is always just crispy enough, there's always a mountain of ingredients and plenty of cheese to hold it all together.

Two pizzas, one thin crust and another deep dish, came to the house. I knew that something special had arrived when I saw that the pizza was wrapped in tin foil (just like it should be).

2011-07-31,5.0,"Everyone who knows me knows that I love pizza. Therefore it was hard for me to admit to my friends that I didn't have a favorite Chicago style pizza place while on a recent trip to the windy city. The truth is that as many times as I have been in Chicago, I have had very few experiences with the city's pizza. Fortunately we had an extra afternoon on this visit so one of my native Chicago friends offered to take us to his favorite pizza place in the city, The Art of Pizza. This restaurant isn't a fancy sit down place that I had imagined most places serving this type of pizza would be, instead we ordered at the counter and my friend recommended that we just get pizza by the slice. They had three different cases full of varying pizza by the slice to choose from in both deep dish and thin crust. I decided to get one of each, a slice of pepperoni deep dish and a slice of jalapeno and sausage on the thin crust. I first started with the slice of deep dish and it was delicious! The crust was crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside with a nice buttery flavor. The cheese and pepperoni were piled high and then smothered in a tasty red sauce. This was exactly what I was expecting from a slice of Chicago style pizza. One slice of this thick pie is probably enough for a decent size lunch. But for the sake of my reviews, I suffered through a slice of thin pizza too. The thin crust was also good, but it is hard to compare with the deep dish. The crust wasn't as crispy on the outside, so the entire slice of pizza was a little more doughy. Other than that the toppings were great and the sauce to cheese ratio was perfect. I would easily order either kind of pizza again, but for me the deep dish is the way to go since it is hard to find something like this in other parts of the country. In the future I will definitely remember The Art of Pizza during any Chicago trips.",0.9833,0.862,0.107,0.03,0.5335185185185185

I expected it to be longer than the person at AoP promised. That last star is missing because the delivery manager could just tell it straight for those people who expect things when promised. Let's move on to the food. This pizza is AMAZING! I believe that there is a sort of crust on the surface of the pizza that is buttery, melty and adds that element of mysterious deliciousness or je ne sais quois. Additionally, the sauce is phenomenal. It is red, fresh, and robustly flavorful. The crust on the bottom is akin to Lou Malnatti's however I think it is better: same texture, better flavor and less greasy. 5 stars for sure! The salad was mediocre at best, but again, this was as much as I expected from a pizza joint. The cherry tomatoes were a nice touch. The last thing I want in my mediocre ice berg salad is wedges of flavorless pale tomatoes. There were a lot of veggies other than the lettuce and that was a good thing. If I were making this salad, I would definitely slice the celery instead of just throwing in half a stick, but people might also find this to be a pleasant surprise especially if they order ranch dressing for dipping.  Another thing I can say is that although the pizza was ""late"" it was packaged very well, it was still very hot and it looked like it was oven to table, like it hadn't even made a journey in a car! Also, the delivery man brought me a liter of free soda even though I made no complaint about any lateness, a nice gesture.  I recommend this place for amazing, cutting edge stuffed pizza.

2010-12-11,5.0,"I used to frequent this fine establishment when I lived in Lakeview years back. Now that I live in Boston and have to deal with folk who may own a ""Chicago Pizza"" but don't actually make Chicago style pizza (nor hand tossed even well for that matter), I have missed that wonderful pizza. And, while thinking of Art of Pizza recently during one of my forays into the Boston pizza scene (which again isn't that great comparatively), I realized that Chicago Style pizza is one of few truly American foods, deep dish that is.  The sauce at Art of Pizza is rich. Tomato, dried oregano, parsley, thyme, onion powder, garlic powder/fresh? and probably some secret whatever, make the sauce so flavorful. This is important because so much of this pizza hinges on the sauce. For other types of pizza, the sauce can be neglected and if covered up with enough cheese and toppings, it's okay.  But because of the volume increase skyward from other similarly sized pizzas, the sauce becomes a catalyst for everything else that makes Chicago deep dish pizza, and also Art of Pizza, so delicious.  The crust has to be made with a lot of butter. This crust has to crumble and flake off at the same time. It also has to have some chewiness towards the middle without being too doughy. Oh, and it has to taste like butter, did I forget that? Anyway, the cheese has to be stringy and good, but I would argue is not the most important part as far as the taste goes. It does provide a good glue and base for the sausage. The sausage is good from Art of Pizza; full of fennel seeds and porky filled goodness and fried in a patty.  And the prices at Art of Pizza are great. One slice is usually good and you walk away from there happy, full, and aren't $10 poorer.  I can guess that almost everyone of these reviews about this place are about the pizza. They should be. But you should also give this place a shot for sandwiches.  So good. Also, they have daily specials on traditional Italian-American fare, lasagna, mostaccioli, etc. for short money and in larger-than-life quantities.  Give Art of Pizza a shot.

My normal issue with stuffed pizza is that I usually walk away thinking that all i ate was cheese. Art has just the right amount. Not to much, but it's definitely cheesy.  I can't really tell you about eating at the restaurant. I usually pick up for get delivery. They sell pizza by the slice which is awesome. Delivery is usually within the time they say it will be. The guys that work there are really nice. They never try to rush me even when there is a long line.

I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but it wasn't bad, nor was the best. Very spacious eating area, pretty chill and relaxed right after work on the weekdays.  I didn't think there was enough sauce on the pizza slice. It's a personal like, but I tend to go heavy on the pizza sauce. The cheese was very flavorful in that you could actually see the herbs that they sprinkled on top. My only complaint would've been that it wasn't hot enough (temperature wise). Perhaps the warmers should be a bit warmer.... Then again, if you get pizza here made to order, it would probably solve this issue.  If you're from New York, this is by no means a new york slice. For what I paid for a small drink and a slice, around 4 something.... it was a bit pricey compared to other places that I've gone to where the slices were much bigger, hotter, and saucier.  It's a good piece of pie... not the the best in my opinion. But I recommend to any pizza lover out there.",0.9685,0.764,0.164,0.072,0.5243672795458509

When the driver called me and learned that I was out of range by a few miles, he said he wasn't authorized to make the call to drive a little further to complete the delivery and told me to call management . The manager flat out stonewalled me and gave no consideration to the fact that I just wasted an hour of my life waiting for a pizza that didnt come. I offered additional money, I was willing to do everything short of drive to meet him as I didn't have a car to do so. As if the extra 10-15 minutes of driver time on a sunday was really going to put a dent in the bottom line.

If you put a slice of each side by side, most would have a hard time picking out the correct one.

2010-03-21,5.0,"On my most recent trip to Chicago, I wanted to do two things: Go to the 'Home Alone' house and eat really amazing Chicago-style pizza. Luckily I was able to do both of those things. After spending a bit of time doing some serious pizza research, I decided to go to The Art of Pizza. The name alone stood out from all the other pizza places, which probably helped me make the best pizza decision I have ever made to date.  We arrived and ordered two pies. One plain cheese and one vegetarian. After 40 minutes of waiting, we got our pies and the most amazing pizza experience begun. First off, I'm a HUGE fan of sauce on top... Just that switchup really transforms pizza. It automatically becomes a better pizza experience when sauce is on top. Sauce is the most important ingredient in my opinion. The sauce at art of pizza was absolutely wonderful. Really good balance of spices, sweet and tangy. The cheese was also on par. Also, I am not a crust guy, but the crust at art of pizza was good and I actually ate my crust this time. I noticed everyone but me and my friends were using forks and knives to eat their pizza, which was a horrid sight! Pizza should never be eaten with any utensil. It is purely for hands only. I was proud to get my hands a little messy. Sauce loss was initially a problem but then when I was down to the crust, I just dipped it into the sauce all over my plate. It was great.  Anyways this place ruled and I was so happy with my decision to go there. They really know the art of a great pizza.

At least in terms of slices... The last four times I've been there the slices were room temperature and lacking in cheese and ingredients. It is also strange that  out of their infinite array of slices, they do not offer a spinach deep dish. Yes, they have spinach, mushroom and onions , or just mushroom and spinach, but why not just go for a plain spinach slice? I don't know anyone who likes baked onions on their pizza.

2009-10-23,4.0,"First and foremost, a lesson in pizza terminology.  A lot of people here are referring to them as having the best deep dish in the city.  The Art of Pizza doesn't appear to even have deep dish on the menu.  What they have is pan pizza, thin crust, and stuffed pizza. Pan Pizza - pizza that's made in the same pan a deep dish is made in, but a pan pizza has a thicker crust.   Pan pizzas are easily accessible and made in just about every city in America--I think everyone's had a Pizza hut pan pizza at some point in their life, no? Whereas a deep dish pizza is actually a thinner crust that's molded to the inside of the entire pan so that it has a large, but thin, lip.  Then fill that with cheese, toppings, and sauce just like you would a pie.  A deep dish will weigh twice as much as a pan pizza because it has so much more cheese and so many more toppings.  At some Chicago pizzerias, they cook it long enough that the cheese gets nice and caramelized. A stuffed pizza is a twist on deep dish (perhaps I'd buy that you could call it a ""subset"" --but NOT the same) where the sauce is on the top layer.  There's a thin base layer of crust, with a thick layer of cheese and toppings that melt together, then a VERY thin layer of crust.  (Most people would probably never recognize that there's a thin layer of crust, but if you eat it cold you'd probably notice).  Then a THICK layer of sauce.  It will taste completely different than a deep dish though because the sauce and the seasonings on it are sometimes the most prevalent flavors.   The cheese will be more chewy and kind of melds with the thin layer of crust. Stop using deep dish and stuffed pizza interchangeably, they're not.  ...Now that we've got that out of the way.   So which did I choose?  I ordered the Art's special stuffed pizza...   Taking into consideration that many here think this is ""the best"" ... As far as deep dish goes you can't really compare it to a real deep dish, it's different, but I think there are clearly better deep dish pizzas.  Now, as far as stuffed pizza... there are a lot fewer players in this arena but I'd still say it's not my favorite (for that, I'd refer you to Rosatti's on Broadway/Lawrence).  Art of Pizza stuffed pizza is clearly better than some others though. They brought me a free 2 liter of Pepsi... a HFCS abomination that's been sitting in my fridge for 3 weeks now. I can't find anyone willing to take it off my hands! The supreme salad was good, but there was not nearly enough lettuce. it was a salad you ate and had a bowl full of toppings left over.  Kind of a waste.  The creamy garlic dressing was good tasting.",0.9933,0.865,0.111,0.024,0.5439890710382514

Walking into Art's I was instantly struck by the heavy scents of tomato, pepper, and butter in the air - exactly like a pizza joint should smell.  Approaching the counter I was...I guess the word is ""greeted"" but a sullen looking young man who acted as though it was a great inconvenience to tell me which pizzas were available by the slice.  Listening to the options I decided on a slice of deep dish Art's Special which was plated and handed to me without further warming and without as much as a smile - $3.25 please. Making my way to the table I must admit the décor left a lot to be desired - but thankfully the pizza did not.  Thick, hefty, and absolutely loaded with fresh toppings the sausage, onion, mushroom and green pepper special had just the right amount of toppings versus cheese, a wonderful buttery and crisp crust, and the best pizza sauce I've tasted in many moons.  Starting with a fork and knife then later proceeding to pick the slice up and eat it by hand I was amazed how the crust was able to support the heft yet how delicate it was in the mouth.  While the pizza could've stood to be a little warmer, the flavor certainly topped Giordano's or Pizzapapolis (Chicago and Detroit, respectively, and my only previous Chicago-style experiences) and rivaled the famous Lou Malnati's with Butter Crust that I had two days later. Poor service and ambiance would normally knock off two stars but the pizza was so damned good and the single slice option so convenient that I can't complain too much.  I'd love to order a full one next time, the sauce was sublime.",0.9964,0.734,0.204,0.061,0.45488338192419847

I admit, I'm biased based on the TimeOut article rating ""the best"" pizza in Chicago.  My opinion is also swayed by the fact that AoP sits in a shitty strip mall.  For some places this is discouraging, particularly if the restaurant is meant to classy, but for AoP, a simple pizzeria, it works and makes me feel like I ""made a discovery"". This place is CHEAP and mad props for selling by the slice! $2.95/slice, any slice, deep dish, thin crust, toppings, cheese, whatever.  Never will I settle for a substandard slice of pizza for more than 3 bucks within a 2 mile radius ever again.  The menu is fairly extensive, with pastas, italian sandwiches, etc and there are daily specials, which I will return to try. AoP is a point and order at the counter type place, and you can mix/match to your heart's content and have them throw it in a big pizza box to go if you so choose.  The dining area is simple, 2 rooms of tables and counter space.  You bus your own plates.  'Tis homely. Everyone has their own definition of what makes a good slice, but for me, AoP pizza has a nice buttery crust, a rich, but not overly heavy dose of cheese, and tasty sauce that isn't overwhelming.  The multitude of combinations of toppings to choose from w/o having to pay a premium certainly adds bonus points. The only drawback I can think of for AoP is that it's not close to any public transportation...maybe you can take the bus up Lincoln to Ashland...maybe you can walk from Belmont or Southport stations...the good thing about this though, is that you're forced to walk off some of the pizza you ate since you ate so much since it was so good!

If a sauce isn't good there's no saving it.  #2:  The ratio of crust to sauce and cheese .  Here we go:  Art's sauce is good and well seasoned so no complaints there.  But here's the kicker...Art's pizza has A LOT of bottom crust, probably 1/2 inch thick.  There is way more crust than sauce and cheese combined.  So, if you like a mouthful of crust then this is your pizza.  It's just not my preference.   I have always ranked Gino's East #1 and Pequod's #2 for deep-dish pizza.  I love the chunky tomatoes on Gino's East and the fact the bottom layer of (cornmeal) crust is thinner so it lets the sauce and cheese be the stars of the show.  Pequod's is similar to Gino's but the caramelized (some people call it burnt) crust is what makes it distinctive.  Their sauce is great, too.   As we say in the wine and spirits business, there's no such thing as good or bad tasting--just different.  So there you have it.  My slightly unscientific review of 3 deep dish pizza joints.",0.961,0.861,0.114,0.025,0.49444444444444435

It wasn't what I expected. It was rough around the edges and reminiscent of a fast food joint. The menu was difficult to read as it was obstructed and so I just pointed to a pizza and they handed me a slice. This slice was looking good and tasted better. It was a filling slice of pizza heaven. I washed it down with soda and headed out. I now understand the love of deep dish pizza.

Don't like pizza?  You're weird... ...but there is still something for you at AOP.  Their manicotti dinner is amazing (and on special for $5.25 on Saturdays) and they serve up some hearty sub sandwiches.  Everything on the menu is fairly cheap ($2.75 for a slice of pizza, an average of $6-7 for a dinner COMPLETE with bread, salad, and another side) and, if you order delivery, they throw an extra liter or two of pop in for ya.  I've had quite a bit of things from the menu and haven't found something I didn't like yet.

On the Art's special, the crust is very average however the toppings are way much better than at other places we have been. The sauce was slightly sweet, almost neutral. In no way was it acidic (Ex. Rosati's). The cheese was absolutely perfect. the only complaint I have is they sort of cheaped out on the sausage since there was not enough for my taste.  The spinach/mushroom was also extremely impressive. Also something very pleasing was the prices. It was refreshing to actually find an AFFORDABLE stuffed crust locale for once.

Cheese- Good, but they don't give you a ton in your pie. Not over-flowing like a lot of stuffed-pizza places, and cheese is my favorite part of the pizza, so the more the merrier. Sauce- A little over-powering. Zesty, which is good, but it overshadows the taste of the cheese and the toppings, which is kind of disappointing.

So  much so, that when I ordered my large ""deep dish"", I said stuffed and was told they don't offer that. What they do offer, is deep dish, see the  distinction.  What makes the taste good, fresh toppings cooked till it's  soft and tender. I.e the veggies have that cooked and soft feeling without  the crunch. The pizza crust still has a doughy feel, its not crunchy, its a  bit undercooked so its easy to enjoy the entire slice without leaving any  crust behind.  Those that love to order double dough, doughy, would love this slice.  A large deep dish gets you two 24 oz bottles of Pepsi products, free.  I thought it was a pretty good pizza and could see myself grabbing slices when in the area. However, having other pizza places nearer to me, I wouldn't go out of my way for it. I enjoyed the pizza with other Chicago-style pizza fans (excuse the expression aka ""Pizza Nazi's""), two of us thought it was a good pizza, another three thought it was just OK, nothing special.

Then I moved to Roscoe Village and, after much convincing from my roommate, I agreed to try a slice of THE ART OF PIZZA.  Sadly, when I paid my first visit, they had no vegetarian slices left on the hotplates.  I was disappointed, and I swore off deep dish pizza for a second time. When I finally returned to THE ART OF PIZZA, the pieces fell into place.  I bought one slice of green pepper, mushroom and onion stuffed pizza for a couple bucks, and my life changed.  The clouds lifted and the birds sang.  I never imagined deep dish pizza could taste like this.  In the many times that I have been back there, I have never had a problem with there being no vegetarian options. I have since tried deep dish pizza at a number of deep dish pizzeria's claiming to be THE BEST DEEP DISH PIZZA IN CHICAGO.  LOU MALNATI'S, GIORDANO'S, GINO'S, EDWARDO'S, PEQUOD'S, CHICAGO'S.  None of these places are nearly as good as THE ART OF PIZZA.

My first year living in Chicago I lived 1/2 a block west of Art on Nelson. After my roommates' Dad and my Dad graciously moved us in they got Art of Pizza slices for a hearty thank you lunch. All 4 of us have been obsessed with it ever since. I'm talking the deep dish here. The crust is buttery and crispy, but not so hard that it will scrape your mouth. The sauce is exquisite with ripe tomatoes and wonderful seasoning and spices. The toppings, whether spinach and mushroom or sausage are always plentiful and in perfect compliment to the cheese that tops the pie. It's hard to explain how good this stuff actually is. If you order for delivery, be prepared for an hour wait, and more on the weekends. Just sit still, or go take a walk, and enjoy the anticipation because it is SO worth it. I've never had a pizza from Art delivered anything but piping hot. On the other hand, if you need a quick, nourishing, delicious lunch or dinner stop in in for one of the many slices they keep ready. So good, so cheap, a slice and a pop costs around $4. And you won't be hungry for hours after.

I have gained 5-10 pounds easily from an obsession born on that day. Chicago is known for iconic food: the Chicago hot dog, the Italian beef, Maxwell Street Polish and the trump card itself, Chicago deep dish pizza. Yes, there is a difference between deep dish and stuffed. And with it comes a preference. And if your preference is a sauce-on-top stuffed, the monster of all pizzas, then Art of Pizza is the last stop along a long ride of famous Chicago pizzerias.  Art of Pizza offers three varieties: thincrust, deep dish and stuffed. They make a decent thin, an excellent deep dish -- the kind Pizzeria Uno gave the rest of the depraved world -- and finally, one of Chicago's top-rated stuffed. The Art of Art's Stuffed:    Flaky, buttery crust (IMHO the best in the city) + Standard toppings + LOTS of cheese + Wonderfully tangy, spicy, rich pizza sauce _________________________________________ =Chicago's Best Stuffed Pizza Among my Top 10 Chicago meals, I would include an Art of Pizza Deep Stuffed Spinach and Mushroom. I am not a vegetarian. The combination of gooey cheese, tons of spinach, the soaked-yet-crispy crust and that punch-you-in-the-mouth sauce are an extraordinary taste experience. Art of Pizza earns my 5-star on their stuffed pizza alone. While their thin and traditional deep dish are very good, they aren't Chicago's best. Helping the grade, the service is always friendly (in person), it's a BYOB establishment (Foremost Liquors is right across the street), they have a new expanded dining room and the lunch and dinner platter items are always cheap and nasty-good. Their Chicken Parmesan is not the healthiest item, but massive and delicious (aided, I believe, by that damned pizza sauce). The competition is fierce and everyone has an opinion. I've enjoyed many a Chicago stuffed pizza, from Gino's to Chicago Pizza Co. to Giordanno's, and Art's features the best crust and sauce combination I've encountered, putting it on top of a prestigious crowd.",0.9864,0.835,0.129,0.036,0.5984982477839621

The guy I ordered from was very friendly. Snaps. I placed my order at an off-time, about 4:45, so the delivery was especially fast, but the driver used that noggin to let himself in my front door (which graciously leaves itself partially open for guests to come and go as they please when it's cold) and bring the pizza all the way to my door. Most delivery guys don't do that. I gave him a nice tip for that, but I was shocked that the bill for a 10-inch pizza (SCANTILY topped, might I add) came to $24 including my tip. Ouch. Now, for the pizza. The sauce is phenomenal. There are little flakes of delicious oregano sprinkled on top of the pizza, and my whole apartment was filled with pizza smell as soon as I opened the box. I wish there had been more sauce, really. Overall, I can't say I loved this pie as much as I wanted to.

I only tried the deep dish cheese pizza, but everything they had out looked great. Their menu has a wide variety of pizza choices, but you can also choose from a whole bunch of different sandwiches. What I like best about this place is that you can get pizza by the slice... deep dish pizza too! Most pizza by the slice places only offer their thin crust that way, and as a single girl in this city I am never really in need of an entire deep dish pizza. Being able to get that one coveted slice is perfect for me.  A couple reasons for it's 4 star rating instead of 5: While they have seating here, it's definitely not a sit-down restaurant. You're better off ordering and eating at home. Also, they use just a tad bit too much oregano. Maybe I'm just not an oregano fan, but I could have used a little bit less on my slice. That said, the crust is golden, buttery and delicious. The sauce to cheese to crust ratio is perfect, making The Art of Pizza deep dish a pizza I know I will eat again.

I would be so happy to hear of more locations to open but for some reason the competition is actually STILL in business. Shame on you non-art of pizza customers.

We had to call them twice. It arrived slightly soggy and luke warm. This probably affected the taste of Chicago's so-called #1 Deep Dish. It wasn't anything special. I'm willing to give it another try - dine-in style, but will never do delivery again. And for now I'm perfectly happy sticking with Giordano's and Malnati's.",0.7516,0.729,0.158,0.113,0.5629629629629629
2006-11-18,5.0,"Some friends of ours were relocating to Chicago, so they came for a visit to check out the city & find a place. By chance, their apartment finding service guy happened to mention the Art of Pizza as a great place to get a pizza--- they passed on the word to us, and we checked it out together that very night.  We went and told the guy we heard they had the best pizza in the city--- he said they did, and pointed to the various magazine clippings framed on their counter. This place was even voted best pizza by Newsweek for crying out loud (in what I believe was a national ""contest,"" not just Chicago). The guy said the pizza that receives all the rave reviews was the stuffed pizza, so we ordered that. It was really good but takes awhile, so from now on, we always call it in ahead of time and then pick it up. (Which isn't a problem as the place has its own decent sized parking lot--- a detail no one's mentioned yet!)  1-2 slices is seriously enough to stuff me silly. We like to pick up a large stuffed from here when we have visitors in town who aren't up for going out but want a good, authentic to Chicago meal, and no one's been disappointed yet. Even though it is super scrumptious, I wouldn't recommend this as an every week kind of thing--- too filling, so more of a once in awhile or when you're really hungry kind of thing.  Also, I was driving by this place the other night and happened to see some changes. As a previous reviewer forecasted, they did indeed expand the restaurant; it's longer & has taken over most (if not all, couldn't tell) of the dinky little strip mall. So, there's now much more seating than before if you choose to dine in.",0.9668,0.835,0.116,0.049,0.5741758241758241

2006-08-12,5.0,"Really yummy deep dish pizza! But you gotta have patience for it. We ordered delivery and it took them around 1-1/2 to 2 hours to get it to us because they make it fresh and everyone else is ordering from there too.  They have an awesome menu - pizza, lunch & dinner specials, subs, appetizers, salads, sandwiches, pasta, ribs, shrimp, chicken and parmigiana. I would definitely go for a pizza if you have never been here before. It's freakin' good!",0.9458,0.811,0.189,0.0,0.5928571428571429
2006-08-07,5.0,Do these guys ship to california? I broke my veganism because of this pizza and never looked back. Their cheese pizza allows me to appreciate their killer ingredients wow its sooo good - simplicity at its best. Their stuffed was my first time eating such a pizza and it was so special - Cornmeal curst bottom cheese in the middle and tangy sauce on top.  First place I am going to when I return.  Con: Ordered here from my hotel on my last day in Chicago and the pizza guy called me back to see how my pizza was and flirted - This was not ok but since the usual guy at the front counter was great and reminded me of spike lee I overlooked it (It was very rude however) ...,0.7588,0.783,0.128,0.089,0.405297619047619

2006-06-16,5.0,"A friend of mine took me here yesterday 06.15.06.  I found out that the guy who owns this place went into business with my friend when they were 19 (they're now both in their 40's.). So they have a deep connection. Best buds. I learned a LOT about the background of the Art of Pizza - and all of it GOOD. And GREAT pizza! Years ago, my dad had a bakery (Napolitano) and he also made pizza. It's like I'm back in the bakery when I was 8 years old! This pizza rocks! Buying by the slice allows you to choose a variety ($2.75 a slice) Yes, the place itself is very small, but it's not a dive. It's a nice place!  As usual, I have the ""scoop"" others do not: the owner bought out the whole strip mall, and he's taking the next two empty stores and expanding. The local alderman recommended he also do outdoor seating, but from what I can gather, that would be messy and later down the line.  Remember: The Art of Pizza won the Best Deep Dish Pizza in Chicago by WGN TV. I know why!",0.9657,0.81,0.148,0.042,0.3504938271604938
2006-06-02,5.0,"Best deep dish in the city hands down.  The place is a dive but don't let that be misleading... it also looks like they're about to expand so hopefully it won't be as cramped.  $2.52 per slice is a great deal as well.  The rest of their menu isn't the best, but they've got a ton of stuff and their daily specials are a steal.  I've never left that place hungry or disappointed.",0.8332,0.633,0.23,0.137,0.3486111111111111

2006-05-21,4.0,Really good pizza. Ok so the first time I went I hated it. We made the mistake of ordering the bbq pizza - it was really bad. Too much sauce and the sauce was too tangy (i'm picky about my bbq sauce). We told some people about our bad experience at Art of Pizza and they said to give it another try but to go for a more normal pizza. So we tried the 'special' pizza and it was delicious. I'd recommend this place to anyone except if you're feeling like a bbq pizza.,0.8416,0.751,0.163,0.086,0.5807359307359307
