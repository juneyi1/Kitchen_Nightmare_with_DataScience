2017-08-04,4.0,"We recently stopped at Hugo's Frog Bar for a celebratory dinner and was not disappointed. Our party of 6 arrived ~15 minutes before our 8:30 reservation, and even though the restaurant was absolutely packed, we were seated early.  Between the 6 of us, we ordered the porterhouse, walleye pike, crab legs, and lobster, among other things. Each member of the party was pleased with their dish. In terms of sides (which are large; we only needed 2 for the table), we especially enjoyed the chipotle roasted corn.  It's safe to say we were NOT prepared for dessert. Feeling pretty full, we decided to order only one dessert to split 6 ways. The muddy bottom pie was absolutely enormous, easily 10-12 slices. We didn't come close to finishing it. However, it was absolutely delectable and we were ultimately happy we ordered it. The only downside to our dinner was that Hugo's was out of several entree options for the evening, which we were only told after a member of our party had to re-order several times. Given the price of the entrees, it's somewhat of a bummer to have to settle for your third choice.",0.9526,0.802,0.137,0.061,0.6675865800865801

The crab cake appetizer is filled with lump crab and minimal filler. The exterior is crusty and the interior is soft and warm.  The Chilean sea bass is tasty, but the real highlight for me were the mushrooms underneath. I was impressed by the flavor and texture of the bed of mushrooms. The sea bass was a bit firmer than I was expecting, as I was hoping it would be as soft and buttery as the server suggested. The brussel sprouts are pretty sweet and sprinkled with pieces of bacon. I liked that the sauteed mushrooms were whole, miniature, baby bellas. The turtle pie is nearly a quart of vanilla ice cream over a spice cookie crust, covered in macadamia nuts and caramel sauce.

We had a dinner party for 20 at the Des Plaines location and they put square tables together and sat us a ONE table. Second the service was terrible. We all had different waiters so everyone ordered at separate times and received their food at different times. One table was finished eating and paid; while the other table still had not received their food. Third, our waiter did not ask us if we wanted anymore drinks, it took 45 minutes to get our food, and we had to ask them 3 times for our check.

They do make sure that a manager comes and checks on you though. My favorite foods from Hugo's are oysters and the King Crab Bites. I have not ventured into the steaks or chops. I try to be there for the $1 oyster happy hour whenever possible. I think that's what keeps me coming back. Also, the Gold Coast location can't be beat if you have enough money in your pocket and self respect to lose along rush street. Once, during a phenomenal date, we were lucky enough to have the power go out during our oyster meal. The staff was ready with candles and lit the place quite romantically, for what could have been a bit of a disastrous evening. A friend commented that this was not the first recent power outage, and opined that Hugo's may have some infrastructure issues... but for me, it was a delightfully unexpected turn of events that the staff transformed into an impressive win.

Overall, we felt that things went okay, I wasn't wowed by anything which is kind of a bummer since we spent a pretty penny here to come out with just an eh experience. The place was beautifully decorated for NYE but it was insanely crowded, like you couldn't get up without being in your neighbors table. Way too overwhelming for me. The server was nice and had some nice recommendations throughout the meal so they get a star for that. They brought out the bread which was cold and I mean come on, that's rule number one, no one likes cold bread.  Then we ordered some soups, I really liked the lobster bisque and that may have been my favorite thing of the night so they get another star for that. I had to try frog legs for the first time because, come on, look at the name of this place and they were eh. Didn't care for them at all, they were really rubbery tasting and nothing like chicken, sorry.  For our entrees, I really was craving the lobster roll which is what I got. Honestly, it was full of lobster, so they didn't disappoint in that regard but the lobster meat was cold which I wish the server told us as I like lobster rolls with buttered and warm lobster meat and this was the one in mayo. I mean I've had this version before in other places, but the seasoning was much better everywhere else. I don't know maybe they were having an off night. I was pretty full from everything by that point but I had to get the dessert because they are known for their key lime pie. That's what we got and our friends got the chocolate dessert and I wish our server would have said, for 4 people don't get two since they are huge. They literally were gigantic. Again, the key lime pie was okay, nothing special, a little too tangy for me. I guess I had high expectations for this place because we chose it for New Years eve but overall, it was okay. I felt like everything was kind of rushed that evening and I just didn't get that awesome experience I was hoping for. Somethings tasted okay and others didn't blow us away.

We also ordered couple glasses of wines and fried calamari. The calamari was not that good and the portion was too big to be considered as an appetizer. However, the oysters were fresh and huge! We did find them a little too salty compared to other oysters, but it did not bother us too much since we ordered another round.

There was a complete lack of salt and they pretty much just tasted like lemon. Very disappointing. The calamari was good. For dinner we tried the sea bass, which was absolutely delicious. We also got the ribeye. The steak was cooked perfectly, but it was the most under seasoned steak I have ever had. No smoky flavor, no salt, no pepper...no flavor at all. How can such a good quality steak be so bland? It was shocking. For dessert, we got the carrot cake. It was huge, but had the texture of a bran muffin.

I went with a 10oz filet mignon for $42.25 cooked to medium (although I think they brought me the 14 oz for $49.25) which came with soup or salad. I did the bookbinder's soup which was amazing. The filet was amazing - very juicy and flavorful. Each bite was an experience. Bread for the table was also served. I also went with a side of Brussel sprouts - lucky for me, my server suggested i go with a half portion since it was just me and the sides are intended to be shared. She was right, even the smaller portion was more than enough. For wine I went with a glass of the 14 Hands cab for $9 and BV Napa cab for $14...I don't recommend either.

2016-04-04,5.0,"Last night my husband and I celebrated our 3rd Year Anniversary of when we First met. Thanks right! We celebrate every little thing. After all, life is a BEACH and we ALWAYS find ours. We had dinner and cocktails at The famous Hugo's Frog Bar located in the Gold Coast of The Greater Down Town Chicago.  It was fantastic from the moment we walked in the door. As we were asked to follow the beautiful hostess, there was a server in each booth as we walked by we felt like celebrities. They all opened way and greeted us with a warm and firm ""hello"", followed by ""Enjoy your evening"". It was fabulous. We started the night with hand crafted cocktails, Manhattans on the Rocks to be exact! They were made to perfection. One of my favorite appetizers is their Shrimp Cocktail. They manage to have an exquisite home made cocktail sauce that is adorned with their special horseradish sauce. I tell my husband that if the cocktail sauce does not mange to make go  ""ooooh"" and break a little sweat, then it needs more horseradish! The shrimp are JUMBO, well cleaned, fresh flowed daily from fresh water areas and with the right amount of crisp in every bite!  We toasted the night away to a bottle of Champagne. For dinner we had their famous known for Crab Cakes and garden salad. We ordered grilled cauliflower as a side dish, and let me brag about the taste of it! The charred areas of the cauliflower were very tasty... Mmmmm it just added all kinds of flavors to my mouth.  For dessert we had the Crème brûlée and the top was nicely torched to perfection and did not give me a burned flavor, it was just right! As I took my first scoop, the creamy taste was melting on the tip of my tongue. That was a very tasty dessert if I do say so myself!  As the night greeted us with another delightful evening, we exchanged a million smiles, laughter and many many great memories that have been a part of the great marriage we both have. I remember when selfish people used to tell me when my husband and I first met, "" I give you guys 2years max!"" I can honestly say that frightened me, but now, NOW I am glad I can just laugh about it and enjoy what I do have.  Life has its ups and downs, but I am grateful and bless to be able to say that we have had MANY MANY MORE UPS than downs. Which I can also say I have NOT taken it for granted. I cherish and appreciate my husband to the fullest and show him everyday of how grateful and thankful I am of him.  We probably exchange dozens and dozens of ""I LOVE YOU"", "" THANK YOU"", ""I MISS YOU,"" as corny as it may seem to others, we don't care what anyone else has to say, because at the end of the day, it's us that we have to satisfy and not others. After all, we are the only 2that lay heads in our sanctuary.  With all this my dear readers, I leave you for today is another beautiful day and we will make the best out of it.

Hugo's was packed when we walked in.  After some discussion, we decided to see if we can sit at the bar.  We (four of us) were very fortunate to be able to share a table with a very nice accommodating couple.  Because it was standing room only, it took a while for the waitress to come and get our order.  Once the order was placed, it came out at a reasonable pace. We chose fried calamari as an appetizer.  It was a bit greasy but really tasty.  Bread was nothing special but warm and tasty.  One of us chose filet slider which was really tasty.  Two of us chose fillet medallion which came with four large pieces and sautéed broccoli.  We thought this was the best deal in the house.  It was cooked as ordered (medium) and was delicious.  Then there was the famous lobster tail which was ridiculously big and tasty.  At $56.50, I thought it was ridiculously expensive until I saw the piece.  It was a tad dry but really tasty.  Did I mention that it was big? Overall, fun and noisy place if you can get a seat and may be more relaxing way to taste Gibson's steaks.",0.93,0.835,0.104,0.061,0.5102173913043477

2016-03-02,4.0,"We had dinner at Hugo's Frog Bar last night (a Tuesday night) and had a very enjoyable meal. Décor: The bar and dining room(s) are pretty decent sized but not massive. They should be able to accommodate any size group you have but the tables are placed a bit close together. Overall the feeling is one of an upscale dinner restaurant. It is not stuffy or pretentious, just very nice and classy. The cool features are the little things: the appropriate wall decorations, the small ""telephone booth"" table, and the semi-nautical themed bathrooms. It's a fun place that doesn't take itself too seriously (even thought they could b/c it is a money spot!). Bathroom: very clean and inviting w/ a gentlemanly bathroom attendant Staff: The bar staff, host, our waiter, and the bus boys were all exception. Everyone was spot-on with their duties and never far away when needed. Our waiter seemed especially adept at handling larger groups as he did so with our like a breeze! Our water glasses also never dropped below half-full! Great service. Food/drinks: We all started with a round of drinks (they have an extensive wine list and a nice selection of ""homemade"" cocktails) and moved right to dinner; no appetizers surprisingly. Being a large group there was a variety of items ordered so I can only speak for myself: I had the Chilean Sea Bass and it was outstanding; it's miso glaze was exquisite. On top of that I had a house salad (standard) and we also had a few sides: brussel sprouts (delicious), asparagus (very thick and tasty), fries (yum), spinach (standard) and corn (tasty). No dessert, as most were full. Value: The bill was not paid by me but I saw the prices on the menu... like I said, this is a nicer place that is upscale - plus it's seafood - so the prices are going to be higher. However, the food quality is spot on. I would, however, like to see the portion-sizes increase - my sea bass was a pretty small piece... We have been to another HFB in Naperville and this place is not much different: GREAT food, good people, nice atmosphere.

He was attentive but knew when to leave us to eat, extremely helpful and gave us some great recommendations both on the food and the wine. We ended up ordering a mid-range bottle of wine and we tasted it first and were satisfied with his recommendation. For starters, we ordered the crab cakes and the bookbinder soup. They came out and were a great size - more than enough for two people. The hot pink sauce it came with was a great compliment to the cakes, and we downed them really quickly. As for the soup, I really wish that more places had bookbinder soup - we got it because it was recommended from here by a friend and it lived up to the recommendation. For the main meal, I ordered the crab stuffed lobster, and my boyfriend ordered a New York sirloin steak. The lobster was great, and although I liked the crab filling, I could have done without the addition of apple to it. My boyfriend enjoyed his steak, it was cooked exactly the way that he had requested it. We also ordered a side of roasted brussel sprouts, which had bacon and were absolutely delicious. The waiter recommended that we order a half portion since the sides are huge, and even then we ended up taking leftover brussel sprouts home (to my joy).

I have to say that this restaurant wasn't my first option but after reading the reviews we decided to give it a try. We arrived a little early so we headed to the bar and order some cocktails, I ordered a martini which was very well prepared, no complains at all.  Once our table was ready our host showed us their special selection of fish, crab legs and lobster which was very impressive. We started with some appetizers and feeling a little adventurous we decided to order the sautéed frog legs in garlic butter (never had them before), spicy grilled corn and Pan-Roasted PEI Mussels in tomatoe sauce.  The frog legs were delicious as wells as the corn, a little spicy for my date but since I love spicy food I found it perfect, the mussels are something else, the plate is huge, we couldn't finish them. Overall the appetizer portions were very generous so be careful when ordering the appetizers specially if its a small group. As for the main course we opted for the Miso Marinated Chilean Sea Bass with mushrooms and peas. The fish was cooked to perfection and the balance of flavors between the fish and the mushrooms and peas couldn't be better.  Sorry but no room for dessert.  The service was outstanding and the prices are not bad after taking into consideration the whole experience. I will definitely come back to this place.

The last time I had them, it was at some random buffet in some random part of town. Not a good experience. However, with frog legs being one of their specialities, I decided to go for it. What a heavenly combination between the taste of chicken and crab  meat (hey, leave my comparison alone!). I then had the Cajun Chicken and Crab, with Andouille sausage and garlic butter. I could've asked the chef to marry me. Male or Female. I only had a French Martini and didn't indulge in any other libations since I wanted to leave room for the stuffage of my face.

I love vodka and my friend loves whiskey and we both thought these were excellent martinis to end the night (so we had two each!!) The server was very friendly and attentive and the bar is well-decorated and a fun place to enjoy the end of the evening. I've seen great reviews on the food here on Yelp so that is another reason to visit. A final comment for the attentiveness of the manager. As we were getting ready to leave, my friend loved the martini glass with the name ""Gibsons"" etched onto it. She wanted to buy it and the server said it would be $15, but she needed to check with management. The manager came over and my friend explained that her favorite Manhattan drinking buddies and neighbors are named Gibson and she wanted to surprise them with a gift. The manager informed the server to wrap up a glass - at no charge. Now that is class and shows appreciation to her customer base. Kudos and thanks for an excellent evening. You have a great bar here and based on the Yelp reviews, a great restaurant, too. The next day, we attended the Hot Dog Fest and decided to go back to the Oyster Bar for an afternoon cocktail and our two raven-haired beauties, Flavia and Nicole, were again working the bar. We tried a few other martinis and order the filet sliders, which were perfectly cooked to order filet mignon sliders with shoestring fries. Excellent appetizer!! We stayed for a few hours and chatted with the girls, listened to a great jazz piano player and when we went to pay the bill, I noticed a discount on it and asked Nicole what this was for. She said they had enjoyed our company so much these past two days that Hugo's bought us a round on them! Now, that is impressive! Give this place a try - YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!",0.9982,0.748,0.225,0.027,0.5842320261437907
2015-08-03,2.0,"The restaurant is overpriced for the quality of food.  The Mac and cheese tasted like it was made from the box.  The Brussels sprouts were practically raw.  The frog legs were good, but too garlicky.  The escargot was horrible - I have had much better.  The firecracker shrimp was good, but ordinary.  The best part of the meal was the pork chop from Gibson's next door (same owner and shared kitchen).  I would not recommend or return.",0.9167,0.704,0.217,0.079,0.45405982905982906
2015-08-01,4.0,I ordered the swordfish here and it was one of the best meals I've ever eaten at a restaurant.  The lobster bisque was also great so from a food standpoint the meal was great.  The only downside was we were put at a small table right in front of the kitchen - we were cramped for space and constantly had waiters squeezing past us - that table probably just shouldn't be there.  All in all our entire party of five loved it so I would definitely try it out.,0.9682,0.758,0.222,0.02,0.5676406926406926

2015-07-27,3.0,"My wife and I came to Hugo's Frog Bar to celebrate our anniversary-we chose Hugo's primarily based on reputation and affiliation with Gibson's.  Our experience was average all the way around-from service to food quality to ambiance. Given the number of similar restaurants serving this type of food, our recommendation is to go elsewhere.   Food: We started with oysters-they were quite good and probably the highlight of the meal.  Our meals came with a salad/soup choice-the house salad was very, very basic-plenty of iceberg lettuce much of which was white which I find bitter.  They made up for the lack of anything interesting by dousing it with way too much dressing.  For a high end steakhouse, it was disappointing.  My wife had the lobster tail-she reported it was average-not the best she's had but not bad.  I had the halibut which was okay-nothing that I'd have to have again but not bad either.  Just average.  The sides of a double baked potato and asparagus were once again, okay.  Service: When making our reservation, I mentioned it was our anniversary-not that we were looking for anything from it but usually, restaurants acknowledge that somehow-even if to just thank us for celebrating with them.  Nothing from the team at Hugo's not at the front desk or by the server.  Not a huge deal but a high end restaurant usually gets that right.  Service was okay-maybe a bit casual but nothing overly impressive.  Server never provided his name so I can't reference him by name.  Again, just an average experience. Ambiance:  Tables are packed together very closely which provided us with the opportunity to learn all about the people dining next to us.  This is becoming repetitive but the ambiance was average too.  The meal for two cost $195 which suggests the outcome should be something other than average. Overall: Hugo's didn't do any particularly well nor were they particularly poor at anything-average at everything.  If you are look okay with average, this is your place.  If you are looking to be impressed, my recommendation is to seek another restaurant.",0.9836,0.829,0.128,0.043,0.4516422466422467
2015-07-23,1.0,If I could give this place 0 star rating I would. First off let's say that this restaurant is not on the cheaper side so you would expect the level of service to be top notch. However... The waiter that we had to take our drink orders didn't seem very pleasant from the start but let's move pass that as perhaps he was having a bad day. We ordered margaritas on the rocks no salt nothing fancy. Well to my utter disgust once my drink arrived to the table one of my straws had RED LIPSTICK on it. Now how did this happen... WHO KNOWS!!! When we ask to speak with the manager to let him know what was going on he offered to bring more drinks but seemed very unwelcoming when doing so.. Needless to say we did NOT want more drinks as if the straw is nasty I am CERTAIN the glasses are filthy!!!! We would NEVER go here again and I'll be sure to warn my family members and colleagues about this place. First and a LAST time!! BEWARE!!!!!!,-0.9531,0.828,0.048,0.124,0.6037698412698412

Excellent food and drinks with superb service!!  My personal favorite:  Drinks: French Martini (I can bet you just can't have one) and they also have a great selection for wine.  Food: Scallops- absolutely cooked to perfection with spicy corn salsa; my husband ordered on our server suggestion the swordfish on the specials with mashed potatoes which was excellent.  All our friends were extremely happy with the food and had no room for dessert. But I am definitely going back for the Slice of muddy pie.. Oh and I completely forgot the complementary bday vanilla ice cream with a candle was a cute add on.  P.s.

2015-07-13,4.0,"My friends and I were looking for a seafood restaurant to try and we had heard great things about Hugo's. We made a reservation for 7:30, although we got there at 6:45 so we were hoping they could seat us early. It turns out they couldn't, but no big deal- to the bar we go! We settled in to kill approximately 45 minutes (with alcohol, really not a hardship), which turned into 1 hour, which then turned into 1  1/2 hours, which finally turned into 1 hour 40 minutes. That's right 55 minutes after our reservation we were seated! Our waiter was extremely apologetic and the restaurant immediately brought us 2 apps on the house- the shrimp cocktail and the crab cakes. Shrimp cocktail was good and had a little kick to it as were the crab cakes.  We also ordered the frog leg appetizer for ourselves, cause c'mon the place is called frog bar and we had to. I've never had frog legs before so I have nothing to compare them with but they were tasty, albeit very garlicky. For our main courses we got, crab legs, the peppercorn swordfish, and the Chilean sea bass. Everyone enjoyed their meals but we all concluded the sea bass was the best.  Originally we were planning on skipping dessert but due to the very extended wait they also comped our dessert. It was massive- I have never seen desserts so huge.  A quick note on the atmosphere: The place is very loud, tight, and in Viagra triangle so don't go here looking for an intimate dinner.  Overall- 4 stars, although they did everything right in response to the wait I still have to ding them a star. Also, shout out to our waiter, Will, who was probably one of the best servers I've ever had.",0.9796,0.874,0.105,0.021,0.5273384353741497

Our server was extremely funny right from the start and there was a fantastic comedic exchange the entire evening.  Started out with the Alaskan King Crab Bisque, which was excellent and the calamari. Silly me let the server talk me into only a half portion of the calamari, which was a decent size, but was so fresh and tasty that I could've taken down the full portion. Had the salmon, which again was fresh and delicious. However, there was a copper river salmon on special that our server was pushing hard, so I decided to try it. He came back later to tell me they were out. I was disappointed, but he offered a free dessert to make up for it. I chose the key lime pie and it had to be the biggest hunk of pie I've ever been served. No lie, there had to be about six inches of meringue on top. The pie was very good and it was the first dessert that I couldn't finish at the table.

The broccoli and asparagus were perfectly cooked...not over cooked, still having a little crunchiness to them. My wife had the Alaskan crab legs and for a crab connisuer, she said it was the best that she ever had. One of mm our friends got the scallops and said it was the best. We had both the fish s tomato based soup and the lobster bisque both of which were good. The ambiance was very nice and it was almost a perfect evening except that our waitress appeared to no be way to preoccupied.

2015-06-28,2.0,"We have eaten at Hugo's a few times in Naperville and always had great experiences so we were looking forward to trying the one downtown.  Unfortunately we were extremely disappointed with last nights dinner.   We arrived early in order to start out with a drink at the bar which was great, the bartender was a real character.  They seated us right on time per our reservation which was great (had a really good table too).  The sole reason for the 2 star review is based on the food.  The Alaskan King Crab soup was barely warm and the salad was drowning in dressing making it uneatable.  My wife had grilled shrimp and I had the filet.  Ordered the steak medium and when the waiter set it down he knew it was burn and thankfully asked me to cut into it.  It was well, well done and the waiter took it back to the kitchen.  Literally 3 minutes later he returned with a new steak that was rare.  Back to the kitchen he went.  About 10-15 minutes later (wife already done with her meal) a manager brought out a 3rd steak, which was the rare steak I cut in half, reserved.  No apology given, he just said ""third times a charm"" and left the table.  The 3rd attempt was still a fail as the steak was hot but some how still dripping blood.  Ate about 3-4 bites and was not impressed with the lack of flavor for a $41 steak. We didn't let it ruin our evening and chalked it up as everyone has a bad day.  I am sure if we go back we would have a completely different experience and a great meal.  With so many choices in the city I doubt we will be back to this one again.",0.6788,0.82,0.1,0.08,0.4171677088343755

For the oysters, we got six of both the small and medium ones which were paired with cocktail sauce and some herby sauce (not sure what it was exactly but it was great). I got the lobster roll as my main. Buttery toast filled with succulent chunks of lobster - yummy! The horse string fries were kind of like chips and I should've asked for normal fries. I also got a side of broccoli that came with a surprisingly good cheese sauce. We were too full for dessert but my coworker said they come in giant portions.  Overall, we all came out really satisfied and Im glad I had the chance to eat at Hugo's Frog Bar!",0.9945,0.791,0.209,0.0,0.5968991452991453

I saw some food going out that looked absolutely beautiful- some fish on a plank that had to be great; 2. I had a sip of a martini that was perfectly made; 3. The bar area with the piano player was perfect Chicago, like Gibson's, but not as self conscious; 4.  I fainted when I had been there about three minutes. It was outrageously embarrassing as I did the whole slide-to-the-ground thing, was out for a bit, and couldn't really get out of the place for about 10 minutes. The bartender, Brant, and the manager, RJ, were incredibly professional, kind, supportive, concerned, and so on. For all they knew, I was a junkie or something (no drugs involved, fyi), but they treated me with the utmost respect and care. This was really frightening for me, and I'm very grateful.

Immediately when my boyfriend and I walked in the hostess seemed to already know who we were based on reservations & the staff was as sweet and professional as could be! They definitely made us feel important and dedicated to our time there. The atmosphere in this restaurant was great, they had live music with a piano player, not one of those super loud where you can't hear each other, just perfect. Our waiter did an amazing job-he never bothered us too much, but always seemed to know when we needed something & took care of it immediately, even when he had many other tables. The food did not take long to come out, and let me just tell you, that is some of the best food I have ever had! I will say, the portions are a little large so I recommend sharing with another person, but it was exquisite! For the amount of food served with your entree, and being a college student, the pricing is perfect in my opinion. This is more of a high end restaurant, so the prices are expected, but again, for all the food on your plate it is definitely worth the buy!   From what I was told, this restaurant is known for their famous frog legs, and I first stuck my nose in the air about it, but wow were they absolutely amazing! I am not exactly into foods like that, but it tasted exactly like chicken & the seasoning/sauce on them was to die for! There were options to get a certain meals plan such as get an appetizer, salad, entree, and dessert which is exactly what I did! And for two people, the grand total was pretty satisfying, especially being a college student. It was well worth the price!

Hugo's was the only restaurant that would accommodate us at 9, and that was the only reason why we decided to eat here.  Nothing on the menu appeared to be particularly innovative or creative; it was all pretty standard steak and seafood fare, and everything that we tried, tasted pretty good. Nothing stood out, but we had no complaints either. Hence the A-OK rating.  The  jumbo lump crab cake, served with a hot pink aioli, is the signature appetizer. It is a rather large sized crab cake that I found to be quite satisfactory in terms of taste and quantity.  All dinner entrees are offered with a choice of soup or salad, and we both opted for the red king crab bisque. Again, pretty good, but nothing outstanding.  The sauteed steelhead trout was topped with king crab, grilled asparagus (which was a little overcooked for my taste) and a creole mustard hollandaise sauce, which gave it a nice sharpness.  The whole Maine lobster, stuffed with king crab and green apples with a lemon butter sauce, was similarly enjoyable, and I liked the tartness lent to the dish by the addition of the apples.  The valet parking is $14, which I think is a fair price for the convenience.  Overall, I would not mind returning to Hugo's when I am in the area.",0.9762,0.819,0.141,0.04,0.6588509316770186

FOOD: I could tell you how the Spicy Tuna Tartare ($14.75) was delicious, combining the smooth, soft tuna meat with the crunchy wonton chips. Or about the Fresh Point Judith Fried Calamari ($12.75) was even better (and much bigger). Or about the Alaskan Red King Crab Bisque ($6.50 for a small bowl) and how it chunky enough without being too salty. Or about the Pan Seared Georges Bank Sea Scallops ($34) and how they were giant, tender, and worth $34. Or about the Miso Marinated Chilean Sea Bass ($41.50), which was good, larger than what you get at Roy's in Honolulu for the same price.  The Sauteed Mushrooms ($7.75) and Chipotle Roasted Corn ($6) seem simple yet worth doing again. But...I will tell you instead about dessert and the Black Forest Cherry Cake ($17.25). What monstrosity of a dessert does the price of nearly a whole cake give you?  See my pic for details - 5 layers of fresh, soft chocolate cake, interlaces with light and airy whipped cream with shaved chocolate, cherries, and extra cream to boot.  6 of us could only finish the top half (ahem, actually, only the top two layers) of this beast.  Not for the faint of heart, you either need to sign up for diabetes when you order this thing on your own or have a cardiologist as a good friend thereafter! 3. SERVICE: What might be the best part of the restaurant is the service - our waiter was fantastic and humorous from start to finish, and if he wasn't trying to impress you with repeating back what all six of us ordered (appies, salads, entrees, and customizations), then he was super attentive and also stationed (literally) close to our table and other two he was caring for.  The bathroom attendant was also super pleasant and helpful (bring $$ for tips). 4.

Super amicable, knowledgeable, and courteous, he exemplified what a great dining experience should be like. We started off with some cocktails - my go to drink being a dirty martini with both olives and onions. Go figure, they carry the elusive blue cheese stuffed olives, making this martini drinker super happy! The vermouth to vodka balance was perfect and my drink carried a hell of a punch. I started off with the bookbinder's soup which hit the spot considering it was 27 degrees outside. It has a tomato base and is loaded with carrots, celery, green peppers, leeks, mushrooms, and whitefish. The simple flavors are hearty and interplay in a complex way. For my main course I decided on the pan seared Georges Bank sea scallops. So freakin' delicious!!!! Hints of butter and garlic and still rare enough that you get the full oceanic beauty in each bite. This, accompanied of white simple jasmine rice, is one of my favorite dishes at this restaurant. My friend ordered the whole main lobster, which was a beautiful sight. It was accompanied with the hugest baked potato I've ever seen. We split the potato and still had leftover. For desert, we decided to split the crème brulee.

We got the Key Lime Pie, which has a huge mound of meringue on top.  I wasn't as impressed with this pie as many I've had in Key West, but it was still good, and 1 piece was way too much for the three of us. I was even impressed with the Ladies Room Attendant.  I wanted to make certain I got the bill, and where we were seated, there was no way for me to go up to the hostess and request she get my credit card to our waiter.  I asked the restroom attendant if she could get it done for me, and she excitedly was happy to be a part of the conspiracy and help me out!  After dinner, I went in the restroom, and she wanted to know if it all worked out. This place is a bit expensive, but well worth it! Be certain to ask for Ron- he will make your evening a total delight!",0.995,0.76,0.201,0.039,0.6223997493734337

To start, the manager told us that the 5 actual seafood items (not shelfish) were flown in fresh every morning. Really?! Now, having lived on the west coast for a long time, I kinda think I know Alaskan halibut out of season does not get flown in fresh every morning...to Chicago. It gets frozen. Just wanted to know how for how long.  I politely challenged him on this to which he responded...you must not know much about restaurants. Despite the fact I actually own one.  We ordered the wedge salad. It was fine. Hard to mess that up for 12 bucks. My date ordered the ""filet"" which they fileted without telling us and cooked the hell out of it. Despite the fact she ordered medium rare. It was red lobster-fare. It came with a pudding like sauce that was literally disgusting. Fortunately, it was on the side. I ordered a Chicago staple, Shrimp de-jonge having no faith in the actual fish on the menu. The chefs probably don't know that serving cooked shrimp in a a sizzling platter is going to continue to cook the shrimp...fail. it was butter garlic rubber with a tail.  One side note: the table next to us ordered the Chilean Sea Bass. And they laughed and sent it back. Our server was very nice though.",-0.318,0.853,0.071,0.076,0.4189393939393939

I don't really eat seafood so can't comment on that part, but my GF and other friends seem to like them, especially the sea bass.  But their steak, man. It was juicy, well-burnt and charred on the outside but tender inside. And it was also a BIG portion.

I have never been made so uncomfortable by another person's sophomoric attempt to impress women. It did not help that he was wearing a wedding ring, and I don't think that these women, ~10 years his junior, were part of his presumably two party marriage license. Had he been generally gregarious, it would have been one thing. He was like a laser beam to these three women. He was delivering free rosé champagne, gift cards, seafood appetizers, the whole 9 yards. With each new ""omg you are so awesome, thank you!"" his head got a little larger, and he became a little more free with the restaurant's resources.

Before we could even order more, Hugo's ran out of Delaware Bay even though it was only 6:30PM! The East River oysters had a mixture of sizes with some being exceptionally smaller. Both were very fresh.  In addition, a few of us also shared the Alaskan Red King crab bisque, Alaskan Red King crab mac and cheese, and sauteed frog legs. They sound very good on paper but unfortunately, none of them were exceptional. The bisque was extremely salty even though I nearly dipped a half loaf of bread. The mac and cheese could use a little more cheese whereas the frog legs were slightly overdone while lacking a few spices.

2014-05-17,1.0,"UGH! This place is NOT NOT NOT for everyone (but obviously you can see that plenty of people do like it). First of all I'd like to say that our expereince was flawless. Nothen went wrong. Now knowing that, if the following description of this sounds good to you, you'll have a blast.  This place is jam packed- loud and the food is so incredibly uninspired it's depressing. Menu: Meat (or fish) on plate.  Scroll through the pictures from other yelper's and see for yourself: the specialty is an expensive piece of meat on a white plate. The portions are cartoonishly large.  The prices are equally enormous. This place is a dining train-wreck my opinion. The experience was exactly as the place promises it to be, and nothing was unsual about my experience however I will tell you that this restaurant is really not to everyone's taste. Our waitor was actually a little rude, partly because his personality, but it was Saturday night and packed to the gills and it was clear they wanted to turn our table.  Not to mention, they ring this LOUD metal bell whenever it's someone's birthday and the waitors SCREAM (not say, not sing but SCREAM) an angry-sounding happy birthday at the patron. It's horrifying if you're not expecting it (whicih I wasn't...all 3 times it happened). Between the bells and constant roar of the restaurant you won't be able to speak to the person next to you. You won't be able to hear yourself think.  Overall the food is overpriced meat. I had the perch, which was delicious, but literally it was just pieces of perch thrown (literally thrown, or strewn) all over a giant white plate. There was a lemon wedge. The plates are SO massive there was absolutely no room left on the table for people's side dishes and wine glasses. It was almost comical...except not when you're paying $30 for boring white fish on a plate with a lemon wege. Can you tell how disapointed I am!?  ALSO! DESSERT! We ordered ""The Meaning of Life Cake"" $15 slice of cake BUT IT WILL FEED AT LEAST 10 PEOPLE easily.  ...but it's not that good. Really it's not. It's a dry brown cake (emphasis on dry), with whipped cream, almonds, bananas, chcocolate mouse, and rasperry sauce. Served with ice cream on the side. ...yes, it has a lot of yummy bits packed into it. But i'm telling you, the overall dessert is really not that good. Glorified boxed dry chocolate birthday cake with a bunch of layers.  True story out of 8 people...no one had seconds.  I can't imagine how much food this place wastes.  Just don't go. (Unless you like meat on plates and don't want to talk to anyone at your table, then by all means you'll love this palce) ***QUICK SUMMARY*** Be prepared to sit down to a frenzied catering hall with white table cloths and pay $200. Also be prepared to stare at endless walls of tacky ship-themed gear while your table eats dinner in silence because no one at the table can hear eachother.   I don't know why people like this place.   ***I will note, I was here with a small group of friends. I did not pick this restaurant, nor would I ever have.

We were seated quickly, even with a promised 45 min wait it was only 20 minutes.  You have to get used to the Happy Birthday Bell and loud shouting that follows but its better then a song I felt, and this night there had to be about 10 to 15 birthdays!  The food choices were very interesting and popular fish combos with some well mixed ingredients. My GF ordered the crab ceviche and she loved it, we also had a few drinks with dinner which was a 10 oz filet for me and lobster sauce swordfish for her, she was blown away and my steak was worthy of the best steakhouses in the city.  She had not had sword in a long time but this blew her away, the fresh fish choices made the decision very hard because the choices were wide and very well prepared. The final surprise was in the check, in the steakhouses you know you are not getting out under 2 bills for 2 + drinks, but this was not the case, they were, in an expensive area in an expensive city, reasonable, but considering the food, the whole evening was outstanding and we are going to be back, with friends.",0.9979,0.784,0.211,0.005,0.5360861941675895

I had to check out early to make it to the grocery store before they closed. I got my receipt for my order that was just over $20. I then gave my debit card back to the waiter and someone else brought my card and receipt back charging over $500 on my card. I was furious as to how this could happen. And who passes credit cards off to another employee with a $23 receipt and still charge  $500 on the card. Everyone was clueless at this point. No one was assisting me because they were too busy catering to the large number of guests there. I then spoke to the manager who was very nonchalant about it. I asked how does someone charge that amount of money when the bill in his hand says $23. He replied, well you have a chase card so they will only hold your money until the next business day.

The icing on the cake was a server leaned across two people to fill the person on my rights glass of iced tea, over filled in into my red wine.  WTF!  That is a 13 dollar glass of wine.........   Have you ever had a server or bus boy stack your dirty plates on your table?  Yep right in front of me. Inexcusable.  The manager should be fired.  The sad ending is I recommended this to my colleagues from Belgium as top notch.   Our bill was over $600 and the server did not offer to comp anything.

2012-12-16,2.0,"I really don't understand all the rave reviews on this place. See my past reviews and rarely do I give only 2 stars, but this time it's merited. And for a place of this caliber, they deserve this criticism. I nornally don't write this much but I couldn't help it this time. It was a Saturday night and a little after 8. We sat in the bar area, which we preferred due to the lively atmosphere. Love LOVED the singer at the piano bar. Beware, though, if you don't get a seat in a corner, you will have people hovering by your table once they detect you're leaving as it's first come first serve.  The Saturday night crowd seemed to consist mostly of out-of-towners.  Very touristy with a handful of posh-looking 40's-50's crowd.  We ordered the Blackened Tilapia and the Seared Hawaiian Yellowfin Tuna. Each dish came with a side salad (iceberg and romaine???) or a soup. In a semi-classy place like this, you can't afford mixed greens?? Iceberg and romaine--we should have gone to Applebees! We opted for the soup. Tomato fish soup and then clam chowder for my friend. It was average. It could have come out of a can, for all we know.  Then came the main entrees. And talk about a let down. The Yellowfin was SO bland and flavorless. Visually, it was just so boring--a slab of fish on a TGIFridays style, heavy duty plate. And it came with the cheap pickled ginger? For a $38 dish, they couldn't even give us the fresh stuff? The tilapia had seasoning that seemed to come from a pre-mixed seasoning packet, topped with fruit. And NOTHING else. No rice or starch. That was also really bland.  Our waittress was kind enough to voluntarily send us a side of asparagus due to our dissappointment but....that was bland too!! They steamed the asparagus and poured regular melted butter overtop. No flavor!!  Then we decided to get desert: banana cream pie. The only good things about this dish is that it was HUGE. BUT the bananas were CRUNCHY and OVERLY RIPE. And sliced in half (not bite size).  Add that to the fact it was like someone vomited whipped cream, cream and bananas into a bowl. It was SUCH a mess when they brought it to us and looked like it was made by a child. How could they not be embarassed by putting out a dish like that?? Summary: 2 glasses of wine, 2 fish dishes and a desert of all extreme mediocre/sub-par flavor and HORRIBLE presentation = $83. One of the most dissappointing meals I've had in the 6 years I've lived in Chicago.  We will not be returning.",0.9881,0.841,0.113,0.046,0.5251968061178588

They have a small piano tucked into the bar for ambiance.  It's packed, but they get people through. One night they gave us a small table that was in the middle of a high traffic area. After one of the waiter's stood with his a$$ over our table for a solid minute, we had to get up. But they didn't flinch when I asked them to move us. I don't mind waiting to be able to relax while I eat... especially when the bar is fun. Looking over the whole room, that seemed like the only bad table. Don't tolerate it. We ordered the Scallops, Sea Bass, and Crab Legs. All were among some of the best seafood I've ever had. I was at Joe's a few years ago.

Anyway, I am pleased when a steakhouse offers a wide variety of fishies, like Hugos. Hugo's Fish Bar shares a kitchen with Gibson's (super duper famous), and Hugo's doesn't disappoint as far as seafood goes. Tons of fish to choose from - there's no shortage of fresh seafood. As far as ambience, Hugo's is similar to it's old school steakhouse cousins that reside around the Viagra Triangle. Big portions, dimly lit dining rooms and old school style. As you would expect, it is very crowded on a Saturday night and you definitely want reservations.  Service is accommodating, but a little rushed. They want to wham, bam, thank you ma'm in an out of there - it's all about turnover.  We started with crab cakes and escargot. Both were good. We also got a bottle of wine for the table, which was also tasty. For my main, I got the Halibut over a black bean salsa. It was good. The salsa was flavorful, but the halibut was kind of plain. It was cooked to perfection, but it wasn't really seasoned. I didn't hate it or anything, but geez, this is an expensive piece of fish....it can be jazzed up a little bit.  We also got two sides for the table - asparagus and sauteed mushrooms. Both were tasty. We left without dessert. It was good, but not outstanding.

When we first arrived the first thing that you'll get is the live piano player.....nice but really loud if you end up sitting on the same side. We waited about 15 minutes to be seated, which wasn't bad because we ended up with a booth!  Our waiter was excellent! He was very informative about the menu and gave us enough time to fully grasp the menu without being pushy! It was a very nice/lively crowd. A mixture of all kinds of people... from the very casual (saw a couple people with t-shirts to upscale) I personally was dressy casual if that makes sense :-) Back to the food.... We both started with appetizers which came out within 5minutes of ordering. I had the crab legs which are chilled and split open, they came out in a pair and sided with a mayo... AWESOME. My hunny had the oysters, they offer 3 different kinds so he had one of each. All of them which he thoroughly enjoyed! Being an over analyzing Virgo my love wanted a more in depth look at the menu, our waiter obliged and came back with a platter of various items on the menu. Lobster, fresh fish, crab legs, and another kind of fish in which he explained the taste and how they prepare each one. We then decided on our meals which were accompanied by a soup or salad. Both deciding for the soup, he got the ""Bookends"" which was a tomatoed based soup with fresh vegggies and fish. He loved it! I decided on the Clam Chowder which was the best clam chowder I've ever had! Nice and creamy with large pieces of clam and red potatoes. Finally, our meals arrived! I decided to go with the Pan Seared Lobster tails. This item came with 3 petite lobster tails covered in scallions and a white wine sauce! Ohhh it was so good I can taste it now! The boo decided on the Jumbo Crab Cakes which were BURSTING at the seams with crab meat. This came with a pink mayo that he said was very tasty. We also ordered a family sized order of spinach. Let me warn you that although it is very tasty, it has a MASSIVE amount of garlic in it... I mean like HUNKS of garlic. I like garlic.... but I'm not a fan of biting into large pieces of it. I told the waiter at the very start of our dinner that we were celebrating a birthday and I thought he had forgot after we decided not to have dessert. (He's a big cheesecake fan and they only offer it on Sunday) But  the dessert portions are massive as well... the Better than Life Cake feeds 9!... Upon us getting the check and wrapping up our food, a couple scoops of vanilla ice cream with a candle was placed at our table with the signature Hugo bday song ...

I have had better tasting steak at TGIF.  About 50% of the steak was also overcooked. Lobster was tiny. Fairly tasty and well cooked. but again nothing special.   -Crawfish mac and cheese- would not know.

2012-08-20,5.0,"On Friday, after a day filled with touristy walking, it was time to find a place to sit down.  This place caught our attention, with its glowing neon sign reading ""Frog Bar"", and I decided that this place would do the trick, by virtue of the fact that they have oysters on the menu. The intent was just to sit down and rest for awhile, and maybe snack on a few appetizers.  I ended up ordering six oysters, a couple of clams, and frog legs.  But that required a ton of restraint; there was a whole slew of delicious-looking seafood on the menu, and I had to tell myself that this wasn't dinner. The oysters and clams were good.  It's really hard to ruin that, considering Hugo (or whichever corporation actually runs this place) does not control the oysters' free will.  They really flavor themselves. The frog legs were good, but a little light on the flavor.  Perhaps they should've been brought out before the oysters.  But not bad for a 2nd course. The atmosphere is really nice here; the bathroom attendant doesn't just hand your towels: he actually operates the faucet *and* the soap dispenser for you.  Not only did this make for the most effortless hand washing experience I've ever had, it could also be a reasonably good introduction to the art of hand washing for those who don't usually dabble in it.  They also had a piano player who arranged pop songs for piano-and-vocal.  Classy.",0.8504,0.85,0.091,0.059,0.49722222222222223

2012-06-19,4.0,"Came here on a Sunday with my boyfriend for dinner. We had reservations for inside and were seated promptly around arrival time. The outdoor patio looked nice for a warm summer night and I had wished I had made a reservation for outside. We asked what the wait time was for outdoor seating and we were told 45 minutes. Since my bf had a flight to catch that night, we opted for our reserved table inside. I would highly recommend making reservations as the place was packed. The tables are pretty jam packed so it's not as romantic as some would like because you are very close to the other patrons. It also didn't help that we were fortunate enough to sit next to the three loudest people in the restaurant, but I finally got used to them and drowned them out.  I don't remember the name of our waiter but he was friendly and very knowledgeable in answering any questions we had about the menu. We ordered the jumbo crab cake for an app and it was very tasty and delicious. The sauce accompanied with it was very good.  We drank delicious Cabernet, not sure of the exact one since I told my boyfriend to chose, but it was very good. I'll ask him if he remembers and edit if he knows. He ordered the lobster, can't remember which one either, you have a few choices, but it was DELICIOUS! My fork kept finding it's way to his plate throughout dinner! I had the Hazelnut Crusted Halibut which was alright, could've been tastier. I didn't particularly care for the sauce too much but it grew on me. One thing I didn't like was that there was no side dish that came with the meal and you would have to order one separately. The waiter had mentioned this in the beginning but I forgot about that part when we ordered our meals. I remembered when, at one point, I was taking a bite of my halibut and suddenly felt like dipping my fork into my mashed potatoes when all of a sudden I thought to myself, wait a minute... where's my side dish? I flagged down our waiter and put in an order of mashed potatoes which came out within minutes. I really liked that because I was worried that I might finish my fish before they even arrived. They were tasty, and a bit rigid, which I liked. It's true what they say about one side dish can feed two, so it's best to share.  We were too stuffed for any dessert so I cannot comment on that. Steak lovers will enjoy the fact that they offer Gibson's steak. I think they are a sister restaurant to the popular steakhouse.

2012-03-05,4.0,"Restaurant Review Seafood or steak was the great debate as I came here for another pharma sponsored meal. Hugo is known for the fresh fish entrees and this hit home further when they brought a giant platter of the different cuts of fish that were available on the menu that day, however being a beef carnivore, I couldn't pass up a gibson quality steak which is USDA prime angus beef aged over 40 days. I ended up going with the largest one available (the 26 oz porterhouse), but before I get to my steak a quick recap of the other food items Crab cakes- simply delicious, 90% of the crab cake was large chunks of crab meat that put to shame other restaurants. Great flavors and the tenderness of the crab meat chunks just made it heavenly Frog legs- sauteed to perfection. It really does taste like chicken! Bookbinder soup- if you like a tomato base seafood soup with small chunks of whitefish, this is the soup to go with. A simple splash of sherry brings out the sweetness of the fish.  Porterhouse- clearly the highlight of the meal. 26 oz of pure tender goodness. This simply trumps all over steakhouses including Suillivan, Ruth Chris, etc. The beef was so tender that your knife melted through as you made your cut. The chef cooked it to order and the salt and pepper seasoning was just right. I ate all 26 oz and craved more. Sides: Mac and cheese w/ crawfish and creamed spinach are definate highlights Dessert: we shared the giant slab of turtle chocolate cake which was amazing way to end your meal. Enough for a table of 10 Pro- Simply the best aged steak in the city, attentive wait staff Con- super expensive, thank goodness pharma sponsored this meal or else I would have gone bankrupt Hidden deal- Unfortunately none, lunch time is cheaper but the menu is mainly sandwiches and smaller steak dishes which maybe worth a try",0.9969,0.75,0.207,0.042,0.556641604010025

This was around 11:00 pm.  We sat  at the bar and ordered a bottle of prosecco and each asked for a steak salad. The steak is covered in peppercorns and so we asked the bartender if he would please order it without. My friend and I were having a good time and John the bartender is a really great guy. The salads arrived, one of them came as we had asked for and the other had peppercorns all over. John took the salad back and asked the kitchen to prepare a new dish for me. In the meantime, I just  shared my friends. It took a while before it came out. Which would be understandable if they had actually bothered to cook me another steak. Instead, they made me wait so I would think that they prepared a new dish, but all they did was scrape off the pepper and give me the same dish thinking I wouldn't be able to tell the difference. It took just one bite of the warmish steak for me to realize what they had done. That is BAD business guys!!! you do not do that. Can you imagine if I had been allergic! I can't believe that you guys in the kitchen would think its ok to do that. It's NEVER ok to do that. Smarten up! that's how you loose clients! or maybe you don't care cause you figure you're busy enough!! John was really great about everything. He took care of us, and was very apologetic.

2012-02-22,2.0,"My boyfriend lives a block away from Hugo's and we've passed by it so many times. So we decided to give it a try for Valentine's Day dinner. A summary of our night: Drinks: I ordered a French martini which was super yummy. My boyfriend ordered a Manhattan which was super boozy, which I guess is good if you're into that. Food: Both of our entrees came with a salad, which was kind of gross. It was mostly chopped lettuce with a ""house vinaigrette"" which tasted like straight vinegar. For the main course, the boy ordered lobster and I had a filet. The filet was pretty good (a little too red for my liking) and the lobster was OK (though I don't love lobster so I'm not the best judge). We also ordered a twice baked potato which was yummy. Service: We had reservations at 7:00 and didn't get seated until around 15 minutes, but it was Valentine's Day and the place was packed, so I'll forgive them for that. Once we were seated, I was less than impressed with the service. The waiter at other tables near was very attentive and explained everything in great detail, but our waiter didn't even tell us what the specials were. Also, for a more upscale restaurant, they have the most annoying ""Happy Birthday"" routine that sounds like someone calling out football plays. It reminded me of something they'd do at TGIFridays.

I love the live music in the background and how sophisticated you feel sitting there drinking your wine and eating your grown up food! We split both the crab cakes and the avocado with crab meat, and both were outstanding!! The crab cakes were stuffed full of crab, no fillers here, and the dipping sauce was perfect. I have never had anything like the avocado with the fresh crab meat, and I couldn't get enough. I have been dreaming about this dish since. We sat here til the wee hours of the morning eating our delicious food and drinking ourselves silly all while listening to the awesome Piano man in the corner.  On a side note, I was here on NYE for my friends wedding, and they hosted an open bar before the cocktail reception for us here at Hugo's. The service was outstanding, and they kept the drinks coming. There were approximately 50 of us tucked into a small space in the back of the bar, but they did a great job of getting us drinks throughout the hour we were down there. The reception upstairs was amazing and very old school - sophisticated. I would highly recommend it as any event space.

And of course I can't leave out the DELICIOUS food.  The cream of mushroom soup turned me into a cream of mushroom soup lover. It was so good, I don't even know how you can make something as simple as cream of mushroom soup so dang good! And of course I had to get the perch. It came with four pretty good sized perch; seasoned and cooked perfectly. Almost as good as my dad's (shhh...)!   The ambiance was nice and the people working there were very accomodating of our huge luggage that we were carrying around (we flew in from Seattle).

I came in here for my birthday recently, and the server was notified 3 times it was my birthday by our table and once I presume from the receptionist (it was in our reservation). I NEVER got my ""happy birthday"". This is one of the reasons we went here, they have a wonderful assortment of desserts and GREAT FOOD. So, to get back to why RJ is great, I am not a complainer (YELP! doesn't count) Ha! but i complained and spoke to the most professional, nicest , understanding manager ever. This made me give my review 5 stars. Otherwise it would be a four.  DRINKS: Peach Blossom Martinis are awesome. A large assortment of wine from knowledgeable servers and bartenders that can answer ever question under the sun about wine if your not a wine drinker.  FOOD: Clam chowder- WOW! Everything was served piping hot and the steak was so tender, we ate the leftovers the next day. I also had one of the most amazing crab cakes ever. Salad was cold and crisp.  SERVICE: Good, I guess. The bus boys cleaned and refilled every two seconds but they were definitely not a bother. Despite the fact that our waiter seemed to favor the ""wealthy"" larger group of 12 next to us, he was OK. He made a few jokes the two times he visited our table and was fast. We had a gentlemen in a suit come to check on us twice. It was nice to know that they are attentive to the guests b/c this is not a $50 Joes Crab Shack spot, so I think the attention is well deserved. PARKING- Valet next door at Gibsons.

So we decided to add four more of the oysters, they were fresh and excellent. I had the bookbinder soup, which I had never had before and it was excellent. The server was also nice enough to bring my date out a little sample of the seafood gumbo. I did not like it as much as the bookbinder soup, but I am not a huge gumbo fan.  For my entree I was deciding between the whitefish and the bouillabaisse.  I had never had bouillabaisse before and a quick google search on my phone made it sound somewhat similar to cioppino, which I really miss since I left the west coast and not a ton of places server it in the midwest. The server again was excellent in explaining that it really wasn't that similar and suggested the white fish. The fish itself was good, not the best whitefish I have ever had but certainly would order it again. It came with mashed potatoes and a grilled tomato and onion. The only downside to the entree was the potatoes which were a bit on the plain side. She had the scallop salad, and while she said it was good and she was just full off oysters and bread, she did give me two of the scallops which again were excellent and very flavorful. Again not sure if she was full or didn't like it. Also the service was excellent. I have waited tables before and used to hate when people came in late.

2011-11-06,5.0,"Yeah, I love this place.  Every time I'm in Chicago I stop in here.   Why I love it.... This place gets packed!  Reservations can be made the day of your visit, but expect to either get something really early like 4:30 or something late like 9:30.  I love to eat late, so I have no problem with the 9:30 time.  The fact that it's packed doesn't bother me at all.  As a matter of fact, I love the hustle and bustle of a great restaurant.  I love to look around and see people truly enjoying their dinning experience. Secondly, this is connected to Gibson's (part of their restaurant family).  Maybe it's not a kept secret, but I'm not sure if people realize you can get the fantastic Gibson steaks here.  If you have trouble getting a reservation at Gibson, which is likely, go to Hugo's and order the steak there...same ones!   Thirdly, their food is amazing.  The steaks, as mentioned above, come from Gibsons.  They are massive (I'm not a big fan of over indulgence, but I make an exception here).  They are prime or above and perfectly aged.  And the kicker...cooked perfectly every time!  Perfectly seasoned with simple salt and pepper, as a steak should be.  No ridiculous gravy or bbq sauce on them.  Just simply straight up, delicious beef.   The seafood choices are delicious as well.  One catch, and it's simply a preference thing, I don't care for the ""colossal claw"" they offer being served chilled.  I would prefer it to be warm.  I ordered the frog legs once and they were as tasty as you can make frog legs.  I've had frog legs many many times before and these were about as good as you can get.  They were grilled and in a lemon-butter sauce.  I like grilled anything over fried, so I was happy about that.  They were a little ""watery"", but again, they're frog legs and better that than dried out and chewy.  Oh another thing, the sauteed garlic spinach was was simply drenched in oil and the garlic was extremely overwhelming.  Too bad too because it would have been a great compliment to my steak.  We did have the mac & cheese side and it was so good I can't describe.  It would be very easy to overindulge on that, for sure!! Finally, the service.  It is fantastic!  Our server was Michael.  He was on it!  He was very knowledgeable and honest about what he felt was good and not so good.  I appreciate it when a server will tell you what isn't that great.  I depend upon their recommendations almost always.  Also, when I mentioned that the spinach was not good, he immediately responded and said, ""Don't worry about it, if you don't like you won't pay for it"".  Now I am never one to complain, fully eat something and expect to not pay for it.  No one at our table ate it, so I felt it was appropriately removed from the bill.  I ordered a cappuccino at the end of my meal and the first one had ""old foam"" from other cups that gets on the steamer it it.  It kind of freaked me out, but he promptly brought me another and it was delicious.  Again, he did not charge me for my drink, but I told him I was happy to pay for it because I drank every delicious drop of the new one he brought.  He still didn't charge me.  I was thankful, but it wasn't necessary. I guess I should mention the wine.  They have a very good wine list and their less expensive bottles are very well matched with their menu.  There isn't a real need to get about $35 per bottle.  We actually had the $28 bottle of 14 Hands Cabernet.  Very good wine for the price and as I said, stood up nicely to my steak (I had the house specialty bone-in ribeye, medium rare) Go to this place.  I have sat in all areas of the restaurant, including the bar area.  I have been going here for years and there used to be a bartender there named John and he was an amazing server.  You can order full menu in the bar area and even at the bar, which is what I did.   Great experience.  It's not inexpensive, though.  Be prepared to spend $75-$100 per person depending upon your level of drinking and desert needs.  My bill was $72, there were four of us in our party and we shared that bottle of wine and split a desert and was only charged for one side, so we didn't get crazy.  My part was $60 and I left a $12 tip.   One more thing...for a place with such high class food, it is not at all stuffy and unwelcoming.  It is a great, fun atmosphere.  Dress casual or dress up.  Be loud, be intimate.  Just go!",0.9997,0.706,0.245,0.049,0.620023694739604

So I went next door and was able to get a table, however, the place got packed quickly (it was a Thursday night) and I once again was glad that I'm thin because people definitely had to squeeze by my table and the one next to me to get by.  I love seafood, but the seafood on the menu really didn't appeal to me, so I opted for a steak. I started with the lobster bisque which was absolutely dreadful. It tasted fine, but in my book if you're going to have lobster bisque I need to be able to see the lobster. It was basically a cup with orange soup in it, the lobster was in there I think, but I couldn't see it.  My steak was cooked perfectly (medium-rare of course) and was fantastic. I ordered a side of mushrooms which were rather oily and greasy but still tasted good. My service was excellent, but I can't say I would come here for the seafood, and given the choice I'd rather go to Gibson's.

The sauteed frog legs- I can't believe I even tried one.  All I can say is never again. The seafood dishes were just regular, rather blah seafood I feel I could have gotten somewhere else at half the price.  (sea bass and  salmon).  I ordered the bouillabaise, which  I usually love but this was the worst one I've ever had.  Did not care for the flavor of the broth (and there was a lot of it) at all. Side dishes were not anything special.  The mac and cheese with crawfish and sausage was the most filling side dish you could possibly ask for.  The first forkful was good and then it just tasted too heavy.  Good  flavor though and this was the tastiest dish of the night. Now the dessert........The key lime pie looked amazing when we saw it so we had to get it.  It is beyond huge.  However, it was the worst tasting key lime pie..or any pie I've had in my life.  Terrible, soggy crust and filling...The pie itself is about 90% meringue topping, which makes it look great but the meringue tastes like nothing.  Out of the 4 of us, none of us wanted to eat much of it.

2011-09-09,5.0,"Wow, what can I say. There are plenty of choices when it comes to fine dining in Chicago, especially along Rush Street. An experience dining at Hugo's certainly puts it up there with the best.  Dined with a group of seven other folks on a family style menu; each dish tasted perfect. Starters were the crab cakes (indeed tastes every bit worth the hype everyone has been giving them), frog legs (looks and tastes like chicken, and I mean that literally), and spinach dip w/garlic bread (the dip was nice and creamy). We also had a bowl of clam chowder soup...very good. Entrees were the whole chicken (nice), crawfish mac and cheese (really amazing, the crawfish was a nice addition to the dish), BBQ baby back ribs (very good), planked whitefish (never tasted one so awesome), mashed potatoes (nice); broccoli and steamed asparagus (very good), and my personal favorite dish, the andouille sausage and scallions (the spices gave it a good kick!).  The best part of the meal, as is for most people, is the dessert. We got served a MASSIVE slice of key lime pie. I'm not kidding, it was literally a BLOCK of pie. Holy freaking smokes. The funny thing is, after devouring the entire piece, I actually wanted more. It was that good.  As with many of the restaurants along Rush Street, the setup of the restaurant was pretty upscale. I felt sort of under dressed coming in with jeans and a polo shirt; many of the diners were in business suits and ties. Kudos do go out to the wait staff for serving us.

The servers were mind-readers.  They even asked if I wanted extra pink sauce to go with my leftover crab cake.   ***As an aside, I was walking down the street with the Gibson's to-go bag when a homeless man said....""GIbson's?  That's all riiiiight.....""  so I gave him my uneaten crab cake, with extra pink sauce.  I hope he enjoyed it as much as I did.",0.9967,0.738,0.25,0.011,0.5162139917695474

(Yes, I know there was vodka in the drink, but not much.) We had the avocado-crabmeat appetizer.  It was okay, but nothing special. Entrees included crab cakes and seared tuna. The crab cakes are enormous. The plate comes with two, and it would be enough for a couple to split as entrees. The crab cakes were good, but not great. Maybe a 7/10. They do not skimp on the crabmeat though, so that is good. The tuna was also good but nothing special. It was a really good piece of fish, but the kitchen did little to make it special. I can buy a good piece of tuna, throw some salt and pepper on it, and sear it myself. When I go out to eat, I want something a little extra. I will say that the waitstaff was excellent. Our waitress was prompt and courteous, and the rest of the staff was as well. In short, there was nothing bad about Hugo's, but for what we paid, it should have been much better. Especially in a town like Chicago with a thousand options. Hugo's is a but of a tourist trap in a central location, and it is nothing to write home about.

We showed up around 745 or so and were quoted an hour wait, but it seemed more like 30 minutes when we got a table. The place was packed, but we were able to find a spot to wait in the bar that wasn't totally jammed. A server came by and got us some wine, which was nice.  Our spot was outside. Despite it being on the cool side outside, the temperature was perfect near the heat lamp. Our location gave us a great opportunity to people watch and check out the scene. At some point, a bunch of naked people biked by, and we were informed by our server that this was the annual Naked Bike Ride. I'd say there was either too much nudity or not at all enough, but that's just me.  Speaking of our server, his name was Raul and he was awesome. He was very personable, had great recommendations, and just made our experience fantastic overall. For our appetizer, we got the frog legs. This was the first time either my boyfriend or I had tried them, and we were quite impressed. As everyone says, they do taste like chicken, but it's kind of like eating a chicken wing that was made of dark meat. The butter and garlic sauce was super complimentary (but when is such a sauce not?) My boyfriend got the Cajun chicken and crab, which he was very fond of. Everything was very fresh, and there was a great mix of spices. I must say, though, that the bouillabaisse that I ordered stole the show. Fantastic, flavorful broth with generous portions of tasty seafood. Be sure to get it with the lobster.  We were stuffed after our meals, which we decided was a good thing after we saw one of the desserts. The table next to us ordered a piece of cake, and the piece looked like it had been cut for King Kong or something. They ate some of it, then gave the rest of it to the table next to them.  The bill was a bit on the high side, but it was well worth it for the quality of food, great service, and just overall wonderful experience. I'd highly recommend you check this place out, and if I'm ever back in Chicago, I might just have to go back.",0.999,0.759,0.236,0.005,0.5284606481481482

2011-06-13,5.0,"A few tips to dining in this fantastic establishment: 1. Opentable I had a last minute need for a 7pm reservation on saturday...at 4 pm. Needless to say the restaurant said they were booked. When I checked opentable, someone must have JUST canceled a rezzo as there was a 7pm booking available. SUCCESS! 2. Come Early Especially if it's a weekend, come check in a half hour before your seating if you have a time pressure. We had 9 pm tix for a show, so I came at 6:40 and checked in and secured a seat in the packed bar. Coming early accomplishes 2 things- you actually may find a seat in the bar for your wait and also you stand a better chance of actually being seated on time. Even so, we finally were seated closer to 7:20 and were out by 8:40. 3. Ask for the Booth Request it with your reservation and even wait a little longer for it if you must. The place gets PACKED and a booth is an oasis in the crowd. Sooooooo worth it! 4. Request the Olive Oil/ Balsamic They serve insanely delicious fresh bread. I am not a butter fan so our server was more than happy to hook me up...heaven. 5. Get the Seafood! I love tasters to share, so we ordered East Coast Oysters (yum), the Softshell Crab (delish) and definitely get the Clams in white wine garlic sauce...amazing! If you really were set on steak, they have it, but at that point  why not just make a rezzo for Gibson's? Stick with the seafood.... 5. Bottle of Wine Just do it. Concannon Pinot Noir was lovely. 6. Birthday Song! Yep, it was my friends bday the next day, so I asked the waiter for a dessert list. The Military style Hoo-Rah Birthday song is pretty fun. 7. Dessert As others have said, ""as big as your head."" The Apples in the apple pie  were tart and hard. I think I would try a Strawberry shortcake or something else instead next time as I like my apples a little softer and sweeter.  8. Leave a big tip Some of the best service in the city, hands down. I always make friends with the server, call them by their name and engage them, therefore getting the best service. (Still shocked most people don't do this.) Both the server and busser used crumb removers to clean the table to get us ready for dessert. Nice.

The salmon was huge in terms of portion and it was very flavorful.  I was pretty stuffed with the salmon and could barely finish it all, but yet I made a little room for the key lime pie.  This portion was just ridiculously huge, and then with guilt I have to say I had this for breakfast the next day...don't judge me.  I also had a piece of my boyfriend's skirt steak and it was cooked at the right temperature with excellent flavor.  Plus, $20 for a skirt steak is pretty average.  It just makes it that much easier when I don't have to convince my boyfriend to come back with me.  It's all a part of my master plan...(insert evil laugh and rubbing hands together here).",0.9781,0.805,0.146,0.049,0.5481240981240981

The Shrimp dish consisted of several large shrimp in a garlic scampi sauce with a light garnish of dressing on top and it was so tasty. The Macadamia Crusted Tilapia was o.k. I've never tasted it prepared that way before and although I like tilapia, this dish did not tickle my taste buds. Two crab cakes came as an order with a zesty mayo sauce. The crab was fresh and plentiful, so much so that we couldn't finish both cakes. For dessert we had the hugest piece of key lime pie I've ever seen. The best part about the pie was that the tartness was not overpowering and it was not too creamy, it was just right.  The selection of food is vast and the service was great.

We all ordered our food and my mom and aunt's meal did not come with soup or salad, but our amazing waiter, with his amazing service (and it seemed like ALL the waiters were great) gave them a complimentary soup/salad choice because my sister's and my meal came with one. The waiter said, it would not make any sense for them to watch us eating a course they could not take a part of.....how nice.  My mom ordered the clam chowder, which made me question my choice of a house salad! The soup was so rich and creamy.....I wanted to steal it from my mom! So soup and salad course done!!! Then....came the GARGANTUOS main course. I got a twice baked potato that was large enough to feed a family of three!! I though it was a SIDE dish......it was a GOOD dish. All of our portions were huge! The four of us could have ordered 2 meals and been okay with that, but it was great to have the variety. I had to save most of my meal, but I was excited to know I would have some good leftovers in the fridge. The last item that came to the table was a OMG-this-is-freakin-amazing key lime pie. I don't even LIKE key lime pie, but this pie was to die for! It was HUGE of course....it actually scared us, but the crust was so buttery and flaky I wanted to cry! Hugo almost brought me to tears! Thank you Hugo for a great belated birthday dinner......I will see you again, I promise that!",0.9961,0.709,0.227,0.064,0.6806878306878306
2011-02-28,4.0,"My boyfriend and I have always wanted to go here and we finally went for Restaurant Week. Came in on a Sunday night and was seated immediately.  Our server was really awesome and friendly!  I like the fact that they carry a platter out with the fresh seafood of the day and you can literally see the freshness of the food before you order.  Our server was really knowledgeable and she didn't rush or make us feel pressured on time which I always appreciate. We ordered items from the prix fixe menu and the ""regular"" menu.  You get a soup or salad with an entree off the regular menu. Shrimp and scallop ceviche - Was alright, kind of just like a citrusy salsa but with seafood. Norwegian Salmon - pretty delicious, cooked perfectly. Key Lime Pie - apparently, all their cakes and pies are served on huge portions.  The Key Lime Pie ""slice"" was literally as big as my face.  Pretty yummy and not too tarty (more on the sweet side).  They may have overloaded too much meringue though.  Meh, could've gone without. Sea bass with miso sauce - this was AMAZING.  The best dish of the night.  Like an orgasm in your mouth.  I highly highly recommend getting this.  Sure, it's the most pricey fish on the menu, but it is soooo worth it.  Note: the sea bass was a fresh item of the night.  Sauce complimented the fish so well without losing the fresh flavor of the fish. Bookbinder's soup - a yummy fish ""stew"" although could have used a little more salt. Crawfish mac & cheese - sooooo good especially if you are a mac & cheese fan.  Although it isn't prepared with that crusty top that I always like, it was still pretty yummy.  Another must-get for a side. I'm giving this 4 stars because although some components aren't necessarily ""amazing"" there were dishes that make this restaurant enough to go for over and over for your seafood fixes!  Honestly, do yourself a favor and go get the seabass and mac & cheese!   Just gotta make sure you order something good!",0.9991,0.683,0.306,0.012,0.611503022722535

They were flexible with taking a large group, and very cool when we ended up having some last minute changes that left us with fewer people. Now for the fun part... All I had been craving was a whole lobster. Not a big fan of cold water tails, so really I didn't want anything else. I put in my order, and about 15/20 minutes later they came to tell me that they had run out! (Let me just say, I was less than thrilled that it took them that long to figure it out...) They brought me a menu, and made all kind of suggestions, none of which appealed, but they finally talked me, reluctantly, into something, and that was that... OR SO I THOUGHT... The next thing I know, our server is coming to tell me that they felt so bad that the manager had run across the street to another restaurant to get me a whole lobster!!! WOW! How that is going above and beyond? Overall, the food was good, the service wonderful and they really went out of their way to be accommodating.

2011-02-25,5.0,"I feel I may be a little gracious with handing out 5 stars to restaurants when I write reviews.  Because Hugo's Frog Bar definitely deserves 5 stars and then some.  Dinner #5 of restaurant week was here and we had another couple to join us for the evening.   As usual, we arrived early and got seated immediately.  And seated in the best seat in the house.  Seriously.  If you are not familiar with the restaurant, there are booths, tables and then there is an old wooden elevator where a table of four can sit and enjoy a fabulous meal privately while in the dining room.  That's where we sat.   Michael was one of the best servers I have ever had.  He was friendly, joked and just made us feel like we were old friends.  We started with cocktails before ordering dinner which help set the pace for the evening.  We all ordered from the prix fixe menu.  I ordered the king crab spinach dip with toasted points, shrimp dejonghe, and key lime pie.  I ordered a side of the crawfish mac and cheese with andouille sausage because honestly, it looked too good to pass up.  The dip was hot and delicious but I should have gotten the crab fingers.  Any place else they would be called crab legs.  They were sweet, succulent and the dijon dip was delicious.  The shrimp dejonghe was buttery, garlicky and huge.  They were so tasty.  The hubs ordered that as well and demolished that dish.  The mac and cheese was rich.  The andouille gave it a nice kick and the crawfish were plentiful.   My other dining partners in crime ordered the macadamia crusted tilapia and filet medallions.  Everyone enjoyed their dinner and three of us had to go boxes.  To go with dinner, we ordered La Crema Pinot Noir.  It's a great bottle of wine and even Michael told us it's on sale at CVS for $20.  Funny since the two men at the table work for corporate CVS/Caremark.  The key lime pie was a sight.  It looked like it was a foot high and just as wide and deep.  Two were brought out for the four of us.  Honestly, it was the most beautiful looking dessert.  After that first taste, it made you forget your winter blues and made you realize the spring/summer is just around the corner.  Anyone with seasonal depression should eat this pie.  It would make them feel better instantly. Dinner took three hours and it was fabulous.  Michael respected the fact that we wanted a very leisure meal and came around just enough to make sure everything was to our liking.  The timing between courses was perfect and overall, everything was top notch.  The food was so fresh that you knew it came straight from the water.  Their seafood is flown in daily and it really makes a difference. If I ended with Hugo's Frog Bar as my last dinner for restaurant week, I would have been ending on a high note.  I just feel everything after this place will fall short after my experience here.",0.9983,0.782,0.194,0.023,0.5555967078189299

We also had the shrimp scallop ceviche and spinach dip.  It was all very good and I would definitely get it again.  they key lime pie is HUGE and there is a lot of creme, but it was very good.  I really liked Hugo's and the fact that it shares a kitchen with Gibson's.  Its definitely a good place to go if you want either surf and turf. The overall service was really nice.  They even give you a reminder call the day of your reservation.  The regular menu also has a great variety and is pretty reasonably priced for that area.  None of the beers are on tap, but they do serve their beers in frozen glasses.  They have a pretty good wine list too.

Reservations: bad, bad and bad! We had reservations for 7:00, we were seated at 7:45 and appetizers came at 8:00. I consider this business not serious. 2. Price: a bit pricey but reasonable. 3. Location: good, however no street parking. Suggestions: valet, I think it was $12. 4. Ambiance: very crowded. I would say the ambiance is OK. I would not suggest this place for a romantic and quiet dinner. Pros: 1. Food: very good (not excellent or delicious). Definitely the best of Hugo's, cannot deny it.

We arrived at Hugo's fairly early, we were one of 2 or 3 tables. Upon being seated we immediately noticed that 2 of the 4 glasses on the table were dirty, obviously dirty. When my girlfriend's soup was served, the spoon was dirty.  Having worked in food service we both attributed this to the laziness of the dishwasher the night before, although whoever set up the table should have also seen the obviously dirty glasses. The dirty glasses and spoon are the only reason they receive 4 stars for this visit instead of 5. Our server was adequate, not above and beyond. I'm not going to complain about that, I don't expect the server to tell me a story or do a dance for me. I had the fish and chips and my girlfriend ordered the Lobster tail. The food was excellent. The menu is fairly simple, but does give a picky eater like me many choices to choose from, with good portion sizes. I also must comment on the bathroom attendant.

Life has never been the same. I came for a celebratory dinner with YL and we went to splurge a bit. We ordered a nice bottle of wine and both of us got steaks. The steaks were amazing - perfectly juicy, tender, flavorful. I love a rib-eye and Hugo's version did not disappoint. Our waiter was friendly and funny and made some great suggestions on the side dishes. One of those suggestions was the mac and cheese.  Hugo's mac and cheese is infused with crawfish, all diced up and intermixed, and chives. For those who haven't had it, it's a shrimp-like texture and a similar, but less potent, flavor. It's actually a perfect compliment to the cheese with the chives offering a nice kick to balance everything out. Completely amazing, and despite how good everything else was, this certainly stole the show.  After that, when getting my burger at the bar, I always opt to swap the fries for the mac and cheese. Maybe not the healthiest combination in the world, but if I'm going to die of a heart attack from something, I hope it's this.",0.9872,0.757,0.197,0.046,0.6640614216701174

2010-10-25,4.0,"I was meeting up with my old tutor from high school for dinner the past week.  He said let's go grab steaks over at Hugo's Frog Bar.  I've been here in Chicago for just three months so upon hearing the name I thought: Hugo's Frog Bar?  Sounds like a casual Outback or Chili's style restaurant which is good cause I don't have that much money to spend.  The name may be a little foolish in my opinion... but this place is no joke and DEFINITELY not an Outback steakhouse.   Once I started to approach the restaurant (we were meeting there), the closer I got, the more apparent it became I was underdressed for the place.  Everyone around the restaurant was wearing sports jackets and highly dressed up.  The inside was a classic upscale look for a steakhouse.  Once I got a peak at the menu my jaw literally dropped.  This is NOT a place for a grad school student living on loans to be eating at.  Thankfully my old tutor was making the big bucks now so he said don't worry and that he was treating me.  I definitely felt bad looking at the prices but I couldn't say no. Starting off... oysters, stone crab claws, and clam chowder The meal... medium rare Chicago Cut steak, asparagus, grilled onions and mushrooms, lobster tail, crawfish macaroni and cheese. I have to say the stone crab claws were absolutely delicious- they were so fresh, meaty, and thick.   The clam chowder was great as well.  There was a hint of bacon in the flavoring which I got a kick out of.  I am not saying the clam chowder is out of the world, just that it's great.  Not Boston clam chowder  great but still great for the area. The Chicago Cut steak was well seasoned and flavorful... but it could have definitely been better.  The steak was closer towards the medium side rather than the medium rare.  Yet I didn't feel like complaining or sending it back.  I was just happy to get a ridiculously expensive steak to eat.  The asparagus, grilled onions and mushrooms worked well with steak.  And the crawfish macaroni and cheese... oh man I think that was my favorite dish of all.  It was salty and you could taste the strong cheesiness but it balanced somehow with the crawfish. Needless to say I won't be back here to eat for a normal tuesday night dinner you can say, but for a special occasion (in a you-have-the-amount-of-money-that-costs-more-than-a-good-suit-to-spend-on-a-meal kind of way) this place will be a great option.",0.9979,0.755,0.204,0.042,0.5527440476190476

Hugo's is a seafood restaurant that also serves Gibson's steaks.   I started with a drink based on Maker's Mark from the Martini menu.  It was sweet--no surprise.  Next time, I'll just have the Maker's Mark, but your g/f will love the martini. Next up was the lobster bisque.  GET THIS!  It was great.  For dinner I had the steak which (ordered medium) was charred on the outside, and crab cake which was phenomenal.  Next time, I'll just have the bisque and crab cake, and I'll book far in advance.

When we got there, we were told to wait in the bar, and had barely ordered our drink when our party was called. Excellent. I love punctuality. We got to our table, and then watched as our waiter berated the bus boy at the table next - there seemed to have been a lack of communication surrounding where the party next to us wanted to sit, and waiter dude was not thrilled about it. It made me uncomfortable, though, listening to it. The food, as usual, was delicious, but as I mention above, it seemed like we either got a slightly angry waiter, or one who was having a really off night. He kept asking us the same questions over and over, and then turning away to yell at other workers, and generally just being slightly rude. My dad mentioned that it was my birthday, and the guy brought the check back. (While I'm not a massive fan of the Happy Birthday-singing waiters, it was still a bit of a disappointment!)

Oh, and we had a giant ice cream pie dessert that came with caramel and chocolate sauces on the side - amazing!

During the entire dinner he is teaching her how to do specific tasks and talking at a decibel level in which we did not care for. When you are entertaining clients that give you millions of dollars of business you don't want to have a waiter that is semi rude and training someone.  My dad would make a joke here and there and you could tell that he was completely annoyed. Guess what, when you are fitting over a $1000.00 in two hours you better believe you are going to laugh and smile at everything.  To top it off at the end my brother got his bill and he left the billfold completely open for everyone to see what the bill was. Again, on a business dinner with big clients, very bad.   Second, the food was okay. I have eaten similar food at various restaurants in city but the food was good,  a bit overpriced.

2010-09-22,5.0,"Okay - my mother-in-law had planned a party for my father-in-law for his 65th birthday.  There were 21 of us at Hugo's Frog Bar on a Saturday night.  We had two tables in the back room on the left, and everything was fantastic. Rating is given based on food, atmosphere and service, all of which were impeccable. We had two waiters serving our tables - Art was at our table, and I did not catch the gentleman with the other table.  They were some of the best waiters I've ever had and made the dining experience that much more memorable. First we were seated, waiters introduced themselves, and we looked over the menu.  Having never eaten at Hugo's (or Gibson's for that matter), but hearing rave reviews, I was looking forward to everything and found I was having trouble deciding.  Did I want steak?  Did I want seafood?  Did we want appetizers?  But first, my in-laws needed to open their birthday presents (they share a birthday).  Art magically came by at some point and cleared the gift wrap and checked the gifts for us.  All without us noticing, as we were busy chatting and enjoying the company. Before we ordered anything, we were brought the meat and seafood trays to see what our options were for the evening, and I was really torn on what to get.  We ended up ordering 2 dozen oysters for our table (Kumamotos and Raspberry Points) and frog legs for the appetizer.  Nothing disappointed.  For dinner, I ordered the Shrimp Dejonghe, my husband the seared tuna, my sister the king crab legs, my sister-in-law the steak & cake, and my brother the New York sirloin (these were all the dishes I sampled), and they all ordered wedge salads to start.  The food was timed perfectly and everything came out at the right time.  The sides were massive and plentiful (I think we may have ordered too many, as we ended up trying to pawn things off on the other table that had the same problem we did) and every single person enjoyed their food.  I know this because I asked. We felt like we were at a family dinner, where the food magically came and things were magically cleared away.  The wait staff was unobtrusive, and while they checked often to make sure we didn't need anything, it felt like the right amount and I never felt like I was waiting for more water or another drink or anything like that. After the meal, when we didn't think we could eat another bite and nobody was up for dessert (though my sister-in-law was really considering as she loves the desserts there, but just could not pull it off), out comes birthday cake.  Now, when you celebrate your birthday at Hugo's, they come in with a slice of cake, the waiters do a cheer of sorts and then you blow out the candle.  However, what Art had in his hands was the most massive slice of cake I have ever seen.  It was clearly cut out of a larger cake, but I can only imagine the pans used to make that cake because this thing was GIANT.  They carved it up and passed around about 15 slices or so, and then we shared it with a random table in the room.  This was a chocolate cake with bananas and raspberries, and was heaven.  We all managed to find room to try some of this, but the craziest part was how much was in that giant slice.  It easily could have fed all 21 of us with a generous slice each and then still fed another table of 5-6 people. The evening was absolutely perfect, the food was perfect, and the service was excellent.  All in all, one of the best dining experiences I've had in a while, and I cannot wait to go back.",0.9982,0.822,0.152,0.026,0.578905874218374

I grew up where (swimmingly) fresh seafood was abundant and I've never had experience good seafood in Chicago. But I gave Hugo a chance and it was wonderful.  We decided to go with the prix fixe menu with a side of oysters. The Moonstone oysters (as recommended by many Yelpers) were absolutely delicious. It was so incredibly fresh and clean tasting. We only ordered 1 each as we had a full dinner coming but it definitely left us wanting for more. The prix fixe menu had 2 appetizers and an entree. We started out with the ceviche and spinach dip. Both were good but nothing special. The ceviche lacked acidity but it wasn't terrible. I then had the lobster bisque and my boyfriend had a salad. The bisque was AMAZING. It was buttery and smooth and lobster-y and bowl licking good. Yeah. It was that good. We were pretty full at this point (I'll explain in a bit) so I didn't really lick my bowl but I thought about it! We then ended our meals with shrimp dejonghe and pan-fried walleye pike with garlic butter. They were both great. The shrimp was big and very, very fresh. The sauce was rather heavy and it had a LOT of butter in it. You could see butter swimming on the plate, which was probably why it was so good. The pike was light and tasty, my boyfriend enjoyed it very much.  Back to why we were rather full quickly. Service was slow, it was very slow. The waiters weren't slow but the intervals between courses was SO slow. The oysters took FOREVER to come. I was so hungry I ended up stuffing myself with bread. That was the most annoying part really. Surprisingly, the check came quickly.  So a quick summary: Recommendations - oysters, lobster bisque, shrimp anything, pike anything!

If it was not for the crust it would have been pretty bland. But with the crust and a few squirts of lemon it was delightful. I only gave 3 stars because I am more into the new/innovative/unique- style places and Hugos (although a good establishment overall) is more a Joe's Crab Shack for mid-upper class people being in the midst of the Viagra Triangle.

First, the service was BEYOND terrible. Our server, not sure if I am allowed to write her name here, had the personality of a wet mop. Seriously.  I get it's annoying to be asked to take pictures, but I hadn't seen my friend in over a year. Suck it up. Take the picture. Remember, we tip you at the end of the night.  I asked her to take ONE. She refused, telling me she would ""have to do it later."" She never did. After being served our main course, we were not checked on once. One of the people at our table even asked her, after we finished the meal, how many tables she had. She didn't want to reply, kept tripping over a reply and finally said, 3 or 4 or  5 or 6. Hmmm, which was it? I know not, but seriously, that's no excuse for lousy service. They were also out of two of the menu items we asked for. I get that it happens, but understand on top of the poor service they weren't batting well at this point. I had previously asked if the key lime pie is real key lime, because honestly, I'm picky. Look, I'm a native Floridian. I have high expectations. If you don't like someone to ask about something you're serving on the menu, get over it. It's your job to answer questions. She actually sighed and was annoyed by my question.  The key lime pie was mostly this thick layer of meringue. I want pie, not five inches of burnt meringue. The crust was overpowered with cinnamon.

And by the way, I read the reviews beforehand and was expecting a crowd of old pervs and their mistresses... not so! The table next to us was a young couple, and there were plenty of tables of just friends. There was one couple within my viewing range that were getting a little hand-frisky in their booth but it didn't really creep me out. I hope that doesn't make me creepy... Our waiter was very upbeat and easygoing. His demeanor didn't falter when we told him we were doing the prix fixe dinner, either. I will say that he was very quick to bring out the bill. I didn't feel rushed, but I didn't exactly feel like he expected or wanted us to hang around after our plates had been taken away. But I like to think that my boyfriend and I are pretty non-fussy patrons and the waiter was just going with our flow.  The food! I ordered the shrimp bisque and crab cakes. My boyfriend got the Bookbinder's soup and frog legs and we split a massive slice of key lime pie. The shrimp bisque was exquisite. Really, it was perfect and more. If you are going to get a soup here, GET THIS. Oh my. It had the perfect amount of shrimp flavor without having that unpleasant fishy taste. It was rich, creamy, and smooth and had some complex flavors going on in there. I could eat this soup everyday for the rest of my life. I had a taste of my boyfriend's and it was also very good, but I was smitten with my shrimp bisque. The crab cakes come as a pair with a side of pink mayo. The crab cakes, like the shrimp bisque, had the perfect crab to filler ratio. They are a bit plain without the mayo, so take advantage of that. The frog legs come on a large plate, with frog half-bodies scattered about like a froggie massacre. They were deeeeeelicious. But how could they not be? They were smothered in garlic and butter. When I had finished my first crab cake, I stopped eating. It was very good, but I just got kind of... bored of it. The same thing happened to my boyfriend. We both thought this was weird and certainly not like us. It probably would have helped to have a side dish of some sort as the entrees were served a la carte to have a change of texture and flavor.  The key lime pie, like I said, was massive. We probably ate a fourth of it. It comes with a massive heap of meringue on top. It was good, but I'm not a huge key lime pie fan. It's the only dessert option on the prix fixe menu.  Oh, and at one point during dinner I got up and headed towards the back to look for the restroom. A busboy in the middle of cleaning up a table saw my confused look, and made a gesture towards the restroom and even opened the door for me. It's a small thing, but I was impressed that he went beyond his job responsibilities. Hugo's is a good place for a date or a nice meal with friends. I liked that it had a comfortable atmosphere, but I could still take the joy in getting dressed up a little. I enjoyed my meal and will definitely come back for the shrimp bisque!

(instead of being at the NCAA D1 Lacrosse Finals @ Gillette Stadium back home in Mass :-(   )  Anyhow, I sat down at the bar as I often do and started off with a gin and tonic (which would be the first of many this evening). Obviously every single one was spot on.          Then came my first dillemma. As you can surmise from the first posting I made I spent my formative years in New England, so I'm partial to New England Clam Chowder.  On the other hand I've discovered the reason why Elaine used the yada-yada over an evening mentioning only 'the bisque.'   Torn I turned to the bartender for thoughts.  Obviously he thought they were both good and would stand by both, but having not had a good cup of 'chowda' in a while he thought I'd probably prefer it (yup, he didn't push the pricier dish on me).   And the chowder was superb, among the best I've had and I think I prefer it to Legal's. When I find something better outside of Cape Cod or Boston I'll let you know.      Then came the second dilemma, the marinated grilled swordfish or the chilean sea bass.  The kicker was that the swordfish was fresh from Massachussetts.  The bartender joked that someone was really trying to test my loyalty tonight.  This time however I went for Chilean Sea Bass, a dish I had been meaning to have ever since sampling some that a friend cooked last summer.  And it was exactly what I remembered, only better.  The bass was extremely tender, perfectly cooked, and was perfectly paired with a very light amount of a delectable sauce (so as to not to overpower the dish).  Again simply superb, with excellent presentation.  Even the vegetables it was served with were delicious.   In short, a superb meal, exquisite and attentive staff (without being overly ""attentive"") and just a fantastic atmosphere.  As soon as I get a solid gang of friends who like seafood together, I'll be back for more.  It was expensive but worth every penny.",0.9986,0.751,0.236,0.013,0.524306388056388

FOOD: We started with an appetizer of OYSTERS ROCKEFELLER which were absolutely DIVINE.  Chopped spinach and celery are combined with some cheese and the oyster.  The mixture is topped with a creamy hollandaise sauce and then baked in the shell.  The fresh lemon wedges brought the entire dish together -- we ate all the oysters up in a snap.  We'd go back for those again.   Dinner we both did the prix fixe for $30, which includes a soup, entree, and dessert.  Standouts were the GUMBO soup which was dark and smokey just the way I've eaten it down in New Orleans.  CRAB CAKES were also amazing, as the crab was plentiful and the cakes were big.  The dipping sauce on the side with a wedge of lemon complimented the cakes perfectly.  For dessert we had ordered the STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE and the KEY LIME PIE.  Both were absolutely humongous and you should go in knowing each dessert will feed about 3-4 people.  The strawberries were fresh and the shortcake was crumbly and sweet -- tasted good the next day.  The key lime pie we took home but tasted great out of the fridge -- it had an unusual graham cracker crust with chopped nuts which gave it a nice texture.   If we go back again, definitely would go for the crab cakes and the oysters rockefeller again... SERVICE:  Waiters and service were super excellent.  Water glasses were always filled and after every dish was cleared our waiter cleaned the crumbs off the table.  Although we ate an early dinner so we might have gotten more attentive service, if they can keep up the service during the dinner rush hour then the dining experience is worth the bill.",0.9922,0.853,0.139,0.008,0.6049539512774808
2009-06-04,5.0,"Having been on the fence about whether to Yelp or not to Yelp for some time now, I have decided to join the dark side after my amazing dining experience at Hugo's. I recently dined at Hugo's on a Monday night, although I usually would not be concerned about making dinner reservations on a Monday night, I am glad I did due to the fact this place was jumping.  Hugo's was packed even as I left at 9pm, people were still being seated to order dinner.   The quality of the food and service at Hugo's was second to none of my other dining experiences in Chicago. Being a seafood snob, I was pleasantly surprised at the variety and freshness of the seafood that Hugo's offered.  I was informed by our knowledgeable waitress that all of seafood at Hugo's is flown in fresh daily.  After walking all over Chicago and playing tour guide to my family from out of town I had worked up quite an appetite.  I started out with an assortment of oysters on the half shell.  The oysters were served in a photo shoot quality presentation on a bed of ice and condiments, including frozen crystallized malt vinegar that melted in my mouth.  I found this to be unique and memorable start to the meal.  I then decided to do the 3 course prix fix menu for $29.50.  Considering the size and quality of the courses this was a steal to say the least. For my first course I chose the split pea soup.  A puree would have been a more accurate description, none the less it tasted like spit peas and nothing else.  I did not have to add any salt or pepper, as I have in the past when consuming soups and purées. The main course was two ""Egg McMuffin"" size crabs cakes that actually had crab in them!  Being from the Midwest I am used to eating crab cakes that could be considered ""bread cakes.""  I barely touched the red pepper mayo that was appropriately served on the side given the lack of need to blanket the fresh taste of crab that was present. Just as I began to wonder how my meal could get any better, I was blown away with my ""slice ""of key lime pie for dessert.  The menu described it inaccurately in the fact that ""slice"" means quarter of the pie.  Being the only one who ordered this, it easily fed everyone else at my table.   All and all, I am grateful that I took a friends advice and dined at Hugo's.  I will defiantly be returning there in the near future and look forward to another memorable meal.  My only hope is that I am able to get reservations.",0.973,0.894,0.082,0.024,0.4680180180180181

2008-12-17,5.0,"I came to Chicago for a long weekend, primarily to escape NY and to catch some ballgames at parks i had never been to. I was a Chicago virgin. Now, I like big cities, but NY irritates me sometimes - so why not explore another big city ? My agenda was very simple: 1) Wrigley Field 2) Good food & drink 3) US Cellular field check, check, and check. But for this review we'll only focus on 2. I am used to amazing steak in NY, we all know NY has great steak. But Chicago, i imagined, must also have amazing steak. I chose Hugo's based on a recommendation from the concierge at my hotel, which was not far. Bar seating, and some of the best steak around was the word. That's all i really wanted. I arrived about 10pm and spoke to the hostess briefly, who said there are a few bar spots open - help yourself. I sat down at the bar, purveyed the wine list for my dinner drinks, and settled on a bottle of  Brunello di Montalcino. Was very pleased with my choice, yet i admit any moron can choose almost any Brunello di Montalcino and be pleased :) For food, i started with a house salad appetizer, filet mignon entree, and side of roasted chipotle corn. The corn, to the bartender's credit, was his recommendation. I had already settled on that filet. The salad was average - greens and dressing. If you can't get that right it's a pretty bad omen for the rest of the meal. Then, the big guns came out. A large filet mignon & the roasted corn.  Let me talk about the steak first. It was juicy, tender, and delicious. I orderd it medium, as i do for most very thick steaks, and it came a bit more medium rare. However - that is my preference as opposed to many steak places that overcook a medium. I will say it rivals any filet i have had to date in New York City, and i admit i didn't think it would. Now that i've covered how delicious the tenderloin was, let's talk about the roasted corn. What an amazing & delicious side. The corn was slightly blackened, and had a bit of a smokey, chipotle taste to it. An absolute perfect side dish to the steak. I HIGHLY recommend the roasted corn. I chose a Bailey's for dessert, as i wasn't quite ready (as often is :), to put down the booze yet, though i had finished my delicious bottle of  Brunello.  Service ? Bartender was awesome. Great service, great conversation, and his recommendations were spot on. We discussed Chicago, New York, Cubs, White Sox, history of the restaurant, etc.  I don't throw around 5 stars lightly, and i'm not doing that here either. You gotta work for 5 stars. Hugo's fully deserves the 5 stars i've given it. Once you're done with the meal, stick around for some drinks if you want. It has a pretty lively atmostphere.

Solid, but not mind-blowing. Desserts try to make up for quality with quantity. Hugo's food is merely two-star, but they get an additional star for the great service.

Along the same lines, while it's a fancier restaurant than the OG, I've never experienced any snobbery and I could tell my parents didn't feel out of place.  My dad has shellfish allergies and the waitress didn't give him any attitude and was very reassuring we wouldn't have to break out the Benadryl.

From the second we sat down, the service was impeccable. We had water and our drinks within seconds and my dad never stopped muttering ""This place is amazzzzing!"".  For appetizers we had the Malbec oysters which were absolutely delicious. The sashimi dish was perfectly seasoned with some sort of teriyaki wasabi glaze, although it was a bit chewy. I didn't try the crayfish but it was a pretty precious father-son bonding moment when my dad taught my brother how to eat them by telling him to ""suck the head right off of them"" to which I replied, ruining the moment, ""That's what she said."" The entrees were perfection as well. My parmesan crusted halibut with a pesto butter sauce was one of the best dishes I've ever had. The sides were amazing as well. The creamed spinach - yum! The mashed potatoes -- yummier! The only complaint was the corn which tasted canned and bland. We ate and ate and ate til we couldn't eat anymore.

We waited at the crowded bar for the 30min we were told it would take. I was quickly taken by the jazz trio playing some good ol' classics, but I was mostly enthralled by the piano man wearing a Bill Cosby-like sweater. Twenty minutes after the half hour they said it would take to sit us, we were given drinks - on the house - for our patience. I had what has to be *the* best apple martini I had in my life (cliche drink I know, but I've learned to live with it =).Man-oh-man-oh-man-oh-man!

As an entree, I really, really, REALLY wanted the seared tuna, but 15min after placing our orders, our server came back to tell me they were out for the night. I was genuinely saddened by this and told her (nicely!) that having that meal was the only thing that I truly wanted (did I mention I was tipsy by that time?), but ended up getting the walleye pike instead - on the house! And I'm glad I did because it was simply delicious. Boy, a drink and a meal on the house, could the evening have gotten any better? YES! We finished off with the Baked Alaskan as dessert and Holy Mother of the G-Man, it was amazing! The ice-cream... the crust... the EVERYTHING was just great.

2006-07-30,4.0,"Visiting Chicago on a business trip I went with a local friend to the Frog Bar. We made reservations at 6:00pm using Open Table, but due to heave traffic only arrived at 7:15pm. The staff was very accomodating and we got seated 10 minutes later, even so the place was very crowded. A great selection of seafood and also nice wines. We started with oysters and escargot. I am a big escargot fan and these were excellent with a lot of garlic. That evening they had a number of Australian lobster specials. I asked the waiter and he recommended I go with the smallest size, which I appreciated since it turned out to be pretty large already. My friend had grouper. Both dishes were excellent. Unfortunately we did not have room for dessert. If you have a healthy appetite and like the noisy, crowded but fun bistro ambiente, this is the place to go.",0.9942,0.685,0.287,0.028,0.5028195488721804

The food is the same amazing quality as Gibson's but the prices are a bit more reasonable. I like to come in the summer for fish and chips while sitting outside people watching. They even let me get my favorite dessert which is not on their menu, but Gibson's! Super friendly staff and good food. You'll always have a good time.",0.9839,0.714,0.286,0.0,0.45320512820512815

2006-04-10,5.0,"Glad my friend came to visit from back home.  This is going to be one of my favorite places to eat from now on.  I'm not big fan of seafood but I will try shrimp and such but nothing fried.   I go to seafood restaurant but I order steak or hamburger instead.  Am I weird?  Does anyone do the same? Wow, their service was just awesome and piano playing in the background was so soothing.  I had to try their crab cake, it was bit spicy but very good.  Steak was enormous size that filled up almost the size of the plate.  Even my big roommate couldn't finish it at one sitting and he eats all the time.  Steak was very juicy and good quality.  They even have their own Hugo's worcestershire sauce.  We had funny conversation about how to say that word, I can't say it right. On the side note: Don't be afraid to check this place out, it's awesome and offers valet parking.  Gibson's steakhouse is right next-door and Lux Bar is just around the corner.  The same people own all of these places.",0.9912,0.788,0.195,0.017,0.6417261904761905
