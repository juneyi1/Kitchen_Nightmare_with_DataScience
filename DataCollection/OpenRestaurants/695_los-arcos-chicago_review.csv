I noticed things changing a few months ago, menu changes, familiar waitresses now gone, smaller portions, things were just different.  Tonight will be the last night we ever eat there. While eating my burrito suizo I pulled a long black hair out of the middle. Disgusted, I set it aside and lost my appetite. I had eaten a good portion of it, so I felt pretty grossed out about the possibility that I might have eaten a hair and not known it.  I get up to use the restroom before we leave and as I look at the floor  I immediately wanted to vomit. There, on his back in the ladies room was a good sized cockroach. I felt even more sick to my stomach. I hurry up to get out of there and as I leave the restroom I scan the floor to see if any of his friends were with him. I counted a total of 8 cockroaches on the floor in the back by the restroom. Three were severed from people stepping on them and a few were scurrying away.  I'm sure there are worse things that have occurred while preparing my food, although disgusting, it's always a possibility, but this!

This time, the service was much faster, but they did not put in all the ingredients in my burrito. To ""rectify"" the problem, they gave me the other ingredients on a side plate. I did not have time for them to remake my order, so I asked if I could just get a discount on the burrito they made incorrectly. She told me she would have to ask, but did not immediately go ask the manager. I took a couple bites while I was waiting, thinking she would finish her current task and then see the manager. When she did not, I asked again. This time she told me, no - they would not give me a discount because they gave me the ingredients (and she pointed to the side plate.) I told her I was not going to pay for the food that wasn't made correctly and started to leave. I thought maybe there could have been a language barrier, so I gave her time to assess the situation and ask someone else if they'd give me a discount. Again, the answer was no. I told them it was horrible business practice and I would not return. Honestly, you shouldn't go either. There are too many awesome Mexican places in Chi to risk going here and being mistreated.

Tasty tacos, fine burritos, good fajitas, and the chips are hot and fresh when they come out, good prices too!  The atmosphere is relaxing and definitely more than we ever expected. We've been going here regularly for a year, and we don't plan on stopping.  My only beef is that they could have a little more variety than just ""letuce cheese beans and meat"".

2009-02-06,3.0,"This is a cute looking place, but for us, we came here because every other Mexican restaurant we tried to go to was closed - Riques, Cafe Frida, Ole Ole. Apparently very few restaurants are open for lunch midday anymore. And it was freezing cold, we were walking north into a head wind,and we said, aha! Mexican food! Life is good again. Like I said, the place is cute. It did have the ubiquitous TV running in the back, but at least the sound wasn't turned up high. There is a decorative balcony on one wall, interesting pictures, and even some old tools on the walls. The ambiance is okay. It took a couple minutes for us to get water, chips, etc., after we sat down. Certainly it wasn't because the place was so busy. Actually, it was pretty quiet, maybe only 3 other tables occupied. And I was hungry and thirsty. Along with the chips, we got two containers of salsa, one red, one green. They also gave us a small bowl of beans, which I really liked better than the salsas. That was a nice touch that I hadn't seen before. They do have a luncheon menu, which I also liked. Why pay the bigger dinner dollars, right? I ordered enchildas suizas with a cheese fillling. You definitely get a generous amount. There were 3 enchildas, with rice and beans. However, I have to say that the food was not that hot, and I mean temperature. Usually the server says, be careful, the plate is hot (meaning it's been microwaved). Not this time! The food was warm, not hot. It looked as if all the cheese hadn't melted. Did I do anything about it? No, I was hungry, and I chowed down. It was good, but nothing spectacular. My friend Mary O. ordered Bistec Mexicana. It looked like enough food to serve Santa Ana's army, but she was really hungry, too. She said it was delicous, but very spicy. (She had been forewarned about the spiciness, so no fault to the server there). She really liked it, but she had to blow her nose about every third bite, and eat the tortillas to absorb the heat. Again, she really liked it, just was a little blown away by the heat. Well, it was a miserably cold day after all, and having clear sinuses in February can be a good thing. I expected to have a check brought around eventually, but that never happened. My friend explained to me that, in Mexico, the customer is expected to go to the counter and ask for the bill, and that's what we did.  To sum it up, it was a good experience, nothing special. The waitress was very pleasant, albeit, to my mind, kind of slow and inattentive. Oh well. The place doesn't pretend to be the Pump Room. For what it is, it's probably a good deal.

One place I have truly loved every time is Garcia's on Lincoln.  So, today after driving past Garcia's, on my way home from shopping, I started craving Mexican food. After some contemplation, I decided to give Los Arcos a try- after all, it's Mexican food, and only 2 blocks away. I came in, and there were only 2 tables sitting. The waitress, who was incredibly nice, quickly met me with some chips, salsa (as everyone has said, squeeze bottles), and beans. I ordered the Combinacion, and within 10 minutes my food was out. Despite the fact that it was a little bland, it was still very good. Besides, nothing a little hot sauce can't perk up. I ate about half my food, and was ready for a box. I waited. and waited. and waited for my waitress to come to the table. I then realized that you need to go to the counter to ask for a box and bill. No big deal, but a little different. I'm a server/bartender, and while some things I have been taught to do- check on the guest, offer boxes, etc, she did not. But hey, I had no issues, so I wasn't worried. Minus 2 stars for the awful bathroom setup. While I suppose not entirely their fault, the mens door apparently didn't shut, and the bathroom doors happen to be directly across the hall from each other. While I was trying to open the door to the ladies room (it's kind of heavy and the lights were off), I saw a man peeing like 6 feet away, and when I was leaving I saw a different man peeing.

My stomach started to grumble + having skipped breakfast, passed at lunch ...I decided why not have my major meal of the day a bit early. I was out, it was a nice day and well, you get the picture.  I was surprised by the decor inside Los Arcos, which greatly outshines the exterior. It was surprisingly comfy + I quickly seated myself at far table. I was the second customer ...I glanced over to the other occupied table ...A Mother + infant, both covered in refried beans + spilled soda. Fantastic.  I was soon greeted by my waitress, a basket of tortilla chips, two squeeze bottles of red/ green salsa + a small bowl of the refried beans that I had a preview of thanks to the baby nearby. Amusing enough, the beans resembled the wall color.  Orange + rusty. Though given the sun shining through the front window, I think the walls were warmer than the beans.  I ordered my usual: veggie burrito w/ no cream, no cheese + extra avocado, large horchata. I actually ordered this twice, since my waitress came back to double-check.

The decks, the mast, the various gadgets of yesteryear ...Corroded/covered in barnacles + discolored sea algae ...My burrito sort of looked like that.  Me: [text] ""Oo my this place loves their beans! Major beanage!"" It was a good size, sort of Titanic-like, I suppose ...I took a bit + grabbed the salsa verde. All I tasted was pasty beans ...My next bite, I found some lettuce + onion. NO tomato, hmm ...And after a few more bites I found a chunk of avocado. I drizzled a little bit of red ...Which tasted like dirt (I was a champion mud-pie maker in my heyday so I can make such expert comparisons).  I made it through half of my burrito, slurping down my horchata (which was the highlight of my meal) ...For the second half of my burrito, I decided to fish out the remaining avocado (I was paying an extra 30 cents for it, afterall) + eat it plain.  That's as far as I could make it ...I tidied up my plate, finished my horchata, gathered my bag (I coughed a few times but my waitress was very intent on cleaning the beans off of the nearby table) ...I went up to the counter, paid my check ($8.20 + tip) + off I went.
