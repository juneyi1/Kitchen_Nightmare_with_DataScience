The sfogiatelle was tasty but not my favorite: the outside wasn't as crisp as it should have been, and the inside filling seemed more like pudding than like ricotta. The focaccia caught me off guard with how tasty it was, though. It was a full pizza substitute: the bread was thick, flavorful, and oily, and it was balanced very nicely by the tomato topping.

There are also other places that have a large selection of cookies also. I am driving by and I see a sign in the window. Pepper and egg sandwiches. I get one with cheese and I am one my way with a loaf of happiness in my car. Unfortunately I didn't know I had paicked up a imposter. For those who don't know what a real pepper and egg should really be this is the furthest thing from it. The best ones have a flat scrambled egg with actual long pieces of pepper and a SLICE OF CHEESE. In a real place they are going to make the eggs to order, which would would be a flat egg. That also keeps it from falling out of the sub. This what I got: premade scrambled eggs with so much salt on them I am still drinking water 6 hours later. Grilled onions. Who the f... puts onions on a pepper and egg sandwich? And where were the peppers? There were 4 peanut sized peices of pepper. I guess there was a cheese shortage because there a couple pieces of GRATED cheese on my sub. THE WORST EVER!!! Please I beg of you take the pepper and egg sign down before you ruin another persons day or get someone in the kitchen who knows a pepper and egg is not a onion and egg sandwich. Fero's Hungry Hound in Bridgeport still makes a real one for those who know the difference. I guess the moral of the story is don't sell stuff you don't know anything about and dont't go to a bakery for a sandwich.

I got several varieties of cookies, and each was better than the last. Since I was leaving the city the day after I bought the cookies, I wasn't able to eat them until I returned home, but they still were fantastic - I can only imagine how good they would have been the same day! As for the staff, they were incredibly helpful and patient as I picked out all my sugary treats, and the storefront itself - while small - was fun to walk around in and look at all the baked goods. My only regret was that I wasn't hungry enough to try some of their sandwiches or pizzas (next time I'll just get one and eat it anyway!).",0.9776,0.81,0.17,0.02,0.4684343434343434

D'amato's Italian Bakery seemed to be the bakery I've been waiting for!! They have an array of baked goods, as well as pizza! Their pizza came in 3 different kinds.....cheese, pepperoni, and sausage. I got a slice of the pepperoni, which had an old-school square cut, and a homemade taste that was divine!! They also had a great selection of cannoli's and I had to have one.The pizza was a nice surprise, but the cannoli's was the reason why we visited anyways. I had one of their pistachio cannoli's...OH MY!!! So delicious, creamy, crispy shell, and just how it should be!! The pistachios were aromatic with nuttiness, and then with a dusting of powdered sugar, YUM!!!!  Let me add, that not only was the food delicious, but the inside of the store had a fun, old timey feel to it, as if they left it how it used to be, but just kept up with the repairs of the shop! I loved it!!  I can't wait to go back to try their sandwiches, gelato, and so much more!! My mouth is drooling just thinking about it!!

We eat pecans by the handful...so a little pecan exposure not a concern at all. First day, kids eat the all-chocolate cookies. Delish, rich little things. No nuts. Next day they eat a vanilla looking cookie with chocolate on top. Yum.

I'll never make kickoff!"".  What's a guy to do?  I remembered that D'Amato's had started making sandwiches not too long ago.  (Something about a feud with Bari's over bread and deciding to start making subs as an F-YOU.)  I walked next door and quickly had my Italian sub and a cannoli for the road.  I was back at home and in front of the big screen before the game started.  Best of all, the sub was great- comparable to what I had gone to Bari's for and on that great D'Amato's bread that Bari's has replaced with a not-as-good substitute.  All in all, a really great decision and a really great sandwich.  Best of all, because of the quick decision, I also had a fantastic cannoli for dessert!",0.9828,0.833,0.154,0.013,0.39999999999999997

The staff are friendly, the service is quick, the prices are reasonable, and most importantly, the bread is delicious. Yes, it's going to be a few dollars more than at Jewel, but trust me, it's worth it. You can hear it crunching if you give is a light squeeze, so you know it's basically just come out of the oven. It's also super soft inside, and works well for anything: sandwiches, grilled cheese, side to a soup, you name it. The downside to buying fresh bread is of course that it goes stale faster than a typical mass-produced bread from Jewel because it's got no preservatives in it (though I guess that's also an upside). I usually throw it in the fridge right after buying it, and then microwave each piece I cut off thereafter for about 30 seconds to soften it, but it does become kind of a hassle.

They've mastered the art of keeping an old school family bakery genuine through the years, beyond refreshing and charming.  On my first visit, I circled to find parking but realized how busy it was, a constant and steady stream of people. With all the options in Chicago, you know that's a great sign. When I first walked in, not gonna lie, I was slightly intimidated, or maybe just excited. Either way it took me a few minutes to order even though I knew what I wanted. I realized everyone who came in had been there probably a million times. By the time they walked in and out it only took MAYBE 2 minutes. These people were pros. And after trying the tomato olive focaccia, I know why.  I originally stopped in because I heard they were the best when it came to authentic, no BS focaccia. They're are multiple options, original focaccia ($2, 4inch diameter) with tomato then topping combinations from tomato and olive to artichoke to onion etc. The options with multiple toppings are $4, 8inch diameter, huge but I probably could have devoured it alone.

On a Saturday morning around 11am, there were at least 4 different pizzas with a variety of toppings available (sausage, pepperoni, various vegetables, etc). I also purchased a small tomato and cheese focaccia and a large focaccia with tomatoes and mushrooms. They were also excellent. The outer inch or so of the focaccia is quite crusty/crunchy but the interior is softer. They also sell pastries and loaves of bread. Easy street parking. Cash only.

The bread is always perfectly baked with a crisp, delicious crust.  But you have to ask yourself - is the bad customer service worth the good bread? Sometimes yes and sometimes no. Today was a definite no. The young woman with the brown pony tail was not only curt and rude to me, she was also condescending and rude to an apparently new hire, snarling at the poor woman ""Just put it in a bag - maybe you can handle that"" with total disdain, causing the new hire to sink back into the wall even farther. When I asked for a receipt for my purchase - which I wasn't offered - Miss Pony Tail refused to acknowledge my request and simply barked at the next customer for their order. After standing around for a few minutes while she avoided me completely (with the frightened new hire shrugging sympathetically at me) she disappeared into the back room until after I left the store in disgust -  without my receipt.

Their bread is second to none and about $3 (with tax) per loaf. Their cookies are exceptional. Not sure how much Italian cookies are supposed to cost, but these run about $8/lb. There are at least 3 dozen types to choose from. Strongly suggested for family gatherings, huge hit. I will say that it's incredibly annoying that they don't accept credit cards, but whatever.

The fact that some have given it only two stars is a testament that the road to edgy hipness, is ridden with the corpses of ""small plate"" foodies who typed the poor review while drinking a can of the the ""old man's hip beer of the month""  listening to B-sides of 45's by bands no one else will ever hear of and wishing D'Amato's was in a really shitty neighborhood because that might earn it one more star, but I digress. This is as old school as they come, and it should never change. Not for those who remember it from thirty years ago and have a nostalgic fondness from days gone by from their youth. No, this is from the file; ""they don't make 'em like they used to"" and you can tell in every bite, and that's where it counts. The bread is the star here, made a couple of times a day (no, you aren't getting day old ""yesterday bread."") Hit your timing just right and they will hand you a loaf that is still warm. The long French loaf is king. This is what they make the subs on next door at Bari. Perfect crunch on the outside and soft on the inside (it is important to note, in Bari reviews, some complaining that the bread is ""(whine . . .) too hard""  and those people need to revert back to their mommy's PB&Js that were made with the crusts removed and expertly cut into triangles, ""just the way you like them, honey."") And while the bread may be king, the sweets are the noble queen. Try and make it home without popping out a canolli for the ride. Or just challenge yourself to eat only half of an apple or cherry slice. Need to bring some snacks for a meeting at work? Have them fill you a box of a pound or two of assorted cookies, but only if you can handle the hero worship of your co-workers that will follow. And a word or two of advice: Do not, and I repeat DO NOT go there hungry. The smell alone will cripple you, rendering you defenseless from spending every nickle in your pocket (Yes, it's cash only.

2007-12-21,4.0,"So one of my fondest memories from growing up was going into a small Italian bakery by our house in Mamaroneck, NY and buying fresh out of the oven rolls for a quarter.  It was always a special treat for me walking home from school.   So my mom decides that she needs me to find some Panettone to bring east for Christmas.  I begin the hunt for this elusive bread and find myself on the west side of the river at D'amato's.  Immediately when I walk in I have a rush of childhood memories and feel like I am back in that bakery again in NY. We ended up with the panettone as well as some yummy cookies to tie us over until then.  Everything was great and I walked out of there with a ton of stuff for less then $20.  I wold have bought some more BUT they only take cash so I had to stay within the boundaries of what was in my pocket. All in all, mom will be happy I found the panettone, I got some cookies, and I got to try a new place and find a piece of my childhood again. PS- the next day I saw some Panettone in Dominick's but I would not have traded my time at D'amato's for anything.",0.9022,0.918,0.082,0.0,0.4368867243867243

The sheet pizza on top of the counter is classic as well.  Dee-lish as Retched Rachel would say.  Seriously though, it's pretty damn good for pizza made in Chicago.   I like their sub rolls, obviously, and they have lots of other tasty baked goods.  Try them all.  If you're dying for a French-style baguette this isn't the place.  But it's an Italian bakery so you already knew that.",0.8625,0.792,0.148,0.06,0.43712121212121213

The tiramisu could be more. I like whip cream, but calling a fluff of whip cream and some soggy thin cake tiramisu, just doesn't do it for me. The foccacia bread is ok. Eat is fast! It always seems to spoil in a few days of sitting out. Nothing worse than going for a bite and seeing fungus on your bread. Traumatizing. The pizza is good.

2007-09-21,4.0,"Secret pizza, secret dessert... As far as Italian bread carbs are concerned, if I am gonna eat 'em, I get my fix HERE.  First, this is one of the oldest Italian bakeries in the city.  One time I needed to get some bread, but they were closed.  The owner saw me and waved me in.  He brought me to the back and the smell was INCREDIBLE.  I'll tell ya, the only other places that have that kinda history are bakeries in Europe.  Making bread is as much an artform as it is a labor of love.  The wood tables, paddles and ovens were just amazing.  You could smell the care and the love this place has for bread, and we are lucky enough to be able to get it every day.   Back to the food:   BREAD - Remember, it's an Italian bread.  French bread sometimes is like cake, while Italian bread is firmer.  The regular loaf (like a baguette) has a crisp and chewy crust, and a soft center, great for garlic bread or bruschetta.  The sandwich loaf looks like a traditional bread, but has this amazing thin but crisp and chewy crust, with a perfect center.   SECRET PIZZA - Secret pizza, remember?  They make 3 (it used to be 2) kinds of pan pizza - cheese, sausage, pepperoni.  It's not ordinary by any means.  It's a rectangular, 1 inch thick slice, with a fragrant tomato gravy (dats right, REAL Italians call it dat) topped with a fontina, romano or something sharp.  The cheese is just right, and just below it, the tomato flavor is incredible.  If you're lucky enough to get a chewy edge, marron!  Order of favorite - cheese, sausage (pepperoni is too strong and takes away from everything).  We used to order this BY THE TRAY and it would be gone. They also have foccacia, arancini (stuffed rice balls), a new gelato bar, cookies, pizelle, rolls, etc. SECRET DESSERT - Man, I have no idea why they hide these things, but if you find em, GET EM.  Chery slices, apple slices, napoleons, huge chocolate eclairs, and, of course, cannoli.  It's like these were just like a little hobby they do back there, yet these are just so perfect, not too sweet, not to heavy, that you wonder why they don't make MORE. Slices - 2 x 4 x 4 inch pies with perfect fillings and vanilla icing.  One of each. Napoleons - thin pastry dough with vanilla custard and topped with vanilla icing.  I'll take TWO. Eclairs - 5 inch chocolate covered custard eclairs (that are FILLED, baby, no skimping here!).  I can only eat one, but I WANT 5. Cannoli - 4 inch delicate round cookie tubes filled with sweetened ricotta and chocolate chips, edged with nuts.  Always gimme TWO. Don't go hungry or you'll leave with a few bags. COST - Inexpensive CAVEATS - It small and parking is tough.  Be patient.  You will be rewarded.",0.9977,0.802,0.166,0.032,0.5542753400445707
