2007-05-11,5.0,"It astounds me that this place isn't more popular, because I really think it's one of the best sushi restaurants I've been to in Chicago. The rice was perfectly vinegared and served at the perfect temperature, the fish I had all tasted fresh, and every maki or nigiri piece had this balance of flavor and texture that is hard to explain but not something that you find at most sushi places.  The presentation was creative and worked well, with a variety of different plates on which the maki or nigiri were served.  I've been there three times, and each time the service was attentive and responsive. This may have been because it wasn't exactly the busiest night for the place, but I have no reason to believe it wouldn't sustain itself through heavier business.   It might not be the traditional, intimate sushi bar, but the setting is hip and well-designed. It's restrained enough to be elegant without really trying.  I thought it managed to pull off a modern look without falling victim to the Standard Issue Pan-Asian Modern Design (frosted glass with neon behind it juxtaposed with garish red lanterns drowning in a sea of bamboo).   As for the body sushi--it's such a fragment of this restaurant that it isn't worth commenting on. If you want to get it you can arrange to have it in a private room. That's about it. You'd never know they offered this service just from eating there.  I haven't had it so I can't say if it's good or bad.  I was going to just give it four stars at first, but decided that Chicago needed a five-star alarm to smack it to its senses so it will begin to appreciate this place.  The review is fawning because the place really is worth going to, and I would hate to see a place that does everything right not get the success it seems to deserve.",0.8488,0.814,0.109,0.077,0.4912464985994397
2007-04-01,4.0,"Kizoku is definitely one of my favorite sushi restaurants in Chicago.  I usually order the Kizoku Sushi combination with 8 pieces of fresh nigiri and a shrimp tempura maki. YUMMY! For dessert, I recommend the green tea gelato with lychees and midori liquor.  For the quality of its food and its hip atmosphere, the place is never packed.  Every time we've been there, we never have had to wait for a table.",0.9316,0.806,0.194,0.0,0.51
2007-03-31,3.0,I like this place because it's very low key and you always can find a table. Sushi is pretty good. Nice environment.,0.8405,0.521,0.396,0.083,0.798
2007-01-28,4.0,Really good sushi and decent cocktails.  The atmosphere would be really cool also if there had been more people there.  I think some people are scared away from this place though because this is the place that offers the option to have your sushi served on a naked person.  Though you would never know or expect it I saw no naked people and was told this is done only in private parties in private rooms (so it is a little shady) but the sushi was good :),0.8881,0.812,0.15,0.038,0.5494047619047618

2006-11-12,4.0,"Pretty good sushi place with reasonable prices.  I made reservations since it was a Saturday night but it was definitely not necessary, the place was almost empty.  Maybe nobody has discovered this place yet, because you would think it would've been more busy.  In any event the atmosphere was good, the prices were great and the sushi was good as well...more people need to try this place.",0.9647,0.719,0.26,0.022,0.6449999999999999
2006-09-01,4.0,"My friend and I had dinner here tonight and I was surprised to see that it was pretty much empty on a Friday night (there were only about 4 other tables and the restaurant is absolutely huge). I'm not sure why Kizoku was empty because the sushi, service, and ambiance was amazing.   Our waiter, Matt, was very attentive and helped us pick some delicious choices...scallop appetizer, turtle roll, sunrise roll, and a spider roll. The turtle roll and sunrise rolls were amazing and I'll be getting them again in the future. He also told my friend to pick out a free dessert in honor of her birthday...she chose the wild berry cake and it was so good that we devoured it even though we were full from the sushi.    I know that Kizoku is known for eating sushi off of naked women, but from what I could see this is just a really good trendy sushi restaurant. The naked women must be hidden in the back!",0.9668,0.821,0.155,0.025,0.6509661835748793
2006-08-21,2.0,"Over-priced, trendy and average at best.  Eating sushi off of a naked model?  How low on the totem pole of modeling do you have to be to consider a gig like this?  A restuarant should rely on its food for advertisement, not this. Service was good, but then again you're paying for it.",0.6261,0.849,0.123,0.029,0.48333333333333334
2006-08-07,4.0,Great ambiance. We live a couple blocks away so we checked it out when it first opened. Its large and they play good music. The menu is nice and everything is presented very beautifully and fish is very fresh. I would rec. it to people who live in the area (River North) and are looking for a nice night out for sushi instead of just a typical neighborhood Japanese restaurant.,0.9622,0.712,0.265,0.023,0.6051587301587302
2006-06-20,4.0,"Kizoku is great.  It's got a laid-back atmosphere but is still very hip, and great for a romantic date. Tables aren't cramped like at some other sushi places (hi sushi wabi).  The service is good, if sometimes a bit ""hovery.""   I highly reccomend the hot roll and the Las Vegas roll.   To die for.  Mmmmm.....",0.8217,0.656,0.227,0.117,0.583125
2006-05-17,5.0,"My husband & I have been going to Kizoku since they've opened & we love, love, love Kizoku!  This is the most reasonably priced sushi in Chicago.  All the rolls are delicious as well as their non-sushi entrees.  Definitely get the scallops as an appetizer.  It's so addictive!  The atmosphere is awesome as well--hip & modern, but still provided for a laidback dining experience. The backroom lounge is also available for private parties.  We sectioned off part of it for after our wedding, & our out-of-town guests loved the sushi & atmosphere.  Eddie, the GM, definitely knows how to take care of people!",0.9867,0.703,0.297,0.0,0.6196428571428572
2006-04-21,4.0,I absolutely love this place and now call it my favorite sushi place.  They are very creative and everything is superb.  Great decor and awesome lounge in the back.  I recommended this place to a friend that said she wasn't too crazy about the sushi in Chicago and she thought it was outstanding.  She now has somewhere to go for great sushi.  Yum...Yum!,0.9902,0.561,0.439,0.0,0.7875
