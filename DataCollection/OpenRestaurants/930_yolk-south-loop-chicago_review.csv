2017-09-03,5.0,"We originally was gonna go to wildberry, but things didn't work out. We were suggested by a friend to download nowait app to help with the wait time. We didn't realize that wildberry didn't allow us to use their app for 5 people. We were sad. We saw that yolk was nother breakfast place and we used the app here. They offered more people to wait in line than wildberry. So we ended up here. We took about 15 minutes to get there. I used my app to wait in line. Even before our lyft came, it said our table was already ready. That was awesome, so we got into the ressturant instantly and got seated. The staff here was very friend. They all looked like they enjoy their work. The waiters were fairly attentive. They were quick to refill our water jug when they noticed it was empty. I ordered the eggs Benedict and I did enjoy it. It comes with roasted potatoes which I wasn't sure at first that I would like it. I ended up like my entire meal. The eggs Benedict was delicious and the potatoes were crunchy on the outside but soft in the inside! I was a little sad they didn't have an egg Benedict with crab cakes but I was naive to think all places would have it.

2017-08-27,4.0,"In my opinion, there are three big perks about Yolk:  1) Big menu with lots of variety: even the pickiest eaters will find something they like. I enjoyed building my own custom ""scrambler"" with the long list of ingredients available. I also shared the very berry french toast, which was very tasty: challah bread topped with strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, honey, granola, and greek yogurt. 2) Portion sizes are VERY generous. The average entree will set you back $10-13, but you'll almost certainly have enough for two meals.  My scrambler came with a huge side of potatoes, plus two slices of toast.  3) Great place for groups. The restaurant is huge and has lots of tables and booths, plus counter seating for singles/couples. Now, for the constructive criticism: Yolk doesn't take reservations. Instead, they use the ""nowait"" app. However, when I showed up at the restaurant at the time the nowait app told me to arrive, I still had to wait another 30 minutes (the app is a lie!).",0.951,0.852,0.127,0.021,0.4234126984126984
2017-08-24,3.0,"TLDR: Get the No wait app, Potato Pancakes (Latkes) were good, probably not coming back if I do find myself in Chicago again, Service was okay considering how swamped the place gets.   Third Day in Chicago and I wanted to try a Brunch place!  So we stopped in for some breakfast and may I say, it was quite delicious!!  We came on a Friday morning and thought there would be no line because everyone is at work still, boy was I wrong.  There was a 30 minute wait but if you have the NO wait app, you can actually sign in without actually being there in person and wait for them to text you when your table is ready.  It took a while to get our waiters attention, but after waiting 20 minutes, he came to take our order.  Our eyes are always bigger than our stomachs so for 4 people we ordered 5 dishes thinking they were small.  The entrees were South of the Border Benny, Cheesy Egg Sandwich, Country Side skillet, potato pancakes, and the farm house.   The size of all the dishes covered our entire table, and just looking at all the food we ordered, made us full.  The South of the Border Benny was okay, I wasn't a big fan of crumbled chorizo or the hash that was soft/steamed potatoes on the side but they nailed the poached eggs.  The Potato pancakes were like latkes, they were really good with the sour cream and ketchup, not so much the apple sauce though.  The Cheesy Egg Sandwich and the Skillet were just overwhelmingly rich and needed something other than ketchup and hot sauce to cut through it all.  The hot sauce that they have on the table wasn't at all spicy, it was smokey and went really well with almost anything we put it on!!  The farm house entree was okay, the cheesy grits and the gravy over biscuts were good.  The food overall was good for what it was, but we left feeling unsatisfied.     The service for the overall meal was decent, considering how busy they were.  If I do come back, I may order something else like an omelet or a simple combo meal.",0.9741,0.838,0.108,0.054,0.4534391534391533

2017-08-24,4.0,"Overall experience here was great. When me and company arrived we were seated almost immediately because of the lack of people. Before I continue, a quick shout out to the waitress who served us, nicely done and thank you for being kind and not rude at all. I ordered two dishes, waffles with fresh strawberries ($3 is a little much for the amount of strawberries that were layered on the waffles) and because it caught my intention, I also ordered the Nutella crepe. Since the waffles got to my table first I'll start with them. The waffles were shaped well, split into fourths and after an initial bite I noticed that they weren't overpoweringly sweet even with the syrup and the powdered sugar, which is a good thing, in my opinion. They also had a nice crispy exterior with a soft interior. However, something about them just didn't completely blow me away to award it five stars. They certainly had a homemade flavor to them and a relatively tasty batter. But, they arrived a little to cold for my liking and the batter itself used to make the waffle could use a more unique flavor that distinguishes it more from the competition. Again, the batter is good, but not mind blowing. It could have also arrived warmer, since food that is meant to be warm tastes better when it's...... of course warm. Onto the Nutella crepe.... man this thing was excellent. I honestly enjoyed this more than the waffles hands down. (And at only $5 it's a must have) The crepes themselves were well made. They didn't have that horrible egg like taste that happens if done incorrectly and they went well with the perfect amount of Nutella, bread crumbs/nuts, banana slices, strawberries, and whipped cream that are served with it. I didn't even need the syrup. The crepes were also very light, nicely folded, and savory.

The maple bacon pancakes...true disappointment. The pancakes were plain pancakes with a tablespoon of chopped bacon placed on top with a drizzle of chocolate syrup. I guess the maple comes from me actually pouring maple on it myself not that it was cooked into it or anything.  The kale scramble....tasted like bland eggs with grass. They should have cooked the kale a bit before scrambling it into the eggs. Coffee...decent but they only had the highly preserved packets of creamers on the table.  Asked for real cream....none. Asked for whole milk...none. Had skim or two percent. What kind of breakfast spot only has watery milk for coffee?????!!! Add to that a friend paid $18 for oatmeal with fruit. Yes. $18!!!!

Someone else had a similar problem and came with a Lyft who she asked to wait for her...Lyft driver gave up and left her. Then they could have multitasked and made the lattes on the order while I waited...instead people stood around and waited for my food to arrive before even starting the espresso.

2017-07-10,4.0,"My coworkers have gotten into the habit of checking Yelp before they recommend any place to me because they KNOW I'll eventually write a review on it. The pressure is on them to impress ~*~The*Elite~*~ Not really. I'll eat just about anything of any quality. Just feed me and promise me I won't get food poisoning or a tapeworm. One of them found this joint and showed me a picture of the bagel and lox. I haven't had smoked salmon in a minute, so I was hooked. Our little 10-minute walk from the Hilton Chicago (with plenty of sights to see) in the heat worked up an appetite and I was ready! . . . To wait in line for 40 minutes. They do offer drinks from their cafe while you wait, but I'm not trying to fill my belly with iced lattes while I'm waiting for the main meal. The app they use to notify you when your table is ready is cool. Yelp also kept track our place in line. Pretty neat, if I do say so myself.  40 minutes was accurate. Got a text and walked right back in. This is where my review of Yolk gets a little eh. You can tell the front was overwhelmed and not handling it well. Once you receive a text, you get back in a different line to be seated. One gentleman seated the couple two places ahead of us and disappeared. Someone came back around five minutes later and sat my party even though we weren't at the front of the line. Need a better way to get people to their table. Don't tell me my table is ready just for me to wait some more. My tummy did not appreciate that. Anyway, had a cold glass of tomato juice with a slice of lemon to start myself off. If you're a heavy juice drinker, just get the 32 oz. carafe from the get-go. No point in those tiny glasses. Now, despite the front having issues, waiting and the kitchen where on their game! Our, Isamar, server was very sweet and attentive despite how crammed packed and hectic it was in there. Loved her. Out of the three of us, two plates of lox and a regular breakfast plate were ordered. Our lox were so buttery. Just the highest quality I've had in a long time. When I got tired of the toppings, I just ate the lox by themselves. The cream cheese was hard to spread, but the tomato, onions, capers, and bagel were great. My coworker who also ordered the lox opted for a hard boiled egg to top on his bagel. I got three sausage links and two over easy eggs since I'm fat and don't know when to stop. For the All Star plate, he wolfed down some French toast, bacon, sausage links, and two over easy eggs. He was really digging the syrup, too. I always worry about getting sausage patties or links when I eat at a diner-type place because they're either too greasy or just inedible. Not the case here. They were perfect! The first things I ate. The sausage link had a nice texture and the skin had a little bit of snap. Just A+ sausage links and my coworker agreed with me. We left satisfied. Didn't feel rushed even with hoards of people taking over the entrance of the restaurant. Don't worry, though. If I'm even back in too, that's my breakfast joint.

2017-07-01,1.0,This place is so touristy and generic. Nothing fancy to the food. I'm not a chef and I could make most of this at home better. Especially for the price. The kids mac n cheese was like cheese soup with a few noodles and the sauce was very grainy. Then the BLT supreme + egg was just a big pile of ingredients slapped on soggy bread that I couldn't even eat like a proper sandwich. We had the Reuben too which was very plain and the fries had no flavor. Definitely a huge disappointment from the service to the food.,0.875,0.79,0.157,0.052,0.3967532467532468

2017-06-26,4.0,"This is a great go to breakfast place when you are looking for a fast, no brainer breakfast spot. Their food is very straight forward, great tasting and plentiful. I made my own skillet with a variety of ingredients to choose from and my husband has the chilaquiles which he absolutely loved. To which I might add, it's very hard to find good, authentic chilaquiles in the city and these were up there. The well done potatoes on my skillet (per my request) was an added bonus to a great meal. The only downside to this place is the level of noise and their taste in music. If you go during the weekend, be prepared to shout your conversation with your fellow party as it's nearly impossible to hear anyone speak. As for the music, I know it's my personal preference, but I really feel like I'm in a club when I go there. I would prefer something a little more in the ""easy listening"" category. The noise level and music really just stamped the ""club"" feel for me which is why I deducted one star. But it's still a great place for an all American breakfast.",0.9818,0.811,0.167,0.022,0.625375

It was so crowded I was worried that the tables would be filled by the time they arrived. It turned out fine, though, we were seated as soon as our full party was present.  A lot of the menu has to do with eggs, hence the name ""Yolk"" (egg benedict, scrambles, omelets, etc.) I ordered the berry french toast with greek yogurt and granola with the honey on the side. It was delicious! Too big for me to finish, though, I should have split it with someone. You get six half-pieces of french toast! My friend ordered the chicken and waffles and it was humongous.

The omelet was actually smaller than we expected but still very filling and also came with diced potatoes. The oats were well prepared and you could mix in your own skim milk and brown sugar. We picked the pancakes as the side for our omelet, since it seemed more shareable than a muffin. The pancakes were a bit dry and the syrup somehow just disappeared into the pancakes but didn't provide much sweetness. I'm sure the actual pancake dishes are much better, but the side pancakes are more just extra carbs. Overall, service was very fast.

2017-05-28,3.0,"***3.5 stars*** First of all, this restaurant is really cute! I love that they personalize everything - from having their own pens, pancake mix, syrup, bibs, cups, and even their very own water bottle that's labeled Yolk. The interior and exterior is a bright yellow - very eye catching and the inside is nice and open with tables, booths, as well as a counter area.  They had quite a few things on their menu and it took us awhile to finally nail down what we wanted. Not craving any sweets, we went with their South of the Border Benedict and the Pot Roast Benedict. I was excited and wanted to love it, but unfortunately, I was let down...  As a side note, they do not offer hash browns and only serve their potatoes seasoned and diced - which is fine, however, it was not good at all. The potatoes were mushy and felt like they were sitting out for a while. It seemed like frozen potatoes that weren't fried correctly. Strike one! As for both of our Benedict choices, the Pot Roast was definitely the winner. It was so tender and had a great flavor. We thoroughly enjoyed the meat. The South of the Border Benedict had chorizo in it with a chipotle sauce and we thought the sauce was a bit too much. The chorizo already has so much flavor on its own, the added chipotle sauce just made it overpowering. It had a nice kick which we enjoyed, but we could have done without it. The presentation of both our plates were average. Both of our potatoes came looking beat up and unappetizing. I'd say save yourself the trouble and pass on their potatoes!  Aside from the food, we tried their iced vanilla latte with almond milk since they didn't have soy milk. The color was a bit darker than what I'm use and the taste was also off, but it wasn't horrible.  I gave this place 3.5 stars because although I wasn't amazed, I liked the overall vibe of the place and service was good. Judging from the amount of reviews this place has, I couldn't believe the food was just average to me. I really wanted to love it just as much as I loved their decor.  I'll be back though, I'm hoping the pancakes or french toast will wow me next time I'm back!",0.9967,0.769,0.188,0.043,0.5621980676328502

We used the early check in option which worked well with their hour long wait. By the time we road bikes there we only waited 15 minutes to be seated. Service was quick and friendly.

Amazing berries, Greek yogurt, honey and we get a side of whole wheat pancakes (vs a muffin)  The score here is lower due to their coffee service. All the yolk locations have brown cane sugar at the tables and small cups for coffee. You can ask for Splenda but they are weirdly stingy about it and it is just plain weird and very annoying that they are forcing decisions and limitations on such an important and personal preference drink. It also delays the caffeine intake...you come in and they pour coffee. Then they hurry away (it's always super busy) and it sits until you can flag them down again to get sweetener...the cups are small so the coffee has cooled by the time you get attention.  I've started bringing my own Splenda  Not horrible but not stellar service or atmosphere.

It was my first time in Chicago, and my friend and I were looking for places to eat breakfast, and man, were we glad to have found Yolk! Our server Christina made our experience 1000x better with her suggestions, friendly demeanor, and overall enthusiasm. We asked her for suggestions as it was our first time there, and we couldn't decide on what to order since everything looked amazing. She recommended that we try the West Coast Crepes, which were unlike anything we had ever tried before. The crepe itself was sweet, and the filling of avocado, mushrooms, and eggs was the perfect savory counterpoint. We also ordered the Classic Eggs Benedict, and while it wasn't as mind blowing as the crepes, it was a solid meal and perfectly balanced. The portions were more than enough as they are very generous with the fresh fruit and potatoes that were on the side with our meal. Christina checked in on us frequently, always making sure we had enough coffee and that everything was up to our standards, but without being overbearing or anything.  As for wait times, etc, we didn't have any issues getting a table right away, even though we went on a weekday around 9 or 10 am. The restaurant at the time was decently busy, but the servers and the kitchen had a nice flow going, so the wait time for the food wasn't long.

2016-12-12,4.0,"Like other reviewers mentioned--expect a wait. Not a bad idea to get in line via mobile device before getting to the restaurant. But once you get to your table and order, food seems to appear almost instantly! My friend and I were both so surprised at how quickly a great meal was brought to the table.  I ordered the Very Berry French Toast, while my friend ordered the Nutella Crepes and the Benedict Caprese. The portions of all our orders were HUGE--definitely much larger than we expected given the reasonable price. We both came in pretty hungry and we're unable to finish the meal.  What I liked about the Very Berry French toast: they do not skimp on the berries, which I really appreciated. If berries are in the name of the dish, there should be more than a few on the plate. The toast was soft and not overly sweet. The added granola gave a nice texture to what is usually and overwhelmingly soft dish.  What I didn't love so much: the Greek yogurt topping. This might be a personal preference, but I didn't feel like the combination of yogurt on French toast made a lot of sense. It was very heavy and dominated my tastebuds, making me feel like I missed out on the actual French toast flavor. I would've enjoyed this dish more if the yogurt was on the side or even replaced with whipped cream.  Friend loved both of his dishes! Despite a very busy restaurant during prime brunch hours on Sunday, our waitress checked in us 5 times and was very friendly.  Would highly recommend Yolk if you're looking for a solid breakfast/brunch with traditional fare. Tons of seating and very family friendly!",0.9869,0.795,0.155,0.05,0.4423983739837399
2016-12-10,4.0,I came here with a few friends while visiting Chicago. I LOVED the eggs benedict caprese. The food was cooked great and the breakfast potatoes were amazing. The house coffee was underwhelming at best. My biggest complaint was something small.. the fruit was served as a side to the eggs benedict on the same plate. I would have preferred a side plate or bowl so that the fruit doesn't mix with the hollandaise sauce etc. Overall a good brunch.,0.9703,0.723,0.253,0.024,0.4175

I've been here a few times and everytime has been consistent and good. (Yes, places have messed up hard on breakfast food before.)  Anyways, I usually order The Works Skillet or South Benny. Both are delicious, flavorful, and filling. The Works is for when I'm not feeling heavy on spice as the South Benny has chorizo which then I usually douse in their Cholula sauce. I sometimes substitute one of the toppings in The Works for Canadian Bacon or something else. Topping it off with their gravy, man this plate is amazing! The South Benny is delicious with a nice spice kick from the Chorizo. Eggs benedict are made well with good Hollandaise sauce and just cooked well enough for the egg yolk to run over perfectly. The muffin is often seared a little to give it a nice crisp. Overall, a flavorful plate of breakfast food.  Definitely worth a wait here!",0.9948,0.715,0.256,0.03,0.5521825396825397

Food came out in less than 7 minutes. Cheesy grits were delicious. I didn't have to add anything to them (I'm a southern girl so if things are bland, I'm quick to add butter or sugar).

We got to Yolk around 9:30 on Saturday morning and had to wait about 15-20 mins for a table. The restaurant is HUGE, and we had about 20 tables ahead of us, so 15-20 mins was pretty good. The service: Our waitress was really nice. When you're done, you take your check up to the front to pay. Very smart and cuts down on time! The food: Between me and my boyfriend, we ordered the strawberry-orange juice, countryside skillet, south of the border benny, and a side of corn beef hash. - Strawberry-orange juice: Freshly squeezed! Really good and refreshing! - Countryside skillet: this skillet is huge! You'll definitely get food coma after this, especially since it also comes with toast, english muffin, or pancakes. I opted for the pancakes and could not finish everything. Whatever comes in a skillet is always delicious in my opinion. This is loaded with ingredients and just super delicious. - South of the border benny: My boyfriend ordered this. He said it was pretty good, but nothing that memorable.

Does anyone like sweet eggs?  Maybe it's me.   This place is HOPPING, they know how to handle the big crowds and they are hustling to make it happen for you.  I liked everything about it but the meal so I do want to give it another chance (but will not order the crepes!).",0.9895,0.692,0.209,0.098,0.6038065843621401

Fried, poached, omelet, pancake, you name it. I ordered poached eggs with home fries, bacon, sausage along with chocolate milk. ( I know I'm very adventurous when it comes to breakfast)  The reason why I give it 4 stars is even though everything I ordered was pretty safe, there was some room for error like the bacon being over cooked or the chocolate milk not being cold.

Was one of my favorite breakfast place, we went twice during our visit. The first time I just ordered typical breakfast, stuffed french toast. It was delicious. My hubby in the other hand he ordered an omelette with s'mores pancakes on the side. He absolutely loved. It was something different that we had not tried back home. The next time we went. I ordered an omelette, I forgot what it was and it was delicious!! This time my hubby ordered the red velvet cinnamon roll. Let me just tell you. They were perfection.

The first attempt had a wait time of almost an hour, and we just couldn't fit that in, our growling stomach's and busy schedules simply wouldn't allow for it. (Monday, on 4th of July, at 11am) The second attempt we walked in and our family of 7 was seated right away.(Tuesday at 9am)  I had a water to drink, our kids had no complaints about the chocolate milk.  My son got the strawberry orange juice, I tasted it. I do have to rave for a minute about the strawberry orange juice.  GET IT!  Seriously!  You will not be disappointed.  It is so freaking good. I want more. Like right now, as I am remembering it.... I got the corned beef hash, over medium eggs, white toast. This was definitely NOT canned, fried CBH like at other establishments.  This was actually corned beef... Like pulled beef shreds, onions, peppers, and potatoes. The flavor was out of this world. It was the best CBH i've ever had...

They sat us, then 10 minutes later, sat the 5 tables surrounding us with one family. They kept shouting over us and getting up, standing at the edge of our table and yelling to each other. Most things I can ignore, but this was insane. The restaurant should not have sat a huge family party surrounding another table. We had to ask them to move us, and had to pick up all our drinks and stuff and transfer tables so the family could be together. That huge party had to be on the list awhile so Yolk could have thought ahead a bit. Anyway, on to food. By no means would I go here again. Their fruit was flavorless, and my meal the West Coast Crepes was the worst breakfast I've ever had and I'm of the opinion that it's very difficult to mess up breakfast. They were very small and I still couldn't choke down half of them. The crepes were meant for a dessert option- they were incredibly sweet and normally I'd love that, but paired with eggs was not the right combo at all. It made it sort of sour and taste like an ingredient was going bad. Needless to say, I left hungry. Also, servers were so busy they never asked how things were or took notice I hadn't eaten a thing on my plate. Everyone else's meals were okay, no rave reviews, no big complaints from them.

The fruit looked really good and the eggs are so substantial that I think fruit would have provided a good balance. I'm not a pancakes person, but if you are, pancakes in lieu of toast on the side is still $11 which is a killer deal.

I'm not sure what the problem was, but needless to say, it was not an ideal situation to be waiting in their crowded lobby for almost 20 extra minutes, for food that was supposed to have been made within 10 minutes originally.  Hopefully Yolk can remedy this issue!",0.7907,0.778,0.127,0.095,0.590515873015873

2016-04-09,2.0,"Let me start with the food is good. I will give them that.  However, if you build a restaurant with all hard surfaces (meaning little sound absorption) and combine it with a young brash clientele, it equals a truly ear-bleeding dining experience.  First, it was the troop of young occupational therapists in for a conference. My wife and I got a full lesson in the meaning of therapy as they yelled-slained it to a young gentleman who somehow got caught in their snare.  Second, upon being seated, we found ourselves a couple seats over from the hipster day-drinking twins. Four people, two (now empty) bottles of wine, and the twins who proceeded to bellow to their table the latest in tight pants, beards, bicycles, chest hair, and irony.  Finally, the couple next to us. Who argued for the entirety of our lunch about whether or not a marathon racer could sue the city for ice on the racetrack. She, between humble-brags about her running prowess, kept saying that you sign wavers and run at your own risk. He, between wolfing at his food like a wild hyena learning to use a fork, would continue to say that you could sue. ""There's a branch on the track and someone trips on it, I would sue the city"". ""All it would take is a $50 bag of salt to get rid of the ice"".  ""What if someone dies and another person dies and another one, they could all sue"". You get the picture.  In all, like I said at the beginning, Yolk had good food. We've eaten at a couple of them since moving to the city. However, eat at this location at the risk of your hearing and sanity, but I guess you could always sue..............",0.4939,0.942,0.033,0.025,0.5110902255639097

I was going to substitute fresh fruits with fresh berries but instead she just got me additional fresh berries. I'm not complaining but I just couldn't finish it so I had to take it home) Me: El toreto scrambler with side fruits and toasts(3.5/5): I liked the flavor but the amount of cheese and sour cream on this is just too overwhelming. Otherwise this could've been a good scrambled egg dish. The smash avocado made it creamy and chorizo added in the accents of flavor. I never got to the toasts coz I can't finish it... Fresh berries: well they're just fresh blueberries, blackberries, and (sliced) strawberries. You either like them or not. Strawberry orange juice (4/5): This is pretty good! You could tell it's freshly made from the pulp and seeds of strawberries, Him: Chicken 'n' waffles (4/5): Oh my god. This dish looks like a plate full of cardiac arrest and diabetes. But don't get me wrong, it was savory and tasty. The fried chicken was crispy on the outside and juicy within. Topped with gravy, it was p heavenly.

2015-12-31,3.0,"3.5 I mean this in the nicest way possible but Yolk to me is like a high-end IHOP. While the food at this chain is slightly above average, the vastness of the menu was more impressive than the quality of my meal. It seems that I am in the minority as Yolk was voted best breakfast in Chicago. Also, it was ridiculously packed during my visit. Wait time was an hour!  As I said earlier, that menu is rather extensive and there is something for everyone. For those with a sweet tooth, Yolk offers a variety of pancakes, waffles, crepes, and french toasts. Luckily for me, they focus more on savory items such as omelets, benedicts, scramblers, skillets, and a myriad of specialty options.  I opted for a scrambler with a side of fresh fruit and an english muffin. ( yelp.com/biz_photos/yolk… ). Mine had turkey sausage, spinach, and mushrooms. I really appreciate that they will use egg substitute upon request without any additional charge. It was just ok but the turkey sausage seemed like some generic jimmy dean breakfast item.  I also had a bite of Christina C's Irish Bennedict ( yelp.com/biz_photos/yolk… ). It had corned beef hash and roasted tomatoes. Not bad at all. I enjoyed it more than my own order.  My other friend ordered a skillet. Normally, this guy can pack away food but he barely got through half of the order. That skillet was so heavy that he couldn't even look at the side of pancakes...that poor soul haha. Be prepared to share if you decide to go this route.  Fresh strawberry orange juice was a hit with us! Definitely check that out.  I think my favorite part of this restaurant was the location. It was around the corner from my hotel,down the street from the train station and a short walk from the museums and other attractions.  Overall, Yolk is a decent choice but there is one other breakfast spot in the area I'd rather go.",0.9958,0.778,0.19,0.032,0.4580284552845529

The good: -No wait at nine on a Sunday morning -They're quick with the coffee -The sausage was very good - the nice thick sort -Service was quick The bad: -My ham and cheese omelette contained no ham. I pointed this out to the server and he apologized for not hearing me and offered to bring a plate of ham. No dude. I don't want a plate of ham and a pile of scrambled eggs with cheese on top. I want the ham and cheese omelette I ordered - bring me one. I may be a low talker, but that doesn't mean I have to eat the mistake you left in from of me. -My cheese omelette didn't have cheese inside. It's not an actual omelette. It's just a pile of scrambled eggs that they put cheese on top of.  -I was charged for this foolishness (to be fair, I never asked to have it taken back or removed from my bill - but I didn't eat it and it was flat out not what I ordered. It was kind of befuddling to me that I was charged for it. I shouldn't have to kvetch, you should figure that out on your own.) -When we left around 9:40 there was already a very healthy wait forming. -My wife's eggs where cold. -The coffee was weak.  -My hashbrowns were cold.  -No splenda (though they did have Stevia, which is likely even better in my book).  -Cream consisted of those annoying little packets - not actual cream. -It's expensive. The average breakfast dish is $12 to $16.  --------------- I live nearby and we had high hopes for this place. This is the first time either my wife or I have walked into a restaurant in recent memory where we just have no desire to return (it's not just the omelette... everything else was just lackluster).

2015-11-22,2.0,"My second visit to Yolk was sadly to say..underwhelming. This time I stopped in with another good friend who actually made the suggestion for Yolk. Considering my first experience i gladly agreed. When i arrived, seemingly as always, Yolk was having a busy morning but i considering my arrival was early i wanted to save a table. Unfortunately I was seated in the back near the bathrooms which I am positive that anyone would be dismayed at thos placement, there just weren't anymore options except for the bar and i couldn't risk that because of the noise. After all the objective is good food and convo. So i agreed to the back table. Our server was friendly and as soon as my friend arrived we were tended to efficiently. It took a minute to decide on a plate but i eventually went with the breakfast sandwich of egg cheese and bacon and home fries. In this case I experienced one of those food follies where you realize it's probably better to go with what you know is good for i was not really pleased with my selection. The bread was a bit wilted, the egg a bit dry, the bacon a bit rubbery and the fries a bit tasteless. I failed to finish my plate. On the other hand my friend's plate looked satisfying. She went with a favorite, french toast and fries. I should've taken her lead on this one. So overall my experience food wise was fair this time but not so bad that I'll never return. That would be a stretch. Yolk is generally a decent choice if your hungry and in the south loop. My suggestion: opt for a battered breakfast",0.9943,0.729,0.214,0.057,0.533972537878788

My bf had the seasonal sweet potato hash. He loved it.  It was a little on the sweet side for me because the potatoes were tossed in a maple glaze. It was still very good though.  Day two was not as impressive.  We both ordered the corned beef hash that looked and tasted like it came out of a can. My toast was so burnt it was black on both sides.

Atmosphere:  I really liked the ambience of Yolk.  It's exactly what I would imagine when I think of a brunch restaurant/diner from its bustling diner feel to its modern decor/design.   Service:  The service was one of the best I've had at a diner.  The waitress was very sweet and patient and let us know about different menu options and upgrades.  The wait for the food was probably a bit longer than usual but not terrible (maybe 20-30 minutes) and she checked in with us to let us know the status of our food during the wait.  She also checked up on us multiple times to make sure we were okay and enjoying the food. Food:  I ordered a California omelette with a side of nutella crepes.  The omelette was rather strange... it was mainly a thin tortilla-like egg layer wrapped around A LOT of stuffed cheeses.  After eating a bit more than half of the omelette I had to stop, not because I was full but because I felt so weighed down by all the cheese.  I didn't care too much for the overwhelming stuffing-to-egg ratio, especially for a stuffing with that much cheese.  The crepe on the other hand was delicious and provided a nice sweet touch to contrast the savory omelette.

2015-07-04,4.0,"Honestly I always have a pretty great experience here- nine times out of ten. Maybe once I had a so-so experience, but the good outweighs the bad. The one time that was so-so was because of the service. I think my waitress forgot to put in my order. It was dead in there, and my food took a while. Being a server, I can usually tell what went wrong. With that being said, all in all, the service is pretty good.  I always get an omelet (I love the California, veggie, and Mediterranean). I usually sub egg whites because the use FIVE whole eggs - sometimes they let you do some whole eggs and some egg whites, but usually not on weekends. They don't under cook egg whites like some breakfast places do.  I've also had the kale scramble- that is DELICIOUS! I love goats cheese.  You can get fruit instead of hash browns for no extra charge and can also get multigrain pancakes instead of the buttermilk pancakes for no extra charge, as well! When I'm feeling indulgent, I love the Tour de France. It's a trio of various sweet breads made into French toast. It's been a while since I have had it, but I remember it being unreal. Very sweet, though.  Bring an appetite. The plates are large. Also, be prepared to wait if you come during the busy day morning hours.

The waitress that was helping me out was super sweet and really paid attention to us. Also, I came in on a Wednesday at 9AM and I didn't have a wait, if that helps anybody.  Yolk has a really expansive menu, and even though they serve up all the favorites, they seem to cater to tourists (ME!) who are looking for something a little bit of everything. My mom and I ordered the Tour De France, which has three different type of french toasts, and the countryside skillet, a hodgepodge of different meats, vegetables, potatoes, with eggs on top. They were both sooooo goooood. I loved the three different french toasts, but my favorite has got to be the lemon poppyseed one. I personally didn't like the gravy that came with the countryside skillet, but it doesn't diminish my opinion of this place. Also, portions were HUGE, but my mom and I still managed to eat everything.... but we weren't hungry until 7 hours later LOL  Another thing to mention was that the coffee was great!

Omelette, filled with avocado and chorizo. Since it comes with pancakes, it's easily enough for two meals. The place is big and has a bright atmosphere -- exactly what you want in a diner.

The Yolk logo is so darn cute and the little fried egg inside the building is overly adorable. I just loved the color scheme here! It even goes all the way into the bathroom! There are a lot of people coming in and out and it's a little confusing as to what you're supposed to. You wait and then you will be seated shortly. The menu is filled with so many different things that it'll be so hard to choose which one to get. But when I saw the very berry french toast, I knew that it was calling for me. The portion sizes are big here and I barely even made a dent in mine. The french toast came with five pieces of half toast smothered in honey, yogurt, granola and berry explosion. There were blackberries, blueberries and strawberries everywhere. I think I made it through about 2.5 pieces of half slices before I caved in. The pieces of toast are buttered and so fluffy on the inside. They don't get soggy, which I love. The yogurt has a nice tartness that balances the sweetness from the honey and berries. Berries are really fresh and in season! I loved it berry much! My friend got the chicken and waffles and I was surprised by how big it was. The waffle is so fluffy and has pieces of bacon scattered throughout. The pieces of chicken are tender and perfectly crisp on the outside. I think it could have used a little bit more gravy, but it was decent enough to get through the entire dish. Who knew that chicken, gravy, waffles and syrup could make such an awesome combination?! My friend also ordered a side of potato hash which came out well seasoned and nicely cooked.  Our server was friendly and did check up on us here and there. Our water was refilled promptly. We were just slightly confused as to how we pay since many people were coming up to the register (you can order takeout which a lot of people do). The server will bring you your check which you then bring up to the register to pay. Most of the dishes here range from $10-15 depending on what you get. The portion size is very generous, I could have definitely shared. Overall, it's a perfect little brunch place.

Of you are a fan of pancakes, bananas, and peanut butter then these are for you. They are rich and fluffy covered in peanut butter and chocolate sauce. My sister created her own skillet and chose her own stay own style of eggs and toppings and I gave that a try as well. Definitely recommend it! Another item I tried on the menu was the red velvet french toast... need I say more? Cream cheese filling and moist french toast is to die for!  Our waitress was great and we were served very quickly and seated right when we walked in. Now we did go on a Monday morning so that could be why there was no wait.

The people working here from Kevan, Sophia to Lana were all very nice, helpful and on the ball taking great care of my wife's and my dining needs.

It was three different varieties of their French Toast including banana with peanut butter, orange bread with strawberries and lemon poppy seed with blueberries. I enjoyed all three but the poppy seed was my favorite.  Day two I flipped to the savory side of their menu and chose a hearty Santa Fe frittata. It turned out to be huge and I was unable to polish it off. I enjoyed this dish as well with a good bit of spiciness to it. The last day I went old school and just picked their scrambled eggs with bacon and wheat toast. This dish too was yummy and well prepared. The eggs weren't to dry or runny but just right.  They have a nice variety of juices to pair up with your breakfast. I stuck with OJ but one time I got a strawberry OJ mix that was a nice change. Their bacon is thick and meaty and not cooked too crisp just the way I prefer.  Plenty of tables and booths to seat everyone are available without a wait during the week at least.

It was just under 30 minutes when we were seated. Our table was near the back of the restaurant (close to the restrooms) and this area was LOUD. The restaurant is very open and tables are close enough to each other without being uncomfortable.  The noise level drops half a star for my review and the coffee drops another half of a star. I'd say it was just a bad pot but after drinking half of my cup and getting a refill it was just so bad. Burnt? I don't know. How do you ruin coffee? We headed to Starbucks after... but I digress... The food was really good. I ordered the Caprese Benedict. Poached eggs on top of pesto and grilled tomatoes with the English muffin and Hollandaise. The pesto made the dish and of course I always love a perfectly poached egg with a gorgeously runny yolk. Was it the best Eggs Benny I've ever had? No. Pretty sure it's a store bought English Muffin (womp), but it was perfect hangover food after an open bar at a wedding the night before and was conveniently located two blocks away from my hotel.

2015-04-21,3.0,"There are very few reviews that I start without knowing how many stars I am going to give them ahead of time. Yolk is one of the rare exceptions that I will write my experience, and then attribute a rating once I have completed and re-reviewed my own experience. I was in Chicago for the HIMSS ' 15 conference this year, and needed so find some quality eats (not hard to do in Chicago). For the morning of my departure from Chicago, I decided I wanted a nice breakfast, so I ran down to Yolk South Loop for some Eggs Benedict. Food: The food that I had was fresh, vibrant, seasoned perfectly, and undeniably tasty. This is undoubtedly one of the best Eggs Benedict that I have ever had, even with some of the weird issues surrounding my order. First, I ordered the Pot Roast Benedict. There was a massive margin of error here because so many components of Eggs Benedict can be easily messed-up. First the bad. I ordered, and (I crap you not) 3 minutes later my Pot Roast Benedict arrived -- lukewarm. It seemed to me as if they prepped all of these ingredients well-in-advance, or had an extra one lying around and quickly reassembled it and gave it to me. The lack of it being hot was a major indication that my dish was likely re-purposed to me in some way. Super disappointing, and I was expecting it to taste like old Eggs Benedict; but it didn't. Though it was lukewarm, the egg yolk was cooked passably-well, the muffin could have been crispier, the hollandaise could have had a touch more lemon; but the pot roast -- oooooh, the pot roast. Talk about elevating a dish to the next level! The pot roast simply made this dish. It was moist, tender, and seasoned to perfection.  Also lukewarm, but still delicious. I firmly believe that had this Eggs Benedict been cooked and assembled fresh, it may be the best I have ever had. Unfortunately, I will never know. Additionally, my meal was served with home fries (small cubes of potatoes), and fresh fruit. The fruit was incredibly fresh, but it was sloppily put on my plate and had hollandaise on it. Additionally, the fruit was not chilled and was also lukewarm. Very strange. The potatoes were under-seasoned and terrible. No salt, no pepper. They literally tasted like potatoes. Potatoes do not taste good without the proper seasoning. Food: Pot Roast Benedict 4 / 5 (4 / 5 +1 for amazing pot roast, -1 for temperature) Potatoes 1 / 5 (they weren't even crispy!) Fruit 3 / 5 (Fresh, but warm...?) Overall Food: 3 / 5 Service: Again, I have a favorable opinion of Yolk, but this is going to hurt the overall rating as well. First, my server was not personable. Not even a 'hi, ho are you', or a 'good morning', or 'welcome to Yolk'. Just a 'what can I get you?' And, she was training someone! LOL! Not only was she completely impersonal and lacked the fundamental skills of being a server, but when I asked if they did half portions of the Eggs Benedict, she simply stated 'no'. No reason behind that, ma'am? Then, when I ordered and OJ, she didn't ask what size, and served me a large. If I just asked for a half-order of EB, do you think that I want a large OJ? Why would you assume that? The difference of the small and the large came out of her tip. Service: 1 / 5 (completely ruined the experience) Atmosphere: Despite one of the worst service experiences I have endured in a while, the atmosphere is clean, inviting, and lovely. I could totally see myself dining here at least once per week if I lived in the area, and did not get stuck with a crap-server.  Atmosphere: 4 / 5 Price: For what I got, which was lukewarm Pot Roast Benedict, Fruit, under-seasoned potatoes, and crap service -- the price I paid 18.00-ish was outrageous -- regardless of how good the EB was.  Price: 2 / 5 Final Thoughts: Despite the bad experience, I still see the potential in Yolk, and feel as if I was just very unlucky on this particular day to get a crap server, and (possibly) old food. Honestly, I would come back one more time; but I am severely dissatisfied with my last experience, and cannot fully recommend this place based on my experience. It seems like my experience was an outlier, and wish you better luck when you check it out. I am rounding my 2.5 rating up to a 3 on the merits of the pot roast alone; but I hope that Yolk reads this and takes better care in hiring individuals who actually want to be at work and do a good job.",0.9867,0.762,0.135,0.103,0.5481897627965044

2015-04-07,3.0,"More like 2 1/2 stars for this experience...I would like to start by saying that I love Yolk. Love, love, love Yolk. Any time anyone visits or suggests breakfast/brunch, the first word out of my mouth is Yolk. However, I have never had such a disappointing and negative experience in your restaurant as I had on Saturday morning (3/7/15), around 11 AM.  Service was good, my waitress was good, friendly, attentive and the food was delicious.  My issue is in regards to the hostess, an older woman with short gray hair. I put my name in with her and she said the wait was about 20-25.  That was fine.  I requested a table/booth and she asked if I wanted to sit at the counter. I hesitated with saying no, because it may have meant a shorter wait, but in the end I said no, I would prefer a table/booth.  She responded with, so no counter then? And I said no.  Her tone was not merely inquiring, but more hostile.  It's busy, Saturday, nice weather, etc, so I understand it can be frustrating dealing with customers who may be indecisive. But I was not rude but friendly and smiling. After waiting a while, my friend and I hear what we thought was my name being called over the intercom (we were waiting outside) and so we go in and go up to the hostess and I said ""I'm Lori, did you call us?"" And she looked down and said ""No, that was for counter only."" In a rude manner, so I said ""OK..."" and my friend and I go back outside to wait.  A minute later we hear my name being called again, along with ""Last call for Lori."" So we rush back in and instead of apologizing or realizing her mistake, she looks at me and the guy (tall, blondish hair) who seats customers takes us to a table and practically throws the menus down. I am not sure what warranted such rude behavior and I was completely taken aback since I had never experienced this type of service before, having frequented this location many times in the past. This incident occurred at the South Loop location.  I hope that this was an isolated incident and that my future trips to Yolk will be more positive. The hostess is the first person you interact with when dining at Yolk, and this experience just left a bad taste in my mouth, no matter how yummy the very berry French toast was.",0.9828,0.756,0.154,0.09,0.46440909090909094

2015-03-30,1.0,"My sister and I went here for breakfast today and the service was the bare minimum. It was very clear that our waiter, Maks, was either having a bad day or just didn't want to be at work. Or maybe he didn't like me and my sister. As soon as we sat down, he asks if we want anything other than water to drink. My sister wants a coke and I was fine with water. At this point something seemed off but I wanted to give our waiter a chance. He leaves with our drink order and comes back with the soda and then before we could say anything, leaves again... He didn't even ask if we were ready to order. Ten minutes pass until he comes back to take our order. During that time, I tried to flag him down and he just seemed oblivious. He takes our order and never checks back in. Same thing happens with the food. He drops the food off and walks off. Doesn't even ask if we need extra napkins or condiments. Nothing.  At this point, my sister and I were doing okay. It wasn't a big deal. I just felt like we weren't welcomed. There was a point when we both needed refills but neither of us could spot our waiter. So we didn't get refills. So my sister and I continue to eat when he suddenly appears and hands us our check. He simply puts it on the table and leaves AGAIN. He didn't tell us to take our time, that there was no rush like any other waiter would usually do. He didn't even wish us to have a good day. It came off as rude. We never asked for the check and we clearly weren't near being finished. It was like he wanted us out. Since we obviously weren't done, we continued to eat. My sister clears her plate and Maks' final appearance was so off-putting. He literally comes up, picks up her plate, and walks away. He didn't even ask if she was done. I don't mean to be picky but both my sister and I work in customer service. If you're having a bad day, you fake it till you make it. That's my motto and that's the motto of a lot of people who work in the service industry. You don't show customers your bad side. It was very clear that our waiter didn't want to be at work or didn't like us. He made that very clear as soon as we were seated.

2015-03-29,5.0,"This is my first review for Yolk, but probably my 5th or 6th time here. There is a reason why Yolk is my breakfast joint of choice, time and time again, whenever I'm in Chicago. There is a consistent quality across all of its locations and this one in the south loop is particularly convenient - just off Roosevelt station.  I can't do this review justice like the many native Chicagoans that frequent place. I will say that there is not a better breakfast meal than their corned beef hash with eggs done over easy. The fruit, which seems to be seasonal is a nice touch to balance the amount of greasy deliciousness. The service is fantastic as with all Yolk locations. If you're coming with a large party, expect to wait quite a while on the weekends. Otherwise, smaller parties should get through within 30 minutes.

2015-02-19,4.0,"There's no sort of breakfast places in Chicago, and it can often be tough to choose amongst the many that are within walking distance of wherever you are in the city, but Yolk is a standout and definitely worth trying out at least once. The one i tried is located on michigan Ave. My friend and I were hungry and wanting breakfast on a Sunday morning. She suggested Yolk just based on seeing a couple of different locations while walking throughout the city. She heard great things about the place so she wanted me to try.. When we called to inquire about the wait, I was told 30 minutes. We decided to go ahead and walk there, hoping the wait would be less longer during the walk. When we got there, it was definitely busy! We were told the wait would be about 10-15 minutes, but in less than five minutes, we were seated.  We were quickly given waters and greeted by our server. Coffee was poured almost immediately (which was excellent!). We looked over their big menu and decided on the ""Hey, Ricky"" omelette for my friend and the ""West coast crepes"" for myself, it cost about 12 dollars each so i strongly believe it's an affordable price.   Food was great and well-priced for the HUGE portions you receive! My friend was very impressed with her omelette and the fact that they used fresh jalapenos. She loved her pancakes as well. My plate was a sort of eggs omelette, served with sweet crepes and i also ordered a side of fresh fruit. Service was great! Our server was friendly and paid just enough attention to us so that we didn't feel ignored, but didn't feel like we were interrupted every two seconds. Everyone there was friendly.  My only complaint is the noise level, which is high during the peak service hours. It's an open kitchen though, so you're not only going to hear the patron chatter, but also the kitchen staff. We were seated at the counter, so of course it would be a bit busier and louder. I'm sure if we were sat at a table away from the kitchen it would have been a bit less noisy.

Finding a brunch spot in Chicago's South Loop is harder than you think, as my boyfriend and I found out the hard way the other weekend. We wandered around for about 30-45 minutes until we came across Yolk. The line outside was daunting, but we decided to risk it and see what the wait was. We were told 30 minutes but it was more like 10 minutes and we were seated at the breakfast counter (our preference).  The food here is so good-it's exactly what you think of when you think 'brunch'. I got the Mexican style scramble and my boy got the breakfast burrito, both were delicious! The service here is great-quick, but very friendly too. I love sitting at the breakfast counter as you can see what goes on in the kitchen. Having used to work in restaurants, I admire the efficiency of Yolk's kitchen.

I suggest the following nearby neighborhood brunch restaurants that have much  much better food and customer service: 11th Street Diner at 1112 S Wabash - The house french toast and any of their omelettes are amazing.  The owner Brad and his parents are usually working and they and the staff are always attentive. Bongo Room at 1152 S Wabash - Great savory and sweet choices.  Usually crowded but the staff are vigilant and the wait list goes quickly.  Their chicken and avocado omelette is the best.  One minor drawback is their breakfast potatoes are barely heated through. Waffles at 1400 S Michigan - Hands down, the most fun wait staff.  Attentive, funny and engaging.  Known obviously for their waffles, but their savory items are amazing. Little Branch Cafe at 1251 S Prairie Ave - Definitely a hidden gem.  Newer staff are definitely more friendly.  Try the daily special frittata.

Second....I asked for a small piece of watermelon for my toddler and he said that was a ""special request that required management approval"". What?! Mind you, the piece is about 3"" and comes standard on all the side plates. He came back and said that we'd have to buy an entire side plate to get the tiny piece of watermelon. Strike two. Third....as we were leaving I asked the hostess what was up with the lack of AC and I was again ignored. Strike three. I will take my business elsewhere. You have to wonder, how does a place with rude, petty people stay in business? In retrospect, I think the place has a long standing issue with the AC and is just getting tired of hearing people complain about it. But a bit of advice.....either fix the problem or apologize to customers who ask about it.

2014-06-30,4.0,Yolk! Decided to try this place out because it was closest to where we had parked early in the morning despite the reviews of this location - since there are about 4 to 5 other locations as well.  The place was definitely bigger than I had imagined for a breakfast/lunch place. The staff were somewhat pleasant - we got asked for drink shortly after we were seated and placed out orders shortly after looking over the menu. We ordered the South of the Border Benny and Yolk 2x2x2x2 Combo with Banana-Blueberry Crunch Cakes instead of regular ones. The South of the Border Benny was delicious and I really enjoy that it came with a variety of fruits as well as diced red potatoes. The Yolk 2x2x2x2 Combo with Banana-Blueberry Crunch Cakes came with regular pancakes. We didn't notice until we actually went to eat them. We asked the waiter if there was a mistake and he gladly put the order back in for the special cakes that we wanted. But is it a Chicago thing that when something was ordered wrong that they take the original dish and toss it out before giving the actual dish? This was the second time this situation had happened in Chicago! Why not save it for us to eat and not charge us for the mistake made?  This location is convenient for those who plan on traveling to the Museum Campus afterwards - only a few blocks away!

Fruit (a delicious variety of grapes, watermelon, orange slices, and pineapple slice) or yummy red potatoes PLUS pancakes, english muffin, or toast. Each dish came out to be a little over $10.

Food and plenty of it: I ordered the everything omelet which came with potatoes. Some of the tastiest red potatoes I've ever had. I could have eaten just a whole plate of those. My omelet was pretty good. I ditched the pancakes because all they had was maple syrup which I'm not a fan of, plus the omelet was pretty big.

Was charged 75 cents for tomato that was advertised to come with the sandwich. My friend was charged 1.50 for an extra piece of bread.  They took the charge for the tomato off the bill but argued that the burger was not listed as coming with mayo.  If you head to Yolk, better take your own condiments.

It's French toast, so of course it's a sweet meal, but the differences in flavors, along with the fruit toppings and peanut butter really elevated the dish for me. I also tried my friend's margherita frittata, which was another fantastic vegetarian find.

2014-06-18,4.0,"One of the best breakfasts I've EVER had anywhere in the U.S.! I've read a few of the negative reviews, specifically regarding the long wait, hard to hear PA system, average food and décor. I'm not really sure where these reviews are coming from, but I can attest that my entire experience here was absolutely excellent!  While on vacation, I came here for Sunday brunch @ about 9:30am and there were definitely a good amount of people waiting. The diner was bustling inside with lots of people, but it seemed the table turnover was really quick as people were always getting up as new customers were arriving. Also, with the diner being real big, there were tons of tables, booths and bar seating as well. The décor inside was very simple, clean, but it definitely had a bright ""morning"" feel to it with the yellowish paint. Despite what others have said, after only about a short 15 minute wait, we were called thru the PA system (which was loud and clear) and seated at a booth! When seated, we started scoping out other tables nearby and everything that was coming out looked amazingly delicious! The menu was huge and the options (Classic Breakfasts, Benedicts, Omelets, Skillets & Frittatas, Pancakes & Waffles, Crepes, French Toast, etc) were limitless. We just wanted to order everything because they sounded so good! Ultimately, we settled on the Countryside Skillet and Tour De France French Toast. Also, I ordered a plate of corned beef hash on the side. When the Skillet and French Toast came out, they smelled so good, we couldn't wait to get started! The Countryside Skillet was really cheesy, but there was a ton of potatoes in there mixed with the other ingredients (bacon, ham, sausage, mushrooms, onions, green peppers). With every single bite, I could taste all the ingredients in one shot. I loved the combination and it was a perfect mix in the skillet! As for the Tour De France, it was a flight of 3 pieces of French Toast (Banana Nut Bread, Sweet Orange Bread, Lemon Poppysead Bread) with bananas, strawberries and blueberries on top. The French Toast was extremely soft, moist and toasted perfectly. The addition of the syrup made this concoction even more potent and really brought out all the flavors of this sweet, savory goodness. To conclude, the service was also excellent as our waitress was very attentive and always came by to check on us. They were very fast and the food came out relatively quickly despite the amount of action in their kitchen.

2014-03-30,1.0,"The service at Yolk south loop may be the worst I've ever experienced, anywhere, in any type of restaurant.  The wait staff is painfully slow, the food is clearly dumped on your plate from warming trays in the kitchen and often poorly cooked.  Each time I've been there people around me have been sending stuff back to the kitchen.  I received 3 pancakes that were pitch black on one side (and of course turned over so that I wouldn't notice till I tried them).  I got two teeny tiny spoonfuls of crumbled, dry scrambled eggs that must have been scraped from the bottom of a tray.  I didn't eat most of what I was served but didn't send it back because I was with two companions and wanted to avoid any unpleasantness.  As I was paying, i did mention to the manager that I didn't feel that I should have to pay for an upcharge ($2.50) tacked on without my permission, and the manager tried to insult me by saying that the kind of customers they usually have don't want to be bothered with being told about upcharges (as if Yolk with all of its pre-cooked and pre-packaged food is actually upscale).  He then caused a hissy-fit scene by calling over the different wait staff members who had served me to interrogate them about whether they had mentioned the charge. Last, he slung the charge slip on the counter for me to sign.  When I commented that this behavior was uncalled for and less than gracious, he responded that it was appropriate since i was getting free food.  ALL this over a $2.50 upcharge???  REALLY????  Since my bill was close to $60 for three people for a basic breakfast that was, to be sure, rather poorly prepared, I can only say that there is something really wrong with the manager of this location.  Don't overlook the fact that that there are MANY other reviewers on yelp who have very similar things to say about the food and this particular manager.  Why does the owner put up with this guy?  Are they related?",-0.6908,0.885,0.048,0.067,0.4814074074074074

When I said that wasn't right the owner came over and had a back and forth conversation with the woman.  I came back to pick up the food. The fruit was there stewing in with the eggs so I asked if they could put it in a separate container. The manager came over and told me they don't do that unless you ask. I told him they've been doing it that way for me without asking for over a year now. He told me I was wrong.  My point here is that the conversation should have gone: Me - Can I get this fruit in another container? Owner - sure, but we don't normally do that unless you ask. Me - I did ask. Manager - I'm sorry. We didn't hear you. Here's your food. Have a nice day. Instead, 5 minutes later he calls me a bad customer because I'm arguing with him... but it's not me that's arguing. It's him, needing to get in the last word and be right at the expense or having a satisfied regular customer. I didn't yell. I didn't call him a name. I didn't insult him. I just stuck to my guns. I should have just walked away. $12 for eggs is not worth it if the experience leaves a bad taste in your mouth.

2014-03-17,2.0,"I've organized quite a few breakfast lunch outings for the office here, and this place has failed to impress on all counts:  food, service, and management.  They'll let us make reservations, but will refuse to seat us until the entire part of 15 is inside the building, even if 10 of us have made it through the front door and the other five are standing outside waving through the window because the front area is too packed for them to get in.  Yup, we had to wait until enough other parties were seated so the rest of our party could fit in the door. Food-wise, their tour de france is the way to go, which allows you to try three of their french toasts.  Other than that, I've been unimpressed with what I've ordered.  The three tiny pieces of my cinnamon roll french toast looked sad on the huge plate it was served on, and didn't fill me up.  The one time I ordered a skillet and asked for some items to be left out they weren't, the waitress didn't offer to have it remade, and I was still charged for it although it sat at the table pretty much untouched. Service here ranges from great to meh.  Sometimes we'll be hooked up with a birthday crepe for the guest (or douche, depending on the coworker) of honor, other times we get attitude if we say no when told we have to pay for it.  One time on the way out as I paid the bill at the register, the manager asked me if I was sure that was all I wanted to tip.  Um, the bill totaled $250 and I left a $50 tip.  When I asked if I should adjust the tip down to 15% of the subtotal, he shut up.  Note:  Be advised that if you order takeout over the weekend and they mess up your order, they won't put a rush on fixing it.  When they messed up my friend's wrap, he was told it would be a half hour wait if he wanted them to redo it, no cutting to the front of the line.  Awesome, when you waited 45 minutes for it in the first place.",0.8658,0.822,0.093,0.084,0.42880658436214

The granola in the pancake ruins the fluffy texture by adding crunch to the pancake, in my opinion. Also, because there was so much granola in the center, the batter in the center wasn't cooked completely through so it definitely wasn't fluffy there. They were still great pancakes though. I was also surprised by how much I enjoyed the breakfast sausages, which I am usually not a fan of and almost never eat. The bacon was a bit on the salty side and pretty average.  I will definitely return for more pancakes; next time I think I'll get chocolate chip ones!",0.9879,0.797,0.181,0.022,0.48045977011494256

They know how to serve a breakfast.They have a great assortment of vegetarian options, and can make a good breakfast sandwich as well.  The wait staff is incredible, and knowledgable. I've seen people complain about a couple of the waitresses in the past, but they will warm up to you if they see you come in frequently. I've had amazing conversations about music, movies, job leads, workout routines, and things to do in the city with the staff after they picked up that I show up fairly frequently. I once asked management and was told they like picking up a crew of ""understanding outsiders."" It makes sense after you've been there for a while.  It is also an amazing location, great for people watching and seeing the city. The counter (which is very classy and well built) is a great place in case you want to meet someone or just have a moment of solitude while you eat. And if you have a large group they can accommodate you pretty quickly if you give them fair warning. Cons:  They can be a bit inflexible with substitutions on the menu from time to time, and I've noticed that things can change depending on who serves you or is managing the place at the time. The hours are a bit odd too, as it could be kind of nice to have the place open a bit later in the day.  It can get very loud, and VERY packed quickly, and I would not recommend trying to come to the place on a weekend unless you show up before 8 or after 1:30....you find a ton of people from out of town, or people bringing relatives on it. But these really aren't problems with the service or the structure, more just a sign of how word of mouth has spread on the location.

My croque Madame was so god damn dry that I needed to ask for extra syrup. The fruit on my plate must have been in contact with my sizzling sandwich for some time before it was served because all of the fruit tasted like meat and half of it was cold and half of it was over 120 degrees.  My companions had similar bad luck with their fare. An order of apple cinnamon crates appears to have been placed under a warmer for some time before it was served. It's a shame they didn't use the extra time to prepare the dish which only included about 1/4 of an apple.  In addition, a steak and eggs entree arrived without the steak and the rest of the dish appeared six minutes later.  Now for the service. Warm water without ice was delivered to the table and the server told us the restaurant was out of ice. Then the table next to us was brought water with ice and when I asked out server for the same she argued with me that they didn't have any ice and relented when I pointed out the glasses next door. If your restaurant runs out of ice again send someone one block south to the jewel .... Ridiculous.

From the service to the food, everything was a big hit for me.  After my 10k competition, I had told my parents about this place I saw here on yelp called the yolk. So since the restaurant wasn't far from where the race took place, we walked over to Yolk. As we were approaching the restaurant I saw a lot of people and I mean A LOT and I thought are they waiting or is there patio sitting?? So as we got closer I saw everyone sitting down and yes I knew this was going to be a long wait. I was expecting about more than an hour to wait because there was people waiting inside as well as outside, but surprisingly when I asked the hostess how long the wait was she said 45 mins, and I turn into my parents and told them the wait time and we went ahead and waited.  Now, I am pretty sure we waited 45 minutes exact or even less. As we were seated, a young server came and offered us drinks. Her tone of voice and the way she smiled made me smile and feel cozy in the place, I even asked her to take a picture with me. So our drinks came out I had the plain old coffee which was really good, and both my mom and my dad ordered orange juice. After a few minutes she came and took our order. My mom had the Santa Fe Frittata with wheat toast on the side, my dad had the Tour de France, and as for me I had the Egg Benedicts (voted best in town) with red potatoes and fresh fruit. The egg benedicts were amazing. The English muffins were toasted to perfection and the pouched eggs were also perfectly cooked, now top that with some amazing hollandiese sauce and you got a exquisite egg benedicts and the potatoes were perfectly seasoned and cooked. Every bite was amazing. I agree with the best egg benedicts in town  I would definitely go back again.",0.9985,0.78,0.22,0.0,0.4400637009189641
2013-08-11,5.0,A fun place to visit. The interior is bright and inviting. The place was packed the day I got there but they were moving people pretty good so the wait wasn't bad. I ordered the cinnamon bun french toast which was quite delicious. Basically they take one of their large cinnamon buns cut it in 3 horizontally and dredge it in their french toast batter. Needless to say it was quite sweet but it was out of the ordinary so I had to try it. Service was friendly and prompt with my coffee cup always full.

Two friends and I rode our bikes from Uptown to meet a friend staying at the travelodge downtown on a Sunday so we knew what we were getting into. 45 minute wait outdoors in 80+ degree heat because their 10x20 waiting room had no seats. It had a nice 50"" plasma but no seats. So we sat outside with the other 30 people to wait.  20 minutes into the wait we finished the water in our bottles so I go inside and speak with an elderly woman at the host stand/register. I explained that we rode here from uptown and finished the water in our bottle so I asked politely if I could have a refill for one of the bottles to share. The crypt keeper straight up said ""NO"" without batting an eyelash. She then told me ""I'm not sending anyone back to get you any"".  You've got to be kidding me. If it wasnt for my two friends and our out-of-town guest I would have let loose and gone somewhere else. They should be lucky I practiced a modicum of restraint. I went next door which was coincidentally a bike shop and told them what happened. They said they were not surprised as they graciously filled my bottle from their utility tub sink.  I will NEVER frequent any Yolks ever again. It's a shame too because the food is pretty good and my gf drags me out to brunch every Sunday.

The other times I've been to this location I've experienced both so I was wary about coming here again when a family friend was in town this past weekend. I told my family that we had to be there at 9am to be comfortable and not wait over an hour for breakfast.  My sister and I got there a little before 9am and it was already pretty noisy. I put my name down and we walked over to the waiting area (or cattle room, as I call it, since there are no benches/chairs and people just stand there). We were waiting on 3 other people so they couldn't seat us, which is understandable. When everyone showed up, I told the hostess and we were seated within 5 minutes. So far so good.  We sat down and looked over the menu. I ordered the veggie skillet with egg whites and an English muffin. It had asparagus, tomatoes, mushrooms, spinach, zucchini, cheese, and 2 eggs on top. It was huge and I had to take home half of my plate. I had coffee and the refills were plentiful. My cup wasn't even half empty and the waitress topped me off.  I didn't try anybody's food but everyone seemed satisfied with what they ordered. My parents both ordered the French toast combo (my dad finished his plate, my stepmom couldn't and gave her French toast to my dad), our family friend ordered meat and 2 eggs, and my sister ordered the cheesy egg sandwich.

One of our party was parking while the other two of us went in for a table for three. We were required to wait for our third even though there were many open tables. While we were waiting in the very hot bull pen up front, the front staff had an altercation with an elderly gentlemen who mistakenly thought he had a reservation. Rather than deal with him patiently, the staff shamed him. He and his family left. I wish we had done the same. Instead, we waited in the hot area with no water or coffee on offer. In the more civilized cafes water and coffee are available while you wait along with seats and menus. This place literally has an open area for people to stand around in. This day it was very sunny and hot in that area. We, fortunately did not have to wait very long, because as I had explained to the rude and obnoxious front staff, my husband was merely parking the car. It was very unpleasant standing in the heat needing water and looking at no less than five empty tables. When we were finally seated we were seated at the front window at a very hot and dirty table. I guess the tables that had been open all the time we waited were props or something. By the time we left, the place was busier and there were ten or so people waiting in the hot bull pen.

Omelets are good with plenty of filling options, as are the crepes. I wouldn't recommend the flavored orange juice, but coffee is good.

I ordered a scrambler with Italian sausage, cheddar cheese, and broccoli with a side of pancakes and fruit. When our food finally arrived I was so hungry and eager to dig in. It wasn't until after my 3rd or 4th bite that I noticed a yellowish liquid floating around on the plate. I didn't think much of it and assumed that it might have been ""melted fat"" from the cheddar cheese (very stupid now that I think about it). I took a few more bites and realized it was actually RAW YOLK. I SHOULD have complained, but I didn't. I don't really like being ""one of those"" people, but I learned that sometimes it really is necessary. By that point we were already there for awhile and I didn't want to deal with talking to a manager and waiting for a new order so I ate a few pieces of fruit that were untouched by the raw yolk, finished my pancakes, which were alright, paid about $10 and left. I didn't think I'd have to let my waiter know that I wanted my omelette fully cooked, considering I've never had that issue at any other restaurant. It was disgusting.

The strawberry-orange juice was soooo delicious and fresh-tasting, I've been craving it ever since.  I ordered the Big Easy Skillet, because skillets are my favorite freakin' thing in the world.  This was a generous portion of diced potatoes, green peppers, tomatoes, onions, cheese, an absolutely obscene amount of andouille sausage, and two eggs sunny-side-up on top (because, duh).  The wheat toast on the side looks like white toast that is just a little tan - not a fan of that.  Can't you get some real multigrain toast?  So I can PRETEND I'm not a total brunch fatty?  Thanks. So the skillet was pretty tasty, in the way that cheese and meat and veggies and potatoes and eggs must be because there's no way that it could be bad.  Would've liked more veggies and less sausage.  There was just an absolutely stupid amount of sausage in there.  i was sorry I ordered it and wished I'd just gotten a veggie skillet.  It just wasn't balanced, and made the dish seem soooo heavy and unhealthy.  It would've been lovely to just have small chunks of andouille throughout instead of these massive slices layering the entire bottom of the skillet.  But if that's your thing, you'd probably love this.  They do have a lot of skillets and a build-your-own option so if you understand the allure of this amazing breakfast combo, give Yolk a try.  Order meat at your own risk!

We ordered the Fruit and Nut pancakes (wanted to be a little on the healthy side ;p) and Fresh-Squeezed Orange Juice (16 oz). The pancakes were... not what we expected, to say the least.  Not that it was terrible!  But multi-grain batter pancakes aren't too yummy, which made us reconsider our ""healthy"" choice, but oh well!  Girlfriend didn't like it too much, and I'm less picky but still didn't enjoy it wholly, so half a star for that. The orange juice was GREAT.  Tasted really fresh, and we couldn't get enough.  Was a little surprised that 16 oz was so small, but that's not their fault.  No stars marked off there.

What I did love though were the MULTIGRAIN PANCAKES!  You don't have to pay extra to get the multigrain pancakes on the side instead of the buttermilk (you DO have to pay an extra $2. something to get the specialty pancakes) and they were super filling but light, fluffy, and delicious. Also, great medley of fresh fruit with my omelette!  A slice of honeydew, pineapple, some orange slices, and a bundle of VERY juicy, sweet, and perfectly plump red grapes.  It's always an extra treat when it's yummy to be healthy :) The only issue that my family had was that the corned beef hash was not ""house-made"", according to the waitress (my mom predicted that it came out of a can...).

Nothing particularly special about either item, but both were solidly good.  I thought the benedict was a bit plain.  The egg was perfectly poached, but flavor wise the dish was light on seasonings.  I kept comparing it to the duck-confit benedict I had at Over Easy, which might not be fair but it fell very short. My friend thought the french toast was good, but it's french toast so it'd take effort to screw up. Since I live in the South Loop, I'd probably come back when other friends visit just for the location, but there are many more solid brunch options to be found in this fair city.

When I got back other people had already taken the seats we vacated so I assumed my friend had gone up to pay the bill.  After wandering around in confusion for a bit we went up to the register and asked if they had our bill.  Their response was, ""oh we weren't sure if you guys had left.""

Although we got to the restaurant only half an hour shy of closing time, they let us in, seated us, and didn't rush us one bit. Already a great impression! I ordered the Zamboni Crêpes with fresh fruit and pancakes. I was not expecting so much food! Two big crêpes with tons of stuffing (eggs, spinach, ham...), medium-sized flapjacks, and lots of fruit. I took home a whole crepe and half of the pancakes. My cousin and I also split some Nutella crêpes with bananas. So absolutely delicious. My cousin's kid had a good time coloring - the waiter even brought some extra crayons so he had more colors - and seemed to enjoy his pancakes. My auntie and uncle could not believe how much food was served, nor how inexpensive the meal was! It was tough to choose from such an extensive menu with such reasonable prices. I was totally impressed. We even were able to charge our devices; I told the hostess that I was the only person with a phone - my relatives were visiting from Canada and didn't want to deal with roaming charges - so they let my plug my phone in for a while near the register and I later plugged it in by my seat. The servers even knew which tables had outlets nearby. Whenever I come back, there will be tons of options. There will be plenty of options for many more visits to come! That might just be their trick... and based on how good all the food was on my first visit, I'm certain it will be great the next time. I hear it gets busy, but I can deal with a wait.

Our server should be in any other industry but service. I asked for coffee and when she brought it she just set it down on the opposite side of table where there was an empty seat. Very strange. She brought no cream so when she passed by again I asked for some. I waited 10 minutes. Our food appeared but still no cream. I asked again. She brought it out 5 minutes later with the toast my friend was waiting patiently for so she could start eating her now-cold eggs. No water refills. She checked in with us when we were done eating and ready for the check. Of course, by that time you are just happy you are no longer starving and anxious to depart this very noisy, dish-clattering ""we're the it place to eat breakfast so we really don't care if you're happy"" restaurant. Then, you get to wait in line to pay a bill with the single register. Clearly this is a family-owned business with old-school tendencies which I can appreciate but it wouldn't kill them to trust another employee to operate a second register during their busy times. Not too mention their register area is right in the middle of all the commotion and all of the people standing there waiting to pay, picking up carry-out, and ordering coffee to go are really in the way of customers and servers alike. The highlight is their creative menu and their generous portions. I had the Zamboni crepes which were yummy. They came with a side of fresh fruit and pancakes which I realize is a whole other meal.

On the menu it says goat cheese. I thought the cheese would be IN the frittata, not smeared on top. Not good for presentation and I had a ehhh face BUT the taste DEF made up for it.  My friend order the Chocolate Strawberry Pancakes. Looked amazing. Tasted just as amazing. I'm not big on sweet stuff and it was drizzled in chocolate syrup, but it was good. My friend loved it.

2012-09-10,2.0,"Meh. I came here this past Saturday for brunch. There was a 40 minute wait, which is to be expected, however it ended up not being worth the wait.  Our server was miserable, and it took 10 minutes after being seated before she appeared for the first time. When she took our order she didn't listen to me at all. I ordered the chocolate chip strawberry pancakes with no chocolate sauce on top. She said ""so you just want strawberry pancakes"". Umm no, if you are familiar with your own menu, you would know there are chocolate chips in the actual batter. I had to show her the menu description. I also ordered a side of pork sausage and as she wrote it down said ""side of turkey sausage"". They don't even sound alike, please listen.  Once you get the bill, you have to stand in line to pay at the counter. Maybe this helps them turn the tables over faster but standing in a line that starts in the middle of the restaurant where you are blocking those dining at the counter, dodging out of the way of servers delivering trays of food, and waiting 20 minutes to pay really detracts from my overall dining experience.  The vibe and atmosphere felt very much like a chain restaurant. If I didn't know any better I'd have sworn I was at Denny's.  The food actually was pretty decent and inexpensive. I thought my pancakes, which came out correctly much to my surprise, were good although did not come with enough syrup. Part of my enjoyment could have been the fact that it was 1:30 before I ate for the first time that day.  With so many amazing brunch spots in the city, do yourself a favor and skip this place unless you like enduring long waits and poor service for mediocre, chain restaurant quality.",0.967,0.819,0.114,0.068,0.4511507936507937

2012-07-31,1.0,"Yolk was another restaurant that I had wanted to try for a long time. Unfortunately, it was a major letdown during a recent Sunday brunch. It receives one star primarily because of health safety concerns. As a pescatarian, I don't eat bacon. Why did pieces of bacon (undercooked fat and cooked portions) appear in my plain BELGIAN WAFFLE (substituted in the TWO EGG $5.99 combo for about $3 extra)? This problem did not happen just once. It happened a second time when I requested a redo of my entire order. The other problem with the initial order was that the RED DICED POTATOES were burnt. They were just less burnt on the second attempt. I looked at the plate of a lone diner seated next to us, and her potatoes looked burnt as well. If a restaurant can't make the time to clean waffle irons properly, then they should dedicate irons solely to specific types of waffles to help prevent cross contamination. The waiter was understanding, yet it was a challenge to flag him down in the huge and very loud dining room. He offered to supply me with a couple of pancakes. I should have refused. A serious case of the ""lead in stomach"" effect happened soon after. Those were the heaviest pancakes that I had eaten in a long time. I felt a bit queasy in the bathroom, along with a burgeoning headache, after eating half. Also, my friend felt queasy after eating her pancakes, then noticed that one of her bacon pieces looked severely overcooked. It looked like a black, corroded strip of meat. It was replaced, but by then we were more than ready to give up on the experience. We were comped the waffle on the bill and the eggs were cooked correctly, but we have no intention of ever returning.

With nine people, there was a lot of variety at the table - Belgian waffles, Omelets, French Toast (with different fruit flavored breads) and even a cheeseburger.  Everyone seemed happy about the food. I didn't have coffee (I'm a Starbucks addict), but was told the coffee was good and strong. If you like your coffee sweet, they only have Truvia or sugar. The price was fairly reasonable.  It's a long haul from our house to get there.  (10 minutes to the train station, an hour on the train, then a cab ride to the restaurant.)  So, it's unlikely we'll return.  But, if we lived in the city, I would try Yolk again.",0.9937,0.796,0.204,0.0,0.5908163265306122

I had a made to order skillet of vegetables (zucchini, mushrooms, spinach, asparagus & fresh tomato) minus the red potatoes with a bit of shredded cheddar (not a dousing of it, but a taste) & two over easy eggs atop it. This is their Vegetarian Skillet, made to order. It was perfect! The eggs were just perfection & the veggies were fresh, top quality and cooked just right.  Coffee was good and it kept coming. They had regular and flavored creamers. For my side I had a pancake - this was cooked fluffy and golden crisp on its edges, again- just right.

Came here after a race downtown on a Sunday morning and boy were thou busy! Possibly overly busy due to the a lot of race participants looking for some grub and oj to keep them from dropping over.  The PA system worked well, people outside heard them, but they did favor people they ""knew"" over others that have been waiting for 20 minutes or more. But who doesn't play favorites when their friends walk in? I opted for the Southwest Benny ( yelp.com/user_local_phot… ) which was pretty decent, love the chorizo. My right arm man, the bf went with the French Toast Combo ( yelp.com/user_local_phot… ) which he enjoyed, but he's had better FT before.

The wait is extremely long with no seating, just a nasty dirty floor.  The service was just a bad as the seating. Once we were finally seated, 15 minutes later someone comes with water.  Then we waited another 25 minutes before someone came to take our drink order. Not passing up the chance for him not to come back for another 15-20 minutes I placed our order at the same time. 20 minutes later the server brings our drinks.   Needless to say, the hubby and kids were starving and lost complete patience while waiting for the food.  The food was slightly cool when were received it so overall, for the service I have to give Yolk 10 thumbs down. (That is two thumbs per family member.)  My hubby's food was actually pretty good, his omelet, though cool, was cooked perfectly.  My pancakes on the other hand were less than specular, I ended up leaving them and I truly dislike wasting food.  My eggs were rubber like and cold. My kids had the Oreo pancakes.  They actually love the pancakes stuffed and topped with Oreo crumbles.  Yolk was very generous with Oreo crumbles which was a big hit with the kiddos.   All in all, I believe that this is a tourist place and definitely a hang out for college students in the area.  If you have the time and the ability, there are far more better places to have breakfast in Chi-town and you can pass this one up.",0.963,0.764,0.153,0.083,0.5224074074074074

We had an accident at our table - water spilled and it took him 15 minutes to keep napkins to clean up the water. We tried to do it ourselves, but the bathrooms had no paper towels. When the waiter finally returned, we had moved away from the table as to not get soaked from the water. Then, the waiter cleaned the floor first. We just didn't understand this thinking.Fast forward, my food was great. I ordered the shrimp benedict because it was a twist on an old classic. Yum! The other members of my party were satisfied with the meals as well. My only negative comment about the food was they put everything on one plate..including the fruit next to the hot potatoes & hollandaise sauce.

Our meals did not take long to come out, I'd say about 15 minutes.  My combo came with two pancakes, two sausages, two slices of bacon, and eggs, which I had scrambled.  Everything was hot and tasty.  The sausages were huge and delicious, the eggs and bacon were tasty too.  The pancakes though, were not the best.  Don't get me wrong, they were good and I like them, but I'm kind of a pancake snob.  They were not fluffy or light, and just left me wanting a little more from them.   I also snagged a bit of my friends Biscuits and gravy which were very good!

The AC units don't blow into this part of the building and one whole wall is nothing but east facing windows. Needless to say it was extremely hot. Also, they did not have ANY chairs in the waiting area. What you are left with is a group of 30+ hot, ornery people sitting on the floor or standing for 45 minutes.

I didn't need my food right away but a chance to order something to drink would have been appreciated.  After getting a beverage the waitress disappeared for another 20 minutes.

2012-05-23,3.0,"Yolk is a reliable neighborhood staple for a very reasonably priced breakfast or lunch in the South Loop. I have been here several times and have always enjoyed both the food and service. Coming here on a weekday verses Saturday or Sunday brunch is much better, as you will find a relaxing, quiet atmosphere rather than the typical pandemonium of people vying for a table.  My favorite thing to order is the Belgium waffles with pecans. I always request them with strawberries, instead of bananas, and they are more than happy to substitute. They are cooked to a golden brown, generously filled with pecans and served with a side of caramel sauce. The combination of waffel and caramel is to die for! I've also tried and enjoyed their multi-grain batter pancakes, with either blueberries or cranberries and walnuts stuffed inside.  Two people can eat at Yolk for around 25$, which is a steal. It has a sunny, friendly atmosphere, and you are sure to walk away feeling satisfied. Yolk gets 3 stars because their menu is very predictable, I would love to see some more gourmet ingredients or unusual twists on the menu, but as a comfort-food place, its a true staple.",0.9624,0.831,0.147,0.022,0.6601111111111112

AVERAGE - Their pancakes.  I've tried to multi-grain, strawberry/chocolate (I think that's right) and plain.  They've all been ok, but nothing that's made me want to come back.  NOT VERY GOOD - The California omelette.  I just didn't care for the combination of garlic, avocado, cheese and egg.  Apart, they are all things I love to eat, so I thought this would be amazing.  However, something about the taste was off.  I ate less than a quarter of it and didn't take the rest home.

I can see why friends of mine enjoyed it in the past, but wouldn't say it's top notch as far as South Loop breakfasts go. The range of the menu is pretty astounding. You can get everything from huge omelettes that come packed with pretty yummy fillings and sides of pancakes, to baked eggs and crepes. The portions are pretty huge. My friend and I were seated at the front of the restaurant right next to the window, which was nice! The rest of the restaurant was incredibly crowded and a tad claustrophobic, so I was glad we snagged a window seat. Nice view out onto Michigan Avenue/Roosevelt. I got the ""When in Rome"" omelette ($9.99) which was stuffed with Italian sausage, spinach (I think? maybe it was basil), tomatoes, and mozzarella cheese, and topped with marinara sauce. I'd never seen an omelette like this on a menu before, and overall I'm pretty glad I got it. I got fresh fruit (mostly grapes and pineapple) and an English muffin as my sides. The English muffin was toasted, but already cold, so my butter didn't really melt on it which was too bad. My friend got the nutella crepes. They were pretty delicious and came loaded with strawberries and bananas on top. Overall I'd say that Yolk delivers a solid breakfast, and that it's a good place for hungry tourists. But the food isn't really that creatively presented (and I'm not sure it's trying to be). So perhaps Yolk's mission is to deliver solid food in huge portions, and in that respect they succeed. I prefer brunches with a little more flair, so I will probably stick to Bongo Room and Eleven City Diner around the corner on Wabash.",0.9979,0.703,0.259,0.038,0.6289724487398908

As soon as we were seated, our server immediately came to us, menus in hand.  The menu itself has a large variety of things to order and though it may not be great for those who are indecisive, it has a lot of different items on the menu for picky eaters.  The boyfriend and friends ordered freshly made/freshly squeezed strawberry orange juice which was quite delicious.  As for the meal itself, I ordered The Torero Scrambler, the boyfriend ordered Eggs Benedict AND Nutella Crepes, and the friends ordered Hey Ricky! Omelettes. The Torero Scrambler was pretty good; while most places only scatter scant amounts of chorizo throughout their dishes, Yolk. was quite generous and I was able to get a good amount of chorizo with every bite.  The only complaint I had was that the avocado was concentrated all in one area, making that one particular part a little mushy.  Still, good nonetheless. The Nutella Crepes are great for people who have a sweet tooth.  I love the fresh fruit that it's topped with--gives it a nice change of sweetness and texture throughout.  I definitely needed only a few bites to get my fill because it was so sweet, but it was also quite good. The portions that they give are HUGE.  I usually finish my breakfast whenever I go to any breakfast joint, but this was one that I couldn't.  For the price, it's definitely worth going.  And street parking was available only about a block and a half away.  Not too shabby, Yolk.  Not too shabby.",0.9835,0.806,0.157,0.037,0.6020658263305322

It was good, but I was hoping for more bacon in it. A LOT more. The bits of bacon are so small and scattered that I could barely taste it.

We have found the service and especially the food quality here to be highest.  They offer very healthy portions and you won't leave hungry, so be careful to ask the server about the size you are ordering so you don't overdo it.  This is one of my favorite places for meeting business associates who come in from out of town and want to have a private meeting over breakfast.  Not only can we talk, but the food blows everyone away.  I find my associates wanting to meet here when they come in from out of town and they don't even have anything to talk about - they just enjoy the p[lace that much. On weekend days after 9:30AM, you will find that you will definitely have to wait to be served since there are so many younger people in the neighborhood who like to brunch.  However, they vote with their feet and the traffic here is huge, deservedly so.  I just wish they had a place in the West Loop, but I don't mind traveling over to the South Loop for the occasional brunch to eat here.  This is truly a wonderful food place and good for everyone.  When it is cold outside in the winter, they have a larger area now in which to wait in the warmth which I find makes a difference on those cold Chicago Winter mornings.",0.9941,0.821,0.179,0.0,0.5950911228689006

If it weren't for us being on leisurely vacation, we would've been fairly annoyed with the wait. As for the food, everything was eggcellent! We had eggs benedict (they were decent but not drool-worthy) and the Mediterranean frittata (tasty and huge portions). I do have to say that my order, the peach cobbler crepe was the best of the three dishes. The order comes with 3 gigantic crepes. They might ask you if you want caramel or whipped cream on the side but I think the crepes taste great without it. It comes with sugar on top anyway. The crepes literally taste like fluffy thin eggy pancakes. I am not a huge fan of pancakes but these were addictive. And they gave a lot of peaches too. I got a side order of sausage just to add some protein into my meal. It was $2.99 and came with 3 really big sausage links - more than I cared for. I'd skip the sausage unless you just have to have it. If you're looking for a variety of great breakfast food, this is the place to be! What I love the most is that substituting for egg whites is FREE of charge! Most places are pretentious about it and charge you an extra dollar for it, but not here!

The service is friendly and efficient, the menu is HUGE so anyone can find something they'll like, the portion are very generous and they brew a spectacular cup of coffee. Whether I'm""m in the mood for something sweet or savory; if I'm feeling like a sinner or a saint (in terms of calories that is) I can always find something to satisfy!  I love their Belgian waffle topped with yogurt, granola and fresh fruit. That is such a good pick me up type of meal. They also have a TON of omelet options (all of which you can get with egg whites) that are quite tasty. I've tried their crepes and their pancakes (don't judge, I live a block away!!) and I've loved everything. My husband isn't really a breakfast person and has ordered off of the lunch menu and always is happy with his choice.  The other thing I really like about this place is that I've brought everyone from my 8 year old niece to my grandfather and everyone has really enjoyed it.

2011-07-10,1.0,"I live next door to Yelp. We've gone there frequently, but that is ending. After yet another terrible experience today we're done. The food is good enough, the place is big, and the service is typically fine...just so you know I'm not unbalanced. Three key reasons we're done with Yolk: 1) Air Conditioning: Seems its permanently ""being fixed"". I walked in today and put in a reservation for two and a baby. I asked if the A/C was working because it was hot by the door. The hostess woman said ""As far as I know"" without looking me in the eye. I took her word, but when we got our table it was sweltering hot. I don't care that the A/C was broken, frankly. It happens. But when someone comes in and asks for a table with a baby, TELL THEM THE TRUTH IF THE AC ISN'T WORKING. Neither of us was happy when my child spent the next half hour screaming in discomfort. Terrible for a ""family place"".  2) Coffee-The Lies Continue: We go to Yolk almost every weekend. Every time, we order coffee and realize there's no Splenda, Sweet & Low, or Equal. Only Truvia sweetener. Apologies if you like Truvia. I don't. It tastes bad to me. I am of the opinion that that is why 100% of other places offer splenda/sweet&low/equal. When you ask for some Sweet & Low, EVERY SINGLE TIME the waiter is instructed to tell you they don't have it, only Truvia. EVERY TIME, when you push back, they say ""let me go see if we have anything else"". EVERY TIME they come back with Sweet & Low. It gets to be overwhelming to have to go thru this charade every single visit. As a restaurant analyst, I can tell you for sure that messing with people's coffee is a one way street. I'm either going to remember to bring my own splenda every time, or start going somewhere else. Guess which one is likely to happen? 3) General Lack of Customer Service: In general, the wait staff is nice. Except when they have been trained to lie to you (air conditioning, sweetener, etc). The food is mediocre, but acceptable. Add a 30 minute minimum wait (usually 45-60 mins) and you can probably do equally as well elsewhere. Add some incident at almost every visit (like AC or lies about basic items like sweetener) and you can definitely have a lower-BS occasion elsewhere. We're also usually seated next to a container for dirty dishes so our baby has to hear glass crashing into it next to him the whole trip, or in the middle of some busy aisle where a stroller doesn't fit. Again, its not their fault that we have a kid. But just tell us if you can't accommodate us with a table that won't be in your way and we'll go elsewhere.  In general, this place has potential to be a nice breakfast place worthy of your business. But the constant lack of care or customer service basics really makes Yolk a bad decision for breakfast in the South Loop.

We stayed to eat here (because it was 1230am and I hadnt eaten all day and didnt want to find another place in the heat).  The service was sub-par.  Our water glasses were consistently empty (probably because we were drinking too fast as a result of the dehydration we suffered from not being able to shell out another $1.50 each for more water during our wait for a table).   The food did come fast; but it was nothing to write home about.  I've had better benedict's than the South of the Border that I ordered and the pancakes were pancakes....

Don't forget to have the freshly squeezed orange juice. The OJ always tastes so good like you're biting into a juicy ripe orange...never tart always tastes like the oranges are in season. Fresh blueberries were firm and ripe never in some artificial syrup to masquerade the taste of berries. I love fresh berries and this always hits the stop.

You won't be surprised when I say that Yolk's forte is its eggs. One of the few restaurants whose cooks deliver at the request of an over-medium egg, and make beautifully shaped poached eggs. Favorites include the benedicts and the skillets. I'm not totally in love with scrambled eggs so when I tell you that the omelettes are okay, that probably means they're pretty good.   But I'm telling you: there's a reason the place is called Yolk. Choose how you want your main dish and then pick your accompaniments accordingly. Pancakes are nice and fluffly. French toast is good too. My only tiny disappointment is that the corned beef hash is from the can, so I'll steer clear from that dish and remain happy with other options.

A huge group of my friends & I finished running the Hot Chocolate 15K in downtown Chicago & worked up a wicked appetite. Debated whether to head back to burbs or stay in city. We finally decided to stick it out in the city & head to Yolk. Of course... it was JAM packed. It didn't help that all the runners congregated to the same location as us. Average wait time: 1hr-1 1/2 hrs. Wooey. So we waited outside...waited some more inside, finally got seated in the back section.  I ordered coffee right away, and believe me when I say this..  I'm no coffee snob, but god dayum..it was nasty. Instant coffee nasty. Down right watery and not fresh. Thought my next cup or third cup would be better, but it was just funky.  For the main entree, I stuck to what my body needed. Hearty portion of carbs, protein, and more protein.    The WORKS omelette: bacon, sausage, ham, mushrooms, onions, tomatoes. Topped with Jack and Cheddar cheeses.      It wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything special.  Service was great despite the madness of the joint. She was attentive and made sure we got everything that we needed.

2011-02-02,2.0,"With our hotel's restaurant under construction, we spent our 2nd morning in Chicago at Yolk for breakfast. This place was packed upon our arrival, which made me feel that it must be a good place for breakfast. There were no tables available right away, but since it was just the two of us we opted for the bar. I ordered coffee, which was in front of me almost immediately after saying the words. The menu at Yolk is pretty overwhelming - crepes, waffles, pancakes, fritattas, ""scrambles"", traditional breakfasts (eggs + meat + hash browns + toast, etc.), oatmeal, omelettes, pastries, wraps, salads... anything your breakfast-loving heart desires. I ordered an egg white fritatta that included potatoes, chorizo, guacamole, and peppers in the mix. On the side came an english muffin (pancakes or toast were also options). My boyfriend got cinnamon roll french toast... two of his favorite breakfast foods combined, why not? The service was very quick, as the kitchen was ablaze with perpetual motion. My boyfriend's cinnamon roll french toast was basically a cinnamon roll, sliced horizontally into 3 disks, then put in a pan to toast on the bottom side of each. $8 + tax for a freaking cinnamon roll that was cut up and put in a pan? Rip-off. My fritatta was gigantic. For 10 freaking dollars it better have been! However, it was way, way too filling and despite ordering it with egg whites to give it a bit more of a healthy twist, it was dripping with grease. I ate less than 1/3 of it with my english muffin, but was so disgusted at this heavy meal I couldn't bear to eat any more of it. Every bite I felt like I was closer to death. There were two girls next to me who both ordered omelettes and got pancakes on the side. Just the thought of eating so much food makes me sick. The day before we went to a diner called Beef and Brandy, got coffee, OJ, pancakes, and 2 eggs with sausage, hash browns, and toast and spent $10 less than what we did at Yolk. I definitely will NOT be back to Yolk and do not see the appeal of this place. I never thought I'd think IHOP was a step up from anything, but it is when compared to Yolk.",-0.6467,0.869,0.061,0.07,0.39420634920634917

The pineapple thing looked interesting but we just got the meat and two eggs..I hate scrambled eggs, but I ate these for some reason. The pancakes were okay - nothing crazy special. The potatoes were yummy (But i love potatoes) and the turkey sausages were pretty good, they had an interesting rosemary-esque flavor which I liked!

Ok on to the restaurant.  Now considering breakfast is usually the cheapest meal of the day, someone please tell me why these new restaurant's are charging $5 for a bowl of oatmeal.  I mean come on, it's oatmeal.  That's like restaurant's that charges $15 for a tilipia dish.

The atmosphere was open and modern.  The kitchen was partially open so that you could see who was cooking your food.  They also had a lunch counter to sit and eat if you didn't want to wait for a table.  We ended up getting a booth.   It was crowded but we were seated almost right away (3 minute wait), and our waitress was busy but very attentive.  The clientele was the minivan driving set and also some who had obviously hit the club scene the night before and crawled out from under a beer box in search of hangover abating sustenance.    The menu was full of fresh fruit and tons of choices.  I ordered my standard pancakes, eggs scrambled with cheese and wheat toast.  My order came with fresh fruit, which is usually a huge side order charge at most places.  I ordered the strawberry orange juice which was super tasty and also some coffee, which they kept filled.  They had flavored creamers at every table in addition to non-dairy creamer.  They also had truvia and sugar in the raw which is a must. The pancakes are huge, taking up almost the entire plate.  Unfortunately I found the pancake batter to be a little too sweet for me.  IHOP is still hands down my favorite pancake joint.  The syrup was very good and served in little ceramic creamer pitchers.  The portions were huge and I didn't come anywhere close to eating my entire meal.  My dining partner was not as happy.  He loved the pancakes but had ordered 'The Works"" omelette but found that there wasn't much meat in it.  He picked his omelette apart and ate only pieces of it.  The prices were a bit high for breakfast but probably typical for Chicago at around 10 per entree.  Food came out fast in probably about ten minutes.

We shard a glass of delicious orange strawberry juice- wow! That stuff is seriously good!  For breakfast, I went with a Garden Skillet to get all the veggie but added ham as well. Breakfast potatoes with scrambled eggs and tons of veggies(+ham) came out and I was in love!  My sis had a bacon quesadilla which looked more like a burrito but tasted great. We also couldnt resist splitting a multi-grain pancake. HOlY COW those are tasty!  We came back for breakfast again before our trip ended. THis time I had a veggie omlette, and again added ham. It was HUGE and perfectly done. Loved every bite. Sis tried Some savory crepes that were superb. They had egg an avocado and were the perfect mix of sweet and savory.

I got the Zamboni crepes: ham, spinach, hollandaise sauce, scrambled eggs, and i'm sure something else..... =) i added mushrooms. Cuz I'm a mushroom junkie. I really liked it! The crepes were fluffy. Not flat or super delicate. But almost meat-y! But still sweet and light. No sogginess here. The potatoes that came with it are also really good too. Flavored, good on texture, good on salt.  Just the portions are HUGE!! Came with two crepes.  I finished only about 3/4 of one and got full. My bf got somethin else. Can't remember.

2010-06-17,2.0,"3 stars for food but  -1 star for service! Came here on a rainy/humid/sunny Chicago Saturday morning for brunch. Being from LA, where people use umbrellas in the rain and stay inside when the weather is cold, Chicagans are crazy! I was hoping by trudging through the rain, I would be able to avoid a long wait to the popular Yolk! INCORRECT! We waited a good 30 to 40 min before we were seated. But after the anticipation, my stomach was ready for breakfast :) I'm usually not a huge fan of eggs benedict but this is what Yolk is famous for! So I ordered the Eggs Florentine ($9.99) - 2 poached eggs atop an english muffin with fresh sauteed spinach, mushrooms, and tomatos. This is usually topped with a homemade hollandaise sauce - but I got my sauce on the side. I thought the dish was mediocre - but again I'm not a fan of eggs benedict. I did appreciate the generous amounts of spinach and mushrooms.. and the eggs were cooked just right :) My mom ordered Pancakes + Blueberry ($5.99 + $1.99) - 3 large multigrain pancakes served with whipped butter, powdered sugar, and warm maple syrup (choice of toppings: cinnamon apples, peaches, blackberries, blueberries, bananas, or fresh strawberries) The multi-grain option is great and the pancakes tasted gritty and healthy :) YUM! They were generous with the toppings, but for 2 dollars a pop - they really should be! Coffee ($2.30) was unlimited, but our server was so busy, I only had 1 or 2 refills. Which brings me to WHY I'm giving this uber popular place only 2 stars - HORRENDOUS service. Everytime I asked my waitress for ANYTHING, she just looked back at me like I was irritating her. UGH! And she never brought me ANYTHING! I don't understand why this girl is choosing to work at a restaurant. When I got up to pay, the cashier/hostess was completely incompetent and rude! The manager would come by and look over her shoulder and scold her... she would argue back. With the sighing, yelling, abruptness - I started to get annoyed. When I finally got to the cashier, the manager took my credit card swiped it and told me to stand ""over there""... he snatched everything from my hand.. and never thanked me once. I regretted tipping them at all. The long wait, crowded loud atmosphere, the rude service.. would allllllllllll be worth it if the food was delicious.

Now, my back was to her so I'm not sure what she did exactly but I think she got upset and just went back to her table. All of the sudden, he told her and her entire party to leave. I was kind of offended by that. It just seemed like a really extreme reaction to a customer complaint. Couldn't he have perhaps offered a free appetizer or something in the name of customer service? That really left a mark with me. The food was good enough, and they did get us a table in about 20 min despite the crowds. Was it awesome enough food to go back. Hmmm, it was OK. Just as good as other places I've been to. I'm just not sure I would be back based on principle, given how easily the manager was upset and the spectacle he created when he kicked those people out. They left quietly and without further ""drama"" and I remember the woman involved outside with her family saying, ""I can't believe that just happened.""

The HUGE menu-  so many choices, it was so hard to decide. The fact that my 3 ingredient scrambler was FILLED with ingredients. They did not skimp on my broccoli, feta or tomatoes. The child friendly table we were sat by the host- in the back in a wall, when our resident toddler and newborn started to fuss we did not feel as if we were ruining the meals of the other patrons. Additionally the host gave us crayons and a coloring sheet without having to be asked. The fact that our waitress apologized for our long wait (they had switched sections and there was a misunderstanding). Mistakes happen, but the fact that she acknowledged our long wait made me feel appreciated as a customer I did not love- The fact that my friend who ordered a egg white skillet with onions and mushrooms discovered pieces of HAM in her dish. The multigrain pancakes.....eehhh, they were tough and heavy.  My coffee did not hit the spot, it was weaker than I prefer, but I was given milk instead of cream upon request. I have to admit that I am partial to Meli, but Yolk's egg dishes were very good, and the laid back atmosphere, bright decor and prices make it a good place to go for brunch.

You could go back every week for months and try something different every time. Eggs, pancakes, crepes, skillets, so much variety you might find yourself overwhelmed. Sort of reminds me of the Pancake House (my favorite!) but cleaned up and without the grit and more expensive.  Some ADVICE: be prepared to wait! It gets very crowded very fast, even for a place with such a vast interior. I have never waited less than 40 minutes, the last time being on a Sunday afternoon at 11:00. Also, the parking around the area is difficult as it is Michigan Ave. But if you circle the block over to Wabash where you can frequently find street parking with pay meters and also some small pay lots.  As for the food: delicious! I love French toast. It is my favorite brunch item. But most places you go for brunch don't give you the option to get French toast with eggs and meat. You always find pancake combos, i.e. a short stack with 2 eggs on the side with either bacon or sausage. One of the things thats great about Yolk are all the options!!!! And they do indeed have a French toast combo with 2 eggs your style with both bacon AND sausage! That is hard to beat if you love thick, slices of mouth watering toast fried in batter, dusted with powdered sugared, and then lathered with butter and syrup. mmmmm....

Unfortunately I live on the north-end of the loop and Yolk is located on the south-end, but I happily make the trek. Parking in the area can be a big problem, however.

They have the usual breakfast fare plus a few of their own unique creations. Everything I've tried so far has been delicious. They also have some freshly squeezed juice that is typically overpriced. Unfortunately I am a sucker for the strawberry-orange juice, so I shell out the money for it every time and happily drink it down. Oh, the things I would do for that strawberry-orange juice... The biggest downside to Yolk is that it can get PACKED in the morning on weekends. Be prepared to wait. They have a small waiting room, however last I was there, they had no chairs or benches.

2009-12-24,4.0,"I was lucky enough on the second attempt to go to Yolk to pick Christmas Eve for brunch.  Good call on my part, as we walked right in and were seated sans any wait.   Yolk is tucked away and off Michigan such that you won't even notice it's there if you're driving by.  It doesn't help that they don't have a permanent sign either.  They have one of those plastic signs that ties down for their, uh, marquee.  It's not very eye catching from the outside, but I don't think people in vehicles are who they're trying to attract given the parking situation.  I was lucky enough to find street parking one block away due to the holiday.   Everything about Yolk is big: big, wide open space; big, extensive Greek restaurant style menu; big plates; big glass of OJ; big ass bowl of chili; and silverware apparently fashioned for Paul Bunyan.   The menu consists of about a billion breakfast items as well as sandwiches and burgers.  I got sides of corned beef hash, diced potatoes and a big ass bowl of loaded chili.  She got an omelette, pancakes and the glass of OJ, which is basically like having a hose attached to an orange tree (it's that big).  The potatoes were slightly undercooked and could have used just a tad more of a kick.  The coffee was only okay.  Oh, how I wish they had Intelligentsia here.  We both took home at least half of our meals.  You eat like a king here. This place has one of the better breakfasts in the city.  And the price was more than reasonable, especially considering the huge portions.  Service was pretty good.   I'll definitely be back as long as the wait isn't long and I can find parking nearby, if that's possible.  If I lived within reasonable walking distance I'd definitely be here often.   Recommended, especially if you don't have to wait.",0.9902,0.799,0.159,0.042,0.4368709895305639

Visit #3 was the multi-grain pancakes, which also lacked flavor and tasted rather blah; even the ""fresh fruit"" was wilted.

The only word of warning I have about Yolk is that the line is almost always long, so plan on eating there taking a while.  We went during the week once for a late brunch and still waited nearly half an hour.",0.9604,0.778,0.166,0.056,0.584861111111111
2009-09-05,5.0,"Thursday was a friends birthday and I wanted to treat her to brunch or lunch and I thought of Yolk because it is a little nicer of a place than she would normally go, and I remembered that they had good food and friendly service.  We got a late start, didn't wonder in here till about two o clock. I was hungry, I skipped breakfast thinking we were going to get an earlier start because we were also planing on going to the Shedd.  Anyway we were shown to a table and handed menus right away. My friend was amazed by the decor, it was just funny to see her reaction.It took us a while to choose since they have a  pretty big selection. She went with the Texas something or other omelet and i went with the country skillet.  Everything was fab the pancakes that we choose as the side were fluffy and sweet. My skillet was awesome. Had generous portions of ham, bacon and sausage, and the red potatoes were nice and soft and salty. They also topped it with just enough cheese and my eggs were cooked just like I wanted em. It also came with a side of saw mill gravy. It  had a perfect flavor to it. Once I fished up the eggs I just poured the gravy over the rest of my taters and meat YUM! My friend loved her choice and I got a little taste of it, It had just a little kick to it.  The waitress we had was super friendly and checked on us a few times while we ate and gave us coffee refills without us having to ask for them which is great in my book of things that make for awesome service.  When it came for the check she asked if we were paying together or needed two checks. I said ""Well its her birthday so I'm buying"" She said ""oh I wish I would have known before I brought the check would you like a little dessert or something?""  How nice was that? She went off and just a couple minutes wait later she brought out a crepe that had fresh strawberries, whipped cream, and was filled with Nutella! There was even a candle in it! It was such a thoughtful gesture that I had to mention it. Lets not forget too, that it was an excellent crepe!  (I still think the prices are a little wonky but in my opinion you really get what you pay for in this case! )",0.9928,0.849,0.148,0.004,0.5783521303258145

2009-09-04,4.0,"Brunch at Yolk?  After three visits, I'm long overdue for a review... but since it's Friday, I'll keep it shorter than my usual details. Food Choices - Standard breakfast fare.  The strawberry orange juice stands out as something different, and it's freshly made/squeezed/juiced for extra deliciousness. Food Quality - Excellent.  Eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, waffles, french toast... it's all done to perfection.  You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu! Price Point - For a uber-trendy hip breakfast place to be, this price is respectable.  You're not getting any great deals by any means, but it's acceptable. Food Quantity - Let me tell you, I always leave here stuffed.  I tend to be an omelette eater (and they are big) followed with the side of pancakes it comes with (which are light and fluffy) and then I roll over, pay the check, and roll to my car.   Verdict:  Excellent brunch place with standard American style choices with a few innovative twists thrown in (banana bread french toast with peanut butter?  Talk about dessert for breakfast).  The only drawback?  There's always a massive line to wait to get in... alas, this is what happens when the quality is good and the place becomes uber-hip-trendy.",0.987,0.783,0.173,0.043,0.49583333333333335

The food was fine.  Not worth the wait.  The portions are too large for any human being who isn't involved in some kind of intense physical training.  There are some things I liked about the space and it's decent enough but Chicago is full of breakfast places and this one just didn't do it for me.",0.7966,0.857,0.107,0.036,0.6075757575757575

2009-08-08,3.0,"Opening at 7am with our group arriving at 8:45 the place was jammed - but thankfully parking was close-by and cheap - with a line so long I expected good things and surprisingly we were seated in less than 15 minutes. Having already browsed the pastry case and seated in the middle of the large room I must say I was impressed by the food but taken back by the noise level - between the close packed tables, loud voices, and clatter of utensils I simply found the music unnecessary - even if it was Neko Case who is superb.  Greeted by our friendly server our water was filled and drink orders were taken along with an order for three pastry appetizers.  Arriving in short order my sister's tea selection, my coffee, and mom/aunt's orange juices were all good and my coffee was kept refilled quite adequately - thankfully I brought my own nutrasweet, though as Yolk had only Splenda and Equal. Following the beverages were our pastries.  Starting first with the blueberry muffin - lets just say it was still warm, super buttery with hints of vanilla, and loaded with very fresh blueberries - all told I liked it ($2) better than my Blueberry Baba at Spiaggia the night before.    The second pastry was their ""famous"" cinnamon roll.  While I can't say I've heard of their cinnamon roll before (as compared to Ann Sather's) I will state now that it has replaced Omega as my favorite cinnamon roll to date.  Creamy and luscious with heavy hints of cinnamon, vanilla, and butter the frosting was an additionally wonderful addition with its sour cream cheese essence lingering throughout the palate - I need to taste Sather's on my next trip to see if it even compares. The third pastry - homage to the previously mentioned LA meal - was a griddle grilled Pecan Roll.  While good and perfectly prepared with a crispy/buttery exterior I simply must state that after the cinnamon roll it didn't have a chance.  Good, but not ""amazing"" - just get the cinnamon roll, it costs less too. Sharing our appetizers around we were all primed for the main event and once again Yolk produced quite quickly - we had our mains within 20 minutes of seating and lingered over them for some time without feeling rushed at all.  Starting with my option - mostly because I always wait to see what everyone else orders before making my decision (in order to maximize tasting options) - Semi-sweet Chocolate and Strawberry Cakes.  While tasty, I personally found the cakes to be a bit doughy and (like Bongo Room the day before) more like McDonald's Hotcakes than I'd prefer.  Draped with a small dollop of whipped cream and even less chocolate I was fortunate that the strawberries were of good quality - but regardless the dish required a lot of extra syrup to be as tasty as hoped. The next dish, one of the two I'd wanted to order but was glad others had chosen so that I could sample, was my sister's Cinnamon Roll French Toast - essentially one of Yolks previously mentioned awesome cinnamon rolls cut lengthwise and griddled.  Without adding any additional cream cheese frosting aside from that which topped the original I'm not really sure why there was a $4 increase to simply pan fry this item and my sister noted that the top layer was way too sweet while the rest was way too bland.  The taste I had was quite tasty and well complimented by the maple syrup, but I'd stick to the plain cinnamon roll sans grilling. Ordered by my mother, Cheese Blintzes with Raspberry and Sourcream was a dish I'd not have ordered, but she didn't want something ""too sweet.""  Very well formed and appropriately airy crepes were served filled with creamy cheese and along with fresh sour (and I mean SOUR) cream and a wonderful raspberry compote.  Not a fan of sour cream in general I took one taste of the dish with sour cream and reconfirmed my belief.  Thankfully my mother opted to top each Blintz individually I did re-taste the dish sans sour cream when she couldn't finish and did appreciate the quality of the presentation and how the creamy cheese mellowed the sweet compote. The final selection, the dish I'd planned to order on browsing the online menu, was ordered by my aunt - Peanut Butter Banana Nut Bread French Toast.  Thick cut and crisply fried banana bread, a small degree of egginess, strong hints of cinnamon, and all the better when topped with Peanut Butter.  My only complaint would actually be the quality of the Peanut Butter - clearly a canned/jarred non-natural I would've much preferred something with less added sweetness. When it was all said and done I do believe Yolk was our cheapest meal of the weekend and I enjoyed the experience moreso than our meal at Spiaggia the night before - despite the packed seating I didn't get elbowed once!  With that noted, I can't say I'd return to Yolk on future trips simply because better options exist - specifically Bongo Room and m.henry.",0.9995,0.795,0.185,0.02,0.4740194945292034

Although I don't think I would go back on a nice day between 9-12, I have a feeling the line would have been out the door and around the block.

2009-06-27,2.0,"Once again I found myself with the intrepid David R. discussing our latest dining attempts and it turned out that Yolk was one that neither of us had experienced yet.  Enter: a cavernous space full of bright yellow paint, bouncing decibels, rushing waitstaff, and a host with a PA (a powerful weapon indeed). We waited something like 15-20 minutes in the open, airy waiting area until we were shown our seat at the verrrrrrrry back of the space. The very last table, in the very far corner. That's fine, it may have been a bit quieter back there anyway.  Greeted: our server was prompt and patient when we asked she return to get our orders once we were ready (David). After she walked away I was poured the worst cup of coffee I have had in a very long time - diners and fast food joints included. Seriously, this stuff was just awful. Not burned, not old, just bad.  Fed: Eggs Benedict - the egg dish by which all brunch egg dishes are judged. Now, poached eggs are by their natures, *just* over the edge of cooked. These were on the wrong side of that edge. Runny whites, to the point I scraped the runny bits off to the side to be avoided. The home fries were good, passable, but some weren't cooked all the way through. The fruit on the other hand, was fresh and very tasty. So was the fresh squeezed OJ. Oh, and the cinnamon roll was I think, better than Ann Sather's.  Settled: The prices are pretty much on par with every other brunch spot around town so I can't complain about that part.

2009-06-26,4.0,"Your mother and I were talking over coffee the other morning.  She worries that you don't eat properly - especially breakfast.  It is the most important meal of the day, according to 9 out of 10 moms.* I was telling her about how I really enjoyed having my first breakfast meal in Chicago at this place.  After showering, I took a morning constitution (aka a walk) 3 blocks south from the Hilton Chicago to arrive at a warmly lit, sunny yellow-and-blue palace of an eatery. The Midwestern hostess was perky, giving me a cheery ""Good morning!"" and asked if I wanted a table or seat at the counter.  Since I wanted to spy on the kitchen, I opted for the counter.   The booths, tables and chairs were mainly blond wood and evoked an Ikea feel.  Since I didn't need the Ikea-like chair to last 30 years or get passed down to future generations, it was fine enough since I only needed it to last for an hour as I ate my meal. My server was a no-nonsense gal in her 20s.  Pleasant, prompt, and eager to work.  If only we could all have co-workers that could be described as such.  But, I digress.  I ordered the French toast combo platter:  two eggs, two strips of bacon, two sausage links, and two slices of French toast for $7.49.  Matched it with a cup of coffee ($2.49). Another Yelper was kind enough to take a ""glamour shot"" photo of said French toast combo - it really does look like that in reality and tastes even better.  The plate was accompanied by a ramekin of butter; the sausage links were flavorful, meaty, and smoky - these were a perfect pair-up to the French toast.   The bacon was a little soggy for my taste but did I put them down?  Nope - unless ""down"" means down my mouth.  The scrambled eggs were fluffy but I forgot to ask for egg beaters instead at no extra charge.  Ah, my doctor is going to love my cholesterol reading. I left full, happy, and with an increased cholesterol reading.  As for your eating breakfast, what should I tell your mother?  She worries, you know. * I have no scientific basis for this statistic.  I only really survey one mom:  mine.  She gives me plenty of advice.",0.9774,0.854,0.113,0.033,0.482249322493225

Yes, there is often a wait, generally on the weekends; however, this place is very close to my apartment and I go quite frequently. I've had to wait maybe three times for a table. You need to be wise about when you go, honestly. We often go on weekdays toward the end of the brunch times (but be careful, they close at 3).  One of my favorite meals on the planet is Eggs Benedict. Yolk does them fantastically. I love the fruit I get on the side; even in the dead of winter it stays fairly fresh. My fiance always gets the corned beef hash, and I often steal bites from it. My brother enjoys Diabetic comas, so he gets the cinnamon bun french toast and a large O.J.  I had the BLT the last time I was there, and it was also pretty good.  All in all, yeah, there are often waiters who look like they leave directly from the restaurant to go to their classes at Columbia. This is part of the charm of the South Loop, as I also know several Columbia students I don't mind (my fiance is one of them).

One of the other things that I've recently come to appreciate about Yolk is that the counter seating makes it an easy place to go to solo if no one wants to wake up and join you for brunch (but you're really hungry and feeling deserving of a nice brunch).   I do prefer Yolk in the summer to the winter, because it's much more pleasant to be able to wait outside.  And while the wait can suck, at least you expect it (and they do turn tables over quickly).",0.9727,0.78,0.187,0.033,0.48333333333333334

I indulged in the Santa Fe, a spicy egg lover's dish.  Perfect chunks (not bits, chunks) of jalapeno dotted my eggs along with bacon, avocado, green onion and tomato topped with cheese and sour cream with a side of good salsa.  James had the Popeye: red potato, bacon , spinach and onion topped with jack cheese.  We had pancakes on the side (we're gluttons) which tasted like sugar ice cream cones - a little crispy, sweet and a hint of nuttiness.   Service was very fast and friendly for such a busy place.  Our waitress really knew the menu and answered questions honestly and cheerfully.  We had to hustle to catch our plane, so the friendly speed was appreciated.  I can see why this place would be difficult to get into on the weekends.  Note that there's a parking garage just next door to the south of Yolk.  It was $12 for an hour, the restaurant kicked in $5.

Service is great, and surprisingly fast despite the fact that the dining room is usually packed on weekends when I go. NOTE: You will have to wait ~30 mins or so, if you try to go on a weekend during normal brunch hours--the front of the restaurant will be packed with people waiting to eat. But they're very good about this and they actually estimate the times properly (ie if they say 30 mins, it'll be about 30 mins... not like at Grand Lux where 30 mins is actually 2 hours) First of all, their pancakes are AMAZINGLY fluffy and just delicious in a way that makes me love them (even though I usually shy away from plain pancakes). They come as sides for many dishes, or you can order them as your entree. The potato pancakes are quite good, too. But, of course, the crowning glory of this place is the eggs! (Obviously, the place is called Yolk... ie egg yolk... inside eggs...). Their omelets are giant in a way I've never seen in a restaurant--and absolutely packed throughout with fresh ingredients. (No flabby greasy flat eggs here, folks).  And if you don't like eating lots of egg yolks, (ie diet, cholesterol problems, etc), you can substitute for egg beaters or whites for FREE. Whoohoo! Their eggs benedict are also very good--they have a few varieties (ie normal, Irish w/ corned beef hash, etc) and I think over the course of my visits, I've tried all of them and they were all very tasty :) By the way, the walls are painted YELLOW and BLUE which makes the restaurant feel oh-so-happy for weekend mornings. Nothing wakes me up better than Yolk!!! Parking is iffy, since it is South Loop... Yolk does validate 2 hrs for $8ish but I'm not sure where the lot is (haha).

Our waitress was almost too friendly and was one of the highlights of the meal.  She was there for our every need and we rewarded her handsomely for her hard work. OK, OK, I know you want to hear how you too can eat for pennies and be full for a day(s) on a single meal.  The sweet tooth kid in me stumbled upon three words that had never been matched together until now: ""Peach Cobbler Crepes."" Game-Set-Match.  These crepes came loaded with warm peaches and topped with a sugary crust on top that made each bite sinfully sufficient.  After eying the other appealing option, the Banana's Foster Crepes, I was very pleased with my selection.

2009-02-08,3.0,"I'm tentatively giving Yolk 3 stars. I read somewhere online that Yolk has an egg-stuffed crepe dish with hollandaise sauce and I thought that sounded really good. I mean, I like crepes and I like hollanadaise sauce, so put them together and you have a hit! Well, not really. The dish is called ZAMBONI CREPES: scrambled eggs, ham, and spinach folded into two crepes (separately) and topped with hollandaise sauce. It's served with red diced potatoes or fresh fruit and toast, pancakes, or an english muffin for about 10 bucks. I got potatoes and english muffins. (A LOT of food for one person. Should be shared, although I didn't.) Hmmm... how can I put this? OK, I know I could have complained about the following things or asked for them to be changed around a bit, but I didn't. I'm complaining now, right? (Passive-aggressive, I know.) To begin, there's nothing really that special about eggs with ham and spinach. Again, although I didn't ask to replace any of the ingredients, I think this combination is a bit lame. Another not great thing about my dish was that there wasn't enough hollandaise sauce on it, at least not enough for me! Like, that's the whole reason I went out for breakfast, so could you please not be so skimpy with the hollandaise? I'll pay for extra if I have to, although I don't think I should have to pay extra for a few extra spoonfuls of hollandaise. Anyway, the hollandaise sauce that WAS on the dish was delish. The crepes were fluffy and well made. But the dish as a whole was weighed down by the unimaginative ham-spinach-egg combination, and the lack of Hollandaise sauce. For a place that seems to be aiming for frou-frou with their dishes, this dish is more like a boo-boo. The space is nice. I was at a table because I asked not to be seated at the counter (party of one) and really liked the spot I got in the rear of the place, where it was quieter. The hostess was pleasant and polite, but the old man (who looked like he might be the manager) who took me to my seat just slapped my menu on the table and walked away. Apparently he slaps the menus on the table for everyone, or at least I saw him do the same to a few other patrons. Seriously. Are you trying to lose customers? Hand them their menus. At least, hand ME mine. Luckily, the old man manager-or-whatever's behavior was quickly nullified by my server's extremely pleasant, unfussy, polite manner. She was attentive, but not overbearing, and very efficient. She got me everything I needed, except a water refill, which I did have to ask her for, but I let that slide because it WAS quite busy. I was surprised it was that busy so early. Otherwise, my coffee cup was refilled with fresh coffee several times (the coffee is great here) and I was left alone to enjoy what I could enjoy of my breakfast and read the New York Times. I'll probably come back and try to get them to dress up the eggs in my Zamboni Crepes with something a little more fun. If they won't do that, I'll try something else. I'll also try to get them to spoon a little more hols sauce on my dish. If they don't do that, then I probably won't come back.

2008-11-04,4.0,"My boyfriend and I went here a few weeks ago on a Sunday when I was craving breakfast food. I'd read some of the reviews on here and saw that they generally have a long wait. We didn't have that problem. We waited 5 minutes and were asked if we'd prefer to sit at a table or the bar, and we chose the bar. He had a cheeseburger and it was pretty good. I guess you could call him a cheeseburger connoisseur, but also it's his fallback food when he can't pick anything else. He liked it a lot and so did I, and he's hard to please sometimes as far as cheeseburgers go. I however, opted for breakfast and ordered eggs sunny side up with white toast. I find a lot of times when I order them that the eggs are runny or the toast is overcooked or just waaaay too buttery. I have intestinal probs, so tons of butter is bad for me. Needless to say, I totally forgot to say no butter (usually foods I order don't have much) and I was pleasantly surprised to find that they barely put any on it at all, which is not only healthier in general, but would allow people to put however much they want to on instead of having a cook do it for them. It's a little pricey for what it is, but that's okay. It was good food and I want to go back sometime as well as go with people who come to visit us.",0.9697,0.831,0.134,0.035,0.5264492753623188

2008-10-25,1.0,"With all the great breakfast places in Chicago, why would anyone choose YOLK? After all, the food here is served-to-order, not made-to-order. Perhaps patrons hail from the newly developed South Loop where restaurant and shopping development still lags the many new condos. So convenient choices are slim. If I lived in the neighborhood, I'd make the trek to someplace good. What do I mean by ""served-to-order""? It's readily apparent that breakfast here is made en masse, like a factory, in anticipation of general demand, not cooked in response to an order taken by a waitress. But unlike a factory, there's no quality control between the production line and the consumer. The first clue that this is a food factory is the enormous number of seats in the restaurant. Only a cafeteria/buffet approach could feed the hoard if the restaurant were full.   But the real proof is evident in the food. Scrambled eggs arrived hard, luke-warm and chopped up. They were pre-made and scooped from a warming tray - but even the breakfast buffet at Marriott Courtyard beats these eggs. Bacon was not cooked to be crispy. The fat was somewhat raw and I'm sure chewy, if we had the stomach to actually eat it. Pancakes were gummy, chewy, flavorless disks. Again, I'd suspect they came from a warming tray. If not, I'd remove the latex from the recipe. Even the toast was inedible. It showed signs of toasting around the edges, but would be more accurately described as a cold slice of bread. In fairness, an order of hash with poached eggs was much better. Nothing special about the hash, but the kitchen did properly poach the eggs, and many breakfast restaurants fail that test. I guess it's a sign that if the kitchen must cook something to order, they can do it competently. Believe it or not, the worst part of the meal was not the food. My companion simply couldn't eat what she was served. Her meal was sent back, and she declined to order something else. Soon the owner - maybe manager but he called it ""my restaurant"" - came to our table. ""I looked at your plate and I couldn't see what was wrong with it,"" he said in a tone of inquisition. The conversation deteriorated from there. I think this is a man who simply should not be in the restaurant business.

The stuffed French toast was a little heavy on the cream cheese, but good nevertheless. The raspberry sauce that came with the French toast was very good. Lastly, the sausage links were fantastic.

Filled us up on coffee. Food came out what appeared to be 15 minutes later. Perfect.  My friend had The Ricky: Spinach omelette with charizo, avocado, green pepper, onions, jack and sour cream. She upgraded her side with an extra $ 1.95 to fruit and nut pancakes. That's right, a side option to the omelette is their to-die-for pancakes. Totally satisfied. I did the Big Texas Fajita Omelette with grilled chicken, onion, green pepper and salsa. Comes with cheese and sour cream but I passed on both. Had it made with egg whites for no extra cost which was really good. Only complaint was the chicken: more shredded Chicken than fajita style tender strips I was expecting but none-the-less really good. He even brought me extra salsa. Side of fruit was amazing.

So is the place worth the wait?  Depends on what kind of tolerance you have for waiting to eat overpriced eggs and pancakes.  Now that is not to say Yolk's overpriced eggs and pancakes aren't good.  My fiancee enjoyed her Countryside Skillet (bacon, ham, sausage and other goodies) and I was pleased with my Hey Ricky! Omelette (spanish omelette with avocado, chorizo and other goodies).  Also, Yolk lets you ""upgrade"" your boring, normal pancakes to their super duper, specialty pancakes.  My fiancee and I took the bait hook, line & sinker and upgraded to the Fruit & Nut Pancakes (a little on the dry side) and the Chocolate-Strawberry Pancakes (sinfully sweet).  But all in all the food is nothing special, on par with what you could theoretically order at your local IHOP or Golden Nugget. Another thing to note: because the place is seemingly always jam packed for brunch, service can be very spotty.  Our server was friendly and what not but we didn't like having to constantly remind him that we needed refills on our coffee.  Since the place is like a zoo, I can't say I was surprised but it definitely didn't make for the best brunch experience.  So I guess Yolk is worth a try if you have never been there before but definitely don't judge the place by how many people are waiting for a table.",0.9421,0.844,0.1,0.056,0.5125192012288787

The good reviews and my snobby cousins ravings about Yolk's excellent cuisine has lured me in to the Oz like atmosphere yet again. I have my mother at my side for moral support as we are escorted to a booth by a friendly host. So far so good. I sulk down into the booth and order a large OJ. The drinks arrive promptly and the orange juice tastes fresh squeezed. I think to myself ""Hey, maybe everything is going to be okay.""  Now you may be confused as to why I am so weary of this mornings  breakfast but this is not my first time at Yolk. It is actually my third and even though the first two experiences were less then stellar. I decide to give it one more chance. ""Maybe this time it will be better, was it really that bad? How could so many Yuppies get it wrong?"" But No my friend, I can no longer make excuses for the shotty food at this dive joint parading around as a hot spot.  My first experience there was about a year ago. I live about a block away so I walked over with a friend and we decided to treat ourselves to a nice brunch. I had  the Countryside Skillet and my friend indulged in the Cinnamon Roll French Toast. The skillet was greasy and the French toast was dry.  My second experience I ordered take out, an omelet and crepes. The omelet was bland, overdone and the worst part was someone had the grand idea to put an orange slice as a garnish on my omelet. ""Mmm there is nothing like an egg white omelet with spinach, bacon and orange!"". The crepes were thick and rubbery.   My third and my final experience, because I do not plan on returning was just a few days ago. I was a bit hung over and incredibly hungry. I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap. My mother ordered the Huevos Rancheros. The Wrap wasn't horrible, the dressing was a little heavy and the chicken didn't feel crisp, but all in all it wasn't half bad. The Huevos Rancheros though, I thought was sub-par. It had some kind of ground beef masquerading as chorizo that reminded me of the meat you got on Taco Day with your school lunch. It was also incredibly greasy.

For the meat eaters in the crowd, the country skillet is fabulous - my dad was sold with this concoction with multiple kinds of meat thrown together with the potatoes and eggs any way your picky egg eater wants.  Oh, and they truly deal with their namesake well - no undercooked or overcooked eggs here. For the ovo-lacto vegetarian types, there are a bazillion options, including the delish pancakes and french toast, or the veggie skillet in which the asparagus is actually cooked well!  The eggs florentine, the spin on the benedict without the pig, will also serve those veggies well. My roommate salivates for the Sante Fe Frittata bi-monthly, loving the way they throw in both jalepenos and avocados in this piece de resistance.  Personally, I try something new everytime. The eggs benedict is fabulous.  The hollandaise is homemade.  The eggs are poached to perfection.  The scramlers are really well done, especially the cajun one - delicious!  I love their omelettes!  And I am a girl who really doesn't like pancakes, but I actually split a side order with my Sante Fe Frittata loving roommate because these are deliciousely cake-y. The food selection and its preparation is what makes me come back time and again to Yolk.  Yes, if you go during peak brunch hours on the weekend, there will be a wait, it is just that good - and popular.  Duh.  It happens.  If it sucked there would be no one there.  Because of this, service is quick moving, but not usually bad.

The skillet was tasty - hot well-seasoned potatoes, slightly spicy turkey sausage, and just the right amount of cheese to make the dish cohesive.  The savoriness was also a welcome reprieve from the french toast and the pancakes.  The pancakes were also too sweet - covered in chocolate sauce and without enough tart strawberries to balance it out.

We'd made our reservation a couple weeks in advance, but they seemed somewhat surprised to see us all. I'm not one of those people who thinks a breakfast place sucks if you have to wait to be seated-- if it's a popular place, it's going to be crowded and you'll have to go during an off-peak time if you don't want to deal with the crowd. But Yolk definitely does not have enough spare room to deal with all the people lining up. When the first few people in our party started showing up, the host kept trying to jam them into the corner even though there was no more available standing room.

He finally sat us in two groups at two different tables (although they were next to each other). In my opinion, we'd had the reservation for long enough that they should have accommodated us better.

2008-01-12,4.0,"The thing you have to keep in mind about this place is that it's busy.  The neighborhood it's located in is growing in size and popularity so you're in for some wait when you show up. I've had the pleasure of eating here for both lunch and breakfast and the impression is that this is a breakfast place first and a lunch place second (as evidenced by the name of the establishment).   Having said that, the lunch sandwiches are hearty in portion and very tasty.  You'll readily notice that the traffic is less than the morning shift and for what it's worth, a decent change of pace and mood.  The entire place, in comparison to the mornings, will seem a bit deflated and lax.   Not to say this is a bad thing.  No, I'm of the firm belief that changes in meals dictate an equal change in mood (and pace) and this place seems to mirror this. The mornings are chaos.  If you're looking for a quiet meal where you can sit alone in a corner pouring over your crossword puzzle, Yolk would not be your first choice.  No - this place is as busy as you're going to get.  People mob the waiting room and everyone is either busy trying to get on the waiting list, trying to deduce when their turn is up or sorting out the bill to escape the craziness that is inside. As for the food, I'm a pretty basic breakfast kind of guy.  I don't require fancy omelets, special pancakes or crazy juices.  I'm a scrambled eggs, sausage links, toast and orange juice man.  Easy and straight to the point.  While Yolk does indeed cater to the people who require more attention to their breakfast than I, I'm happy to report that they make a decent meal for my tastes as well.  It's really hard to mess up scrambled eggs, toast, sausage links and OJ (the drink, people - not the misguided ex-NFL great) and admittedly, this place is a bit on the high end in terms of price for such a simple meal as mine but to dismiss this place as expensive would be a shame and incomplete.   I fully understand that cheaper alternatives exist (I can certainly make this meal at home for a fraction of the time and cost) but I seriously doubt that such an atmosphere that is ""breakfast at Yolk""  can be duplicated.  The morning rush has to be experienced to be fully understood and appreciated. Some people would blanch at this and this is understandable.  If you're one of belief that a breakfast should be enjoyed in peace and w/ as much breathing room as possible, you may want to reconsider Yolk as your breakfast option and come back for lunch.  However, if you enjoy having people nearby and don't mind the occasional side conversation pervading your meal while you eat, then this is definitely for you.",0.9717,0.858,0.093,0.049,0.4821851851851852

Service is a little slow, but the ambiance in the restaurant is great for people-watching and getting pumped for a football game.

Environment At 2pm this place had no wait, which was refreshing... I expected it to be packed, not the case.  On second review the decoration and atmosphere is pretty nice.  Modern, yet relaxed.  Very clean and bright.  Our server was top notch, albeit a little coffee-refill happy.  (I later wish I let him fill my coffee more, that bitch was $2.50!) Food My boyfriend had an omelet with fruit instead of potatoes and a side of whole grain strawberry/banana pancakes.  The pancakes were really, really good.  I assume they were healthier then regular pancakes, but who knows... They were damn good.  The omelet was good as was the fruit.  I have a huge chicken walnut salad.  The salad was great.  It had avocado, romaine, chicken, walnuts, mango with a raspberry dressing.  No cheese though... I guess it's more healthy that way. Drinks So, generally, I am opposed to paying insane amounts of money for juice.  (See review of Orange.)  The 6 ounces of fresh squeezed strawberry orange juice was heavenly... for a mere $3!  It was worth it.  The coffee is waaaay to expensive, and just okay... who knows what brand it was.

Owner Taki graciously greets you when you walk in the door and you immediately notice the big spacious feel of the place with tall ceilings and modernist decor.  I sat at the counter and noticed the gentleman next to me was pounding a massive veggie omelette.  I love when establishments serve big portions - it's the American way.   I usually prefer one-page menus - but Yolk has so many mouth-watering options that I found myself deciding amongst three or four different choices.  Fritatta?  Cinnamon french toast?  Omelette?  I made a last-second, gametime decision of the Countryside Skillet, which was a delicious combo of meat, potato and veggies covered with eggs and the most scrumptious gravy you've ever tasted.  I would never even think to add gravy to this dish - but I found myself practically licking the last bits of gravy out of the bowl.  You also get a side of pancakes - and I highly recommend the chocolate/strawberry cakes (especially if you possess a sweet tooth as unsatiable as mine).  Another little twist is the fresh-squeezed strawberry/orange juice - trust me.

2007-04-07,1.0,"Woohooo what an experience my friend and I had at Yolk. We got there and the place was packed and there was a huge line waiting. But, you know...we went on a Saturday and since the place still has the new ""buzz"" going on about it...of course it's going to be packed. We were told 20 to 25 minutes wait and I thought ""Yeah, right...with this line of people in front of us?"" but sure enough about 25 minutes later they were calling my name. The restaurant itself was cheery and bright. All blues, yellows and whites.  The server came fairly quickly and poured me some coffee. I was pleased to see they had a variety of creamers on the table. Ooh, french vanilla! We looked at the menu during those 25 minutes so we knew what we were going to order. I ordered the Iron Man which was an egg white scramble with veggies and avocado with salsa. My friend ordered the belgian waffle and asked for it WITHOUT powdered sugar and some turkey sausage on the side. The food came out about 15 minutes later, no big deal we chatted and drank our coffee and juice. When the server came out with our food he mentioned to my friend that the kitchen had put powdered sugar on the waffle and placed the plate down in front of her. She said that she wanted it without the powdered sugar...so he took it back. No big deal. Server comes back a few minutes later with another waffle. My friend thought to turn the waffle over and..yep powdered sugar on the other side. They basically just wiped some of the powdered sugar off and flipped the waffle over. Great. So she flagged down the waiter and showed him the waffle and he took it back to the kitchen again.  The next thing that happens is the reason why we will never go back to Yolk. This guy comes over with a stripped shirt to ask if we had a problem so my friend basically gave him the run down of what happened. The guy, who later we found out was the owner, told us that they normally will just wipe off the powdered sugar and return it to the customer if it is the customers mistake...since the menu clearly indicates that the waffle comes with powdered sugar. (indicating the mistake was ours) Great...wasn't the customers mistake tho. He then mentions that the waiter didn't have it on the ticket that she wanted the waffle without powdered sugar so that is why the kitchen put it on. Fine..whatever...why are we having this conversation? We didn't make a big deal of it when it happened but clearly the owner had his own issues. We told him that when the waiter came over with our food that he mentioned before even putting the plates down that the kitchen had made a mistake and put the powdered sugar on the waffle...so clearly my friend had asked for the waffle to be without the sugar and why were we having this discussion...just get another waffle...one without powdered sugar! He then goes on to tell us that he hadn't even talked to the server yet to see if the server had made a mistake...that the server just brought back the plate twice and he wanted to see what was going on and to explain how the kitchen works when customers make mistakes. (again indicating the mistake was ours) We don't give a rats ass how the kitchen works and the fact that he came to us to read us the riot act without getting his facts straight is just plain shitty.  My friend got another waffle from the kitchen, my egg white scramble sucked but the server did come over and apologize and admitted his mistake and actually apologized for the owner as well and mentioned that the owner was ""high strung"". We actually left the server a good tip because it was an honest mistake and one that he admitted to. Our problem is with the a-hole owner who clearly doesn't believe in providing good customer service and who clearly doesn't believe that the customer is always right....even when they really are right!",0.9939,0.817,0.122,0.061,0.34423986892736885

I can't blame Yolk, it makes good business sense to be insanely busy. The best they can do is run super-efficiently, and offer the best food and service they can. We showed up at 1:45 on Sunday, and it still looked like a peak crowd. They said it would be 20 minute wait if we were willing to sit at the bar. The wait ended up about 30 minutes. There's a great view of Grant Park and one of the sculpture gardens outside, with plenty of places to sit outside during the wait. Unfortunately it started raining and the temperature dropped ten degrees (ah, April in Chicago), so it was back into the crowded waiting area. Either way, bring a book and a bottle of juice. The menu is huge. I was tempted by all the Eggs Benedict variations, but miss a good crepe, so I tried one with avocado, eggs and I forget what else. I have to say it was the best breakfast crepe I've had in recent memory. The potatoes were good, and the strawberry-orange juice was fresh. Wheat pancakes with fruit were good but not exceptional. The open kitchen was loud and hectic with much shouting, so don't expect a relaxing brunch.  Prices are more reasonable than a lot of brunch hot spots, and service was good despite the crowd.

2007-03-10,4.0,"A tasty place to have a delicious brunch. I went here with friends before 9 on a Saturday morning, and were seated promptly. The menu is heavier on the ""br"" side of brunch, with a strong variety of crepes, omelettes, skillets, specialty pancakes and french toast. The lunch side brings salads, burgers, and sandwiches to the table. I had a delicious omelette, which I had with the side of fruit. It's not really a side of fruit, more like an idea of a side of fruit. (one pineapple chunk, one small cantaloupe slice, one small honey dew slice, one piece of watermelon and three slices from a small oranage). The nice surprise was being able to upgrade your side of pancakes to one of the specialty pancakes for $1.50. They have fresh squeezed juices (strawberry-orange, orange, and grapefruit). I had the orange juice which wasn't bad at all. I also enjoyed their coffee which I was able to enjoy without having to add any cream. The service was adequate, but nothing special. My coffee did not get refilled as quickly or as frequently as it could have been, considering that things weren't quite busy at the time. The room itself is nice, open and airy due to its higher ceilings. The blue and yellow motif combined with the light it gets from its eastern exposure makes it quite relaxing when the sun is out. For those people that are fans of kitchen watching, the kitchen is situated in the center, so you can watch orders go through their final preparatory stages before they are sent out. Street parking wasn't a problem today, but will likely be more of an annoyance once the weather gets consistently nicer. There was a note in the window that said that they would validate parking for $5 for up to 90 minutes, which isn't a bad deal at all for this neighborhood. If you are not a fan of having brunch around little kids or babies that emit loud screeching noises, keep in the mind that many local residents can easily walk over here with their young ones.

I ordered ""The Works"", which had everything under the sun in it.  My wifey had scrambled eggs and cream cheese.  Our dishes came with sides of pancakes, english muffins, and wheat toast.   For the price, our portions were huge (we had leftovers for later on in the day).  The pancakes, toast, and english muffin were how you would expect them.  I prefer my eggs a little solid and my omelette was a bit spongy.  Same thing with the eggs and cream cheese.  Also, the stuffed goodies in my omelette didn't jump out and assault my taste buds.  Better than IHOP, but it could be a lot better.    Oh well, it's a reason to come back and try another dish that isn't egg heavy. I had to give it four stars though since a big standout was the service.  I had 2 refills on my coffee (1st cup a little burnt, the other two was fine), the waiter was attentive, and the food came out quick even though the joint was hopping.

I was leery because of the service comments, but maybe they are working on things. I ate here twice, but relatively early both times (before 10). I came back once and there was an hour wait around noon. It's good, but not that good. The pancakes are really, really good here, they have character to them (unlike IHOP which is smooth and brown all around) you can call these are griddled fresh. I choose the apple cinnamon topping and it was not overwelming, the syrup was pretty good, but nothing special. The turkey sausage was terrible, served cold and seemed like they just took the patty out the box and nuked it. Omelette was tasteless (although I did get an egg yolk). I prefer a place that seasons their egg whites with something and Yolk simply adds the cheese and topping of your choice, meaning if you don't bite into a piece of that, there's no taste. The cinnamon bun is divine, but carb central! Waiters were on point, refilled my water and coffee continuously and didn't rush us out. It's spacious, airy and I like the fact the kitchen is open.

Lesson learned:  Don't go breaking your rules about brunch on weekends.  I have rules for reasons!  And I can't say I wasn't warned-- I read Yelpers' yelps before hitting the Red Line and wan't surprised to see the place packed to the sidewalks with cranky people waiting 30 minutes plus for fried eggs and pancakes.   Why do we do it?  Brunch is supposed to be a fun, leisurely excursion full of fat and sugar and caffeine wherein we can catch up with friends and/or family and lose track of what time it is.  Can we accomplish this when hungry people who have been waiting for an hour are standing at the edge of your table, shooting daggers with their eyes, hoping you get an emergency phone call and will have to abandon your belgian waffle untouched and relinquish your table to them?  Can we do this when the kitchen and waitstaff is so slammed that they are no longer able to distinguish between an english muffin and wheat toast (""what is it?!""  ""I don't know!"" ""Who cares?! It's bready, give it to them!"")?

YOLK: It's small and special.  Keep it that way. Yelp, help.   Yolk just may need to understand and better appreciate the value of downsizing a specialty menu. Seriously.  The menu is quite extensive and spread thin.  I could fall for the YOLK hype if their product stood up to the anticipation presented via on-line menu descriptions and on-site decor.  (SNAPS: a spacious layout, clean crisp design for a breakfast joint, though I question the bright true blue, a deeper shade could be more sophisticated if Yolk were up to par.  A ""Romper Room"" comparison was overheard while waiting to be seated.) YOLK NOTE:  This establishment may be just fine if you need a breakfast ""hot spot"" to take the visiting in-laws, you are an indiscriminate tourist or a Columbia student skipping class and blowing daddy's dough/your student loan on a conveniently-located south-loop mediocre meal.  Ouch. ""The Not-A-Secret Shoppers"" Monday, February 19.   On President's Day, my guest and I waited less than ten minutes. Excellent.  Thankfully a much shorter wait than expected based on previous YOLK reviews, and our table was close enough to the front, plenty of natural light to balance the blow-out of bright yolky-yellow interior paint.  Our server was young, cute, and seemingly slammed with tables near 12:30pm, rather frantic, but adorable and eager. She promptly served two cups of dirt-water coffee (nearly $2.50 a cup).  Sadly, we were not asked if we'd like anything else to drink; I was curious about their fresh juices as noted on the YOLK website, but upon inquiry, she commented quickly that she didn't have time to take any other order just then as another table had been waiting longer to order-in, and away she goes.   No coffee cream or milk at the table. THE DO-IT-YOURSELF DINER, part 1:  I had to get up to snag a tacky-plasticy bowl of those not-so-complementary 7-Eleven-style flavored dairy creamer packets from an empty table.  Silly stuff like this: Do it yourself. Soon enough she returned;  After placing our order: an Irish Benny and the Monte Cristo with one egg on side, our experience just became simply bizarre to a laughable yet unhumorous point.  The basic ""one egg on the side"" request seemed to have thrown things out of whack for much of the staff; they seemed fairly perplexed and had to clarify the order twice post-placement.  Grrr.  Surprisingly, the Monte Cristo came out with not one but -of course- two eggs on the side, and sadly, the benedict's eggs were poached hard, stiff yolks.  (A simple-enough cooking mistake or else it sat long enough in the kitchen window before delivery.  Whatever.)  Upon mention, the anxious server removed, in attempt to remedy, and did bring back fresh poached eggs -still gooey yolks...and wiggly wet whites.  Moist. Eeek.  No fork. THE DO-IT-YOURSELF DINER, part 2:  Up from the table again, server -busy, and who is the manager? and surely the front desk girl can help me out...Tag team = fork.  Thank you!  Way to be assertive.   Only now with prodding fork do I notice the english muffins are burnt-black and the mushy hash is just that, like dog food-slop (as mentioned in another review)/ beefy sludge slipped out of a tin can and mashed on my burnt muffins covered in runny yolk and some slimy whites with the most common hollandaise imaginable.   Come on, kitchen staff, and who let this mess leave the kitchen and hit my table?  But these accidents have to happen to someone, right?   Right?  Really?  Was this fair-quality dining experience avoidable?  Definitely. Our bill was almost $30 for this heartburn.   We truly hoped we were a rare case and,  after reviewing our check... THE DO-IT-YOURSELF DINER, part 3:  I was inclined to speak with management, providing an accurate account of our first-time observations, a rough play-by-play.  Ugh.  Rough.   No comp was given.  Mr. Manager was quick to defend Yolk and did kindly offer a $15 gift certificate, a 'nice' gesture, but my boyfriend still wants to mail it back to the corporate office.   Instead, I think I'll sell it for $10 on Craigslist.   Clearly, I will not be back to Yolk, nor can I, with any soul-searching, highly recommend Yolk.  I say, Buyer beware:  Do not venture toward the Irish Benny, and... Be wise:  Knock any high expectations down to mediocre. Tisk.  I had heard/read good enough things about Yolk to encourage me to TRY it.  If you are looking to spend money on tasty goods and a more cozy atmosphere, Bongo Room is not far.  Custom House is incredible but appropriately costly.  Gourmand may be off-beat and worth a shot.  I'm genuinely not interested in Orange.   What a shame.

2006-12-15,3.0,"Yolk is pretty good.  I would best describe it as an upscale diner.  The menu is very extensive and actually quite tasty.  There really is something for everyone here and they are happy to accomodate the customer's request.  Nothing here is absolutely amazing, but it's definitely the place to go if you like your skillets and ham and cheese omelets.  A pretty nice atmosphere overall, except the staff isn't quite up to par.  (Except Rocio and Rick... ooh lala) Overall, definitely give this place a try if you like your breakfast your way!",0.9854,0.703,0.297,0.0,0.5380952380952382

2006-12-10,4.0,"This is a place that can really cheer you up on a cold dreary morning! My friends and I walked into Yolk this morning and I loved the cozy feeling I got from the bright yellow walls! Word is out about this new south loop breakfast spot because it was  absolutely packed.  It was about a 25 minute wait, which I guess isn't too bad considering how much time I've waited at Tempo and Toast in the past. Once seated service was pretty slow, but then again they've only been around a few weeks so I'll give them some slack for another few weeks.   There are so many yummy sounding choices on the menu that I just didn't know what to get, but finally decided I was in the mood for something sweet (aren't I always?).  I had the thin crepes with fresh strawberries on top of them- very tasty, although being from Florida it's hard to consider these strawberries ""fresh"".  My friends had the veggie skillet and an omelet, which they were both more than satisfied with.  We also got a french toast for the table to share.  I only had a bite because my sweet tooth was happy enough with the crepes, but my friends gobbled it up.  The french toast was good, but I've had better at Toast. I'll definitely be back to this cheerful spot to try more things on the menu!",0.9968,0.729,0.259,0.012,0.5582336523125996

I've eaten the biscuits & gravy, potato pancakes, butcher shop omelet.  All very tasty!  Love the fresh-squeezed strawberry orange juice.  A nice alternative th 11 City Diner where the owner is so off-putting & Bongo Room where everything tastes like a dessert.",0.9227,0.776,0.224,0.0,0.55
