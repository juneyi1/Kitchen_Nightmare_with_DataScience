2017-05-25,4.0,"Well, I liked Nia. I met the owner, Nia, and she was lovely, as was her red sangria (the red sangria is better than the white, but I'm partial to red). It was seriously good sangria - one of the best I've had in the city. There was a tapas place in Wicker Park that had my favorite sangria (but it's been closed for years). The secret to this sangria was using Cabernet as the base. I was with a group of 30-40 other Chicago foodies and tried Nia's fixed price menu. I think the menu offered classic choices - like hummus and crostini as well as grilled chicken on a stick and chicken poppers (that had a spicy aftertaste). Hands down, the award for most eaten and raved about food was the bacon wrapped dates! They were so good and I think everyone had at least two. It comes with an orange dipping sauce - which you can skip. The dates are perfect on their own and pair well with red sangria! This place belongs in the West Loop with all the other fine cuisine. I would dress a little chic here - maybe dark denim and a blazer/nice top or a cute dress. It's pretty inside.",0.9954,0.738,0.254,0.009,0.5077441077441077
2017-05-24,2.0,"Came here for an event! We were told that we would have sampling of the menu. I expected to be overwhelmed with food or at least feel that I ate quite a bit at the end of the evening. The platters initially came out fairly quick but were simply a few types of bruschetta (these were my favorite), pieces of chicken/lamb (Very dry), bacon-wrapped dates (very tasty but not enough for everyone..) and chicken croquettes (bland). I'm a bit disappointed in the samplings we had and can't give a complete review of the food as I really didn't have much. I did take a glance at the menu and it carried a very nice wine list and okay menu options but the prices were a tad high. Not sure if I'd come back to eat based on what I tried though. The white peach sangria was VERY good and I would make it a point to come back for this but really, only this in particular.  The service was here and there. At times it seemed that the staff was irritated at us and there were some comments made that left a very sour taste in my mouth. Disrespecting Yelp members and foodies and speaking poorly about people that leave bad reviews is NOT good for business and I frankly, I don't understand how that topic got brought up. We all know that bad reviews are out there and after my experience I can understand why they aren't loaded with five stars. The owner decided to speak poorly about how 'bad reviews' are hurting them yet, was rude when a member asked for a regular wine glass to PROMOTE HER BUSINESS.  I understand that Nia is one of the oldest in the neighborhood and may feel that that alone will keep them relevant but based on my experience, I will not be coming back to NIa.",-0.8491,0.823,0.076,0.101,0.4827696927696927

2017-02-16,2.0,"As one of our new restaurants to try for Restaurant week, we chose Nia - another not so great choice on Randolph - in my opinion.  Food-wise, it was good, service/overall experience - it was lacking. It's a place known for tapas - having a price fixe and I think perfect for a group for happy hour or after work.  When we got there (for a 6:15 reservation on a Saturday), we were seated immediately.  A table right by the kitchen, but that was okay.  Our server came over and we explained we had never been there before and he just looked at us as if to say ""okay.""  He offered no tidbits or anything.  He came back five minutes later and asked if we were ready to order.  I said ""we decided on the left side of the menu (the first four courses), but we're having trouble on the right side.""  He said ""i'll come back.""  What I wanted him to say was ""oh, let me give you some suggestions."" Nope - he was out of there. We ended up getting the following for $33 (which is usually $35 on their current menu): Nia Salad - very good Hummus - okay.  I thought it would have tasted better. Bacon Wrapped Dates - good but not hot, so that took away from it. Patata Bravas - good Croquettes - very good Jumbo garlic shrimp - very good Lamb & Feta Meatballs - good, but I expected better given all the rave reviews Sauteed Banana- quite good The servers brought out a few courses at a time, and it was continuous for 15 minutes of them literally bringing out a course(s).  No real time to enjoy and savor anything.  And if you didn't move quick enough to get a last piece of sauce or something, the plate was gone as another server picked it up.  It was just such an unenjoyable experience of being completely rushed the entire time.  So while we might have enjoyed a course, you couldn't really enjoy it b/c you felt sooo rushed. I did get the bottomless sangria for $20 and that was a waste.  Full of ice in my glass with little sangria and while I got three refills, there were gaps in the refills and with all the ice, I felt it was a waste of money. So - would I be back?  No.  It was just such a rushed experience with not no friendly wait service.",0.9883,0.794,0.142,0.064,0.4467545719586535

2017-02-14,5.0,"I had a friend that made me realize this place is one of the longest tenured places on the now famous restaurant row in West Loop on Randolph street. I have always seen the place but never thought to come inside or check it out. Restaurant Week happened and I figured since they were serving an 8 course tapas meal for $33 there was no better deal for those couple weeks so I needed to bring my @$$ on over here with a group of friends. I reserved a nice Saturday afternoon for 5 to partake in the restaurant week festivities. I was the first to show (as always) so I waited at the bar. The owner Nia actually was near the bar area and I was able to have a nice conversation with her...very nice woman who takes pride in her restaurant. As I sat and waited, I took a look around and loved the very intimate setting with dim lights and watched everyone eating whom all had smiles on their faces. Once my group showed up we were shown to our seat. We all skimmed through the menu and voted on which meal we would take with each course. The rule was that everyone had to decide on one dish from each course offering. We were told the portions were enough to satisfy quite a bit of people. We went with the following: Nia Salad - very good Hummus - really good...best I've had outside of Palestine Bacon Wrapped Dates - good but very rich Patata Bravas - sleeper good! Gnocchi - good Atlantic Salmon - star of the show! Lamb & Feta Meatballs - delicious Tiramisu - yum! Bottomless Sangria - yeah, you know! This is basically their large menu on a regular basis, but they had a bit of a reduced rate for RW. Also, bottomless sangria was $15 per person ($20 on a reg basis) and they were nice enough to bring out pitchers of red and white sangria.

When we asked her again from 10 feet away bc this was getting ridiculous, she didn't even have an answer to give. As someone who works in customer service on the daily and as a HUMAN BEING I just don't even understand We left after and decided to eat elsewhere after this interaction. Update / in response to the manager: I obviously understand that those with reservations come first. We literally went in just needing the answer to one question: what was the wait time. It's common courtesy to acknowledge all your customers, regardless of how busy you are. It literally takes 1 second to say ""be right there"".

My friends wine was served in a glass that you might use for a small orange juice at breakfast (kid you not on this).  We asked about the glasses and our waitress, who was clearly very young, said that is what they normally use.  My friend had tried the place for dinner 2 weeks earlier, and they had proper glassware. I actually saw a proper beer glass sitting at the bar.  The food was actually very good and is worth a return trip.  Their grilled asparagus salad was very good. I would definitely order it again. Fresh and not over done like so many places do.  The diver scallops were cooked perfectly. Huge and so tasty. The white bean purée they are served with wasn't very good. Too bland, especially with the scallops. I'd suggest they rethink that. That was the only real miss food wise.  The Lamb and Feta meatballs were good and very hearty.  Lots of cheese (we love cheese) but this is very filling. I recommend you order this last if you are going to try them. They were done well. We also had the spinach rolls which were good.   The place was fairly empty at lunch.

2016-06-29,5.0,"My now husband and I recently hosted our wedding rehearsal dinner (of 35 people) in Nia's private dining room in June. We had dined at Nia's previously  so we knew how delicious the food is. We contacted Nia via email inquiring about the space, and luckily they had availability for our date. Nia (the owner herself) emailed us the menu options and bar packages right away and we worked out a contract for the evening.  Many know that planning a wedding requires flexibility on the part of the couple and on the vendors they hire- Nia was the most accommodating yet! We had a few last minute changes to guest count and they were able to update the reservation without hesitation or question.  During the night of the dinner everything was just wonderful! The private room is downstairs and there is a bar area right there, so no wait time for the drinks. The restrooms are also downstairs so the layout for a private event is perfect. The tables were set and there were cute votive candles on all of the tables- we did bring in other little decorations, but even without them, the room looked wonderful. There are speakers in the room and we had music playing for us during the time we were there.  Nia was there checking in on us frequently and serving drinks at the bar. It's always nice to see an owner so involved in their restaurant- it shows they truly care. The food is tapas style, so it came out at perfectly timed intervals and everyone loved all of it! We had 8 courses, so there's something for everyone. For future Brides and Grooms- you will not be disappointed should you host your rehearsal dinner here. Nia was a true pleasure to work with- sweet and caring- and she and her staff set the tone for a wonderful wedding weekend!",0.997,0.796,0.198,0.005,0.5995894909688013

Tbh I was a little nervous because of the mixed reviews on Yelp, but luckily had a great experience with an attentive waiter and delicious wine and small plates!  For 3 girls, we decided on 6 dishes and a bottle of Cabernet and it was the perfect amount of food. We ordered the arugula salad, wild mushrooms, citrus ceviche, grilled baby octopus, pork tenderloin, and gnocchi and it was the perfect mixture of veggies, meat, and seafood. Of these plates, I would definitely recommend the arugula salad (loved the beets), octopus (looked like it was beheaded and served on the plate - fresh!), and pork tenderloin (tasty feta and sautéed veggies). The gnocchi was good too and uniquely fried and stuffed with pumpkin, which made it a little sweeter and a good finish to the meal. The only dish I would've skipped is the ceviche, which was served with average tortilla chips and not particularly noteworthy.  Overall, great meal and intimate atmosphere to catch up with friends over a bottle of wine on a weekday night! I would recommend forgoing the 8-course tasting unless you're starving and indecisive since 6 dishes left us stuffed and allowed us to choose exactly what we wanted.

Once we were seated, we were only presented with prix fix menu and our waitress informed us that we would be required to order the 8 course family style meal.

We had two very picky eaters in our group which is why we were hesitant to do the group ordering in the first place, these two ended up not eating and they were thankfully taken off our bill.

Don't get me wrong, the staff is wonderful and the service was fantastic. The tapas were merely okay. We ended up going with the eight course shared tasting menu (family style) for $33 per person. That was quite a bit of food compared to other Restaurant Week dinners, but the order in which the food came was disappointing, as all of the seafood and meat dishes arrived at the end of the meal and were less enjoyable after we had already filled up on all the other vegetarian options. We went with the following: 1. Nia Salad 2. Chickpea Hummus 3. Saganaki 4. Spinach Cigars 5. Gnocchi 6. Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes 7. Pork Tenderloin Medallions 8. Espresso Tiramisu 9. We also got a side order of the croquettes, because they looked too good to pass up. Out of all of the dishes, the only two that stood out were the Nia Salad (really fresh and great combo of flavors with the goat cheese, dates, almonds, avocado and champagne vinaigrette) and the Chickpea Hummus (came with roasted garlic - which was heavenly - and warm pita). Other than that, most of the dishes missed the mark (lack of salt, lack of texture, and lack of overall flavor).

But not too fancy of a place that you would feel out of place wearing jeans - we did. We ordered the shared 8 course family-style tapas option at $33 per person. Seemed worth the value.

2016-01-07,1.0,"I was looking for restaurants to host a post-proposal dinner to my gf (now fiance) and her family/close friends. I was in contact with Nia the owner of the restaurant to get a quote in using their downstairs private dining area. After explaining my budget, Nia mentioned that she would work with me in allowing me to use the downstairs area with the caveat that if another party reserved the area they'd share the space. I'm from New York, so it was hard for me to paint a picture of this place, and Nia gave very comforting words that everything would be okay. She e-mailed me that night with package deals for the party. I responded with many questions but no response for 2 days. First red flag. I contacted the restaurant again, and spoke to the hostess who also participates in private dining events. She quoted different prices. Second red flag. Finally, I got in touch with Nia who assured me that everything would go perfectly fine, with a set menu and their would be plenty of food, and no extraneous charges (bartender fees etc). So, again the better half of me decided to go through with the reservation for one of the most important days of my life. My fiance loves tapas style food, and her family loves Mediterranean food, how could I go wrong?  Come the day of: After surprising my gf with a fantastic proposal in millenium park, came the second surprise of having all of her loved ones to celebrate dinner with us, only to find that everyone was misdirected to stay upstairs (not the private dining area which was promised), crunched up in the corner! I was so upset, and when I asked Nia why everyone is upstairs, she mentioned that there was an issue with the heating and could not put us downstairs, but she said no one is really here, so this is basically your space. I said ok, Why didn't you make an attempt to call me about this? only to receive a response of, oops ya we didn't contact you and theres really nothing we could do to fix the heating issue right away. There really wasn't much for me to do, since I already had my entire party waiting for us. It really felt like a bait n switch move.  Sorry, but in my opinion, this is just poor business management. No sincere apology for messing up a very important night for me and my family. They didn't even try to extend a discount for messing up on their part of the bargain. Obviously, no set communication between staff if they kept qouting different pricing. They kept switching between their large group menu vs their private dining menus. These differ in pricing by $2 per plate and extra fees.  The food was good, however I could not really enjoy it because I was so upset of the way they treated us by shoving us in a corner with no real apology. So my recommendation is if you are planning a party with Nia's consider other venues, they clearly do not know how to communicate amongst their staff and if something were to happen within their restaurant, you're basically stuck with no options. This place may be appropriate for a sit in dining experience by yourself or another friend but I'll never know because I will not go back to this place again!",0.994,0.772,0.153,0.075,0.47087662337662345

Risotto - flavor great and texture of mushrooms was fantastic. Alas the texture of the risotto was a bit off and had more of a rice feel..temperature was perfect (steaming).  Cheese plate was a ice selection of the norm (Manchego and chèvre) and a new one for me Kefalograviera?? Paired with warm brad and honey it was a perfect small plate to sate the rumbling belly.  A very nice selection of whiskey (including bourbon and scotch). and the bartender (Gaga) was kind enough to provide a Basil Haden on the rocks.  And here is where we can differentiate. she poured the whiskey neat to start to show the dram was of the proper volume and finished with the ice.  My lovely bride ordered a Bird Watcher and enjoyed the botanical nature and general flavor.

Also happy with this. 5 - Eggplant - Husband loved this. So did I, but I was getting so full already.   6 - Salmon - Not the best Salmon. (The only item we weren't fans of) 7 - Lamb and Feta Meatballs - Very interesting and good! 8 - Chocolate Mousse - Perfect light dessert... I was stuffed so this was just right for me.

2015-07-03,1.0,"If I could give Nia no stars, I willingly would.  This was the worst experience I've ever had at any restaurant. It started with my friend giving me a coupon for 20% off of my meal, which had been attached to her receipt.  It said it could not be coupled with other sales.  It was restaurant week and I wasn't sure if that counted as an additional sale (my first restaurant week experience!!) so I called Nia and asked if I could use the coupon WITH the restaurant week menu.  The man I spoke to on the phone said that I could.  I decided to confirm: ""So, I can apply a discount to the restaurant week special?"".  Yes, he said, I could. We arrived at Nia on time for our reservations, were seated quickly, and ordered our food and wine flights.  The waitress brought all three of our wines at the same time, which was a bit confusing since she did not tell us which was which and since we subsequently had a small table filled up with wine glasses.  The food came out.  Since it was restaurant week, we ordered the eight course meal special.   Four courses came out at the same time!!  I enjoyed the Nia salad; but it was difficult to eat a salad while at the same time we had mushrooms (excessively oily), saganaki (cold and inexplicably soggy), and bacon wrapped dates also on our table, getting cold as we tried to eat everything at once. The next four courses took almost two hours to come out.  We had the croquettes, which were dry, two tiny but good tasting diver scallops, and dry pork medallions with wet, gross potatoes.  Some of the food was good, but some of it was inedible. And in the meantime, we were sitting at our table with no food for periods of 20 minutes between courses. We finally asked for the check.  Getting our waitresses attention was difficult because she was sitting at the bar drinking with other customers, who I'm guessing were her friends.  Once she came over, it still took her 45 minutes to actually bring us the check (I timed this.  She disappeared.).  I had given her the coupon and when she brought out our check, it turned out she had charged us for each plate individually instead of the restaurant week special.  ""Excuse me,"" i said.  ""I think you made a mistake in our check and didn't charge us for restaurant week, this is a lot of money.""  The waitress literally scoffed at me and told me I couldn't use the coupon and the restaurant week special.  Having called to ask about this, I explained that when I had to an employee of Nia, he'd told me I could.  The waitress went to get her manager. I have worked in restaurants for eight years.  I have bussed, cleaned, waited tables, hostessed, and bartended. As a result, I'm pretty patient with mistakes in a restaurant.  However, what followed next was the most ridiculous treatment I've experienced by any restaurant.  The manager came over and when I explained our situation and my confusion to her, rather than attempting to work out a comprise, she yelled at and berated us.  When I told her that I had spoken to someone on the phone earlier about the coupon/ restaurant week combo, she went ""You are obviously lying.  You have no proof."" She continued to insult and mock my boyfriend and I, informing us that we were WRONG in a variety of colorfully rude ways, as we attempted to figure out some way to fix our situation, for almost twenty minutes.  It seems pretty clear that this manager is incapable of understanding the concept of customer service, given her responses to other peoples' negative reviews (she actually called someone pathetic!!  Really??) and her insane treatment of us.  We finally gave up, paid an exorbitant amount for terrible food and service, and left.   I almost feel bad for Nia.  Given the terrible food and service, and the surrounding amazing restaurants, I hope they don't last much longer.",-0.9921,0.809,0.068,0.122,0.5689452124935996

The food was mediocre, not poor tasting, but definitely not amazing, by any means. We also ordered a few house cocktails/wine.  Usually, when you come to restaurants that offer small plates, and house cocktails, it is obvious your patrons will take their time to sip their drinks and munch on the food. Maybe I was wrong, because we are constantly pressured to order more, and order dessert, and order more drinks. The three of us definitely ordered a good amount of food and drinks that I don't think it was necessary to be constantly pestered to order more. Right after we paid our bill, we were getting ready to leave, and the lights suddenly turned off, and then turned back on. There was a couple sitting at the bar with drinks, and our waitress at the bar. The three laughed and said, ""oh, he accidently turned off all the lights,"" meaning the busboy. I looked at my watch and it was 10:05pm. I understand your restaurant closes at 10pm, but was it necessary to perform such a petty act to kick your customers out? A courteous notification was sufficient. I've worked in restaurants before, so I  understand having to wait for the last table to leave is a drag, but 5 minutes past closing time? Also, for customers that didn't even leave you a poor tip nor did they just sit there and didn't order food, your customer service should be followed through until the customer leaves the business, regardless. I question how this restaurant has sustained any customers!

2015-02-20,2.0,"Well, it looks like a lot of people were displeased by their Nia Restaurant Week experience. Similarly, after giving much thought to which restaurant I wanted to try and researching all the menus, I was so disappointed with choosing Nia for Chicago RW. The space is small and we felt like cattle getting herded around as we waiting for our table to clear. Also, the dishes all came out really randomly and without much thought. Service felt rushed, but it was a Friday night during RW so I can forgive them. THE BIGGEST LETDOWN: Our table of 3 had to select one dish for each course of Nia's 8 course Restaurant Week Menu, which I've never seen at Restaurant Week and I can tell this came as a shock to many other people. In the end, this makes sense because it was a lot of food, but false advertising (also the server's snappy attitude explaining this) can put diners in a sour mood. Also, if my other roommate had come (who is a vegetarian), that would've put everyone in a bit of a pickle. ALSO, the free sangria check in didn't work for Restaurant Week. Okay, fine, we still ordered sangria anyways and it wasn't anything special. What we ordered: Nia Salad - Nothing worth mentioning Assorted Cheeses + Assorted Meats - Um please, can you give more than 3 slices of prosciutto and less of the bologna type meat.. sorry I just felt that I could have prepared a more exciting meat&cheese board Menu online said there shouldve been spinach cigars, but apparently they were out :( Wild Mushrooms - The star of the night! The exotic blend of these mushrooms were packed with a punch and I wish i had just ordered a bowl of these instead. This dish had some hope for redemption to the night, but... Ceviche - Everyone else's came in a nice martini glass, but ours was presented like soup in a bowl. I personally felt like their ceviche was too soupy/bland and lacked acidity.  Chicken Manchego Croquettes - The chicken was kind of a weird flavor, but thankfully the tomato sauce just masked any unsavory tastes Lamb and Feta meatballs - Good, not great Baklava - Again, good, not great I sound extremely whiney from all these descriptions, I know haha but this just wasn't what I expected for my first ever Chicago Restaurant Week experience.

Wild Mushrooms: Easily my favorite dish as the truffle oil really made those mushrooms pop. Crisp Potatoes: Well cooked (and large portion of) spicy/tomato-ey potato squares.  Orzo Salad: Cucumber, olive, tomato, orzo, feta, red onion. The onion was a bit heavy and overpowering, but the rest was well blended. Saganaki: Slightly disappointing, as I'm used to saganaki being lit on fire at one's table. This came out pre-done, and also no longer hot and melty. More warm and slightly rubberized. My friend liked it, though. Baked Goat Cheese: Delicious! Would've liked there to be more goat cheese (there was a lot of creamy tomato sauce) but otherwise great. The seasoned bread was delightful, too. Pumpkin Gnnochi: Sweet and delicate, topped with little bits of hazelnut or praline or something?  A nice balance to all the savory options we'd been having.

Third course - Bacon Wrapped Date.  Came out the same time as the Nia Salad and Sanagaki. Not sure should I eat the cold salad or the warm Sanagaki or hot Bacon Wrapped Date first?? Tough decision.  Most restaurants will ""allow"" their customers to finish their cold salad first before serving other hot and greasy dishes. Fourth course - Wild Mushroom with truffle oil. Mushroom were thinly sliced, needed to use the spoon to pick it up from the dish.  Not sure what type of mushroom I was eating for they're all thinly sliced. For all I know they might be all button mushrooms.  They must forgot the truffle oil and use regular oil instead. Fifth course - Pumpkin Gnocchi. Want to order the Croquettes and was told they were out at 6:30 pm on a Saturday night.  Must be a busy night since the restaurant was almost half full.  There were about 12  Pumpkin  Gnocchi on the dish.  So it's a dollar a Gnocchi.  Pumpkin must be expensive this time of the year.  Definitely not worth a dollar each. Sixth course - Ceviche. The Nova Scotian caviar must all dissolved in the sauce or my glasses, didn't see or taste any in the dish. We each had 3 spoons and the taste was bland. Seventh course - Strip Steak.  Three pieces of playing card size chewy meat and unsalted fries slapped on the plate.  Portion size of the fries was less than a small fries from any fast food restaurant. The steak looked like it was cooked in the oven and not seared.   Eighth course - Sauteed Banana. One banana and one scoop of ice cream for 3 people.  The banana was just peeled and then placed on the plate with drizzle of caramel.  The kitchen must forgot this suppose to be ""sauteed banana"" not a peeled banana on a plate. Wonder if for a party of two they get half a banana and half  scope of ice cream? When we received the check, no mentioned 20% tips was added to the total.  When I questioned the waiter he claimed the owner said because of restaurant week they tag every table, I asked where it stated on the menu or the web site said 20% tips is mandatory.  He became very defensive. They tag 20% after tax which is equivalent to 22% before tax.  Their service did not deserved more than 15%.  I checked their Restaurant Week menu on the web again and it states ""gratuity added to parties over 6"", not sure when a party of ""3"" become ""6"" in our case??  I felt the restaurant tried to take advantage of us and treated us like some uniformed customers randomly added 20% tips on the check.  Not sure I can trust the quality and portion size they served us tonight was their standard. We felt the restaurant treated our party as a one time customer and tried to squeeze as much as possible from us. There are many other restaurants in the neighboring area that value and want our business more than this restaurant. Overall, rush service (in and out in less than an hour and that's not our choice), poor management, mediocre food at best.  Wonder why there was no wait on a nice Saturday night at 7:30 pm.   We been to The Capital Grill, Bistro Bordeaux (same price) and Japonais by Morimoto during the Restaurant Week and Nia is the most disappointing experience.",0.9974,0.837,0.135,0.028,0.49104471916971926
2015-02-07,1.0,"I came here for Restaurant week with my parents and oh boy do I have things to say.  This was my first time coming here so I didn't know what to expect, but I feel that if I know what I know now, I would have gone somewhere else without regret.   It is easier if I simply just divide this review into paragraphs then just go all steam ahead. First impressions: The restaurant is set up with the top floor and the basement.  The top floor wasn't filled p yet but we were sent downstairs.  Justify it however you want (top floor is meant for people who can't go down stairs or it's meant for intimate dinners) but I just felt after going down the stairs, past the restroom, past the coat racks that the first thought was ""this is where they put the people they don't want the outside to see"" The menu: For dinner it is $33 per a guest and it says one choice per a course full table participation.  We were under the impression that meant each person would get a choice of one dish so 3 people 8 courses 24 dishes all together.  If you look online the lunch menu states clearly it is one choice per a table......So is it that hard to copy and paste the same words for dinner and saving the awkward embarrassing moment we had?  And sure they said that they would give us portions for 3 people so no worries, but we didn't know the baseline for how large a single portion was so we didn't know what to expect.  We got ripped off in my opinion. We did the math. 8 small plates $12 a person and the portions was about 1 tablespoon per a person.   The food: We ordered 2 Sangria and it was a whole cup of ice with maybe 3-4 shots worth of the wine.  We got the Nia Salad and that was bland, I barely tasted any vinaigrette and the portion was about personal size.  Even though we were not in any major rush, it was basically 3 dishes 20 minutes of waiting 3 dishes another 10 minutes of waiting 1 dish another 5 minutes then the last.  The timing was way off.  We also got the Saganaki and I don't know if you know how it traditionally is supposed to be, but a Saganaki is supposed to be sizzling on a hot plate when it comes out. It was rubbery and luke warm, chances were it was made and left standing for 10 minutes.  We also got the strip steak and that was disappointing as well and not just because it was under seasoned.  3 pieces of steak for 3 people the size of your average coffee table coaster as thick as a piece of card board and a side of fries that are no bigger than an order of small fries from McDonalds.  What finally did it for me was the sauteed bananas.  If you ever had tapas and the sauteed bananas for desert the real way they do it is fry the banana to crisp it, slice it up drizzle caramel and nuts on top with ice cream on the side. Nia's version was a joke.  It was a whole banana that they put in a pan to heat it up (the inside was still cold), pour caramel on top and serve as is with a small scoop of ice cream and I emphasize small.  The problem is that if you are still hungry you have to order off the regular menu and I can only imagine how much that could cost.       The Check: On the menu it states clearly gratuity added to parties of 6 and yet we had gratuity added automatically.  3 DOES NOT EQUAL 6.  What made it worst was that it was a 20% gratuity and usually it is based off of the price before taxes, but this one included tax.  So if you do the math $99 dollars plus $16 dollars for drinks then you add the tax with 20% we got a check for roughly $150.  We made a deal about it to the server and he stumbled out an excuse about how it is the policy of the owner during Restaurant Week.  Which basically to me made it sound like ""come to our restaurant for restaurant week for a great deal, but you are still going to pay out the ear at the end."" In short, I am not going back and I recommend people to save their money and find somewhere else.  Restaurant Week is a program sponsored by ChooseChicago as a way to promote tourism in Chicago.....This place does not promote such a feeling and with the food scene in Chicago there are far more desirable/affordable places to go.",0.9854,0.863,0.091,0.046,0.449516765285996

2015-01-31,3.0,"Nia was my first try for Chicago Restaurant Week 2015.. To be frank Im a little disappointed with the food. I was expecting more from this restaurant especially after seeing their pricey menu.. To start with the good things, the service was good and the ambience was fine.(nothing extra ordinary) I ordered the 6 course menu; with all of them keeping an ok standard; nothing extra to pull me there a second time.. Nia Salad: **** Good salad to start with, especially with the dates in between. Spinach Rolls:**** I liked the taste, but not up to some of the other spinach rolls I had in Chicago. And I was really disappointed to see that they served only 2 small spinach rolls for a shared plate of dish for 2 persons!! Pumpkin Gnocchi: *** Saw many rave reviews in yelp about this dish and thats why i went to this restaurant. but Gnocchi was a disappointment. With its sweet cheesy taste, it was just an ok dish.  Crisp Calamari: *** Calamari inside felt like rubber!! but at least the batter was good. Again, there are much better Calamari available around for way lower price! Lamb & Feta Meatballs: *** Another dish which had high reviews. but I felt it like an ok dish!! felt like too cheesy and less flavor. Espresso Tiramisu: *** Sweet and creamy as expected but watery at the bottom which ruined the taste! When you are in Randolph street with top guns like Little Goat, Au Cheval, Publican, Avec etc in the neighborhood, I am expecting way more for that price range! So overall this one fell short on my expectations. But decent food and good service.",0.9872,0.773,0.172,0.054,0.5115891472868217
2015-01-31,2.0,"If I told you that the Nia Salad was the best thing on an 8 course restaurant week menu, how would you rate it?  Came here with a few friends on a weekend night for restaurant week. The menu displayed a wide array of selections for 8 courses. However, Nia deployed car salesman-like method ""Bait and Switch.""  All party members had to participate in the prix fixe (as advertised) and all courses were the same for all party members (not advertised). Therefore, we received huge portions of each course and each pay the full $33 amount sans tip+tax.  However, you aren't here to hear me whine and moan. So here is the breakdown of the good: Nia Salad was a great mix between acidity and sweetness, along with the Saganaki which really help start up the mood. The bad: Patatas Bravas were soggy and lacked flavor, Diver Scallops were undercooked and close to slime in the middle, and Pork tenderloin with lean consistency and battery-acid like taste.  Lastly, I thought the Creme Brulee would have been the real redeemer of the night. However, it took 20 minutes to prepare and came out like pudding; top was barely charred with a torch and ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.

My favorites were the ceviche and pork loin chops.  We also ordered octopus, nia salad, and mushroom risotto.  The pork was very tender and the sauce went well with the dish.   If I were to go back, however, I would get the prix fixe menu as it seems to be a much better deal than ordering dishes individually.

Moving on from that, we ordered the following: 2 glass of wine $13/glass.  House wine.  Nice but overpriced. Grilled octopus.  Good, not tough, overpriced for the serving size. Lamb and feta meatballs.  Better, sauce was good.  Again, overpriced.  At $13 and 4 meatballs/order, that's $3.25/meatball.  And it's not like these were large meatballs. Orzo salad.  Probably the worst orzo we've had.  Ever.  While the olives added some saltiness, it was heavily under-seasoned.   Wild mushroom risotto: Excellent.  Would definitely recommend. Pork medallions: Just ok, also under-seasoned.   Beef brochette: Good. Seasoned adequately. Bread pudding: probably the best item we had all night.

2014-09-05,2.0,"I dined here with my daughter who has been in the restaurant biz for over 10 years. We were seated right away and were provided with menus. After a few minutes the server, who did not introduce himself, asked us if it was our first time there (which it was), and said he'd be back in a few minutes. Don't they usually ask if they can start you off with something to drink?  Well, when he returned, we placed our drink order, as well as the food order (6 small plates). After what was more than several minutes, he returned with our drink order (2 glasses of wine). Shortly after that the first 3 of the 6 plates were brought to our table. When we were nearly finished with those, he came by to ask if we wanted another glass of wine, which we did. When those showed up, the original 3 plates were finished and he asked if we wanted to see the dessert menu. I informed him that we still had 3 more food items coming. He had a surprised look on his face and went to the computer to check on it.  A minute later he stopped to tell us the other 3 plates ""will be out right away."" Well, they were not, so I got up from the table to ask the hostess/bartender if they were having a serving issue (like maybe someone didn't show up leaving them short-staffed) and she said no, what's the matter. When I told her about the long wait, she said he had placed the remaining 3 plates on hold and had forgotten to release them. So when he told us they would be right out, he already KNEW there was no way that was going to happen. Hey, if you messed up, just take the hit. I value honesty, and this guy was not honest with us.  It took quite a bit of time to get those last items, and had I not been so hungry I would have just canceled the rest of the order. Finally when he did bring it out, he said ""Dessert is on me."" Well, we didn't want dessert and when the check came, NOTHING was comped! My daughter was very surprised they had not bothered to comp even the cheapest item - $7. Normally I am a 20%+ tipper, but when I told my daughter I was only going to tip 15%, she said that was too much. And this from a girl who usually tips more than I do! Oh, one more thing - total time spent for 2 glasses of wine and 6 small plates was about 2-1/2 hours. Ahh, I don't want to forget the food. Actually, EVERYTHING we had was VERY good.

We sat at the bar and the bartender/waitress (she seemed to be the only one working) was really nice and immediately gave us menus. I opted for the cocktail made with fig vodka, soda and orange, since I have never heard of fig vodka. It was pretty tasty and I am curious what other drinks could be made with it. The vodka flavor overpowered the soda & orange a bit and wasn't exactly balanced, but it was still pretty good. Drinks are small for the price, so it's not the type of place where I would plan to have too many. My friend ordered a cocktail with whiskey and bitters (I can't remember what it was). He said there was too much whiskey and again, the flavors weren't really balanced. In fact, he didn't even drink the entire thing, which is really unusual. Our bill for two small cocktails was $22. Halfway through our drinks, a couple came in and sat at the bar. After looking over the wine choices, they made some selections and were told twice  that they didn't have that wine right now, and their third selection wasn't chilled, so she suggested they order something else.

We had about 13 people in our group to celebrate a joint birthday, and as expected, we ordered a couple bottles of wine and some cocktails...even with all that, our bill total was outrageous and they refused to accept more than 3 credit cards...why the heck not?! 3 credit cards for a party of 13?! In this day and age, how is it that restaurants can't (or aren't willing to) process multiple cc's for a table? Just makes no sense at all. Especially considering that the price per person ended up being so much more than $33 (with drinks, tax and tip)...people don't typically carry that much cash on hand!

I was going to start flipping tables over and get ghetto!  Like REAL ghetto. Strike 1:  The menu...it stated verbatim, ""Select one choice per course"" $22 per person.  Evidently that meant for the entire table.  Are you kidding me!  How does that mean for the ENTIRE TABLE!  I could kind of understand if it was for two people. Strike 2: Prior to coming here, I read the little check-in thing stating that you get one free glass of Sangria.  It states, ""$28 (prior to 6pm) Full Table Participation Required.""  Our waiter said it was for the dinner portion. -_-;  It was 3:34 PM, and lunch isn't $28, it is $22.  Dinner is $33 and there is a separate statement for it. W-H-A-T-E-V-E-R!   Environment: It is a pretty small jam-packed place.  The tables are all close to everyone, which leaves no room for private conversations.  However, my friends and I were so immersed with what we were discussing, we didn't care.  Were we the loud, obnoxious ones? Employees:  BIG FAT ZERO!  Are you not enjoying your job?  I bet if we weren't pro-active about asking for new plates before the dessert was served, he would not have done it.  Trash-ity, trash, trash!  And considering everything in the synopsis portion, forget it. Food: Nia Salad:  Well put together, and refreshing to eat.  It abated my anger..just..a tad.  5/5 Egg Plant Involtini:  What a waste of calories.  Tasted like air.  Are there ingredients missing?  1/5 Pumpkin Gnocchi: This was a favorite by two of my friends.  It tasted like mini pancakes but with significantly less sugar.  Mmmm.... But something about it was missing...perhaps it was the sugar.  The oil and flavors on it, were just hints and as a result, nothing really BURSTED out.  3/5 Crab Cakes: Something was missing in these crab cakes too.  I cannot place my finger on it, but my friend said sauce.  Yes, sauce.  They only provided a drizzle.  Oh well...3/5 Lamb and Feta Meatballs:  The sauce was instantly notable.  Not only the sauce's orangey color, but the magnificent taste of pomodoro.  Yum.  We all licked our plates and prayed for more.  Although it was delicious, something was still missing as well. A hotness?  It needed something sharp... 4/5 Sautéed Banana: Very simple and delicious.  The caramel was not over-powering, and the pecans complemented the flavors.  Put a little of that gelato on top and woot, woot!  mouth-gasm.  Um..is there more? 5/5 Drinks: Because I was feeling like shit, I got a celebrity Meltdown, because it felt like a meltdown. No free sangria, meltdown..whole table thing..meltdown.  God, four more months in this city....echoed in my mind.   The drink was superb and refreshing, although very small.  I would come here just for pre-drinks...on an empty stomach so I can get to the tipsy point. Cost: 40 bucks per person, including tip and tax.  When considering the experience, it didn't seem worth it.

2014-01-26,1.0,"We chose Nia for restaurant week last night and had by far the worst dining experience any of us have ever has. To start, we ordered our first five courses and anxiously awaited for our food. An hour and a half later and we still had no food. We complained to the waiter, and they quickly brought out our meat plate (that was the third course). Twenty minutes later, the second course comes out. All the while we are wondering where the first course, a salad, can possibly be. All it takes is someone to throw a few ingridients in a bowl and send it out...I can't fathom how this cannot be done within the first two hours of patrons being there.  The night gets even better. Along comes course four....ICE COLD Brussels sprouts. One of the waitresses refuses to do anything since we ""ate them"" already, even though they all sat on our plates rather than the serving dish. This was the icing on the cake, and we went to complain to the owner. She came to our table and defended the restaurant, stating that dishes come out in random order and it's a busy Saturday night. Again, I have never seen a place take two plus hours to throw salad ingredients in a bowl. And later on in this terrible dining experience, the waiter brought out an ""extra"" salad because the kitchen had too much. Huh?  Now we move onto course six, the seafood course. They had brought one slice of salmon for eight ppl, and four scallops. The serving sizes were a joke. To top off this atrocious experience, I ordered a cappuccino for a post-meal drink. This ""cappuccino"" was a watery coffee flavored broth with a mound of foam and cinnamon (yes, the barista must be blind and mistaken cinnamon for chocolate.)  Long story short, the kitchen fucked up that night. BAD. They were incredibly underprepared and overwhelmed. They ended up comping two bottles of wine for us, but the owner never apologized and owned up to her mistakes. What ever happened to the customer is always right?

Three of us decided on Nia's after looking at other options on randolph, not having heard of it (2 visitors and Im new in town) but liked that it felt authentic and not gimmicky. 8 courses for three of us Nia Salad - i dare say best ive ever had, it was suberb, no dry spots but not over dressed, abundant 'goodies', just ridiculous. Cheese and Meat Plates (2 courses)- manchego and cheve with honey, enough said (the olive cheese was fine, not my fav). Meat came with this sweet olive salad (raisins?) just outstanding, the meats were great, simple like the cheeses. Gnocchi- dropped while we still had cheese and meat, however this was somehow the perfect timing, possibly because THIS WAS THE BEST THING I HAVE PUT IN MY MOUTH. Two of us had near religious moments, I am not exaggerating.  I dont even know what was inside, potato/squash ginger/allspice all possible it was SUBLIME-  topped with browned butter and hazelnuts. Seriously, crying was the only appropriate response. Ceviche- I didnt want to ruin my trancendence but there are fleeting moments that just need to be that.  Ceviche was delicious, lots of different fish with the tomato lemon lime and assuming just salt. All tasty with tortillas that were neither too puffy nor too brittle or sharp. Lamb chops and sauteéd mushrooms (2 courses)- these came out together which was logical (mush are course 4 on menu, so unexpected). The lamb was soft and fatty, equisite.  Mushrooms (maitake, shitake, crimini?) were plain, but cooked perfectly not mushy or rubbery at all.  Their simplicity and the richness of the lamb (w fingerlings) was perfect. Desserts - bread pudding and we added a tiramisu Bread pudding was light and simple as was the tiramisu, i didnt like these because they were not 'rich' enough.  My friend started pointing out the subtle flavor of amaretto in the tiramisu and I got what was going on. The desserts dont put you over the edge, they are a simple statement at the end of the incredible story that is eating at Nia.

It was an 8 course meal and I wish I could have snapped a picture of all of them but the group I went with was very hungry haha.  First Course: Nia Salad which was mixed greens with generous helpings of goat cheese, spiced almonds and champagne vinaigrette. It was a very light salad and the acidity of the vinaigrette helped cleanse the palate for the heavier dishes to come.  Second Course: Bacon Wrapped Dates: These were better than the ones that we had at Tapas Valencia because the bacon was actually salty to contrast the dates themselves.  Third Course: Saganaki: I had never had this before but it is brandy flambé sheep's milk cheese that you spread over french bread. It was really good but very unexpected because the cheese wasn't melted but was still gooey on the inside.  Fourth Course: Spinach Cigars: These were amazing! Served with a dill and cucumber yogurt sauce, spinach was rolled between sheets of phyllo dough. Super crispy and flavorful, but I preferred it without the yogurt sauce.  Fifth Course: Chickpea Hummus. Your usual hummus.  Sixth Course: Citrus Ceviche and Atlantic Salmon :) The Ceviche was great but the salmon just melted in your mouth!  Seventh Course: Lamb and feta meatballs. AMAZING! Probably the best thing we had for the entire meal because they were super juicy and flavorful!

2013-05-16,2.0,"Came here on a groupon and walked in early enough to grab the free cheese plate, which was interesting, but did not seem worth the price if we had paid for it. Some bread, some cheese, and honey for $15, I think it was?! Maybe it was some extremely fancy cheese that my palate was too pedestrian to appreciate, but thankfully it was free or I would have been grumbling. We then shared the octopus, goat cheese, and sausage. We tried ordering other things, but they were out of them at the time- disappointing. The portions were quite large of these items, but almost too much so. The octopus was excessive and grainy so we didn't want to finish the whole thing. The sausage was extremely spicy, which I liked, so it was up to me to tackle it but it was a log of a sausage and that's not necessarily an appetizing dinner item by itself. We liked the goat cheese the best, but I have to say that it's hard to go wrong with baking up some goat cheese in tomato sauce and putting it on toasted bread.  Really this was nothing special and the prices were very high.

(the portions are large).  So there is a set menu to choose from.  Makes it a bit difficult if you have a picky eater with you.  The night changed considerably when a bachelorette party came downstairs with 4 bottles of wine and again gave me the vibe that I was drinking where I shouldn't be.  It got so loud down there, we had to ask to move upstairs.  They were kind and accommodating, and once upstairs we could decide to enjoy our food as opposed to losing our voices from yelling in the ear of the person next to us.  So, on to the food.  Favorite hands down was the pumpkin gnocchi.  WOW. Had the Nia salad and the arugula goat cheese salads to start because we had such a huge party.  Nia was much better.  then on to the meats and cheeses which were just ok. Spinach cigars: YUM.

Complaint 2: I want a glass of wine - don't try so hard to upsell me a bottle, especially if I just told you ""No thank you, all I want is a glass"". Complaint 3: The check states ""5% discount on cash payments"".  They would not honor it. Why?  Oh.... because I presented a Groupon. I spoke with a manager, and she told me the Groupon states no other offers honored.  There is nothing on the Groupon that states this, and there is nothing about not honoring OpenTable points.  And if the 5% discount is not honored, then don't print the offer on my check, and tell the waitress not to treat me like crap because I asked for the discount.

Unfortunately, the food was less than great. We ordered the Nia salad, brussels spouts, gnocchi, sausage and tiramisu. The salad and tiramisu were pretty tasty. The rest...not so much. The brussels spouts and gnocchi were greasy and oddly sweet. I don't know what they did to the sprouts, but the gnocchi-supposedly served in browned butter- had brown sugar on it. The homemade sausages were equally greasy and served with 'garlic confit' which turned out to be roasted garlic swimming in oil. The sausages were spicy in the regard that they had heat. Sadly, there was no flavor.  Given the knowledge that the food was greasy and lacking taste, I still decided to order the crispy calamari. What can I say? I was hungry. What arrived was decidedly not crispy-greasy-and served with what tasted like bottled hot sauce and sweet ketchup. Disgusting.

We had the 8-course dinner option. Everything was absolutely delicious. While I was under the impression that Nia focused more on tapas, quite a few dishes were larger than tapas size. That's fine, as it is something to note if I ever return. What I will note is that at authentic tapas restaurants, hot plates do not come to the table no sooner than the order is placed. That's expected at restaurants with American fare per Chili's, TGIFridays, etc. Aside from that, the food was tasty in the tempered-spiced manner that West Loop establishments provide.

The food is OKAY, I think you will get significantly more tapas bang-for-your-buck by going to other Chicago Tapas style restaurants. My main gripe with Nia is the HORRENDOUS service by their waitstaff and the lack of any concern for their customers. We approached Nia this evening with our dog (note, Nia says they are ""dog friendly""), and our wheaten was VICIOUSLY attacked by another dog who was not on leash. One member of the party with this particular dog was moderately concerned about the incident, however most of the others (who knew the owners) carried on loudly and drunkenly telling us to ""get a life."" It is pathetic to me that no one showed any concern for the situation, is it so bad at Nia that they just don't care what happens to their customers/potential customers? The owner did not come out to address us, and most of the party drunkenly carried on with their dog STILL unleashed.  There are about 20 other places i would rather go than Nia on Randolph and near the surrounding area some of whom show genuine concern for their customers, and also their canine friends.

2012-07-27,2.0,"It's unfortunate when you set expectations for a flawless evening only to be met with disappointment as soon as it begins. I wanted to LOVE Nia because it consists of things I adore about summertime Chicago: Tapas, outdoor patios, and a short walk from my home. What's usually a recipe for success ended in a more simple equation: decent food + mediocre service = ME NO LIKEY!     First off, I find it extremely odd when restaurants on major streets in neighborhoods filled with ""foodies"" like myself, are empty. It's a Saturday night in the West Loop and our group of 11 were the only patrons aside from two small tables at 8:00pm. Did we miss the memo that this place sucks? Oh well...let's try and make the best of it. As we trickle in, we are informed of the $33 prix fixe menu...oh and by the way, it's mandatory for parties of 6 or more. Yet another memo that would have been a ""nice to know"" before making our reservations. Primary reason being our group is a culmination of ""meat and potatoes"" eaters that don't like venturing too far outside the box, allergies that seem to grace the ingredients of almost every dish on the prix fix menu, and food snobs who expect greatness. I know what you're thinking: tough crowd. However, It just would have been great to know in advance so everyone could expect not to order what they actually wanted to eat. EPIC FAIL.      The few dishes we actually ordered were quite tasty in my opinion. I enjoyed the ceviche, saganaki (cheesy goodness), lamb and feta meatballs, and the creme brule. All the other dishes we selected were pretty average. The food however, was truly overshadowed by the sub par service.      Apparently the waiter was the bartender, hostess, manager, cook and whatever other employee is necessary for a restaurant to actually function. This may have attributed to his lack of attention to detail. Service was slow and we told him in advance of all allergies, which he apparently forgot to share with the chef. Awesome. I am allergic to avocado, so I had to skip over those dishes (luckily I was paying attention because he plopped the salad mounted with avo in my face - Otherwise, I would have been taking a trip to Northwestern Memorial that night.) Hey buddy! Server 101: explain to your table what dishes you are placing on the table, particularly the ones that could kill them! The straw that really broke the camel's back occurred during dessert when all the items came adorned with strawberries. Pretty sure we said strawberries on the side, only this time it's on everything and again, someone is ALLERGIC DUMBASS! We quickly pointed out this mistake and there was no apology, only a half ass reply "" eat the creme brule - no strawberries on that"". Are you serious? We ask for a manager, he says there isn't one there. Riiiiight. Cut the check jerk off, it's time we leave. If gratuity wasn't already on the check I'd leave you a TIP alright: FIND A NEW JOB.     Decent food, ridiculous service. I already have my list of Tapas favs and Nia is certainly not one of them. The way restaurants come and go in Chicago, you would think Nia would be attentive to key areas such as service/dining experience. Clearly not. Since that's the case, I look forward to the new restaurant that takes Nia's place summer 2013 because they are down the path of failure very soon.",0.7346,0.783,0.107,0.11,0.5536584330701978

Since it was my first time at Nia's, I didn't know what to try. The waiter suggested the eggplant involtini, topped with fresh ricotta and tomatoes, an amazingly irresistible garden freshness to die for! I would recommend their vegetarian bean dish for vegans; it was filling and an excellent add-on with the Nia salad. The salad had the right serving of dressing, complimenting the supply of avocado, piquillo peppers, goat cheese and dates. For dessert, I tried the classic bread pudding with vanilla & caramel, which was a delicious, mouth watering treat!  This is one of my top five picks for a night out on the town with Mr/Mrs. Right.

Maybe so cuz when it's nice outside and they're stuck working, they must be somewhat irritated.  The service was horrible..we got there and the host walked right past us without greeting us or saying anything. The busboy directed us to our table. It took our waitress/host a while before giving us menus (over 15 minutes). We asked a few questions about the menu and our waitress spoke to us with a bad attitude in return...I mean come on lady...we just want to know a few things before ordering please.  Each plate we ordered was bad in exception of the dates. The octopus tasted like it had been defrosted and grilled with sauce to mask it, the rabbit tasted like bad chicken covered in honey mustard sauce and onions, and the gnocchi had no flavor! The portions were super small. We've been to a fair share of tapas restaurants and this was one of the worse in regards to portion sizes. I was surprised at how other diners were sitting along side of us tolerating the horrible food...lol maybe they were thinking the same thing. Not once did our waitress ask how we were doing. She never came to our table or acknowledged us so I didn't know how else to get her attention when we were ready for our check. And then it took her at least another 15 mins before she prints out our check (she was standing around just chatting with I'm assuming a regular customer or friend because she seemed so casual with him...and we know this because we were seated right next to the bar where she was not doing her job).  Oh and then we hear screaming coming from the back..it was a lady and we couldn't understand what she was screaming about. She walks out of the bathroom, and on her way out of the restaurant, she yells to random people in the restaurant, ""You shouldn't pay for your dinners..there's sh*t coming up from the toilets..your dinners should be free!!""

I had chosen here mostly because of the wines that we had. The menu here seemed like a good foil for our wines. We started off with the ceviche. I was wanting a bit more acid from it personally. But, it was pretty good on the whole. We also got the caprese for a light salad. These were nice with the balsamic adding a very nice touch.  We then moved onto some of the more hot tapas. The bacon wrapped dates were easily the best thing here. I'm really not sure why more wasn't ordered,oh well. The gnocchi was pretty good but I liked the brown butter sauce more than the gnocchi.

The upstairs part of the restaurant has a great ambiance - very warm and friendly, however, my party was seated in the basement, where they sit all large parties.  The reason for my two stars: Service was poor. Our server wasn't bad, but I think she was very overwhelmed. She was the only one tending to 5 or 6 large groups, all the way downstairs, with the kitchen and only bartender in the restaurant all the way upstairs. It took us 50 minutes from the moment we were seated to be asked our drink orders. I went upstairs to ask the hostess (who I think is the owner) to please send another server down to help. The bill finally came and there was in fact a 20% gratuity added, which is customary for a party of 6+ but incredibly inappropriate in this case. When we left, we spoke with the owner who apologized but offered no recourse. We told her the food and wine were good and we were happy to have paid for that, but were leaving with a bad taste since we paid almost $70 for service we didn't receive. She told us it was because a busboy had called in sick. Having worked in the restaurant industry, I can tell you that the restaurant needed many more hands that just one bus boy. The downstairs alone should have had its own bartender and at least 2 servers. In the end, she refunded us the gratuity we paid (and my sincere hope is that she didn't penalize the server, because I truly believe that ensuring there is enough help on hand is management's responsibility.)

The tzatziki sauce accompaniment was not the traditional soupy sauce, but more of a relish or spread - we commented on trying to make this dish at home, we liked it that much. -- Balsamic Glazed Pork w/eggplant - wow! The pork was not dry, the outside was salty from the seasoning and sweet from the balsamic.  The eggplant relish was fantastic, a perfect accompaniment. -- Escarole & Canellini beans - I know, this is a very simple dish, but we love the ingredients, and love garlic, and wanted a clean and light dish to accompany our pork. The wine selection was great - tried a greek red wine that was very very light (Agiorgitiko, Domaine Skouras, ""St. George"").  Loved it.

The service was a little lacking, especially since we were the only people in the restaurant.  I had to ask for more water.  The server kept checking on us, but it was because we kept having to order our dishes.

2011-07-17,5.0,"What a great hidden gem! I discovered this little tapas place after signing up for gdine (similar to groupon by offering ""avid diners an online resource to book the best menu experiences in town at exclusive group rates""). I was a bit hesitant about having to pay for my dinner upfront (including tax and tip) but I thought for $36 for a course meal was too good of a deal to pass up.  I went with a group of friends on Friday night. We had reservations for 5 of us at 8pm. A girlfriend and I arrived first and a nice hostess offered us a seat at the bar while we waited for the rest of our party to arrive. We ordered a pitcher of sangria (not included in the gdine deal, unfortunately) and just chatted with the other diners at the bar. They seemed to all be repeat customers and we found out that the bartender was also a cook. One of the guys sitting next to me raved about her paella. I always find it comforting when a restaurant has such ""fans""- it shows that the food AND service is consistently good.  When the other three girls showed up, we made our way outside. The seating was comfy (nothing I hate more than hard, un-comfy patio furniture) and the atmosphere nice and casual. We ordered our first course meal and fifteen minutes later, out it came! We ate, then took another look at the menu, and ordered our second course, and so on and so on. Everything that came out was so delicious! We all tried to order a different plate and not one plate had a scrap of food left on it after we were finished with it! My menu: First course: caprese salad (YUM. One of the best I've had- nice and fresh and a large portion for a ""small plate"") Second course: Hummus. Super delicious. Nice and creamy, with a nice spicy touch. A friend got the tortilla which was super great and worth a mention here.  Third course: Pork. Not sure why I ordered this but I struggled a bit with my options...it was heavily focused on seafood and I'm not a fan of food that comes from the ocean Fourth course: creme brulee and chocolate mouse. Again, a large portion for a ""small plate"" and boy, was it appreciated. Again, totally polished the plate. Okay, so every desert ordered was also so mouthwatering delicious. A friend got the caramelized banana (another large ""small plate"") and someone ordered the sorbet, which came out as three scoops of refreshingly cool treats.  Our dinner lasted about two hours- it was one of those lovely dinners where we slowly ate our food, drank our wine, and just girl talked about life. Our waitress was GREAT- she left us alone for the most part (in the best possible way) and didn't rush us to order the next course. The area was quiet but nice, and I heard the hostess tell a customer they're renovating the entire basement. It'd be the perfect spot for a party!

When we asked to speak to the manager we were informed the manager was not in that evening but the server did contact them on the phone to see what could be done.  They wanted to give us a measly 10% discount which we should have been given anyway because they have a deal on FourSquare for your first check-in to receive 10% off, so in essence they weren't giving us any deal.  We asked the server to call the manager back and let us speak to her to which we were told she was no longer available.... really?  Less than 10 minutes after speaking to her the first time....sorry, but I wasn't buying it. I was ashamed and embarassed because I was the one who suggested we go to Nia's that night since we were so close & I had such a good experience there previously.  And what finally pushed me over the edge was when we said we would be reviewing the restaurant on Yelp, the staff once again got mad at us and even worse after my friends posted their reviews they received rude responses from the owner telling them they were being slanderous (which is incorrect verbage by the way) but nonetheless not the point.  Yelp exists as an open forum for free speech for patrons to review their experiences at different places and help future customers get a feel for a place they are considering visiting.  I emphasize FREE SPEECH!!!  And I will also stress to all businesses out there - If you do not want a bad review written about your establishment, I suggest you make sure to be the best you can be and most importanly TREAT YOUR CUSTOMERS WELL!!!!  Without your customers, you would cease to exist.  With that being said, I will not be dining at Nia's again. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I have heard rave reviews about Nia's from friends so I finally decided to try it out for myself.  I enjoyed... and savored every bite.  And service was good, too.  I am not a huge meat eater so everything I ordered was fish or vegetables.  Every last bite was delicious, though, so I am sure the meat dishes must be tasty as well.   I ordered the Nia Salad which was amazing... what a great combination of ingredients.  I also ate the ceviche which I was highly impressed by because I find it difficult to find really good ceviche at too many places.  The best ceviche I've had has been outside the US.  Nia's ceviche sure came close.  I also tried the wild mushrooms with truffles and chili sauce.  And the absolute best dish I had was the Pumpkin Gnocchi with sage butter which I can say with confidence were little bites of heaven that melted in my mouth.   And on the side of all the delicious food I had a Cat's Meow - White Sangria with Cava & Strawberry - very good!  I can't wait to go back.",0.9963,0.758,0.15,0.092,0.5855615832831023

Nia is one of those hidden gems on West Randolph.  Small, quaint, and out of place music defines this tapas bar.  This was my fourth time at Nia, and it was probably the best experience I had. The Nia Salad is spectacular and the Greek Salad is not too far behind.  They were out of the ceviche, which I really wanted to try, so I got the shrimp and avocado instead.  It was delicious (a little cucumber heavy).  The chicken brochette is always good here.  The crabcake was very delicious and light.   The best part of Nia comes at the end of dinner.  The bread pudding is one of the best desserts I have had.  It's warm and comes with ice cream and caramel (pronounced care-uh-mel) sauce...YUM!

After dining here, I can honestly say that I will be back sooner than later! Below is why... Yes, restaurant week is the time for restaurants to show off and in some way I think service and food seems better during this time. That being said I was absolutely a fan of what was tried here. Ceviche: Really good... I'm not going to rave about it, but it was fresh and very tasty. Portion was really good as well. Charcutterie: Meat and cheese... My favorite appetizer... It's so simple, but really, really good. I also appreciated that they did not skimp on the portions. Loved it. Mussels: Friend ordered this. It had chorizo which was very good with the mussels. Only tried one mussel, but I enjoyed it. Fish: It was Mahi mahi that day and was cooked with roasted veggies. Not a huge portion of fish, but not small either. Also, it was cooked perfectly. I thought it a bit salty at first, but really enjoyed it. Sauteed banana: So simple yet so satisfying! Banana with a caramel sauce and chopped nuts. What's not to like about that? Overall, I'm quite glad I came here for lunch. It is close to work and a really good deal for restaurant week. I'll definitely be back!",0.9977,0.702,0.279,0.019,0.5486984126984127

The setting is small and the tables are relatively close together, but instead of feeling like you're packed into the restaurant you feel like you're having dinner with friends. I find that tables regularly interact with one another and it only adds to the overall warmth of the place.  Over 5+ visits our sevice has never been anything but superb. Our sever is attentive, exceptionally polite, and always seems to appear when you need something, a quality that cannot be understated.  The food. Well, there isn't much to say about this except it very reasonably priced and it's exceptional. Warm and cold tapas, paella, and even the selection of tasty meats and cheeses are all wonderful. My personal favorites are the ceviche and the beef brochette. I challenge you to find a more tenderly prepared brochette for less than $15.  The bar is ample for complete dinner, a nice selection of everything from scotch to micro brew beer is available. A little something for everyone.

We got the red sangria, it was OK, had better at other places. The restaurant is small but have good noise level. The price point is bad for the food portion compare to other tapas places with better tasting food. Servings size are much smaller than other downtown tapas places.  Let's start off with the good, average and bad food:  The Good:  Patata Bravas - good, very flavorful Lamb & Feta Meatballs - good, excellent tomato sauce Beef Brochette - very well cooked, best item for the night Citrus Ceviche- very good The Average: Roasted Suckling Pig - the flavor was good but it would be better if the skin was crispy.   Chicken Brochette - OK, nothing special Grilled Calamari - little over cooked, a bit rubbery   Seared Diver Scallops -perfectly cooked, little over salted The Bad: Sautéed Mediterranean Mussels - worst dish we got there, first time it came out, we can smell the mussels was bad so we return the dish telling them there are bad mussels in the dish. They came out with another plate of mussels and again, it was not fresh. We can smell the bad mussel when they put the dish down. Finally we just canceled the order. Mussels are one of those foods where if there is just one bad one, it ruin the whole dish!  I was so surprise the server still took the dish out to us with the way it smell.  The staff was friendly and pleasant. The only compliant I have for the staff is inconsistent service.

So I book it and Fine Dine Deal CONFIRMS my reservation and CHARGES my credit card. Wow...all good. At 9pm on Dec. 30, I get a frantic call from Nia. They are not honoring any online reservations and ""forgot"" to notify Fine Dine Deal or the other online reservation website. Apparently, restaurants can just cancel or not honor reservations made on these online reservation websites for any reason whatsoever. No further explanation was given. And Nia told me that it was up to me to get my refund through the site. WTF?  If I book again at Fine Dine Deal or Opentable or Yelp, will a restaurant just tell me that they are too busy to take me on the night I want, but that I can come in on some random Tuesday when they are less busy (that was Nia's recommendation...that I come in on a less busy night!  Sorry Nia, I booked NYE because that's when I was going out to dinner)?

I am still not clear if I have been refunded. No one has confirmed anything. I wont be going to Nia ever.  And I don't think the deal websites can possibly make it if the restaurants can be arbitrary on their taking and honoring of reservations.  Just a warning to everyone.

We went because I had bought a 'youswoop' that was about to expire - bought in fact b/c I love tapas, Mediterranean in particular.  We were taken to a cozy booth, and treated very nicely.  I asked to sample two different wines - a syrah and viognier blend (for me, unheard of) and a mablec - which was nice, and which we went with, thus using up the entirety of my coupon ;)   I ordered 'citrus ceviche' - which was just that, far far far too citrusy. The very small amount of black roe that came with this dish made the few bites that incorporated it more than palatable, and it would be my suggestion they utilize far more to balance out the citrus taste. We also ordered the 'shrimp and avocado' which was more flavorful, and  I would say overall decent, if not astounding.  Finally, we ordered the 'hot' 'mushrooms in truffle oil and chili flakes'.  While my boyfriend enjoyed the mushrooms - we both like mushrooms, and truffle oil - but these were just ok, not astounding, and there was no note of chili flakes anywhere. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad to have tried another restaurant on this stretch of the 'near west side' - but as far as that goes, 3 of 3 restaurants in this area have left me not wanting to return.

The owner himself served us and explained the full menu to us and we tried a variety of tapas that we loved.

The argula salad with the crusted goat cheese was soo darn good. Pumpkin gnocci and baked goat cheese were also mouth-watering delicious. Stuffed olives and crab stuffed mushrooms were good but nothing special.  Overall I was quite pleased with Nias and would not hesitate to go back.

On the restaurant's website and Metromix, they entice customers with ""Half off bottles of wine"" on Mon/Tue. Not true.  Apparently this is only the case for 4 people or less, and if you are on their mailing list. What? Maybe before listing a special, you should say ""inquire for more details"" or ""restrictions apply"". I see now that they put it on Yelp, but their own website would be more effective. Update- now ""restrictions apply"" on their website! Looks like they learned something- or maybe this wasn't the first time.......... We tried to reason with our server, who offered to discount one bottle of wine, but we had split 3 bottles between 5 people (plus ordered lots of food). My friend asked to talk to the manager, who was only available via phone- and instead of addressing the issue or compromising, HUNG UP on my friend! I hope the only other 2 people in the place witnessed this.  You can bet I am never going back here again! Too bad. Poor management and misleading advertising.

Second was the special  seafood ceviche, it was fresh yet ok....I've had better. Next we had the escargot on toast points (also at the same time we realized we ordered waaay too much food, great portion sizes for tapas) The escargot were rich as well and made my mouth very happy. It was nice to try something different from the escargot in the crock with garlic butter...though my husband and I both agreed we preferred our snails in garlic bath. Then the last two courses: lamb and feta meatballs (fresh from warming up in the  microwave) which was totally passable and left us burping up foul smelling gasses from our stomachs all day, and I only had 1/2 of one. Still wondering where the feta was for we were hoping for large chunks of salty cheese... we could see/taste nothing of the sort. Finally and least appealing of all *drum roll* Duck Confit....bleh, blargh, barf. When it arrived it looked like road kill, presentation was horrible which unsurprisingly matched the flavor. As I took my bite I had to seriously contemplate spitting the dry, pasty bird into my napkin, but  I'm a trooper and I chewed and chewed till I could finally manage to coax my esophagus into allowing such flavors down into my stomach. Duck Confit is one of my most favorite preparations and working at a French restaurant for 6 years I had it almost biweekly...this my friends was no Duck Confit, Mediterranean influenced  or not. Service was friendly and knowledgeable, always a plus. Portions are giant and worth the price. Would I try Nia out again? Yes actually I would, there are enough selections to choose from that I could only hope there would be something else as delish as the chickpea puree. Will it be anytime soon...ehhh probably not.",0.9822,0.836,0.131,0.033,0.5690025252525254

2009-05-03,3.0,"Mmm, mmm, good!  From Chicago to Spain, Nia is one of the few vegetarian-friendly tapas bars that I've ever visited.  With approximately (16) vegetarian dishes on the menu, veg-heads can't go wrong.  The artichoke heart dish was fresh and hit the spot, and the chickpea puree was a creative alternative to hummous.  The goat cheese-stuffed piquillo peppers were also a delight -  a perfect fire roasted vegetable-meets-tangy dairy combo.  In fact, the pepper dish was so good that it pained me to follow tapas protocol and share!",0.9568,0.715,0.234,0.051,0.6625000000000001

2009-04-11,4.0,"Met my mom here for a light dinner before the Yelp event at Bon V...what an adorable place!  Anyone who knows me knows I am a BIG fan of small-dish dining so tapas have always been my thing.  While I love Spanish tapas, I was thrilled to see several Mediterranean-style dishes on the menu as well.  I was also impressed by the menu's wide selection, especially considering the size of this place...it seemed to be the sort of restaurant that would have a small and rotating menu, which can be hit-or miss.  The specials menu was also impressive. From the moment I walked in the service was polite and attentive.  My mom said her dirty martini was done perfectly.  We ate a couple small dishes at the bar (I REALLY wanted to order more - it all looked so good - but I was trying hard to avoid that whole eye/stomach thing).  While I really liked the flavor combination of the beef carpaccio, it was a bit skimpy on the beef and would've benefited from less sea salt.  The seafood cocktail was generous on the seafood (esp. if you like octopus) but otherwise could've used a little something in the flavor department.  They should also serve it with toast points all the time (we had to ask for them). The atmosphere at Nia's is beautiful and cozy...very tastefully done.  Based on this experience, it seems the food could benefit from just a little fine-tuning, but I really look forward to coming back here to try a lot more of the menu. We had the pleasure of meeting and chatting with Nia herself who was behind the bar.  She personally made point to ensure our experience there was stellar. I have no idea what the deal is with all the QMHs giving this restaurant such a bad rap...the vitriol in some of these reviews is stunning and really makes me question their validity.  Who knows...every restaurant (especially young ones) suffers bad days and the occasional bad employee.  But it seems Nia is very hands-on in her commitment to do everything right. I think this little place has a LOT of potential to be 5-star stellar and really look forward to seeing the day that happens.  In the meantime, I'll be back...and next time I'll use the FREE VALET!",0.9844,0.788,0.144,0.068,0.5299805636540331

2009-03-14,5.0,"Wow !!! Normally when you see a restaurant change their menu after one year , you see quality and pricing value go down. This is not the case here.... I visited Nia's the other night and was more than surprised about food , the sauces and even the sangria is better, not that sweet  stuff the kids like but a well balanced sangria with a kick. Who ever is the new chef is? Our waiter really directed us to some dishes. Marty started us with a wonderful seafood soup with veg tables and rice. A appetizer of grilled egg plant with a sun dried tomato sauce.  Our next dish was grilled calamari with garbanzo beans wonderful flavor. Don't leave their without trying the duck confit , duck breast so succulent with mushrooms and a fruit medley to die for..  Then our main course my date had a lobster thermodor with  crab and shrimp what a treat. I enjoyed a crispy ravioli with a sweet potato sauce. Then with very little room left we opted for a blueberry and  lemon terimisu. Much better than the old one they had. The people in the kitchen have really have brought this place to a new plateau. Our service was truly superior too. GREAT JOB NIA.....",0.9913,0.74,0.216,0.043,0.5382525252525252
2009-02-12,1.0,"I have had better experiences at the DMV than I did at this restaurant, and I think they will treat you better too.    I have never been so mistreated by staff in all my life.  All of the food we ordered was screwed up and we received nothing we had ordered initially.   The sangria was expensive and made from the cheapest ingredients they could use.  Our waiter directly, verbally insulted my girlfriend, the others I was with, and myself.  Before even receiving all of our entrees we knew we had to say something because we thought we were getting someone else's food.  The waiter proceeded to tell us that we ordered something completely else and stormed off.  When he finally came back we asked for the check and were charged the full amount for all the things we hadn't even ordered.  We told the manager how appalled we were and told her we would pay for the sangria which she then charged us $30.00 for and the saganaki we had ordered and actually received.  However, they had racked up a bill of over $100.00 for things we hadn't ordered.  All I can wonder is how our waiter could pretend to understand english so well. To sum up this whole experience I say, ""BEWARE,"" to anyone that thinks this place is worth trying.  There are many good restaurants in this area that will treat you well and bring you ""what you ordered"" without an attitude.   I am born and raised in Chicago and have been to virtually all the restaurants in the city, or at least as many as I can. I HAVE NEVER BEEN TREATED SO BADLY FOR SOMETHING I WAS PAYING FOR IN ALL MY LIFE.   One star is an overstatement!",-0.1701,0.855,0.07,0.075,0.437719298245614
2009-01-26,2.0,"So this spot was choosen for geographic reasons first and foremost. I have heard- via the grapevine- that it was inconsistent and I would say that is the case. It is an intimate and attractive setting. The main courses which we shared were odd. The gorgonzola ravioli has cooked far in excess of necessity, and the portobello starters were not portobellos. No matter- we makes substitutions all the time- but maybe it is best not to mention ports on the menu if we are having supply chain issues. The shrimp gnoshi was divine though. When in that neck of the woods, I cannot say I would make the point to revisit. I've had better.",0.9581,0.82,0.158,0.022,0.5395833333333333

Sangria: It had no fresh fruit! All frozen fruit that turned soggy after it melted. Don't think we will be going back again...,0.9364,0.807,0.165,0.029,0.5612554112554112

2008-06-26,3.0,"I cant complain about the 2 hour wait on a Saturday night for a table because it was during taste of Randolph. We actually came back about 45 minutes early to check to see if a table had opened up and were seated right away on the sidewalk. The customer service was excellent. Marty was super attentive. When we mentioned to him that the mussels were a bit undercooked he didn't argue and just took them away and replaced them with something else of our choice.  When I go out for tapas I like everything to flow smoothly. Maybe because it was late that the dished came too many at a time. I barely had time to digest one dish before another one came. I enjoyed the Nia salad although the ingredients were too small to find. I like big chunks of avocado or tomatoes so I can see them and feel like I ordered more than a plate of lettuce. The food was good over all but a smidge bland for my taste. They offered three types of Sangria; red, white, and blush - interesting. I tired the red and white. I liked the red the best.  Super desserts. They were out of most of the sorbet and Marty had to come back three times to ammend the sorbet menu because they seemed to be out of everything. We also had lemon cheesecake.

Fried Egg Cazula was awesome in concept - but the chorizo was way overcooked - almost burnt.

It was Thursday night, the place was half full. Our wine was being served before water! I had to ask our server for water twice! The food is just ok. We ordered Saganaki and Elephant Garlic. They were not quite up to par. Though, the Broiled Octopus was pretty amazing. What made me give two stars are because of the service and the terrible choice of music.

2008-03-23,4.0,"I love when something new opens up and delivers on its promise from the very start.  Nia is just such a place and we had an opportunity to check  it out last night. Open for about a month, Nia is an intimate space (about 50 seats)  that is in what used to be an old tailor shop but you would never know that by looking around.  From the two tables in the front windows (can't wait until Summer to sit and drink their Sangria outside) to the small bar in the front and the tables in the back- Nia's small footprint just adds to it's sense of intimacy.  The owners didn't skimp on the remodel- check out the marble stairs leading to the restrooms downstairs or the lovely tile on the walls.  It all adds up to a very nice experience. While Nia does carry full sized entrees- we chose to go the Tapas route- there are about 25 choices on the menu- and with the help of a very friendly and patient waiter, were able to choose 5 different plates to share.   On the cold side we started with the seafood cocktail which was good -4 big shrimp with octopus and crab served in a spicy red sauce.  On the hot side, we chose scallops wrapped in prosciutto served with two sauces, Commanderia (shrimp cooked with a variety of mushrooms), Lamb meatballs stuffed with feta cheese, and my favorite, the lamb shoulder which was braised and tender served with a cilantro mint sauce.  All very good. After all of this there was no room for dessert but I wish I had saved space as the tiramasu that the waiter described sounded amazing.  They also make three different kind of  ""fruit infused"" sangrias(with strawberries, mangos and raspberries) which sounded great but felt too summery for this cold March night. Service was attentive and helpful without being obtrusive and dinner for the two of us including a few drinks came in just under $100. Will we be back?  Absolutely.  Now if only the weather would warm up so we could sit outside, enjoy our tapas and sangria and watch the world go by on this busy corner of Randolph Street.",0.9965,0.831,0.162,0.007,0.5404156954156955

First off the food is great, amazing variety, service was really good too. Thats usually where I draw the line with my reviews but this place was  just too weird. The music was awful, this techno/pop mix at underground club volume and the decor looked like Goldmember  from the Austin Powers movie decorated. Still none of this shook a stick at the fact that the  lady who introduced herself as the owner, was hammered at the bar and continued to say rude things to my friend.
