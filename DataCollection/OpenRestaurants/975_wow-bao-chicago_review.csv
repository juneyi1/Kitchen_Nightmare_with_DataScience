Panda Express serves one potsticker and no bao, and Panda's really the only national Chinese chain. Shake Shack is in a *very* crowded field; there is no shortage of burger joints. Advantage Two: inexpensive, tasty food. Shake Shack's food may be tasty but it ain't cheap. Advantage Three: because WB isn't representing itself as gourmet fare, its supply chain is much simpler. Any town big enough to hold a fast food joint also has foodservice suppliers.  If they went national they'd clean up.",0.884,0.78,0.142,0.077,0.4921052631578946

I ordered a chicken teriyaki bao, and a coconut custard one ($1.89). She ordered a chicken teriyaki bao, a five-piece order of chicken potstickers with soy ginger sauce ($4.69), and a homemade pomegranate ginger ale ($2.69). The bao (baos?) were delicious. The outside is fluffy and soft, and the inside is full of flavor. The chicken teriyaki filling is sweet,with just the right amount of spice. The coconut custard one was a bit too sweet for my liking, but I'd order it again. The best thing we ordered was actually the potstickers. I've been to Wow Bao a number of times but had never tried them, until she ordered them. They were super flavorful and well cooked, the outside was just the right amount of soft and a little chewy. The dipping sauce complemented them perfectly. The pop was pretty delicious too. If you're torn between the original and pomegranate, definitely go for the pomegranate.

2014-10-07,3.0,"My boyfriend and I were wandering around Water Tower Place and saw ""Wow Bao"" in the directory. We immediately needed to find it (he was craving BBQ Pork Buns). Since we had never been to this mall before, we had some difficulty finding it, but BAM, there it was by one of the entrances.  It's a fast food type of place with cute decor. They have many flavors you can choose from, but since we were going to have dinner in a bit, we snacked on two: the Thai Curry Chicken & BBQ Pork. The chicken was definitely unique but didn't  blow my mind. The BBQ Pork was OK - lackluster compared to what I've had in the past. In my opinion, the price was a bit much: almost $2 each for a 2- bite bao. For mall food, that seems pretty steep. Other than that, staff was nice and their seating is inconveniently located on the next level up.  If I""m ever back in Chicago I'd definitely try a few of their other flavors!",0.9776,0.853,0.138,0.009,0.5947368421052631
2014-09-29,3.0,"Before we started some shopping in the mall, we decided to get a snack at Wow Bao, which was located just past the entrance.  The menu consisted of savory and sweet steamed baos, steam dumplings, rice and noodle bowls and salads.   With Bao in its name, baos was what we were going to try.  The savory filling choices included spicy kung pao chicken, whole wheat edaname, teriyaki chicken, Thai curry chicken, spicy Mongolian beef and bbq pork. Coconut custard and chocolate were the sweet options. We opted for the Thai curry chicken and bbq pork.  After placing our order, we were told that there would be about a ten minute wait for the Thai curry chicken as they were being steamed. We opted to wait as this was an interesting filling for a bao.  After getting our order, we took it up to second floor where Wow Bao has tables for its customers to enjoy their food.  The Thai curry chicken filling was tasty and the BBQ pork was ok as I've had tastier ones.  At $1.79 each and the size of the baos, I would say they are pricey considering BBQ pork buns that are larger can be had for $.75 each. I could have eaten two for a satisfying snack.  Overall, friendly staff and unique choice for the bao filling. Just felt at $1.79 each, it was pricey for these small baos.",0.979,0.882,0.113,0.005,0.6326086956521738
2014-09-21,2.0,"This place was located in one of the shopping malls close to my hotel, and it offered a quick snack for me while I waited for my room to be ready.  The food was ok, considering it is a fast food joint, but I will not be coming back for seconds. Food:  The menu of this joint is mainly filled with different types of steamed Chinese buns, with a small assortment of noodles and soups.  I got a curry chicken bun, BBQ pork bun and a ginger ale.  Both steamed buns were ok but not very authentic as far as the flavors.  The texture of the bun itself was nice, soft and warm, but the sizes are so small!  They aren't even the size of my palm, and I have small hands.  Maybe I am spoiled because I live in an area (San Francisco bay area) where you can get softball sized authentic steamed buns for about the same price.  I was expecting 2 buns to be enough for lunch, but it ended up being a just a snack.  The ginger ale was way too gingery.  It was so gingery-spicy that I would consider it undrinkable.  After a few sips I had to throw it away. Price:  The price of their items seems reasonable, but I would say their steamed buns are way over priced for their size.  $1.50 for 1 bun seems cheap, but if you need to buy a dozen buns to feel full it's not really a good deal.  If you are just looking for a light snack this place is great because you can get a few different items for a very cheap price. Atmosphere:  This place is considered a fast food counter inside of a mall, so there really isn't much atmosphere to it.  There is no immediate seating by the food stand, but if you take the escalators up a bit you can find some tables and benches to eat at on the higher levels. Staff / Service:  The cashier was very friendly and welcomed each guest with a smile.  I ordered using the kiosks because I thought that would be fun (and it gave me plenty of time to browse the food options.)  The staff who put your food order together seemed very stressed out and didn't smile at all as they yelled out order numbers.   I don't expect much from a fast food joint, but at least the guy who was taking orders seemed friendly. This place is great for a quick, cheap snack if you are shopping in the mall, but I would not go out of my way to each here.  There was nothing really special about their food, but at least it was different than the typical fast food counters you see in malls.",0.9889,0.872,0.101,0.027,0.5044875316990702

So we go into the tower to find there are no tables by this venue (I guess there are a few up the escalators maybe??) but here I could get 6 baos for less than $10!!!

As far as counter-order kiosks inside a mall serving Americanized Asian food with slightly offensive slogans go, this place is solid!   Disclaimer: I haven't had bao very many times and I haven't had it in a long time so I am not the best judge in terms of comparisons to some constructed or agreed-upon authenticity standard of bao. (I don't play authenticity, but for those that would hold a mall kiosk to such scrutiny I figured I would let ya know up front.) I had the BBQ pork, curry chicken, and the whole wheat veg.

It's not safe to be a ginger in this world, lemmetellya. In other news, I recently discovered that they have these wonderful bowls that are topped with the same fillings they use inside their buns. I had a thai curry chicken bowl. You can pick from rice or quinoa and healthy lunches make me happy, especially since I'm doing this calorie counting thing. The whole bowl was well within my limit.

Dramatically put, this is (one of) the food(s) of my childhood and I was excited finding it here, in my new country!   Wow bao is conveniently located at the bottom of the escalators at one of the Water Tower Place mall entrances. Tucked away in a small corner there is often a snaking line of people waiting to place their order on the touch screen gizmo. Wow bao was doing this type of ordering before an iPad even existed.. swanky huh.  The fresh homemade ginger ale and hibiscus iced tea are refreshing and good. The drinks are not overly sweet, which is a plus for this strict waterdrinker.   The bao are small-ish, two make a perfect snack and three and up will really fill you quick. They are little pockets of joy, which is mighty handy when walking around the mall. No fussing with forks, or the fear of dropping something from in between your sandwich.  As a meateater I used to enjoy the mongolian beef, chicken teriyaki (albeit sweet) and bbq pork varieties. There are however several veggie options available.

So, I joined M for her commute to work and we stopped in to get some Wow Bao together.

I brought them back to M's place and have been eating them while watching my shows (I think this may be the PERFECT way to spend my day off!). The guy at Wow Bao was super friendly.

2012-10-14,1.0,"I didn't review this place, like, right away?  Wow... but JUST wow... wow without the bao. Guess what, my friend who planned the itinerary for this trip (happened last Nov, btw) had this place on our list.  The day we passed by one (closer to the Marilyn Monroe statue), it was closed -- figured that place was geared toward office clientele, so understandably so it was closed on the weekends.  We were looking forward to visit the one on THIS location the day after. It was Sunday, about dinner time, and this place is right under the Lego store, so you bet it's open.  So we entered into the building, and being AT LEAST 15 FEET away from it, behind the crowd that was in line for some buns, we started to take some pictures of their store front.  No flash, mind you.  And then we were about to order some buns to try ourselves. Suddenly, a very harsh voice yelled out to us: ""NO PICTURES!!!  NO PICTURES!!!"" An Asian (presumably Chinese) man looked at us and screamed angrily from behind the counter, while busily prepping his orders or rolling dough or something.  Interestingly, last time I was ""barred"" from taking pictures by the store staff while on MALL GROUND was in Shanghai.  Are Mainland Chinese  THAT protective of their store that they think they own the air surrounding it as well? And was that man thinking we probably wouldn't be patronizing given that we were also Chinese, so he might as well shoo us away so we're not in his way? Sadly, I was going to patronize, but I won't now.  Coz your discrimination against your own race is more unappetizing than any bao that I might or might not have even seen you make.  Too bad, coz I was about to contribute to my people and patronize their business, and I was actually excited to try their bao.  But bc I took one picture too many to their liking, I was treated like a plague.   Who in the right business mind doesn't like free advertising these days?  I would tell you all: don't even bother ""checking-in"" to this place, coz they probably wouldn't appreciate that very much, either.  If you're in China, they might have already shot you by now. Funny thing is, I was practically standing on the ground of the BUILDING, so I was not even in their ""domain"" of control.  They had no ""store"" to enter into; I was ON PUBLIC GROUNDS.  So unless this dude was a uniformed guard or something, I don't think he had the right to command us.  And it's not likeI was being stupid or using flash, or even video-taping his ""business secret"", you know.  Power trip much? Bottom line, if you REEEEALLY have a problem about people taking pictures of your work, I say put a stupid sign up (and I will respect that), or do it in the basement.  On second thought, why not close your store altogether coz we can't even take a picture of the STORE -- not that we were zooming into his hands trying to get between him and his dough, you know!  The whole idea of him hating on us taking pictures and admiring their work, is plain ridiculous and uninviting.

This location is located on the street level of Water Tower Place.  I stopped here on a Sunday and didn't realize that they didn't open until 11AM.  No worries, I walked around the mall for a bit (burning off additional calories to consume MORE bao). I showed up a little after 11AM and there was a short line of people already!  There are two ways to order, either person-to-person or using a touch screen kiosk.  I opted for the touch screen, being the techie geek that I am.  The system was very easy to use and extremely intuitive.  The pricing is straight forward with clear pictures and description.  The checkout process is super fast (credit cards only).   I went for the 6 pack of bao and a hibiscus tea (cold).  The got 2 bbq pork, teriyaki chicken, thai curry chicken, spicy mongolian beef and a coconut custard.   The bao themselves are a good size, about the size of a small apple.  The flavor is amazing, I was pleasantly surprised to be honest.  The bbq pork is just like eating one from a Chinese dim sum place.  Full of flavor and the distinct Chinese bbq pork flavor and smell.  The other one that I loved was the coconut custard.  Not too strong in the coconut flavor and not too sweet; simply a great blend of two simple ingredients.   I was a little surprised with the price.  I paid $12 for 6 bao and an iced tea; which I felt was a little steep considering what you get (Chipotle burrito with soda is still under $10).  Even with a higher price, they delivery on a great product with quick service in good locations.

It was recommended to me by an acquaintance who raved about it and I had been wanting to try it for a while so I finally decided to do so this week, only to be extremely disappointed. I wasn't even able to finish my meal - that's how bad it was. I ordered the chicken teriyaki bowl with lo mein noodles and chicken potstickers. First of all, they garnished the bowl with a hefty handful of parsley or cilantro - I can never remember which is which because I hate the flavors of both equally. For me, these garnishes absolutely ruin a dish because unless you want to sit there and pick at your plate for hours, there is no way to remove them all. The flavor was instantly ruined before I even tried it. Secondly, the meat was weird. They were very small (almost minced!) pieces of chicken that were possibly fried, I couldn't tell, and doused in this non-tasty sauce. Don't get me wrong, I am usually a huge fan of Americanized Chinese food, but this was just bad. I honestly couldn't even tell what kind of meat I was eating, or if it was even meat at all. Next came the potstickers. Now, I will provide the disclaimer that this was my first time ever trying potstickers so I can't comment too much about them other than the fact that the chicken mush that was stuffed inside of them was extremely unappealing and displeasing. The soy ginger dipping sauce it came with was just as displeasing to my palate.  The only good thing I liked were the lo mein noodles. That's about all I ate before I had to reluctantly dump the rest of the food. And believe me, I hate wasting food but I just couldn't down this stuff. It seems that I must have come at a bad time or something, because the other reviews here rave for this place, but all I know is that I will not be returning here again.",-0.934,0.825,0.071,0.104,0.6734019684019683

However, when I heard a couple students in one of my classes talking about it and how good they were I started getting curiosity about them. I was waiting for my express bus outside of the water tower and looked at my CTA app and it wasn't coming until 15 minutes. I knew if I went in the water tower and walked around I would come out with a few bags of needless shopping. That's when I decided I would go check out Wow Bao (located in the lobby entrance, no threat to my wallet). I decided to order the Kung Pao beef Bao and a chicken teriyaki Bao. The total was a little over $3, I'll take it. The bus finally came and I made it home to try my Bao. The first one I tried was the beef.

My boyfriend told me to go to Wow Bao because they have these little bao dumpling thingys. Well, ugh after the food I ate at Wow Bao I would rather starve to death. Gross.  I give this place two stars because the ingredients they put in the baos aren't the best but they could be better if they tweaked it.

Any hooter we had chicken teriyaki and spicy beef Mongolian baos. They were gross. Nasty. I wanted to vomit. And now all I have for this place is word vomit.

But, after a trip to the equally touristy Millennium Park we stopped here for a bite on the way home. There are several things working in Wow Bao's favor. The first is that I love pretty much anything Asian, food wise. Second, they have ginger ale. Third, they now sell Korean frozen yogurt.  The food is relatively cheap, considering the location. I mean, this isn't Chinatown or Argyle or Pilsen, it's Michigan Avenue. So, I can respect the pricing. Two could definitely eat well for $20 here. The bao we tried, the edamame and coconut custard, were both delicious. The yogurt was a little less tart than I like, but good, and cheap compared to the small size at other froyo locations. The ginger ale was tasty, but my girlfriend's tea was less than stellar.

Curry Chicken - Curry is a good complement to the doughy texture of a Bao.  The chicken was soft and the curry was strong, which is rare.   Kung Pao - Spicy from the peppers, but not over the top.  Tasty and the peanuts were a good texture supplement. Edamame - Wheat bun was good and tasted no different than the regular bun so you don't miss the gluten.  The edamame stir fry inside was tasty. BBQ Pork - We had to try the BBQ Pork but were suprised that it wasn't the traditional Cha Siu inside.  It seemed more like the American BBQ Pork, which we love anyway, so after getting over ourselves, we realized the taste of the pork was good.  Would have liked to taste a traditional one but this place isn't traditional so I give it a pass. There are other items on the menu I would have tried if we were indulging in a full lunch but had to hold back.  The four buns split between 2 people was a perfect amount of food.  We finished up quickly and headed off to our Chicago Adventure.

I was having a particularly wonderful Thursday: my boyfriend was buying me Lady GaGa tickets, I saw This Is It the Michael Jackson documentary and I had finished all of my homework before going to class. And I was trying Wow Bao for the first time. I was excited. My roommate raved about how much she loved Wow Bao so I was pumped to try something that she likes so much. I ordered from the touch screen kiosk things because I like to touch things and can save my interaction with people for when I have to go in actual restaurants or bars. Because I had never tried Wow Bao, I wanted to taste every bao I could have. So I ordered the six pack because hey-I like variety, I've got a steel stomach and I was READY to be wowed. Eh. not so much. the first bao I tried was the mongolian beef. I bit into it and thought ""mmm tasty."" At first bite, these are delicious little things. Then I ate the second one, bbq pork, and thought ""still delicious, too much bread."" The third one I ate half of, and then used my fork to scrape out the inside filling. For the rest of them (except the whole wheat edamame) I did the same. All in all, it was too much breading and not enough filling. I went into wow bao thinking that it was going to be a light dough that had been steamed, not this heavy bread type of thing that I would get tired of half way through. I was disappointed, but now I knew what the deal was. I will say that the one bright, shining start out of the bunch was the whole wheat edamame. The inside filling is DELICIOUS and the outside dough was better than the plain dough. If I had gotten six of these, I'm sure I would have eaten at least three. I took issues with the dough, as we already know, but my classmate and I soon found out that it is made with milk. Why? There are plenty of ways to make dough without milk and it's not like this is a pie crust. It kind of doesn't mean it. All in all, will I go back? Yes. Will I order 6 bao? No. At most, I'll order two and get a side salad and a ginger ale. I got a ginger ale but it stopped tasting gingery after I ate the bao.

The bbq pork was sweet, and that was the flavor profile: sweet. That was the problem: no nuance, just one note to the flavors. (Also, the pork was not shredded, but ground or somehow formed into strange pellets; it just looked weird!) The saving grace was the coconut custard bao; I would come back for these! It was as if you'd boiled down a can of sweetened coconut milk into a pudding and stuffed it into a dumpling. Yum.  I also tried the homemade ginger ale, but I didn't love it like so many people seem to. I just wasn't impressed: I could taste the ginger, but it still tasted too watery. Frankly, the homemade ginger ale I make is better, and so is my canned ginger ale of choice (Vernors).   My dad was with me and the whole menu was too weird for him.

Ordered said sour soup, and due to their needlessly complicated ordering procedure, almost ended up with a cup of broth. No. Hot n' Sour soup is supposed to be fillled with goodness, lots of tangy vegetables, weird mushrooms, maybe pork or chicken. Savory, tangy HOT. This was neither (spicy) hot NOR sour.  Their version is a virtually tasteless broth, which is served searing (temperature) hot, immediately burning my tender mouth. Minus points. Undercooked vegetables sprinkled on top. Lettuce?! Really!? Onions . . . okay, maybe, but the ultimate sin was the dearth of mushrooms or that weird yet strangely delicious Chinese ""fungus"" ingredient that is in ALL hot n' sour soup. A couple of limp bean sprouts, and a smattering of noodles. Humpf. Underwhelming. The guys behind the counter were charming enough, and seemed apologetic about their strangely complicated ordering procedure.

The wheat bun was warm and soft, and the taste of wheat was inviting.  The fillings were piping hot with a vegetable mix and little rounds of edamame.   The buns are rather small for the price you pay (1.29 for one).  You can definitely find buns for much cheaper at a Chinese store, but you probably won't be able to find them in all these different flavors (teriyaki chicken, spicy kung pao chicken, etc.).",0.7684,0.917,0.068,0.015,0.5349999999999999

They have all sorts of flavors like: kung pao cashew chicken, chicken teriyaki, thai curry chicken, green vegetable, spicy mongolian beef, and bbq pork.

The bao were still warm by the time I got back to the 19th floor, and I enjoyed them over my keyboard.  While they were all soft, steamed and tasty, I think the Kung Pao Cashew Chicken and Mongolian Beef were the best.  The Teryaki and BBQ Pork were a little too sweet for me, and I thought the Curry Chicken could've been a little more spicy.  And honestly, I'd like to see some traditional bao on the menu (though they'd probably lose $$$ on them, after all I'm the only caucasian I know that likes bean curd). I think Wow Bao would be good if you had a craving for bao and you were close by, or were spending a day on the MagMile and needed a quick, steamed burst of flava.   At $1.29 each they taste better and and are healthier for you than a White Castle slider.  So enjoy!",0.9911,0.816,0.174,0.01,0.5501851851851851
