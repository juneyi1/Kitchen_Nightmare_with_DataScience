Sausage and pepperoni pizza was tasty, with just the right amount of grease. Good old Chicago thin crust pizza!

2015-01-12,2.0,"I came here once to grab a quick bite because I was in the area and noticed their sign that advertised $1 slices of pizza. The service was phenomenal. The restaurant itself was very clean and nice. The woman who handled me was very nice and accommodating. I ordered 2 slices of pizza and even though they were supposed to be one dollar per slice they ended up being two dollars a slice which isn't that big of a deal to be honest. I didn't mention the sign outside advertised a different price because I would've felt petty. When the slices of pizza were brought to me, they were piping hot...Which isn't a bad thing at all, but in this case the piping hot slices were on styrofoam plates that were melting and turning black. I didn't say anything about this to the waitress because I didn't want to be rude and I was also in a hurry. Styrofoam aside, the pizza was horrible. Worst slice of pizza I have ever had, hands down. It was very bland even with crushed red peppers and parmesan added. There might be other items they serve that might be delicious but never order single slices of cheese pizza from this place. Little Caesar is better hands down. It's a shame because everything else about the experience was on par. I won't be coming back unfortunately.",-0.9089,0.81,0.076,0.114,0.5695208700764256
2014-12-30,4.0,"I hadn't heard of this place until someone left a couple flyers on our complex door. We decided to give it a shot one night, because their weeknight specials are pretty decent. Really good pizza, I really loved their crust. They also have a real range of food to choose from - gives me an my boyfriend variety all in one place. And unlike a lot of other places with larger menus, the food quality didn't seem to suffer from it. I'd definitely order again.",0.9445,0.819,0.181,0.0,0.5141666666666667
2014-10-11,5.0,"Best pizza in Chicago!!! First time trying the Super Bowl pizza Mexican style and it exceeded my expectations. The fresh Italian cheese and toppings, crispy crust, flavorful pizza sauce and that crunch when you bite into the slice...orgasmic!!! Jose I've been following you since your stint at PJ's on Belmont and I must say you continue to impress me. Also, where in Chicago can you get delicious authentic Mexican food at a pizzeria?!? Only @ Durango's can you get tacos, burritos, tortas, gorditas the whole nine at one place. All I can say is that they make some of the best Pizza & Mexican food in town. If you haven't been here you are missing out!",0.9703,0.807,0.176,0.017,0.36000000000000004
2014-10-07,5.0,"You would never know it but this small Mexican restaurant hiding on Laramie has the best pizza in Belmont Cragin. After D'Gigios went downhill we were forced to look for another fix and Durangos absolutely met that requirement. The thin crust is their specialty (and my recommendation). The crust is full of flavor, and when it's cooked perfectly, it is moist and crispy: the delicious  pizza-paradox®. The sauce isn't too sweet and all of the ingredients are fresh.  The cheese is the right amount of chewy. A super bonus is that they have shrimp and spinach--the true test of a good pizza place. The price is awesome for a freshly made pie. Highly recommended.",0.9909,0.638,0.297,0.065,0.6023544973544973
2014-06-14,4.0,1 star for the idiot pictured in the photos. Not really interested in a restaurant with customers as stupid as that. update: looks like they removed the picture. I eventually tried the wings and pizza here a few weeks ago and it was actually pretty good for the price. back up to 4 stars,0.5984,0.702,0.189,0.109,0.5714285714285714

2013-09-14,2.0,"The pizza is not bad, theres definitely better pizza out there. One thing I really do like is their crust in the pizza though. Other than that the food in here is pretty bad.. The tacos are really cheap, I decided to try them one day.. Horrible idea, the tacos were so plain and nasty. The Horchata is not very good also, and also they should try improving their customer service. The people always are so serious and the owner I believe, he is always giving an attitude.",0.4483,0.705,0.161,0.133,0.6328067765567765

2012-01-03,4.0,Hay caramba! We finally tried the pizza from this place!.............wait!?!?! A pizza place that also sells Tacos and burritos!?!?!?!?!! OH OH..... ( you must remember us Mexicans make the best cooks)......OK with that being said I can go on... anyway we order a xtra large cheese mushroom and sausage! Thin crust and it was AWESOME!!!!! Nice crispy extra thin crust!!!!!! This crust lovers will like this! good sauce. definitely a place to grab a pie if you are out here on the NW side. There is seating inside and of course univision is on the television! AND if you stop by tell  the awesome pair of brother and sister that run the joint that Pedro Infante sent ya!!!! Shake & Bake seal of approval! Hipster infestation level: ZERO!

2009-11-07,5.0,"Great food and reasonably priced!  Their tostadas are awesome and probably the best deal on the menu.  The tortas are good also.  Pizza is pretty good, not as good as an Italian place, but far superior to Domino's or Pizza Hut.",0.9565,0.615,0.385,0.0,0.6681818181818181
