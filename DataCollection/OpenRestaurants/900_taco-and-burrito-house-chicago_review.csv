They put mozzarella (not chihuahua) cheese, sour cream, lettuce and tomato on their tacos and burritos and it just makes it all taste a lot worse. If you like Americanized tacos and burritos then by all means this would be a great spot. I prefer to tell them to just keep it to cilantro and onion. The tamales are decent here too, they're not dry at all but at the same time they're pretty plain with no sauce.

As far as the sides go they really impressed me.  The burrito itself was very good but on this meal the sides were the stars.  The Spanish rice was just like my Mom used to make and had a nice tomato taste in it.  Normally I'm not a fan of refried beans, but I ended up eating all of my beans.  Instead of the normal bland mush that so many places serve the refried beans here had a nice flavor to them.  I had trouble identifying the extra flavor but I suspect it may have been a bit of a bacon flavor.

Turned out my friend lived in the apartment behind this place. It was around 6pm and I was starving.  I knew I had to eat something before hittin' the town so I decide to eat here since I'm already here. Walking inside I could see a three-man team behind the counter waiting for me. The place seemed somewhat empty. I feared not. Usually my go-to choice for Mexican food is a steak burrito or a couple lengua tacos (yeah, I'm all about the tongue). Lo and behold, the menu listed BEEF TONGUE BURRITO as an option. Up until now I had never ordered a lengua burrito...but that's because I've never seen it as an option.  I was so excited. I placed my order at the front counter and made sure to tell them to ADD CILANTRO (pro-tip: it's not normally included). Within two minutes they handed me a brown bag (I ordered to-go) and I ran back to my friend's place to eat it. I open the bag 'n took a couple bites...I was in BURRITO HEAVEN. Never before had I enjoyed a burrito this much...and I was sober. One of my favorite things about this burrito is that it doesn't come with rice. Who needs rice? More room for meat! Sour cream was standard...as if they knew. Everything in this burrito melded together perfectly. They threw in a tiny container of red salsa & green salsa.  Both were good. My buddy and I cabbed it around town to attend a few Halloween parties.Three parties, eight hours, and a couple drinks later I came back to pick up my car...and was hungry.  Can you guess what I was thinking? HELL YES...TWICE.  Oh yes I did! (It was technically a different day, right?) This time there was a line going out the door! I didn't care. The burrito team behind the counter was taking care of business...crankin' them out.  Before I knew it I was sitting down staring at another beef tongue burrito.  This time I had squeeze bottles of hot sauce 'n salsa verde.  I ordered an horchata to wash it down. My plate looked clean. No shame here.  Fast. Tasty. Cheap. Great portions. Good Horchatas. Minus two stars for the grease. Add one star because the grease was tasty!

2011-06-16,2.0,"The food here sucked. I ordered two carne asada tacos and a carne asada burrito which are usually standard safe items at any mexican place. The quality of meat was very bad--the tacos were one tiny notch above El Ranchito, which is not saying much at all. The burrito was slightly better but only because the tortilla had this simultaneous chewy crispy texture (kind of like it was grilled). However my review might be biased because when I go to small-run down taco joints, I expect the tacos to be small and have strictly carne asada, cilantro, and onions. Not all that sour cream, american cheese blend, lettuce, and tomato shtuff. Also what makes good legit mexican food is the HOT SAUCE (I see you King Taco in LA) and this place had overly fire-roasted hot sauce and a flavorless, mild green hot sauce.",0.7354,0.896,0.073,0.031,0.41613756613756614

2009-06-18,2.0,"The Staff: These guys are machines. Rain, snow, or fight, these guys just don't stop making burritos. This is a totally true story. One late night after having a few beers, Z and I decided to grab a couple of burritos at The House. We placed our orders and I made my way to the bathroom. While I was away at the bathroom, all hell had broken loose. In one corner of the restaurant were two dudes wrestling each other to the ground. In another corner was some dude yelling at another dude who was shielding his girlfriend. In the main area was a very wet floor covered by several broken chairs, a flipped table and four dudes who were trading punches with each other. It was mass chaos. I thought about my safety briefly, but found myself more concerned with my burrito. Afterall, it was 4am and nothing beats a good burrito after an evening's booze fest. So my attention turned towards the kitchen. Even though a major fight was taking place behind them, the cooks worked fervently on the backlogged burrito orders. Because of the staff's solid work ethic and dedication, there was no delay in me getting fed. Eventually the fight carried to the outdoors and the CPD showed up. The cops did their job in cleaning up the riff raff, while Miguel, the head janitor at the Burrito House did his job in cleaning up the floor so the guests could get back to what mattered most; burrito eatin'. The Food: Greasy and not so good. Burrito House presents a slightly different burrito than most typical Chicago style burrito joints. I have had the chicken burrito here several times. The burrito is primarily meat based. (In other words there are not a lot of vegetables.) The meat is cube cut and tastes like it's been fried in a heavy garlic oil. The garlic really penetrates the meat and its like a garlic explosion in your mouth with each bite. And about that oil... There really needs to be less. The last burrito I had here might have been the greasiest burrito I have ever had. (And I eat an average of 3 to 5 burritos per week.) I couldn't finish the burrito. The grease was just too much.  It's unfortunate. What has the potential to be a great burrito is completely destroyed by the greasy, slimy, heavy oil slick these cooks throw down in cookin' up my tubular delight. On the bright side, the hot sauce is good and they aren't stingy with it. Also, the prices are reasonable here. Unfortunately, the House only gets two stars. With so many late night burrito options, I don't think I will be going back anytime soon, unless of course I'm in the mood for a fight!",-0.9604,0.831,0.063,0.106,0.4689412175126461
