2017-08-31,4.0,"Arrived early on a Saturday morning for breakfast at the urging of a vegetarian coworker who heard I would be in the neighborhood. I am an unapologetic omnivore, and wouldn't typically chose a vegetarian stronghold such as Victory's banner for the first meal of the day. I gotta say, I'm freakin' glad I did! I was very very close to ordering their famous bottomless chai, but the lure of the extra caffeine jolt in coffee was too much to pass up. It was quite good. Sonnets have been written about the French toast at Victory's Banner. Hyperbole, of course. I thought as much when I ordered. When my FT arrived, and I took a bite, my eyes opened just a little wider. The bread was pillowy, yet substantial enough to stand up to the batter. Expertly griddled. It was basically the best French Toast I've ever had.  This place is awesome. The employees are genuinely nice. Check it out immediately.",0.9781,0.848,0.152,0.0,0.46796296296296297

I had it many times before I remember it was much more moist instead of dry. The moist in middle of thick cut potato bread was the best part before, and that was the thing it was so good about it compare to other french toast out there.

From the introduction it was great. Location was perfect. Sun shines on this restaurant as if they pay the Sun to do it. Food  tasted amazing! Ericka the host/waitress was a rock star. But then came a twist. When I asked for the checked I was clearly overcharged. On the menu, the egg white veggie delight omelet was priced at $10.45. Ordered that. If you want the side salad oppose to the potatoes and bread. Additional $1.45. I'll take that. And I also ordered oatmeal made in milk with cinnamon apples. $4.95. $16.85 should have been my total. You add taxes should have been $18 and some change. Well my total was $20.33. When Ericka brought the itemized copy the veggie omelet and salad was priced at $13.45. So I can questioned her about it, and her reply was our system automatically adds the taxes. Which made no sense! Let me add I tipped on my bill after the discrepancy was obviously on their end.

BUT I assumed that a vegetarian restaurant with granola on the menu would at least be decent. You know those hard Nature Valley oats and honey bars that come two to a pack?  Yeah I'm 100% confident the ""granola"" we were served were just those crushed up in a bowl. You could see the square edges of the pieces, no fooling anyone!  Oh but they did throw in some raisins, so wow really stepped it up there. The yogurt was grocery store vanilla (not even Greek, not creamy). The fruit...crappy fruit salad...you know melon, pineapple, apples...none of the type of fruit you would ever mix in with granola and yogurt.   We would have been better off just spending $3 at Jewel if this is the meal we were going to get.  Just can't believe a restaurant would put granola on their menu and serve you something like this, makes me feel like they have no pride in their food at all.   Giving it two stars since the servers were nice, that's about it.",0.9857,0.772,0.179,0.049,0.5527777777777777

2017-02-13,1.0,"This is one of those cases where the 4 star average review is confusing.  I've ordered from Victory's Banner a few times (via uber eats), and the first two times were ""ok"".  Mediocre, but not terrible.  And obviously not bad enough for me to order a third time.   Though, I ordered today and it was just plain awful.  Embarrassingly bad.  I convinced my partner that she should try this place with me, and it was a disaster.   ""Chicken"" Wrap:  The entire inside of the wrap was soaked in sauce, inedibly so.  The ""bacon"" was this weird, soft, uncooked substance that tasted like the vegan equivalent of spam.  As a result of the wateriness, the ingredients just flopped out, leaving a mushy mess of cheap tasting tortilla.  Flavor was overpowered by the odd tangy sauce.  It went straight in the trash.   Neatloaf Sandwich:  You guys should honestly be ashamed of the mess you delivered to me today.  The ""meatloaf"" itself was nearly flavorless, soggy and undercooked.  The bread was rock hard, which created a structural mess.  It seemed like someone over-toasted the toast, and just said f it anyway.  There were maybe 4 tiny pieces of spinach, and 3 pieces of iceberg, all wilted and disgusting.  First, WHY are you using both iceberg and spinach on the same sandwich?  Whyyyy?  It's so strange, both from a flavor and quality perspective.  I've never seen this on a sandwich.  I'm not exaggerating the wilt, it was terrible and nearly chewy.  The worst part of this miserable sandwich was the sauce.  It tasted absolutely rancid.  I'm having a hard time believing it wasn't.  I didn't get sick, which is great.  But it also means you've managed to create a sauce that isn't actually spoiled, yet tastes like it is.  Mashed Potatoes And Gravy:  Potatoes were ok, tasted a little old though, but edible.  Can't really f up potatoes.  But you sure can mess up gravy.  It was too salty with an overall indiscernible flavor.  The mushrooms were also hilariously undercooked for gravy. I realize this review is harsh, and in contrast to other reviews here, but the food really was this bad.  There seem to be decent options on the menu, according to others.  Maybe I just ordered the terrible ones.  Either way, I definitely won't be ordering from here again, or recommending anyone else does. Update 2/14/17:  After writing this review last night, I received an incredibly aggressive and insane private message this morning from a user named ""Ben G."", asserting that my reviews are ""unprofessional"" (which doesn't even make sense, considering Yelp review writing isn't a profession), tasteless and wholly negative.  In a later reply in the message thread, this unstable person calls me a ""big fat loser"" and other uncreative, childish, poorly written epithets.  I think it's odd and suspicious timing to have received this message so shortly after writing this negative review.  I'm unsure if this person is affiliated with Victory's Banner, but they have written their own (5 star, coincidentally) review for this business, which you can search for.  All of my reviews are honest and unembellished.  If I leave a negative review, it's because I believe the company's quality or actions warranted such a review.  Victory's Banner, if you know this person, I'd suggest somehow quelling their insanity.  Ive reported this person to Yelp.",-0.9955,0.713,0.102,0.185,0.5292095667095665

2016-12-12,4.0,"Victory's Banner is like an old friend you realize you've neglected -- no phone calls, no texts, no emails over too long a time -- and you decide to get together and renew your relationship. When I mentioned going to Victory's Banner to my friend Jen, she sat back and said, I don't think I've been there in 10 years. I hadn't either. So, on a chilly Friday morning, we headed over to Roscoe Village. I don't think the ambiance has changed in these last 10 years. The colors are bright and cheerful. The restaurant is still small, tables tucked fairly close together. When we got there, only one other table was occupied, so we pretty much had the place to ourselves. Jen ordered a cup of the cauliflower soup, which she allowed me to taste. We both agreed that you couldn't taste cauliflower at all. In fact, there was a distinct mushroom taste, and you could see bits of mushroom floating in the faux-cream. It was a very good soup, but I'd call it mushroom instead of cauliflower. We both went with wraps. I had the BLT wrap, which was vegetarian, not vegan. Oh boy, it was SO GOOD! Absolutely delicious. It really filled me up, too. Jen ordered the coconut-peanut veggie wrap. I didn't taste that one. She said it was delicious. Because she'd eaten the soup, she couldn't finish her wrap and ended up taking half of it with her. We both had coffee to drink. It was fine. I only put a little sweetener in mine, and she only put in cream, and we were both happy.  The one thing I would complain about is the service. Now, mind you, I worked in restaurants and catering for 20 years; I've worked customer service, and even now, I work in an industry where customer service is vitally important. The waiter had the flattest affect I've seen in a long time. No smile, no ""welcome"" or any kind of warmth. We might have been dealing with an automat. I cannot stress enough how important it is to least smile, show some warmth, even -- especially -- if you don't feel it. Fake it till you make it. He did the job adequately, but coldly. Sorry, but that isn't the way I work, and I don't think that's the way serving staff should work. Would we go back to Victory's Banner? Absolutely.

2015-03-05,2.0,"This review is for the horrid service we experienced a few weeks ago when we went to Victory's Banner for breakfast on a weekday. The food was honestly forgettable, I can't even remember what I had. My husband had some sort of scramble which he said was okay. Perhaps our server was having an ""off"" day (as a former server, I know that these days can happen and sometimes you take it out on your tables) but she was nothing but flat-out rude from the get-go. My husband had a few substitutions he wanted for his dish, and as he was explaining this to the server she held her finger up in his face and said brusquely ""uh, can you GIVE me a minute?"" and scribbled on her pad. These were not complicated subs. It was one ingredient substitution and one ingredient he didn't want. This was nothing out of the ordinary, and nowhere on the menu do they say ""no substitutions."" So, we place our order but I was just completely soured on this woman. For a place that's trying to send across a peaceful, Zen-like vibe, this woman was whatever the opposite of that vibe is. She then proceeded to disappear for about 20 minutes, during which our food was sitting up on the counter under the heat lamps. We were this close to getting up and just getting the damn food ourselves instead of waiting for this woman to reappear. Reappear she did, eventually, reeking of cigarettes, and dropped our food off. No apologies, no asking if we needed anything else, just dropped the food at the table and walked away.  I try to make it a practice to give each server I encounter the benefit of the doubt, particularly if it's clearly slammed in the restaurant, if the place seems understaffed, or if we have a large party or complicated orders. All these factors tend to rub servers the wrong way or put them in a bad mood. I can even accept neglectful service as long as the server recognizes it eventually, or even gives an explanation. None of these factors were in play, and this woman just ruined what could have been a pleasant experience.",-0.8302,0.813,0.083,0.104,0.5023809523809524

Pancakes with yogurt, fresh raspberry, and homemade granola - perfect pancakes--light, tasty; a good, hearty breakfast. Loved the granola. Omelet: I made my own with spinach and mushrooms. Good omelet. Fabulous breakfast potatoes! Dense & hearty bread served as side; it was good. The same bread also came with the lentil soup. What I tasted and looooved: Breakfast Burrito: A tortilla stuffed with 2 scrambled eggs, mushroom, red onion, red peppers, gouda, black beans and sour cream. Organic salsa & brown rice on the side. I needed more days in Chicago because on my next visit I was going to order my very own Breakfast Burrito. I had tasted it on one occasion, then shared about 1/3 of one on another visit. They are big and delicious...not salty, you can taste the individual ingredients.

Do not bring the upma to a porridge consistency, it has to be of a consistency that allows it to be moulded (look up how it is served on google) 3. Please add salt, a little more salt will not kill the dish.  Please stop making it like it's something you'd serve to someone who doesn't care about how it looks, tastes and feels.

I think what I liked most about brunching here is the atmosphere. So calm, relaxing, zen like. I didn't feel rushed, there's no pressure to do a mimosa or bloody, just enjoy a mature Sunday meal with friends.  The inside is pretty small but a table for two was only a 20 minute wait or so. It looks like they have outdoor seating if Mother Nature ever blesses us with sun again. The menu is pretty long, almost overwhelming, but also humorous how they will have things with bacon and sausage even though its all soy products. Side note: ordered the soy bacon and was pleasantly surprised! How do they make it taste like bacon? Is there some sort of bacon seasoning I don't know about.  I had their staple ""Satisfaction-Promise"". It was relatively hearty, served with toast and hash browns. The eggs looked like baby food but tasted really great - the pesto and feta stood out as the champion ingredients.

They were busy but there were one or two small open tables and a party in front of us waiting to be seated. No one took our name or even said hello. The party in front of us asked one of the waitstaff a questions and she replied (not sure what the question was) and then walked past me complaining about the customer to me and rolling her eyes. After that party was seated no one came back to acknowledge me or inquire about how many were in my party etc. even though there was a 3 waitresses working right behind the front counter refilling water jugs! I kept making eye contact with one of them and she was just ignoring me. Finally someone came to say there was only a small table next to the wall but a bigger table was just about to leave and if we wanted to wait we could have that table. So we waited another 15 mins (we have now been there over 25 mins) and just as the table we were waiting for was being cleaned off another party of 3 walked in and the hostess seated them at our table! I told the hostess/waitress/water jug re-filler we were leaving and walked out. We wasted nearly 30 minutes in total!

2014-02-26,4.0,"I was looking for a place for our last breakfast in Chicago before heading home and was more than intrigued by the reviews on Victory's Banner. I am by no means a vegetarian, but the idea of having breakfast listening to a sitar served by a waitress in a sari sounded indeed like a great idea. As I'm following the GPS' directions, I kept wondering if I had the right address because it looked like we were in a residential area but as we got to the address, we saw the blue awning and the yellow cursive-written name on it.  We found a free parking space which was flabbergasting considering the previous parking adventures. It was still quite early and this might have explained that. We were warmly greeted by a young woman wearing a sari. There were just a couple of tables were occupied so we were able to choose one of our liking. While waiting for someone to take our order, a young man came and dropped a book and a couple of toys next to my son. He introduced himself as Bobby and was really friendly and interested by our family's origins. (My wife is from Trinidad and from Indian descent).  The menu was pretty varied but I went for a sausage and Gouda omelet. My son went for the pancakes and a side order of sausage, my daughter for the chocolate chip waffle but my wife went for the Uppama. According to the menu, it's ""a savory hot cereal with peas, tomatoes and onions, served with coconut chutney and yogurt."" The kids and I got our food pretty quickly but the Uppama was taking time and it so happened that with Bobby's interest in our family, he forgot to put in the order. When he realized what had happened, he came to apologize and said it would be on the house to make up for his mistake. It was finally served and it was most interesting but the chutney was absolutely delicious. My son did not like his sausage and we found out afterwards that it wasn't meat but a veggie-based sausage (of course!) .  The place filled up pretty quickly a sign that the place was worthy of its reputation and there was a line already building up at the door. As we were getting ready to leave, Bobby came with a bag and apologized for being busy and for not having the time to come and wish me a proper happy birthday so he put a muffin and a candle in a bag. It was a nice and unexpected gesture. Although they said the Uppama would not be charged to our bill, it was. I guess the information was not properly relayed but we didn't ask for it in the first place so we were fine with the omission. The staff was really top notch, prices under $10/person and great food.

The side potatoes are great, and pretty flavorful. My friend had the french toast and I really liked it. I liked the orange butter that comes with it, and the maple syrup. I wish I had gotten that, but I was in the mood for something a little more savory. Her boyfriend got the cinnamon bun french toast or something like that? It was sort of like a french toast cinnabun and it was very good. I would definitely eat here again, were it not for the wait.

My vegan friend had the vegan french toast. Unlike most vegan french toasts (see Chicago Diner), it wasn't hard and crispy. Instead, it was thick and almost eggy in texture. It saved from being cloying because the sweet was cut with cardamom and cinnamon. Probably the best vegan french toast I've had. He also had the veganized Eggless Wonder.

While this is not a place to go in large groups, it's a perfect spot for a catch up with one or two friends.  Being vegetarian, I love that I can eat the whole menu. There is nothing worse than being limited to one or two items. There are many vegan substitutes available as well! The scrambles here are very good, especially if you opt to make your own - you'll always get exactly what you want! I would HIGHLY recommend the french toast with the fresh raspberries. I would vote it as the best french toast I have ever had. The fruit is all extremely ripe and juicy. They also make their own bread so if you order the french toast or even just regular toast, it will taste much better than most places' store bought loaf.  Parking here is a bit difficult because there are tons of popular restaurants located nearby. On a nice day, definitely talk a walk over to Roscoe or take the train because the neighborhood is a great one to wander around in.  Be prepared to wait during normal busy breakfast times: late morning and weekends. Since they usually don't serve big groups, the table turnover is pretty good. Also, the tables are very close together so when it is crowded, do not expect to have an intimate date.

Big turn off. - There is no organization with the wait staff. There seemed to be no designated host/hostess and our table did not have a designated waiter. Every single staff person there helped us at some point, which means we did not know who to call on and we were sometimes neglected. Management needs to step in and organize the staff. - The food was the most disappointing part of the experience. Veggie delight omelet had few veggies and no taste except for the cheese that we added to it. The grilled potatoes were undercooked and not flavorful....sadly, these may be the worst grilled potatoes I have ever had and they should be so easy to make.

Victory Banner is known for their award-winning French toast made with a soft bread that's like challah, and served with vegan peach butter. It's truly delicious. I also enjoy their mango lassi even if it's a little pricey (over $3). HOWEVER, I was disappointed to find that my clothes smelled like cooking oil from the restaurant. They need a better ventilation system, and it's embarrassing to have to go home and change clothes because I seriously reeked of oil.

VB is very charming, with nice pastel colors which brightened up my mood on the cold, rainy day. The restaurant seems to be dedicated to Sri Chinmoy, an Indian spiritual teacher. But, I wouldn't say it's culty like the Loving Hut chains are.  They feed you coffee, juice or water while you wait, which is a very good thing. There certainly isn't much room when you walk in, and I felt bad for the table we were practically standing on top of. They hold about 45 people, so while not tiny, it's not a large room either. When we were finally seated, everything moved really quickly. Orders were taken, and food came out in about 10 minutes. We ordered the french toast, the omelet special of spinach and artichoke, and an egg-white omelet with spinach, soy bacon, and cheddar. They used gouda instead of cheddar, I didn't complain, but it's not my favorite cheese. The french toast was outstanding, the omelets were ok. The lunch menu looked really interesting and flavorful, I'll be back soon to try that.

The staff is quite friendly and the owner always makes me feel welcome and happy to be there. Although I am vegetarian, my wife and friends that we go with are not. We all have an enjoyable time and greatly enjoy the food. I tend to drive the owner a bit crazy, because I almost always order the same thing. The eggless wonder is my favorite. I 'veganize' it by requesting no cheese, but with salsa mixed in. It is absolutely delicious! I enjoy it so much that I rarely want to order any other dish. Nonetheless, my wife generally orders either the signature french toast or an egg dish. Although the peach butter doesn't generally come with all dishes, my wife requests it with her toast because it is so good. Beyond the good food, many of the staff are on a spiritual path, which is reflected in their joy of preparing and serving such good food.  Getting to know the owner is a pleasure. He is a man of many talents. He once diagnosed my gout correctly after talking to me for one minute, after four doctors in an emergency room failed to do so. (He is a non-practicing chiropractor.) He also has a grand sense of humor, but I will leave it at that. In summary, good food, warm surroundings,  wonderful experience.",0.9967,0.688,0.26,0.051,0.5768817204301075

Do we want to wait in the lines and more importantly - is it WORTH the wait? Well, there are several places in this city that offer a great brunch and most of them considered great for different reasons (Great Bloody Mary's, Amazing Pancakes, Love their Coffee, Eggs are perfect). On our list for a little while now was Victory's Banner. Why?  Because it's unique in that it's vegan/vegetarian and their breakfast menu is FULL of options. We walked right in their open door and automatically - you feel good.  The walls are blue and yellow-very inviting and peaceful.  The owner came up to us immediately - was incredibly friendly- wiped down a table for us and led us to our seats. What to get from a Vegan/Vegetarian place? After much consideration - I landed on the ""Healthy Scramble"" which was scrambled eggs- your choice of 2 veggies mixed in w/ it along with tofu, brown rice, and bread. It was AMAZING!  It had great flavors, everything was cooked to perfection, the brown rice was even good.  The bread is baked right there as well - and it's nice and soft - full of oats/bran as well. My husband got the Satisfaction Promise I believe which was scrambled eggs, feta cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, potatoes, and bread.   Naturally, I tried his as well and it was also amazing. I can't say enough good things about this place because the best part about this brunch is the fact that you leave - not so full you need to hit the couch afterwards - but you can continue on with your day satisfied and still able to eat the rest of the day.  It's not greasy or anything - it really is great.

Today I had my normal hot Chai.  If you'd never had it or just want to try something different, get it instead of the usual coffee.  Don't get me wrong, their coffee is good too...  but that Chai!   I would probably go there just for that. Every week they have a special omelet and a special french toast.  Normally I get the Veggie Delight omelet and add smoked Gouda but today I decided to get the special.  It was a Jalapeno-Havarti Omelet.  It was fresh spinach, tomato and jalapenos with a jalapeno-havarti cheese.  How could I resist it!  Melty cheese with just the right amount of heat.  The occasional burst of a fresh tomato and the zing of a fresh jalapeno chunk.  If they had this on the menu every day, I would probably have to alternate from my normal omelet every other visit.  All the omelets are served with this really great crunchy on the outside soft on the inside warm hearth bread and some grilled potatoes.  I think that part of the reason I don't order something different is that I want that bread too!  The best is when my boyfriend gets the french toast that comes with peach butter.  I steal the butter and put it on the bread.  YUM!   No butter today though.  He ordered the special french toast.  It was Orange Pecan French Toast.  Hmmm...  It had a mascapone cream between the slices of thick bread that had an orangy flavor (you could see little bits of zest) and was topped with come candied pecans.  Delicious!  He added syrup but I could have eaten it just as it came. Now, if you go on a weekend, expect to wait!  I'm warning you.  If you come after 10am on Sunday you could wait 2 hours!  But it's so worth it.  We try to go earlier or on Saturday because I just can't wait that long for breakfast.  With the addition of the patio seating, the wait seems to be a bit better but it's still a tiny place so please don't say I didn't warn you.",0.9963,0.801,0.173,0.026,0.48983942414174986

If you're into that kind of thing, this is the place for you. If you're not, you might still enjoy the egg scrambles, omelletes and other breakfast items.

My Satisfaction Promise (the most popular egg dish on the menu) was very tasty: all fresh ingredients, tons of goat cheese, very flavorfull.

The chai latte was also tasty (a little too sweet for me) and their tea selection was pretty extensive. Finally, I loved the decor and the staff's outfits, but I found our server a little.. ugh, un-charming. We were super nice to her and courtious (which should always be the norm) but her response made me feel like she didn't really want to be there. So much for being zen, huh? I'd say 4 stars food, 3 stars service. If you live nearby, you should absolutely come for breakfast though. I don't know that I would return for lunch, but a nice Saturday/Sunday brunch here is enjoyable.

2011-04-29,4.0,"I've been here a couple times, and have been very pleased with my experiences.  They have a spiritual theme, and even a little bookstore type area to buy stuff.  I remember the breakfast that I had here the first time as being really outstanding.  We had the pesto and goat cheese scramble and one of the sweet items (can't remember if it was pancakes or french toast) as well as the house chai, which was a little too milky and not chai-y enough for my tastes.  But the food was really good.  The second time I came here was around lunch time and we both got veggie burgers.  They were good, but not totally up to par for a place that is all vegetarian and should be committed to the highest quality of veggie burger.  The patties were mushy and fell apart when you tried to eat them.  The flavors were good, but it was hard to eat, and just kinda weird. Mango lassi was yum yum! Anyway, I like this place.  I like their vibe, and I can forgive them a mushy veggie burger and bland chai.",0.974,0.836,0.148,0.016,0.5539215686274509

You could smell the yumminess in the air as it was making the wait worth while. Once we were seated, we all were offered a glass of their freshly squeezed orange juice. Really good! Looking at the menu, we were all overwhelmed by all the great selections. I decided to go with the Award Winning French toast that comes with peach butter. This was some of the best French toast I have ever tasted. I also ordered a side of scrambled egg whites with goat cheese along with a side of grilled potatoes.This was one of those moments where I wanted to scream due to the greatness of my meal. One of my peeps got the Curry Omelet. I gave it a taste and it was pretty damn good! Curry and eggs didn't sound like a good idea to me, but this definitely changed my mind. There was also a Carribean Egg meal which was on the specialty menu....Very delicious. The Raspberry & Lime French Toast is a force to be reckoned with as well.

This manifests itself mainly in the semi-monastic dress of the staff and the vibrant artwork on the walls and tables.  The food is consistently good, with vegetarian and vegan versions of standard American breakfast dishes (scrambles, omelettes, pancakes, and their signature French toast), a number of South Asian dishes (uppma, chai), and an excellent selection of veggie burgers. Their various meat substitutes (veggie burger, soy sausage, soy bacon) are far better than the average vegetarian restaurant. Each week they also offer a special egg dish and a special French toast or pancake variation as well. We usually order a side of their tamari-mayo sauce as a condiment for the hash browned potatoes.

My friend & I got there at about 12:45 on Sunday and there were at least 20 people waiting (and since the restaurant only holds about 40 people that was a big line). We'd figured we'd miss the brunch crowd by going at that time but I'm thinking this place is busy from the moment they open until the moment they close. Luckily it was a bright, sunny day and they have chairs outside so we gave our name and plopped down in the sun to wait the estimated 45 minutes they told us it would be.  They are pretty organized with the list, although I did notice the lady workin that day messed up a couple of times. She said we were ahead of one group, but then called them in first. And then she came out to say we'd be next, but when we went in to wait, she called out a different name a couple of minutes later. I did ask if she had actually meant us and she had, so we were seated. Not a big deal, but when you are starving like we were, and had already waited 45 minutes, having to wait 10 or 20 more minutes to get seated was not an option!! So I would just note the name ahead of you when you get on the list so you can know when you are up next.  My friend & I both ended up ordering the southwest burger (I did the vegan option since I'm dabbling in going vegan at the moment). And that burger was freakin delicious!! I usually find veggie burgers somewhat unispired but this was a unique mix of grains & veggies, topped with mushrooms, tomato & greens and some special seasoning. (The non-vegan option also had cheese & mayo - and my friend said the mayo was yummy.) The burger was just tasty and unlike any veggie burger I've gotten at restaurants before.  I was very pleasantly surprised by the number of items that can be made vegan and based on my first experience, I'm excited to go back and try out some more. As others have said they do have a separate vegan menu, but the regular menu also notes what can be made vegan. But don't be turned off if you don't want to do vegan, the entire menu is vegetarian and has a great mix of breakfast times and lunch options. Pretty much everything sounded appealing to me!!

Its surface-level charm has misled me too many times, forcing me to spend too many hours trying to figure out what makes this sweet-looking stretch of shops and bars so special. Take Victory's Banner, for example. Where else in Chicago can you find a cozy, sun-saturated breakfast nook serviced by devotees to an Indian guru? It sounds like a more-than-ideal place to christen the weekend, and yet its brilliance is limited by the simplicity of its overpriced, mediocre menu. Take the Steverino, for example. It's a petite omelet of caramelized onions and red bell peppers nestling creamy waves of goat cheese. It's good -- not great. The breakfast potatoes are flavored only by the grease they were sautéed in. The hearth bread, while satisfying, lacked a noteworthy flavor or texture. All this, for the double-take-worthy price of $9.75. I think the problem with Victory's Banner, like so many of the other venues in Roscoe Village, is a credibility issue. Where is the ""authenticity"" here? Aside from the uppama, nothing about the food I am being served is representative of Sri Chinmoy or the life of a devotee. Granted, it's likely that the crowds that typically rush to brunch here would be no more if the menu was anything more than basic, non-meat, American-style breakfast. But still -- for the price, I would rather see the background narrative on the menu, too.",0.9344,0.848,0.105,0.047,0.5440476190476191
2010-09-17,4.0,If you are afraid of going to a vegetarian restaurant (read: you're a carnivore) then you are in for a treat.  I generally feel that any meal lacking meat is no meal at all.  Suffice it to say that Victory's Banner changed this perception.   Order any number of dishes with soyrizo (soy chorizo) and you will be amazed.  The coffee is great.  I love having a side of black beans and rice as well as salsa to top off my soyrizo burrito.   You cannot go wrong by enjoying a meal here.,0.9689,0.729,0.25,0.022,0.6479166666666667

I do miss the smell of bacon and sausage when entering breakfast joints but I soon forget it as I enjoy the good coffee and see fresh cut flowers upon each table. The highlights for me at this place is the awesome french toast, delicious oatmeal made with milk instead of water, and the many extra ingredient choices offered to build your omelet. Just recently I tried a dish called Upama, its a cream of wheat type hot cereal with peas, tomatoes and onions, served with a sweet coconut chutney and yogurt. Sounds gross or odd but I was amazed how savory and delicious it was. Im thinking of asking them to put an egg on top of it next time.

Although it is a vegetarian spot, Victory's has something for everyone. In addition, the wait staff are always friendly and polite and the service is quick. I've never felt that the wait staff were trying to rush me through my meal; instead, they offer constant refills on coffee and chai, and other than that they don't interfere (a quality I appreciate). I recommend: -The French toast with peach butter... so delicious!!! The bread is super thick, but also very light, and the peach butter adds an amazing and unique flavor. It doesn't have the fried taste of diner french toast.  -Omelettes: The only one I've had that I didn't like was the bacon/tomato/cheese--the soy bacon just didn't do it for me, and the tomatoes were a little watery. The gouda and soy sausage is my favorite (creamy and full of flavor, perfect balance of cheese/egg/""meat""), although i also really enjoy the pesto and goat cheese. I usually request a side of fruit in place of the potatoes--in my opinion they're not worth the extra calories, and they don't charge extra. The hearth bread, on the other hand, is amazing, especially when served warm. -AMAZING chai, hot or cold. Please get one!

This Saturday happens to be the day after my birthday, so I've got my two best friends in tow, and all three of us look like the ""after"" shots from a photo special about meth (because of our hangovers, not because we do meth).  So we amble down from my apartment into Roscoe Village in search of this restaurant Jessica said to meet her at called Thor's Hammer or something, squinting and blinking and making ocean deep conversation like,  ""Did you see that dog?"" ""Yeah, I like dogs."" ""That chick was hot too."" ""I know."" ""You should get a dog."" ""I have a pitbull.  You should get a chick."" ""Snap."" (We're all basically hunky scientists with huge brains.) So we find the place, and it's called Victory's Banner and everyone's like, ""Well LA DI DA, FANCYPANTS,"" because really?  Victory's Banner?  A little highfaluting, don't you think?  Still, we're starving, so we sit on the bench out front and wait for Jessica, who is perpetually 35 minutes late to basic social events like brunch but can make it to a soundcheck 20 minutes early. While on this bench, reading the many little flyers and signs posted in the window, it occurs to us that something is amiss. ""Is this place fucking VEGETARIAN?"" ""Oh, damn it, come on!  We've been walking for 15 minutes!  The Dinner/Diner Grill was right across the street."" ""Oh, cool."" (That was Colin.  He's a vegetarian.) When Jessica rolls up in her Transitions lenses and funeral garb, pale as Death with bright red lipstick, we start in on the Wet Hot American Summer Paul Rudd foot scuff, whine and pout routine but she's not having it, insisting that it will be delicious and rambling on about peach butter, and Mike and I are just shaking our heads thinking about all the horrid fake sausage we're going to mechanically gnaw while trying not to strangle her. I myself was already trying not to strangle her because our initial hello went something like,  ""Are those Transitions lenses?  Jesus.  You look dead.  What did you do last night?"" ""Oh, I went to this Peaches show, and it was awesome.  You look like shit.  What did YOU do?"" ""Oh, you know, it was my birthday so all of my friends came in form out of state and we had that party I invited you to."" ""..."" Etc. So we went inside. Well, it turns out that aside from being the most bizarre, let's-all-wear-robes-and-probably-worship-Kali-or-whatever cult center in Roscoe Village, Victory's Banner actually manages to pull off that most unlikely of feats and make everything on their rather impressive menu taste not only not vegetarian but basically delicious.  We tore through French toast, Greek salad, several egg scrambles with various proportions of goat cheese and spinach and peppers, a pound of Jessica's coveted peach butter, faux breakfast meats and assorted beverages, and every bite was worth commenting upon. We didn't comment upon them, because between the four of us we had about six working brain cells and spent two hours making the worst jokes imaginable and kind of drooling a little.  I'm kidding again.  We're like, the funniest people alive and it was JOKESx15 up in the V.B. but I've actually entertained the thought of returning several times, lured, against all of my better judgement and bone-deep disdain for vegetarians, by their absolutely delicious foodstuffs. So if you're a vegetarian ... well, eat bacon.  But also, here's your new home.

I have been going here for the last few years and it is such a wonderful restaurant to have in Roscoe Village. On weekends it can get pretty busy but during the week or later in the early afternoon there is hardly ever a wait which is wonderful considering the restaurant is pretty small.  Some of my favorites here are the stuffed french toast specials they have once in a while or for that matter, any of their french toast on the menu! I also like the pancakes, especially the apple pecan pancakes! And if your a vegetarian that eats eggs, the omelets never disappoint with as many varieties of fresh vegetables you can think of and yummy grilled potatoes.  Victory's Banner is great for lunch too. They have a very affordable peasants lunch of soup and hearty bread that never disappoints but if your in the mood for a more filling lunch, the veggie burgers are the best in town! The southwest bliss burger is my personal favorite but if you're a veggie who misses bacon, get the soy bacon burger! The burger come with mashed potatoes and homemade mushroom gravy that could be a meal in itself! They also have a great curry wrap and even neatloaf, which I have never had, but am always tempted by!  The staff here is wonderful and attentive. Your coffee cup will never go dry! The owner and every employee practice meditation under the late Yogi Sri Chinmoy and every employee wears beautiful sari's. It's an eclectic and wonderful experience.

2009-05-04,4.0,"My 100th review! I've been saving it for something special.  Here goes: One rainy Sunday a couple weeks ago the boyfriend and I decided on a whim to go to breakfast. I'm a big fan of going to breakfast rather than dinner. First of all, I love breakfast foods and think they should be served all day. Second, breakfast is just so much cheaper (even at nicer places) than dinner.  Anyway, we were trying to decide where to go and he asks ""do you want to have breakfast at a place run by a cult?"" I scrunched my nose and narrowed my eyes. ""A cult..?"" I am not religious and am generally opposed to any kind of group that centers around a 'life philosophy'. My skepticism was written all over my face. He assured me they weren't ""those kind of people"".  So off we went in the slightly warm, heavy air that always proceeds a good rain.  We arrived and it was pouring, and my umbrella had broken in the wind (yet again), but I was thankful to find shelter under a tent outside Victory's Banner. The wait was about 45 minutes and a chill had settled in the air, but at least we were staying mostly dry.  When we were eventually seated at the back of the restaurant I was pleased with the light decor of the space and the general warmth. I got a coffee to warm my hands and surveyed the menu.  Let me tell you, everything looked good. I didn't even realize we were in a vegetarian place until boyfriend pointed it out. And honestly, it wouldn't have come up if he hadn't. I was so in love with the idea of fresh eggs, smoked Gouda, and mushrooms that I never would have ordered meat. The potatoes on the side were delicious and the bread was warm and soft.  If you're the kind of person who thinks breakfast isn't complete without bacon and sausage, this probably isn't the spot for you. But if you're just looking for great ingredients and delicious eats, you'll do well here. And I wouldn't spend too much time worrying about their group or organization or whatever you want to call it. They're happy to serve you without judgment, so you should probably reserve yours when you choose to enter their establishment. Besides, they seem like perfectly nice people who promote happiness through food; what's not to like about that?",0.9981,0.773,0.21,0.017,0.5487773487773486

I got pancakes and eggs, and while the pancakes were a little overcooked for my liking (and whole wheat -- I prefer buttermilk), as were the eggs, it was still OK and definitely edible. My friend got a smoked gouda and ""sausage"" omelette -- the eggs and gouda part were fine, but the soy sausage had absolutely no taste whatsoever -- kinda gross. The whole atmosphere is kind of interesting. Bright blue walls, waitresses wearing their spiritual gowns. It creates a serene feel (when it's not packed, which happens I guess happens often), but a little out there as well. Prices weren't the cheapest for a breakfast, but not overly expensive either.

We got there a little before 11 and the wait was only 20 minutes.  I liked that they had benches outside you could sit on while you waited for your table, and since it was a nice day we soaked up the sun and watched her daughter practice walking up and down the sidewalk. When they called our name we were brought inside, and they had little stuffed animals on the table in front of the high chair for my friend's daughter.  I thought it was a nice touch, even though we didn't let her have them for sanitary issues. Our waiter was absolutely fantastic.  He was so nice to us, and he hammed it up for the baby and walked around the restaurant playing peekaboo with her, which kept her occupied.  Since she is at the age where she needs to be entertained 24/7 it was nice because it gave my friend and I a chance to chat and catch up. Our food came out fast - I ordered the french toast that I had heard so much about and some eggs.  My friend had an omlette which she said was delicious, but my french toast wasn't great.  It was very soggy and mushy and just didn't taste very good, so I barely ate any of it.  My eggs were decent - I've had better, but they were nothing to write home about. Everything was pretty cheap - for the two of us the bill was only $19 which I thought was great. So, overall I think that this is a great place and it's very kid friendly which is a bonus.  Since everyone raves about the french toast it leads me to believe I just got a bad plate of it, which can happen at any restaurant, so I may give them another chance if I'm in the neighborhood.",0.9631,0.815,0.128,0.057,0.5557834757834758

The banana walnut oat bran pancakes are INCREDIBLE: the perfect combination of grainy, fruity, and crunchy. The Brahma burrito is great too, and plenty for lunch--I could have taken the other half home for later, but it was just too tasty to even dream of waiting to eat it. I'm not sure that it still does, but Victory's Banner once doubled as a meditation center--I like its aura, its calmness, and you might check out the spiritual messages on the sugar packets. Freely loving others is a nice touch as you sip your morning coffee.

My one complaint, naturally, is that this restaurant doesn't take reservations. I have never waited for less than 30 minutes for a table, and that's a bit of a nuisance. Especially considering I've been there at all times during their operating hours; it doesn't seem to matter when you go. Aside from that? The coffee is always hot and rich, and you never have to search for a tiny pitcher of cream or a stocked sugar caddy. I hear wonderful things about their chai lattes, too. The orange juice is fresh squeezed and perfectly sweet. I had the French toast with peach butter the first time I went, and that taste alone actually evaporated all doubts I had about whether Chicago was for me. Pair it with the breakfast potatoes, and you can consider me a Windy City lifer. Since I moved here, I've turned to the Satisfaction Promise, an egg dish with pesto, feta cheese, sun-dried tomatos and fresh spinach. I never order eggs in restaurants because they sketch me out, but somehow I trust it when it comes from these quiet, gentle people in breezy saris or matching polos and white pants.

2007-01-16,5.0,"One of my favorite breakfast/brunch spots in the city.  Service is consistently high quality and friendly to boot.  I've never been disappointed in the quality of the food either.  I'm a carnivore, but I don't mind passing up on the meats while I'm here.  Everyone who I've brought to this spot has agreed that it was not only delicious, but that they did not miss the meat.  The atmosphere, even when busy and hectic, is still relaxed and peaceful.  I've never felt rushed by the service, no matter how busy they were.  The omelettes are fluffy and hearty, the soups and bread are fresh, and the french toast with the peach butter is obnoxiously good.  Yes it gets tight in there on the weekends, and the wait can be pretty long... but its definitely worth it.  If you end up having to wait, walk around the neighborhood for a bit.  There's plenty to see on Roscoe and Belmont.  The secret to this place, however, is to skip the Sat/Sun brunch rush, and head over during the weekday.  I've never had a wait Mon-Fri, and the food and service are just as good, if not better.  I also notice that some people commented on the whole ""cult"" thing, and their followings of the teachings of Sri Chinmoy... I guess my response to that is this:  They have never proselytized to me, they've never made me feel uncomfortable, and even though his literature is available and videos run in the background (on mute), I've never been asked to take a pamphlet with me, or watch the videos.  They don't mock others for kneeling to Christ or bowing to Mohammad... so come on folks, don't mock them for not fitting inside your narrow scope of what religion is, or should be.  If it makes you uncomfortable, then don't go... but don't be disrespectful either.",0.9753,0.8,0.14,0.06,0.5644505494505494

However, we have yet to have a bad meal from there, but we feel that there are much better places in the city to get breakfast/brunch. Their # is (773) 665-0227.

2006-12-06,5.0,"I'm embarrassed to say that the first time I heard someone describe Victory's Banner, I dismissed it like I would a chick-flick. And I was so wrong! (But I'll never admit I'm wrong about chick-flicks. Example - The Notebook, etc.) How can breakfast without real bacon or sausage or something that was alive and moving at some point in time taste good? The novelty of this place is that you never ever realize that there's no meat. If someone had not bothered to tell me I was consuming faux-meat, I probably wouldn't known.  The flavors are outstanding and the ""Satisfaction Promise"" eggs on the menu really deliver. I've also enjoyed the various omelets and the burrito. All of them are top-notch and the coffee is just right (seriously, there are too many places that do a really good job screwing up coffee). The pancakes are solid, although I'm not quite a pancakey person. The elephant in the room continues to be the staff dressed in indian garb but not one of them actually being indian. Since we're a secular and mostly libertarian nation, it's more amusing than anything else and something you get used to over time. On a beautiful sunny day in Spring/Fall, when its cold in the shade but just warm enough in the sun, sitting outside at Victory's Banner brings back the memories that money can't buy.   ... actually, wait - money can buy this kinda happiness at very reasonable prices.",0.981,0.801,0.156,0.043,0.5324384236453201

I do have to admit that it's a little hit or miss.  I've never had anything bad here, but not everything is incredibly delicious.  Most of it I would rate as ""good.""  One example would be the pancakes.  You can get them with different fruits like raspberries or apples.  I thought that they were sort of dry.  But my friends all love them.

The decor is really bright, service is odd - the woman who I guess owns the place (she wears the Indian sari) is nice and polite but I found other young gentlemen servers to be unfriendly and unhelpful.
