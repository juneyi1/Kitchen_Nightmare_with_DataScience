We explained the whole situation to the man on the phone and asked them to send the guy back with our samosa, as we only live three blocks away.  The man on the phone flat out told me no.  I asked him if the cost of one samosa was worth all of our business and by repeating that he would not give us our samosa tonight, basically said yes.  So,  if our business is worth so little to them,  we will never be calling them again.  We have never been anything but appreciative and kind.  I don't think it's too much to ask in return.",0.9811,0.804,0.164,0.032,0.3992979242979243

This place emits aroma that are so attractive that I simply could not just ignore my desire to try out this place. And I am glad I did. Despite the menacing 80 degree weather that day, I took my girlfriend to try out this place, knowing that most Indian dishes tends to pack a lot of heat..be it temperature or just spicy level. We were quickly seated and was greeted by a very chill waiter, who seems to be the only one handling the business around the restaurant side of things (front end that is). We decided to try a few things to test the water. We ordered a samosa and a chicken puff pastry to start our meal. The samosa was great, but the chicken puff pastry is just a step above. The pastry is almost like a very very soft croissant but with chicken at its core. Definitely a refreshing experience.  As our main dish, my girlfriend got some kind of vegetable based curry while i opted for goats feet (i am a sucker for joint meat). For both dishes, the flavors were super strong, in a good way (As expected of Indian cuisine). I found myself quickly devoured what was in front of us and find ourselves in a very satisfied state.

The place is a restaurant combined with a grocery store so it's not the most appealing for dining. But since I've had success with these types of setups, I wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt. I ordered several plates with my cousins. When it came out, the food looked nothing like the pictures and the portions were small. Most importantly, the food was not good. The butter chicken did not appear or have a butter consistency. It looked like red, non-homogenized water with chicken in it. Appalling to the eye. As far as portion to price ratio, it was overpriced. In the end, I paid too much for subpar food.  The server here was very nice, which is why I decided to keep the three stars.

It was cooked with onions and bell peppers, which were all but cooked away, clearly lended a great flavor to the dish. Not to mention they must have used a bunch of other spices and aromatics. The Pakora Curry, and the other hand, was not good. Its sauce looked flavorful with a nice yellow hue to it, but it was bland and ridiculously oily. The vegetables were two big ""meatballs"" of different vegetables melded together in a heavy deep fry batter. Just awful.  Their naan is terrible. Nothing more than an oily, dense piece of bread that is obnoxiously difficult to chew.  I have mixed feelings about the Paratha Omelet. I've never heard of serving a sheet of scrambled egg with bits of onion and bell pepper in it (their idea of an omelet) on top of a Paratha. It was good! I particularly like the egg part, as I'm a huge fan of scrambled egg... And this wasn't greasy at all. But the paratha base was not as good as I've had elsewhere. It was too dense and lacked the crisp edges and flaky center.  Samosa was out of this world good! Wonderfully crisp, flaky exterior, and a great potato filled center that was bursting with flavor!

I hopped back on Google and low and behold, I found Shan Foods, who didnt close until late. I immediately tossed (literally) the rest of my groceries in the car and flew down the street! They were very much so open!!! I decided to take a risk. Upon walking to the door,  I saw that they actually dont close until 12:30am. YES!!! I went in, grabbed a menu, and ordered Chicken Makhani, rice, and naan. The Chicken Makhani is essentially the same as Butter Chicken. The flavors complimented the chicken so well and the spice was just right. The side of rice was enough to feed a small village, but cooked perfectly. The naan was baked thicker than others that I have had, but it was great for dipping into the Makhani with. The guys behind the counter were very nice and we engaged in conversation as I waited for my food, which ended with them tossing in a free samosa and kheema (if Im not mistaken). Both delish! My order was fresh and ready to go in about 15 minutes. Shan's is definitely a place to grab a bite to eat for lunch if you work in the area or are heading home and have a taste for some good Indian.

At first I thought I would overlook that until I opened it up.  Everything was totally disgusting the Samosa was so greasy that the bag was soaked in grease.  The Chicken Biryani was horrible.  It looked like they added newer rice on top of old rice and the chicken tasted terrible.  And the Aaloo Mutter Gajar was so greasy too and dark like it had been sitting a pot forever.  And the Nan was kind of cheap pita bread.

2013-03-04,4.0,"I am infamous for craving Indian food out of no where.  While driving...working...sleep-walking...  When I'm not near Devon, I sample out all different Indian joints close to home.  Shan Restaurant was a newly discovered place, thanks to Yelp.  In a strip mall, next to Shan Foods, is Shan Restaurant...  It is these sort of ""hole-in-the-wall"" places (even though you can follow your nose to the mix of scrumptious aromas), which require some investigation, but provide good results.   I picked up my food after submitting online.  I realized you enter through the shop, not the restaurant, and your food is there waiting.  When I got home and opened up my bags, I noticed my two samosas I had paid for were missing. *Sad face*  After unpacking the three plastic bags keeping in all the warmth, the Butter Chicken was somewhat shredded and braised, versus soaking in the sauce I'm use to.  Our Chicken Biryani was very tasty with large chunks of chicken amongst the rice, however, I wasn't a fan of all the hidden bones.  The vegetable dish, Aaloo Mutter Gajar, was very delicious with potatoes and carrots that melted in our mouths.  The naan was much thicker than seen in the past but delicious.  All of the items were extremely spicy, even though I ordered requesting ""mild spice.""  I'm thinking that the food may have been Pakistani versus Indian as I'm more accustomed to.  All in all, everything was very tasty and unique if you're looking for a spicy meal. Warning: Their website allows online ordering via a site called Beyond Menu.  They require you to sign up (which deletes your previously compiled menu), you rebuild your order, submit twice with the option to pay in-person or online, and they then e-mail you a receipt.  However, unlike many other food delivery websites, they do not email you with an estimated time of delivery or pick-up.  I had to call to verify my order.  Luckily, Shan said my food was ready, and it only took 10 minutes to prepare and cook!",0.9728,0.88,0.087,0.033,0.5780483405483406

Decided to order the Aaloo Palak (Spinach and potatoes cooked with spices), Lamb Biryani, 2 orders of Naan and the Lamb Curry. Let me start off with the bad...the Lamb Curry was too boney for me.  They used the bone-in pieces and I felt I didn't get enough meat.  This dish would be great if they were using boneless lamb cubes.  Having said that, the meat was amazing in flavor and tender.  More meat in this dish would have gotten this review five stars. The Aaloo Palak was lovely...being a potato fan, I would have loved more in the dish, but again the flavors were amazing.  The Lamb Biryani was out of this world.  Portion was crazy large...definitely big enough for 2.  Again the lamb was tender and flavorful.  I ordered 2 pieces of Naan...that was a mistake as the one pieces was big enough for two...I couldn't finish the whole piece.

2012-10-29,4.0,"I've walked past Shan so many times without knowing exactly what it was or the yummy things hiding behind its unassuming facade!  When you walk by, you'd think it's just another bodega, hidden in a corner strip mall, but Shan is truthfully a hidden gem and should not be ignored. First of all, let's talk about the food.  The menu has plenty of Indian and Pakistani options from your traditional rice dishes to more interesting dishes with hints of Ethiopian influence.  After reading the reviews on yelp, I decided to order a chicken biryani to-go.  It was properly spicy, had delicious boiled chicken in it, and came with a raita-type sauce that added a perfect amount of flavor and wetness to the rice.  The portion was huge, too, and the addicting aromatics even brought my curious roommates in for a bite.  Beyond the cooked food, though, this place has some very interesting imports.  As a celiac who must eat gluten-free, I cook a lot of my own food and thus use a lot of corn, rice and potato flours/starches.  At Whole Foods, the main brands are very expensive.  At Shan, they have imported brands in huge bags and my goodness are they cheap!  Goodbye Whole Foods and Dominicks for $8 a bag... hello Shan for $3 a bag (and it's twice the size!).  Finally, I want to call attention to the friendly service.  The folks behind the counter were very helpful.  The desserts looked delicious, but the staff could not be certain any of them were totally free of wheat and thus did not recommend any for me.  While I would have loved to try some (and I am fairly certain some were gluten-free), I appreciate the caution and care they took for my health. I can't wait to try more things at Shan!! I will certainly be back.  As a word of caution, though, they do not accept credit/debit cards... only the Link card or cash!",0.997,0.762,0.207,0.031,0.6320592020592022

I remember Cyn telling me about this stirp mall where she picks up samosas for potlucks so I was on the quest to find it. Their Uncle Roy was gracious enough to drive us there and try these samosas that were unfamilar even to him.  Shan Restaurant is actually a tiny grocery store with a restaurant inside with a reasonably priced lunch buffet catering mostly to taxi drivers.  Cyn said she found this place due to the big number of cab drivers congregating the premises--so she knew it had to be good. We ordered 20 samosas to go and I was expecting them to pull them out from their heating oven by the cash register but the guy at the register instructed them to make it fresh for me, so we left there with piping hot samosa which were soooooo good!  I'm glad he did this because I was there a week ago and got a couple of samosas which they pulled from the heating oven and they were oil soaked but good.  The freshly made ones were not oily and stayed good even after the 6 hour trip back to Kentucky where Matt and Alex were able to share them with mom and dad to enjoy! While we were waiting for the samosas, we sampled some of their colorful native desserts in their display case as we sat one of the several picnic type tables in the room.  An interesting experience, and one which we enjoyed while watching an international soccer tournament on the t.v. amidst taxi drivers having their meals.

2011-06-28,4.0,"Shan can cook. And I can eat. And boy can I perspire on a summer day chowing down on this wonderful lunch buffet of spicy-licious East Indian and Pakistani fare. The first thing I noticed was the proliferation of Yellow cabs in the parking lot. I think I counted seven. Then entering the store and restaurant, I realize it is not like any other place I've been, and suddenly I could be in a different town or country for that matter. Mind you, it's nothing special in the ambiance department, but that's not why I came. I like this genre of cafe in the grocery store thing which seems to be a uniquely urban phenomenon. The place was fairly busy, and full of families, cabbies and what I surmised to be a cross section of locals, buying lottery tickets, food and drink or sitting at the tables watching sports on TV. Shan offers a very extensive lunch buffet, all-you-can-eat, for $8.95. And considering that the other single entrees are going to run you about $8.00, it makes sense to have the buffet. Vegans and vegetarians will not be disappointed. There are more of these choices than meat choices, yet there was an array of chicken, beef and a one goat liver or lamb kidney dish in the lineup. Since I am sliding more towards vegetarian than I am towards ""organ meat aficionado"" on the food chain, I did not dabble in the lamb or goat items. And I ate a couple of things I had no idea what they were ('cause the sign was missing) but they were decidedly vegetarian. The array of spices and sauces were excellent. The naan was a little disappointing, but what you expect when it sits on a steam table. All the food seemed very fresh and the flavors and level of heat were stimulating to the glands and the tummy. On a takeout basis, you can also get some samosas with vegetables or chicken, some beef patties which look like little burgers, and couple of other items from their appetizer menu. Things which run $1.00 - 2.50 perhaps, and lassi, regular or mango for $2.99, and about one dozen different sweets. So this would be a great place to pick up items for a picnic or lunch at the beach nearby. So if you like East Indian, in a very casual and unique setting, check out the buffet here.

2010-07-17,5.0,"Used to eat here 3 times a week when I lived about a block away. So sad that I've had to move. This is the best Pakistani/Indian food I've had in Chicago. I've eaten everything but the brains and okra, because I don't like brains or okra.  The aaloo gobi is out of this world. Potatoes and cauliflower meld tenderly to near-mush in curry and ghee. I recommend chapati with this one - phenomenal combination. The other potato vegetable dishes (with spinach and with peas and carrots) are also great. I must give the potato another mention, as the aaloo qeema is another one of my favorites. Think Pakistani sloppy joe (curry, ghee, ground beef) with chunks of delightfully soft ptoato. One of these with 2 naan should get 2 people good and full. Chicken qeema is the chicken version of the sloppy joe comparison I just made, but without the potatoes. I think it's safe for me to say I've never enjoyed ground chicken as much as I have with this dish. If you're wanting some of the other chicken dishes, I'd steer you toward the tandoori or grilled chicken, or chicken boti, and away from the curry. Not that the curry is bad, but it's too greasy. The lamb curry suffers the same fate. One of the few knocks I have on Shan is that the lamb is sometimes not cooked well... ends up overdone and kind of tough, and the bones that come with it turn to a kinda crunchy half-gelatin that can make for a bad experience texturally. Combine that with a bowl of grease, and your stomach won't be happy. Now let's talk lentils. You can't go wrong with the chana (either one). It's excellent. But the real star of the dal show here is the masoor! Pulverized to the consistency of baby food, but tastes nothing like. The smooth, creamy lentil background is flecked with curry (of course), whole peppercorns, and mild red chilis. In my opinion, you're not going to find a better lentil meal anywhere. One last recommendation - despite bad lettuce, the kabab paratha roll is a great snack if you're just passing by and don't want a belly full of curry. Oh, and the samosas totally rock. Make sure to get the red sauce with them. Oh yeah, the prices all went up $1 a few years ago, but everything is still a good deal. There are a couple of downsides to Shan: delivery is a ripoff ($3 charge + $1 additional charge for each dish), and the biryani is overpriced and nothing special.",0.9719,0.789,0.124,0.087,0.59641994478951

This place endearingly reminded me of that episode! Shan Restaurant features Pakistani-Indian food and unlike Babu's empty restaurant, it was quite busy while we were there! And serving great food at an affordable price, why wouldn't they be?  I went with some longtime residents of the neighborhood that had never heard of Shan. While ordering, the waiter (owner/cook?) kept suggesting dishes to us, and actually made us order them. It was evident he was very proud of his food and he wanted to share the joy! And I'm glad he did. We started off with samosas which were savory and came with two great sauces, a cucumber yogurt and the other a sweet/hot red sauce that was amazing. If Shan bottled it, I would put that sh*t on everything! My main order was the veggie Pakora Curry, which were rolled veggie balls smothered in a yogurt curry sauce. They had just the right amount of spice and it was excellent. My only recommendation is that Shan serve the veggie dishes with rice. The dine-in price was incredibly affordable $4.50, and I wouldn't have minded adding a few bucks for rice or couscous to go with it. My friends got two variations on spicy chicken- one looked like a typical ""Dynamite Chicken"" and the other was the Frontier Chicken. The both got rave reviews and looked good. We also shared the popular Chana Masala, chickpeas served with ginger, garlic and onions. That dish was spicy! We got a few breads with our meals, the Naan and the Paratha. Great additions to our meal.  Shan Restaurant isn't flashy. Don't bring a date here! Unless you've sealed the deal already, and the date is with your wife.

Chicken Mikhani: yuuuuum. I wish there had been a little more chicken in there but, it was an awesome dish.  Lamb biryani: AMAZING. The best of the bunch. A HUGE portion for a mere $8.99. I generally don't even eat lamb but I tore into it like a savage. It didn't even know what hit it.  Paratha and naan: good. I wish I hadn't ordered both... they were HUGE portions. Next time, only the paratha. Super great for soaking up all the gravy in the chicken dish. My only complaint was that I requested all the food be as spicy as they could make it... and it definitely wasn't spicy. Then again, we have very, very high tollerance for spice.

Their parathas (fried bread) are also excellent.... The lamb curry was a tad oily for my taste.. Their appettizers are mouth wateringly good..kabobs, desi style spring rolls and samosas !

2009-10-22,4.0,"not too long ago, i sat on a southbound 151 bus, staring through the window feeling depleted and exhausted. lost in my day dream of getting home, after we passed foster, i noticed a sign that read ""100% halal zabiha"". i perked up. reason being, indian/pakistani cuisine is one of my all time favourites. mostly because i'm a spice addict and really, no one does spice better than the south asians, but also because as a gluten free wheatard, part of re-learning how to cook for myself involved learning about indian and pakistani food (millet and chick pea flour as well as the myriad of dishes involving lentils are a wheatard's best friend). i scanned the sad little strip mall of windows and realised that Shan Foods perhaps wasn't a crappy chinese restaurant, but possibly a chinese-pakistani restaurant! after discovering usmania chinese on devon, the silk road style of cuisine has become a bit of an obsession for me. either way, if it was pakistani or chinese-pakistani, the prospect of having a pakistani restaurant - period - within 6 blocks from my house got me excited. i came home and told the boyfriend about my possible discovery. we promised each other we'd go check it out. and 3 weeks or so flew by. last week, my friend anthony posted a facebook update about having eaten there. i commented by asking if it was any good. he replied yes, and cheap too. oh man, things are getting good and looking up for food-crazed sunny! tonight, when i got home to find lucy canceled yoga due to her friend going into labour, the boyfriend brought up going for mexican. while i love me some al pastor tacos and guacamole, i was in the mood to cook. however, after realising it was close to 8pm and i'd be cooking for an hour before food would be ready, i threw out, ""what about that Shan restaurant down the street?"" i was curious to find out if it was chinese-pakistani or just pakistani anyway. so in the miserable rain, we trudged down sheridan to Shan's. i cannot stress how well rewarded we were for that soggy and chilly 6 block walk. turns out, Shan's Foods is mostly pakistani cuisine. we ordered shami kabobs, samosas (for the non-wheatard), masoor dahl, lamb biryani and keema aloo. of course, i had to have a lassi - salty for me, thank you - and we gobbled up just about everything. the food was nicely spiced, the service fast and friendly and the bill was cheap! the bill total was all of 26 smackeroos. also surprising were the grocery aisles stocked with indian curries, various spices, a nice array of lentils and remarkably, ground millet and teff flours! Shan's Foods also happens to carry a fresh selection of injera (ethiopian bread to accompany those amazing curried wat and lentil stews they make, but that's another story) as well as fresh produce staples like red onions, garlic, cilantro, chilies, curry leaves and ginger. i can't tell you how thrilled i am to know i can run there for my last minute cooking needs. also, there is a sweets counter full of halwa, ras malai, galub jamun and barfi, among other things. i was too stuffed to even contemplate sweets after all that food. it's just another reason to return. uh, hello, pakistani gem of uptown? where have you been all my life? actually, that life would only be the two months i've been living in crazy crackhead uptown. and who'da thunk there'd be other perks to crazy crackhead uptown besides cheap rent and proximity to the lake?",0.9985,0.771,0.185,0.044,0.5636752136752136
2009-08-24,5.0,"First, a note about delivery from Shan - they do not deliver, as of this writing. They may change in the future, but at this point all those who've received ""delivery"" should know that that the delivery they've been getting has been under false pretences. A few people, including me, did some digging around, and it turns out that two brothers had posted their cell phone number on the grubhub website, were picking up the food from Shan, and pretending to be delivery men for the restaurant. People who get ""delivery"" from Shan should know that - I don't think a restaurant should be held responsible for contaminated/unsafe food if the delivery system isn't even theirs in the first place. They have some of the cleanest restrooms in the city, and Anthony Bourdain will tell you that the cleanliness of the restrooms is directly related to  the cleanliness of the kitchen. Shan is primarily a restaurant, and their grocery section is meant to be a place where you might drop in just to get a couple of things in an emergency, but they expect that most people who cook Pakistani/Indian food do most of their shopping on Devon.  With regard to what should be available in a Pakistani restaurant, I hope people will keep in mind that items like curry paste are not native to the cuisine - they're British inventions. If you're not used to chicken the way it's cooked in the rest of the world, be warned that chicken dishes here may contain bones. Chickens are, um, chickens. The rest of the world buys and eats chicken in its natural form, and bones lend extra flavour to the dishes. Grow up and get used to it: Chickens have BONES. And they're DELICIOUS when the bones are left in. And now that I think of it: the lamb curry used to be yummy precisely because it had these delicious bones with marrow in them.  But, I imagine, all these bratty folk on yelp who want to ""go native"" but just not too far whined about the bones... and now I have to endure lamb without bones!  It's still yummy, but it's become really hard to find any bones filled with marrow. Damn. I knew there was a good reason NOT to give away the secret of Shan. I resisted writing about Shan for the longest time, because I was (selfishly) afraid of giving away one of the best-kept secrets of Chicago.  I was also afraid that it would be overrun by hipsters and yuppies looking for the next hip dive/hole-in-the-wall/""authentic"" place to boast about, and who would then try to change the food to suit their bland (if pretentious-and-pretending-to-be-cosmopolitan)  tastebuds. Unfortunately, that seems to have happened (see above for The Case of the Missing Bones). I think the samosas are the best in the city, with the perfect ratio of dough to filling; they're folded in the perfect (and intricate) tri-cornered style, and the outside is light and flaky.  Most samosas in this town are just lazily rolled balls of thick dough and blah filling. The food here is excellent for the price, and very fresh. Great quantities, great cheap breakfast (halwa puri), and addictive tea.  The tea here is adddictive, milky (which is how they make it in dhabas across the subcontinent), and hot. They also have excellent halal meat, which is worth trying. But, please, don't complain to the butcher if you see any bones or...blood. This is not Jewel, and the the meat is cut up on the premises. Shan doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it is: a place for cheap, fresh food and something akin to the greasy spoon diner.  The owners, servers, and staff are some of the friendliest in the city.  I once went there with a friend who mistakenly put in an extra 20-dollar note, and the server actually brought it back to us, explaining that we must have made a mistake.

I was tired, hungry and the rain started to pour real hard so I ran into the closest restaurant looking place near me. What I saw was a hole in a wall joint with a grocery store attached to it. All the customers were Indians so I decided to give this place a try. I ordered chicken makhani, basmati rice, naan, samosa, meatball, okra curry and some lamb dish to go for my friends and I. When I opened up the packaging I saw a huge puddle of oil so I scooped all the greasyness out and threw it away regretting my restaurant choice. However the portions were huge and the aroma was so fragrant I decided to give it a try. When I took my first bite, I realized how flavorful the dish was. Yeah, there were bones in the dish but I didn't mind it at all. The chicken was moist, soft, and bursting with flavor It was everything I was looking for in a good solid Indian dish. The samosas and the meatballs were SO GOOD. Especially the meatball. It didn't have the nasty ground meat taste. It was very spicy, warm, and filling. The samosas were huge, well seasoned, perfect ratio of skin to filling and both of the items were only $1.99 a piece!! I'm very used to downtown Indian restaurants where they charge buttload of money for a measly portion and mediocre seasoning. This place, you definitely get your money's worth. What really got me excited was finding out that this place delivers to my house! (I live 20 blocks away) Despite the $5 delivery charge, I will definitely order from here again.

Maybe it was a bad night, but I'm not in any hurry to get food from here again. They don't have our staple, chicken tikka masala, on the menu, so we ordered butter chicken instead, along with bindi masala (okra) and a beef dish (beef at an Indian restaurant? never seen that before) called Paya. We also ordered rice and naan. The food came on time and we got a free samosa, that was about the best I can say for it.

The two pieces of beef in the broth were really, really fatty. I guess we know better than to order beef at an Indian restaurant again. The butter chicken was okay, but really greasy and looked like the sauce had separated; the main flavor was just the heat and the grease. The bindi wasn't bad either, except for again being really greasy. The free samosa had a nice crust, and they do give you a good amount of rice, but the naan was dry and tasteless. Very disappointing. And now I have a fridge full of leftovers that I don't really think I'll be eating.",0.9414,0.795,0.129,0.075,0.5734567901234567

My dh and I had gotten ill from their samosas twice, they don't make my beloved chana pulao, and their chana masala doesn't taste the same. Why....oh....why!!!!

My friend and I picked out some desserts and the man behind the counter threw in a few extra for free. My other friend rummaged through their VHS tapes on sale. We found one with English subtitles. We asked the man behind the counter if it was good and he goes, ""You'll like this one.""  The food is cheap! It's great quality for the price. The second time I ate in with two friends. The three of us had tea, split two entrees, 4 pieces of nan and chapati, and 4 desserts. The bill? 17 bucks. I graciously paid for my friends.  While we waited for our food, we laughed at a hilarious Bollywood film playing on the TV.

2008-07-21,5.0,"Out of all of my previous reviews, Shan's is the first review I've written about a place that I frequent.  Today marked the first of six days I have off from work. A much needed vacation + it's been nearly a year since I've taken such time-off at such length.  I had a few to-dos before deciding that I should make the most of such a beautiful day + truly take hold of not being at work. That said, I  decided to grab a few beach/park essentials (blanket, water, book) + kick my shoes off on the city's lakefront. Something I usually daydream about doing while running about work.  I was trying to decide what to take for an early dinner, on my trek to the lakefront. Since Shan's was en route, my decision was quickly made.  Great service, very friendly + accomodating as I ordered their Chana Pulao, a basmati rice dish w/ whole chickpeas, diced tomato + various spice w/ freshly sliced lettuce/onions. I paired my order with a slice of fresh naan (some of the best in the city, I might add) + as though I hadn't had enough chickpeas, a package of candied chickpeas for an added $1.  All in all, my order came in under $8. I took a seat nearby + watched a bit of AAJ TV, on their flat screen, amongst the predominately male customers. Within 10 minutes, my order was packaged + ready.  After settling on a grassy knoll, near the lake, I pinched off pieces of naan + scooped the chana pulao ...It came with a separate small container of herbed yogurt sauce. I don't eat dairy but from friends who are fans of Shan's, it's quite tasty.  I should have ordered two naan, since I finished my one slice halfway through my rice. Without any utensils + this being my main meal of the day, I decided to think quick + use the lid for the yogurt sauce as my spoon ...Which worked out perfectly + only attracted a few sideway glances from onlookers.  Aside from their rice dishes, I strongly recommend their dal/lentil dishes ...All coming in at $4.99. The Chana Masala (chickpeas w/ ginger, garlic, onions) + Dal Chana (yellow splitpeas w/ spices) are other usual standbys.  Their Aaloo Palak (spinach + potato w/ spices) is the best I've ever had + again the price ($4.99) is unbeatable.  It's been a little over 5 hrs. since I ate my Shan's feast + I'm still pleasantly full ...That said, I did debate going back on my walk home.",0.9922,0.89,0.11,0.0,0.4011904761904762
