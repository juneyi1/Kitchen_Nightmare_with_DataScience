2017-07-22,4.0,"I decided to try this place based on numerous recommendations. I ordered their famous spinach stuffed pizza (bambino-individual). The flavor of the spinach & ricotta mixture with sauce is pretty good. The only thing that held this pizza back from being a favorite was the crust. It was soggy on the bottom and therefore chewier than I'd like. However, placing the pizza on a hot skillet for several minutes made it crispier and that fixed the issue. Definitely noteworthy pizza but doesn't make the cut for my favorites in the city.",0.9113,0.835,0.165,0.0,0.6045454545454545

Twenty minutes later, tired from all the tire-swing action, we went back to find our deep dish pizza was ready ahead of schedule. We opted to eat inside and there was plenty of seating to do so.

I'm not a huge fan of thin crust, but this one was pretty great. And the cheese! Again, such great cheese. The toppings were plentiful. And the crust was tasty. The Caesar salad was plentiful and came with lots of dressing. The pasta was cooked well. But it was lackluster. There was little to no flavor. In sum, get the pizza!

After trying all of the Chicago deep dish options, I believe I can confidently call myself a deep dish connoisseur and admit it's hard to find the perfect balance of cheese and sauce while also having flavor. Bacino's nailed all fronts. It wasn't super crusty like Lou's, overly cheesy like Giordano's (coming from a Wisconsinite, that's saying something) or too saucy like Gino's East.

2017-05-07,4.0,"My trip to Bacino's was based solely on a stranger's suggestion, and I'm thrilled we took the advice.  We walked through the front entrance and my eyes lit up as I stood in front of an *open kitchen* with joy in my heart. I watched the kitchen knead the dough, construct the pies and work the oven as we waited. There was also a small table with free promotional glassware for the customers, so we grabbed a few.  Our server Pricilla was very attentive and always friendly which was very impressive since she was taking care of the entire front dining room where we were seated. The appetizers came out in a timely manner and we waited about 30 minutes for our pizzas, which was not long at all. We started with the bruschetta: the garlic rubbed bread was crunchy, sprinkled with Parmesan cheese, and presented adjacent to the fresh basil, cherry tomatoes and extra virgin olive oil. The toppings were chopped instead of diced, lending to large crisp bursts of flavor with every bite as the balsamic glaze coated the toast without turning it soggy. The Goat cheese salad surprised me the most as the baked cheese and walnut mixture was placed on top of toasted bread like a spread, with the mixed greens and tomatoes on the side. It was warm and delicious, and I will definitely start warming my goat cheese at home when I'm looking for a snack. My friend and I have two completely different tastes when it comes to pizza, so we each ordered our own ""small"" CYO chicago style stuffed pizza: She chose fresh garlic, jalapeños, and Italian sausage as her rich and hearty ingredients. The spicy combination from the jalapeños and sausage were a perfect balance of heat with the cheese and sauce, but when I tried a bite, i didn't think garlic as a main ingredient made much of an impact because the sauce was already amazingly garlicky and thick...still, the pizza was Delicious! I chose pineapple, black olives, mushrooms, and Canadian bacon for my ingredients because I love me some sweet and savory! I too was in heaven with the taste and presentation of my pizza; I love the black olives on top, not sure if it they were added as an afterthought, but they added color to an already good-lookin' pie! The taste profile was out of this world (""thank you, me"" ""you're welcome, me"") and even after filling up on one slice I HAD to have a second. And a third on the way home. Ordering a small is perfect for me, with extras for the next day- I enjoy a  cold slice just as well as a hot one, and will be back to try the thin crust, which happens to be my favorite style of pizza. -------------- 5/29/17 Ordered a thin crust with pineapple, Canadian bacon, mushrooms, and it was FANTASTIC! The thin crust was a little heavier than I would like, but there were so many ingredients I'm sure a thinner crust couldn't have held the weight of the toppings. Plus- the pizza is cut into squares which I adore because I can eat more by stacking them and making mini pizza sandwiches  *yum yum yum*",0.9979,0.821,0.166,0.013,0.5796273876782351

Cheese lovers, add this place to the top of your list. They are extremely generous with the cheese on both styles. The stuffed was amazing; avoiding the sogginess of other places with a maintained crispy crust on top and bottom. This is a flour based crust, which I prefer over rivals with cornmeal. What I liked about the pepperoni and sausage stuffed was how it tasted light. I didn't feel disgusting after eating it like other pizzas. (I'm not going to go into detail about their ""heart healthy"" famous spinach pizza, but google it or ask them about it!) The sausage was good, not the greatest, but well-seasoned and juicy. The sauce was savory and natural tasting. Now the thin crust, it tasted very similar to the stuffed, but obviously executed differently. It was super filling for a thin crust! You really can't go wrong here at Bacino's. It is also rumored that Bacino's is a sister location to Giordano's dating back to the 70's. I give Bacino's the edge though on this one.

I normally order a medium thin crust from Bacino's as I have been doing for the past 8 years because I do love their pizza. I've lived in the Lincoln Park neighborhood for awhile as well. I always recommend this place to family and friends because the pizza is flavorful, not too greasy and the service is usually great!  Unfortunately, this was not what I experienced today when I went to dine in with a family member of mine who was visiting. We arrived during their lunch hour on a Tuesday. The restaurant had one other table. Needless to say this was not rush hour by any means.  Miguel took our order. We ordered a large Bacino's special. When we came back to get our pizza we were given a medium. Fine a simple mistake. No big deal. I spoke with the server who was extremely accommodating and friendly. She said she would relay the message to Miguel, the man at the front who took our order. She came back to relay the message and we were told we would have to pay for another small pizza if we wanted to put in another order we could- again, no big deal, right?  However, when I went to speak with Miguel to resolve the situation -I overheard him saying to the server, ""This lady's a pain in my ass!"" Then when he walked out of to the front of the restaurant to approach me the first thing he said to me in an aggressive manner and tone was, ""I did only charge you for a medium, right?"" When I tried to explain to him that we explicitly put in an order for a large and this was why I was dissatisfied, again he chose to speak to me aggressively instead of simply apologizing and admitting his mistake. The server even apologized profusely for Miguel's actions. (By the way she was great!) A simple, ""I am sorry-What can I do to fix this?"" would have done the trick. Instead, Miguel said rather rudely, ""We're giving you a small on the house.""  Miguel did not once apologize or admit his mistake, in addition to his comment about me being,  ""A pain in his ass.""

Yelpers everywhere glorified the spinach stuffed pizza so that's what we ordered. And because we were feeling so fat from our lunch at The Purple Pig earlier that day (which doesn't explain why we're eating pizza for dinner), we ordered the vegetarian stuffed pizza. We also ordered a salad, but nobody cares for that... right? To be honest, I had my doubts about this place. I saw all these reviews for the spinach pizza and I kept wondering, ""What could be so good about a spinach pizza??"" But after I had my first bite, my answer punched me in the tongue. Perfectly balanced flavors and textures, the spinach actually tasted fresh, and to my pleasant surprise, it wasn't even that heavy despite all the glorious cheese oozing out from every angle. I think I was making indecent noises the entire time I was eating that calamity from heaven. As for the vegetarian pizza.. I almost forgot we even ordered it. It wasn't bad, but it definitely couldn't stand up to the spinach pizza. Ah, I'm drooling as I type..  I was pretty much gloating for the rest of the night. The food was just THAT good. After having spent $68 for lunch at The Purple Pig and feeling less than cheerful about it, Bacino's of Lincoln Park was a very welcome relief to not only my wallet, but to my pigged-out tastebuds.

2015-08-22,1.0,"As a pizza connoisseur, i wanted to try this place out for the first time. A group of friends and I came to try this place out because i heard so many good things about it. So here's my take on Bacino's... First, the restaurant itself is old and nothing special to look at. In fact, tables are cramped in and you'll be bumping into the people behind you every time you need to get up. A 4/top is extremely cramped with two medium pizzas on it. Second, the pizza itself must have sat out before they brought it out to the table. The cheese wasn't cheesy, and the pizza itself wasn't piping hot. and it also took twice as long to come out to the table. The server said allow 30-35 minutes for the pizza to come out. It took an hour for both pies to come to the table. Maybe something to do with the service itself. As far as taste, not Chicago's best, if you're looking for Chicago's best there are many better pizza joints. As far as pricing, on the more expensive end of pizza and expect to pay full price even for half toppings (ridiculous) we did a half specialty spinach pizza and the other half with two toppings and said ""since im paying full price for the toppings, i want the full portion of both on that side"" and portions were very very light. The second pizza was no different, both came out together, both nothing special, both were not hot at all. To give you an idea, an appetizer, a medium and a small deep dish, and three drinks with tip over $100-ridiculous. Now service, one would think with what you payed for the food, that you'd get dazzled with the service and the service was the worst of all of the aspects of the evening. The server was inattentive and he disappeared for 30+ minutes at one point, even things such as refills when he would come to the table we would have to ask for. Even seeing, or expecting him to see the empty glasses, he still didn't ask if we needed refills. In any event, if you got money to burn, time to waste, and don't really care about the taste of your food, then by all means go there. But if you're looking for some truly great pizza, you can't go wrong with Malnati's or Pequod's and probably save a few bucks as well.",-0.0166,0.873,0.062,0.065,0.5231284606866002

2015-07-16,4.0,"Ah, Bacino's. In my quest to try as many deep dish/stuffed pizzas around Chicago as I possibly can, I discovered Bacino's of Lincoln Park (on one of those lists that boast the best deep dish pizzas of Chicago). We had been planning on dining here for months before the stars finally aligned and we made the 40-minute trek from the 'burbs. We were able to score a pretty good pay-to-park spot, which was exciting considering Lincoln Park can be tough because there are so many parking spots that require a permit. We walked in and were surprised to discover that there was not a soul dining at Bacino's on a weeknight. There were a bunch of workers sitting around listlessly using their phones and joking around. We (of course) got our pick of seats, so we opted for a booth. The booth was pretty big with tall backs such that I felt enveloped in a very pleasing all-encompassing way. Comfy! I'm not sure why I thought this was a good idea at the time, but when David C. asked me what size we should order, I said ""large."" We got the spinach stuffed large pizza. We waited about 35 minutes for it to be ready (exactly within the quoted amount of time). It was a very large and in charge pizza, stuffed to the brim with ample cheese and spinach. The menu said something about it being the only ""heart healthy"" stuffed pizza and I'm wondering if this is meant to be a joke? Clearly there was nothing (but maybe spinach) ""heart healthy"" about this bad boy. And we weren't complaining.  Naturally, we were way too stuffed to even take a look at the dessert menu, but our friendly waitress still gave us tiny homemade chocolate chip cookies. This was such a treat and a great touch!

2015-05-16,1.0,"Bacinos forgot lesson 1 of customer service. When you delay the promised delivery time and never call to alert the customer, that is a problem.  When the delivery stretched 25 minutes past the promised time, we attempted to call the restaurant. We were put on hold-twice- and after another three minute hold had to redial once again. Ultimately the manager answered the telephone and stated that when taking the original order, his employee left off one of the numbers of the charge card.  Of course these mistakes happen but what you don't do is delay the order and not even call the customer, busy or not. Instead he just had the pizzas and salads just sit there waiting to be delivered. What the manager should do do and what he never did, is apologize profusely and explain that the pizza will be delivered immediately. This manager, who said he's been employed at the restaurant for five months not only did not apologize for his employee's error but didn't even make the gesture of deleting a delivery charge or even send a complementary desert. Either gesture would have been appreciated and it's a pretty standard reaction on the part of a restaurant. I attempted to provide the manager with an opportunity to make up for the error and calmly stated that I've been ordering from his restaurant for over 17 years and rarely run into problems. But tonight this delay embarrassed me in front of several out-of-town guests who are visiting and who earlier in the day had visited the restaurant at my recommendation. $70 is not a small bill at a pizza restaurant and I wondered if the owner (Dan) was aware of the poor attitude and incompetence issues existing with his manager of five months? I would find that hard to believe! So sorry Bacino, your normal five stars dropped to one star. And in your world of greater consumer choices and intense competitive pressure in the deep dish world, this can not happen too often. And yes, I know your year's success is based not on guys like me only buying $70 of pizza or others buying your $5 slice but instead Pitch Fork or Lollapalooza (I forget which one you supply). However don't forget the lesson your old neighbor Enzo taught you, that selling the festival is great but sometimes is not enough to carry you when your employees fail you and let you down.  And buy the way, tonight's poor experience really left a terrible taste in my mouth and not even your tasty pizza and salad helped remove it.",-0.8446,0.776,0.099,0.125,0.500925925925926

We called to find out what was going on and were given a bunch of BS like the driver just left he is on his way. Once the guy arrives 90 min later the box looked like someone stepped on it. I opened it and half the pie was stuck to the top not to mention ice cold. I attempted to send it back with the driver and he said I need to call. He even denied any fault as he blamed the guy at the restaurant. I refused delivery and called immediately I spoke to a manager who gave attitude and had to be convinced that the order was completely wrong.

An hour and a half later, there was no food in sight. I called to make sure they had the right address. They explained that they were short a delivery driver and that it would take another 15 minutes. Two hours after my initial order, and still no food, I called again and was placed on hold. When I was finally spoken to on the phone, a female employee seemed annoyed that I had called again. She said she could give me a $10 credit But that she wasn't ""trying to get attitude from me."" I explained that my real concern was that the pizza might be cold after being driven around for an extended period of time. At that point she decided to unilaterally cancel my order. I clarified, and said no I don't want my order canceled, I have been waiting for two hours for food. I just want to make sure it's not cold when it gets here. She replied that it doesn't matter she already canceled it. She then hung up the phone on me. When I called back, she told me that if I called again tonight, she would make sure the restaurant never delivered to me again. She hung up a second time. After being completely dumbfounded by that treatment, again a restaurant that I order from regularly and have been a loyal customer to... I decided to call Cheesy's who had a pick up order ready for me in 10 minutes. A few minutes after securing my Cheesy's order, the delivery driver called me and said hey I just checked and your pizza is still warm if you still want it. I explained that the order had already been canceled by the employee on the phone, who he described as his assistant manager.  I like their pizza, but am seriously concerned about the ability of the operation to function in times of unique circumstances (not that being down one delivery driver is that unique). It seems like if they didn't have enough delivery drivers for the evening, they should've just told me they couldn't take my order, or offered for me to pick the pizza up. Extremely disappointed and embarrassed for the employee who spoke to me so rudely. She should probably not be in a position dealing with customers, let alone managing anyone.",-0.8529,0.867,0.056,0.077,0.559996099579433

After eating the very mediocre pizzas (and when I say mediocre, I'm being generous), I called Bacino's to inform them that the discount had not been applied. The man who answered the phone put me on hold then came back and said there was nothing he could do since the bill was closed out. I don't believe that for a second. He could always have issued a credit to my credit card. He said to mention the coupon the next time I order. There won't be a next time. Apparently my return business is not worth $3 to them.

Its my anniversary and I thought it'd be so awesome to go to this place and have a romantic evening and of course, an awesome heart shaped pizza.....NOT!!  What did I miss with this place? Was there a new management change or has their service and food literally turn to shit?? We get there and ask for our heart shaped pizza and our waitress claims she has never in her life heard of heart shaped pizza being served at this restaurant and insists theres no such thing. My husband pulls out his phone and shows her how their is a picture of heart shaped pizza on their website which in turn made this girl go ask somebody who should know....our waitress asks the host who sat us at our table. They were literally 2 feet away from us and we heard the entire convo, which was something along the lines of ""Its way too busy to do that just tell em we dont do it anymore."" So our waitress literally turns around and tells us ""we dont have that anymore"". Ok I get it you're too lazy to grab a pan, clean it, grease it and prep it. Whatever. I'm still starving enough to stay here and order food. So I order a regular round stuffed pizza. The middle dough of my pizzza was so wet it literally tasted like raw dough. Our appetizers were sooo blah and in much need of salt. And boy oh boy was my soda flat. But its my anniversary so I'm making the most of the whack appetizers and normal round yet undercooked pizza. Before I left I took it upon myself to ask to speak to a manager. And surprise!! It was the host who sat us. No wonder everything sucked the manager's a lazy scrub who obviously doesnt give two shits about pleasing customers. The host proceeds to tell me prep time for a heart shaped pizza is up to 45 minutes...um i waited an hour for my lame undercooked round one. I told the guy I heard everything he said when the waitress asked him about the pizza. He gave me a half ass sorry and a bajillion excuses. I told him I came her to eat right...not for your excuses. He kinda shrugged it off and informed me that my waitress would take my debit card at the table for payment. When I paid I signed my receipt and did NOT give the waitress a tip.

It was a soothing dish.  My stomach was already filled with the Bruschetta and hence I could not enjoy the pizza. Also, one personal pan deep dish pizza is enough for two people. It is the stuffing that makes the dish heavy. The taste of the pizza's weren't that great! SERVICE: The waiter is friendly and polite. I went there on a weekend evening and did not have to wait.

The spinach pizza is the specialty, but I have to say I liked the pepperoni better. The cheese is real which is great, but it might be too much. The slice is THICK and mostly cheese which made me feel like I was dying (which I'm not sure is a good or bad thing?). I had bruschetta as an appetizer and it was as good as any bruschetta I've had. I've also tried the caprese salad and that was phenom. The chocolate chip cookies are  bomb.com  (so soft and chewy).  Wine and beer list is extensive and good. The only reason this isn't five stars is because it's too much cheese for my taste. I even had trouble finishing a personal pizza because of the cheese content. The wait is not unusual for deep dish, so that doesn't bother me but considering they're not usually super busy, they should definitely consider seating for slice-buyers.",0.7844,0.773,0.126,0.101,0.4966308243727598

So we had no choice but to order a whole pizza.  She showed us to the dining area and of course there were only one other party there. We wanted the deep dish but she told us it will take 30 minutes. So we opt for thin crust and well unlucky for us that also took 30 mins or more. A group of people sat behind us 10 minutes after we ordered but somehow they got their pizza first. Hungry and disappointed by our experience we were hoping the food was good. When it finally came out the pizza was piping hot.. Too hot to eat, so we had to wait for it to cool down a little. Finally time to take a bite, super delicious, their cheese, and sausage plus veggies were so amazingly good. I was very surprised by their crust it was perfect crisp.

The problem here is NO ONE told me and confirmed the price when I called.  My fault for not asking before I hung up but I was in a rush and didn't think much about it.  When I picked up the pizza they cut it into squares as opposed to slices.  When speaking with the manager he said ""i don't see slices on your receipt"".  That's BS.

2011-12-21,5.0,"What can I say?  There's a reason that this pizza is always one of the best sellers at Taste of Chicago.  I grew up about a block away, so I have been coming here for almost 32 years now.   Bacino's has, in my opinion, the best stuffed pizza of any in town.  It blows Giordano's out of the water, and is clearly better than Nancy's and Edwardo's and numerous other competitors with similar offerings.  If you don't agree, try the pizzas side by side (you'll see that Giordano's tastes like a watered down clone of what Bacino's is selling).  Bacino's is fresher and better tasting than its competitors, every time.  The stuffed spinach is the signature dish and the best in town (always ask for mushrooms - they're free), and you won't go wrong with any of the other pizza offerings on the menu.  A stuffed sausage, pepperoni and giardeniera is a beautiful alternative, and it works great as a thin pizza as well... As for the location, it's not the most beautiful space, although they have done a decent job remodeling.  The ability to open the windows in summer makes it a great location to sit at a table, drink a few beers, and take it all in as you watch the world pass by. Finally If you're concerned about temperature, as some of these reviewers are, I recommend picking up, rather than having it delivered - show up about 5 minutes before the estimate they give you on the phone, and you're set.  Fresh out of the oven, and even with the drive home, it's still piping hot when you eat.",0.9924,0.815,0.168,0.017,0.5835648148148148
2011-12-17,5.0,"Bacino's is, hands down, the best Chicago style pizza out there. I've been to all the ones that usually get mentioned (Lou Malnati's, Giordano's, Uno/Due, etc) and they pale in comparison to Bacino's. The crust here is that perfect buttery flaky/crunchy texture, and there's not too much of it. The pizza is perfectly stuffed--thin crust, like pie, on the bottom, cheese and toppings, then sauce on the top.  The spinach with mushrooms is the best pizza I have ever had in my entire life, and I've been eating Chicago style pizza for over a decade now. As a bonus, you can pretend it's good for you, because it says ""heart healthy"" on the menu! Never mind the many pounds of cheese that must go on every pizza--it has vegetables! But whether it's heart healthy or not, it will be healthy for your spirit. It has that perfect blend of spices and spinach and cheese. mmmmm. They even make personal sized chicago style pizza. It's not my favorite way to go, because the ratio of outer crust to inner gooey goodness is not the same in the personal size, but it's a good way to please everyone if other people in your group refuse to get the spinach pizza. I don't recommend the thin crust pizza here--it's average. Go for the stuffed chicago style. Though if you have meat, be aware that the amount of meat and cheese in one of those pizzas can lead to a greasy experience simply because, well, meat and cheese are both greasy, and there's a lot of both in the pie! The space itself in the Lincoln Park restaurant is average pizza joint-esque--there's a bar, some booths, and a few tables. Downstairs there's more seating, but it's dark and a little dingy. The bathrooms (also downstairs) are a little sketchy, but the pizza makes it all worth it.

Now this is not a knock on the stuffed pizza which gets its name because one slice will leave you stuffed. (Probably not but they're free to use that statement on their menus.) It's a matter of preference for stuffed pizza vs thin crust. The pizza always tastes fresh and there is just enough of all the ingredients. I love green peppers and onions but make sure you're not going out with someone of the opposite sex after without first cleansing your mouth As for dining in, they have improved the restaurant since I used to go there as a teenager. They have a bar in the back with TVs and more seating downstairs. It kinda feels like a sports bar. The lighting is dim but this is not a romantic place at all. Go here for pizza. Nothing else.

As far as their pizza goes, the thin crust spinach supreme is in fact supreme.  The crust was almost a perfect thickness.  The blends of cheeses, herb, and spices were definitely a step above the typical regular cheese and gave the pizza a lighter, more sophisticated taste.  Unfortunately, our next disappointment came when we requested Tobasco sauce and were informed that the one bottle was presently at another table and therefore unavailable to us.  What restaurant carries only one bottle of Tobasco?  I know a little goes a long way, but please buy a couple so we don't have to share.

Several hours later we arrived at O'Hare, with the weakest of the bunch ready to pass out from the hunger pangs.

Too bad for him, I run a tight ship and nobody shall be subjected to airport food when we were so close to getting out. So with promises of sustenance, I ushered everyone to the rental car shuttle and we were off - with me busily trying to find us some Chicago pizza deliciousness on my handy dandy Yelp for iPhone app. Eventually, I settled on Bacino's as a result of the reviews and relative proximity to our hotel on Michigan Ave (apparently 5 miles in Chicago is a lot more than 5 miles in LA.)  We ordered the large Spinach Supreme and an order of the breaded mushrooms. We figured it would be enough for the 3 ravenous fools. Well, we were right. We had that pizza around 4 in the afternoon, despite the fact that I was starving I was only able to have 1 slice.

Chi pizza debate.  As far as that goes, T-Ball rules apply.  Everybody wins, especially when the pizza is a good as what I had at Bacino's. The thin crust reminds me of a pizza I had in New Haven, CT once - a very favorable comparison.  The crust is a fairly even combination of crispiness and chewiness.  Being a stuffed pizza, there was enough cheese, spinach and tomatoes to make a quiche.  The ingredients all had their own identity and all were able to play together nicely to give a uniformity of flavor.   Sometimes, when you've got good ingredients in your food, you need to back off and let Nature take a bow.  Bacino's, much to their credit, seems to get this.  I would happily come back for a slice, hopefully sooner than 2 years.",0.9815,0.811,0.164,0.025,0.5595598845598845

One, it was slightly undercooked and we tried to have it baked a little longer, they ended up adding more sauce that made the pizza crust soggy instead of crispy. Two, even after requesting light on cheese and easy on cheese, there was way too much cheese on it!

She took a glance at the menu that was posted on the front of the restaurant and noticed that they served calamari fritti, which is something that I have been craving. We ordered one order of the fried calamari. My girlfriend ordered a bowl of the soup of the day, which was Minestrone, and we split a personal-size stuffed spinach pizza (I told you, we had a really light dinner!). Anyway, the server brought out the fried calamari and my girlfriend and I both looked at each other right away in secret agreement. They. Use. Frozen. Fried. Squid. How did we know that they didn't use fresh calamari? Hmm, where are the tentacles? They are nowhere to be found. The calamari was a dark-golden brown and heavily breaded. Initially, I wasn't bothered at first since I just wanted to satisfy my craving for calamari fritti, so I ravenously shared the appetizer with my lady. The calamari plate did come with a small serving of salad greens, so I didn't feel too bad about taking in mostly fried breading and oil. My lady's soup was ""mediocre, at best.""

The cheese in the pizza was pretty good, but every other disappointing element just overshadowed the good qualities.  To make matters worse, the service was lacking. I don't mean to sound like a stickler, but I think that once a patron finishes his or her glass of water, you need to refill it before the glass is empty. I was in such need to quench my thirst after munching on the dry crust. We were already ready to pay for our less than satisfying light meal. Our waitress was nowhere to be found for a short while.

And the deep dish, well, if there were poets who sang the praises of food, this would be their muse. Great odes would be written about Bacino's deep dish pizza. So cheesy, so saucy, so full of all the things pizza should be full of... And it's allegedly ""heart healthy."" Not sure exactly how they're pulling that off, but hey... I'm not going to question it. If it is, Nobel prizes should be in order. If not, whatever. Either way, the pizza is The Best.",0.969,0.814,0.186,0.0,0.48903769841269834

I've been coming here for the past 11 years and I love it as much as I did the first day I went! needless to say I have made some good friends and family fans too!! You have to try their Bacino's Special stuffed Pizza, spinach cheese garlic bread and their Salads are great!! Their wine list isn't great and a bit to pricey for the quality of the wine.",0.9808,0.72,0.28,0.0,0.5354761904761904
2007-03-22,5.0,"Definitely one of the best pizzas in town.  The stuffed spinach is to die for, and there is something on the menu that says its ""heart healthy.""  I don't understand how this absolutely fabulous pizza could be good for your heart, but its simply too good to wonder about logistics.  I'll just eat it and not feel guilty about devouring as many slices as I can stuff in my face because its ""heart healthy.""  :oD",0.9031,0.785,0.186,0.029,0.5857142857142857

The cheese is perfect, the sauce has a great, tangy taste and their crust is so crispy and tasty. What more could a girl want? No problems with delivery, never dined-in.",0.9481,0.668,0.268,0.064,0.7659090909090908
2007-01-29,5.0,"Bacino's is my FAVORITE Chicago pizza place.  Their stuffed pizza is just the freaking best!  I went to DePaul University, a short walk from Bacino's on Lincoln, and never had a bad experience here.  The down side of course is that stuffed pizza can take a while....so have a few beers while you're waiting! I've never had bad service, never had a bad pizza, and never had my order messed up.  I always head to Bacino's when I'm back in Chicago visiting my peeps.  LOVE IT!",0.9589,0.721,0.226,0.053,0.45888888888888885
2005-12-05,2.0,I honestly didn't think this pizza was very good and it was way too greasy! The thin crust was better looking then the thick but it just didn't taste that fresh and wasn't satisfying.,-0.2284,0.7,0.158,0.142,0.7150000000000001
2005-12-05,4.0,"Good pizza here, some of their selections are advertised as ""heart healthy"", I think those include any pizzas where greasy processed meats are absent.  Their dining area is pretty casual, I've not recently experience any sort of wait for a table, though perhaps I have just been lucky in that regard...",0.8658,0.804,0.196,0.0,0.6749999999999999
2005-09-30,4.0,"Yeah, I could eat.  It's always there when you can't figure out what you want.  The pizza is so good...the cheese is very fresh.  Thick or thin crust, it's all awesome!  Sometimes has a terribly long wait.",0.7082,0.681,0.238,0.082,0.675
