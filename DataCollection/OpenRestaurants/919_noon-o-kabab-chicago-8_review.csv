2017-09-03,3.0,"Have unplanned guests? Need food fast? Order Noon O Kabab to go! I was on the corner of Western and Lawrence when my friends called unexpectedly to let me know they were coming over. I didn't have any food at home to serve so I was about to drive to Pita Inn in Skokie to get some Mediterranean food. Then I remembered a good friend of mine told me there's a really good kabob place on Kedzie so two minutes later, I arrived at Noon O Kabab. They have two locations within less than a block radius. One restaurant is sit down and the other is self serve (order to go). The place has parking but be aware, it's really, really packed. You're lucky if you find parking in the actual lot, stick to street parking if you can, it's rather hard to get out of the parking lot. Anyways, I walked in and the line wasn't too long and since it was my first time there, I let the cashier know I needed enough food for four people. The cashier suggested getting  the Joujeh platter (two skewers of juicy marinated chicken on an open fire served with rice) and Koubideh platter (two skewers of ground sirloin beef seasoned with Persian seating and also served with rice). The cashier even asked me if I would like it served family style and I said yes. I also ordered their homemade hummus. My total was about $56 dollars for two platters and hummus and I was told it would be about a fifteen minute wait. The place is clean, the bus woman and boy were busy picking up dirty dishes, sweeping the floors and making sure everything was tidy. The place was packed but it has a beautiful ambiance and aura to it, the wall art is charming as well. My food was done in less than 15 mins and the richness of the food smelled my entire car up! I have to admit, I was a little disappointed when I opened the food up when I got home, there was double the rice in comparison to the meat. There was a good amount of chicken but considering I ordered two skewers of beef, there was double the amount of chicken in comparison to beef- even though I ordered two skewers of each!! I have to admit, they serve significantly bigger pieces of chicken on the skewer and that could be the reason for the significant difference in portions. Either way, I served half the platter of rice and then all the chicken and beef on one platter and thank goodness we had enough food. Truthfully, if we didn't have other food available, we wouldn't have been able to feed three people nevertheless four. Even though the chicken was juicy, it tasted bland next to the rice. The chicken is great but even with the small side of grilled veggies and rice, there's something missing to make this platter excellent. Maybe it's the lack of salad or a sauce? I don't know but it's missing that extra key ingredient that would make this meal mind blowing. If you don't eat the chicken while it's hot, it become a little dry with the rice so I ate it with the hummus. Their hummus is really, really delicious and I ate the whole small serving in one sitting. The chicken and hummus paired together taste really good!!  I do intend to come back and try the rest of the items on their menu!",0.9966,0.827,0.136,0.037,0.5477124183006536

Maybe it doesn't seem like a big deal, but my lamb shank was so small, it seemed comical compared to the huge amount of rice they gave. On top of that, when I asked to not get the rice or alternatively, to substitute it for hummus (expecting to pay an additional charge), I was told the dish only comes one way.  Good food.

2017-08-01,5.0,"When I'm craving a hearty meaty meal this is what I want. I've been here a couple times so I wanted to put in my review. We were coming home from a long day out and we were all starving. My husband decided to order the family platter and 2 ash soups. We didn't realize how huge the family platter was until we got it. We didn't eat inside the restaurant and just got carry out because of our tired kids. So the family platter includes a large tray of half dill rice and half regular. It also includes a huge tray of the mixed meats pretty much every grilled meat item you can think of. So it has the barg, koubideh, chenjeh, and joujeh(pretty much it's grilled filet mignon, ground beef kebabs,, ribeye, ground chicken kebabs, and chicken breast). You get one long skewer of each or more. It was delicious. The meat is flavorful, slightly smokey, tender and juicy. The ashe soup is so delicious it's a vegetarian soup with beans, and tons of herbs (I think spinach, parsley, etc). It's really good but my kids didn't like it it was too healthy for them. This is definitely my favorite Place to get Iranian/Persian food.  In terms of service it was quick and friendly. Parking is fairly easy with a small parking lot outside the restaurant and lots of street parking nearby. I haven't decided if this place is really kid friendly. It's a little too nice for kids but you can totally take the kids here. Just rather do carry out with my young kids here. If you want some amazing grilled meats this is the place! Check it out.

They have two variations of the restaurants-a full dining experience as well as a quick self service eat in joint right across the street from each other. Now that's thoughtful. Regardless, I inquired and the staff mentioned the food at both places is same, it's just the dining experience that differs. They also have secured fenced parking.  Moving on to the real stuff- food! My buddy who is also a big foodie like me, strongly recommended me to try their 'Barg', which is their marinated juicy filet mignon skewer-charbroiled. I am going to to the same here and recommend it to you. The steak was cooked perfectly and it almost melted in the mouth. It came with a gravy sauce with onion. Certainly try pouring it over your meat for enhanced flavor.  Other items we ordered were The koubideh, ground beef skewers and the Noon o joujeh, chicken kabab also well cooked and flavorful.  Thanks to @Yelp, for the free appetizer (check-in deal) we got the kash-ke-bademjan, roasted eggplant puréed with onions, garlic and aged yogurt served w warm pita.

Our party shared an eggplant appetizer, rather smoky, served with sour cream or perhaps yogurt.

Also service was friendly and the place is warm and family-like, clean, and classy (we ate on the table service side of the restaurant).   I really like flavorful food and I have to say the Ghormeh Sabzi was incredible - all fresh herbs cooked down into a stew, so super flavorful but not at all spicy or heavy. Unfortunately we were not impressed by the pomegranate mushrooms (my husband barely ate it because he found it sweet) and the eggplant dip starter (a little blander than we thought it would be), so for that reason I have to give it a 4 not a 5.   But coming back for seconds of the Ghormeh sabzi soon!",0.9909,0.734,0.227,0.039,0.5369378306878307

The pita was so warm and fluffy! The Caspian Eggplant paired very well with the pita bread. It was lightly sweet and savory! It comes as a mash that spreads easily but can also be eaten with just a spoon dipped into the yogurt sauce that came with it. This is a nice appetizer to share with the table. The Barg was incredibly tender! Even the dill rice was flavorful! The filet mignon Alan of meat was huge but was also cut so easily with a knife! Each bite was tender and juicy! I could not stop eating it and every bite sent me to a blissful heaven! The Soltani came with the filet mignon slab of meat as well as a ground up sirloin which was equally as tender.

2017-03-11,5.0,"I had a delicious meal here, recommended by a friend who had eaten at Noon O Kabab's Milwaukee location on the Northwest side.  Another Yelper had mentioned NOK was the best place place to get kebabs in Chicago, a claim which I will support from my first visit. We were drawn to this location by their free parking lot and the option for a quieter, white table-cloth sit down restaurant, versus the grab-and-go NOK location right across the street (north of Leland ).  They are basically the same establishment, split into two buildings so that you have the option of different dining experiences. Genius. I really enjoyed their Persian food. The five stars comes from a combination of good food, good service & good company.  Make sure to order their tea, subtly spiced with cardamom, and there will be a huge silver tin of sugar cubes on your table for sweetening. Shared amongst 4 people: Large hummus Joujeh Koubideh (chicken breast kebab); 2 skewers Koubideh (ground sirloin); 2 skewers Lamb Kabab; 2 skewers With each of our meat entrees we got 50-50 dill rice and white rice, served with charred tomatoes which were delicious.  I wish there were even more charred vegetables; some bell peppers and roasted onions would have tipped this near-perfect meal to perfection.  All their meat was tender, their chicken delicious with a generous drizzle of fresh lemon. Once you are seated, you get a basket of thin pita along with a spread of chopped onions, feta, and parsley.  You get a free appetizer under $7.50 were a Yelp Check-in and our group was unanimously down for a large hummus ($7.00).  Our server was attentive and kind.  We had a pitcher of water at our table and she checked in several times to ask how to food was or if we needed anything.  On a chilly Saturday afternoon before it got crowded, our group was well taken care of. For a group of four splitting our food family style, next time I would order two meat entrees (instead of three) and add a couple skewers on the side because we had a lot of rice left over. They have huge portions. Make sure to ask for a side of tahini and their house-made hot sauce (which is very mild). They were out of Baba Ghannouj when we went which was a bummer, but I will definitely come back here again.  Not only for the Baba Ghannouj for also for the Lamb Shank, the Yogurt salad, Pomegranate Wings, and a variety of their other appetizers.  Also, their saffron ice cream looks to-die-for. In all honesty, when I first heard their name ""Noon O Kebab"" I had no idea what to expect... but don't let that deter you.  You will not be disappointed.  The Albany Park area is so rich with different types of restaurants and bakeries to explore.  I would love to bring my family here since we love Middle Eastern & Mediterranean cuisine.  My sister and I were raised on Pita Inn, Grecian Kitchen, Dengeo's and Kabul House in Skokie so the next time we're reunited, NOK it is!",0.9958,0.834,0.147,0.019,0.5593015873015872

2017-01-29,1.0,"I'm going to copy and paste what I posted on their Facebook. I think everyone should be aware of how offensive the owner is. Short Version: The food is good, but the owner is a misogynist and has no qualms expressing himself as such. Long Version: My boyfriend, best friend, and I decided to eat dinner there this evening for my boyfriend's birthday. The evening started out well. Our server was personable, charismatic, and provided excellent service. Our food came out quickly and we were enjoying our meal (discussing the dessert we were going to order as well as our second round of drinks) until the owner came by. I think it's important to mention that I was dining with two men. He asked them how their meals were and they responded happily. Then he looked at me and asked if I was a vegetarian. I said yes. Then he asked me ""who told me I should be one,"" like somehow, as a woman, I could never make that kind of decision on my own. This is where things went seriously downhill. The restaurant owner told me I was ""wrong"" for being a vegetarian. He asked me if anyone had ever told me that before. I said that being from Louisiana, some people were confused by my choice-but it was my choice. Then, he proceeded to ask me what my blood type was, like that is 1) his business and 2) matters at all. At that point I was so confused I told him I was O negative (why? why did I answer??) and he just said, ""You're killing yourself, you know."" He went on and on for about 5 minutes, telling me that I should change my diet because of my blood type, that my voice was weak, and I looked sick...all because I'm a Vegetarian. When I told him I have been one for 20 years and was healthy, he said it ""wasn't possible.""  Then between telling me that my entire lifestyle and diet were wrong, he kept looking at my friend telling him that ""he didn't want to lose out on rent"" and we ""shouldn't be offended."" They weren't going to pay, I was. This kept going on and on until he could tell he offended the entire table. That's when I walked out. I guess at that point the busser came by to ask if everything was okay. My boyfriend and friend said ""no,"" and they both acknowledged that they had to say something after having to endure a sexist rant from an owner who had no business butting into my diet. The owner came back and started apologizing, while they were telling him I was offended enough to leave and that he has no business treating guests like that. Our server came by to check on the situation, and the owner comped our meal. Somehow, he thought it was a good idea to mention that he hoped ""I would come back.""  I want to emphasize that our server was great. My boyfriend tried to get change for a $50 and the server wouldn't accept because of the way I was treated. They left him a tip anyway, though he did try to pass off the owner's behavior as having a ""weird sense of humor,"" but I don't think he knew the extent of what happened. So, at 27 years old I had to sit and listen to a man tell me that I was killing myself, that I'm unaware of the decisions I make with my own body, and that I was ""already weak"" as a woman but was making myself worse by not eating meat. Long story long, I can't believe what happened tonight. I've never been treated like that by restaurant staff, and I worked in the industry for 10 years. We all sat in the car on the way home, trying to comprehend what happened while I cried because I felt so belittled and helpless. Excuse my language, but fuck that. I should never be made to feel helpless by someone who clearly doesn't understand medicine. By the way, I'm perfectly healthy, and I certainly don't need a man to tell me how I should eat. Never. Again. EDIT: His nephew reached out and apologized for our experience. It seems like the rest of the staff is not on board with his behavior. Unfortunately, it wasn't just his comment on my diet but also his blatant sexism that I felt were completely inappropriate. While I do appreciate their effort to make up for what happened, I can't look past this.",0.9606,0.756,0.131,0.112,0.5631652661064426

For years it was my favorite restaurant in Chicago so it pains me to write this negative review, but after several bad experiences (and the most recent egregious one outlined below) I had to express my disappointment regarding the service and how patrons are treated. While the food is still very good (although not as good as it was years ago), I had such a negative experience there this week I do not know if I can return. Knowing that reservations can only be taken for large parties, I called about two weeks in advance to reserve a table for 12. Then I phoned back to update it to 15 as the party size increased. The day of the reservation the restaurant called and I confirmed the reservation. When I arrived everyone was there (except me) and I was told that they had given my table away and they could only set-up for two tables size-by-side. While not ideal, I understood that we would have to make it work. As I started speaking with my friends I was told that the friend of the family of the owners had yelled at several in my party for ""being late"" -- when I asked about this I was told he had confused our group with another. No apology for yelling at my friends. After the orders taken and food delivered we had no service at all and I had to go up to ask for my check. Overall, I did not feel welcome and of course the 18% gratuity was automatically added. While the manager tried to make amends she indicated that the owners wanted to give away the table (which does not make sense if a reservation is made) and it makes me think that they are trying to milk the previously good name for all its worth and no longer care about the experience of the customer. A very sad day indeed to see such a great place go so far downhill. I hope the owners will take a new approach in the future.",0.946,0.751,0.143,0.106,0.5533801145091466

I was pleading with her if she could take a reservation bit she rudely said no and even refused to say how long the wait time was. She was one of the rudest restaurant managers I have come across...if they can't take reservations they just say so not take reservations and then back out last minute.

This food is a treat for the tastebuds-uniquely delicious. Started off with hummus, pita, appetizer plate with feta cheese, radishes and raw onion and a Persian salad to share between the four of us. Also had some of their wonderful freshly brewed hot tea. Two of our group had Salmon shishkabob, one filet shishkabob and I had chicken shishkabob made with freshly ground cinnamon and grilled to perfection. Three of us had the dill Basmati rice, one white rice. The dill rice was superb-no minute rice here! I'm a big boy and three of the four of us are large people. We all took home food in ""doggy bags"". They also have a full bar. The owner, a very attentive lady, recognized us and took over waiting on our table personally. One caution-she's very proud and if she makes a suggestion, take it! She's always right anyway. She comped our hummus and Persian salad and made us feel like family. This place is so good they have three restaurants within one block of each other and a forth about 5 miles away-they are different iterations, the one we ate at is full service, one carry out only, two counter order and pickup with tables but all with the same high quality food.

Last time I was in here she had the audacity to snatch a notebook out of my hand that did not even belong to her and then proceeded to belittle me in front of the servers. Don't get me wrong the food here is great and the servers are amazing, but the manager Grace, is terrible. I would recommend for them to find someone who smiles and treats people as human beings.

2016-11-19,5.0,"My husband is Persian, and Noon O Kabab is by far his favorite Persian restaurant in the city.  In fact, it's pretty much the only one we frequent.  We bring all our friends and family members here, and everybody loves it.  If you haven't had Persian food before, this is a must-try.  Persian food is fragrant and flavorful, and Noon O Kabab is the best in the city.  As a non-Persian, I thought I would give you my guide to what to order if you want to go beyond kabobs (which are excellent, don't skip them completely!): Kash-Ke-Bademjan (Appetizer) - This is an eggplant dip kind of like baba ganoush.  You eat it with pita.  It's really delicious, we order it every time! Tadiq - Persians take their rice making very seriously, and their specialty is this crispy-end-of-the-pot rice.  Noon O Kabab makes it extra delicious with their own special recipe.  Get it. Ghormeh Sabzi - This is Persian comfort food, and my husband craves it all the time.  It looks kind of weird b/c it is a stew made from mostly parsley, lamb, and kidney beans, but trust me, it's delicious.  If you really want the Persian experience, try this, you won't regret it.  You can order it with the Tadiq or as a separate entree. Fesenjan - This is a very special, difficult-to-make dish with tender chicken stewed in a walnut and pomegranate sauce.  It's soooooo good.  My in-laws mostly make it for special occasions b/c it's so time-consuming, but you can take yourself to Persian food heaven anytime at NOK. Shirin Polo with Joujeh Barg - This is one of my favorite dishes.  It's a chicken kabab with rice that is made with orange peels, carrots, raisins, butter, etc.  It's a little sweet and the chicken is delicious.   Bomieh & Zulbia - These are sweet Persian pastries that you can have as desert with a cup of Persian tea.  They are dripping with honey.  I also quite like the Baklava at NoK! Doogh - This is a yogurt and mint carbonated drink that apparently is very popular in Iran.  It took me a while to get used to, but now I order it every time we go! Ok, now I'm hungry again!  Go enjoy a Persian feast, and if you need someone to go with you b/c you want to try everything and this is obviously a ton of food, call a friend!",0.9979,0.779,0.209,0.012,0.7243886743886744

2016-10-21,5.0,"I had absolutely no idea about Persian food before coming here. I got here with some Iranian friends, and I would say now this restaurant has set a standard on Persian cuisine. I had no idea how delicious it could be. First of all the service was awesome. The waitresses were so generous that even if they ordered food or doing normal conversations in Persian l, they made translations in English for me to get comfortable. The ambiance was quite good for a friday dinner time. Not too much crowded but it was quiet crowd, probably not many talkative college students like us were there. Anyways talking about the food: we ordered Tadiq with ghormeh sabzi, chicken wings with pomegranate sauce as appetizers and Lamb kabab with half dill, half plain rice as main dish. I liked the tadiq, especially how they make it (probably I'll try the same at home, just kidding). Food were really delicious, tasty but not too spicy compared to indo-pak cuisine. One unfortunate thing is we forgot to order their special Iranian desert (I was full by the time we finished the lamb kabab though). They also serve tea after the dinner, it is a Iranian custom I guess (also they made it free for us, I don't know why, they were talking in Persian, so I didn't get that part). Overall the experience was awesome. Definitely I want to try Persian again. P.S. Check in on Yelp while you are there and get a free appetizer worth not more than $7.50.

2016-10-08,5.0,"Let me start off by saying OMG. My wife and I saw Noon O Kabob on Check Please 15th Anniversary Episode last night. Everything looked great on TV and we were in the mood for a Mediterranean dinner. We arrived at the restaurant at about 5:15pm and we were immediately seated by a lovely Hostess. We quickly discovered that Noon O Kabob is actually a Persian restaurant. Our server Celia came over and introduced herself and we showed her our Yelp Coupon for a free appetizer. We ordered  a cocktail and the large Hummus to start. The Hummus with Pita pieces was the best we have ever had. My wife ordered the two Lamb Kabobs with Dill Rice and I had the Special Soprano (Filet Mignon) Kabob with another Ground Beef Kabob with Dill Rice topped with Saffron.. The staff brought us a complementary order of the Persian Salad. I'm normally not a fan of Cucumber, but this salad was amazing. The Lamb was extremely tender and the Dill Rice was to die for. My Filet Kabob was perfectly seasoned and the Ground Beef Kabob (Koubideh) was awesome. We finished off our meal with a cup of House Tea and an order of Bomieh dipped in Saffron Honey for dessert. The entire bill came to $72 before Tip. The value for your money is incredible. We have more than enough for an additional meal tomorrow. As an aside I want to thank Celia for the best service we have had in quite a while. Next time you feel like Mediterranean / Persian, I highly recommend you give Noon O Kabob a try.

2016-09-25,5.0,"This might be the BEST kabob in Chicago. I ordered the lamb kabob and shrimp combination with dill rice (~$19). It was a big portion but everything on the plate just came together really nicely. The lamb was just right; juicy and cooked to perfection with just enough gamey smell. The shrimp was coated with lemon and cooked to perfection again; not too hard, not too soft. The shrimp was fresh and bouncy. If you'd never try dill rice before, try it. The dill rice was really really good. I think the acidity of the shrimp and the gaminess of the lamp complemented each other really well. This is really worth $19 and I would totally order this dish again! I also got a tadiq (crispy rice) with gheymeh sauce (tomato, split pea stew with beef). This dish was recommended by the menu. I personally didn't like this dish because I think the crispy rice was too crispy and could not absorb the flavor of the sauce. The gheymeh was okay by itself. Many people recommended me this place including my two Iranian friends. So that's why I came to this place and I was not disappointed. I have tried many kabob places including Oasis Cafe (cheap, good-for-the-price food), Reza's (expensive, better food) and Al Bawadi (expensive, nice ambiance, okay food). All of them are good already in my opinion, but I have to say this again, this might be the BEST place in Chicago Land to try a kabob. The service was also very good. My waitress, Celia, was very friendly, nice and very helpful. She recommended me to get the combination dish. The food came out really fast too.

She would make not only amazing Persian food but incredible French food. Filets of Sole a la Bonne Femme? Yes. OMG. When I took her there and she tasted the food, she said ""Wow...this tastes like back home"". What higher compliment can a Persian restaurant get? Their kabob is absolutely incredible. Tender, flavorful. No salt needed. They don't skimp on the saffron either which a lot of places do because they're cheap!! Saffron is an essential ingredient in Persian cooking. Not only do they do great kabobs but they make all the legit Persian rice pilafs like ""adas polo"" which has raisins, nuts and I think lentils (I could be wrong). They also do the take-all-day stews like Ash (I think it's pronounced Ahsh) and gorma sabzi. And the pomegranate martinis? Awesome. They also make zoolbia I think which is like a Persian funnel cake made with rose water. If want authentic Persian food, this place is it. If anyone tells you Persian food is like Lebanese or Greek, slap them. Persian food for those who know is in a league of its own.

Well, that's until it came time to pay, my server was missing again.  Never knew anyone to run from money, lol, but she soon came back and was always pleasant.  I ordered the hummus, Chenjeh and Koubideh plate, and added a skewer of Joujeh. It sounds really fancy writing it, but it's just skewers of rib eye, ground sirloin and ground chicken.  They charbroil it, and I also had the Persian Rice (dill).  Sadly the flavor just wasn't there for any of the food.  It didn't taste bad, just not flavorful.  The pita that came with the hummus was cold and kind of stiff, not good because I love good pita.  Sometime during my meal my pita basket was replaced, this time it was warm and fresh!  The hummus was pretty good, just not outstanding.  Being adventurous I was curious about the native looking drink many people were having, found out it's Doogh, a yogurt drink.  They graciously gave me a sample, let's just say it might be an acquired taste!  Reminded me of buttermilk, lol.

Made the trek up from downtown through crazy traffic to eat here. Was Sunday afternoon and they had just about a full house as I am sure it was a lot of groups there for sunday dinner. We were given a nice table by the window which was nice as its good for street watching.  They brought us bread, cheese and onions to start us out and then we decided to order appetizers for the 4 of us to share. We got the Olovieh (Persian potato salad) which was really good and the Dolmeh (grape leaves with tomato saffron sauce). We also got some sort of Persian spinach that was very good over rice. They also had Efes beer which is supposed to be one of the best Mediterranean beers around...very refreshing!  After all of that I was already full and didn't need an entree.  My entree was the Soltani which is Barg (large skewer of marinated filet ) and Koubideh (ground beef sirloin with Persian seasoning) over dill rice! Both cuts of meat were delicious, but the Barg is probably the most perfect piece of seasoned meat I've ever tasted. The flavor was 2nd to none and paired with the dill rice was a lethal combination! Very big portions as well which is good if you intend to share and not be a fatty LOL! I chose to be a fatty that day! Our server was very nice and worked hard, but she broke my heart when she told me that me and my buddy drank the last Efes beers and there was no more Lebanese beer...truly disappointing but her service, great atmosphere and awesome dishes more than made up for it!

The food was good - we started with a ton of spreads - the hummus, baba ghanouj, tabouli, and upon our waitress's request, the Kashk-ke-Bademjan, a warm eggplant dish with onion garlic and yogurt -- very good. There were whispers around the table that the hummus was 'the best hummus everrrrr', but I think some of my fellow diners were just very hungry. For mains we ordered the family platter, which comes with a a whole variety of meats, a filet, a sirloin (someone said 'oh this one tastes like hamburger!'), ribeye, and chicken. We also got an order of the lamb koubideh and the salmon, which was 'highly recommended!' on the menu. Well, I'd recommend it too, as that was probably everyone's favorite dish of the night. The meats came with a full plate of rice -- for every single person at the table. Seemed a little excessive to me but......'MERICA!  Overall, good food in a nice restaurant with good service.

2016-04-20,5.0,"Some of the best Persian food I've ever had. Granted I've never actually been to Iran or the Middle East but reliable sources have informed me that this place is THE place to go for if you want to pretend you have been there. After coming for dinner, I'd like to corroborate those claims.  Foreword: I will be unable to spell any of the dishes. Enjoy the poorly written descriptions Started with two appetizers, a mashed eggplant dish that WASN'T Baba ghanoush(this version had caramelized onions and other spices in it), and a a sort of crispy rice that was topped off with some lamb stew. The eggplant dish was delicious, very well balanced with the caramelization, and tasted great with the complimentary pita, cheese, onions, and parsley that were brought to the table. The crispy rice was...well...crispy as advertised, though the lamb stew on top was actually not very stew'ish and had a less savory flavor than I would have liked. And then the platters came. And everything was great. Sampled a bit of the Ground Beef and Chicken, the Chicken kabab, and the lamb shank(which came in its own delicious stew that would have been a meal on its own Aside from all the rice and skewers). They flavors were all well balanced and, unlike some other Persian food I've had, there was not a single dry piece of meat in the bunch. The lamb shank was incredibly tender and the stew came with some vegetables which were great when I ate it together with the rice. And the rice....that may have been my favorite part of the meal. Order Dill rice. Seriously. Dill Rice. They give you a huge bed of two sorts of rice, the dill rice on the bottom topped with saffron rice on top, and the combination alone...I could have eaten just that rice for the meal and been happy. In fact....if they were close by I would just buy mountains of that rice for home use. Yep...it's good. At first glance the prices seemed a bit high, as the plates ranged from $14-19 for two skewer combinations(I think they start at $10 if you only get one skewer). However these are massive plates....these yelp pictures really should have a banana for scale so people aren't misled by how much food they're getting. I only got through half my food and packed the rest, and what I took home was larger than most of the takeout meals I've gotten from places. Granted I had a bit of a snack before coming for dinner, but a two skewer platter can definitely feed two(or 3 if you have small eaters).",0.9973,0.818,0.165,0.017,0.5929004329004328

2016-04-09,5.0,"I was very skeptical about trying a Persian restaurant in the US because I am Iranian and I know how difficult it is to cook authentic Persian food, especially Persian stews. Even in Iran It's hard to find a good restaurant that serves Persian food and everybody there agrees that if you want good food you should go to your grandma :)) So when I took my friends to this restaurant I was not sure if they would like it since I was expecting a dull taste or at best an Americanized taste.  But to my surprise their food tasted just like home! Everything was great. The restaurant was packed and we had to wait 40 minutes to get in but it was totally worth the wait. We were immediately seated and served by their super friendly staff. We ordered a lot of things from their menu because we were eager to taste different dishes. Their Kashk-ke-Bademjan, Fessenjan, Adass Polo and Tadiq topped with Ghormeh Sabzi were wonderful. Very delicious and full of flavor! Highly recommended! I just don't think that their kababs were great, but it might be because their stews were so extraordinary that I felt this way when it came to trying the kababs (we ordered chicken, lamb and Koubideh). We had Baklava and Zulbia for dessert. Zulbia was good, but as for Baklava I had better experiences in other places. However since baklava is originally developed in Turkey and is part of Turkish cuisine no high expectations there.  I highly recommend this restaurant to anybody who wants to get a taste of Persian food or anyone who is looking forward to trying something new and remember its taste for a long time  *Just take into consideration that the portions are very large, so if you want to taste different dishes you can order them as sides instead of the full portions.",0.9954,0.777,0.192,0.031,0.6215403009688725

I got the lamb shank and it was very tender. Also oddly sweet which I was not expecting but I guess when it says there's some cinnamon on it, I should have seen it coming. It came kind of like a soup type thing, with the carrots and juice the lamb was cooked in. Don't get me wrong it was delightfully tasty. I just don't think my Korean taste buds were expecting anything sweet. Anything I see in a soupy type form and my brain is automatically programmed to think its going to be spicy. Anyways, the dill rice was amazing. Just a slight taste of dill. Keep in mind the portions are huge. My roommate and I got appetizers beforehand and when our main dish arrived, we were already kind of full at that point.  But anyways. For appetizers, I got the spicy pomegranate chicken wings. It was the perfect blend of spicy and sweet. Just a slight taste of pomegranate.  Although, my favorite was the baba ghannouj. It was SO good, with the pita. To me it was like a hummus-y thing.

Chicken and meat dishes like kobideh, chengeh, joke ha Kababs, lamb Kababs,lamb shank are awesome, mouthwatering! They are all accompanied by a mound of Basmati rice. You can have it in 3 flavored- plain, dill or sweet rice. You have a choice to choose two of a kind with your meal. Last time I was there, I ordered ""tadiq"", it is the bottom burnt rice when cooked in a pot. They do a marvelous job. Just try it, with Gorma Sabzi ( it is a spinach dish with meat, cooked to perfection).  Top off your meals with the best jasmine tea and Bamia ( sweet balls of fried dough in honey)!

We were immediately seated by a friendly and welcoming server. She brought us cups of hot tea while we reviewed their extensive menu. We ordered a small hummus which was fantastic. The menu had so many options that looked good, it took a while to make a choice. I finally selected Chenjeh and Joujeh (Rib Eye and marinated chicken) which was fabulous. It is served with jasmine rice, pita and grilled tomatoes. The chicken was well flavored but the steak was excellent. It was cooked to perfection (medium rare), juicy and tender. The portions are enormous so I finished less than half of my meal. They boxed what was left, which gave me dinner that night and lunch the next day. I really enjoy Middle Eastern food and this now ranks as one of my favorites. The only downside is it is a little hard to get to without a car.

2015-09-09,4.0,"Noon o Kabab is a white cloth Persian/Iranian restaurant near the Kedzie brown line stop. Having seen episodes of the Shahs of Sunset and reading Persepolis sparked my interest in trying this cuisine for the first time. To be honest, I've never come across an Iranian restaurant until now.  Noon o Kabab has two establishments located side-by-side-the delivery-pick up establishment and the finer dining establishment next door. We arrived and were seated promptly. We were given complimentary pita bread and an accouterment of onions and feta cheese. We also ordered the dolmeh (vegetarian) appetizer. The dolmeh (stuffed grape leaves) came in a tomato-based sauce. This wasn't very appetizing-lukewarm and rice-based, the dolmeh needed a heartier stuffing. For the main course, we shared an order of joujeh and koubideh (one large skewer of boneless chicken breast and one skewer of ground beef). The meat is accompanied by a choice of white or dill rice (Get the dill rice).  The food looks exactly like the pictures on the menu/Yelp. Its a beautiful presentation, and with the exception of the dolmeh, the food was well-prepared and pleased everyone at the table.  The service needs to be picked up a notch-We waited ten minutes for our order to be taken, asked for butter when the food was brought over and never received it, and to prevent further delay, handed our credit card to the server as soon as she brought the bill. The food is good, and given the number of people waiting, we didn't want to be stared down by hangry patrons any longer.",0.9564,0.863,0.104,0.033,0.43245149911816577
2015-09-08,5.0,"Went with a group of 21 yesterday.  Everyone raved about the food, and I agree: it was the best Persian cuisine I have eaten.  I've had Fessenjan (chicken in a walnut pomegranate sauce) at a few other places and have always liked it, but the sauce at Noon O Kabab had a richness I had not encountered before.  It was exquisite.  I sampled five different appetizers, including 3 variations on eggplant.  All were delicious. The service was very good, too.  Our waitress brought out some complimentary side dishes, including a yogurt sauce, and was great about having leftovers boxed up and splitting the check. I wish we'd had room to try some of the desserts as well -- that will have to wait until next time, and there definitely will be a next time!",0.9908,0.736,0.264,0.0,0.5467857142857143

We wee a party of eight and we all tried different variations of beef And chicken kabobs as well as an eggplant-based appetizer called Kashk-e Badenjan. All of was exceptionally good with generous portions, juicy kabobs and perfectly cooked rice. We also tried a couple yogurt based sides: Mast-o Moosir  (with shallots) and Mast-o Khiar (cucumber) plus Olivier Salad which is a kind of Persian potato salad. Everything was good, There were a few negatives! On the top of the list was our server who happened to be one of the owners. While we were fortunate to have her as a server, she came across a bit pushy with her suggestions. I really did appreciate the suggestions but what I didn't appreciate was how forcefully she made them. Another problem was the long delay between appetizers and main dishes. That was most probably due to how busy they were. We were there at around 3pm on a Sunday afternoon, which ordinarily is not a busy time. But on this particular day they were dealing with a large Persian conference in town. Still they should have been more prepared. Given the size of their portions and the quality of their food, prices are reasonable.",0.9373,0.842,0.122,0.036,0.5009637188208618

2015-08-15,1.0,"For the past several years, I have ordered take out food from Noon O Kabab. In the past, their shish kabobs, (my favorite lamb) has always been very large, juicy chunks of meat. This past year, the portions has become so small and dried up-ribeye, ground beef and lamb. I was horrified with my take out order this week. I was horrified-how much I spent and there is no food for the next day. They have cut their meat portions in half. You will NOT have any left overs.  Each order of shish kabobs is $17 each. All you get is a ton of rice. It's pitiful. The wings used to be over 4 inches long and were pomegranate flavored. Now, they are small, puny wings (2 inches). Everything on that menu has shrunk. I don't recommend this place at all. Same price and half the meat. The hummus is cheap too. I ordered a large hummus and it appears to be super small. BTW, there is NO flavor of the day for ice cream. Even the ice cream portions have shrunk! They are now half the size and over $4!

2015-07-06,3.0,"We came here for Fathers Day for a party of 8 and had an overall nice meal. You should definitely make reservations because they do get busy especially if you come on a holiday weekend or I'm assuming evening. Did I love this place? Absolutely not. Would I come back? Probably not unless someone invited us here but I wouldn't go out of my way and here is why. They were fully packed on that Sunday and I felt like a little under staffed or the staff appeared a little too busy for us since I kept having to get their attention if I needed something which is kind of annoying. They give you bread and some feta to start which is a nice plus as you wait for your food. We ordered two appetizers of which I didn't care for either one, the Baba Ghannouj which is a roasted eggplant blended with tahini, fresh garlic, parsley & lemon juice topped with olive oil. It was okay, but definitely not the best I've had and I wouldn't say I loved their pita for dipping purposes either. Then we tried the other roasted eggplant dish and we all felt it had a little bit of a bitter taste to it. What we really wanted was the falafel which is on their online menu and the lady tells me ""oh, we only have it at our carryout location, which happens to be closed today."" That was a bummer right there since what kind of place doesn't have falafel that's Mediterranean, or at least take it off your online menu.  Next we got all our entrees and I personally got the boneless chicken breast and the sirloin ground beef entree but I got their speciality rice (which has an added price) which has raisins and carrots. It was all a okay, honestly I didn't love the flavor to it, I felt like it was just a okay. They do get a star for nice presentation and a generous entree which you can easily share for two people. They also get a nice star for having a nice and friendly staff, we just wish they made for of an appearance during our lunch. And one more star for a nice, pleasant and clean environment to go have lunch or dinner with family or friends. Like I said, I didn't love the service as it needed more attentiveness and I didn't love the food. My parents got the lamb and shrimp dishes with the dill rice (which looked better than mine) and they all felt it was just an okay experience. We should have tried their baklava dessert but by the time I was looking around for our server, we just asked for our check.",0.9977,0.738,0.209,0.053,0.6012390670553937

We are repeat customers, repeat as possible once a week for a long period of time.  Servers know us.  It is quite puzzling that the women owner/manager of this restaurant, has not once acknowledged our presence, or welcomed us,.  She  completely ignores us, as she goes from  table to table talking with certain other customers, asking if everything is o.k. and welcoming them to her restaurant.  I find this quite odd and quite obvious, since especially as repeat customers, we are the customers that a restaurant depends on to be successful.  We are quite visible, and when we walk in the door, we are completely ignored by her. Another reason for minus a star, is that a young baby was banging a large serrated knife against the dishes on it's table and swinging the knife into the air, possibly hitting and hurting the customers sitting around.  I found this totally inappropriate and dangerous for this to be allowed in a restaurant and it was just luck that no one was hurt by this baby swinging this large cutting knife around.

Everything was amazing.

Then came the kabab platter of salmon, chicken, filet mignon, lamb and beef kababs. Every kabob was juicy and perfectly seasoned. I ate well beyond my capacity, because I wanted to enjoy those tastes for as long as possible.  In addition to the divine sweet rice with orange peel and raisins, the dilled rice with lima beans and the plain rice with a hint of turmeric, we also had the tag dig with spinach. Absolutely spectacular!  How we ate dessert after all that is beyond me, but eat it we did:  tiramisu, baklava and fig ice cream - all delicious.  This is my new favorite restaurant.",0.9931,0.761,0.239,0.0,0.6656610750360751

But was it worth the journey? Absolutely. It was quite busy on a Sunday, which was surprising to my friends who were regulars, and so the 6 of us were rather squeezed in between two other large tables. I felt every breath the woman behind me take, I felt every move she made, but I wasn't watching her. Besides being mistaken for a Russian by the hostess (I'm Ukrainian), the waitstaff was friendly and attentive. We were especially happy when our server brought us more cheese and pita, because who needs to order apps when you can fill up on that?! It was a perfect combination of rich, creamy cheese, with radishes and onions. I spread the cheese on my pita and devoured it. For my entree, I chose the vegetarian mix curry and it was loaded with cauliflower, which is one of my favorite vegetables, as well as green peppers, green beans, potatoes, carrots, and mushrooms. The aromatic broth is a light tomato based curry, which complemented the vegetables nicely. And what everyone else says about the dill rice is true- it's flavorful and potentially addictive!

While it's completely out of the way for me, I decided to stop by Albany Park on my way home from business on the North Shore, as the Kennedy was a parking lot, per usual. I looked at my trusty Yelp app and they recommended this splended joint.  First, the interior of the restaurant is unconventional, yet welcoming. The bar is utilized as a server station, the back entrance is where you go in, and the decor is authentic and tasteful. Service is prompt. The food, of course, is the winner here. I had the combo of the Koubideh and chicken skewers. Both were packed with flavor, fresh off the grill, and scrumptious. Vegetables were also spiced properly and grilled just enough. However, the rice stole the show. Obviously, you NEED to order the DILL rice here; even if you aren't a fan of dill. Hands down, the best rice I've had in my life. They add lima beans (?) and spices that put it in that special category. I'd eat the stuff by itself for a meal if given a choice.

I introduced two of my sisters who live in Texas and Louisiana. We all love this place.   Why the review? Their food is great. Anything meat broiled and cooked to perfection on a skewer is delicious with a heap of delicious basmati rice. My favorite is the Sultani. After dinner its nice to have a cup of the earl grey tea. Hits the spot. The bamire or baklava is a nice desert option too.   The cost of the meals are $10-18 an entree. The real winner, portions are good and you'll defiantly have leftovers.

One of the rudest, unpleasant individuals I have ever encountered. She will look at you and treat you as if you just wiped your arse with her cat.  She brought the wrong dish to my partner at the time and argued with him that was what he had ordered (which he didn't). So she angrily took the plate away and said she would bring him what he wanted. Not wanting to be rude, I waited to eat my food until his arrived, no big deal. Apparently this bothered her, she came back to the table 5 minutes later and asked why I was being a baby. I was told that I should eat and not be bothered by ""him"" not eating.  Sadly, 15 years later, she is exactly the same if not worse.  If you want beautifully cooked Persian food, this is the place.

2015-02-01,3.0,"Came here recently on a whim because my cousin was craving Persian food. They make an amazing lentil soup- probably the best I've ever had. It's surprisingly refreshing and the flavors blend so well together. It's also very visually appealing- You can see the finely chopped veggies and herbs that marry to make this wonderful flavor- it doesn't look like brown mush which is usually the case. When you check in on Yelp there's also a free appetizer available- but the options are very limited as you have to stay under a certain dollar amount (I think it gave us 3, maybe 4 options). We opted for the Kash-Ke-Bademjan (roasted eggplant puree) at our server's suggestion. They have two different kinds- one roasted with garlic, the other with tomato. She was kind enough to give us a combination of both side by side (we preferred the taste of the garlic once). For our entrees we both ordered the Lamb Kabab & Koubideh plate (one skewer of charbroiled lamb, and another of their signature ground sirloin) that comes with charred tomato and rice. They also provide a plate of sliced white onion, parsley, radish, and a cube of feta cheese for each diner to enjoy with your meal. Overall we really enjoyed the food. The reason for the lower rating is the service. The restaurant wasn't busy at all, and it's not very big. There were two main waitresses for the room. I was a waitress all throughout college and could have worked the entire dining room more efficiently than they did. Once we received our food our waitress didn't come check on us for quite some time. I had to go to the bar and flag her down and ask her to bring us the garlic sauce my cousin wanted. Normally they charge it as an appetizer but she was nice enough to give us a small side of it on the house. Then at the end of our meal we were waiting... and waiting... and waiting... to ask for boxes and the check. At the counter there's a basket full of to-go containers, so after awhile I decided to once again get up and grab the containers myself. Just as I grabbed the container our waitress finally walked out of the kitchen and saw me and made a comment along the lines of ""Oh, what are you doing? I am supposed to check on you and see if you need anything"" almost like she was annoyed that I was getting the boxes on my own. Well, sweetheart, you were taking too long. Don't get me wrong, the waitresses are overall very nice- but they don't scan the room like they should. The other waitress would walk with her head down from point A to point B- never scanning the room to see if any of the diners needed anything. There was another table of about 6-7 gentlemen who were clearly also made to wait for long periods of time. They were constantly looking around trying to grab a server's attention just like I was. I think they actually left after just appetizers- probably didn't want to wait half an hour for their entrees. All-in-all, the food was great but they need to better train the waitresses to check on customers and anticipate needs before they arise (like filling water glasses- my cousin sat with his empty several times). Or maybe hire a busser to do those specific things!",0.9937,0.856,0.108,0.036,0.4875702075702075

2015-02-01,4.0,"The portions are huge. Fresh, quality food with a great price point. We ordered several dishes so that we could all share. We ordered several appetizers. We started with the Aash-E-Reshteh which was loaded with lots of fresh goodness. The amalgamation of the spinach, lentils, beans, chick peas, cilantro, turnips and oats worked perfectly with the slowly simmered noodles. It was topped with caramelized onions and yogurt and provided a burst of ethereal flavors! We also ordered Dolmeh, which is stuffed grape leaves. These were stuffed with ubiquitous rice, tomato, onion, herbs and other flavorful spices and surrounded by tomato saffron sauce. We also tried the char-broiled chicken wings with an incredible and delectable  pomegranate glaze. They were very tender with an explosion of ethereal flavor. If you get no other appetizer, and you are not sure what to get as a starter, get these!  You get seven wings that are  perfectly char-broiled. Thank me later :D They offer vegetarian plates as well so if you are a vegetarian you will have plenty of solid, good choices here. For our main courses we ordered several dishes. I rarely eat red meat, but ordered the Chenjeh and Koubideh (two skewers which consisted of Rib Eye and Ground Sirloin). The meat was tender, char-grilled to perfection, and beautifully seasoned. My rating for this dish is 5-stars. My husband had the Barg which was a huge skewer of Filet Mignon. He said, ""Wow, this is awesomeness on my tongue!"" He really, really, really, really enjoyed his filet. I always ask him to rate his food so I can Yelp about it later. He gave it two thumbs up, a huge smile and 4-stars. Ghormeh and Sbazi and Koubideh was ordered by one of our friends. He said it was worthy of 5-stars. Basically, this was a bowl of sbazi and ground sirloin with dill rice and char grilled tomatoes with a few raw onions. The Lamb Shank and Koubideh dish was ordered by our other friend. The lamb is simmered in a tomato garlic sauce which penetrated her taste buds quickly. These ubiquitous dishes are served with rice (two different choices), char-grilled tomatoes and freshly sliced raw onions. The spice Advieh is used in Persian cooking, and is comparable to a mild garam masala which is very fragrant, a little sweet, and gently warming rather than spicy. I could taste the Persian spices as we enjoyed our meals. Pita bread is set on the table as soon as you sit down. Get extra hummus (we liked it so much that we ordered some ""to go"" along with extra Pita bread), because we thought it was/is excellent. We went here over one year ago with a group of friends. We decided to go here again last week for dinner. We met up with several friends (who happen to live near this restaurant), and didn't have to wait long to be seated. My final rating is 4-stars. Service was worthy of 4-stars, although it was super slow and inattentive. Perhaps it is a cultural thing -- not sure. However, the cuisine is worthy of 5-stars. We really enjoyed everything that we had and will definitely return again. It was well worth the drive. This is a great place to go with friends or family. It is a family-oriented business.

This is certainly a family run establishment where the more authentic dishes come out to be exactly that, good and authentic.  The food, atmosphere, and the service far exceeded my exception.   I would save the five star rating for southern California restaurants of the same kind.   Overall I would highly recommend this location and personally would return for another visit myself.",0.9966,0.721,0.253,0.026,0.4604251700680272

While it's a little out of our way (ok, a lot) we had heard great things and decided it was about time we gave it a try! We arrived and it was smoking busy! I had called the day before to make a reservation for 7:00 pm but was told that they only take resos for parties of 7 or more, but that we should be able to easily get a table at that time. We arrived around 7:30 on Saturday evening and the waiting area was packed! We were initially seated within about 15 minutes, but we were given a table right by the door where people were constantly walking past and my husband and I would have constantly have been bumped into by people entering or exiting the restaurant. We asked for another table and it took another 15 minutes. It's my STRONG opinion that if you typically have customers waiting for tables (in your freezing cold waiting room - my toes were numb), you should accept reservations. Period. Thankfully, the food made up for our initial disappointing experience. While it wasn't my grandmother-in-law's home cooked goodness, it was quite delicious! We ordered all the Persian staples - tahdig, gaimeh bademjan, ghormeh sabzi, moost-a-kehyar, bademjan plate, adass polo, and three types of kebab. It was a feast! Being a vegetarian is sometimes frustrating at Persian restaurants, but not at this place. They have a section on the menu specifically dedicated to vegetarian dishes, and they graciously obliged when we asked for the bademjan to be served on the side of the tahdig so I could eat my favorite crispy rice! I think this is my favorite Persian restaurant in Chicago and prices are extremely reasonable. It was $88 for the four of us, and my hubby and I had enough leftovers for dinner tonight!

The décor is beautiful without being pretentious. The tile artwork is very eye-catching and welcoming. It lends a cheerful feel. The wait staff were excellently attentive.  Now, to the food! I ordered a chicken kabob and my dad ordered one of the ground meat kabobs. We were both very pleased. The kabobs were not only perfectly cooked (charred on the outside while still moist on the inside) and arrived on the most amazing rice ever...seriously.

2013-07-29,4.0,"My husband and I have been meaning to check this place out forever, but we finally made it here this past weekend. We arrived at the restaurant around 11:15 on Sunday and were the first people there, but we didn't mind. We were happy to have the place to ourselves. When we arrived, they brought us a pitcher of water, a basket of pitas, and a little tray of onions, parsley, radishes, and cheese. They were a nice little snack to munch on while we perused the menu.  We ordered an eggplant/mint/yogurt dip and then we ordered the Persian rice to share. Then we each got a kebab only plate (the other kebab plates come with rice but we already ordered a portion of rice so decided to do the kebab only plates). My husband got the Noon-O-Three plate and I got the Rib Eye steak kebab plate.   The eggplant dip was very tasty and was a nice little starter. It had a slightly smokey flavor and was very nicely spiced. When they brought out our entrees we were blown away by how huge the plates were. WOW! The meat was very juicy and was served along side a nice little cucumber/tomato salad. The Persian rice was totally addictive too. My husband doesn't even like lentils but he couldn't stop eating the rice. We had tons of leftovers to take home as well. Super tasty!",0.9922,0.821,0.168,0.01,0.690530303030303

2013-05-07,5.0,"I'm not one to become a ""regular,"" per se, at any establishment.  As a Yelper and foodie, I'm always on the hunt to constantly try new places.  Ask my friends and they turn to me to make dining decisions since I have probably already tried out and give my two cents on the restaurant they recommend.  Unfortunately (or fortunately), certain businesses like make me seem like a hypocrite.  One example would be Noon O Kabob.  While I have sampled countless Middle Eastern restaurants along Albany Park's Kedize Avenue, Noon O Kabob has become my ""go to"" place for authentic and delicious Persian cuisine. Here's a few tips from my regular (*swallowing deeply using that term*) visits: First, you MUST order the Tadig to begin your meal.  Tadig is a specialty prepared with tender, fluffy, fragrant rice covered with a thin, pale yellow, crunchy crust (see a picture here taken by Howard L.:  yelp.com/biz_photos/noon… ).  The crust is a balance between chewy and crunchy, with the crunchy part being only on the top layer, so you'll have to fight everyone at the table for the gold.  The rice base is then topped with a lamb or vegetable (I believe lentil) stew.  It's truly heaven and comes in two sizes depending on how big your party (or appetite) is.  I'm always tempted to order the Tadig as my meal, but always find myself ordering an entree anyway. If you feel ever so tempted, you can also order the more well-known smooth hummus topped with avocado oil, or the freshly chopped, aromatic tabouli salad.  Appetizer or not, every table is provided a basket of fresh white and wheat pita bread with delicious chunks of feta cheese, onions, and a parsley + cilantro mix to nibble one.   The entree I almost always find myself ordering (and taking left-overs home) is the Shrimp and Joujeh Koubideh combination (photo:  yelp.com/biz_photos/noon… ).  It is one skewer of lemon spritzed grilled jumbo shrimp, and a second skewer of seasoned ground chicken breast.  The meat is perfectly seasoned and grilled to perfection.  The dish comes with an assortment of skewered vegetables and either white or dill rice---of course, I recommend anything with dill. For my vegetarian friends, you can never go wrong with Persian/Middle Eastern food since there are always plenty of choices.  If you have a sweet tooth, the Shirin Polo sweet rice entree is delectable with a complex blend of flavors of orange, cinnamon, nuts, turmeric, and garlic (photo:  yelp.com/biz_photos/noon… ).  I always order it with another small side so my entree does not consist of just rice.  For instance, the pomegranate mushrooms pair perfectly ( yelp.com/biz_photos/noon… ).  Entrees may be viewed as slightly pricey ($13-18), but everything is freshly made-to-order and has authentic Persian spices and flair. My fellow Yelp fans know, I almost always start my reviews talking about alcoholic drinks and cocktails.  I guess this review is a new beginning since I'm a ""regular"" (*slight gag*) and talking about food before alcohol!  I absolutely love NOK's drink offerings that come in large glasses and last almost the entire meal, unless you suck it down like I do after a long day at work (don't believe me, check out the glass size here:  yelp.com/biz_photos/noon… ).  My top recommendations are the Pomegranate Mojito and more recently, the Pomegranate-Lemon Long Island Iced Tea. If you still have space to fill, you can order their Baklava that has just the right amount of sweet honey and pairs perfectly with a potent Persian coffee or mint Persian tea with sugar cubes!  I personally go across the street to Nazareth Sweets to get my baklava fix since I can get a box of mixed baklava (versus only two pieces) for the same price (view my review here:  yelp.com/biz/nazareth-sw… ). Instead, I recommend ordering a Bastani which is a Persian ice cream frozen into the shape of a cone.  They offer an always changing menu of Bastani flavors but sometimes have my favorites including Chocolate Hazelnut, Fig with Date Reduction, and Cherry Cheesecake. I'm sure I could write more about how much I love NOK, but I will stop here for now.  I could always write a review update if I really wanted to...   Take note that they have a parking lot for both restaurant and Noon O Kabob take-out patrons just south of the restaurant next door.  I think all they need now is Wi-Fi and outdoor patio seating to top the Yelp charts. If you're having a party requiring catering, or prefer to eat at home, check out Noon O Kabob Take-Out which has a slightly different menu:  yelp.com/biz/noon-o-kaba… .",0.9985,0.835,0.144,0.022,0.4704228009861812

2013-03-25,1.0,"Who woulda thunk it? The take out Noon O Kabab (which is located next door and has a slightly different menu) is SOOOO much better than the sit down restaurant (it has its own Yelp profile:  yelp.com/biz/noon-o-kaba… ). In fact (true story) my friend fell in love with Noon O Kabab entirely through their take out. She loved it so much that she once ordered it twice in a single day (the second time was for me). But wait! It gets better! My friend was so sure of her love affair with Noon O Kabab that she chose the restaurant for her birthday celebration!!! That's where this review comes in. We were all thankful that we had reservations because we had to go through a gauntlet of disgruntled waiting people who did naaaat seem to realize that we had reservations. They commented that they'd been waiting for a long time and that people who came after them were seated quickly. Oh well. I guess that's not the restaurant's fault. What I DID notice though is that the waiting area was atypical. There was no host station to help organize the queue. Also, they had a large rug display (on the floor and wall) with a sign that indicated that they buy hand knotted rugs. The interior of Noon O Kabab is jam packed. They had wall decorations along the back wall that protruded about two or three feet. They looked really nice but I questioned the use of space. There was a table that had some sort of display (maybe a shrine?) of a mirror and cups with food in them (like an apple and hard boiled eggs). There was also a bar. Between all of that (and the customary tables and chairs) the space seemed super squished. My friends ordered some drinks before I arrived and still hadn't gotten them. Soon after I got there, the server came over and asked if we'd like to order anything. I quickly asked about coffee. They had regular coffee but nothing special. I asked for it with some Bailey's and the server jumped to attention and left before anyone else could order appetizers or food. She brought my drink (still not my friends' drinks) and then took our appetizer and entree order. My friends commented that the menu was unfamiliar to them. They expected a replica of the take out menu and were chagrined that it was not. They found things to order. I asked the server about some spiced and baked cheese that I'd had at another Persian restaurant and I was disappointed that they didn't have any cheese on the menu. I got a Persian salad instead. Not only was the menu dissimilar from the take out version of Noon O Kabab but somehow the quality was also. My friends expected the food to be even better at the restaurant and were disappointed that it was less impressive. When my friends first started ordering from them they eagerly ordered for me and M as well. We agreed that the food was wonderful. One of my friends said that she normally eats her entire portion from Noon O Kabab take out and that at the restaurant she only ate half of it. I realize that I'm writing a lot about my friends' opinions and not my own. The truth of the matter is that I wasn't very hungry at the restaurant. I found my salad to be satisfying. I also found the service to myself to be disparately better than the service that my friends got. The server responded quickly to my drink orders and gladly answered my questions about the cheese. She was not the same way to my friends who were seated next to me at the same table. When it came to tipping there was a discussion about how we didn't want to tip nearly as generously as we usually do. I think that everyone was mostly surprised that the restaurant wasn't as delicious as their take out. We'll all probably continue to order the take out but avoid the restaurant.

2013-03-05,4.0,"This is the best Persian cuisine  restaurant in the Chicago area. The food is excellent and much more authentic with the right ingredients and no short cuts.  The portions are balanced and the meats come in the size, cut and properly cooked as it is done back home.  However, the service is more on the mid level, with times too much attention being paid and at times too little. They have always struggled with the right balance,  and I do not blame them for it as it is a family business.   But being a family run business should be viewed on its positive side as it means authentic, home style cooking. I absolutely recommend this place, if you want to try Persian food go to this place but try to go on a week day rather than busy weekends to get the right service and experiment. Expect to wait 15 min on typical rush hours on weekends. .. Recommendations;  Rule number 1; when it comes to rice, Iranians know it  Rule number 2; you do not question Iranians expertise and love of rice Rule number 3; if you do not like rice, persian style, you need to contact your physician asap Rule number 4; just don't mess with the Iranian waitress... BELIEVE ME..   Appetizers; Tahdig, crispy rice; you won't see this dish anywhere else in the world so don't miss it. Tahdig (transl. bottom of the pan) forms through slow cooking of Iranain rice. Mast o khiar: yougurt and cucumber,  similar to turkish and greek dishes. Drinks: for the bravest out there, get Dough (a carbonated yougurt drink! With salt and pepper.  If this sounds too scary go with the usual ""Cooka Kola"". Main dishes: for Rice:  Shirin Polo (Jewel / precious rice) a very time consuming rice. Comes with orange peels cut into thin strips (you have no right to question who eats orange peels until you have tried it! You want something new, right?) , barberries, various raisins,   and pistachios & saffron the most expensive spice in the world that per ounce costs more than gold! And cinnamon, but if you don't like something just ask without it.  Note;  this rice dish is sweet and very aromatic. If the above dish is not appealing than i would recommend  dill rice which is very addictive specially with well-grilled and well-done tomatoes.  (Why not asking for half of each; shirin polo & dill rice!) for red meat lovers; - koobideh is the standard ground beef (and some order chicken koobideh / ground chicken). Most Iranians who go to a restaurant order ground beef. - Sultani; sultani is some what higher ranked kebab (actuallt Kabob is the right persian pronunciation, but who cares...) it is one skew of koobideh and one skew of Barg ( slices of file mignon) for chicken lovers; -Joujeh; cornish hen marinated",0.9879,0.845,0.113,0.042,0.4896291208791209

They were all great, but the joojehyeh barg was a little dry. In my opinion Noon o Kabab is better than Reza's, but not as good as Raffi's in LA. The doogh was expensive at $3 for a slim glass, which couldn't have held more than 8 oz of liquid.

The food is mediocre and way overpriced, but the service is absolutely terrible.  We have always felt a little uneasy and unwelcome here, but our most recent visit was particularly awful. The restaurant was empty so they sat us by the window (great). 2 minutes later they asked if we would move tables with no explanation (wtf?). We moved to a new table and put out a bottle of wine. The waitress gave us a disapproving look, which prompted us to ask if the restaurant was a byob (we knew it was since we'd brought bottles the previous 2 times). She didn't reply and turned and walked away. Baffling. We sat for maybe 5 minutes before she returned and said, ""Do you know what you want yet?"" I know waitresses don't always have the time or energy to fuss over each table, but this waitress was simply hostile. We said we did not feel welcome and we walked out. Perhaps this is an isolated case of a waitress having a bad day. But it's enough for us to never return and to encourage our friends to stay away.  If the food were excellent and cheap then we'd probably overlook the service, but it isn't.

When our entree's arrived we asked for tahini or cucumber sauce for the kebob which is customary with these dishes (at least to my knowledge as I have always been served some variation of this sauce with this type of entree) and the waitress said they did not have tahini but a cucumber yogurt sauce? No problem, I am always up for a variation on a good idea. Their version of the sauce was actually pretty good, it came out in a bowl about the size of what I would eat oatmeal out of.

Check please.....WTF???? $5.95 for something with a name in what I assume to be Farsi and I cannot pronounce it so we ask the waitress and she says it was a charge for the yogurt sauce that was considered a 'salad' and NOT a condiment that came with the entree.

(Yes this review is for take away food) My friends asked if I had ever eaten here and I said, ""No!""  The crazy part is that I took out my iPhone and immediately searched this place on my Yelp Mobile App. It was so funny because I really didn't even think what I would have said if I looked at them and they only had one star...would it be rude for me to say ""that I am not hungry""?  I was so excited to see 4 stars for this place...I think I instantly got hungrier just knowing this fact. We had Koubideh which is a skewer of ground sirloin beef with Persian seasonings and Joujeh which is a skewer of marinated chicken breast charbroiled on an open fire. I had a hard time deciding which one I liked better because both were really good.  The chicken was juicy.  Sometimes charbroiled chicken be over cooked but not this chicken.  I also liked the ground beef too which was really good...I am not sure of the spices but they tasted so good. We also had two types of Persian Rice too...the white and the dill.  I really liked the white rice better then the dill rice.  Probably because I am not a huge fan of dill unless it is used on a pickle.  I was amazed at how the white rice did not stick to itself and was very yummy.  The charbroiled tomato was kind of boring...I am sad I even tried to eat it. There was also something that my friends told me was like hummus.  Of course, I had a nice big serving with the flat bread...only to find out later that there was eggplant blended into it.  Yeah I am allergic to eggplant but I was really surprised that I did not have a reaction to it.  My friends felt so bad and asked if they needed to call 911...I told them not yet!!!  We all had a good laugh! Sometimes a test of good food is how well it transports and I believe that this food held up.  In fact, the food was sitting on the counter for about 30 minutes as we all caught up and scrambled for drinks.  I was a little worried that my review of the food would be tainted because of it sitting in containers for too long.  But that was not the case.  In fact, I can hardly wait to sit down in this restaurant and eat here in person.  I also saw on there website that they have some really nice lunch specials too.",0.9957,0.777,0.167,0.056,0.5876477541371158

And then there are the tomatoes.  A charred tomato comes as a garnish on every kebab plate.  They are so amazing you can order extras in sets of 2 or 6.  At $2 for six extra tomatoes, it is an amazing deal, healthy and packed with so much flavor I can't imagine a better ""side"" to the kebabs and rice.  They're perfect. The one negative comment I have could just be personal preference, but I do find the baked desserts to be a bit too sweet.  One or two bites of any are the most I can eat.  That said, the ice creams are devine, particularly the strawberry and chocolate mint, which seem to have only the slightest amount of sugar acting as the perfect balance to the cream and highlighted ingredients. The portions are also very large.  My husband and I often will split a two skewer kebab plate.  Particularly with an appetizer, this is plenty of food for us for dinner or a late lunch, and 9 times out of 10 we have enough left over for a second meal for each of us.  I've read in some Yelp reviews that other places are cheaper, but when you consider that you could get four meals out of a $16 plate, that's a fairly unbeatable value.",0.9982,0.758,0.222,0.019,0.5436932348697053

2011-05-09,5.0,"First, please allow me to get this out: The food here is DE-LICIOUS!!!! Okay, thanks. Now moving on to the review *clears throat*... I've been wanting to eat here for some time. It's right off the Kedzie brownline stop so I'd always see it while passing it on the el. I'm part Middle-eastern so I always appreciate it when I find a good Middle-eastern restaurant. This place is Persian, though. But close enough for me. Sorry, too much backstory, I know... Point is, the food here was on point. Meat and chicken were tender, juicy, flavorful (man I am craving it all over again just thinking about it).... the rice was perfect (I had the dill rice, my significant other had the white-- both were scrumptous) Ordered hummus for an appetizer. Like I said, I'm part Middle-eastern, so I know good hummus when I taste it, and this was good hummus! Bread was warm, cut in convenient little triangles.  We went there for lunch and it was packed! (there's a free parking lot by the way.... though street parking is fairly easy) This was at around 2-ish. After standing awkwardly by the door for five minutes, and then moving inward towards the ""waiting area"" I guess you could call it, we were finally seated. The service was friendly and fast, despite how busy they seemed to be. Best of all, the owner (I think he was the owner?), this jolly fellow, asked us if it was our first time there, to which we replied ""why, yes, sir, it actually is!"" and so he said, ""by golly! we have some new comers! well, you must receive special treatment for joining us today!"" Five minutes later he gives us a 3-part platter with 3 different appetizers. So that was really nice. And those appetizers were very tasty indeed. The place has a warm, comfy feel. Nice decor and cozy set-up. The only thing lacking was a touch of background music... though the hum of coversation that hovered as we enjoyed the deliciousness that was our meal..... gave it a nice, communal feeling. You'd think all that chatter  would be annoying, but for some reason it surprisingly wasn't. I've been places where the chatter-filled ambience is unbearable. But I suppose because this place isn't huge, the volume factor was pretty controlled. And anyway, who knows, maybe their speakers were down that day or something. Either way, that was just a minor observation... one that did not deteriorate our experience one bit.  Do go there. I will, again, definitely.

2011-04-29,4.0,"After vowing to do a better job of taking advantage of the amazing array of dining options that Albany Park has to offer my wife and I made our first trek to this great neighborhood restaurant.  Noon-o-Kabab came highly recommended and we were not disappointed. While perusing the ample list of appetizers, we informed the waitress that it was our first time dining at the restaurant and asked if she had any particular recommendations.  Much to our delight she offered to bring us a complimentary sampler of two of her favorite appetizers (Kash-Ke-Bademjan and Caspian Eggplant).  Both are eggplant based dips/spreads served with pita bread.  While we likely wouldn't have chosen to order either, it worked out great because my wife learned she really does like eggplant!  The pitas came out hot, a must in my opinion, and both appetizers were delicious...and did I mention FREE.  What a great way to win over new diners. For our entrée we shared the Chenjeh (ribeye) and Joujeh (chicken) kabab combination.  We both loved the chicken - very well seasoned with traditional Persian seasonings and cooked perfectly with a beautiful grilled flavor.  We'll definitely order the chicken again when we return.  The ribeye kabab was less successful.  While the meat was flavorful it was a bit chewy for us.  I was a bit surprised that we were not asked how we'd like our beef cooked - it was done to medium-well - next time we'll specify medium-rare instead.  The dill rice that accompanies the kababs is highly recommended. Note that while certain ""combination plates"" are specified in the menu you can actually do any combination of kababs that you'd like.   After being tempted by the list of bastani, aka: ""Persian gelato"", sitting on our table for the entire meal we had to get some dessert!  We opted for the chocolate hazelnut bastani with candied walnuts.  While good, I would compare it more to a dense chocolate sherbet than gelato.  The candied walnuts were definitely the star of this dessert.  Since one dessert is never enough, we also got an order of Bomieh which was essentially fried dough, almost like mini churros, with a honey syrup.  These were too sweet for my tastes, which is saying something because I have quite the sweet tooth.  Having seen these come out to other tables throughout our meal it was my assumption that they were hot, but unfortunately they aren't.  To top off the meal I also had a cup of Persian tea, which was described as a blend of five different teas.  It was delicious, slightly sweet and with very herbal aroma and taste.  This I'll definitely get again. The service was friendly and helpful.  We also enjoyed the decor and the feel of the restaurant.  We'll definitely be back and with a few changes to our order I'm hoping for a 5-star review next time.",0.9975,0.797,0.189,0.014,0.57452828780415

The dill rice was nice, but the broiled tomato was a tasteless pile.  The pomegranate mushroom appetizer was very tangy, but lacked a grounding savory taste to keep it from being acidic.

Our waiter looked a bit nervous, but he was friendly nonetheless.   Yes...the price at this joint is a bit steep, but lemme tell ya, it's worth every penny. They do it right, all the ingredients are fresh and perfectly marinated and seasoned, and the portions are generous. I love the meat & poultry here. It's not overly salty and everything is so tender that you can cut your meat with a fork. The dill rice is something I've never tried at other Persian restaurants. It's a wonderful surprise.

As soon as we arrived, we were seated within 5 minutes. The great thing was that they have an attached parking lot (which was convenient given the snow). However, there is tons of street parking around as well. The one thing about this place that struck me initially is that it is in the middle of no where. As soon as you sit down, the waiter brought us pita and home made feta cheese (which was creamy and delicious). The ambiance was nice but not necessarily upscale. The menu was very large and caters to different tastes. The meats include lamb, chicken, beef, fish, and cornish hen. There is a wide selection for vegetarians as well. We ordered 2 appetizers, both of which were delicious. The subtle spices are very authentic but not overwhelming for the average diner.  The entrees were well sized and delicious as well. No complaints whatsoever. The desserts however were lacking (no biggie as we were forcing these down after all the food we had previously). Expect to spend about 25-30 a person if you have drinks, appetizers, entree, and dessert. The entrees themselves are about 14 dollars.

My experience has been phenomenal when ordering entrees.  I have yet to come across a dish I dislike.  The chicken is juicy and lean, the Chenjeh (Choice Rib Eye) is grilled to perfection, and the rice is extremely tasty.  I highly suggest going for one of the combination entrees, so that you can sample a few different meats.  You can make a combination plate out of any of the meats: Chicken, beef or lamb.   The food here is extremely healthy.  The meat is never salty, and the hummus is made fresh.  When I leave I feel full and happy, unlike some other restaurants where I leave full and hurting.  As long as you don't down all the rice, you shouldn't feel too bad! I do have to say that for dinner, the prices are a little out of my liking.  I like kabobs and I enjoy meat so most of the time I will order two skewers.  Combine that with the hummus and I'm pretty quickly over $20.  Regardless of the cost, my love for Noon-O-Kabob is strong.  The staff does an alright job, the food is INCREDIBLE, it's pretty healthy, and the price isn't too bad.

2010-10-24,4.0,"Baba Ganoush and char grilled pita on the table within 5 minutes of sitting down?  While Noon O Kabab is not a small restaurant, the waitstaff succeeds in making it feel that way through their warm attentiveness.  Upon sitting down we were welcomed with a spread of creamy feta cheese, fresh onions, and char grilled pita.  We immediately placed our appetizer order for a small baba ganoush and hummus. Almost instantly both arrived at our table.  The baba ganoush was well seasoned and the deep flavor of the eggplant was showcased without any of the bitterness eggplant often brings.  This was definitely the better appetizer; I liked the hummus but it wasn't too robust of a flavor- a delicate hummus if you will. I personally prefer a stronger flavor with more seasoning but it was still good, but compared to the baba ganoush it was no contest.  Everyone at the table ordered kabobs- chicken, rib eye (!), ground sirloin, and shrimp.  All were seasoned and cooked very well, with the shrimp being cooked just a bit too long, but still delicious.  The rib eye really stole the show.  The velvety cutlets were cooked perfectly and had a buttery texture.  The chicken with a squirt of lemon was tangy and succulent.  The sirloin did not dry out as this dish often will.  Again, all dishes were perfectly seasoned- which makes the lack of seasoning in the hummus all the more confusing.  Now I would have been happy with the kabobs alone, but the dill rice brought the dishes to another level.  Get the dill rice, not the regular rice.  Seriously, the dill adds such a deep, somehow subtle, flavor that makes this more than a rice side dish.  One area of possible improvement is the plating.  The kabobs, a nice pile of rice, and roasted tomatoes are gorgeous but there was an empty portion of my plate that would have benefited greatly even from some cilantro or parsley.  Other than that and the hummus, I am a huge fan of Noon O Kabab.",0.9925,0.767,0.172,0.06,0.5650689588189587

We had a roasted eggplant appetizer, a traditional Persian soup (can't remember the name but it's the only one on the menu) and their vegetarian platter.  All 3 items were individually amazing in their own right.  The flavors were all unique and perfectly balanced.  The smoky flavor of the eggplant was present but not overpowering.  The Persian soup had, to my palate, a bizarre combination of ingredients that my mouth had not experienced before.  I think  there were noodles, beans, pomegranate, etc...?  So good though.  And so unique for someone that doesn't eat a lot of Perisian food. Which brings me to the main course, the veggie platter.  This had a big mound of rice with some roasted vegetables and mushrooms that had been marinated and grilled (or roasted) in a tangy sauce.  Don't get me started on this rice!  I don't usually get excited about rice.  But this was special rice.  I would have been happy eating that rice, and that rice alone, for the entire meal.  Or week!  It  was sweet, had raisins in it, and maybe some orange... Basically, I don't know what was in it.  But I didn't care, or take the time to stop shoveling it in my mouth to look on the menu.  The veggies were good, but nothing unusual compared to the rice which was really outstanding.  All in all, a flavor party in your mouth.  Couldn't have been happier.  Can't wait to try it out again and get their saffron gelato!",0.9904,0.789,0.158,0.053,0.672943722943723

After our drinks arrived, we waited at least 30 minutes only to have a different server come by to check on us and take our orders, and then halfway through our meal, I saw our original server taking a order from the table next to us. It was all quite confusing.   It's a shame that the service was so bad, the food was amazing. I ordered the combo dinner. It came with a skewer of Beef, a Skewer of Steak and the most delicious, dill rice I ever had. The strange thing is the Beef was actually better than the Steak. The Steak was good, but the Beef was amazing. It was spiced to the nines with Mediterranean goodies. Top-Notch Stuff!!

In fact, stop reading this and just get some.  However you want to get it, take-out.  They have an online ordering system that is just so easy to use, though on Grubhub it might a little daunting for a newb to order, but go directly to their site and see pictures and detailed explanations of everything, and you can still order directly without Grubhub.  You can dine in, the service is like you are dining in someone's house and they just can not tolerate you leaving without feeling welcomed and stuffed, and perish the thought of your glass going below half empty.  The dinning room itself is gorgeous.  This is a fantastic place to take a date or impress the folks from out of town. If you are worried about said folks being intimated by Persian food, relax, they speak the universal language of Rib Eye (only in Persian it's called Chenjeh) and I'd say it's a must-get, but you really should try one of each. Really. I regularly ordered the Rib Eye, Ground Beef, Ground Chicken, and Chicken.  I see there are lamb and shrimp kababs, and realize my horizons need expanding. I've tried the Filet Mignon, but am so addicted to the stuff that costs even less that I usually don't bother, but that doesn't mean it isn't good either, I only need to save my $$$ the rest of the menu.   And what a rest of the menu it is.  The breads are fabulous, made on the premises and worth saving room for and the $0.60 to get extra if you are ordering humus.  If you are still reading this and haven't place your order yet (why, I'm not sure, but thank you) even the RICE is good.  The RICE, seriously, who writes a good review about RICE? That's just ridiculous!  But it's the truth.  The Dill Rice is worth writing home about, as I am doing now, and they give you a ton of it.  Though I like mixing it up and having one order one dish with Dill and one dish with plain, naturally you need to eat family style here to sample everything.   Everything I've had here, is something I'd order again, right now, if it wasn't so rich for my wallet.  I've tried the Persian salad, Baba Gannouj, Caspian Eggplant Salad (that converted my wife to eggplant), Dolmeh, Lamb Shank, and of course, all of the desserts.  The Baklava is a must!",0.9672,0.812,0.112,0.077,0.5647084011667345

We were immediately greeted with warm pita bread and a variety of fixin's to go with it. We ordered hummus which was sooooo creamy and amazing! I had a glass of Pinot Noir with dinner.  I got the chicken and ground beef combo kababs and my friend got the same except added a kabab of lamb. Both of us enjoyed the dill rice (mmmmmmmmm.....) and stuffed ourselves stupid. His lamb was cooked perfectly and all the kababs had a wonderful grill flavor. The chicken was tender and not chewy as grilled chicken can sometimes be.

Noon O Kabab has some pretty good selections, and I give it an A for effort since it does try to set itself apart from the other Mediterranean/Persian restuarants in the city and on this strip.  I went with a friend of mine and split the hummus which was pretty good. A smooth consistency and a pretty tasty standout. I had the Fesenjan which is a pomegranate stew with chicken. I ordered it because it was something different....well like I said, A for effort.  My friend went with a more traditional approach and got the steak and chicken kabob combination.

Their kabobs are always tender and juicy and worth coming back for.  Their eggplant appetizer is also really tasty.  There are not many options for vegetarians, but they do have a few options on the menu that I'd definitely eat if I wasn't going to choose a kabob.  If anyone is debating on whether to go to Reza's or noon o kabob, debate no longer, Reza's is very much like a chain restaurant and their kabobs lack the rich flavor that Noon o kabob delivers in all of their dishes.  I used to go to Reza's because that was the only place available, but now that noon o kabob is in business, there is no way I'd ever go back to Reza's.   Noon o kabob is a small place, but it makes it very intimate and personalized, which is why the service is so efficient.

Noon O Kabab made it to such a list recently. Situated in the the largely ethnic section of Albany Park, flanked by dollar laundry and grocery stores, it was in every way a complete contrast to the typical downtown dining scene.  The restaurant does not have a wine list but warmth and genuine hospitality flowed in abundance. From the cute and flirtatious young waiter that gave us great food recommendations (even though he needed a few reminders to get those to the table), to our gorgeous Middle Eastern hostesses that sat down to talk to us and graciously accommodated unplanned guests - everyone aimed to please and did so with a rare authenticity that was immensely appealing.  I saved the best for the last - the food. We started with the hard to pronounce, but easy to gobble down appetizer - Kash-Ke-Bademjan. Think Bhaba-ganouj with a different better twist. I had a Shirin Polo for my main course - a very colorful, sweet and sour rice based dish with was as fascinating for the eye as it was for the palate.

2009-10-20,4.0,"I was excited to try Salam for the first time over the weekend so I was pretty disappointed to find out they were closed for renovations. However, in the tradition of turning lemons into lemonade, I discovered Noon-o-Kabab. I was looking for something quick so when I saw Noon-o-Kabab's take out annex across the street (I think they also run their catering business out of there) I figured it was worth a shot. When I walked in I was immediately greeted by the elderly owner who insisted I have some tea while I wait for my order. I have to say sipping the aromatic tea (with a sugar cube under my tongue) was the perfect way to pass the time while they grilled up my kabobs. I was in the mood for Lebanese food when I walked in so I ordered the hummus and the baba ghannoush, though in hind sight I wish I had ordered the more authentically Persian dishes. Nonetheless both were quite good. The hummus was smooth and creamy, though not as garlicky as I like it. The baba was the best I've had in Chicago (granted I haven't had too many good babas in Chicago). Smokey and spiced, with just enough olive oil flavor to carry the strong smoked eggplant flavor. They were served with excellent and soft pita bread that was perfectly charred on the edges. I've had so much bad pita in Chicago I couldn't tell you how happy I was to get some fresh bread. I did order some Persian dishes too. I got an order of the borani which was made with creamy, thick yogurt and plenty of garlic. Of course, the main attraction was the kubideh (similar to kofte). The meat was tender and blended perfectly with light onion and spices. The key to great kubideh is to let the taste of the grilled ground beef do the talking, and this version was right on the money. It was served with either saffron rice or dill rice, so naturally I asked for half and half. The rice was fluffy and buttery but not swimming in oil which would've over powered the meat. And of course the grilled tomatoes were exactly what a proper kubideh needs on the side. I'm still looking forward to visiting Salam but I can't say I'm at all disappointed to happen across Noon-O-Kabab. It was quick, affordable, and delicious.

We just love all the tile mosiac art pieces. The chairs at our table are padded and so comfortable. The service is extremely friendly and attentive.  First we order the Hummus for our appetizer. This was just ok, nothing really special. Knowing that Semiramis (another restaurant I have reviewed earlier) is just over the tracks, less than a block away, I am longing for their Hummus which was outstanding! We also ordered the Saffron Chicken soup which was truly tasty. The soup had so much flavor and was really fresh and good.  Then for our main course the four of us each order the Barb Kabab, a thin fillet minon with rice and grilled tomatoes. Maria and my son got the white rice with saffron. My daughter and I got the dilled rice with saffron. We all thought our main course was again just average, nothing special to write home about. We did all agree though that the white rice was better than the dilled rice.  Finally for dessert Maria ordered the Baklava. She said she ""loved it"". She thought it was very fresh.  Overall we did think the pita bread was good. And the tea was very flavorful. But the price tag seemed very high. Our bill came to roughly $86 dollars. Would we go back or recommend Noon O Kabab, maybe if we ordered a different main course item the next time.",0.9916,0.798,0.165,0.037,0.49377992277992283

I've had just about everything on the menu and here are some of the dishes I would highly recommend: aash (traditional Persian soup with spinach, cilantro, lentils, and noodles) kash ke bademjoon (eggplant with mint and onions), koubideh (ground beef skewer) with dill rice, barg (marinated filet mignon), lamb shank (which absolutely melts in your mouth), joujeh (boneless chicken breast skewers), and bomieh for dessert (kind of like fried dough dipped in honey syrup). They also have some great combination plates so you can try two different things. Portions are generous. The service here may be more or less attentive at times but that is because this is a mom and pop shop, not a chain restaurant, and they do the best they can. Also, I'm really disappointed by some of the negative reviews on here because if you don't like a place, you should be able to articulate why you didn't like it and those reviewers have not.

Having just settled into my August sublet this Wednesday, I hadn't had a chance to go grocery shopping and I had some friends coming by on short notice. Clueless to my surroundings, my boyfriend flipped on his Yelp ap with blind faith, found Noon O Kabab, and prayed that I wouldn't have to write any one star reviews. We'd planned on timing a booze and snack run with us ordering. After ordering, they informed us that our food would be ready in 15 minutes and were nice enough to honor my request to hold off starting our food for another 15 minutes. As a result, the food was hot and fresh when we arrived back just over 30 minutes later. I ordered the shrimp kabab plate with the dill rice. The shrimp were plump and juicy, but the dill rice was the most delicious part of the dish. There was a 3:1 ratio of dill to rice and the butter and lime added nicely to the flavor. It was the best rice side I'd ever tried. There was absolutely no need for any other seasoning. I wish I could ask about everyone else's skewers, but they were gone long before the appropriate ""that looks good"" (aka, I'd like to try a bite) remarks could be made. In the end we were all left with the massive portion of dill rice that none of us could finish despite being universally loved. It was served two inches deep in the standard 8 inch by 8 inch styrofoam takeout container and luckily reheated nicely as a side item for today's lunch.

It is certainly tighter and they try and jam in some cheesy quasi Western/Middle Eastern decor that may come off tasteful.  Hmm, don't sit by the door during the cold months, apparently limited in space, they don't have a double door. Funny, they try to be pseudo elegant and weren't willing or were to stupid to give up a table for a double door. Anyway, not pleasant trying to eat a decent piece of meat and have a glass of wine with a brush of cold air every few minutes. It ruins the whole experience, go during the summer months or ask to be seated in the back.  The Food, if you had Middle Eastern before, it is the same shtick. The sides are fine, but the meat is the attraction for me. Since they have a new take out kitchen by the tracks were the parking lot is, it makes it so tempting to forgo the the sit down.

2009-04-23,5.0,"WHAT WERE WE THINKING? We'd been going to a few different Middle Eastern style restaurants, more conveniently located to our home. Yet, none of them could compare to the the perfect Persian provender of Noon O Kebab!  The food here is excellent. The Hummus and Baba Ghannouj were fresh, light, silky smooth and accompanied by just-from-the-oven naan. Next, we had the Koubideh combo: one skewer of seasoned ground beef and one of seasoned ground chicken, both flavor-filled, melt-in-your-mouth, meat treats! I threw in an extra lamb kabob, which was also throw-away-the-steak-knife tender and succulent. The kabobs were served with light and fluffy Persian white or dill rice and slightly charbroiled tomato wedges. The Baklava for dessert, was a nice, sweet ""night cap"" to this Persian fare.  Additionally, they have a decent wine and beer selection. For beer drinkers, skip the Turkish Efe Pilsner and try the Argentinian Quilmes or Brazilian Palma Louca Lagers.  The entire staff is extremely nice, welcoming and accommodating. Our server was a bit absent for the 2nd half of the meal, but a couple of other servers noticed and came to her aid - so, thank you to them.

My fav appetizer (in addition to the free feta, beet and onion plate they give every table) is the Oloveih, which is similar to a chicken salad that you eat with pita bread but 10x better!  I usually get the shrimp and chenjeh (ribeye) combo which also comes with a side of grilled tomatoes, onions and green peppers and your choice of white, dill or white/dill rice.  I love that the servers ask you what temperature you want the meat to be and its never too tough or dry.  The shrimp has a light flavor but squeeze a little bit of lemon on and it helps intensify the flavor.  This is really fattening but I also love to melt the butter onto the rice (which has a light sprinkle of saffron). A meal for two people (appetizer and two entrees) usually costs us about $35 + tip and tax which is pretty decent for a nice Friday dinner but the awesome thing is that Noon O Kabob is now part of  restaurant.com .

UPDATE: Just realized that if you go east of the parking lot I mention in this review, Noon O Kabab has a SIT-DOWN restaurant! I must give it a try! Otherwise, this is a review of their carry-out facility. Noon O Kabab, located pleasantly next to the street level Kedzie Brown line stop is a gem I wish I discovered sooner. You have no reason not to somehow get here via El, street parking, or private lot parking to eat their food. Forewarning though, this place is a carry-out/delivery place. If you choose to dine in, you'll have to fight for the two tables in the front. The private parking lot is also tiny and may involve some creative car maneuvering to escape.  For a little less than $40, my family ordered the Joujeh Soltani (Chicken Soltani) which was one skewer of ground chicken and one skewer of chicken breast over dill rice; the Salmon plate which is one skewer of salmon over dill rice; and two skewers of vegetables. Oh my goodness the portions are HUGE. I think each entree came with two cups of rice! And imagine two skewers of chicken nearly covering all of that rice! As for taste, the dill rice was light, flavorful and well...addictive. And the salmon skewer was simply mouth watering (as their menu had recommended). Next time I'll try their desserts.

I told her some of the reviewers need to get a life criticizing someone who is doing everything necessary to make our dining experiences as pleasant as possible.   We had the lamb shank/dill rice and aash soup along with a fine wine she recommended.  For dessert she suggested a lovely Persian sponge cake filled with a delicate creme surrounded by chocolate swirls.  Just enough for the two of us.  Nice restaurant with pleasant surroundings and plenty of street parking.",0.9755,0.813,0.158,0.029,0.6287698412698413

Chicken skewer was also tasty but the ribeye, not so much.  Next time we'll probably get a veggie skewer in its place. I'm a big fan of rice so I got the combination of both kinds.

I was.  Completely.  I changed my order to the Shirin Polo after my waitress balked slightly at my first request (the Zucchini Plate).  I must have made the right choice because she smiled widely and commended me.  ""Good choice.""   It was a good choice.  Grilled mushrooms, tomatoes and green peppers topped a rice dish mixed with golden raisins, shredded carrots, and a sweet (but not too sweet) orange peel jam.  It probably could have been stretched into two meals, but it was so delicious that I only left behind a few spoonfuls (which I had boxed and ate the next day).  When I go back, I fully intend to order the exact same thing. Service was a little spotty.  Our waitress seemed to forget about us for a while, but the bus servers stepped up and cleared the table.  When the waitress remembered us and came back to the table, she was surprised to find that our table had been bussed and that we were just sitting and waiting to order coffee and a small sampling of desserts.  She got right back on the horse and did a fine job overall. I'm not an expert on Persian food but after a few dozen more visits to Noon O Kebab I hope to be.",0.9901,0.862,0.125,0.013,0.46568223443223433

I will definitely be returning soon for dinner, as they seemed to have an excellent selection of fish and more authentic dishes.

Kedzie Ave and there was a whiff of a little lamb in the air (Mary would have been SO freaked), she came across Noon O Kabab.  Busting into the joint ala Hansel & Gretel, she ordered a lovely plate of shrimp and beef rather than take a bite out of the wall.  The shrimp and beef were grilled to perfection, sweet and succulent, cozied upon the plate next to the most delicious food in the world, dill rice.   Of course the waitstaff could not have been more charming and efficient, (unlike the mean old stepsisters who would have had her washing the floor), and everyone around her looked like they were having a fabulous time.  Well then the wolf came by and tried to huff and puff and blow the house down, but the owners at Noon O Kabab were smart and built their house out of brick, with gorgeous tile mosaic accents inside.  So wolfy was out of luck.  I think they may have thrown him a bone though.  The moral of this story is this:  sure, sample around and get a taste from other places.  But you will be back here I promise, since other places will be too hot, others too cold, but Noon O Kabab will be Just Right.",0.9969,0.772,0.222,0.006,0.5757539682539684

2008-01-03,5.0,"There's very little--if anything at all--that I would change about this restaurant: + very reasonable prices for... + well executed, balanced food + exceptional service I have been disappointed by Reza's for the last time; this shall be the restaurant I frequent for Middle Eastern or Persian fare. On my last visit, our waiter recognized my lady and me from our visit last month.  It's a very small thing, but that went a long way with me.  That particular waiter is very hospitable, and the pride he has in his job is reflected by maintaining very high degrees of helpfulness and consideration while never being overbearing or ""chummy"" in the slightest.  He was our waiter on both visits, so I cannot speak of the other staff. The menu is varied, and the menu card itself is helpfully organized by meat type (as seems the tradition in MIddle Eastern and other restaurants).  None of the flavors in any of the dishes were out of proportion or too subtle.  Slow-roasted means slow-roasted, with all bits of a lamb shank's muscle and connective tissues rendering an unmistakeable flavor while retaining all its natural moisture.  Swordfish is hard to get wrong, but is positively remarkable if done right.  Here, thin filets of fish are charbroiled and provide a great balance of delicate fish and delectable carbon, without being oily or greasy.  The yogurt drink dough might be a bit much for some, but it was refreshing enough to warrant a whole pitcher. Unlike Karen L., I most certainly did *not* feel like I was in someone's house.  That distinction would go to a restaurant like Podhalanka, but Noon O Kabab brought an altogether different, more professional, well-polished and -practiced experience with clear strengths in the food and service departments, and no serious weaknesses to keep me from coming back.",0.9921,0.792,0.163,0.045,0.4706353383458648
