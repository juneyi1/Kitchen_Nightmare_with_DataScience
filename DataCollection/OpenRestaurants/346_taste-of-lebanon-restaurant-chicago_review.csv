Taste of Lebanon is unassuming on the outside but don't be fooled, the food is fantastic. Here's what I like: - Lentil soup (simple, but delectable)  - Chicken chawarma wrap (meat is juicy and special sauce is delicious) - Hummus (yum) - Baba ghannouj (double yum) - Falafal (crunchy on the outside, flavorful on the inside) - Baklava (it's dripping in honey, my mouth is watering just thinking about it) The food is super cheap but it's a cash-only establishment (boo!) and there isn't a lot of seating, so I always order it as takeaway.

It's not just that the food tastes good...what's special is that the restaurant has high standards for creating the best version of a dish, even if it's served on plastic plates. For example, the Combo #2 has felafel and includes tehina as a dipping sauce. It has salad but adds tabouleh, cucumbers, tomatoes, hot peppers, marinated radishes, and other unusual vegetables. The grape leaves are stuffed with a creamed rice that is soft and fragrant.  Everything is good here. Don't miss the shawarma that's made in the Lebanese style, on a large flat bread rolled up with the precision of Cuban cigars. The flavor includes a light touch of either nutmeg, cinnamon or something exotic.  I'm also partial to the baklava here.  It's carefully made and not too sweet and costs all of $1.15.

The base is a combination of fresh romaine lettuce, sliced cucumbers and tomatoes. Next, they top it with perfectly cooked and seasoned chicken. There is something about their chicken that gives it an extra something makes you want MORE! Whatever it is I effing love it!! Now, to bring it all together they use this tangy, lemony dressing and they drizzle some olive oil on top of everything to make sure the lettuce gets nicely coated. At least, that is how it was when I did take out  And let me say because I did take out..hot chicken on top of cold lettuce?..yeah, not a good combo. I did not know they served it like this because it was my first time coming here so that's on me. Normally, I would not eat this but I was hungry. It was glorious.

Taste of Lebanon is a very unassuming restaurant with good quality, super affordable food. I try to eat from here at least twice a month because their lentil soup and chicken shawarma are very good for the price. Their portions are reasonable, and you can walk out of this place having spent $8 dollars on a meal fit for a king. I will emphasize that the food is excellent for the price. Yes, compared to Dawali in Lincoln Park, Taste of Lebanon is nowhere as good. But if cheap eats is what you're after, then definitely go for this.

(Search ""mushy"" in their reviews and you'll see what I'm talking about.) Tahini sauce, ordinary. Tabouli, wrong ratio of parsley to bulgur wheat. And the same unripe tomatoes and unpeeled cucumber as everywhere else. The lentil soup is nothing special. I know what folks write about it here-- it can't be taken seriously.

I asked the nice man at the counter which one was his favorite and he told me that both were good but chicken is the most popular. I then pressed him for his favorite and he suggested the lamb kafta. Why didn't I think of that? I looked at him and said, ""Yes let's do that!"" I also asked if he could make it spicy and he said yes. The prices weren't bad either. A Lamb Kafta wrap was only $3.99 which is a great deal.  My wife went with the vegetarian combo special #1 for $5.99 which included Falafel, hummus, Baba Ghanoush, fresh vegetables, tahina sauce & pita bread. We also ordered a bowl of Fresh Lentil Soup for only $2.49.  After placing our order we went to our table and waited. The nice man who took our order also delivered our food to us. We had arrived before lunch which was nice and relaxed but the closer we got to noon the larger the crowd got. I was so glad that we didn't come during the lunch rush. We were able to relax and enjoy our food.  Our lentil soup with pita bread arrived first. I really liked it but I would not say it was the best lentil soup I've ever had. I liked the fact that it was not boiling hot. I hate getting soup that takes two days to cool off. I enjoyed the sweetness of the red lentils and it gave this soup a uniqueness.  I really loved my lamb kafta. I was so happy he suggested it. I was very happy that there was lamb in every bite. I've had kafta wraps before where it's mostly veggies and no meat. That drives me crazy. I was also happy with the level of spiciness and the freshness of the vegetables. I would definitely come back for this.  My wife loved her vegetarian combo. I was a lucky recipient of the food she couldn't finish. The hummus was very good. I loved the level of smokey flavor and believe it must be the smoked paprika that was served with it. I must also give high marks for the falafel. I love falafel but finding a good one is hard. This falafel was moist and soft on the inside. I hate it when falafels are dry and taste like gritty sand inside. This place gets how to make a good falafel. I was also impressed with the nice crispy outside and the yummy tahina sauce on top. I would also come back for the hummus and the falafel. I saw a wrap that includes both and I may have to try that.  This place was a hidden gem. Thanks to all of the Yelpers that directed me here. Your reviews and photos really made me want to eat here and you did not steer me wrong.

I decided to get the beef schwarma wrap, no onions because I pretty much loathe them. My friend got the same thing. The first few bites were good but after that I kinda got bored with it and the sauce was a bit too tangy in a sense for my taste(I am very picky when it comes to sauces and such). On the other hand my friend was crazy about his wrap.  The wrap was put together nicely, just the right amount of everything and the beef was good. It just wasn't for me, but I can be a stickler when it comes to food.

If you're feeling fancy (which face it you are because its the MOTHA-FUCKING-HOLIDAYS!!!) you get some baklava. SHIT IS GOOD.  But no really...this place is the best thing about Andersonville. Its cheap (but not because it is low quality but because it realizes that an inflated price doesn't mean you are good. it just means that you probably won't be around in two years because no one goes to your spot more than once). It is fast. But most importantly because the lentil soup is seriously the best in the city.,0.9291,0.801,0.128,0.071,0.583953373015873

I did live in the middle east for over a year, and I toured around.  This is acceptable falafel.  For you, take it to mean it's great falafel.

Now, you're probably thinking: chicken salad? Really? You're FAVORITE thing?? But it's not like it sounds. The chicken salad at Taste of Lebanon is not the gross mayonnaise-y diced chicken salad you're imagining. It's really a fresh, tangy, simple, vinegary salad (think iceberg, tomatoes, cucumber, I ask for no onions) with seasoned chicken sitting perfectly on top. The chicken is warm, right off the grill. They chop it up into tiny pieces to maximize flavor. The delectable meat mixes in with the lemony dressing and it is truly perfection.  As if having the best salad EVER on the menu isn't enough, this place is also a total bargain. The salad might be the ONLY thing on the menu that is more than 5 bucks, but it's the size of your face, so that seems more than fair. It's true, the lentil soup is pretty bomb and all the regular standbys are great: falafel, hummus, shwarma, baba g...ALL good. But don't be fooled by the misleading ""chicken salad"".

This place is extremely affordable, and I would be lying if I said I didn't raid the couch once or twice for soup money.  It's the best damn lentil soup I've ever had in my life - and I went through kind of a lentil soup phase for a while. But enough, everyone raves about the soup, this is not news. Get the soup. You won't be sorry.  The first time I had a falafel here I was a little surprised because I'd never had one in the super thin flatbread before. It's definitely a little different. Not different bad, just different. It reminds me of a larger, more savory version of a salt tafty that's been rolled up in parchment paper. It's sort of long and thin and actually much less messy to eat than a ""typical"" falafel. Having said that though, I don't mind messy food, and so I prefer the pita falafels.  The place is pretty spartan. I kind of love the lemonade stand counter look, though. I love the sweet person behind the counter even more, last time I was here it was a really nice guy who had a soccer game on tv and we chatted for a bit and I found a piece of baklava in my to go bag with a smiley face :)  That little sweet gesture won my everlasting loyalty.

Andersonville is chock-full of great Middle-Eastern places and this small store front restaurant has never grabbed my attention. That is because I have my favorites there and I know I will consistently get a great meal from them. Taste of Lebanon(TOL) really changed my perception and I really enjoyed my meal there. It was a brisk afternoon in Chicago and after a quick walk around some Andersonville shops, I was in the mood for a hot and hearty bowl of soup. I saw all my regular standbys, but chose TOL's cozy storefront instead. There is an inside walk-up counter with an easy to read large print menu and the food is relatively cheap. I read $2 Lentil Soup, $3 Falafel Wrap and $1 Soda Pop. I ordered just that and sat down. The gentleman at the counter brought out the Lentil Soup to my table (I was waiting to hear someone call out that my order was ready). The soup came out piping hot and also came with four delicious and chewy pieces of pita bread. The Lentil Soup was savory, fresh, slightly lemony and delicious. The portion was big, for the mere $2 dollars I spent.  I also ordered the Falafel Wrap with Baba Ganoush and that came out about a minute after the soup. The wrap was really good. There were about 5 pieces of crispy falafel, wrapped up with fresh lettuce, tomato, tahini sauce and their delicately smoky baba ganoush. After getting baba ganosh and tahini all over my face, I cleaned up with the provided napkins and headed out feeling full and comforted. Don't be fooled by the facade.

Granted, I've only had a few things on the small menu at this tiny, hole in the wall cash-only spot on Foster, but I just haven't been blown away. Would I stop here if I was hungry for a cheap Middle Eastern wrap if I was in the neighborhood? Sure would. But, would I come out of my way to come here knowing there are better spots no too far away from me? Naw. Look, I love Middle Eastern food, especially those that are Lebanese. Taste of Lebanon is known for their lentil soup and their chicken shawarma wraps and since these items are some of my favorites I make it a point to come out there a few times. The lentil soup is good. Pretty good there, but really, I was expecting to be blown away. Maybe it was the day I was there but the soup was a little too watery and bland for me.  It had potential, it wasn't that bland, really, but I like my lentil soup a little creamier (see Larsa's or the Afghani spot in Skokie, Kabul House). I love love love love love chicken shawarma and I was excited to get one in wrap form. I've fallen in a hard ass love with the chicken or beef shawarma special sandwich at Semiramis in Albany Park and I was excited to try another sammy in wrap form.  I thought that the reviewers could not be wrong and when you add hummus to the sandwich and then drop some hot sauce other I'd be tap dancing with a sandwich in my hand outside of Taste of Lebanon trying to get some change for another one. Not so. The sandwich was kind of a disappointment. It's a big sammy, but not big on flavor. What am I missing? I'm not sure if it's me but I'm not seeing it. The chicken on all three occassions was rather bland and a bit on the drier side. The wrap itself was also bland and so was the hummus! Oh dear. I was so excited to have found another cheap spot, but not so. Oh well, I will continue on my search. Well, I don't really need to search, I've found some favorite spots, but I like to eat Middle Eastern food so much I will continue to on this adventure.",0.998,0.717,0.221,0.062,0.5771790587580061

I've been stuffing my face with hummus and falafel for over a decade now, and have hit up just about every Middle Eastern joint in town, from the little dives on Devon to Pita Inn, Sultans Market, and everywhere in between. BUT. I had never REALLY had middle eastern food until i moved to ravenswood and started coming to taste of lebanon. I had rode past it on my bike many a time, and I will admit, was a little scared off for a split second. From the outside, it looked a little dingey. Thank God my fat ass got the best of me one day, and demanded I order food. I probably wasnt even hungry that day! what taste of lebanon lacks in atmosphere is compensated for ten times over with its deliciousness. BEST FALAFEL SANDWICH ON EARTH!!!!! i kid you not. once youve had a taste of lebanon wrap, you will never be able to eat a falafel sandwich from anywhere else ever again without thinking, 'this would be soooooo much better if it was from taste of lebanon.' The key to their wraps is the wrap itself- rather than overload the sandwich with a huge pita which tends to overpower the other ingredients, they use that really flat bread, i cant remember what its called. It wraps so tightly and really lets the filler ingredients shine through. My favorite is the baba gannoush/falafel wrap, but i must also mention the lentil soup. holy shit, it is the BOMB!!!!!!! just trust me. Their ingredients seem to epitomize freshness- lemon, fresh parsley, cracked black pepper, olive oil, the most colorful veggies....did i mention the prices? theyre absolutely unbeatable. My boyfriend and I come here and get soup, a HUGE fattoush salad, two wraps, two sodas, and baklava, and our total is always under $20. and we always have a ton of food leftover.

I find myself coming here more frequently toward the end of the month, when my bank account starts to thin out... a falafel wrap comes to about $4 and is plenty filling, and sometimes (I think this might depend on the personal whim of the person behind the counter) you will find a complimentary piece of baklava tucked into your to-go bag. This always makes my night. The taste experience is not mindblowing, but it definitely does the trick. The lentil soup is thick, spicy, and the cheapest way (at $3 or so) to hush your grumbling stomach, and although I have suspicions that it may not be vegetarian, no way am I going to ask and ruin it for myself. My advice: eat it all in one sitting because it doesn't make for good leftovers. There is something distinctly unappetizing about the way greasy day-old lentil soup plops into the microwaveable bowl while still retaining the shape of the styrofoam container whence it came. Even so, that hasn't stopped me from coming back for more, and that should really tell you something. One more thing--I love the guys that work here!  Once I was disappointed to find that they had run out of lentil soup an hour before closing, and I couldn't be talked into buying anything else, such was my sorrow.

And voilá: best falafel-hummus wrap ever.  Usually I'm all excited about falafel-hummus wraps because I'm in the mood for something healthy and fresh, and then I can't eat more than half of it because the hummus is too sharp and cloying after awhile.  Not so with this one.  It tasted fresh the whole time, and the pita was thin yet robust, so it held the sandwich together but didn't overwhelm it with bread.  I even didn't pick out my tomatoes, which I usually do. Dan's lamb kebob was almost equally tasty, with the same perfect ratio of bread to filling, and very flavorful meat, but I have had better.  Probably not for $3.99 though. If we had known our sandwiches would be so filling, we would definitely not have also ordered the fool mudammas, but we are adventuresome!  We like to eat things that we've never heard of, and be surprised at what shows up on our plates!  In this case, we wound up with an olive-oil soaked plate of fava beans, chickpeas, and vegetables.  I decidedly did not like it - there was something about the lemon juice, parsley, and olive oil mixing that made it taste vaguely vomit-y to me.  But I ate it anyway, and wished that there were more fresh cucumbers and beets to wrap the stuff up with - it cut the sourness and made it more palatable.

It's not the best lebanese food in the city but it's my favorite of the really cheap ones.  The one negative is that the air doesn't circulate very well and so if you eat there, you're likely to walk out smelling a bit like falafel.

The garbage cans were surprisingly barren of food and I didn't want to eat another lunch consisting of a Snickers King-size bar and broken chips from a discarded bag of Ruffles I found on a nearby bench. I stopped at this place out of desperation and because it was out of direct sunlight. Taking a look inside the place, I understand why my grandfather was so desperate to leave Lebanon that he stowed away on a cargo ship at the age of 15.  But giving this place the benefit of the doubt, I decided to place an order. The guy who helped me was walking around humming the words, ""Panama...Panama... Panama..."" The people were extremely friendly. (""But that's how they get you"", I told myself) The customers were friendly and praised the food, which appeased my darker and more pessimistic nature. Wow! The falafel sandwich or falafel wrap looked pretty damn good and substantial, fresh ingredients, not too much filler, ticking noises or signs of white powder. I closed my eyes and took a substantial bite. It was delicious, perfect even. The falafel crunched but wasn't hard and the sauce was flavorful without being overbearing. I continued chomping down on my wrap and made a mental note. I was so full and satisfied I gave my chips to some worthy ants and what looked like a neighborhood squirrel. I called in and wanted to thank the guy who helped me and to complement them on their food. He came out on the sidewalk.  ""You've got great food here my man"". We briefly chatted.

2009-05-10,5.0,"I've been coming here for years and every time I walk through that door, another reason pops up as to why it's okay to be obsessed with this establishment:  1. Ali (I think that's how it's spelled.), the very handsome fella that typically takes your order and brings it to you, is very sweet, kind and after a while of you coming in, he gives you such a warm welcome, you can't help but feel like part of the ToL family. The rest of the crew is amazing as well. The shorter fella is also very kind and has a great smile.  2. The prices are unbeatable. Over the past couple of years they have been upping their prices but they were sooooo low to begin with, I'm still surprised that I'm just paying $2.99 for a falafel wrap and $2.49 for the best (precooked) lentil soup this part of town.  3. The atmosphere is perfect. Fits every reason as to why you're even stepping into this place. Simple seating and minimalistic decor makes me wonder if they pull those hookahs off the wall for some after hours mellow time.  4. And of course the food is delicious. They make everything from scratch and you get it within minutes of ordering and sitting down. My favorites include the falafel sandwich w/ onions and peppers, lentil soup, both of the veggie platters (which are HUGELY advertised by the register), the fool mudamas is very reminiscent of frijoles de la hoya that have been mashed and the grape leaves as a side are superb.  So yea, go and shut up.  ps-if you have to go somewhere afterwards and don't want to smell like a sexy falafel, stuff your coat, jacket or shirt somewhere away from the delicious cooking fumes of that place.

One of the all too few good memories (besides having a Kurdish girl say she loved yours truly,) was this place Mudjat's near the far end of the FOB (Forward Operating Base.) You could sit back, order a couple of sandwiches that were grilled right out back for three bucks a pop, watch crazy European MTV and buy soda that you could otherwise get for free from the DFAC (Dining Facility.) Mudjat was a pretty friendly guy, and the place was great when it wasn't closed down for buying meat from unapproved sources, (knowing how Iraqis handle meat being one of the many bad memories of being there.) When I walked into Taste of Lebanon today, that's what it reminded me of, Mudjat's. The sandwiches were the same-although Mudjat didn't have chicken. The interiors of both were pretty no-frills and the cooler full of drinks almost brought a tear to my eye. I'm not just giving this place 4 stars because I was waxing nostalgic, though.

I aimed at the schwarma (I'm a sucker for chicken schwarma), but opted for the Combo #2: tabouli, two falafels, salad and (yet another weakness) grape leaves. All nicely priced at just under $7. The service was outstanding and efficient; put these guys to the test against the quickest New York street vendor! Portion control be damned. Two falafel balls, 4 grape leaves, two huge pitas and a large mound of tabouli is enough to fill two people. I waived the white flag after my second grape leaf and felt like a wasteful schmuck for dumping the rest. Good stuff, cheap and quick. All in all wonderful, yet shy of my coveted 5-star. The falafel was good, but a little overdone and dry. The menu is pretty limited, although this is truly a fast food joint.

I moved back to Chicago after a few years in Southeast Michigan, where lebanese etc food is ubiquetous, and very very good. It drove me to tears that almost every falaffel I have encountered in Chicago is of the stuffed kind-- a small pita has  a corner removed, white lettuce is stuffed in, then a couple falaffel balls, then sauce.  The whole thing falls apart and half of it is lettuce with no sauce.  I highly prefer the rolled vareity, which is presented like a burrito, and each bite contains the full spectrum of flavors.  Can you imagine a burrito where all the rice is on the bottom, then all the beans in a separate layer etc?? So i saw numerous references to ""rolled"" sandwiched below, and the high marks made me drive way way out of my way to go by the next day.   I didn't map it, or I would have seen that it is right around the corner from the Hop Leaf, so I am shocked I never ran into it, even though it is, as others testify, pretty much officially a hole in the wall. The storefront is about 9 feet wide-- I drove past.  It's about one step away from being a cart. it's just west of Clark. The menu is spare, mostly salads, dips, lots of meat sandwiches and falafel.  I got 2 falaffel to go, but would have liked to get the taboili--I saw one go out, nice and green-- and some baba, but I didnt have much cash and refuse to pay ATM surcharges around they corner. Yeah--  cash only!!  Prices are quite fair-- I think 3.80 a sandwich, a bi8t more for salad or hummous, but most likely it's worth it. I ate one sandwich promptly in the car, found it to be delicious but not dumbfounding.  In SE Michigan, the place would rate as 'ok.' in chicago, it's really good.

Key missing point is that Taste of Lebanon makes its sandwiches in lavash/ lafa (sweet flat bread) rather than in pita, which is the traditional way that sandwiches are made in parts of Lebanon, Jordan and Saudi Arabia. Why bother to tell you this? Because another thing that some Lebanese and Saudis do with their falafel and shawerma wraps is add french fries or fried eggplant. Since learning this I have been known to take these cheap and delicious Taste-y Lebanese sandwiches home, unroll, add fried eggplant and french fries, reroll and eat. You want to be known for the same thing, 'cause it will blow your taste buds' minds.",0.4767,0.865,0.079,0.057,0.49933333333333335

If you only have a couple of bucks and want some good food this is the place to go. Although, I have to say I would go there more often if they had better hours. That being said, I feel bad for the kid who works there, I don't think they ever let him leave. Maybe that's the reason for the shorter hours.

2007-03-29,5.0,"Inexpensive satisfying Leb classics that nourish the soul. My favorites: Lentil soup (every visit) falafel wrap chicken shawarma wrap lamb shawarma wrap vegetarian combo For your first visit consider the veg. combo and lentil soup. If you order the lentil soup with extra pita bread it's a meal in itself. It's one of those very simple and very satisfying soup recipes. The rich flavor is from a good amount of olive oil. It's just the right amount of spicy too. Friends of ours visited the very next day for the soup after we turned them on to it. The chicken shawarma wrap is very tasty, as is the falafel wrap. These are inexpensive but not enormous; I finish the chicken and half my falafel. Or a soup and half chicken shawarma is good too. My wife is cool with just one wrap. I would like the fatoush salad better if they eased up on the vinegar. Incidentals. It's very small and casual. Your clothing does end up smelling like the food so carry out if that bothers you. The young fellow who usually works the lunch register is a totally friendly easygoing guy. I used to feel guilty walking past my former falafel fix, Middle Eastern Bakery (across the street) to eat here. But that never stops me hehe.",0.985,0.79,0.177,0.033,0.5397701149425287

I'd estimate that at least 75% of the customers are repeat business take-out so they're used to people coming in who know exactly what they want - a vegetarian friend asked about how an item was prepared and elicted a confused/surprised response of ""It's vegetarian"".  Not at all hostile, but not used to questions.

2006-12-06,5.0,"By far, this is the best shawerma and falafel in this city. I've lived in the middle east so I have a good benchmark for middle-eastern cuisine. Back in the day (I'm not that old but I like saying that) - we used to pick up some shawermas from this place and take 'em over to Hopleaf. Now that was a winning combination - spicy middle-eastern food with excellent belgian beer. Sadly, the Hopleaf has since started serving their own stuff so that doesn't happen any more. The taste of the shawerma, falafel, as well as their hummus is true to the original and authentic versions that are served in the middle-east. The ambiance is something like eating in the back of a pickup truck in summer - open, slightly dusty, and you can feel the heat. A few tables and chairs (circa 1973) that are mostly in one piece are what you'll find inside. All in all, charming in a very rustic and spartan way.
