We asked for other tables that were empty but were told that they were reserved. Okay.  Our waiter was very good but it took forever to receive our entrees. I had chicken which was delicious but my husband's steak wasn't the best. The frites are exceptionally good. In the meantime, a couple was seated next to us. We were able to separate the tables by maybe five inches. It was a most unpleasant experience to speak with my husband while the man next to us was talking in a loud voice.

2017-08-16,2.0,"This review is not a reflection of the food but the service. My girlfriend and I were excited to try the Tuesday night Prix Fixe. Our table wasn't ready when we got there so we grabbed a drink at the bar. While sitting down, we saw two separate individuals throw their checks on the bar looking anxious and frustrated which was weird. But then when we sat down in a tiny, cramped corner it all made sense. The people working there don't really uphold service standards for patrons. We asked for app plates and never got them; we asked the waitress what was in one of the dishes and she mumbled some inaudible response that kind of sounded like she was drunk. Our waters were never refilled, and anytime someone actually came up to us, they made it seem like we were a hassle. We had almost finished our main course by the time someone came around to check on us, and then we were finally able to order a bottle of wine. Finally, for dessert I was excited to try the Porfitiroles, but ten minutes after ordering them she came back around saying they were all out. Then we waited another twenty mins for the dessert course, when it arrived it looked like it had been pre-made sitting in the fridge. We begged for our check so we could get out of there. A three course prix fixe should never take 2 hours and 2 minutes for two people. These people need to get their shit together and learn how to run a restaurant. I don't think we'll be back, which sucks because the food is delicious. I don't think you can get Escargot like that at other places in Chicago.",0.2926,0.849,0.078,0.074,0.5178743961352658

The interior is adorable and quaint. We were seated and after a few the waitress came and took our drink order. All was going ok. We ordered a few dishes to share and they were coursed out nicely. The waitress did her job just well enough, but didn't offer much more than a satisfactory experience. Now, the food was good, but it definitely wasn't memorable or great by any means. I have had better foie gras, it was rather tasteless and the presentation was nothing to write home about. The steak tartar seemed under seasoned. The mussels was arguably the best dish of the night, that sauce was rather incredible and the mussels were huge. The most disappointing dish of the night was our escargots- we couldn't even finish it, not sure what was going on but the butter sauce tasted just like oil and salt, not good...

2017-07-09,4.0,"Le Bouchon is hands down my go-to restaurant when I'm looking to have a nice dinner for a special occasion.  First, I will talk about their drinks. They have a very extensive wine list, but if you're a fan of the dirty martini like I am, that's the move for this restaurant. The blue cheese olives are hand stuffed, and they keep the vermouth pour to a minimum.  You can't go wrong with escargot, but they do it the best. Of course, their charcuterie never disappoints, either. Over time, I've gotten the steak frites (au poivre and maitre d), the salmon, and the steak tartare, and I've always been extremely satisfied. As for the dessert, I recommend the creme brulee.  The service at Le Bouchon is very helpful and quick, which is a great plus. One thing to note is that the restaurant is quite small, so you'll need to book a reservation. Also, they do try to fit a lot of people in there, so it is very cramped (like need to move your table so you can get out and go to the bathroom type of cramped).

Logistics - Located in Bucktown, just off of the Armitage exit if taking the Kennedy.  Very easy to get to and find parking on the street.    Venue - Small and intimate, just like in Paris (studied abroad in Paris and went to several different cafés and bistros).  Tables are close together so it is very easy to talk to your date or small group.  Atmosphere - Fun, yet elegant!  A bit noisy, but that should be expected in a smaller venue.   Food - For appetizers, my girlfriend ordered the Pâté de Canard Aux Pistache and I ordered the Soupe à l'Oignon Gratinée.  Both were phenomenal!  The Pâté was served on a wooden plate (looks like a log) and comes with nice side pieces to complement the Pâté.  The Onion soup had enough cheese to make you feel like you had dinner already but tasted delicious.  I would say that you could easily split an appetizer since they come in a larger portion than expected.  For the main course, my girlfriend ordered the Steak Frites with the the sauce au poivre (pepper sauce) and I ordered the Lapin En Croute.  Both were excellent.  The Steak Frites's sauce complements the NY Strip very well and the fries are the smaller cut fries and seasoned with salt.  The Lapin en Croute was basically a Rabbit Pot Pie with Andouille Sausage mixed in.  I personally was not a fan of the sausage, but overall the dish had plenty of flavor.  Good presentation with the Lapin en Croute as well! Again, larger portions so if you are not that hungry, expect to have leftovers.  For dessert we ordered the Marquise.  It was very flavorful and these little crunchy bits that complemented the Marquise well, could not quite figure out what they were.

2017-02-01,2.0,"I have been to Le Bouchon twice, both times with my daughter. We went on Tuesday evenings, as they do a Prix Fixe menu that is very exciting and reasonable.  We made reservations on both occasions, (as one should do when they expect prompt service!!!) However the first time, when we went around 8pm, there was no room for us, and we had to wait. I understand that a restaurant cannot always control when its patrons finish their dinners, however what is the point of letting diners make reservations if they cannot be upheld?  It is also worth noting that there isn't a proper waiting area and we were expected to stand in the middle of the restaurant, and were jostled quite frequently by waitstaff and others. I am a large man!  The food during our first experience was pretty good. My daughter had a french onion soup she enjoyed, and I had a chicken dish that I felt was very authentic (although I have not been to France in about 30 years!!!!!) The creme brulee was the best part, and seemed to be in high demand.  The SECOND time we went, however, the food was sub par. I ordered a charcuterie plate that was frankly frightening. It was not a plate, first of all. It was served on what looked like a tree stump which I understand could be considered ""hip"", but it made the questionable meats(?) that were on it even more unappealing. It consisted of what looked like swamp leaves and something out of the NBC series ""Hannibal."" I dropped some of it on the ground by accident, but I did not miss it. They were also out of the creme brulee the second time, which was the only thing that could have saved the meal! If something is always in such high demand, why not make more!!! It is basic Economics that Mr. Bouchon should take into consideration.  Finally I would like to comment on the service. We had the same waitress both times and she was always very curt and unfriendly. She was not welcoming at all! The first time, my daughter ordered a Bellini from her, as she had just turned 21 and thought it would be a fun time. Even though she is freshly of drinking age, she knows what a Bellini is. Peach juice and champagne! When the drink came it did not look right, and she asked the waitress if it was the Bellini, commenting on how there was no juice in it. The waitress did not take this kindly, and insisted a Bellini was made with champagne and peach liquor. WRONG!!! She didn't even offer to take it back or exchange it when it was made clear that my daughter didn't know it wouldn't be like the real version of the drink. The menu also didn't specify this change to the norm. Anyway this waitress was very unpleasant and made our experience unpleasant to boot.  To sum up, I think the food is worth going for if you order carefully and go at a decent time. But I hope you don't get the waitress we had!",0.9347,0.833,0.1,0.067,0.5075025329280648

We had reservations (even though the place was EMPTY) and I arrived earlier, when I tried to order a drink from the very rude waitress. I handed her my GOVERNMENT ISSUED TEMPORARY ID, because unfortunately my purse was stolen and I had to get a new ID, and she told me in front of the entire restaurant that I could have printed the ID myself at home and she would not be able to serve me. When my boss arrived and tried to explain that my ID was in fact legit and it even scans, we were told again in an even ruder fashion that it simply wasn't worth it to them. So we went a few blocks away to The Violet Hour, and had a few drinks to recalibrate after having our night almost ruined by Le Bouchon. We told the staff at Violet Hour what had happened and they obviously were better educated on what a temporary ID looks like and we had no issues, they were even surprised that Le Bouchon had so little knowledge on state procedures. Anywho, we ended the night with dinner and two bottles of wine at Girl & the Goat and had a lovely time.

The tables are a bit close - but I don't see what other option they have with the space they are dealing with. I was disappointed in a few things today:  We arrived at almost 12:30 on a Sat. they open at 11:30 and they were already out of the 2 items I had my heart set on (poached lobster w/mango avocado and butter lettuce and vegetable quiche). Fortunately, I had other faves in mind. I ordered the French onion soup to start. If you saw my reviews prior to the update you already know how I feel about it. It was excellent except for the fact that I got the heel of the bread which was difficult to eat/tough to cut and the broth - not as full bodied/flavorful as I remember. .  After the soup I had escargot, which was cooked perfectly and served hot. But it was missing any detectable hint of garlic which significantly lessened my zeal for a dish I've enjoyed here many times.  We both had the creme brulee which was excellent.

The only rub is that it's tiny and so it's very loud and very crowded. If that's not your thing then maybe try something else. I found the tight seating to be charming. Like you knew you were someplace special and everyone around you is in on the secret.  I started with the apple salad which is huge and lovely. Since we were in the middle of the holidays I felt I needed to eat something green. My stepmom got the escargot which smelled buttery and garlicky. We also had the lovely bread and butter that they give you. It's nice and crusty! There were four people at the table and we somehow ordered 2 chickens and 2 steaks. The chicken takes longer to cook but it's worth the wait. Wow. It's like a warm hug on a winter day. There's this great gravy and mashed potatoes that come with it that are outstanding. So creamy and delicious. And the chicken is top notch. Perfectly juicy. For dessert, I had the profiteroles. Sometimes they can be soggy, but these are crispy and just the right size. You get a few bites of chocolate, ice cream, and puff, and feel satisfied. I slept really well that night.",0.9968,0.729,0.271,0.0,0.6399350649350648

Really didn't seem to care about informing us about menu items, wine list.....anything for that matter.  Could have cared less about our enjoyment of the meal,  which in my opinion is a big part of a good wait person's role.....anyway....an otherwise great experience was marred by her involvement, which if I am the owner, tells me that she is NOT an asset to me business,.

2017-01-03,1.0,"Tried this place because our usual bistro was closed. We seriously hoped for the best after reading reviews online and seeing what looks like a traditional bistro menu, but we were very, very disappointed. Arrived 10 mins early but we weren't seated until about 20 mins after our reservation time (these things happen, I know).  It wasn't the delay so much as the fact that it was an uncomfortable wait because there's NO place to wait. The place is TINY. All 5 or 6 bar stools were taken and so we were left with no choice but to stand in the only walkway or in a sidestation. The entire time other diners were glaring at us as our bodies came within inches of them as they talked with their table mates, and we were constantly dodging busy servers. So forget trying to at least have a conversation as you wait- you're just trying to be as small as possible. Then, once we were finally sat(and I will say the hostess was good about apologizing for the delayed reservation), we waited another 25 mins to have our drink and dinner order taken. There was a split second that a server came by about 15 mins after being seated but he scurried off when we took a moment to decide if we planned to drink the same wine and should get a bottle. Got an eye roll when we asked about his menu preferences. First course finally hit the table more than one hour after we arrived. At some point, our server apparently didn't like how busy it was and he just left for the night (jacket, bag, everything) while we waited for a dessert menu. Don't know if that was planned or not.... just saw him leave. While I suppose that may have been an attempt  to imitate the typical aloof Parisian bistro server, I doubt it. All in all this entire experience was a disappointment. 2.75 hours from our arrival to finally paying the check, all of which we spent feeling like we were just a nuisance. Who has that kind of time for average food (eg: fatty, tough steak with a super peppery sauce that I'm still burping up, and an unremarkable profiterole) and unreliable service, especially in the middle of the week? Not me. I won't be back.",-0.8102,0.851,0.063,0.086,0.4885658914728682
2016-12-23,3.0,"Some lovely food but can be marred by long waits and table jostling at this busy and cramped Chicago resto. A reservation does not mean you'll be seated when you arrive, nor even within a 1/2 hour ... the restaurant is so small that their offer of a drink at the already-two-deep bar area is just a recipe for greater frustration and lots of bumping into service staff as they pass the patrons on their way to and from the kitchen. Surprisingly, they just suggest going out and scouting a place to have a drink while you wait - given the delay and lack of space, a recommendation should have been forthcoming. We live in the 'hood, so know the Japanese resto next door is a great bet for a lovely drink at the bar - others who suffered the same fate did not.  As for the food, the bouillabaisse was lovely but most of the clams had not opened, making us question the attentiveness to the food at the pass. Rabbit pie was  stunning - tender, rich, superbly brought together under fantastic puff pastry.  Salmon rillettes and salade lyonnaise were great appetizers, but the end-of-meal cheeses were not as impressive. In sum, we enjoyed the food, but found the approach to dealing with delays unappealing and almost off-putting (especially with Izakaya Mita just next door).",0.9871,0.751,0.181,0.068,0.5805

When he finally came over to take our order, we wanted to order appetizers first but he insisted on taking the entire order. ""It's easier for me"" was his comment.  He never checked back on us until it was time for dessert and he just stood there and didn't say anything.

2016-11-30,2.0,"Until now, I've only ""yelped"" to provide a positive ""shout out"" for a great restaurant experience, but I feel compelled to provide this negative review because we were so disappointed with the food and service at Le Bouchon.  Duck and liver mousse parfait: - I love pate' and the server recommended this over the foie gras because it was richer. It came with plum jam and a ""seed and nut medley"" in such thick layers, that  the mousse could barely be tasted. When spread on the burned, cold toast, it tasted like a gross and cloying PB&J sandwich. I had my wife try it, and, without myprompting said ""tastes like PB&J"".  Escargot:  We love to dip bread in the little escargot cups, to soak up the delicious snail infused garlic butter, but here, the ""dipping part"" was primarily snail broth with little garlic or butter.   Venison loin - The venison was cooked perfecly (seared on the outside and medium rare on the inside) accompanied by a tender ""fall of the bone"" oxtail. While I like Thai food that's so hot that it makes you sweat, I've never had that experience with pepper...until now. The peppercorn sauce, for this dish was SO peppery, that it totally overwhelmed the flavor of the meats.  Scallops: - The three decent sized scallops were served on a flavorful sauce, but they were a bit undercooked and should have been seared on both sides...not just the top.   Desserts: The apple tart and the rich chocolate dish were both very good.  Service: - We were there for our anniversary, so not in a rush, but the food came out way too slowly for each course...probably because the restaurant was very busy...which may explain the lack of attention to detail in the food.  - Our waitress was very inattentive and, oddly, engaged various patrons in lengthy chats         (obviously not about their service but...who knows what ?) while ignoring everyone else. When we sought her attention to request the bill, she was engaged in one of her long chats. After we finally were able to request the bill, she came back from the kitchen and started chatting with the patron right next to us, for at least five minutes, while apparently holding the folder for his bill. Believe it or not, she was actually holding OUR bill and, when she was done chatting with this guy, she simply turned to us and dropped in on our table saying ""here you go"". You'd have to see it to believe it.  Finally, when I told her about the PB&J tasting mousse parfait, she said ""I told you not to get that"", when, in fact, she had encouraged me to get it instead of the foie gras.  I'm sorry to have to write such a negative review...hope it's the last time I feel compelled to do so on Yelp.",0.9854,0.821,0.122,0.057,0.5206879352531526

We felt really crammed in our corner. Our server was friendly and patient. We ordered a couple of onion soups, special gumbo soup, frog legs, steak tartare a few salads to start. The soups arrived but all came under room temperature. The bowls and the cheese toppings were piping hot but the soup itself was below room temperature. The gumbo had the same problem with temperature and it tasted strange and not in a good way. We sent all the soups back to reheat (except for the gumbo which we sent back and cancelled). The steak tartare came late. It didn't taste as good as i remembered it. Not sure if they've changed the recipe. Then came the entrees. The paella was good and so was the special pork dish.The salmon was perfectly cooked but the side items underneath the salmon was again way under room temperature. At this point, since we were already 2.5 hours into dinner, we felt it was too late to send anything back. We asked for a manger but the server said they do not have a manager because the restaurant is a small operation. Our server did take off the gumbo soup and the salmon.

2016-10-02,4.0,"FOOD: Great frog legs. The frog legs were more fish in flavor than most frog legs I've had. But I'm talking a very mild fish undertone. I think that is because they are served with a lemony sauce that brings out the very mild fish flavors.  The desert was good, and rich. It wasn't super sweet and sugary as some chocolate based desserts can be.  OYSTERS: We came for the oyster special and the oysters were pretty good. The Beausoleils were on special, which is a decent quality oyster to have on special. The oysters were fully shucked and came out very fast. DRINKS: The sazerac was very licorice-y in flavor, almost as if it had a hint of star anise or something. I wonder if the bitters were the cause? All in all, I liked the light licorice flavor. ATMOSPHERE: When we arrived, on a Thursday evening, there were quite a few people here. It wasn't overcrowded, but there certainly isn't a lot of space between tables.

2016-06-18,5.0,"Can a restaurant constantly improve over the years? The answer is yes, in this case Le Bouchon is a perfect exemple.  The first thing I noticed as I entered: the big bread basket was gone. I sat down and a few minutes later, our waitress brought a mini baguette in the shape of three little rolls attached to one another fresh out of the oven. It is served on a little wooden board with some high quality butter. Bread and butter, nothing fancy, but that was the best bread I had so far, period! warm, crispy, portioned enough to make you smile and not so much to spoil your appetite. I had the Nicoise salad that night. Usually made with potatoes, salad, green beans, eggs, tomatoes, olives and anchovies topped with tuna, often it is enough to make a meal out of it. However Le Bouchon's approach to that great classic is a delicious ""Sashimi"" style tuna topped with tiny bits of fennel, celeri, olives, tomatoes, quail egg, fried capers, fresh herbs and a little like the frenchs say:""I don't know what"", which made every bite taste a little different in a wonderful way.  The fish special that night was a trout, served whole and yes...debonned! morel mushroms and a little acidity from a vinaigrette balanced the dish nicely.  My friend had the seasonal soft shell crab also well executed. On previous visits over the years I had pretty much everything from the menu. The frog legs served on a cast iron pan with a burned lemon, homemade charcuterie, cod fish brandade, cote de boeuf, the whole duck for two. Every dishes are well thought-out and taken to another level of deliciousness.   Last year I had the Choucroute, sauerkraut, sausages and potatoes one might think! Not at Le Bouchon: Home made not as sour brined cabbage, braised lamb, duck confit, home made sausages, little fingerlings potatoes top with a julienne of granny smith and served with an apple mustard. Genious!  It is very well priced given what you get on your plate. Service is always great, the staff is very professional and knowledgeable. If you go alone, eat at the bar, you will mingle with other people in no time and the bartender will make you feel right at home.

It was very confusing and I would've moved after I realized).

But it was luke warm and on the top and the bottom burned my mouth. Next I had the Salad Lyonnaise. My favorite salad, but not here. The egg was ""warm"" which would be alright normally but the dressing was way too acidic, nothing to balance it out. Every bite was very sour, I could not finish. Also the lardon seemed to be deep fried and by the taste it seemed like the frying oil was stale. It was gross. Husband had bouillabaisse, which he enjoyed. Heavy on the mussels so if you love mussels, that's the thing to order. The worst thing were the tables.

2016-02-29,5.0,"Had a wonderful meal at Le Bouchon. Heather took such good care of us, giving wonderful suggestions and keeping us well tended-to. French cuisine is all about coaxing the most marvelous flavors out of the simplest ingredients and this enterprise does this beautifully. The salads are elegant but bistro-hearty with a surprising and delightful blending of flavors. I never would have thought cumin-pickled celery root would pair so beautifully with roasted pepitas, but this is just one of many wonderful surprises. The snug atmosphere is also very characteristically French - and something more commonly found stateside in New York or San Francisco, so conventional Midwesterners should be prepared and adopt their most intercontinental mindset to enjoy such a lovely foreign gem.",0.9938,0.65,0.35,0.0,0.6034675324675325
2016-02-25,2.0,"I walked in and just loved the atmosphere, but sadly, atmosphere alone doesn't make for a good restaurant. After reading so many positive reviews, I was excited to go, but my experience left me wondering if I had, in fact, gone to the wrong place. Amateurishly prepared food, terrible cocktails and downright creepy service. I get my usual martini, and it's not very good - there was an odd, almost ""musky"" finish to it, which means their ice is bad. Their distributor is probably selling them over-chlorinated ice (much like at the Signature Room) - but I can let that pass. The menu is fairly extensive, even a bit overwhelming, so I needed a little extra time to make a decision... that's when the weird started to happen. There is a basket of baguettes out in the dining area and, having been to places where it is decoration, my wife asked if that was the bread they serve, or is it just for show. Our server leaned in and replied in a quiet monotone, ""We wait until our guests order their meals before providing bread."" Completely off-putting. Now that we've been scolded for inquiring about bread, I feel rushed and have to make a decision fast. To make matters worse, I'm not even allowed to order an appetizer first so I can continue to deliberate on my meal. We are told we ""must order everything at once"" in a rather condescending monotone. There are six other people in the place at the time, I don't think the kitchen is going to get overwhelmed. Feeling rushed, I order the Onion Soup and Salmon, my wife gets the Onion Tart and the Steak Frîtes. The Onion Soup is mediocre at best. The cheese is all wrong, and had a weird, almost styrofoam texture to it. The consommé was okay, but a rather hollow experience over all. The Onion Tart was completely overwhelmed by the pork cheek, but the accompanying side salad was very nice. Now the mains come out. My salmon was decent - it had a nice char on the outside, but the center was cold and raw. The sauce was a nice touch and it's tanginess complimented the fish and brussels sprouts well, but the pickled elements seriously clashed with the rest of the dish. My wife's Steak Frîtes were an abysmal failure. First, they are clearly serving frozen fries, which is shameful except for counter service places, but the steak... absolute horror. As my wife pre-sliced, it went from rare, to medium, to well done, to shoe leather. She could only eat a third of it at most. I ate more than half of mine, but there was not even a question about the mostly uneaten steak - the plate was just whisked away. We didn't say anything. We were polite, paid and left quietly. In the cab ride home, I tried to think positively of it and I've been thinking about the experience for some time, trying to put a positive spin on it. I really wanted to like this place, because the decor and music are fantastic. I just can't recommend Le Bouchon to anyone. Poorly executed food, overpriced, frozen fries and service that makes you think you're dining at the Bates' Motel... it only gets the second star because I liked the decor so much.",0.9479,0.781,0.124,0.096,0.5538631880939573

2016-02-14,5.0,"Valentine's Day at Le Bouchon. This small and cozy restaurant with creaky wooden floor is a total traditional French brasserie. We ordered steak tartare and lamb shank special. We arrived early to snag great window seats. Believe it or not--it's totally French to people watch from either behind or in front of the window. In Paris, seats face the sidewalk so that people can watch pedestrians walking by! The steak tartare paired cured egg, gribiche sauce and quail egg proves to not disappoint. The tender tartare marinated with gribiche and cured egg stirred up thoughts of German mustard. Ugh, I absolutely love that the dish was topped with these little buds of salad. I had to ask the waitress what they were so I can dress up my dishes at home. Answer? Anise micro greens. The lamb shank dressed in pearl onions, sauerkraut and  with young with turmeric yogurt. The bowl was more sour and young than expected, but he thoroughly enjoyed the different flavors that came with every bit. From the raw acids of the sauerkraut, to the crunch of the purple onions and the green fresh flavors of cilantro.",0.9326,0.905,0.085,0.01,0.41731868131868133

2015-12-24,1.0,"I had such an awful, surreal experience at Le Bouchon. Based on the reviews I'm sure it was a one-off incident, but it happened to me and it sucked a lot. I had a 5PM reservation with a friend. We get there on time and enjoy some wine and food. The steak tartare was phenomenal. Halfway through the meal, our waitress (redheaded) leaves an open bottle of wine on our table by accident. I try to catch her attention for ages and she eventually she sees us, picks it back up and is sheepish and thanks us for letting us know. However, something must have occurred immediately afterward. It's like a switch flips--she goes from being friendly and normal to extremely brusque, unsmiling, and passive aggressive. It's about 6PM when this happens, and my friend and I were still trying to enjoy our glasses of wine. By the time it's 6:30PM, the body language of our waitress is overtly hostile and curt (slamming things on the table, being sarcastic) and the last straw is when we're handed the bill before we were done with our wines and had the small black folder picked up three times by three different staff within a ten minute time period even though I tell them we aren't finished, there's no payment inside yet. At this point, I'm completely fed up. What happened? Why did the waitress go from being friendly to hostile so quickly? Who were the other two randos picking up our bill? One guy wasn't wearing a uniform, so he looked like the owner or manager. But I could swear we were being normal and polite, at least until they started passive-aggressively ushering us out of the restaurant. Is it because we only ordered entrees and not a multi-course meal? Why should that even matter? As a result, I tip low. About 8% I think, I forget. My friend tips the normal amount so as not to be awkward. but I'm pretty upset at this point. Since I recognize the tip is low, however, I write a short note to explain. I say the first part of the meal was pleasant but that the service suddenly became abrupt. We pack up our things, my friend heads to the restroom and I wait for her outside. What happens next is surreal: the redheaded waitress storms outside and snarls at me, ""Thanks for the NOVEL."" Then she snaps that ""people with reservations were waiting 45 minutes for you"" then slams back into the restaurant. I'm furious--did she completely forget that we had reservations as well? It's not like we were there for four hours with just a tea--we had a 1:45hr meal with continuous drinks. Furthermore, if she had even bothered to tell us upfront that they were busy and we could only sit for 1.5hours, that would've been totally fine. What WASN'T fine was hostile, passive aggressive behavior. I follow her back inside the restaurant and she's taking the order of a table of poor bystanders who have to watch this uncomfortable altercation. I'm angry but I'm also trying to figure out what the hell just happened and try to explain that all she had to do was TELL us it was busy and we would've left, but the waitress is LIVID and shaking and cuts me off, snapping ""I'm with customers right now."" I leave numbly. My friend joins me soonafter and tells me she had a really confusing walk back out the door. She said a random waitress told her ""Have a good night"" but it was said really saccharine and over-the-top. We're both completely lost. Was the other waitress being sarcastic and passive aggressive in saying ""have a good night""? Or was she trying to make up for the redhead who seemed as if she had come into her own set of issues halfway through the night and was taking it out on us? All in all, this was the worst restaurant experience I've ever had in my 30 years of life. And I eat out a lot. So, congratulations Le Bouchon. Out of thousands of establishments, you're at the top of my shit list. (Which is a shame because the steak tartare was very yummy.) :(",-0.359,0.746,0.125,0.129,0.5369662418958192

It's not a large bistro, so it tends to pack quickly and the ambient noise from so many customers in a small space can result in a need to talk loud. On to the more important topic of the restaurant: the food. French onion soup. Sauvignon blanc. Rushing waters trout. Chardonnay. Apple beignets with ice cream. Coffee. I have never been a fan of French onion soup. I could see myself ordering the soup here again. The trout was absolutely divine, complete without fishy flavour, and very meaty. The apple beignets were different, and in a good way, if I may add. The service seemed slightly scrambled at first. I didn't make it any better by telling my server that I liked seafood, have no nut allergies yet hate nuts, and that I wanted a soup or salad, an entree, and a dessert; I left the decision as to ""what"" to my server. Once the camera came out, and I don't mean the one on my cellphone, service was top all around. I will have to return to taste some of the other menu items.

The restaurant itself is super small, cozy and intimate. We were seated near the back by the bar and had a good view of the bread station where each server would come to slice the baguettes himself each time a table needed one. Don't know if they bake their bread there or if they get it somewhere else, but I was glad they kept it coming! We started off ordering a bottle of wine and the charcuterie plate. It was a great selection of pate, nduja, sausages, and cured duck, all served on a slice of tree stump! We then had the escargots, served still bubbling. Some of the best snails I've ever had. The steak tartare with a quail egg was perfect and a pretty big portion as well. We got some veggies just to make ourselves feel good... The green beans were a little garlicky and the tomatoes were kind of simple but both were good additions to the meal.

2014-10-22,2.0,"My girlfriend and I met my parents at Le Bouchon on a Friday night for dinner last week. We got there early to enjoy the $1 oysters at the bar special. The oysters were fine, although they didn't come with cocktail sauce but a tureen of apple cider vinegar which was disappointing and you had to either sloppily pour it on your oysters or else take them out of the shell with a fork and then dip them since they didn't give us a spoon. Since I have always ""slurped"" oysters I had to go the former route. The bartender was friendly and helpful, but while sitting at the bar I overheard the woman who would turn out to be our waitress loudly complaining about one of her customers to another server. She didn't use profanities but it just set a negative mood for the evening.  Once my parents arrived we were seated. Le Bouchon is a VERY small restaurant, maybe the tiniest I've ever been in. While the size didn't bother me at first, whenever the waiter for the table next to ours came over to talk to them, he'd stand so that his butt was pressed against my shoulder. This happened three times, and he didn't just brush it and then move, he stood there as if me and his rear were not in constant contact and I had nowhere to go. I'm sure he was standing there because that was the best spot to let other servers use the tiny aisle, but it was very uncomfortable for me. Also with a full dining room of conversation and the music playing on top of that it became impossible for me to hear my mother's weak speaking voice at the opposite corner of the four-top table. Our waitress, the one who I'd heard complaining earlier, was clearly having a bad night. Not rude but not friendly either. I had to ask her to bring bread to our table after she'd already taken our orders and brought us a round of drinks afterwards, when every other table had bread from the get go. After our food arrived she only stopped by our table one time over the entire meal to see if we needed anything.  The arrival of our food was the worst part. An older man who I took for the owner or manager brought two of our plates to the table and after setting mine down he was holding my girlfriend's at chest level when he was racked with a phlegmy-sounding cough. He covered his mouth with his fist but made no effort to turn his head, even as he coughed a second time, and considering he had the one arm free he really should have ""vampire coughed"". As it was it looked like he was coughing down onto my girlfriend's plate. How many germs does a closed fist stop anyway? We all shared a look at the table but as it had taken a decent amount of time for our food to arrive no one said anything. My girlfriend later said that she saw he had a runny nose and looked sick. I understand if you have to come into work when you are sick but there has to be something you can do besides handling the food if you have a cough, especially when you are not a server.  Our food was fine but nothing special. I ordered by saying ""I'll have La Lapin Au Vin"" in what I've been told by native speakers is good French but the waitress just said ""What?"" so I said ""The rabbit"". It was a little dry and was served in a stew so I got pieces of cartilage and bone in my spoonfuls of broth a couple times, and that was before I'd cut apart the rabbit at all. My girlfriend's skirt steak au poivre was tasty but thin. I will say the steak tartare was excellent.  Bottom line: We may go back and sit at the bar for oysters and steak tartare again, but another full meal is not in our future.",0.3766,0.836,0.085,0.079,0.4957990314769977

(A big no-no!)  He just quickly sat us at our table, asked us if we wanted drinks, and then walked away.  My boyfriend ordered a red wine, and the waiter poured it quickly into his glass, almost to the very top of it, and actually spilled some on the table.  He then left again quickly.  I had to get his attention so that he could wipe the table.  First of all, a wine glass should never be filled all the way, and spilling on the table and not even acknowledging it is unacceptable.   In terms of the food, we shared a few dishes because we weren't that hungry.  We ordered the salade maison, the broccoli cheddar soup, escargots, duck fat spaetzle with bacon, and the liver mousse.  I'm not a liver mousse eater but my boyfriend said that he had had better from Trader Joe's.  The escargots were bland.  It seems like I am unable to find properly seasoned escargots in Chicago.  The best thing that we had was, shockingly, the only thing that wasn't French, the broccoli cheddar soup!

2013-11-21,4.0,"Had lunch with two colleagues here last week and it was very good. As others have stated, it's a quaint little French bistro. Low key, warm colors and a nice vibe in a relatively small space. So if you want to dine there in prime time, I'd say get there early. Not sure if it takes reservations or fills up. I had a 3 course fixed price lunch for $25 which included french onion soup, steak frites and an apple tart for desert.  First was the onion soup which was done to perfection. Somehow they managed to keep the bread inside the soup somewhat crisp as it was toasted. Brilliant. The cheese was perfectly toasted / burnt on top and the soup itself was rich and NOT salty like most French Onion soups can be. To me it was the best French Onion soup I've ever had. And I've had quite a few. Next was the steak frites. A nice skirt steak done medium rare, served with an herbed butter and a generous portion of frites which were also perfectly done. The portion was so generous, I would up taking half home. The wife and my dogs were happy! Last was the apple tart. It was my least favorite of the three but that may be unfair as everything before it was so good, it probably suffered a bit from that. The tart was a bit soft and the apples were a bit burnt. It was as if they were trying to caramelize the top with a torch and got a bit carried away. But still, can't complain as it was still pretty good. We shared a bottle of Bordeaux which at $50 was a bit pricey but then again, the value of the meal more than made up for it. I would be remiss if I forgot to mention the bread. It was excellent too. If you're looking for a nice place in Bucktown to go for lunch that's formal enough for a business luncheon but casual enough to meet friends, this is your place.

So, when hosting guests from out of town, we decided this was a perfect spot to take them. We made a reservation on Opentable and showed up a little early and ready to dine. The host, who was unfailingly polite, informed us that something had been lost in translation and they did not have our reservation... Never fear! He told us a table that was close to done ""had our name on it"" and we could pop over to have a drink across the street, and, in fifteen minutes, the table would be ours. My husband suggested we leave a number or we could even stay and wait, but the host said it would not be a problem. When, 18 minutes later, we inquired about our table, the host told us it had been given away. He said sometime these things happen.... I was definitely not happy about our initial reservation not having been respected, but was furious that we were then promised a table that was not given to us. Although the host was apologetic and polite, that does no make up for this royal mess up. I had been meaning to write a review after my first time at Le Bouchon, in which I would haven given them 5 stars. After this incident, my opinion had changed, and I will not be returning. Furthermore, I wonder why they claimed to have lost our reservation and then I received a call at 10:30 to inquire if we were going to keep our reservation... something isn't right with this story.",-0.8082,0.838,0.072,0.09,0.538003663003663

While the escargot was mediocre (bland), the rabbit was outstanding!  This is why I have a major issue...I was only able to eat 1/4 of the rabbit dish not because of the taste, but numerous appetizers, etc.  The waiter took my plate along with 2 others which we requested ""to go"".  He returned their meals and when I inquired about mine he went to check and after about 10 minutes came back and said it was thrown away.  The waiter then came back and apologized and said they were fixing a fresh dish for me and would be back with it shortly.  He returned with a ""to go"" dish for me.  I thought this was outstanding customer service, but imagine my surprise AND ANGER when I got home and opened the container to see BOW TIE PASTA AND NOOOOO RABBIT!!!!

I don't want a 3 star rating to deter anyone from giving Le Bouchon a chance; it honestly was a pretty satisfying experience.  The champagne was nothing short of excellent, the frog legs to die for, and the creme brulee divine.  We also ordered the escargot, and I have to say that was one of the low points of the meal.  Escargot really just needs to be loaded with garlic and butter to taste how it should, but it tasted more like someone dipped the snails in water and pesto.  Not recommended, but the frog legs really did make up for this. I ordered the mushroom gnocchi because our waitress insisted on that over the roasted chicken or cassoulet, and while it had great flavor, it didn't seem like a sufficient entree.  My mom got the lamb shank, which was very good (though a little gamier than lamb usually is), and it was gigantic.  I think we probably should have just split the lamb and called it a night. For the most part, the food was up to par, but there were a few French basics I was disappointed in (ie. the escargot).  Also, our waitress was not the friendliest in the world.  She was pretty dismissive and had a bit of an attitude when I asked her for another glass of wine.  It also seemed like she was the only waitress for the night, so maybe that had something to do with it.

We went on a wednesday night and the place was packed. We did not have reservation but we soon seated as there was only 2 of us. So here's the breakdown; The Décor - Definitely cozy and has a great atmosphere. Decoration of the place sure makes you feel like you're in a small eatery (Bouchon) in France Food - This is where I was a little disappointed. To me there are a few French items on the Menu that each French restaurant has to get them right. We order the escargot to start with and it was bland and I felt it was not fresh. I ordered the Bouillabaisse and here was the biggest let down. The soup base was way too salty and the seafood items were not fresh at all. My girlfriend ordered the Sauteed Rabit, which was the saving grace of the evening. It was cooked right and flavorful. Service - This was another let down. Our server was not attentive and took forever for our bread and to take our order. She also never came back to refill our water. I know the place is packed but I thought she could be a little more attentive and friendly. Bottomline : My experience here was just so-so but I'm willing to go back and give them another chance. I probably will not recommend this restaurant to other until they have redeemed themselves.

The manager/owner checked on us and talked to us a couple of times, and made us feel welcome. The place has a very casual, inviting, accessible feel to it--no need to feel intimidated if you're not knowledgeable about French food. The food is the reason I'm giving Le Bouchon four starts instead of five. We split a French Onion soup as our appetizer, which was delicious, and then ordered a very expensive 32 oz steak special along with a glass of red wine. The steak was good and the wine went well with it, but the steak was a bit undercooked and I didn't feel it was anything special.

2013-02-10,5.0,"Food: The appetizers that we ordered were classic French bistro fare, moules marinieres (mussels in white wine with herbs) and escargots. For someone who had been craving simple French food, it was heaven. Plenty of fresh bread came alongside to sop up all the delicious sauces. The main courses that we had, though tasty, paled in comparison to the simple dishes that preceded them. I had a braised duck leg that was good, but it was served with too much sauce, and I thought that the presentation could have been better. My companion had rabbit, and pretty much had the same reaction. Over all, the main courses were well prepared, as well as a pleasant diversion from the ordinary (when was the last time you had rabbit?). The appetizers were spot on, we could have been in Paris. Drink: An ample wine list for a small neighborhood restaurant. The focus was most definitely French, as it should be, and both the glasses of white and red were great. You paid the premium for the French imports, but it definitely enhanced the overall experience. Service: There were only 2 waiters, and at least 15 tables, maybe more. That being said, they did a great job making sure we were taken care of. We had a reservation for 7:30, and were really hungry, so we showed up at 7 and were seated immediately. As the night went on though, the place was definitely packed. It wasn't the sort place that you'd expected to be waited on hand and foot, and in turn, it wasn't.

The menu is in French (with English translations, bien sur) and they have all of the best and classic French dishes available.  Soupe a l'ognion, salade chevre chaud, steak frites, confit de canard, moules frites, etc.  I highly recommend trying the soupe a l'ognion, steak frites and moules frites.  They are very, very well done at Le Bouchon and very, very scrumptious. The wine selection is pretty big and they have a lot of decently-priced selections, which is good because wine in France is so cheap.   They also have a full bar and some beers, should you want to go that route.  Specials during the week include lunch, half-price bottles of wine and daily changing entrees.   The restaurant is pretty small (typical of un bouchon) so prepare to wait and feel cramped once you get a table.  The atmosphere was very jovial when my husband and I ate here and I really enjoyed how much everyone else was enjoying their time at Le Bouchon.  It was loud but not in a terrible way; everyone was just having a great time, all packed in to this tiny space.  The parking situation is pretty awful, so plan on doing public or valet which is reasonable.",0.9849,0.861,0.126,0.012,0.477719298245614

The beans cooked tender but not mushy, plenty of lamb, duck and ham.  Appetizers were also five stars. The onion soup could be a meal into itself. Escargot exploded with flavor and the charcuterie plate also could be an entree on it's own. The prices are reasonable given the fantastic skill that goes into each plate.

The issue with the waiter -- it seemed like he sized us up and decided we didn't deserve his full attention or respect.  When I heard another waiter describe the ""specials"" to the people at the next table I realized that our waiter skipped that formality. This was balanced out by while having a great glass of wine at the bar (on a different night, while waiting for our table).  The bartender stopped by to top off my wine glass without prompting.  He said he didn't have enough left in the bottle for a full glass anyway, so he was giving me the rest.

So my memory wasn't so good except that I had been on a date with a pretentious d-bag that night and that we rolled up to the valet in some kind of convertible. I spent the whole dinner trying to think of ways to end the evening early...but that was no commentary on the food. I think I had the roasted chicken the last time, which I remember a little. In any case, last night's experience was a little more mature, as I'm now married to someone who lived in France and we're both full-fledged francophiles, so that will have some bearing on this review. I'm a fan for a few reasons: First, the kitchen is open later during the week. Trust me when I say that a lot of cities don't have many restaurants that serve past 9. This alone is French. That said, here is what is funny: My husband, like another reviewer here, was fooled into thinking that the butter (which is great, by the way) is French. It's not. Our waiter told us that it's actually Grasslands butter. The bread is exquisite and Red Hen. We devoured two baskets of the stuff, which they kept coming (also very French). I had the salad which would have been merely average were it not for the dressing, which was some kind of champagne-dijon combination. I ate every morsel- as well I should have for a $7 salad! In any case, my husband got the French onion soup, which he said was good. But he always reminds me that authentic onion soup does not have the melted cheese on top. This is an American affectation. For dinner, I had the poached salmon with tomato-cucumber buerre blanc. It was absolutely delicious and I loved it for that and the simplicity. I spent a good deal of time sopping up the sauce with the aforementioned excellent bread (I know, uncouth!). My husband got the ragout (wild mushrooms over mashed potatoes). I tried his mashed potatoes and I had to proclaim them waaaaay too garlicky. Like, to the point where I still couldn't kiss him this morning! (Sorry, too much information?). We each also had a glass of wine- mine was a white burgundy which was very nice. He had a red of some sort. Our original server was a woman who was a bit too brusque for our taste but she was rescued by our other waiter, whom I believe was also the bartender...He was very friendly, professional and cool-- refilling our water glasses promptly, offering more bread and gently pushing dessert. Is this the BEST French restaurant in Chicago? Nah. Is it a bit overpriced. Oui! And it's definitely a teeny, tiny place that can get very loud when crowded. However, if you desire more attention and less crowding, come later on a weeknight and you will enjoy a very pleasant Frenchified meal.

For the entree I had the bouillabaisse which had clams, mussels, shrimp, and a light white fish in a delicious broth. All the seafood was cooked perfectly and the broth was so good that I ate it all up with a spoon. The rabbit is the specialty here I believe, it came highly recommended by the waitress. The bite I had was DELICIOUS! Another member of my party had the waygu beef entree and they were very pleased, noting the taste of the peppercorns and the sauce the beef was sitting upon. The restaurant is quite small, I felt like if I sneezed I was going to land in the lap of the poor couple behind us....that is how close the tables are. It is also a bit TOO NOISY. I was sitting at a table of 8 and could not hear what my friends were saying at all when they were only sitting 2 seats away from me. The restaurant also has a tendency to get rather cold when anyone walks in the door, this of course only really affects the tables in the front, but it is quite the temperature change.

Sure, you'll experience a ""bustling"" bistro atmosphere (complete with snobbish, tasteless young professionals), but the waitstaff and cuisine are both so inferior that the experience, overall, will be a let-down. The biggest failure of LeBouchon is, undoubtebly, the service. Although the restaurant is well-established, the dinning room managers have yet to master the reservation process. Every time I've visited with a reservation, I've had to wait 20-35 minutes to be seated. My last visit (which ""inspired"" this review) was absolutely appalling. Our server was worse than rude. I'm not being hyperbolic when I report that said server didn't even LOOK at us when she asked for our orders, and, when ""checking"" on our table said, ""How is everything - ok?"" as she was already WALKING AWAY from our table!

Speaking of wine glasses - the wine list, although expansive, is unimpressive and overpriced. Here, you'll find mediocre wines at very, very high prices.  The food would be considered bland by any French person (or anyone who has actually experienced French gastronomy). While butter and cream are plentiful in many dishes, everything on the menu is lacking in flavor, spices, and technique. I've visited LeBouchon a couple times, wrangled in by friends and co-workers who were hopeful that the cuisine would be deserving of the praises offered by many Chicagoans. Unfortunately, every time I visit, I'm always unimpressed, and I truly did give this place multiple opportunities.   Don't waste your money on this sub-par restaurant, when you have multiple other options for a proper French dining experience in Chicago!",-0.9202,0.819,0.073,0.107,0.3990780780780781
2012-01-13,5.0,"I have been coming to this awesome little neighborhood bistro for 10-plus years. They serve the BEST French Onion Soup in all of Chicago, have a menu that's updated weekly and some of the best French wines in all of Chicago. This is the place that OTHER tiny French bistros try to be. They have REAL nicotine stains on the wall because it's been open in the same location since the '90s. The atmosphere as as cozy as being in Paris. People will talk to each other at the close-knit tables all the time and recommend their regular meals. The wait staff is one of the best in the city when it comes to recommending what wine to have with what dish. They also are fun and approachable and not in any way snooty.  If you come here on a cold night have the Bouef Bourgignon, it's one of the best I've ever had and, unlike some other places, WILL fill you up. I can't say enough good things about our Bouchon.

Seriously guys, if you want a romantic but non-cheesy and not over the top date place, this is it.  We ordered Escargot for the table and may of us ordered the French Onion soup. Both were amazing, especially the soup which had just the right amount of gooey cheese bubbling over the side.  My sister and I both got the Lobster Macaroni (Les Macaronis Au Gratin Avec Homard Du Maine) which was amazing. Lobster and Mac n Cheese are probably two of my favorite foods so I figured I couldnt go wrong. My step-mom, the ever so adventurous eater decided she was going to go with Lapin Sauté Chasseur otherwise known as sauteed rabbit. Many of the guys ordered Boeuf Bourguignon.

Nice wine list with nothing too expensive and a lot of affordable wines. Service was very good at all times and the wait staff have a tough time getting around the restaurant as it so small.

The Mrs had the free range Chicken which was a huge portion and seasoned perfectly. I had the Wagyu Steak with french fries and Cognac sauce. A very heavy dish but I was really happy with it. Desserts were a huge let down and its an area they can work on. The Profiteroles tasted like they weren't fresh and were bought in. We didnt have coffee but we enjoyed our evening.

For an entree I ordered the rabbit and he ordered the beef bathed in wine. The beef was exquisite, but I quite liked the rabbit. It was my first time trying rabbit as well, so again, I had nothing else to compare it to. But, to me, it tasted exactly like chicken. Which is no complaint, it was delicious! As were the noodles that came with it! For a side we ordered their macaroni which was the best part of our meal! The dish was so delicious!  Finally, for dessert I ordered the creme brulee, since it's my favorite, and it was by far the best part of my entire experience here. Then again, who can go wrong with creme brulee! So delicious. My boyfriend had their pecan tart and didn't care too much for it though. I think the one thing I would complain about is their wait staff, which I was warned about on here.

I believe it's the ""1/2 off bottle of wine"" advertisement at the entrance that got us.  I thought the interior was great! I felt as if I just stepped into a mini France! It was quaint and wonderful. The tables were small and limited so there was a wait for a table. Le Bouchon seems like a place where people don't just quickly eat and go. I think the intimate, cozy atmosphere encourages their customers to relax, dine and enjoy a fabulous evening out. My friends and I waited at the bar and was greeted by the bartender. We popped a bottle of exquisite wine to start off the birthday evening. We waited for awhile and the bartender encouraged us to dine at the bar because the tables weren't moving.

I've never had a rabbit but the guy who sat next to me at the bar recommended it and told me tasted like chicken. It did. The rabbit was sauteed in a white wine sauce with vegetables.

We were waiting for two others to join us when the server asked if we wanted something to drink.  We discussed that we would like some bubbly and she gave a test of one particular one we were interested in. There was no high pressure sales involved but real service. We ordered the bubbles for our friends and the server kept it  on ice while we waited for them to arrive. When are friends did arrive she was on point with serving the drinks with perfect timing. She discussed the menu, explained everything so all of us knew what we were getting.  Our appetizer was mixed salad plate, all really balanced and delicious.  When the food did arrive it was exactly as described. I had the mussels in wine cream sauce. I am not a fan of cream sauce however they have changed my mind....it was perfectly seasoned and steaming hot. The food stayed hot the whole time we ate. Two steaks came as well for friends and they both noted seasoned well and cooked exactly how they ordered it. (by the way there was good French bread on the table.) There was also a lobster salad for another person in our party. Yeah real lobster and a big one. Not chopped up something on your plate but a real nice lobster. Excellent well balanced food great portions for the price and clearly the chefs and staff all work together as what is on the menu and described to you and than what shows on your plate is all the same.

We moved unto desserts which was a chocolate melty thing and a cheese plate. Great portions and again excellent well seasoned fresh ingredients. What needs to be said is the professional service and attention we were given. The server was there just when we wanted something and not over the top. Excellent excellent service.  Also note the place is clean, the tables were clean, the walls, the bar and the bathroom (thank you for not overly looking that.)

Recommend the poached salmon, filet and onion tart - however some dishes such as the nicoise salad, beef bourginon and pate are not as strong as the others. Details (Visit 1) I had the good fortune to be treated to Le Bouchon by my wife for birthday week. Birthday week is the best ever. We enjoyed nice crisp bread, welcoming service, then a sweet onion tart and one of the nicest french onion soups out of all the French restaurants we have had the fortune to enjoy. From the full and busy bar, cocktails were delicious. For entrees, a succulent poached salmon, and the steak and frites. The salmon was subtle and in a delicious sauce, while for the steak, nicely seared and full of flavor. The frites were delicious, full of flavor and not too salty and the herb butter made it all the more delectable. Gents, this is a manly dish to be enjoyed indeed! We enjoyed a half bottle of wine, and finished with dessert - creme brulee and chocolate mousse which was rich and velvety. This place was really welcoming and all class. Looking forward to working our way through the menu here, especially all the classics. We arrived here reasonably early, and when we looked up it was full. Obviously the word is out. Details (Visit 2) Spurred on by our great initial experience, we tried the beef bourginon, pate and nicoise salad. The beef was a bit dry and tough - it did not have a burst of wine flavor that I usually associate with a good bourginon. The nicoise salad was average and the pate was pretty meh actually.

It was Friday night but we weren't looking for a loud and exciting bar-type place, we just wanted to relax, chill and try something new.   Walked into Le Bouchon around 9:30pm....it was packed but with one table open (what a coincidence). ;) We sat down and were greeted with wonderful service, welcoming smiles and a list of featured menu items for the evening.   My husband ordered the Boeuf Bourguignon  (Beef Braised in Red Wine) and I went with a special of the night - Sauteed Skate Fish with Spinach & Boiled Potatoes.  We both enjoyed a glass of red wine and bread/butter while we waited for the food to arrive, which was also delicious. The food we ordered didn't seem like anything too far out of the ordinary, so I assumed I would like it and didn't have super high expectations, but Holy Wow! - I really cannot describe how tasty every morsel of it was....it was the perfect amount of flavors and textures and portions.  We both cleaned our plates, as if we hadn't eaten in weeks.  I was almost a little embarrassed when the waitress came over to take our plates - there was literally nothing left on them! Sarcastically, she said ""I'll have this boxed up for you"" as she picked up the empty plates. Since we hadn't planned on going out big that night, the plan was to just have a nice entree and glass of wine and head home, but after such a spectacular meal - we really couldn't stop ourselves.  The temptation of cappuccinos and cream puffs covered in chocolate sauce became entirely too impossible to resist.  We gave in and indulged in some naughty after-dinner sweets that were literally the icing on the cake.

The duck was, true to my memory ere my exile, excellent; tender and savory while balanced by the sweetness of the Grand Marnier sauce.  My appetite was stimulated by a well crafted Manhattan or two, and a hearty and savory French onion soup.  We commandeered the Southern Rhone for our wine and celebrated our gustatory victory with chocolate mousse and profiteroles.  They were as divine as Joan of Arc.

Before I go on, I will say that I have worked in many restaurants, and have over 14 years experience, so I understand the meaning of a full house or a busy rush. Here's a tip though, if you are in the customer service business, you better provide it or you won't have a business for very long. The end of this story is that when I called to check on the status of the gc, since my friend hadn't received it after I paid for it a week earlier, I was told there was no way they could check to see if it went out or not and I should just wait a few days.

For dinner we had the braised lamb shank - a huge portion of meat over cous cous and sauteed spinach, and the bouillabaisse ""Le Bouchon"" - a seafood medley in a saffron and herb broth. Again, both dishes were excellent. For dessert we shared the biggest creme brulee I've ever eaten and a Christmas cake special dessert.

There were no seats at the bar, and the servers pushed us around (we're both very slim, we don't take up a lot of space). When two people left the bar, she practically ordered us to sit, apparently so we could wait another half-hour.  My husband finally asked her if we'd been forgotten.  Another 10 minutes, then she told us our table would be ready ""in about 30 seconds, but it might take 35.""  Rather sarcastic.   Meanwhile, we'd ordered a split of wine, but the bartender poured from a full-size bottle. We assumed they were out of splits and would sell the other half by the glass. But the server brought the bottle to our table, and looked distressed when we said we'd ordered a split.  We didn't want to make a fuss, so we said okay, we'd take the full bottle (we would have preferred to order something else).   The food was fine, altho the lobster mac had very little lobster-- but service was so slow that at 10:30, we were still waiting to order dessert.  We decided to skip it and get the check, telling the server we were disappointed in the service, especially since it was our anniversary (we hadn't mentioned it earlier because we weren't looking for special treatment -- just normal good service).  She apologized, brought us free desserts to go and said they'd only charge us for a split, since that's what we ordered -- but they should have offered that in the first place. She said they'd been slowed down by a party of 10 -- a group of 20-somethings who apparently did ask for special attention, since they got the usual birthday dessert and song.  I replied that their demands shouldn't have precluded normal service to us, especially if they hadn't reserved their table.  We then realized that the crowd was younger than we'd ever seen there before, and they'd been playing very un-bistro-like dance music,   and we realized that probably no one over 40 was welcome there anymore.  As in a lot of lesser Bucktown restaurants.

I was nice enough and swapped him apps half way through so he could get some of the french onion deliciousness.

The fish alone didn't have much flavor or seasoning. My boyfriend once again ordered the wrong thing on the menu...the Lamb Shank and he absolutely hated it.

We were absolutely shocked to get an 8:30 pm reservation...which by Le Bouchon standards really means 9 pm, but we were just glad to get a table at all considering how packed the place was...and by the way the hostess was extremely thoughtful, she even saved two seats at the bar for us while we waited. We started with the country pate and egg and pancetta salad. The pate was surprisingly milder and leaner than most pates I have had and the salami that accompanied the pate was peppery and delicious. I loved the egg and pancetta salad - a light oil dressing over mixed greens with a perfectly cooked egg and crispy pancetta. Yum. I ordered the Halibut for my entree (the special that night).  The fish was incredible. What stood out to me was the beautifully prepared sauce they had cooked the fish in, of course they had used plenty of butter, but it was so well balanced with bright acids that it really complemented the qualities of the halibut.   For dessert we ordered the chocolate mouse, which was delicious as well.

2010-05-19,3.0,"What an adorable little place in Bucktown. AND a $25 Tuesday night prix fixe special? AND French food you say? Well, ok. Twist my arm. This was my first time at this seemingly popular restaurant.  I am very glad we had a 6:30 reservation as, by the time we left at 8:30, people were practically hanging from the ceiling it was so packed in there! The food was good. For starters, I had the tarte a l'oignon-very tasty. The crust wasn't as flaky or buttery as I was hoping for, and maybe a little overdone on the bottom, but still good. My friend had the Moules Marinière. Nice plump mussels with a white wine cream sauce. Yummy! I probably would get that next time. For the main, I had the boeuf bourguignon. The sauce was really delicious. The meat-very tender. The only thing I thought was a little weird was that there were snow peas and carrots mixed in. Snow peas don't really say ""French"" to me, but that sauce could go on cardboard and make it taste good.  My friend had the hangar steak as recommended by the waitress, and was quite happy. It came with some lovely French green beans and mashed potatoes. Dessert-the best part. I had the crème brulée. It was a really large serving, definitely enough to share for two people. My friend had the profiteroles which looked amazing.  Wine here was a little pricey. $9 a glass for the most part, or $60-ish for a bottle.  Service left a little to be desired. Our waitress might have been having a bad night, but she was a little short with us. Only came over once to check on us. I had a dirty spoon and had to flag down someone else because she really never even looked our way after we had our food.  When the check came, rather than thanking us and setting it down, she was actually talking to the table next to us and slapped it down on the table behind her back without saying a word. Yikes!

I called last minute and was able to have a table reserved for two within a half hour of my call on a Saturday night. My friend and I ordered from the $25 pre-fix menu. I had the French Onion Soup, Garlic Chicken and Chocolate dessert. The french onion soup was different than most I have had (I am a lover of french onion soup). The cheese was wonderful, however, the broth was the different part. It was a little bit buttery and yellow/white in color as opposed to the darker red wine broths that are generally served with french onion soups. It was very good, though not the best I have had. The chicken was a little dry and the garlic came as whole cloves still in their shells. It was difficult to break the chicken away from the bone, but the taste was good. The sauce it was in was a bit salty. The au gratin potatoes were more like a potato pancake than a cheesy potato. They lacked  flavor. The dessert was fantastic. It was rich and creamy like a truffle and drizzled with an espresso flavored sauce served with a dollop of homemade whipped cream.  I was a bit upset the wait staff did not come to ask if we wanted tea or coffee with our dessert. I guess they assumed since we didn't order wine we only wanted the pre-fix menu. Also the wait staff did not smile. They got us what we needed (water glasses always full, flatware etc without having to ask), but did not go out of their way to be polite.

Authenticity?  Frugality?  Great--now how is the food?  In a word, satisfying.  This is not fancy-pants French but rather basic, traditional French--essentially, French comfort food.  But when done well, that can be some of the best cuisine in the world.  First came some phenomenal bread--seriously some of the best restaurant bread out there.  (Thankfully our meal was perfectly paced and I was not tempted to ask for a second basket.)  I had the onion tart, the bouillabaisse ""le bouchon,"" a few bites of the boeuf bourguignon, and the profiteroles to finish.  The meal got better and better with each course.  The onion tart was earthy and rich, if a little boring; the bouillabaisse lively and savory, with lovely broth and large, meaty chunks of fish; and the profiteroles simply heavenly. A prix fixe dinner is a wonderful thing in any instance.  But in the case of Le Bouchon, we are talking about ANY starter, ANY entree, and ANY dessert, all for $25.  So, along with a great price and delicious food, you get CHOICE.  The best of France and America shaking hands.",0.9981,0.698,0.287,0.015,0.5456845238095239

My main course was Beef Bourguignon.  While also piping hot (owww!) it was deeeelicious.  The beef was perfectly cooked - tender and tasty.  The vegetable complements were equally divine.  I ate every last bite (and sopped up every last bit of sauce). To continue the ""French Standards"" theme, I had Crème Brûlée for dessert.  It was fantastic - from the glazed crust to the soft cream. However, by this point, Dinner Partner and I were schvitzing (yep, I just threw some Yiddish in my French review).  Like the food, the restaurant itself was a touch too warm.  This was not helped much by the fact that our neighbors on both sides of our table were thisclose.  Our poor server had to climb over people and smoosh herself in between tables to do her job.  Oy!  (more Yiddish!)",0.9894,0.838,0.138,0.025,0.47878264208909366

To wit: The snails were great, but I always love these pudgy little buttery bastards. Even more appealing is to sop up the garlicky butter with the delicious bread they have here. Yes, this was the good part. But frankly, any French restaurant worth their sel is going to do escargot well. But anyway, yum, these guys were great.

2010-02-19,3.0,"This was a confusing experience. I sort of feel like I need to come back to try it out again but the price point will prevent me from doing that. I spent $50 on lunch (including tax and tip). $50! I ordered two items and a half bottle of wine -- with a friend. Splitting the bill down the middle came to $50. A HALF bottle of wine (rec. by the waiter before I arrived) was $30. That kind of markup is nauseating. You didn't pass your costs onto me. You passed your kid's college tuition onto me.  not.having.it . The wine was decent. It didn't pair with half of my meal, so I couldn't drink it for a good chunk of my time at Le Bouchon. You would think the waiter would know better than to suggest a wine that doesn't pair well with popular dishes. But, maybe, the price point was more important than taste concerns. I began my meal with the French Onion Soup. It was served blazing hot and was entirely delicious. No, really. It was the best French Onion Soup I have ever tasted. The onion/cheese/stock combo, however, clashed horribly with our wine and made every sip of the wine taste like skunked Franzia. When paying $30 for a HALF bottle of wine, you can imagine how pleased I was at the turn of events. I mentioned this terrible pairing to the waiter as an FYI. He stick his nose (literally) into our bottle and said, ""Smells fine to me."" 1.) Gross; 2.) The problem wasn't the wine, it was the pairing. I imagine that many of Le Bouchon's patrons order the French Onion soup. In order to prevent them from having a bad taste experience, my suggestion was to stop pairing that particular wine with the soup. I didn't offer an invitation to drink from my waiter's nose. Again, gross. For my meal, I ordered the cassoulet. It was prepared well. It, too, came out blazingly hot. The cassoulet came with lamb, duck and pork. The beans were cooked just right. The seasoning was delicious. The duck was my favorite meat of the dish. It was served on the bone, tender and not at all greasy or gamey. The lamb was nice. It came in a sausage form and, therefore, the meat was minced. It's not the way I prefer my lamb, but I ate it. I wasn't a big fan of the pork. It came in big pink slabs similar to country ham but more 'trichy' in appearance. I stayed away from it. When I think 'pork', I think 'white/gray.' When I think 'ham', I think 'pink.' I know it's the same animal but I wasn't prepared for it. Generally, when I see big slabs of pink meat, I tend to avoid it. That's just me. My friend and I were the first people to arrive for lunch. It was nice having the place to ourselves. In short time, the restaurant began filling up. Rather than spacing us out, all the patrons were seated next to one another. Le Bouchon is a small restaurant. In Chicago. In America. Translation: we're big people. We need space. We are not skinny super models who eat lunches of cigarettes, coffee and ennui (except for me; my skinniness is awesome). I hated the cramped dining experience. If I were in a cafe in Paris, no sweat. On Damen in Chicago -- for lunch -- no. No way. To add to the discomfort, a hot fan blew on my dining companion and me for the latter part of our meal.

I used to go relatively frequently, but this was my first time visiting since I moved back to Chicago this fall. I have some wonderful memories of that place. I once tasted a profiterole there that stopped me dead in my tracks. When I signaled the server and gave my compliments, she informed me that, by coincidence, Jean Claude himself had made the chocolate sauce that day. Superb! But Tuesday was a real let down. The steak was so tough it was literally inedible. It was pink in the middle (we hadn't ordered it well-done or anything crazy), just too chewy. I could complain about the Apple Tart and the meager cheese plate as well, but really the steak was the problem. I'm hoping it was just a fluke. The rest of our food was delicious, as always. Plus cassoulet isn't served on Tuesdays, so I have to go back anyways.

Pros: -The food is generally good, our steak notwithstanding. -It's intimate, but not romantic. -You can find out if your date is a sophisticate (""Oh my God, what do I order?"" she airily asked) -There's enough background noise to cover up those pesky awkward silences (In case you can't come up with this mid-entrée gem: ""I've spent a lot of time on boats."")

French Onion Soup, Steak Frites, simple salad, cassoulet... to top it off, I always order the profiteroles for dessert.  My only beef is that I always have to wait so darn long. There are not so many tables in this joint. It seems like that on a weekend, there is not much point to make a reservation as you end up waiting so long.

Being born and bred in downtown and being somewhat a creature of habit I wanted to try something new.I have a hard time with a lot of the trendy restaurants in the city as IF I'm going to cough up more then $120 on a meal I would rather just go to do Avec, Blackbird OR Joe Stone Crab. I recently tried The Bristol and was not impressed.  Le Bouchon was great if your looking for a cozy intimate setting. The restaurant is a bit cramped, but I thought that just added to the ambiance. It took our waiter a few minutes to come to the table, BUT he was perspiring when he arrived so I knew he was working hard. We started out with the French Onion Soup which was great. We split the mussels which were fairly good. For the entrees, my date had the Skate which she thoroughly enjoyed and I had the duck and mashed potatoes (although it had some fancy name which I can't remember off the top of my head). It was absolutely fantastic.  If you're looking for a intimate date place and can deal with being a little cramped...I highly recommend Le Bouchon over most of the ""Foo Foo""/ Trendy restaurants in Bucktown area.",0.9818,0.851,0.129,0.02,0.5727536231884057
2010-01-17,5.0,"This remains one of our favorite restaurants for traditional French fare. And our favorite for cassoulet in winter.  I started with a half order of nice tender sweetbreads (with too much sauce), then went to our reason for being at Le Bouchon - their cassoulet. From Wikipedia: ""Cassoulet is a rich, slow-cooked bean stew or casserole originating in the south of France, containing meat (typically pork sausages, pork, goose, duck and sometimes mutton), pork skin (couennes) and white haricot beans."" More on cassoulet later.  I finished with the selection of French cheeses and the remains of my wife's crème brulee. With white wine, red wine, and hot tea. A delicious French meal in a crowded little bistro. As always we were immediately seated for our 7:30 reservation, and, as always, I noticed people waiting for tables by 9:00.  A suggestion if I may: If you're not yet a fan of French cooking, at least give cassoulet a try. On a cold Chicago night, it's perfect. It's like turkey at Thanksgiving or cake on your birthday. It's an institution. Cassoulet tastes perfect in winter. It's filling; it's hearty; and all the meats taste wonderful. I have no interest in having cassoulet on a hot summer day. And it's too complicated to make at home, with all those different meats slow cooked in one pot. This hearty dish just warms you up on a cold night. After a few years, like us you'll start planning your cassoulet night when the serious cold weather comes in each winter. And, if new to French cooking, it'll give you a sample of the range of French foods.",0.9859,0.848,0.132,0.019,0.5191077441077442

It was like 2 degrees out this day and I was waiting to valet my car.  My girlfriends were already inside the restaurant (which by the way is ITTY-BITTY, very hard to maneuver and totally annoying to stand around in) -- I had texted the girls that I was outside and to just sit without me I had to wait for the valet guy and there was another car in front of me.  The hostess refused to seat them. Really? The restaurant is super close quarters, wouldn't you WANT to get people the heck out of the way? Maybe let them sit down and regroup for a moment and order a drink while they wait the 5 mins for me to get in?  Nope. Made them stand in the middle of the restaurant the whole time while waiters/patrons are stepping all over them and their shoes. We had reservations by the way. So, I finally get in and we sit.  There are 4 empty tables in this place and the hostess attempts to seat us right by the door. Um, no, sorry, not going to happen. It's freezing out -- can't you sit us at a table not up by the door? Shouldn't that be a last resort?  Ridiculous. As soon as we sat down we ordered a bottle of wine -- about $50 bottle for 2 of us to split.  The other girl ordered a grey goose/soda. We decided to split 2 of the prix-fix meals, cause let's face it, it's a lot of food.  You would have thought we all went in and split a small garden salad -- our waitress was PISSED.  Really? Lady, we just ordered $60 worth of drinks -- you're not getting a small bill here.  After this we never saw her again until we were ready to order dessert.  RUDE! The bill comes ... it's $123 and some change -- as usual, I still over-tipped.  Sheesh people, you never know who you are waiting on that used to bartend or waitress. Just because we only got 2 meals (which we couldn't freaking finish -- can't imagine how much would have been wasted if we got 3) didn't mean you were going to get stiffed.   It would take a lot to get me back in here after this experience.  I can't believe how rude and snotty the people were.  Ugh, never, ever again.",-0.9225,0.879,0.044,0.077,0.4069885361552028

The tables are close together so don't go if you don't want to know what everyone around you is talking about.

For our entrees, we both had fish. I had the fish special of the day which was grilled halibut over rice and it came with a ratatouille that was an amazing blend of flavors. The other fish entree was a poached salmon- while blander in taste- it was perfect!  Know before you go that this place is good if you are on a budget. They have a $25 prix fixe dinner each night- 3 course dinner including an appetizer, entree and dessert. A pretty good deal that includes many of their most popular dishes like french onion soup, steak and an apple tart.  Service was spot on given the tight quarters (I sure wouldn't want to negotiate that space with plates of food on my arm!)

In the other French restaurant is was B.Y.O.B., we didn't know, although I should have asked, so the waitress looked at us like terrorists and went and tattled to another waiter. He was very polite and stated we couldn't bring our own liquor. Why couldn't she have done the same and spoke to us herself?  Furthermore, two people shared the duck, and we were charged $21 more for two, which made the prefix $36.50.

I ordered the Escargot which were tender and in a butter/herb sauce (great for dipping the bread it). Entrees:  Each ordered the special Monkfish with mashed potatoes (whipped and light - my favorite) and sauteed spinach. So good I had dreams about it! Dessert: We split the Creme Brulee & Chocolate mouse (do not be alarmed that it is just small and dense) it is larger than life with it's impact - rich, chocalaty and delicate! The Creme Brulee is my new favorite - I almost licked the bowl clean.  Our server was great and made fantastic recommendations especially with the wine.",0.997,0.682,0.318,0.0,0.6902597402597404
2009-06-28,5.0,"I love french food, and I have usually been disappointed when I have gone to any french restaurant around here.  This was definitely not the case at Le Bouchon. My wife and I went this weekend.  We had an appetizer and a main dish each, as well as dessert.  All dishes were superb and without question the closest to the real thing that I've had in Chicago so far.  For appetizers, we had the escargot and the blood sausage (my favorite), for the main dish we had the rabbit and roasted duck leg, and for dessert a creme brule.  Each of these dishes was very authentic and very flavorful.  If I had to be critical about anything, I would say that the portions of the main plates are too big, but who's going to complain about that anyway? It's a littel cramped in here, but I didn't think it was uncomfortable or bad in any way.  Given the size of this place though (tiny), reservations are definitely recommended.  Also, prices are very reasonable for the quality of food you get.  We spent a lot more at most other french restaurants we've gone to in the city, and the food was not nearly as good anywhere else.  Highly recommended!",-0.6125,0.84,0.075,0.084,0.5047126436781608
2009-06-24,4.0,"Le Bouchon Is very small and quant. I went on Wednesday when the Prix Fixe menu was an option. For $25.00 I received my starter, entrée, and desert. I would recommend setting a reservation for anything more than two people. The meals are long, and if you don't have a reservation you will most likely not get in, or end up waiting for a while. We had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated, while we waited a couple of us stood at the bar. The place is real small, while we stood at the bar we felt like we where in the way of the waiters, and bus boy. By the time we sat at 7:45 PM there was no more rabbit, or duck, but other than that everything on the menu was at play. I had the seafood gratin as my starter. It was very good; it was a good portion size, enough to allow me to experience the savory flavor and taste, but not too much to ruin my appetite for dinner. There is a nice time gap between the courses, hence extending our dinner outing for two and half hours. The great part about that, is it allowed us to digest and eat at a good pace, talk and drink before the next item comes. The bad part is, if you want a quick meal don't go to this place. If you want a nice meal with friend go here. My I had the chicken entrée, it was very good. The tasted was not out of this world, but it was definitely good. The portion size was amazing. I ate half my entrée and was full. The leftover was packed always nicely for me.  For desert I had the puff pastry, with ice cream and chocolate sauce. The chocolate sauce was delicious; however the desert as a whole left me expecting more.  In summary the $25 Prix Fixe, does save about 10-15 over what you would normal spend, the restaurant seems like it would be a place to go during the non prix fixe days as it should not be that much more expensive. The food was great, but I have better. The Atmosphere is beautiful and has a great ambience, but its really loud, and hard to hear the people sitting across from you.",0.9981,0.753,0.217,0.03,0.6049166666666665

2009-06-10,4.0,"I went to Le Bouchon for the 1st time last night and had fantastic experience.  We wnet on Tuesday which is the night when you have a $25 Prix Fixe menu consisting of everything on the menu.  Any app, any entree and any desert for $25 Dollars. Woah, $25 Dollars has never been more well spent. SIDE NOTE: They have a $25 dollar Prix Fixe menu everyday. But that only has two app choices, two entree choices and one dessert choice. But it still all sounded really good. They also have 1/2 price wine on Monday. So you could do the limited prix fixe and have 1/2 price wine. I'll be back. /SIDE NOTE. The place is very quaint in side but also very small, especially on tuesday, you need to make reservations.  You will be sitting well within ear shot of your neighbors, but then you can ask what they like to get. I mean it is really small. You've been warned. I went with Amanda, Zak, MY brother and our Friends Lauren and Trevor. We had 2 bottles of wine (we wanted to make sure and counteract the fact that we only spent 25 on food :-/ ) Which were delicious and well worth getting. the least expensive bottles were just under 40 which is pretty good. The ones we had were about 60. And they were quite tasty. Our waitress was very helpful in picking out the wine and also had opinions on what dishes were best.  I hate when you ask servers their opinion and they are too timid to sway you in one direction. If I ask I want to know what you think. She was also very attentive and nice. On to the food: We all tried each others dishes so I'll just give you a run down of things I tried. Appateziers/Salads, The salad that had big croutons and fat back was great. It was just a salad but a nice combination of flavors. The Muscles in White Wine sauce was pitch perfect. I love muscles and the sauce was creamy but not too creamy and had a flavor that really complimented the muscles. You know I was dipping some bread in the left over sauce. The Onion Tart was ok. It was a little heavy and large for an app. I would say it was the least good. The other salad was an assortment of celery root, beets, lentils and something else I can't remember. For me it wasn't too memorable but was a nice sampling of a variey of flavors. My only complaint would be that the celery root was a little mayoish. But it was also good. I would say the muscles were the clear winner. But the salads were definitely good if you want salad. The Main Courses really took Le Bouchon to the top in my book. I had the hangar steak. Nice crisp crust outside. Cooked the way I wanted it. The crust had a little spice to it. It was in a delicious red wine sauce. And came with mashed potatoes and greenbeans. The beans had a little buttery sauce on them which was great and the potatos were creamy and mixed perfectly with the red wine sauce. Amanda had the Chicken (I believe with Sage, Rosemary and Thyme [yes Simon and Garfunkle jokes were made]). It was succulent. It came with a ton of roasted garlic and really was delicious. I believe it is on the everyday Prix Fix and I would reccomend it. Lauren and Zak had the Bouillabaisse which has a saffron broth. Being a big fan of saffron I adored this dish. I loved my steak (as I love steak in general) but this was good enough to make me wish I had gotten the Bouillabaisse. It had clams, muscles, shrimp and fish. The piece of fish i had was soaked in the broth and was amazing. My Brother had the Lamb with couscous which was also delicious. I thought the cous cous was a little dry but the lamb meat was perfectly flavored and prepared.  I would reccomend any of the dishes really. But if you like seafood and saffron get the Bouillabaisse. SIDE NOTE: The portions were quite large for French Cuisine. Not too big but larger than expected and very satisfying. On to Dessert: I had berries and cream. Delicious. But there's only so much you can do with the 2. Others had the profittoroles which were ok not my favorite to begin with. The mouse which was really good and rich. Well balanced deset. And finally the apple tart. I didn't care for it som uch but Lauren raved about it and finished the entire plate. So if you like apple tarts try theirs. It was a very comfortable dining experience despite close quarters and the occasional bump in the arm. I enjoyed the atmosphere, the staff and the food. I will definitely go back. i would definitely recommend giving it a try. Go on monday or tuesday first to get a bit of a discount. However it would be worth a visit any night of the week.",0.9997,0.737,0.233,0.03,0.5475812368972749

I actually like that the restaurant hasn't gone the way of ultra trendy decor and food. Sometimes you just want comfortable, familiar, and classic.  We've been to Le Bouchon multiple times on Monday nights to take advantage of 1/2 price bottles of wine. Yes, the tables are close and it's a bit loud, but it's exactly like the cafes in Paris. We've never had to wait for a table (though granted, we come on Monday nights), and though the waitstaff doesn't fawn all over you, which I can't stand anyway, servers are knowledgeable and attentive.  We cannot get enough of the blood sausage - it is amazing. Also love the salad Lyonnaise, onion soup, and cassoulet. The apple tart and chocolate mousse are a tasty way to round out the meal.

2009-05-21,4.0,"I passed by this restaurant so many times and only decided to peep last week. After having watched matinee at Steppenwolf we realized that we were all dressed up, hungry and no reservation on Saturday evening. We made rather cursory stop at Le Bouchon because, we were dressed up and the mood commanded something romantic like French. So French it was. We were greeted at the door by lovely hostess and led to tiny bar. The decor is country, bistro-like French. I placed an order of vodka; the bartender poured a generous serving of Grey Goose. Yums!  As I sat sipping on my drink, halfway through we were beckoned to the table. I was instantly squeezed between noisy foursome from somewhere like Schaumburg or Gold Coast but definitely not from hip Bucktown, and lovely couple who debated about house duck.  -Yes, I would like to have blood sausage. Seafood bouillabaisse and side of balsamic vinaigrette please.  The closest gentleman from foursome couple: ""OMG, I love MK. Their wine selection is absolutely marvelous""....his remarks were accompanied with approving giggle of female companions. The other gentleman seated opposite of him decided that it is appropriate to chuckle and remark something about exceptional taste somewhere else too...  -Here is your blood sausage mam, our server in burgundy lipstick approached us. I wondered if she wears that color to inspire diners to drink more burgundy or it's just act of class...I chewed on my sausage until bloody lips would reappear again to serve my bouillabaisse. The sausage was awesome, chomp, chomp. As I continued chewing on what was left of my sausage I noticed they have great deals on wine and champagne. Cute couple behind us was served with the duck that I had initially my eye on. Out of curiosity I turned around and enquired about the duck. The female, porcelain-skin, nervous blond remarked how her partner keeps feeding her with all these good stuff, but yeah she said it was awesome. I switched quickly my focus from duck to her companion and turned back to my plate and waited for my bouillabaisse.  -Your bouillabaisse madam. I dipped the bread chip in the sauce and there it was; little thick, yet soft in texture, sweet wine combined with vinegar taste. After finishing with meat substance I scraped off sauce with the table fries. Best bouillabaisse ever!  -Excuse me! One of the gentlemen from foursome stood up and approached the server. ""Do you know any bars around here that we can go?"" -Any desserts? The bloody lips reappeared again as I was eavesdropping on foursome's decision for the next stop by. -Yes, crème brulée please.  The reason I gave Le Bouchon 4 stars is that, it's a French restaurant that doesn't perhaps pay attention to their pastries. Desserts in French culinary is like barbeque in American, without good pastry the meal was little incomplete. And by the way, MK do have amazing crème brulée.",0.9982,0.779,0.189,0.032,0.4440972222222222

I went with two appetizers, the mussels and onion tart.  It was definitely enough food, but the onion tart didn't taste as fresh, and the mussels were a little gritty.  Our desserts were simple and delicious as well.  That 3-course meal is definitely a steal for the quality and quantity of food!

Last night I discovered the key to an enjoyable dinner at Le Bouchon- the early bird special! Our party of 6 1/2 people (one gal is pregno) arrived at 5:30 PM last night and for the first half of our meal had the bistro to ourselves. The service was great and we left with enough time to catch the 7:30 PM Ohio State game, which made the boys happy. The food was as good as I remembered.  Not the healthiest of meals, but I don't think healthy is quite what Le Bouchon is going for with all that butter, cream, and garlic. We ordered 3 appetizers for the table: The mussels: I think I used a loaf of their delicious bread to soak it up. Escargot: I always thought I didn't like escargot, but I realized last night what's not to like about slimy chunks of garlic.  Onion Tart: Ordered this at the suggestion of our waitress and it was by far the best thing i ate all night. A must!! For my main entree I ordered the free range chicken. I'm not usually a chicken lover, but for some reason do really enjoy it at French restaurants. It was so tasty, but so garlicy that I brushed my teeth about 5 times when I got home last night. Perhaps not the best date spot?  I also LOVED the potato side that came with the chicken. My husband really enjoyed his rabbit, which I thought was just OK. Then again I don't really like rabbit so who am I to judge. No room left for dessert, but can't pass it up here so my hubby and I split  berries with cream- the perfect ending to a perfect meal! I also had a bite of the apple caramel dessert one of our friends ordered. It looked suspiciously similar to the onion tart, but this one was loaded with lots of apple and caramel...YUM!

My husband and I went here on his birthday, and it happened to be the Tuesday fixed price night, which is a great deal. It was early and not crowded. Our starters where good - the onion soup and a nice goat cheese salad. However, then everything started to go downhill. Our waiter began to completely ignore us in favor of the people he knew at the table next to us (about 2 feet away).  They got great service and had a wonderful time. We did not. We had to pour our own wine. It was not easy since there was no room on the table for it, so it was instead directly behind me on top of the booth railing. Not cool. He did not ask the mandatory, ""how is everything here?"". Huge strike. Our plates did not get bused.  When he brought the check, he then asked us if we wanted coffee. AFTER our deserts where long gone. Yeah, coffee would have been nice. Twenty minutes ago.  If the service was the only thing wrong, then I would be willing to give this place another try. However, the entrees also disappointed. The braised lamb was so tough that I needed a knife to cut it. My husband's fish special was soggy, salty, and overly seasoned.  The chocolate desert tasted fine, but my lemon tart presentation was awful. It was cracked in half and served in 2 pieces. Seriously? This is a restaurant, right? Cut me another slice that was not dropped. How do I know it didn't fall on the floor? But I couldn't request another piece since the waiter avoided all eye contact.

For dessert, we wanted the apple tarte but they ran out.  Instead, we had the lemon tart and the chocolate mousse.  The reason why we had both is b/c it was so loud that the server didn't hear me say lemon tarte, but instead he heard chocolate mousse.  Again, the server was very nice and let us enjoy the chocolate mousse as well as the lemon tarte.

The wine was great too,,,however we got the cheese plate and we both thought that it should have been a more generous serving of cheese. Did I mention I'm from Chicago?

The place is small and very intimate, and you are guaranteed to be bumping elbows with your fellow diners. Service wasn't too bad, but you can't expect too much since the waiters themselves are twisting and turning to avoid customers and each other. We had the escargot and the seasonal salads, bistro style. The escargot was good, but not the best I had. They were baked in a buttery, olive oil, pesto sauce. The season salad, on the other hand, was terrible. Don't get it.  Maybe I'm just not a fan of bistro French salads. My boyfriend ordered the grilled steak with house butter, which he absolutely loved and raved about. I had the grilled hanger steak, which was delicious and perfectly made medium rare. For dessert we ordered the puff pastries, which I was disappointed in. They were kinda stale and not at all ""puffy"". I think I've had better frozen ones purchased at Sam's club.

On the contrary, our waitstaff was top notch - they matched the wine with the entrees and described the specials quite well. My wife had the seafood soup (I forget the name!) as I ordered the NY Steak (the special). I ordered it medium rare and it came medium well. It was okay and due to the little bit of wait to get our food, I didn't want to push returning it. In all, it was a grand experience. I definitely give props to the waitstaff again when I accidentally knocked my wine glass over and saw red dots appear all over the woman at the next table! We were very embarrased.

Yes the space is tight, and yes you'll rub elbows with your neighbors... but that's part of French culture, so if you want to remain anonymous in your meal go to any number of the other nearby places.

Dessert was coffee and one of the best creme brulees I've ever had.  The burned sugar topping cracked just right!  There's nothing more disappointing than getting this dessert at a French restaurant, going to crack the surface and... the spoon goes in as it would into a bowl of overpriced pudding.  What a mood-killer!  So, thank goodness Le Bouchon was able to finish off my dinner with dessert done correctly.  The tables were a bit close together and the music tended to be distracting.  If they had switched the music from Dance Remix Extravaganza to some more ""French-sounding"" music, or something less intrusive, then it would have felt more intimate as opposed to claustrophobic.  The waiter was informative and attentive, though his math skills could use a little work.  :)    So overall, a good experience.  I'd probably only ever go back on the discount Tuesdays, but the occasion still made for an enjoyable, romantic evening.  For my favorite French restaurant in the city, I'd recommend Bistro Campagne in Lincoln Square.  Review coming soon?  Perhaps!",0.9979,0.799,0.183,0.018,0.5014939309056957
