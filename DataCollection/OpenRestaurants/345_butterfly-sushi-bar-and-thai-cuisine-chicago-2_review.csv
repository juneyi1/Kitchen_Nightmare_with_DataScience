2017-07-31,4.0,"First off I'm going to start off by saying that I absolutely LOVE the decor and the food presentation. We walked in and we were greeted right away. It was fairly busy but the service was great! We had 2 orders of crab rangoon which came out fresh and was delicious. We all enjoyed it.  We ordered Pad Thai which was alright. Not the best I've had, but it was good. We opted for the spice on the side since we all pretty much shared everything.  The Spicy Salmon, Philly and California Rolls were all fresh. They served the sushi around this really cool dome of ice. We ordered a speciality roll that was served separately with an extra special presentation that I couldn't really describe if I wanted to. Sorry guys, I'm slow! Check out the pics for the presentation on that one. I didn't really care for that roll but everyone else did, so it was just my personal taste buds.  The Thai Iced tea was on point! For dessert we were a little disappointed because we all wanted to order different Mochi's and they only had one flavor. Really wanted strawberry. Boooooo. The mango one was alright, but not exactly what I wanted.  We ate all of this for less than $60. Beautiful restaurant, yummy food and great service. I'd definitely go back.",0.9969,0.702,0.266,0.032,0.511520737327189

It's truly the best chicken pad thai I have ever had in my life, and from any city. And they give you these mini plastic containers of red chili oil which adds the best kick to the dish. Just enough heat to make you want to finish the entire plate. Oh and the portions are HUGE. For $9, you get dinner and then leftovers for lunch the next day. (Currently salivating as I'm typing.) Also, their gyoza is top notch. Their egg rolls are amazing. I guess it's not really fair to critique those because anything fried is going to be amazing, let's be real. As for sushi, I personally don't eat sushi, but all of my friends and family rave about it. If you plan on dining there, it's BYOB which makes me wish I can give them 6 stars!

The seafood salad is plentiful and flavorful. Finally, their basil fried rice is FANTASTIC. At the end they even gave us a complimentary cheesecake dessert!

There is never a time I'll turn down sushi, so we checked out Postmates and Butterfly fit the bill.  I have a bit of a sweet potato maki obsession so surely had to try Butterfly's and see how it measured up to other sushi joints. I'm happy to say their $6 sweet potato maki was full of goodness that pleased my tummy. The maki mono had the sweet potato pieces deep fried with a unagi sauce over the roll giving it just the right sweetness. Now I thought that was good, but when I tasted some of my beastly million ingredient roll, I knew I had found my sushi heaven. The Fire Dragon Maki for $14 is what I lovingly refer to as a white girl roll. It has everything terrible you can possibly put in a roll for one amazingly unhealthy but delicious taste. The Fire Dragon Maki is a deep-fried battered seaweed roll filled with salmon tempura, spicy tuna, cream cheese, avocado, sweet potato, scallion, spicy honey-mayo, and topped with wasabi & golden tobiko. I'm talking piles and pilesof tobiko! It added the perfect crunch to this packing a spicy punch roll.  People. I swear. I fell in love with that Fire Dragon Roll over the weekend.  I know you think I'm already a monster...but I swear to you I did not eat this all it one sitting! I swear it! I did however end my meal with a Taro Bubble Tea for $5.50 which was the perfect nightcap to my feast of fish.

I think their swirls are made of unagi sauce, spicy mayo, and regular mayo (if it's not cream cheese, or wasabi mayo...)  Average larger/fusion rolls range from $12-18, and your classics are typically $6-8. The ambience is definitely good for date night/girls night, although i wouldn't recommend a group of more than 4.  It's a little darker with hip music and a classy vibe.  You won't get your freebies here (like miso soup, veggies, or a ginger salad.)  It's BYOB. Come for some pretty rolls and drinks and robata bites. They have ramen on the menu too.

I ordered the sake (salmon) nigiri and a spicy salmon roll. First off....the sashimi pieces were HUGE. Almost like....a salmon...steak.... Now, maybe I shouldn't complain because ""hey, you got more than usual,"" but the ratio was totally off, and I guess it's strange to have a huge chunk on top of a delicate little mound of rice. Second... Holy crumbs. That rice was CRAZY overseasoned. I can handle rice that isn't seasoned much, but this one had so much vinegar in it that it was almost inedible. I get nigiri because I love the delicate taste of the salmon. Despite the huge slab they gave me, the vinegar in the rice completely killed the flavor... :( The roll I got was messily put together and not visually appealing. Rather than spicy mayo, they had mayo and sriracha...which was very strange to me.

I asked the waitress whether they can do rolls without rice and add cucumber and she looked at me like I was speaking another language. I said forget it and ordered the large sashimi plate, seaweed salad, and miso soup. The soup and salad were pretty good, but you can't mess up those items. The sashimi plate looked amazing, super colorful. The quality of fish was horrible. The white fish which was supposed to be buttery and delicious was soggy and tasted like it was previously frozen. It was so disappointing. Also the fish were cut super thick, which isn't like traditional sashimi.  As a result, this morning I was so sick from the food. Maybe the rolls would have been a better choice. Skip this place and pay more for better sushi!!",0.9094,0.643,0.211,0.146,0.5766233766233766

It may not be the best but is sure a bang for your buck! Here are some personal favorites, tips & tricks- (1) Stay away from the Thai Food because their specialty is SUSHI, so stick to that-DUH (2) Makis to Order             a. Godzilla Maki  (personal favorite if you're not allergic to shrimp)             b. Spicy Tuna (Don't be fooled. It's not actually spicy)             c. Sunrise (WARNING: contains jalapeños) (3) Vegetarians can enjoy maki too!             a.  Avocado maki  for a non-fishy sushi experience.               b. Sweet Potato Maki (comes with a delicious sauce) (4) Take out/delivery has a deal if you order more than $10 you can get free crab Rangoon or egg rolls. Make sure to eat your sushi within 24-hours otherwise the rice become horribly dry.  (5) BYOB!!!!  SERVICE (4 Stars) The staff struggles with their English and tends to get a little impatient at times. Regardless, they get you your food in timely manner whether being dine-in, carry out, or delivery.  ATMOSPHERE (4 stars) On the weekends, Butterfly Sushi is rather lively. During the week there tends to be a small but constant flow of customers. Definitely a place for all types of demographics ACCESSIBILITY (4 Stars) There are multiple locations but the Grand Avenue one is the most customer friendly (...and the food tastes much better)",0.9926,0.753,0.197,0.05,0.5320693709582598

I love all types of seafood & it was a mix of shrimp, mussels & some mini scallops. Spicy! So be prepared to chug water ;) Also had Chicken Satay & Vietnamese spring rolls. We shared a mixture of their meat dishes & the Fire Dragon roll, which was delish! I frequent many sushi places in the city & I was not disappointed with the menu items we chose!! Service: This place gets crazy busy on Friday night at 7pm. We had a reservation for 3 people, but one of our members was running very late. The host clearly was seating other tables without their full party but since it was taking quite a bit of time for a table for 3, we opted to be seated at a table for 2. An hour later, when a table was clearing out next to us, I asked the host if we could put the two tables together since our last member was on her way. She said to tell her when she arrived. It was boggling since every other table in the restaurant clearly was being seated while waiting for other people to join them!  Would definitely visit again, but probably not on a crazy Friday!

My expectations weren't high to begin with, but the meal hit the spot. PLUS, it was super close to our place like less than a mile, and they deliver! Not many Thai places deliver to our place, so that's an extra star! Website was also very intuitive, good work. We only ordered Thai so i can't speak about the Japanese food.  We ordered: Red curry with chicken and pineapples - very saucy, just the way i like it Tom kar - excellent Pad thai w/ chicken - good Two more stars for awesome food. Ok, now this is where i give out an extra star for delivery b/c this place breezed the test. I usually ask for limes and hot sauce and 3/5 times, restaurants will charge me extra or forget something...or give me lemons instead. Not only did they get the order right, but they hooked me up w/ tons of lime wedges and hot sauce for free. Lastly, they delivered under the quoted time frame of an hour which gets them to 5 stars!

The service was on par, and at times above average, for what we have experienced in the neighborhood and the food was timely; the sushi came out rather fast, which was surprising. It was a cold night so I ordered Miso soup and Mussaman Curry with tofu to warm body and soul.  The Miso was on point and as expected.  The curry was amazing!  I judge the restaurant's quality by their ability to make good curry and Butterfly passed with flying colors.  The warm coconut milk curry was silky smooth and well balanced.  The flavors of cardamom, nutmeg and peanut burst as soon as it hits your tongue.  The first few spoonfuls were one of those moments where your eyes cross and roll back as you fall back into the chair; it was THAT good.  The vegetables and tofu were done well but there were a few cuts of onion that were still tough; almost like the layer closer to the skin that stays chewy when cooked. The price point was inexpensive considering the portion size - all three of us had plenty to bring home.  Miso $2, curry $9 and a grand total for the table was $56.

As a former waitress myself of over 5 years, I'm all for giving servers the benefit of the doubt when it comes to a busy Saturday night; but our experience went beyond just a busy weekend with a small staff.  Upon being seated, it took about ten minutes for us to be greeted by the waitress. When she finally did appear; there was no hello, no good evening... just ""What's your order?"" We gave our order, and simultaneously asked for the volume on the speaker directly over our head to be turned down (for the second time). She told us, ""no"", we asked to switch tables, and she left the table immediately. At this point the volume was so loud the vibrations from the speaker were now hitting the table and our booth. After a third try (this time with the hostess that we had to get up to speak with), we successfully got them to turn the volume down. We ordered our food and the sushi rolls came out 15 minutes before our third guests entree came out. During this time, they hid the rolls under a water station to try to time the meal right. Big fail on that, particularly since I saw my food being stored on a shelf not far from us.  We finally ate (the rolls were pretty great!) and were rushed out of the restaurant so they could seat the next set of unfortunate souls coming in after us. When they dropped off the check, there was no thank you, no have a good night, just a check and a big fat frown.

I sit down and patiently wait for my order. Five minutes after waiting the Host comes over and mentions that sadly they do not have my appetizer today, but here are other options and he goes on to name a few. I select a replacement appetizer and continue to wait. Five more minutes later he comes over and says ""There will be an up-charge as the replacement appetizer is more expensive."" I look at him and think to myself... Are you kidding me? I ponder and just tell him that I don't need an appetizer, hand him my credit card and ask him to refund it. So I continue to wait a bit flustered and he comes back 10 minutes later not with my food, but with my card stating ""I need to find a manager to cancel you order."" I had no words.

2015-04-22,1.0,"I am a Butterfly veteran. Been a customer for about 11 years now! The food is really well priced and always tasty. But from a green standpoint, it's about time for Butterfly to be a bit more responsible with their waste!  Positives: All of their eat-in dishes are served on washable dish ware with glasses and silverware.  Negatives: Butterfly is a very successful company, with a lot of take-out orders, but their take-out protocol is quite wasteful. Every dish is either served in a rice box, styrofoam, or those thick, plastic tupperware containers. And with every to-go order the paper bag that all of these containers are held within are paired with plastic silverware, plastic soy sauce packets, napkins, chopsticks and maybe some small plastic containers with chili sauce. Basically, every time I order take-out from butterfly, I throw about half of the 'extras' straight into the trash, and have a pile of things to recycle.    It is understood that Butterfly's price point may be altered if they switch to responsible containers and sustainable materials, but there are a lot of more comparably-priced and affordable options out there now. Please look into switching to eco-friendly options for your to-go containers, and perhaps think about washable chopsticks and cloth napkins for the customers who eat-in.  It would also help to ask what sorts of 'extras' a person needs with their to-go order, because most often they are just thrown away, which can save your company costs as well!

We showed up to Butterfly, which was lively and bustling, on a Saturday evening with a party of 8 for a birthday party.  As we begin ordering it becomes clear we've got a myriad of fussy food related restrictions - someone eats nothing from the sea, others eat no shellfish, several eat no meat, two refuse to eat anything which is raw, and one is gluten free.  With this wide variety of restrictions (don't get me started on that topic, but let's just say some people should not got out to eat in restaurant) Butterfly was able to accommodate everyone. In fact I'll give props to our waitress who handled this high maintenance order without missing a beat.  The birthday girl, who wanted Sushi for her birthday, was satisfied and her Hubby, who eats no fish, was also happy with his bowl of Red Curry Chicken.  Had this been just a Sushi restaurant we would not have gone there.  Had it been just a Thai restaurant we would not have gone there.  Everyone was a winner with the Sushi/Thai hybrid. The food at Butterfly is good, and for a neighborhood place exactly at the level I'd expect.  Not the best Sushi or Thai I've ever had, but by no means was it bad.  They executed everything well, but there was nothing unique or special.  If I'm in the neighborhood I'll be happy to dine here again.",0.9818,0.8,0.14,0.059,0.5698583447802198

Such was the case with the Red Dragon roll. The first few pieces were good, but after eating 4 I felt full and the taste seemed to get bland. The spicy tuna roll was better than most places, but I couldn't finish it either. Maybe because I was so cold. They were definitely keeping the heat low, and as more people walked in so did the -10 degree wind chill!

We also shared some salmon avocado rolls, sweet potato rolls, and tekka maki (tuna) rolls. Good stuff! The seating area felt a bit cramped, but no other complaints.

The atmosphere was great we got sat in the back of the restaurant where they nicely accommodated all of us so we weren't disturbing anyone and we could be our loud usual selves. They even provided us with ice buckets for our wine bottles and beers.  Since looking at the menu online I had a taste for their Spicy Crazy noodles (Wide rice noodles stir fried with onion, egg plant, basil leaves, string bean and hot peppers in brown sauce) so I ordered some for everyone to share. Yum! They were so good and hit that noodle spot for me.  As far as sushi goes, we ordered quite the variety and everyone shared. My favorites had to be the Butterfly (Shrimp tempura, cream cheese, cucumber, unagi, masago, tempura crumbs with eel sauce) and the Godzilla Maki (Shrimp tempura, spicy mayo, scallion, tobiko, cream cheese, avocado, cucumber, tempura crumbs topped with eel sauce and wasabi mayo). We also ordered some edamame across the table.  Nobody was planning on ordering dessert but the staff decided to bring out some complimentary cheesecake pieces for us all! Why thanks Butterfly Sushi! For drinks, it seemed like everyone brought either beer or wine, so we were all feeling pretty good at the end of the night. Again, you can't go wrong with BYOB. If you're looking for a fun dinner or even a romantic dinner date I'd give Butterfly Sushi a try. If I'm in the area, I know where I'll be eating.",0.9939,0.818,0.176,0.006,0.6499999999999999

However, after my experience, I can't help but think it's all style and no substance. I came in with a +1 and we were seated immediately. Right off the bat, the service was slow. They took a lot of time to take our order, come back with our food, and bring the check. It was a little busy, but it was a Monday night so I'm not buying the ""we were slammed"" excuse. Also, they squeeze a ton of people in here, so the party of 5 next to us was constantly shoving their asses in our faces and on our table to get out of their booth. If you're looking for a little private conversation with your date while eating, look elsewhere. In terms of the food, I was not blown away. We ordered a good amount of sushi: 2 California rolls, a philly roll, shrimp potstickers and a Godzilla roll. I would say the taste was about average, well under what I was expecting. At the end of the meal, the plastic on the credit card book was broken so I couldn't actually place my card in the book. This summarized the experience pretty well.

To get my Thai fix in the future I'll likely seek out a place where the owner actually has a regular presence in the restaurant.  The half assed apology and offer of a can of coke doesn't make up for the 30 min of my life I'll never get back.  Hire some people that at least pretend to give a shit.",0.2177,0.899,0.053,0.048,0.4412393162393162

It was too sweet and slightly mushy, a real bummer. The Tom Yum soup had plenty of good aromatic flavour and an abundance of chicken, but again the flavour was sweeter than I like.

Eric R. loves panang curry so he ordered sushi with beef panang.  His curry was so fragrant and flavorful that I was impressed with the Thai side of the place.  His has so many vegetables, basil leaves and kaffir lime leaves - so if you like curry, get it here! Carlie M., Brian M. and I ordered sushi.  I also got Japanese eggplant miso robata for $2.  That was nothing special - skip the robata.  Carlie M. also ordered a green salad which was so big and surprisingly good for what seemed basic on the menu - field greens, pears, avocado, cherry tomatoes, and sesame dressing. I ordered sushi in 2 rounds and was pleased with all of my offerings.  The prices are very reasonable per piece of nigiri and the cuts of the fish were...beyond generous.  Bigger than I have seen elsewhere, maybe ever? I got amaebi (with fried head accompaniment), hamachi (came as belly cut!), nama sake, saba, ika, tako, uni, and a summer roll.  I normally never order rolls but this had maguro, hamachi, avocado, jalapeno, cilantro, and chile oil.  It was very good!  Overall, the quality was great and I was very happy with everything I ate.  I did not see handrolls on the menu though. Our server started off flustered but got better - she refilled our hot water for hot tea constantly.  When we originally arrived for our reservations, we wanted to sit outside because the restaurant was so cold.  We ended up being seated inside under 2 powerful air vents, but our server kindly adjusted the temperature in the restaurant, and the rest of the time we were comfortable.

Sushi, not so much, but that's kid for you. As apps we ordered the baby egg rolls, Vietnamese rolls, and crab ragoons. All very good. Thai dishes we had catfish curry, bbq pork fried rice, beef and chicken pad thai. OMG CURRY WAS GOOOOD! I didn't eat the catfish or veggies in it, but the curry sauce was amaaaazeballs! Fried rice as my next fav (sooo good), followed by the pad thai. Pad thai was good, but not as good as I've had it at my other favorite thai place. Sushi... we had so many rolls I don't remember the names. I think we ordered the Godzilla and Volcano for sure. The tempura shrimp on volcano was amazing but the roll itself was ok. Rolls were good.. but I mostly ate the thai food.  Service was great! Food came out fast! Accommodating our request for splitting a smoothie for the kids. Food was amazing.

DRINKS: Did I mention it's BYOB? SERVICE: In fairness, they were reasonably speed with our food and even brought out some ice buckets to cool our drinks.

2014-06-01,1.0,"Read Dennis S. review after mine, I think he is a pretty fair reviewer. Absolutely shocked at the 4 and 5 star reviews, just because it is Thai and Sushi doesn't mean it is exotic and delicious. Although years after my first experience, I have watched many people eat take out from here and can dismiss most of the high ratings to these types of people. No offense to those who may have never tasted real Thai food and offered up your top notch recommendation just to satisfy your indulgent nature to be heard.  Just and FYI regarding sushi, the rice should be the star, the rice should have a texture and flavor that lays the foundation for super fresh ingredients. The sushi at Butterfly is nothing like that. Flavorless overcooked rice with flavorless average fish. The proportions of ingredients have no thought, rhyme, nor reason. Just crap wrapped up like a drunkards dream burrito. The Pad Se Ewe was an absolute abomination. A dish when done properly has charred noodle edges, a sweet but biting sauce. This version which screams neglect was un- seasoned broccoli and snow pea pods (the pods still had the little strings on them which are fun yanking out of your mouth), the noodles were just boiled and stuck together, the sauce was corn syrup and water. The fried tofu tasted like it was fried on Monday, forgotten til Friday, left out til Saturday, and just placed as is in the dish.  I tasted some of my girls noodle dish, it had basil in it but it tasted like that black funk in the bottom of the lettuce bag, the rest of the dish was slightly more edible with a shout out to the dried up chicken like meat, well done ass hole cooks at Butterfly! I can not speak enough of how horrible and dangerous this place is. I can see as an ex kitchen guy all the shortcuts they take for efficiency.

I was totally craving sushi so I had my eyes set on Maki and Nigiri. Most of us ordered 2 Maki rolls and shared it with each other. Because of the number of us ordering Maki, we all got to try many of the different rolls. There was Black Dragon, Red Dragon, Godzilla, Ninja, Rainbow Roll, Boston Maki, Samurai and others...There wasn't one bad taste in the bunch. The presentation was beautiful and everything was fresh. The Samurai (Salmon tempura, avocado, spicy mayo. cucumber topped with seared salmon and special lingonberry sauce) and Butterfly (Shrimp tempura, cream cheese, cucumber, unagi, masago, tempura crumbs with eel sauce) were my favorites.  I did order some Nigiri (Super White and YellowTail) and wasn't that impressed with the presentation or the quality. The pieces were cut way too long and it was warmer than room temperature. Like it had been sitting out for too long. The fish was definitely fresh, I just don't think it was served the way good nigiri should be.  I did get to try the Spicy Crazy noodles courtesy of Osi V and it was very very good. So good I almost ordered one to go so I could have it for lunch the next day. I didn't, but I do know what I'd order next time if I'm in the mood for noodles.  As I mentioned earlier, service was great.Our server was very sweet and fun. It's BYOB and they provided ice buckets for our wine and beer. It seemed to take a while for our food to come out to us but I think because they prepared it so that ALL the dishes came out to our table at once...no late rolls or missing orders. And I don't know if we became their favorites (I mean, what's not to like about a group of gals enjoying a night out) but they gave our table a quartet of cheesecake pieces for dessert--all complimentary (and quite tasty!)

Food - Decent Thai. - Never quite understood the thai/japanese restaurant concept but decided to give it a shot.  - Funny how majority of the employees were Thai, but the Thai food was only okay but the sushi looked amazing.  - Ordered the red curry and spicy crazy noodles. The red curry was pretty good. The pineapples were a nice touch but a bit watery. As for the noodles, there was nothing really spicy about it.  For a Thai run Thai/Japanese restaurant,  the Thai food is weak compared to the Japanese food. Everyone around me seems to agree as rolls and rolls of maki stack up on every table.  Keep in mind there is limited seating space,  so avoid dinner time on weekends.

The presentation was beautiful on a nice long white plate, with fancy carrot and cucumber garnish in the corner. The sushi was AMAZING! I would highly recommend the spicy tuna roll. I was so impressed with the sushi, especially for such a reasonable price! The fish is fresh, and they use the perfect small amount of rice. I hate when other sushi restaurant use a lot of rice to compensate for the lack of fish. My boyfriend got the Mussamon curry and I got the green curry for my meal. We were both extremely pleased with the curries: it is the best we have had in the Chicago area. The green curry is wonderfully spicy with fresh basil, mushrooms, and red pepper!

I have ordered many different entrees from the menu and every time it was perfect, from the presentation of the entrée to the actual taste.  Some of my favorite sushi rolls are the fire dragon, butterfly, and the ninja maki.  Also the spicy tuna and the spicy scallop handrolls are to die for.  It's one of the best, if not the best, in the Chicagoland area.  The flavors in the handrolls were on point.  They also stuff the handroll with tons of fresh fish instead of rice like other places.  Definitely try this out if you are a fan of spicy tuna or spicy scallop.  Some of the Thai dishes with choice of meat I would recommend are the pad thai, pad see ewe, and the basil fried rice.  Did I mention the service here is excellent?  If not, it is!  The chefs here are bustling their butts off to put out food in a timely manner, the waitresses are going around making sure everything is ok and water glasses are full, and the bus boys are cleaning up dishes like nobody's business.  If you want a great dining experience, go now and make reservations for dinner.  You will get great food at a reasonable price and fantastic service.  To kick it up a notch, feel free to bring a bottle of your favorite wine.  It's BYOB with no corkage fee.",0.9984,0.714,0.258,0.028,0.5935582010582011

2013-09-09,4.0,"Butterfly sushi bar & Thai cuisine, I am a fan! We chose this location for a large party for one of my friend's birthdays and it was a true success. We specifically chose this location since it had the most and best reviews and I'm so glad we came here. It was the Sunday before labor day and we made a reservation for a party of 14. When we arrived our table was nicely isolated towards the back of the restaurant. It's so nice to be able to go downtown, eat out at a super yummy and inexpensive place and able to have wonderful conversations with your friends. That honestly, doesn't happen too often. The place has a modern decor with black leather booths and burgundy painted walls, so it's nice and sheek and not run down. It isn't gorgeous by any means, but it's not meant to be.  Now onto the food. I was so happy with it. The prices were so decent, like $8 for a large portion of chicken pad thai, $4 for some crab ragoons and the sushi rolls were also decent in prices. Back to the thai stuff, everything was delicious from those crab ragoons to our noodles, I just want to go back to have some more of it. The sushi rolls we got were all full of fish and not heavy on the rice, absolutely delicious. I mean what other place can you get $5 simple maki rolls such as salmon and avocado. The unagi roll was $6 but full of eel which is just the way I like it.  So overall, this place is wonderful for large parties since you can have that privacy towards the back of the restaurant. My only complaint is that it can get a little dark inside, so bringing someone older to the restaurant may not be the best idea. The service was great, everyone's food was brought out at the same time, which also doesn't always happen with such large parties. Oh and how can I forgot, they are byob!

I should have checked nearby places on Yelp. Oh, well. I went here with some friends on a Friday night and we got a table right away. The dining room was pretty busy but that didn't take a toll on the service or burden our waitress too much. The menu is fairly large, some rolls I had never even heard of and that really intrigued me.  I decided to go with a spider roll and a spicy tuna roll. No exploring tonight, just stick with what I know. It was fantastic. I wanted to save some for later on in the evening but I couldn't stop eating it. I highly recommend Butterfly to people from the area, as well as outside of it. It's BYOB and has a great menu.  One thing did happen to make my experience slightly off-putting. Our waitress had dropped some plates on my shoulder l, getting some food/sauce on my shirt. I wasn't too upset as I was stopping by home after we left the restaurant.

I'm not sure if it was my bodys reaction to accidentally eating chicken remnants or if it was food poisoning. I ordered the pad se ewe with tofu, the meal was brought to me with chicken not tofu. I expressed to the server that I am vegetarian and needed the meal to be made with tofu instead of chicken which is what I originally asked for. She took the plate back to the kitchen and moments later it arrived back at the table with tofu,..I believe that they did not remake the dish but simply scooped out chicken and threw some tofu on. Giving the restaurant the benefit of the doubt I ate the meal, which I soon regretted. Directly after eating here I got really sick and wasn't able to keep any food down for three days, I'm assuming this was food poisoning. Not only was the meal terrible but also was the service. When my friend and I tried to pay the bill we handed them my credit card and a 20$ which we asked for change and to put the total on the card, we ended up waiting for them to bring it back for something like 25 minutes and eventually had to go up to the counter and ask what was going on and if they could finish with the bill. 5 minutes later it was brought back to the table split between the card and cash, no change for the $20.

I honestly don't know what it is but once you have it you'll crave it over and over and over. They have that ""special sauce"" I guess! My first time coming here was almost 3 years ago and I've recommended it to my friends ever since. Plus they have 3 locations within minutes of each other so take your pick. I usually come to this one on Grand mainly because it's the first one I started coming to. The one on Madison is just as good but I just like my experience at Grand better. I've never been to the one on Chicago. I do wish the locations were more spread out though because I'm still out of their delivery range! If I wasn't... man, I might become an addict. The negative is that they can be pushy to turn the tables. They'll hover if you are taking too long to leave if they are waiting to seat other people. Or if you don't have a reservation (usually not needed) they'll seat you and ask how long you plan on staying if they have a reservation coming in the next hour or something. I understand wanting to serve as many customers as possible, but that's just plain rude if you ask me. So I tend to make a reservation just so I don't have to hear that lip. And frankly, you can just make the reservation on the way over or an hour before. The restaurant gets busy but not so bad that you can't get a table (I've never had a problem). The positive, besides the food being great and prices being reasonable, is that it's BYOB with no corkage fee! Anyway, this recent visit was just for takeout.

But it was good. I also order a miso soup this was very good something i would come back for.  Then last the crab rangoon this was delicious but alittle sloppy lots of wasted wonton.  It could be pocketed neatly picked most of the wasted fried parts off and tossed away.  The filling was spot on would recommend as a appetizer.   Overall it was a good thai cuisine and I would order from again.  Compared to Ruby of Siam which is my favorite thai restaurant.,0.9595,0.721,0.193,0.085,0.5278937728937729

Service We came in at an off-peak time and were the only two patrons in the entire place. Our waitress promptly took our food orders and while the food did come out quickly, she never once checked in on us the entire time to see how we were doing or if we needed our drinks refilled, etc. Given that we had the entire place to ourselves, there really was no excuse for the lack of service.  Food Had the spring rolls as an appetizer and they were some of the tastiest I've had. Bean sprouts, cucumber, scrambled eggs and tofu all topped with a tasty plum sauce and a slice of jalapeno pepper, I wish we had ordered more. Delicious and best $4 I've spent in a while. But... I'm glad we didn't order more because the entrees were HUGE. I ordered some basic chicken fried rice and it was a giant mound of delicious. Plenty of chicken in with the rice and green beans which I hadn't seen in fried rice before and the sauce was not salty at all - overall really tasty! I asked for them to make it a bit spicy too and the heat level was just perfect. The portion is definitely enough to make 2-3 meals out of it - hello leftovers. My cousin recently moved in the area and I could see us dining here again. The décor was cute with plenty of comfortable table-lined booth and for the food, the price was fairly inexpensive, but with the poor service when it was completely empty, I'm a bit skeptical as to how it will be when there are actually other patrons dining there.",0.8352,0.879,0.081,0.041,0.5989087301587301

The fact that it's BYOB saves you even more money on your night out. There are two other Butterfly locations just North on Chicago and South on Madison... take your pick, they're all great. I would have given them 5 stars, but everyone could improve somewhere. For Butterfly, I'd only wish that they hire a dedicated host or someone with more ""personality"" to greet and welcome people as they come in.

Generally, I think that most of the stuff you can order is totally run of the mill thai/chinese.  The different curries all taste pretty much alike, the chicken and tofu all come preprepared in the same vat making them pretty bland.  The noodles aren't that exciting.  The price is pretty reasonable since you get a good amount.  Especially the pad thai.  They just did away with the sesame chicken, which was my favorite entree.  Probably because it seemed like it was a little more involved to prepare. The sushi combinations are pretty good, but the fish itself isn't the best.  The sauces used can sometimes be overpowering and make your sushi a little goopy.  Some of the nigiri is done really well.  I love the unagi.   In sum, if you wanna get some delivery once in a while this place will do just fine.  If you're in the area, wouldn't hurt to stop in.  Just don't expect minds to be blown.",0.9883,0.772,0.207,0.021,0.6510262725779967

Let me start by saying the food was actually decent, I just wish I had time to enjoy it.  The service here is horrible, horrible enough for me to write this review and to never go there again.  I was going to let this go, but I feel if this restaurant receives enough bad reviews they will make a change, so that people start going there again.  My friend and I came in at 6PM without a reservation.  I have worked in the restaurant industry, so I understand walk in's as opposed to people that have made reservations.  The restaurant was empty, so we figured it wouldn't be a problem.  The hostess/waitress asked if we would be done by 8 (which is understandable has we did not have a reservation), and we agreed that time works.   Every second of our meal was rushed.  We did have 2 hours to eat, but apparently they want us to be a 30 minute table.  After we sat down the server got us a wine cooler for our wine.  Right when she returned with that, she asked if we were ready to order.  ""Well, we just sat down and took out the wine, there wasn't a whole lot of time to look at the menu, within that minute,"" I wanted to say, but I kept my composure.  Literally 3 minutes later she came back, luckily we had time to look over the appetizers before opening our wine.  We ordered that and began catching up while looking at the menu.  Before the appetizers hit the table she asked us for our order.  This wasn't much of a surprise, but we figured once we get in our main order the rushing would stop. Unfortunately that was not the case.  If we put our forks down, they were right there to ask if we were done.  If we stopped eating, even while holding our fork they would ask us if we wanted a box.  It actually got quite comical, because they were ruthless about getting us out of there.  It was probably only 7 o'clock and my friend was pouring some wine into her glass and as she was doing this another server came and took away our wine cooler.  Yes, there was still white wine in our bottle and no she didn't ask if we were done with it.  I guess there is an hour limit on the white buckets.  Anyhow, we were rushed through our decision for dessert and half of the items we asked for they claimed they didn't have.  I believe it was so we would leave, but it didn't work Butterfly I always have a sweet tooth.  After we got ice cream, they dropped the check without asking if we were done, we paid and we were out with 45 minutes to spare.   I think the servers we came in contact with were inconsiderate, not friendly and focused on turning tables rather than the guest's satisfaction.  It could be the management asking them to do whatever it takes to get the most tables, but in the end it does not help the servers with tips because the service was very much lacking.  Save yourself some time and don't go here!",0.8886,0.841,0.088,0.071,0.5017042606516292

The restaurant itself is really cute.  Small space, but the layout makes everything look spacious. I went on a nice, summery night.  They have sidewalk seating which is perfect for upcoming summer nights.  Service was rather quick and the pad see eiw was delicious.  I had some sushi as well and that was delicious!  The specialty maki is rather expensive like other competing sushi restaurants.   I went with a friend and enjoyed the food and the ambiance.  The restaurant got pretty busy towards the 8pm time frame, which is great for a Wednesday night!   I can't complain about my dining experience here.  Food was delicious.  Service was great. hooray.",0.9971,0.615,0.385,0.0,0.7343574635241301

I always get the same thing when I order: spicy tuna maki, spicy shrimp maki & summer (tuna, yellowtail, cilantro, avocado, jalapeno, chili oil) so it was easy for me to notice that the portions have gotten smaller each time I ordered. They raised the price on the tuna & shrimp $1 per roll. So... more expensive and less food? I don't think so! I'm not sure I would have received the same rolls had I dined in. I would have given it 2 stars, but the rolls were still delish (although they arrived slightly warm & I was still hungry after 3 rolls & I'm usually stuffed) & I got free crab rangoon which made me full after all.

Khao Soi Noodles- one of the only places I've found that even serves this dish,the soft egg noodles and the curry are delicious.  Only complaint is they put the crispy noodles in the dish instead of separately, so they are not as crispy by the time they get to me.   Spicy Crazy noodle:  legitimately spicy when I had it.  Fairly typical but tasty. Panang Curry:  also typical, but very solid. Best sushi is the Summer Maki- tuna, yellowtail, jalapeno, avocado, cilantro, chili oil.  For only $7 it's a big roll and has a lot of fish in it.  I'll admit that I have to take out 1/2 the jalapenos so that I can eat it without downing a gallon of milk.   Their cheaper rolls, like the kappa maki or sake maki have been disappointing if only because they are so small.

2011-12-29,3.0,"I've been here twice, and both times I absolutely loved the freshness and the quality of the sushi. And the fact that it is BYOB, REALLY helps this place out.  The first time I was here was for my birthday last February - I had made reservations for 11-12 people on a Sat night about two weeks in advance. When we got there on time, the entire restaurant was packed to the max, which is obviously expected for a Saturday night. However, we waited for almost 30 minutes before they were able to clear a table out for us - NOT a good start. We were very uncomfortable because there was 11 of us waiting by the door to be seated. It was freezing outside, and there was no room to go anywhere but by the door that kept opening and closing. Everyone was trying to push and shove their way in and out. The rest of the night was good - but maybe because it was kind of a blur.  My second time happened to be this week for my friend's birthday. Again, really packed and in the middle of the week. That does tell me that this place is very popular because they are always busy. However, this time around, our waitress was rude. We had a table at the end of the room, and we were still waiting for some of our friends to walk in, when she just started moving a small table away from us and removing unused dishes and chopsticks without bothering to ask us if we still need it. She separated another table for people to sit at, but no one sat there the rest of the night. The one thing that went well was paying the bill. Everyone wanted to pay separately, though they don't do separate checks, she did divide the bill with lines of whatever each couple ordered so it was easy for us to calculate our total. We wrote our names on the back of the receipt with how much much each person was paying, and everything ended up running very smoothly.  Anyway, I really want to give this at least 4 stars, but both times I've been here, the service just brings it down to three.

2011-11-29,3.0,"With the high star-rating from several hundred people, I figured this was a great place to hit up for a late lunch on Black Friday after I realized I'd missed the lunch seating at Kai Sushi. We turned up around 3:00 to a restaurant devoid of any other patrons and an abundance of staff, which was to be expected at that time of day. We were seated just inside the front door, which initially concerned me for any wind coming through the front door, but as it was slow I figured it would only be a mild inconvenience. The front door did indeed open, many, many times; it was mostly for kitchen deliveries. The back of my chair got whacked twice by a guy wheeling in a dolly of onions. He came in the front door, pushed the dolly through the front of the restaurant and then into a door behind where my friend was sitting and then it sounded like down a set of stairs.  The music was SUPER-loud Japanese pop...but not so loud as to drown out the music from the kitchen.  If all that noise and activity weren't enough, there were, at any given time, seven servers (a little sheepish to say I counted) standing around the sushi bar yelling at each other over the music. It looked like some friends had stopped by and they were greeted and everyone congregated around the sushi bar, which is at the front of the restaurant, behind where we were seated. It was a lot of activity and noise in a very small space.  Add to this, it took about 10 minutes after we were seated for the server to come back to our table. Did I mention we were the only ones there? It took about 40 minutes for 13 pieces of sushi and a curry fried rice to come out. I couldn't figure out why. They did offer us miso soup on the house straight off, of which my friend happily partook. He really enjoyed his curried rice, and I thought it tasted very good, too. The sushi (nigiri) was fresh and soft but disconcertingly warm-ish. It's the quality of the food that gets this place a shrug from me rather than an eye roll.  In all, it wasn't a low-key, relaxing late lunch by any measure, although the food was good. I would go again if asked, but not likely on my own.",0.9877,0.852,0.112,0.036,0.5134795321637428

This restaurant is clean and trendy-looking.  Order ""to go"" if you live near the neighborhood.  This is our ultimate sushi place in the city.  We are sushi snobs, and we say GO HERE -- Go early because it gets super-crowded on Friday and Saturday evenings.  The service is friendly, attentive and okay.  Not sure what to oder?  Ask your server for a recommendation.  The vibe here is great!  It is loud, so I don't recommend this place for a first date (unless you don't mind talking loudly to each other).  We have tried most of their sushi rolls.  ALL are very delectable.  This is BYOB -- if you are wondering what kind of wine to pair up with your sushi, please check out my review for Toro Sushi (for wine recommendations to complement your sushi). RECOMMENDATIONS: Volcano shrimp maki; Godzilla maki; chicken satay.   We always enjoy the following sushi rolls, which are outstanding:  black dragon, fire dragon, hurricane, crunchy spicy tuna, sunrise and sunset.  If you are not into sushi, try one of their entrees, such as, the butterfly chicken breast stuffed with sesame seeds, spinach and crabmeat and served with peanut sauce.  If you enjoy good Thai food, try any of their pad-thai dishes or kick it up a notch with their spicy noodles panang.   Do I crave their sushi?  Would I go back again and again?  Is it worth my travel time?  Yes, yes and yes!",0.9969,0.764,0.222,0.014,0.602934240362812

A couple of my favorites have been the Sunset (with mango, avocado, salmon, honey mayo) and the Nin Ja Maki (white tuna, asparagus, crab, and avocado with caviar on top).

2011-07-31,4.0,"You remember when you were somewhere in the vicinity of 5 to 10 years old?  And remember how you felt when Mom, Dad or some other responsible adult said, ""Do you want to go to McDonald's?""  First a smile would take your face hostage, then your involuntary impression of a Mexican jumping bean kicked in, and then you would squeal like a newborn piglet as you wondered what the Happy Meal toy might be.  Remember that?  Yeah.  That's me whenever anyone says, ""Do you want to go to Butterfly?""  (It's more embarrassing than cute when you're in your 30s.) I've been to many sushi restaurants in Chicago because I can't get enough of the stuff.  It's a borderline addiction.  Without a doubt, Butterfly CONSISTENTLY delivers the best sushi (and more) in town.   So why didn't I give it 5 stars?  If I judge the food only, it deserves 5 stars.  However, one must take into account the restaurant ambiance, which earns 3 stars in my book.  I've been to the Butterflies on Chicago and Grand and both feature cool, black and orange décor.  When it's not busy (i.e. late afternoon), I love going there.  At night, not so much.  I'm simply not the type who enjoys sitting so close to adjacent tables that by the end of the meal, you feel like you just went on a first date with the people sitting next to you.   Here are a few other noteworthy ratings to round out this review: BABY EGG ROLLS - 4 STARS - Ideal size, not too filling, flaky-crunchy texture, never greasy. SPICY CRAZY NOODLE - 5 STARS - love it, love it, love it.  Word of caution: This dish contains green beans as well as super-hot green peppers.  Sadly, I mistook the latter for the former.  Holy Mother of God, the burning that ensued after I ate the latter was off the charts.  I'm not a wuss when it comes to hot food, but DAMN.  Seconds after I ate that hot pepper, my meal came to a screeching halt, my lips ignited, the inside of my mouth began melting, and I had to drink my weight in milk to put out the fire.  It was insane.  I still order the dish, but I'm exceptionally careful about eating the green ingredients.  NOODLE PANANG - 1 STAR - I made an important discovery when I ordered this dish: While I like raw coconut, I do not like it in Asian dishes.  At all.  I think it's an acquired taste and/or you have to love coconut so much that you want to marry it.   SPECIALTY ROLL: GODZILLA MAKI - 5 STARS - It's my favorite specialty roll, hands down.  All of the specialty rolls are delicious and beautiful, but this one is tantamount to the toy in the Happy Meal. YELLOWTAIL SASHIMI - 5 STARS - I adore yellowtail sashimi, and I have yet to find a restaurant in Chicago that does it better than Butterfly.  If you like sashimi, you won't be disappointed by the yellowtail.  It's delicious and gorgeous - I attached a pic to this post. HOME DELIVERY - 5 STARS - Two dollars!  That's the price of delivery!  That's it!  If you want to avoid a crowded restaurant for dinner, ask for delivery.  It's usually fast, and you can't beat the cost. ORDERING ONLINE - 1 STAR - Butterfly either needs a new website host or a new person to manage it because it has worked for me only once.  The ordering capability always seems to be down so if you want to save time, just call in your order.",0.998,0.787,0.182,0.031,0.5453261905642859

The earlier experience involved pad thai, pas see-ew and spicy tuna. The noodles werent stellar but the rolls were tasty enough to try again in person. This time around we started with the spicy tuna roll which was both delicious and beautifully aranged. My yakisoba noodles were less than expected, with a funky taste to the dry beef. The red curry with chicken was exceptional though and I will definitely make this order for delivery again to have at this dish a second time. Overall, Id say stay away from the noodle dishes, concentrate on the curries and sushi, and it should be a good time.

We ordered the Thai escargot and Tom Yum soup for beginners, and were pleased. The soups were large and packed with goodies, and the escargot was really weird/good - like nothing I'd expected. Sort of a spicy peanut/coconut sauce on the snails, served with bread for dipping. Definitely worth trying.  For dinner, we had a panang curry and the spicy crazy noodle (I got the wide noodle with chicken cuz I loves the wide noodles always). I didn't try my friend's curry, but I really liked the noodle dish. The green beans were snappy and crisp and flavorful, the eggplant also not soggy and cut into small pieces so easy to eat.  We didn't get a free dessert, but maybe that's cuz I didn't tell them it was my birthday. All in all though, we were really happy with the food, and the service was good too.

What brings down the star-rating is the fact that I have never, ever had a smooth sailing here.  From making the reservation, to paying the bill it is always a frustrating experience.   The time that really takes the cake is when I called a week ahead for an 8pm Friday reservation.  They confirmed with me, on the phone, that I was in fact going to the Grand location.  As this was the only one that I had been to up until that point, I said yes.   The problem began when we showed up for our reservation.  It was 7:45 pm and we stood in the doorway for close to 10 minutes before we were even helped.  Granted it was crowded - understandable on a Friday night for a small BYOB - but it was unorganized and chaotic.   FRUSTRATION #1: Once we were ""checking in"" we were told there was no reservation for us.   FRUSTRATION #2: Were treated like we were at the wrong restaurant.  ""Are you sure you weren't going to the Chicago location?"" NO.   Thankfully, we were told that they could squeeze us in. FRUSTRATION #3: We were told, by the person seating us, that we would have to sit down and eat in 45 min. - a bit unrealistic for a sushi place, but if they can make the food fast I supposed it was doable FRUSTRATION #4: We were greeted by the waitress with the same reminder FRUSTRATION #5:  Our waitress took 10 minutes to open our wine FRUSTRATION #6: She continued to hover over us waiting for our order.  While I have eaten here before, I didn't arrive with my order magically ready.   FRUSTRATION #7: Once we ordered the sushi - which I have had before and know to be amazing - it came out quickly and you could tell it was just rushed to be put together. It just wasn't as good as it could have been. FRUSTRATION #8: Our waitress over-checked on us.  Literally every 5 minutes to see how we were doing and if we wanted our bill. It was uncomfortable and beyond annoying.  We were already told about our 45 minute ""dining limit"" multiple times.  This was yet another not-so-subtle reminder.

So please order quickly if you are going to.""   Immediately turned off by the comment we refused to spend another dime. As we received our checks, the busser was already wiping down our table and ready to set it for the next guest ( it was only 7:40). This was the WORST SERVICE I HAVE EVER HAD.

When I go now, it's generally to pick up my lunch, and the gals in there know me and my coworkers and exactly what we get, and they're always so friendly.  The place is very reasonably priced and I think the quality of food is quite comparable to the price.  Crunchy spicy tuna roll = the bomb. Another serious plus is that they're BYOB and very accommodating to those customers that bring their own beer and wine - they provide glassware, ice buckets, the works. My only issue lies with their organizational skills when they're busy - there's nowhere for anyone to wait for take out orders, so they get in the way.  And the dine in service just isn't strong enough for as many people that they have on the clock.  Other than that, I love them.  Butterfly 4 lyfe.

2011-03-04,3.0,"After sampling the slim remains at a chili cook off at Sip (we arrived late), my boyfriend and I dipped over to Butterfly for a real bite.  This review is completely biased towards restaurants where - yes you are sitting on top of people.  I like it.  It completely satisfies the nosy neighbor in me.  You get to see what other people are eating, listen to their pathetic or awesome existence all while sipping wine or beer you brought in.  If you enjoy palatial dining - I do not recommend Butterfly.   We didn't go on a weekend, keep that in mind, but it was pretty busy.  I would think weekends would be busier, therefore making room for more error.  The service plays mind games with you.  One minute they are attentive and the next twenty minutes they are m.i.a.   I don't like fried fish that doesn't come sandwiched and loaded with tarter sauce but Butterfly has okay fish cakes.  It came with a spicy sauce that could have been spicier if you ask me.  But overall they were good and not greasy.  We didn't eat any sushi, but we did order the Pad See Ew.  It was pretty good, typical Thai fare.  There was a Chad sitting next to us, who was taken back by the dish.  I suspect he doesn't eat Thai often.  This probably would of really bothered someone who hates close seating.  He didn't even have to lean or yell to ask us about our food.  I didn't mind though, he was on a first date and generally entertaining most of the night.  Yeah... I am that nosy.      Both dishes were large enough to share between two people.  At the end of your meal, they give you a piece of complimentary cheesecake.  My boyfriend was intent on eating it, and we ended up waiting about 10 minutes for it to get to our table.  It wasn't worth the wait, seeing as it was finished in two bites.   They turn tables over pretty quickly.  After the couple next to us left, it was cleared, cleaned and reset in a blink of an eye.   Over all, it was just okay nothing to go wild for.",0.9846,0.808,0.137,0.054,0.4621362433862433

When we walked in the tables were lined up way to close but i guess we are able to ignore ambiance for some good thai food. We are vegetarian and when it came time to order the waitress recommended the basil for me and the mix veg for my wife. She came back two minutes later saying that the sauces on those were pre-made and can we order sowmthing else. Well we ordered a noodle dish now and she came back saying they cant make that vegetarian either. (BTW All the ingredients listed on the dish are vegetarian but apparently all these dishes are premade with somekinda seafood sauce which is not listed on the ingredients. She finally came back that they can only make the cashew chicken vegetarian with tofu instead. 30 minutes after coming in we said fine just get us some food. To say the least the dish was completely horrible. The tofu tasted awful. Can;t believe that out of all(yes i mean all including the ones with all ingredients listed being veg) the entrees and the noodle dishes listed they don;t have one vegetarian option!!! Service was very slow but can look past that. We really wanted to like this place being as it is a block from out house but are sorely disappointed.

2011-02-13,4.0,"Butterfly is one of our favorite sushi restaurants... BUT... the experience is often enough to leave you laughing your ass off. This is one of those places where you could assign 1/5* to one category and 5/5* to another.  You just have to know what you're in for before you go the first time. Here would be my breakdown: Price: 5* Food: 5* Ambiance: 1* Service: 2* It starts with the reservation (you want to have one, by the way). When we made a reservation for 8 PM, we were notified up-front that we would have to be done by 9:30 PM.  Whereas most restaurants imply you shouldn't linger, Butterfly comes out and says it bluntly.  My wife once tried to argue with them about this on the phone but that was pretty much a waste of time. The tables at this location are ridiculously close to one another.  Expect to nearly be on top of the table next to you.  You do NOT want to be seated near the door (especially on a cold day) but often times, there are also people waiting to be seated standing near the door. Service is usually a MISS on the hit or miss scale.  Last night, for example, we waited at least 15 minutes to be greeted at our table. Additionally, in a move only to be expected at Butterfly, we were asked shortly thereafter to move tables because they had a reservation of 4 coming and needed our table.  Learn to laugh it off and expect something like this only here. The food is outstanding.  The crunchy spicy tuna roll is one of my favorites.  If you're a curry fan and a fried rice fan, try the curry fried rice - outstanding. Pricing is ridiculously cheap and that makes up for all of the aforementioned problems.  We've gone there and left full having spent $38 + tip. Finally, the place is BYOB (no corkage fee) which makes it even more reasonable in the grand scheme of things.",0.9779,0.809,0.128,0.063,0.5274193548387097

From what I heard, the vegetarian rolls were great with a good amount of seaweed, and a great value for $4.  I had the Sunset (mango, avocado, salmon, honey mayo) which was really different from any other roll I've had. Would have been better if the mango was in season.  The Nin Ja Maki had white tuna, asparagus, crab, and avocado with caviar on top and was my favorite.  The presentation of the sushi is so beautiful with designs on the plates and hibiscus flowers.

After all, great friends deserve great food. Sappy part over and done with.  I am about 95% positive that they didn't charge us a dime for the task of opening our champagne. You know how some places make you fork over 10 bucks for the privilege? Butterfly, apparently, did not (unless I'm vastly mistaken in my math skillz). Points for the Butterfly. So with champagne fizzing in our bellies, we chose Spicy Crazy Noodles, a Godzilla Roll and a Volcano Roll. Spicy Crazy was yummy, if not insanely spicy (but my standards on spice are insanely high so let's not fault them). The Godzilla Roll was the star of our evening. And as the priciest roll on the menu, still pretty darn cheap for something so magnificent. Volcano was good, three (not two, Nina) shrimp on top of each piece. The sauce that the shrimp had been covered in was tasty and unique and the fresh jalepenos in the sushi itself added a spicy kick I appreciated. But it wasn't as delightful as the Godzilla. Nothing wrong, nothing lacking, just not quite as special.  And yes, they were more than generous with the wasabi and ginger. I thin we even had a little unused wasabi left over (I know! Insanity!). The service was excellent. Unobtrusive but attentive. The intimacy we felt with our neighbors meant that certain aspects of our conversation had to be whispered, but otherwise did not detract from the meal. Oh and the complimentary sliver of cheesecake?

2010-12-06,4.0,"Yeah, it's all coming back to me now... now I remember why I loved dining at Butterfly several years back... back before it became impossibly crowded on weekends... back before you had to sit elbow to elbow with the table next to you... back before you could actually have a conversation with the person across the table.  There are several Thai/Sushi joints in Chicago, but none does the combination of Thai and Sushi as well as Butterfly.  The various dragon rolls are always solid... the godzilla rolls are always, well... godzilla-ish, although they seem to have gotten a little smaller (or my stomach capacity has gotten a little larger)... and the various other sushi pieces and rolls always taste fresh.  But the appeal for me is the pad thai.  There's nothing quite like having a nice entree of pad thai supplemented with various rolls.  The pad thai sauce they use has a wonderful vinegary spicy and sweet kick to it.  I always order it extra spicy and it never disappoints.  The pad kee mao here also has a nice kick to it, especially if you order it extra spicy... I've tried quite a few different Thai dishes here over the years, but nothing stands out like the pad thai and pad kee mao... The service is attentive, but slow when it's busy. Servers are almost always polite and friendly.  Tables in the back of the restaurant (near the restrooms) have an extremely narrow opening as a hallway, and anyone sitting in the aisle is bound to get bumped almost EVERY time someone walks by to go to the washroom... if only the space were a couple feet wider it would've made all the difference in the world... oh well... Make a reservation if you want to have dinner here (original location) on the weekends.  The outdoor seating is nice in the summer, but for some reason I just don't like eating my meals while sitting that close to parked cars... The byob is a great perk, but I'd still come here for the food even if it weren't byob.  Keep a little room in your stomach at the end of the meal, because they usually bring out a little free cheesecake or some other munchies for you with your check.

We parked (free street parking just west of the place) and walked in.  The hostess asked us if we had a reservation.

2010-08-26,3.0,"""Ay ay ay, I am your butterfly..."" Ugh, now that Die Antwoord song is in my head and will never leave. Our trip to Butterfly last week wasn't planned, but it was delicious. The indoor seating is so-so. We ended up on a big bench seat (with tables all in a row). The tables are so close together that I practically put my butt on someone's plate when I was trying to sit down. On the way out, I knocked over a stack of place settings because I couldn't fit. I'm a small woman, so I can't imagine a dude trying to sit down on that bench. Impossible. The atmosphere is nice though, and they have a small sidewalk patio too. We started with the seaweed salad (always one of my faves!) and miso soup (standard miso). I think four specialty maki between four people was a good amount with the salad and soup... and then we ordered one more roll and it put me over my stomach's fill-line.  My favorites were the summer roll (only $7 but FULL of salmon, tuna and yellowtail with chili oil and cilantro... I could eat that all day every day) and the Godzilla Roll (junk food sushi with shrimp tempura, spicy mayo, scallion, tobiko, cream cheese, avocado, cucumber, tempura crumbs topped with eel sauce and wasabi mayo).  The Ninja Roll was tasty but very saucy (snow crab meat, asparagus, avocado, seared super white tuna, wasabi and black tobiko, scallions and spicy-honey mayo), and the Sunset Roll (tempura shrimp, salmon and mango) was pretty boring but I enjoyed it nonetheless. I liked the Crunchy Spicy Tuna too, but the crunch was minimal and the tuna filling was a little mushier than usual.  The restaurant also serves Thai food, but we didn't venture into that side of the menu. Instead, we stuffed ourselves with sushi and enjoyed a cheap bottle of wine. It's BYOB, so you could have your own sake or Japanese beer... or like, The Little Penguin Pinot Noir, which is what we had. I wouldn't recommend it as a good pairing for sushi, but it's what we had. Solid sushi + BYOB = Success, right?... so, why only three stars? Here's why: I can't stand crabby servers. The ones that make you feel as if it's a horrible burden to bring you an extra place setting because they forgot one (chopsticks are so heavy!). And who clearly make a face when you ask to order another sushi roll because you're still hungry. And who let you sign your credit card slip, take it away and then flatly ask you to leave the table because there is a reservation waiting. Excuse me, ma'am, but I'm still drinking my full glass of wine at a reasonable speed... and please give me that pen back so I can subtract from your tip.",0.9936,0.827,0.132,0.042,0.495299823633157

2010-08-04,3.0,"I was pretty excited to give this place a try based on the stellar reviews but I was slightly underwhelmed. A friend (you know the one) and I had dinner here Monday evening. We had originally intended on sitting outside but the weather looked to be ominous so we sat inside instead, which was fine, as neither of were crazy about the outdoor seating. We were able to score a parking spot right in front, so that set a good tone for the rest of the evening. I was immediately struck by the decor, or rather, lack thereof. It just seemed rather blah and wasn't what I was expecting. We got our menus and picked out some appetizers to share as we decided on the rest of our meal. Our server seemed annoyed that we didn't place our entire order at once. I could understand this if the restaurant was busy, but it was pretty empty while we were there and thus no urgency to turn our table. We started with chicken satay, baby egg rolls and goma-ae. When they said baby egg rolls, they weren't exaggerating - these things were tiny. They were good though, as were the rest of our appetizers. My friend ordered Tom Yum soup and seaweed salad and I ordered a Boston maki and garlic chicken, medium spicy. The soup was very hearty and a generous portion and my friend enjoyed it. I tried the seaweed salad and the flavor was good, but I prefer goma-ae if I'm going to eat greens in a Japanese or Thai restaurant. The garlic chicken was good, but not at all spicy as I requested (spicy is nice-y) and had way too much baby corn for my liking. It's pretty hard to screw up a Boston maki (tuna/avocado) but the roll was warm and the tuna was rather mushy and bland, but nothing that a little wasabi and soy sauce couldn't fix. The service was good, if a little agressive. Our server had just put our check down and not 45 seconds later came by and opened the book to see if we had put any money in it yet. Again, we hadn't even been sitting there much more than an hour and there were plenty of open tables so I didn't understand the need to rush us.

Its dim orange lighting and tables that are extremely close to each other makes it look more fancy than your typical neighborhood sushi and Thai place, but yet it is still casual. It's BYOB and almost every table has a bottle of wine or two with them. Each time I come here, this place seems like it's rockin' with people here for a casually good time. Their Thai food is pretty good. I've tried their noodles and curry dishes and liked them alot. Their beef salad (Nam Tok) is also very delicious with the right ratios of lime juice, fish sauce, and chilli. However, they don't have Lad Nar noodles. Which Thai restaurant does not have Lad Nar? Please put Lad Nar on your noodle menu! Their sushi rolls are huge and very well plated. We also ordered sashimi and while the quality of the sashimi wasn't of premium quality, it is good and reflective of their pricing. I'm a firm believe in this: if I want premium sashimi, I will pay premium prices and go to Meiji, Japonais, etc. If on a low key night I just feel like having casual dining, I will head to a place like Butterfly. It's just a matter of comparison between ""premium"" and ""good"". While I think a reservation is not necessary, it's useful seeing that it's always so crowded.

I wouldn't suggest it for a date (well, at least not an ""early"" date-where you're trying to get to know each other better) since it is a pretty tight space, the tables are very close together, and it can get a little noisy. But, the food is outstanding (both the sushi & the Thai), the decor is adorable, and it is by far the least money I have ever spent at dinner. Try a table of six girls (half of us are italian) with our 6 bottles of wine balanced precariously on the edges of the table, since it was positvely HEAPED with food. We tried a assortment of sushi rolls and nigri (order the Super White-and you're welcome) a few different thai dishes and at least 4 appetizers-and we only ended up forking over around $15/ea. There were enough leftovers to serve an italian family of four (hey-we likes to eat!).  Butterfly is BYOB, which certainly cuts down on the price, and there is no corkage fee. The Godzilla roll is phenomenal, but good luck getting that puppy in your mouth. Be sure to make a reservation, since Butterfly is always jam-packed, and for very, very good reason. The servers and the hostess are always polite and very attentive.

The super flat and wide noodles had a nice rice flavor and tasted really fresh.  The tofu had a wonderful consistency and the basil and broccoli were tasty.  For sushi, I tried the avocado roll and the sweet potato tempura roll.  The avocado was just how I like it - fresh, soft and flavorful. The sweet potato roll was amazing and is something I'll have to get each and every time. The restaurant itself has a nice atmosphere but it is tiny and cramped. There wasn't an area to wait in without being in the way which on a cold and snowy night wasn't ideal.  The tables are very close to eachother and everyone seemed like they were screaming to be heard by their companions.  So it was loud and squished but still very fun.   All in all, it is my favorite sushi place in the city right now and i'll be back - but probably at off-peak times (if they exist!).",0.9978,0.715,0.263,0.021,0.6541630591630593

I'm sorry but I simply find that rude. I know this is the trend for BYOB sushi places but it simply is no way to treat customers who are supporting your business. The atmosphere here is also horrible. It's loud, crowded, and cold. I also felt as though the wait staff was just waiting for me to leave as soon as I got there.  The sushi is nothing special either, and honestly I would rather pay the extra eight dollars and buy a drink then have dinner here ever again. You dine out not just for food but for the experience and atmosphere and there are too many great Japanese restaurants in this city to put up with this kind of crap. I want to be fair so although i sound very negative I did give them the second star bc their sushi was not bad, but it wasn't great either.  So there.",0.6766,0.713,0.149,0.138,0.5745436507936508

2010-01-14,3.0,"Let me start off by saying this, I am no aficionado on Sushi. I have only been to maybe 10 sushi joints in my life. Not that I don't love Sushi, (I do, I really really do), its just that until recently I wasn't able to get my boyfriend to eat sushi. Now that he really likes it, I will be visiting more and more sushi places. Ok...with that said, I am rating butterfly sushi based on the sushi I have had at the handful of sushi restaurants I have been to.  I have dined in at butterfly sushi about 5 times. Each time has been a different experience, not very consistent. The first time I went to Butterfly Sushi was with my boyfriend (this was the first time I was able to get him to a sushi rest, so I couldn't get him to try anything to interesting). We were seated pretty quickly considering we didn't have reservations and the place was packed. We brought beer and were given a bucket of ice after we were seated. OK, not so bad.  We ordered edamame, Godzilla Maki, Butterfly Maki and the spicy salmon roll. I enjoyed all of the rolls, they were all different in texture and flavor and tasted very fresh.  The second time we went we both ordered Pad Thai. I ordered Vegetable and my boyfriend ordered chicken. I was pleasantly surprised. Both of our Pad Thai's were great, was it the best I have ever had? No. Was it the best Pad Thai I have had in Chicago, yes.  Now, why would I give this place three stars? It all stems from two incidents on separate occasions.  Incident 1: We went in one night to have a late meal (about 45 minutes before closing) and were seated very close to the door. That's fine, I understand they were still at capacity 45 minutes before closing. This is when a server came past me with a giant bag of garbage, I looked at him like what the heck? Then it came, the guy with the garbage opened the back door and all I could smell was garbage..HOT GARBAGE. It smelled like New York City in the dead of summer on a garbage strike! YUCK! I couldnt finish my food. The worst part was they kept opening the garbage door. Now, I don't know much about garbage but I know that it shouldn't smell that bad in the dead of winter, it smelled like it hadn't been taken out for weeks!  Incident 2: Despite my better judgement, a friend and I decided to have sushi here on a Friday night...and on top of going back after the garbage incident, we didn't make reservations! Bad idea. We went around 8pm and to our amazement we were seated within 5 minutes, I thought it was my lucky day. My luck ran out quickly after we were seated. We were told by our waitress that they had a large party coming in at 9:30 and would need our table. I hesitantly agreed. Did I mention that we received a table that was in a corner close to a window but somehow they managed to squeeze four people into the table next to us. All I could think was, how are these people going to eat, better yet how are they going to get their food? I would soon find out that they wait staff had no problem reaching over our heads and around our necks to collect plates. Not only was I annoyed, I was super grossed out. If I knew it was going to be this way I would have waited for a different table. I didn't think I could get more annoyed, boy was I wrong. Around 8:30 (we had been sitting for about 30 minutes) a waiter came over to ask how much longer we were going to be, our food hadn't even arrived! WTF! We were told that the large party was coming soon so please hurry? So what did I do? I ate slower :) Eventually they came back and made us move to a different table. This table even worse than the last, it was next to the kitchen. Disaster. Good thing I drank a whole bottle of wine that night or things would have gotten real ugly.  Will I go back? Probably not to dine in, but maybe if I need a Pad Thai fix. That is until I find a place with the best Pad Thai in Chicago. I am taking suggestions :)",0.9953,0.794,0.14,0.067,0.520533276247562

When we got our check, they did indeed take 10% off of our total amount.  That was nice, but that meant $4 off our check, while we were still charged for the samurai roll, which was $14.  Outrageous.

2009-12-12,4.0,"I'm always a skeptic when restaurants try a multi-cuisine approach, but I think it might work at Butterfly and I wonder why it took so long to ""discover"".  This place is CHEAP!  Mostly $2 or $2.50 nigiri pieces, sub $10 Thai entrees, what's not to like?  (Though it's very likely this is made possible by being located in a not-so-nice part of town and the cheap rent and some empty/abandoned storefront space along W Grand). First impressions This place is quite happening on Fri nite, despite not being in a well-trafficked part of town.  What we thought was funny as soon as we walked in was that there were NINE people behind the sushi bar, NINE! I mean, I know it's a weekend, but for a place that probably seated 60 people, it was rather excessive - I've never seen sushi chefs so cramped and bumping elbows in my life, even at AYCE establishments.  (Sidenote: No Japanese sushi chefs here) That said, the sushi came out blazing fast, but that wasn't w/o negative consequence.  The decor was easy on the eyes and I'm a big fan of the high square sofa look.  I also noticed the pull-out seats looked rather comfy, though there were 2 variations of mismatching black chairs.  Another thing was that the place was cramped - from walking from the door past the sushi bar to getting seated, there was not an inch of space where it was easy to walk past (and we're not big people).  There was always someone or something in our way; I didn't like that...Butterfly definitely sacrificed some of the experience for super high density. The Food Did I mention it was cheap?  $2 nigiri!  The chicken katsu was only $9 too as it should be, much less than the exorbitant $14 or $16 lots of places in Chicago charge.  The chirashi and sushi combo sets were typical going rate, around $20 though, and compared to the nigiri, the rolls were definitely priced at a premium.  What we ordered: Tom yum soup - spicy, authentic, but huge chunks of chicken (good if you're hungry, not so aesthetically pleasing) Chicken pad see ewe - tasty, flat noodles were done right without being overcooked and mushy, but same complaint about the chicken applied here Black Dragon - shrimp tempura was nicely dominant and blended well with the unagi; black tobiko looked different and attractive Americano - I'm always a fan of lobster-based maki, but thought some of the tuna/white tuna was a bit frozen, making me question fish quality 1 pc white tuna, salmon, amaebi, scallop - My concerns of quality were put at ease (isolated event?), the nigiri slices were fresh and large, my scallop was delicious, and my amaebi was served with fried shrimp head (+!).  Good proportion of rice, though would have been nice to have wasabi already on rice The Service Overall, it was decent.  Warm welcome, steady water refills, and the free brownie with the ""Thanks"" message was a nice touch.  However, I felt like we were being herded out a little.  The blazing fast delivery is good if you are starving, but doesn't really let you enjoy the food and your company so much.  Also, before we sat down, it was almost demanded of us that we finish before a certain time, as a reservation was coming in - not so cool, either have us wait or seat us without prequalifications.  Also, as I mentioned the close proximity of the tables was a bit bothersome and made it  difficult to get in/out.  There is no space wasted here, and logistically it's set up purely to ensure max capacity and high turnover - not terrible, but something to think about if you're going on a date. Overall, my first Butterfly sushi experience was positive, like the food and the prices, but some ""restaurant"" qualities could be improved.",0.9967,0.79,0.146,0.064,0.5712934750434752

PHENOMENAL crab rangoon.  Like, I don't even usually LIKE crab rangoon.   Plus if your To Go order is over $10 - you can get either a free order of crab rangoon or a free order of eggrolls.  Their eggrolls are fine, but get the damn crab rangoon.  (The reason you get that deal is every takeout menu they have has that coupon attached to it, so when you order, just say you have the coupon.  They don't ask for it). My only complaint is this: I'm a tuna person when I get sushi.  LOVE me a boston roll.  (avocado and tuna).  Sometimes their tuna is a little weird.  Not every time, but sometimes.  But I'm the only one I know who's run into that problem there, so maybe it's just in my head. In their non-sushi world, the fried rice is good.  (Not traditional chinese fried rice, but still good).  Their curry escargot is delish.   NOTE: This joint is hoppin.  If you're going there to dine in, make a reso - maybe even the day before.  Like, Thurs-Sat you need one.",0.7861,0.825,0.102,0.074,0.5962184873949579
2009-10-23,3.0,"We have a dinner appointment at Butterfly next week with some old friends, so we decided to test out the restaurant for lunch today just in case we needed to veto. The room is long and narrow, and done in funky oranges and black.  It's stylish and comfy, though the chairs ride extremely low - not easy for me to get up from in my recovering state.  Anyway, they have two major branches of food: Thai and Sushi.  Apparently they do the Thai well, but we didn't try any today.  Instead, we just had fish.  Specifically: * Cucumber salad * Ama Ebi (Sweet raw shrimp) nigiri sushi * Nama Sake (Fresh salmon) nigiri sushi * Maguro (Tuna) sashimi * Toro (Tuna belly) sashimi (2) * Lobster Salad maki * Summer maki * Pineapple smoothie Firstly, the fish should have colder.  The worst part is we saw the nigiri sushi and sashimi sitting on the counter for about 5-10 minutes; finally we asked ""is that our food over there?"" and someone delivered it.  Hello?! Secondly, the sashimi order was confusing.  I got one piece of tuna from my one order, but I got *four* pieces of toro from my two orders.  At $7 each, I would have only ordered one had I known toro sashimi has two, not one, large pieces. Thirdly, the toro only had one bite that really tasted like toro.  At best, it seemed like chutoro, or even just ""better cut tuna.""  I didn't say anything (we were on a timeframe and things were already late), but it was disappointing to spend $14 on not-really-toro. In their favor, the rolls were both big, plentiful, and very tasty.  Probably the best part of the meal.  The cucumber salad was very simple but tasty as well, though I would have preferred more than one slice of jalapeno.  The two complimentary miso soups were decent but a little salty, even for miso soup.  The pineapple smoothie was okay but nothing special.  There was no complimentary dessert, fruit cup, or other closer. I had been expecting more, so I was disappointed.  But at least I know how better to order next week.  And it was decent enough; it could have been better, but that's the way it goes.",0.974,0.803,0.124,0.074,0.4805139895565428

2009-07-03,4.0,"Come for the Thai. Stay for the sushi. The food here is remarkably good and represents a significant value in taste/cost arbitrage; that is you get really excellent food for the price. Morning We started with the Thai escargot, larb neua (beef salad), and fried tofu. The larb was ok. The fried tofu was ok. The escargot was amazing. Butterfly executes a delightful take on a very French dish. The escargot is presented in a classic serving style, but instead of being drowned in butter the snails were swimming in a very delicious Thai red curry. The curry was so good and so plentiful that Erica and I found ourselves dipping whatever we could get our hands on into the sauce. Night For the main meal, we decided to go with sushi. For maki we went with the sweet potato, Godzilla, spider, and the sunrise. For nigiri, we had some tuna and yellowtail. (Unfortunately, they were out of Toro!) I know, I know... How on earth is the sweet potato roll sushi? I don't know, but I'll tell ya something, it was damn good; much better than I ever thought a French fry wrapped in rice and seaweed could ever taste. The Godzilla and sunrise rolls are a couple of their specialty rolls. They were presented well and both were above average. As for the nigiri, the fish was fresh.  The service was attentive. They were quick to bring a bucket and bottle opener for our wine. Our waitress checked in with us frequently. I noticed a review claiming the staff at Butterfly doesn't know what Thai food is. Bogus. On my walk to their bathroom, I noticed several staff members sharing a bowl of som-tum and having a conversation in Thai. Som-tum is the national dish of Thailand. I speak a little Thai, so I had a brief conversation with the staff (and they probably had a good laugh at my pronunciation!) These guys are the real deal Thai cooks. So they definitely know a thing or two about Thai food. But for sure, they do Americanize the dishes, as do most Thai restaurants. It seems us Americans need everything drenched in oil and salt to taste good. (They barely use oil in Thailand!)",0.996,0.801,0.177,0.022,0.4891141141141142

I don't know about the rest of you, but when I go out for sushi I want a menu with a lot of variety, big rolls and options that won't completely drain my bank account. Butterfly has all that and more. The atmosphere is cozy but modern and the staff is friendly (it's also BYOB which is great). My sushi always comes out of the kitchen quickly and is presented nicely. I love the clean white plates and the fact that they spend some time on the presentation, rather than just plopping a roll or two on a plate. Everything they serve is so fresh, and even the rice just tastes a little better than any other place I've tried.  The best thing about Butterfly is that you always feel like you're getting more than what you're paying for. You can tell that they put the same amount of effort into their $6.00 rolls as they do for the ""special"" rolls... and you won't leave feeling halfway full if you opt for something simpler. If you do decide to go big, I suggest the Rainbow roll or their Godzilla roll. You've probably had them before, but I promise you they are better at Butterfly! Even though I mostly go for the sushi, I've tried their Pad Thai and some other Thai dishes they serve, and those are wonderful as well. Another nice touch is the free cheesecake you get after every meal. Who can turn that down? We also get delivery from them once in a while with no problems. They do charge a $3.00 fee if you're out of their delivery area, but it's worth it in my opinion. The food always arrives within 30 minutes and tastes nice and fresh.

My apologies to anyone of Thai ancestry for this place claiming an association with Thai food.  Only the sauces they buy and put in the little plastic containers are remotely Thai.  Their chicken and cashews - few cashews, tough stringy chicken breaded like a McD's McNugget, then cooked until mushy.  Absolutely horrible.  Tasteless spring rolls.  The Pad See Eve had decent flat rice noodles, but in a greasy tasteless sauce with big paddles of beef jerky, not any kind of decent beef. Only the Japanese maguro sushi was nice, very flavorful.  The ikura had salmon eggs the mother salmon gave up willingly.  No taste, no saltiness, no nothing.  The worst was the ""crunchy"" spicy tuna maki.  Spicy-yes.  Tuna-barely.  Crunchy-not in the least.  How can there be no texture to a crunchy roll? Butterfly makes the effort to be modern - I ordered online at their website.  It would have been nice if the price the delivery lady insisted on charging me matched the total the online order said I would be paying.  I guess keeping their website prices up-to-date ranks right up there with using good ingredients. I received an email the next day asking me about how my food was, so I filled out the form telling them how bad it was.  A few days later I had a telephone message asking me to call to discuss my complaint.  I didn't - the last thing in the world I want is an offer for more of Butterfly's food.  Or to have someone lecture me on how little I know about Thai and Japanese food.  (My first visit to Thailand was over 20 years ago, to Japan almost 30 years ago, well before I was an executive of a Japanese bank.)",-0.4352,0.845,0.073,0.082,0.5167220376522702

It was a Sunday so I was the only person for awhile but it quick started to get busier. I sat at the bar and ordered Crab Rangoon (i know...not your typical sushi selection) and a Spicy Tuna Roll.  The Crab Rangoon came out quickly (not too quickly which would suggest the use of a microwave) with a complimentary bowl of Miso Soup. The miso was great. A little on the hot side but it cooled down with a little stirring  and I busied myself with my appetizer. The Crab Rangoon was noticeably good. As much as I love the stuff I don't really think about it. I just love the cream-cheesiness. The mix in these little fired goodies was really good. A little spice, maybe a touch of red pepper but overall it was a bit more interesting than you'd expect Crab Rangoon. I'm going to add a photo of the Spicy Tuna Roll  because the presentation was fantastic! Drops of spicy sauce on one end of a long sushi plate followed by a quarter of an avocado sliced up. The roll was beautiful with heaping amounts of spicy sauce mix on top with little garnishes. The ginger was fresh and not soggy and they press the Wasabi with a mold for another extra touch.  Look, this lunch was mind blowing but it was refreshing and really filling. The sushi chef even stopped to ask how it was and if the spice was good, not too spicy and so on.

But that night's udon?  Not so great. In fact, slightly disappointing.  Now, I'm not sure if the reason for that is that the tempura veggies and shrimp sat in a container for 20+ minutes while being delivered or if it would also have been a disappointment while dining in? What didn't I like about the Udon? Well, the veggies in the soup were all fried in a thick coating of tempura instead of being served fresh or lightly steamed.  My tempura consisted of 2 pieces of shrimp, broccoli, a piece of bell pepper, sweet potato, and onion.  All coated in batter and deep fried. The udon itself also lacked seasoning.

2009-04-04,4.0,"FOOD: Usually we are skeptical of any sushi place that is a pan-asian restaurant, but we were pleasantly surprised.  The fish is very fresh (sometimes you get sushi that tastes a little fishy.. at cheap sushi places) and they stick to fairly traditional rolls.  There are little differences here and there when they put  drop of sriracha on top of spicy mayo on the spicy rolls, which could be a good or bad thing depending how much you like sriracha.  Spider rolls here are huge- so big you may have to take two bites for one piece, but so yummy.  Next time we come we have to try the sashimi- that's the real test when it comes to these kind of places. SERVICE: Our waiter was so nice- almost abnormally nice.  We came in when it was still fairly early so they were very attentive to us and the sushi came out pretty quick.  When we got the bill, they also gave us a complimentary dessert!  I have no idea why, but it was very yummy and just a nice gesture that makes me want to come back for their friendliness. AMBIANCE: It's a really tight space, but still very chic nonetheless.  It reminded us of a London restaurant- posh but all the tables are so close, you're pretty much eating with the people next to you.  Even for the time we went, it was still fairly lively in there.  Because the back space was a lot darker than the front (just because there's big windows at the front) the ambiance does seem to change, though probably unintended, but it's a nice variation.",0.9972,0.724,0.24,0.036,0.5250661375661376

I was expecting a bill of twice what we paid, and wouldn't have had a problem paying it. Chuck in your best bottle and it's still a bargain. The sushi tastes like fish, rather than all the (deep-fried) extras that come in the special rolls In the black dragon you could taste the tobiko, and the shrimp and the avocado and the tempura. The eel was beautifully eel-y. The hurricane was especially good. I'd complain that the edamame was bland but what's a little salt between friends.  A fantastic evening.

It does get suupper busy on the weekend evenings so make a reservation. It's also a very small restaurant, long and narrow, so be forewarned it's not the place to go for a romantic dinner.

Sushi: I don't typically like to eat a lot of sushi.  Usually I prefer one roll as more of an appetizer than a whole meal.  That all changed once I tasted the Godzilla and Samurai rolls at Butterfly.  Holy crap those are good.  The presentation is impressive as well.   The only downside to Butterfly is the service and atmosphere.  At times, the service flat out sucks.  If you try to show up during dinner hours without a reservation they seem to have no idea how to handle the situation.  They often give you a time limit on your meal, which I find a bit rude but I assume there are cultural differences at play.    The dining area is also a bit cramped.  If you sit on the outside seat, you should expect to have your seat bumped several times throughout the meal.  You will also be forced to listen to the inevitably inane conversations of the tables next to you.  There is a payoff, however.  They often throw in a small dessert, usually cheesecake, on the house.   For me, the food is way too good to care about the mediocre service.  They also are super fast for carryout or delivery.    If you've had better Thai food in Chicago, I want to know where.",0.9795,0.838,0.124,0.039,0.4953431372549019

When I could actually fit the entire piece into my mouth, I ran into the problem of being able to move my jaw enough to be able to chew.

I appreciated having fresh fish when trying nigiri and sashimi for the first time. Some pieces were hits and some were not but it was fun getting to try new things. I never thought I would love Tako nigiri - it's freaking octopus! Yum!

I had no problem making a reservation for 9, and our table was all set to go when we arrived. The server was great about making room for a surprise guest #10, and about cleaning up the wine glass I broke several minutes later. I think everyone liked their food; we had a few sushi first-timers who were impressed and the people who got Thai were happy as well. My only food complaint, really, is the lack of interesting vegetarian sushi options -- they need a sweet potato or veggie tempura-style roll. Service was great -- the waitress was happy to bring ice buckets for our BYOB wine, our water glasses stayed filled, and the appetizers and entrees came out in good order. At the end of the meal, we even got a few slices of free cheesecake, even though we didn't mention anyone was having a birthday! They know how to treat you right here. I am very glad I switched the party location from Sushi-X, which has my favorite sushi roll but a too-trendy atmosphere and a restrictive reservation policy (basically they said our money wasn't good enough; they wanted a guarantee we'd spend $30 per person...

After a Seinfeldian delivery disappointment (we were just outside of their area), we decided on pickup. So all my food thoughts take the ""this would have been so much better in person"" thing into account. For instance, the edamame, which was a little firm overall, would have tasted better piping hot on the table. Same with our noodle dishes. They lose a little, either from being less-than-hot or getting that wilting jolt in the microwave.  That being said, still pretty darn tasty. Very flavorful miso. My Pad Thai's tofu was extra firm and plentiful. Lot of veggies in the dishes, and they didn't even scrimp on the shrimp in the Pad Woon Sen. Sauce levels were good. Spice was adequate, although they also sent along some chili sauce, which did come in handy.  OK, now for the Godzilla roll. Picture the biggest roll you've seen. Got it? Double it. That still might not do it justice (unless Godzilla *is* the biggest roll you've seen). It's almost cartoonishly large. Thing is, it's not just huge: it's huge and good.

The tables are so close together, that we were sitting at a table for 6, with a couple being added into our party.... so the seating arrangement is less than ideal, but they make the most of their small popular place. The food was fantastic!  We started out with edamame, which was a delightful treat, followed by multiple orders of the godzilla and summer.  The rolls are HUGE and they are not stingy on the amount of fish they put in the roll.  FRESH and DELICIOUS! We didn't order dessert because we stuffed ourselves on the rolls and sashimi, but when the waitress delivered our bill, she gave us tasty fortune cookies...no cheesecake.

No skimping on fish here!  My breakdown of some of the dishes I have tried ...As Crab Rangoons go, It was good...( I generally would not order crab rangoon because there are better appetizers to choose from, but since it was free I can comment) just typical fried wonton stuffed w/cream cheese. The Seafood Sunomono consists of crab meat, octopus, shrimp and some other seafood on top of seaweed salad, I thought it was worth the extra few bucks. The spider roll is killer because its so cheap! $7 for a whole fried soft shelled crab..yummmmy. All the rolls are really good-I do have a problem with Butterfly's spicy tuna roll. They used to give you a LOT of tuna...I'm talking an extra spoonful on top of each roll...maybe they've gotten too successful but they leave out that extra goodness. Also, the spicy tuna roll is made spicy w/siracha so it kind of overpowers everything else. Don't get me wrong..I LOVE siracha...just not on tuna.

The service was alright, not very attentive, but we were able to find our waitress the couple times we needed her and she brought us extra fortune cookies at the end, so it was fine.  We arrived a little after 6p on a Wednesday, and the hostess scoffed a tad when we said we didn't have reservations. Its a decent sized place, there was only 4 if us and there were only 2 other tables occupied at the time. Basically we thought she was nuts. By the time we left around 8:30, the place was bumping. No open tables in the place and they had us packed in so tightly, that people could not get past our table to the bathroom - a little annoying.

I complain about space this limited on an airplane...but at an American restaurant? Give me a break.  The food was good, but you could tell that they dumb it up a bit for the customers. I like my noodles spicy, and after ordering them ""extra spicy"" they still tasted rather boring to me. I asked a bus boy for some spicier sauce, and surprisingly he brought me some. It wasn't a traditional Asian-style pepper combo, but when mixed with my shrimp tempura the result tasted like an amazing Cajun/Thai fusion that should be further explored in the culinary arts!  The prices could honestly be better for the serving of Thai food, but the sushi seemed like a fair trade. Although I had a good meal and the service was sharp and attentive, I think that I'll stay away from this joint until they either remove some tables or buy out the vacant business next door and expand the dining floor.  Waiting hours for seating and eating on top of people can be miserable, but is occasionally excusable for a unique meal.

WTF!?!?  Yeah, that's right she added 20% tip in because there were now 6 people in our party!  Bullshit.  Butterfly Sushi 1, Turner_Brown 0.  We were so disgusted we paid the bill and left to never return.   Enough about my shitass experience let's talk about the food: Edamame: a little undercooked  Golden Wings: Eh...nothing special Crab Rangoon: Pretty good actually Sesame Chicken: Terrible, do NOT order this. Spider Roll: Eh...nothing special would not order again Summer Roll: Pretty good! Hurricane: Awesome, best thing about the place! Godzilla: Wow, this was stupid.  You get the impression this place likes to fry things.  This tasted like a big deep fried turd.  People who hate sushi but love fried anything will think this is fabulous. Overall the food was decent.  I have to agree with the other reviewer that said that this place pulls the focus from the freshness of sushi and deep fries the hell out of it or covers it in ""secret"" sauces.  So if you are a sushi newbie or you are trying to cater to a crowd of mixed palates this may be an option, just beware that you could be setting yourself up for a night of shitty service. In addition to the 20% tip I unwillingly left for Butterfly I would like to pass this pearl of wisdom on to them: If someone in a, relatively, small party has a dish that takes an inordinate amount of time to cook do NOT serve the rest of the party until ALL dishes are ready to be plated.  Or if you FORGOT the dish entirely, owe up to it.  Apologize and offer to comp it.  You lost 5+ customers Tuesday night because of these oversights.",0.9834,0.815,0.118,0.067,0.5256038647342997

My friend highly recommended it and I thought that it was just a bad night but then I read another review that had a similar experience. I feel obligated to warn future customers.  A person in my party (4 people) did not get their meal in a timely manner. And when I mean timely manner...I mean he got his meal 30 minutes AFTER we had finished ours. This is completely unacceptable. What was more unacceptable is how the restaurant handled the situation. We never once were apologized too or even offered an excuse after we had inquired about the dish twice. When our friend did get his dish, it was bland and did not resemble Thai cuisine. Since he had been waiting an hour and half for the meal he ate a portion of it because he was starving. But let me assure you...it was awful and if he hadn't been so hungry he would have just sent it away.  When we received our bill we were very surprised to see that the meal was still on the bill. Hey...I am a pretty laid back person. I understand mistakes are made. For what ever reason, my friend's dish was delivered extremely late. It happens. But when a restaurant makes a mistake, it's how they handle it that makes the difference. Unfortunately for Butterfly, they lost 4 customers because they handled this situation so poorly. When we asked for the meal to be comp'd the waitress was very agreeable even though she still hadn't apologized. Situation resolved...right? No. A few minutes passed and a manager/hostess came over and asked us why we wanted the meal comp'd. We explained the situation, very nicely, only for her to snap at us about it being eaten. We tried to tell her that it wasn't the dish that was the problem (even though it sucked) but that it was delivered so late. She didn't respond but walked away without letting us know if they were going to comp the meal or not. When we got the bill back, 15 minutes later, the meal had been comp'd BUT we were now charged 20% for gratuity!! This was absolutely the most ridiculous and tacky thing a restaurant has ever done! I couldn't believe my eyes. The restaurant makes a mistake...they refuse to acknowledge it...then charge us more? Again...ridiculous. In the end we paid the bill in full without further discussion or fight because we were just so dumbfounded and irritated.  Needless to say, I will never return to Butterfly.

2007-08-02,2.0,"I went here last night for sushi after a friend's recommendation, and then following up with additional research on yelp. We arrived at 7:30 and were told that without a reservation we would have to sit outside. That's fine by me, I just want to eat though the outside does lack ambiance. At first glance of the menu, I'm disappointed. The rolls are what I call the b*stardization of sushi. Cream cheese, crab stick, lots of cucumber, onions, everything is rolled in ""tempura crumbs,"" and covered in fusion sauces. We ordered the edamame, miso soup, crunchy spicy tuna, sunrise (cuz I love unagi), a godzilla roll, nama sake sushi, and hamachi sushi. The rolls were large...especially the godzilla which was literally the length and girth of my forearm. The nama sake (salmon) looked fresh, but the hamachi (yellow tail) came out a yellow-brownish color. Not good. The edamame wasn't salted, and probably could have used another half minute cooking. Both the spicy tuna and sunrise were overly spicy from being smothered in creams. I think they were trying to cover up the poor quality of the fish by focusing on the ""spicy"" aspect. And speaking of fish, there wasn't much in the roll. The most visible elements were the fillers...all I could see was a big square of green avocado and a sliver of brown where my unagi ought to have been. Kudos for not scrimping on the fish roe, which was fresh and good.  Overall, I thought the knife skills were weak, there wasn't a clean cut on our platter. The rolls were too dressed up to taste and enjoy the fish, which is the reason why I order sushi! The pieces were so large that it was awkward and messy getting them into our mouths.  The only redemption is that our service was prompt, our water glasses were always filled, and the price was right. Hence, I would say that we got a value in terms of ending a meal full without it breaking the bank...but I was full on tempura, sauces, and avocado.",0.8666,0.851,0.088,0.061,0.4421274961597543

Maki and nigiri were also top-notch.  At the last minute, someone at our table shouted out ""Godzilla maki"" and, in addition to our traditional, reasonably sized rolls, we received a board with a sliced roll the size of a loaf of bread which, with it's tempura-crumb topping and drizzles of eel sauce and spicy mayo, looked suspiciously like a coffee cake.  It was entirely tasty, but the Godzilla maki stomped us flat and we barely made a dent in it. We rallied, however, and ordered three out of four of the desserts on the menu-- lychees on ice, mango mochi ice cream and custard.  Lovely finishing touches, all three.  The coffee, I was told, was tasty, but alas, no free refills.

2007-05-21,3.0,"My friends and I met up at this nice little BYOB for dinner on a Saturday night.  I was first to arrive for our 7:30 reservation and it looked like the dinner rush was in full swing.  The wait staff was running around in a frenzy and it took a while for the hostess get to me.  She directed me (well... really just pointed at a general direction) to my table.  A couple seated next to us took the liberty of putting all their food on our table.  Not wanting to disturb the lovebirds' meal, I stood aside.  When the hostess noticed and asked them to move it back onto their own table, they were completely unapologetic and even copped an attitude - FYI, you ignoramuses: it's NOT okay for you to use other tables even if they were unoccupied at the time and it's NOT okay for you to respond with ""Are they going to use all those tables?"" My party arrived in short order.  The server hurriedly took our orders and disappeared.  The good thing is the food arrived quickly... however, I wasn't too crazy about how all our food arrived at the same time - appetizers and entrees.  The servers quickly set our food down and disappeared once again forgetting our multiple requests for things such as an ice bucket for our wine or extra place settings - channeling Milton from Office Space: ""Excuthe me... my thetting... my thetting.. pleathe... I can burn thith plathe down.""  The server also took our dessert orders only to never reappear with them.  Good thing the hostess came to the rescue. Dinner overall was pretty good... in fact very good.  The music was a bit loud though... I found myself yelling at the top of my lungs trying to talk to someone merely a foot away.  The food gets 4 stars, the somewhat absent minded staff gets 2 stars, and the setting itself a 3.5 (with the music turned down) but 2.5 since I couldn't hear myself think.  I'd go back... but definitely not during the dinner rush.  I guess as with many Asian restaurants, you come for the food and not for the service.

2007-05-10,4.0,"Hey all!!  Just got back home from Butterfly and I have to add my 2 cents.  Overall, this place rates really high on my list, and we will definitely be back for more sushi and to try the Thai portion of the menu.  We sat at the sushi bar, where we usually like to sit at sushi restaurants.  We like to watch the sushi chefs perform...the Hub and I took a sushi class and we know from experience how not easy it is to roll maki and make nigiri.  SOOO not easy!! We did go for sushi and had a whole bunch of sashimi and a few rolls.  We also had an appetizer of vietnamese rolls.  The rolls were awesome.  They were so fresh and the sauce was a nice little kick to the filling.  It was so tasty.  Our sashimi rocked...definitely at the top of the sushi venues for sashimi.  And it came to us like a piece of art, the several pieces of sashimi we ordered shaped into little florettes set in front of a background of shredded carrot, rutabaga and beet, with slices of lemon and kiwi framed on each side and a bit of seaweed in front of the flower bed.  It truly was art...camera phone couldn't capture and give it true justice.  However, it's the sashimi that makes this place one of the major reasons to go back, so far!!   As for maki, we got the red dragon, the crunchy spicy tuna and the summer rolls.  Both the Hub and I weren't crazy for the red dragon or the crunchy spicy tuna.  The red dragon included spicy shrimp and I wasn't digging the flavor.  The crunch spicy tuna was rolled in tempura crunch, but the crunch didn't...what's the point of crunch if it doesn't crunch?  Kinda reminded me of leftover tempura...it's just never the same the next day.  But the summer roll was really tasty.  The jalapeno-cilantro-chili oil mix was perfectly balanced to the tuna-yellowtail.  It didn't overpower and it was SOOOO fresh. FYI, this place is BYOB.  But if you choose not to bring your own, I recommend the thai iced coffee or thai iced tea.  Top off the dinner with some red bean ice cream and this meal overall was really awesome.  If that wasn't enough food, our server brought us a complimentary slice of mocha cheesecake.  I'm not really a cheesecake person, but my Hub had no problem appreciating the little token compliment. OK, atmosphere...I read one of the reviews that the decor was a bit sparse, and I have to agree.  They have this huge wall space across the whole room and it felt like something was missing.  They have lighting facing the wall as if to display something, but there's nothing there.  And the black and orange didn't really move me.  The Hub suggested that the colors represented the king monarch butterfly, which kind of made sense.  It was just missing the splashes of white.  It would be cool if there were large butterflies across the walls.  Just an idea of course.   There was trendy music playing just loud enough to carry a conversation without having to strain to hear someone talking.  And the sushi chefs rock!!  It might have been because they weren't so busy, but they kept asking us if we needed anything and asking if everything was all right.  And our server was all over everything, very sweet and very attentive.  Anyway, we definitely are looking forward to checking out the Thai portion of the menu on our next trip, although we might sneak in some more of that sashimi (can't get my mind off it...yum!!!).  Oh, if you are interested in seaweed salad, we'd recommend it.  Not because we tried it, but sitting at the bar, we saw it being made and served over 2 dozen times.  That's alot of seaweed salad...gotta be something to it.

Qualities you would not want in a person, to be sure, but in a restaurant, they were okay as Butterfly came through on service, quality and experience (my chair didn't even get bumped and I was in a high-traffic spot). It would have taken quite a bit to keep Butterfly from being a wonderfully pleasant experience.  So to go back and add the good--because this place is very good--it has a menu that's not overwhelming but still has plenty of options, the service for sushi was quick even though the joint was packed, and the server/hostess/busser/cashier was doing all the aforementioned jobs with a sweet attitude to spare. The slice of cheesecake on the house didn't hurt, either.  Make reservations for the weekends because the wait was 45 minutes for this go-round. The sushi was very good, tasted fresh, and the maki menu was a long as I've seen at other good sushi restaurants. And the price--knock a dollar or two off of whatever you pay at Oysy.

2007-02-28,5.0,"Butterfly is a great combination cuisine place that works. Sometimes you get restaurants that try to dabble in more than one type, at the expense of quality or variety. Fortunately, that's not the case here. The menu contains a reasonable amount of Japanese items (Teriyaki, Katsu, Yakisoba, Edamame), and most of the familiar Thai items (Pad Thai, Pad See-Ewe, Tom Yum, Panang). Of course any restaurant that serves Mussaman Curry is an insta-favorite of mine! The sashimi/sushi/maki-mono is delicious. The portions are reasonable for the price that you pay. I have had no problems with the service when I've eaten here for lunch or for dinner. Pickup service is reliable, though you may have some problems looking for nearby parking depending on the time of the day/week.

The food is still pretty good, but I won't dine in here again.  Take-out and delivery only for me... ____________________________________________________ I love Butterfly for take-out, delivery, and dine in.  Dine in is probably my least favorite because it tends to get pretty crowded in there, but I really like the byob aspect and the servers are incredibly sweet.

On Chinese: I don't generally like non-authentic Chinese food, but Butterfly's doesn't taste too Americanized, and I surprisingly enjoyed it.

Places like Butterfly just add to the stereotype and they don't focus on doing one thing superb.  This isn't a fusion place where they take two cuisines and merge them together like on the Iron Chef.  This is literally some Japanese and some Thai stuff.   So, I've gone on my little rant because I'm a disgruntled asian dude that needs to take a chill pill.  The food here is good for both cuisines...not great...by far not great...just solid.   I probably hit this place once a month with my wife, who isn't asian, so don't go saying I'm some crazy racist.  We enjoy the food, it's close, and it is BYOB, so we save a few bucks.

The staff and service are great although at times the growing popularity means they are slammed.  The food is fresh and the pricing and fact it is BYOB mean that your final bill is far lower than anywhere else with comparable food that I can think of.  If you bring white wine, sake, etc they are great about getting you a bucket of ice, glasses, etc.  Keep in mind this is all extra work and the bills are abnormally low due to the absence of alcohol charges so the tip should be calculated as if your liquor was on the bill. The downside to all this is due to its strengths.  Namely that it is getting very popular and it is BYOB.  I went on a Sat night recently and the place was packed.  When we were able to get some seating we unfortunately ended up near a large table of guys celebrating a birthday with copious amounts of Vodka.  They were done with their food, treating the place like a bar, and didn't care how obnoxious they were.  I guess they decided it was cheaper to have the party at a BYOB than to buy drinks at a bar.  If you can I recommend going on a weekday.  But don't let it stop you from trying it out on a weekend if you have to.  I will just cross my fingers that customers that abuse the BYOB policy don't become common.",0.9862,0.737,0.177,0.086,0.49552469135802474
