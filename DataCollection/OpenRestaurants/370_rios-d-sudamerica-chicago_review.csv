2016-12-11,5.0,"BEST RESTAURANT IN THE CHICAGO AREA HANDS DOWN!! I'm Peruvian, and I give this place 10/10 for authenticity and flavor. If you want a taste of the culture and food, this is the place you need to go. This restaurant immediately became one of my favorites after I had just one bite, and I've been coming here for years. I've been coming here since the place was in the smaller location across the street. And throughout the years, this place has never disappointed me. This place is great to have parties and get togethers for any occasion. Every time I've come here, the waiting time has been reasonable considering everything is made from hand and scratch, and the food has never failed to put a smile on my face. The service was incredible as always, the waiters came up to the table to ask us how we were about every ten minutes. It was my sisters birthday and they surprised her a leche flan with a candle on the house. The buffet is an an incredible deal, considering how much food you can eat for the very fair price. I've come before the buffet and ordered multiple things off the menu and they give you incredibly generous portion sizes. Every time I've taken the entrée home, it has lasted me one or two other meals. I highly recommend the choros a la chalaca and the anticuchos, the lomo saltado, aji de gallina, and the ceviche is unparalleled. This place is better than the other Peruvian restaurants in the area. Everybody who gives this place less than 4 stars either has terrible taste or doesn't appreciate Peruvian food or culture. Some things may taste ""off"" to some people, but Peruvian food is prepared in a certain way and that's why it doesn't have a conventional taste. Some may argue it is an acquired taste. Don't blame the restaurant because your palette just isn't as sophisticated or developed. And whoever doesn't tip their waiters at least 15% is rude and obnoxious. I went on yelp to check the buffet times and good thing I read that review before eating. I tipped my waiter 30% because that is the very least that the staff deserves. No, this is not a paid review, I'm just very passionate about my culture's food and utterly disappointed to see how many people either did not give this restaurant a fair chance or tip their waiters the legal amount.",0.9713,0.83,0.121,0.049,0.5412607709750566
2016-12-05,1.0,"Right from the start, this was the worst dining experience I have ever had. We went on a Saturday night around 730pm and were greeted by a very friendly young lady who showed us to a nice table right in the front window. There were only a handful of other diners there, which seemed a little odd for a Saturday night, but we stayed. After about five minutes, our server came and greeted us and told us she'd be right back to take our orders. Another five minutes later, she came back and took our wine order, and since the menu states everything is made by hand, we went ahead and ordered an appetizer and our entrees. We chose the Camaron Enrollado en Cangrejo Apanado) as an appetizer and got the Moqueca de Pescado and Brochetas Rio D' Janeiro for our entrees. We were served our wine and left alone for another 10-15 minutes. The server came back and apologized for the delay on the appetizer, saying the kitchen was backed up, even though there were only five tables occupied in the whole restaurant. We said no problem and continued to wait. Another five minutes later, our appetizer came out. The shrimp was cold and the crabmeat tasted off. The quality of this food did not appear or taste like something made by hand at all. It seemed like it was frozen and simply put in the fryer for service. To serve undercooked seafood, whether its fresh or frozen, is grossly irresponsible and could have very dangerous consequences. Another ten to fifteen minutes go by, giving my dining companion and myself some time to figure out what to do about the rest of the meal. We decided that we would talk to our server about the condition of our appetizer and cancel the entree order(s). Before our server made another appearance, a ""runner"" brought out our entrees. Our server followed shortly after, when we inquired about the appetizer's temperature and started to voice our concerns. She wasn't able to fully understand what we were saying, at which point we asked to speak to the manager. A ""man"" came to our table a short while later and proceeded to ask us what was wrong. No ""thank you for coming, is there some issue that I can help you with?"" or greeting or anything. We explained the situation and were met with a horrible attitude and no offer to remedy the situation at all. He said immediately that he would comp the appetizer, but that was it. When we tried to explain that the appetizer experience was so terrible that we didn't want to risk trying the entree, he acted as though we were just trying to pull a fast one on him. As though we have nothing better to do on a Saturday night than sit around in a restaurant for almost :45, only to complain and try to get out of a bill. I was so shocked that he wasn't willing to work with us at all, I decided it was better to pay for our wine and entrees than to stay another minute in that establishment. After we had our ""discussion"" with the ""manager,"" he proceeded to stare us down in an aggressive manner and pace until we paid the bill and left.This must happen there a lot, if the manager's first instinct in greeting a table is to be defensive, combative and rude. He also had the nerve to remind us that he has cooks to pay. Really?! We thought you had a kitchen of unpaid interns back there and we are so stupid we don't realize that you have staff to pay. If your idea of a nice dinner out consists of slow service, questionably safe seafood and terrible customer service, this is your kind of place. I honestly feel bad for the server and hostess that we encountered for having to work for such a terrible for excuse for a manager. You have been warned! The only positive part of the experience was the spicy ""sauce"" they serve with the bread.",-0.9878,0.783,0.088,0.129,0.5368180552391079

She made a comment indicating that the owner would reprimand her if he saw anyone with a Groupon taking food home. She even suggested to my other party that she hid the bag with leftovers because the owner was roaming around. WHAT? Sounds like absolute nonsense to me. It's not like it's a buffet or anything similar. We already paid for the fixed amount of food. The Groupon clearly says ""no carryout"" and says nothing about leftovers.

Decent amount of seats, especially in the upper level, which is usually for large parties and such. Sometimes, on some Saturdays, they would have a DJ play Latin music and people would dance. A great to go is during their specials. Also, it's a great time to for special occasions. I also know that they like to have buffets of Peruvian food.

Because our group was large, we made a reservation (especially considering it was Halloween Saturday night). The restaurant was pretty empty, so the reservation wasn't super necessary. The waitress and manager tended to our table very well, especially to the toddler at the table. We asked a lot of questions about the food, and was happily surprised with the depth of answers.

At our table, some of the things ordered were papa a la huancaina, lomo saltado, arroz chaufa, a couple versions of ceviche, cau cau, aji de gallina.

I ordered the tamal Verde which I thoroughly enjoyed. It was a good appetizer for one, maybe two. I also had the arroz con mariscos. This dish was good. It was a pretty big portion I could have shared easily. It was rich with garlic, fresh calimari, shrimp and other seafood. A minor setback was the one bad oyster. When the waitress finally came by I mentioned it. She took it to the kitchen as if on my side then returned to tell me that the chef said it was fresh! She then offered me another beer as if it would be comped, but when I eventually got the bill, it was not. I began writing this review while waiting an unreasonable long time to get my check which the waitress finally brought as this was over half written.

Four plump shrimp, encrusted in quinoa, were served over yucca seasoned with rocoto, olive oil, and lemon juice glazed with passion fruit sauce. There was a platter of camarones a la plancha for an entrée. Served with white rice that actually had flavour, this was an entrée to enjoy slowly. The dish that was new to me was the plate of arroz chuafa con camarones. I have had my share of Chinese fried rice and liked it. However, I am now in love with Peruvian fried rice. Because the appetizers and entrées were hearty, we sat for awhile and let our bellies settle before our final attack on some desserts. Light in texture, full of flavour, and heavy on the arteries, we had flan Peruano. The texture was not like that of old Jell-O, but like slicing through a cloud. Not drowned in a caramel glaze, it wasn't sugary, which made it that more enjoyable. The dessert that could result in a continuous, long line outside of Rio's D'Sudamerica is the lucuma temptation.

So the lady friend is out of town and I figured I would try Native Foods since she refuses to eat there due to what she calls, ""leading people on to believe that there is meat in the entrees.""  But after I took the dog down, asked the waitress if myself and the pooch could seat ourselves or if we had to wait, and she responded by saying, ""I don't work here.""  Ha.  My bad.  She was carrying something so I thought she was a waitress.  So rather than sit awkwardly at the table in front of hers, I took the pooch back and kept moving. On to the next establishment.  Rio's emin effin D'Sudamerica.  Peru'sd the menu (get it.  Stupid by witty right?) and decided to choose something that I thought would not be a safe bet, or something I wouldn't normally flock to. Tried the Tamal Verde and the Aji de Gallina.  For whatever stupid reason I didn't put 2 and 6 together, but the Tamal Verde is their version of a tamale.  It was actually more similar to a Puerto Rican pastele.  Don't know if that was spelled correctly. Delish.  I've tried to make the PR version before, and it just didn't fly.  These peeps made it fly.  Soft, supple (I love that word, makes me feel creepy), moist, and all in tact.  Thrown some thinly sliced onion, some weird side sauce, and we have ourselves a little brazilian tamal party. Next came the main entree.  Shaved chicken, in some sort of walnut sauce, with shiny rice.  It was a little odd, but the dish came with 2 pitted olives as well.  My pallet didn't mind, but my eyes were all like, hmmm.  Diff-er-ent.  I then proceeded to do what my weird ass does all the time.  Try everything alone, try this mixed with that, try that mixed with the other thing, try them all together, then go back to trying them separately. Tried to save some to bring leftovers for lunch tomorrow, but I felt that the food would be better off staying in my side... I mean by my side.  So I made an executive decision and sent that grub behind my troat box to slide straight to my love handles where it grossly and quickly congealed.  That may not sound appetizing.

When we asked for the drink menu he said it was in the table.. When asked for a second one so we could search quicker and get all the drinks ordered he stated there is only one per table and that's how it was..so we asked for more time while my dad in law ordered a margarita..he also asked what ingredients where used and if they were fresh ingredients.. Waiter said it was made from scratch..

Margarita arrives in a 16oz pint and my father in law looks at it, and has a fit.. Margaritas should be served in a traditional glass or a rocks glass(in my opinion & his), when he told the waiter that didn't look like a margarita, the waiter's tone of voice got higher almost condescending and said this is how they are served here..as my father in law still held his high horse the waiter seemed to try to out do his high horse with a higher one..NOT GOOD TO ARGUE WITH CUSTOMER...he should have simply asked what type of glass and switched it.. Also, during this confrontation the waiter said it was a fresh margarita made with triple sec, simple syrup, etc etc.. Hmmm that's not fresh.. Fresh and made from scratch would be agave syrup.. Anyway, he has to take it back and decided for a beer instead.. Waiter was not happy..then the good arrives.. Empanadas were thick and somewhat hard.. Didn't know what was in them..

2014-04-21,1.0,"Worst service on the planet! I came with a group of friends this past weekend for the first time. We were one of 3 parties in the entire place when we came in. First off, when the waitress can to take our order she took 3 people's order and and just walked away when it was the 4th's turn, which would have been fine because everyone has a brain fart every now and the if not for the fact it took me another 5 minutes to flag her back down in an empty restaurant. Secondly I don't know if she was new or not but she brought over 2 wrong plates before she got the first one right. During the actual meal we were doing everything short of back flips to try and get our waitress's attention on several occasions making actual eye contact but having the waitress quickly turn away and deliberately try to not pay attention.(now I wouldn't have believed this to be the case if it didn't happen so many times) About an hour in to the meal, another couple we know walks in and are seated at at the table next to us. It takes 40 min for their first appetizer to come out and it's the wrong order. The party then informs the waitress that they are in a bit of a rush and that they will just take the entree. At this point I've been here for almost 2 hours having had my meal and trying desperately to get my check. As I can't get my waitress's attention I flag down a nearby passing waitress and ask her for our check. After about 10 minutes or so with no check I try again to flag down our waitress 14ft away from me who is laughing it up with someone she apparently knows, again with no luck(she's desperately avoiding eye contact again). After a few minutes I manage to flag down a bus boy and ask him to let our waitress know that we need our check, which I watch him do...10 more minutes pass and at this point I almost consider doing the back flips to get a waitress(It was my birthday, I had somewhere to be, and a party to coordinate). The waitress finally comes over because the party the walked in an hour after us's entree was ready along with the correct appetizer they no longer wanted, and she asks me what she can do for me. I ask her for our bill, which she then informs me will be on the same bill as the four small tables now on this side of the room.( Back story: Members of one of the parties would be meeting me later at my birthday party however they wanted to have dinner with some of their friends first. My party figures"" hey we've never tried this place, let's have some dinner"". We, a party of 4 show up 30 minutes after the first party is seated and sit at a different table. They, a party of 6 were then joined by another party of 6. This now party of 12 has 3 members to whom I've actually met before and we 2 parties have separate meals.) No she informs us that all of our bills are together, we can not pay separately, and we will be charged and automatic 18% gratuity. This mega bill includes the party of 2 they came in an hour after us who were clearly on a date-esk outing. Now an 18% tip is not something I would normally complain about as it's pretty standard but in this instance I felt very strongly that the service was not deserving of it. Asked around the table to make sure I wasn't crazy and came to the consensus that they were perfectly rational feelings. I then asked to speak to manager and was directed to a gentleman behind the bar who told me that he was the manager. I asked that due to the service that he extend a one time courtesy of allowing us to choose our own tip amount. He brought over the waitress and asked specifically if she had given me ""bad service"". As I was trying not to be rude and avoid an awkward situation up to this point informed her that it ""wasn't the greatest and did not warrant an 18% gratuity"" and explained the reasons why. Both the man and the waitress then started to argue loudly that she did provide good service and that she works purely on tips so I had to tip her this amount.(If there was any kind of service at all we would not be having this issue. I have never contested a tip before and am very often too lazy to write a yelp review even with terrible service but this was on a whole different scale.) After about 10-12 minutes of arguing the manager came over and asked what was wrong(YES THE MANAGER-which meant they had me pointlessly arguing with a bartender for 10 minutes. At this point I had to leave 50 minutes ago. The manager told her to split our bill and allow us to choose our tip. Note I would never under tip as I worked as a server for about a year earning purely on tips. I thought this was over but when the waitress came over she did not have the check she came over to argue some more and insist we give her an 18% tip. During this specific conversation I asked her 4 times why we were still arguing, stated that the situation had been resolved, and asked if I could just have our check only to have her fire up another argument. We finally got our check after AN HOUR overall.",0.9489,0.815,0.101,0.084,0.5018405002405003

It is strong.  Actually I knew better, so I ordered it for her. I immediately ordered the seco de carne because I lived in Ecuador for awhile and really loved it there.  And we waited on it. While we waited we flirted with the bartender who was really personable.  After the Seco de Carne she said she would order for us.  So she brought out two items not on the menu.  One was shrimp.  And it was out of this world good.  And after eating the seco de carne and the shrimp my taste buds were worn out.  I cannot remember the third dish we had.  I was still relishing the first two.

2014-01-13,3.0,"After not having been back for 8 years, friends and I headed there for dinner. I am glad to see that the new location looks very nice....but looks are deceiving. It's definitely an upgrade from the other place but only in looks. Regardless, the food is still better than other Peruvian places I have been to. The portions are generous, the taste is great and the menu has a good selection for everyone.  The only reason is does not get 5 start is due to the service, which I consider very important. We were seated at a dirty table that had a stream of stains running down the wall to the back of the seats and was sticky. Come to find out the stains are from a leak that has not been fixed. I must say I do not expect dirty muddy water to fall on my face, eyes or mouth when I am about to eat. They moved us but not without making us wait for a few minutes to figure out which of the 8 empty tables to give us. When we were relocated, we were seated at the very last table in back with chairs that had holes and springs that poked coming out, or chairs that sunk in. Not to mention that the heat does not reach all the way back there. Our server was terrible. She would disappear for long periods of time in between. We were left to wait at least 15-20 minutes each time to order or ask for anything as our server was very busy chatting up the rest of the staff. Our food took forever and our whole experience there lasted 3 hours for 3 people and $100. I think carry out will be a better option next time.

2013-11-04,5.0,"My wife and I found that we had a free evening this past Saturday.  We wanted to head into the city and I found Rio's on Yelp.  The reviews looked good and the food sounded interesting.  I like South American influenced cuisine and had never eaten (to my knowledge) Peruvian food before. We arrived at 7:30 and although we had reservations, it appeared we would have been able to get a table nonetheless as there were various open tables throughout the restaurant.  I have to admit, I was a little surprised to find the restaurant less than full on a Saturday night. We were seated at a booth near the back of the restaurant.  The decor was very nice.  Tables all had linen and the booths were large and comfy.  The ceiling was very high - there was a staircase behind my booth that led to a second floor, although I 'm not sure if it was add'l seating or whether it was a small balcony area that overlooked the main dining area - but even with the 2-story ceiling, the atmosphere was cozy and warm.  The walls were covered with several murals (Incas, Spanish conquistador) and a very nice tile mosaic of Machu Picchu . I couldn't help but notice that the chairs in the restaurant were very stylish.  There was a bar near the front that did have a small crowd throughout the evening. Our waitress that evening was new and was not as helpful with recommendations as we would have liked - but everyone's got to start somewhere and we certainly did not hold it against her or the restaurant.  She asked to take our drink order and if we wanted any appetizers - we ordered drinks but told her we were in no hurry (at least not then) and would wait to order appetizers.  She was okay with that.  The wine menu had a nice selection and I drank a very tasty Malbec (both Malbec's available by the glass were from Mendoza, Argentina - the best area for Malbec's in my opinion).  They brought a basket of bread and butter to the table, along with a small bowl of a green puree of some sort.  My wife spread a little on the bread and commented that it was very spicy.  I love spicy and immediately dove in.  I was a wonderful blend of green peppers and jalapeños (I asked the hostess on the way out) that had a good kick.  A wonderful alternative to butter. We started off with the Quinoa encrusted Shrimp appetizer which was delightful.  It was served over Yucca and had a passion fruit sauce that complimented the flavors of the dish wonderfully.  The appetizer seemed to take a considerable period of time to come, but the menu (which had a large selection of items) did state very clearly that ""Please be patient, our cuisine is made fresh to order.""  We normally would have waited until completing our appetizer to order the main course, but since it seemed to take awhile, we ordered our main course.  I should note that during our entire visit the staff was contentious about keeping our water glasses full and cleaning up dirty plates (bread and appetizer) without being intrusive.  Our appetizer plate was cleared by a gentleman who appeared to be the manager or owner.  He politely asked us how we enjoyed our meal and did not overstay his welcome by prodding for more information or trying to make small talk. The main course did not take as long as the appetizer did, and was equally as delicious.  I ordered what was advertised as a traditional Peruvian dish of aromatic rice (cilantro) topped with duck marinated in beer.  It was delicious - a leg/thigh and split breast over some of the most delicious rice I've had.  I usually add salt to everything - but found this flavorful enough that I don't think I can even tell you if there was any salt and pepper on the table!  My wife went with the Shrimp sautéed in chili and topped with a garlic butter cream sauce and served with white rice.  She warned me early that if I didn't taste it then, there would be nothing left to taste.  I did and found it very good.  Her serving was smaller than mine, and she finished hers (except for some rice).  I consider myself to be a fairly big eater, but must admit that I did not finish the rice or the leg.  I certainly could have, but would have been uncomfortable. Unfortunately, about the time our food arrived, my daughter called and need us to return home when we could for a non-emergency.  We did not rush our meal, but did not take the additional time to have another drink or to try the desserts (which the hostess also advised me when we were leaving were very very good (my wife stepped to the restroom before we left and I had a little time to converse with the hostess)).  I commented to her that given the quality of the food, I was surprised it was not busier.  She indicated that they had a larger early crowd and that Saturday's are usually busier than this particular one. Overall, I enjoyed the meal and atmosphere very much and would not hesitate to return or to recommend it to my family and friends.  I've giving this restaurant 5 stars.",0.9988,0.823,0.145,0.031,0.5236247420440968

2013-09-08,2.0,"Yikes! Do not come here with a Groupon! We came here again a few days ago because as my previous review indicates, I LOVED this place when we didn't have a Groupon. We saw the deal and of course we were like ""hell yeah"".  Wow, what a mistake. We arrived pretty early and there was already a few tables seated. When we made our reservation they asked us if we were using Groupon, now I'm not sure if this is something they write down or something, but I feel like we got really bad service and food.  We ordered the same entrees as last time and the food was so different. From our previous visit a month ago, the portions were insanely smaller. The Mar y Tierra which is described as having scallops, steak, etc did not have any scallops again in it. Last time, we did not receive scallops with it either, but they replaced it with mussels. Both times without any sort of warning. This time the food was small, and we only found two mussels.  We ordered the Papa a la Diabala again and the same problem ensued. There was less food, the steak was greasy, smaller, and much thinner. There was less potatoes and more rice.  The only shining thing about the experience was the appetizer which was the crab encrusted shrimp, it was divine.  I think what made everything worse was the service. We asked for refills, 5...10...15 minutes go by and nothing. We had no drinks and no water. Then, I could not flag down anyone to save my life. It got to the point where I picked up all of our drinks and walked across the dining area and just approached our waitress, I'm sure she was mortified, but this food is spicy and I am thirsty.  She only asked us if we needed anything once. We were given stale bread and compared to the service we received when we came without a Groupon, it was like this server was told to be awful to us. I get that Groupon is not profitable to businesses, BUT treating people who use them especially when they LOVED your establishment before is not going to get you more business. I loved this place and was looking forward to visiting every few weeks. Now after this poor treatment and seeing how quickly they will scam you because of using a coupon?

2013-09-04,3.0,I've been here several time and have never had a bad experience. The pisco sours are amazing! So good. Most things we've ever ordered from here has been awesome. The shrimp and the lomo saltado are two things I could order over and over again. The house salad is delicious. Mussels were not good. Service is friendly but  it suffers because they do not have enough people working the room. There were two times when I was here that our waitress was also the bartender and the drinks that she was making so well took time...which meant she didn't come by often.  A lot of this can be forgiven with food and drinks this good but it would be really nice if service was smoother and more attentive. It often feels like most diners are looking around for someone or something (me included) when they should just be having a good time.,0.9857,0.756,0.22,0.024,0.6509803921568629
2013-08-09,4.0,"We went last night on a Groupon I purchased.  We LOVED this place!!  The food was awesome.  We had the Patas Rellenas (fried stuffed potatoes with steak and other goodies inside).  For our main courses, my husband had the Mar Y Tierra and I had the Moqueca (with Mahi Mahi as they were out of halibut).  We were blown away by the portion size and well cooked and well seasoned food. The coconut sauce on the fish was superb!!  Very tasty. We will be coming back.  I agree with the other reviewers, the portion size and meal are well worth the prices.  My husband couldn't finish his steak/seafood mixed grill and had to take it home :)   The bread basket is served with this amazing, really spicy green sauce....  be careful - it's HOT!  But it has a great flavor - spread it with the butter on your bread and you will be hooked!!

The two servers until then had been chatting it up behind the bar towards the front vs. paying attention to customers?!

2013-07-12,2.0,"Came here alone on a groupon with the intent to order the $30 steak to make up the groupon total. I smelled the deliciousness of grilled meat on the way in and I was super excited. The restaurant was fairly empty and yet I had to wait quite a bit for the one waitress/hostess to seat me. The decor was cute and I liked the wall murals and comfy chairs. The music was pleasant and not too loud, which made it really easy to hear the babies gurgling and wailing behind me. The waitress was very inattentive the entire time I was there. I had to wait for her to take my drink order and ended up just ordering everything at once, I had to wait for my bread, wait for my drink, wait for my check, wait for my change, etc. There were only 3-4 seated tables. While I was there, I saw two tables actually have to seek out the waitress behind the bar to hand her their check or ask for something because she was busy talking to the other staff person and watching a soap opera on tv. The bread that came out was cold and a bit stale accompanied with cold butter (I hate when restaurants do this- please warm it a bit so I can spread it) and a very spicy jalapeno creamy type sauce, which was tasty. My New York strip was large and fatty and slightly overdone with some super charred bits that I couldn't even bite through. The chimichurri sauce that came with it was cold- as in just from the fridge. That is not a nice thing to put on a freshly seared steak. The grilled vegetables they promised was just asparagus, which was good so I didn't complain. The fried potatoes were greasy and soggy previously frozen strips and I could only eat two. It also comes with some iceberg lettuce and a tomato- garnish or just a disappointing version of a salad? This meal was not worth $30. I ordered the flan for dessert and it had a strange greenish tint to it and was pretty bland. My beer was a brazillian dark beer, which I enjoyed, but not as much as the flies that gathered around and drowned in it. I only finished half my beer before it was completely overtaken by the flies and I really hope I didn't drink one before I noticed. Why keep the door open and let the bugs in at a nice restaurant? And did the inattentive waitress notice? Of course not. And I didn't want to drink the water because it tasted of cucumbers. I don't understand why so many restaurants put cucumbers in their water now. I really prefer it plain. Anyway, I was bummed to have such a negative dining experience here because the other reviews were so positive and I was really looking forward to a nice juicy steak.

Not because the place is packed, but because they don't answer their phones and they are disconnected from OpenTable now. We called two times a couple Fridays ago to make a reservation to use our youswoop, and there was no answer. This Friday, we thought we should go no matter what, as our deal was expiring soon. After two call attempts, no answer, and a full voicemail, we headed there hoping for the best. We arrived about 7:30 on a Friday night, and there were many open seats. We were quickly seated. I can't really describe the vibe of the restaurant. Maybe Peruvian with an early 1990's dining room decor twist? Our waiter was kind, but service was spotty. It was strange because a bunch of the waitstaff were lined up along the bar, so they seemed plenty staffed. We started out with the ceviche. I didn't really care for it. First of all, the shrimp were whole, with the tail on. I thought ceviche was supposed to have small bits of shrimp with lime and spices? I did enjoy the addition of mango, as it was a delicious sweetness added to a normally quite bitter dish. For dinner, I have the arroz con camarones, or shrimp with rice. There was a lot of food, but it wasn't great. There dish was packed with cilantro, which seemed to be the only spice. I can't remember the name of the dish my husband had, but it was some kind of steak with the standard rice, beans, and plantains. I have never tasted such a fatty and salted steak before. It was quite chewy, and I did not care for it. It took a while for us to get our check, and the only reason we got it was because the hostess saw us repeatedly look around for our waiter. She came over to ask if we needed something. We eventually got the check and paid. All totaled, the bill plus tax and tip came to around $62. With the deal ($20 for $40), we ended up less $42 and didn't have a good meal to show for it.

I recommend the Arroz con Mariscos--HANDS DOWN-- which is like a white wine seafood paella. My date said it was the best rice he has ever had in his life. Don't quote me though.  We also got the 1/2 chicken, which came with a salad and fries. Also very good.  All I can say is that this meal was more memorable than the dinners I've had at home for Christmas. But that's because I live in southern California and there's no such thing as Christmas in soCal. But I digress... I'd go here for all occasions if only I could. There's a bar as soon as you walk in to the left, but  the restaurant is pretty much an omnispective, open space with interesting decor. I found the combination of Latin American mural painting and the cloth-napkin atmosphere to be quite alluring in its irony...

2012-09-21,4.0,"I was there on a Thursday, at 8:30, table for 2. I took my wife here for her birthday. It was the second time we went to Rio de Sudamerica: the first time we just loved it, and we kept talking about going back again but then it just fell off the radar. So I took the chance to make it a surprise dinner for her birthday.  The restaurant was empty, except for another couple of tables, probably because it was a weekday and a little late for dinner for the average American. We ordered a Pisco Sour and a Pina Colada for drinks, and they were both delicious and refreshing. Then we shared a Chevice mixsto for appetizer. The Chevice was juicy and fresh, with a nice lemony sauce that makes my mouth water just by thinking about it. My wife's entree was the Lomo saltado al pisco, which I believed she ordered also the first time we went there and she simply loved it. I had a taste of it and I really liked it too. Unlike the first time I went to Rio, when I ordered a safer (and maybe moring) Corte De ""Entrana"" (basically a skirt steak topped with grilled onions. served with white rice, black beans, fried plantains and a small salad), this time I wanted to venture a little bit more into the Peruvian cuisine Arrot con Pato (aromatic rice with cilantro topped with duck marinated in dark beer and ""chicha de jorarice and duck) which, according to the menu, is a traditional dish from the northern coast of Peru.  Unfortunately, I found the duck a little bland in flavor and the rice, while with a little more personality than the duck, it was a little on the oily side.  The portions were both pretty big, and we had leftover for another meal. As a dessert, we had the Churritos with hot chocolate that were good, but I am not a huge fan of churritos in general (Hey, it wasn't my birthday, after all, and I wasn't calling the shots for dessert!!).  Next time (because there will totally be a next time) I am really curious to try the Alfajores and see if they are as good as those you can find in Argentina! As a final note, the service is quite casual and basic, but I actually like it this way more than what it is commonly found in Chicago.

The Mar y Tierra (grilled surf and turf) was delicious. The meat was well cooked and well seasoned. The moqueca was just ok. The halibut was completely overcooked and the cooks had done a poor job of removing the bones. I almost choked on one. The sauce had a good consistency but was extremely bland.

The hubby ordered the Pollo a la Brasa: half chicken with salad and fries and I went with the Lomo Saltado al Pisco: sauteed tomatoes, onions, potatoes with chicken.  The presentation was nice, the portions are very large.  I thought my chicken was a little dry compared to my hubby's juicy bird.  The potatoes in my dish were cut and cooked similar to French fries, but not crispy...they were tasty. The decor compared to the last few places I have been to was a little cheesy.  It reminded me of an older resort in the Bahamas with the wall murals, white linens and numerous potted plants.  It even smelled oddly like it, a little like a musty wet basement.  The air filtration ventilation system we sat under was also slightly loud and obnoxious.",0.8016,0.88,0.075,0.045,0.5108374384236454

I had come here a few weeks back and really enjoyed their food. I'm a fan of Peruvian food and heard this was one of the better Peruvian restaurants in the city. I tried the lomo saltado con Pisco and it was amazing -- especially as next-day leftovers. I really liked the tamale verde too. The bread they serve before you order isn't fresh or warm, however, so you can skip that one.  Like I said, went back to introduce my bf to this place last Friday and to celebrate my birthday but we ended up leaving before we got our order because they took too long! We were seated promptly, placed our order -- seafood date night special and lomo saltado -- but not once did our server check up on us. He kept checking on the table right behind us, however. It was the end of the week and my bf and I were chatting not realizing it had been 45 minutes since we placed our order. Place wasn't even packed so no good reason for the delay. It was then that our server came and told us the comp had a glitch so the kitchen never received our order. He said he had already placed the order again but it would be some minutes. He left to go check on our food again and didn't come back after some minutes again still w/o our food. We looked around and several parties who came in after us had already received their orders and were enjoying their food. He didn't even offer to give us more bread or something to hold us over since our order wasn't coming any time soon. Our order came with appetizers and they couldn't even scramble to make that??? We had ceviche... and that doesn't even require any cooking! My bf just suggested we pay for our drinks and leave to go eat somewhere else.   We went to the bar to pay for our drinks and were about to pay when the manager finally came out and apologized to us. He insisted that we not pay for our drinks (we didn't then). He asked if we would stay b/c the food was already ready but at the point we were already so annoyed that they didn't pay better attention to us so we left.

Dinner last night exceeded my expectations. Aside from some weird guy at the table next to us wearing a fanny pack and stretching, we really enjoyed our meal at Rio's. Starters: We ordered the Jalea de Mariscos en Salsa de Cebolla, which was seafood: fish, shrimp, octopus, and calamari lightly battered and seasoned in a mixed greens and onion salad. We asked for only fish and shrimp and our server was more than happy to accommodate our request. We really liked the fish, the batter was very light and the fish was not overcooked at all. It was a nice recommendation by our server. We also ordered the Ensalada de Quinua. A really fresh, delicious quinua salad with tons of basil and cilantro. The olive oil and lime juice dressing was very light and did not overpower the salad at all. My wife thought this was better than the fried seafood dish. Entrees: I ordered the Seco de Carne - Beef simmered in a light cilantro and herbs based stew along with red peppers and peas served with rice and pinto beans. The beef was very tender and the stew they had cooked it in was a very unique and reminded me of the week I spent in Cuzco years ago. It seemed very authentic. The pinto beans that accompanied the dish were exceptionally good. Dessert: We ordered churro, which came with a small bowl of chocolate dipping sauce, it was okay, but nothing outstanding. Finally we ordered a bottle of the Vino Verde, which was very good, and priced at only $22.  They do offer corkage for $10, but the wine prices here seemed very reasonable. The service here was exceptional. Our server was very knowledgeable and was processed our You Swoop with no issues at all!

I was excited since I love experiencing everything he has about his culture and what he's grown up with. Unfortunately, the highlight of the ENTIRE evening was the super sweet hostess; she came over to the bar numerous times while we waited for a table, and...the table behind us who were upset and very vocal about 2 of the 4 orders being ""lost"". The waitress was an absolute twit. My guy ordered a beer (Skol) which they no longer carry. He then ordered a Caipirinha and she brought him over a beer. When he indicated this isn't what he ordered, she said, ""Oh! You wanted a Caipina? I'm hearing different things all day!"" And yes, that is how she pronounced Caipirinha. When you're working at an ethnic restaurant, shouldn't you at least know the correct pronunciation of the menu items?? And Caipirinha?? Seriously? That's standard on ANY Brazilian menu! I can't even tell you how many times she walked by, looked at our table of empty drink glasses and empty bread/butter plates and just looked the other way. This would have been the perfect opportunity to offer another drink or appetizer, etc. We waited close to an hour to receive our entrees. I ordered the fire roasted 1/2 chicken. It was outstanding. The seasonings were superb and the salad extremely flavorful. Unfortunately, my guy's dinner was more than disappointing. The skewer of meat was charred RAW. Grilled perfectly on the outside but RAW on the inside. When he cut into it, blood ran from the center. We mentioned it to the waitress who gladly took it back to the kitchen for a few more minutes on the grill. Few more minutes turned into 10 and I wouldn't begin eating until his food came back. So now mine is getting cold and we're still waiting, drinkless, on his medium-well skewer of beef. We ate less than half of our meals and decided we'd never be back; the service sucked, the food was less than average (and raw) and the wait was way more than it should have been. Reconsider if you're planning on having dinner here. Maybe the service and kitchen prep might be different on a evening during the week.

We ordered the Estilo Rio's, Especialidad de la Casa.  You have your choice of seafood (we chose the MIXTO-fish, squid, octopus, shrimp) marinated in lime juice, coconut milk, cilantro, Aji limo (Peruvian habanero) mango, ginger, onions. Served with sweet potato and plantain chips. It was so good. The sweet potato was still warm on the plate and the ceviche was cold. The lime made it sour and the mango made it sweet. It was such a great combination of everything! For our entree, we ordered the Arroz con Pato o Pollo which is aromatic rice with coriander (cilantro), topped with  1/2 duck marinated in dark beer.  The duck was so tender (falling off the bone) and the rice was OUTSTANDING. I cant even pin point why the rice was so addictive (and I am NOT usually a rice person) but I could not stop eating it. The texture was perfect! We also ordered the Cau Cau de Conchas which was slow-cooked scallops ,mussels, shrimps served with Peruvian potatoes, corn and peas.  Our waitress hooked us up by adding more broth to our dish so that it was easier to share. This came with white rice. The flavors of this dish were also very good and the scallops and mussels were very soft and fresh. For dessert we ordered the churros. There were six small pieces, perfectly fried, filled with caramel, and covered in sugar and cinnamon.  On the side was a little dish of chocolate for dipping. WOW. It was really good. The portion was just right for sharing. Parking in the area is ample and easy.  The price tag for an appetizer, two entrees, and dessert between two people was about $30.  Extremely affordable, considering we had two seafood plates. Overall a great experience. We had booth seating so it was extremely comfortable. The lighting is dim and the music was soft so the ambiance was great. Our waitress was so helpful and honest about her own personal taste and opinion of the dishes. She gave us great recommendations and this was another successful food experience!",0.9988,0.786,0.211,0.003,0.634022866022866

2009-08-21,5.0,"I'm pretty new to Peruvian cuisine, but from what I experienced so far, I quite like it. This place epitomizes my three required characteristics for a 5-star restaurant -the food, service and ambiance. First, the food was excellent. I'm embarrassed to say I can't remember the actual names of the dishes -a potato dish with a very light, liquid cheese served over it. My main course was ceviche -but with a unique twist -mangos, a side of Peruvian corn. It was all quite delicious and unique -flavors I had never tasted before but liked. The service was great! It was a Tuesday, and not crowded. Francisco was very friendly, talking to us as if we were old friends. Lastly, the place was unexpectedly large. I always expect a city strip location to have low ceilings and be small and narrow. This place must have utilized several stores -it has immense ceilings, giving it a glamorous feel. Wallpaper adorns the walls with real life scenes of Peru. They also have an upstairs balcony and private seating area. Francisco mentioned they also offer ""free"" party packages -if you guarantee 15 people for whatever occasion, they will give you an hour of free drinks, a $50 gift certificate and free dessert at your reserved table. NOT BAD! I'm already excited, thinking of what kind of event I can throw here! I will be back.

We keep coming back to this place as the prices are so inexpensive for the quality and quantity of food. We always take leftovers home. We've tried lots of dishes here and everything has always been fresh and well put together. The night starts with bread and a harmless looking creamy green sauce. Warning: it is NOT harmless. Now, I love food with a seriously high 'sweat factor' but after a couple pieces of bread dunked into this sauce I'm reaching for my water. It's so good though that you have to have more, then repeat water. One of our favorite appetizers is definitely the Rios special fish ceviche. It's fantastic, perfectly balanced with fruit juices and tender. My boyfriend is not crazy about fish, which is a product of growing up with microwaved, previously frozen, unspecified white fish. When we get sushi he typically eats the rolls, definitely not sashimi. This ceviche has converted him and he actually now craves this dish all the time. I also love the beef heart skewer. It's not for the faint at heart by description but is actually quite harmless with a nice, firm texture but not dry as well done steak can get. Favorite entrees include a massive skirt steak, rabbit, cilantro rice (which for some reason only comes with a chicken dish), and mixed ""death by meat"" grill plate that can easily rival Tango Sur's. Again, huge portions, flavorful and not overseasoned.  This place is definitely worth checking out.

The medium tenderloin was a tad more done than I'd like. Compared  to the ribeye the husband had, we preferred the ribeye more ($32). Asparagus and garlic parmesan potatoes were perfect.

I think if there was a Peru/Argentina ride at Disney World, the decor would feel a lot like this place. That said, I liked the atmosphere. Maybe I just like Disney World. We had a good table though that was nice and roomy. It was fairly quiet and some might even say romantic. I also enjoyed the food. I had the Brocheta's Rio D'Janeiro and my fiance had the Pollo Brazilero. Both of these were very good and a great value, I thought. I may have been influenced by the 3 mojito's that I had though which were also great and very strong. So what's with the two stars? I really wanted to have only 1 mojito. I ended up ordering the second due to our food taking so long. The third was on the house after the 60 minute mark of waiting for our food. In the end, I think we waited approximately 75 minutes for entree's from the time that we ordered them. The mojito was a nice gesture, but we felt like we were on an episode of Kitchen Nightmares. Unfortunately, we knew Gordon Ramsay wasn't going to be saving the day any time soon. Our waitress was very nice and explained that the kitchen was backed up due to a large party. This party was 12 people deep and in plain sight of us. If a party of 12 can bring down the whole restaurant, especially one of this size on a Friday night, that's a problem. I liked the food, but I'm fairly sure I won't be back.",0.9974,0.745,0.235,0.02,0.5735987103174605

The decor is dramatic - very tall ceilings with a lofted private dining room.  The place was practically empty when we walked in (at 7 p.m. on a Friday), but still, we both said, ""wow"" when we saw the interior. I was really hoping for the best, but Rio's was just ""okay"".  The bread was crusty (and not in a good way), our food (ceviche, papa rellena, arroz con mariscos and lomo saltado) was mediocre and the service, although very pleasant, was not particularly great.  We sat with an empty wine glass from the appetizer through the main course and waited 15 minutes for a refill on the crusty bread.",0.9486,0.808,0.141,0.051,0.60375

2007-06-01,5.0,"We visited Rios D'Sudamerica after a long afternoon and early evening of drinking at the nearby Map Room.  Leaving the Map Room we explored our options in the immediate area, which inevitably led to a number of impromptu foot races.  After a few 50 yd coed intramural heats in the alley (and after seeing that Rinconcito was closed) we stumbled into Rios D'Sud and begged the nice young hostess for a table. She obliged.  At this point it should be noted that most of us were extraordinarily drunk, not to mention out of breath and sweaty.  We weren't boisterous and hooligan-drunk, but drunk, nonetheless.  She accomodated us without batting an eye, and informed us that we would be welcome to grab some wine or any other sundry alcohol from the nearby convenience store. A hop, skip, and two more foot-races later and we had our provisions.  We returned to the restaurant, out of breath and ladened with several bottles of wine, and they gave us a warm reception and took care of everything necessary for the wine service. They opened our white wine bottles and provided the proper tableside cooling bucket, leaving their red-hued brethren on the table for our access.    To be honest, I don't really remember what I ordered or how good it was. I'm told that, at the time, I was very impressed by the food, and surprised at the comparable authenticity of their fare (that is, some south american dishes that you don't often see even in other south american establishments in the city).  My girlfriend took home some of the food, and it was deemed ""tasty.""  The waitresses were all refreshingly nice and friendly, and didn't give us a hard time at all. I could tell they were keeping a close eye on us should it appear that were disturbing the other clientele, but we were restrained enough to not warrant a scolding.  Overall I thought it was a really good meal. Exceptional circumstances, of course, but I plan on going back at the beginning of the night to check it out again.

Im more into the hole-in-the-wall, weathered places. My experience has told me that a place focusing on their decor that much cant serve good food. Alas, I was pleasantly surprised by their food. Sorry i cannot give an exact review on their dishes, but I had a steak product, which was surprisingly delicious. I sampeld some of the parties other offerings, and was pleased with the flavorful variety of what they offered, including seafood. All-in-all, we had a good time, and the waitstaff was friendly and accommodating. BYOB helped make this a good experience.

The bartenders have been excellent everytime, handling large, complex bar orders with ease. I'll certainly miss the BYOB part (yep, I have a lotta booze). I would recommend reservations, especially on weekends. Food: For food in this vein, I have been a repeat offender at Cuatro in the South Loop, although Rios has more focus on Brazilian/Peruvian cuisine. So far, I haven't had any complaints other than their 'seafood medley' which was only OK (sorry, forget the name). If you like crab, definitely grab the Pinzas de Cangrejo Apanadas, which was basically a crab claw appetizer with a seasoned breading that was awesome. Atmosphere: Super high ceilings and colorful surroundings for a fairly laid back dinner. Music was sometimes jacked up too high for a place like this (see: Carnivale), but no biggie.

2007-01-01,4.0,"This new restaurant is currently BYOB, a huge plus, but they are trying to obtain a liquor license and will do away with the BYOB once that happens. Boo! We went last night with a party of 10 at an 8:30 reservation. I was told when I made the reservation that the kitchen closed at 10, but that we could linger as long as we wanted. When we arrived our server informed us that the kitchen was closing at 9, and it was already 8:40! He was absolutely no help (not the brightest of the bunch, but I'll get to that in a minute). I checked with the hostess, who was much more competent, and she assured us that we woud not have a problem. Relaxed once again, we leisurely sipped our wine and ordered appetizers. The server had no clue what half the stuff was, and had to keep checking back with the hostess and kitchen to take our order.  Surprisingly enough, all of our food came out, and came out the way we ordered it. (However the table next to us was not so lucky--the waiter--the same one we had-- apparently fogot to take the order of one person at their table, and when the food came out...). The food was delicious and the portions were huge. I was a big fan of the ceviche and the chicken. The seafood paella was outstanding and we really had no complaints. Then the bill came. Our waiter had left off all of the appetizers and sides, as well as a few entrees. We pointed this out to him and he barely said thank you, as he went back to redo our bill. It was $140 more when he finally added in everything. We paid part with cash, and had him put the rest on credit cards (18%gratuity was included). After we handed him the cards, we realized we were $1.70 short, and took out the cash to add to the bill. When the waiter came back, he actually had the nerve to point this out to us! 1) Considering we just saved him $140 out of his own pocket, he really should not be complaining 2) If we were honest enough to point out the $140, we probably are also honest enough not to stiff him $2.  We tried to explain to him that we had the $2, but he just didnt get it, and kept saying, you are $2 short. Moron. All that said, I would go back there as dinner was delicious, relatively inexpensive, and the atmosphere was very cool.

2006-12-04,4.0,"After eating at Rios de Sudamerica last week, I'm amazed that word hasn't gotten out about this place.  My gf and I had a fantastic meal there and I'm already itching to go back.  So why all the fuss? For starters, Rios is a BYOB place that goes above and beyond most BYOB places in that if you bring your own liquor, they'll make cocktails for you (there is a liquor store right next door for your convenience).  This provided the perfect opportunity for my gf and I to finish off the Vox and Kahlua that was sitting at home.  I ended up ""ordering"" a Black Russian while my gf asked for something sweet and not too strong, to which the bartender concocted a blue mojito for her.  I didn't think mojitos were made with vodka so I'm guessing that perhaps the bartender borrowed some of the rum that someone else had brought in (not that I was complaining or anything).  Do note that there is a $2.50 ""corkage"" fee charged per person, that they will charge you for their mixers (juices and sodas were about $2-$3) and that their BYOB status is temporary (our server said they should be getting their liquor license some time in January). In addition to the funky BYOB setup, the place also has got some damn good food.  Any place that touts itself as an ""eclectic fusion of Brazilian, Argentinean and Peruvian cuisine"" is definitely worth checking out in my book.  /We started off with the Pinzas de Cangrejo Apanadas -- three crab claws wrapped in more crab meat that's breaded and pan fried.  This dish was crab-a-riffic and highly recommended for anyone who's a fan of crab.  For entrees, my gf got the Arroz Con Mariscos, which was basically a rice dish with tons of seafood (sort of like a paella minus the baking).  It was quite delicious and very flavorful.  As for me, I got the Lomo Saltado al Pisco -- a very simple dish with beef, tomatoes and onions with rice and potatoes on the side.  Our server said it was a very traditional Peruvian dish; I have no idea how authentic the dish was but I can say it was very tasty.  There's something to be said about restaurants that do a good job preparing simple dishes because I'll take that over a dish that's original and creative but lacking in taste.  For dessert, we got some sort of bread pudding which, sadly, was not so good.  It was too sweet and soggy.  Not the best way to end a meal but it didn't change our impression of their food overall.   Service was excellent, prices are very reasonable and the ambiance is hip and fun.  To be honest, I'm not sure why this place is still floating under the radar.  We went on a Friday night and the place was roughly 80% filled -- not bad but not great either.  I suspect the reason why business has been slow so far is because:  1) there isn't a lot going on near the Armitage/Damen intersection (though Cafe LaGuardia is across the street and it seems to do very well)  2) most people can't spell Rios de Sudamerica, thus making it harder to remember when trying to come up with a place to grab dinner (when will restaurants learn that picking a name that isn't easy to spell/pronounce is just not good for business)? Do yourself a favor and make reservations there before the secret gets out.  You won't regret it!",0.9947,0.835,0.124,0.042,0.5408531746031745
2006-08-17,3.0,"My friend James and I decided to go to dinner last night but we had no destination in mind when we started walking from Damen and Milwaukee. We ended up passing a number of places and shrugging our shoulders at each one until we got to the corner of Damen and Armitage. I pointed over at this place and he said something like: ""Oh, that's finally open. They've been working on it for about a year."" So we ended up looking at the menu and decided to give it a whirl. According to Metromix, It's the baby of Dino Perez, also behind Rinconcito Sudamericano, which is on Armitage just East of Damen, while Rios de Sudamerica is on Armitage just West of Damen. It is decorated in appealing decor and warehouse high ceilings with floor to ceiling curtains. It's fancy. The fare is mostly Peruvian, but the menu also includes Argentinian dishes. Turns out that Rios opened August 11th, last Friday, so there are still a couple kinks to iron out. They don't have their liquor license yet so James went to find wine after we ordered. Our waitress seemed eager to test out her prowess with her wine key, so she showed off on our bottle of 7-Eleven Pinot Grigio and swept our wine away to chil in the cooler. The rolls were spiced with ground pepper and chunks of a jalapeno or equivalently spiced pepper. James was going to order something he was familiar with but he ended up switching his order to the conejo al carbon (charbroiled rabbit) at the last minute  He enjoyed it and said that the potatoes that came with it were dreamy. My duck was cooked in two kinds of beer and was served atop a stack of green-hued rice. James thought it might have been green from basil, but I'm not sure if that was the taste. There were also tiny onions in the rice. The duck was cooked a little more than I am used to, but the flavor was overwhelmingly rich. I had also ordered a side of papas fritas, which was the weakest part of the meal. The fries came out on a rectangular plate all lined up in a row. I counted 15 fries for $4.00 and that's a little bit over 26 cents per fry, which was a rip off because they were not good in the slighest. They were really dry and they became soggy within minutes.  To note: There are few options for vegetarians here, but you could make a meal out of sides. Overall, the atmosphere is comfortable and the food is tasty, but I'm not sure if it's completely worth it (mostly that's the fries talking) and it will likely be a long time before I come back. However, I am going to try out Rinconcito Sudamericano since it seems like the cheaper version of this place and with far less swank.",0.9312,0.906,0.06,0.034,0.4882078853046595
