2017-08-17,2.0,"Was hopeful about this place as it was right around the corner from me. Ordered the brisket sandwich, upgraded to Mac for a dollar for my side. The meat itself was decent, however there was mayo and grilled onions on my sandwich... I've never seen that before. I had to scrape around to find any meat that hadn't been touched by mayo. The Mac flavor was okay, the texture spot on. they used penne noodles which I thought was odd? Too big for a little container. The coleslaw was good.  The kicker is, prices here are already higher than most (aka Smoque, which doesn't charge you anything to change out your side and you get a whole sandwich for 12 bucks rather than just a half) they somehow charged me two extra dollars! The subtotal rang up for 2 more dollars than it should have. I didn't notice until a couple days later but thought that was really, really bizzare.. Maybe a little sketchy.  Smoque has been my go-to for years but the location isn't the most convenient. Big mistake to break my loyalty. Don't think I'll be back here.",0.6182,0.91,0.056,0.034,0.3483709273182957

As the sides I got the corn bread (because you're missing out if you don't) and the mac and cheese (it was fine, I'm realizing I'm not huge into mac and cheese).  My friend got an identical plate but she got the sweet potato tots with parmesan dip, and it was tasty. Don't really need a lot of them to enjoy them but again, enough of a portion to share with your friends.  Our table of six ended up splitting the brownie, which comes in a little cast iron skillet and is topped with a mountain of whipped cream and a scoop of ice cream. It was fine to share after such a huge meal, but if you're just coming for dessert, I'd say split it between two people. It took a while to come out but I think that's unusual because the waiter seemed to realize it was taking a while. Service is great, too.

Also I ordered the coconut pie and it was left out of the bag and had to wait for the delivery person to come back.

I ordered the Jalapeño Corn Fritters as an appetizer and the Crusted Catfish with sides of coleslaw and greens. The Corn Fritters were really good. It did taste like they needed to change the oil to the fryer. If that's not how they prepare them, that's the flavor they had. Overall they were good. Slap some bbq sauce on and it was ok. The catfish had the same oil flavor, but they provided the best garlic sauce in life. Slap some garlic sauce on the catfish and you don't even taste the oil flavor. The greens was one of the better tasting greens I've had. The coleslaw... oh boy! I thought it tasted like a marker! (What a marker smells like people) I had my date try it. He said it tasted like an eraser, tried it again, and no, decided it tasted like what an entire pencil smells like. Overall the food was ok, I guess. Here's what bothered me.

So fresh and soft on the inside.  Generous portion too! They also included 2 containers of extra BBQ with my order free of charge. This was much appreciated bc I like my ribs saucy! My eyes were bigger than my stomach however and I could only finish half of the slab because it was so hugggggge! I swear it was as long as my arm- they do not skimp! The other half slab made delicious leftovers too! They are a tad pricey ($30 for a full slab) but it is well worth it and comes with sides.

The decor/space at Fat Willy's is more highbrow than most of the ""rib shacks"" I have hit over the years, and the prices match up with that...a bit more expensive than, say, Smoque or Rub's Backcountry Smokehouse, for sure, but tables and service that is a little more price-appropriate. Hit this place on a Tuesday so that you can finish dinner and roll across the street to see a movie on the cheap at the Regal ($7 on Tuesdays).  A hidden-in-plain-sight treasure!",0.9573,0.874,0.109,0.017,0.5430555555555555

I definitely preferred the Texas toast over the cornbread. Collard Greens were ok. I did enjoy the homemade lemonade. I really wanted to try things other than the baby back ribs and was hoping that I could possibly order a second protein ala carte but the only way to order the main proteins was by ordering a whole meal which was very impractical.

2016-06-25,1.0,"So my partner and I planned on going to grab a cask ale at Owen & Engine and then scootch on over to a BBQ joint for dinner. We're new to the area, just moved in, and looking for a new BBQ spot to call our own. Owen and Engine tends to be pretty expensive for pub food so we decided not to stick around despite the appetizing stuff. Now Fat Willy's is literally the next place down from where we were drinking. We were perplexed by the lack of decent graphic design on the Fat Willy's logo and perhaps it's hole-in-the-wall-esque vibe so we jumped in expecting some great barbeque, especially after great yelp reviews raving about the place. That's when things took a nosedive. Look, the service here is wonderful, and the people who took care of us were excellent. This isn't about them, this is about the food, and it's one of the worst BBQ joints I've ever had the displeasure of enduring. Let's start with atmosphere. We came by in the summer heat and there is no air conditioning indoors. The beer is served in bottles and they don't have a tap so you'll end up essentially paying nearly the price of a six pack for a single bottled beer, a beer you could've brought yourself from a liquor store down the street and saved some serious change. Not to mention the joint next door has some of the best beer you can get around this area on tap or on cask. The food at Fat Willy's is priced awfully high for it's atmosphere. $14 for a starter plate of mac, $20 for a half rack of ribs and $30 for a full rack. Now the only time in the summer I find that a place with no air conditioning can get by on it's food is if the food is absolutely to DIE for. I'm wearing a button-down t-shirt and jeans and I'm going to sweat. It better be good. I ordered the half rack of ribs with a side of steak fries and mac (which was a dollar extra). The half rack of ribs wasn't just undercooked but it was just loaded with sauce. Nothing seemed to be taken into account as far as flavour or texture was concerned when it came to the meat. It was a mess of sauce, like a fifth grader's first rack of ribs: chewy, puddled in department store BBQ sauce, and without any notes of a dry-rub prep. The fries were essentially large and plain, nothing unique or seasoned about them, and while the mac and cheese was delicious, it's served in a tiny cupcake platter, a serving size too small to enjoy. Where was my extra $1 going for that mac? Not to mention, the already tiny serving essentially has three mac and cheese noodles in it, because they chose to use penne instead of an elbow or a shell. I would've rather had reasonably sized mac than a giant serving of fries and a tiny mac. It also came with a side of texas toast, which was missing the texas and somehow also, the toast. The bread wasn't spiced right or even toasty in texture it was underdone somehow. If you're doing texas toast, add some butter or toast it right, but don't under-toast my bread and leave me unsatisfied. The spicy barbeque sauce that came on the side happened to be much better than the sauce on the barbecue that was on the ribs, but because the ribs were covered in sauce (without a dry rub pre-cook, mind you) I would've had to wipe the ribs off, re-spice them myself and then add the barbeque sauce to have even enjoyed myself. My partner had the brisket. She had two bites and pushed her plate away. We've been together two years and I've never seen her not finish food before. The brisket was dry. Dry BRISKET. Have you ever heard of such a thing? I grew up in the south, mama would've never served brisket like that. At this point, I'm wondering to myself, three bones in, why not just go out to the market, pick up a crock pot on sale, grab three racks of ribs for $20 and some decent spices, the most expensive barbeque sauce I can get and just dig in? I'd come out cheaper than this place and have better leftovers! I'm not usually such a stickler about money but man, I've even had better experiences with BBQ at an Outback Steakhouse! If the place literally right next door to yours has better food at a better price and air conditioning and speciality beer yet you can't compare, why even exist? If I'm going to pay for junk food, why punish me with terrible, soggy, undercooked food? Needless to say I won't be coming back. Trust your instincts. Bad graphic design = bad food. I was wondering where that extra $1 went with my mac, must've been to the entire bottle of ketchup they used in that barbeque sauce.",0.9799,0.873,0.077,0.05,0.5352651052651053

About two years ago the price was $16, which was ridiculous for what you got, but now the $19 price makes it a shame. My mother laughed when she saw what I had, and said it wasn't worth even $5.

I realize the place has ribs in the title but I go for brisket. A good brisket is the staple of a bbq plane in my opinion.  I went for the brisket dinner at a very steep $19. I went for the Mac and cheese which was an extra dollar and the beans as my other side. Baked beans are another bbq joint staple that I use to judge a place.  I'll start with the good. The brisket:  meat was super tender and well prepared. I took a star away due to the grease that was floating under the meat on the plate. It wasn't appetizing. I also don't understand why the meat came with a pile of caramelized onions on top. It didn't need it. It also came with a side of juice and horseradish sauce. Again- not needed. If the meat and the sauce are good, no need for the juice or horseradish sauce.  The beans were too sweet and didn't have any interest. There weren't any chunks of meat and they tasted like they didn't have much seasoning.  I always look forward to a good Mac and cheese. Another star down for this. It cost an extra dollar but came in a tiny foil dish. Maybe 3-4 ounces at the most. I didn't finish it because it wasn't good. It's like the pasta needed salt or the rue needed some additional seasoning. It was bland. :( Overall, it could be so much better.

But service was slow, like a 35 minute wait for our dinners while the table for two next to us ordered just after and had almost finished before we even got ours. Perhaps the delay was due to a mix-up by the waitress 20 minutes into our wait, who said she didn't realize they were out of the brisket. Ok, just give me the chicken. The medium rack of spare ribs for my son was awful, barely any meat. We showed the waitress and said, there's simply nothing here. Maybe a bad rack of ribs. She apologized and asked if there was anything she could do. Well, we're about done eating what we had, so no, not really. The chicken was average at best, a bit dried out on the white meat. Sides were so so, although a really bitter collard green dish was inedible. My wife liked her mixed salad. The bill came after another long wait with the more expensive brisket on it, which I pointed out. Now this is what separates the good restaurants from others. The ribs were still on the bill for $20. She could've lowered the bill, or taken it off, but didn't. I could've asked for it, but good restaurants don't make the customer ask, they just know. In the end, the bill was $88 for three meals.

My boyfriend got the ribs with Texas toast and fries and I got the pulled pork with mac & cheese and corn bread. Delivery time was good considering its a Friday night. It took about an hour to get here. The first thing we noticed was a bag of grease separate, thank god separate, from everything else. It was the pulled pork which was in its own container wrapped in a plastic bag but because it was just thrown in there unceremoniously it leaked grease and oil everywhere. See attached pictures. The food itself wasn't terrible but it was also not at all worth the $20 a plate it cost. A lot of it was bland, the ribs where good in smoke and flavor but the meat was tough. The pulled pork was just oil and no flavor. The mac & cheese would've been good if it had been freshly made because the flavor was good, but it was obvious that it was cooked a LONG time ago so everything was congeled and the ""melted"" cheese on top had completely hardened again. Also, they charged a dollar extra for the m&c and I have no idea why because it was a TINY portion. If you're gonna charge me a dollar on top of the $20 the plate already costs we were expecting a good sized portion. Other than the m&c the portions are good.

2015-07-23,2.0,"I want to assure you that my Texas BBQ bias is not why I'm writing this. The service and the food was not great. I should never leave a restaurant feeling ripped off. Typically when I go to a BBQ place for the first time I try and get a little bit of everything on the menu and get a real taste for how the menu shakes out. Fat Willies has on their menu something to the affect of we aren't going to be the best BBQ for everyone, because everyone has an opinion on BBQ. Or like the expression, Opinions are like belly buttons and buttholes, everyone has one. So I'm going to stay away from the whole taste aspect and focus on the poor execution of food in general. That really isn't opinion, its fact. For example... your food should be fresh. That's not really an opinion, that is the way anyone who serves food should operate. For instance when I say your brisket and pulled pork was really really dry and inedible. Its not an opinion on your cooking methods or smoke time. Its the fact that you shouldn't cook it  and shred it10 hours earlier and wait for people to buy it while it stays in the same tub losing moisture and drying out. Or possible the waiter who was too busy on his smoke breaks to remember his one table needed drinks, while the finished order was getting cold in the order counter. So far service and the Brisket are thumbs down. Pulled Pork thumbs down, Chicken.. Pretty good. Probably would have been better if it were fresher. The saving grace was probably the spare ribs. I did like those. Back to facts and not opinions. The waiter should have informed me that the $6 dollar corndog appetizer is overpriced by 5 dollars. First of all I expected it to be more than 1 corn dog for 6 dollars and if it is one corndog, at least a foot long. I mean it is an appetizer, appetizers are usually for more than one person. Last a checked 1 normal corndog is usually good for 1 person. It says hand battered, special batter, blah blah blah.... I know what a freshly battered corn dogs taste like. you can get them at any fair for 6 dollars and its a foot long. The one characteristics that all freshly hand battered and fried corndogs have... a crunch. This did not have any crunch to it whatsoever, it was also room temperature. This leads me to believe the following. It was not fresh. A possibility given the rest of the food. 2, it was not hand made., 3. it was microwaved. or 4 and more likely they just have no integrity when it comes to corndogs. Who knows... news flash. you're in Chicago a foodie city. if you're going to make a corndog ""from scratch"" try using your own meat from a local supplier. I'm sure someone can make a ""sausage"" for you. 2. Make it beef or pork. Don't use weenies... those are for kids. Try actually using a local beer to make the batter and if you do make sure its a unique flavor, hell even come up with your own sauce for it. just saying.

2015-06-19,4.0,"I've been here twice and this place gets 4 starts because the service is good, the food is good enough, and it's something to do before a movie. During my most recent visit, I got to the Regal theater really early and wanted to come here for a couple drinks and read my book before my two friends got there for dinner. They don't seat you until at least half of your party is there which is hardly fair since there is no such thing as one and a half people - I would have had two or three beers in the time it took my friends to get there (just under one hour) and nobody was coming in to eat...there was certainly space for a lonely girl who wanted to read and drink beer. In any case, I suggest if this happens to you, just pretend you're alone and act surprised when your friends show up...OR don't show up two hours early for a movie if you want a beer before your friends finally show up.  The first time I came here, I got the Catfish Po Boy. I definitely think it's worth trying, but it wasn't my personal favorite (compared to all other po boys in life).  This time I had the trio of BBQ sliders (pulled chicken, pulled pork, beef brisket) and it was really damn good. They bring you 2 different BBQ sauces so I could try whatever I wanted in each bite. It's a perfect not-as-heavy meal! I love their green onion corn bread with honey butter - it's a huge slice of pie (read: bread) and the honey butter just makes it all the better. If someone says they will share one with you, don't do it because I promise you that you want your own.  My friend got the chicken and adnouille sausage gumbo which I tried and it was very good. That and the chili are great smaller meals as well.  Still a little sore about not being able to be one and a half persons, but will definitely come here for a quick dinner and drinks before movies!",0.9928,0.755,0.185,0.06,0.558164924506388

Ended up being a great lunch.  Started with the poutine.  I've had it a couple of times at other places and not a big fan.  This was incredible.  While I found it normally soggy fries with gravy, here the cheese was fantastic and the combination of smoked meats incorporated into the poutine made it a really tasty dish.  Although we ate a ton of it and it filled us up, it was not heavy and did not make us feel gross.  In fact, it was so good and filling would of been happy ending the meal with it. Luckily I did not.  Also had the brisket dinner.  It was a large plate of sliced biscuit, nice flavor but what made it great was a very healthy serving of sautéed onions on it as well as two accompanying sauces, a horseradish and a brisket equivalent of au jus.  There were also multiple BBQ sauces on the table for those who prefer that but I did not try them, focused on the horseradish. For sides, had cucumber soaked in vinegar, which I loved and beans.  The beans were more interesting than typical baked beans, different types of beans, but I have to admit I prefer the ""Bush"" baked beans style.

Fat Willy's is one of those in-between BBQ joints. I ordered the Baby Back dinner with a trio of BBQ sliders. The sides I chose were Texas toast and sweet potato tots.  Delivery was surprisingly fast, I ordered at a time when I thought they might be real busy, but they were at my door in about 20-25 minutes. Opening my treats was fun because everything was packed neatly and even the sauce wasn't spilling everywhere which was great. One thing I can say about the appearance of everything is that it looks fantastic, definitely some high-class BBQ here. They gave me some blue cheese sauce along with 4 small cups of their homemade BBQ sauce. The BBQ sauce has bits of meat mixed in for added taste. Taste testing the sauces beforehand they honestly weren't that good, especially the blue cheese sauce which had a chalky texture and taste to it.  Digging into my main course, the ribs was an experience. The ribs themselves were perfectly cooked and nearly fell off the bone! It was coated in enough sauce saw that it wasn't a mess eating them yet you could still taste it which is a plus. The meat you could tell wasn't marinated or anything, just cooked straight, but still came out great. The sliders were excellent as well and were a great way for me to try out all the different meats (they had loads on meat and cheese on them too) without paying a huge amount to try them all individually. Overall this is a pretty good BBQ joint. Their house sauces definitely need some work, but the meat is good quality and cooked perfectly.

2014-08-06,4.0,"A birthday bash with a group of 11 and we somehow managed to get a table without a wait on a Saturday at 7:30pm! This sets the tone for an awesome dinner.  As a group, we shared a full slab of baby back ribs and a full slab of spare ribs. What's the difference? Baby back ribs are taken from the top of the rib cage whereas spare ribs are taken from the belly within the rib cage. Hence, spare ribs are longer and contain more fat. The full slabs arrive uncut, so be prepared to work out those arms because it takes a bit of effort and time to slice them up for sharing. The ribs were highly enjoyable but if we had to choose, our favorite of the two would be the spare ribs. We like that extra fat clinging to the bones. Our sides were collard greens, mac and cheese, green onion and cheddar corn bread, and Texas toast. The latter two (carbs) were very ideal for sauce sopping.  They ran out of beef brisket for the family dinners, but I had to have my share of beef brisket while I was there. So I ordered a full beef brisket sandwich and split it with a friend. For $8, it was a very generous portion and perfect for sharing. But, I'm not sure if I made the right choice. Perhaps, they use a different cut for sandwiches because the meat was extremely dry and tough. Dunking it in barbecue sauce helped the cause though.   In addition, we also shared a pitcher of hogarita which is the house margarita. It came in a flowery, vase-looking pitcher with little jars on the side for drinking. The pitcher contained mostly of ice, making it difficult to pour from the pitcher and not quite enough for sharing until we waited for the ice to melt. All in all, food was wonderful and didn't cause a lot of damage to our wallets. It was approximately $30 per person. Parking was also relatively easy if you don't mind the slight walk.

Oh, brisket. I wish you were prepared with a little more TLC. Partially because I recently moved from Texas, so I had very high hopes here, but generally this was below average brisket in my opinion.

While Smoque is probably nearest and dearest to my heart, Smoque does not deliver, and Fat Willy's is walking distance (albeit a long walk) from my place. I'm a big fan of all the side options at FW. In my opinion, often it's the sides that can make or break a barbecue joint, and everything I've tried has been delicious.  There's almost an overabundance of side options at FW, but I happily struggle with the indecision. My favorites are the mac and cheese (so rich and creamy), cornbread (perfect texture), mashed potatoes and gravy, but especially the onion rings (not really a side, as they're considered an appetizer). The onion rings are things of beauty. Large in diameter, but not too big, just the right amount of breading (they use a beer batter), and wonderfully crispy. They're served with a parmesan buttermilk dressing, but I just dunk 'em in bbq sauce. Meats are all fantastic. The ribs are tender, but the meat does not fall off the bone, which I highly appreciate. I want to work for it a bit. The chicken is moist with a crispy skin. The brisket is good too, but I concede that Smoque's brisket is superior. I've not been disappointed with anything I've had at Fat Willy's. Service is efficient. I mostly do carry-out, and they've got it down to a science. The food is always ready when they say it'll be, and it's always packaged appropriately. They even poke tiny holes in the box so the onion rings stay crisp, and don't steam and get soggy. It may sound trivial, but most places don't do that.

2013-11-29,4.0,"My first job was working in a rib shack in Oklahoma. I had to learn all the cuts, the best temps, secret rub recipes, and how to actually make coleslaw - so when I talk BBQ, you can take it to the bank.  Good - real good. I feel like you can't trust Mexican restaurants until you take it back to basics and try a taco. Same goes for BBQ. If you can't do ribs right you can bet I'm not going anywhere near your pulled pork.  The smoke was perfect, just kissing the meat, not overpowering at all. They fell off the bone just the right amount - heads up: if it falls off the bone like a Jack fell off the door in Titanic, it was cooked for too long. All in all, the ribs were really nicely done.  I'm a big believer in meat shouldn't have to have sauce to make it good. Sauce should be the Robin to ribs Batman. Robin should add to the adventure, but we all know that Batman could kick the living crap out of the Joker without him. That's how this sauce was. It was good, but because the meat was so kickin' you didn't have to have it.  This place would get five stars if not for two things: sides & their bar. I know it's so hard to get a liquor license in this city, so once you do, why not have a bar? I had a great drink that was well mixed and nicely put together...and I stood at the cash register to get it. Atmosphere would have been perfect if I could have bellied up.  I know that I'm being picky, but sides make a meal. No self respecting rib shack in Oklahoma would be caught dead without friend okra. The greens were great and the coleslaw was really good. But no okra? Broke my little slow cooked heart. Really such a great place despite my picky taste.

He made suggestions such as having 2 of us split a full order of the pulled pork sandwich instead of order two halves. He also suggested we just add on a soup for $2 for a friend who wanted soup instead of getting a whole order of soup. Overall  - the service was superb and dinner was even more superb! Mac & Cheese- to dieee for! If you like garlic, you'll love these mac and cheese. Super garlic and cheesy! Baby back ribs- the most tender, soft and juiciest ribs I've had in the longest time.

As for the rib tips, they were a little fattier than I'd like them to be, but I guess that's typical for rib tips. The fries were unbelievable and the portion was enough for two people for two meals.

We  finally got around to trying the ""Shack"" after running 10 miles and finishing an intense spinning class on Saturday afternoon.We worked up a major appetite, so we started with the trio of BBQ sliders (chicken, beef and pork on mini-fresh brioche buns). It was an explosion of remarkable smokey flavors which were incredibly astounding. We enjoyed an order of Beef Brisket Poutine (plenty to share with someone). OMG, stupendous! What is Poutine? Poutine is a French-Canadian concoction of unabashedly savory collage of french-fried potatoes, beef gravy, bacon and squeaky-fresh cheese curds; it's perhaps the ultimate guilty pleasure! I'll have to work out extra at the gym tomorrow. My niece ordered the Baked four-cheese mac and said it was ""ethereal.""  The beef brisket and pull-pork sandwiches were ubiquitous, so we had to give these a try, and WOW, we devoured these mother suckers.  They were super tender, delectable and filled with incredible smokey flavor. For three of us, between the appetizers and our sandwiches, not including beverages, we spent $57 (tip not included). I am not going to compare this restaurant to other BBQ joints that I have eaten at, because I don't believe it is fair to do so.  I would grade the service as a solid ""B"" and the food a ""B+"" -- parking can be challenging (lots of ""Permit Parking"" only in this area of the city).

I totally understand why people would want a platter of meat placed in front of them, but there's something about meat, on bread, with slaw, and BBQ sauce, that I cannot resist. And Fat Willy's does a BBQ sandwich just right. Came in on a Thursday night around 6:15 and waited about ten minutes for a table on their patio. The patio is pretty small, but very cozy, and made for an excellent dining experience. I started with an Arnold Palmer with vodka that was pretty tasty and reasonably priced. For dinner, the boyfriend and I shared a pulled pork sandwich and brisket sandwich. If I had been ordering for myself, the small size would have been perfect. However, the boyfriend insisted on two large sandwiches and they were HUGE. They give you the option to have jardiniere on the side...why is this not BBQ protocol?! It was amazing. Totally complimented the flavor of the meat and added to the sandwich. Additionally, Fat Willy's serves their sandwiches on thick French rolls that help the whole thing not fall apart. Again, why is this not BBQ sandwich protocol? A brisket girl myself, I have to say Willy's pork won my heart as the brisket was more shredded than sliced. It was still delicious, but the pork is just outstanding.  I was also a huge fan of the mac n cheese we ordered for a side, although the portion isn't large if that's what you're looking for. The green onion cornbread was delicious as well and had a very unique flavor. The slaw wasn't too mayo-y which made me happy and both sauces on the table were very flavorful.

Their menu was short, but I still had a hard time deciding between 4 meals--always a good sign in my opinion! The pitcher of premium margaritas was tasty--though definitely from a mix; be careful with the pitcher though...it's decorative and they give you a ladle for divvying up the drinks--not necessarily a good thing once you get to the third or fourth drink!  We'll definitely be going back to try some other menu items that caught our eye. The place is also right next door to a multiscreen theater, so dinner and a movie wouldn't be out of the question...especially since parking in the theater garage is only $2, and the neighborhood is posted as parking with sticker only (which would make it hard to find parking sometimes I'm guessing).",0.9929,0.783,0.196,0.021,0.5450410509031198

2013-08-26,5.0,"I went with the medium spare rib dinner.  For those not in the know, spare ribs are the same meat as when you order rib tips.  They tend to have more of a bark and a bit more fat than baby backs or St. Louis ribs.  I'm a grown man with a healthy appetite and the medium dinner was enough that I was full by the end.  Anyway, these spare ribs were so meaty I couldn't even see where to cut them apart.  They had a nice thin bark and a bit of caramelization without being the slightest bit burnt.  The meat had a nice red hue from smoking.  The flavor was the best I've ever tasted, and that's coming from a barbecue junkie who has bought BBQ sauce by the case.  I'm not one to say meat is so good it doesn't even need sauce, but I'm saying it here.  How good were these ribs?  After getting home I breathed into my hand to smell them again and didn't even want to brush my teeth! There are three sauces to choose from.  Regular is dark and thick, hot is a bit lighter in color and has a kick without setting your mouth on fire.  The third is vinegar based and very watery in texture, not my favorite. The dinner came with Texas toast and two sides.  I got the steak fries, which were thick, unsalted and perfectly done, and the cornbread, which was perfect if redundant when I already unwittingly got toast.  Portions were a good size contrary to what I've read in other reviews. With tax and tip I ended up spending about $22, and it was worth every penny.  I love Smoque, but if the rest of the menu is this good I think I've found a new favorite barbecue place.",0.9907,0.809,0.149,0.041,0.5478583916083916

There was less brisket back then so maybe they paid more attention to it.Now that they got rid of the rib tips there is more room for brisket and you can get it anytime however, in doing this they sacrificed quality and honor.

Mac and Cheese - I have found myself becoming a mac and cheese snob of late, look at me and my fancy palattte.  Most are not very creamy or the cheese isn't sharp enough or salty enough or something... for a baked mac and cheese, this was the bomb.  Sharp and creamy and crispy on top, yes.  Trio of Sliders - how better to try three types of meat?  Pulled chicken was my hands down fave... the spicy sauce on top is the bomb and I didn't even want to put any bbq on it to ruin it.  The brisket was good, tender and flavorful, this was the only one I finished at the table.  Pulled pork was good, on the dry/crispy side since it's served without BBQ.  I'm not sure how I feel about that, I know they let you pick your bbq sauce but pouring some on top feels weird. Collard Greens - mushy.  I make better with bacon at home. Mashed Potatoes - kind of like cafeteria mashed potatoes that take on that odd taste that is no longer really potato like?  again, I think I make better at home. $6 margaritas on Mondays doesn't hurt either.  Good service, casual ambiance.  If any of those vintage egg beaters on the back wall go missing, don't look at me...",0.9954,0.71,0.214,0.076,0.5045580808080808

Now, let me say that Fat Willy's is still very good and on the whole, quality BBQ. But, it's just insanely variable. I ordered a bunch from here for a get together at my place and I had been talking it up for two weeks.  We covered the general spectrum from here as we did the mac n cheese, chili, brisket dinner, and then just the meat of pulled chicken and a large order of baby back ribs.  I will say that the mac n cheese was off the hook and exceeded my memories of it. Hands down, this is some of the best mac n cheese that I've had. Unfortunately, Mac N Cheese does not BBQ make. The brisket was the contrast as it was brutally dry. Sadly, you want your brisket not to be this dry and more weight goes to the brisket, boo. The ribs did pull straight off the bone and were very solid (though still on the drier side), while the pulled chicken was very good.  Basically the quality was all over the place and it made me sad.

Don't judge. The onion rings were amazing. Probably the best onion rings I've ever had. They are accompanied by a buttermilk parmesean dressing and mustard bbq sauce.

So, we ended up at Fat Willy's. First off, the service was excellent.  We got water and soft drinks extremely quick, she put up with a lot of questions and indecisiveness, and she only got a little defensive when I started reading Foursquare reviews that said ""go to smoque instead for ribs"" (my brother was thinking about having the ribs but wanted to know if they were good.) As for the food, I had the Beef Brisket.  I asked our waitress what was most popular among the regulars, and that's what she said, so that's what I had. The food was definitely tasty, but I don't think I'd become a regular just for the Brisket.  As for the sauces (it is a BBQ joint after), they were decent.  It came with two types of sauce, one spicy, one not spicy.  I preferred the spicy one, but it wasn't too hot.  Overall I thought the sauce was slightly above average, but nothing ""Travel Channel worthy"", or anything I'd drive into the city from the 'burbs for. The portions were definitely adequate.  We were there for lunch, but I had a dinner portion (it was my birthday afterall).  Fries were tasty, and I recommend putting the spicy sauce on them.  I think it was a vinegar based sauce, so that probably explains why I liked them on the fries so much. Besides that, my dad had the same thing as me, but the lunch portion (which came with two sides - he said the BBQ beans were pretty good), and my brother, who used to live in New Orleans had the gumbo.  Normally my brother ""poo-poos"" Cajun food up here, but he said the gumbo was pretty good. Overall, I'd say I'd eat it if I was in the area, but it's not really worth going out of your way for.  I think there's probably better BBQ in Chicago, and I'll definitely let you know when I find it.",0.9917,0.865,0.118,0.017,0.5413833851333851

It also came with no sauce, those were a buck each for 1 ounce cups. The mac and cheese, which also didn't weigh a pound was really expensive at 11 a pound. They also charged me 2.50 for a ""roll"" that turned out to be a stale torpedo bun. We also ordered coleslaw and baked beans, which were just as overpriced for meager portions. The kicker was that nothing was really good. Over hickory smoked and greasy pork, bland slaw and beans, and garlicky mac and cheese with greasy cheddar clumps.

2012-06-29,1.0,"Fat Willy's, what have you done?   I have been a FW patron for over 5yrs and seriously only got 2 delicious platters, the ribs and the hot link dinner.   Last I was dining here was about a year ago with my now husband.  He got the pulled pork sandwich and I, yes, got the hot link dinner with my 2 sides and Texas toast!  YUMMY!  You can't imagine how my mouth was watering on my drive from the burbs to Chicago to those hot links.... And here is where the disappointment starts. Yes, I know Fat Willy's made it to the wildly popular Check Please! and yes, I was aware that it has gotten a lot more patron traffic since being featured on same (as Check Please will do)....what I wasn't expecting was the complete shock we got when we arrived. First, they have definitely jammed a few more tables into this already small dining area inside then a year ago.  So if you are one of those people who have a hard time dining about 15"" from the party next to you...be prepared. Second, the woman who I believe is either the general manager or owner was solely responsible for seating people.  She walked around with her nose in her clipboard obviously plotting how she can fit more people in this restaurant.  Never once did she welcome us to the restaurant, look at us in the eye or the general direction of our faces or worse yet, tell us to enjoy our meal. Third, our waiter was nice but a little over the top...almost like he was prepping us for the experience to come. So, I look at the menu and what???  Where's the rest of it??  If you are a long time patron of Willy's you know EXACTLY what I am saying.  Please know they have removed so many items from the menu and wouldn't you know it, they removed my hot link dinner.  However, they still serve a hot link sandwich so how hard can it be to accommodate an old frequent flyer if you still have the hot links available???  Our server asked Ms. Boss Lady and she flat out refused.  Guess I'm going to try something new tonight. I ordered (as did my husband) the brisket dinner.  Usually, we have never ordered this in the past because we either got there too early and it wasn't done or we arrived to late and it was already gone.  Either way, it was horrible.  Actually, it was disgusting.  I have professional culinary school training and there are basic food serving rules that are common sense to even a common diner. The brisket came cut up on a plate and was completely colorless.  Let me clarify....if you have been told in the past that the brisket is not available because it is still ""smoking"",  one can reasonably assume that they are making some authentic smoked bbq brisket.  Brisket that has the outside fat layer charred to a nice bark and that wonderful telltale red outline of a good smoked meat.   Nope, not what we received on our plates.  I was looking at boiled meat.  Okay, think I'm being harsh??  I gave it a chance and dived right into that brisket and with my first mouthful, I almost gagged.  Confirmed, BOILED BRISKET with bay leaves. You ask, how do you know it was boiled with bay leaves??  Well, basically because I had a mouthful of dried, sharp-edged broken bay leaf in my mouth.  With almost every bite...which was only about 3 at this point and in my opinion 3 too many.  I spent the rest of my dining experience watching my poor 6'3"" Slovak husband stomaching his brisket because he was starving and randomly picking the bay leaves out of my brisket and piling it in a corner of my plate.  It is standard practice in any restaurant that you DO NOT place anything on the plate that isn't edible...especially boiled hard broken bay leaves with white fatty bland brisket.   The server asked me if I wanted a ""to go"" container...I told him no because if I want bay leaves I can eat the ones in my pantry at home.  What was even more discouraging was that the server didn't even question WHY a customer would leave a full plate of their most expensive item and not take it home.  Why would any food establishment do this? GREED.  Think I'm too harsh again??  Also know that while I was picking the bay leaves out of my white boiled meat and piling it in the corner of my plate, I watched Ms. Boss Lady walk back and forth through the dining room numerous times with her nose in that clipboard wondering how many tables she can turn over for the most money that day....in this economy, establishments should be doing whatever they can to make sure patrons that are coming to their establishment to spend money are PLEASED with their experience. So, note to owner/general manager at Fat Willy's if you actually read your Yelp reviews....  I paid $70 for 2 brisket meals that were inedible and flavorless... know that I will never return to your establishment again and if you read your reviews, so are quite a few of your other past customers.",-0.9396,0.857,0.068,0.075,0.4772081529581531

I was so disappointed from the hair in my mashed potatoes and gravy, the grimy plastic dishes covered in finger prints and crud under the rim, the dried out aluminum 4 oz ramekin side of mac n cheese (which is a 1$ up charge), and super sugary coleslaw. The coleslaw reminded me of the coleslaw you get at a cheap convenient store deli. Think gummy sweet dressing and bagged cabbage /carrot mix. No red or purple cabbage for color or no hint of sweet onion. The dressing was disgusting. Actually it was ghetto disgusting, like it was scooped out of a store bought container and slopped on my plate. the mac n cheese was served in a 4oz aluminum ramekin with a layer of margarine soaked bread crumbs on top of the dried out mac n cheese. Fat willies should be ashamed to call that mac and cheese. Oh the ribs.... let's get to the ribs. The ribs are not smokey AT ALL. For $30 on just food (I spent another 30$ on drinks) I left kind of mad. I waned ribs. These ribs were the boiled kind that fall off the bone and served with so much sauce on them that it's pointless to even attempt trying the bbq sauce flavors that are on the table.

As for their entrees Fat Willys BBQ in comparison to other BBQ places in Chicago does not stand a chance. Their scrumptious meat in its semi spicy bbq sauce ( which is actually considered their regular sauce) is tasty but If you have a favorite BBQ place stick to it this will not satisfy. No, here you have to try the poutine and skillet brownie. Poutine is of French Canadian origin so to see it here in Chicago is quite exciting. It consists of French fries, cheese curds (which melt on top of your warm delicious French fries)and then is smothered in gravy. Depending on where you go poutine will have extra toppings. Fat willy's does it with big chunks of bacon and their in house tender brisket. A combination thats mouth watering. Then their skillet brownie left me speechless. Everyone's had a brownie with some ice cream and some whip cream and some nuts but the way they are doing it here needs to be recognized. The brownie takes some time to prepare so it's best that you order it before you finish your appetizer or entree. When it's ready they bring it to you in a small skillet where the brownie is warm, topped off with a mountain peak of whip cream and then drizzled in caramel and covered with nuts. Fun surprise, underneath that mountain of whip cream...is ice cream. This dessert is awesome and incredibly delicious If you try this and do not like it you can blame me, but you have  to go to Fat Willys and have this dessert.

For sides, we had the mac n cheese (which was rich and cheesy and outstanding!), the sweet potato- which came with a sugar butter that was sooo good- the whipped mashed potatoes- also really good and the collard greens, which were just meh.  The ribs weren't too dry and weren't too fatty. They had the perfect consistency, though I did need to add some extra sauce. The sauce is a little more thick than I prefer, but it was still A-OK. For two dinners, we paid around just under 40 bones, which can be expensive, but I felt like there was a lot of food, and BBQ takes time and talent, so I didn't feel cheated. We were quoted 20 minutes and our food was ready when we got there and still hot by the time we got home, so it wasn't sitting out too long.  All in all, a much better experience, and I would definitely return during rain or snow when BBQing at home is not preferred.",0.9939,0.81,0.184,0.006,0.5256410256410257

It's the perfect BBQ joint.  The food arrives quickly by conscientious staff, but is cooked slowly by talented chefs.  No matter the protein, it melts in your mouth.  Sauces sting the lips.  Liquid crack.  I'm always asking the server to refill our dispensers and squirt bottles.  Since I can't decide which of their BBQ sauces I like best, so I usually go for the ""combo squirt"" -- some of the regular sauce, some of the (not so) spicy, and some of the vinegar BBQ.  Don't fret on the sides.  One's as passable as the next.  They play second fiddle to the protein stars.

I was told that I could get the link sandwich which only comes with 1 link as compared to the old one that comes 4. I could get more links now but I have to pay $4 for each extra link. This is crap.

My wife wanted her salad and that was one of the good things about this place is that even if you don't like BBQ they have great salads. Well not anymore. Now they only have 2 and they aren't good healthy options well one of them is. So the platters are now smaller and the food is more money. I can't even begin to tell you how disappointed I am.

HELLO!) and added NOTHING remotely interesting OR relevant to a supposed bbq menu. not to mention the change in staff - of course, all restaurants have turnover, but we ordered pick-up and went so often before/after movies that we got to know names and faces. there are still a couple absolutely lovely waitresses - one with short hair who's sweet as pie, and a punk rock-looking petite blond - but the hostess and tall waitress with glasses need an attitude check. they and a tall male waiter stood up front talking about customers, what the fuck? then the girl with the glasses was reprimanded by a shrill woman - maybe a manager? - and was obnoxiously loud and defensive. as someone who worked in food service before, i'm pretty patient and understanding, but those four were infuckingtolerable. between the HORRIBLE menu change and snotty new staff, they've lost the business of a pretty large group of us.

The BBLT was one of the best things on the menu, along with the hot link basket. Prices seem to have gone up as well, but that might just be a result of pulling all of the ""basket"" options off of the menu. One of my favorite things about Fat Willy's was their Parmesan Garlic salad dressing, when I ordered a side salad on my last visit, the waitress informed me that it was going to be ""creamier"" than it used to be. I'm assume this was code for watered down and not as good. The old dressing used to have so much Parmesan in the dressing, that you could feel the texture of it, now it's just a liquid-y, mediocre dressing. Honestly, this used to be one of my favorite places in the city, my go to restaurant when I couldn't make up my mind. Not so much anymore. Is it because Owen and Engine is doing so well next door?

My taste in barbecue is informed by my dad's expertise smoking all sorts of meats (he makes great ribs and a mean pulled pork), and eating countless barbecue sandwiches in Eastern Tennessee (where they are generally a slightly less vinegary version of Carolina 'que). I'm also a fan of Memphis style barbecue. Much like the pulled pork sandwich I had my first time, the pulled chicken plate I had was really lacking flavor. In particular, there was, at best, a hint of smoke flavor. And whatever else they are doing with the chicken failed to bring out the flavor in the bird. While the portion was generous, I stopped about halfway through.  It would have helped if I liked the barbecue sauce, but their mild sauce seemed off (they also have a spicy and a vinegar based sauce). The meat plates do not automatically come with sides. I ordered steak fries, and they were fantastic. I tried some of my wife's mac and cheese, and the four cheese mix wasn't for me (but I tend to just like straight cheddar -- my wife liked it). My wife also really liked her barbecue chicken, which she got with collard greens and green onion cornbread, which she really seemed to enjoy. It seems from the reviews that folks who like Texas barbecue really like this place, but for what I like in barbecue, Fat Willys fell short. (Oh -- the service?

The hot link was really good too! Firing on all cylinders. Too bad we go there a little late and missed their brisked. You know it's good cause it's not available until after 5 and is in limited supply. I gotta try it! Their collard greens could rival my girl's. That's saying something. The mac and cheese is good. They use a really rich white cheddar and the breadcrumbs give that great crunch that complements mac and cheese so welll. Holy moly! Their baked spagetti is a sleeper. Not something many people order, but it is ohhhh so good. Cornbreads good, kinda hart to botch that up. Their coleslaw was not that great, but i added their vinegar sauce and it changed my opinion instantly.  Fat Willy's is some of the best BBQ in the city.

Unfortuately I'm a snob when it comes to BBQ after spending 28 years in Texas, and until yesterday every time I eat BBQ I compared to to my favorite spot in Austin, and every one of them fell short. Last night we visited Fat Willy's, and ordered 2 things, the Baby back ribs and the brownie.  The ribs were absolutely amazing, and Fat Willy's now holds the honor of being my favorite place to get ribs. A whole rack was $24, with fries and some toast. The whole rack was huge, texas sized if I may say. Both my wife and I shared the full rack and were stuffed after. Then came the brownie. At $11, you would say that is a pricey dessert, until they bring the massive cast iron skillet full of fresh, molten brownie, and topped with two huge scoops of ice cream, and whipped cream and caramel. This was SUPERB. My wife and I were in heaven, however there was no way on earth we could have finished it. This was a dessert meant for 4.

2012-01-06,3.0,"I used to travel to Texas (Houston, mostly) for business over the span of a few years, so I got used to eating really good BBQ. Fat Willy's is actually one of the first BBQ joints in Chicago that I've been to, and I left satisfied, but not impressed. My top two comments however: they ran out of beef brisket at 7pm. On a Thursday. How did that even happen? I had my mind set on getting the brisket, and I can't help but feel a little let down by that. The other thing - the Willy sauce, a creamy BBQ sauce, is extraordinary.  FOOD: BBQ sauce: a bit vinegary, but overall not bad. I could have used some more sweetness, but then again that can be a dangerous proposition given the pure amount of bbq sauce you consume eating ribs. Baby back pork ribs: my favorite thing. So good, tender, moist, juicy...everything ribs should be. But, besides being good, they didn't blow my mind or leave me wanting to eat every last morsel of meat.  St. Louis ribs: not as tender as the baby back variety, but still good. However, some of the meat was overly dry. My advice is to stick to the baby back ribs. House salad: why am I talking about the house salad? Because I was impressed by the quality of it. A standard offering with the dinner items, the salad was made of pretty high quality greens - no iceberg lettuce here. I wasn't expecting much from a BBQ hut, but this place really impressed with what's really just a side salad. Bravo. Corn on the cob: ugh. Tasted like a little bit of lighter fluid and a soggy mess that seems like it was frozen and microwaved. I'd pass on this if I were you. Cookie: 4"" across, and our server offered to warm it up (we accepted this offer). Overall, it was a pretty standard chocolate chip and pecan cookie. I wasn't impressed.  SERVICE: Our server forgot my salad when he brought everyone else's out, but he was generally around to get refills and ask if we needed anything else. Besides the initial (small) blunder, service was good. VALUE/OVERALL:  Overall, I think that Fat Willy's is a good option for the neighborhood. However, I need to check out the other popular places in Chicago before I made a final judgment on whether or not I'll head back. As of right now, I won't go back before trying all of the other options, if that says anything.

The website says they have a $2 deal with a garage close by and that's a good bet if you are planning to have dinner or with company.  Food: I got the lunch special which includes half a sandwich and 2 sides for $8.80 after taxes, and with fries. I got a brisket sandwich and Mac and cheese and coleslaw for my sides. I thought the portions were really good and I didn't think they skimped on the brisket at all. The brisket was very tender and moist so two thumbs up there. I think their BBQ sauce is really amazing. It's like the perfect amount of sweet and sour and good.  As for the sides... The coleslaw has a high vinegar to mayo ratio and quite sour, so I can see why this was hit and miss for some reviewers. If you're a fan of the creamy and almost sweet coleslaw, you will be quite disappointed. As for the mac and cheese, I was neither impressed nor unimpressed. It was cheesy, yes, but isn't that expected of any non-blue-box restaurant mac and cheese?  Overall I really enjoyed the meal. I thought it was a pretty darn good value, considering that BBQ is usually expensive.  One star off for the price.

Our waitress, I think her name is Jessie- that's what the receipt said, was great.  My one star is rating THE FOOD- highly disappointing, and the flexibility of the menu-irritating and frustrating. Let's start from the moment I open the menu.  This was a bit different already compared to most bbq joints I've been to where you usually go up to a counter and get your food...  anyway, I first look at the sides.  They don't offer mac n cheese as a side  (only as a big appetizer or dinner ), the cornbread has green onion in the name,  so there's no way I'm even trying that...but,  ugh, no mac n cheese? wtf? Then I get to the dinners ... You only get ONE choice of meat (also different from many other bbq places that will give you the choice of at least 2)  if you DO want another meat, you have to get another dinner portion that they will give you for a slightly less price than a full meal.  I just wanted to sample a couple different smaller sized meats.  NOPE, SORRY.  Also, the dinners come with a salad, texas toast, coleslaw and ONE side.  hmmm.  Well after listening to the waitress rattle off the seriously lacking list of dressing possibilities, I ask if I can get another side instead of a salad or soup  (the soup was creamy potato.. usually i love creamy potato, but i figured i'd already be eating a potato with my dinner)  THE ANSWER WAS NO..  ok fine, ugh.. i roll my eyes.  At this point I am pretty annoyed.  I tell her I'll just take the salad with the creamy parmesan dressing on the side.. then I order the baby back ribs with potato salad and no coleslaw.  I also ordered a side of corn on the cob and the mac n cheese appetizer to come with the meal.  My boyfriend ordered the hot sausage links basket that comes with fries and some baked beans.   I get my salad.. put a little bit of dressing on, it's suuuuuper thick and just clumps and sticks, doesn't spread at all throughout the salad, and then I taste it..  WOAH.  wayyyy to much garlic.  gross.  I tell my bf he can have the salad if he wants. Out comes the food.  I put the REGULAR (not hot) bbq sauce on my ribs, and try the potato salad.  YUCK.  really onion-y.  not a fan.   then I try some ribs.  They're o.k.  not as tender as I would expect for the baby back, and the sauce is way more spicy than I would expect for the not-spicy choice of sauces, but it's not bad.  The corn... NOT GOOD AT ALL..  it must be smoked cause it looks kind of black and dirty but not from a grill.  then i take a bite and get a whole bunch of strings in my mouth and the taste just isn't good.   OK, i think.. thank god we ordered the mac and cheese appetizer cause that's my only hope right now.   WRONG!  The mac and cheese was probably the worst of them all!!  the cheese sauce was super thick and chunky and floury and once again WAYYYYY too much garlic .. the texas toast had way too much garlic too.  This is pretty unbelievable since I actually really like garlic,  and even my Italian boyfriend who loves garlic as well tried the  mac n cheese, wrinkled his face  and was like ""yeah wow you're right that is way too garlic-y""   Obviously the cook either has no taste buds or feels like more garlic powder is the answer to everything. So basically, for a $60 meal before tip between the two of us we ate some decent ribs and sausage, but went home leaving most of the food uneaten and we were severely disappointed.   Next time, we'll be going to Smoque again which was pretty good, or I'll continue my search for a place in Chicago to come closer to my beloved Spring Creek Barbeque in Dallas,TX.",0.9776,0.798,0.116,0.086,0.5559626992725585

Namely - cornbread.  Cornbread is delicious.  Everyone loves corn bread.  Fat Willy's cornbread sucks.  They do a green onion-cheddar corn bread and commit the ultimate sin - it's completely over dry (not to mention the green onion-cheddar flavor add no value).

The hostess kept giving tables away as people came in and didn't hold any for our party.   We let her know that we had children and would appreciate if we could be seated.  She said she's trying, but we watched and she kept giving tables away.   We waited patiently and didnt make any more inquires until after the 25 minutes were up.  We asked again and were told that it shouldn't be much longer, but we kept seeing her give more tables away.  We waited longer and then asked again and she stated that there's nothing she can do.  It was an hour and a half later, so we had no choice but to leave. Somebody needs to teach them the logistics in holding tables to accomodate customers and to also set expectations.  We even asked to be split up but she kept giving tables away to people he came in after us. I know this won't get anywhere with the restaurant itself, but I wanted to let people with large parties know that you have to keep on top of the host and make sure she understands how to hold tables and set expectations.   This was very disappointing, especially since I always talk up the restaurant so much.",0.9602,0.857,0.105,0.037,0.5330242272347536

You will NOT find a place like this in the area. It's set in a weird location...right next to the Western movie theater...but the atmosphere is great. It's got parchment paper on the table tops. So, kids can draw and entertain themselves while they wait for their food.  Everything I've tried there is delicious. Including their split pea soup. Their rib tips. Ribs. Pork sandwich. Fries. Chili mac. ANY OF THEIR DESSERTS! Oh holy bejeebus. It's so good. And to top it all off, the service is wonderful. Each server I have had has been helpful and funny. You will find up to a 1 1/2 hour wait on the weekends, especially later on (around 8pm). But it's worth it. Go see a movie or something. There is a VERY small bar area you can grab a drink while you wait, but it will be standing room only as there are like 5 chairs there.

Do NOT eat anything before you come here or plan on having a big meal afterwards.  The BBQ portions are huge and the appetizers and desserts could feed a family of four.  We got the Artichoke dip and it was served in a pan the size of a casserole dish.  The brownie dessert comes in the cast iron skillet it was baked in, with about a foot of whipped cream on top.  I'm not exaggerating, the portions here can get ridiculous. I've had the ribs, rib tips, and pulled pork and they were all awesome.  Perfectly cooked, thoroughly smoked, and plentiful  The rib tips are very fatty (as they should be) so you better like gristle or be ready to chew around it.  There are spicy and sweet homemade BBQ sauces on the table.  The slaw is perfect - crispy, fresh, and not too creamy (vinegar based).  The fries are real steak fries - huge pieces fried to golden perfection.

2011-10-02,2.0,"This review is for the service. I eat there often and the food is great. But last night, my sister and I wanted to have a few drinks before our movie and decided to stop into Fat Willy's (around 6-6:30). It wasn't unusually busy, and there were a lot of workers walking around. It took almost ten minutes for anyone to say anything to us. No ""hello"" or ""someone will be right with you"". Nada. When the hostess finally came, she was very nice. We told her we would only be having drinks and she sat us outside with our drink menu. Our server came and took our drink order and brought us our drinks promptly. As we were drinking we noticed the people around us with some pretty amazing looking cups of soup. The server came back about 5 minutes later and asked us if we wanted to order food. We asked about the soup and he told us it was Cream of Potato. We both decided on a cup each of soup and he left. We were enjoying our drinks and talking and laughing and time just sort of passed us by. Forty minutes passed and my sister said to me, ""hey, he never brought us our soup"". I hadn't noticed until then. At that point we were already setting our minds for popcorn so we decided if he brought it out we'd just turn it down. We sat another twenty or so minutes and he never brought it out. Not only that, but the whole time we sat there, he never asked us if we wanted another drink or anything. He didn't come back to the table for almost an hour. We asked for our check, made sure we weren't charged for the soup, paid and left. Now I understand things happen. You order a burger, fries and a side salad and they forget the salad. They come to the table, ask if everything is ok, and you remind them of your salad, they apologize and get it. No biggie. But if you order a coke and a burger and they forget the burger and never come by the table to ask if you want another coke, that's a problem. He forgot the whole meal part of the meal!! And of course, we could have flagged him down and requested our soups, and honestly it was probably better that we didn't eat the soup (more room for popcorn!), but that's not our job. It's his. If all I order is a Gin and Tonic and a cup of Cream of Potato and never get the Cream of Potato or SEE my server again after my one and only drink, that's major.

We debated a little while about ordering an app, but after I heard ""Sausage Gumbo"" was an option, I immediately said, screw the app, I'm going for the Gumbo!! My sister and I shared a meal, the shrimp. We were able to order them half fried and half grilled. The taste was very nice, the temperature, was disappointing. They were a little cooled off by the time they hit out table; I don't think they use food lamps which means if your food sits on the counter, it cools off.  The coolie dip they served with the shrimp was very tasty....surprise!  This time when the shrimp had a minute to cool off, did not affect our mashed potatoes in any way....those babies were piping hot!! In fact, not only were they hot, but they were some of the best mashed potatoes I think I have ever had and I'm not a mashed fan. We also got a cup of their chicken noodle soup which I encouraged my sis to eat, but she gave up and let my fiance swipe it from her. Not before I got a taste, though. The overflow of veggies, chicken breast chunks and HOMEMADE noodles was too much for me to fight off the temptation, I took a bite or three! The gumbo was very good. The okra was not in solid form as it had been cooking so long, so it was a little mushy, but it was very good. It had a nice flavor and an after kick. My brother in law got talked into the $17.00 mac & cheese.  I tasted it, it was pretty damn good mac & cheese, but I'm not sure it was worth $17.00 or a $17 portion, at that. My fiance ordered a pulled pork sandwich that I convinced him to get because I wanted to try their pulled pork and it was excellent. The meat was moist and their fries were yummy too.  The restaurant was not that appealing from the outside, but the food was pretty impressive.  The overall experience was a 4 out of 5 for me, as going to use their washroom before we left was a big turn off.  The ""cows in the clouds"" was a cute mural they had painted on the wall....but that does not cover up the dirt or smell.

Wasn't dry or overdone, which is great when you order chicken. It's very hard to bbq chicken and get it right at a restaurant. The one thing I'm used to with BBQ is ""combo plates."" 1 meat, 2 veggies and a bread with a drink. That's just standard. Not sure why they don't offer these, but I wish they did. They didn't offer, that I saw, pulled pork as a plate option, either. Only sandwich. I'd have to say, make combo plates for ~10-12 bucks a shot and you'd improve my view. Service was good.

2011-08-23,4.0,"Oh boy! Fat Willy, you are a friend of mine! Thanks for having us over this weekend!  I think I might still be full, but I can't help imagining our next visit together.  After wandering around aimlessly for a while on Saturday afternoon, me, my husband, sister and her fiance followed the amazing smell of smoked meats to Fat Willy's Rib Shack. It really is a ""shack""! This is a case of not judging a book by it's cover.  We walked into a covered porch area and through another door into the restaurant. We were quickly greeted and told we could sit outside right away. Having been in an air conditioned car for over an hour, we weren't up for enduring the heat outside, but the wonderful smells got to us and we decided to take a seat on the covered porch. A few fans would go a long way out here.  We met our server and quickly decided that we didn't need an appetizer. We had seen a few plates come out and everyone of them seemed to be overflowing with home cookin'!  My sister and I split the full order of shrimp (we did half grill and half beer-battered and fried), we had mashed potatoes, coleslaw, Texas toast and chicken noodle soup. Let me break this down:  The shrimp had an absolutely awesome flavor and were cooked just right. They came with a ""coolie"" sauce on the side that was just right. The only critique would be their temperature. They were cool when we got them.  The mashed potatoes were homemade and there were plenty of them! No gravy, but it wasn't necessary. Real chunks of potatoes made me happy that we chose this side instead of fries.  The coleslaw was snatched up by my hubby who had a mac n cheese dinner. He wasn't a fan of the coleslaw, but LOVED the mac n cheese! Our server did not lead him wrong. :-)  The Texas toast has a bit of olive oil and garlic on it. It was a nice addition to the plate.  Saving the best for last...the chicken noodle soup was to die for!!! Large chunks of chicken. Large veggie pieces. Delicious broth. And the best part...homemade noodles! It was soooooo good! We shared it with the fiance to save room for the shrimp which was very nice of us because he didn't order soup.  In addition to the mac n cheese, my Anthony ordered a side of chili. He offered to share, but I didn't take him up on it because I wanted to save room. I think he was secretly glad that I didn't take any of it because he ate it all up and said how great it was!  The fiance, Steve, ordered a half pulled pork sandwich and fries. He ate every bite without complaint and helped us finish ours as well. I am going out on a limb and saying he's a fan, too!  So, to recap:  Don't judge a book by its cover.  Don't over-order.  DO eat the shrimp coolie sauce.  DO order the mashed potatoes.  DO order the chicken noodle soup.

Usually for a drink I'll opt for the Hogarita for $6 because I'm usually in a tequila mood but when I'm trying to be more frugal (after my $20 slab of ribs) I will order a PBR for $1.75.  They offer 40oz beers in a brown paper bag for $6 which is hilarious but I've never ordered one.  My boyfriend and I considered it yesterday on our visit but chugging a 40 while eating outside in 90 degree weather with a hangover didn't seem like it would work out well for us.  Maybe next time ... My favorite thing is to go with one other person and split the mac and cheese appetizer and the ribs.  It just the right amount of food and with a  couple PBRs each it will run you about $20-$25 a person. Fat Willy's is definitely worth the time, the trip and the money.",0.9956,0.765,0.188,0.048,0.5107006020799125

Pulled Pork Sandwich = Only get a half sandwich, and you'll still have some to bring home. Also, I like to put both spicy and regular sauces on it. Chili = Ok this didn't blow my face off, just my socks. They put Pico De Gallo over the top and it's a wrap! Bangin. Fried Catfish = Huge catfish filet, lightly breaded and served with a spicy tarter sauce. Wooooo. I recommend pairing it with some collard greens as well. Collard Greens = I used to hate collard greens, because every time my Grandma would make them, they would stink the entire house up. But once I got past that part, I was sold. Fat Willy's collard greens are juicy and tender with just the right amount of greasy porky smokiness.  Fries = Always crispy and good. Try dipping them in the BBQ sauces too.  Vodka Lemonade (or just plain Lemonade) = Summertime CHI! Come on, everyone knows one of the best parts about the Windy City in the summer is drinking outside. Actually I think drinking outside with friends on a hot summer day is one of the best parts of life... period. Fat Willy's patio is a great place to do so, with a giant glass of Vodka & fresh squeezed Lemonade. Hot Fudge Brownie Sundae = Yeah. I never thought I'd eat something that justified getting diabetes. No... like, you'll get diabetes on the spot if you eat this. No family history, not even at risk... eat this, and you'll get type 2 diabetes. And it will be totally worth it.

It was grilled and had a buttery garlic coating on it but it was still soft and fluffy when you bite into it. We also got a side of chili cheese fries which were good as well.

They offer three types of BBQ sauce to accompany your pork, a vinegar based, a sweet and a spicy. My favorite was the vinegar BBQ sauce and I doused my sandwich in it. The fries were crispy, the mac was creamy and delicious and the Willy Chili was sweet, savory, meaty and quite amazing. All this wonderfulness for only $8 dollars. Nice! My refills were constantly being refilled, my lunch was pleasantly delicious, service and atmosphere was simply perfect.

Guess what I found at Fat Willy's Rib Shack? Yeah. Now I've had a handful of dishes from Fat Willy's over the years but the two that I can recommend you buy copious amounts of shove into your mouth hole as fast as possible are the pulled pork sandwich and the pulled brisket sandwich.  Willy's pulled pork sandwich ($12 for a biggun, $8 for a smallun) is ridiculously good. It's tangy and not laden with a bunch of toppings or so much sauce it's drowning. Rather they bring the sauces to your table beforehand and you can drench it to your own taste. The pork itself is masterfully cooked and the baguette it comes on gives it just enough bite to counteract the smooth luscious pork. Plus you get slaw so heap it on and discover why the laws of kashrut and halal are bullshit, pork was meant to be devoured.  Their pulled brisket sandwich (likewise $12 for a biggun, $8 for a smallun) is likely unbelievably good. I already like brisket but goddamn if they didn't shred it, top it with caramelized onions, put a creamy, subtle horseradish spread on and mount it on that baguette. It's tender and perfect and so. much. meat. that you'll likely take part of it home with you. It's definitely not as tangy as the pork but that's what the bottles of sauce are for, right?

Come on man it's barbeque.  On to the food. The ribs were very good, very meaty, and slightly chewy with a good smokey flavor. Defiantly the highlight of our visit. Hold the sauce though. It spoils the really good flavor of the ribs. They give you 3 sauces on the table. One hot, one vinegar and one regular. The sauces are not good period. The tips were just OK but for the money I expected twice as many tips, simply not worth it, plus they were covered in BBQ sauce.

You can purchase an $18 plate and add something additional on the side for another $8-14. Then the bill starts to just get ridiculous for BBQ. My friend and I decided to each get a plate and split them. We also added some sausage links from the appetizer menu so we could get a little of everything. I got the half slab of pork ribs for $16. Yes, six ribs and fries for $16! I chose to get the basket (plate without salad basically) to save a few dollars. The ribs were slightly above average but I've had many that were better. I also had to pay extra to get mashed potatoes instead of fries so I basically paid the plate price after the waitress talked me into the basket to save a few bucks. My friend got the brisket basket for $17. Being from Texas, where BBQ is available on every corner, I've had a lot of brisket in my life. This brisket was disappointing and came in below average. It was not as tender as it should have been and we got an inadequate amount of meat considering the price.  Two small sausage links from the appetizer menu cost us $10. The sausage was the best thing we ate and I would recommend based on taste but again the price was just too high. Our bill came out to $52 before tip (one soda, one water). We left with a little room in our stomachs as well. In all of my experiences with BBQ, I've always spent between $10-20 and left stuffed with a little bit to take home.  Overall, I would give the food three stars because it was just that, around average. There was nothing about the dining experience that was bad and I do like the location which is easy to pop in before a movie. That being said, I will not be returning because I know there are many other places I can get food that is as good or better for half the price.",0.979,0.837,0.113,0.05,0.3901470588235294

What made Fat Willy's so great was the fact that they are BBQ pimps, and nothing rounds out good fried catfish like solid BBQ sauce.  The portion was gigantic.  It came with hush puppies, texas toast, steak fries, and an oxford comma.  The hush puppies weren't all that special but the texas toast was made with a certain sexual tension that gave the garlic a little extra something.  The steak fries were the same ones you get everywhere else, but they filled a good role player status off the bench.  There was no room for much of that because the catfish was the side of my big bulging forearm.  The cornmeal batter was great too, although sir if you are reading this it didn't stick to the catfish very well.  I would recommend battering your fresh fish and then putting it in the fridge for an hour or so and that won't happen as much.   When it comes to justifying a perfect score I can cite the BBQ sauce as what gave Fat Willy's that extra push towards perfection.  The words I want to use to describe it are sexual in nature and therefore not fit for print.   I'll go back and try their brisket and tell you guys whats up.",0.9961,0.748,0.204,0.048,0.49265814830330956

They had your typical BBQ stuff, ribs, chicken, brisket, etc but I was interested in n trying out their rib tips as that is one of my favorites. So i was torn between ordering the half dinner or the whole but I went with my gut and order the full order of rib tips, boy was that a mistake. I got a big heaping at least a pounds worth of BBQ rib tips and was it worth every bit. Of course to top it off I just had to order the 40oz of MGD to go along with it. Needless to say these two things sent me into a food coma. Those were probably the best rip tips I have had in a very very long time.

2010-08-30,5.0,"Wow, how have I not written a Fat Willy's rave review yet. I guess I'm just lazy. Anyways this is the best BBQ that Chicago has to offer IMHO. It beats Smoque, Brand, Lilly, Smoke Daddy and the rest hands down. I'm a Memphis Styled BBQ kind of guy, and Fat Willys does it right. Their pulled pork sandwich is simply the best pulled pork I've ever had, and I've toured the South. The true wood burning smoke permeates every bit of the long pork strands, slow-cooked to perfection. It so good that it doesn't need sauce, but when you do add their hot sauce, man does that sandwich take off. It's got a bit of fire and zip to it, making it more and more addictive with each bite you take. There's just a ridiculous amount of flavor in this sandwich. The bun is not the typical boring soft roll style, but more of a hearty sandwich roll, that can absorb the juice and sauce while keeping the structure intact. It's filling.  A half sandwich is a perfectly sane portion, but I like leftovers, so I order the full. While for me the pulled-pork is the star attraction, Fat Willys also features an amazing support cast of ribs, smoked brisket, chicken wings, jalapeno corn fritters, and cheesy tomato bread. There's some others that I haven't tried yet that I'm sure are amazing, but I just can't pass up the pulled pork sandwich.

Sandwiches come in half orders, which I totally recommend (fat portions here), along with crunchy wedge fries and a sweet but vinegary coleslaw.  So if the sandwich doesn't fill you up, the sides will do the trick!   I ordered the brisket sandwich which was loaded with tender juicy meat!  I had enough extra meat to make another sandwich!  Mix their homemade vinegar (with red peppers) and BBQ sauce for the ultimate condiment.  If I had leftovers I would have definitely asked for this finger-licking sauce combination in take home form as well. I'm not one to pass up cornbread when I spot it on any menu so I ordered a slice.  Wasn't too crazy about it...I like my cornbread Paula Dean style...buttered up!...but the sweet whipped butter that came with made up for the dry cornbread.   Service is friendly, fast, and informative.  All I need to get by.  We came in an hour before close, but we didn't feel at all rushed as we dove into our ginormous sandwiches in their outdoor seating area.

2010-08-15,2.0,"I was disappointed with Fat Willy's after all of the great reviews I saw here. I recently moved to Chicago from Columbus, Ohio where I had finally found the best BBQ I have ever eaten. I am a pretty big connoisseur of BBQ of the pork persuasion and after finding Fat Willy's on yelp figured I would try it out and compare it to my former city's best pulled pork. Needless to say I wasn't impressed.  I went on a weekday afternoon and the place was semi-busy but not packed. Their server was nice and attentive. Now I had already gone in there knowing I was going to get the pulled pork so I didn't bother to ask what they were known for or what she recommended. They had a good lunch special going (I forget specifically what it was but I remember thinking it was a good deal) but I opted for the whole pulled pork sandwich with a side of the collard greens a la carte.  When the sandwich came I noticed that it was not your usual pink smoky meat color but rather had a reddish hue as if they had slathered it in sauce or put a dry rub on it before/while cooking. Now I know that to some this is not a big deal but I have always been of the opinion that the best BBQ lets the meat do the talking and the sauces and rubs are secondary. The sauce and/or rubs on this meat definitely overpowered what should have been the smoky goodness of the pork. It wasn't bad by any means but it just wasn't what I would consider a great BBQ pulled pork sandwich.  Next, the greens were mediocre as well. Maybe even more so than the sandwich. They were extremely bland with next to no seasoning and no pork bits (which I am used to having in my greens). They were also a little undercooked.  The price wasn't outrageous but i wasn't cheap either. The meal was big but it ended up costing around $14 with a coke to drink. From other reviewers I see that the brisket might be the way to go here.

The macaroni & cheese is awesome.  My 'fella got some kind of mac & cheese chili bowl, and it was ridiculously good.  I usually steer clear of chili on a hot afternoon/evening, but I couldn't help myself from sneaking a few bites. I got the St. Louis ribs, with coleslaw, collard greens, and Texas toast.  The Texas toast wasn't anything special.  Good for dipping into my 'fella's mac & cheese chili...  The collard greens were awesome!  I would have liked a little more vinegar, but didn't think to ask for it.  The coleslaw was pretty good, sliced (thin) instead of chopped, and not too creamy.  The ribs were... well, they were okay tasting.  They were kind of tough, and I feel bad saying it, because I really think it had to be a fluke.  This place seems like it knows how to get it right, and maybe I just caught them on a bad night.  They were out of the beef brisket, too, so maybe it had been a busy night, and in a rush, they didn't have the time to cook the ribs to complete perfection?  I want to go back again and confirm that.  I saved half of my half-rack to reheat the next day, and they were much better as leftovers. The highlight of this dining experience had to be that tea and lemonade was on the menu, and it actually had a name -- Arnold Palmer.  WHY have I never heard of this?  I thought I invented tea and lemonade!  Well, that humbled me a little bit.  Anyway, it was great!

Great spot to hit up anytime, but especially when going to a movie across the street at the now semi-defunct Regal (used to be Kerasotes) Theater. It couldn't be any more convenient, and tangy sauce slathered ribs certainly beat out dried up hot dogs and stale movie nachos any day of the week!  Fabulously casual surrounds for enjoying nummy BBQ dishes are easily acquirable here... take yer seating pick from the informal street side patio or in the traditionally relaxed southern style indoor confines. Both options reflect the unfussy, straightforward nature of the food wonderfully and guarantee a relaxed time with warm, friendly (though surprisingly young) service to boot.  The combo and dinner baskets are without a doubt the highlight of Fat Willy's. You get a strong - and generous - sampling of all things BBQ-beauteous and it's most definitely the way to go to achieve an economical level of satiating rarely found elsewhere. My $12 BBQ Chicken basket bought me 1/2 a phenomenally juicy, wonderful, sweet and tangy chicken alongside a house salad, my choice of side (go for the Green Onion & Cheddar Corn Bread baked in cast iron & served with honey butter), cole slaw and a huge slice of buttered Texas Toast for ideal sauce sopping. Hoo-Ahhhhh!!  Willy's ribs were also a nice standout, though not nearly as good as my beloved Twin Anchors. Oh yeah, they still take the big BBQ prize, sorry!

After that, our waitress disappeared.  Well actually she didn't disappear, we could see her through a window the whole time.  Sitting and chatting mostly, and then she actually left the restaurant and went down the block for a smoke.   We could see the kitchen from our table, and I saw our order sitting ready on the counter for at least ten minutes before she went to get it.   At least it was still warm when we got it.  It tasted fine, but by that time I was too pissed to enjoy it.   Overall it took us more than two hours to get pulled pork sandwiches.  And it cost more than $50 for two of us, and we didn't even have alcohol.   Will NOT go back to the slowest, worst managed restaurant in Chicago.",0.267,0.817,0.112,0.071,0.4553819444444445

Maybe it's because I had Smoque the other weekend... whatever it is, Fat Willy's just DOES NOT deliver. Period.  My friend's brisket was dry and needed BBQ sauce and, strangely, left behind a huge puddle of grease. In fact, everything here needed extra BBQ sauce dumped on it. Problem number 1. I'm not one to smother everything with sauce because the meat's flavor alone and the whole cooking process should take care of that whole flavor issue... duh.   I'm on a baked beans kick so I had to try their baked beans.... lacked any flavor whatsoever. I had to add a 1/4 c. of vinegar just to get the slightest bit of tang out of it. Oh, I added some BBQ sauce too. My rib tips were tough and I kept getting mouthfuls of tough, globby fat that I had to spit out in my napkin. Embarrassing.

And come on, onion rings sometimes come down to being facilitators of the BBQ sauce tasting.  Pulled pork and me? Well, let's just say I was never a gal to turn down an invite to a pig roast back in the day.  And Fat Willy knows him some pulled pork. Big, juicy shreds of pork piled high on a firm, chewy roll that stands up to the juice of the meat make for a killer sandwich created what possibly could be the best pulled pork sammie I have ever eaten.

I've been wanting to come forever, but needed to build up just the right appetite as I knew the food would be large and in charge. Let's start with the drinks. Delicious. The Bloody Mary could be the best I've ever tasted. Basically it's like drinking gazpacho soup, but with alcohol and a crapload of condiments skewered on top (olives, pickles, cheese, etc). Also of note is the Robert Palmer, especially if you are sitting outside and its one of those hot summer days. For starters we had the Rib Tips, damn were they good. Perfectly burnt edges with just the right amount of tasty tasty bbq sauce. Then came the real deal meal, the Brisket Dinner complete with mashed potatoes, cole slaw and texas toast. I'm always partial to my mom's brisket, but this really gave her's a run for her money. Not only was it swimming in the delicious broth, but they provided another cup full, just in case that wasn't enough. You don't need a knife for this brisket, it easily comes apart with your fork and is also enough for two people to share. Speaking of cups, whatever was in the cup that accompanied the mashed potatoes was good enough to directly spoon into your mouth. It was some kind of sour cream/garlic concoction that I applied liberally to the amazing mashed potatoes. The cole slaw was no joke either. What seems to be a common theme around these parts, it contained cilantro which only added to the already great slaw. And then I was left with the texas toast.

2010-05-17,3.0,"Everyone is always looking for the next big thing, the best of the best. I believe there is something to be said for the old standbys. Is Fat Willy's fall-off-your-chair fantastic? Well, no. But it's consistently good!  I've been to Fat Willy's many times during my 5+ years in Chicago. I've also been to quite a few other BBQ joints in this town. I'm not from Texas, or St. Louis, or The South, so I have no allegiance to any specific style of BBQ. Sometimes I like sticky sweet BBQ sauce, other times I like a vinegary tang. As long at the meat is tender, juicy and flavorful, I'm happy!  I usually get the pulled pork sandwich. I crave pulled pork, and it's usually what I order at any BBQ restaurant. This one is tender, flavorful and not insanely huge. The brisket sammie is also delish, with it's caramelized onions, yummo. When Mr. Man is in the mood for brisket, he orders this as a 2nd choice, since they are ALWAYS out of the sliced beef brisket that comes in the dinners and baskets. I think you have to get there RIGHT at 5 pm to order sliced brisket before they run out! Mr. Man is a rib lover, and he really likes their St. Louis style ribs. He's also a fan of their chicken wings.  One thing that surprised me was the mac n' cheese. I always looked at it on the menu, but it seemed a bit pricey to me ($9.95 for a starter, $16.95 for a dinner). Then one day I was sitting next to a table that ordered it, and it was all golden brown and gooey, and I vowed to order it next time. Actually, the next time I ate Fat Willy's (woo, that sounded dirty!) was a delivery order, and even THEN the mac n' cheese was delish! A fresh-baked order when you eat in is even better. The only thing that would make this mac n' cheese PERFECT is if they let you add other ingredients into it, like, I dunno, BACON. Order an appetizer size to share, why not?  I've only been disappointed 1 time at Fat Willy's. Once again it was a delivery order, and my BBQ chicken was a bit dry. I've had it in-house before and it was very good, so maybe the chicken was sitting under a heat lamp or something?  I have tried to branch out from the pulled pork, and last time I asked the waiter if any of the seafood was any good. They have fried shrimp and a catfish po'boy. The waiter gushed about the catfish so much that he convinced me to order it, and you know what, it was pretty darn good.  One of my most favoritest things about Fat Willy's is their fresh lemonade. I know, how random. It is SO GOOD. If you love fresh lemonade, it is not to be missed! Honestly that's the first thing I think of whenever anyone mentions Fat Willy's. Well, the 2nd thing. How can you not love the name of this place?!",0.998,0.812,0.172,0.016,0.49473544973544986
2010-05-15,1.0,"The one star is strictly for the cute personality of the new blonde waitress.  DO NOT EVER ORDER A BURGER HERE! My buddy and I shared a rib tip appetizer which was super fatty and had many bones.  The only upside of the entire expensive appetizer was the BBQ sauce.   Up next, he got the ""coveted"" brisket (which they are always out of when he orders it).  The waitress came back to tell him that he got the last one.  I tried it, not impressed.  Even he admitted that his mom's is better.  I thought it was thick and dry, though soaked in juice. Now the fun begins.  I was in the mood for a burger and the waitress said they were good.  I ordered the BBQ Burger medium rare.  So when the burger was first served, a few minutes after my buddy got his brisket, I cut into it and it looked medium well.  I gave it a taste and found good flavor, but dry.  I mentioned that it was a bit overcooked and she agreed.  Then she says that the kitchen has had a history of not cooking the burger to temperature.  Wonderful!  She took it back for a chance at redemption.  About 10 minutes later (yes, that long), she brought me round 2 and it was the same deal.  She commented how she wanted to get back in the kitchen and cook it herself for me.  I was not happy, but trying to be patient and not make a scene while spending quality time with my buddy (who was pretty much finished with his brisket at this time).  Round three came about 3-4 minutes later and was totally raw when I got it.  From one extreme to the other. The waitress apologized and I was being my stubborn Taurus self and told her I would rather leave hungry than ask for something else.  This dinner had already taken over an hour.  She brought the bill and had taken off the burger, but that was it.  There was little compensation for the spoiled experience and wasted time.  So I spoke to the Manager.  I believe his name was Paul.  I was tactful while speaking to Paul mentioning the tainted meal and wasted time.  He seemed not to care too much, but did comply in removing my lemonade and 4 dollars off of the expensive rib tips (with hardly any meat). Thank you for the consolation, but I will NEVER associate burgers with this place ever again.  WORST BURGERS EVER!!",-0.4458,0.844,0.085,0.071,0.45832038332038333

Finally the chili was just disappointing. If you want good chili you should call Smoque to see if they are serving any because there's is to die for.  Still this place will have me coming back for some stupid reason. Maybe it's cause I really want to try their Brisket. By now I should fear that the wait won't be worth it.

If that isn't classy I don't know what is!   So five of us came here last night at 6pm.  My friend asked if we should make reservations, I laughed at him, but when we walked in there, the place was already jam packed and it was going to be a 45 minute wait until a table would be free.  FYI - they don't take reservations so if you have a large party, prepare for a wait.  Luckily you can get started on your 40's while waiting for your table.  The waiting area is a combination of both the pick up window and the bar so get ready to get up and personal with the rest of the folks waiting! Fat Willys is definitely worth the 45 minute wait!  We each got a half order of ribs.  I had the STL style ribs, the rest of the table had the baby back and one of my friends ordered the rib tips.  Apparently the beef brisket is very popular here, which prevails to be true since we tried to order it and found out that they were out.  My friend almost cried when he found that out, in fact I think I did see a trickle of a tear.   Our food came out pretty fast - the half slab of ribs comes with a salad and a side so it was overwhelming to try to decide what to eat first, but the sight of all that food was welcomed since we were all pretty hungry.  Our waitress kept apologizing that it all came out at once, I think she took our silence as us being upset, but we were just all too busy ravaging our food and stuffing our mouths.   Although my ribs were cooled down by the time it got to our table, that didn't take away from the amazing smokey and robust flavor of my STL ribs.  They were both meaty and juicy.  The extra BBQ sauce at our table was amazing - it was spicy and sweet and I made sure to dip my entire rib in that sauce!   I had the grilled corn for my side - also very tasty and perfectly grilled and seasoned with cajun spice.  We got some mac and cheese on the side - very cheesy and had some garlic kick to it.  Very delicious.  And best of all, the 40 oz MGD complimented our dinner perfectly..and how often can you say that about a 40.   I am definitely coming back here for ribs, and maybe some beef brisket.  Who knows maybe this time I will order a full slab so I have some to take home!",0.9987,0.791,0.192,0.017,0.5113185425685427

Not a huge sandwich, or a plateful, just a small bite, to see if we liked it enough to change and order the pork instead of the brisket.

I once ate there, having already had ribs that day, so I decided to get a burger, and it turns out the burgers are fantastic as well!  I had been dying to find a good burger in Chicago, since I'd grown up in an area where good burgers were important, and had always been disappointed by either overly-gourmet burgers, or overly fast-food burgers.  These are properly grilled burgers without all the flash of gourmet, and with all the proper flavor of the grill. I've also had the pulled-pork sandwich, which as with any pulled pork, was almost totally dependent on the sauce, which is the best in Chicago.  The meat was tender and juicy, as with the ribs. Highly recommended for hanging out with good friends.  When I lived in Chicago, this is where I always took out-of-towners who had only seen the inside of Giordano's (*shudder*).  Truly a great place, out of the limelight, making its way not through advertising and image, as with the downtown restaurants, but through delicious comfort food and laid-back atmosphere.",0.9832,0.818,0.173,0.009,0.6699999999999999

2010-03-05,4.0,"This is the first review in a 4-part series entitled, Big Sexy Gives It Up for Charity.  Destry arrived to pick me up for my charity date promptly, and he even brought me a gift: a picture frame with a generic illustration of three white tigers. The price tag had been removed, but I could tell that Destry went all-out-baller on this gift. Forget about Wal-Mart here; the man clearly threw dollar hand-over-fist. This picture was high class, like from Walgreens, or maybe even CVS. A true rarity. I was nearly moved to tears upon seeing it, particularly when Destry told me the meaning behind the illustration. According to Big Sexy, the tiger on the right signified him, the tiger on the left signified me, and the baby tiger in the middle signified our love for one another. Sweet, right? Destry made this endearing moment even sweeter by letting me know that I shouldn't lick the frame because it had some funky paint job on it and licking it might kill me. It was at this point that I was certain our date would be magical.  Upon arriving at Fat Willy's, we put our names in for a table. We were told we'd have to wait about 35 minutes, and that's about how long we waited. During this time, Destry noticed my distress at the waiting time, so he diverted my attention by telling me that a pretty waitress had made eye love to me several times. Rather than feeling taken advantage of by this waitress, I decided that Destry's words were intended to make me feel special, much like the tiger painting. I thought about that baby tiger and nearly popped a boner. I was just that moved.   Once seated, our waitress took our order right away, because she knew we were pushing time to make our movie. I ordered the rip tips and a salad, and Destry ordered the chili-mac and a cup of soup.  The food was prepared quickly and brought to us with great haste.  The waitress and the rest of the staff were friendly and did a phenomenal job. Everything was quite tasty. The rib tips weren't quite as tender as I would've liked, but I ate all of them and I'm not prone to eating food that I don't like. Even though I was too shy to ask Destry to seductively fork some of his chili-mac into my mouth, I still sampled some of it with my own fork. It was frigging yummy. The next time I come back to Fat Willy's, that is what I'll be ordering. After unloading nearly an entire roll of paper towels to clean our hands and faces, we tossed our coats on.

2010-02-04,4.0,"It was a cold winter night and I had BBQ on the brain.  Smoque certainly came to my mind first, but my fiancee and I felt like trying something new so we made our way to Fat Willy's.   Smoque has long been my ""Cadillac"" of BBQ brisket purveyors, so my first inclination was to get the brisket at Fat Willy's.  After our waitress sat us down and gave us our menus, the first thing she said was ""We're out of the brisket dinner."" Bust!!  It's an hour before closing on a Wednesday night so I understand, but now I go into panic mode.  Do I go with with the pulled brisket sandwich??  Try the ribs??  Leave, drive like a madman to Smoque before they close, and hope they still have brisket??   After much face contorting and head scratching I decided to go with the Baby Back Ribs dinner.  Man oh man, they did not disappoint.  On the inside the ribs were moist and tender from the smoking process.  On the outside they had a nice bit of char from being finished on the grill, which added to an already flavorful rub/marinade.  These aren't your fall off the bone type of ribs, but they still come off clean if you don't mind getting your hands dirty.  You also get a choice of three BBQ sauces on the table.  First was the regular (thick & sweet variety), then the spicy (same as the first but with a little heat), and the third was a vinegar based Carolina-type sauce.  The spicy really didn't seem spicy at all, and the vinegar-based sauce was watery thin.  Mixing the regular and the vinegar based sauce turned out to be my perfect combo - a little sweet, a little sour, and just thick enough to stick to the ribs. The only downers I have on Fat Willy are pretty minor.  My sweet potato was half cold (still tasted good and I was too focused on my ribs anyway) and our waitress, while friendly, was kinda slow (didn't get a water refill till I was done with my dinner and she forgot to drop off paper towels for my messy hands).  Pretty insignificant stuff, and definitely won't keep me from coming back for another BBQ binge.   As a parting note, the kids menu states ""for kids of any age"" and Fat Willy's is true to their word.  My fiancee's appetite wasn't as ravenous as mine so the Southern Baked Spaghetti turned out to be just the right size for a light dinner.",0.9947,0.813,0.147,0.04,0.47168891199503427

P.s. at Willy's they like to stick little surprises underneath the wax paper in your to-go boxes.  We thought we were done eating when lo and behold, Texas Toast!  What other gems do you have for me Willy?  I love how you spoil me with your feasts of intimate glory.",0.9949,0.782,0.207,0.012,0.5929705215419501

Moved, conveniently, to a place right around the corner from here and take everyone that visits our new place to the best BBQ in Chicago. No one has been disappointed yet. It can get busy from time to time especially on a Thursday - Saturday. When the weather is nice there is outdoor seating. The parking sucks in this neighborhood so if you're not going to see a movie across the street at City North 14  then be prepared to do some serious searching and a couple block walk back to this place. NO VALET. Every time I eat here I try a different dish and so far have not been disappointed. Portions are large and at least with the sandwiches you can get a half order which is still overwhelming. When it's not busy or you are just picking up to go the food is ready within 10-15 minutes at most. The handmade Lemonade is a fantastic southern style lemonade. The sweet tea isn't bad and I would recommend to at least try it. Best meal that I have had here is the Pulled Pork BBQ Sandwich or the Smoked Chicken Sandwich.

If possible, try making plans to eat while movies are already playing to avoid the parking game.  Ambiance  Although the location is designated as a Rib Shack, I would describe it more of a cross between casual restaurant and cozy cafe. The dining room is small, but with enough space between tables that you can eat comfortably and not feel squeezed in. I found myself admiring the cute paintings of pigs, cows and other farm animals on the walls. I guess that's kind of twisted,  given the fact I would be picking these animals to eat off the menu.

Definitely an A for customer service.  Food  Somewhere between parking the car, and waiting for a table, I managed to lose my mind, because I ordered a ton of food. I started off with the Brisket, and had a sampling of rib tips, mashed potatoes and pasta. The brisket was some of the best I've ever had in Chicago, or anywhere else for that matter.

I just wasn't expecting to see a bbq place there and have it actually be good. So I went along my way, never stopping in. Then friends here and there kept raving about how good it was, and I knew I had to make a visit and see it for myself. My first experience with their food was actually during RibFest a few years back. I was impressed. But because it's in a part of town I'm rarely in, I didn't think about it again. Tonight I found myself at the theater for a movie screening, and after resisting the overpriced-yet-delicious movie theater popcorn, I suggested to my friend that we stop by Fat Willy's. Luckily he agreed! The decor's what one would expect from a place named Fat Willy's. Not the frilliest or chicest, there's butcher paper on the tables. Your silverware comes in paper napkin roll-ups. The menu is several pages long, and what took me aback a bit was seeing prices in the $20 range for entrees. But there were apps and sandwiches that seemed a bit more reasonable. After a quick peek at my Yelp iPhone app, determined I should go with the pulled pork sandwich. You guys didn't let me down.  I've been something of a pulled pork aficionado for several years now. I've been eating it all across this great nation of ours and have made a pretty good version myself. This one is pretty fantastic and stacks up to the best I've had down south. Perfectly smoky (you can see it in the pink of the flesh and the deep dark bits from the crust), not too dry, perfectly seasoned, just a touch on the sweet from the smoky goodness of the slow bbq. This pork WINS. And they don't put any bbq sauce on it? THIS IS WHAT I'M TALKIN ABOUT! I thought it needed a slight kicking up so I tossed on some of the vinegar hot sauce that was on the table. That bite instantly took me back to Alabama. It was perfection. Their steak fries were also some of the best I've ever had. I didn't really need to dip them in the spicy bbq sauce, but I couldn't help myself. Oh, and the lemonade, while it seems steep at $3.50, was fresh and delicious. I'm glad I only ordered the half sandwich, as if I'd ordered the full, I'd need to be wheeled away a la Hannibal Lecter. I don't know what took me so long to haul my ass into Fat Willy's, but if make my way back there more frequently, there'll be a lot more to haul back!

Yesterday, on our third visit we had several challenges, they are as follows: While my wife was purchasing our movie tickets across the street, I walked in and was greated by a nice lady (no name tag) with short dark hair, wearing a head band. I told her I wanted to sit outside, pointing out the table I would like to sit at along the flowers. She said ""How about this one because that one you want is dirty"" pointing out a table along the brick wall in a darker corner. I said ""I really like this one"" pointing again to the one I wanted. She replied ""Ya, well we really have a system here"" and pulled out a chair indicating i should sit at the table she wants instead. I replied ""Well I have a system too, its called - The Customer Is Always Right System"". She said ""Ok, and then abruptly started cleaning the table i wanted, I told her she didnt have to that I would wipe it off but she continued. Her attitude could still be felt but only mildly at this point. It felt good at the moment but I came here to eat not fence with staff about where I am ""required"" to sit. A moment later I feared tainted food for my comment, but such staff responses are really unprofessional. I will not tolerate having to ask for something more than twice at any establishment.   My Server: Was a nice young man (no name tag either). I started by telling him about the table request and apologized for any confusion we may have caused internally. He was polite, he hinted that he heard about the table request discussion i had with the other lady. However, he also went on telling me there was no need for an apology. Being that he was a co-worker I was sort of expecting lousy service if he was her buddy and taking her side. Nevertheless, his service was excellent and the sole reason I am giving this establishment just 1 star. His name was patrick, I got his name before handing over a 33% tip.  Cleanliness: The outside tables are made of wood pannels with quarter inch gaps between each pannel, you will notice many food particles from previous patrons if you happen to look down through it. They leave a roll of paper towels on the table, expesive I'm sure but great for the customer. However, our roll of paper towels had a smudge of BBQ accross the top (from a previous patron) where you would hold it to peel one off. This smudge could be noticed even by Stevie Wonder (for a lack of better words). It would require them tossing out an almost brand new roll I am sure, but the customer can't help to think ""Was that thier reason for leaving it?-Cost?"" If they are using these types of cost containment tactics out in the customer area, what kind of short cuts are they taking in the kitchen? This is what the customer thinks about out at your tables. Product: Rip Tips - The sauce was good! While rib tips do usually contain some fat, the rib tips we had contained about 25% fat! Note to Management: If you do indeed have a system that lets your wait staff dictate where your guests sit, then I know longer wish to eat at your establishment. A table change request should be easily accomodated in your industry, and it should be accomodated on the first request, not the second.  In closing, while I noticed your business fluorished the last couple of months. However, yesterday I noticed that school was apparently back in sessionand when the huge theater across the street has $6 Tuesdays, your place was still 70% empty. This clearly indicates your product alone is not going keep your establishment full. You will have to improve your customer service if you want to most out of this quarter and the most out of your business. I suggest your entire staff (including yourself) re-train with Patrick for at least one week. Some times you have to get back to the basics of customer service. Had you been doing your own job as a Manager, this post would have never occurded. If your establishment has more than one Manager you are then welcome to multiple my disappointment by your number of Managers you have staffed. You have all failed (except for Patrick) your customers expectations of good customer service and cleanliness. I await your response. Respectfully Submitted, Angelo ""The Legend""",0.9921,0.834,0.112,0.054,0.4596227581941867

Fat Willy's serves a broad range of bbq-style entrees and sides.  They routinely offer guests a choice of sauces ranging from original to hot to vinegar based.  Surprisingly, the vinegar based striked/struck? my liking strongest.  The coleslaw was light and had a unique zest that we later attributed to cilantro.  My pulled pork was slightly dry, but this was easily remedied with a generous helping of hot giardianera and bbq sauce.  The half sizes are decent sized portions if supplemented with a side order of whatever suits your fancy. The service was pleasant, but I was disappointed to learn that there was a $3 surcharge for splitting an entree...  Only in America are customers discouraged from splitting an overly large entree.  And we wonder why we muffin right out of our pants... Sidenote:  If you're looking to sample their brisket, make sure you get there shortly after 5 (as it is only available after then) and they tend to run out fairly quickly.",0.9418,0.843,0.118,0.039,0.621212905452036

Tables are draped with cow print tablecloths, walls are covered with swine memorabilia, and ironically, dinner is served on plates that diagram the anatomy of the four legged friend you are about to eat. It's kinda like watching workout videos while devouring a pint of ice cream. Or listening to Danity Kane.  The food is as advertised. The BBQ gets high marks - however, personally I put a lot of emphasis on how the sides and sauce complement the main meal. In other words, what would Boston Market be without its sides? Fortunately, the sides and sauce are the Pippen to the Jordan. The vinegary coleslaw impressed (now second on my list to KFC). Baked Beans were also good but could have used either more tangyness or sweetness. The sweet potato w/ brown sugar butter is delectable. They placed three styles of BBQ Sauce (hot, original and vinegar) on our table which were all very good. Top it all off with a refreshing sweet tea, and you are good to go.  The atmosphere is a great place to grab a meal (or a drink - they do serve 40oz's you know!) with friends. Highly recommended.  Note: They have a new outdoor patio which is pretty nice for the summertime. Props: I think it's almost standard (or should be) to serve a paper towel roll at BBQ joints. Fat Willy's is no exception.

My  son and I stopped in after a movie and the help immediately threw down some crayons so he could go to town on the butcher paper tablecloth. Sweet! The atmosphere inside is cool and casual, and the tables outside are perfect for enjoying the High Life with your BBQ. I tried the pulled pork sandwich and the 1/2 size was plenty big for me, especially since we were sampling sides. My son ordered the hand-dipped corn dog. To my eyes it looked just like a regular corn dog, save for the batter was a little thicker. It didn't seem to ""wow"" my son either. The pulled pork was okay, and the hot and tangy sauces are served on the side, which I liked. Was I disappointed? No. Have I had better pulled pork? Yes, a few times in recent memory. Our meals came with steak fries and we also ordered a couple sides to sample.  If you've got a Cilantro Haters List going on Yelp, you'll want to avoid anything slaw or salad-like here! The coleslaw was so full of cilantro we didn't care for it. My cucumber salad was so vinegary it initially made me cough with surprise, and was also a cilantro-lover's dream. I like cilantro alright, I even grow my own; but a little goes a long way, and there was way too much cilantro in their salads for my tastes. The side we both agreed was very good was the green onion & cheddar corn bread. Served with a sweet honey butter this is a must-order! Service was pleasant, but getting our check was an ordeal.

2009-06-01,4.0,"Messy, but good.  Of course, if you dont' get a little messy at a bbq joint, you're not going to a real bbq joint! Concluded a trip to Chicago with a Sunday lunch at Fat Willy's.  My friend had been meaning to check this place out for a while, and figured he'd take me and 8 of our friends along for the ride. AMBIENCE- not a flashy joint by any means, it's your typical bbq joint.  Because it was so nice, we ended up dining outside in their quasi enclosed area.  After playing tetris with the tables, we all got situated and sat down.  Not a whole lot to look at outdoors, as this place sits across the street from a movie theater, but still, a nice day more than made up for it. SERVICE- besides configuring our tables, our server was pretty awesome.  Knowledgable about the menu, and gave recommendations on how to best feed the 10 of us, our server was on top of her game.  Very attentive, and super friendly, I don't think we could have asked for a better server.  If only I could remember her name! MENU- typical bbq fare- ribs, chicken, pulled pork, brisket, rib tips, hot links.  A few things I wouldn't expect to see included salads, po' boys, and fried catfish, and a kids menu.  They also had some really good sounding desserts, including a brownie and ice cream dessert that takes 20-30 minutes to prepare.  Let me tell you, if you have room for dessert after you eat here, more power to you.  Sandwiches are about $8-$11 (depending on a half or full) and dinner entrees start at about $15. FOOD- to start our meal, we ordered some chilli cheese fries, and a half order of their mac n cheese (a half order is 1 pound of cheesy goodness).  The cheese fries were made with home made chilli, and were excellent.  The mac n cheese seemed to have a garlicy flavor to it, though someone was telling me it may have been one of the 4 cheeses that was giving it that flavor.  Still, it was a winner.  I can't imagine someone trying to eat 2 lbs of that. As for the wife and I, we did a half and half.  I got half of her brisket sandwich, and she got half of my pulled pork sandwich.  Both sandwiches were very generous on the meat, and came with a side of fries.  The brisket was pretty tasty, and the pulled pork was good, though a little on the dry side.  I really liked the horseradish sauce that came with the brisket.  Pretty much everyone ordered either one of those two sandwiches, though a friend did try the bbq chicken sandwich and said it was pretty tasty. OVERALL- definitely glad we came out here.  I've been craving some good bbq, and lord knows there is a lack of it in my area.  I'd say anyone that was craving bbq, should come out and bring their appetite.

After swearing to remember this place every time my boyfriend and I head to the Kerasotes theater across the street and are tempted by the bbq smells wafting about, we finally did. We went on a Friday night around 8pm and were seated right away, though it was a little crowded. The porch area is very nice and I'd like to come back and sit out there. The inside is very cute with pictures of pigs and pig knick knacks everywhere. Great bbq decor. Service was awesome as well. We thought we'd have to wait quite a while, but our server was quick to take our order, check up on us and give us the bill. That's all I ask for in good service, so two thumbs up. We started off with the jalapeno corn fritters which are a greasy, crispy, delicious little cornbread balls with corn and jalapenos mixed in. The dipping sauce was yummy, but I think I'd rather skip this one next time for the calorie guilt it left me with.  They have three kinds of bbq sauce on the table: vinegar, regular and hot. My favorite by far was the hot. I really like vinegar bbq sauce when it's done well, but this was not. The hot bbq sauce made up for it though. I ordered the half pulled beef brisket sandwich (HUGE, so a half was a good idea) with caramelized onions and horseradish sauce. It was good, but a little dry, so I had to sauce it up a bit with the spicy bbq. Not a big problem, especially since I liked that they didn't over sauce it to start with like some places do. My boyfriend had the half-rack of ribs dinner which included black bean soup (GOOD), a side, which we got corn (would have been better, but it was a bad ear of corn to start with so not too impressive) texas toast (too full to eat it, but it looked good) and coleslaw (vinegary and delicious!).

Everything is ok, with the pulled pork  and a surprisingly well prepared burger being standouts.  I like the sides more than the meats and find the sauce utterly forgettable. By Chicago standards, not too bad, but there really isn't a compelling reason to eat here when Honey 1 blows their bbq firmly out of the water.  The missing ingredient here is love...it feels like a business and a great bbq joint has an almost holy feeling to it, you can taste the passion in the food.  Not so much here. Prices have gone up dramatically over the years and the place has been expanded, so they must be doing well, but they lost me as a regular when they took the mac and cheese off as a side and started making you pay extra for it.  Yeah, it's pretty good, but it is not THAT good, folks. Lunch continues to be the best value, it's a nice place to hit on a weekday afternoon before catching a matinee at the movie theater across the street.  Not a bad place to stop if it's convenient, but if you are looking for really great bbq, make the trip over to Smoque or Honey 1.",0.9942,0.711,0.237,0.052,0.5478810541310541

2009-03-01,4.0,"In the days before fast food, electric stoves, and microwave dinners, people were expected to actually cook their food over an open fire--a tradition we still indulge in from time to time, but generally reserve for the summer.  Luckily, Fat Willy's provides a haven for such a practice all-year-round, specializing in the art of BBQ. In the winter, it's been customary for me to try to avoid going outside when I can--especially on brutally cold, windy days.  I feel like Fat Willy understood this, and that's why his Rib Shack provides a delivery service.  For a nominal fee, you can get an entire BBQ feast brought to your door.  That alone feels like Fat Willy punching Jack Frost right in the face.  What a delicious beating. Given my trend of using ribs as a litmus test when trying a new BBQ place, I had to get the half-rack of Baby Back Ribs.  The half-rack was hugely filling, not to mention totally meaty, bursting with smoked flavor, and smothered with Fat Willy's zesty BBQ sauce.  The sauce itself is enough to want to order anything off the menu.  This also came with coleslaw, Texas toast, a choice of side, of which I selected the corn on the cob, seasoned with Fat Willy's own seasoning rub.  As I said, a feast delivered for your joyous consumption. My roommate ordered the BBQ Brisket, which after trying some, I'd have to consider it as Fat Willy's holy grail.  It was amazingly tender, fairly juicy--as much as brisket can be--and came with a delicious dipping sauce.  Also, the portion is large, coming with the aforementioned coleslaw, Texas toast, and choice of side.  It's arguably the best beef brisket I've ever had the pleasure of savoring--just so you know.  (Sorry, Mom.) Needless to say, as a BBQ place, Fat Willy's gets my seal of approval.  Next time, I think I'll be torn between trying the St. Louis-Style Ribs--as to have a comparison between their rib samplings--or the meat-tastic BBQ Brisket.  Then again, the choice probably won't make much of a difference, since I foresee myself eating there again and again.",0.9776,0.829,0.113,0.058,0.5475721500721502

2008-11-03,4.0,"Fat Willy's. I finally found a bbq spot in Chicago that knows what their doing. I have eaten fare from the top spots in KC and Memphis (Central's, Jack Stack, Payne's, Neely's, Gates, etc), and Willy's uses the same cook steps as some of the best I've tasted. The bark on the ribs was the first tell tale sign, you know that this meat spent many hours in a smoker. Not like some of the other ribs I've had in the city where they are just ""cooked"" over wood smoke. The bright pink color of the meat when you pull apart the bones is pure bliss. The links were another nice suprise. They don't hang out in the smoker for hours, but they are very flavoful and have a crisp skin on the outside. The horseradish sauce that comes with them is very unique, and a perfect compliment of flavor. The 2 negatives here are the uninspired bbq sauce, and the very high prices. There are 2 types of sauce available, the standard sweet sauce and of course a spicy version. They both had a good tangy flavor, but lacked any depth compared to others I've had. I tend not to put a lot of sauce on my bbq so it didn't spoil the whole experience. When it comes to the prices, it is probably the most expensive meal I have ever had at a bbq joint. The quality here is very good, but doesn't justify the cost. It would be very difficult to get out of Willy's spending less than $15 per head, and actually be full. $25-$30 will get you a taste of everything you want and leave with your stomach happy. If you truly want bbq the way it was supposed to be smoked, try Willy's and you'll have a great experience.

Their rib servings are generous and quite tasty. However, the shrimp gumbo remains one of the main motivations for me to get out there. The shrimps are huge and most of the time chef would toss more than 4 (my shrimp meal rating is based on quantity).  Service is very random; sometimes it's efficient but most of the times it sucks.

2008-10-28,3.0,"mmm. it was good. I had the catfish, as I'm not a meat eater, which was very good. I really wanted the mac & cheese but I couldn't bring myself to spend $17 on it. Seriously? i could make it myself, and probably better for like $5. And you know, its 2lbs?! Thats enough for a family of 4! Anyway, the boyfriend really liked the ribs, but said they were comparable to smoke daddy's. And the food seems a little over priced. Anyway, I'd go back to eat, i'd like to try the cornbread.  Our waitress sucked though. And I was watching all of the other waitresses, and they all seemed great, so the sucky service is limited to the one girl we had. I think she was drunk. she took her dear sweet time to come to our table, so when she get there she just says ""our soup du jour is potato cream. Are you ready to order?"" umm ok hi? so we order, she brings our food out. then doesn't come back until we're done eating, and asks if the empty glass was my water. I say ""it was, but I took his"" (because you waited so f-ing long to come back!) then the boyfriend asks for another tea, and she goes over to get it, but asks some other girl to cover for her, then runs outside, around to the side of the building. Um ok. Then she waits another forever to bring us our bill, which is the wrong bill. So we send it back, after waiting forever again, and she comes back with something else and says ""did you have catfish and two soups?"" ""yes catfish, no soup"" umm ok. so our food came out correctly but she ordered it wrong? And then she comes back and says she can't change the bill because she already closed it out in the computer, so she just does the math to get our total, which she verifies with us at the table with a calculator (her math was wrong), and she's right next to my boyfriend, breathing her alcoholic breath on him. So finally she figures it out and we leave. But seriously? I think she was drunk.  anyway, bad service aside, the food was good.

My experience has been fantastic every single time, with the food being satisfying in portions, price and quality. It's a tad bit more expensive BBQ spot but is definitely worth it in terms of taste and quality. They also have a broad range of Burgers, Ribs, Tips, Brisket, Chicken, Etc. Being a bit of a BBQ Snob in terms of cooking my own as well as frequenting other joints with different styles (texas, kc, Memphis), I'd say this one of the best in the city. I have yet to try the Ribs (I'm more of a tips man) but i can say the burger, tips, brisket, pulled pork and chicken sandwhich were all good. Although I love the food and atmosphere there is one bad thing I must mention that I discovered recently while taking the girlfriends parents out once. Her father ordered the Hot Link basket, took a bite out of it and discovered it was actually a polish sausage. I confirmed the same thing and even with speaking the waitress (She denied it with a canned speech), I felt a little upset about the con.  Don't get me wrong I love this place but to charge in the area of 8-9 bucks for grilled polish sausages is a shame.

The noise level isn't too loud so you can easily carry a conversation with the person you're dining with. Their homemade decor is awesome. I love the paintings and drawings hung around the windows.  It's not a fine dining place, but it's casual enough that you can kick back, have a beer and enjoy some good bbq (without having to worry that the person next to you is staring at your face because you have bbq sauce smeared on it). We are totally drawn to this place because of their sliced beef brisket dinner plate (Note: they tend to run out, so do call them before stopping by). Actually, Tony is more drawn to them for that reason. We also love their coleslaw. It's not those straight from the bag chopped coleslaw overpowered with mayonnaise and vinegar. It's homemade, sliced and served just right. I'm totally hooked on their spicy bbq sauce. Slather that on their pulled pork sandwich or ribs and I'm in heaven! Their catfish po' boy is one of the best po' boy I've come to consume in Chicago. It's huge! I took a half of it home and it was still good the next day. Our daughter loves the mac and cheese there. It's all crusty & crunchy on top! As soon as you spoon your way into the plate, the cheese oozes out (Yummy!). Mia, wanted a taste of the bbq sauce and she was hooked herself. So we ordered her a  plate of their bbq rib tips. She was licking her fingers and savoring every bite of the rib tips.  Their service is great in the store and as takeout.

It really isn't soooo bad, but there are two better options minutes from there.  One issue, and kind of a biggy in my book. They have one of those 30 minute chocolate desserts that you order with your entree. We ordered an app, entrees, and dessert to split. We ate the app at a good clip (I eat really fast), entrees were set down, and as I was taking my first bite from my entree (literally) the server set down the chocolate dessert. He just said something like ""this came up really fast"" and set it down, walking away. The server didn't come back, so I carried the skillet back inside and said that I wasn't ready for the dessert. The server looked at me like I killed his dog.  Didn't he know that he had set dinner down seconds before setting down the dessert? If the brownie was ready, couldn't they just hold it until I am done and put the ice cream on later? It's a brownie, not a souffle or a molten chocolate cake, there is not a real time issue with a hot brownie. It was just such unbelievably stupid service that it became awkward.

I found the sandwich to be a very large portion.  The flavor was uneven.  Some bites had a tremendous smoky flavor, while others were very bland.  I did enjoy the fact that they came without BBQ sauce.  I always like to try the meat on its own and add sauce as I see fit.  I enjoyed the sauce, but I prefer a more vinegar based sauce on my pulled pork, as opposed to the tomato/red sauce that comes standard. The side slaw as okay.  Nice colors, but lacking in flavor.  The potato salad was really good, though. The prices were standard to what we've seen at other BBQ places in town.

Service: Our waitress was not attentive at all. I didn't want to scream or raise my voice to get her attention so it's a waiting game for me. I wanted a refill so bad but ended up without any refill. My soft drink tasted a bit flat but it didn't bother me too much. You would need to be a regular here to get her attention it seems(duh) because the two couple sitting next to me got all of her attention and got their Pepsi out of the can for guarantee taste. We waited for quite a long time for her to look our way and asked if we wanted the check. I asked her to put my rib tip in a doggy bag for me. I watched her took my plate from 1 side of the restaurant to the other side then walked outside to hand her other customer the check. Obviously, I was not pleased with seeing my plate doing that much traveling after it left my table. I do not like to waste food but I end up throwing away my doggy bag.

REALLY You'd think a place right across from a huge movie theater would be able to accomodate diners who are going to a show. I politely told our server, before we ordered, that our time was tight and we'd need to get out of there in an hour. He completely dismissed me, I think a grunt was his response. I have worked several years as a server, so I know such a request is not rude and can be accomodated in most cases.  Anyways, of course the service was SLOW as molasses. The guy just had a shitty attitude, basically ignored us, or was nowhere to be found. Our drinks were not refilled. The food took forever. And the other waitstaff was equally useless. We missed the movie of course! But the kicker at the end! After sitting w/ empty plates for 10 mins, I actually had to get out of my seat and find our server to get the check. Then I had to chase him down AGAIN to get him to process the credit card. What, you don't care if we pay, buddy?  As the food, it was just OKAY. The grilled cheese sandwich I had was really blah and lukewarm. The ribs were good, but the sauce was nothing amazing. The shrimp was quite delicious but WAY TOO expensive.

Hands down, the honey balsamic and the creamy parmesan are the clear winners here.  Both are obviously homemade and never disappoint.  I hear they have a new cilantro lime dressing on the menu that I'm dying to try.....I'm sure I'll love that one too. Moving on to the cobb:  This salad isn't for novices.  This thing comes with about 5 lbs. of toppings.  I'm talking bacon, grilled green onions, a whole chicken breast, bleu cheese, tomatoes, what appears to be an entire avocado, and so on.  Again, I opt for the honey balsamic and the creamy parm for this one as well.  You just can't go wrong with those 2.  The toppings are always extremely fresh, i.e., made to order.  Not like you get in countless restaurants where your salad clearly came from a subway-esque salad station.   Yes, this place has amazing BBQ.  That's been established.  But it also does kick ass everything else.  Their service has always been way above average,  and they deliver!   What more could you want?!",0.9953,0.791,0.157,0.052,0.5650191364191363

It also comes with toasted bread and cole slaw. Everything tasted great. The salad had mixed greens instead of iceberg, which is rare at a rib joint. The cole slaw was not too creamy and the sweet potato was excellent. Finally, the ribs, which are smoked, are meaty and cooked in a sauce with a little bite. They are fall off the bone.  Overall, a great first experience. We were seated just in time, because a huge line of people were waiting as we left. I could only imagine what the place will be like in the summer.",0.9946,0.799,0.201,0.0,0.5490196078431372

The service was wonderful and the best part might be the sweet tea (southern style) served in a large plastic cup and no silly flavors like mint or lemongrass.   I have to say, I truely love this place.",0.9921,0.672,0.301,0.027,0.5652005012531329

When you can taste the smoke hours later, you know it must be real.  We had ribs and also the seafood gumbo. Also rib tips since, yes i never had rib tips. I don't eat meat often but this will definately be that spot to go when i really need tasty dead flesh and ok with eating it.  First of, i was skeptical. When we came in the waitstaff was no inspiring confidence. Oh good, hipster/punky hair colors staff will serve me bbq! Right...  But they were awesome! Really really nice, never messed up anything and totally made our day. I love the roll of paper towels you get with your food :) The ribs were sooo yummy and fell off the bone. There is that smokey flavor that I believe comes from the real wood vs. the bottle. Maybe thats what some people thought was the burnt stuff. Also while rib tips some were tough, other pieces were sooo good.  My shrimp and stuff gumbo was ok, benefit was the plump shrimp on it. Corn bread was a bit dry. I don't like butter so I didn't try it.  We were too stuffed for dessert so didn't get any. Nothing really bad happened. There is a big outline on the wall of a pig with all the parts marked as to where different things come from. So you'll learn as to where your meat comes from.

I'm sure the burgers are easily overlooked here.  Everyone was gnawing on saucy ribs and pounding down pulled pork, guzzling those tasty signature drinks, Hogaritas! The meat patty was perfectly seasoned, cooked med-rare/medium and huge! More than substantial, hanging heavy off the bun, super fresh accompaniments, big delicious steak-cut fries,  and HANDS DOWN my favorite coleslaw in the city-  not too: heavy, wimpy, sweet, cabbage-y.  Just crisp, clean, light.   A great little salad! FAt Willy's also features Goose Island's seasonal brew, the HARVEST ALE.  I had only two with that bad-ass burger and have craved an ice-cold six-pack ever since!

2007-10-01,2.0,"I didn't have a great time at Fat Willy's. When we first arrived, we were to be seated at a table that needed to be wiped off - not really a big deal. Instead of walking us there, the hostess simply waved us to that table, which I think is rude. As we started to sit down, a different employee came over and said there was another party waiting for this table, and we'd have to wait for ours. No apology, nothing. There were 3 other tables opening up, so I knew it wouldn't be long, but it wasn't a great start. Our server sprayed our new table with Windex and gave a cursory wipedown before giving us our menus. Moments later I picked up the drink menu and discovered barbeque sauce on the back of it. And still on the table. I know BBQ is messy; all the more reason to actually wipe down the tables really well. I couldn't totally fault the server, though - we were outside, and about half of the hanging lights were burnt out and we could barely see our food.  I ordered a Hogarita. Previous to this moment, I had never met a margarita or a variation on a margarita that I didn't like. However...take Welch's grape juice, stir in tequila and some limeade: badda-bing, you got a hogarita. Yuck. And I'm pretty sure they used table salt or a blend including table salt to rim the glass. Somewhat discouraged, I attempted to order the sliced brisket. It was 7:30pm, so I'd already cleared the first hurdle, as the menu states in BIG LETTERS that it's only available after 5pm. Unfortunately, they had already run out. I got the half chicken basket instead. Thankfully, the chicken was the best thing. It was tender, juicy, and it didn't even need the BBQ sauce, which was also pretty good. The grilled toast was inedible. Just awful. It was Texas toast that had some kind of garlic-butter sauce smeared onto the center of it and then grilled, but it got WAY too much smoke. Someone else here mentioned the taste of 'burnt smoke' - that was it. And the cornbread was dry and bland...not even the weak honey butter could save it. The steak fries that came with it were plain and uninspired, but it all didn't matter; the chicken was really the star of the show.  At this point, our server became inaccessable. Not absent, because we saw him and he saw us, but he just didn't come over. Like, at all. Until we flagged him down. Loudly. For some reason, we decided to get dessert. To my dismay, there were no fruit pies. We got a small slice of the chocolate pecan pie, and it was WAY too sweet, with a lot of inexpensive chocolate chunks on the bottom. I know that last comment makes me sound like a chocolate snob, but at $6 per small piece of pie, I really expected something better. Handy that it's right outside of the movie theatre, but there was nothing about this place that made me want to come back again.",0.8457,0.821,0.095,0.084,0.47022770073617515
2007-09-10,3.0,"I went with a date last week to Fat Willy's for some BBQ. This was my first time there and granted I haven't tried everything on their menu so I am not to be considered an expert Fat Willy's reviewer... but here were my impressions. We ordered and split a pulled pork sandwich with fries, I ordered a beer (Hacker-Pschorr) and she ordered what I think was a margarita. The sandwich was quite tasty -- but certainly not the best that I have ever had. The fries were mediocre, they were cooked well, not too soft, not too crispy... but they lacked any flair of any kind, taste-wise. The beer selection was totally uninteresting, with mostly domestic bottles and uninspired common beers like Heineken, Sam Adams, Goose Island, etc. While I found the idea of having 40's with BBQ -- the choices were poor... Miller Lite, Bud and MGD... they could at least put a King Cobra or a Colt 45 in there for shits and giggles. I was happy to see Maker's Mark on there though... which does a lot to make up for their less-than-interesting beer menu. It looked like their mixed-drink menu was kind of interesting, however. The service was good, our waitress was talkative (but not annoying), kind, courteous and as prompt as she needed to be most of the time. Overall, I liked eating at Fat Willy's... but given the choice I would certainly go elsewhere. I much prefer Smoke Daddy to this place, so if you're looking for BBQ I'd head to Smoke Daddy... but if you're looking for the best place that is close to the movie theater (City North 14)...

I wanted something quick before the $6.00 Tuesday movie special right across the street at City North 14. My first impression was what a great authentic low key BBQ place atmosphere. It could have been in Memphis, or Abilene, or Raleigh. Comfortable outdoor space and casual indoor seating, too. I was happy to discover it was full-service (unlike Smoque where you have to stand in line.) I chose one of the very reasonable lunch specials. $6.50 for a half-sandwich, fries and two sides. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and mac 'n cheese and cole slaw with the sandwich. And I'm here to tell you, that was a lot of food! The mac' n cheese was about ten times ""cheesier"" and better than that boxed variety we're all familiar with.  The cole slaw which is vinaigrette based rather than mayo/creamy was excellent. It had some unique flavor that really added to its appeal, and I wracked my brain trying to figure out what it was. The same slaw also shows up on the pulled pork sandwich: an nice touch. The meat was not that goopy sweet pulled pork which is so common, but incredibly flavorful smoked meat with just enough sauce. And again, the half sandwich is plenty filling. Overall the experience was authentic, flavorful, and a great value. With a couple glasses of sweet tea, the bill was around $10.00 with tip. a great mid-day combo with a $6.00 movie (and I skipped the free popcorn.)

It had that smokey flavor, but it definately wasn't overdone by any means. I dipped it in some sauce (the maple syrup jars of BBQ sauce have got to go, Willy) and it was heaven.

Unfortunately, though, the food seemed to fall short for me.  I had the lunch special ($6.50, great deal) half a pulled pork sandwich and a cup of chili.  The chili was not bad, but much to ketchupy and not nearly spicy enough for my tastes.  The half sandwich was surprisingly large, but of below average quality.  The meat was dry and a bit stringy--not in the good pulled pork fallapartyness, but in the bad way--and the sauce was kind of bland.

Service was friendly and attentive.  She definitely knew when to come and go without being intrusive and was helpful in helping choose between items.

I was trying to give recommendations to a fat willy's virgin the other day, and it went something like this:  You can't go wrong with the pulled pork sandwich.  But the chicken sandwich is pretty good if you're in the mood for it.  But then I have a friend who swears by the beef brisket, so you might want to try that.  The sandwiches are huge, but if you get the full size you can take it home and it reheats really well.  I've been dying to try the gumbo, but haven't gotten around to it, but I know that their chili is quite good.  And their cornbread is packed with green onions and served with honey butter, delivering a perfect balance of salty and sweet, so you have to make sure you order a side of that if your meal doesn't come with it.  Oh!  But I finally tried the corn fritters the other day and they were perfectly fried balls of corny goodness.  I tried the half chicken dinner once, and still cannot believe that they serve a full chicken platter.  And the bbq sauce!  The bbq sauce!  At first I couldn't understand why they have small amounts of bbq sauce to go listed on their menu.  Now I take pints of the spicy stuff home to bathe in.  Ah, and I've never made it to dessert, despite my tendency to overeat at the first sign of pie, but it looks incredible.  If you can eat a full meal and still polish off a dessert, you will be my hero. The staff here is incredible --- unlike the rest of us, they seem to actually really love their jobs, and are passionate about bbq and its accoutrements, giving you a knowing smile when you say, ""why yes, I would like a can of PBR to start off this meal.""",0.9971,0.808,0.181,0.012,0.6231231231231231

I've seen countless movies at City North and I'd thought about going here before, but never actually made it. Once I made it as far as getting inside only to realize there was a 45 minute wait and my friends and I had a movie to catch, so we bowed out. This morning I bowed in. Before seeing Children of Men (which was incredible) on Saturday, Zachary, Ginny, and I tucked into some awesome barbecue. Z and I both got the pulled chicken sandwich and Ginny got a chicken plate. We were already hungry, but the smells at this place are phenomenal. Z and I also split a plate of the 4 mac and cheese. Our food came out lightning fast for something we thought would take awhile. The bread that the sandwich was served withstood the sauce and the spicy mayo (which I thought I would hate since I hate regular mayo, but I ended up loving) slathered on and didn't fall apart. Because I was on such a bbq kick, I went to Smoke Daddy yesterday and they didn't even compare to how good F.W.'s is, and I used to be enamored of them.

2006-11-20,5.0,"I fucking love barbeque, and not that Weber grilling people call barbeque, I mean smoked and slow cooked all day long barbeque. Because to me barbeque is the meth of foods. Because it's just the best way to cook food. Can you name a better way to cook meat? Probably not, and if you did you're wrong. Because smoked food is king. But the problem is that for real good barbeque, you generally have to go to the south. But there is a gleam of hope for us who's up north, and it has a charming name and it's Fat Willy's. I had their soup which was white bean and sausage, and that was fucking amazing. And for the main meal I had half slab of ribs and half of a chicken. And fucking A, it was too damn good. The problem here is that the meat is the best barbeque in the city, but the sauce isn't the best in the city. But while there's better barbeque sauce, the meat more than makes up for it, because to me the meat is more important than the sauce, but not everyone thinks that. They give you ridiculous portions, but some how it's still not enough because it's so good. I ate everything and tried to get every bit of meat off the bones, not because I was hungry. But because I needed it. Even after I finished the large meal. I thought to myself, ""I know I'm full and I shouldn't eat more. But if I had more food in front of me I would eat it, because I need it."" Just now I thought I could eat more of it. And sure some people might think that barbeque isn't addictive as meth, and I'm just a fat guy who likes food too much. But those people are probably vegan and never had good barbeque. And the only people who couldn't like barbeque are communist vegans who hate freedom. And I'll be damned before some meat hating ruskie takes away my delicious smoked ringed meat. I want to buy a smoker now, and eat nothing but slow cooked delicious meat with tasty smoke rings. I used to love Chicago Rib House, but they're dead to me now.

These are REAL ribs--- or should I say real Barbeque.  Over the years, the food quality is still there, the service usually sucks, but the servers try hard... just can't seem to get it together.  The atmosphere is a bit bizarre, but thats OK it fits the place.  Prices ARE NOT CHEAP!  Expect to pay $60 bucks for a couple of  rib dinners and a few beers.  Despite it all- you can't beat the BBQ flavor this place offers.  They also have the BEST corn dogs available in this city!!!   Its a MUST TRY.",0.8663,0.851,0.094,0.055,0.36726190476190473

I'm a fan of beer with my BBQ so if you're like me, be sure to order a $1.50 PBR can since they don't let you bring in your booze.

My wife's rib tips were meaty and carefully prepared, again not too smoky, not to saucy.  Her girlfriend ordered the BBQ chicken, which is a huge half bird, extremely tender.  She picked the bones clean.  Her husband went with the pulled pork with was expertly cooked and never dry.   The four of us split a serving of the 4 cheese mac and cheese, which was phenomenal.  Drinks were sweet tea and lemonade, both homemade.   We're going back soon, I'm sure, at least to get the homemade brownie.  A huge chocolate brownie with a mountain of vanilla ice cream and whipped cream.  Plus they have many sandwiches that I need to try.",0.9824,0.845,0.142,0.012,0.5863492063492063
