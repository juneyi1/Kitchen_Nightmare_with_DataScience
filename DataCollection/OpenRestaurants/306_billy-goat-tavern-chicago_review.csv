2017-08-30,5.0,"One word---Amazing!!!!    We were walking back from the lakeshore and headed down the steps to Hubbard and looked back and saw the sign to the Billy Goat Tavern.  I had seen the features on it in Chicago tv and of course the SNL skits and had to try it for myself.   The BGT is everything it is supposed to be. When you walk in and head down the stairs, it is like you have time traveled back 40 years.  Its divey (in a good way). There are old pictures and newspaper articles up and the menu is like the one used in an old concession stand.   I ordered a double cheeseburger and chips.  Indeed it is true. No fries, only chips!!!!  My wife got the grilled cheese sandwich. The grill is right behind where you order and the cooks are calling back your order just like Akyroyd/Murray did on SNL.    I would have added bacon if I knew it was an option but I was NOT about to ask!!!! :).  The food came quick and we sat at the bar.  The bun is big and we got to put our own toppings on. This speeds up the process which is a nice touch.  We sat at the bar and ordered a couple of Billy Goat Lagers.   The Lager and the dark are made by Pabst and the Lager was light and very refreshing and only $4 for a glass.   While we sat at the bar, a bachelorette party mixed of old and young came in and ordered 9 Horny Goat drinks and the bartender whipped them up and served them quick.  Overall the experience was top notch in two ways: 1). The history and the legend of the place speaks for itself and it lived up to its reputation.  2). The food was relatively inexpensive, tasty, filling but not uncomfortable, and just what we needed for a midday snack.  We will definitely be back!!!!",0.97,0.916,0.079,0.005,0.43792162698412695

They have other food options, but almost everyone there gets the burger. The burger itself is nothing special, but the bun is pretty good. What I love about Billy Goat is that the toppings are buffet styled, so you can add whatever you want, in whatever quantities. I usually go ham on them all, and then grab extra pickles for  a side. They have ketchup, mustard, sliced and diced onions, chip pickles and relish They also have a bar, with standard variety of drinks, and of course many TVs, playing the Cubs if they're on.

Beefy, juicy, cheesy goodness in between what appears to be a cafeteria roll. There are condiments you can dress your borger -- not a typo -- up with. The price is budget-friendly.

Unfortunately the hype dissipated shortly after I walked down the stairs into the seating area.  The place looks like your average dive bar with the exception of having numerous, priceless photos of Chicago legends (big ups to SNL for really putting this Goat on the map), alas the food did not compare to the pure relics that this facility held. My double cheezborger was a bit dry and the fact that there were no fries disappointed me. The price is pretty outrageous too, but I suppose people are coming here more for the tourist attractions rather than a 5 star meal.  If you haven't gone here before, by all means, stop what you're doing and take a bite out of 20th century Chicago history here, but I don't think that this is a place I could go to frequently when there are better competitors.

Look up their history of this place and you'll see you get exactly what they are known for. This is defiantly a Chicago landmark and staple to check out. Food: Your basic fast food cheeseburger ordered up as a single, double, triple, and so on in a Kaiser roll. The patties are thin so I suggest making it a triple because of the thick Kaiser roll and anything else can get lost with in that roll. After you pick up at the counter you can then dress it up on the next counter with pickles, onion, and your basic condiments mustard and ketchup. DO NOT TAKE THE KETCHUP AND MUSTARD TO YOUR TABLE!!! They will yell at you and take it back to the counter. Brew: They have your standard full bar with your basic beers. They also have their own beers on tap, a dark beer and a lager.

Since it appeared to be too late, we said to just make 1 of them a double, but instead, the lady proceeded by saying ""you know what I'll just make them all doubles"". Okay.. what happened to customer is always right?! Next thing we know, we were eating the driest, most flavorless burger in history.  She also messed up 2/3 double cheese burgers. My friend ended up with single cheese and I ended up with a triple cheese... In N Out and Shake Shack are so much better, AND they'll accept card.

2015-09-28,5.0,"The Billy Goat Tavern is such a cool place to stop by just to dabble in a part of Chicago's history. There are other locations throughout the city, but this is the original. My friend and I visited because we wanted to go for a quick bite to eat before we continued to walk around in the city some more. The ambience is divey in nature, but I can see why the locals and tourists alike love it. It has a small, yet comfortable interior and you will feel like you're a part of the place once you settle in. I really dig the Chicago attitude and personality coming from the workers. They're really friendly, and as a visitor I appreciated that. If you're having a hard time deciding what to get, the norm is the cheeseburger. As they say, ""double is the best, and triple if you're hungry!"" Which is true because if you get a burger with a single patty, it'll be thin. I got the standard double cheeseburger, which didn't take too long to prepare. The condiments are right next to the counter where you pick up your burger. The double cheese burger was pretty good. It's not a gourmet burger, but it's definitely a solid burger. I didn't want anything too over-the-top, just a simple city burger. The Billy Goat Tavern didn't fail to deliver on that aspect.  This place is a great stop for casual lunches. You can also grab a few brews with some of your friends and sit at the bar and watch the game on TV and just engage with everyone and everything around you. Perfect little dive bar to just kick back.  I feel like this place is underrated. It's rich in history and to top it off, they serve some great burgers...

Chips are regular, plain chips. The meal was nothing memorable but at least it was cheap. Service: The staff was very friendly though I felt rushed despite it being empty (but I think that's intentional) and the burger didn't take too long.

It was probably one of the worst burgers I've had.   I actually would take McDonald's burger any day over Billy Goat Tavern's.   As soon as I walked in and made my way over to the food counter, I was rudely greeted by a bartender asking if I'm going to order anything from the bar.  I told him I will think about it and walk over to the bar after I order my food first, but he was rudely insisting I should order soon.  I didn't understand what the rush was, since the restaurant was near empty when I arrived.  Once I placed an order for double cheeseburger at the food counter, I placed an order of lager with the bartender.  Again his responses were very rude and condescending.   So after all this, I finally got my order of famous Billy Goat Tavern's Cheesborger, but as mentioned before, it was one of the worst burgers I've had.    It was just dry, no juice in the meat, no flavor, and just plain pitiful.

Apparently, for a restaurant whose capacity can hold over 300 people, the greed of the restaurant decided they'd rather have more tables than stalls for the restrooms. Only two bathrooms in the whole place, one for men, one for women. Then, they have the keg room in the same hall as the bathrooms, and it's a narrow hall! So as you're waiting, you're being pushed aside with someone carrying kegs! But that's not the end of the rant. Whilst waiting, an overly aggressive and completely intoxicated woman, just starts shoving her way through the line, cutting in front of everyone, I stop her and tell her to go to the back of the line, she then says no, and tries pushing through me and my friend. I will not back down, and then her goliath biker gang husband comes up to intimidate me, she then starts threatening me, saying we can go outside. What a nut job! I don't let her cut, and her husband leads her to the men's room. All the while, no one says anything, casting a blind eye, even the employee, coming between us the whole time, changing kegs. In the entire place, I didn't see any security, just someone who would have at least cared that a patron was being threatened and harassed. Now, the bathroom was totally disgusting, with two inches of standing water. Leaving the restaurant, I see the same woman with a fresh beer, now this shows me how irresponsible the establishment is, serving a woman who is so drunk she can barely form sentences, and she's still being served alcohol. Shame on you Billy Goat. And continuing with the establishment's absolute indifference, I see the man who was changing kegs, outside smoking a cigarette, I tell him about the bathroom needing attention. He tells me ""I can't even get in there"" I stand back, shocked at his response, then I retort, ""Maybe a manager can?"" Then he tells me, he's the manager, which shocks me even more.

The cheeseborgers are nothing to write home about, though I do appreciate that they grill the bun. I don't appreciate that the double only has a single cheese between the patties, ""Sup?"" says my tongue, after earlier saying, ""Sup?"" because I hadn't yet put catsup on it. I usually don't put catsup on my burger, but my tongue demands it here. So I'll give the food a 2, as in a solid Yelp ""meh."" On the other hand, I love the history of this place. Most people will recount the Saturday Night Live skit, in which the original Not Ready for Prime Time Players put this place on the map and enabled it to expand to other locations. (Why, oh why, would someone want this food in another environment?) The history I love even more is that of the crusty old reporters coming across the street from The Tribune for a beer before, during or after their day, or even from the Sun-Times, which was around the corner until The Donald put his name on the biggest masthead in the city.  And so, every couple years, at 10:30 on a cold winter weeknight, if you're in the neighborhood, it's still worth eating a burger chased by a cheap beer while sitting at the nearly-empty bar here. The history will swirl around you, and maybe a ball- or puck-game will accompany you on the TV.

Halfway through the burger, I ditched the top half of the bun and found that I enjoyed it a lot more that way. The meat itself was well seasoned and it didn't require condiments -- although I did put a little ketchup on there. Overall, it's a decent spot for a quick and cheap bite. If you're a fan of SNL or just tourist attractions, I recommend coming by cause it's pretty cool to see.

Seating 2/5  Not very many tables, but definitely has the family eating feel. Ambience 4/5 Lots of history on the walls.  Walk around to check out pictures of old Chicago figureheads, newspaper clippings, and the like.  Fortunately, they do a great job venting this place out, and the place never gets smoky from the grill.  All the old timer regulars are really nice if you get a chance to hang out at the bar for a beer. Service 5/5 I don't know where the owner is from so I'm not going to guess and sound racist.  Their menu is very limited, and they will suggest the Double ""cheezborger"" you should get it.  Also, don't order anything that they don't have.  See below. We also got a shot of Jameson from the bar, the guy also gave us a free glass of beer to wash it down.  Called it ""Midwest hospitality"".   Food 4/5 The burger actually aren't that bad.  Thin patties that are grilled fresh and never sit under a lamp because there is always a line of people ordering food.  Recommended (by me and them): Double cheeborger.  Don't order fries because they don't have it, and don't order pepsi.  If you wanna mess around, order a hamburger with fries and a pepsi.  Then he'll call you a wise guy.  It's a fun time if you bring a group. The ribeye steak burger is good, and I always get the triple cheezborger....cuz I'm fat. ::sobs:: Overall 4/5 Definitely come here if you want a light lunch.  The experience is awesome, and it's fairly close to Navy pier and all the other cultural spots in Chicago.   Double cheezborger.  Classic.",0.9948,0.802,0.164,0.034,0.4511819970153304

Just take the stairs off Michigan down to this iconic cave. Cheap in prices but not in personality, the Billy Goat Tavern pretty much encapsulates America at its best -- in-your-face service, greasy but tasty food, simple pints and wisecracks galore. Beers are $3.50 each (for either the Billy Goat lager or dark) and a double cheezborger (just wait till you hear that word being yelled twenty times in a row) is less than $5. Hoisted on a large but not-overpowering roll, the double cheezborger is two fairly thin but well-seasoned patties, drippy American cheese, pickles and onions that will bring you back to the days of being a kid in an old-school diner. You'll dine surrounded by tattered mirrors and hastily thrown up autographed photos of several famous Americans, from movie stars to politicians. Legend has it that the owner of this place visited Wrigley Field in 1945 with his goat and wasn't allowed in because the goat stunk. As a result, he allegedly ""cursed"" the cubs and swore they wouldn't win another World Series again until the goat was allowed back.

(That said, though, the burgers actually are good. They're diner burgers, but sometimes that's just what you need, you know? And they're ready super-fast.) Another thing - if you go here, do not expect to be catered to or coddled. Do not expect to be given time to stand around and consider what you want (you shouldn't have to do that anyway, because you're probably just going to get a double CHEEZBORGER whether you like it or not). Do not expect to be served like you would in any other restaurant, because the Billy Goat is not like any other restaurant. Bottom line? Just have a sense of humor.

On a recent visit I was in a hurry for lunch and I decided to give Billy Goat a try, its slightly hidden under Michigan Ave, actually lower Michigan Ave. Walking in you almost feel like you are in an underground parking garage until you see the bright neon light advertising Bill Goat Tavern. When you open the door and walk down a few stairs you realize you are in a true historic, dive bar. Seriously not much looks like it has changed since they first opened this location, especially the sounds of the staff. If you get sick of hearing the same words yelled over and over this is not your place since the staff tends to yell our the orders. cheezeborger, cheezeborger!  The process is simple, tell them what you want. I opted for a Double Cheeze, and a Pepsi. Do not ask for Coke, you will be greeted with ""No Coke, Pepsi!"" The same goes for Frys, they only have chips. Once your order is up, usually within a minute or two you can top it however you like, but be warned this area can get crowded so move along. The burger I have to admit was actually pretty good, however the patties were a little bit thin, which made me glad I went with the double. The bun was not a cheap bun either it seemed to be from a local bakery and better quality.  While dining I did happen to hear the nephew of one of the owners telling another diner the history of the Billy Goat Tavern, which was pretty interesting.

Yes, the Billy Goat really exists, and is a Chicago legend.   The address often stated for the original location can easily be misleading.   To be more precise, the address is for the building that is in front of the stairway that leads down to the Billy Goat, which hides in the darkness of Lower Wacker Drive, along the Chicago River. The ''Goat' started in 1934, when William ""Billy Goat"" Sianis purchased the Lincoln Tavern, near Chicago Stadium, for a $205 check that bounced (he made it good on opening weekend). They moved to their present location in the early 60's, and have presided over the netherworld of Chicago's multi-layered streets ever since. The location, directly underneath the Wrigley Building (yes, that Wrigley) was sorta, kinda half-way between the offices of the Chicago Tribune, and the Chicago Sun Times, and thus many a print reporter, and later, other media folks (including me) made BG one of the premier Windy City media hangouts.

I'm not a fan of cheese, so I opted for the steak and egg the first time around.  Surprisingly, it was really good.  Great breakfast sandwich.  Steak is thinly sliced and that egg adds such flavor to it.  The bun that the meat and egg is meshed with is soft and toasty as well.  Although they only serve chips here with your sandwiches, I believe these sandwiches would go great with some steak cut fries.  If you are looking for something to hold you over for a couple of hours, this is definitely worth a try.  The second time around, I added the bacon to the steak and egg and yea baby, this was definitely the missing piece, not that the sandwich lacked anything without the bacon.  However, bacon makes everything better, add that bacon!  It's funny when you come here early in the morning all you see are young and old men who are wearing their overalls and carrying their coolers.  This is definitely the spot for working men!  :)  If you are person that does NOT have a sense of humor and get offended easily, I'm not sure this place is for you.  They are quite the funny bunch here.  I love their bathroom signs as well.  Nanny for females and Billy for the mens.  Love it!  Can't wait til we're here again cause we're definitely gonna stop by this joint.",0.9966,0.764,0.188,0.049,0.5094850948509485

Now before I get the entire City of Chicago on my case, let me explain.  First, as other reviewers here have noted, it's hard to find.  You have to go down to the lower level of Michigan Avenue where it's perpetual darkness (even in the middle of the day).  When I went inside today around 12:30, it was pretty empty.  Having no idea what to order, the cashier told me to get the ""double cheezeborger"" (he was right).  That and a coke zero set me back just over $7 for lunch, but I should have listened to my friend and paired the burger with a beer instead (I later found out that the house beer is also nothing special). The burger is fairly simple: two quarter pound patties and two slices of American on a fairly sturdy white roll.  You can add as many condiments as you want near the register: sliced pickles, onions, relish, ketchup mustard.  When I finally put the sandwich in my mouth, it was pretty good, but not great.  I mean, I was satisfied, and the burger was equally parts greasy, filling, and tasty, but it felt like eating a slightly better version of a Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese.  Nothing special. You could say the atmosphere is part of the charm, but there really isn't any.  I guess it's more sentimental than anything else, at least from the view of an outsider like me.  Do it just to say you did it, just don't expect anything beyond the ordinary.  Bring cash.",0.9894,0.815,0.146,0.04,0.4871854432830043

I went to the Chop House, 3 different deep dish pizza places for comparison, and went to the Billy Goat twice. The burgers are weirdly addicting. Fuck the haters. I had some friends, originally from Russia and Norway but totally Americanized and now living in L.A. visit Chicago. They had no idea where to eat! I said, OHMAGOSH YOU GUYS, you must go to the Billy Goat Tavern! CHEESEBURGERS. EAT MANY OF THEM. I wasn't even sure if they'd listen to my suggestion. I just assured them that if I were the one going to Chicago I'd get my ass to the Billy Goat Tavern. Not only did they listen to my suggestion, but in the short time they were in town (also less than a week), they went THREE TIMES.

I came in, asked for a double cheezborger.  The clerk asked me to repeat what I just said.  A bag of chips in addition.  Once my burger was ready, the same woman who took my order noticed that I forgot the condiments and was very friendly in directing me to where the fillings were.  I thought it was a sudden change in personality from 'bleh' to happy; and I probably appeared lost so she was just being nice.  No tomatoes, bummer.  No lettuce either but that's OK with me.  Just a ton of onions, pickles, and of course: ketchup/mustard. At the bar, the featured drink was a horny toad for $6, but I opted instead for the Billy Goat Dark, their own dark on tap.  Low priced beer, I think it was a 12 ounce for under $4. Great place to hang out with the guys, and I think most ladies wouldn't mind it either.  Yes, most of the time, I'd like to have some fries with my burger, but the burger was good, and I came here knowing I'd only have cheeps.  There was Coke, I believe, but no Pepsi.  I don't normally drink soda so that didn't bug me either.  This is the original Billy Goat Tavern, after the Lincoln Tavern was moved here and renamed.  Might not be easy to find as it's under N.

So I thought if I went to the flagship location on the day of the Chicago Marathon (otherwise known as tired, confused tourist day), I could be scolded and derided like on television; or at least made to feel like I was trying their patience. Anything to make me feel ashamed for not even attending the race, let alone getting healthy enough to run it.  No such luck. Maybe the new generation of Sianisi are sick of the schtick. Or maybe a customer or two didn't get the joke and threatened the justice of a swift punch in the face so they cut it out. But, whatever the reason, the staff I've encountered here are nice. Not just dive bar nice. But nice restaurant nice. It's eerie.  Maybe it's reverse psychology. Maybe the server circulating, filling water cheerily, asking if you need another drink, and chatting up the ladies (ask Aise W. about her future husband) is meant to make you feel guilty. Like you did something wrong to be treated so well. Yeah, that's how they get ya! They are still mean. I mean, in a way. Or something.  Here's the problem, though. Without that signature rudeness, this place is kind of meh. The bar is flat-out old school and wonderful (Schlitz is the specialest their beer gets); but the grill - what they're famous for - is sort of lackluster. It's just a typical short-order burger joint. Being a vegetarian, I haven't tried the burger, but their grilled cheese is nothing that a veggietourist would write home about. At only $2.65, it's a good bargain for the area but it's just bread-and-cheese so I would hope it wasn't more.  And the chips, for the record, are a bag of chips (for $1.00). They have regular and barbeque. It's funny because I thought they were being classy and Anglicizing the fries. Nope. Just chips.  Still, there's a certain magic to wandering down off Michigan Avenue into a restaurant landmark. I wish I could write a negative review to show to the counter staff to rile them up to the point of insulting me, but I just can't. But, still, come on guys, I've been told I'm fun to make fun of.

2010-06-24,1.0,"This is a terrible restaurant. Oh my goodness it's so bad I get angry just thinking about it.  It's amazing all of these reviewers are giving it 4 stars, but admitting that the food is pathetic. Seriously, you're going to overlook the trash they serve for the ""history"" and non-existent charm.  I never knew anything about this place until I just recently looked at these reviews today. And I always wondered why the hell they have ""World Famous"" in their name after I tasted their food. So aside from the SNL stuff, this place is terrible. Let me count the reasons why. The patties are extremely small, and there is a LOT of bread, making for a very unbalanced burger. You pay over a dollar more with a double cheeseburger, but they don't give you an extra slice of cheese! There is no mayo to be found so the burgers are dry and tasteless, they only have pickes, relish, mustard and ketchup which you have to put on yourself. Do I work at this place? So why the hell am I constructing my own burger?  I only had the double, and I almost choked off the dryness from the bread, so I couldn't imagine how horrible the single is.  In addition, the man handling the cheese grabs blocks of it and plays with it without any gloves or washing his hands. Do an experiment. The next time you're at your fridge, grab a slice of american cheese and touch it in a couple of places. Then looked at it.  You see cheese is like Velcro and you'll understand why it's a problem some big, hairy, dirty looking man is touching yours without gloves or washing his hands. So you pay 5 bucks for a two patties that are smaller than McDouble patties, one slice of dirty cheese, and a huge bun. I also had the polish sausage and it was a cheap sausage split in half on a bun with nothing else and costs $4. and to make matters worst it had my stomach doing flips all day. So in conclusion, coming from a partial person with no biases because of nostalgia, I'm warning you not to bother. At all. The food is bland, expensive for what you're getting and it's not worth it.

2009-05-19,4.0,"So I'm walking around Michigan Ave. And I see a sign for the ""Billy Goat Tavern"" pointing under the street. Of all the lists I've made prior to heading for Chicago, I've totally forgotten about Billy Goat. I don't know why it's called the Billy Goat (something to do with baseball which bores the heck out of me), but I do know that it's a Chicago foodmark. The place is crappy. I mean, I understand nostalgia. But It was dirty and dim. Service wasn't horrible, but they are in a hurry to get your order, even if the place is empty. Old habits I guess? They had only a handful of customers inside. Putting everything together, I guessed that this place was way past its prime and didn't expect much from the burger. The double cheeseburger cost $5, which is what I had. I was pretty surprised by it. The meat was really tasty. Not strongly salted or anything, just a couple of plain patties bursting with flavor. The bread was a fairly solid kaiser roll. It's simplicity let the burger shine through. I added a couple pickles and some onions and ketchup at the very shady fixin's table (a bunch of open containers w/ pickles, onions and bottles of ketchup and mustard). I almost wish I hadn't, because they complicated a very straightforward and appealing burger. The burger was ready in minutes. I was in and out in no time.

2009-04-20,5.0,"Ohmigawd. Another venue I had not gotten around to reviewing. I had not been here in a while though, either. This is another review in which I get to spin off a fabled Chicago soccer history tale.  Maybe you were not yet born, but what genuinely turned Chicago's sports milieu from ""they'll blow it by the end"" to ""they just might do it"" was the 1981 Chicago STING soccer team. They had one key advantage insofar off the pitch which they didn't expect. In the summer of 1981, another sport (the supposed 'national pastime') decided it did not care about the people who provided it with its funding. It shut down in the middle of summer. In the summer of 1981, the other team sport which was still playing was soccer. And the STING were a very good team that season. The high point of the regular season was an afternoon when Wrigley Field {yes - that venue} was crammed with people for a STING v. New York COSMOS match (and bunky, Pelé was not playing for the COSMOS any more). Regulation ended 5-5. The STING won the match on the post-game shootout. {Guess from where ice hockey swiped the idea?} But I am certain you have *all* heard about the so-called ""Billy Goat curse"". Dating from 1945, when Sam Sianis, the owner of the Billy Goat, bought a ticket for his goat for the game that postseason between Chicago and Detroit. The goat was refused admission. After Chicago lost the series, Sam sent a telegram to Chicago's owner reading tersely, ""Who smells now?"" People, I shall inform you. Even if you are not spiritual or religious, *curses and hexes are real*. I have been involved with sports franchises which have been on _both_ ends of them - from the team to whom we couldn't lose [the Milwaukee WAVE] to the team we could not beat [the Atlanta ATTACK].  Something had to occur to mitigate the ""Billy Goat curse"". Somebody involved with the STING [Reports suggest it was _Kenny Stern_.] felt something needed to be done if (& when) the STING had a playoff match at Wrigley Field. The STING won their division and got a first-round bye. They would get the winner of the tie between the Los Angeles AZTECS and the Montreal MANIC. In the last-ever AZTECS match (I was in the stands at the Coliseum that night - oh; I had not mentioned this? Yeah, in September 1981, I was working for McDonnell Douglas Automation Company in Long Beach, CA.), they lost on a penalty kick to Montreal. The STING v. MANIC tie was best-of-three, with games 2 & 3 scheduled for Chicago. Montreal won their home game. So the STING were facing elimination in game 2, and having to play it in Wrigley Field. [I think Comiskey Park was hosting a rock concert that weekend.] What was done? If you visit this Billy Goat location, and go into the ""V.I.P."" {very insecure people} room, you will espy the photograph. The current [for 1981] Billy Goat was not merely allowed into the park, _he took the match's ceremonial opening kickoff_. Ding, ding, ding. The STING won the match. They humbled Montreal in game #3. Then they had another legendary tie versus the San Diego SOCKERS. You may have even glimpsed the photograph in which defender Frantz Mathieu, after sinking the game-winning-goal in the post-match shootout, was _carried off the field at Comiskey Park by fans_.  Then they defeated COSMOS in the Final in Toronto to win the entire Championship, and they got a parade down La Salle St. So what's left for this review? Frankly, the Billy Goat could probably get away with serving s**t on a shingle, and I would still give it five stars. Thankfully, it doesn't. The hamburgers are your standard slabs of beef, obtained from a local meat-packing house. Opt for the double. I specify Swiss cheese. Select a bag of potato chips. (I choose regular.) Go over to the condiment table and load up on the pickle chips, and apply the ketchup to the burger there and then. (I believe you should not put yellow mustard on a hamburger.) Pick out a table or *set* at the bar and order the house dark beer on draft. The burger is the greasy type. The kaiser roll surrounding it  is a good touch. The combination of the burger, chips, and beer is greater than its components. Pricing is less expensive than anything else within a quarter-mile of here. The ceiling is low because it is underneath a bank. Most of the photos in the venue are from much earlier than 1981. There are two television sets, subscribed to Comcast cable. They're generally tuned to sports. It will tune in a soccer game if you know about it. [It remembers its legacy also.] Transit options: There are a clutch of routes upstairs. You are five blocks from the Grand & State Red Line station. If you want to walk back to downtown, strolling on the lower level of Michigan and Wacker Drive makes it seem shorter than it actually is. There will not be capacity crowds down there either.",0.9936,0.88,0.085,0.035,0.39999647411412115

2008-02-25,4.0,"""Cheeborger, chip, and a Pepsi"" These wonderful words were first uttered by an SNL castmember in '75 (the great John Belushi), as he emulated the original 24 hour ""Chicago joint"" that I lovingly call Billy Goat's Tavern.  Like fans of rock & roll have a soft spot for Graceland, fans of Chicago still remember it's literary heyday when the names Irv Kupcinet, Mike Royko, and ""Chicago Daily News"" could be heard and seen inside this haven for sports writers, political commentators, beat reporters and the occasional budding actor.  It was a time when martinis equaled lunch, a cigar could be smoked at your seat, and 'cholesterol' sounded like a new carburetor cleaner.  First, THIS location IS Billy Goat's Tavern.  There is NO other location.  If it's not below Michigan Ave, it's not the same place.  It's like saying the Haunted Mansion in Disneyland is the same as Castle Dracula in Transylvania.   Second, IT'S NOT THE FOOD or the drinks, you go there for the history lesson.  Go there to visit the ghosts of independent thinkers, the fact questioners, and the free minds - and become one yourself. CIRCUSES:  No waiter service, you order at the counter, and you get your food on a paper sheet.  Suits and reservations are not necessary.  Attitudes are not tolerated.  Philisophical drunks welcome, rowdy fratboys and drunken angry trixies will get you a night in the clink.  FOOD:  Cheeseburgers and hamburgers were the norm.  Now the place has expanded to include an assorted menu of healthier items, like chicken sandwiches, onion rings and italian beef.  I would stick with the norm.  Fries are also now available. DRINKS:  ""Pepsi"" has now been changed to ""RC Cola"" and all it's derivatives.  However, liquor, beer and wine are always available.  A big plus in the middle of the night. WHEN TO GO:   Lunch -  if you are absolutely starving and you want to wait for a mediocre burger like the other tourists.   Dinner - same as lunch, but less waiting.   Late night after 2AM on a weekday - call it magic, but after working late at night, and this place being one of the few places open, this is where the full character of the burger\beer or shot\and sour pickles meet at their peak.  Your reward, after a long day of work, is a little bit of history and chance to rub elbows with the greatest thinkers Chicago had and has to offer, and add your name to the legacy.",0.9722,0.888,0.088,0.023,0.4549506694855532
