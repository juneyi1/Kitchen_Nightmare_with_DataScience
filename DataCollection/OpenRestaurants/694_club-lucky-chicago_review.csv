2017-08-15,5.0,"This is an amazing Italian restaurant! It's the best I have been to in Chicago. It is a typical lounge style restaurant with great outside seating. The service is great and they treat you well. When you sit down you are served a basket of complimentary fresh baked bread which is very tasty. The menu has a good variety of the basic Italian foods (spaghetti, raviolli, lasagna, Alfredo, ect.)  And They weave in some extra ordinary main dishes along with a great desert menu and many wine options to choose from. The Italian food tastes authentic and the vibe of the restaurant is very calm. There wasn't anything that made me complain at all! Very good, 5 stars!",0.9891,0.702,0.28,0.018,0.44574879227053127

2017-07-18,4.0,Great Italian food in bucktown. This place was a short walk from my friends place. We came here after an exhausting bike ride. We had the mozerella friti which was amazing. Perfectly breaded pieces of cheese in a great marinara sauce. I had the rotini with veal meatballs as my entree. It was fairly sizeable portions. The meatballs were okay. They put pieces of fresh mozzarella cheese with the pasta. I enjoyed the entree but it was not stellar. Overall a nice Italian restaurant. I will definitely go back to try some of the other items on the menu and also try some of the cocktails.,0.9217,0.776,0.183,0.041,0.49558823529411766
2017-07-14,3.0,"I was so excited to try this place because it looked so old school Italian. Instead what I found myself comparing this place to was Pasta Bowl which is amazing and way cheaper than this meal. I got the linguine with clams in red sauce and I felt like the red sauce was so watery I barely had any flavor in the noodles. The clams weren't cooked with the noodles and felt like frozen clams with how tough the texture was when I chewed. I can't believe the prices for this restaurant and how pricey it was for a meal that was this basic in tasting. I much rather go to Pasta Bowl for a more worthwhile and cheaper Italian experience. To soften the blow, I have to admit the bread was tasty.",0.9258,0.868,0.121,0.011,0.3160256410256411

2017-06-13,4.0,"I thought Club Lucky was the name of a nightclub for twenty-somethings to go drink and dance their young urges away. I was surprised and impressed to find that it's a solid Italian restaurant that I would totally go back to. We ordered the fried calamari ($13.95), which while it was wanting a little more flavor in the breading, was by far the freshest fried calamari I've ever had. I'm not a big friend calamari fan but I would totally order this again. A dozen of their stuffed Little Neck Clams was also very good ($16.95 I think). The Homemade 8 Finger Cavatelli pasta entree was a classic/signature dish of theirs and I really liked this one too. $17.95 The Chicken Francese was done very well $18.95 and I would get this one again too. We topped the night off with their Warm Toll House Cookie $7.95 for dessert. This was pretty decadant.

They have very solid food and good service.  The only downside is it has gotten very expensive and nothing has really changed to justify the increases. It is probably the area's taxes and the city being so anti business that is causing the increases, but for the price there is better Italian in Chicago, otherwise this would be a 5 star review.",0.7936,0.795,0.146,0.059,0.534

My only complaints: spotty service (friendly but slow) and weird vibration that dominated the booth. We noticed it as soon as we sat down, the host assured us we we're not imagining it.

Unquestionably the best calamari I've ever tasted anywhere. We order calamari everywhere we go and Club Lucky wins! There's a massive menu of Italian classics, fresh fish specials expertly prepared, the Club Lucky salad is a great starter and their fresh bread dipped in olive oil and spices is addicting. Wine markups by the bottle are minimal which encourages you to order a bottle to really enjoy your dinner. Service is always attentive and never fails to leave you with the feeling that you're a very appreciated customer. That's huge!

The rest of our party showed up and we went to be seated.  We had dinner at 6pm and things were a bit empty at that point.  The menu is easy to understand and offers all the things you'd expect with an Italian restaurant.  I got the 8 fingers with 2 beef meatballs.  The food was absolutely excellent! I was blown away by how good the service, food and atmosphere.  We kept ordering drinks and they were always a strong pour and the final bill was very reasonable for the food and drinks we ordered.

My wife and I ordered some nice Italian food for our night in.  Here was our order, Homemade Eggplant Parmigiana, Homemade Tortellinis  and some Tiramisu. This food cost $63 total for delivery.  It came with 2 small pieces of bread to go with the tiny portions.  It should be noted that it was cold, but that shouldn't be held against them, since it was delivery and that can happen.  However the quality of the food was a slight notch above chef boyardee.  Overall between the quality of the food, the cost and the length of delivery, I'd say its the worst takeout experience of my life.

Nearly 10 minutes before the drinks were dropped off, the waitress said she would be right back, then spent the next 10 minutes taking care of a large party next to us.  The restaurant was fairly busy, but had about 20% of their tables open, so certainly not just temporarily overwhelmed.  We had another longer than normal wait after we ordered, and when the food did arrive, my order was wrong. Not wrong as in undercooked, or missing something on the side, but the entirely wrong dish. My wife started eating as we waited for them to spend the next 10-15 minutes making my correct dish.  The food (when it finally arrived) was fine, but found the sauces to be bland, and really nothing special otherwise.  Short from the brief apology, no effort was made to compensate for the extremely slow service or the incorrect dish. We paid our $75 tab and got out of there.

I visited last night, after not having dined there for a number of years, and was a bit surprised that the menu is pretty much exactly the same as it was when it first opened.  They're not reinventing the wheel here. You won't find carpaccio or risotto on the menu, but rather standard red-sauce Italian fare. It's reliable and enjoyable. The service is great. It walks that fine line between being attentive, but not pandering. Our server made great recommendations on cocktails and entrees, and she knew the menu well.

Finally you walk in and boom!! Feels like the setting for a 50-60s mob movie. The front section has a nicely sized bar with TVs and some dineresque booth seating, very dark. Walk to the back section and get a seat in the well lit and fancier dining room. You sit down and feel like you'll spot Liotta, Pesci, and Deniro at another booth giving you the stink eye for finding their hideout.  You open the menu and can hardly decide between the seafood, pasta, steaks, wines,  etc.... Your food shows up and its just like Nonna woulda made it, I mean fah-getta-boutit!

Either it really is, or has been made to look exactly like a ""Little Italy""Chicago restaurant from the 50s. Right down to the multicolored worn tile floor. They play cool music, not the tired old Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin Italian restaurant standards. The cocktails we had were outstanding. Well-made and not over complicated. Great drinks made by great bartenders, not ""craft cocktail"" nonsense. For food we had three appetizers, calamari, sausage and peppers, and their incredible fried artichoke. All wonderful. Get the calamari Calabrese style. For dinner we shared a pasta dish, again spot on, plus had an espresso and Italian cookies for dessert. Also had a glass of grappa which was one of the best I've had recently. We had the same server for both the appetizer and then when we came back for dinner.

Firstly, their red gravy (known to the rest of you as marinara sauce) is impeccably bright and flavorful. The eight finger cavatelli is nothing but noodles and sauce, but it's one of the best meals I've ever had. Likewise the string bean salad with blue cheese and tomato seems to be a Chicago Italian Family classic and it delivers just like the real thing. My favorite however, is the eggplant parmigiana. There must be a dozen or more thinly sliced layers of eggplant breaded and layered with cheese and sauce. It's remarkable. The venue itself used to be an old VFW hall and it retains all the charm and volume of a 1950's dance hall. The retro interior designs and gorgeous classic bar evoke a real sense of Chicago's past.

We sat in a booth located in the bar section of the restaurant. The lighting is REALLY dark. After we placed our orders we were presented a giant 1/2 loaf of hot italian bread. Clearly homemade, it was shaped like a traditional american white bread loaf but with a very fluffy inside and flaky crust. It's served with a beautifully garlicky olive oil. Keep this in mind. It was a lot of bread and sort of negated the need for ordering appetizers.  My wife got the carbonara, which was on the daily special menu. I ordered the chicken vesuvio on recommendation of our server. I was offered a half or whole chicken and am kind of blown away they even offer a whole chicken. That's a hell of a lot of food.  My wife's pasta serving was huge, but the white sauce was just a bit too light in flavor. Leaning more towards white wine than cream. Good but not what she expected. I felt somewhat the same with my dish. It was delicious, don't get me wrong. But everything just sort of tasted the same. Both of us ended up lusting for red sauce and decided that next visit we'll get dishes with a bit more variety.  Seasoning was also a little underwhelming and I ended up hitting the salt shaker a bit too much. At one point I got the ""you've put too much salt on your meal"" look from my wife. Yes, I have salt issues, but it was pretty bland. Atmosphere is awesome, and you really do feel like you're in a time capsule from a time long passed. The friendly attitude from the staff and the funky vibe are worth the visit along. Dining on a weeknight, it wasn't crazy busy, but I would probably not stop by on the weekend.

Then we were lead to our table, in the dining room that was crowded but not cramped. We shared a Caprese salad, which was delicious (even though it's hard to find acceptable tomatoes in February in Chicago).  For my entree, I had homemade tortellini, filled with chicken and herbs, finished with peas, pinenuts, and vodka sauce.  Delicious!   Our waitress, Samantha, was cheerful and didn't make us feel rushed at all, even though it was obviously a busy night. (And it took us a while to get through our bottle of wine.)   Prices are on par with similar Italian restaurants in the city ... pastas in the $10 to $18 range, second courses are $18 to $35.   The menu features relatively basic Italian fare -- nothing shi-shi or over the top, but the food is made well.  I would definitely go back soon to try another entree and enjoy the atmosphere.",0.9904,0.8,0.183,0.017,0.5608695652173913

2014-02-05,3.0,"Been here a number of times now. First the PROS: 1. Location - We can walk to it, so even in the depths of this seemingly never-ending winter of our discontent, getting here is no problem. We never drive, but they do have valet parking at a reasonable-for-the-Bucktown/Wicker Park area price of $8.50. 2. Atmosphere - Very comfortable. We've dined in both large groups and as a couple in the dining room and the back party room. The rooms can get loud, especially if there are two or three large groups, so we prefer quiet nights. The booths are comfortable. We've never eaten in the bar area, but I do know that gets really crowded during busy times and people are pretty much standing right on top of you when you are seated in one of the booths. You're also right by the front door, so be prepared for cold air every time someone enters or leaves. Try to get seated in the dining room instead. 3. Service - Fantastic! Always friendly, always on top of things. Nothing to complain about here. 4. Food - The house bread and olive oil are very good. I highly recommend their pasta dishes. The servings are large and all the toppings I've tried have been delicious. The Salmon Oreganato is also very good. Highly recommend it. Cooked to perfection. I swap out the potatoes for sautéed spinach or escarole. Desserts are okay. Typical Italian choices like tiramisu, cake, sorbet, etc. Nothing that stands out in my mind. CONS: 1. Grilled Calamari - This is a tricky dish. If you leave the squid on the heat for even a few seconds too long, it's like you're eating thick rubber bands. Also, somewhat bland without the accompanying topping. Can't recommend this. Perhaps the fried calamari is better. Maybe next time I'll try that. 2. Drink prices - Pretty much the same all over the city now - $10.00 - $11:00 for small pours. My glass is always full of ice, so I'm paying for less than 4 oz. of mixed drink. Not cool. I'll skip the drinks in the future.  Because it's so convenient, we most likely will return at some point, but it won't become a regular place to dine for us.",0.9979,0.776,0.202,0.022,0.502462395760268

2014-01-03,3.0,"A group of friends and I celebrated New Year's this year at Club Lucky. A lot of my friends are regulars there, but it was my first time since I don't live in Bucktown. They raved about the food, so I expected something really great.  We had made our reservation for 10PM but called that night at about 8:30 to check on the status and to ask if it would be possible to add one more chair to our table, making us a party of 8. They were really friendly and said it was no problem to add a chair, and they let us know that they were running about 10 minutes behind. We arrived at about 10:15, but we were not seated until a little after 10:30. In that time, we had to wait in the bar area, which also has booths and the bathrooms as well as the only access to the entry, so those 15 minutes felt a lot like riding the Red Line at rush hour.  When we were finally seated, we were very pleased. Even with the extra chair, I don't think any of us felt cramped or crowded. The main dining room was decorated with thousands (literally) of helium-filled balloons, while the bar area had tons of giant snowflakes hanging from the ceiling. The place really had a great ambiance for the celebration. The warm bread and olive oil was really great, though for a table of 8 we probably could have done with a bit more bread than one loaf. For apps, we ordered fried and grilled calamari. Both dishes had a great flavor, but the texture of the calamari was a little rubbery for my taste. I ordered the 8-finger cavatelli as my entree, and it was OK. I added broccoli to it, and I think the dish would have been really boring without it. If I go again, I'll probably order something else. (I would have liked to try the lobster ravioli special, but they were out of it by the time we got there.) My favorite thing that I tasted was the Horse's Head cocktail. That I will definitely try again! Where Club Lucky really shined was their outstanding service. I feel horrible for forgetting our waiter's name already, but everybody working there seemed to be in a friendly mood for having to work on a holiday.  New Year's festivities at Club Lucky include a bottle of champagne per couple, hats, noisemakers, poppers and streamers, and a live band with a dance floor. Reservations were $25, and that seemed really reasonable for everything you got. We had a really good time!",0.9983,0.762,0.209,0.029,0.6302901463615749
2014-01-02,5.0,"My husband and I had our rehearsal dinner at Club Lucky in October--It was the perfect place for us, because that's where we met 3.5 years ago!  In short, we would highly recommend it for any private event!  The restaurant offers two spaces to choose from: (1) the private dining room, which seats about 30 people, or (2) part of the main dining room, which seats more than 30 people.  We used the private dining room, which was great for our group--It was certainly ""cozy"" with 4 tables of 7-8 people each in a relatively small space, but that was the feel that we were going for.  The food was fantastic--Club Lucky starts you off with their homemade bread with olive oil and parmesan cheese, yum!  We chose a menu of sausage and peppers and calamari calabrese for appetizers, the Club Lucky and Caesar salads, lasagna and a special pasta, chicken marsala for the entree, and an assorted dessert platter.  All of the food was delicious!  The food was all served family style, which helped everyone (who didn't know each other well beforehand) get to know one another better.  The restaurant offers drink packages or you can pay by consumption--We just ordered 3 bottles of wine (1 white and 2 red) per table ahead of time and just ordered additional bottles as needed throughout the night.  I think this was more cost effective than the drink packages.  The service was outstanding!   Jim Higgins, one of the owners, was awesome to work with through the planning process, and he even allowed us to choose a pasta (housemade cavatelli with parmesan infused red sauce, sausage, veal, fresh ricotta and basil) to serve that was on their specials menu one night when we dined there.  Club Lucky went above and beyond to make sure that we had a great night!  If you go on a regular night, I highly recommend the Club Lucky Manhattan, meat/cheese Antipasto platter, carrot cake, and housemade limoncello!",0.9972,0.8,0.196,0.004,0.5484389334389335

I spoke with the server before we ordered to alert her that we would be having three separate tabs, she said it wouldn't be a problem, that she could not split it up while we were ordering but that she could do it when we were closing out. 8:00 Given the check, with everything on one tab 8:10 Server stops by, I ask her if she could please split it up as we previously discussed?  No, the system won't allow it, you have to do it yourself 8:20 Server stops by, she sees that we split it up by card ie: card #1 gets this, this, and this... No, I need you to do the math and tell me how much goes on each card 8:30 Math Math Math (not fun after several cocktails), server stops by and picks up the math and the cards 8:40 Server comes back, she can't split the tab after all, it all has to be on one card.  Really?  You didn't know that before?  She gives us back the three cards, we give her one card.  Math down the drain I guess. 8:50 Server comes back, she was able to put the tab on the three cards after all, she presents us with the receipts for the three cards that she has already given back to us!!!  How is the correct math on these three cards when you just said it couldn't be done???   9:00 Tab paid.  We can leave now.  Am I hungry again? This additional hour of frustration and confusion really put a kibosh on an otherwise lovely experience.  My father spoke with the manager, who blamed the whole ordeal on their ancient PoS system.  Technology can be updated and servers can be trained, time can't be returned.  And on top of that we walked outside and there was a massive line of people waiting to be seated.  It is unfortunate that those people had to wait an hour to drink and eat when they could  have been seated a while ago...   (I'm not a heartless person, I've been a server and I know it gets busy and hectic- but I always appreciated the upfront table who would give me a heads up about separate checks, and if it wasn't possible to accommodate their request I would verbalize it, this particular situation had minimal to no communication and we really did far more work than I ever imagined) I have always had a good time at Club Lucky but I felt terrible that my out of town guests had to sit through the ordeal.  I will go back, but not with a large group and maybe I wait until they get a new PoS System.",0.9926,0.805,0.127,0.069,0.4708866943241943

It's also cool that the restaurant is nestled away in a great residential area and has patio seating for the warmer months.

First things first - cocktails!  Any good old school Italian joint must take pride in their cocktails, and Club Lucky takes the new cocktail school and wraps it in the old school.  Rye cocktails are featured heavily here, and they are delicious.  If you are a clear liquor fan they'll fix you up with a gin or vodka martini, too, no worries, kiddo. As for the food, it is good, filling, large portions.  Get the Italian Sausage and peppers, and anything with meat sauce.  Perhaps not the best Italian you've ever had, but it is good and you get a lot of it; perfect for reheating the next day after a few too many cocktails. For a fun, laid back night out on the town where you don't have to get too dressed up but they'll like you even more if you do, head to Club Lucky.",0.9836,0.78,0.191,0.029,0.39554834054834054

The last time we had food delivered, at first they said it would be an hour - which is typical for a Saturday night. Then we were very happy when it came in half the time and the delivery woman was very pleasant. Sometimes you get people who just drop the food and run.

I guess it's the red and black and white theme with the chairs, booths and tiled floor..... The food is good as it gets and when we went we ordered family style and all shared a little of what came to the table. For starters we had the antipasto and caprese salad. The salad itself was exceptional as well as the antipasto. The antipasto had a great assortment and was almost a meal in itself. For main courses we had some chicken parmigiani and sausages. The chicken was well prepared and so was the pasta that came along with it but the grilled sausages with peppers really stood out as delicious as all get out. The service was decent and our drinks never went dry but was nothing that really stood out. I think this is because they have kinda limited seating and a large crowd on the weekends so it feels like they are trying to turn tables over as quickly as possible. But I'm just guessing there. Anyways, check it out if you are in the mood for some good Italian food. For sure try the sausages if your inner carnivore is screaming out.",0.963,0.857,0.121,0.023,0.48556731334509107

Now, I love Italian food (having grown up in an Italian neighborhood on the Jersey shore) and I was quite excited to attend what I heard was a Bucktown institution. The food was okay, but not the best I had ever had. The salad seemed to have too many carrots and celery and not enough of anything else, plus was doused in dressing. Then my fettuccine alfredo was already cold by the time we were served, but it had already taken so long to get the food that I just attempted to eat it rather then send it back. Finally, the service wasn't the greatest- our waitress rang out credit cards up wrong, and then kept telling us that we had done something wrong until after 10 minutes of arguing she checked it again (and realized her mistake).

This time around though, the couple I was out with suggested we eat here when the line for us to get a table at Piece was 1.5 hours. Damn glad we did.. Our Order: -Eggplant Parmigiana: Layers of thinly sliced eggplant baked with provolone and tomato sauce served with penne pasta. Hell yea, this dish was great. It's really traditional if you have ever had any Italian friends and luckily been invited over for a meal. Here they cook it as perfect as I have ever had it, as the eggplant was extremely tender, just the way I like it. -Linguine Pesactore: Freshly made linguine, perfectly al dente, smothered in a red wine sauce with garlic, and covered with baby clams, calamari, jumbo shrimp, salmon, and spinach. This is always a go to Italian dish for me since I cannot ever get enough seafood. The great thing about this dish is finishing all the linguine and seafood, only to find leftover broth just begging you to sop it up with the homemade fresh Italian bread they serve to you.  All in all this place is a well run establishment. The bar up front is great, the service is just right, and the portions to cost ratio is definitely in the patrons favor.

The dishes are big and saucy.  A tad heavy and pricey, but you get lots of it and you will eat every bite.  I had the seafood pasta special and they allowed me to sub out my pasta for a different type.  My pasta was a bit overcooked, but that is easy to do with capellini.  Still delicious, especially after a few yummy cosmos.  The cannoli dessert was pricey too, but to die for.",0.9737,0.752,0.212,0.036,0.5704365079365078

I needed about 5 pieces to cut up, they brought about 10. Regardless of the 5 or 10 noodles, I am completely appalled that we were charged $5 after what our bill amounted to with all of our dinners. I fully understand charging for kids who actually eat, but I just needed something to give my daughter to keep her busy. I would have gladly given her some of my food but there were pine nuts, and that is an allergen (you aren't supposed to give to babies under 1). I hope I am not sounding like one of those parents who think that because they have kids, they deserve ___ (let me also note we tip extra because of said eater-in-training), but I really don't think I'm off base with asking an ITALIAN restaurant to give me just a few pieces of cooked pasta.

The caesar dressing is made in house and wonderful.  There are so many main dishes that are great. Penne bolonese, Fettucine alfredo (don't normally eat such a rich dish but at Lucky it is a bit lighter and wonderful), spaghetti and meatballs and lasagna. Additionally, they have nightly specials. If you save room for dessert, the warm toll house cookie with ice cream is killer. If you don't have time to eat in, they also do carry out. The bar area is comfortable with a few tv's that show local sports. There is a good selection of house martinis, beer and wine.  For the Holidays, the restaurant is very festive.

2012-02-22,4.0,"Short Version - Terrible Wait - Great Drinks - Amazing Appetizers - Good Food Long Version A friend of mine lives across the street from Club Lucky so we decided to keep things close and have dinner there on a Saturday night. The only real downside of the evening came right at the beginning.  We asked how long it would be for a group of five and they told us two and a half hours.  Normally I don't crazy waits like this, especially at 8pm on a Saturday night.  But with my friend living across the street, we decided to go have some drinks at his house while we waited.  The general manager even took down our cell phone number and offered to call when our table was ready. 90 minutes later we got the call that our table was ready.  Upon walking into the dining room I was really surprised.  This place is twice as big as it looks on the outside and it was packed, always a good sign in my opinion. We started off the night with a round of martinis.  Everyone ordered something different but they were all amazing.  The gin blossom I ordered was maybe the best I have ever had. While waiting for our drinks, they brought out the bread and olive oil.  My friend had been talking it up all night I was thought I was going to be let down.  But to my surprise, it was unreal.  I can easily say that they served the best bread and olive oil that I have ever had in my life.  The olive oil is infused with garlic and Italian seasonings and the bread is soft on the inside but crispy on the outside. From there we ordered some appetizers.  We had the calabrese calamari and the stuffed artichokes.  I personally can't speak to the calamari, allergic to shellfish, but the table loved it.  I did have some of the stuffed artichokes and they were good. Finally on to the meal.  Among the table we tried the veal parm, fettuccine alfredo, and cavatelli wth vodka sauce.  Everything was good but nothing was amazing.  I would have to say that the cavatelli was the best.  Its a pasta made from gnocchi ingredients.   All and all, it was an amazing evening.  We had sub par dinner the night before at Gene & Georgetti's and Club Lucky saved Chicago's food reputation.",0.997,0.783,0.188,0.028,0.5423847316704461

We knew we would sit at the bar so expectations were minimal. It was packed. Mostly people waiting for tables in the dining room. Seemed like a nice mixed crowd from the neighborhood. It was loud and lively. Nice start for a Friday. It took forever to get a drink. I drink a lot and I would have loved to catch a buzz but the bartender was ... I would like to have thought he was swamped but he just wasn't that busy. For me to have just two drinks in three hours sitting at the bar I can only assume I was being ignored. My friend is really hot and I think she could only get two drinks as well.  We finally got a look at the menu. Nothing special there. We ended up with calamari, the fried cheese discs and an over dressed caesar salad. I had to ask for more olive oil twice with extended waits to get anyone's attention. We would have ordered wine with our food, something after and possibly dessert. We thought we ordered a night cap but they were not received. We finally canceled the order and got the check.  As it was our bill was over $75!!! WTF.  There was one really annoying moment when the bartender passed a drink between my friend and I to a guest behind us. We were in the middle of a conversation. We had to stop talking and move apart to keep from being hit in the face by a beer bottle. It was among one of the rudest, most unprofessional restaurant/bar experiences I have ever had.

So, in all fairness, I have only visited Club Lucky twice...once on the patio and once inside (both for dinner). My first visit was superb.  The food was delicious, the service was great and I thought the pricing was very reasonable.  I would have given you a 4 Club Lucky! For my second visit, I was with a group and we were trying to carb load (sort of) for a race, so I figured Club Lucky would be a perfect place to visit.  I will say that service of the host is fantastic.  We were disappointed to hear about a 45min to an hour wait, but hey, we didn't have reservations, so shame on us.  However, after about 20 min, the host let us know that a reservation had bailed, so we could have their table - yay!  so, a 5 for the host! Service at the table...however...left a bit to be desired.  Our server was nice enough, but I would call him overbearing.  One of my friends commented that he only seemed to come around to try and up sell us something (wine anyone?).  The most blatant up sell was his attempt to get us to order more appetizers...we had already ordered the sausage as well as the pizza bread (plus the bread that came with the table was also there...) for a table of 5.  He was pushing calamari on top of that (thankfully, we declined).  And for the 5 of us...we had too much food in terms of appetizers, so not sure why he seemed so skeptical of our order.  He also came multiple times to try and get us to order wine (now, this is not unusual at restaurants, but when a few of us didn't order glasses, he kept asking and asking....).  We had to decline dessert a few times... So, this server, while friendly enough I guess, annoyed us..and is bringing service all the way down to a 3. The atmosphere is nice (nicer on the patio) and really loud inside, so I'm going to with a 3. Bathrooms - quite nice and clean, so a 4. On to the food....  The first visit was delicious.  I was not so impressed by my second visit.  My chicken Parmesan was not very flavorful and tasted like something I could get anywhere.  It was ok, but not spectacular.  I tried one of the pastas and it was really salty.  The general consensus of the table was that the food was ok, but not great (well, aside from the lamb special which was devoured).  So, a 3 for food...ok, but nothing special. The value is pretty good.  I would say that you get a lot of food for the price, so that's nice.  A 4 for value.

The place was a little loud, but not anything earth-shattering, especially since most of the noise was probably coming from us. :) The low lighting was nice and had a real ""dinner"" feel to it. It wasn't long after our drinks arrived that Megan popped over to take our order. I ended up splitting a caprese salad and Italian sausage with peppers and it ended up being a truly fantastic choice. The salad was fresh and the cheese was just amazing! The Italian sausage was cooked to perfection. Really savory and juicy. I was stuffed even having split both dishes!  At the end of the meal, Megan was super helpful with the check, as there were a number of us that only had credit. She took the time to adjust the bill to meet everyones needs which ended up turning into 5 separate credit card payments and the rest in cash. I don't think I've been to a place that actually finagled our bill like that. It was much appreciated! As the night wore on, there were about 5 or 6 of us remaining from the group just chatting.

Fast forward a few years, my partner and I decide to take our foodie friend for a celebratory (but late) birthday dinner.

The backroom and main dining room with something I didn't expect: almost a 1930s-era supper club. I actually was waiting for the same smell I've experienced in the cabin of, say, a 1937 Hudson Terraplane. We did it up with apps and dinner. We are not shy eaters and the portions did not disappoint. This is the type of restaurant I could take my dad: good value, giant portions and a doggie bag. It's also the kind of understated place to come on a second date (it's just a tad too loud for a first date). I got the rigatoni with sausage. For classical, simple Italian food it was rather good. Good flavors, a bit on the salty side. Classy food like this doesn't come cheap, however. With two apps, three dinners and no alcohol, the bill came to $90 without tip. Not cheap.

Hook me up with some olive oil and parm cheese. Yes. Club Lucky Salad - so simple but their dressing is the perfect combination of tangy and tart. Shrimp Scampi - Delcious and garlicy to the max with tons of flavor and lemon. On the menu you have to choose between spinach or fettucine, but I say order it with BOTH. There's an up-charge but so worth it. Spaghetti and Meatballs, Chicken Parm, Lasagna, etc. etc. - If you're looking for the traditional italian favorites, I think Club Lucky is great. It's not outside the box in any way, but the relaxed atmosphere and dependable food will satisfy your craving for italian well-enough.

Let's talk about the positives.  Good thought in all of the Christmas decorations..they really care about the holidays because it takes time to hang everything in here.  It is definately a nice festive atmosphere.  The bread that hits the table is amazing...fresh, soft, crunchy and warm...just like I remember it...the bread gets 5 stars...best bread in the city.  We had the Italian Pastina Soup...that was amazing...lots of pieces of shredded chicken in the bowl and really delicious.  We also had the chicken Parm and this is where there was a let down.  The side of pasta and red sauce was so good but the chicken parm was really bland.  It was like the chef forgot to season the batter because it was lacking any taste at all.  The chicken was also not juicy...it was a little dry.  So that is where I am torn...everything was great except the main course and for 15 dollars you would think that the chicken would have been perfect...also it was less Chicken parm and more like 4 little bland chicken fingers covered in sauce.  The management and chef really need to look at this because it is completely wrong. The waiter was amazing and really friendly...he did ask if everything was alright but I didnt have the heart to tell him that the chicken was terrible.  I hate sending back food because I am afraid that they will add some special sauce to my order when it comes back to the table. Still a great location, great staff, amazing atmosphere, most of the food was really good too but I am talking about free bread, soup and the side...the main course was lacking in any wow factor!!!  I wish Yelp had a half star because my review would be more of 3.5 Stars!!!",0.9964,0.777,0.187,0.036,0.6080781440781439

We had a big party an the fresh, hot bread that hit the table as we sat down was a great start. Fried Calamari redeemed many sad recent encounters with that dish with crisp batter and thick n tasty marinara. I though the salad was a pretty good take on the traditional Italian salad with the chunks of fontinella cheese being the highlight. On to the main courses....Penne arrabiata w/ shrimp lacked any real zest or flavor. I coulda opened a jar of tomato sauce at home and made the same thing. The shrimp were plump but there were only 3 which was disappointing. Chicken vesuvio with potatoes was a pretty solid take on the dish and a healthy portion that will make for good leftovers. Service was a little pushy and I don know if this is standard but they lost a star because of a desert ordeal. We were celebrating a birthday and someone brought the birthday girl her favorite cake all the way from NYC! While I understand the restaurant charging some fee for it, they notified us that it would be $1 per slice. It's one thing if we hadn't ordered tons of food and wine and seemed like we were just being cheap but this was something special for a birthday..... I hate when Yelp reviews are skewed b/c of nitpicky service things but this was mishandled and left a bitter taste in my mouth in terms of this place trying to squeeze more money out of it's customers. Look, I think there's better Italian in the neighborhood and certainly in Chicago. It's reasonably priced, food is mediocre to good, and atmosphere is worth checking out at some point.

2010-11-10,2.0,"I had heard from a co-worker that this place was really good. I now feel bad that I made my friends come here.  First of all the place was so dark that we could barely see each other and the fact that there was no backround music at all forced you to have to listen to the conversations of everyone else around you. Believe me I like dark intimate restaurants, but this was not done well. But I could deal with dark and loud if the food was good and good it was not.  First of all for an Italian restaurant to have very small portions is unacceptable. Also the meal does not come with soup or salad so you need to order that separate. When we asked the server if we could order a side salad she said that they didn't have side salads, but she would do us a favor and bring out a smaller salad that they did not have on the menu. What Italian place does not offer a side salad to go with meals? I mean a smaller side salad that you could pay to accompany your meal. Eventually she brought out a small side salad on a very small bread plate. When we got the bill the bread plate sized small salad was $8! The large salad was only $9.95. So how was this a side salad? On top of the fact that there was absolutely nothing special about their sauce on their dishes just made this experience go from bad to worse.

2010-08-30,2.0,"Such a waste of atmosphere, location and former glory. Club Lucky wasn't spectacular when it opened 20 years ago but it was solid; but  like the rest of Bucktown it has become nothing but an empty shell of soul-less marketing and me-too opportunism. When the yupsters' money runs out, perhaps the management at Club Lucky will return to providing a worthy product and service. As it stands now, they are under-staffed, under-trained and over-priced . Upon arriving at 6pm, we  interrupted the gaggle of FOH staff at the service bar and were given a booth in the empty main dining room with water and a menu. After perusing the menu for 15 minutes and drinking four pints of water, we met our server who brought the specials and wines by the glass menu and asked if we would like something to drink. (I still love the water from those aluminum pitchers and the Italian porters' wait jackets though) As I was hungry, I asked to have the food arrive in the order it was most quickly prepared. So we had our one pasta served first. I assumed that they had split the dish in the kitchen and the runner had only brought half of the order. But no, $18 now buys you 3oz of box pasta, 3 overcooked shrimp, 4 leaves of spinach and 4oz of olive oil. OK, EVOO is expensive, but I don't need to drink the shit. Next comes the melrose pepper salad and antipasto board, except it's not the board of meats and cheeses that I pointed to on the specials menu; it's the vegetarian option from the regular menu that I specifically said I did not want. Digging into the $12 salad, we find that the peppers are  not roasted as stated, but deep fried, every prep cook's favorite cheat. I could almost excuse that had they taken the time to remove the core and seeds and skin, but no, these still had congealed droplets of  oil on them. Buried under these travesties were two of yesterday's slimy cardboard tomato slices, and a small mountain of overdressed limp romaine. Maybe, I'm paying for the 55 gal drums of olive oil they must use.  Finally the antipasto board arrives w/ the olives that were missing from the salad.  This is actually one of the better deals in town, granting that you can get 2 subs on Grand Ave consisting of the same meats for @ the same price. Good proscuitto, soppressata, and salami. Tasty olive mix, and though the pimentos were canned, I suspect they are imported because they were good too. A short word on the service. Twelve busboys, two servers and one food runner. Three dining areas seating @ 150? And a manager/host picking out songs on the jukebox while another table sends back it's order.

My boyfriend got the calamari appetizer, while I just got a house salad. He seemed to be happy with the mammoth-portioned appetizer, while I really, truly loved this damn salad. I'm a picky, picky, picky eater...and the pickiest with salads, and this one was a surprise that knocked my socks off! Seriously, it was so simple and to the point, but done very well.  What it comes down to: despite the menu being pretty limited, kind of pricey and not all that appetizing (massive portions of kind of boring, Americanized Italian food), I really loved the old school supper club atmosphere this place has. And if you like seafood, try the calamari appetizer, and if you like salad, try one of theirs!  I would like to come back to this place again soon when I'm on an empty stomach.

My husband and I were just taking a walk enjoying the spring evening when we walked right past a giant ad for Club Lucky painted onto the brick exterior of a building with an arrow pointing down the street. On a lark, we decided to follow it and found ourselves at Club Lucky, which looked like it came straight off a movie set starring Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart.  We didn't feel like waiting 30 minutes for a table outside so we opted for a booth in the main dining room in the back. Good thing we did, because I happen to love booths and this one was just like butta baby. The dining room was large, with a floor made for dancing and dated drapes and fixtures. You can kind of tell this place must have been the shiz back in the day, but I had no idea it was even nestled here in my own neighborhood. The bread was warm and chunky, served traditional style with all the olive oil, salt, pepper and parmesan cheese a girl could want. We also ordered a bottle of Moscato (I'm a fan of dessert before dinner) and started with the Mozzarella Fritti (freshly breaded and fried buffalo mozzarella) which was deeelish. I ordered Chicken Parmigiana (one of my standby Italian food staples) and it was good, but not as breaded as I normally like. It was huge though so I ate it for lunch two days later and somehow it tasted better as leftovers. Can't decide if that's a good thing or not. Overall, we had a great time and enjoyed the family style feel of this joint, and the food was good enough to want to come back and try something else. 3.5 stars for sure.",0.9941,0.812,0.18,0.009,0.518344671201814

I ordered the Spicy Penne and my date had the Chicken Parm. Though my date never offered me a bite (shame), his dish looked pretty good. Plenty of cheese and a generous side of pasta. My penne was simple yet tasty with the perfect amount of spiciness. Honestly a little boring and not loaded with ""plenty of basil"" as stated on the menu. Sadly the dining room was lonely with only a few tables occupied. But there were two things even more sad. The way the waiter shuffled around, for instance. I don't know exactly why, but this drives me nuts. Pick up your feet!! And the sad, sad lump of cookie they plopped on the table for dessert. (Brownstone's cookie skillet has completely ruined all future cookie desserts for me.) It was maybe 1.5-2 inches thick and rock hard. Thankfully it was topped with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream, so I could pretend to get my sweet on.  The thing that impressed me most about Club Lucky was the manager (I assume) who made sure to thank us on our way out. The thing that impressed me the least was the dirty bathroom.

2009-11-11,3.0,"I've dined at Club Lucky many times, but just decided to review it for the first time. While the menu offers plenty of Italian options including pastas, chicken and seafood, I find the food to be just average. I'd much rather go to any of the Francesca's or Tuscany for my Italian fix. I always get pasta or chicken Parmesan, so I thought I'd get something I've never tried and ordered the Chicken Francese. It was okay, but SO much better at Maggiano's. My boyfriend had the homemade ravioli, which was pretty good. Also, be warned that you WILL wait at least an extra 20-30 minutes even with a reservation. We had an 8:30 reservation on a Saturday night, and didn't get seated until close to 9 pm, and that was after my boyfriend complained twice to the manager and hostess.  While waiting at the bar, I had a Flirtini martini, which I didn't like at all. The bartender was rude and not friendly when we asked her for drink suggestions. Seriously, I've had nicer bar service at some hole in the wall dives! There goes your tip, lady. After waiting, we get seated in the worst possible table - a table meant for 4, literally right in front of the kitchen. So awkward but at this point we were just hungry so we dealt, but not such a great ambiance with waiters, busboys and waitresses running back and forth in between our table shuffling plates above their heads right past me. It's like they were trying to stuff one more table in, and placed it directly in the back to the point where you are basically sitting in the kitchen. (In past experiences, I've always had a nice booth or two-top table.) Once we left, the manager stopped us and apologized for the long wait and handed us his business card to call him in the future. We didn't really care, because as my boyfriend pointed out, if you want to really take care of your customers, send them a round of drinks or comp the bill or something, not hand us your stupid business card! Too late, buddy. I want to like Club Lucky more - it's always packed, I really like the atmosphere and the cute patio in the summer time - but I have found the food to be just alright, nothing special, the past few times I have come in.",-0.9673,0.779,0.089,0.132,0.4781279178338001

2009-11-10,3.0,"After years of seeing the signs for Club Lucky on North Ave, we finally ventured in for some Italian food (as Lucia was closed for a private event.)  We were hesitate upon walking in because the bar area is small and narrow, but around the corner was a huge dining room.  It is so darn cute inside, lots of character, like eating in someone's home.  There were a lot of people eating here on a Sunday night. They brought nice fresh baked bread to the table and it was warm and crusty.  We ordered Bruschetta to start and got 5 big pcs, there were huge chunks of tomato on top, yummy.  Even better with the parmesan they leave on the table. Entrees - I got one of the specials of the evening which was homemade tortellini with chicken, in a tomato cream sauce with peas.  The tortellini was pretty tasty, very thick, too big for 1 bite.  I thought there were too many peas in the dish.  The sauce was very good, but needed salt.  I added parmesan cheese instead.  Portion was not very big, but I exercised some self restraint and only ate about 2/3 leaving 1/3 for lunch the next day. The 3 other people at the table both got the spaghetti w/ marinara.  They charge $3-4 extra to add 2 meatballs or 1 sausage link.  The meatballs were quite big, but the sausage link was kind of a ripoff.  The waitress said it was big but she must have been thinking the size before cooking, because it was quite small when it came to the table.  Oh well.  There was nothing spectacular about spaghetti, in fact it was quite under whelming.  From what I tasted, it kind of tasted like a Lean Cuisine pasta dish.  It needed a lot of salt and it was not sauce enough.  They had to ask for extra sauce. Prices - I think they were a bit high priced for italian staples, and the portions were a little bit oversized, but for the prices they charged, you would expect a lot bigger portions.  I didn't think they were ""family sized"" portions.  I also don't get why they charge so much for extras either.  The $3-4 for meatballs/sausage, and it's an extra $6 for chicken on the fettucini alfredo!  They better give you 1/2 of a chicken for that! Service - Service was very good. Our server was very attentive, and they filled our bread bowl twice and water was filled a lot.   Total at the end of the meal including tax (not tip) was $60 for 1 appetizer and 3 entrees.",0.9949,0.861,0.127,0.011,0.5526072736787021

The people that work there are friendly and the servers are professional. They have a full bar (did I mention the delish martinis yet?) and a respectable wine list.

I had the lasagna with a side of meatballs.  DELICIOUS!  My friend had some special which was like 2 giant swirls of noodle and yummy ingredients inside.  A girl who sat down at the table next to us looked at my friends plate and asked her waiter what the heck it was cuz it just looked so darn good.

I could nickname this place Old Faithful.  It's really consistent and really great.  There are so many things to like about Club Lucky: FOOD: I would consider it pretty traditional Italian food, no frills, but generous portions that you can definitely share.  I always get the grilled chicken breast, which comes with broccoli and a little bit of spaghetti.  There are some great appetizers for sharing, too, and they have a BIG SALAD that I love. DRINKS: Killer martinis.  Blue cheese stuffed olives.  Cozy, retro bar with an awesome jukebox.  Whats not to enjoy? AMBIANCE: The beauty of Club Lucky is that it pleases all crowds.  Its got a great neighborhood atmosphere that makes it a perfect place to go on a weeknight.  Its tame enough that you can bring your family (even kids).  But its lively enough for a Friday/Saturday night out.   Club Lucky is a great time all around.",0.9972,0.568,0.38,0.052,0.6018518518518519

I read that someone referred to this place as retro-chic. The bar room, I'd say very much so. The main dining room I thought was kind of lacking decor-wise. Really, it was just white walls with dimmed lights. Nothing special at all. Another gripe about the room is that it was way too crowded and packed in, and way too loud. I had a hard time hearing our waitress, and this was with her already speaking fairly loudly. Food was very good. There were seven of us, and we got two orders of calamari to split among us. On the menu, it says each calamari appetizer serves two. When they say two, they should specify that that means two Joey Chesnuts or Kobeyashis -- we would have been fine with just one order! For the meal, I got the Penne Arrabiatta, which had a little kick of course, but it wasn't overwhelmingly spicy. And the penne was al dente (firm and tender), which is how pasta should be cooked. I also tried their special for the night, which was a gnocchi with a cream sauce and sun-dried tomatoes. Delicioso, but the gnocchi looked kind of like grubs. Just glad it didn't taste like them... A downfall of the place, other than the room, was the money. Not exactly the cheapest place in the world for dinner, although you would think that based on your surrondings.

Totally gross. When we sat bread came nice and fast but the waiter did not- then when he did come he expected an order right away(not easy since he just gave us  the specials).   The food is fine- boring but fine- everything is pasta in a red sauce - you can get better food almost anywhere in the city.

The fettucine de campo is one of my favorites with it's perfectly roasted garlic and slight spice with chicken and asparagus.  The veal meatballs are excellent and I strongly recommend them if you're getting a pasta dish without a meat and you like meat. The Italian sausage on the side is also pretty good. I love their take on cheese sticks in that it's hand-dipped and breaded slices of buffalo mozzarella and so stretchy and chewy. Mind you, this is very Americanized Italian food, but it lacks many faults of most Italian-American joints. They don't sugar up their red sauces which is something I enjoy. Oversalted and sugared sauces in your life might lead you to believe this place is bland. This is not old school or authentic by any means. This is a straight-up rat-pack era emulation of Brooklynized Vegas with it's vinyl booths and wait-staff uniforms as well as their martini list. No authentic 50s style Italian joint would have the martinis they do.

I can hear them saying, ""Whaaa no extra dirty martinis?"" And being the extra asocial person that I am, I have to say, the booths by the bar so I can eat, drink, and smoke to my heart's content is a definite plus. The lack of free refill on soda is a depressing state of affairs considering I drink soda like it was IV fluid and I was dying.

2006-10-29,4.0,Awesome place to go with a group.  When my parents came to Chicago with my grandma it was hard to find a place in the 'hood that was cute and fun but not so trendy that good ol' mom & dad would get freaked out or not want to eat anything on the menu.  Club Lucky certainly worked out.  The food is delicious--good old fashioned Italian and the decoration is adorable.,0.9566,0.679,0.258,0.062,0.6224025974025974
2006-09-29,5.0,"Club Lucky is that rare restaurant that you can take anyone from your cheap, anal retentive uncle to your overly-pierced and tattooed cousin.  The ambiance is nostalgic, service is above average and the food is consistent and competent. Club Lucky gets the coveted 5 star review because it's the stand by or no brainer.   It's good for couples and parties of 4 or more.",0.8834,0.781,0.188,0.031,0.6166666666666667
2006-09-13,3.0,"I met my former roommate here for dinner on a Saturday night.  Since I arrived early, I settled into the bar.  I actually liked the ambiance of the old-school bar and the patio seating more then the food.  My meal was good but not fabulous.  There was entirely too much olive oil used to cook my pasta, which was NOT al dente. Regardless, the food was tasty enough that I'd bring someone here for the experience.",-0.2057,0.9,0.051,0.049,0.5027777777777778
2006-08-17,5.0,"You can always get a feel for an italian place by the kind of bread they serve.  Warm, thick, crispy outside and incredibly moist and soft on the inside... coupled with the lighest garlic flavored oil, however, a perfect match.  Great calamari...  all 4 of us went our separate ways for the entrees and everyone was all smiles.  Chicken oreganatto -- has to be my favorite thus far.  Absolutely will be visiting this restaurant again.  The place itself has a funky beat to it that you appreciate right from the start.",0.9524,0.801,0.185,0.014,0.6721938775510204

2006-05-05,5.0,"I have been coming to Club Lucky for about 10 years now, and I still love it! Great service, great food, and great atmosphere have all been consistent. The neighborhood is great; however you may have some trouble parking nearby. Valet parking is available - Club Lucky turned the empty lot next to it into a valet parking lot. Valet will run you 7-11 dollars. When you walk into Club Lucky, you will have to walk through the retro-looking bar and a few booths in order to get to the dining room or the ""party"" room. The Juke Box is located near the door as well, playing ""Oldies"", Big Band, and Jazz, all to reflect the retro-chic atmosphere. Once in the dining room, the decor echoes that of a past era. If you read thoroughly, you will note that the fixtures are modeled after those made for the Empire State Building in New York. Needless to say, they are very cool! The String Bean Salad, Lasagna, Chicken Parmigiana, and unique Pasta Squares dishes are all highly recommended. Many of the noodles are made in-house. Save room for Tiramisu if you can! It is soaked in rum and the marscapone is freshly made. If you are planning a party, Club Lucky is very helpful and affordable (5-course meal for $27pp). Your guests will love the uniqueness of the spot. The management at Club Lucky is very accommodating!",0.9946,0.771,0.212,0.017,0.5652070707070708
2006-02-22,4.0,"Club Lucky is just plain cool.  It is a retro-style restaurant and cocktail lounge serving awesome Italian dishes.  You can taste the freshness in each bite of the pasta.  Club Lucky isn't really meant to be a ""family style"" restaurant, but I love getting a salad and a couple of entrees for a group of people to share.  The green bean salad is surprisingly marvelous. And if you can manage to save room for dessert (a hard task for sure) the tiramisu is some of the best I have had!  The restaurant gets very loud on the weekends, but I have never seemed to care because I am so into my meal!",0.9854,0.692,0.27,0.038,0.6074546485260771
